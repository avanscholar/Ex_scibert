0,Introduction,"Fossil resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas have been used to produce energy and chemicals since the Industrial Revolution of the 17th century. The use of fossil resources has caused various environmental problems such as global warming, climate change, and air pollution. To reduce the environmental issues, biomass usage, which represents abundant carbon-neutral renewable resources for the production of energy and chemicals, is one of the solutions. The shift from fossil resources to biomass as feedstock for chemicals should contribute to sustainability, and it should reduce the CO2 emission from some processes. It is predicted that 20 % of transportation fuel and 25 % chemicals could be produced from the lignocellulosic biomass by 2030 [1]. In the biorefinery, xylose, glucose, and sugar alcohol are the upper stream chemicals for producing C5-C6 chemicals, while ethanol and glycerol are treated as the upper stream for C2 and C3 chemicals, respectively. Glucose derived from cellulose can be converted to various chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid (LA), and γ-valerolactone (GVL) [1–6]. LA can be converted to variable chemicals such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, pentanoic acid, and 1,4-pentanediol. LA can be also dehydrated to produce unsaturated lactone, angelicalactones (ALs) [7], which is readily hydrogenated to GVL. Recent advances in the production of GVL have been reviewed [1–6]. Most research works on the production of GVL from LA are performed in the liquid phase, while vapor-phase conversion of LA to GVL is minor. We have summarized efficient catalysts in the vapor-phase continuous conversion of LA to GVL in a previous paper [8]. The continuous production of GVL is attractive from the point of view of the industrial application. In the vapor phase, noble metal catalysts such as Pd/C, Ru/C [9], and Au/TiO2 [10] have been reported to form GVL from LA. Ru/apatite catalyst shows the highest activity in the production of GVL among several supported metals such as Ru, Pt, Pd, Ni, and Cu [11]. However, non-noble metal catalysts are more competitive than noble metals. Non-noble metal catalysts such as Ni, Cu, and Co for the production of GVL have been reported by several research groups [8,12–22]. Cu/SiO2 [12] shows high selectivity of 99 % at a high hydrogen pressure of 1 MPa, whereas it is less selective at an ambient pressure because of low hydrogenation ability of pure Cu [20]. Ni-based catalysts such as Ni/ZSM-5 [13], Ni/SiO2 [14], and Ni/Al2O3 [17] show GVL selectivity at most 92 % due to the high ability of CC bond scission. Recently, a bimetallic Ni-Co/Al2O3 is reported as a catalyst with low coke formation [19]. We have recently reported that bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts supported on SiO2 with different Cu/Ni ratios show high performance, which is attributed to the inhibition of carbon accumulation by Ni and the inhibition of LA decomposition by Cu [20,21]. We have also reported that bimetallic Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst shows high catalytic performance with a GVL productivity of 5.46 kg kgcat –1 h–1 at 250 °C and a time on stream (TOS) of 24 h [8]. Gundeboina et al. have recently reported that a co-precipitated Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with 22 wt.% Cu and 44 wt.% Ni shows a GVL productivity of 1.68 kg kgcat –1 h–1 with 100 % conversion and a high GVL selectivity of 99.9 % at 275 °C for 30 h. Still, it decreases the hydrogenation activity with TOS under higher space velocity (SV) conditions [22]. A severe deactivation is also observed over Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalysts under high SV conditions [20,21]. In this study, Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with a total amount of Cu and Ni of 20 wt.% were prepared by a conventional impregnation method, and its catalytic activity was tested in the hydrogenation of LA to GVL under high SV conditions. We found that the bimetallic Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts showed a superior catalytic performance to other catalysts reported previously. Besides, a long-run experiment was performed to clarify the stability of the catalyst, and characterization of the used catalysts was conducted to elucidate the cause of deactivation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Bimetallic Cu-Ni supported on alumina catalysts, Cu-Ni/Al2O3, with different Cu/Ni weight ratio were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation. Al2O3 used as a catalyst support was supplied by the Reference Catalyst Division of Catalyst Society of Japan (JRC-ALO-7 with a specific surface area of 143 m2 g−1). The catalyst name is expressed as xCu-yNi/Al2O3, where x and y indicate the weight% of Cu and Ni metals, respectively. A detailed procedure of catalyst preparation was described in the supplementary information (SI)."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The characterization of catalysts was performed using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Details of the characterization were described in the SI file."
4,Catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL,"2.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL Vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA to GVL was performed in a fixed-bed flow reactor under the conditions: a temperature of 250 °C, a catalyst of 0.125 or 0.25 g, a liquid LA feed rate of 1.65 g h−1 without diluent, an ambient pressure of H2 with a flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1 at a molar ratio of H2/LA = 5.1. Details of the procedure in the catalytic reaction were also described in the SI file."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of unreduced samples such as 20Cu/Al2O3, xCu-yNi/Al2O3 (x + y = 20), and 20Ni/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 300 °C. The diffraction peaks of 20Cu/Al2O3 observed at 2θ = 32.7, 35.7, 38.9, 49.1, 53.7, 58.7, 61.9, 72.9, and 75.7° were attributed to CuO (Crystalography Open Database, COD 9008961, C12/c1, No.15), while the diffraction peaks of 20Ni/Al2O3 observed at 2θ = 37.3, 43.4, and 63.0° were attributed to NiO (COD 9008693, Fm-3m, No.225). In xCu-yNi/Al2O3 samples, the NiO diffraction peak observed at 37.3° was shifted to lower angles with the decrease in intensity as the Cu content increased (Fig. 1 right). At a high Cu content of x>16, the NiO peak disappeared, indicating that the NiO domains decrease in the size detection limit. In contrast, the CuO diffraction peaks at 35.7 and 38.9° were not shifted even high Ni content at y = 14. Therefore, CuO dissolved in NiO lattice to form a solid solution of CuO-NiO, but NiO did not dissolve in CuO lattice. In the xCu-yNi/Al2O3, it is regarded that two oxide species are formed as CuO-NiO solid solution and pure CuO. A similar solid solution of CuO-NiO is suggested by a recent report on silica-supported Cu-Ni alloy [23]. Table 1 summarizes the average crystallite size of metal oxide calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the major diffraction peak of (111) using Scherrer’s equation. The crystallite size of CuO-NiO solid solution was decreased with increasing Cu content, while that of CuO was unchanged. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of reduced 20Ni/Al2O3, xCu-yNi/Al2O3, and 20Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. No diffraction peaks attributed to metal oxides were observed in the catalyst samples reduced at 300 °C, indicating that metal oxides were successfully reduced under the reduction conditions. However, it should be noted that surface nickel aluminates, which is hard to be reduced and to be visible by XRD, could be formed, which is discussed in connection with TPR results. The diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 43.5, 50.7, and 74.6° were attributed to metal Cu (COD 9011604, Fm-3m, No.225) with miller index of (111), (200), and (220), respectively. The diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 44.6 (111), 52.0 (200), and 76.6 (220) were attributed to metal Ni (COD 9009862, Fm-3m, No.225). The Ni diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 44.6 and 52.0° were shifted to lower angles with the decrease in intensity as Cu content increased in xCu-yNi/Al2O3 (Fig. 2 right). The peak shift was reported on Cu-Ni catalysts with Cu-Ni alloy formation on alumina [24–26]: only the peak assigned to Cu-Ni was observed at Cu content less than 6 wt.% and the peak assigned to Cu was not observed. In the present work, Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts also had Cu-Ni alloy phase, whereas the present xCu-yNi/Al2O3 catalysts at x of 6 and higher showed two diffraction peaks assigned to Cu-Ni alloy and Cu. It is considered that a part of Cu did not dissolve in Ni lattice and formed Cu crystallite. Fig. 3 shows a change in lattice spacing calculated from Ni (111) and Cu (111) peaks in Fig. 2 with Ni content. As Ni content increased, the lattice spacing, d, of Ni (111) in xCu-yNi/Al2O3 decreased linearly from the d value of Cu (111) to that of Ni (111). In contrast, the lattice spacing of Cu (111) in xCu-yNi/Al2O3 catalysts deviated slightly from the lattice spacing of Cu (111) in 20Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates that Cu species dissolved in Ni lattice even after reduction, but Ni hardly dissolved in Cu lattice. Judging from the results in Figs. 1–3 , a solid solution of CuO-NiO leads to form Cu-Ni alloy nanoparticles. Table 1 also summarizes the crystallite size of metals calculated from the FWHM of the (111) diffraction peak. The crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy had a similar trend to the CuO-NiO solid solution, in which the crystallite size is decreased with increasing Cu content, and it was 5.0 nm for 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. This trend is similar to a previous repot on Cu-Ni alloy supported on silica [27]: crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy was decreased with increasing Cu content in Ni-rich region. However, in Cu-rich region on silica [27] and alumina [25] supports, the alloy size is larger than Ni metals on Ni/silica and Ni/alumina. Fig. 4 shows TEM images of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with the distribution of metal particle size. In the 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3, metal particles were dispersed with the particle size in the range of 2.5–15.4 nm (Fig. 4a), which is comparable to the Cu-Ni crystallite size of 5.0 nm estimated by XRD. As 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 has a large Cu crystallite of 29 nm together with Cu-Ni alloy (Table 1), the large particle in the TEM image could be Cu metals. The reduction behavior of precursors of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated by TPR measurement. Fig. 5 shows TPR profiles of 20Ni/Al2O3, xCu-yNi/Al2O3, and 20Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. The TPR profile of 20Cu/Al2O3 catalyst shows two sharp peaks at 180 and 200 °C. The reduction peak at 180 °C was attributed to surface CuO and the reduction peak at 200 °C was attributed to bulk CuO [15]. The TPR profile of 20Ni/Al2O3 catalyst shows a peak at ca. 190 °C and a broad peak between 240 and 800 °C with the peak top of 350 °C. The reduction peak at the low temperature was attributed to the reduction of the surface of NiO and the peak at high temperatures was due to bulk NiO and/or NiO interacted with alumina surface, i.e. nickel aluminate. The stronger the Ni interacts with Al2O3 support, the higher the reduction temperature is. The broad reduction peak is due to the difference in the interaction between Ni species and Al2O3 support [28]. In contrast to the high reduction temperature of 20Ni/Al2O3 at ca. 350 °C, reduction peaks of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts appeared at a low temperature of ca. 250 °C. A peak shift was observed in TPR profiles of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The TPR profile of 2Cu-18Ni/Al2O3 shows three reduction peaks at 200, 210, and 260 °C and a broad reduction peak with a peak top at 420 °C. 4Cu-16Ni/Al2O3, 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3, and 8Cu-12Ni/Al2O3 had two reduction peaks at ca. 190 and 240 °C and a broad peak between 300 and 500 °C with a peak top at 400 °C. In our previous report on Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, Cu species decrease the reduction temperature of NiO species [20]. Furthermore, on Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalysts, Cu species also decreases the reduction temperature of Co3O4 [8]. We had considered that spillover hydrogen from Cu reduced NiO, so that the reduction peak of NiO was shifted to lower temperatures in the previous paper [20]. Although spillover effects have been reported for Cu-Ni alloy catalysts [29–31], the spillover hydrogen is from Ni to Cu. Thus, spillover hydrogen could not cause the lowering the reduction temperature in Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Because Cu and Ni are closely located in the present solid solution of CuO-NiO, the solid solution would lead to form Cu-Ni alloy nanoparticles even at a low temperature at which pure NiO is unreduced. We consider that the solid solution of CuO-NiO is simply reduced by hydrogen at lower temperatures than pure NiO. A broad reduction peak was also observed between 300 and 500 °C in Ni-rich samples (Fig. 5b-e) in a similar way to 20Ni/Al2O3 (Fig. 5a). The broad reduction peak would be due to the reduction of NiO in nickel aluminate. Judging from the TPR analysis, the reduction temperature of 20Cu/Al2O3 and xCu-yNi/Al2O3 catalysts was decided at 300 °C, except for 20Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 400 °C. Fig. 6 shows XRD patterns of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at different temperatures. With increasing the calcination temperature, no shift in the diffraction peak at 2θ = 37.0° was observed where the peak corresponds to NiO-CuO solid solution of (111) face. However, the intensity of diffraction peak at 2θ = 37.0° was increased with increasing the calcination temperature. This suggests that the composition of NiO crystallite in which CuO species dissolved is maintained irrespective of calcination temperature, and that the crystallite size becomes larger with the increase in the calcination temperature. The crystallite size of NiO-CuO solid solution was calculated from the FWHM of the peak at 2θ = 37.0° using Scherrer’s equation to be 7.9, 8.8, 9.0, and 8.3 nm at the calcination temperature of 300, 400, 500 and 600 °C, respectively. Although the crystallite size increased with increasing the calcination temperature, the crystallite size decreased at 600 °C, as confirmed by XRD (Fig. 6d). In the TEM image of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 600 °C (Fig. S1a), particles were dispersed with a particle size of 3.1–18.6 nm. It is possibly caused by the formation of the irreducible compound such as NiAl2O4, although no clear peaks were observed. It is known that the proportion of the surface of the NiAl2O4 phase increases with increasing calcination temperature [32,33]. We confirmed the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel in 20Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 900 °C, but the formation was unclear in 20Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 600 °C (Fig. S2). In the TEM image of 20Ni/Al2O3 reduced at 400 °C (Fig. S1b), Ni particles were dispersed with the particle size of 3.0–23.3 nm. Fig. 7 shows TPR profiles of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at different calcination temperatures. Two reduction peaks at ca. 190 and 240 °C and a broad peak between 300 and 500 °C were observed for 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 300 °C. The peak observed at 190 °C in 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 300 °C shifted to lower temperatures, and the peak observed at 240 °C in 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 300 °C shifted to higher temperatures as the calcination temperature rise. Therefore, the reduction peak observed at below 190 °C would be attributed to CuO or surface NiO in which CuO is dissolved. The peak observed at 260−360 °C in the catalysts calcined at 400 °C and higher would be attributed to the bulk NiO particle in which CuO is dissolved. The reduction peak over 400 °C in all the 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts could be attributed to NiO particles which interact strongly with Al2O3 support to form irreducible compounds NiAl2O4."
7,Vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA over Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA over Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts We adopted high SV conditions to clarify the difference in the catalytic activity among the catalysts. Hydrogenation of LA to GVL was performed over xCu-yNi/Al2O3 (x + y = 20) catalysts at 250 °C for 5 h with a high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 13.2 h−1 except for 20Cu/Al2O3, which was less active even at WHSV of 6.6 h−1. Fig. S3 shows the change in LA conversion and GVL selectivity with TOS. Table 2 summarizes the catalytic reaction results where the LA conversion and the selectivity to each product were averaged between TOS of 1 and 5 h. Over 20Ni/Al2O3, 20Cu/Al2O3, and xCu-yNi/Al2O3 catalysts, the major product is GVL with by-products included α-, β-, and γ-angelicalactones (ALs), 2-butanone, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, and acetone. ALs are produced by dehydrocyclization of LA. C4 and C3 products such as 2-butanone, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, and acetone are formed by CC bond cleavage of LA (Scheme 1 ). In a single Cu catalyst, 20Cu/Al2O3 showed low LA conversion and low GVL selectivity. In a single Ni catalyst, 20Ni/Al2O3 reduced at 300 °C showed low LA conversion with high GVL selectivity, while that reduced at 400 °C showed high LA conversion with low GVL selectivity less than 90 % due to the formation of by-products. In the 20Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, it is confirmed that a high temperature of 400 °C is required to produce a metallic state in TPR measurement, as shown in Fig. 5. The CC bond cleavage takes place by hydrogenolysis over metallic sites. It is well known that hydrogenolysis is more likely over Ni metallic particles than over Cu ones. This can explain the low GVL selectivity of 20Ni/Al2O3. The vapor-phase reaction of LA to GVL proceeds via the following two stepwise reactions; (i) dehydration of LA to ALs and (ii) hydrogenation of ALs to GVL [7,17]. The dehydration of LA to ALs is an equilibrium reaction. In an inert gas of N2 over pure Al2O3 catalyst, vapor-phase dehydration of LA to ALs is hard to proceed due to a small equilibrium constant [7]. In H2 flow, however, high catalytic reactivity of LA to GVL is reported on Al2O3-support metal catalysts [8,22]. We consider that catalysts with high hydrogenation ability promote the second-step hydrogenation of ALs to GVL, and that the formation of GVL reduces the concentration of ALs to promote the first-step dehydration of LA to ALs. The low catalytic activity of 20Cu/Al2O3 (Table 2) could be caused by its low hydrogenation ability. Since the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst has high hydrogenation ability, it shows the high conversion of LA to produce GVL (Table 2). Compared to single metal catalysts such as 20Cu/Al2O3 and 20Ni/Al2O3, Ni-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts such as 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3, 8Cu-12Ni/Al2O3, and 10Cu-10Ni/Al2O3 showed high catalytic activity and high GVL selectivity. The major product was GVL with small amounts of by-products. The catalytic conversion slightly decreased, but higher than 90 % was kept under high SV conditions in the initial 5 h (Fig. S3). Under severe conditions, 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 showed the highest GVL yield in Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The improvement of catalytic activity on Ni-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 was due to the formation of Cu-Ni alloy (Fig. 3) and the decrease in the reduction temperature (Fig. 5). Since the Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were reduced at 300 °C, which was lower than that of 20Ni/Al2O3, the low reduction temperature would prevent the metal particles from sintering. Therefore, Ni-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts indicate high LA conversion and high GVL selectivity. However, catalyst deactivation was observed over Cu-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. S3): steep deactivation occurred at high Cu contents. Because ALs were observed over 20Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (Table 2), it is reasonable that the hydrogenation ability of Cu metal is lower than Ni metal. Since ALs can be readily oligomerized to form coke deposition, the deactivation observed in Cu-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts would be caused by ALs due to the low hydrogenation ability of Cu metal. Improvement of catalytic activity by Cu-Ni alloy has reported in some reactions over Al2O3-supported catalysts: CuNi nanoalloy is active for the partial oxidation of methane [24], Cu-rich Cu4Ni alloy is active for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural [30], and Ni-rich CuNi2 alloy is active and selective for the liquid-phase hydrogenolysis of oleic acid to heptadecane using methanol as a hydrogen carrier [26]. To investigate the effect of calcination temperature, 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were calcined at different temperatures as 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C. Table 3 summarizes averaged initial catalytic activities in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA at 250 °C and WHSV =13.2 h−1. Fig. S4 shows changes in LA conversion and GVL selectivity with TOS. The GVL selectivity increased with increasing calcination temperature up to 500 °C, but LA conversion decreased. As discussed in Section 3.1, CuO is partially dissolved in NiO particles, and the crystallite size was increased with rising the calcination temperature. Therefore, the decrease in conversion is due to sintering of CuNi alloy species with decreasing active metal surface. The optimal calcination temperature of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 in this reaction was determined to be 300 °C. To investigate the effect of reduction temperature, 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 500 and 600 °C were reduced at a temperature between 300 and 500 °C. Table 3 summarizes the averaged initial catalytic activities in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA over 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts reduced at different temperatures. Fig. S5 shows changes in LA conversion and GVL selectivity with TOS. The LA conversion of the catalysts calcined at 500 °C slightly decreased with increasing reduction temperature. The conversion of the catalysts calcined at 600 °C is relatively lower than those of the catalysts calcined at 300−500 °C irrespective of reduction temperature (Table 3). Although high reduction temperatures promote the reduction of metal oxides that are difficult to reduce at low temperatures, the reduced metal particles agglomerate simultaneously. In the TPR analysis of Fig. 5, a reduction peak was observed even at 750 °C for the catalyst calcined at 600 °C. We consider that the low conversion of the catalyst calcined at 600 °C is caused by aggregating Ni species and forming irreducible Ni species. Besides, we investigated the effect of reaction temperature in the reaction over 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 calcined at 300 °C. Table 4 summarizes the results in the temperature range between 250 and 300 °C. In the temperature range, the conversion was gradually decreased from 100 % at TOS of 1 h, as shown in Fig. S3c. Because the catalyst was deactivated under the conditions, the average conversion was less than 100 % (Table 4). At a reaction temperature of 260 °C, the GVL selectivity was the highest. At 250 °C, no C3 and C4 by-products such as acetone, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, and 2-butanone were observed via hydrogenolysis with CC bond cleavage. At 260 °C and higher, the GVL selectivity decreased with raising the temperature. The by-products with CC bond cleavage increased with raising the temperature, indicating that the hydrogenolysis ability of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is dependent on the temperature. Therefore, in a point of high GVL selectivity, the reaction should be practically operated at an optimum reaction temperature of 260 °C or lower."
8,Stability of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in a long-run reaction,"3.3 Stability of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in a long-run reaction We have used a GVL productivity (kg kgcat −1 h−1) as an indicator of the catalyst performance [8,21]. The productivity directly depends on the flow conditions such as WHSV: high productivity needs high WHSV conditions, but it induces deactivation of the catalyst. Thus, we adopted high WHSV conditions depending on the activity of catalysts to evaluate the catalyst performance. At a high WHSV of 13.2 h−1, the GVL productivity achieved 11.0 kg kgcat −1 h−1 at a TOS of 8 h (Fig. S6), whereas the LA conversion was decreased from 99.4 to 95.6% in the initial 8 h. To investigate the stability of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, we performed long-run reactions for 20Ni/Al2O3 and 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts at a lower WHSV of 6.60 h−1, which is the same as those reported in our previous work [8,21]. Fig. 8 shows changes in LA conversion and GVL selectivity with TOS. 20Ni/Al2O3 showed a high LA conversion with a gradual decrease from a TOS of 20 h and then the LA conversion decreased to 57.9 % during 41 h, while the GVL selectivity was gradually increased from 73 to 93 % (Fig. 8b). 20Cu/Al2O3 is less active than 20Ni/Al2O3 (Fig. 8c). In 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3, the conversion of LA was maintained over 90 % during 67 h, and then the conversion of LA decreased to 72.5 % during 94 h (Fig. 8a). The GVL selectivity was maintained over 95 % during 94 h. In our previous report, the conversion of LA decreased from 99.5 to 70.2% over Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalyst during 24 h [20]. In our previous reports [20,21], no Cu-Ni alloy had been observed on Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, but the alloy formation was overlooked: Cu-Ni alloy at 2θ = 44.2° was confirmed on SiO2 support, as shown in Fig. S7 [20]. The crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy and Cu metal on silica was 13 and 39 nm, respectively (Table 1), while the metal particle size in the TEM image was in the range of 20−50 nm [21]. Thus, the crystallite size is a significant difference between Al2O3- and SiO2-supported catalysts: crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy on Al2O3 is much smaller than that on SiO2. In addition, over another 6Cu-14Ni/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the wetness impregnation using citric acid as an organic additive, the conversion of LA decreased from 99.8 to 71.9% during 65 h [21]. Thus, the 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was the most active among the catalysts. We have previously summarized the productivity of GVL of non-noble metal catalysts [8]. Bimetallic Ni-Cu catalysts showed higher GVL productivity than single metal catalysts. A selective Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst has recently been prepared by the co-precipitation method [22]: Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with 22 wt.% Cu and 44 wt.% Ni shows a high GVL selectivity of 99.9 % with a GVL productivity of 1.68 kg kgcat –1 h–1 at a TOS of 20 h using 10 wt.% LA aqueous solution at 275 °C. Unfortunately, the catalyst is deactivated under higher SV conditions even in diluent water: the GVL selectivity decreases with increasing WHSV. The XRD patterns of the co-precipitated Cu-Ni/Al2O3 indicate that Cu and Ni exist as a mixture of single metals, but not Cu-Ni alloy. In our previous reports, 6Cu-14Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows a high productivity of 3.90 kg kgcat −1 h−1 at a TOS of 24 h without using diluent water [21]. A high productivity of 5.46 kg kgcat −1 h−1 has been achieved over 8Cu-12Co/Al2O3 catalyst at a TOS of 24 h, whereas it steeply decreases to 0.56 kg kgcat −1 h−1 at a TOS of 36 h [8]. In this study, a high productivity of 5.53, 5.30, and 3.75 kg kgcat −1 h−1 was obtained over 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with high GVL selectivity over 98 % at a TOS of 24, 50, and 94 h, respectively (Table S1). As far as we know, the present 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst achieved the highest GVL productivity of 11.0 kg kgcat −1 h−1 at a TOS of 8 h in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA to GVL."
9,Cause of catalyst deactivation,"3.4 Cause of catalyst deactivation To clarify the cause of the catalyst deactivation, we performed several analyses of used catalysts such as TG, TPR, and XRD measurement. Fig. S8 shows TG profile of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts which were used in the catalytic reaction. In the freshly reduced catalyst, because TG curve increased weight due to the oxidation of reduced metals, an increase in weight from 190 to 310 °C was attributed to oxidation of reduced metals supported on Al2O3. In the used catalyst, the decrease in weight from 160 to 290 °C was observed, indicating that coke was deposited on the catalyst in the initial 1 h of the reaction. In the TG analyses of the catalysts used in the reaction for 1 and 94 h, the coke amount was estimated to be 5.7 and 5.4 wt.%, respectively. The coke deposition proceeds in the early stage of the reaction, and it would be due to the polymerization of ALs [7]. Thus, the coke deposition is not the main cause of the long-range catalyst deactivation. Besides, the deposited carbon must cover the acid sites of alumina. Because the esterification of levulinic acid to angelicalactone actually proceeds over pure silica with weak acidity [7], we consider that the esterification could proceed either over the alumina with carbon deposition, which weakens the acid strength, or over residual acid sites after carbon deposition. Fig. 9 shows TPR profiles of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts used in the reaction for 1 and 94 h as well as the freshly reduced catalyst. The freshly reduced catalyst had a reduction peak between 100 and 200 °C and between 200 and 500 °C even after reduction: the catalyst was oxidized even after the reduction because the catalyst was exposed in air during transportation. In addition, the freshly reduced catalyst had a reduction peak at around 400 °C because 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were reduced at 300 °C: a part of metal oxides was unreduced under the reduction conditions at 300 °C. Both the catalysts used in the reaction for 1 and 94 h had two reduction peaks between 100 and 200 °C and between 250 and 550 °C (Fig. 9c and d). The reduction peak at 400 °C was clearly enlarged in the used catalysts compared with the freshly reduced one. The reduction peaks in the 94-h-used catalyst became larger than those of the 1-h-used one. The difference in the TPR peak area between the 1-h-used and the 94-h-used catalysts indicates that metal species in the catalyst may be oxidized during the reaction. Instead, there is a possibility that the reduction peak at high temperatures between 250 and 550 °C is attributed to the hydrogen consumption in TPR raised from the hydrogenation of deposited carbon species. Also, the reduction peaks at 100 and 200 °C may be due to reoxidation of the nanoparticles with size lower than 4 nm, which occurs when the used catalyst is removed from the reactor. To confirm the origin of the reduction peak of the used samples, TPR measurement was performed after the used sample was reduced at 500 °C for 1 h (Fig. 9e and f). The reduction peak at 250−550 °C in the used ones almost disappeared, and a peak at 550 °C appeared. The latter peak could be attributed to nickel aluminate. Thus, the reduction peak at high temperatures between 250 and 550 °C in Fig. 9c and d is probably attributed to oxidation of surface metals. We consider that the reoxidation followed by the re-reduction would be the driving force of sintering of metal particles. To confirm the oxidation, the reduction of the used catalyst was performed: the catalytic activity of the catalyst used in the reaction for 5 h was recovered only in a short time after the reduction in H2 at 300 °C for 1 h, while it decreased with TOS in the same way as the fresh one (Fig. S9). Thus, the short-range deactivation would be caused by the oxidation of the surface, which could be oxidized by H2O produced in the reaction. However, no diffraction of oxide species of Cu-Ni alloy was observed in the 94-h-used catalyst (Fig. 10 c). To elucidate the cause of the long-range deactivation, exposure of the reduced catalyst to H2O vapor was performed. The LA conversion in the catalyst reduced at 300 °C followed by the exposure to H2O vapor at 250 °C for 1 h prior to the reaction was lower than that of the fresh one (Fig. S6b). Further decrease in the LA conversion was observed after the exposure to H2O vapor for 12 h (Fig. S6c). These results surely suggest that water vapor, even in H2 flow, acts as a promoter of sintering of metal particles through the redox cycle of oxidation by H2O and reduction by H2. Fig. 10 shows XRD patterns of 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalysts used in the reactions under different conditions. As discussed in Section 3.1, the diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 44.1 and 51.4° are attributed from Cu-Ni alloy, while Ni (111) and Ni (200) faces are located at 2θ = 44.6 and 52.0°, respectively. The XRD pattern of the 1-h-used catalyst (Fig. 10b), which is quite similar to that of the freshly reduced catalyst (Fig. 10a), indicates that the catalyst has small Ni-Cu alloy particles together with Cu particles. However, the intensity of the diffraction peak of Cu-Ni alloy increased after the 94-h run in the XRD pattern (Fig. 10c). It indicates that Ni-Cu alloy aggregates during the catalytic reaction. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.1 and 51.4° were not shifted even after the 94-h-run, indicating that Cu is still dissolved in Ni metals to maintain the Cu-Ni alloy nanoparticles during the reaction. Small diffraction peaks assigned to Cu metal were observed in the catalyst samples. In addition, the exposure of the freshly reduced catalyst to water vapor affected the crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy (Fig. 10d and e): the XRD patterns of the water vapor-exposed samples are quite similar to that of the 94-h-used catalyst. In the 94-h-used 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the metal particle size observed by TEM analysis was in a range of 5.7–21.9 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b, while the metal particle size of the fresh catalyst was in a range of 2.5–15.4 nm (Fig. 4a). The increase in metal particle size during the reaction for 94 h is consistent with XRD results (Fig. 10a and c), which indicates the crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy of 8.4 nm. Because the size of fresh one is 4.9 nm, the cause of the long-range catalyst deactivation would be due to the sintering of supported metals induced by the cycle of oxidation with H2O and reduction with H2, while there is still a possibility to form irreducible surface aluminates. Because water is produced in the esterification of LA to ALs, it is inevitable that the catalyst is deactivated in the vapor phase even in H2 atmosphere at 250 °C. In addition, this suggests a serious problem that water as a diluent of LA could accelerate the deactivation of the catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"Vapor-phase hydrogenation of LA to GVL over Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts was investigated in an H2 flow at ambient pressure at 250 °C. Ni-rich Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts achieved high LA conversion and high GVL selectivity. XRD analyses of the reduced catalysts show that a solid solution of CuO-NiO was formed on the alumina support, and that Cu-Ni metals supported on alumina were composed of Cu-Ni alloy. Both calcination and reduction temperatures of the precursors of catalysts significantly affect the catalytic activity of the resulted Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. TPR profiles show that the addition of Cu in Ni/Al2O3 decreases the reduction temperature of Cu-Ni/Al2O3. The CuO-NiO solid solution would probably be reduced at lower temperature than Ni/Al2O3 to produce active Cu-Ni alloy species. The crystallite size of the Cu-Ni alloy showed a significant difference between the Al2O3 support and silica one: crystallite size of Cu-Ni alloy of Cu-Ni/Al2O3 was much smaller than that of Cu-Ni/SiO2. 6Cu-14Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest GVL productivity of 11.0 kg kgcat −1 h−1 with the selectivity of 98.6 % at 250 °C at a TOS of 8 h and a high WHSV of 13.2 h−1. Also, it showed long-range stability with a high productivity of 5.30 kg kgcat −1 h−1 at a TOS of 50 h and a WHSV of 6.60 h−1 without using water diluent. Characterization of the used catalysts elucidated that the catalyst deactivation would proceed through the sintering of Cu-Ni alloy nanoparticles induced by the cycle of oxidation with H2O and reduction with H2, but not through the carbon accumulation: the major carbon accumulation proceeded in the initial 1 h of the reaction."
