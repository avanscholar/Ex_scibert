0,Introduction,"Biomass is a renewable and sustainable non-fossil fuel-based carbon source that can be used to produce fine chemicals and liquid biofuels, which can be alternatives to existing fossil fuel-based chemicals and fuels [1–4]. Furfural (FF, C5H4O2), obtained by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and dehydration of hemicellulose [1–4], is widely considered a biomass-derived platform chemical that can produce biofuels and various fine chemicals [1–4]. Of particular interest, FF can produce furfuryl alcohol (FA, C5H6O2), an adhesive intermediate, and/or 2-methyl furan (MF, C5H6O), a promising biofuel candidate [1–4]. MF is considered a promising biofuel candidate due to its high energy density, low solubility in water and biomass source [4–6]. The energy density (lower heating value) of MF is 28.5 MJ/l, which is 40% higher than bioethanol (21.3 MJ/l), and competitive with gasoline (32.9 MJ/l) [5]. The water solubility (7.0 g/l) is very low, avoiding water contamination commonly attributed with bioethanol [6]. Also, MF can be from non-edible parts of biomass, hemicellulose, while bioethanol is generally from the edible part of biomass, starch [2,6]. Thermal catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (CH) of FF to produce FA and MF has been widely investigated. However, CH necessitates a large amount of externally supplied H2 gas at high pressure and temperature. In the CH gas-phase reaction of FF, the H2/FF ratio for FA production was between 2 and 5, while the H2/FF ratio for MF production was in the range of 5–25 at high temperature and pressure [1]. In contrast, electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) does not require externally supplied H2 gas, high pressure or temperature, because ECH works at ambient conditions in an aqueous solution. In addition, ECH of FF can be utilized to produce biofuels and fine chemicals using electricity generated from renewable energy during off-peak time. These advantages have led to recent studies for ECH of biomass-derived chemicals [7–10]. Early reports on ECH of FF utilized a variety of reaction conditions and electrode materials, making understanding the impact of reaction conditions difficult to discern. Our first investigations of ECH of FF sought to systematically identify the relationship between reaction conditions, resulting products and reaction efficiencies on Cu foil electrodes [11,12]. MF has been reported as a significant product only in highly acidic solutions (pH ≤ 1) [11–15], and the highest selectivity towards MF (>40%) was reported by the Schröder [13], Li [14], and our [11,12] groups on a Cu metal foil. While in solutions with higher pH (>1), FA was mainly produced in significant quantities on Cu [7,12,14] and other electrodes [7]. The reaction pathway for ECH of FF is shown in Scheme 1 -a. Both direct and indirect reaction pathways for the production of MF are included, with the direct path recently being identified as probable experimentally on Cu [11,14] and computationally on other metals [16]. Acidic electrolytes have been required to promote significant MF production during ECH of FF on Cu; however, concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) consumes electrons and decreases faradaic efficiency at these conditions [11,14,17] (Scheme 1-b). Faradaic efficiency (also known as electrochemical efficiency) accounts for the number of electrons used for the desired reactions per total number of electrons applied to the entire process. High FE for ECH of FF is required for the efficient electrochemical reaction, avoiding electrons being used for side reactions such as HER. In both ECH and HER, the Volmer reaction produces chemisorbed hydrogen (Had) on the surface of electrode (M) in acidic electrolyte (Eq. (1)). (1) Volmer: H3O+ + e− + M → (Had)M + H2O The Heyrovsky (Eq. (2)) and Tafel (Eq. (3)) reactions further result in HER that consumes electrons or utilizes the Had, decreasing the FE towards ECH. (2) Heyrovsky: H3O+ + e− + (Had)M → H2 + H2O + M (3) Tafel: 2(Had)M → H2 + 2 M In this regard, the use of Had for either ECH of FF or HER dictates the FE for ECH of FF. Also, the preference between ECH of FF and HER significantly depends on the reaction potential. Thermodynamically, ECH of FF is favored over HER. The standard redox potential for HER is 0.0 V (vs RHE) at pH 0, but the standard redox potentials for ECH of FF to FA and ECH of FF to MF are +0.19 V [7,18] and +0.31 V, respectively. However, the onset potentials for both ECH of FF and HER have been ∼−0.4 to −0.5 V [11,13,14] in 0.5 M H2SO4 over Cu, with potentials slightly above onset being identified as favorable for the production of MF [11–14]. In previous reports by Li and our group, the relationship between potential and FE for ECH of FF in 0.5 M H2SO4 on Cu have been studied [11,14]. Applied potentials between −0.45 to −0.65 V for ECH of FF were required for ECH of FF to be dominant over HER [11,14]. As the magnitude of applied potential further increased the FE for ECH of FF decreased [11,14]. While ECH of FF is favored at near onset potentials over HER, the slow reaction rate (i.e. low current densities) is still challenging on a bare Cu metal electrodes at the low applied potentials. The above-mentioned investigations of ECH of FF have focused on understanding reaction conditions and observing the products. The catalyst has not been of significant focus beyond what metal is being used, with the investigations being performed over metal foils or carbon paper generally [11–15,19,20]. Pt/C [18], Pd/C [18], Pt/activated carbon fibers [21] and La doped TiO2 film [22] have also been investigated as catalysts in select publications. In this study, we synthesized microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Cu electrocatalysts with increased electrochemical roughnesses and surface area compared to bare Cu foil by electrodeposition on a Cu substrate (Cu/Cu). We investigated the production rate and FE for ECH of FF on Cu/Cu electrocatalysts in comparison to bare Cu. This is the first report of on Cu electrocatalysts beyond Cu foil used for ECH of FF to the best of our best knowledge. Cu/Cu electrocatalysts improved the production rate during ECH of FF, maintaining low FE for HER at the same time. We showed 2.4 times higher production rate of FA + MF on the 3-D structured nanocrystalline Cu catalyst compared to bare Cu, while maintaining >94% FE for ECH of FF at −0.5 V. The production rate of MF also more than doubled on the 3-D structured nanocrystalline Cu catalyst compared to bare Cu at more negative potentials (−0.65 and −0.8 V), however at a cost of lower FE towards ECH. The deactivation of ECH of FF was lessened on the nanocrystalline Cu electrocatalyst at −0.5 V compared to Cu bare."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (FF; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), furfuryl alcohol (FA; 98%, Acros Organics), 2-methyl furan (MF; 99%, 0.024% BHT contained as stabilizer, Aldrich), sulfuric acid (H2SO4; trace metal grade, Fisher Scientific), hydrochloric acid (HCl; 37.5 w/w%, Certified ACS Plus, Fisher Scientific), acetone (optima grade, Fisher Scientific), acetonitrile (optima grade, Fisher Scientific), phosphoric acid (ACS certified grade, 85%, Fisher Scientific), chloroform (HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific), sodium chloride (NaCl; Certified ACS grade, Fisher Scientific), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, certified ACS grade, Fisher Scientific) and copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O; 99+%, Acros Organics) were used as received. DI water (resistivity ≥ 18.2 MΩ) was used from a Millipore water purification system. Cu foil (99.999%, 0.1 mm thickness, Alfa Aesar) and Cu wire (99.999%, d = 0.5 mm, Alfa Aesar) were used to make working electrode flags (2 cm × 1.5 cm). The Pt counter electrode (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) was prepared with Pt mesh gauze (99.9%, 0.1 mm thickness and 52 mesh woven, Alfa Aesar) and Pt wire (99.95%, d = 0.5 mm, Alfa Aesar). A silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl) electrode (MR-5275, BASi) was used as the reference electrode."
3,Cu electrodes preparation,"2.2 Cu electrodes preparation Electrodeposition of Cu on Cu foil flags was performed to synthesize higher electrochemical roughness Cu electrocatalysts, following our previous work [23]. The Cu flag substrate was cleaned before Cu electrodeposition by mechanical and electrochemical means. Mechanical polishing was performed by sonication for 10 min in the presence of 0.3 μm alumina suspension in DI water, followed by 10 min sonication with 0.05 μm alumina suspension in DI water. Chemical treatment involved 10 min sonication in acetone and 1 min immersion in 2v/v% HCl without sonication. DI water washing was used to clean the electrode between each step. For electrodeposition experiments, a single-compartment batch cell with 200 ml of 0.5 M CuSO4·5H2O was used. The Cu metal substrate (2 cm × 1.5 cm) and a 10 times larger size Cu flag was used as a cathode and an anode, respectively, spaced 0.5 cm from each other. After 30 min purging of the working solution with N2 gas (5.0 ultra high purity, Praxair), the electrodeposition of Cu on Cu was conducted at −1.0 and −2.0 V cell potential, depending upon the catalyst synthesized. Both sides of the Cu cathode were electrodeposited with Cu with 10.83C/cm2 charge transferred per side. The control bare Cu electrode was electropolished before use as an electrocatalyst. Electropolishing of a Cu flag was performed with a Pt counter electrode for 120 s for each side of the Cu electrode at a constant cell potential of 1.8 V in 0.1 M phosphoric acid solution. The electropolished Cu was further treated by 10 min sonication in acetone and washing with DI water to clean the surface of Cu, followed by immersion in 10 v/v% HCl in water for 1 min and DI water washing to remove any oxide layers."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization The surface morphology of bare copper and electrochemically deposited Cu on Cu were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Supra-55, Zeiss) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used for elemental analysis on the surface of the electrodes. EDS data were collected using the Oxford EDS detector on the field emission SEM (FESEM; Helios NanoLab 660, FEI) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’Pert Pro, PANalytical) was used to confirm the crystal orientations of electrocatalysts. XRD measurements were performed with CuK α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA and scanned 2θ region from 30 to 100°."
5,Electrochemical roughness of Cu electrodes,"2.4 Electrochemical roughness of Cu electrodes The double layer capacitance of electrocatalysts was measured for the evaluation of the electrochemical roughness using cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. A two-compartment H-type gas-tight cell separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion-117) was used for the CV experiments. A 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the both catholyte and anolyte. The catholyte solution was purged with N2 gas and vigorously stirred using a magnetic stirrer at least 30 min prior to the CV experiments. Electropolished bare Cu and electrochemically deposited Cu on Cu were used as working electrodes. Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The non-Faradaic potential range for CV experiments between 0.1 and 0.15 V (vs Ag/AgCl), where no reactions occur, was used for the double layer capacitance test. The scan rate was set at 80, 100, 120 and 150 mV/s."
6,ECH of FF on Cu catalysts,"2.5 ECH of FF on Cu catalysts A two-compartment gas tight H-type cell was used for ECH of FF. 100 mM FF in 0.5 M H2SO4 with water/acetontrile (4/1 by volume) co-solvent was prepared as a catholyte. 0.5 M H2SO4 in DI water was used as an anolyte. The catholyte and anolyte were separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117), and the volume of both catholyte and anolyte in each chamber was 30 ml. Working and reference electrodes were immersed in the catholyte, and counter electrode was immersed in the anolyte. The catholyte compartment was connected to a solvent cold trap, filled with 60 ml acetonitrile and held in ice/salt bath (< -15 °C) to capture MF evaporated from the catholyte during ECH of FF. The solvent trap was then connected to micro-gas chromatography (micro-GC; Fusion, Inficon) to analyze hydrogen gas evolved during ECH of FF. The catholyte was nitrogen or argon purged for more than 15 min prior to ECH of FF. The purging gas was continuously flowed through the catholyte into the micro-GC until the end of reaction. Before the reusability test, the used Cu catalysts were rinsed with acetone, and the used electrolyte was replaced with fresh. All the collected data versus Ag/AgCl was converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)."
7,Analysis of liquid products,"2.6 Analysis of liquid products For liquid products analysis, a 0.25 ml aliquot from the catholyte and 0.5 ml aliquot from the solvent trap were sampled and analyzed. To be able to analyze aliquots including electrolyte and water, samples from the catholyte were mixed with 2 ml chloroform and 50 mg sodium chloride. This caused phase separation in which the organic layer was extracted and further dried using sodium sulfate. The aliquot from the solvent trap was diluted 10 times with acetonitrile before analysis. Both aliquots were analyzed on a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC/MS; QP-2010 Ultra, Shimadzu) using a TR-WaxMS column (ℓ = 30 m, d = 0.25 mm, thickness = 0.25 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) from 40 °C to 250 °C (ramp rate: 5 °C/min). The identification of liquid products was conducted by comparison of collected MS data and NIST library. Quantifications were conducted by using external calibration curve of standard FF, FA and MF solutions in acetonitrile or/and chloroform."
8,Analysis of hydrogen gas generation,2.7 Analysis of hydrogen gas generation The H2 gas evolved during ECH of FF was quantitatively analyzed by using a micro-GC with a thermal conductivity detector equipped with a Rt-Q-Bond 0.25 mm column. Ar gas was flowed through the catholyte during ECH of FF to carry H2 generated into the micro-GC. Quantitative result for H2 generation was calculated using a calibration curve made with 4.17 v/v% of H2/Ar (Praxair). The detailed calculation procedure was described in the previous report [11].
9,Calculations,"2.8 Calculations The conversion and selectivity were calculated based on the following equations: (4) FF conversion (%) = (mole of FF consumed)/(mole of initial FF) × 100% (5) Selectivity (%) = (mole of product formed)/(mole of FF consumed) × 100% The number of electrons transferred was calculated based on Faraday’s law of electrochemistry: (6) Q = z n F Here, Q is the total charge passed in the circuit to convert n moles of a reactant to products by a reaction including z electrons per molecule of the reactant, and F is Faraday constant, F = 96485 C/mol. From the Faraday’s law, the modified equation for the calculation of faradaic efficiency (FE) was: (7) F E f o r P r o d u c t s % = n m m o l × 96485 C m o l × z ∫ I d t ( m A * s ) × 100 Here, I is the current at specific reaction time, and the denominator indicates total charge passed to the system."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterization of Cu electrocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Cu electrocatalysts Electropolished bare Cu and electrodeposited Cu particles on Cu substrate (Cu/Cu) were characterized by SEM, XRD and capacitance measurements. SEM images showed that the electrochemically and chemically polished Cu foil had a clean and smooth surface (Fig. 1 -a). Electropolished Cu will be denoted as a bare Cu. The electrodeposited Cu had microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Cu supported on the Cu substrate. When the magnitude of the cell potential for electrodeposition was increased, the electrodeposited Cu particle size decreased. At −1.0 V cell potential for electrodeposition, 4 μm-sized Cu particles were densely deposited on the Cu substrate (Cu/Cu-4 μm, Fig. 1-b). At −2.0 V electrodeposition, 400 nm nanocrystalline Cu particles were densely deposited on the Cu substrate (Cu/Cu-400 nm), showing projected areas, composed of agglomerated nanocrystalline Cu particles (Fig. 1-c). The morphology of Cu catalysts and structures on Cu substrate contributed to the increase of electrochemical surface area of the electrode. In order to compare the electrochemically active Cu area after electrodeposition, the electrochemical roughness factor was calculated in comparison with that of the bare Cu electrode. The electrochemical roughness factor describes the ratio of double layer capacitance between the sample electrode and standard electrode, where the bare Cu was used as the standard basis. The double layer capacitance was measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Higher electrochemical roughness factors are generally perceived to have larger electrochemical areas for reaction [23–25]. Table 1 summarizes the double layer capacitance and electrochemical roughness factor of Cu electrocatalysts. Supplementary data (Figs. S1 and S2) provides the detailed information for the CV measurement and capacitance calculation. The average values of electrochemical roughness of microcrystalline Cu supported on Cu (Cu/Cu-4 μm) and nanocrystalline Cu on Cu (Cu/Cu-400 nm) were 2.5 and 7.3, respectively. Since the electrochemical roughness of Cu/Cu catalysts was greater than 1, Cu/Cu electrodes have more electrochemically active surface area than bare Cu. As described from SEM results, the 4 μm Cu particles on the dense Cu layer seemed to improve the Cu surface area (Fig. 1-b). Higher roughness on Cu/Cu-400 nm was expected from SEM analysis as well, due to the 3-D structure of the particles on the surface (Fig. 1-c). Crystal orientation of the electrodeposited Cu catalysts and bare Cu was examined with XRD (Fig. 2 ). All three electrocatalysts showed only Cu metallic peaks; Cu peaks were identified with the JCPDS library (card number: 00-004-0836). On Cu bare, only the 50.4° peak attributed to the Cu (200) was observed. This was also the highest intensity among the electrodeposited catalysts. On the Cu/Cu catalysts, in addition to the Cu (200), less intense peaks were observed for Cu (111) at 43.3°, Cu (220) at 74.0 and Cu (311) at 89.9°, irrespective of the deposition potential. The only differences observed between the Cu/Cu catalysts were the intensity ratios between (200) and the other peaks. The Pourbaix diagram, which describes thermodynamically-stable Cu states (metal, oxide and ion) depending on applied potential and pH, confirms that Cu metal should exist and not copper oxides, at the pH and potential ranges of our experiment [26]. This, combined with the XRD results, suggests that only metallic Cu was involved in the ECH of FF."
12,ECH of FF on Cu based electrocatalysts,"3.2 ECH of FF on Cu based electrocatalysts ECH of FF and HER was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3). The onset potential for ECH of FF and/or HER with 100 mM FF solution and HER in FF free solution was in the range of -0.37 to -0.40 V vs RHE on bare Cu and Cu/Cu electrocatalysts (Fig. S3). At more negative potentials (as the magnitude of potential increased), the current density for the CVs trended with roughness factor. Normalization by roughness factor over-adjusted current density where the Cu/Cu-400 nm had much lower normalized currents (current per roughness factor). This suggested that roughness factor was not an absolute measure of electrochemically active surface area or that more than surface area was impacting the reactions. Using traditional CV methods, ECH and HER reactions cannot be distinguished, therefore further analysis of the reactions and products is necessary beyond CV. The effects of Cu electrocatalysts on ECH of FF were studied at different applied potentials from near the onset potential (-0.5 V vs RHE) to far beyond onset potentials (-0.8 V) at 0.15 V intervals. A solution of 100 mM FF in 0.5 M H2SO4 in water/acetonitrile co-solvent (4/1 by volume) was used as a catholyte, and the reaction time was for 1.5 h. We previously reported the conversion of FF, production rate and faradaic efficiency (FE) for ECH and HER over a bare Cu electrode in this range of applied potentials [11]. To directly compare the catalytic activity of electrodeposited Cu catalysts with the bare Cu electrode, the same reaction conditions were used. Fig. 3 shows the conversion of FF (XFF), FE and production rate for ECH (FA + MF) and HER (H2) after 1.5 h of reaction at −0.5 V, −0.65 V and −0.8 V. Comparing Cu/Cu-400 nm to bare Cu at −0.5 V, the production rates of FA and MF combined and H2 were 2.4 and 4 times higher, respectively (Fig. 3-a). FE for ECH of FF (FA + MF) was higher than 94.6% on both Cu/Cu-400 nm and bare Cu catalysts. HER on both bare Cu and Cu/Cu-400 nm catalysts was minimal, with FE for H2 on both catalysts less than 3.5%. Although the electrochemical roughness for Cu/Cu-400 nm was 7.3, the production rate for ECH and HER on Cu/Cu-400 nm was 2.4 and 4 times higher than bare Cu, respectively. This may be due to one or more reasons including mass transfer limitation of FF to the electrode, interaction between FF and surface of electrode, changes in active site density, among others. The additional factors influencing activity and selectivity will require further studies beyond the scope of this work. The higher roughness Cu/Cu-400 nm showed two to three times higher current density at -0.5 V (Fig. S4) compared to bare Cu over the duration of the 1.5 h experiment. This higher current was attributed to a significant increase in production rate for ECH of FF and HER compared to bare Cu at −0.5 V. In contrast to the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst, Cu/Cu-4 μm did not significantly improve the production rate for FA and MF, while the production rate for H2 more than doubled. We believe that the increased current density on Cu/Cu-4 μm was from a combination of HER and homogenous side reactions that consumed some of the FA and/or MF that had been formed electrochemically. 10% of the increased current density on Cu/Cu-4 μm, compared to bare Cu, was used for extra hydrogen production. The remaining additional current density observed was likely for MF and FA that was further reacted into high molecular weight products that were not detected by GC/MS or micro-GC. The side reactions will be further discussed in a later section of this report. In order to investigate the factor that improved the reaction activity for the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst, we synthesized another 2-D structured nanocrystalline Cu (Cu/Cu-100 nm) catalyst that had similar roughness with Cu/Cu-4 μm (2.5), but smaller Cu particles (100 nm) (Fig. S5). The particles on the Cu/Cu-100 nm were distributed on the surface in a 2-D manner similar to the Cu/Cu-4 μm particles, rather than the 3-D manner that the Cu/Cu-400 nm particles were distributed. This is likely why the electrochemical roughness was similar to the Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst and not the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst. The production rate for FA + MF and conversion of FF on Cu/Cu-100 nm was consistent with Cu/Cu-4 μm at −0.5 and −0.65 V (Table S1). While the Cu particle sizes were dramatically different between Cu/Cu-4 μm and Cu/Cu-100 nm, they also had a similar current density profile during ECH of FF (Fig. S4). The similar product distribution and current densities suggests that the smaller particle size of Cu itself may not impact to the conversion of FF and production rate for the catalysts studied. The heterogeneous shapes of the Cu particles on Cu/Cu-4 μm, Cu/Cu-400 nm and Cu/Cu-100 nm make any correlations between particle shape and production rate difficult. For the catalysts studied here, the improvement of reaction activity seemed to be due to roughness, and likely not crystal orientation or particle size. Further investigations on well-controlled shapes and sizes would need to be performed to make clear conclusions regarding the impact of particle shape and size. At −0.65 V (Fig. 3-b), Cu/Cu-400 nm still increased the production rate for FA + MF, more than doubling that of bare Cu at the same potential. ECH of FF was dominant over HER on all the Cu catalysts, but the FE and production rate for HER significantly increased on the electrodeposited Cu catalysts in comparison to Cu bare. FE for HER was less than 2% on a bare Cu, while it was 15.3% on Cu/Cu-400 nm and 10.3% on Cu/Cu-4 μm. The Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst increased the production rate of MF by 21.2% and the production rate of FA by 20.8%, compared to bare Cu. However, the production rate for MF and FA on Cu/Cu-4 μm was within one standard deviation of that on bare Cu, preventing clear conclusions from being made between the production rates of ECH for the two catalysts at this potential. Significant changes in HER production rate and FE were observed on the Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst; more than 6 times higher than the bare Cu. Even with these increases in HER, ECH was still dominant over HER, though as the magnitude of potential increased from −0.5 V to −0.65 V, the HER was promoted more. This interesting observation led us to study the effects of electrodeposited Cu/Cu catalysts at more negative potentials. Fig. 3c shows the results at -0.8 V. The Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst increased the production rate for FA + MF by only 30.5% compared to bare Cu after 1.5 h reaction. This was actually a decrease in FE for ECH of FF compared to bare Cu, because of the dramatic increase of the production rate of H2. On the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst, the production rate and FE for H2 was 9.6 and 2.8 times that of bare Cu, respectively. On a bare Cu and Cu/Cu-4 μm catalysts, FE for ECH was still much higher (55.6% and 55.5%) than HER (16.8% and 27.8%). HER was much more favored compared to ECH of FF on the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst. Directly comparing the results at −0.8 V after 1.5 h reaction, Cu/Cu-400 nm seemed to improve only the production rate and FE for HER, and not ECH in comparison to bare Cu. We previously observed that as the concentration of FF dropped during the reaction over Cu bare, that the reaction would switch from being ECH- to HER- favored [11]. To see if this was the case for the Cu/Cu catalysts, we also examined the ECH reaction as a function of time. Fig. 4 shows the consumption of FF, cumulative production of FA, MF and H2 from both ECH of FF and HER as a function of time on both bare Cu and Cu/Cu-400 nm catalysts at -0.8 V. After 90 min of reaction at -0.8 V, the cumulative formation of H2 was greater than that of MF + FA on Cu/Cu-400 nm (Fig. 4-b), while the cumulative formation of FA + MF was more than H2 on bare Cu (Fig. 4-a). However, after 30 min of reaction (when a significant quantity of FF was still present in the solution), the cumulative production of FA + MF on Cu/Cu-400 nm was 2.2 times greater than that on bare Cu, and did not show a dramatic increase of H2 formation. At 60 min of reaction time on Cu/Cu-400 nm, the concentration of FF in the solution was near 20 mM and the cumulative production for both FA + MF and H2 were close. After this point, HER became dominant and the production rate for HER exponentially increased on Cu/Cu-400 nm as the concentration of FF further decreased. In our previous study for ECH of FF on Cu bare, dramatic increases in H2 formation were also observed when the concentration of FF was low [11]. When the initial concentration of FF was 20 mM FF or the concentration of FF approached 20 mM as FF was consumed, the reaction rate for HER exponentially increased, and HER became dominant over ECH of FF [11]. This same observation was made here on Cu/Cu-400 nm after 60 min of reaction at −0.8 V. We further evaluated the cumulative production of FA, MF and H2 as function of FF conversion at −0.8 V to better examine the impact of FF driving force on ECH and lessening of FF on HER (Fig. S6). The cumulative production of FA and MF was consistent as the conversion of FF increased, regardless of electrocatalyst. This suggests that the mechanism for ECH remained consistent over the different catalysts. There were several interesting observations made regarding HER. The first was that after 55–65% of the FF had been converted, a dramatic increase in hydrogen produced was observed. The second was that the catalyst did seem to impact HER more than ECH. The Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst lead to much more hydrogen being produced at the same conversions of FF compared to the other catalysts when conversion was greater than 54%. This same observation, to a lesser extent, was also made on the Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst. The higher roughness did lead to higher current and reaction rate, though as the conversion of FF increased, the higher currents were largely attributed to HER. At −0.95 V, where conversions of FF were very high after 1.5 h of reaction, FE for ECH of FF was less than 27.8% on all three Cu catalysts (Fig. S7). We previously showed this drop, similar to the drop shown in Fig. S6 at −0.8 V, was due to lack of available FF and thus enhancement of HER at −0.95 V [11] and a much lesser extent to biomass-derived side reactions. The mole balances reported here account for the summation of the FF reactant and FA and MF products. When the mole balance does not close to 100%, furanic-based side reactions are occurring. At −0.8 V after 90 min of reaction, FF decreased by 337 μM and FA + MF increased by 215 μM on bare Cu, resulting in a mole balance of 76%. In comparison, FF decreased by 433 μM and FA + MF increased by 268μM Cu/Cu-400 nm, resulting in a mole balance of 67% (Fig. 4). After 30 min of reaction, the mole balance on bare Cu and Cu/Cu-400 nm was 89 and 78%, respectively. Also, the total FE accounting for the summation of FE for ECH and HER did not close to 100% at any of the potentials studied (Fig. 3). The lack of electron and mole balance closures indicate that a non-negligible fraction of FF and/or FA and MF were either decomposed or converted to side products that were not detected. This will be discussed in the following section."
13,Reaction deactivation and polymerization of furanic compounds,"3.3 Reaction deactivation and polymerization of furanic compounds For all the potential ranges and Cu catalysts examined, the summation of FE for FF to MF, FF to FA and HER did not close to 100% (Fig. 3). Similarly, the combined selectivity for all the liquid products detected, FA and MF, was less than 77%, regardless of applied potential (Fig. S8). In addition, the mole balance accounting for the summation of FF, FA and MF decreased from 95% to 63% as the applied potential increased from −0.5 V to −0.95 V after 90 min of reaction on bare Cu (Fig. S8). Cu/Cu-4 μm and Cu/Cu-400 nm electrocatalysts had lower MB as the applied potential increased after 90 min of reaction as well (Fig. S8). From our previous studies [11,12], we showed that furanic compounds in acidic solutions could be involved in homogeneous side reactions that resulted in the formation of humins, polymers or other solidified products that were not detected by GC/MS and micro-GC. These side reactions result in the mole balance not closing to 100%. When FA and MF products are consumed, then the FE balance is also impacted, as the electrons have already been transferred through the FF to FA or MF reactions but are not accounted for in product analysis of FA and MF. Another side effect of forming polymerized furanic compounds that we observed was their coverage on the surface of bare Cu electrodes, deactivating both ECH of FF and HER [11]. The Schröder [13] and Li [14] groups quantified small amount of dimers produced under conditions similar to this work on Cu foils, but the Li group also reported a lack of mole balance closure. The Saffron [15] group also reported a lack of mole balance closure on Ni and Fe electrodes, suggesting the polymerization of FA. There have been investigations of the acid-catalyzed FA conversion to levulinic acid [27] and ECH of levulinic acid to gamma valerolactone and valeric acid [8]. We analyzed our solutions to determine if any additional products such as levulinic acid and gamma valerolactone were being formed. Fig. S9 shows a chromatogram of the electrolyte solution after reaction in comparison to a prepared standard solution spiked with other possible products showing that FA and MF were the only detected liquid products from ECH of FF in our studies. The loss of other biomass-derived chemicals in acidic and basic solutions for electrochemical reaction has also been reported by others. For example, the Choi group showed the loss of 5-hydromethylfurfural in basic solution [28], while the Lercher group reported a decrease in mole balance during ECH of phenol as well as phenol derivatives coating the electrode surface [9]. Beyond lower yields of desired products, a significant effect of polymerization of furanic derivatives is catalyst deactivation [11]. We observed a surface coating of polymeric FF derivatives on a bare Cu electrode, resulting in a continuous decrease in current and deactivation of the electrochemical reactions [11]. On the surface of the electrode, a balance of both FF and chemisorbed hydrogen (Had) are required for ECH of FF. When Had entirely covers the surface, HER will be the only reaction, while neither ECH of FF or HER will occur when only furanic compounds are on the surface of electrode or when a polymer has blocked access to the surface. We previously observed that when the furanic surface coverage increased, the current decreased on bare Cu at potentials studied −0.5 V and −0.8 V with 100 mM FF [11]. Fig. 5 shows the normalized current density changes during ECH of FF. it and i0 indicate the current at specific reaction time and initial current, respectively. The absolute current density is shown in Figs. S4 and S10. A continuous decrease of current density was observed at both −0.5 and −0.8 V on bare Cu. At −0.5 V on bare Cu, current density decreased by 30% compared to the initial current, while concentration of FF decreased by 14% after 90 min of reaction (Fig. 3-a). This suggests the current drop was likely not only due to consumption of the FF reactant in the semi-batch electrochemical reactor. Cu/Cu-4 μm maintained slightly higher current density than bare Cu (Fig. S4). However, Cu/Cu-4 μm had a 53% decrease in current density after of 1.5 h reaction at −0.5 V, while the concentration of FF decreased by 14.2% over the same time period (Fig. 3-a). In contrast, the current decreased by 19% at -0.5 V on Cu/Cu-400 nm, while the concentration of FF decreased by 28.6% over 90 min of reaction (Fig. 3-a). This suggests that the current density decay phenomena was different on the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst than the bare Cu and Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst. If the primary reaction is ECH of FF, the reaction rate, and therefore the current density, should decrease as the concentration of FF decreases. The reaction with the Cu/Cu-400 nm had the lowest amount of FF left at the end of the reaction, which would should have resulted in the lowest current density. Since the trend between the three Cu catalysts does not follow the concentration of FF remaining, the higher currents on the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst could be due to less deactivation from furanic build-up on the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst or to the increased HER on Cu/Cu-400 nm. Further detailed analysis of the reaction kinetics of ECH and HER combined with deactivation mechanisms are necessary to fully understand the source of the observations made here. In comparison, at the more negative potential −0.8 V, bare Cu again showed a continuous decrease of current, resulting in deactivation of reaction at even much higher potential. However, both Cu/Cu-4 μm and Cu/Cu-400 nm catalysts maintained a consistent current for approximately the first 20 min of reaction. Then, the Cu/Cu-4 μm catalyst showed a slight decrease of the current between 20 and 60 min, followed by an increase after 60 min of reaction. The current increase after 60 min of reaction could be due to loss of FF, followed by HER becoming the predominant reaction [9,11]. Cu/Cu-400 nm showed a continuous increase of current. After 60 min of reaction, the current started to dramatically increase, which showed the reaction shift from ECH of FF to HER when the concentration of FF decreased as discussed in regards to Fig. 4."
14,Cu electrocatalyst reusability,"3.4 Cu electrocatalyst reusability Since we observed an improved production rate for FA and MF on Cu/Cu-400 nm compared to bare Cu, we investigated the reusability of the Cu/Cu-400 nm and compared it to that of bare Cu at −0.5 V. Fig. 6 shows four-repeated ECH of FF cycles for bare Cu and Cu/Cu-400 nm at −0.5 V. For Cu/Cu-400 nm, the FE for FA and MF was at least 93% during the cycles, indicating ECH of FF was dominant over HER. The selectivity over the catalyst did not change with repeated use as well. The production rate for both FA + MF was maintained between 1.20 and 1.25 μmol/min cm2 over the span of cycles, indicating the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst was stable over the examined period. On bare Cu, the FE for FA and MF was at least 91%. However, on bare Cu the production rate for FA and MF decreased as the number of cycles increased, accounting for a 40% loss in production rate between the first and fourth cycles. The Lercher group reported that the surface coverage of phenol derivatives deactivated the electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol [9]. Also, they reported that the prevention of deactivation was achieved when the magnitude of applied potential increased, providing more Had and blocking the adsorption of side products on electrode [9]. In Fig. 5, the current density decreased as the reaction time increased at -0.5 V, but Cu/Cu-400 nm mitigated the significant current drop, compared to bare Cu. It is possible that Cu/Cu-400 nm may have more chemisorbed hydrogen during ECH of FF, so that the surface of Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst was covered by a lesser amount of furanic derivatives. This may be why Cu/Cu-400 nm maintained similar production rate for FA + MF during four cycles of ECH of FF. SEM and EDS images of the surface of both catalysts after four cycles of ECH of FF shows how different the surface coverage of carbon was on the catalysts after ECH of FF (Fig. 7 ). The surface of bare Cu was covered by black material (Fig. 7-a), which was mainly composed of carbon (Fig. 7-c). We also previously have observed the surface coverage of carbonaceous materials on the bare Cu foil after ECH of FF, both visually and using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [11,12]. In contrast, a significant carbonaceous black layer was not observed on the Cu/Cu-400 nm surface (Figs. 7-b and d). The lack of carbon on the surface likely is the reason for the consistent catalytic performance for ECH of FF observed on Cu/Cu-400 nm. These results show that by 3-D nanostructuring the Cu catalyst, the catalyst resiliency can be enhanced with higher reaction activity for ECH of FF."
15,Conclusion,"Microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Cu electrocatalysts were synthesized by electrodeposition on Cu substrate, which had higher double layer capacitance and electrochemical roughness in comparison to bare Cu electrode. The production rate and FE for both desired ECH of FF and undesired HER were directly compared on three Cu electrocatalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4. The production rates for ECH of FF more than doubled at −0.5 V and −0.65 V on the high roughness Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst compared to bare Cu, while having minimal production of H2. At −0.8 V, the production rate for FA and MF on Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst still more than doubled when the concentration of FF was high. However, HER dramatically increased at −0.8 V as the concentration of FF decreased with reaction time. Between −0.5 and −0.8 V, reaction deactivation was shown on bare Cu due to furanic derivatives covering the surface of electrode, while Cu/Cu-400 nm prevented the reaction deactivation. Also, the Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst was reusable for repeated reactions, maintaining the production rate and FE for desired products. The nanocrystalline Cu/Cu-400 nm catalyst improved the activity for ECH of FF at lower potential ranges, allowing for higher production rates of FA and MF while minimizing H2 production."
