0,Introduction,"Chiral alcohols have attracted substantial interest, which were confirmed to be versatile building blocks in various industrial field, such as chemical, cosmetics and medicine [1,2]. The preparation methods for chiral alcohols include chemical synthesis and biological catalysis, in which the chemical approach usually involves cost-expensive metal catalysts and environmentally harmful organic solvents [3]. With the potential to eliminate the problems of high cost and pollution in traditional chemical routes, biological asymmetric reduction becomes more attractive for the preparation of chiral alcohols [4]. Compared to purified enzymes, whole-cell biocatalysis is advantageous on avoiding high-cost and laborious purification of intracellular enzymes, and extra supplement of expensive cofactors, as well as maintaining the moderate environment to prevent denaturation or inactivation of enzymes in unconventional reaction media [5]. Each enantiomer of 3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl ethanol (BTPE) is the key intermediate for the synthesis of Aprepitant (compound 1) [6], a typical NK-1 receptor antagonists, which has been reported to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy [7]. Furthermore, (S)-BTPE can also serve as the intermediate to prepare compound 2, which show a significant effect on treating or preventing immunodisease [8] (seen in Fig. 1 ). At present, researchers mainly focused on the biosynthesis of (R)-BTPE with different microorganisms, such as Penicillium expansum [9], Trichoderma asperellum ZJPH0810 [10], Leifsonia xyli HS0904 [11]. There are few reports on (S)-BTPE preparation by biocatalysis [6,12,13]. In practical application, whole-cell biocatalysis is mainly limited by low cell membrane permeability and poor solubility of hydrophobic non-natural substrate, which resulted in unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency [14]. Therefore, the search for novel biocatalyst and efficient way to accelerate the biotransformation is of great importance. Recently, the study on medium engineering for biocatalysis to improve the bioprocess efficacy has gained increasing attention, with several remarkable successes [15]. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), as a novel reaction medium, formed by complexing hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) with hydrogen bond donator (HBD), with potential to replace ionic liquids and traditional organic solvent, has attracted much attention due to its unique characteristics of easy synthesis, environmental friendliness and negligible cytotoxicity [16–19], especially natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) which composed of major cell metabolites [20]. At present, the researchers are mainly concerned about the application of DES / NADES with choline chloride and choline acetate as hydrogen receptors [21,22]. Yang et al. employed various ChCl- or ChAC-based DESs and NADESs as co-solvent in the bioconversion of isoeugenol catalyzed by Lysinibacillus fusiformis cells, with 142 % and 132 % vanillin yield was achieved in DESs/NADESs-containing system compared to the aqueous system [23]. It was worth noting that DESs / NADESs with betaine, L-proline, L-carnitine as HBA had been widely used in extraction process [24,25], but rarely involved in biocatalysis [26]. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the application of novel and diverse DES/NADES in the field of biocatalysis. Biotransformation was performed smoothly in a DES/NADES-containing system, but the yield remained limited by water-insolubility of synthetic substrates [27]. Many attempts are explored to solve this problem. For example, through the introduction of hydrophobic ionic liquids [28] and organic solvents [29] as second phase in reaction medium improved 2-octanone loading effectively in the bioreduction. In consideration of cost-effective and biocompatible, surfactant turned out to be another alternative additive in biotransformation process, owing to its better biocompatibility toward biocatalysts and high substrate solubility [30]. Zhou et al. improved phytosterol solubility and cell permeability of Mycobacterium sp. LY-1 in the presence of TX-40, and obtained 42.5 % yield of 9α-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (9α-OH-AD) at 15 g/L of phytosterol concentration compared with only 13.4 % yield in the surfactant-free reaction medium [31]. In this work, more attention was being paid to explore whether NADES and surfactant exhibited synergistic effect on bioreductive reaction mediated by microbial whole-cell. Asymmetric reduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE was performed with a novel yeast isolate Cyberlindnera saturnus ZJPH1807 in a NADES/surfactant-containing reaction system. To optimize the bioreduction of BTAP in the developed NADES/surfactant-buffer system, several crucial reaction parameters involved in the reaction, such as cell dosage, type of buffer and buffer pH, C:Lys (molar ratio of 1:2) content were investigated individually. Moreover, a comparative evaluation in the presence of NADES and surfactant or not was further performed, and this bioprocess was also feasible at 500 mL preparation scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report upon the whole-cell biocatalysis in the NADES/surfactant-containing system for highly efficient synthesis of chiral aromatic alcohol."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals BTAP was purchased from Beijing Golden Olive Company, China. (R)-BTPE and (S)-BTPE were obtained from Hangzhou Xinhai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China. DESs or NADESs used in the experiments (listed in Table 1 ) were synthesized by Shanghai Fujie Chemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. All other chemicals were from commercial sources and were of analytical grade."
3,Strain and cultivation,"2.2 Strain and cultivation Strains of Cyberlindnera saturnus ZJPH1807 (CCTCC M 2019215), Enterobacter cloacae ZJPH1903 (CCTCC M 2019821), Galactomyces geotrichum ZJPH1810 (CCTCC M 2019822) were screened out from soil samples by our research group. The soil samples used for microorganisms screening were collected from Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu province in China, and a substrate-oriented strategy was adopted in the screening process [32]. After enrichment culture for desired strains and continuous streaking of single colony on screening medium agar, the obtained isolates were inoculated into whole nutrient medium and cultured for 24 h at 200 rpm and 30℃. The enrichment medium contained (g/L): BTAP 5, NaCl 1, MgSO4·7H2O 0.5, KH2PO4 2, K2HPO4·3H2O 2, (NH4)2SO4 2 with the initial pH of 6.5. The whole nutrient medium composed of (g/L): glucose 15, peptone 20, yeast extract 10, (NH4)2SO4 2, KH2PO4 2, NaCl 1, MgSO4·7H2O 0.5 with pH 6.5. After cultivation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9000 rpm, 4℃ for 10 min, and then subjected to evaluation for their biocatalytic performances in a 50 mL conical flask with BTAP, PBS buffer and glucose as co-substrate. The product was extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate prior to GC analysis. C. saturnus ZJPH1807 isolate was firstly transferred into whole nutrient medium for 12 h under 200 rpm and 30℃. Subsequently, seed culture was transferred into a 250 mL flask containing 90 mL fermentation medium with 8 mL inoculation, and then cultivated with shaking for 32 h under the same conditions. The fermentation medium composed of (g/L): glucose 34.36, yeast extract 14.89, NH4Cl 30.34, KH2PO4 1.01, CaCl2 0.11 with the initial pH of 7.5. Similarly, E. cloacae ZJPH1903 and G. geotrichum ZJPH1810 cells were obtained by the centrifugation after fermentation culture, and used for BTAP bioreduction."
4,General process for asymmetric bioreduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE,"2.3 General process for asymmetric bioreduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE Cells were harvested by centrifugation under 9500 rpm for 12 min at 4℃, and then washed twice with phosphate buffer. Afterwards, asymmetric bioreduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE was performed in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, which contained certain amount of BTAP substrate, glucose as co-substrate, PBS buffer system, or DES/NADES and surfactant-containing medium. The reaction mixture was shaken at 200 rpm and 30℃. To improve the catalytic efficiency for (S)-BTPE production, some indispensible factors involved in the bioreduction including cell dosage, NADES content, buffer type and buffer pH were optimized systematically. The resultant product and residual substrate were extracted with ethyl acetate, and assayed by GC analysis. Triplicate runs were performed for each trial."
5,Synthesis of (S)-BTPE on preparation scale in C:Lys/surfactant-containing system,"2.4 Synthesis of (S)-BTPE on preparation scale in C:Lys/surfactant-containing system A preparative-scale asymmetric reduction was performed in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with 100 mL working volume, which contained phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5), 150 g (wet cell weight)/L (45.41 g (DCW)/L) C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells, 1% (w/v) C:Lys (1:2), 5 g/L Tween-80, 50 g/L glucose, 500 mM of BTAP. After 24 h of reaction under 200 rpm and 30℃, the formed (S)-BTPE was extracted by ethyl acetate. Further purification of the crude product was performed by column chromatography on silica (8:1 (v/v) petroleum ether and dichloromethane). The optical rotation value of the obtained product was determined by an Automatic Polarimeter V (USA)."
6,GC analysis,"2.5 GC analysis The reaction samples were measured by Agilent Technologies 7820A GC system equipped with a flame ionization detector and Varian CP-Chirasil-Dex CB column (25 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm). The split ratio was 15:1. The temperature of the injector and detector were both of 250℃. The initial column temperature was 80℃, which was maintained for 2 min, then raised up to 125℃ at a rate of 5℃/min. The carrier gas was nitrogen with a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. A calculation method was adopted, which used n-dodecane as an internal standard. The retention times for BTAP, n-dodecane, (S)-BTPE and (R)-BTPE were 3.9 min, 8.6 min, 9.8 min and 10.4 min, respectively. The formula to calculate the yield and product ee value was as follows: Yield (%) = C P /C 0 ×100 % C p is the concentration of (S)-BTPE, C 0 is the concentration of initial substrate concentration. ee = (C S -C R )/(C S +C R ) ×100 % C S is the concentration of (S)-BTPE, C R is the concentration of (R)-BTPE."
7,Determination of substrate solubility,"2.6 Determination of substrate solubility The standard curve of substrate was established to determine the solubility of BTAP when using n-dodecane as an internal standard, which is similar to the method described in our previous work [33]. Excessive BTAP was added into phosphate buffer solution containing certain volume fraction of NADES and surfactant or not, and shaken at 200 rpm, 30℃ for 24 h. After centrifugation, the samples were extracted by ethyl acetate and detected by GC analysis."
8,Metabolic activity retention measurement,"2.7 Metabolic activity retention measurement The metabolic activity retention (MAR) of cells was determined based on glucose consumption by the method consisted with previous report [33]. The cells were suspended in phosphate buffer containing NADES, surfactant and BTAP or not, and pretreated at 200 rpm, 30℃ for 24 h. After incubating for 3 h by adding 30 g/L glucose solution, glucose concentration was measured by biosensor analyzer."
9,Determination of cell membrane permeability,"2.8 Determination of cell membrane permeability Cells were treated with DES or NADES and surfactant at 200 rpm, 30℃ for 24 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were sampled for the measurement of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm with ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Furthermore, cell membrane integrity was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) after pretreatment with NADES and surfactant. The samples were fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde for overnight, followed by washing triple with phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for 15 min, and repeated washing step after fixed with 1% OsO4 for 1−2 h. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol (30 %, 50 %, 70 %, 80 %, 90 % and 95 %) for about 15 min at each step, and then dehydrated by alcohol for 20 min. The samples were dried in a Hitachi HC-2 critical point dryer, and observed by Hitachi SU-8010 scanning electron microscope."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Screening of biocatalysts,"3.1 Screening of biocatalysts The development of new biocatalysts with high catalytic efficiency and enantioselectivity in the process of chiral alcohols preparation is a research hotspot in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry [34]. Based on the pursuit of efficient biocatalyst, various microbial strains were investigated for the BTAP bioreduction. As illustrated in Table 2 , among all tested strains preserved in our laboratory or isolated from soil samples, C. saturnus ZJPH1807 showed great yield of (S)-BTPE with excellent enantioselectivity (> 99.9 %). The other strains either had poor selectivity or produced unsatisfactory (S)-BTPE yield. C. saturnus ZJPH1807 isolate was determined as the best biocatalyst for (S)-BTPE synthesis for further study. The sequence of 26S rDNA of C. saturnus ZJPH1807 isolate was deposited in the GenBank database with an accession number of MW227321. To the best of our knowledge, Cyberlindnera saturnus had been reported to be used in xylitol and lipid production [35,36], but firstly involved in preparing chiral aryl alcohol in the present study."
12,Effects of key reaction parameters on the bioreduction in phosphate buffer system,"3.2 Effects of key reaction parameters on the bioreduction in phosphate buffer system In the process of asymmetric reduction from BTAP to (S)-BTPE, it is of great significance to optimize key process parameters. Co-substrate has been employed to improve the cofactor deficiency of bioreduction, which is preferable to enzyme-coupled approach in terms of economic benefits [37]. In consideration of cofactor regeneration effect, various kinds of alcohols, sugars and amino acids as co-substrate were assessed. As Fig. 2 (a) showed, in contrast to alcohols and amino acids co-substrate, all tested sugars exerted positive effects on the product yield. Among them, glucose as co-substrate endowed the reaction with a 61.5 % yield and > 99.9 % product ee under 200 mM BTAP concentration. The optimal glucose amount was 50 g/L (Supporting information Fig. S4). Interestingly, all evaluated alcohols exhibited negative effects on the product yield compared to that without the addition of co-substrate. It seemed that the enzyme responsible for this bioreductive reaction was more sensitive to alcohols. Biocatalyst amount also makes difference in catalytic efficiency. As the Fig. 2(b) showed, it witnessed an upward trend of product yield when cell dosage ranged from 10 g/L to 50 g/L. With 50 g (wet cell weight)/L cell concentration, the highest product yield of 60.7 % was obtained under 300 mM BTAP concentration. Further increase in cell concentration has no positive effect on the bioreduction, even caused slightly decrease in product yield. Other process parameters such as reaction temperature, buffer pH were also within the scope of our investigations (Supporting information Fig. S4). Optimal buffer pH and reaction temperature were determined at 7.0 and 30℃, respectively."
13,Optimization of biocatalytic production of (S)-BTPE in C:Lys-containing system,"3.3 Optimization of biocatalytic production of (S)-BTPE in C:Lys-containing system DESs/NADESs characterized by better biocompatibility and biodegradability, have attracted a wide range of interest from researchers. To date, few studies have been reported on the performances of DESs/NADESs in biocatalysis, and the preparation of chiral alcohols in DESs/NADESs-containing system [38]. In this work, we investigated nine kinds of DESs/NADESs composed of different HBA (betaine, L-proline, L-carnitine) with HBD (glucose, alcohol, amino acids) in the process of asymmetric reduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE mediated by C. saturnus ZJPH1807. As showed in Fig. 3 (a), all tested DESs/NSDESs exhibited positive effects on the product yield except B:Glu (1:1). The reaction system may narrow the catalytic activity of related enzymes in the presence of acidic amino acid (such as glutamate). The DESs with betaine as HBA showed good biocompatibility to C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells, thereby producing higher (S)-BTPE yield. Among them, C:Lys (1:2) possessed best acceleration to the bioreduction. Compared to C:Lys (1:1)-containing system, higher product yield was achieved in the presence of C:Lys (1:2). It implied that lysine plays an important role in the reaction, which had been previously conformed to promote cofactor regeneration during the whole-cell-mediated reduction [26,38]. It was worth noting that none of DESs/NADESs exerted negative effect on the product ee value. Our results demonstrated that DESs/NADESs had great potential in the preparation of chiral drugs. C:Lys (1:2) turned out to be a promising co-solvent in reaction medium owing to the best (S)-BTPE yield. It is also of great importance to investigate the eﬀ ;ect of C:Lys (1:2) content on the asymmetric reduction. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the product yield was accelerated by the addition of C:Lys (1:2) ranged from 0.5 %–1 % (w/v). The highest yield of 76.0 % was reached with 1% (w/v) C:Lys (1:2) content. The product yield decreased moderately with the further increase in C:Lys (1:2) amount. It was mainly owing to the cytotoxicity or mass transfer resistance caused by excessive NADES addition [39]. Thus, the appropriate C:Lys (1:2) content is 1% (w/v). Cell concentration, type of buffer and buffer pH were also investigated respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 3(c), in C:Lys (1:2)-containing system, the product yield increased substantially with cell concentration ranged from 50 g/L to 150 g/L. When cell dosage above 150 g/L, the yield decreased significantly, probably due to the mass-transfer limitation resulted by excessive biomass. The effect of buffer pH on the catalytic activity was studied in different buffer systems at the pH range of 4.0–9.6 (Fig. 3(d)). Among the buffer solutions evaluated, phosphate buffer with pH 7.5 was optimal because of producing better product yield. Notably, the C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells maintained good catalytic activity either in neutral or alkaline conditions, which shows wider adaptability and great potential in industrial application."
14,The biocatalytic reduction of BTAP in a integrated system of NADES and surfactant,"3.4 The biocatalytic reduction of BTAP in a integrated system of NADES and surfactant It is convenient and cost-effective to construct a surfactant-containing reaction system for the biotransformation. Surfactant like TX-40 and CTAB had been introduced in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds and mannatide mediated by microbial whole-cell [31,40]. In the present work, several kinds of surfactants were estimated individually in the bioconversion of BTAP with C. saturnus ZJPH1807. As illustrated in Fig. 4 (a), the yield was significantly enhanced by introducing all kinds of surfactants tested, most prominently manifested by the addition of Tween-80, which produced 46.7 % higher yield than the surfactant-free system. Moreover, the solubility of BTAP reached 280.23 mg/L in the presence of C:Lys (1:2) and Tween-80, which was increased by 7.6-fold compared to 32.71 mg/L in buffer solution (supporting information Table S1). It seemed that Tween-80 endowed the reaction medium with satisfactory solubility of BTAP and moderately improved the cell membrane permeability, which were beneficial to the biotransformation. Interestingly, the most significant solubility of BTAP resulted by Span-80 addition did not led to best (S)-BTPE yield, probably owing to higher cytotoxicity of Span-80 to the biocatalyst. The effect of surfactant content on the reduction was illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the product yield increased with Tween-80 content from 1 g/L to 5 g/L. The highest yield of (S)-BTPE was obtained at 5 g/L Tween-80. Conversely, excessive surfactant dosage above 5 g/L led to obviously decrease in (S)-BTPE yield. It is possible that high surfactant concentration exerted negative impact on intracellular enzyme activity [31]. Moreover, the individual or synergistic effects of C:Lys (1:2) with Tween-80 on catalytic performance of C. saturnus ZJPH1807 were investigated (seen in Table 3 ). Our results indicated that NADES performed better than individual components of C:Lys on product yield. It was confirmed that hydrogen bonding network formed between L-carnitine and lysine exerted positive effects on biological asymmetric reduction mediated by whole-cell. The developed reaction system integrated C:Lys (1:2) and Tween-80 produced a 88.4 % yield of (S)-BTPE under 400 mM substrate concentration, which is much better than the system containing single components of L-carnitine and lysine in C:Lys (1:2), or Tween-80 only."
15,Effect of different NADESs and surfactant on the permeability of cell membrane of C. saturnus ZJPH1807,"3.5 Effect of different NADESs and surfactant on the permeability of cell membrane of C. saturnus ZJPH1807 Low permeability of cell membrane is a major limiting factor in biocatalysis [41]. Appropriate amount of DES/NADES or surfactant introduced in reaction medium displayed the ability to increase cell membrane permeability and facilitate the contact between substrate and biocatalyst [23,26,31,38]. Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate the effects of DESs/NADESs and surfactant on cell membrane permeability of C. saturnus ZJPH1807. The variation of OD260 and OD280 is a measurement indicator to appraise the release of intracellular components (primarily nucleic acids and proteins). As illustrated in Table 4 , cell membrane permeability was improved in the presence of DESs/NADESs, compared to the corresponding DESs/NADESs-free system. Among all tested DESs/NADESs, C:Lys (1:2) exhibited the best effect on increasing membrane permeability of cells. This might account for why C:Lys (1:2) outcompeted another DESs/NADESs as most powerful co-solvent in the reduction. Notably, all trialed surfactant showed significant increase in cell membrane permeability in the C:Lys (1:2)-containing system. Further cellular penetration caused by surfactant addition facilitates the contact between substrate and biocatalyst, resulted in the enhancement of catalytic efficiency. Interestingly, Span-20 and Tween-60 displayed best performance in OD260nm and OD280nm value but gave lower yield than in C:Lys (1:2)/Tween-80-containing buffer. The results implied that excessive cell penetration may exert negative effect on enzyme activity responsible for the reduction. Additional intuitive evidence for the improvement of cell membrane permeability was displayed by SEM observation. As the Fig. 5 showed, the normal C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells without any treatment are smooth and intact. In contrast, the cells treated with C:Lys (1:2) showed many depressions in the cell surface. Obviously, the integrity of cell membrane has been destroyed, these changes facilitated the contact of substrate with microbial catalyst. Furthermore, the cells treated with C:Lys (1:2) and Tween-80 together showed more dents with many folds in the cell surface. It indicated that cell membrane permeability was further improved in the presence of surfactant. The above results revealed the possible mechanism why the best product yield produced in the NADES/surfactant-containing reaction medium."
16,Biocompatibility of various NADESs and surfactant with C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells,"3.6 Biocompatibility of various NADESs and surfactant with C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells As the Fig. 6 showed, the catalytic activity of C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells was affected in the presence of various additives, which is consisted with previously report [23]. Compared with PBS buffer solution, only slight decreases in cell viability were exhibited in the evaluated DESs/NADESs-containing system. Our results indicated that all tested DESs/NADESs, which consisted of two or three cellular metabolites, had better biocompatibility to the microbial cells. However, the cell viability of C. saturnus ZJPH1807 decreased obviously in the developed NADES/surfactant-containing system. It is implied that surfactant showed cytotoxicity to the biocatalyst to some extent. Among them, Tween-80 afforded better biocompatibility with higher MAR values. Another notable factor is the cytotoxicity caused by substrate BTAP. The decline in cell viability was observed in the presence of BTAP compared to substrate-free system. Thus, how to reduce the cytotoxicity caused by substrate is an urgent issue. Our results confirmed that DESs/NADESs slightly weakened the toxicity of BTAP toward the cells, providing a feasible approach to narrow the substrate cytotoxicity. Among all trialed DESs/NADESs, C:Lys (1:2) exhibited best biocompatibility with highest MAR values in the presence of BTAP, which is in agreement with the results that C. saturnus ZJPH1807 cells gave best product yield in the C:Lys (1:2)-containing system. It was notable that the cytotoxicity caused by substrate BTAP was even greater than tested DESs/NADESs. Comparatively lower MAR value was observed in the C:Lys (1:2)/Tween-80-containing system in the presence of BTAP, but the best product yield was acquired in this integrated system. A reasonable explanation is that, with the simultaneous introduction of C:Lys (1:2) and Tween-80 in reaction system, the membrane permeability was improved and the mass-transfer limitation was also relieved, thus facilitate the bioreduction and increase the catalytic efficiency. Similar result was obtained by Mao et al. in steroid biotransformation in deep eutectic solvents catalyzed by Arthrobacter simplex [42]."
17,"Comparative study on the bioreduction in PBS buffer, NADES-containing buffer and NADES/surfactant-containing system","3.7 Comparative study on the bioreduction in PBS buffer, NADES-containing buffer and NADES/surfactant-containing system As shown in Fig. 7 , the yield and substrate loading for BTAP reduction were much lower in the neat PBS buffer solution than that in other mixed reaction systems. 152.8 mM product (with 76.4 % yield) was obtained after 30 h reaction under 200 mM BTAP concentration in the aqueous system. With the introduction of C:Lys (1:2) into the reaction medium, (S)-BTPE concentration reached 254.5 mM with a 84.8 % yield under 300 mM substrate concentration. The reaction time was shortened to 24 h, while the product ee value remained intact. The results in the NADES-containing system indicated that C:Lys (1:2) improved reaction efficiency owing to enhanced the permeability of cell membrane. Especially, the product concentration of (S)-BTPE achieved 404.8 mM (81.0 % yield) in a mixed reaction medium integrated NADES and surfactant after 24 h reaction under 500 mM BTAP. Besides significantly improvement in substrate loading, the synergistic effect of NADES and surfactant Tween-80 are also advantageous on greatly cut down reaction time. Notably, the productivity for (S)-BTPE reached 196.7 g/(L·d) in the developed C:Lys/Tween-80-containing system. Our results exhibited the best volumetric productivity of (S)-BTPE preparation mediated by microbial whole-cell ever reported (see Table 5 ). The underlying mechanism for the improvement in (S)-BTPE yield might be that NADES facilitate the contact between substrate and catalyst, and surfactant Tween-80 further increase the solubility of BTAP. The integrated strategy combining the advantages of NADES with surfactant achieved the highest (S)-BTPE yield by microbial whole cells in the preparation of (S)-BTPE so far."
18,Preparative-scale asymmetric reduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE,"3.8 Preparative-scale asymmetric reduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE Preparative-scale asymmetric reduction of BTAP to (S)-BTPE was carried out in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with 100 mL working volume under optimal reaction conditions. 500 mM BTAP was added into the C:Lys/surfactant-containing system to initiate the reaction, a yield of 79.7 % was achieved after 24 h reaction. It indicated that the synergistic system of NADES and surfactant was also feasible on 500 mL preparative-scale in biocatalysis application. After the extraction with ethyl acetate and further purification by column chromatography, the isolate yield of (S)-BTPE is 84.1 %, the optical rotation value of the purified product is [a]D 20= -23.33 (c 0.3, ethyl acetate)."
19,Conclusion,"In this work, a novel C. saturnus ZJPH1807 isolate was firstly employed in the biosynthesis of (S)-BTPE with excellent enantioselectivity (> 99.9 % ee), and a NADES/surfactant-containing system was successfully developed for accelerating the bioreduction of BTAP. The addition of 1% (w/v) C:Lys (1:2) in the reaction system obviously improved the cell membrane permeability and reduced the cytotoxicity of BTAP to the microbial cells. Our results demonstrated that the developed C:Lys/Tween-80-containing reaction medium endowed the reduction with satisfactory yield under 500 mM substrate loading, with a 1.5-fold increase in BTAP concentration compared with the neat aqueous PBS buffer. The preparative-scale synthesis of (S)-BTPE was also performed smoothly in the established reaction system. The present work provides a promising alternative approach for strengthen the bioreduction of hydrophobic substrate through the synergistic effect of NADES and surfactant."
