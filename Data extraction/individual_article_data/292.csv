0,Introduction,"The global energy demand is ever-growing, driven by strong economic growth and an increasing pursuit of a high-quality of life [1]. Nowadays, traditional fossil energy still occupies the main part of energy structure, meanwhile, burning those fuels also will bring continuous environmental pollution [2]. Therefore, it is an ideal solution to replace traditional fossil fuels with renewable resources, for example, water, wind, terrestrial heat, tidal energy and solar energy [3–6]. Thereinto, photocatalytic hydrogen production driven by solar energy is a clean and eco-friendly way to produce hydrogen for various application [7,8]. At the present stage, most researchers focus on structure design and synthesis of photocatalysts [9], while the photocatalytic reactors has been paid fewer attention [10]. In fact, photocatalytic reactors are quite different from ordinary thermochemical reactors and some specific operational parameters of reactor should be considered such as the intensity and the continuity of the incident light which determines the reaction rate [11]. Up to now, there is no uniform standard for photocatalytic reactor design either in lab or in the industry, and there are different reactor designs for different researches or application aims [9,12]. One case for the very frequently used photocatalytic reactor in lab scale is that the prepared photocatalyst powder is put into a round flask under magnetic stirring which will then be radiated by Xenon lamp with a certain intensity [13]. Except for that, parabolic trough reactors, compound parabolic collectors, inclined plate collectors, double-skin sheet photoreactors, rotating disk reactors and fixed bed photoreactors etc. have also been designed as pilot scale photocatalytic reactors for photocatalytic reaction under natural solar irradiation [12,14]. One common feature of the above reactors is that the photocatalysts are all suspended in the reaction mixture. Again, it is traditionally accepted that efficient photocatalytic reaction is credited with large solid/liquid reaction surface area between reaction solution and suspended photocatalysts. However, circulation of the reaction fluid and the recycling of catalyst is a very energy-intensive part of the overall process considering the economics [15]. And if the catalyst powder was fixed on the specific substrate, the concerned problems could be solved easily, additionally, a photocatalyst panel can track the sun easily so that sunlight is absorbed most effectively during the day [16]. For the fixation of the photocatalysts on specific carrier, various approaches have been attempted. Razak et al. immobilized TiO2–PANI composite using ENR and PVC as adhesives. The photocatalytic activity was found to be sustainable with respect to the average pseudo first order rate [17]. Domen et al. demonstrated a concept of potentially inexpensive sunlight-powered reactors using a 1 m2 panel reactor with a fixed Al-doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst layer under a 1-mm-deep layer of water. A solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.4% was obtained in their experiment [18]. Our group has also reported an efficient overall solar-driven seawater splitting with p-GaN-based on Si wafer nanowire arrays without any external bias or sacrificial agents. A stable solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 1.9% was obtained under concentrated irradiation [19]. Moreover, for the economy of industrial applications and the stability of plate catalyst, searching for a good support is of great importance. 3D metal nickel foam has attracted considerable attention due to its high porosity, large surface area, excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and permeability. Ji et al. prepared Ag3PO4/GO film catalyst on a 3D nickel foam, which showed good degradation ability of norfloxacin antibiotic [20]. Excellent performance of hydrogen production and stability has been obtained through decorating MoS2/Ni3S2 nanoarray over Ni foam by Cao et al. [21]. Zhu et al. investigated the photocatalytic activity by preparing ultralong ZnO nanowires on the surface of nickel foams, they found that three-dimensional scaffold structure of Ni foam provides large surface are for ZnO nanowire growth [22]. Moreover, Chen et al. prepared a bifunctional electrocatalyst by in-situ growth Co3O4 on the nickel foam, the highest power density of zinc-air battery assembled by this air electrode can reach 54.5 mW cm−2 and cycle life could reach 358 h [23]. Wang et al. applied zirconia foam and high-porosity nickel foam in the meso-scale burners and partially premixed submerged combustion of liquid ethanol is achieved [24]. Moreover, the excellent performance was acquired using Co–P/Ni foam catalyst for 200 W proton exchange membrane fuel cell system [25]. Apparently, foam a very promising choice for the design of catalyst morphology. From above studies, one can see that it is an efficient way to immobilize the catalyst on the reactor or support surface, which can significantly reduce the energy cost for the suspension circulation and photocatalyst recycling and may also keep the photocatalytic activity sustained [7,15,26]. As discussed before, various different reactors have been investigated for hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting, but related reports about small-scale and microchannel reactors are really rare, especially combined with plate catalyst. In fact, in such small photoreactors, the catalysts could expose adequately to radiation of high intensity [27–29]. It could also obviously lead to enhanced reagent/catalyst contact and thus better mass transfer [30,31]. For the purpose of studying the photocatalytic hydrogen production in small-scale reactor using plate catalyst and exploring main factors leading to excellent performance, in this work, a strategy of steady and recyclable photocatalytic hydrogen production in a so-called spotlight reactor based on plate titanium dioxide supported on nickel foam prepared by simple coating method has been demonstrated. We are aiming to investigate if the use of plate catalysts in small reactors with intensive light irradiation could be a practically viable technology for the efficient utilization of solar energy in a cost-efficient way."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All reagents used in the experiment were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Acetone, methanol, hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethyl alcohol, alpha-Terpineol and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. LTD. Nickel foam were purchased from Shanghai yinfu hardware products co. LTD. Commercial TiO2 P25 was purchased from Evonik Degussa Corp. Water used in experiments was de-ionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm."
3,Materials preparation,"2.2 Materials preparation Flowchart for the preparation process of plate catalyst using commercial P25 as precursor can be found in Fig. 1 . At first, nickel foam was cut into square shapes with a certain size, and then put into a beaker and treated by acetone for half an hour. After that, nickel foam was washed three times using de-ionized water which was then washed with 3 M hydrochloric acid for half an hour under ultrasonic condition. Next, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven for 8 h at 80 °C. The sample sheets were then taken out and were punched through the puncher into circular wafers with diameter of 1 cm. In order to fix TiO2 particles onto the Nickel foam substrate, 0.1 g PVB was used as adhesive agent which was well mixed with 2 g TiO2 through the mortar. Then 2 mL of alpha-terpineol solvent was added to immerse the powder. It was then stirred vigorously for 30 min to evenly mix the binder with the catalyst. Following that, TiO2 catalyst was uniformly coated on the surface of the foamed nickel by a brush, and then the sample was sheared to wafers under the help of the track we had made. Finally, they were transferred to hot plate annealed for 20 min at 180 °C to remove the organic solvents. The final products were then collected for further characterization and photocatalytic activity measurements. Besides of that, other physical and chemical properties of P25 can be found in literature [32]."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystallographic structure and some information on the chemical composition of the composite particles were identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at a scanning rate of 10°/min. The wavelength range of light is measured by fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec-Mini2048CL) made in Beijing avanti technology co. LTD. The micromorphology of the samples was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM7800F, JEOL, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, G2F30, FEI, USA). The contact angle study was performed based on a contact angle meter (SL200B, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology Apparatus Co. Ltd, China) by using sitting drop method. An Anton Paar MCR302 rheometer (Graz, Austria) has been used for the rheology measurement. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were tested by a HITACHI U4100 instrument equipped with a labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were detected by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Japan) using a monochromatic Al Kα line source (hν = 1486.69 eV) under dark condition. All the binding energy calibrations were conducted according to the adventitious C 1s peak of carbon at 284.8 eV as reference. UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectra were collected by a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent). The movie of the H2 bubbles evolution during hydrogen production recorded by a high-speed video camera. The in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed on a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer with the microwave frequency of 9.40 GHz at room temperature. The magnetic parameters of the radicals detected were obtained from direct measurements of the magnetic field and the microwave frequency."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical properties of photocatalysts were measured in a three-electrode cell, in which a Pt plate as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and an FTO glass loaded with the catalyst or prepared TiO2@Nickel foam as working electrode. Na2SO4 (0.5 M, pH = 6.8) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The transient photocurrent densities were recorded with an applied voltage of 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. The working electrode was prepared as follows. The mixture suspension including corresponding photocatalyst powders (5 mg), deionized water (0.6 ml), ethanol (1.4 ml) and Nafion solutions (200 μL, DuPont D1020, 10 wt%) was sonicated for 40 min for a well dispersed suspension. The obtained dispersion mixture (200 μL) was dropped on the FTO glass (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) uniformly, and then naturally dried at room temperature overnight."
6,Evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.5 Evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production test was carried out in a small home-made spotlight reactor, SLR in abbreviation, as showed in Fig. 2 a. It mainly consists of spotlight, upper cover plate, high glass window, gasket, outlet, bolt, pedestal, base, sweeping entrance and sample stage. Fig. 2b presents the real reactor in our lab and enlarged schematic diagram of sample stage was described in Fig. 2c, in which the spotlight can expose to plate TiO2@Nickel foam uniformly. More detailed parameters were showed in Table.S1 in supporting information. Moreover, A 450 mw/cm2 LED spotlight (wavelength∼365 nm) was equipped as the simulated light source. The produced gas was sampled with a syringe and quantitatively analyzed on a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatograph (NaX zeolite column, Ar as a carrier gas) every 60 min. In a typical photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction, 28 mg photocatalyst loaded on nickel foam was immersed in 2 ml aqueous solution containing certain 10% volume fraction of methanol as sacrificial reagent. The reaction solution was bubbled with Ar for 10 min to completely remove the dissolved oxygen before the photocatalytic test. In addition, in order to compare the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production in spotlight and non-spotlight reaction, in which the light density is obviously different, a controlled experiment was carried out in a quartz glass suspension photocatalytic reactor, SPR in abbreviation, which was irradiated by 300 mw/cm2 Xenon lamp with a bandpass filter with center wavelength also around 365 nm. What’s more, the reaction suspension was continuously stirred by a stirrer to prevent the precipitation of catalyst. The identical 28 mg catalyst was dispersed into 60 mL aqueous solution, other steps including measuring the gas product are the same as above. It was worth noting here that the wavelength range of incident light for the both reactors are measured to be around 365 nm by a fiber optic spectrometer as shown by the Fig.S1 in supporting information. It can effectively avoid the deviation induced by the difference in incident light. Moreover, the comparison of main parameters between SLR and SPR system are also listed in Table.S2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Morphologies, structure, and optical analysis","3.1 Morphologies, structure, and optical analysis X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was utilized to explore the crystal phase of the obtained products. The XRD patterns of P25 are shown in Fig. 3 a. It could be concluded that commercial tianium dioxide is mainly composed of two phases of anatase and rutile according to PDF#21–1272 and 21#1276 [33,34]. When 2θ = 25.28°, 38.57°, 48.05°, 55.06°, 62.69°, 68.76°, 70.3°, 75.03°, they were corresponded to the lattice plane (110), (112), (200), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215) of anatase TiO2 respectively. Moreover, there are other peaks in the pattern for 2θ = 27.45°, 36.08°, 54.32°, 76.5°, which correspond to the lattice plane (110),(101),(211),(202) of rutile TiO2 respectively [35]. Fig. 3b shows the XRD pattern of plate catalyst before and after the reaction in spotlight reactor for 20 h under 450 wm/cm2 irradiation. As reported in other literature, nickel oxide tends to form on the surface of nickel foam at normal temperature or during high temperature treatment, especially for the parts of nickel foam exposed to the air, and it’s easy to form a p-n junction with TiO2 due to their close physical contact [36,37]. In the pattern, the planes (111) and (220) could be found at 2θ = 37.4°, 62.8°. According to the PDF#47–1049, those were ascribed to the crystal orientations of NiO. Clearly surface of Ni foam has been partially oxided. The existence of NiO could impede transfer of photo-generated electron from TiO2 to Ni metal and improve the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts. Furthermore, owing to the low electrical conductivity of unexcited TiO2 and existence of large PVB molecules in interlayers, metal Ni could not well accept electrons, so the residual non-oxidized 3D nickel foam served mainly as support [38–41]. The SEM and TEM results of TiO2 and nickel foam were showed in Fig. 4 . The Fig. 4a shows the overall appearance of TiO2 nanoparticles with the average ball particle size of around the 25 nm. In the Fig. 4b, the porous network structure of nick foam is presented. The inner diameter of the hole is about 100 μm and this structure apparently facilitates the fixation of the catalyst in the foamed nickel and helpful for the multiple usage. The surface topography of catalyst sheet after filled with TiO2 catalyst can be found in Fig. 4c. It can be seen that the surface of the entire catalyst sheet is uneven which is assumed to be favorable for reflection and multiple utilization of light on the surface [42]. In addition, there are many gaps between catalyst and foam nickel, which is supposed to be very helpful for the transportation, absorption and subsequent reaction of water and CH3OH molecules in the channel and the overflow of bubbles inside [16]. Fig. 4d shows the sectional view of plate catalyst, it could be concluded that after coating, the hollow structure in the foamed nickel was substantially filled. Fig. 4e and f present the TEM images of commercial TiO2. The obvious lattice spacing, such as 0.352 nm, 0.233 nm, 0.128 nm, 0.325 nm and 0.248 nm have been attributed to the lattice planes (101) (112) and (215) of anatase TiO2 and (110) (101) of rutile TiO2, respectively. Fig. .4g–j presents the EDX mappings of TiO2 loaded on nickel foam. The atomic percent of Ti, O, Ni are shown in Fig. 4k. Combined with results of XRD (Fig. 3b), it can be calculated that a fraction of metal Ni has been oxidized into NiO on the surface of sample in the air [37]. The light absorption properties of TiO2 and TiO2@Nickel foam were then analyzed by ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra. Specifically, pure TiO2 powder was tested by absorbance directly, while, absorbance of TiO2 with same quality coated on Nickel foam was obtained by 1-R-T, in which R is the reflectance and T is transmittance. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the optical absorbance of sample ranges from 200 nm to 420nm, indicating that TiO2 can be photoactived fully by UV-light illumination. After loaded on the Nickel foam, the edge of absorption curve has an obvious red shift which might be caused by special physical surface structure or formation of heterojunction between TiO2 and NiO on the surface. This is beneficial for photocatalytic reaction. The band gaps of the TiO2 and TiO2@Nickel foam were calculated on the basis of the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) equation Eq. (1). (1) αhv = A ( h v − E g ) n / 2 in which, α, h, v, A, and Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, high frequency, proportionality constant, and band-gap energy, respectively [13]. The Eg of TiO2 and TiO2@Nickel foam was estimated to be 3.25eV and 3.1eV, respectively, as presented in Fig. 5b. It also indicated that TiO2 loading on the Nickel foam could form TiO2/NiO heterojunction with NiO on the surface of nickel foam, thereby reducing the band gap width comparing to the pure TiO2, which is beneficial for a wider absorption spectra."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and stability,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and stability The activities of hydrogen evolution reaction in SPR and SLR over TiO2 at room temperature can be found in Fig. 6 a. The average hydrogen production rate (HER) was 0.0836 μmol/gcat·h in the SPR under normalized irradiation of per mw/cm2. Surprisingly, the average HER was 0.22 μmol/gcat·h in SLR, which is ca. 2.66 times of the former. Even though the existence of PVB could lead to smaller TiO2 surface area and possibly decreased effect of heterojunction over TiO2/NiO, its amount is only 5 wt% comparing to the mass of TiO2, so we believe that its shielding effect will not be significant. Most importantly, in SPR reactor, only TiO2 takes part in the photocatalytic reaction. While, in SLR nickel foam is not only a supporting substrate, it also forms heterojunction with TiO2 due to its partially oxidized surface (Fig. 3b). Moreover, it should be noted that the light source intensity of SLR is 450 mw/cm2, 1.5 times of the SPR which is 300 mw/cm2, and under common consensus, the hydrogen production rate might have linear relationship with light intensity [43]. What’s more, it is traditionally accepted that the utilization efficiency of the photocatalyst film for the light source is much lower than that of the suspended photocatalytic system, on account of that only the surface layer of the photocatalyst film can be irradiated by light source. However, in the suspension system, the light that is irradiated to the reaction flask can be sufficiently absorbed by the catalyst because the light will continuously reflect and refract between the catalyst particles which also have very high surface area [9,17,18]. Nevertheless, it’s surprising that the actual rate of hydrogen production over SPR is much higher than expected and also shows obvious advantages compared with the reported works (Table.S3), which obviously worth more in-depth investigations. In addition, the hydrogen production comparison under different light intensities in SLR and SPR is summarized by Fig.S2 in the supporting information, even at lower light intensity, hydrogen production in SLR has a certain advantage than SPR reactor. In order to test the stability of catalyst plate after multi-recovery in the spotlight reactor, it was repeatedly used after each run of reaction, and then dried in oven at 80 °C for 1 h for the next round of reaction. As shown in Fig. 6b, after the fourth run of use, the average H2 evolution rate is still 0.191μmol/gcat·h per mw/cm2. It indicated that photocatalytic performance just decreased by about 12% after 3 days. The little deactivation may be attributed to the fact that during the immersion process, the aqueous solution enters the nickel foam and causes some of the catalyst to fall off during reaction. Neverthless, the generally improved performance over the plate catalyst suggested that great reduction of the recovery cost of the catalyst, and the steady photocatalytic performance can be achieved by robust decoration of photocatalyst on nickel foam."
10,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis Aiming to figure out the chemical state and chemical composition change of the catalyst surface after the photocatalytic reaction in the spotlight reactor, the comparison of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) between plate TiO2 catalyst on nickel foam and pure samples after reaction in spotlight reactor for 20 h under 450wm/cm2 irradiation was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . The peaks of all elements were based on C1s = 284.8eV, high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p over TiO2@nickel and pure TiO2 as can be seen in Fig. 7a, the doublet at 458.6 eV and 464.61 eV relate to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 [44–46], respectively, supporting the presence of Ti4+. Two similar peaks can also be observed by at binding energy of 458.8eV and 464.7eV, which shift to higher energy by 0.2 eV and 0.09 respectively. In the O1s spectrum, the binding energies at 529.4 eV and 532.2 eV correspond to Ti–O lattice oxygen of Ti4+-O in TiO2 and surface-adsorbed hydroxyl groups on pure TiO2, respectively [47]. Interestingly, after loaded on Nickel foam, two peaks at 529.7eV and 532.2eV were still detected. The binding energy of Ti4+-O exhibits positive change by 0.3eV, indicating there is indeed electron transfer between the two materials [30]. The analysis of Ni element is shown in Fig. 7c. Two sharp peaks at binding energies of 855.3eV and 874eV can be related to Ni2+ in NiO, the broad peaks at 861.0eV and 879.3eV in both two patterns could be the satellite peaks of Ni 2p [48]. Furthermore, compared with TiO2@Nickel foam, two doublet peaks were also found at 854.1eV and 860.1eV for Ni 2p3/2, 871.7eV and 878.6eV for Ni 2p1/2. Obviously, they all have a tendency of blue shift after loaded on Nickel foam, which suggests the total electron density shifts from the TiO2 phase to the NiO phase and thus causes the formation of Ni–Ti–O covalent bonds between two phases."
11,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical properties In order to figure out carrier transport characteristics and electrochemical characteristics of materials after loaded on Nickel foam, transient photocurrent density, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 8 a, under same measurement conditions, TiO2@Nickel foam has larger photocurrent density than the pure TiO2, which means that separation efficiency of electrons and holes was higher on TiO2@Nickel foam [49]. In the pattern of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 8b), the curve of TiO2@Nickel has a lower slope, indicating their higher carrier concentration and the faster carrier transfer properties, which could contribute to the enhanced activity for photocatalystic H2 production [50]. The Mott-Schottky results are presented in Fig. 8c. When loaded on the Nickel foam, the TiO2@Nickel has more negative flat band potential than original TiO2. Generally, the more negative flat band potential of semiconductor electrode leads to the band bend upward, which indicates the stronger redox ability to drive the reaction [51]. The better redox performance leads to better H2 production performance. The chopped linear sweep voltammetry for the two samples were also investigated from −0.2 V- 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under sweep speed of 10 mv/s (Fig.S6). It can be seen that under same bias voltage TiO2@Nickel has lager current intensity then pure TiO2. Moreover, the former has big step current change between light on and light off cases. It means that it possesses faster separating efficiency of electrons and holes than pure TiO2. Combined with the Photoelectrochemical measurements and previous analysis, we could conclude that due to the close contact, p-type nickel oxide and n-type titanium dioxide has formed an effective heterojunction [52,53], which reduces the rate of electron-hole recombination. At the same time, it can reduce the conduction of more electrons to metallic nickel, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity."
12,Effect of optical density on hydrogen production,"3.5 Effect of optical density on hydrogen production For the purpose of exploring other reasons why the photocatalytic activity in this SLR is higher than that of SPR, we tried to qualitatively control the intensity of the incident light and investigated its relationship with photocatalytic activity. To achieve this aim, the distances between the light source and the reactor has been changed between 3 and 6 cm, which was expected to correspondingly adjust the intensity of the incident light [17,54]. As a result, all the other experimental conditions were kept unchanged and only the light intensity was adjusted. According to the literature, the actual light intensity on the surface of the catalyst is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp source [30]. The relation is expressed by Eq.(2), in which H c is the average irradiance of light on the catalyst surface(W·m−2), P lamp is the emitted radiant power of the lamp (W) and l is the distance from lamp to the catalyst surface (m). (2) H c = p l a m p l 2 According to this formula, the illumination distances of 4, 5 cm and 6 cm correspond to light intensity of 253.1mw/cm2, 162.0 mw/cm2 and 116.5 mw/cm2, respectively. Fig. 9 a shows the changes of hydrogen production over time at different optical densities, and calculated rates were marked accordingly. The visualized trend could refer to Fig. 9b. It can be concluded that higher optical density greatly promotes hydrogen production in the SLR (different growth rates are marked as slopes of orange and purple lines in the figure). Similar trend has been reported by Mi et al. which has been attributed to light band flatting effect [31]. It has been reported that at very high light intensities, the reaction may change to an exponential increase for multi electron transfer reactions, highlighting the importance of charge accumulation [55]."
13,The rheological properties of the reaction system on the hydrogen production,"3.6 The rheological properties of the reaction system on the hydrogen production It is well known that for photocatalytic reaction at solid/liquid interface, it included diffusion and absorption of reactant molecules, chemical reaction and then desorption which are accompanying with the nucleation, growth, separation of the bubbles [1]. Apparently, the physical nature of the interface between the catalyst substrate and the reaction liquid, such as hydrophilicity, is expected to have a large effect on the behavior of the bubbles during hydrogen production. Accordingly, different contact angles of solid-liquid interface were investigated using sitting drop method. As shown in Fig. 10 a, black line, red line and blue line represent the cases for water dripped on the pure nickel foam, TiO2@nickel foam and water with 10 vol% methanol dripped on the TiO2@nickel foam, respectively. Other experimental conditions, including ambient temperature, total droplet volume, etc. remain unchanged. It could be found that contact angle became smaller when TiO2 was added to nickel foam or reaction liquid with methanol participation. Among them, reaction liquid with 10 vol% methanol showed the smallest contact angle. This result is supposed to be caused by lower surface energy on the surface of TiO2, easy to absorb molecules in air, and even irradiated by the UV light over the plate which generates more oxygen vacancies and then increase of hydrophilicity of TiO2 surface [10]. On the other side, the presence of hydroxyl groups in methanol also had great advantage. The attraction of water on the surface of super-hydrophilic micro-nano structures generally exhibit robust repellence to the bubbles under water [56–60]. So that the detachment speed of bubbles during hydrogen production will increase, which had great contribution for hydrogen production (Bubble generation and detachment process can refer to supporting information.movie). As proposed by our previous report, the hydrogen molecules produced by photocatalysis will undergo a diffusion process in the reaction solution [61]. As shown by the Stokes law in Eq. (3), (3) F = 6 πμuR where F(N) is resistance of bubbles during float in the reaction liquid, μ(Pa·s) is viscosity of the reaction solution, u(m/s) is speed relative to the liquid, R(m) is radius of bubble. It could be known the resistance is closely related to the viscosity of the solution. Fig. 10b shows the viscosity plot of different methanol volume fractions in reaction liquid at 25 °C. In the presence of sacrificial agent, reaction liquid with 10 vol% methanol had the lowest viscosity, it meant that hydrogen bubbles had the minimal diffusion resistance in solution. This is obviously advantageous to promote the overall hydrogen production rate."
14,Mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity,"To figure out if this heterojunction belongs to TypeⅡor direct Z-scheme, in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of DMPO-.OH measured in aqueous suspensions of the materials and DMPO-.O2 − measured in methanol suspension were carried out. As shown in Fig.S5, the obvious characteristic peaks were found over TiO2/NiO in OH and O2- detection under Xenon lamp’s irradiation. It could be speculated that TiO2/NiO after combined should have more positive potential than 2.4 eV vs. NHE (PH = 7). So the traditional TypeⅡheterojunction between TiO2 and NiO could not be applied to explain this phenomenon because 0.5 eV vs. NHE (PH = 7) potential will be obtained under this assumption which is not positive enough to oxidize H2O to OH. Therefore, it should be a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism for TiO2 and NiO contact to accelerate separation of electrons and holes [62–64]. Furthermore, to make certain the role of sacrificial reagent using methanol, the gases collected by sweeping reaction mixture using Ar gas for 10 min referring to experimental method by Al-Madanat et al. [65] and liquid products after 1-h reaction were analyzed, as shown in Fig.S7 and Table.S4. Only about 0.028 vol% CO2 and no CO were observed. It suggests that our reaction does not belong to photocatalytic methanol reforming (Eq.S1∼ Eq.S8) because in that case the mole ratio of H2 and CO2 will close to 3:1, and very small or no HCOH and HCOOH could be found in liquid phase [66]. It could also be found that main products of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol could be formaldehyde and formic acid at low amount of methanol using as sacrificial reagent to offer H atoms and electrons [67,68] and H2 is mainly produced by the reduction of protons originating from water as evinced by isotopic study (Eq.S9 ∼ Eq.S16) [69]. In Fig.S8, very small amount of formate species but large amount of CH3OH were found in reaction liquid. It means that formaldehyde in the reaction liquid cannot be oxidized in quantity to formate species in the presence of CH3OH which possesses high reducing ability. So it could be concluded that catalyst surface will not be inactivated due to accumulated formate species [70]. Based on above analysis, the possible reaction mechanism for the significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production was proposed. As shown in Fig. 11 , in this small spotlight reactor, the light induced flatting effect under high energy flux density results in higher electronics utilization and a direct Z-scheme heterojunction of TiO2/NiO increases electron-hole pair separation efficiency, more specifically, the holes of NiO are transferred frequently to conductive band of TiO2 and combined with electrons, next, holes of TiO2 will be rapidly consumed by sacrificial agent methanol, so that electrons of NiO which have more negative potential to reduce water, which are beneficial to the increase of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In addition, unlike suspension systems, the uneven surface of nickel foam after catalyst coating is helpful for the multi-reflection of incident light to enhance light utilization. What is more, the increase of hydrophilicity for the nickel form supported photocatalyst plate and the decrease of reaction fluid viscosity were found to favorable for desorption and diffusion of bubbles, which further enhance the efficiency. From molecular level, the partial oxidation of the foamed nickel surface leads to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction between nickel oxide and attached titanium dioxide, preventing electrons from migrating to metallic nickel and reducing the recombination of holes and electrons. All these factors combined leads to the improvement of photocatalytic performance in our small spotlight reactor."
15,Conclusion,"In this work, we report for the first time a steady and recyclable solar photocatalytic hydrogen production in spotlight reactor based on titanium dioxide stabilized on nickel foam prepared via simple coating method. It is surprising that the hydrogen production rate in our reactor is ca. 2.66 times of the suspended system under the equivalent irradiation intensity. After full characterization, it turned out that the increase of hydrophilicity for the nickel form supported photocatalyst plate and the decrease of reaction fluid viscosity were favorable for desorption and diffusion of bubbles. Moreover, the light induced flatting effect under high energy flux density over the direct Z-scheme TiO2/NiO heterojunction of the photocatalyst plate were essential for the high activity and avoiding the reduction of NiO to Ni metal during reaction is important for the stability of the reaction system. All these factors combined leads to the improvement of photocatalytic performance in our small spotlight reactor. We believe our experimental design could also be a practically viable route for the efficient utilization of solar energy in a cost-efficient way."
