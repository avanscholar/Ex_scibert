0,Introduction,"MOF structures are composed of metals ions or clusters connected to organic ligands to form extended 1, 2 or 3-dimensional networks via coordinate bonds with large pore volumes and high inner surface areas [1]. Due to their high inner surface area, uniform pore size and high thermal and mechanical stabilities MOFs are attractive for gas storage [2,3] separation, purification [4] and catalysis applications [5]. MOFs are often compared to zeolites due to their large internal surface areas, extensive porosity, high degree of crystallinity, and they have been utilized for same applications. Many studies have demonstrated that MOFs possess superior sorption properties than other porous material [6]. Recently several MOFs were developed for chemical sensor applications. Upon adsorption and desorption of gas molecules the changes in physical material properties can be detected by various methods such as resistivity measurements, conductivity measurements, mass and dielectric permittivity change [6–8]. Achmann et al. [9] studied different concentrations of humidity in the gas by measuring the electric properties of the materials caused by adsorption or desorption of molecules on the inner surface of a MOF. Zn-btc (Zn3(btc)2·12H2O; btc =1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) was first reported in 1996 by Yaghi et al. [10] who elucidated the crystal structure of the compound Co3(btc)2·12H2O. Later Majumder et al. [9] proved that Zn3 (btc)2·12H2O is isotypic to the cobalt compound by single crystal structure determination. In Zn-btc, each Zn2+ ion in the framework is coordinated by four water molecules showing extensive hydrogen bonding among each other and to the carboxylate groups of the btc units thereby stabilizing the framework. It has been shown that the framework compound can interact with small molecules like ammonia [11] or dimethylamine [12]. Most studies about Zn based MOFs as chemical sensors concentrate on a change of the luminescence properties as a size selective operation mechanism. For the first time, we studied Zn-btc MOF for the concentration dependent detection of alcohol vapours by measuring the work function of the material. Work function change readout is a promising method and demonstrates several features such as low power consumption, the applicability at different temperature range and from the sensitivity to both physisorption and chemisorption. A change in the work function provides information for a better understanding of the interaction between gas molecule and the sensing layer."
1,Material and methods,
2,MOF synthesis and layer preparation,"2.1 MOF synthesis and layer preparation All chemicals were obtained commercially (Sigma–Aldrich) and used without further purification. Zn-btc MOF was synthesized based on literature procedure [10,11]. TiN sputtered on Al2O3 substrates were used as sensing layer. MOF material dispersed in a water and drop coated on substrates by using the dip coating method [13]."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) The Zn-btc was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The powdered samples were glued on a foil of polyvinyl acetate and X-ray powder diffraction data recorded on a STADIP diffractometer (STOE, Darmstadt, Germany) using copper radiation (Kα1; λ =1. 5406Å), with a wide range (0–130°) image plate detector with 0.02° resolution. 2.2.2 Thermal investigation and morphology Specific surface area and pore size distribution were estimated from N2 adsorption/desorption measurements performed at 77K on a Soptomatic 1990 instrument (Thermo Scientific GmbH, Germany). The sample powder was degassed for 5h at 363K and 5mm Hg. The BET surface area was calculated from adsorption branches in the relative pressure range 0.05–0.3 and 0.05–0.2, respectively. The total pore volume was estimated from the amount of adsorbed gas at a relative pressure of 0.99. The thermal degradation of the material was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) with a Netzsch STA 409 simultan thermal analyzer (Netzsch, Selb, Germany). The measurements were carried out in a nitrogen stream with a heating rate of 10°C/min from 50°C to 650°C. The as prepared MOF film was studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Quanta 250 FEG ESEM). 2.2.3 Gas measurements with Kelvin-probe method In order to readout change in work function, the Kelvin method is used. Work function measurements were performed as described in literature [14]. Target gases (specified concentrations of test gases in carrier gases like synthetic air or N2) were purchased from Linde Gas (Pullach, Germany). The test gases were monohydric alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol."
4,Results and discussion,
5,"PXRD, morphology and structure of Zn-btc","3.1 PXRD, morphology and structure of Zn-btc Comparison of the measured PXRD pattern of the synthesized Zn-btc MOF with one calculated structure data from Majunder et al. (Zn3(btc)2·12H2O, space group C2, a =17,413(5)Å, b =12,944Å; c =6585Å, β =111, 89°) shows excellent congruence and thereby prove identity and phase purity of the material (Fig. 1 ). Interaction of alcohols with the sensor material on the molecular level is thereby discussed on the basis of the given structure data [10]. The organic link btc reacts with Zinc(II) acetate hydrate to form Zn3(btc)2·12H2O. In these MOF compound one-dimensional branched zigzag chains build of btc units at the vertices and zinc ions are coordinated by the carboxylate unit of btc in the linear parts and the branches (Fig. 2a). Each metal ion is octahedrally bonded to six oxygen atoms, two from btc carboxylate groups and four from water ligands. There are two crystallographically distinct Zn atoms (Zn1 and Zn2). Zn1 situated at the branches of the zigzag chains and the carboxylate oxygens come from the same group (bidentate) while for Zn2 located in linear part of the chains they come from two different carboxylate groups (both monodentate) (Fig. 2c and d). The octahedral coordination around Zn1 on the special site shows stronger distortion than around Zn2. The zigzag chains run in [101] direction and adjacent parallel chains in [010] directions are connected via hydrogen bonds to form slightly corrugated sheets (Fig. 2a). The sheets are stacked in [001] direction with a shift of a/2 as a part of the C-centering vector allowing the sheets to form multiple hydrogen bonds, while the nonpolar benzene rings align nearly parallel in [001] direction and partially overlap (Fig. 2b). Majumder et al. [11] stated significant π…π interactions between the stacked benzene rings with a CC distance of 3.28Å. So the structure is divided in a hydrophilic three-dimensional framework build from Zn2+ ions octahedral coordinated by carboxylate groups and water interrupted by hydrophobic rods resulting from a stacking of benzene rings of the btc units along [001]. At ambient conditions with 12 water molecules per formula unit the structure of Zn-btc leaves small voids, too small to accommodate any further water or other small molecules and an interaction of the solid with gas molecules under preservation of the framework structure is only possible either removal of the water or replace by solvent molecule or substitution of water molecules coordinating to the zinc atoms. Yaghi et al. [10] explained that the water molecules are repeatable and reversible bond with MOF. Thermal gravimetric measurement (Fig. 3a) shows weight loss in two major steps. Up to 100°C weight remains constant then a beginning weight loss shows that the coordinated water is going to be removed until 160°C while in a second step starting from 400°C the organic linker of the framework is irreversibly degraded and crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) is obtained at about 550°C. Yaghi et al. [10] already observed for the Co-compound that 11 of the 12 water molecules can be reversibly removed up to 345°C and the framework rebuilds after cooling down to room temperature and exposure to normal humid air. The interaction of gas molecules with MOFs is often interpreted in terms of so-called open metal sites suggesting a removal of coordinating water molecules from the metal ions by increasing temperature or applying vacuum. While the occurrence of open metal sites may be well pronounced for discussing interaction mechanisms in two- and three-dimensional MOFs with rigid frameworks and big pore sizes, in the case of Zn-btc the preservation of the framework after removal of the water is less likely since the one-dimensional structure with a higher degree of freedom is expected to undergo structural changes to avoid energetically unfavourable low-coordinated metal ions and also to diminish the pore sizes. The stability of the coordinated water up to 110°C in dry nitrogen is in accordance with the high degree of hydrogen bonding in the structure. The as-synthesized film is shown in Fig. 3b demonstrating that dense and homogeneous films have been formed on the surface (Fig. 3b). The N2 adsorption/desorption measurements of Zn-btc BET surface area are 848m2/g (Fig. 3c)."
6,Kelvin probe measurements of Zn-btc,"3.2 Kelvin probe measurements of Zn-btc Work function based gas sensing measurements of Zn-btc MOF thin films towards methanol, ethanol and propanol were performed in humid and dry air. We used different conditions one is using synthetic air (80% N2, 20% O2) with 30% relative humidity and the other one is using nitrogen at room temperature (25°C) and a total gas flow rate of 1l/min. Gas sensing results of Zn-btc are shown in Fig. 4a–c. Fig. 4a shows the work function change of Zn-btc with humid air, variation of relative humidity. Fig. 4b shows the work function change of the sample towards different alcohols concentration at 40% relative humidity and Fig. 4c shows the work function change of the sample towards different alcohols concentration in dry air at room temperature. Work function change results of Zn-btc MOF sensing layer show higher response in dry air compared to humid air. Exposure to methanol shows only small changes compared with propanol. Therefore, the work function change response to alcohols is dependent on concentration, atmospheric conditions and the size of the alcohol (increasing from methanol to ethanol to propanol)."
7,Alcohols gas sensing mechanism with Zn-btc,"3.3 Alcohols gas sensing mechanism with Zn-btc Since the numerous hydrogen bonding interactions between the Zn-coordinated water molecules and carboxylate groups seem to be an important structure stabilizing factor we think that for Zn3(btc)2·12H2O an extensive liberation of water molecules producing an open framework with open metal sites as stated by Yaghi is less pronounced at ambient conditions (room temperature, atmospheric pressure). Together with the finding, that the pores in the fully hydrated structure are too small for an incorporation of additional small molecules [10,11], we propose an exchange mechanism for the interaction of alcohols with Zn-btc (Eq. (1)). (1) (btc)(H2O)3Zn-(OH)2 +R-OH⇄(btc) (H2O)3 Zn-(OHR)+H-OH For the prediction of the position of equilibrium of this ligand exchange reaction the different possible interactions have to been taken into account: First the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (ROH) can be expected to form a coordinative bond with the zinc ion and with a higher bond stability of Zn2+-OHR compared to Zn2+-OH since alcohols show a higher basicity compared to water. Nevertheless Sudbrake et al. [15] found that the homoleptic alcoholate complexes [Zn(OHR)6]X2 (R=Me, Et; X=ClO4 −, BF4 − and SiF6 −) with octahedrally coordinated [Zn(OHR)6]2+ ions are highly moisture sensitive and unstable relative to [Zn(OH2)6]2+. The authors explained this property by the loss of hydrogen bonds when going from water with two hydrogen atoms to an alcohol with only one hydrogen atom and the gain in entropy upon the release of the alcohol ligands. In coordination compounds with bigger organic ligands like btc showing nonpolar hydrophobic regions like aromatic rings the accommodation of alcohols with their nonpolar alkyl chains can be favoured by van der Waals interactions since the system can diminish energy when equilibrium goes to the right side (Eq. (1)). An example is the stable three-dimensional MOF compound Zn2(btc)(NO3)(H2O)(C2H5OH)5 where three of the five ethanol molecules are coordinated to one of the zinc ions and the alkyl chains located in voids between the btc units [16]. The voids in these compounds are even big enough to accommodate additional ethanol molecules. The compound Zn2(bdc)2(ted) (bdc: benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate; ted: triethylenediamine) shows an even higher affinity for methanol and ethanol than water and is a prospective membrane material for the production of bioethanol [17]. The structure differs from Zn-btc in showing Zn2(bdc)4/2 paddlewheel structure elements and due to the lack of free coordination sites water or alcohol molecules cannot be bonded directly to Zn2+ but are accommodated in the much bigger voids present in the structure. DFT calculations performed by de Lima et al. [18] revealed a stabilization of the alcohol molecules compared to water by a combination of hydrogen bonding between alcohol hydroxyl and bdc carboxylate groups and London Dispersion interactions between the alcohol alkyl chain and bdc phenyl rings. For Zn-btc bigger voids are absent so under this conditions the equilibrium (Eq. (1)) is expected to be located strongly on the left but can be shifted depending on concentration and chemical nature of the gas species. The results in Fig. 4 show that the measured work function changes largely depend on the size, atmospheric condition and concentration of gas. As we already discussed above zinc atoms are bonded to carboxylate oxygen atoms of the btc units at two coordination sites leaving the remaining sites for four associated water ligands per metal ion completing the octahedral coordination. The positively charged metal ions provide hydrophilic sites to attract negative polarizes oxygen atoms of water or alcohols (Fig. 5 ) or alternatively ammonia [11] or ammines [12]. As a counterpart the aromatic ring of the organic btc ligand provides a hydrophobic region that can accommodate the alkyl chains of the alcohols but not the remaining proton of water or alcohols. The work function change increases when going from methanol to propanol in spite of the expectation that the accommodation of the higher alcohols with longer alkyl chains in the quite dense solid state structure is more difficult. But it can be rationalized that longer alkyl chains can bend easily towards the phenyl rings thereby increasing the van der Waals interactions between the guest molecule and the hydrophobic part of the btc linker. That means, higher alcohols can interact both through their hydroxyl groups with the zinc metal cation (coordinative bond), and through the alkyl chains with phenyl rings (van der Waals interaction). Since the electronic states at the Fermi level of the sensitive layer material are presumably constituted by occupied π-orbitals of the btc linker, the approach of the alkyl groups to the phenyl rings also may be responsible for the change of the work function. Thereby the more difficult incorporation of the higher alcohols in Zn-btc may be compensated by a much stronger influence on the π-orbitals of the btc linker and thereby the Fermi level and the work function change measured. Here it is supposed that the work function change of the alcohols not only depends on the hydrophilic nature of metal but also on the organic linker part of the Zn-btc structure. Humidity influences the work function change (ΔΦ) signal height (Fig. 5). Work function change results of Zn-btc MOF sensing layer show good response in dry air compared to humid air. This can be explained easily by Eq. (1). An enhanced partial pressure of water shifts the equilibrium to the left while lowering the partial pressure near to zero (dry air) shifts the equilibrium to the right and coordinated water molecules can be easier exchanged by alcohol."
8,Conclusion,"For the first time Zn3(btc)2·12H2O (Zn-btc) MOF studied for the detection of alkyl chain alcohol by measuring the work function changes (Kelvin probe). It was shown that Zn-btc can detect alcohols under both humid and dry atmosphere. The signal height of the work function depends on both the alkyl chain length and the concentration of the alcohols. A possible host guest interaction mechanism was derived from crystal structure considerations. The metal ions (Zn2+) in the crystal structure act as specific adsorption sites for molecules with strong donor functions like alcohol oxygen or amine nitrogen atoms. Since the structure lacks of appreciable pores, alcohol molecules can be only chemically adsorbed by a ligand exchange mechanism in the coordination sphere of Zn2+ thereby releasing bonded water molecules. The unfavourable loss of hydrogen bonds by substituting water against alcohol may be compensated by van der Waals interactions between alcohol alkyl chains and the phenyl rings of the btc units as the hydrophobic regions. Concentration dependence of the work function change and influence of humidity on the sensing signal can be explained by shifting the equilibrium of the ligand exchange reaction depending on the partial pressures of alcohol and water. Further investigation will be undertaken to find experimental proofs of the proposed adsorption mechanism and to calculate adsorption enthalpies by advanced DFT methods."
