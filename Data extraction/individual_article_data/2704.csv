0,Introduction,"The growing demand for energy, the inadequacy of petroleum and environmental concerns due to the consumption of conventional fuels have led to the unquestionable need for substitute fuels. Therefore, investigations in environmentally friendly energy sources are vital. Nowadays, numerous alternative fuels have been considered such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [1–3], compressed natural gas (CNG) [4,5], hydrogen (H2) [6–9], and biodiesel [10–12]. Among several alternative fuels, hydrogen is an attractive fuel in view of its unlimited source and uncontaminated burning features. Hydrogen is a fuel with a short combustion period and without carbon element, which depletes GHG emissions [6]. In addition, fast burning velocity and wide flammability range of hydrogen permit high-speed engine operation, which results in raised engine power and efficiency [13]. Recently, investigation on applying hydrogen enrichment in diesel engine over a wide range of fuel-air mixtures has come into prominence due to its complete combustion [6]. D'Andrea et al. [7] conducted an experimental investigation on the 66% (by volume) addition of hydrogen to a gasoline-fuelled engine. The experiment results showed that hydrogen fraction in the blend reduced the combustion duration, improved the power output, and increased NO emissions. In another research, Szwaja et al. [8] and Yousefi et al. [9] found improvements on the engine performance and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE). Additionally, reduction in ignition delay with various hydrogen volumetric fractions’ added to diesel fuel was observed; however, a heavy combustion knock was observed by adding high volume fractions of hydrogen. Masood et al. [14] considered the effect of injected hydrogen on the combustion and performance of CI diesel engine. They found that BTE and engine pressure were higher when hydrogen was injected in the induction system compared with to the direct injection setting. Soberanis et al. [15] experimentally investigated the best conditions of the ratio-mixtures and cooling systems in the CI engines fuelled by mixtures of air-hydrogen. In their study, the disadvantages of integration of hydrogen as a fuel, including pre-ignition, spontaneous ignition, knocking, and backfire were examined. The result revealed that due to a higher temperature and flame velocity of hydrogen compared with other fuels, main emissions in hydrogen mixture were CO2 and NO. Jhang et al. [16] worked on the effect of 0.6% and 1.2% volume additions of hydrogen on the diesel engine at idling condition under constant speed from the low to high engine load. They confirmed that while NOx emissions declined at the idling and low load condition, an increase occurred at high engine loads and speeds since higher temperature was observed. Ji and Wang [17] found that NOx emissions improved with increased hydrogen addition level in engine fuelled with gasoline. By exceeding the hydrogen energy fraction about 14.44% (4.88% by volume), HC and CO emissions increased at idle and stoichiometric conditions. In subsequent work, the authors [18] performed their experiments on a modified four-cylinder 1.6 l engine equipped with a hydrogen port-injection system at 1400 rpm for 3% and 6% hydrogen volume fractions in the total intake. The results demonstrated that with 6% hydrogen blending level, BTE was increased from 26.37% to 31.56%. Furthermore, HC and CO2 emissions were reduced whereas NOx emissions were increased with the elevated hydrogen fraction. Tomita et al. [19] and Saravanan et al. [20] revealed that owing to a stable combustion, NOx emissions decreased at low hydrogen additions and engine loads; however, at high hydrogen additions, the level of NOx emissions increased due to the raised combustion temperature inside engine cylinders. Karagoz et al. [21] investigated the effect of adding hydrogen based on variable energy rates on engine combustion and emissions characteristics at constant engine speed and different engine loads. They found that by increasing hydrogen energy content, CO and CO2 emissions decreased significantly, though a slight rise in HC and a moderate increase in NOx emissions which engine load affected considerably, were observed. Yilmaz et al. [22] investigated the effect of combined hydrogen-diesel combustion on performance and emissions of a diesel engine with a common rail injection under 50 Nm, 75 Nm, and 100 Nm engine loads at 1750 rpm. They showed that hydrogen in the intake air decreased HC and CO2 emissions, and increased cylinder pressures. In their tests, NOx emissions decreased with a 20 LPM flow rate and increased with a 40 LPM flow rate. Sharma and Dhar [23] created a numerical model for engine combustion and emission characteristics to evaluate the effects of compression ratios variation on maximum potential hydrogen energy share in a dual fuel engine. Their results showed a clear trade-off between maximum hydrogen energy share and the energy proportion of hydrogen at all compression ratios. Arat [24] simulated a hybrid electric vehicle powered by hydrogen enrichment in a diesel engine with AVL simulation tools to compare the performance and emission values. He found that the vehicle with hydrogen enriched diesel engines achieved 26% improvement on performance parameters. Moreover, the combined fuel consumption, NOx and CO2 emissions decreased by 14.32%, 15%, and 33%, respectively. Nowadays, biodiesels are one of the greatest prominences over petroleum fuel with sulphur free and adequate oxygen content, which have an uncomplicated manufacturing process and low GHG emissions [25]; however, higher viscosity and lower calorific values of biodiesel result in longer combustion duration, lower engine power, and higher BSFC than diesel [26,27]. There are few studies considering the effects of hydrogen enriched biodiesel fuel on performance and emissions of the engine. Uludamar et al. [13] tested sunflower, canola, and corn biodiesels at 20% and 40% blends enriched with 3 and 6 LPM hydrogen on an unmodified four-cylinder CI engine under no load condition. Their results revealed a reduction in CO, HC, and NOx emissions compared to biodiesel without hydrogen addition. In another study, Kumar et al. [28] conducted experiments to evaluate performance while using different quantities of hydrogen induction in a single cylinder engine fuelled with Jatropha biodiesel at 1500 rpm. Their results indicated an increase in BTE, performance and NO emissions and a reduction in HC and CO emissions at full load. Korakianitis et al. [29] found that by injecting rapeseed biodiesel enriched by hydrogen in CI engine, NOx emissions were reduced and thermal efficiencies increased, however, not under different operating conditions. Furthermore, CO, HC, and CO2 emissions were comparable to neat pilot fuel tests. In another research on this by Aldhaidhawi et al. [30], rapeseed biodiesel fuels enriched by hydrogen had no effect on ignition delay but decreased the CO and HC emissions. Besides, NOx emissions maintained the same increasing trend for 1400 rpm while there was not a completely apparent trend for 2400 rpm. An et al. [31] carried out a numerical simulation on a diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel with hydrogen inductions of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% vol. in the intake air. The results indicated that increasing hydrogen volume fraction reduced the peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate under 50% and full load conditions. Rahman et al. [32] applied 2 LPM hydrogen induction with B40 algae biodiesel in a single cylinder diesel engine. Adding hydrogen in the induction manifold improved BTE, BSEC, CO, and HC emissions. In another study, Banerjee et al. [33] conducted an experimental investigation on injection engine fuelled with B100 Mahua biodiesel under hydrogen enrichment. At full load, the results showed an increase of about 15.1% and 45.6% in BTE and NOx emissions compared to diesel. Akar et al. [34] investigated the effect of biodiesel obtained from waste oil as blends (B10 and B20) on the emissions and performance characteristics. The results showed that biodiesel blends fuels had significant influence on the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and improved the performance characteristics and emission parameters, whereas increased NOx emissions. Feedstocks of biodiesel can be categorized into four major groups: edible and non-edible vegetable oil, animal fats, waste or recycled oil, and algae or microalgae [10–12]. Microalgae biodiesel is one of the attractive feedstocks for replacing conventional diesel, which has higher lipid content and growth rate, and productivity in unsuitable land and wastewater compared to other generation [35–37]. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of microalgae have higher cetane number, viscosity, and density although its calorific values are lower [38]. There are some experimental studies on exhaust emissions and engine performance while applying microalgae biodiesel in engines. Most of these analyses have reported a significant drop in all emissions except NOx when using microalgae diesel-biodiesel blends rather than pure diesel [39–46]. For NOx emissions, some studies have stated an increase in NOx [39–42] with microalgae biodiesel, although the others have reported a reduction [43–46]. Singh et al. [47] compared marine microalgae and Jatropha biodiesel and found that NOx emissions of microalgae biofuel were 17% lower than that of Jatropha biodiesel. In another study, Hossain et al. [48] considered microalgae biodiesel extracted through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in a low-speed diesel engine. In these experimental analyses, while CO, CO2, and power decreased, NOx emissions increased. From the literature review, even though many articles have considered the performance and emissions characteristics of biodiesel and hydrogen addition to the CI engine, researches investigating a combination of hydrogen and biodiesel are rarely found. Therefore, in this experimental study, for the first time, the feasibility of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae (MCV) methyl ester enriched by hydrogen was studied to obtain ideal performance and emission characteristics. The challenge of applying MCV biodiesel in the engine is the low calorific values of biodiesel so that a drop in engine power and a rise in BSFC occur. This fact has motivated us to combine the hydrogen with biodiesel. In the present study, physicochemical properties of MCV methyl ester cultivated in photobioreactor were determined. Then, performance and exhaust emissions of the unmodified diesel engine were measured using different diesel-biodiesel blends and various hydrogen additions. The combination of these two alternative fuels offers the possibility producing of the cleanest and the most efficient renewable fuel in the near future."
1,Material and methods,"Chlorella vulgaris, which contains 40–50% lipids is one of the appropriate feedstocks for industrial fuel production [49]. For cultivation of MCV, 50 CC of Chlorella vulgaris was set in the phototron room of photobioreactor with the surface of 0.6 m2 and temperature of 25 °C. The photobioreactors system for Chlorella vulgaris cultivation is shown in Fig. 1 . The required light for cultivation was provided by two projectors and was set at 230 μ mol·photon/m2.s. In addition, the photobioreactor temperature was controlled by an automatic heating and cooling system. The optimum temperature for cultivation was obtained at 25 °C. KNO3 and Urea were applied for fluctuating PH at the range of 7.2 since it was more proper for the cultivation [50]. The harvesting time began when the adequate amount of microalgae had been produced. Then a centrifuge machine (Allegra X-22r) was applied for the drying stage. For total dryness, biomass was heated at 60 °C. Fig. 2 presents the biodiesel production process from MCV biomass. Solvent extraction with N-hexane and isopropanol in the ratio of 1:2 was used for extracting the lipids from biomass. In this level, to obtain the Chlorella vulgaris lipid, Soxhlet solvent apparatus was applied. The reservoir in Soxhlet was filled with dried MCV. Then for about 4 h, the solvent mixture was heated to its boiling temperature. For oil extraction, the boiling solvent soaked the biomass and dissolved lipids. The solvent drained into the bulb when it reached a certain level in the reservoir. The boiling point of hexane is approximately 70 °C. According to the results, 1.5 Kg of dried microalgae was required for achieving 500 ml of biofuel. Transesterification method was preferred for converting the microalgae lipids into biodiesel. In this stage, in the reactor, KOH as the catalyst and methanol (1% oil weight) in place of the alcohol were chosen and were added to the oil. The reaction was stirred at the speed of 400 rpm for 2 h at 65–70 °C in which the mixture of methyl ester and other products such as glyceride were achieved. For glycerol isolation, the mixture was poured into the separating funnel and was left for several hours at 25 °C [51]. In order to eliminate unreacted methanol and catalysts, the final product was leached by deionized water. The experimental analysis was carried out on a single cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled compression ignition diesel engine, Lombardini 3LD 510, and its main parameters are summarised in Table 1 . The combustion chamber was of the Hemispherical open type. The injection system included a Stanadyne high-pressure mechanical fuel pump-line-nozzle injection system in which Injection timing adjustment was performed by changing the shims in the injection pump. The biodiesel fuel was injected at a pressure of 200 bar and injection timing of 24° BTDC and no modification was made to the injection system during the tests. Hydrogen gas was supplied from a compressed hydrogen gas bottle and was injected into the engine inlet manifold, the only mechanical modification of the engine. Needle valve and rotameter with a flow range of 0–20 LPM controlled the mass flow rate of hydrogen gas. The buffer tank and flame arrester were used to ensure the safety of tests. The functional diagram of the experimental set-up is depicted in Fig. 3 . The engine was coupled to an electrical dynamometer with a maximum measuring torque of 80 Nm and was run under the ambient temperature of 25° C and atmospheric pressure of 1.017 bar. Tests were performed at full load with different engine speeds (between 1600 and 3000 rpm), which ran 0% (B0), 10% (B10) and 20% (B20) volume fractions of MCV methyl esters. Moreover, hydrogen additions were conducted for each test fuel with flow rates of 5 (H5) and 10 (H10) LPM. Measurement of instruments in experimental tests is susceptible to some sort of errors and uncertainties which arise from instrument calibration, condition, environment, and observation [14]. All the measuring instruments used in the tests were calibrated, and their errors were defined. Errors and uncertainties percentage are shown in Table 2 . The total uncertainty of the experiments was computed using the Holman method [52] is (1) Δ U = ∑ i n ∂ u ∂ x i Δ x i 2 and was based on the root mean square method. The uncertainty ΔU in the estimated value of quantity u, depends on the independent variables xi having individual error Δxi. In order to quantify the samples and emissions, calibration of the instruments including FT-IR, GC-MS and gas analyser was carried out by an expert from the supplier. Calibration of the FT-IR device was carried out by reference standard polystyrene film, which is made up of styrene polymers and covered the complete range of IR region. GC-MS instrument was calibrated using specific concentrations of Decafluorotriphenylphosphine and p-Bromofluorobenzene. Also, in order to guarantee the reliability of experiment, the analysis of spiked sample (containing a known concentration of a substance) was performed. Tester MAHA MGT5 was applied for determining exhaust gas emissions. This gas analyser was calibrated with standard gases for NO, NO2, and CO and zero gas (purified ambient air) for CO and NOx. As far as the accuracy of emission measurements was concerned, for each sample, air filter, lubrication oil, and oil filter were changed and the fuel tank was cleaned before the change of liquid fuel. In addition, before testing, the engine was allowed to run for a few minutes until it reached a steady state conditions and the experiments were performed three times in order to obtain certain results."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Fuel characterization,"3.1 Fuel characterization Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) which were determined by GC-MS analysis are shown in Table 3 . The most prominent FAMEs found in MCV biodiesel were methyl linoleic and methyl oleic with 31.6% and 21.8%, respectively. Longer fatty acid chain length results in a shorter ignition delay which leads to lower heat release rate and less NOx being produced during their combustion than shorter chained ones [53]. The FTIR spectroscopy helps to recognize the structure of FAME component in the biodiesel and reveals the presence of alcohol, amine, aromatic, alkyne groups, alkene, acid, and ether in samples [54]. Table 4 shows peaks from FTIR spectra identified MCV biodiesel in Fig. 4 . Table 5 illustrates the physical properties of MCV methyl esters comparing with diesel and ASTM standard. The density of MCV biodiesel was higher than pure diesel. Hence, the diesel–biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) had higher densities than diesel. Furthermore, heating value (MJ/kg) was 18.3% lower in MCV than diesel due to lower carbon content and a larger amount of oxygen. The cetane number of MCV was higher than the minimum of ASTM owing to its higher oxygen content which provides a lower delay period and smoother engine operation [55]. Besides, the MCV viscosity and flash point with 3.7 mm2/s and 124 °C were in the standard range. Important properties of hydrogen fuel are provided in Table 6 , which had a purity of 99.99%. Although the calorific value of hydrogen is higher than that of MCV biodiesel and diesel, the energy sharing of biodiesel and diesel with the volumetric comparison is more than hydrogen. The percentage energy substitution ratio (EH2) supplied by the hydrogen is determined by the following equation: (2) E H 2 = CV H 2 × V ̇ H 2 × ρ H 2 V ̇ D - B D × CV BD × ρ BD × X + CV D × ρ D × ( 1 - X ) + CV H 2 × V ̇ H 2 × ρ H 2 × 100 where CVH2, CVBD, and CVD represent hydrogen, MCV biodiesel and diesel calorific value (kJ/kg), respectively. ρH2, ρBD , and ρD are hydrogen, MCV biodiesel and diesel density (kg/m3). Additionally, V°D-BD and V°H2 are diesel-biodiesel and hydrogen volume flow rate (m3/s) and X is volume fractions of biodiesel. Table 7 shows the contents of tested fuels and the energy substitution ratio of hydrogen addition at three different engine speeds."
4,Engine performance results,"3.2 Engine performance results Engine power, torque, and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were evaluated with varying Chlorella vulgaris methyl ester blends at various engine speeds. Moreover, hydrogen additions were conducted for each fuel with flow rates of 5 (H5) and 10 (H10) LPM to discuss the effect of hydrogen fuel rate. Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the engine power and torque at the full load condition. The engine power outputs which was achieved with MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0 were respectively 79.5% and 83.6% of the average value obtained from pure diesel (B0_H0). The average reductions in engine torque for MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0 were 6.7% and 5.4% compared to B0_H0. Low heating value and high viscosity of biodiesel are responsible for low power and torque of the engine [57]. From the graph, it is evident that the engine performance improved when hydrogen was inducted into the air intake manifold. With 5 LPM hydrogen blending level, the engine power which was achieved with B0_H5, MCV20_H5, and MCV10_H5 were 102.3%, 88.2%, and 83.1% of the average value obtained for pure diesel (B0_H0). With further induction of hydrogen to 10 LPM flow rate, the average improvement of engine power was 7.6% and the maximum power was 8.9 kW in 3000 rpm for B0_H10. Moreover, torques in MCV20_H10 and MCV10_H10 were 10.6% and 8.4% higher than their respective biodiesel blends without hydrogen induction (MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0). Additional hydrogen to biodiesel improved the power and torque of engine due to the faster rate of combustion caused by hydrogen. BSFC value based on engine speed at different hydrogen induction is depicted in Fig. 7 . Average BSFC for MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0 was 15.4% and 12.6% higher than B0_H0, respectively. The reason behind this tendency was the lower calorific value and higher oxygen content in MCV biodiesel. As shown in Fig. 7, biodiesel with hydrogen induction had lower BSFC compared with pure biodiesel. The average reductions of BSFC for MCV20_H5 and MCV10_H5 were 3.4% and 5.1% compared to their respective pure biodiesel (MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0). In 10 LPM hydrogen induction, average BSFC reduction was 6.6% compared with the engine operating without hydrogen. Biodiesel with hydrogen led to more power generation and increased the combustion efficiency of the engine due to high calorific value and mass flow rate of hydrogen. One of the greatest factors that have a major influence on engine performance characteristics is the combustion of diesel engine. Various factors such as self-ignition and evaporation of fuel, oxidation and fuel stream, and its interaction with the cylinder walls can have several effects on the efficient combustion [58]. The combustion attribute is influenced by distinctions in physicochemical properties of biodiesel fuels. Since biodiesel has shorter ignition delay, the premixed combustion phase occurs earlier compared to diesel fuel. Not only the premixed combustion phase duration but also the diffusion combustion phase duration went up with all biodiesel-diesel blends compare to pure diesel. Both the maximum rate of pressure rise (ROPR max) and the maximum heat release rate (HRR max) of biodiesel are generally lower than that of pure diesel [59]. Furthermore, due to variation in physical properties, combustion and heat release characteristics of biodiesel compared to diesel fuel, BSFC increased subtly with biodiesel and its blended fuel."
5,Exhaust emission results,"3.3 Exhaust emission results CO, CO2, HC, and NOx emissions were evaluated for B10 and B20 volume fractions of Chlorella vulgaris methyl ester and pure diesel with 5 and 10 LPM hydrogen flow rates. It has been noticed that physical and chemical properties of pure diesel and biodiesel, engine type and operating conditions have effects on engine emissions [60]. CO results from incomplete combustion of petroleum fuel which contains lack of oxygen in their molecular structure. Start of injection timing, injection pressure, combustion chamber design, air–fuel equivalence ratio, fuel type, and engine load have a significant impact on the amount of CO [61]. Fig. 8 shows CO emissions for MCV20 and MCV10 with and without hydrogen fractions at full load. For MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0, CO emissions were respectively 44.2% and 37.0% lower than pure diesel (B0_H0). The proportion of CO emissions decreased by increasing the engine speed and the biodiesel content due to the rich fuel–air mixture and higher cetane number in biodiesel. By looking at the results, it becomes clear that hydrogen addition conducted the reduction of CO emissions due to helping high diffusivity, flame speed functions, and carbonless molecular structure which lead to complete combustion. Comparing with MCV20 without hydrogen induction, CO emissions in MCV20_H5 and MCV20_H10 dropped by 7.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the average amount of CO2 emissions demonstrated in Fig. 9 was decreased by raising the blend of MCV biodiesel-diesel. Although complete combustion results in the conversion of CO to CO2, this increase was insignificant since carbon to hydrogen ratio of biodiesel was lower than diesel. While using MCV10_H0 and MCV20_H0 as fuel, the average amount of CO2 emissions was respectively 2.6% and 6.4% lower than B0_H0 at full load. With the increase of hydrogen fraction, CO2 emissions decreased due to lack of carbon in its content. CO2 emissions in MCV20_H5 and MCV20_H10 decreased by 4.2% and 6.8% comparing to MCV20_H0, respectively. NOx is the most harmful gaseous emission from engines. The trend of NOx emissions highly depends on ignition delay, combustion temperature, and physicochemical properties of the fuel. The higher density and viscosity of biodiesel affected injection timing which led to increase of NOx emissions [62]. NOx emission results are indicated in Fig. 10 with various hydrogen fractions at different engine speeds. The average increase in NOx emissions for MCV10_H0 and MCV20_H0 was respectively 2.2% and 5.1% higher compared to B0_H0. Hydrogen addition to the engine increased NOx emissions for all tests due to higher combustion temperature [63]. Comparing to MCV20 without hydrogen induction, MCV20_H5 and MCV20_H10 increased NOx emissions 9.8% and 16.8%, respectively. As a result, maximum NOx emissions were obtained at 10 LPM hydrogen induction. Most studies reported different trends for NOx emissions with hydrogen addition blending level to fuels. Some studies have stated an increase in NOx emissions [16,18,64,65] due to the raised combustion temperature whereas others have reported reduction or unchanged condition when hydrogen addition rate was increased due to stable combustion at highly dilute conditions for the low lean flammability of the hydrogen [66–68]. UHC emissions consist of fuel that is combusted incompletely and mostly produced in low power levels and because of problems in mixing the fuel and air. Fig. 11 shows variation in HC emissions of MCV methyl ester and pure diesel with different hydrogen induction. Based on the results, HC emissions decreased by increasing the content of biodiesel blends due to higher cetane number which decreased the combustion delay [57]. For MCV20_H0 and MCV10_H0, the average reduction of HC emissions was respectively 47.4% and 25.7% less than pure diesel (B0_H0). Fig. 11 also demonstrates that by increasing hydrogen fraction, HC emissions decreased. By utilizing 10 LPM hydrogen induction, HC emissions reduced 25.0% and 34.3% for B10 and B20 biodiesel blends, respectively. These amounts for 5 LPM hydrogen were 13.9% and 15.6%, respectively. HC emissions declined by hydrogen addition due to low carbon content, improved the homogeneity of fuel-air mixture and high flame speed, which decreased the combustion duration and the probability of occurrence of incomplete combustion cycles. Another reason for this behaviour is shorter quenching distance of hydrogen than gasoline which allows the flame to travel closer to the cylinder wall so that complete combustion occurs [69]."
6,Conclusions,"The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effect of MCV methyl ester under hydrogen enrichment on emissions and performance of diesel engine at 1600 to 3000 rpm speed range and full load condition. According to experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn. • MCV biodiesel had 18.3% less heating value than diesel and can run the diesel engine without any modification. • The blend of MCV methyl ester in B20 produced 79.5% of the average power and torque obtained from pure diesel. However, hydrogen enrichment compensated the decrement in performance characteristics of the engine, which with 10 LPM hydrogen addition to MCV20, 7.6% and 10.6% increments in torque and power of the engine were obtained. • The test analyses showed that BSFC of MCV20 was 15.4% higher than that of pure diesel, which is consistent with their lower calorific value and higher oxygen content, whereas, by 10 LPM hydrogen addition to MCV20, 6% reduction in BSFC was obtained. • With an increase in the content of MCV biodiesel blends and hydrogen addition, all emissions, except NOx, declined significantly. In MCV20 by 10 LPM hydrogen addition, CO, CO2, and HC decreased respectively 13.7%, 6.8%, and 34.3% compared with the case without hydrogen induction. • Owing to augmented combustion temperature, NOx emissions increased in higher hydrogen. NOx emissions in MCV20 biodiesel were 5.1% higher than pure diesel. With 10 LPM hydrogen enrichment, NOx increased 16.8% comparing the MCV20. Finally, results show that MCV methyl ester enriched by hydrogen can play an important role in the reducing the air pollution. Furthermore, Hydrogen addition enhanced the efficiency and power of CI engine fuelled with MCV biodiesel."
