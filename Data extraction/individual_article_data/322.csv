0,Introduction,"There is an urgent need to reduce the global atmospheric CO2 burden, which continues to increase mainly due to dependence on fossil fuels as energy sources [1,2]. Strategies that can be used to mitigate CO2 levels include its capture, storage, and utilization. Storage may be effective for this purpose, while the use of CO2 as a carbon source to produce high value products is also considered important [2,3]. The use of CO2 as a low-cost carbon source can not only assist in resolving environmental issues, but also provide economic advantages [4]. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 is one way to use this gas to generate valuable products such as methanol, ethanol, DME, olefins, C5+ hydrocarbons, and even synthetic natural gas or fuel gas. For the catalytic hydrogenation to be considered a sustainable way to generate these products, the H2 used in the reaction must be from a renewable source, examples being water electrolysis and biological routes employing cyanobacteria or seaweeds [2,5,6]. Scientists have already made breakthroughs related to H2 generation from water electrolysis, using solar and wind energy sources. There are many established industrial technologies related to water electrolysis, providing efficiencies of around 70 % [7]. The transformation of CO2 to liquid hydrocarbons has been widely reported. There has also been increasing interest in the production of unsaturated C2-C4 hydrocarbons (light olefins) from CO2 [8–10]. These unsaturated products are raw materials in the production of polymers, solvents, medicines, cosmetics, and detergents. Aviation fuel can also be produced by oligomerization of the light olefins in the presence of acid catalysts such as zeolites [11]. The use of CO2 as the carbon source in the hydrogenation reaction makes it a challenging process, as CO2 is a thermodynamically stable molecule, and the undesired methanation reaction along the CO2 hydrogenation diminishes the selectivity towards olefins [12–14]. The lower amount of CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface compared to the amount of H2 dissociated creates a high H/C ratio, which favors methane formation, rather than the growth of hydrocarbon chains. Nonetheless, the transformation of CO2 to products with high market demand has attracted scientific research, mainly due to the environmental appeal, as discussed previously [2]. In general, CO2 hydrogenation follows two possible pathways: (i) hydrogenation of CO2 over a catalyst containing Cu or Zn, forming methanol, which is then converted to hydrocarbons (C2+) in the presence of zeolites [15]; and (ii) use of the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) (Eq. (1)), followed by the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis reaction (Eq. (2)), over iron-based catalysts [16]. (1) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ C O + H 2 O Δ H 573 K = + 38 k J / m o l (2) n C O + 2 n H 2 ↔ ( - C H 2 - ) n + n H 2 O Δ H 573 K = - 166 k J / m o l The present work focuses on the second pathway, which is viable in the presence of iron-based catalysts, considering that Fe has high capacity to promote carbon coupling, which is usually considered the limiting step. Moreover, iron is also active towards the RWGS reaction, producing CO as an intermediate product [17,18]. Despite to the fact that the CO2 activation over cobalt metal occurs easier than over iron, the former metal is not active towards the first step of the CO2 hydrogenation, i.e., the RWGS reaction [19]. Consequently, the partial pressure of CO is too low to stabilize the Fischer-Tropsch reaction when a Co-based catalyst is employed in the route mediated by the RWGS reaction. Iron catalysts, on the other hand, present specific types of sites responsible for hydrogenation and growth of the hydrocarbon chain. The sites ascribed for hydrogenation are the Fe° and FeOx species, while the sites responsible for the chain growth are iron carbides (FexCy) formed due to the carburization of the iron species by CO, produced through RWGS reaction. This process, known as “catalyst construction”, occurs during the reaction. For this, it is important for the catalyst to be active towards the RWGS reaction, so that the partial pressure of CO can be kept high enough to promote the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, as well as the carburization of iron oxides [9,20,21]. In fact, a Fe/SiO2 catalyst was found to produce light olefins and light paraffins (C2-C4), although CH4 was the main hydrocarbon product [22]. To illustrate the importance of the iron carbides on the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, several types of supports for iron-based catalysts were evaluated by Wang and coworkers [23], amongst them, SiO2 and ZrO2. Zirconia showed the best activity and selectivity towards olefins production, as the lowest activity shown by the silica-supported catalyst was explained by the absence of the iron carbide phase, proved by XRD analysis of the spent catalyst. The hydrogenation of CO2 to light hydrocarbons is usually carried out at elevated pressures. Another challenge of this reaction, besides the CO2 stability and undesired methane production, as discussed previously, concerns operation at atmospheric pressure, which normally leads to the undesired methanation reaction. However, operation at atmospheric pressure is both safer and less demanding in terms of equipment. A ceria-supported iron catalyst was used by Torrente-Murciano and coworkers [24] for CO2 hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, providing greater selectivity towards olefins production, when compared to a Fe/SiO2 catalyst evaluated under similar conditions [22]. It was also found that lower concentrations of CH4 and C2-C4 paraffins were obtained, compared to use of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. A possible explanation for this was that the redox properties of ceria facilitated the transformation of CO2 to CO in the RWGS reaction, consequently increasing the CO partial pressure and promoting carburization of the FeOx species [2,20,22,25]. The CeO2 is considered a very promising catalyst support for several reactions involving CO2 conversions, due to its structural properties and redox features, as commented in the previous paragraph. Under reducing conditions, CeO2 changes to Ce2O3, generating vacancies that can activate CO2 by the oxidation of these vacancies with production of CO [26,27], that is then hydrogenated to hydrocarbons in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, which is a very important feature for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction intermediated by the RWGS. ZrO2 is also considered an important catalyst for the CO2 conversion. Gu and coworkers [28] reported that zirconia as the support for iron-based catalysts acts a “co-catalyst” during the CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins at 20 bar, due to the oxygen vacancies produced during the H2 treatment. This is because zirconia is a “p” type semiconductor capable of eliminating oxygen species and producing sites where CO2 molecules can be adsorbed. Zhang and coworkers [29] evaluated the effects of Ce addition in K-promoted Fe-Zr catalysts on the CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins at 20 bar. In proper concentrations, Ce increased the CO2 adsorption capacity and regulated the H2 adsorption, which directly influenced on an adequate product distribution, that is a balance between the lowest selectivity towards both CO and CH4, and the highest selectivity towards light hydrocarbons, especially light olefins. It is also a quite common sense that the CeO2 and ZrO2 combination offer better catalytic properties than the individual oxides, including higher mechanical and thermal stabilities as well as higher ability to generate oxygen vacancies that increase the CO2 adsorption capacity and facilitate H2 dissociation [30,31]. Up to now, in the field of CO2 hydrogenation research, the combination of CeO2 and ZrO2 oxides have been used as supports for Ni catalysts employed in CH4 production from CO2 according to the carbon dioxide methanation reaction [32–35]. Bi-metallic Fe-In catalysts supported on CeO2-ZrO2 materials were also used for the CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols [36]. The CeO2-ZrO2 combinations can be considered potential materials as the matrix or supports for the iron-based catalysts applied to the CO2 hydrogenation to light hydrocarbons, at atmospheric pressure. Despite to the fact that Zhang and coworkers [29] studied similar catalytic systems (K-promoted Fe-Ce-Zr catalysts) for the CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins, the bulk composition of their catalysts (iron concentration ranging from 70 to 80% in an oxygen-free basis) are quite different from what is proposed in this present work (see Table 1 ). Considering this, the present work investigates the use of catalysts consisting of iron and CexZr(1-x)O2 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) binary oxides, employed for the light hydrocarbons production by carbon dioxide hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, evaluating the effect of the composition of the iron-based CexZr(1-x)O2 materials on this reaction, mainly its influence on the hydrocarbons distribution."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis The CexZr(1-x)O2 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) supports for the iron-based catalysts were prepared using a methodology that includes a hydrothermal step [34]. For this, 1 g of Pluronic P123® surfactant was used with 10 mmol of Ce and Zr precursor salts (Ce(NO3)3.6H2O, ≥99 % purity, and ZrO(NO3)2.6H2O, ≥99 % purity, both supplied by Sigma-Aldrich). The surfactant was dissolved in ethanol (99 % purity, Merck, 10 mL) and HNO3 (2 mol L−1, 1 mL), with the resulting solution kept under stirring for 2 h. After this procedure, the nitrate salts, which were previously dissolved in ethanol, were added to the copolymer solution and the mixture was kept under agitation for 40 min. Next, 40 mL of NH4OH (27 %, Synth) was added to the previous solution, at room temperature, with stirring for 1 h. The resulting solution was transferred to two 50 mL Teflon® autoclaves, which were sealed inside steel jackets and kept at 95 °C in an oven for 43 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The synthesized material was rinsed twice with ethanol and once with ultrapure MilliQ® water, with centrifugation after each rinsing. The material was dried at 100 °C for 18 h, followed by calcination for 4 h in a muffle furnace at 650 °C (heating rate of 2 °C min−1), under a static air atmosphere. The iron was incorporated into the supports according to a one-pot procedure. An amount of Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (≥98 % purity, Sigma-Aldrich), calculated to give 20 wt.% of metal in the final catalyst (Fe/Fe + CexZr(1-x)O2 = 0.20), was included following the protocol described above, with calcination under the same conditions. The weight concentration of the active phase in the catalysts (20 % wt) was selected based on the works of Owen and coworkers [17,22] and Torrente-Murciano and coworkers [24], who also investigated iron-based catalysts applied to the CO2 hydrogenation to light hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure. Table 1 provides a list of the prepared supports and catalysts, together with their chemical compositions (oxygen-free basis) determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were performed using an energy dispersive X-ray instrument (Ray Ny EDX-720, Shimadzu) to obtain information about the chemical compositions of the supports and fresh catalysts (Table 1). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å), operating at 40 kV (20 mA), in the 2θ range from 10 ° to 120 °, with step size of 0.02 ° and acquisition time of 3 s for each step. Data refinement according to the Rietveld method was performed with GSAS-EXPGUI software. Raman spectroscopy analyses of the supports and fresh catalysts employed a WITec α300R instrument (λ = 514.6 nm). Scanning electron microscopy coupled with the Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was carried out with the reduced catalysts in a Zeiss LEO 440 equipment (20 kV, 2.82 A), Oxford detector (model 7060) with EDX Link Analytical accessory (Isis System Series 300), and the resolution of the Atmospheric Thin Window (10 mm2) was from 133 eV to 5.9 eV. The specific surface areas of the materials were determined by N2 physisorption at −196 °C (B.E.T. method). The pore volumes and average pore sizes were estimated using the B.J.H. method. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analyses were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. The samples were pretreated for 1 h at 200 °C, in a flow of N2 (30 mL min−1), and the analysis started after cooling to 50 °C, with heating to 900 °C (at 10 °C min−1), in a 30 mL min−1 flow of 10 % (v/v) H2 in N2. The interactions of H2 and CO2 with the supports and the catalysts were studied using H2-temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) and CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments. For H2-TPD, the sample was first pretreated for 30 min in a flow of N2 at 200 °C. It was then reduced for 1 h in a 30 mL min−1 flow of 10 % (v/v) H2 in N2, at 550 °C. Once this procedure was finished, the sample was cooled to 50 °C, exposed for 1 h to the 30 mL min−1 flow of 10 % (v/v) H2 in N2, and then flushed with N2 to remove the physically adsorbed H2. The H2 desorption was performed by increasing the temperature from 50 to 850 °C, at 10 °C min−1, with N2 as the carrier gas. For CO2-TPD, the samples were pretreated and reduced under the same conditions used in the H2-TPD experiments, followed by exposure to a 30 mL min−1 flow of CO2, at 50 °C, for 20 min. Physically adsorbed CO2 was removed by flushing the samples with He, at 50 °C. The CO2 desorption was performed by increasing the temperature from 50 to 850 °C, at 10 °C min1, with He as the carrier gas. The decomposition of the iron carbides species in the spent catalysts was evaluated in the same AutoChem II 2920 equipment by means of temperature programmed desorption, according to the experiment description reported by Witoon and coworkers [37]."
4,CO2 hydrogenation tests,"2.3 CO2 hydrogenation tests The CO2 hydrogenation tests were carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor. A mass of 300 mg of fresh catalyst was activated for 1 h in a 30 mL min−1 flow of H2, at 550 °C (this temperature was established from the H2-TPR analyses). The reactions were carried out at 370 °C, at atmospheric pressure, with TOS of 5 h and feed of H2:CO2 at a ratio of 3:1 (total flow of 16 N mL min−1). The species H2, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 in the reactor effluent were determined using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with two TCDs, two molecular sieves (13-X and 5A), two Porapak-Q columns, and one Porapak-N column. The carrier gases were N2 and He. Possible C4 compounds were not considered, due to excessive noise of the TCD signal at the elution time ascribed to these products. No liquids or waxes were observed in the condenser trap coupled to the reactor outlet, indicating that no alcohols or heavier hydrocarbons were produced. A mass balance showed that the input and output carbon contents were close to ±5% for all tests (maximum/minimum deviation = −4.7 %/+0.13 %), so it could be considered that all the carbon-containing products were properly quantified. The bare supports were also evaluated to determine whether there was any catalytic activity associated with these materials. The following expressions were used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts: (3) X C O 2 = F C O 2 , o u t F C O 2 , i n - F C O 2 , o u t . 100 % (4) S C O = F C O , o u t F C O 2 , i n - F C O 2 , o u t . 100 % (5) S C H 4 = F C H 4 , o u t F C O 2 , i n - F C O 2 , o u t . 100 % (6) S C 2 H 4 = 2 .

5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction analyses,"3.1 X-ray diffraction analyses Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffractograms of the supports. The diffraction peaks of the Ce100 sample are ascribed to the cubic ceria with a unit cell arrangement like fluorite (CaF2), while the Zr100 support was mainly formed by a mixture of zirconium oxide polymorphs (cubic, tetragonal and monoclinic) [38]. The Ce75Zr25 support consisted mostly of a cubic CeZrO2 solid solution. The Rietveld refinement results suggest that this solid solution did not show a uniform composition, as part of it was present as a cubic Ce-enriched solid solution (F) and as a cubic Zr-enriched solid solution (C), as shown in Table S1, which summarizes the information for the weight concentrations of the phases, besides the presence of a minor concentration of a Zr-enriched solid solution in a tetragonal phase (T). Differently, much of the Ce25Zr75 support composition could be ascribed to a Zr-enriched solid solution in the tetragonal phase, together with a contribution of a cubic phase solid solution with non-uniform composition (one part being Ce-enriched (F) and another part being Zr-enriched (C)). According to Koszlov and coworkers [39] and Deng and coworkers [40], binary oxides with a Ce/Zr bulk ratios < 0.5, i.e. Zr-enriched ones, are commonly crystallized as tetragonal Zr-enriched CeZrO2 solid solutions. Deng and coworkers [40] also observed that especially for Zr-enriched bulk compositions (< 0.5), a complete Zr+4 incorporation into a single tetragonal solid solution was observed after the treatment of the solids at 1000 °C, whilst a complete Zr+4 ions incorporation into a single cubic CeZrO2 solid solution was already observed at 600 °C for Ce-enriched compositions. This explains the presence of a segregate ZrO2 in monoclinic phase in the Ce25Zr75, due to the mild calcination temperature used in the present work, but it does not explain the non-uniform composition of the phases present in these samples. This may come from synthesis condition, as the steel jackets were not kept under stirring or any type of homogenization during the hydrothermal step was applied. A highlight in the 2θ range = 27−32 ° (Fig. S1a) shows the shifts of the (111) peak ascribed to the cubic CeO2 (F) towards higher Bragg angles when the composition changes from pure ceria (Ce100) to Ce: Zr = 75:25 and to Ce: Zr = 50:50, that indicates the incorporation of the Zr+4 cations in the lattice, noticing that the values of the lattice parameters of the present phases diminished compared to the Ce100, as Zr+4 (0.084 nm) is smaller than Ce+4 (0.101 nm) (see the changes in the lattices parameters in Table S2), despite to the fact that the solid solutions produced are not uniform. Oppositely, the (111) peak ascribed to the tetragonal (T) and/or cubic zirconia (C) in the Zr100 sample shifts to lower 2θ values, due to the presence of Ce+4 in the lattice, leading to an increase in the values ascribed to the lattice parameters of the present phases (see the changes in the lattices parameters in Table S2). It can be seen from Table S1 that the concentration of the ZrO2 monoclinic phase diminished as the Ce concentration increased, revealing that the zirconium oxide stabilized in a cubic and/or tetragonal phase by the formation of CeO2. No monoclinic phase was observed in the fresh FeZr100 catalyst (Fig. 2 ), indicating that the iron also stabilized the zirconia in cubic and/or tetragonal lattices. However, the peaks ascribed to the monoclinic phase of zirconia could be observed for this sample after activation of the catalyst at 550 °C under a pure H2 flow, as well as for the spent catalyst (Fig. S3). The diffractograms of the fresh catalysts showed the presence of a segregated hematite (Fe2O3) phase (Fig. 2), demonstrating that some iron oxides were not incorporated in the supports. For this reason, the Fe2O3 weight concentrations obtained from the XRF results were distinct from the weight concentrations estimated by data refinement using the Rietveld method (Table S1). This indicated that a fraction of the iron species was inside the CeO2-ZrO2 binary oxides, or inside CeO2 or ZrO2, for the fresh FeCe100 and FeZr100 catalysts, respectively. Increasing the Zr concentration from Ce:Zr = 50:50 (FeCe50Zr50) to Ce:Zr = 0:100 (FeZr100) in the catalysts resulted in greater hematite segregation, as the intensity ascribed to the hematite phase increased (Fig. 2) with the increment of the Zr concentration in these catalyst. Since the size of the Zr4+ ion (0.084 nm) is smaller than that of the Ce4+ ion (0.101 nm), a high concentration of the former cations could cause lattice contraction of the bare supports, as discussed previously, and hinder the iron incorporation in the inner layers of the catalysts. Consequently, greater agglomeration of hematite on the surface occurred as the Zr concentration increased from FeCe50Zr50 to FeZr100, as shown by the average crystallite sizes related to this phase (Table S2) [29]. As shown in Table S2, the addition of iron caused decreases of the lattice parameters of ceria (F) and tetragonal zirconia (T), for the fresh FeCe100 and FeZr100 catalysts, respectively, as well as of the phases that are present in the Ce-enriched catalysts, FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50. Similar behavior was also observed for the lattice parameters ascribed to the tetragonal (T) and cubic (C) phases, in the fresh FeCe25Zr75 catalyst. As Fe3+ (0.064 nm) is smaller than Ce4+ (0.101 nm) and Zr4+ (0.084 nm), this results in contraction of the lattices when iron was incorporated in the phases that constitute the samples [41]. The lattices contractions were more evident in the cubic Zr-enriched CeZrO2 solid solution phase (C) in the FeCe75Zr25 catalyst, and in the cubic (C) and/or tetragonal (T) Zr-enriched CeZrO2 solid solution in the FeCe50Zr50 sample, compared to the cubic Ce-enriched CeZrO2 solid solution phase (F) suggesting that Fe3+ species were more effectively incorporated in the respective Zr-enriched solid solution present in these catalysts (Fig. S1a, Table S2). Compared to FeCe100, FeCe25Zr75, and FeZr100 samples, the Fe3+ species were also more effectively incorporated in both FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 catalysts. In addition, more segregated and agglomerated Fe2O3 particles were likely to have been present on the surfaces of the last two catalysts, especially FeZr100, for which there was the highest hematite phase concentration, among the fresh catalysts (23 wt.%, Table S1), as well as the largest hematite phase crystallite size (Table S2). In the “Supplementary Information 2: SEM” archive, information about the distribution of the elements on the surface of the reduced catalysts can be found."
7,Raman spectroscopy,"3.2 Raman spectroscopy The Raman spectrum for the Ce100 support showed a sharp band at around 462 cm−1 (Fig. 3 ), related to the fluorite F2g vibrational mode, characteristic of pure cerium oxide. Other lower intensity bands at 250 and 600 cm−1 could be attributed to the transversal (2TA) vibrational mode and to the vibrational mode induced by the presence of defects (D), respectively, with both being typical of the fluorite structure [42,43]. The spectrum for zirconia in the Zr100 support presented bands related to the monoclinic (M) and tetragonal phases at 146, 265 (Eg), and 640 cm−1 [44]. Since the cubic phase of zirconia would only present a broad asymmetric band at around 600 cm-1, the Zr100 support featured the monoclinic and tetragonal phases, in agreement with the XRD data [45]. The Raman spectrum for the Ce75Zr25 support presented features like those in the Ce100 spectrum (Fig. 3). However, there was a shift towards higher wavenumbers, as well as the appearance of a broad band at around 625 cm-1, attributed to the cubic CeZrO2 solid solution (enriched in Zr) and to the presence of lattice defects, such as oxygen vacancies, due to the incorporation of Zr in the fluorite lattice. These lattice defects could also explain the shift of the F2g band position to higher wave numbers, as well as the broadening of this band, both related to the incorporation of Zr [40,43,46]. Similar spectral features were observed for the Ce50Zr50 support. However, in addition to the bands related to the fluorite, there were also bands corresponding to the monoclinic and tetragonal structures. There were well-defined bands related to the monoclinic phase, despite only a 5 wt.% concentration of this phase, estimated from Rietveld refinement. However, it should be noted that Raman spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive technique, while XRD considers the bulk material [41]. Therefore, it could be inferred that the monoclinic phase concentration was higher at the surface than in the bulk of the Ce50Zr50 support. The Raman spectrum of the Ce25Zr75 support featured low intensity bands at 170−190 cm−1 and at around 380 cm−1, due to the monoclinic phase. A band near 310 cm−1, corresponding to the tetragonal phase, was shifted to lower wavenumber, due to the incorporation of Ce and presence of the monoclinic phase. The most intense band appeared as a doublet, with peaks at 455 cm−1, ascribed to the tetragonal solid solution, and at 471 cm−1, related to the fluorite F2g vibrational mode. Finally, a band at 623 cm−1 could be attributed to the F2g vibrational mode of cubic zirconia and to the presence of structural defects. The addition of iron led to new bands at 227 and 290 cm−1, both related to the hematite phase (Fig. 4 ). The highest intensity of the band near 290 cm−1 was observed for the fresh FeZr100 catalyst, reflecting substantial growth of Fe2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, as suggested by the XRD results [41]. For the FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 samples, the F2g vibrational mode of the fluorite showed pronounced asymmetric band broadening and lower intensity, compared to the fresh FeCe100 catalyst. This could be explained by greater incorporation of Fe3+, especially in the case of the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, which increased lattice contraction and distortion, as well as by the presence of crystallites with smaller sizes [47]. The F2g mode was almost imperceptible for the fresh FeCe25Zr75 catalyst, which agreed with the XRD data reported previously."
8,Textural properties,"3.3 Textural properties The highest support specific surface area was obtained for the Ce75Zr25 sample. The values diminished with increase of the zirconia concentration, as also observed for the pore volumes (Table 2 ). The incorporation of iron led to increases of the B.E.T. area and the pore volume, except for the fresh FeCe100 catalyst. Fig. 5 shows how the B.E.T. specific surface area changed with the hematite phase concentration and crystallite size, both estimated from Rietveld refinement of the XRD data. Except for the fresh FeCe100 catalyst, the B.E.T. specific surface area showed an inverse relationship with the hematite phase weight concentration and crystallite size, suggesting that the Fe2O3 was agglomerated on the surface, consequently reducing the specific surface area."
9,H2-TPR,"3.4 H2-TPR H2-TPR analyses were performed to elucidate the reduction of the Fe2O3 during the activation process with H2. For this, it was firstly necessary to understand the reduction behaviors of the supports (Fig. 6 ). The H2-TPR curve for the Ce100 support showed peaks at 500 and 800 °C, related to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ at the surface and in the bulk material, respectively. For this support, the majority of the H2 consumption occurred in the high temperature range (>600 °C). The opposite was observed for the Ce75Zr25 support, with the peak at lower temperature being more intense than the peak at around 800 °C. This indicated that there was earlier reduction of ceria in the CeO2-ZrO2 binary oxides [48]. There was no high temperature peak (near 800 °C) for the Ce50Zr50 and Ce25Zr75 supports, indicative of complete early reduction of ceria when the ZrO2 concentration in the solid solution was increased. Hence, no distinction between reduction of the surface and the bulk could be made in these cases [30]. Finally, there was negligible reduction of zirconia up to 900 °C, with no H2 consumption observed for Zr100 in this temperature range. The H2-TPR curves for the fresh catalysts are presented in Fig. 7 . The reduction of the Fe2O3 phase usually occurs in three steps: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 (magnetite) → FeO → Fe°. A two-step mechanism can also occur: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 (magnetite) → Fe°. For the Fe100 sample (pure Fe2O3 hematite, Fig. S2, the curve suggested that the iron species were reduced according to a mechanism with three steps. However, the interactions with the supports resulted in the iron species showing varying behaviors. For the FeCe100, and for the FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 catalysts, the shoulders near 325 and 300 °C, respectively, were due to the reduction of small Fe2O3 surface particles to Fe3O4, which was followed by reduction to Fe2+ species in the temperature range 375−400 °C [48,49]. In general, the smaller the Fe2O3 particle size, the lower the temperature ascribed to the transformation of hematite to magnetite [48]. Hence, the results indicated that the FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 catalysts presented iron oxide particles that were more highly dispersed on the surface, as discussed in the XRD section. In the temperature range 450−550 °C, there was also reduction of the surface oxygen of the supports. At temperature higher than 600 °C, the FeCe100 and FeCe75Zr25 catalysts showed reduction of FeO to Fe°, as well as reduction of the oxygen in the bulk of the supports. The shift of the high temperature peak towards even higher temperature, observed for FeCe50Zr50 and FeCe75Zr25, compared to FeCe100, was suggestive of stronger interaction between the support and FeO formed from the reduction of magnetite [49]. The curves for the FeCe25Zr25 and FeZr100 samples showed some distinct features, probably due to the presence of Fe2O3 particles with non-uniform size. For the former catalyst, the reduction of smaller Fe2O3 particles to magnetite occurred at around 300 °C, while larger Fe2O3 species were reduced to Fe3O4 at around 400 °C. At this temperature, there was also a contribution of the reduction of Fe3O4 species (formed from the reduction of smaller hematite particles) to FeO. Hydrogen consumption due to reduction of the support occurred in the range 450−500 °C. Reduction of the magnetite species produced at 400 °C to Fe° started in the range 500−550 °C, with complete transformation to Fe° at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Reduction of the remaining FeO to Fe°, involving several types of interaction with the support, could also have occurred in this temperature range. These processes could explain the peak broadening in the high temperature range, especially for FeCe25Zr75. For FeZr100, the peaks in the low temperature range were shifted to higher temperatures, compared to FeCe25Zr75 and to the other catalysts, suggesting the existence of Fe2O3 oxides with larger particle size, as discussed previously in the XRD section. As observed for the FeCe25Zr75 catalyst, the magnetite produced from the reduction of larger Fe2O3 species (at around 415 °C) might have been partially reduced to Fe° in the range 500−550 °C, with complete reduction at around 620 °C. The Fe2O3 with smaller particle size was first converted to Fe3O4 (at 370 °C), followed by further reduction to Fe2+ (at 515 °C). The reduction of FeO to Fe° was complete at temperature higher than 650 °C. The features discussed above clearly showed that the composition of the catalyst support affected the reduction of the iron oxides. The supports provided better dispersion of Fe2O3, facilitating reduction of the iron oxides. A temperature of 550 °C was selected for activation of the catalysts, prior to each CO2 hydrogenation reaction. At this temperature, the catalysts mainly consisted of unreduced iron oxides and Fe° species. The presence of cationic species is essential for the RWGS reaction, producing the CO that will be hydrogenated [49,50]. Ex situ XRD analyses with Rietveld refinement were carried out to evaluate the presence of iron species after activation with a pure H2 flow at 550 °C. Table 3 summarizes the phase concentrations (wt.%) ascribed to the iron species, together with the corresponding crystallite sizes. The XRD patterns of the reduced samples are provided in Fig. S3. The iron species present in the reduced FeCe100 catalyst were FeO and metallic iron (Fe°), as shown in Table 3. The presence of FeO oxides suggested that the reduction of hematite occurred in three steps, with Fe2+ being formed during the reduction of magnetite, in agreement with the H2-TPR curves. FeO is very unstable and can be readily oxidized in air to Fe3O4, at ambient temperature. Unfortunately, this could not be avoided, especially for the FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 catalysts, considering that the XRD analyses were carried out under ex situ conditions. For these two samples, oxidation of the FeO species could be clearly observed immediately after transferring the reduced catalysts from the reactor to the XRD sample holder (the color of the samples changed from dark grey to a brown-colored powder). Hence, for these two samples, no FeO species could be observed, probably because they were rapidly oxidized to Fe3O4 species. Lower concentrations of Fe° were detected for the reduced FeCe75Zr25 and FeCe50Zr50 samples, compared to the reduced FeCe100 catalyst. As discussed previously, for these two samples, the H2-TPR curves suggested stronger interaction between the support and the FeO species produced from the reduction of magnetite, which could hinder the transformation of Fe2+ to Fe°. In the case of the Fe100 sample, the reduction with pure hydrogen at 550 °C mainly produced Fe° species. According to the TPR curve (Fig. S2), the presence of unreduced iron species was expected at this temperature. Zielinski and coworkers [51] reported that the H2 concentration in the activation flow/atmosphere influenced the kinetic mechanism of pure Fe2O3 reduction. It was observed that in a hydrogen-enriched flow (H2 concentration above 80 % v/v), the formation of Fe° particles already occurred at 300 °C, while when a diluted H2 flow was used, metallic iron only started to appear above 500 °C. In the present work, a pure hydrogen flow was used to reduce the Fe100 catalyst, so a high concentration of the Fe° phase was observed in the reduced sample. As shown in Table 3, the Fe° phase concentration increased when the Zr content was increased from FeCe50Zr50 to FeCe25Zr75. The presence of the unreduced iron oxide species (Fe3O4 and FeO), together with the metallic iron phase (Fe°), was observed for the reduced FeCe25Zr75 sample. In this case, the Fe° species were probably derived from direct reduction of the Fe3O4 species produced from the reduction of larger hematite particles, as discussed previously. The highest concentration ascribed to the Fe° phase was found for the reduced FeZr100 catalyst, which could be explained by the fact that this catalyst was constituted of large Fe2O3 particles that were converted to Fe3O4 and further transformed to Fe° in the temperature range 500−550 °C. The contribution of the Fe3O4 species could be explained by the fact that any FeO species produced by the reduction of magnetite, which was formed by the reduction of smaller hematite particles that might be present in the fresh catalyst, were rapidly oxidized to Fe3O4 when in contact with air. The Fe° crystallites showed preferential growth in the 100 direction (Table 3), except for the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst (for which the average crystallite sizes in the 001 and 100 directions were quite similar), suggesting the presence of spherical metallic particles in this catalyst [52]. The reduced FeCe50Zr50 sample showed the smallest value for the crystallite size ascribed to the Fe° phase in the 100 direction (L100 ), while the other catalysts presented similar L100 values."
10,CO2-TPD and H2-TPD analyses,"3.5 CO2-TPD and H2-TPD analyses Understanding of the adsorption of CO2 and H2 on the reduced catalysts is extremely important for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction [28,53]. Therefore, CO2-TPD and H2-TPD experiments were performed to elucidate the effects of the basicity properties and the H2 adsorption features of the catalysts. Fig. 8 a and b show the CO2-TPD profiles for the bare supports and the catalysts, respectively. According to Cutrufello and coworkers [54], it is difficult to predict the basicity features of CeO2-ZrO2 binary oxides. The results of the present work showed that the addition of Zr to CeO2 acted to increase the total basicity of the bare support, with the highest amounts of basic sites for the Ce75Zr25 sample (Table 4 ). The presence of Zr4+ (0.084 nm) in the Ce-enriched support created structural defects in the fluorite lattice, considering that the former anion is smaller than Ce4+ (0.101 nm), consequently increasing oxygen mobility (as discussed in Raman section) and CO2 adsorption capacity. Conversely, the total basicity decreased with increase of the Zr concentration, with the lowest value for the Zr100 sample (Table 4). The distribution of the basic sites (weak, moderate, and strong) was not influenced by the composition of the supports, and the same was observed for the peak desorption positions (except for the Zr100 sample, for which there was no contribution of moderate basic sites). Additionally, the signal ascribed to the weak basic sites could be deconvoluted into three contributing peaks for the Zr100 sample, instead of the two peaks as observed for the other supports (Fig. S4a), probably due to the presence of both tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia phases, with the CO2 being adsorbed in the form of bidentate carbonate on certain sites [55]. The effects of the presence of iron species in the supports were complex. The pure iron oxide sample (Fe100) featured almost no basic sites, when compared with the other catalysts. In general, the total amounts of basic sites for the catalysts followed a similar trend as for the bare supports. The total basicity clearly diminished after the incorporation of iron in Ce100 and Zr100. In the former case, the specific surface area of the fresh FeCe100 catalyst was lower than that of Ce100 (Table 2), so the surface available for CO2 adsorption decreased after iron incorporation. Although the FeZr100 specific surface area was higher than that of the Zr100 support (Table 2), the agglomeration of the iron species on the surface, as suggested in Fig. 5, could block the access of the CO2 molecules to the basic sites. Different to the corresponding supports, the contribution of each type of basic sites was affected by the CeO2 and ZrO2 concentrations. The contribution of strong basic sites diminished as the ceria concentration decreased, in the order FeCe100 > FeCe75Zr25 > FeCe50Zr50, with no strong basic sites for the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst. The contribution of moderate strength basic sites decreased in the order FeCe50Zr50 > FeCe25Zr75 > FeZr100, as the contribution of the strong sites increased and reached the highest percent contribution for the FeZr100 catalyst, which featured no moderate strength basic sites, as observed for the Zr100 sample. The desorption peak positions first shifted to higher temperatures when the composition of the catalyst support changed from FeCe100 to FeCe75Zr25, then shifted to much lower temperatures for FeCe50Zr50 (Fig. S4b). This suggested that the catalyst support composition influenced the mechanism of CO2 adsorption on the catalyst. Since FeCe50Zr50 presented the smallest crystallite size ascribed to Fe°, considering the 100 direction (Table 3), these species probably exhibited a greater degree of dispersion on the surface, allowing the CO2 to easily reach the sites responsible for its adsorption and to be easily desorbed as the temperature increased in the TPD experiment. This agreed with Zhang and coworkers [29], who reported that increased CO2 adsorption ability resulted from defects caused by restrained growth of the hematite phase and its reduction phases FeOx and Fe°. These effects appeared to contribute to maximizing the occupation of the moderate strength basic sites and completely suppressing adsorption on the strong sites of the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst. In contrast, as the composition changed from FeCe50Zr50 to FeZr100, the iron phases appeared to become more agglomerated on the surface, which could hinder access of the CO2 molecules to the basic sites, while the molecules that reached these sites eventually became strongly linked to them. Therefore, the total amount of basic sites decreased considerably from FeCe50Zr50 to FeZr100 (Table 4), with over 50 % of the basicity being related to the CO2 molecules that were adsorbed on the strong basic sites. The H2-TPD curves for the bare supports and catalysts after reduction at 550 °C (Fig. 9 a and b, respectively) showed complex profiles, as observed for the CO2-TPD curves. The Ce100 support showed an intense peak at around 150 °C, which could be ascribed to H2 adsorption on the surface oxygen vacancies of the ceria. As shown in Fig. S5, the H2-TPD profile of the Ce100 sample could be decomposed into two additional peaks, at around 225 and 400 °C, possibly associated with H2 desorption from the inner defects [56,57]. The Zr100 support presented a desorption profile different to that for Ce100, suggesting that the H2 adsorption occurred differently on each sample. In the case of the Zr100 sample, there was a small contribution of a desorption peak at relatively low temperature (∼190 °C), while release of most of the adsorbed H2 was associated with desorption peaks at higher temperatures (>350 °C). This showed that H2 was probably bound on the sub-stoichiometric ZrO2-x sites produced during the pretreatment step carried out before the H2 adsorption [58]. However, the results obtained in the present work did not allow any definitive conclusions to be reached concerning the way that the H2 adsorption occurred on the oxides after the reduction pretreatment. According to the H2-TPR results, as the Zr content increased, earlier ceria reduction occurred, which facilitated the creation of surface vacancies and lattice defects during the H2 pretreatment step. This earlier reduction was observed for both Ce50Zr50 and Ce25Zr75, since no hydrogen consumption occurred at high temperature for these samples, as discussed in the H2-TPR section. The addition of Zr to the ceria led to substantial increases of the contributions of the H2 desorption peaks at moderate and high temperatures (200−400 °C and > 400 °C, respectively) (Table 5 ), suggesting that the nature of the H2 adsorption was quite distinct from that for the oxides alone. For the catalysts, besides the H2 contribution ascribed to each support, there was also the contribution of several types of iron species produced during the treatment with H2. The deconvolution curves ascribed to the H2 desorption of the reduced catalysts are also shown in Fig. S5. H2 desorption peaks below 200 °C are usually ascribed to weak H bonding to the metallic iron species, while peaks between 200 and 275 °C correspond to stronger H bonding to the Fe° in more intimate contact with the support. In the range 275−450 °C, there is the contribution of H2 adsorbed on the FeOx species (partially reduced iron oxides). At temperatures higher than 500 °C, desorption is ascribed to the H2 that spills over from the metal to the support [53,59], while the range of 450−500 °C may be ascribed to the H that bonds with a stronger strength to the partially reduced iron species. In the present work, none of the catalysts featured peaks at temperatures lower than 200 °C. The first peaks of the catalysts were decomposed in the temperature range 200−275 °C (except for the Fe100 sample), suggesting the presence of H2 adsorbed on Fe° species in intimate contact with the support. This first peak shifted to higher temperatures from FeCe100 to FeCe50Zr50, and then to lower temperatures from FeCe50Zr50 to FeZr100, indicating that the adsorption of hydrogen on the metallic iron species first became stronger as the Zr concentration increased, reaching a maximum for the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, and then became weaker as the Zr content increased further. This trend also followed the crystallite size, considering the 100 direction, of the Fe° species formed during the H2 pretreatment at 550 °C. The FeCe50Zr50 catalyst showed the presence of some Fe° species with the smallest crystallite size, suggesting the existence of dispersed metallic particles that could provide stronger H binding. Considering the heterogeneous features of the polycrystalline powder, several planes of the Fe° particles would be exposed to the H2 chemisorption [59], despite to the fact that the deconvolution curves of the H2-TPD shows desorption peaks from the Fe° species (red curves in the Fig. S5) ranging between 200−275 °C, that would be ascribed to the H2 adsorption on the (110) iron facets [60]. Since the fresh Fe100 sample was constituted by hematite particles with larger sizes, its pretreatment under a 10 % H2/N2 flow at 550 °C probably mainly led to unreduced FeOx species, as discussed previously in the H2-TPR section. This could explain the deconvolution peaks at 360, 575, and 760 °C, ascribed to different strengths of H bonding on the partially reduced oxides."
11,Catalytic tests,"3.6 Catalytic tests The performances of the catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure are summarized in Table 6 . The supports were also evaluated, in all cases showing CO2 conversion close to 1% and selectivity of 100 % towards CO formation. The temperature corresponding to 370 °C was selected to catalyst evaluation considering previous works that performed the CO2 hydrogenation to light hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure [17,22], in order to achieve a noticeable/reasonable olefins product yield considering the feed of CO2 [61], because values much superior to the atmospheric, that is an important parameter to achieve high yields towards hydrocarbons, were not considered in this present work. The results shown in Table 6 suggested that the RWGS reaction (Reaction [1]) was an intermediate in CO2 hydrogenation, producing CO that was further hydrogenated to hydrocarbons (Reaction [2]) [53]. Hence, the products consisted of CO and hydrocarbons, with a main production of methane, considering that the catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure. Compared to the catalysts with iron on the pure CeO2 or ZrO2 oxides (FeCe100 and FeZr100, respectively), as well as the pure iron catalyst (Fe100), the FeCe75Zr25, FeCe50Zr50, and FeCe25Zr75 catalysts improved the CO2 conversion and the products distribution. This showed that the combination of ceria and zirconia oxides with the iron species improved the catalytic performance by changing the physical-chemical properties of the material. The CO2 conversion and selectivity towards olefins first increased as the Zr content increased, reaching the highest values for the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, and then decreased, while the selectivity towards the paraffins productions reached a maximum value for the FeCe25Z575 catalyst, as shown in Table 6. As commented previously, the highest CO2 conversion was achieved using the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst. The CO2 conversion could be related to the total amount of basic sites, as shown in Fig. 10 . To establish a relationship between the total catalyst basicity and the CO2 conversion, it was considered that any desorption peak at temperature higher than the temperature used for the catalytic test (370 °C) probably did not contribute to the CO2 conversion (see Table 4 footnotes) [23]. According to Zhang and coworkers [29], CeO2 decreases the H2 adsorption ability, which hinders the hydrogenation of CO produced in the RWGS reaction (Reaction [1]). Here, the FeCe100 catalyst presented the lowest amount of adsorbed H2, among the catalysts containing Ce and/or Zr (Table 5). This could provide an explanation for the fact that this sample was one of the most selective towards the production of CO, rather than hydrocarbon products, followed by the FeZr100 and Fe100 catalysts. The lowest selectivity towards CO was obtained for FeCe25Zr75, although it was the most selective towards paraffin production, among the catalysts evaluated. This suggested that the surface of this catalyst was able to further hydrogenate the olefins, enhancing the production of saturated hydrocarbons [23,53]. For CO2 conversion, the FeCe75Z25 catalyst was more effective than FeCe25Zr75, despite the higher CO selectivity with the former, suggesting that this catalyst was less selective towards the hydrogenation of CO by means of the FT reaction (Reaction [2]). As shown in Fig. 11 , the iron carbide phase in the spent catalysts are both Fe5C2 and Fe3C species. The former types of carbides are usually considered to be more active towards the F-T reaction, as the Fe3C are more stable species [37]. Fe5C2 is usually ascribed to facilitate the olefins desorption by minimizing the secondary hydrogenation reaction, that is responsible to transform olefins to paraffins [62]; studies also performed by Zhang and coworkers [62] also suggests that the F3C species promotes the hydrogenation of the light olefins. Fig. 12 illustrates the desorption signal ascribed to the decomposition of the iron carbides that are present in the spent catalysts. The areas of each peak, that was the result from the deconvolution of the curves, can be consulted in Table S3, and can be associated to the presence of these carbides species. These results corroborate with the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 11, confirming the presence of these two types of iron carbides. As the O/P ratios values are greater for the Fe100, FeCe100 and FeZr100 than for the other catalysts, it could be inferred that these samples featured higher Fe5C2 species relative to the Fe3C. However, the amounts of sites ascribed to the Fe5C2 is greater in the CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts (Peak 1 in Fig. 12, and Table S3), as they presented higher CO2 conversions and smaller selectivity values towards CO production, suggesting that the CO produced by the RWGS was converted in a greater extent to hydrocarbons with this type of iron carbide. Nonetheless the values ascribed to the O/P ratios show a higher paraffin production compared to the olefin formation, which suggests that these catalysts presented higher Fe3C species relative to the Fe5C2, that was the opposite to the Fe100, FeCe100 and FeZr100 catalysts. Additionally, the second peak (red curves in Fig. 12) might be ascribed to Fe5C2 species with greater stability, or Fe3C species, or even both. As the FeCe75Zr25, FeCe50Zr50 and FeCe25Zr75 presented the smallest O/P values and greatest selectivity towards the paraffins, especially the FeCe25Zr75 sample, it could be said that for these catalysts the major contribution of that peak might be ascribed to the presence of Fe3C species. Besides, among these three catalysts, the FeCe25Zr75 also featured a peak with a sharp intensity ascribed to the Fe3O4 phase (Fig. 11). As H2 easily dissociates on magnetite, the secondary hydrogenation of the olefins is improved, implying to a higher paraffins formation, and to higher selectivity towards CH4 [63,64], that in fact assumed the greatest value with this catalyst, as shows Table 6. Among the samples constituted of both CeO2 and ZrO2, the FeCe25Zr75 sample presented the lowest selectivity towards CO; compared to the FeCe75Zr25 catalyst, the results presented in both Table S3 and in Fig. 12 suggests (qualitatively) that the former contained higher amounts of iron carbides, which implicates that the CO produced by means of the RWGS was converted in greater extent. However, the values ascribed to the total areas below the curves in Fig. 12 are similar for both FeCe50Zr50 and FeCe25Zr75, which may suggest that these two catalysts feature equivalent amounts of iron carbides species, despite to the fact that the selectivity towards CO assumed higher values for the former sample. One explanation may lie on the fact that the iron carbides species that are present in FeCe25Zr75 catalyst may be less stable and more reactive than the species featured by the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, as suggested by the shift of the first peak (blue curve) to lower temperature, and also by the absence of the shoulder at around 575 °C with the former catalyst, which explains its smaller CO selectivity, as the CO produced by means of RWGS was mainly converted to CH4 and light paraffins. The hydrocarbons products distribution obtained with the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst was considered the most appropriate among the catalysts studied, since it presented the highest yield of olefins, as shown in Table 6, despite of the fact that the selectivity towards the paraffins was higher than that towards the olefins for the catalysts constituted by the combination between CeO2 and ZrO2. Although the Fe100 catalyst provided the highest olefin selectivity ascribed to the presence of Fe5C2 species, this catalyst did not feature a suitable balance between the CO2 adsorption capacity, with only a small quantity of basic sites available (Table 4), and the uptake of H2 for subsequent hydrogenation of the CO produced. These facts explain the lowest CO2 conversion for the pure iron catalyst, also leading to the lowest products yields. According to Satthawong and coworkers [53], the H2 desorption peaks up to 370−400 °C are related to the sites favorable for hydrogenation of the olefins, contributing to increase the production of CH4 and paraffins. Hence, any H2 desorption peak at temperature lower than this temperature range could lead to decreased selectivity towards olefins production, while increasing the selectivity towards both methane and paraffins. The hydrocarbon products distribution for the iron-based catalysts constituted of CeO2 and/or ZrO2 could also be related to the CO2 and H2 adsorption properties of these materials. Fig. 13 relates the CO2 and H2 uptakes to the selectivity towards hydrocarbons production, considering the deconvoluted CO2 and H2 desorption peaks that effectively contributed to the reaction (the peaks at temperatures lower than 370 °C). For the Ce and/or Zr iron-based catalysts, the olefins selectivity appeared to increase as the CO2 adsorption capacity increased, while the H2 uptake decreased. In other words, the production of olefins increased as the CO2/H2 ratio on the catalyst surface increased. This relationship can be seen more clearly in Fig. S6, which shows that the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst presented the highest CO2/H2 ratio for the adsorbed gases (Figs. 13 and S6), resulting in a surface C/H ratio that led to the best products distribution (Table 6), among the catalysts evaluated. The FeCe25Zr75 catalyst showed one of the highest CO2/H2 ratios for the adsorbed gases but presented high selectivity towards the production of methane and paraffins. For this catalyst, the H2 desorption peaks ascribed to the H species strongly linked to the Fe° particles (red lines- 200−275 °C) and to the H species with a weak interaction with both the FeOx and support (blue lines 275−400 °C) (Fig. S5) reached a maximum at temperatures lower than the corresponding peaks for the FeCe50Zr50 sample. These facts indicated that H2 was adsorbed with weaker strength in the former catalyst, which could facilitate the secondary hydrogenation reactions responsible to produce short chain saturated hydrocarbons, and methane, as discussed previously. The results reported here suggest that much work remains to improve the performance of iron-based catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, especially if the objective is to produce olefins rather than paraffins, as discussed previously. Da Silva and coworkers [61] found that a Fe-Cr-K/Nb2O5 catalyst evaluated at 400 °C and atmospheric pressure (H2/CO2 = 3/1, total flow of 30 mL min−1, and 0.5 g of catalyst) showed 33 % selectivity towards CO production, which was much lower than the CO selectivity obtained in the present work, together with a 5% yield of light olefins. Torrente-Murciano [24] used an iron catalyst supported on rod-shaped ceria in CO2 hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure, obtaining Sco = 64.5 % and SC2-C4olefins = 2.84 %, at 350 °C (H2/CO2 = 3/1, total flow of 8 mL min-1, and 0.3 g of catalyst). Owen and coworkers [19] employed similar conditions as used in this work (T = 370 °C, H2/CO2 = 3/1, total flow of 8 mL min-1, and 0.7 g of catalyst). It was found that the yield of C2-C4 olefins could be improved from 0.17 % to 4.2 % when the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was promoted by the addition of 3 wt.% of indium to the silica support. In the present work, the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, which showed the best performance, provided Sco = 77.8 % and Solefins = 1.96 %, while the olefins yield was 0.5 % (Table 6). This demonstrated that materials composed of iron supported on ceria-zirconia solid solutions have potential for use as catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at atmospheric pressure, although catalyst design modifications are still required, including the use of promoters and improved synthesis methods."
12,Conclusions,"CexZr(1-x)O2 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) iron-based catalysts, prepared using a one-pot procedure, were applied in the CO2 hydrogenation with the aim of producing light hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure. The influence of the CeO2 and ZrO2 combination on the catalyst performance was evaluated, considering the molar concentrations of ceria and zirconia. The results showed that the catalyst composition was an important variable to be considered, since it influenced the physical-chemical properties related to the CO2 and H2 adsorption uptakes. As one example, although the pure Fe2O3 iron oxide (Fe100 catalyst) presented the highest selectivity towards olefins due to the presence of adequate carbide phases, the balance between the CO2 adsorption capacity (with small amounts of basic sites) and the H2 uptake properties was unsuitable for further hydrogenation of the CO produced. This resulted in one of the highest selectivity towards CO formation, among the samples evaluated, together with low CO2 conversion. For the iron-based catalysts constituted of CeO2 and/or ZrO2, the CO2 conversion and selectivity towards olefins first increased as the Zr content increased, reaching the highest values for the FeCe50Zr50 catalyst, and then decreased with further increase of the Zr concentration. The highest CO2 conversion achieved with this catalyst could be attributed to the quantity of basic sites. In addition, an appropriate balance between the amounts of adsorbed CO2 and H2 could provide a suitable surface C/H concentration ratio, with the best product distribution achieved using the FeCe50Zr50 sample. The findings showed that catalysts consisting of iron supported on ceria-zirconia solid solutions may potentially be used in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at atmospheric pressure, although further work is still required to improve the performance of these catalysts, especially aiming to stabilize the carbide phases into the desired carbide phases (Fe5C2), which produces more olefins than paraffins."
