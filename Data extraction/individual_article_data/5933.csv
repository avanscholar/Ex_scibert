0,Introduction,"As secondary energy source, hydrogen energy has become one of the most remarkable clean energy due to non-toxicity, high utilization rate, and environment-friendly advantages [1–3]. Among the numerous methods for hydrogen evolution, electrocatalytic water splitting is considered to be one of the most convenient and fruitful approach [3–5]. In order to effectively develop this way, the search for a highly active and durable electrocatalyst is imminent. Currently, the most desirable platinum-based catalyst has been limited in this field due to its high manufactured cost [6–9]. Therefore, developing a cost-effective electrocatalyst, which can reduce the overpotential of hydrogen evolution and maintain the good durability, is of far-reaching importance and even more challenging. As a typical material of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides, MoS2 has attracted much attention in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its highly stability, proper hydrogen absorption free energy, and accessibility [10–16]. In the previous literature, as for the most widely studied 2H (hexagonal symmetry) MoS2, it is found that only the unsaturated S atoms at the edge are chemically active for the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen, while the basal plane occupying a larger area is chemically inert [17,18]. For the purpose of enhancing the HER activity of MoS2, researchers have adopted the following methods. (i) The phase structure of MoS2 was changed from thermodynamically stable 2H to metastable 1T (trigonal symmetry) or 3R (rhombohedral symmetry) phase to enhance its intrinsic conductivity with increasing the active sites [19–21]. For example, Liu designed an advanced electrocatalyst that consists of 1T-MoS2 nanopatches supported on the single-walled carbon nanotube films. The electron transfer in this heterostructure weakens the absorption energy of H atom, bring about the promising performance [19]. (ii) Coupling MoS2 with other highly conductive carbonaceous materials is also a wise way, which can effectively improve its electronic conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of the materials [22–24]. He demonstrated a hydrothermal process to grow 3D MoS2 coated with reduced graphene oxide on molybdenum mesh. The increased conductivity, abundant active sites and structural integrity gave rise to excellent performance [23]. (iii) Elemental doping has been known as a promising method to perfect the electrocatalytic HER performance by modifying the surface structure and conductivity [25,26]. Zinc-doped MoS2 were prepared successfully by Chen's group, which exhibits desirable activity toward HER owing to the synergistic effect of rich active sites and modulation of energy level induced by the transition-metal doping [8]. There is no doubt that the foresaid efforts inspired us. At present, the suitable introduction of active materials and effective doping are imperative for improving the HER properties of MoS2 and still hot topics. However, MoS2-based materials may suffer from several weaknesses, such as single and uncontrollable morphology, fewer active sites in the inert plane, and weaker charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, the rational combination of chemical and structural stable carbonaceous core and highly active MoS2 shell with controllable engineering of structural and electronic effects induced by heteroatom doping is of profound importance and indeed more demanding and challenging. Herein, a calcination and hydrothermal route was developed to synthesize a hierarchical N-C@P-MoS2 core-shell structures employed in electrocatalytic HER. Hollow N-doped carbon spheres (N-CS) serve as matrix materials, nucleation sites and charge transfer channels to accelerate the growth of P-MoS2 nanosheets, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity as well as getting rid of the aggregation. Meanwhile, P-MoS2 provides the more exposed active sites, larger interlayer spacing, and effective electron transport to facilitate the absorption and desorption of hydrogen on the surface of catalysts. The synergy of structural (morphology and composition contents) and electronic (conductivity and active sites) effects aroused more active HER performance of N-C@P-MoS2 than that of the N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) and other contrast samples verified by a systematic electrochemical HER test."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), resorcinol (R), formaldehyde (F), ethylenediamine (EDA), ammonia solution (NH3·H2O), ethanol, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium molybdate dehydrate (NaMoO4·2H2O), thioacetamide (TAA), and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All reagents were used as received without purification."
3,Synthesis of N-CS and hollow carbon sphere (HCS),"2.2 Synthesis of N-CS and hollow carbon sphere (HCS) SiO2@N-RF spheres (EDA, resorcinol, and formaldehyde decorated SiO2 spheres) as the precursors of N-CS were synthesized by a modified Stöber method. Typically, TEOS of 3.6 mL was added into a homogeneous mixed solution with ethanol of 35 mL, H2O of 20 mL, and NH3·H2O of 2 mL with stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Then, resorcinol (0.3 g), formaldehyde (0.45 mL), and EDA (0.64 mL) were added to the solution with vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. Afterwards, as-prepared solution was centrifuged with ethanol and water for several times, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight to acquire sample SiO2@N-RF. The SiO2@N-RF spheres were calcined at 800 °C for 3 h (1 °C/min) in argon atmosphere to obtain sample SiO2@N-C. Finally, NaOH solution of 1 M was used to remove the SiO2 cores of SiO2@N-C attaining sample N-CS. The preparation process of HCS is similar to sample N-CS, expect for the absence of EDA in the synthesis process."
4,Synthesis of samples with core-shell structures,"2.3 Synthesis of samples with core-shell structures N-C@P-MoS2: SiO2@N-C (0.1 g) nanospheres were dissolved in NaOH to remove SiO2 templates firstly. Then the obtained N-CS were added into H2O (20 mL) with sonication. NaMoO4·2H2O (0.1 g), TAA (0.2 g), and NH4H2PO4 (3.3 mg) were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water with stirring for 1 h to make a well-mixed precursor solution. Finally, the above precursor solution was added into N-CS solution dropwise for 30 min. The obtained black solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 220 °C for 24 h. The resultants were collected and washed with water and ethanol followed by drying at 60 °C in vacuum. Then, the obtained black powder were calcined in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere to acquire the final core-shell N-C@P-MoS2. Changing the amounts of NaMoO4·2H2O, TAA, and NH4H2PO4 resulted in the core-shell N-C@P-MoS2 with different loading amounts of P-MoS2. N-C@MoS2: The preparation procedure is similar to that of N-C@P-MoS2. The major difference is the absence of NH4H2PO4 in the synthesis of precursor solution. C@MoS2: Replacing the N-CS with HCS, and the precursor solution was only containing NaMoO4·2H2O and TAA. Other experimental conditions keep consistent. Table 1 illustrates the preparation conditions of samples."
5,P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets capsulated in N-CS,"2.4 P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets capsulated in N-CS P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets were capsulated in N-CS as samples N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) and N-C/MoS2 (inside), respectively. The synthetic method and chemical amounts of N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) are roughly same as core-shell N-C@P-MoS2. The slow dropping rate is critical in this preparation process. The uniform precursor solution containing NaMoO4·2H2O, TAA, and NH4H2PO4 was added dropwise into the N-CS solution for at least 2 h under the magnetic stirring. The synthesis process of N-C/MoS2 (inside) also needs controlling the dropping rate but the precursor solution does not need NH4H2PO4."
6,Synthesis of P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets,"2.5 Synthesis of P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets As for control experiment, P-doped and undoped MoS2 nanosheets were prepared as samples P-MoS2 and MoS2, respectively. NaMoO4·2H2O (0.1 g) and TAA (0.2 g) were dissolved in H2O (60 mL) under stirring for 1 h, then the uniform solution was transferred to autoclave and heated at 220 °C for 24 h. The precipitates were collected with centrifugation and dried at 60 °C. P-MoS2 nanosheets were prepared with the same procedure by adding NH4H2PO4 (3.3 mg) in precursors."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was carried out using a JEOL-2100 microscope under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation was carried out on a transmission electron microscope (FEIG2F20 TEM) to characterize the morphology and structure of samples. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses were performed on MFA-140 to characterize the specific surface areas of the samples. The phase composition and crystal structure of samples were confirmed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance with Cu Kα radiation, Germany). A Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA JOBIN YVON SAS) was employed for measuring Raman spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250 spectrometer to further analyze the atomic valence. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, QUANTA 250 FEG, FEI, America) was also used for observing the morphology of samples."
8,Electrochemical tests,"2.7 Electrochemical tests All electrochemical measurements were performed on a conventional three-electrode system using a CHI 660E electrochemical analyzer. A glassy carbon electrode with diameter of 3.0 mm was used as the working electrode, a graphite rod and an Ag/AgCl electrode serve as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Before using, the working electrode was supposed to polish with alumina powder and dry at room temperature after sonicating for several seconds. For preparing the working electrode, the electrocatalyst was dispersed in a solution of water, alcohol, and Nafion solution (5 wt%, Dupont) (Vwater/Valcohol/VNafion = 4:1:0.025) to form a uniform catalyst ink. The concentrations of all the catalysts were 2 mg mL−1. Afterwards, 6 μL of the catalyst ink (0.17 mg cm−2) was pipetted on the GCE. The loadings of all electrocatalysts keep consistent. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was confirmed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The stability test was obtained at the potential range from 0.2 V to −0.4 V with the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 1500 cycles. All the potentials are corrected to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation: (1) E RHE = E ( Ag/AgCl ) + 0.059 pH + 0.197 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed at a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Formation mechanism discussion,"3.1 Formation mechanism discussion The synthesis strategy of N-C@P-MoS2 core-shell structures is shown in Scheme 1 . Firstly, EDA as N source was added during the co-condensed of TEOS, resorcinol, and formaldehyde to synthesize the SiO2@N-RF nanospheres (Fig. S1d). Then, EDA and RF oligomers transferred to N-doped C shells on the SiO2 cores after the calcination at 800 °C in Ar atmosphere (Fig. S1e). Afterwards, the obtained SiO2@N-C nanospheres were easily turned into N-CS with uniform sizes by virtue of the etching for NaOH (Fig. S1f). The BET analysis demonstrates that the N-CS has large specific surface area (620.1 m2 g−1) and the main pore size is about 2.5 nm (Fig. S2a), facilitating the electron transport in HER. The growth process of HCS is similar with N-CS (Fig. S1a–c). The N-CS functioned as reaction matrix providing nucleation sites to make the uniform growth of petal-like P-doped MoS2 nanosheets after a one-pot hydrothermal process. For comparison, P-MoS2 nanosheets encapsulated inside N-CS (N-C/P-MoS2 (inside)) were prepared successfully by controlling the dropping speed precisely. As shown in Scheme S1, the growth mechanism of N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) is discussed. When P-MoS2 precursor solution was added into the N-CS solution dropwise slowly, the reactants were inclined to absorbing to rough inner wall of N-CS through the mesoporous on surface. N-CS employed as nanoreactor allow the MoS2 nanosheets to grow inside firstly under hydrothermal conditions. It is the slow dropping rate and mesoporous structure that play pivotal roles in the unique formation of N-C/P-MoS2 (inside)."
11,Morphology and microstructure characterization,"3.2 Morphology and microstructure characterization The TEM and HRTEM images of samples are shown in Fig. 1 . The N-CS with uniform size of 360 ± 15 nm and a shell thickness of ∼10 nm were obtained as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The porous and thin shells are conductive to the free diffusion of the reactants in the following reaction process. After long reaction time, it is found that the MoS2 nanopetals with average size of ∼200 nm were uniformly supported on the surface of N-CS, and still keep the integrity of the whole structure, which contributes to remaining the structural stability in the later electrocatalytic tests (Fig. 1d). When the NH4H2PO4 was added as P source, the morphologies of samples are almost remained unchanged (Fig. 2 e), indicating that the petal-like morphology of MoS2 did not change after P doping. Similar phenomena were also confirmed by pure MoS2 and P-MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S3). Fig. S2b shows that the N-C@P-MoS2-2 possesses large specific surface area (109.9 m2 g−1) and mesoporous (∼4.6 nm) structure, which supplies more active sites and transport channels for protons and electrons, enhancing the HER performance. As shown in Fig. 1f, the layer numbers of P-MoS2 nanosheets were generally less, which is attributed to the increased dispersity induced by N-CS as matrix materials, accelerating the charge transfer between the layers of MoS2. The interplanar spacing of P-MoS2 nanosheets ranges from 0.67 to 0.72 nm (Fig. 1g), demonstrating the enlarged interlayer spacing of (002) planes of 2H MoS2, exposing more active sites, which largely benefits to the absorption and desorption of hydrogen [27,28]. For comparison, the morphologies of N-C/P-MoS2 (inside) were observed in detail. It is clearly found that the P-MoS2 nanosheets were confined to encapsulate inside the N-CS, further confirming the above mentioned formation mechanism (Fig. 1h and i). BET results show that the sample has larger specific surface area (164.1 m2 g−1), primarily due to the porous carbon layer on the outer surface (Fig. S2c). Because of different structure, two samples revealed diverse effect on the electrocatalytic hydrogen production process. Other reference samples mentioned in the Experimental Section were characterized as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S4. Obviously, the loadings of MoS2 nanosheets increased as the amounts of precursor rising. What is more, N and P doping did not result in the change of morphology and size of overall structures. To further understand the crystal structure of samples, Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of pure MoS2, pure P-MoS2, core-shell N-C@P-MoS2-2, and N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside). The XRD peaks matched well with the crystal structure of 2H MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 37-1492). No other crystal phase was found in samples P-MoS2 and N-C@P-MoS2-2, which rules out the possibility of forming other phosphide, indicating the crystal structure of MoS2 did not changed by P dopants. The XRD peak centered at 14.4° corresponds to the (002) plane of pristine MoS2 with the layer spacing is about 0.62 nm. P-MoS2 nanosheets revealed a new XRD peak at 8.9°, while the original peak at 14.4° became weaker and broader. The low angle shift indicates increased interlayer spacing, confirming that P doping expanded the growth along the c axis of MoS2, which accelerates the transport and diffusion of H+. In addition, it is found that the P-MoS2 nanosheets combined with N-CS during the high-temperature calcination process, the crystallinity of each crystal plane is improved. It is worth noting that the difference of the XRD peak before 10° between the P-MoS2 nanosheets and N-C@P-MoS2-2 could be attributed to the synergistic effect of N-CS and P-MoS2 during the hydrothermal process. Additionally, the (002) peak of N-C@P-MoS2-2 shifts to low angle than that of N-C@MoS2-2, the increased interlayer spacing consistent finely with the HRTEM results, further verifying the presence of P element (Fig. S5b). Furthermore, the diffraction peak of carbon at 23° is more apparent in N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside) comparing with the core-shell structure, which characterizes the structural difference between two kinds of samples. The structure and morphology of these samples are more fully proved via Raman spectra (Fig. 2b). For pure MoS2, the two distinct peaks at 380.9 and 406.7 cm−1 represent the characteristic in-plane E1 2g and out-of-plane A1g vibration modes of 2H MoS2 (Fig. 2d) [29]. P doping does not alter the crystal structure of MoS2 from the Raman peaks of these samples. As shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks of composited heterostructures all appear blue-shift to some degree. It is well known that the difference in frequency between the two peaks decreases as the decrease of MoS2 layers [29]. The frequency difference for N-C@P-MoS2-2 of 23.1 cm−1 is smaller than that for N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside) of 24.8 cm−1, demonstrating the fewer MoS2 layers in the former structures, which is conductive to the contact with electrolyte, facilitating the shuttle of charge. In Fig. 2b, the two peaks centered at 1361 cm−1 and 1583 cm−1 were ascribed to the D and G bands of the carbon material, respectively [30]. The intensity of G band is higher than D band, which confirms the graphitization of carbon shells during the high-temperature calcination. Due to the N doping, the intensity ratio of D band to the G band (ID/IG) increased from 0.90 of HCS to 0.93 of N-CS, revealing the more structural defects and electronic structure change of N-CS after the introduction of N atoms, which favors the mass transport between N-CS and P-MoS2 (Fig. S5c). Furthermore, the intensity of the two peaks in N-C@P-MoS2-2 is significantly higher than that in N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside), indicating the structural differences between the two samples. XPS was utilized to characterize the surface chemical states as shown in Fig. 3 . The deconvoluted C 1s peaks at 284.3 eV, 285.6 eV, and 287.4 eV assigned to sp2-hybridized C-C, C-N, and CO species (Fig. 3b). N 1s peaks (Fig. 3c) indicates pyridinic N (pyri-N, ∼395.3 eV), quaternary N (quat-N, ∼400.4 eV), and pyrrolic N (pyrr-N, ∼398.1 eV). The peak of N 1s at a binding energy of about 394.2 eV is attributed to Mo 3p [31,32]. Quaternary N can only improve the electronic conductivity of the carbon layer because it cannot cause defects, while pyridinic and pyrrolic N can destroy the ordered spatial structure of carbon to produce defects, which not only improves the conductivity, but also contributes to the nucleation growth and mutual contact between MoS2 and the carbon sphere surfaces, largely enhancing the electrocatalytic HER performance [29]. Two main subpeaks of Mo represent Mo 3d3/2 (∼232.4 eV) and Mo 3d5/2 (∼228.7 eV), respectively, showing the presence of Mo4+. A weak peak centered at 235.6 was attributed to the oxidized Mo6+ (Fig. 3d) [33]. Fig. 3e shows the high resolution S 2p spectra. The peaks centered at 161.6 eV and 162.8 eV corresponding to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. Additionally, the binding energy at 163.9eV exhibits the existence of bridging disulfides S2-2, which mainly results from the lattice distortion of MoS2 with the introduction of P elements, thereby increasing the exposed terminated plane and active sites directly, corresponding to the high HER activity [34]. Moreover, a shoulder peak exhibits at ∼160.8 eV, which is likely ascribed to the 1T MoS2 peaks induced by the introduction of P dopants [35,36]. The weight content of P in N-C@P-MoS2-2 is about 1%, XPS cannot accurately measure the P element due to low doping amount. When the P content is increased to 5%, the weaker peak at about 131.1 eV manifests the presence of P (Fig. 3f) [28]."
12,Electrocatalytic performance of samples,"3.3 Electrocatalytic performance of samples The electrocatalytic HER performance of above mentioned samples is studied via precise three-electrode systems. Fig. 4 a shows the HER polarization curves of the C@MoS2, N-C@MoS2, and N-C@P-MoS2. Meanwhile, the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was used to comparison, which showed the best HER performance with the smallest onset overpotential. It is clearly found that the N-C@MoS2 nanospheres revealed better HER activities compared with sample C@MoS2 under the same loadings, indicating N atoms do enhance the intrinsic conductivity of materials by modifying the electronic structure with the irregular charge distribution of adjacent C atoms, which is in accord with the XPS analysis. In addition, comparing the activities between N-C@P-MoS2 and N-C@MoS2, introducing P into MoS2 nanosheets largely accelerated the hydrogen evolution. The P atoms modulate the electronic structure of basal plane of MoS2 via replacing the S atoms, changing the electronic state of neighboring S atoms, which enhancing the intrinsic electrical conductivity. What is more, P atoms function as new active sites, enlarging the interlayer spacing and increasing the density of active sites. The active P and S atoms in vertical and horizontal arranged MoS2 absorbed H to form P-H and S-H bond to make the hydrogen production, speeding up the HER process [37]. The above possible reaction pathway of N-C@P-MoS2 towards HER is shown in Fig. 4e. Herein, the dual nonmetal doping of N and P play pivotal role in enhancing HER performance with electronic effect. As expected, among all core-shell samples, N-C@P-MoS2-2 exhibit the best HER performance with lower onset overpotential (117 mV), lower overpotential (188 mV) to attain the current density of 10 mA cm−2, and higher current density under the same potential, which was 3.0 and 12.3 times higher than that of C@MoS2-2 and pure P-MoS2 nanosheets, respectively. (Table 2 and Table S1). Besides the electronic effect, the structural and morphology effect also make a difference to HER activities. As shown in Fig. 4c, P-MoS2 nanosheets were encapsulated inside the N-CS, the HER performance was obviously more inferior compared with N-C@P-MoS2-2. From Table S1, it is found that the current density of the latter was 2.3 times higher than that of N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside), which was ascribed to the fact that the main active sites of P-MoS2 were exposed on the surface, which facilitates the contact with electrolyte. For another, the P-MoS2 nanosheets encapsulated in N-CS were mostly in agglomerated state, the poor dispersibility makes it impossible to connect the electrolyte effectively and carry out efficient proton absorption and hydrogen desorption process. The electrocatalytic activities of N-CS, pure MoS2 and P-MoS2 were also investigated under the same conditions, which is much lower compared with the hierarchical core-shell structure, strongly proving that the synergy between the N-CS and P-MoS2 activates the absorption and desorption for hydrogen, arising the better HER performance (Fig. S6). To further get insight to the HER mechanism and reaction path of catalysts, Tafel slopes were fitted from polarization curves (Fig. 4b). As is well known, there are two basic reaction processes in the hydrogen evolution, Volmer-Tafel mechanism and Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [38,39]. First is a primary proton absorption step (Volmer reaction): (2) M + H+ + e− ⇆ M-Hads Then this step is followed by a desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction): (3) M-Hads + H+ + e− ⇆ M + H2 or a recombination step (Tafel reaction): (4) 2M-Hads ⇆ 2M + H2 Tafel slope is an intrinsic property of catalysts that is involved with the rate-determining step. As shown in Fig. 4b, with the introduction of N and P dopants, Tafel slopes of these samples range from 87 to 68 mV/dec, revealing that the rate-determining step transited from Volmer to Heyrovsky reaction. Among all the samples, N-C@P-MoS2-2 has the smallest slopes (68 mV/dec), which is closest to the value of Pt/C (24 mV/dec), suggesting the faster electron transfer rate and more favorable HER kinetics induced by the synergy of N and P doping. From Fig. 4d, the Tafel slopes confirmed that the rate-determining step of N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside) was Volmer reaction, processing the sluggish HER reaction kinetics, which is in accord with the previous results. Furthermore, the exchange current densities calculated by the extrapolation of Tafel plots were investigated to estimate electron transfer kinetics (Fig. S7) [40]. The value of N-C@P-MoS2-2 is 19.953 μA/cm2, which is much larger than that of C@MoS2-2 (3.163 μA/cm2), N-C@MoS2-2 (8.912 μA/cm2), and N-C/P-MoS2-2 (inside) (6.310 μA/cm2). Such results further implies the N-C@P-MoS2-2 has the larger active area and faster electron transfer rate, which facilitates the rate-determining step during the HER process, indicating the favorable HER kinetics. Additionally, stability and durability are momentous criteria to evaluate the HER performance of catalysts. It is worth noting that the polarization curves of N-C@P-MoS2-2 almost overlays with the initial one with little difference at high potential region, after the continuous cyclic voltammograms for 1500 cycles (Fig. 5 a). The Time-dependent current density curve was also performed by chronoamperometry to evaluate the stability of electrocatalysts in long-term testing under the acidic conditions. Fig. 5b implies that the N-C@P-MoS2-2 can keep catalytic performance for at least 9 h with negligible attenuation, further confirming the promising stability of catalysts under an applied potential. To further explore the HER properties and reaction kinetics from another perspective of conductivity and active sites, EIS analysis were also employed as Fig. 6 a. The semicircle of N-C@P-MoS2-2 with smaller curvature in the high-frequency region demonstrates the smallest charge transfer resistance among other samples, corresponding to the faster charge transfer and reaction rate, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between P-MoS2 and N-CS induced by the co-doping of N and P. At the same time, the larger slope of line in the low-frequency region confirms that the N-C@P-MoS2-2 has the smallest diffusion impedance, indicating the accelerated electron shuttle between the electrolyte and electrode, bring out the faster reaction kinetics and better HER performance [4,41]. For the sake of manifesting active sites and making out the essence of HER, effective electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of catalysts were measured by capacitance current of double layer at the solid-liquid interface (Fig. S8 and Fig. 6b) [42]. N-C@P-MoS2-2 has larger double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value (8.31 mF cm−2) and larger ECSA (138.5 cm2) than other samples, which implies the much more exposed active sites, bring out the promising HER activity. The current density in HER polarization curves shown in Fig. 4c was normalized to the ECSA, as shown in Fig. S9, the trend of HER performance is consistent with the previous test, further suggesting that the HER of the prepared samples is a kinetic process rather than a simple surface effect [43,44]."
13,Effect of loadings and doping amounts of N-C@P-MoS2 for HER activity,"3.4 Effect of loadings and doping amounts of N-C@P-MoS2 for HER activity According to the above results, the electronic and structural effects are of significant importance to the HER activity of samples. In order to achieve optimal experimental variables to fully understand the catalytic activity of the samples, we performed hydrogen production tests on samples with different loadings and doping amounts. As the appropriate increase in loadings of MoS2, the HER activities were improved to some extent (Fig. 4a). However, owing to the fact that stacking of excessive layers hinders the charge transport between in-plane active sites, the sample with more loadings (N-C@P-MoS2-3) shows the weaker activity (Fig. S4f and Fig. S10). In addition, taking the key effect of P into account, the HER polarization curves of samples with different P doping contents were performed (Fig. S11). The poor HER activity of samples with less P dopants results from that a small amount of P atoms cannot fully exert its effect on modifying the MoS2 by increasing the active sites. Moreover, since that active P-sites were almost covered up by the surface of N-CS, the charge transfer between basal plane active sites was blocked severely, resulting in a depressed performance of samples with high P contents during the HER process. According to the above discussions, it is found that introducing the nonmetal dopants into hierarchical structures and adopting suitable amounts of catalyst play vital roles in boosting the HER activity. Table S2 summarizes the HER performance of N-C@P-MoS2-2 and other previous reported MoS2-based electrocatalysts, displaying the better activities than that of other electrocatalysts. As shown in Scheme 2 , the enhanced HER activity and stability are primarily attributed to the synergy of structural (morphology and composition contents) and electronic (conductivity and active sites) engineering. (i) The prepared hierarchical N-C@P-MoS2 structures with rational contents take N-CS as the matrix materials and P-MoS2 as the main active materials, bring larger active areas and specific surface areas. The presence of N-CS provides the nucleation sites to accelerate the growth of P-MoS2 nanosheets, which not only effectively avoids agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets to improve dispersibility of the system, but also maintains good stability during long-term electrochemical testing. (ii) The doped N atoms modulate the electronic redistribution of adjacent C atoms, compensating for the shortcomings of amorphous carbon spheres with low conductivity, which supplies more channels for the mass transport, effectively improving the electron transfer between N-CS and P-MoS2. (iii) The doped P atoms acted as new active sites modify the electronic structure of MoS2 with the replacement of some in-plane S atoms, increasing the interlayer spacing of the pristine MoS2 nanosheets and enriching the density of active sites in the inert plane, which contributes to faster electron transfer, and thus optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy to promote the HER performance [8,25]."
14,Conclusions,"The hierarchical core-shell structure of N-CS coated with P-MoS2 nanopetals was prepared by calcination and hydrothermal method with fine controllability and high reproducibility. By changing the contents of added precursor, the N-C@P-MoS2 with different loadings of MoS2 nanosheets and P dopants were readily obtained. Additionally, another structure of P-MoS2 nanosheets encapsulated inside the N-CS was synthesized by decreasing dropping rate of MoS2 precursor. During the HER process, comparing to pure MoS2 nanosheets, undoped samples, and inside-structural samples, it is clearly found that the N-C@P-MoS2-2 with appropriate loading amounts showed the best HER performance with minimal onset overpotential, smaller Tafel slope, and excellent stability and durability. The enhanced HER activity was mainly attributed to the synergy of structural and electronic engineering. On the one hand, the hierarchical structure combines the advantages of N-CS and P-MoS2, which gets rid of agglomeration and improves the stability. On the other hand, N and P dopants not only modulate the electronic structure to effectively enhance the intrinsic conductivity, but also increase the density of exposed active sites and enlarge the interlayer spacing, which is in favor of the faster proton absorption and hydrogen desorption in the HER process. This work provides a strategy for designing a rational hierarchical structure by various nonmetal doping with comprehensive structural and electronic engineering to be used in energy conversion and storage."
