0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (2-furan methanol) is an important chemical in polymer industry [1,2]. It is used mainly for the production of thermostatic resins, liquid resins used for strengthening ceramics. Furfuryl alcohol is also used in producing various synthetic fibers, rubber-resins and farm chemical [3,4]. It is an important chemical intermediate for the manufacture of lysine, Vitamin C, lubricant, dispersing agent and plasticizer. The hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is carried out either in the gas phase or in the liquid phase [5–8]. The catalyst mainly used for FAL hydrogenation in the industry is a Cu–Cr catalyst modified with various promoters [5]. The toxicity in Cu–Cr catalysts due to the presence of Cr2O3 cause severe environmental pollution. Application of Raney Ni; Raney Co and Raney Cu in the FAL hydrogenation have also been reported; but these catalysts show low activity or/and low selectivity [9]. Recently, a few works concerning the hydrogenation of furfural over heterogeneous catalysts have been published. Some of these are carbon-supported copper, Raney Ni, Nickel amorphous alloy and mixed copper zinc oxides with Al, Mn, and Fe [3,6,10–13]. Homogeneous complexes of Ru, Rh and Pt are also reported as active catalysts for the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol [14]. In our earlier communication, hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol is studied over Cu–MgO catalysts prepared by coprecipitation, impregnation and solid-solid wetting methods [15]. It has been observed that the catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method gave a higher conversion and higher selectivity towards the formation of FOL, than other catalysts. The present work is a detailed study dealing with the effect of Cu loading on the hydrogenation of furfural over coprecipitated Cu–MgO catalysts. All the catalysts have been well characterized by BET surface area, AAS (Atomic adsorption spectroscopy), DTA/TG, XRD and XPS. The hydrogenation activities of these catalysts have been correlated with the physico-chemical properties, wherever possible."
1,Experimental,"Cu–MgO catalysts with Cu loadings of 5.2, 10.1, 13.5, 16, 37.3, 42.9, 51.6 and 79.8% (in wt.%) are prepared by coprecipitation method and designated as CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4, CM5, CM6, CM7 and CM8. Aqueous solution of 1M each of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (M/S. Loba Chemie, India) and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (M/S. Loba Chemie, India) are mixed together. The mixed solution is precipitated at pH 9.0 by a slow addition of 1M aqueous solution of K2CO3 (M/S. Loba Chemie, India). The precipitate is filtered and washed three times with 500ml of distilled H2O and dried at 393K for 12h. The dried sample is then calcined in air at 723K for 4h and reduced in H2 flow at 523K for 4h prior activity study. The bulk CuO catalyst used for comparison of the activity with Cu–MgO catalyst is also prepared in a similar way using K2CO3 as the precipitating agent. XRD patterns are recorded using a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kα as a radiation source. Kratos axis 165 XPS spectrometer, with Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV), has been used for obtaining ESCA data. In the ESCA study, C1s binding energy value of 285eV is used as a reference and the relative atomic sensitivity factors of 4.871 and 0.168 for Cu2p3/2 and Mg2p, respectively, have been chosen for determining Cu/Mg surface compositions of reduced Cu–MgO samples. DTA/TGA profiles of Cu–MgO samples (in dried form) are recorded on a Metler Toledo 851E (Switzerland) instrument at a heating rate of 10Kmin−1 in air from 298 to 1273K. Vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor (200mm long and 8mm i.d.). About 1g of catalyst packed at the center of reactor between two plugs of quartz wool has been reduced in a flow of 6% H2 in He mixture at 523K for 4h followed by lowering the temperature of the reactor to 453K and replacing the H2/He mixture with ultra pure H2 (99.9% H2 which is further purified by passing through de-oxo and molecular sieve traps kept in series to remove oxygen and moisture, respectively). Furfural (1.2ml/h) is injected with the help of a syringe pump (Secura FT, B. Braun Germany) with H2/furfural (molar ratio=2.5). H2 flow has been monitored using rotameter. Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) has been maintained at 0.05molh−1 gcat−1. The product mixture was collected every hour in an ice-cold trap and analyzed by a GC–MS (QP-5050, M/S. Shimadzu instruments, Japan) using a DB-5MS capillary column of 0.32mm dia. and 25m long (M/S. J&W Scientific Instruments, USA)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,BET-surface area and XRD results,"3.1 BET-surface area and XRD results Table 1 presents the BET-surface areas and the crystalline phases of different Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalysts both in calcined and reduced form. The surface area of MgO is found to be 38m2 g−1 and the surface area of the Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalysts are lower in low loadings of Cu compared to MgO. This indicates that addition of Cu to MgO reduced the surface areas of the support MgO probably due to the coverage of the MgO surface by Cu initially. The BET surface area started increasing with increase in Cu loading and reaches a maximum of 46m2 g−1 at a Cu loading of 16wt.% and thereafter reduced with further increase in the Cu content probably due to the formation of larger crystallites of CuO. The growth in the intensity of CuO diffraction lines is observed with the increase in Cu loading from 5.2 to 79.8wt.%. The calcined catalysts with lower loadings of Cu from 5.2 to 13.5wt.% showed only a poorly crystalline MgO phase and very poorly marked d lines of CuO. The reduced catalysts have shown the presence of CuO phase in lower Cu loadings. In the catalysts CM3, CM4, CM7 and CM8, crystalline phases due to Cu0, Cu+, and Cu++ oxides are present. However, at higher loadings i.e., in CM7 and CM8, the intensity of d lines of Cu0 phase reduces at the expense of CuO and Cu2O phases. This may be due to an incomplete reduction of the bulk CuO or due to re-oxidation of the Cu0 species to Cu+ and Cu2+ formed at higher loadings of Cu. In CM5 and CM6, only Cu0 species are present. The used catalysts (after the reaction) indicated an increase in the intensity of CuO phase with increase in Cu loading (Cu loading≥37.3wt.%) and the presence of Cu0 phase is much clear in all the used samples, collected after the reduction. In the samples of higher Cu loadings where bulky nature of CuO species are present, both Cu metallic and Cu++ species are visible. In the lower Cu loading containing used catalysts, the interaction between Cu and MgO and the smaller crystallite size of Cu maintains Cu0 species. The X-ray line broadening analysis clearly showed an increase in the crystallite size of Cu with the increase in the loading of Cu as depicted in Fig. 1 . The increase in the crystallite size of Cu may be attributed to the agglomerization of Cu particles with increase in Cu content. However, the N2O titration results from our previous studies over the Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalysts have shown an increase in dispersion of Cu with loading upto 16 wt.%. (CM4) and thereafter a fall in the dispersion of Cu loading to the formation bigger particles of Cu [16]."
4,XPS discussion,"3.2 XPS discussion The catalysts have been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to obtain more information about the Cu oxidation state and the chemical compositions in the samples. XPS analysis of Cu–MgO catalysts prepared by different methods has been reported in our earlier work where it has been shown that a large amount of Cu0 species are present at the surface in the coprecipitated catalysts as compared to the catalysts prepared by impregnation and solid- solid wetting methods [15]. Cu2p XPS spectra of various Cu–MgO coprecipitated and reduced catalysts with varying Cu contents are shown in Fig. 2 . All the catalysts show the presence of Cu2p3/2 peak in the range of 933–934eV. Although the XRD patterns clearly indicate the presence of Cu0 formation in the catalysts with low Cu contents, the XPS data, however, shows the presence of CuO in all the samples. But from XRD results it is clear that Cu0 species are present in higher concentrations than that of CuO. A clear separation of peaks corresponding to Cu0 and CuO is not observed in the XPS spectra. However, Carley et al. have ascribed a peak at 933.4eV to Cu0 for the Cu/Al2O3 catalysts and corresponding to smaller particles of Cu0 with a surface coverage of 6×103 atomcm−2 [17]. The Cu–MgO catalysts of high Cu concentrations which revealed the presence of Cu2O and CuO in the XRD analysis also have shown the presence of CuO and Cu0 in the XPS patterns. The binding energy values Cu2p3/2, Mg2p, O1s and C1s along with the Cu/Mg atomic ratios, Cus/Cup (intensity ratios of the Cu2p satellite peak and Cu2p parent peak) are presented in Table 2 . C1s (285.0eV) is taken as the reference in calibrating the binding energies of the all the other elements viz., Cu, Mg and O. The presence of another minor band of C1s at 289eV in some of the samples indicates carbon contamination due to CO3 2− species with the exposure of the samples to air. The presence of higher amount CuO species on the surface in these reduced samples may be due to the re-oxidation of Cu0 on exposure to air. The Cu/Mg ratios suggest the increase in the surface concentration of Cu species with increase in Cu content upto 16wt.% loading. There after, a decrease of Cu/Mg ratio with Cu loading of 37.3wt.% and again an increasing trend with loading upto 79.8wt.% of Cu is seen. This sudden decrease in the Cu/Mg ratio may be due to the dissolution of some Cu species in to bulk with increase in Cu content but a further increase again resulted in surface enrichment of copper species since there is a corresponding decrease of MgO content with increase in Cu loading. The trend observed with XPS analysis is however, different from what is observed in our earlier work [15]. The surface enrichment or high Cu/Mg ratios in the samples with the higher loadings of Cu may be mainly due to the presence of CuO species. The increase of Cus/Cup i.e., the intensity ratio of the satellite peak to the parent peak of Cu 2p3/2 with increasing Cu content also confirms the presence of more number of CuO species on the catalysts with higher loadings of Cu. The Cu–MgO catalyst with 79.8wt.% of Cu has a Cus/Cup value of 0.7660 which is closer to the value observed with the bulk CuO sample (Table 2). The increase of Cu2+ or CuO species have been clearly indicated by the increase of intensity of satellite peak of Cu2p at 942.4–943.6eV in the XPS spectra of the Cu–MgO catalysts. These satellites have been attributed to the shake up transitions by ligand→metal 3d charge transfer which is very characteristic of Cu2+ compounds and is not seen in Cu+ compounds or in metallic Cu because of completely filled 3d shells [18]. In fact, transition metal ions are well reported [19,20] to have unfilled 3d orbital that show well separated satellite peaks in the core level XP spectra due to electron shape-up and the structure of satellite i.e., the peak number, intensity and splitting, reflects the nature of chemical bondings of the transition metal ions. The Cu/Mg ratio is although high with CM4 (16wt.% Cu), the lower Cus/Cup in this sample and also CM5 and CM6 samples suggest that the surface enrichment of species viz., Cu0 or Cu2O apart from Cu2 species. Our earlier observations in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalyst indicated that the presence of more Cu0 species in this catalyst to be responsible for its higher activity and selectivity towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol [15]. O1s spectra show the binding energy values in the range of 530.8–532.2eV for the Cu–MgO catalysts that is characteristic of metal oxides and is closer to O1s binding energy in MgO. The Mg2p binding values are almost the same in all the catalysts, which shows that there is no variation of surface concentration of MgO with increase in Cu content in the catalysts."
5,DTA-TG results,"3.3 DTA-TG results The thermal behaviour of the various Cu–MgO dried samples are studied by DTA analysis in the temperature range of 298–1273K. Thermal changes accompanied by the corresponding weight recorded are depicted in Fig. 3 . The low temperature endotherms in the region 343–473K showing a weight loss of 2–10% corresponding to weight loss associated with the removal of weakly adsorbed water molecules (physisorbed water) associated with Cu and Mg cations. The lower percentage weight loss with higher Cu content of the samples indicate that the association of such weakly bound water is higher with Mg cations or the affinity of Mg cations towards the water molecules is higher compared to Cu cations. The next major transitions are observed in the region of 493–633K correspondingly showing a percentage weight loss of 10–48% with samples of higher Cu concentrations losing more weight in this region and in fact, the sample CM8 showed no further significant loss in weight above 623K upto 1273K. These transitions or endotherms can be attributed to the dehydration/dehydroxylation or decarboxylation process corresponding to the loss of hydroxyl groups or CO3 2− of Cu and Mg. The two main endotherms of this process seen in the range of 493–533K and ∼633K can be ascribed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of Cu and Mg, respectively attributed to the decomposition of carbonates of their corresponding oxides. The individual DTA patterns of dried samples of simple CuO and MgO (prepared under similar conditions as the Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalysts) showed endotherms at 493–533K and ∼633K, respectively (the patterns of which are not presented here). These transitions occur in two stages in certain samples viz., CM1, CM2 and CM4 with shoulders appearing on the high temperature side. The endotherm observed at temperatures above 673K with a shoulder around 723–753K can be associated to the dehydroxylation and decarboxylation processes taking place with the probable presence of Cu and Mg hydroxyl carbonates, owing to K2CO3 used in the preparation of Cu–MgO samples as a precipitating agent. The transitions that occur in the range of 673–773K have been attributed by various authors to the removal of CO2 associated with Cu containing samples [21–23]. The presence of IR bands in the region of 1350–1380, 850–690, 670–690cm−1 arising from carbonate anions (not shown in the figure) further confirms these transitions observed in the DTA patterns. The minor transition (endotherm) observed at a high temp of 1073–1123K in the CM2 and CM4 samples can be attributed to the partial transformation of CuO to Cu2O, which is even in the presence of oxygen atmosphere [21–25]. In all other samples except for CM8 also there is a slight weight loss observed above 1073K, although no endotherm at such position is noticed which suggests that the CuO→Cu2O transition might have taken place but not to a significant extent. The typical pattern of CM8 showing only a single sharp endothermic peak ∼548K suggests that the dehydroxylation process owing to the loss of hydroxyls on Cu is more significant and since the contribution from the hydroxyls on Mg is very less there may be an overlap of the two taking place giving a single peak."
6,Activity measurement,"3.4 Activity measurement A successful demonstration of non-chromium containing Cu–MgO as a highly efficient catalyst in the vapor phase hydrogenation of FAL to FOL has been reported earlier by us [15]. The advantage of a Cu–MgO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method over the other methods is clearly shown. The coprecipitated catalyst yielded FOL more selectively on account of higher number of Cu0 metal species which are in interaction with the oxygen vacancies of MgO and with suitable Cu0 metal particle size. The emphasis is on the development of a non-chromium containing and more efficient catalyst for the synthesis of FOL. The present report is a further study to see the effect of Cu loading and reaction temperature on the furfural hydrogenation activity over Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalyst. Scheme 1 shows an overall view of the reaction pathways and possible formation of various products in the hydrogenation of FAL to FOL. The other products viz., 2-methyl furan (MF), furan (F), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) are formed as minor products or in trace amounts. The selectivity to FOL is reported to be governed mainly by (a) metal-support interactions, (b) electronic and steric influence of the support, (c) morphology of the metal particles, (d) selective poisoning, (e) influence and nature of second metal, (f) effect of pressure and (g) steric effects of substituents at the conjugated double bond [26]. Fig. 4 depicts the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic activity of CM4 (Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalyst with 16wt.%. of Cu) at a H2: furfural molar ratio=2.5 and furfural feed rate of 1.2mlh−1. There is no significant variation observed in the percentage conversion of FAL with rise in temperature above 453K. But, a fall in the selectivity to the desired product FOL can be seen with increase in temperature from 453K on account of formation of other products viz., MF, THFOL, THF, etc. Some authors report similar observations, over other Cu-based catalysts i.e., Pt-based and Ni-based catalysts [5,27–29]. However, further hydrogenation is also found to take place along with FOL formation [29,30]. The advantage of copper-based catalysts, thus, seems to be to achieve selective hydrogenation of the CO bond while keeping the CC bond in the furan ring intact. The formation of other products responsible for the fall in the selectivity to FOL at higher temperatures can be attributed to the activation of CC bond in the furan nucleus at these temperatures giving rise to the further hydrogenation products. At lower temperatures it seems that only CO bond is activated selectively to yield FOL. Thermodynamically CC bond hydrogenation is more favored over CO bond hydrogenation [31]. Selective activation of CO group has been successfully carried out catalytically over various Cu-based and other Pt, Ni-catalysts [26]. In absence of any steric constraints induced by substituents, hydrogenation of CC group is preferred over the hydrogenation of CO group in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [26]. The competitive adsorption of the olefinic and the carbonylic group plays an essential role in determining the selectivities of the products, whether it is to an unsaturated alcohol or a saturated aldehyde. The difference in reactivity has been related to the adsorption modes of the olefinic bond on the one side and of the aldehydic (ketonic) bond on the other side [32]. The steric hinderances of the olefinic group seem to enhance the adsorption through the carbonyl group. Ponec et al. reported that the choice of metal influences the activity and selectivity which could be manipulated by the use of a promoter an alkali metal ion, transition metal compounds or a non-transition element viz., Sn, Ge and Ga [33]. They further state that the relative accessibility and the binding strength of CC and CO groups, with the addition of hydrogen to CC bonds of the furan ring is sterically hindered, and thus selective activation of the carbonyl group can be achieved to yield furfuryl alcohol [34]. The effect of Cu loading on furfural hydrogenation activity of Cu–MgO catalyst has been shown in Fig. 5 . All the catalysts of Cu–MgO have shown much higher activity compared to bulk CuO catalysts. It can be observed from the graph that the conversion of FAL and selectivity to FOL (correspondingly yield of FOL) enhanced with increase in Cu content upto ∼16wt.% (CM4). A drop in conversion of FAL is observed over CM5 and CM6 and there is not much variation of selectivity to FOL seen over these catalysts. A further increase in Cu content resulted in the loss of selectivity to FOL as well as conversion levels of FAL, with the catalysts behaviour being similar to that of bulk CuO at these higher loadings of copper. The XPS results support these observations. The increase in CuO species over the surface is evidenced with an increase in the intensity ratios of Cus/Cup from XPS and rise in the intensity of CuO ‘d’ lines from XRD is seen with higher Cu contents in the catalyst. Thus, it can be opined that more the Cu0 species or lesser the CuO species, higher is the activity shown by the catalysts towards selective formation of FOL from the hydrogenation of FAL. A controversy still exists over the type of copper species which act as active sites for the type of hydrogenation reactions. Some authors suggest only Cu+ species and some others opine both Cu+ and Cu0 are the active sites for the hydrogenation reactions over Cu-based catalysts [5,10,35,36]. A clear illustration of a Langmuir–Hinshelwood model invoking either one type of site with competitive adsorption between furfural and hydrogen or two types of sites i.e., one for each reactant has been shown by Rao et al. in the hydrogenation of furfural over copper chromite catalyst [10]. They further suggested a simple bimolecular surface reaction as a rate-determining step by correlating Cu+ sites with activity and proposed that presence of both Cu+ and Cu0 species to be required for optimum performance. The activity results and the characteristics observed from XRD and XPS analyze in the present study also clearly indicate the necessity of both the species of Cu+ and Cu0 for the hydrogenation of FAL to FOL. Since, the Cu–MgO catalysts that contain these two species have shown superior activity and the ones with higher Cu content having more Cu2+species are found to be less active for this reaction. The turnover frequency (TOF) of furfural conversion against Cu loading is shown in Fig. 6 . The turnover frequency is defined as number of furfural molecules converted per second per surface Cu site. The number of surface Cu-sites is obtained from N2O pulse chemisorption technique assuming a stoichiometry of 1:2 between N2O and Cu. The experimental details are shown in our previous publication [16]. From Fig. 6, it is clear that the turnover frequency (TOF) is higher in the catalysts containing lower Cu composition. However, lack of required number smaller Cu particles and the absence of Cu+ species make these catalysts inferior in furfural hydrogenation. The XPS data of Cus/Cup ratios (Table 2) suggest that although the catalysts CM4 (16wt.%) and CM7 (52wt.%) vary to a great extent interms of Cu contents, they seem to show same Cus/Cup ratios (Table 2), which suggest a surface enrichment of copper (Cu0/Cu+) species in CM4 and CM7. However, probable agglomerization of copper particles as CuO in CM7 responsible for its low activity compared to that of CM4."
7,Conclusions,The hydrogenation studies of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over Cu–MgO coprecipitated catalyst indicated that the presence of more number Cu0/Cu+ species on the catalyst surface which are therefore is responsible for the high activity and the selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol. The activity results and the XPS characteristics observed clearly indicate the necessity of both the Cu+ and Cu0 species for the hydrogenation of FAL to FOL. This is indicated from the higher Cu/Mg atomic ratio and a lower Cus/Cup ratio observed with CM4 (16wt.% Cu) from XPS analysis showing the highest activity and selectivity towards the desired product at 453K.
