0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production is a highly efficient, secure, and clean renewable energy source that could replace traditional fossil fuels in the future, because of its impressive energy density, zero carbon emissions, and environmental friendliness [1,2]. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most promising approaches for hydrogen generation from water splitting [3–5]. The various two dimensional materials and nanostructures including MXene and its hybrid composites, black phosphorus, metal nitrides and carbides, metal composites, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene based derivatives were extensively studied due to their excellent physical and chemical properties such as abundant surface groups, strong electrical conductivity, larger interlayer spacing between the layer, easily tunable structure and sp3 hybridization behavior for the electro- and photo-catalytic applications [6–13]. Amongst, TMDs are being paid a lot of attention as a promising systems for HER due to their high abundance, low cost, high conductivity, superior electronic arrangements, and excellent catalytic peculiarities [3,14,15]. Most of them produced the inferior HER properties in an acidic or alkaline medium. Therefore, to unearth new systems as electrocatalysts with high HER abilities are energetically being pursued [16]. Platinum (Pt) electrodes are being used as successful commercial HER electrocatalysts thus far with superior electrocatalytic behavior. However, their scarcity and high costs have constrained their uses in industrials. Hence, the derivatives of Pt can undoubtedly have a high Pt like catalytic behavior, and their properties can be tuned with the bond of desirable atoms. Pt based dichalcogenides, which include PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, are emerging materials, and they can be easily thinned to the ultimate dimension of a single layer even the exfoliated ones. From the literatures and the theoretical perceptions, PtS2 is a semiconductor with an energy gap of about 1.2 eV [17]. PtTe2 is supposed to be a metal, and PtSe2 is considered to be a semi-metal with a zero bandgap [18]. However, the recent experimental studies demonstrated that monolayer PtSe2 has bandgap of 1.2 eV with higher carrier mobility, which suggests the possibility to operate as a semiconductor and a semimetal [19]. Wang et al. [20] have successfully adopted a single step epitaxial methodology with a direct selenization on Pt (111) substrate to obtain a monolayer PtSe2. Zeng et al. [21] also employed the above methodology to grow large-scale, uniform, and vertical PtSe2 films. Because of a unique crystal structure, the excellent surface characteristics, and the abundance of active sites on the exposed surfaces, Pt based dichalcogenides have been received considerable attention as a superior electrocatalysts which can possible to catalyze the couple of electrons and protons as H2 at the maximum rate of reaction with low overpotentials [22]. Despite significant successes, immense research has been conducting to design the efficient HER catalysts [13,18,23,24]. The immense efforts have been done by our group to produce the transition metal dichalcogenides based electrocatalysts using the various physical and chemical methodologies [25–27]. Recently, Pt based dichalcogenides were fabricated with different chalcogen (S, Se, and Te) atoms to promote electrocatalytic activities [15,28]. Chia et al. [15] have reported PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 as hydrogen-evolving electrodes with the featured overpotentials of 86, 63, and 54 mV at a 10 mAcm−2 current density and the Tafel slopes of 216, 132, and 110 mV/dec, respectively, which harmoniously focus the Pt derivatives as an alternative to pure Pt. Rosli et al. [29] also proposed Pt derivatives, which included PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, as the electrocatalyst materials for an oxygen reduction reaction. Recently, a 1 T-PtSe2 thin film was synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Au foil as a HER electrocatalyst which produced the overpotentials ~210–261 mV to drive a 10 mAcm−2 current density and Tafel slopes of ~33–38 mV/dec [30]. Based on the detailed literatures, we have the prominent interest to substitute the chalcogen atom with Pt to derive the novel characteristic structure in order to perceive the superior electrocatalytic properties. Hence, the two step preparation process of sputtering and CVD annealing were used to construct the PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2 thin films on the Ti/Si substrate. The prepared PtTe2 electrocatalysts show highly effective and stable activity in an acidic and alkaline electrolyte for HER, showing low overpotentials (75 & 92 mV @10 mA cm−2) and the small Tafel slopes (64 & 59 mV/dec). The catalytic activity of PtTe2 is superior to other electrocatalysts including PtS2 and PtSe2. The density functional theory (DFT) approximations were also used to measure the valuable theoretical insights and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption for hydrogen (ΔGH∗) of Pt derivatives demonstrating their excellent HER properties. The observed experimental results are highly concurred with the theoretical predictions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of Pt-dichalcogenides,"2.1 Synthesis of Pt-dichalcogenides The Si substrates were first ultrasonically cleaned by using methanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol solutions. The ultrasonically cleansed substrates were dressed using de-ionized water and then dehydrated and baked for 5 min. The size of the substrates was 1 × 1 cm−1. Before the film preparation, the sputter chamber was evacuated by using the combined diffusion pump and rotary pump to attain a vacuum of 1 × 10−6 Pa. Initially, a seed layer of Ti (3~5 nm) film was coated using RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. For Ti layer deposition, working pressure (~3 × 10−2 torr), Ar gas flow (10 sccm), power (25 W), and sputtering time (200 s) were fixed constantly. The active layer of PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 were grown using two-step processes. In the first step, thin Pt (10 nm) film was developed using RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. For Pt film sputtering, the constant sputtering time (400 s), working pressure (~3 × 10−2 torr), power (50 W) and Ar gas flow (10 sccm) were used. In the second step, the Pt/Ti/Si film was placed to oven to anneal at 650 °C in the presence of S or Se or Te powder using Ar/H2 (50/10 sccm) environment for 1 h to form PtS2, PtSe2 or PtTe2, respectively. To make the S, Se or Te environment, the constant weight of chalcogenide (0.4 g for S/Se/Te powder) and the distance between the boat and substrate (~50 mm) were used. The detailed characterization and computational parts are provided in the supporting information."
3,Electrochemical measurements,"2.2 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Biologic SP-300 workstation with a standard three-electrode system. The commercial Pt/C and synthesized PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 were employed as the working electrodes without additional treatment with a graphite rod as a counter electrode. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for acidic media and an Hg/HgO electrode for alkaline media were employed as a reference electrode in a three-electrode system. The linear sweep polarization measurement (scan rate of 10 mV/s) was conducted in a nitrogen purged 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. All data were corrected from the iR losses and the background current during the measurement. The HER potential values for reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were transformed by the formula: E (vs RHE) = E (vs SCE) + E0 (SCE) + 0.0592 × pH for H2SO4 medium and E (vs RHE) = E (vs Hg/HgO) + E0 (Hg/HgO) + 0.0592 × pH for KOH medium. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were cycled in the non-Faradic region under various scan rates from 10 to 100 mVs−1 in the acidic medium. The EIS tests were engaged at frequencies ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz."
4,Results and discussion,"PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 electrodes were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering-CVD methods (Fig. 1 ). The complete experimental details are provided in the materials and the methods section. Briefly, the sputtered Pt-substrates were annealed in the presence of S, Se, and Te to form PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, respectively. To discover the structural property of the prepared PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 films, the Raman analyses were examined (Fig. 2 a). For the PtS2 film, a couple of characteristic peaks are exhibited at ~306.5 and ~ 336.1 cm−1 due to the in-plane mode E1 g and the out-of-plane mode A1 g, respectively [31,32]. In the case of PtSe2, two prominent vibrational modes appeared at ~175.8 and ~205.7 cm−1, which are allocated to the in-plane E1 g and the out-of-plane A1 g, respectively, which is consistent with the previous report [33]. From PtTe2, the representative peaks are at ~109.6 and ~157.4 cm−1 correspond to the E1 g and A1 g longitudinal acoustic phonon modes due to the existence of 1 T-PtTe2 [34,35]. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were used to confirm the crystal structure of PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 as shown in Fig. 2b. PtS2 is exposed the (001) (100) (011) (012) (110), and (111) lattice planes (JCPDS No. 88–2267), while the strong peak related to the Si (100) plane are exhibited. For PtSe2, the (001) (100) (011) (102) (110), and (201) planes are observed (JCPDS No. 89–2643) along with the Si peak. In the case of PtTe2 (001) (011) (002) (102) (110) (111) (003) (201) (103), and (022) lattice planes are observed (JCPDS No. 88–2277). Hence, the observed structural characterizations strongly proved the formation of PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 evidently. To prove the electronic structure of the synthetic PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 film, an X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed (Fig. 3 ). The survey spectrum for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 films are provided in Fig. S1, which clearly picturized the observed elements. For PtS2, the strong Pt 4f doublets are centered at 76.4 eV and 73.1 eV attributed to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2, respectively (Fig. 3a) [36]. Also, S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 are centered at 164.0 eV and 162.7 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b) [28]. The PtSe2 film (Fig. 3c-d) is produced the Pt 4f doublets at 76.6 eV (Pt 4f5/2) and 73.3 eV (Pt 4f7/2), whereas Se 3 d doublets are at 55.7 (Se 3d3/2) and 54.7 eV (Se 3d5/2), which is consistent with the reported values for PtSe2 [21,37]. For the PtTe2 film (Fig. 3e-f), the characteristic Pt 4f doublets are exhibited at 76.9 eV (Pt 4f5/2) and 73.6 eV (Pt 4f7/2). And Te 3 d signals are at 584.1 and 573.6 eV correspond to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 binding energies, respectively, along with the Te4+ peaks (587.1 and 576.9 eV) [28,38]. Surface properties are crucial to determine the catalytic properties of PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2. Hence, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out. Fig. 4 shows the FESEM and the TEM images of PtS2 with different magnifications. The nano-cluster like morphological nature is exhibited for PtS2, which clearly depicted in Fig. 4a-b. The high resolution FESEM image (Fig. 4c) reveals the formation of grain bunches by agglomeration. The nano-strip like structured fringes are exposed by the TEM images, which are given in Fig. 4d-f. The high resolution images (Fig. 4g-h) are clearly picturized, and their zoomed portion of the selected region are inserted (inset Fig. 4g-h). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern, which was derived from Fig. 4h and their inverse FFT (iFFT) pattern are given in Fig. 4i-j, respectively. The phase profile spectrum for the iFFT pattern is exhibited with 0.51 nm corresponding to the (001) lattice orientation of PtS2 which is correlated with XRD result. The acquired FESEM and TEM images for the PtSe2 with different magnifications are provided in Fig. 5 . The highly interconnected cauliflower structured grains are exhibited for the PtSe2 as shown in Fig. 5a-b. The strained spherical shaped grain bunches by agglomeration of smaller grains are grouped on the PtSe2 surface. Figure 5c displays the cauliflower natured grain bunches effectively due to the formation of more active selenium facet sites for the PtSe2. The different shape of the grains bunches is clearly marked by the TEM images with the inset of corresponding high magnification images (Fig. 5d-f). The high resolution images are clearly visualized by the shape of the nano-stripe structured grains with a FFT pattern (Fig. 5g). The different directions of nano-stripe structured fringes are captured by the high resolution image, and their (011) and (100) lattice orientations are indexed by the blue and yellow line, respectively. FFT pattern (Fig. 5i) is mapped for the selected spot of lattice directions. The iFFTs and phase profile spectra of (011) and (100) lattice orientations of PtSe2 are given in Fig. 5j-m, which demonstrated the existence of nano-stripe structures with the interconnection of different lattices for PtSe2. Fig. 6 shows the FESEM and the TEM images for the metallic natured PtTe2. The lower magnification image clearly predicts the dense nature morphology (Fig. 6a). The high resolution images proved the group of grain clusters with plenty of active sites in a multi-directed grain formation. The uniform surface nature with a homogeneous texture of grains with confined directions are validated in Fig. 6c. Fig. 6d shows the TEM image with the vertically aligned nano-strip structure for the PtTe2 with an FFT pattern. The vertically aligned nano-strip structures are clearly discovered by the high resolution TEM (Fig. 6e-f). The width of the strip bands and their directions varied due to their different lattice directions. Inset Fig. 6f shows the FFT pattern for the red color selected portion in Fig. 6f. The highly patterned nano-stripes with lattice intersections are revealed in the high resolution TEM image of Fig. 6g-h with the inset FFT patterns. The different directions of nano-stripes for the selected part zoomed images are provided within the circle for the arrowed region of Fig. 6g-h. The extracted phase profile spectrum with spacing of 0.29 nm reveals the (011) lattice orientation of PtTe2 (Fig. 6i). Furthermore, to prove the existence of the Pt-dichalcogenides, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum measurements were used for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 (Figs. S2a–c). The observed elemental ratios are 68:32 (S:Pt), 65:35 (Se:Pt) and 71:29 (Te:Pt) for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, respectively. Also, the elemental mapping images by SEM and TEM analyses for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 to validate the existence of the suggested elements are provided in Figs. S3 and S4, respectively. The electrocatalytic measurements towards HER using Pt-dichalcogenides as the electrocatalysts were assessed through the conventional three electrode set-up in an N2 purged 0.5 M H2SO4 medium with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Fig. 7 a andb shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the commercial Pt/C and the Pt-chalcogenide PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 electrocatalysts. The commercial Pt/C catalyst shows high HER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 43 mV @10 mA cm−2 in H2SO4 medium. Remarkably, the PtTe2 electrode exhibited superior HER activity in H2SO4 medium with the lowest overpotential of 75 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. On the other hand, the PtS2 and the PtSe2 showed slightly inferior HER activity compared with the PtTe2 (92 mV and 81 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively, in H2SO4 medium). The observed overpotentials for the different electrocatalysts are listed in Table 1 . The observed low overpotential of PtTe2 is credited to the metallic nature of the system. The exhibited PtTe2 based electrode HER result is also much more superior than those of the various LTMDs based catalysts, such as Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 MNSN/NF (η10mAcm −2 = 85 m V) [4], MoS2/CoSe2 hybrid (η1~10mAcm −2 = 11–68 mV) [39], MoSSe@rGO nanocomposites (η5mAcm −2 = 135 m V) [40], WSe2/MoS2 (η10mAcm −2 = 116 mV) [23], edge-oriented WS2(1-x)Se2x on 3D porous NiSe2 foam [41], WS2(1-x)Se2x nanoribbons (η10mAcm −2 = 170 m V) [42], MoS2(1-x)Se2x/NiSe2 hybrid (η10mAcm −2 = 69 m V) [43], WS1-xSex (η10mAcm −2 = 93 mV) [44], WS2/CoSe2 (η10mAcm −2 = 95 mV) [45], NiP1.93Se0.07 and NiP0.09Se1.91 heterostructures (η10mAcm −2 = 84–135 m V) [46], MoS2 heterogeneous-phase nanosheets (η10mAcm −2 = 220 m V) [47], 2H- and 1 T′-MoTe2 single crystals (η10mAcm −2 = 650 & 356 m V) [48], porous NiTe2 nanostructures (η10mAcm −2 = −422 mV) [49], and porous hollow NiS2 microspheres (η10mAcm −2 = 174 m V) [50]. The extracted overpotential value of the PtTe2 is elaborately compared to various LTMDs based HER catalysts in Table S1. The Tafel plots provide more valuable insights of the electrocatalysts. Fig. 7c shows the Tafel plots for the Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2 electrodes, which were extracted from their relevant polarization curves in H2SO4 medium. The Tafel slopes were extracted from the fitted lines for each of the electrodes. PtTe2 electrode owns a lesser Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec than that of the PtSe2 (71 mV/dec) and the PtS2 (69 mV/dec). Also, the commercial Pt/C electrode exhibits the 42 mV/dec of Tafel slope in H2SO4 medium. By extrapolating the Tafel plot to the X-axis, the additional inherent HER activity, the exchange current density (j0) of the catalyst was extracted for H2SO4 medium. The assessed j0 values are 1.31, 0.65, 0.73, and 0.77 mA cm−2 for the Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2, respectively. The observed Tafel slope and j0 values are provided in Table 1. Three primary steps in the hydrogen evolution process using acidic electrolyte follows, [44,51,52]. (1) Volmer step (discharge reaction): H3O+ + e– → Hads + H2O (120 mV/dec), (2) Heyrovsky process (ion and atom reactions): Hads + H3O+ + e– → H2 + H2O (40 mV/dec), and (3) Tafel process (combination reaction): Hads + Hads → H2 (30 mV/dec) Thus, our purposed electrocatalysts (PtS2, PtSe2 and PtTe2) can be obeyed by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for H2SO4 medium, whereas discharge reaction is a rate-limiting process [15,53]. The extracted Tafel slope and j0 values of PtTe2 are compared with different LTMDs based HER catalysts in Table S1. To further evaluate the electron-transfer kinetics and the inherent catalytic activity of HER reaction in H2SO4 medium, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed (Fig. 7d). The interactions between the catalyst and the electrolyte interface was determined thru the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of electrocatalyst and its low value produces the fast electron transfer. A PtTe2 catalyst exhibits a substantially lower Rct of ~10.23 Ω than the PtS2 and the PtSe2 catalysts (~11.02 & 15.3 Ω). The high HER activity observed in the 1 T-PtTe2 phase is credited to the high conductivity of the metallic nature, which supports the rapid electron transfer within the electrode/electrolyte interface. The small series resistance of ~1.3–2 Ω (Fig. 7d) revealed the strong adherence of Pt-chalcogenides with the high conductive Ti substrate and solid electron coupling effect to minimize the ohmic losses, which explored the significant role of synthetic processes. The extraction of electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is a valid tool to assess the electrocatalyst behavior. CVs performance with various scan rates were employed in a non-Faradaic region to perceive the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl). Fig. S5 shows the CV curves of the PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2 electrocatalysts for H2SO4 medium. The plotted current differences at 0.125 V vs RHE (Δj = janodic-jcathodic) against the different scan rates were linearly fitted to evaluate the slope value, which was used as Cdl [45,52]. The Cdl values were 2.59 mF/cm2, 2.73 mF/cm2, and 2.81 mF/cm2 for the PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2, respectively in acidic medium. The appraised ECSA values were 74 cm2, 78 cm2, and 80 cm2 for the PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2, respectively. This result revealed that PtSe2 and PtTe2 are having the maximum effective active area for high HER reaction kinetics rather than a PtS2 catalyst, which might be originated from the plenty of active sites and the metallic nature of materials. From the observed results, the exhibited excellent morphological properties with the high-density active edge sites for Pt-chalcogenides were highly influenced to achieve the improved electrocatalytic properties. The EIS results were also evidently derived the rapid electron transfer and the reaction kinetics of HER for Pt-chalcogenides. Apart from the high activity of electrocatalysts, the stability is an important criterion to use in the practical applications of HER. The PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 catalysts were used to perform the chronoamperometric (i-t) measurements for a 20 h continuous HER operation with 92, 81, and 75 mV overpotential of PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, respectively, in an acidic solution. Fig. 8 a-b shows the i-t curve for the PtS2 and PtSe2 catalysts. The observed profiles revealed the substantial degradation for the 20 h continuous HER operation which might be due to the adsorption of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface to diminish the active sites for the long time performance. The robust behavior is clearly visualized for PtTe2 catalyst in Fig. 8c, which is credited to the metallic nature of 1 T- PtTe2. The observed LSV profiles after 20 h HER operation are inserted with the corresponding i-t profile in Fig. 8. Also, the observed LSV profile of PtTe2 after 20 h HER operation produces the identical curve with an initial one which further proves the reusable properties. Furthermore, the SEM results were perceived after a 20 h HER operation for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 to prove the stable nature of electrocatalysts as shown in Fig. S6. Slightly changed morphologies are observed for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 compared to before the HER operation due to the 20 h’ continuous performance in an acidic electrolyte. However, the shape of the grains is somewhat maintained for the PtTe2 due to its robust nature in the acidic electrolyte. Besides, the XPS spectra for the PtTe2 after the 20 h HER operation revealed no noticeable chemical state changes in the electrode surface due to the robust behavior (Fig. S7). Furthermore, to explore the characteristics of Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 electrocatalysts in the alkaline medium (1 M KOH), LSV profiles were recorded at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. Fig. 9 a-b shows the LSV profiles of different electrocatalysts in alkaline medium. The observed overpotentials are 42, 95, 94 and 92 mV vs RHE to drive 10 mA cm−2 for Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 electrocatalysts, respectively. From the outcomes, PtTe2 catalyst shows the better catalytic activity in the acidic medium than the alkaline medium. Fig. 9c shows the Tafel plots for the Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2 electrodes for alkaline medium. A commercial Pt/C exhibits the 48 mV/dec of Tafel slope value. The PtTe2 electrode shows a minimum Tafel slope of 59 mV/dec (PtSe2: 78 mV/dec, PtS2:90 mV/dec). Three primary HER kinetic steps in alkaline media is described as follows, [5,24]. (4) Discharge reaction: H2O+ + e– → Hads + OH–, (5) Ion and atom reaction: H2O + Hads + e– → H2 + OH–, and (6) combination reaction 2Hads → H2 However, the observed Tafel slopes of PtS2, PtSe2 and PtTe2 indicate that the HER obeys the Volmer−Heyrovsky kinetics in alkaline solution, thus identifying the electrochemical discharge reaction as the rate-limiting process [54,55]. The assessed j0 values are 1.17, 1.08, 1.22, and 0.81 mA cm−2 for Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2, respectively, in the alkaline medium. The exhibited low overpotential and small Tafel slope values for the PtTe2 specifies its rapid reaction kinetics and the superior electrocatalytic HER activity as compared with other Pt-based electrocatalysts due to its metallic nature [15,20,56]. EIS plots were recorded for Pt/C, PtS2, PtSe2, and the PtTe2 electrocatalysts in alkaline medium, as shown in Fig. 9d. The observation of small Rct characteristics proves the swift electron interactions between the catalyst and the electrolyte interface for H+ reduction in an alkaline medium. A 1 T-PtTe2 catalyst exhibits a substantially small Rct of ~2.6 Ω (PtS2 and PtSe2 catalysts, ~3.2 & 6.1 Ω). The low series resistance of ~2.6–2.8 Ω for the Pt-chalcogenides revealed a high conductive behavior of prepared electrocatalysts. The observed HER parameters for alkaline media are provided in Table 1. Furthermore, an overpotential of PtTe2 catalyst of 92 mV vs RHE was used to derive i-t profile in alkaline medium to prove the stability (Fig. S8). The persistent i-t profile shows for PtTe2 with no negligible decay in current density over the duration of 20 h due to the strong electrocatalytic behavior of electrode. The strong interaction between substrate and PtTe2 nanosheets facilitates the swift transfer of ion/electrons and enables the strong mechanical adhesion boosting the remarkable stability. The fabricated PtS2, PtSe2 and PtTe2 electrocatalysts produced the superior HER behavior in the acidic medium rather than the alkaline medium. Figs. S9a–f show the optimized chemical structure of the Pt-chalcogenides (PtX2 = PtTe2, PtSe2, and PtS2) bulk phase top and side view. The various optimized lattice parameters are presented in Table S2. The band structure for bulk PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2 are shown in Figs. S10a–c. It illustrated that PtS2 and PtSe2 exhibit a semiconductor character with a 1.42 and a 0.66 eV bandgap, respectively. The PtTe2 has a metallic character, so these findings are fairly consistent with the reported outcomes and confirmed the stability of our structures [57]. Then, it assumed the intercalation of H atom on the surface and the edge sites of PtX2 and derived their relative energy with respect to the most stable configuration. Table S2 shows the adsorption (Ead) and the relative (Erel) energy of a hydrogen atom adsorbed onto the surface and edge sites, and it confirmed that the adsorption of H atom is more favorable to the edge sites of PtX2. The X–H (X = S, Se, Te) bond lengths are 1.36 Å for PtS2, 1.49 Å for PtSe2, and 1.72 Å for PtTe2, and they are very close to the hydrides bond lengths (1.30, 1.45, and 1.72 Å for H2S, H2Se, and H2Te, respectively) [58]. Fig. 10 a displays the total electronic density of states (TDOS) for the hydrogen atom adsorbed PtX2 around the Fermi level, and it follows the following order: PtTe2 > PtSe2 > PtS2, which indicates that the TDOS is significantly enhanced at the Fermi level when the hydrogen atom adsorbed. Interestingly, the extracted TDOS pattern revealed that the electronic structure of the PtS2 and PtSe2 were transformed from the semiconductor to the metallic nature. The enhanced partial electronic density of states (PDOS) of PtTe2 was observed around the Fermi level due to the hybridization of dyz (Pt), dxz (Pt), py (Te), pz (Te), and px (Te) states (Fig. 10b-c). Therefore, the transfer of charge from the adsorbed H atom gives a significant part in the increased carrier concentration, the conductivity, and the electron mobility, which is accountable for the enriched HER activity. In order to realize this output, the change of electron density (e Å−3) is described beside the c axis as Δρ(z) = {ρ(z)[PtX2-mH] – ρ(z)[PtX2] - ρ(z)[mH]}. Here, ρ(z) signifies that the considered structure electron density is defined in the parentheses, and it is the median of the supercell XY plane. These values were estimated by the subtraction of pristine PtTe2 crystal and H electron density from the H atom adsorbed PtX2 complex in the same supercell configuration. Note that the total charge is zero for the complex, even though H can occur in the form of H+ ions after the complex creation. Fig. S11a shows Δq(z) and ΔQ(e) of the PtTe2-mH (4 × 4 unit cells) complex. Here, Δρ(z) = ΔVΔq(z), ΔV = Vcell/Nc, and Nc (= 216) and Vcell are the c-axis number of the fine grids and the volume of the supercell, respectively. Each PtTe2 layer thick is described by the z coordinates of Te atoms of lower (TeL) and upper sublayers (TeU), which is z (TeL) < z (TeU). In every structure, the thickness of the H+ ions adsorbed PtTe2 is estimated from the difference of the z coordinates minimum and maximum for all the atoms in the unit cell. Furthermore, the Δq(z) of the H atom substantially is decreased, which notified the alteration of H atom to the H+ ion and transported the charge to the adjacent Te atoms. For the quantitative analysis, the gathered excess charge Q(e) is described as Q ( e ) = ∑ 0 z ′ < z Δ ρ ( z ′ ) . Then, the charge transfer amount is clarified by the equation, ΔQ(e) = [Qmax(z) - Qmin(z)]. From Fig. S11a , Qmin(z) and Qmax(z) relate to minima and maxima, respectively, which is nearby PtTe2. Hence, the 0.09e− charge transferred from the adsorbed H to the Te atom. Similarly, Fig. S11b shows the profile images of Δρ(x, y, z) to expose the noteworthy electron transferal from the H atom to the PtTe2 layer. The charge depletion and accumulation are denoted by the green and the red colors, respectively. Transported electrons are gathered between the H and the adjacent Te. Fig. 10d-e shows the chemical structure of an H atom adsorbed on the surface and on the edge site of PtX2 for the HER catalytic activity. The DFT calculations derive the △GH∗ of H adsorption for PtX2 (S, Se and Te), which is shown in Fig. 10f. In general, it is necessary to be close to null for the conjucture value of △GH∗ for a worthy HER activity, which is an ultimate state to attach the H atom neither too faintly nor too sturdily. With thermodynamics, the H2 generation is too tricky for too positive adsorption energy of an H atom and to be declined for too negative adsorption energy of an H atom [52,59]. The observed results exposed that △GH∗ of PtTe2 is less compared to the PtSe2 and the PtS2, which is associated with the weakened interactions between the Pt and the Te atoms due to their metallic behavior and a more thermo-neutral behavior. The TDOS calculations also indicated a significantly enhanced TDOS at the Fermi level when the hydrogen atom adsorbed with PtTe2. From the derived estimations, it is concluded that HER activity occurs in the order of PtS2 < PtSe2 < PtTe2 in the Pt-chalcogenides. The high electrical conductivity and the abundant catalytic activity sites are also supported to perceive superior HER activity in PtTe2 [60]."
5,Conclusions,"In this report, we systematically investigated the characteristics of sputtering-CVD prepared PtS2, PtSe2 and PtTe2 layered materials and employed them as robust and highly active electrocatalysts for HER. The metallic PtTe2 catalyst revealed low overpotentials of 75 and 92 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and small Tafel slopes of 64 and 59 mV/dec in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively. Also, PtTe2 showed a robust nature over a 20 h continuous HER process in an acidic and alkaline medium. The DFT calculations derived the low ΔGH∗ for the PtTe2 electrode and proved their excellent electrocatalytic HER activity by TDOS and PDOS estimations. This study offers a promising use for Pt-chalcogenides catalysts to boost the HER activity for green energy applications."
