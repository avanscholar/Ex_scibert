0,Introduction,"The utilization of oil palm biomass waste is in-line with the new concept of green economy development for a sustainable economic system as potential alternative for timber as a construction material. However, it remains a challenge for researchers to explore and figure out the best production process. Oil palm trunks are usually cut down after the age of 25 years due to decreasing yield or because they have grown too tall which makes harvesting very difficult [1]. Generally, oil palm trunks can be converted into value-added products through mechanical processes [2] and due to economic aspects, these raw materials are usually made well available and low-cost. The initial advantages of using oil palm trunk waste in building materials are for its good thermal insulation and low cost [3]. Therefore, the utilization of biomass waste can lead to energy saving, conservation of non-renewable resources and protection of the environment [3]. Traditionally, formaldehyde-based using urea and phenol resins are the common binders for particleboards, but they suffered from formaldehyde (a suspected carcinogen) emissions that are detrimental to human health. As a consequence, they are banned or heavily regulated in many countries worldwide [4]. Poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVOH) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer that has good chemical and thermal stability with a broad range of applications [5] in polymer, pharmaceutical and food industries [6]. The PVOH is an excellent film-former, emulsifier, adhesive, biocompatible and non-toxic with high water permeability [7]. Flame retardants are chemical substances that are added and incorporated into the materials to inhibit or delay the spread of fire after ignition as well as stopping the combustion process [8]. Flame retardants can be divided into four main groups which are based on phosphorus, halogen, nitrogen and inorganic flame retardants [9]. Previous studies showed that reduction of the flammability of particleboards can be achieved by adding a flame-retardant additive at the expense of physical and mechanical properties of the former [10]. Sodium chloride (NaCl), also known as salt or halite, is an ionic compound with direct or indirect use in the production of many chemicals [11]. Jiang et al. [12] investigated the effect of ionic strength of salt on the rheological properties of a suspension of nanoparticles. They found that sodium chloride conveniently interacts and influences the surface change, which also affects significantly the dispersion of nanoparticles, viscosity, storage and loss modulus, and gelatinizing properties. They also stated that the presence of sodium chloride was found to enhance the resistance of suspension to heat stabilization and finally weakened the gelling behavior. Thus, particles treated with sodium chloride give an effective approach for improving the flame retardancy of particleboard. Sodium chloride (NaCl) can penetrate the cell walls and cure with cell wall constitutes and hence leading to improve the dimensional stability of cell walls [13]. Nasir et al. [14] conclude that particles treated with chemicals showed an interesting performance but also has several weaknesses such as instability of board quality and insufficient mechanical strength. Das and Sarmah [15] also stated that the salt pre-treated particles can be integrated with polymers that would impart the beneficial flame retardancy in the resulting bio-composite. Mahmood et al. [16] stated that the thermal stability of the particleboard improved after various pre-treatment that could be attributed to the removal of non-cellulosic impurities during regeneration of particles after pre-treatment. Ozdemir and Tutus [17] also reported that particle materials are pre-treated to decrease the flammability with fire retardant chemicals. To date, only a few studies have carried out using NaCl salt as pre-treatment agent [15]. In another study, non-flammable mineral fillers were used in composites, resulting in reduced heat release and weight [18]. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is a carbonated mineral with the most stable polymorph [17]. Calcium carbonate is most widely used due to its features such as extensive sources, low cost, and non-toxic. It could also enhance the flame retardation of the materials due to the release of carbon dioxide [18]. Nowadays, calcium carbonate is widely used as an additive or filler [19] in rubber, plastics, paints, and other industrial applications [20]. As the society developed, the demand for flame retardant building and decorative materials was also increased [21]. Therefore, this study was commenced with the objective to develop renewable flame-retardant particleboards with the usage of non-wood resources waste (oil palm trunk biomass) and non-formaldehyde-based binder (poly(vinyl) alcohol) that would release almost zero formaldehyde emission. In the end, it was hoped that the particleboards produced would be having not only good flame-retardancy but acceptable properties so that it potentially can be used as construction materials."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Oil palm trunk particles obtained from Encore Agriculture Industries Sdn. Bhd. were grounded into fine particles with sizes around 10 mm. Sodium chloride (ChemAr) and calcium carbonate (QRec) were used to impart flame retardancy, as the former is an ionic salt while the latter would thermally decompose to produce carbon dioxide. Both poly(vinyl) alcohol (binder) and citric acid (crosslinker) were obtained from R & M Chemicals. Citric acid acted as the cross-linker between poly(vinyl) alcohol chains themselves and between poly(vinyl) alcohol and oil palm trunk particles. During combustion, citric acid and all chemicals were used as received and of analytical grade."
3,Sample preparation and particleboard making,"2.2 Sample preparation and particleboard making The oil palm trunk particles were screened by using four-tier screener to remove the oversize, fines and impurities. Then, they were immersed in 30% of sodium chloride solution to allow penetration of sodium chloride into oil palm trunk particles and were left to stabilize at 60 ± 2 °C for 24 h. After the treatment, all the particles were dried until the moisture content of the particles were reached 5% [13]. The pretreatment of lignocellulosic particles with flame retardant additives was normally carried out in aqueous solution [22]. This approach allowed permanent addition of the flame-retardant agent onto the particles during the sample preparation. Later, the treated particles were mixed with 10% and 20% of PVOH and 10% and 20% of calcium carbonate, respectively. The ratio of additives was not exceeding 20% because of its negative effect to the mechanical properties [18]. Then, 10% of citric acid was added as an additive. A particleboard containing untreated 100% oil palm trunk particles was used as a control and 100% treated oil palm trunk binderless board was also made. The particleboards then were pressed with hot press at temperature 160 °C for 20 min [23]. The targeted board density was set to 700 kg/m2. Seven types of particleboards were manufactured as shown in Table 1 consist of untreated OPT binderless, treated OPT that consist binderless, OPT with 10% PVOH, OPT with 10% PVOH and 10% CA, OPT with 10% PVOH, 10% CA and 10% CaCO3, OPT with 10% PVOH, 10% CA and 20% CaCO3 and also OPT with 20% PVOH, 10% CA and 10% CaCO3. Three replicates of particleboards were prepared for each formulation."
4,Thickness swelling test and water absorption test,"2.3 Thickness swelling test and water absorption test The thickness swelling, and water absorption were the increment ratio of thickness and weight after water absorption to the thickness and weight before water absorption [24]. The tests were done by immersing the particleboards in water for 2 h and then the thickness swelling (TS) and water absorption (WA) were measured according to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS A 5908–2003) [25]."
5,Mechanical testing,"2.4 Mechanical testing 2.4.1 Bending test Bending test was carried out according to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS A 5908–2003) [23] using an Instron machine model 4204. Bending test was conducted with a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. The specimen size for bending test was 50 mm × 200 mm with effective span of 150 mm. 2.4.2 Internal bonding test (IB) Internal bonding test was done according to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS A 5908–2003) [23] using same Instron Machine model 4204 used for testing bending test. A sample test was adhered to the internal bonding blocks and then placed to the machine. Tension load was applied vertically to the board face, with the tension loading speed at 2 mm/min. The maximum load (P’) was measured at the time of failing force (breaking load of perpendicular tensile strength to the board)."
6,Limited oxygen index test (LOI),"2.5 Limited oxygen index test (LOI) This limited oxygen index test was carried out according to the ASTM D 2863 [26] standard with the Fire Testing Technology LOI instrument. The specimen size for LOI measurement was 80 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm. There were two main parts of analysis. The first part of analysis was determining the preliminary oxygen concentration, and the second part was determining oxygen index value. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) was the minimum concentration of oxygen which expressed as volume percent, in a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen that will support flaming combustion of a material at room temperature."
7,Thermogravimetric analysis test,"2.6 Thermogravimetric analysis test Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using thermogravimetric analyzer model Shimadzu TGA-50. The temperature of the sample was raised from ambient temperature up to 920 °C, with heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The data of thermogravimetric analysis was based on the temperature and percentage of weight against temperature. This data was analyzed using the Freeman-Caroll method [27]."
8,Morphological analysis,"2.7 Morphological analysis Morphological analysis of the particleboard was done by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Clean cut sample with a dimension of 1 cm in length and 1 cm in width was used. Initially, the samples were dried in the oven at 105° C and kept clean from any contaminants. The samples then were coated using sputter coating POLARON 515 with gold approximately 20 nm thick before viewed under Microscope LEO Supra 50Vp, Field Emission SEM, Carl-Zeis SMT, Oberkochen, Germany. The Supra 50Vp scanning electron microscope was connected to a computer for image storage and processing. The images of the samples were viewed according to the desired angle for a clearer view using computers and images were selected based on preference for evaluation."
9,Study of changes in functional groups,"2.8 Study of changes in functional groups The functional groups that exist in each of particleboards were analyzed. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis was performed by following method as suggested by Tsou et al. 2014 [28]. Spectra were viewed using Perkin Elmer Spectrophotometer machine (Waltham, U.S). The spectra of the samples were obtained by averaging 15 scans, with a wavenumber range between 4000 cm−1 and 650 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. Each sample was mixed with KBr and pressed into a disk with a ratio of 1:100."
10,X-ray diffraction analysis,"2.9 X-ray diffraction analysis Samples from each type of particleboard were characterized with the aid of X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the crystallinity index. High resolution of X-ray diffractometer from Bruker D8 Advance, Germany was used with Cu-Kα1 radiation source (λ = 1.5406A) which generated at operating voltage and current of 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The Cu Kα1 radiation was filtered electronically with a thin Ni-filter. A 2θ angle range from 10° to 70° in reflection mode was scanned at 2°/min. The crystallinity index was calculated according to Equation (1) following the previous study by Segal et al. (1959) to quantify the crystallinity of the samples [29]. The crystallinity index (CIr) was defined by: (1) C Ir = I 200 - I am I 200 × 100 where I200 was the peak intensity corresponding to crystalline and Iam was the peak intensity of the amorphous fraction."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Evaluation on mechanical properties and dimensional stability of the samples,"3.1 Evaluation on mechanical properties and dimensional stability of the samples Results on the mechanical properties of all samples were tabulated in Table 2 . The table showed that the highest modulus of rupture (MOR) value of 2.9 MPa was found for the sample made with the mixture of treated oil palm trunk with 10% PVOH and 10% citric acid. The lowest MOR value was the particleboard from treated oil palm trunk mixed with 10% PVOH and 10% citric acid and 20% calcium carbonate additives as compared to other particleboards. Hongzhen et al. [18] reported that excessive additive amount of calcium carbonate of more than 10% could result in weakening of intermolecular forces, insufficient stability of the internal structure and a decrease in the modulus of rupture. The decrease value in bending properties would be directly induced by changes in the materials composition in the flame-retardant particleboard. As could be seen in Table 2, increasing the calcium carbonate percentage from 10% to 20% into the flame-retardant particleboard would decrease the mechanical properties of flame-retardant particleboard significantly. Table 2 showed that the highest internal bonding could be achieved with particleboard made with treated oil palm trunk bonded with 10% PVOH and 10% citric acid that was 0.48 MPa. The lowest internal bonding was the mixture of treated oil palm trunk with 10% PVOH with 10% citric acid and 20% CaCO3 additive that was 0.02 MPa. The deposition of CaCO3 on the fibers would affect the bonding between PVOH and OPT particles. The particles would not bond together to resist the load, creating more voids thus decreased the strength of particleboards. It can be seen in Table 2 that MOE and IB were related to each other. A progressive decrease in thickness swelling (TS) and water absorption (WA) of particleboards treated with sodium chloride bonded with poly(vinyl) alcohol with citric acid and addition of calcium carbonate also can be observed in Table 2. It has been shown that the treated OPT bonded with 10% PVOH and 10% citric acid particleboard had the lowest thickness swelling and water absorption of 44.7% and 59.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the highest thickness swelling and water absorption recorded for untreated OPT particleboard were 152% and 130%, respectively. During exposure to the water, the oil palm trunk particles which are hydrophilic tend to absorb water and swell, thus explained the increase of the thickness and swelling values. The high porosity between untreated oil palm trunk particles allowed water to seep in, resulting in high water absorption which made the particleboard to swell and expand the thickness [23]. This result was in accordance with the previous study that particleboards without additives or a chemical modification could easily absorb water and expanded [30]. However, with addition of the PVOH and citric acid into the treated OPT for particleboard making has improved the dimensional stability of the particle by half. This also proved that the addition has enhanced the barrier and resistance of the particleboard towards the water.The reduction in thickness swelling and water absorption values were attributed to the barrier properties of chemical additives that inhibited the water permeation in the composites [20]."
13,Evaluation on limited oxygen index (LOI),"3.2 Evaluation on limited oxygen index (LOI) Limited Oxygen Index is one of the parameters for evaluating flame retardancy and flammability of the materials. The highest LOI value indicates the greater difficulty for the material to be burned [10]. The average LOI values of all produced particleboards were presented in Table 3 . At the beginning of this flammability test, the oxygen concentration was set at 21% to stimulate the oxygen content in the atmosphere [31]. The LOI result showed that untreated particleboard was easily flammable and its LOI value was only 25.57%. Zhang et al. [10] also stated that the untreated particleboards without adhesive were easily flammable. The results showed that the LOI value increased as the treated particleboards added with poly(vinyl) alcohol and calcium carbonate increased as compared to the untreated particleboards. The result in Table 3 showed that the highest LOI value was 37.17% for the sodium chloride (NaCl) treated OPT bonded with 20% PVOH and with 10% of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The addition of CaCO3 impeded the thermal decomposition by deferring time to ignition, decreased the heat of combustion and improved the flame retardancy of particleboards [32]. Schirp & Su [32] also expected that CaCO3 as a non-flammable material because of its basic nature that could react with citric acid and release CO2 and water vapors. In our investigation, LOI was improved when oil palm trunk particles were treated with NaCl and the addition of CaCO3 and PVOH. Generally, materials with LOI values greater than 26% would self-extinguish and can be considered as good flame retardants [31]."
14,Evaluation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.3 Evaluation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM image of selected particleboards was displayed in Fig. 1 . Oil palm mainly comprised of parenchyma cells and vascular bundles that were made up of a fibrous sheath, phloem cells, xylem and parenchyma cells [33]. Fig. 1(b) and (c) showed that sodium chloride and calcium carbonate were distributed evenly throughout the entire cell wall of the particleboard samples as confirmed by EDX results. From Fig. 1(c), it can be found that calcium carbonate particles were numerously attached to the inner cell wall of the OPT particles."
15,Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis,"3.4 Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis The energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is an elemental analysis that used in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the elemental composition of flame additive that added into the particleboard as compared to the untreated sample particleboard. The spectra of EDX were analyzed and the percentage of corresponding elements of carbon (C), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl) and calcium (Ca) were tabulated in Table 4 . The particleboard made from untreated OPT sample was detected with element C and O, while sample made from treated OPT + 10% PVOH + 10% CA showed the presence of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl). When 20% of calcium carbonate added as an additive into the mixture of particleboard, the element calcium (Ca) was detected. A value of 25.78% of Ca element was detected randomly across the cross section of particleboard, showing that CaCO3 added into the particleboard as flame retardant additive was evenly distributed across the particleboard."
16,Evaluation of thermal stability of particleboard,"3.5 Evaluation of thermal stability of particleboard In this test, all of the particleboard samples were exposed to increasing temperature in order to determine the heat stability. The result in Fig. 2 showed that the TGA curves of the particleboards possessed two stages of weight loss between 50 and 150 °C and 200–350 °C. The first loss was due to the loss of water and volatile matter [1] while the second loss was due to the decomposition of the sample, leading to the formation of carbonaceous char [24]. The degradation of natural fibers took place in two stages starting from the degradation of the amorphous phase consisting of hemicelluloses, lignin, and the crystalline phase, where the cellulose was dominant in the phase [34]. Fig. 2 showed that particleboard bonded with PVOH started to lose weight as the temperature reached 200 °C and the maximum decomposition was reached when the temperature was 543 °C [32]. From Fig. 2, it was shown that after the treatment of sodium chloride, the thermal stability of the lignocellulosic flame-retardant particleboards increased due to the removal of the hemicellulose and lignin during the treatment with sodium chloride process. The pre-treatment with NaCl caused a barrier of heat propagation which subsequently reduced the degradation of particleboard [15]. This also could be attributed to the higher degree of crystallinity after the addition of the inorganic materials processing [1]. The treatment process and addition of additives will attack the amorphous region in the cellulose thereby increased the degree of crystallinity and better resistance towards heat. Fig. 2 showed that the control flame retardant particleboard having the lowest thermal stability. The flame-retardant particleboard with treatment and addition of poly(vinyl) alcohol and calcium carbonate showed higher thermal resistance ascribed from the conversion of both calcium carbonate and citric acid linkages into carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures [32]."
17,Functional group analysis,"3.6 Functional group analysis The FTIR spectra of flame-retardant particleboard made from oil palm trunk (OPT) treated with sodium chloride (NaCl) bonded with poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVOH) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as an additive was illustrated in Fig. 3 . The FTIR spectra showed that all the particleboards displayed the peak around 3200 cm−1 to 3550 cm−1 is due to the vibration of OH groups. The O–H could be attributed to the existence of hydroxyl groups in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [35]. Based on the result shown in the Fig. 3, the peak was also observed in the region between 1630 and 1650 cm−1 and around 2900 cm−1 that reflect the stretching of the O–H and C–H groups, respectively."
18,X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis,"3.7 X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis Fig. 4 displayed the result of X-ray diffractograms of all flame-retardant particleboards. The XRD method was used to determine the crystallinity of the flame-retardant particleboard. Crystallinity degree in the structure of the fibers could be acknowledged by perceiving the sharpness of the diffraction peak [36]. The sharper the diffraction peak, the higher the crystallinity degree of the particles [36]. The initial diffraction peak appeared at the 2θ value in the range 21°–22° is related to the crystalline structure of cellulose as lignin is amorphous in nature [1]. From Table 5 , it was observed that the treated OPT particleboard bonded with 10% PVOH and 20% CaCO3 had slightly higher crystallinity of 31.79% as compared to other particleboards. The lowest crystallinity value of 21.91% was measured in untreated OPT particleboard. The crystallinity of the OPT fibers has slightly increased after treating the fibers with calcium chloride. The higher crystallinity value of these flame-retardant particleboards could be achieved by the reduction or removal of the amorphous region on the non-cellulosic compounds such as lignin and hemicellulose by the treatment process [36]. A previous study also reported that the pre-treatment can increase the crystallinity index with the reduction of the degree of polymerization of cellulose through the removal of alkaline metals in the materials by washing [15]. Further addition of PVOH into the treated particleboard has increased the crystallinity by 9%. The increased might be attributed by the increase interaction of OPT fibers and the PVOH matrix that enhances the potential hydrogen bonding and mechanical interlocking between the OPT fibers and PVOH [37]. This was supported by the increase in modulus of rupture and internal bonding of the particleboards after the addition of PVOH into the treated OPT particleboards."
19,Conclusions,"The study showed that the treatment of particleboard bonded with poly(vinyl) alcohol incorporated with calcium carbonate significantly improved the properties of the targeted particleboard utilization. The overall results in this work also showed that the incorporation of poly(vinyl) alcohol, citric acid and calcium carbonate composition could also influence the fire retardancy of the particleboards. The limited oxygen value test showed that a limited oxygen index for all types of flame-retardant particleboard was higher than 26%, meaning that all these particleboards were self-extinguishing and suitable to be used as non-flammable materials. However, further optimization should be carried out to find the optimum balance between physical properties, mechanical properties and fire retardancy for every possible application."
