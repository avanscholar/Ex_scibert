0,Introduction,"Facing the global energy depletion and pollutions caused by fossil fuels, hydrogen (H2) is considered as one of the potential alternative energy carrier and fuel in the future with high energy capacity and nearly-zero emission of pollutants (Nowotny et al., 2005; Ni et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010; Lior, 2010; Yuan et al., 2017). However, recently 95% of H2 generation relies heavily on fossil fuels conversion such as natural gas reformation (Ni et al., 2007), which would even deteriorate the environmental problems of fossil fuels. Therefore, to develop a promising and environmentally friendly technology for yielding H2 as clean energy source, there has been increasing interests in photocatalytic H2 production since the first study of water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 (Fujishima and Honda, 1972; Ni et al., 2007; Li et al., 2016). Concurrently, high attention has been paid on the huge amount of dye-containing wastewater generated by textile industry for decades. Apart from negative aesthetic impact, the discharge of the colored effluents to water resources causes serious environmental and ecological pollutions, and threatens the health of natural lives and humans (Solís et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2015). Moreover, those aromatic dyes with complex structures are highly resistant to conventional physicochemical and biological degradation (Solís et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2015). Photocatalysis is one of the developing potential alternatives for treating wastewater containing organic dyes and pollutants (Herrmann et al., 2007; Fernández et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2014). Many previous studies have been investigated on enhancing photocatalytic H2 production efficiency by using visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalysts for better utilization of the whole solar spectrum over other photocatalysts with wide band-gap (Li et al., 2016). Addition of sacrificing agents also allows improvement on the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency by consuming the photo-induced h+ for better e−–h+ separation (Li et al., 2016). For example, one of the common inorganic sacrificing agents is sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO3 2−) system which provides additional protection on S-based photocatalyst from anodic photo-corrosion (Bao et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Daskalaki et al., 2010; Gomathisankar et al., 2013a; Markovskaya et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). However, it was not practical to add sacrificing agent intentionally as they might be actually another sources of energy, such as methanol, and even more expensive than H2 (Cho et al., 2016). Recently, the VLD photocatalyst zinc oxysulfide (ZnOS) has been reported to have adjustable band-gap with satisfactory performances in individual photocatalytic dye degradation and H2 production (Kim et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Lehr et al., 2012; Pandey et al., 2013). In particular, it was reported that ZnOS with O:S molar ratio of 0.6:0.4 possessed a minimum band-gap of 2.7 eV (Pandey et al., 2013). In our previous study, ZnO0.6S0.4 nanoparticles were synthesized with satisfactory photocatalytic bacterial inactivation activity (Wu et al., 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, there were limited studies on multi-component system for photocatalytic H2 production with simultaneous pollutant degradation by ZnOS in the S2−/SO3 2− solution. In the present study, the main objective is to demonstrate the effective VLD photocatalytic dye degradation and simultaneous H2 production by synthesized ZnO0.6S0.4 in the presence of S2−/SO3 2− solution as the sacrificing agent. Reactive Violet 5 (RV5), a mono-azo dye, was used as the model industrial dye for the study. As S2− and SO3 2− ions are abundant by-products generated in industries after processes such as flue-gas desulfurization and fossil fuel extractions (Bao et al., 2008; Gomathisankar et al., 2013a, 2013b; Li et al., 2016), it would be a more environmentally friendly and sustainable approach to make use of these undesirable industrial dye and S wastes while generating beneficial H2 energy in a single system. The possible mechanism of the system will be discussed based on the relevant experimental results."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were used as received. Zinc nitrate 6-hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) was purchased from Uni Chem Incorporation. Tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O) was obtained from Scharlau. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), anhydrous sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) were purchased from International Laboratory. Sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4) was purchased from Peking Chemical Works. Isopropanol and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) were obtained from Merck Chemical Company. Nafion solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Reactive violet 5 (RV5, Fig. S1, Supplementary Information) was obtained from DyStar Singapore Private Limited."
3,Synthesis of zinc oxysulfide,"2.2 Synthesis of zinc oxysulfide Nanoparticles of zinc oxysulfide (ZnOS) were prepared by co-precipitation followed by calcination (Wu et al., 2016). Preliminary optimizations had been conducted by performing photocatalytic degradation of RV5 using ZnOS with different O:S ratios and calcination temperatures (Fig. S2, Supplementary Information). O:S ratio and calcination temperature for ZnOS synthesis were optimized to be 0.6:0.4 and 400 °C respectively. Briefly, an aqueous zinc ion solution was prepared by dissolving 2.98 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.082 g of Na3C6H5O7·2H2O into 50 mL of distilled water. Another aqueous solution containing 0.48 g of NaOH and 0.96 g of Na2S·9H2O was added dropwise into the zinc ion solution with continuous stirring for 2 h at room temperature (ca. 25 °C). The precipitates were washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times, respectively, and dried at 50 °C. Finally, the precipitates were calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in argon (Ar) atmosphere to obtain ZnOS nanoparticles. For XRD comparison, pure ZnO and ZnS were prepared using only 0.8 g of NaOH and only 2.4 g of Na2S·9H2O respectively in the precipitation step while all other procedure remained unchanged."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The general morphologies of the prepared samples were examined by a Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Company, Oregon, USA). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were conducted by a Tecnai F20 scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, FEI Company, Oregon, USA) operated at 200 kV. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was measured by a Quadrasorb SI analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, Florida, USA). The specific surface area and porous properties of the prepared sample were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using high intensity Cu Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA as the accelerating voltage and applied current respectively. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV–vis DRS) of the photocatalyst was measured by a Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory and BaSO4 was used as the reflectance standard. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured by a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Al Ka, 150 W) with calibration using C1s = 284.8 eV. Photocurrent measurements of the samples were performed by a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Company, China) with a conventional three-electrode cell. A Pt plate and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively. A clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was used for preparation of the working electrode. About 5 mg of samples was added in a mixed solvent (1 mL) of water/isopropanol (3:1 v/v) with addition of 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) under sonication. Next, 0.5 mL of the catalyst colloid was deposited onto the FTO glass (area of 5 cm2). The photocurrent responses were measured in 20 s on-off cycles."
5,Photocatalytic RV5 degradation and scavenger study,"2.4 Photocatalytic RV5 degradation and scavenger study In the RV5 degradation treatment, 25 mg of photocatalyst was suspended in 50 mL of RV5 solution (20 mg/L). The reaction mixture was put in dark under magnetic stirring continuously for 0.5 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium before irradiation. After that, the reaction mixture was irradiated under a 300W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) with a 400 nm cut-off filter as the visible-light source for 2.5 h. In light control, the dye solution without any photocatalyst was irradiated under the light source. One mL of sample was collected at a fixed time interval of irradiation and centrifuged to remove residual photocatalyst. The dye concentration was determined by absorbance measurement at maximum absorbance wavelength (λmax) using the UV–vis spectrometer. A standard curve was plotted for correlating the absorbance and dye concentration. The decolorization of dye solution was served as a primary evaluation of degradation, which was expressed as decolorization percentage = (C0 − Ct)/C0 × 100% (where C0 = initial concentration and Ct = concentration at time t). In scavenger study, similar experiments were performed in the presence of Na2C2O4 (10 mM, scavenger for h+), K2Cr2O7 (1 mM, scavenger for e−) and isopropanol (25 mM, scavenger for hydroxyl radical, OH) in the reaction mixture with continuous purging of Ar gas."
6,Simultaneous photocatalytic H2 production and RV5 degradation,"2.5 Simultaneous photocatalytic H2 production and RV5 degradation Photocatalytic H2 production was performed in a Labsolar-IIIAC closed gas circulation system (Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) (Fig. S3). The photocatalyst was suspended in a 50 mL-reaction mixture and it was stirred continuously inside the reactor. Aqueous solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 (S2−/SO3 2−) was used as the sacrificing agent. Prior to irradiation, the reactor was connected to the closed system and applied vacuum to remove all gases (Fig. S3, Supplementary Information). Then, the reaction mixture was irradiated under a 300W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Perfect Light Company, Beijing, China) with a 400 nm UV cut-off filter. At each time point, by turning the sampling valves of the system, a volume of 1.5 mL gaseous sample was collected and directed to an online gas chromatograph (GC-7806, Shiweipuxin, Beijing, China, with 5 Å molecular sieve column and nitrogen of high purity as carrier gas) coupled with a thermal conductivity detector for H2 measurement (Fig. S3, Supplementary Information). Quantification was conducted by converting the signal peak area to the amount of H2 according to a prepared H2 standard curve. Dye pre-treatment was performed to obtain a solution of photocatalytic degradation intermediates of RV5 (20 mg/L) for particular irradiation time. Then, the RV5 degradation intermediates solution was obtained by filtering out the used photocatalyst."
7,Degradation intermediates detection,"2.6 Degradation intermediates detection Solution samples were collected during simultaneous H2 production and RV5 degradation and filtered by 0.22 μm filter membrane. The metabolites were analyzed by total organic carbon (TOC) measurement and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). TOC was measured by an auto-sampler ASI-V with TOC analyzer TOC-VCSH (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). For FTIR analysis, samples were mixed with 0.1 g of HPLC grade potassium bromide (KBr) and dried at 50 °C before making the sample pellets. The pellets were then analyzed in the mid IR region (400–4000 cm−1) with 32 scans by a Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)."
8,Results and discussion,"From the SEM and HRTEM images, it was shown that the prepared samples were tightly aggregated nano-particles, leading to a snow-like texture (Fig. S4, Supplementary Information). The particle size of the prepared ZnOS was examined to be varied between 10 nm and 20 nm (Fig. 1 a). The EDX spectrum revealed that the prepared samples were in high purity of Zn, O and S without other impurities (Fig. 1b). The homogeneous distribution of the elements was also verified by the STEM-EDX mapping (Fig. S5, Supplementary Information). The specific surface area, pore size and pore volume of the prepared ZnOS were shown in Table S1 (Supplementary Information). The BET surface area of the ZnOS was determined as 107.3 m2 g−1. The high surface area with more active sites could help in adsorption of molecules for reaction and harvesting of light (Jiang et al., 2017). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the prepared ZnOS were shown in Fig. S6 (Supplementary Information). The isotherm of ZnOS was exhibited as a Type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores and the uniform arrangement of approximately spherical nanoparticles (Kruk and Jaroniec, 2001; Jiang et al., 2017). The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples were illustrated in Fig. 1c. It was observed that the XRD patterns of prepared ZnO and ZnS samples were respectively well fitted to ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 01-089-0510) and ZnS (JCPDS Card No. 01-089-2739) with hexagonal structures. For ZnO sample, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.8, 34.5, 36.3, 47.6, 56.7, 62.9, 66.5, 68.0 and 69.2 were corresponding to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) planes of hexagonal ZnO respectively. For ZnS sample, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.6, 47.8 and 56.6 were corresponding to (006), (108), and (116) planes of hexagonal ZnS respectively. The prepared ZnOS exhibited two sets of partial diffraction peaks which respectively corresponded to ZnO and ZnS hexagonal structures. The shifting of the partial diffraction peaks and peak broadening were attributed to the lattice mismatch between O and S in the structure of ZnOS sample (Yoo et al., 2002; Pandey et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016). Meanwhile, there was shifting of diffraction peaks to lower angle due to the deviation of lattice constants, contributed by the substitution of O by S (Lehr et al., 2012). This suggested that the O and S atoms were chemically incorporated in the as-prepared ZnOS lattice. Moreover, the spacing between lattice fringes of the prepared ZnOS in HRTEM image was found to be 0.251 nm (Fig. S4, Supplementary Information), which was different from those of standard ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 01-089-0510) and ZnS (JCPDS Card No. 01-089-2739), further confirming that the prepared sample was a ternary compound rather than just a simple mixture of pure ZnO and ZnS. The XPS analysis of the prepared ZnOS for its elemental composition and purity was illustrated in Fig. 2 . The as-synthesized photocatalyst was composed of Zn, O and S in high purity, which was in agreement with the XRD results, as shown in the survey scan in Fig. 2a. In Fig. 2b, peaks at 1022.02 eV and 1045.12 eV were corresponding to binding energies of Zn 2p3 and Zn 2p1 respectively, indicating that the valence state of Zn of the structure was 2+ (Ji et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2013). Two Gaussian sub-peaks could be fitted to the O 1s spectrum in Fig. 2c. The peak at 530.02 eV was corresponding to lattice O (Olatt) in the structure while that at 531.60 eV represented O adsorbed (Ox −) in oxygen deficient region of the crystal structure (Kim et al., 2012b; Dai et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015). In Fig. 2d showing the S 2p XPS spectrum, the asymmetric peak located in the range of 160–165 eV could be fitted to two peaks at 161.61 eV and 162.72 eV, representing S 2p3 and S 2p1 respectively (Ji et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2013). This suggested the S2− state of S in the structure. By calculation from XPS spectra, the atomic molar ratio of O:S of the prepared sample was found to be 1.51, which agreed with the theoretical value of 1.5, verifying the prepared sample to be named as ZnO0.6S0.4. As demonstrated from the results, the synthesis of highly pure ZnO0.6S0.4 nanomaterial was successful. The diffuse reflectance UV–vis absorption spectra of the precursor and as-prepared ZnO0.6S0.4 were shown in Fig. 1d. The absorption edge of the white precursor after co-precipitation was 359.7 nm, which was beyond the visible-light region. However, after calcination, the absorption edge of the yellow product ZnO0.6S0.4 was significantly shifted to the visible-light region, which implied that the electronic states of ZnO0.6S0.4 structure was greatly changed due to the orbital coupling of S and O in the valence band of ZnO0.6S0.4 after calcination of the precursor (Kim et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009; Lehr et al., 2012). Taking reference to the steep slope in the spectrum, the edge for the as-prepared ZnO0.6S0.4 was estimated to be 612.2 nm. The band-gap energy of the as-prepared sample could be calculated by the Kubelka–Munk function (Wu et al., 2015) through the equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2, where α, h, n and A are the absorption coefficient, Plank constant, the incident light frequency and a constant respectively. The band-gap energy of the as-prepared ZnO0.6S0.4 was determined to be 2.03 eV. Photocurrent of the prepared sample was measured under visible-light irradiation (Fig. S7, Supplementary Information), showing the fast and uniform responses clearly for the switch on-off cycles. The position of valence band maximum (VBM) of ZnO0.6S0.4 was estimated by valance band XPS spectrum. It was found that the VBM potential was about +1.92 V (vs. NHE), as shown in Fig. 2e. By calculation from ECB = EVB − Eg, where ECB, EVB and Eg represents conduction band minimum (CBM) potential, VBM potential and band-gap energy respectively, the CBM of the as-synthesized ZnO0.6S0.4 was about −0.11 V (vs. NHE). From the results of characterizations, it was demonstrated that because of the size and electronegativity differences between S and O atoms, their mismatched incorporation into the lattice structure helped in narrowing the band-gap energy and broadening the visible-light absorption of the as-prepared ZnO0.6S0.4. Hence, it was expected to have photocatalytic activities under visible-light irradiation by ZnO0.6S0.4. The results of degradation of RV5 in scavenger study were shown in Fig. 3 a. The degradation of RV5 followed the pseudo first-order kinetics (Ma et al., 2016) by the equation –ln(Ct/C0) = kt, where k and t are the kinetic constant and time respectively (Fig. 3b). Within 2 h irradiation, RV5 was nearly 100% degraded (k = 1.81 h−1). With argon (Ar) purging during reaction, the degradation of RV5 was about 96.5% in 2.5 h irradiation (k = 1.35 h−1). As the purpose for Ar purging was to remove O2 dissolved in the solution, any superoxide (O2 −) and further produced reactive species from initial reaction between e− and O2 on the photocatalyst surface was minimized. The slight reduction on RV5 degradation rate under Ar purging indicated that the presence of O2 did not significantly influence the degradation of RV5, hence implying that O2 − was not the major reactive species for the degradation process. Besides, the energy of e− in conduction band (−0.11 V, vs. NHE) was not negative enough to generate O2 − since the redox potential of O2/O2 − is −0.33 V (vs. NHE) (Wang et al., 2015). Moreover, the degradation was inhibited to 35.8% (k = 0.18 h−1) in 2.5 h with the addition of e− scavenger. This showed that the e− in conduction band was responsible for the direct degradation of RV5 by reduction. While in the presence of h+ scavengers, the degradation of RV5 was also greatly reduced to 22.4% (k = 0.10 h−1) in 2.5 h irradiation. This suggested that h+ in the valence band, which could directly react with RV5 or generate OH, was an important participant responsible for the degradation. However, there was only a slight inhibition of RV5 degradation (94.0%, k = 1.12 h−1) when the OH scavenger was applied. This indicated that the photo-generated h+ was consumed mainly for direct RV5 degradation. Therefore, the above results confirmed that both the e− and h+ have taken part directly in photocatalytic degradation of RV5 by ZnO0.6S0.4. The degradation of RV5 was indicated by the loss of color of the solution, representing the breakdown of the chromophore of dye molecules, but not the complete mineralization of all organic compounds (see result of TOC analysis, Fig. S8, Supplementary Information). The colorless degradation intermediates were presented and could be further mineralized by photocatalysis into harmless states such as SO4 2−, CO2, H2O and N2 (Patsoura et al., 2006; Herrmann et al., 2007). The prepared ZnO0.6S0.4 was tested for VLD photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous mixture of S2−/SO3 2− as sacrificing agent as shown in Fig. 4 . In 3 h irradiation, about 70.4 μmol g−1 of H2 was produced by ZnO0.6S0.4. It should be noted that there has been studies on H2 production by photolytic reactions of solutions of sulfide and sulfite under UV irradiation (Linkous et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2010). From our control experiment, no H2 was produced when aqueous solution mixture of S2−/SO3 2− was irradiated by visible-light (Fig. S9, Supplementary Information), which indicated that there was no effect of any photolytic reaction of S2−/SO3 2− solution. Hence, VLD photocatalytic H2 production ability of the prepared ZnO0.6S0.4 was verified. In this visible-light-driven system, the reaction mechanism was described by Eqs. (1)–(7) (Bao et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010; Markovskaya et al., 2015): (1) ZnO 0.6 S 0.4 + hv → h + + e − (2) 2 e − + 2 H 2 O → H 2 + 2 OH − (3) 2 S 2 − + 2 h + → S 2 2 − (4) SO 3 2 − + 2 OH − + 2 h + → SO 4 2 − + 2 H + surface (5) 2 e − + 2 H + Surface → H 2 (6) S 2 2 − + SO 3 2 − → S 2 O 3 2 − + S 2 − (7) SO 3 2 − + S 2 − + 2 h + → S 2 O 3 2 − The protons generated on the surface of catalyst from sacrificing SO3 2− (Eq. (4)) could possibly also act as an extra source of H2 generation by proton reduction (Eq. (5)). According to Eq. (6), the presence of SO3 2− ions provided additional protecting role to suppress the amount of yellow disulfide ions, which caused optical competition with the photocatalyst and e− competition with reduction of protons (Chen et al., 2010). After reaction between SO3 2− ions and disulfide ions (Eq. (6)), the generated colorless thiosulfate ions would not have such competitions with the photocatalytic systems. With continuous reaction, the rate of H2 production can be reduced due to the prolonged consumption of the S2−/SO3 2− solution. At the same time, from Fig. 4, it was obvious that simultaneous H2 production and RV5 degradation was achieved, with a favourable enhancement in both H2 production and RV5 degradation. In the presence of RV5 in S2−/SO3 2− solution, the H2 production was 137.3 μmol g−1 in 3 h (Fig. 4), which showed significant 95.0% enhancement when compared to S2−/SO3 2− solution alone, while the decolorization of RV5 solution was found to be 96.7% in the 1 h and be completed in 3 h. Results of other studies using different photocatalysts and sacrificing agents were listed in Table S2, Supplementary Information (Patsoura et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2007; Daskalaki et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012a; Gomathisankar et al., 2013a, 2013b; Wang et al., 2013; Badawy et al., 2015; Romão et al., 2016). Indeed, it was not easy to compare the results of present study with other reported results since different experimental conditions were used, including the concentrations of photocatalysts and sacrificing agents, loading of co-catalysts, light sources, etc. For instance, for those studies using high-energy UV–visible-light obviously would have higher yield than those studies using visible-light only (Table S2, Supplementary Information), while the H2 generation by UV-photolysis of S2−/SO3 2− was rarely distinguished from the total H2 production. Though, as a rough comparison, the H2 production rate of the current study was generally higher than those of the VLD systems shown in Table S2 (Supplementary Information). The fast degradation of RV5 was contributed by the photocatalytic ZnO0.6S0.4 in S2−/SO3 2− system, demonstrated in Fig. S10 (Supplementary Information). The alkaline condition possibly facilitated some hydroxyl radicals (OH) generated from reaction of hydroxide ions (OH−) and h+ at surface of the photocatalyst (Wong and Chu, 2003). The OH could attack the dye molecules and accelerated the degradation of RV5 (Jia et al., 2013). Besides, the role of S2−/SO3 2− serving as the sacrificing agent helped to improve the e−–h+ separation (Bao et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Daskalaki et al., 2010; Gomathisankar et al., 2013a; Zhao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016), so there was an increase in the amount of available e−, hence in the rate of direct RV5 degradation. It was interesting to note that most of the RV5 had been already decolorized in 1 h, but the enhancement of H2 was not observed in 1 h (Fig. 4). This implied that the RV5 was not likely to function as a photo-sensitizer upon visible-light irradiation by transferring photo-excited e− into the conduction band of ZnO0.6S0.4 for H2 production (Yuan et al., 2017). It was verified by the photocurrent measurements of the system (Fig. S11, Supplementary Information), showing no significant difference between the systems with and without RV5. Instead of e− transfer from RV5 to ZnO0.6S0.4, some of the extra available e− from ZnO0.6S0.4 was consumed by RV5 direct degradation, so the H2 production was not benefited by the increase of available e− at the beginning. However, the H2 enhancement could be observed later in 2 h and 3 h. This proposed that the RV5 was not the direct promoter, but dynamic intermediates and products were potentially responsible for the H2 promotion after partial degradation (decolorization) of RV5. To investigate the effect of intermediates, photocatalytic H2 production was performed by ZnO0.6S0.4 using partially degraded solution, which contained dynamic intermediates after RV5 decolorization (Fig. S9, Supplementary Information). In the presence of intermediates, H2 production was nearly doubled, confirming the effect of intermediates in promotion of photocatalytic H2 production of the system. Besides, H2 could be produced using the intermediate solution alone in alkaline condition of same pH without S2−/SO3 2− (Fig. S12, Supplementary Information), showing capability of intermediates to individually act as the promoter. To study the effect of RV5 on the H2 enhancement, different initial concentrations of RV5 was used for H2 production in the presence of S2−/SO3 2− by ZnO0.6S0.4 (Fig. 5 ). The highest promotion in H2 production was achieved when 40 mg/L of RV5 was used, by which H2 production was lifted by 109.6% in 3 h. However, the total H2 production was increased by only 44.4% when RV5 concentration was increased to 50 mg/L. Further increase of RV5 concentration to 100 mg/L hindered the H2 production, showing no significant difference from the control without addition of RV5, despite the observation of decolorization of RV5 in 1 h. Consistent to the results shown in Fig. 4, the RV5 had been highly decolorized in 1 h. As mentioned, the “delayed” promotion in H2 production was attributed to the dynamic intermediates. As the initial RV5 concentration increased, more intermediates were generated after the initial breakdown of RV5, leading to the later H2 enhancement. However, as more RV5 molecules and some generated intermediates were present, keener e− competition would occur between the degradation process and production of H2 (Eq. (2)), whereas more time would be needed to generate effective intermediates for H2 enhancement. Hence, the H2 promotion effect of degradation intermediates would be offset by the degradation and delayed further when the initial RV5 concentration was further increased (e.g. 100 mg/L). Besides, as the initial RV5 concentration increased, the deeper color of solution would lead to some reduction of light absorption by the photocatalyst, causing a lowered photocatalytic performance. Therefore, there was an optimal RV5 concentration of 40 mg/L for the present simultaneous processes. For better understanding of the mechanism, analysis on intermediates produced during the simultaneous photocatalytic reactions was conducted. The FTIR spectra of the dye and decolorized intermediates at different irradiation time were shown in Fig. 6 . Various absorption peaks and bands were observed in the spectra, indicating the presence of different chemical bonds and changes of organic substances during the reactions. At t = 0 h, it should be noted that due to the highly alkaline S2−/SO3 2− background, some characteristic absorption peaks were merged into large bands when compared to original RV5 FTIR spectrum (Fig. S13, Supplementary Information). For example, specific peaks at 1141 and 1182 cm−1 (respectively corresponding to the SO3 groups and SO2 group of RV5) (Jain et al., 2012) were incorporated into the shoulder of a broader band peaked at 1123 cm−1. It was also observed that the peak representing the stretching of NN azo bond, which is responsible for the color of the dye, at 1548 cm−1 was interfered by the presence of S2−/SO3 2− (Fig. S13, Supplementary Information). However, the RV5 degradation could be clearly revealed from the absence of old peaks and appearance of new peaks in the spectra as the photocatalytic reactions proceeded (0 h–3 h). The disappearance of peak at 1123 cm−1 indicated the SO bonds of SO3 were cleaved prior to SO2 groups. The cleavage of the azo bond was evident by the absence of peak at 1438 cm−1 corresponding to para-substituted azobenzene (Jain et al., 2012) after 1 h irradiation, being consistent with the result of RV5 decolorization (Fig. 4). Meanwhile, there was a new peak at 1106 cm−1 ascribed to the free NH groups at 1 h (Jain et al., 2012). Increased peaks 1106 and 1638 cm−1 indicated more free NH group formation, suggesting that production of primary or secondary amines and amides originated from the reductive cleavage of mono-azo bond of RV5 (Coates, 2006; Jain et al., 2012). Moreover, the peak at about 1020 cm−1, which was corresponded to the CN stretching of primary amine (Coates, 2006; Tichonovas et al., 2013), were found to be appeared during the reactions indicating the asymmetric cleavage of the dye (Fernández et al., 2010). The broad peak at the region about 3100–3600 cm−1 was attributed to NH of amines and OH stretching vibrations (Coates, 2006; Tichonovas et al., 2013). The peak at about 620 cm−1 was characteristic absorption of out-of-plane bending vibrations of the OH while the group of peaks found in 670–900 cm−1 represented the vibrations of aromatic CH (Coates, 2006). The decrease of peaks in this region implied the breakdown of aromatic rings of the intermediates. The peaks at 1195 and 1382 cm−1 were attributed to the formation of organic sulfates (Coates, 2006). Isothiocyanates were also probably present as intermediates, indicated by the peaks at 2080 and 2092 cm−1 (Coates, 2006). The 1414 and 1457 cm−1 peaks could be referred to the presence of ammonium and carbonate ions (Coates, 2006), which suggested the partial degradation of some organic intermediates to inorganic ions after 3 h (as supported by TOC analysis, Fig. S8, Supplementary Information). The TOC was decreased by 31% during the 3 h reactions, while there was decrease of TOC reduction rate after 1 h, in agreement with that the relatively high resistance of the organic intermediates produced after 1 h (Solís et al., 2012). Although the degradation pathway of RV5 (which is beyond the scope of the present study) was not examined, the above results verified the presence of organic intermediates after decolorization of RV5 during the simultaneous photocatalytic H2 production. Based on the literature and above experimental results, a potential mechanism was proposed as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Without addition of dye, the photocatalytic H2 production by ZnO0.6S0.4 proceeded as described by Eqs. (1)–(7). For the simultaneous system, more OH and photo-induced e− were available in the presence of sacrificial S2−/SO3 2−, while some of those e− would participate in reductive cleavage of azo-bond of RV5, causing enhanced decolorization of the solution (Fig. 4 and Fig. S10). Since part of the additional e− were shared for RV5 degradation, there was no obvious difference in H2 produced in 1 h. Eventually, as the reactions proceeded, the “delayed” H2 enhancement was observed and was contributed by the presence of organic degradation intermediates. Different intermediates and secondary products were generated during the dynamic reaction. Previous study of the photocatalytic degradation of RV5 demonstrated several different intermediates of RV5 including different aromatic acids, alcohols and carbonyl compounds (Chung and Chen, 2009). From our FTIR results (Fig. 6), amine was one of the major intermediates after the cleavage of azo-bond. With sufficient irradiation time, intermediates became effective, such as possessing e−-donating ability to act as the sacrificing agents by oxidative breakdown, to increase the amount of available e− for reduction to H2 (Fig. S9, Supplementary Information). It was possible for some organic intermediates to undergo partial mineralization to produce H2, but most likely the organic intermediates were served as sacrificing agent for the consumption of h+ (Kim and Choi, 2010). Since the RV5 used in the present study was in small amount, it was not applicable to identify the precise generation and to follow the fate of the intermediates and products produced (Patsoura et al., 2006). In addition, the photocatalytic dye degradation was dynamic so that the intermediates could be varied and in trace amount that could hardly be identified. Nevertheless, the FTIR and TOC results supported generally the existence of multiple dynamic intermediates could be concurrently responsible for the H2 production enhancement, and it was verified by doubled H2 production using intermediate solution in the simultaneous system (Fig. S9, Supplementary Information). Finally, some of the organic compounds would be mineralized to inorganic products including SO4 2−, CO2, H2O and N2 (Patsoura et al., 2006; Herrmann et al., 2007)."
9,Conclusions,"Presently, VLD ternary photocatalyst ZnO0.6S0.4 have been successfully synthesized by simple co-precipitation and calcination methods for photocatalytic applications. Enhancement in both RV5 degradation and H2 production was achieved by ZnO0.6S0.4 in the simultaneous photocatalytic reaction system containing S2−/SO3 2− as sacrificing agent. The H2 enhancement exhibited the highest (109.6%) when RV5 concentration was 40 mg/L in the presence S2−/SO3 2− (1:1) solution with amount of 147.5 μmol g−1 in 3 h. Experimental results showed strong support and verification to the proposed mechanism. The effective intermediates produced by partial photocatalytic degradation of RV5 had significant contribution to increase the H2 production simultaneously in S2−/SO3 2− solution. The intermediates analysis by FTIR was also in agreement with the proposed mechanism, showing the presence of potential e−-donating organic intermediates after decolorization of RV5. The intermediates produced acted as synergic sacrificing agents and underwent further degradation. Oxidative degradation of the intermediates could promote the consumption of photo-induced h+, and hence increased the available e− for H2 production. As the concentration of dye increased, the competition of e− for degradation overwhelmed the sacrificing effect of e−-donating intermediates. As a result, excess RV5 addition limited the H2 enhancement. The present study demonstrated the utilization of both organic wastes (RV5) and inorganic pollutants (S2−/SO3 2−) in industrial wastewater as the sacrificing agent for generation of photocatalytic H2 under visible-light irradiation. This provided environmental implication on the developing photocatalysis as a green and sustainable technology for concurrent pollutants degradation and H2 energy generation in the future."
