0,Introduction,"In the last years, the development of new sustainable alternatives for wastewater treatment has been an interesting topic of research for academicians and industry. In Colombia, the beverage industry has a wide range of products in the market, integrated by drinks, juices, tea drinks, energizing beverages, and several kinds of bottled water, and the per capita consumption is 49–50 L and 5 L per year for juices, respectively, being one of the most traditional and economically robust industry in the country, which attends to the domestic and international demand of 29 importer countries worldwide [1]. The wastewater produced by the beverage industry are regulated by the Environment and Sustainable Development Ministry of Colombia through the Resolution 0631 of 2015 [2]; the allowed values of wastewater concentrations are 6–9 for pH, 400 mg COD/L, 200 mg BOD5/L, 50 mg TSS/L, 2.0 mg SS/L, 20 mg/L (fats and oil), 600 mg/L chlorides and 500 mg/L of sulphides. The beverage industry uses between 20 and 30% of water for production, being a percentage vaporized, and other fraction discharged into the sewage [3]; this last fraction is conformed by fructose, glucose, saccharose, lactose, fruit concentrates, smelling agents, preservatives (tartaric acid, phosphoric acid), bicarbonate, carbonic acid, dissolved carbon, and mineral salts [4]. The total soluble organic matter present in the wastewater from the beverage industry is about 62% [5]. Its COD/TOC ratio (3.8), indicate that this water is suitable to be treated by biological processes in combination with physical-chemical methods [6]; other authors, such as [7] indicate that plenty of the utilized treatment technologies by the beverage industry consider biological processes such as anaerobic digestion (AD) followed by activated sludge, and others [8,9], also indicate that these wastewater treatments are complemented with membrane filtration and chemical methods, which generate high operational costs and several undesired extra pollutants. AD is a process that involves two-stages, in the first, acidogenic bacteria convert organic compounds into H2, CO2, and volatile organic acids, which are then converted in a second stage, into acetic acid by acetogenic bacteria, until reaching methane production by methanogenic archaea. This process can occur in single or two-stage configurations of reactors; however, the first can cause problems, mainly because of the different growth rates of the two main groups of organisms and the management of the appropriate pH for each case [10]. In this sense, the advantage of the two-stage AD process is reflected in the stability, the tolerance to the high concentration of organic matter, and the possibility to recover byproducts with value-added. The separation of the acidogenic stage from the methanogenic stage produces a better yield of the biogas and also optimizes the reaction rates in both reactors improving the degradation of the substrate separately [11]. Vergine et al. [12], Isla et al. [8], and Kim et al. [13], observed that the application of AD in two stages in the wastewater from the manufacture of beverages generates other by-products such as bioethanol, bioH2, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), that could be recovered, allowing the concept of biorefinery to be developed in the industry. However, these works concluded that it is necessary to continue with the treatment of the effluent given the high presence of easily degraded organic matter that could not be discharged into the receiving sources. Zuo et al. [14,15], emphasize that the high production of biogas observed in the two-stage AD occurs mainly because of the transformation of the organic matter present in the RA. Also, they indicate that the concentrations of COD in the influent between 6000 and 18000 mg/L, promotes the production of the VFA's in the RA that is received in the RM and this strategy promotes the development of fermentative bacteria in both reactors. Based on this, they conclude that the rapid development of fermenting bacteria in two-stage systems (RA+RM) stimulates the production of biogas with values close to 4.4 ± 0.3 L/d with a percentage methane content in the biogas of 60.5 ± 2.6%. Besides, was demonstrated that two-stage AD cannot be performed with OLR values less than 1.7 g VS/L.d. The production of biogas (ie. CH4, H2, and CO2) has been strongly implemented in countries with economic subsidies for electricity generation. In some countries such as Germany and Sweden, biogas is also used as a biofuel for transport. For example, Sweden leads the world in automotive biogas production, with a total fleet of approximately 4500 vehicles with 45% of its biomethane-supplied fuel [8]. To evaluate the efficiency of the bioprocesses, it is essential to compare the number of electrons transferred from feedstock to the end product, in this case, hydrogen, and the energy efficiency [11]. Dark fermentation (DF) has been limited by negative gain values. Although many studies have focused on improving hydrogen production, little has been done on improving energy production through the RA. It is worth mentioning that the energy efficiency is the relationship to the value of the Lower Heating Value (LHV) ideal, generated from the subtraction of the heat of vaporization of water and the higher heating value, but the AD process includes the production of various combustion gases (H2, CH4, and CO2), the adequate estimation of LHV becomes critical to determining the actual energy potential of the AD process. Therefore, the BS ISO 6976:2016 [16] presents in detail the methodology for calculating the gross and net calorific value of any natural gas or other gaseous fuel from a known molar composition. The calculation is based mainly on including the compressibility factor (Z) in the LHV estimation. The compressibility factor considers many aspects including gas pressure and temperature. This evaluation allows a more realistic assessment of the calorific value since biogas is not an ideal gas. Based on the above, the anaerobic reactor in two-stage allows producing hydrogen and methane simultaneously, which allows the recovery of biogas but also to achieve the stabilization of organic matter. In this sense, the purpose of this research was to study both the process stability using indicators for monitoring the AD and the removal efficiency of organic content. A secondary purpose was to observe the energy gain adjusting the value of the LHV by the compressibility factor in an AD process operated in two-stage during the treatment of real wastewater from the beverage industry. This issue is a novelty because is not common to modify from the thermodynamics tables."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Industrial wastewater and sampling,"2.1 Industrial wastewater and sampling The wastewater of this study comes from a beverage industry in Bogota (Colombia). The samples were collected from the Parshall flume placed at the entrance of the wastewater treatment plant. The samples were collected twice per week during ca.176 days, and were stored at 4 °C and preserved following the directions of IDEAM (Instituto de Hidrología Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales) [17]; afterward, the samples were transported and preserved to the lab for their posterior analysis."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up The wastewater treatment evaluated at laboratory scale was performed by two anaerobic reactors, named acidogenic reactor (RA) and methanogenic reactor (RM), which were built in rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with an inner diameter of 74 mm, 960 mm of length, and a useful volume of 4.10 L. The internal configuration of the reactors has polyethylene rings of high density with 19 mm of diameter and 10 mm of height (which occupied 200 mm of height) to provide support for the reactors; the rings have a polyurethane foam nucleus with a specific individual surface of 950 m2/m3. The above configuration avoided the biomass dragging and allowed more reactor resistance against inhibitory substances and organic loads [18]. The reactors' temperature was kept in the mesophilic range (35 °C) by the utilization of two thermic blankets (Local fabrication). The blankets covered the two reactors entirely as seen in Fig. 1 , and there were controlled by an electronic device of Watlow's brand."
4,Inoculation,"2.3 Inoculation The inoculation of the RA was performed through natural fermentation according to the recommendations of Lite et al. [19], Fernandes et al. [20], whose advantage is the non-needing of pretreatment to enrich the acidogenic biomass [21]. This method consisted of setting to ambient temperature the industrial wastewater for three days and then recirculated for 72 h to guarantee a better adherence with the support medium. Gomes et al. [22], demonstrated that this fermentation, caused by the combination of the microorganisms present in the air and the tap water, is beneficial to maintain the acidogenic conditions. The operation of the RA started afterward with the previous initialization (support medium + inoculum). The RM was inoculated with granular sludge taken from the UASB reactor treating beverage industry wastewater (Bogotá- Colombia). The reactor's sludge volume was a third of a useful volume (ie. 0.883 L), and the TVS was 4140.29 g/L. Once the RM reactor's sludge was inoculated, it was fed with a nutrient solution compound as recommended by Chernicharo et al. [23],: C2H3NaO2: 4 g/L, KH2PO4: 6.5 g/L, NH4Cl: 5.0 g/L, NaHCO3: 7.0 g/L, CaCl2 2H2O: 1 g/L, Na2S·7H2O: 0.5 g/L, Zn·Cl2: 0.0005 g/L, FeCl3·6H2O: 0.02 g/L."
5,Operational conditions,"2.4 Operational conditions The RA and RM reactors were operated sequentially for 107 days. However, to promotes the adaptation of the process before receiving the acidogenic effluent, the startup of RM was 69 days before the sequential operation. The RA reactor was operated with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, and pH adjusted to 5.5 with HCL - 0.1 M or NaOH - 1 M. The RM reactor had a HRT of 16 h, maintaining the pH close to 7.2 by the adding of NaOH – 1 M. Regard the alkalinity in RM was adjusted with NaHCO3. In both reactors, the HRT was controlled by a Masterflex L/S brand peristaltic pump with the capacity to regulate flow rates from 0.0006 to 3400 ml/min. Besides, the pH values for both systems were selected according to Mao et al. [24], that indicates that the acidogenic and methanogenic activity reach the optimum production of biohydrogen and biomethane in ranges of pH of 5.5–6.5 and 6.5 to 8.2 respectively."
6,Analytical methods,"For the characterization of the wastewater, it was measured the following parameters: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), pH, carbohydrates, temperature, UV254, conductivity, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, sulfate, and TOC. All the assays considered the recommendations of the Standard Methods for the examination of water and wastewater [25]. To monitoring the stability of the methanogenic phase, the partial (PA) and intermediate (IA) alkalinities, total volatile acids (TVA), pH value (measured with Orion Star A111 electrode, Thermo brand), the IA/PA ratio were assessed as suggested by Refs. [26,27]. Besides, according to Ambrose et al. [28], the FOS/TAC ratio (ie., volatile organic acid to alkaline buffer capacity) also is a good indicator to assess the process stability of an anaerobic digester. The organic matter removal was measured by COD [25] and the Carbohydrate concentration was determined, by the phenol method proposed by Herbert et al., [29]. The measurement of biogas's flow was done through the Ritter flowmeter. This device was coupled and placed at the biogas exit of each reactor. The datasets generated were broadcasted via Bluetooth and stored in a desktop computer through the LabVIEW® software, and the biogas composition (H2, CH4, and CO2) was determined by a gas chromatographer Agilent 7890A GC with a conductivity detector (TCD) and a capillary column 1010 plot. With an inner diameter of 0.32 mm, 30 in length, and 25 μm of a stationary inner layer, the injector and detector kept between 200 and 250 °C respectively. The internal temperature ramp within the oven worked at 90 °C for 1 min reaching 250 °C at 24 c/min of velocity during 8 min of run. Also, 0.6 mL of nitrogen gas was utilized as the carrier gas. All parameters were measured two times per week and statistically analyzed with the software ORIGIN PRO 8.5. The volumetric production of both, H2 and CH4, was calculated according to the equations proposed by Moureira et al., [30]."
7,Energetic analysis,"The adjustment of the LHV adjusted was carried out using Eq. (1) and (2), as indicated by the ISO Standard ISO 6976:2016 and Eq. (3) represent the energy efficiency with the LHVadj and LHVideal. a. Lower heating value (LHVadj) (1) L H V a d j [ k J / L ] = x j ( ∑ j = 1 n L H V i d e a l j − ∑ j = 1 n ( b j 2 ) H ) ( Z R T 2 P 2 ) Where L H V i d e a l j , R , T 2 are the calculated heating value of the biogas mixture, the heating value of each component at a combustion temperature of 15 °C (kJ/mol), the gas constant (J/mol· K), and the absolute temperature of operation (K), respectively. The term b j and H is the number of hydrogen atoms present in a molecule of each component of the biogas mixture (H2 and CH4) and the vaporization Enthalpy of water at a combustion temperature of 15 °C, respectively. b. Compressibility factor (2) Z [ d i m e n s i o n l e s s ] = 1 − ( P 2 P 0 ) [ ∑ j = 1 n x j s j . ( t 2 , P o ) ] 2 In Eq. (1), the terms P 2 , P 0 , x j and s j , are the local atmospheric pressure (kPa), the standard pressure (101.325 kPa), the mole fraction of the component (H2, CO2, and CH4) in the biogas, and summation factor for a combustion temperature of 15 °C, respectively. c. Energy efficiency (EE) Eq. (8) recommended by Xie et al. [31], was used to estimate the energy efficiency. (3) E E [ % ] = H Y · L H V H 2 L H V S a c Where LHVH2 and LHVSac are the low calorific power of Hydrogen gas and Sucrose respectively (242 kJ/mol, 5650.68 kJ/mol), HY, is the Hydrogen Yield expressed as mol H2/mol Sac."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Wastewater characterization,"5.1 Wastewater characterization Table 1 shows the characterization of the wastewater. This effluent is discharged on different days at a Parshall flume located at the entrance of the industry wastewater treatment plant. This wastewater was a mixture of the three production lines in the factory, known as juices, soft drink, and imperfect production (ie. products that do not accomplish the standard quality and are returned to the factories). Islas et al. [8], pointed out that wastewater derived from the last line, is generated massively in the beverage industries, and these production lines produce the most sugar content. It should be noted that the raw wastewater characteristics varied widely over time, for example, the pH value was between 2.7 and 11.8, predominantly acid values while the content of carbohydrate oscillates to 103.5 from 8152.4 mg/L. According to Peixoto et al. [32], this water is susceptible to be treated to obtain hydrogen gas (H2). Concerning COD, the variability observed indicates that this wastewater not only is a complex mixture but also can be classified according to Lay et al. [33], as high-strength WW. Finally, it is important to take into account that the variation in the wastewater characteristic from any industry quite often causes instability in the biological process [34]."
10,Stability and organic matter removal of the two stage AD system,"5.2 Stability and organic matter removal of the two stage AD system The monitoring of the AD process is a matter of concern because to obtain a good conversion efficiency, it is needed to maintain the equilibrium of the carbonate system. The adjustment of pH in the AD is known as the beneficial practice that ensures good operation in the process; however, an adequate regulation must be carried out since high salt concentrations can inhibit the methanogenic process [35]. Fig. 2 , shows the temporal variation of the pH in the AD system. The median value for the inlet was 5.43 ± 0.67 and for the effluent was 8.28 ± 0.55, showing that in the system there was no accumulation of VFA, indicating that in the biological process did not appear disturbances imbalance. However, authors like Boe et al. [36], Martin et al. [37], and Lahav et al. [27], expose that only the value of pH is not enough to understand and analyze the stability derived from the buffer capacity of the wastewaters. This is, in AD rectors with low buffering capacity, the value of pH is adequate while in a well-buffered system the pH is not a good indicator [38]. Currently, the titration methodologies are widely used, among these the FOS/TAC and IA/PA ratio have shown suitable for this task [36]. Fig. 3 shows the variation of these variables. The TAC shows the buffer capacity, and the FOS value corresponds to the concentration of the Fatty organic acids [39]. Studies have indicated that FOS/TAC values higher than 0.6, generate inadequate functioning in the process, and also affect the anaerobic microorganisms present in the system, resulting in decreases in the production of biogas; besides, values less than 0.3, promotes process instability [28]. The IA/PA ratio is known as an indicator of the concentration of VFA, and it is recommended a value below 0.3 to maintain a stable system [26]. However, authors such as Martin et al. [37], suggest that the optimal value of this indicator depends on the substrate and the experimental conditions. In particular, both indicators showed that the biological process did not present an acidic shock. The value of the median for the IA/PA and for the FOS/TAC from the first 40 days of operation of the system (RA + RM) was 0.34 ± 0.023 and 0.18 ± 0.08, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, these results of IA/PA of 0.34 and FOS/TAC ratio of 0.18, assure a stable reactor performance, maintaining TVA below 124 ± 83.5 mg/L. Martin et al. [37], observed different limit values of IA/PA to reach the stability of the process, all of them depending mainly on the TVA concentration. Also, Fig. 3 shows that from day 40 the process shows drops and oscillation on the stability indicators indicating an imbalance of the biological process. It is important to remark that although the value of pH did not decrease, the median value of TVA in this period was 8143 ± 65.2. FOS/TAC and IA/PA showed similar behavior and almost identical results in some operation days; in this sense, the alkalinity ratios are better indicators of the AD stability than only the value of the pH [36]. On the other hand, there was not observed enough production of the bicarbonate alkalinity during the methanogenic reactor. In this study, we adjust with NaHCO3;this adjustment was made based on the literature values of VFAs and partial alkalinity (PA) to guarantee a buffer capacity, that is, PA on the influent close to 1500 mg/L and VFAs less than 2000 mg/L, Franco et al., [40]. The PA in the influent was 1447.04 mg/L ± 101.15 mg/L and in the effluent was 1431.00 mg. L−1 ± 769.25 mg/L. In the case of intermediate alkalinity (IA), a mean of 696.93 mg/L ± 319.63 and 746.53 mg/L± 697.35 mg/L was observed for the affluent and the effluent respectively. According to Irvan et al. [35], the buffer capacity of the process depends not only on maintaining an adequate pH, alkalinity, and low concentrations of VFAs but also on other parameters as the substrate/inoculum (S/I) (gVSsubstrate/gVSinoculum). Table 2 show a brief summary of some indicators for the monitoring of the stability of the AD process. Fig. 4 , indicates the COD removal in the methanogenic reactor as well as the adaptation phase and the sequential operation of the two stage AD process. The mean removal efficiency value in the first 40 days of operation was 67.02 ± 20.82%. After this day, the RM received the effluent from the RA, and was observed that in the next days the removal decreased drastically. From day 80 the removal of COD decreases until day 115, reaching a value of 5%. A possible explanation for this result is the combination of a high value of hydraulic retention time (16h) and a high concentration of organic matter present in the RA effluent (approx. 6500 mg/L) that promoted an accumulation of organic matter and intermediaries that the system was unable to degrade. These differences can be attributed to the performance of the RA effluent received by the RM, which was not completely hydrolyzed, and thus, the degradation of the organic matter by the archeas methanogenic was extremely difficult. The results of Sivagurunathat et al. [46], evidenced the limitations and restrictions of working with real wastewater from the beverage industry and the relevance of the water composition and the production processes of the factory during the assessments. It is worth mentioning that from the 115th, the COD decreased in the influent of the, and this improved slightly the performance, obtaining removal close to 30%. However, the alteration caused by the organic load shock did not allow the RM to fully recover and obtain high organic matter removal again. Similar results were observed by Cuff et al. [47], that reported a decrease in the removal of COD in an EGSB reactor treating real wastewater from the non-alcoholic beverage industry in Taiwan. In particular, a drop in the COD removal from 80 to 10% was observed in their experiment, when the values of COD at the affluent of the reactor were equal to or greater than 8000 mg/L. Fig. 5 shows the removal of organic matter measured as COD in the acidogenic reactor. The mean value of the removal efficiency was 7.17 ± 5.81%. According to Lu et al. [48], the reduction of COD in an acidogenic stage is low, because the substrate at this phase is converted mainly in byproducts such as VFA and alcohols, thus the concentration of COD remains. The only loss of COD is because of the formation of gases such as H2 and CO2 and the formation of new biomass. These results are concomitant with the low percentage of methane in the biogas. As seen in Fig. 5 the days that COD was removed, the methane also was present, the maxim value of methane in this stage was 7.08 ± 6.21%. Fig. 6 shows the values of the percentage of hydrogen in the biogas during the study period in the RA. The mean composition of the biogas was for hydrogen 18.16 ± 12.26% and CO2 79.04 ± 20%, being remarkable in the presence of CO2. Regard the volumetric hydrogen production rate the mean value was 0.881 ± 762.21 L H2/L.d. It should be noted that the composition of effluents generated by the beverage industry has high variability and usually drastic changes in their concentration. This situation generates serious problems in the stability of the biological processes. Lin et al. [49], pointed out that hydrogen production may be affected by the high concentrations of the total sugars present in the wastewater from the beverage industry. For example, they cited those values greater than 40 g of total sugar/L can cause an imbalance in the system and promotes an important disturbance in hydrogen production. In this sense, the same authors state that the value of VHPR can increase significantly, as a result of the increase in CO2, once this gas influences the calculation of the total biogas flow. These results are similar to the study conducted by Lin et al. [50], who obtained a volumetric hydrogen production value of 20 LH2/L.d with a concentration of 40 g total sugar/L and reported a low percentage of hydrogen in the biogas."
11,Energy efficiency (EE) in the acidogenic stage,"5.3 Energy efficiency (EE) in the acidogenic stage The EE is the ratio between the energy produced and the energy used in the process; its evaluation allows identifying the true potential for energy recovery from wastewater treatment using anaerobic digestion systems [51]. The EE is estimated with the LHV; the selection of this value is critical because the biogas produced in the AD process is not an ideal gas. Hurtado et al. [52], propose a more accurate calculation of EE, in which the LHV should be adjusted using BS ISO 6976:2016 [16]. These authors observed that the difference between the EE when adjusting the LHV versus the EE when using the LHVideal is almost 50% less. The critical factor being the mole fraction of the gas in the biogas (ie. H2 or CH4). Table 3 shows the EE obtained from the gas hydrogen, calculated with the ideal and the adjusted LHV. As observed, the EE with the LHVadj is lower if compared with the value of EE measured with the LHVideal, which can be explained by the significant difference between the values of LHVideal (242 kJ/mol) and LHVadj (0.51 kJ/mol). Is important to notice that this result is a consequence mainly of the concentration of the molar fraction (Xj) in Eq. (1), that for this study is extremely low. There is no consensus in the literature on how to assess the energy gain in two-stage anaerobic processes. Some authors proposed to perform such energy-gain evaluations based mainly on the produced biogas (Das et al. [53], Xie et al. [31], Si et al. [54], Kumari et al. [55], and Fuess et al. [56]); however, in most of these proposals, the common denominator is LHV. In this regard, the main contribution of our study is the demonstration of how the LHV influences energy efficiency. Sanctis et al. [51], indicate that the low EE values found in studies where AD is used, are mainly due to the discontinuity in biogas production and also the indirect measurement of biogas in the system. That is, to determine the biogas concentration, the offline chromatographic method is commonly used, which does not allow observing the real continuous flow of gas fractions. Sekoai et al. [57], identified the measurement of biogas as one of the opportunities for improvement to know the feasibility of increasing energy efficiency, as well as the recovery of by-products mainly in two-phase anaerobic processes. These authors recommend that it is better to take the biogas sample online because it would allow estimating the kinetics of the process. However, Zhang et al. [58], state that obtaining energy efficiency from hydrogen is more complicated, because hydrogen gas has a higher calorific value, therefore it offers less energy per volume."
12,Conclusions,"The performance of the two-stage AD of beverage industry wastewater was limited notably by the fluctuations of the organic matter in the raw wastewater, which is a typical situation in this industry, which indicates the need to incorporate a wastewater homogenization unit before the biological treatment system; additionally, the two-stage AD process alone is not sufficient to reduce the COD from the beverage industry. Concerning the stability of the AD process, the FOS/TAC and IA/PA ratios have shown to be a powerful measure to understand the equilibrium of the carbonate system, even more than the value of the pH. Furthermore, it is noted that the calculation of energy efficiency depends on the adjustment of the LHV value, and this is directly related to the molar fraction in particular of hydrogen present in the biogas. Nevertheless, it is necessary to perform more studies not only to improve the stability at each stage of the biological process, but also to evaluate its influence on energy efficiency or gain. Finally, for future research, it is important to include our proposal related to the adjustment of the Lower Heating Value to evaluate the real gain energy."
