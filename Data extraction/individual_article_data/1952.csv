0,Introduction,"There is a great potential for microalgae and cyanobacteria species for applications as utilizing whole biomass or extracts in human nutrition and pharmaceutical area because of having antimicrobial, antiviral, antiinflammatory and antiallergic compounds. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are rich in several bioactive compounds such as PUFA, sterols, proteins, enzymes, vitamins and pigments (De Jesus Raposo et al., 2013; Karakaş et al., 2019). Many microalgae species are commercially produced to obtain EPA and DHA which are recommended for living a healthy life due to reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. Carotenoids and phycobiliproteins which are major pigments in microalgae, also provide several beneficial biological activities, such as antioxidant, anticarcinogen, antiinflammatory, antiobesity, anti-angiogenic and neuroprotective activities. Today, these bioactive compounds are mainly used as dietary supplements or utilized for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products (Jha et al., 2017; Vaz et al., 2016). Although, there have been an increased number of studies presenting novel bioactive compounds produced by microalgae, those indicate a relatively untapped source of biologically active compounds (de Vera et al., 2018). The main challenge is to optimize the process and be able to present these bioactive compounds to the costumers without the loss of their properties. Direct usage of bioactive compounds and nutraceuticals into the food or pharmaceutical products is not easy. According to the process, these bioactives may show low solubility and also cause defects in the quality of the products such as negative effects on color, texture, flavor and appearance. In addition to that, they can lose their properties during processing and storage or degrade because of unfavorable environmental conditions like oxygen, light and temperature (Ezhilarasi et al., 2013; Mohammadian et al., 2020). Electrospinning is a “top-down” electrohydrodynamic process which can be performed as electrospinning, electrospraying and e-jetting, has gain an interest in the fields of food and drug science, manufacturing for encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds (Karimi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018). As an alternative to the traditional encapsulation methods, electrospraying has come into prominence due to carrying out high-efficiency encapsulation in a one-step process without the need for subsequent drying and separation steps to remove particle from solvent (Karimi et al., 2020; Schmatz et al., 2020). Electrospinning/electrospraying is a fast, cost-effective, reliable and practical method in which a series of fibers/particles with micro- and nano-diameters are produced (Huang et al., 1982; Vaddadi and Horrobin, 1979). The basis of this method is based on the production of micro or nano-sized fibers or particles of very small diameter size by means of electrostatic force from a needle connected to the voltage source. The solution consisting of materials to form nanostructures is fed to the needle by a syringe and the flow rate is controlled by a pump. The morphology and diameter of the formed structures, vary by many parameters depending on the flow rate, viscosity of the solution and the applied voltage and pulse distance (Horrobin, 1981). The production of a smaller droplet size with a narrow distribution which can be controlled through adjusting the process parameters, such as feed rate, electric potential, and capillary diameter, can be achieved with electrospraying (Schmatz et al., 2020). Although, single-fluid electrospraying process is a simple and fundamental method to produce fine particles, in order to improve the process, different approaches are still investigated such as coaxial and multi-axial electrospraying. In addition to that, materials used in this process like polymers, lipids, surfactants for modifying solution properties are one of the most investigated topics for enhancing the efficiency of the process (Karimi et al., 2020). Polymers and lipids are pharmaceutical excipients, used to manipulate drug release behavior and to enhance transmembrane properties for the effective absorbance of drug molecules, respectively. Utilization of their combination for drug delivery emerges as novel medicated materials in engineering (Kang et al., 2021). Due to the low hydrophilicity of synthetic polymers, natural polymers have been utilized in nanotechnological process for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. Better biocompatibility and low immunogenicity and antibacterial property are provided with natural polymers. Alginate is one of the natural biopolymers which consist of anionic polysaccharides isolated from brown marine algae, and can be used as carriers and building block for drugs and bioactive food ingredients (Arthanari et al., 2016; Hu and McClements, 2015). However, because of its high rigidity and fragility, alginate is usually used as a co-polymer, and is blended with a compatible flexible vinyl polymer like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Arthanari et al., 2016; Çaykara and Demirci, 2006). PVA is a hydrophilic polymer which has good chemical and thermal stability. It has semicrystalline structure. Since it is hydrophilic, it can be processed easily and has high water permeability. Besides, it is a water soluble polymer that readily reacts with different crosslinking agents to form a gel. Physical gels can be formed with PVA solutions with various types of solvents. In addition to these properties, PVA is biocompatible and nontoxic. For this reason, it can be utilized in many different areas such as medical, cosmetic, food, pharmaceutical and packing industries (Qin and Wang, 2006; Safi et al., 2007). In the literature, there are studies using microalgae – mostly Spirulina sp. – as biopolymer for electrospun fibers or component that encapsulated in fibers such as silk fibroin, chitosan, polycaprolactone and polyethylene oxide (de Morais et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Kuntzler et al., 2018; Moreira et al., 2019; Verdugo et al., 2014). When these studies are examined, it can be seen that, studies are mainly focused on encapsulating microalgal biomass in polymeric nanofibers. Besides investigation of their stability, antimicrobial or antioxidant activities is limited. In this study, firstly, Botryococcus braunii microalgae and Microcystis aeruginosa cyanobacteria were cultivated. B. braunii is a green microalgae which have a high lipid content and synthesizes sterol, triacetylglycerol and fatty acids. Apart from hydrocarbons, B. braunii produces bioactive molecules such as exopolysaccharides and carotenoids (Banerjee et al., 2002). M. aeruginosa is a cyanobacteria that can produce neurotoxin substances such as microcystin. However, its extracts contain bioactive substances with antimicrobial, antifungal, cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties (Jaiswal et al., 2008). These two species have a great potential to be utilized in food and pharmaceutical industry. Both of these species have antibacterial activity and show cytotoxic effect on SHSY-5Y, then PC-3 and AGS cell lines (İnan et al., 2021; İnan and Özçimen, 2021). After cultivation, these species were extracted, and then their oils were electrosprayed with PVA/alginate polymers to produce nanoparticles. During nanoparticle production, electrospraying process parameters were also evaluated statistically. Nanoparticles were characterized with their structural, morphological and thermal properties, and their antibacterial effects were presented."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microalgae and cyanobacteria cultivation,"2.1 Microalgae and cyanobacteria cultivation In this study, B. braunii and M. aeruginosa were cultivated in the Algal Biotechnology and Bioprocess Laboratory at Department of Bioengineering, Yildiz Technical University. Cultures were grown in BG-11 medium at the temperature of 25 °C ± 1 °C with continuous stirring and illumination. After cultivation, cultures were centrifuged for 15 min at 8000 rpm and dried at the temperature of 60 °C in an oven for an overnight. The dried samples were extracted with ethanol via soxhlet extractor, and then stored in an air-tight amber vials (Halim et al., 2011). In our previous study, extracted oils were analyzed with gas chromatography. When the chromatograms are examined, presence of palmitic, oleic, linoleic, arachidic acid and eicosapentaenoic acids were determined in the content of B. braunii oil. Other fatty acids were present in trace amounts. According to the chromatogram obtained, the highest fatty acid content was belong to linoleic acid. B. braunii was found to be rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids with bioactive value. In the case of M. aeruginosa, palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid fatty acids were determined. The highest fatty acid content was belong to palmitic acid. According to these analyzes, B. braunii and M. aeruginosa were found to have bioactive value and were rich in useful polyunsaturated fatty acids (İnan et al., 2021)."
3,Nanoparticle production,"2.2 Nanoparticle production In this step, PVA and sodium alginate were used for the production of nanoparticles loaded with microalgal oil extracts. These materials are biocompatible, biodegradable and have no pollution effect on environment. Also, PVA can interact with alginate through hydrogen bonding on a molecular level and can conveniently be electrospun from an aqueous medium (Safi et al., 2007). In this study, the effect of different concentrations of PVA, the rate of discharge of the mixture from the syringe and the distance between the syringe and the collecting plate on the size of the nanoparticle diameter in the electrospraying process were investigated. In this context, PVA solutions were dissolved in distilled water and prepared to be the concentrations of 7%, 7.5% and 8% (w/v) at the temperature of 90 °C with stirring in a heated magnetic stirrer until it completely dissolves. The alginate solution was prepared by stirring in 2% (w/v) distilled water. After the solutions were cooled, PVA solution was added to alginate solution as to be final concentration of 80:20 (v/v). Subsequently, 1% (w/v) of algae extract and 1% (w/v) Tween 20 were added and mixed for a further 15 min to obtain a completely homogeneous solution, which was then fed into the electrospraying equipment (Laboratory scale Holmarc Opto Mechatronics Pvt. Ltd. Nano Fiber Electrospinning Unit model no: HO-NFES-0434). In the electrospraying step, first, the collecting plate was covered with aluminum foil and the negative electrode was attached to the plate. The solution which was filled into the injector, was placed on the pump and the other end of the electrode was attached to the metal syringe tip. In this way, an electrical gravitational field was formed with opposite charged electrodes. Process was carried out at room temperature and spraying voltage was between 18−19 kV. The parameters affecting the particle size such as PVA concentration, flow rate and distance between syringe and collector plate for nanoparticle production by electrospraying method were statistically analyzed using Box-Behnken experimental design (Design Expert 11). Experimental parameters and levels are given as follows: X1: PVA polymer concentration: 8% (Upper level), 7.5% (Center level), 7% (Lower level) X2: Flow rate (ml/h): 0.3 (Upper level), 0.25 (Central level), 0.2 (Lower level) X3: Distance (cm): 14 (Upper level), 13 (Central level), 12 (Lower level) Value of these parameters were chosen according to the literature studies which have already investigated similar conditions and suggested for efficient nanoparticle production."
4,Characterization of nanoparticles,"2.3 Characterization of nanoparticles 2.3.1 DLS analysis of the nanoparticles Particle size of the microalgal extract loaded nanoparticles were measured by using a zetasizer device (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument). Determined nanoparticle sizes were used as response for investigating the effect of process parameters. 2.3.2 FTIR analysis of the nanoparticles In order to determine whether the encapsulation process was performed, Thermoscientific Brand Nicolet 6700 model FTIR device was used and the absorbance values of the functional groups in the range of 600−4000 cm−1 were determined. 2.3.3 Thermal analysis of the nanoparticles Thermogravimetric analysis of raw materials was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instrument, SDT Q600). Analysis was carried out up to temperature of 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/min. 2.3.4 XRD analysis of the nanoparticles Nanoparticles were scanned at room temperature with X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) using a copper-K α radiation source (k = 1.54 A˚) at a scanning rate of 1 °C/min. The angle of diffraction was varied from 10° to 50° 2θ. 2.3.5 Morphology of the nanoparticles Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements of the nanoparticles obtained by electrospraying method were taken with Zeiss EVO LS 10 SEM device in YTU Central Laboratory at 20–50.00 kX magnification. 2.3.6 Encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release profile of nanoparticles 0.2 mg of the particle was weighed and 4 ml of chloroform is added. Samples were hold for 5−6 h at 40 °C in water bath and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm and supernatant were measured at 270 nm with UV Spectrophotometer. A calibration curve was obtained with the absorbance of oil samples prepared at different concentrations, and then the encapsulation efficiency of the particles was determined by using according to the following equation. (1) E E % = W a m o u n t o f o i l - W a m o u n t o f f r e e o i l W a m o u n t o f o i l × 100 The release profile was analyzed with Sudan Red G dye. Release medium was prepared with Tween 20 (w/v) in double-distilled water. About 5 ml release medium and 25 mg of particles were stirred at 100 rpm in a flask at 25 °C. At selected time intervals, the discharge medium was collected and centrifuged at a speed of 5000 rpm for 15 min. The concentration of dye within the supernatant was determined by using the UV spectrophotometer at 501 nm and at specific time intervals between 0.5 h–72 h (Gao et al., 2016; Karakaş et al., 2019; Karakaş and Özçimen, 2020). 2.3.7 Antibacterial activity of microalgal oil and microalgal oil loaded nanoparticles Antibacterial activity test of microalgal oil and nanoparticles were carried out using disc diffusion method. For the determination of the antibacterial activity test by disc diffusion method, pathogenic bacteria strains Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and L. monocytogenes ATCC 13932 were used. Firstly, bacteria species were grown in the nutrient broth at 37 °C for 24 h and then, plated using a sterile swab on to petri dishes. Microalgae oil and nanoparticles were prepared at the concentration of 2% (v/v) and 0.1% (w/v) with DMSO, respectively. An antimicrobial disc (6 mm in diameter) impregnated with the 20 μl volume of samples was placed on an agar plate, and the samples diffused from the disc into the agar where bacteria were grown. Petri dishes were inoculated with a standardized suspension of bacteria and incubated for 24 h at the temperature of 37 °C. Negative controls were prepared by using DMSO. After the incubation period of bacteria with antimicrobial disk impregnated with samples, the growth inhibition zones around the discs were measured. Data were presented as means with ± standard deviations (Orellano et al., 2019; Pradhan et al., 2012). 2.3.8 Stability to environmental conditions and storage In order to evaluate the stability of the nanoparticles, the change in the size of the nanoparticles was investigated under different environmental conditions. In this context, effect of temperature and time on the particle size were determined. Particle size was measured again by using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument after one month of storage at 4 °C and room temperature. Also, the total antioxidant activities of the microalgae and cyanobacteria oil and nanoparticles were determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) free radical scavenging method (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). In this method, firstly, oil and nanoparticle samples were dissolved in methanol at the concentration of 1% w/v. After that, oil and nanoparticle in methanol (0.1 ml) was added to 3.9 mL of a 6 × 10−5 mol/L methanol DPPH solution and absorbance at 515 nm was determined after 30 min. The DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula: (2) DPPH Radical Removal Activity (%) = [(A0 − A1)/A0] × 100 A0: Absorbance value of the control A1: Absorbance value of sample or standard In order to see whether nanoparticle structure protect the microalgae oil or not, DPPH-scavenging activity of free and encapsulated microalgal oil was investigated at the end of the process and after exposure to sunlight for 9 h for a day. The experiment was carried out for three times and data were presented as means. 2.3.9 Statistical analysis All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Also, experiments were statistically analyzed using Box-Behnken experimental design (Design Expert 11). The group means were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Evaluation of the nanoparticle production,"3.1 Evaluation of the nanoparticle production In this study, effect of three parameters (PVA polymer concentration, flow rate and distance) on the size of nanoparticle were investigated. Results of B. braunii (BBN) and M. aeruginosa (MAN) oil loaded nanoparticle production were given in Table 1 . The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used to examine the design matrix and to understand the main effects of experimental variables on nanoparticle size. A statistical method is required to control the adequacy and accuracy of the fitted models and to analyze the data. In addition to this, statistical method tests the difference between means by comparing the variances of a group and between groups. ANOVA parameters of the model equation were given in Table 2 . Design Expert 11 statistical software was used to compute the ANOVA parameters for the model equation. Using the data from Table 1, regression equations that given as Eqs. (3) and (4), were created to model the process. (3) YMAN = 255.30 − 73.57 X1 + 10.35 X2 − 10.10 X3 + 10.67 X1X2 − 32.58 X1X3 − 21.82 X2X3 (4) YBBN = 324.80 − 76.13 X1 + 20.26 X2 − 4.96 X3 + 14.40 X1X2 − 23.00 X1X3 − 35.57 X2X3 In regression equations, the parameter which coefficient is the highest, is the parameter that affect the response (Y) of the model most than the others. If the coefficient is positive, then, the parameter affect the response proportionally. On the other hand, if the coefficient is negative, the parameter affects the response inversely. When the Eqs. (3) and (4) were examined, it was seen that the parameter which has the most effect on particle size (YMAN and YBBN) was PVA polymer concentration (X1). However, it was found that the polymer concentration is inversely proportional to the particle size, so, as the polymer concentration increases, the particle size decreases. In addition to the polymer concentration, the distance (X3) between the syringe and the collector plate was found to adversely affect the particle size. As expected, distance has a direct effect on jet flight time and electrostatic field intensity. The effect of the flow rate (X2) was directly proportional to the particle size. It was observed that, as the flow rate increases, the particle size increases. According to the results of the statistical analysis, obtaining nanoparticles with small size can be related to various parameters. The electrical conductivity of a solution reflects the charge density on a jet, which affects the elongation level of the jet by an electric force. Therefore, under the same applied tension and spinning distance, a solution with a higher electrical conductivity results in jet formation with higher elongation along its axis and thus smaller diameter fiber or nanoparticle formation (Bock et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2005). Besides, insufficient drying of the fiber or nanoparticle is associated with insufficient distance between the needle tip and the collector. Increasing the distance results in longer flight times and solvent evaporation times, which tend to reduce bead formation and average diameter (Ghorani and Tucker, 2015). Low flow rates provide more time for solvent evaporation, so bead formation can be reduced. It has also been observed that the average size in the fibers and nanoparticles increases as the polymer flow rate increases (Zong et al., 2002). In this study, investigated parameters have a significant impact on the particle size. In addition to these effects, the interactive effects of the parameters were found to be quite high. Although increasing PVA concentration decreased the particle size, the interactive effect of PVA concentration and flow rate was found to be directly proportional to particle size. On the other hand, the interactive effects of other experimental parameters were inversely proportional to particle size and higher than the individual effect of flow rate and distance between syringe and collector plate. Similarly, in the study of Soo et al., synergetic effect of flow rate and distance is higher than their individual effect on nanofiber diameter. Increasing the flow rate further causes feeding more solution and leads to ejecting of solution drops. These drops break the jet continuously and lead production of nanofibers with small diameter size (Soo et al., 2019). Although, controlling the parameter is investigated with ANOVA by using data obtained as a result of repeated experiments, electrospraying is a complicated process which can be affected from various ratios of different parameters that can show synergetic effects. A very low probability value indicates a very high success for the regression model. The suitability of the model was checked by the coefficient of determination (R2). The R value should be close to 1 to see a better correlation between the experiment and the predicted values (Gülyurt et al., 2016). The correlation coefficient R2 = 0.97 and R2 = 0.96 found in the study shows that only about 3% and 4% of the total variation is not explained by the model for MAN and BBN, respectively. The results were found to be consistent with literature studies (Eghbalifam et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016; Islam and Karim, 2010; Lee et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014). Alginate is a non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymer which can form a gel easily. In order to improve the healing process or provide the bioactive compounds to the target place, alginate is used as a carrier polymer. Although alginate is biocompatible and good water absorptivity, it is difficult to produce alginate nanofibers by electrospinning. Since the gelation of alginate solution starts at very low concentrations, alginate solutions are needed to be mixed with a co-polymer and surfactants, and/or chemically modified by crosslinking (Najafiasl et al., 2020). PVA is a carrier polymer used for electrospinning alginate due to the hydroxyl groups which are exposed in chemical structure and the possibility of hydrogen bonding formation with hydroxyl groups in the structure of alginate (Taemeh et al., 2020). Due to its biocompatibility with body organs, PVA is used in many biomedical applications such as artificial blood vessels, artificial intestines, contact lenses and drug-delivery system. Moreover, blending PVA with biopolymers such as alginate helps to achieve desirable physical properties like changing viscosity and improving the electrospinnability of alginate solutions and mechanical strength of the nano-sized product (Eghbalifam et al., 2015). Combined usage of polymers allows us to design novel dosage forms and enables the production of controlled release drug delivery systems extending the applications of those pharmaceutical excipients (Siepmann et al., 2019). According to the Bialik-Was et al., PVA and alginate combination provides features which the ideal third-generation biomaterials should have. Moreover, new approaches have been investigated to design hybrid materials like using medicinal substances of natural origin, mainly extracted from plants (Bialik-Wąs et al., 2021). As known, microalgae produce various biologically active primary and secondary metabolites such as polysaccharides, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids and phenolic compounds which have therapeutic pharmacological activities (Mishra et al., 2021). Therefore, using microalgal biomass or extracts with different polymers for pharmaceutical applications comes into prominence. In the literature, Singh et al. studied for preparation of a novel water soluble “Solid Self Nano-Emulsifying Drug Delivery System (S-SNEDDS)” using microalgae oil and different hydrophilic carrier materials such as lactose, mannitol, maltodextrin, β-CD, dextrin and soluble starch and HPMC to improve stability, bioavailability and therapeutics via spray drying technology. It was reported that the product has no cytotoxic effect and no change transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability of Caco-2 cells. Also their in-vivo studies showed that treatment of Melamine induced cognitive impairment using S-SNEDDS was found to increase the effect of DHA (Singh et al., 2019). De Melo et al. investigated the wound healing activity of a hydrogel-based Chlorella vulgaris extract on excisional wounds in mice. It was reported that the results which showed a higher presence of collagen deposition, a decrease of fibroblast and inflammatory cells and strong evidence of skin appendages, were promising to be utilized in pharmaceutical applications (de Melo et al., 2019). Li et al. synthesized biohybrid algae using SiO2 via one-step biomimetic silicification method which improve their cytotoxicity effect in the tumor area (Li et al., 2020). Jung et al. evaluated a scaffold production consist of nanofibers which were electrospun using extract of Spirulina and PCL as polymer. It was reported that, the microalgal extract embedded in scaffold positively affect viability and proliferation of mouse fibroblasts which infiltrated through Spirulina nanofibers without showing cytotoxicity (Jung et al., 2013). In comparison with the studies of microalgal biomass or extract loaded nano-fiber or particle production, it was observed that, size of the nanoparticles in the present study was smaller than the others (Kim et al., 2012; Moreira et al., 2019; Verdugo et al., 2014)"
7,FTIR analysis of the nanoparticles,"3.2 FTIR analysis of the nanoparticles As can be seen with FTIR spectrums in Fig. 1 , bands of hydroxyl, ether and carboxylic functional groups were observed. At 3283 cm−1, the −OH tensile band was formed and the bands seen at 2922−2853 cm−1 had CH antisymmetrical and symmetrical stresses. Peaks at 1743 cm−1 and 1159 cm−1 indicate the presence of oil in the samples. At 1021 cm−1 and 831 cm−1 there is CO stress and CH plane deformation. The peak at 1462 cm−1 appeared as asymmetric and symmetrical vibrational stresses of carboxylate salt ions. As can be seen in the spectrum, the peaks of the oil loaded nanoparticles and microalgal/cyanobacterial oil coincided at 2922, 2853, 1743 and 1462 cm−1. Some mild shifts has been observed in the spectra. Due to the interaction of oil with a little amount of ethanol, and electrospraying solution which consist of PVA and alginate, may be the reason of this mild shifts. Therefore, it was observed that, microalgal oil extract was encapsulated in nanoparticle in all concentrations of PVA for both B. braunii and M. aeruginosa. FTIR analysis is one of the methods which is used to observe whether there is an encapsulation. In the literature, overlaps in the peaks were observed in the various studies that used different oils and polymers for encapsulation researches. Moghaddam et al. studied the production of calcium alginate nanocapsules containing n-nonadecane. When the FTIR spectrum of produced nano capsules and oil was examined, overlaps were observed at 2920 and 2850 cm−1, which was similar to the peaks in this study, and showed that n-nonadecane was successfully encapsulated into the capsules (Moghaddam et al., 2015). In another study, the presence of silicone oil in polycaprolactone capsules was observed by FTIR analysis (Gao et al., 2016)."
8,Thermal analysis of the nanoparticles,"3.3 Thermal analysis of the nanoparticles Thermogravimetric analysis help us to observe the thermal degradation mechanism of the samples and determine the amount of moisture and volatile compounds present in nanoparticles, weight loss, and thermal breakdown of the samples (Khan et al., 2017). In this study, thermal analysis results of the samples are given in Fig. 2 . The degradation of the nanoparticles began with a moisture output at about 100 °C. The moisture content of the samples was 5.77% and 4.75%, respectively. The microalgal oil-loaded nanoparticles began to slowly decompose at a temperature above 225 °C. A residue of between 9% and 8% was found for both oil-free particles and oil-loaded nanoparticle. When the TGA curve is examined, it is seen that the nanoparticles are degraded in two steps after the moisture output. First, a weight loss of 61–62% in the temperature range of 225–275 °C, and a weight loss of 18–23% in the temperature range of 275–600 °C occurred in the second step. The decomposition at a temperature of 225–275 °C is due to the thermal degradation of PVA, whereas the degradation at 275−510 °C is due to the by-product formation of PVA."
9,XRD analysis of the nanoparticles,"3.4 XRD analysis of the nanoparticles XRD patterns of electrosprayed PVA/Alg nanoparticles of 7–8% PVA-NaAlg were given in the Fig. 3 . XRD patterns of PVA/alginate nanoparticles presented broad and weak diffraction peaks due to the strong intermolecular and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding between polymer chains. They also showed disappearance of the peaks corresponding to both polymers and formation of one new broad peak at around 2θ = 19.6° demonstrating the interaction between alginate and PVA (Golafshan et al., 2017; Islam and Karim, 2010). Also it can be said that this peak increased with the increasing PVA concentration. Similar XRD patterns and peaks have been observed with the literature studies. Golafshan et al. studied the production of hydrogels consist of laponite:PVA-alginate, and XRD results of the PVA-alginate showed a sharp peak instead of alginate and PVA alone (Golafshan et al., 2017). In another study, different concentrations of PVA and alginate mixtures were electrospun. According to this study, the same peak was observed at about 19.3°, and it was reported that, crystallinity decreased due to the hydrogen-bonding interaction between alginate and PVA macromolecules (Islam and Karim, 2010). Aadil et al. also reported that, XRD spectra of the alginate-PVA nanofibers indicated a crystalline peak at about 19.9° due to the presence of strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding (Aadil et al., 2018)."
10,Morphology of the nanoparticles,"3.5 Morphology of the nanoparticles SEM results of the nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4 . As a result of SEM analysis, it was seen that the produced particles were mostly spherical. Since PVA is an ionic polymer, and high PVA concentrations cause high charge density and generate a very high repulsive force between the ionic groups within the polymer backbone, this force results in exploding the polymer jet into small droplets on the collector (Zhou et al., 2020). Therefore, it was an expected result observing high concentration of spherical nanoparticles rather than nanofibers."
11,Encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release profile of nanoparticles,"3.6 Encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release profile of nanoparticles The encapsulation efficiency value ​​of the nanoparticles were determined for the samples produced by the formulation of 8% PVA concentration. The encapsulation efficiency was found as 64 ± 0.4% and 72 ± 0.5% for BBN and MAN, respectively. Results of the encapsulation efficiency can be different due to the process that is used and characteristics of the encapsulated material. The high retention capacity has been attributed to the dependence of the drug on its solubility in the polymer solution (Arthanari et al., 2016; Kataria et al., 2014). In addition to that, it was stated that, the drug loading process often results in low drug-loading efficiency through physical and electrostatic adsorption, on the other hand, high drug-loading efficiency can be achieved through crystallization and covalent and coordinate bonds (Shen et al., 2017). Considering this, changes in encapsulation yields and partially low efficiency were observed depending on the ratio of microalgal oil mixed with alginate/PVA solution. However, the efficiency values ​​determined in this study are still high; this shows that electrospraying is very efficient. In the release test with Sudan Red G dye, it was seen that algal oil extract in the BBN and MAN was started to release in the first 24 h. In the first 24 h, the release of algae oil in the nanoparticles occurred in a linear decrease. In this duration, there was a controlled release and the absorbance of the samples started to decrease from 1.2 to 0.72 during this release process. After 24 h, release amount was decreased to 0.54 at the 72th h. It can be reported that controlled release of the material could be achieved with this stabilized release level and duration."
12,Antibacterial activity of microalgal oil and microalgal oil loaded nanoparticles,"3.7 Antibacterial activity of microalgal oil and microalgal oil loaded nanoparticles The results of the antibacterial activity test of microalgal oil and microalgal oil loaded nanoparticles were given in the Fig. 5 . After 24 h of incubation, it was observed that the oil of microalgae and cyanobacteria showed antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. The strongest antibacterial activity was determined against E. coli ATCC 8739, with the inhibition zone of 20.00 ± 0.30 and 25.00 ± 0.20 mm for BB oil and MA oil, respectively. As for the nanoparticles, lesser activity was observed due to the stability of the nanoparticle structure and nanoparticles perform a gradual release which this result was consistent with the stability tests. The results obtained from antibacterial activity test were in agreement with the literature (Madhumathi et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2010)."
13,Stability to environmental conditions and storage,"3.8 Stability to environmental conditions and storage Since the conditions of using the nanoparticles and storage time play a crucial role in the stability, it is important to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on particle size. Nanoparticles produced under the conditions of 8% PVA solution, flow rate of 0.2 ml/h and 13 cm collector distance, were used in this analysis. To be able to recommend a product for commercial applications, products must have an acceptable shelf life. Therefore, size of nanoparticles at the temperature of 4 °C and 25 °C for a month, were investigated. It can be reported that, there was not any significant change in the size of nanoparticles stored in refrigerator and room conditions. Microalgal and cyanobacterial oil extracts contain bioactive compounds which have antioxidant activity. In this study, DPPH-scavenging activity of free and encapsulated oil was investigated at the end of the process and after exposure to sunlight for 9 h for a day. While the antioxidant activities of BB and MA were 47% and 44%, BBN and MAN were 38% and 37%, respectively. After sunlight exposure to first 9 h, while scavenging activity of free oil decreased to 21−20%, nanoparticle samples decreased to 32−30%."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, fabrication of nanoparticle which was loaded with microalgal oil via electrospraying process was carried out and the parameters that affect the particle size were evaluated. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: • It is seen that the most effective parameter which affect the nanoparticle size is the PVA concentration. Increase of PVA concentration decreased the particle diameter. The optimum concentration for the desired particle size was obtained under the conditions of PVA concentration of 8%, 0.2 ml/h flow rate and collector distance of 13 cm. • The characterization tests showed that the encapsulation process was performed successfully by presenting the peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm−1 which overlapped in FTIR spectra and physical state of components used in the structure of nanoparticle that showed in XRD patterns. Thermal analysis presented the thermal degradation of the nanoparticles which consist of two steps after the moisture output. SEM results demonstrated that the particles were mostly spherical which indicated that there was no nanofiber formation. • The encapsulation efficiency was found as between 64 and 72% which can be commented as acceptable due to the partial solubility of the microalgal oil in the polymer solution. • DPPH analysis and storage tests showed that the developed nanoparticle structure can protect the bioactive properties of microalgal oil and the antioxidant activity was maintained. • At last, antibacterial activity test indicated the stability of the nanoparticle structure and gradual release of bioactive compound because nanoparticles presented lesser antibacterial activity than microalgal oil extracts. According to these results, it can be commented that fabricated microalgal oil loaded alginate/PVA electrosprayed nanoparticles have great potential to be used in pharmaceutical industry. For future studies, antibacterial effectiveness of these nanoparticles can be improved with metallic nanoparticles that can be synthesized from microalgal biomass via green synthesis."
