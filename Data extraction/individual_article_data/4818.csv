0,Introduction,"Recently, hydrogen production by biological conversion process had attracted wide attention (Bartacek et al., 2007; Kaparaju et al., 2009). Many kinds of fermentative microorganisms had been reported for hydrogen production, such as Clostridium sp., Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella sp., etc. (Lee et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2006). In the previous research, the authors had investigated the hydrogen producing capacity of Klebsiella pneumoniae ECU-15 and found that this strain had the highest cell yield and hydrogen production rate compared to the other hydrogen producing strains, therefore, it could be counted as a potential hydrogen producer (Niu et al., 2010). Besides, the fermentative culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the initial concentration of the substrate, were also important for hydrogen production. The effect of different culture conditions on hydrogen fermentation were extensively studied in the reported researches (Lin et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008). However, the influence mechanism of these conditions on hydrogen production was not clear enough. Fermentative routes for hydrogen production were a complex process, by which bacteria use H+ as a final electron acceptor for electrons transfer during oxidation reactions of the organic substrate fermentations (Agapakis and Silver, 2010). Various kinds of hydrogenase were involved in this system, and it could be classified as producing hydrogenase, uptake hydrogenase and bidirectional hydrogenase according to its functions (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). It was reported that there are two hydrogen evolution routes of the anaerobic glucose fermentation by the fermentative anaerobes. The one was called formate pathway, which was operated by the formate hydrogen lyase complex, and formic acid could be split into CO2 and H2 by these enzymes (Kim et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2009). Formate hydrogen lyase activity has been found in various bacteria, such as Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and many other coli-aerogenes bacteria (Axley et al., 1990; Lu et al., 2009; Steuber et al., 1999). The other was called NADH pathway, hydrogen could be produced by the reoxidation of NADH in this pathway, and the hydrogen production by E. aerogenes, a typical enterobacteriaceae bacterium, was reported to be highly dependent on this pathway (Zhang et al., 2009). Except for the producing hydrogenases, there were also some uptake hydrogenase which physiologically function as consumption of hydrogen located on the bacterial membrane (Vignais and Toussaint, 1994). Besides, bidirectional hydrogenase also existed in the formate hydrogen lyase complex, which could also cleave H2 into H+ under certain culture conditions (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). It had been reported several examples of metabolic engineering applications to increase the fermentative hydrogen production, in which knocking out the genes encoding uptake hydrogenase was one way to enhance the hydrogen production (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). Zhao et al. knocked out the uptake hydrogenase genes in E. aerogenes, and found that the hydrogen production yield of the mutant was improved from 0.65mol/mol glucose to 0.78mol/mol glucose (Zhao et al., 2009). Redwood et al. indicated that the deletion of the two uptake hydrogenases in E. coli strains FTD67 and FTD89 improved the hydrogen production by 50% (Redwood et al., 2008). Therefore, how much hydrogen would be consumed during the fermentation process by the uptake hydrogenase should be clarified and quantified. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a tool for calculating intracellular fluxes from extracellular fluxes, which would be helpful for the understanding of cell physiology and regulation of the flux. MFA has been applied in the fermentation process of some organic acid, amino acid, polysaccharide, and antibiotics, etc. (Çalik et al., 2000; Desai et al., 1999; Sánchez et al., 2006; Venkatesh, 1997), but few in the dark fermentation of hydrogen production. MFA was firstly imported in the hydrogen fermentation of E. coli by (Manish et al., 2007). Using this technology, the theoretical capability for hydrogen production of this microorganism was analyzed. In addition, MFA was also used to determine the feasible operating space for hydrogen production against the varying of the other metabolites, and found that the production of ethanol and acetate was necessary for hydrogen production, while the production of succinate and lactate was not necessary. Oh et al. investigated the metabolic flux of the hydrogen production by Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19, and revealed that the hydrogen was exclusively produced from the formate pathway and the hydrogen yield of Y19 was 2mol/mol glucose (Oh et al., 2008). MFA also indicated that a high hydrogen yield of 8.7mol/mol glucose was possible if glucose metabolism was directed to the pentose phosphate pathway (PP pathway) and NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase was utilized to produce hydrogen. Then the metabolically engineered E. coli strains which were developed and characterized by batch experiments and MFA were used to improve the hydrogen production rate and yield by (Kim et al., 2009). The results of MFA revealed that deletion of lactate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase directed most of the carbons from glucose to the glycolytic pathway which leading to hydrogen production by formate hydrogen lyase, not to the pentose phosphate pathway. Cai et al. investigated the effect of pH and glucose concentrations on hydrogen production by MFA (Cai et al., 2010). They constructed a metabolic flux model of Clostridium butyricum W5 to evaluate the metabolic flux distribution in the fermentative hydrogen production network at different culture conditions, and found that pH had a more significant effect on the metabolic flux distribution than that of the initial glucose concentration. Furthermore, MFA assessed the rigidity of the acetyl-COA node in hydrogen biosynthesis network, which was important for the further design of metabolic engineering strategy for improving hydrogen production. The above studies suggested that MFA was a powerful tool to analyze the capabilities of different microorganisms for hydrogen production and to assist in the process optimization. However, in the former studies, the uptake hydrogen flux was overlooked in the metabolic flux model, which might be result in the errors of the calculation results. In this work, the metabolic network of K. pneumoniae ECU-15 involving the producing and uptake hydrogen pathways under the anaerobic conditions was constructed. The possible hydrogen producing mechanisms of this microorganism was explored by the MFA method. The effects of temperature, pH and initial glucose concentration on the intracellular fluxes, especially for the producing and uptake hydrogen fluxes were investigated, which was helpful to deeply understand the effect of these culture conditions on hydrogen production and how to develop molecular and engineering strategies for optimizing the hydrogen production."
1,Metabolic flux models,
2,Theory of MFA,"2.1 Theory of MFA MFA was a modeling tool which was based entirely upon the stoichiometry of the reactions in the cell. The metabolic network was consisted of enzymatic reactions that facilitate the conversion of intracellular metabolism and exchange of metabolites with the extracellular environment. The transient behavior of these processes could be quantitatively described by formulating a dynamic mass balance over each intracellular metabolite pool. Thus the following equations were generated, which was used to describe the transient behavior of every metabolite (Schilling et al., 2000): (1) dX i dt = ∑ j S ij V j Where, vj corresponded to the jth flux in the system; Sij stood for the number of moles of metabolite i that produced or consumed in reaction j; Xi meant the concentration of the metabolite. At steady state, the concentration of metabolites in the network was constant and the equation above could be reduced to a set of linear homogeneous equation, which was written in matrix notation as: (2) S · ν = 0 Where, S was a matrix of stoichiometric coefficients, v was a vector of intracellular metabolite fluxes. Eq. (2) described a set of steady state metabolite balances that were simply linear combinations of the reaction rates."
3,Metabolic network of K. pneumoniae ECU-15,"2.2 Metabolic network of K. pneumoniae ECU-15 K. pneumoniae ECU-15 (ECU-15), a facultative anaerobic bacterium isolated from anaerobic sewage sludge, was used in this study. The metabolic network of ECU-15 under anaerobic glucose fermentation was shown in Fig. 1 , and it was constructed based on the KEGG metabolic pathway database and the other publications (Manish et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). The abbreviation of the metabolites and related metabolic reactions were listed in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. In addition, the hydrogen production during the anaerobic fermentation included the producing and uptake hydrogen pathways. The former could be easily expressed as the formate and NADH pathway, while the representation of the later in the metabolic network was difficult. Therefore, in this network the uptake hydrogen flux was calculated by the following formula: (3) H 2 ( U ) = H 2 - H 2 ( E ) Where, H2(U) stood for the uptake flux of hydrogen; H2 was the total producing hydrogen flux calculated by the above two pathways; H2(E) was the hydrogen production flux gained from experiment."
4,Solution of the MFA models,"2.3 Solution of the MFA models A metabolic matrix which contained 30 metabolic reactions and 24 intracellular metabolites was constructed based on Fig. 1, and the freedom degree of this model was 6. In this experiment, the specific rates for uptake glucose (r 1) and for the production of lactic acid, 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, ethanol, formic acid and cell growth (r 17, r 19, r 23, r 24, r 27, r 28) could be measured (Niu et al., 2010). Therefore, the overdetermined system could be solved by the least square method using the program package Matlab 7.0. All the flux distributions were normalized by the glucose uptake rate on a basis of 100mmol/(gcellh) and expressed as percentage."
5,Culture conditions and analytical methods,"2.4 Culture conditions and analytical methods Batch fermentation experiments were done in a 1L flask (working volume 600ml, stirred by a magnetic impeller at 150rpm). The reactor was sealed by a rubber stopper after the inoculation and flushed with N2 for half an hour to form the anaerobic condition. The biogas was collected by a gasbag with its volume measured by the water displacement method and calculated under the standard condition. Liquid metabolite was sampled for every 2h. The gaseous products (mainly H2 and CO2) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC 900C, Shanghai Tianpu Analysis Equipment CO. LTD, Shanghai, PR China) with Porapak-Q column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The temperature of oven, injector and detector were 80, 100 and 100°C, respectively. Ar gas was used as the carrier gas at 30ml/min. The concentration of organic acid (mainly formic acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid), ethanol, 2,3-butanediol, xylose and cellobiose were analyzed by HPLC (SHIMADZU 10A, Shimadzu International Treading CO. LTD, Japan) with the column of Aminex HPX-87H. The temperature of the column was 65°C, themobile phase of H2SO4 (5mmol/L) was kept at 0.6ml/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of temperature on the metabolic flux distributions,"3.1 Effect of temperature on the metabolic flux distributions Fig. 2 showed the metabolic flux distributions of ECU-15 at the temperature range of 26–37°C. It was indicated that the carbon distributions to cell mass at different temperature were all about 2%. The metabolic flux to acetic acid and lactic acid did not change significantly with the varied temperature, and they were 11–13% and 10–14%, respectively. Thus it could be concluded that the temperature may have little influence on the activity of acetate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The maximum flux distribution to 2,3-butanediol of 69% was gained at 34°C. However, the flux to ethanol was decreased from 81% to 68% with the increasing temperature, which indicated that higher temperature was unfavorable for the alcohol dehydrogenase. The intermediate metabolite G6P was a key node in this network, and the carbon flux was divided into two ways at this node: the EMP pathway and the PP pathway. It showed that the carbon flux ratio of r 2/r 11 (EMP/PP) was decreased from 5 to 3.6 with the increasing temperature, which indicated that 37°C was suitable for the carbon flux to the PP pathway. In addition, the flux ratio of r 24/r 23 (ethanol/acetic acid) at the node of ACCOA also reduced with the temperature. It was known that the production of ethanol would consume the coenzyme NADH, while ATP could be produced with the generation of acetic acid, hence lower ethanol/acetic acid was in favor of the biohydrogen production, which means that hydrogen was mainly produced in the acid-forming, not in the alcohols production metabolism (Lay, 2000). From the producing hydrogen flux in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the flux of formate pathway changed a little with the varied temperature, and they were all about 80%. The final calculated producing hydrogen flux in this pathway might be the result of interactions between different functional hydrogenases. In the NADH pathway, producing hydrogen flux increased significantly from 2% to 13%. Meanwhile, Table 3 (H2(r 29)/H2) showed that the NADH pathway occupied an increasing percentage of the total producing hydrogen flux with the increasing temperature, where H2(r 29) meant the hydrogen producing flux from NADH pathway. Table 4 further summarized the distribution of NADH production and consumption at different temperature. In the metabolic pathway of ECU-15, NADH was mainly produced by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase during the glycolysis pathway, and consumed in the generation of lactic acid (r 17), 2,3-butanudiol (r 19), ethanol (r 24) and hydrogen (r 29). The results in Table 4 indicated that the production rate of NADH was increased with the temperature, while the consumed NADH in r 17 and r 19 had no significant change. In contrary, the amount of the consumed NADH in the ethanol production pathway decreased with the temperature, and thus more NADH could be used to produce hydrogen at higher temperature. In order to find out the effect of temperature on the activity of uptake hydrogenase, the uptake flux of hydrogen was calculated (see Table 3). It revealed that the sum of the two producing hydrogen flux (H2) showed an identical variation trend with the experimental results (H2(E)), and they both increased with the temperature. However, the uptake flux of hydrogen (H2(U)) was reduced, and the consumed hydrogen rate (H2(U)/H2) was also declined from 27.34% to 13.92% with the temperature. It was demonstrated that the activity of the uptake hydrogenase could be inhibited by the higher temperature. It can be concluded that the temperature had little influence on the producing hydrogen pathway from formic acid, but the uptake hydrogen and ethanol producing pathway could be significantly influenced, and higher temperature could reduce the consumption of hydrogen and enhance the hydrogen production from NADH."
8,Effect of pH on the metabolic flux distributions,"3.2 Effect of pH on the metabolic flux distributions The flux distribution of ECU-15 at pH 5.0–7.5 was displayed in Fig. 3 . The flux of cell growth was increased from 2% to 5% with the pH, which indicated that the neutral or weak basic pH was better for the cell growth. The flux to lactic acid was 10% and 8% at pH 5.0 and pH 6.0, respectively. However, it would increase significantly to 25% when the pH increased to 7.5. In contrast, the flux to acetic acid presented a different variation. It was 5% at pH 5.0, but rapidly increased to 25% when the pH was higher than 6.0. The flux to ethanol gained the maximum of 77% at pH 7.5, but 2,3-butanediol gained its maximum flux at pH 6.0. From the producing hydrogen flux in Fig. 3, it could be seen that the flux of pyruvate formate lyase was affected greatly by pH, which was also reported in the other reference (Lee and Rittmann, 2009). It increased at first and then decreased with the increasing pH, and the maximum of 97% was obtained at pH 7.0. Meanwhile, the hydrogen produced by this way also gained the maximum at this pH value, which indicated that pH 7.0 was in favor of hydrogen production from formate pathway. In NADH pathway, the flux increased a little with the pH from 20% to 25%. However, the percentage of this way in the hydrogen production (see H2(r 29)/H2 in Table 5 ) was decreased from 30.25% to 21.34%, which indicated that pH had more significant influence on the formate pathway than NADH pathway. Further study on uptake flux of hydrogen at different pH values was listed in Table 5. It showed that the calculated total producing hydrogen flux (H2) reached the maximum at pH 7.0, but in the experimental results (H2(E)), the maximum was obtained at pH 6.0. The reason for this contradictory result was mainly due to the consumption of hydrogen by the uptake hydrogenase. It could be seen that the uptake flux of hydrogen was lower at the acid pH, but increased greatly with the pH higher than 7.0, and the proportion of uptake hydrogen also increased significantly from 3.59% (pH 6.0) to 26.69% (pH 7.5). In summary, the hydrogen production from the formate pathway and the consumption of hydrogen were both affected by the pH. They both gained the maximum at pH 7.0–7.5. Therefore, the optimal pH of 6.0 in the experiment was resulted from the combined effect of producing hydrogenase and uptake hydrogenase."
9,Effect of initial glucose concentration on the metabolic flux distributions,"3.3 Effect of initial glucose concentration on the metabolic flux distributions Fig. 4 was the flux distributions of ECU-15 at initial glucose of 5–30g/L. At G6P node, the carbon flux of EMP and PP pathways was affected greatly by the initial glucose concentration. When the initial glucose was 5g/L, the flux of EMP pathway was only 52%, but it would increase to about 80% when the initial glucose was higher than 10g/L. Moreover, the fluxes of precursor for cell growth were higher at 5g/L glucose than the other concentrations, which indicated that the initial glucose concentration of 5g/L might be the limiting substrate concentration. With the increasing initial glucose concentration, the carbon flux to ethanol declined from 71% to 64%, while the fluxes to 2,3-butanediol and acetic acid were increased. Thus 2,3-butanediol and acetic acid were likely to be generated at the excess substrate condition. From the producing hydrogen flux in Fig. 4, it could be seen that the formate pathway exhibited the maximum flux at initial glucose of 5g/L, while higher substrate concentration was unfavorable for hydrogen production by this way. One possibility for this result was that carbon flow to the secondary pathway of metabolism, for example, glycogen synthesis, was restricted at low glucose concentration thereby shunting most of the carbon into the producing hydrogen pathway (Bisaillon et al., 2006). Moreover, in the NADH pathway, the maximum producing hydrogen flux of 29.27% was gained at 5g/L glucose, which was mainly because that more NADH was consumed in the pathway of 2,3-butanediol at higher glucose concentration (Wu et al., 2008). Research on the uptake hydrogen (see Table 6 ) showed that the hydrogen flux consumed at 5g/L glucose was only 4.01%, while it would increase notably when the initial glucose was higher than the limited concentration. And the ratio of the uptake hydrogen also enhanced from 3.91% (5g/L) to 15.59% (30g/L). This result suggested that the activity of the producing hydrogenase was higher at limited substrate concentration, and the uptake hydrogen flux could be restrained at this concentration which was in favor of hydrogen production. Finally, the above results suggested that the nodes of G6P and ACCOA seem to be the flexible nodes under different culture conditions. Therefore, the metabolic flux distributions could be regulated by changing culture conditions to improve the production of the target product."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, the metabolic network, including the producing and uptake hydrogen flux, of anaerobic glucose fermentation by K. pneumoniae ECU-15 was constructed. The uptake hydrogen would take up to about 30% of the total hydrogen production at certain conditions, and the consumption of hydrogen may be resulted from the uptake hydrogenase and the bidirectional hydrogenase. Moreover, the apparent hydrogen generation was the combined actions of producing hydrogenase, uptake hydrogenase and bidirectional hydrogenase. However, the activity of these enzymes was not determined in the experiment, and more works need to be done in the following studies."
