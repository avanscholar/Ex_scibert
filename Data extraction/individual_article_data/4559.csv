0,Introduction,"Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of ketones using Ru(II)/arene/TsDPEN complexes such as 1–7 (Fig. 1 ) is a well-established process that generates alcohols in high enantioselectivities [1-6]. The catalysts are well-suited to the reductions of acetophenone derivatives and alkynyl(acetylenic) ketones, which are reduced in high ee through relatively well-understood transition states (Fig. 2 ) [2]. Complex 1 was first reported by Noyori et al. in 1995 [3] and in 2005, we reported tethered complexes of type 2 [4], which have subsequently seen widespread application [5]. Related complexes, 3 [4], 4 [5], 5 [5], 6 [4] and 7 [4] have been reported and widely studied in ATH applications [6]. ATH, using the Ru(II) catalysts 1–5, of α,β-unsaturated ketones reveals a rather more complex pattern of selectivities. Deng et al. [7] described the reductions of ketones with catalyst 1 to the corresponding allylic alcohols, using a combination of formic acid and trimethylamine (FA/TEA) as solvent and reducing agent, in high yield; enantioselectivities depended on the substitution pattern on the alkene (Fig. 3 a). Using chalcone as the substrate for TH with the achiral ligand N-tosylethyenediamine (TsEN), the reduction product was a ca. 3:1 mixture of saturated ketone and saturated alcohol [7]. Increasing the steric bulk of the alkyl substituent on benzylidineacetones has a complicated effect on the reduction selectivity using catalyst 1 (Fig. 3b) [8]. The ethyl substituent increased the 1,2 selectivity whilst the larger isopropyl group gave equal proportions of 1,2- and 1,4-reduction products in lower conversion. The tert-butyl substituent strongly disfavoured all ketone reduction. Noyori catalyst 1 was applied to the ATH of β-alkyl β-trifluoromethyl α,β-unsaturated ketones to yield 1,2-reduction products selectively [9]. Aryl-ketone substrates were reduced in high ee as expected, while a methyl ketone gave a product in poor enantioselectivity (Fig. 3c). The (non-asymmetric) TH of CC bonds in enones, using TsEN as a ligand in the Ru(II) complex, can be promoted by incorporating an electron withdrawing groups into the substrate [7], including nitro, ester, nitrile and carboxylic acids. Some asymmetric examples of CC reduction have been reported [7]. A series of α-substituted cyclic α,β-unsaturated ketones were reduced selectively with the Noyori-Ikariya complex 1 to the corresponding cycloalkenols 8–10, although the carbamate substrate also yielded a small amount of the 1,4-reduction product 11 (Fig. 4 ) [10]. The acyclic analogue of 10 in contrast was reduced with complete 1,4-alkene selectivity, yielding a mixture of 33% saturated ketone and 67% saturated alcohol. In some cases an enone can be formed in situ and directly reduced. Adolfsson’s α-amino acid hydroxyamide ligand 12 has been applied to ATH of allylic alcohols by oxidation to the corresponding enone, followed by complete reduction of alkene and carbonyl functionalities (Fig. 5 ) [11]. Use of the stronger base potassium tert-butoxide was important for the success of this reduction. Kosmalski applied the Noyori catalyst 1 to the reduction of β-dimethylamino-acetophenone and found that the main product was the partially reduced elimination product [12]. Therefore there is still scope for increased understanding of the subtle effects of substrate structure on the regioselectivity of enone ATH. In this paper, we report our results from our investigation into this area."
1,Results and discussion,"We first examined the ATH of β-chloropropiophenone 13 [13]. Reduction using catalyst (S,S)-2 in FA/TEA at 60 °C gave complete conversion to 1-phenylpropan-1-ol 14, in high enantioselectivity (Fig. 6 ). Subjecting 15 to the same ATH conditions gave 14, in identical ee as obtained previously, as did the reduction of 16, indicating that both were likely to be common intermediates in the formation of 14. Vinyl alcohol 17 was inert under the same conditions in contrast to the result in Fig. 5 [11] and no 17 was observed in the reduction of 15 or 16. Initial 1,4-reduction of 15 is expected to be favourable due to the high reactivity of the unhindered mono-substituted vinyl group. trans-Benzylideneacetophenone 18 (chalcone) was reduced using both catalyst (S,S)- 2 and the methoxy analogue 3 under a variety of conditions (Table 1 ). With both catalysts, 1,4-reduction was favoured. The substrate was fully consumed but some saturated ketone 20 was observed. Alcohol 19 was produced with consistently good ee of ca. 95–98% in FA/TEA for both catalysts. Compound 21 was formed with a lower ee (73–85%), which is consistent with the presence of two π systems that could compete as directing groups for reduction (Fig. 2). Catalyst (R,R)- 3 delivered products in slightly higher ee than (S,S)- 2 under the same conditions. Racemic standards were prepared using sodium borohydride; alcohol 21 was prepared by Luche reduction [12], while a sample of 20 was produced by a one pot reduction in the presence of palladium on carbon, acetic acid, isopropanol, and sodium borohydride [13]. The products ees were measured by chiral HPLC, and the product ratio was determined by NMR spectroscopy to ensure that the measurement was quantitative. Cerium trichloride [12] was tested as an additive (Table 1, entry 5), but it had only a marginal effect. However the additional methanol co-solvent was advantageous, as substrate 18 was poorly soluble in FA/TEA. Further reactions using equal quantities of FA/TEA and MeOH at lower concentration (0.5 M instead of 2 M) gave full conversion to product (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Using H2O/MeOH as the solvent system and sodium formate as hydrogen donor (Table 1, entry 6) [14], with (R,R)- 3 as the catalyst, the reduction was slower, with incomplete conversion after 45 h at 60 °C and the ee of alcohol 19 reduced to 86%. Increasing the FA/TEA/MeOH reaction temperature to 60 °C or decreasing it to 25 °C had a marginal effect on the selectivities (entries 7 and 8). Screening of alternative co-solvents in the reduction of 18 was undertaken (Supporting Information). Aprotic solvents tested performed similarly, giving similar or slightly improved 1,4-selectivity and ee compared to reactions with MeOH. Water was also tested as a co-solvent with FA/TEA, however the solubility of 18 in the aqueous FA/TEA mixture was poor, and the enantioselectivty of both products lower than for the other solvents tested. It was expected that the configurations of both 19 and 21 were the same and this was confirmed by hydrogenating the product mixture from Table 1 entry 4 using Pt2O as a catalyst. Given the ratio of alcohols 19 and 21, the predicted ee of 19 after alkene hydrogenation is 97% if the configuration of both alcohols is the same, and 91% if it is different (Supporting Information). The experimental measurement of ee after hydrogenation was 97%, confirming that 19 and 21 must have the same configuration. The electronic nature of the aromatic ring adjacent to the ketone could influence the 1,4- vs 1,2-selectivity of reduction [15]. To test this, chalcone derivatives containing p-Cl, p-OMe and p-NMe2 were reduced with catalyst (R,R)-3 to products 22–24 (Fig. 7 ). Electron donating substituents slow down the rate of reduction, and increase the 1,4-selectivity. The proportion of 1,2-product was so low for the p-methoxy and p-dimethylamino products 23 and 24 respectively, that the ee of the unsaturated product could not be determined. In order to establish the importance of each aromatic ring in the chalcone derivatives, the corresponding cyclohexyl substituted substrates were reduced by ATH (Fig. 7). The ketone with a cyclohexyl adjacent to the alkene reacted with similar selectivity to chalcone, to give 25 with a slight increase in 1,4-selectivity (97% ee). Reduction of the ketone with the cyclohexyl adjacent to the ketone, in contrast, gave different products 26 depending on which catalyst was used. In general it gave a much higher proportion of 1,2-reduction product, although 1,4-selectivity was highest under aqueous conditions using sodium formate as the hydrogen source (Fig. 7). The ee of reduction was also poor. This demonstrates the importance of the aromatic ring adjacent to the ketone for the control of enantioselectivity, but that the aromatic ring on the alkene is of secondary importance. ATH of a substrate with a β,β-disubstitution gave a product in high 1,4-selectivity, with predominant formation of the saturated alcohol 27 over the equivalent allylic alcohol although in only 55% ee. It is known in the literature that alkynes are generally inert under ATH conditions, and are capable of acting as directing groups (Fig. 2) [3d,4,6]. It was therefore of interest to establish the outcome of the ATH of substrates containing both an alkyne and an alkene flanking the central ketone (Fig. 8 ). The precursor ketones were prepared by reaction of the required lithiated acetylene with the Weinreb amide of cinnamic acid. Racemic standards were obtained for all the products and HPLC was used to directly assess the regio- and stereoselectivity of the reactions. Product ratios were also determined by 1H NMR data. In the ATH of the diphenyl substrate, using (R,R)-2, the saturated and unsaturated products 28 and 29 respectively were formed in an 83:17 ratio (Fig. 8). The ee of 28 was highest, presumably because the alkene is reduced first and the resulting propargylic ketone is selectively reduced following existing precedent [1,3d,4c]. The 1,2-reduction product 29 was formed in lower ee likely due to competing electron-rich unstaturated bonds in the CH/π of the reduction transition state (Fig. 2). The absolute configuration of the products was not unambiguously determined. However it is likely that the R-configuration products will be formed using the (R,R)- configuration catalyst, based on the precedent for this class of reductions. A reaction/time study was completed to investigate the ATH using HPLC (Supporting Information). From an early stage in the reaction, the formation of the intermediate saturated ketone was essentially instantaneous, and a small amount of unsaturated product was also observed. As time increases, starting material and intermediate ketone disappear and the two alcohol products are formed. The effect of solvent on the reaction was also investigated and a time study for each solvent was undertaken to explore the relative rate of formation of each of the intermediate and product species over time (Supporting Information). DFT studies have indicated that using MeOH engages in hydrogen bonding interactions to the ketone during the reduction [2a,2e] and in some cases different solvents have been demonstrated to reverse the enantioselectivity [16]. However the results, whilst similar to those in Fig. 8, were inferior with respect to product selectivity, enantioselectivity and conversion. Four further ATH catalysts, 1, 3, ‘4C-tethered’ 6 and the ‘benzyl-bridged’ 7 were also used (Fig. 8). Time studies were also conducted to track the formation of products and intermediates in each case (Supporting Information). Catalyst 6 produced similar ratios of alcohols and ee values as seen with 2, however, it gave lower conversion. Catalyst 3 gave a similar result to that of 6. ATH with 3 at the lower temperature of 25 °C gave a more selective product ratio (79:21 28:29) with high ee’s of 98% and 87% for the saturated OH and unsaturated OH respectively. However the conversion was slightly lower at 85%. Catalyst 7 gave approximately a 1:1 ratio between the saturated and unsaturated products which could be due to the hindered nature of the catalyst. The ATH (1 mol% catalyst (R,R)-2, MeOH co-solvent at 40 °C) was tested with other substrates and in all cases, standards of the reduction products were prepared for HPLC analysis. Attempts were made at ATH of the TMS-substituted alkyne but decomposition was observed. However the ATH of the TIPS-enynone was successful. Products 30 and 31 were isolated as a mixture, in a ratio of 69:31 and in a conversion of just 81%. The ATH was less selective for the 1,4-reduction pathway and hence, produced more of unsaturated alcohol 31. The enantioselectivity was high for both alcoholic products however. The products of ATH of the p-methoxyphenyl derivative were obtained as an 86:14 mixture of 32 and 33. Hence the electron-donating group does not appear to significantly affect the reaction mechanism or product distribution. The p-chlorobenzene (PCB) derivative gave a product as a mixture of 34 and 35, with slightly lower enantioselectivity. An impurity was found in the 1H NMR spectrum and it was hypothesised that this was the alkyne reduction production 36, based on the observation of a further ABX system in the 1H NMR spectrum (see the Supporting Information)."
2,Conclusions,"Investigation of the ATH of a range of enones showed that predominant 1,4- reactivity is favoured and the majority of aromatic-ketone substrates were reduced to their saturated alcohols with high ee. Electron-donating para substituents on the ketone favoured 1,4-reduction further. The ATH of alkene/alkyne ketones leads to a mixture of chiral alcohols via 1,4 and 1,2-reduction pathways, the 1,4-pathway being predominant in the reaction. A time study of the reaction confirmed that the CC bond is rapidly reduced early in the reduction process, and the saturated products were formed in higher ee than the unsaturated ones."
