0,Introduction,"The design of organometallic complexes containing chiral ligand is of fundamental importance for asymmetric catalysis. Improvements in reactivity and selectivity of catalyst for the asymmetric catalysis attracted a great deal of attention. Catalytic asymmetric reduction of unsaturated compounds such as olefins, ketones or imines is one of the most reliable methods used to synthesize the corresponding chiral saturated and enantio-enriched products such as alkanes, alcohols or amines [1]. Generally, all asymmetric organometallic catalysts bear one chiral ligand at least. Up to now, a number of complexes involving metal or metal ion and chiral organic ligand have been widely used for asymmetric synthesis. Especially, the use of tertiary phosphorus ligands such as phosphine, phosphinite or phosphite etc., is widespread in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis as these ligands can be used to fine tune the metal reactivity and selectivity [2]. More than a thousand of phosphorus-based chiral nonracemic ligands including striking examples dissymmetric phosphine ligand BINAP [3], DIOP [4], DuPHOS [5], JOSIPHOS [6], CHIRAPHOS [7], phosphinite ligand BINAPO [8], phosphonite [9], and phosphate [10] ligands have already been synthesized. The ligand structure plays a key role in the performance of such phosphorus-based catalysts. It was stated that the phosphinites are among the most important phosphorus based ligands because they have different steric and electronic properties [11–13]. Thus, it is a considerable interest to develop highly effective chiral phosphinite ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Among the unsaturated compounds, ketones are the most used compounds in asymmetric catalysis. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to their reduction into secondary alcohols via catalytic hydrogenation [14]. This process has been exploited in production of a variety of secondary alcohols which is an important class of intermediates for numerous fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [2,15]. Catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones is promising alternative for catalytic H2-hydrogenation. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and formic acid/triethylamine (TEAF) are the most used hydrogen sources in transfer hydrogenation reactions [16]. The advantages of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation using IPA as a hydrogen source are well documented in the literature [17–19]. Metal-based reduction of ketones to alcohols has recently attracted attention by a number of research groups [1] and references therein. Main group metals such as aluminium have historically been used in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones [2,20]. Since the pioneering work of Noyori on the use of Ru(II) complexes in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones [21], numerous metal-based catalytic systems have been reported. Nowadays the metal complexes ruthenium [22], rhodium [23] or iridium [24] are mainly catalysts of choice for this type of reaction. Among them, ruthenium catalysts attracted considerable interests due to their superior performance [22] and cost-effectiveness of ruthenium compared to other metals used in asymmetric hydrogenation. Therefore, phosphinite-based ruthenium complexes [25–27] encouraged us to develop new chiral phosphinite-Ru(II) catalytic system. Recently, we reported the synthesis of new C 2-symmetric chiral phosphinite ligands derived from amino alcohols and their application in Ru-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation [28]. Next, we prepared a new C 2-symmetric chiral phosphinite ligand namely (1S, 8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanebis(diphenylphosphinite) as an extension of ongoing project and employed it in ruthenium catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of prochiral aromatic ketones (acetophenone derivatives) with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) under varying conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,General methods and materials,"2.1 General methods and materials Unless otherwise stated, all reactions were carried out under inert atmosphere (argon) using conventional Schlenk glass-ware, solvents were dried using established procedures and distilled under argon or nitrogen immediately prior to use. Analytical grade and deuterated solvents were purchased from Merck or Sigma–Aldrich. The starting material (1S,8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenylethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanediol was prepared according to the literature [29]. 1H (400.1MHz), 13C NMR (100.6MHz) and 31P-{1H} NMR (162.0MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 spectrometer, with δ referenced to external TMS and 85% H3PO4 respectively. GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC 2010 plus gas chromatograph equipped with cyclodex B (Agilent) capillary column (30m×0.32mm I.D.×0.25μm film thickness). The GC parameters for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions were as follows; initial temperature, 50°C; initial time 1.1min; solvent delay, 4.48min; temperature ramp 1.3°C/min; final temperature, 150°C; initial time 2.2min; temperature ramp 2.15°C/min; final temperature, 250°C; initial time 3.3min; final time, 44.33min; injector port temperature, 200°C; detector temperature, 200°C, injection volume, 2.0μL."
3,General procedure for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"2.2 General procedure for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones According to the typical experimental procedure; a flame dried Schlenk flask was charged with [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 (0.01mmol), (1S, 8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanebis(diphenylphosphinite) (0.02mmol) and a stir bar. To these components were added IPA (5mL) and the resultant solution was stirred at room temperature until the complex was formed (reaction was followed by 31P-NMR). A solution of ketone (0.5mmol) in IPA (5mL) was then added to catalyst mixture and the solution was heated to the desired temperature (generally, 25, 50 or 82°C). The reaction was then initiated with the addition of a solution of KOH (2.5mL, 0.1M IPA). Catalytic reactions were periodically monitored by GC. As soon as the reaction completed, an aliquot of the catalytic solution (1mL) was removed via syringe and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resultant oil was subjected to flash chromatography (silica gel-60, Et2O) and subsequent evaporation under reduced pressure to yield clear liquid. Subsequently a sample of the reaction mixture was taken off, diluted with acetone and analyzed immediately by GC, conversions obtained are related to the residual unreacted ketone."

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for an hour and the triethylammonium chloride was removed by filtration under argon atmosphere and the remaining organic phase dried in vacuo to produce a white viscous oily compound (1S, 8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanebis(diphenylphosphinite) (Yield: 151mg, 94%). 1 H NMR (CDCl3) δ(ppm): 1.44 (d, 6H, J =7.1Hz), 2.49–2.63 (m, 5H), 2.79–2.86(m, 3H),3.85–4.10 (m, 8H), 6.91–7.81 (m, 40H); 13 C NMR (CDCl3) δ(ppm):13.95, 49.80, 53.62, 59.45, 67.66, 70.13, 114,70, 120.94, 127.73, 127.91, 128.23, 128.30, 129.50, 131.7, 133.31, 136.73, 142.22, 158.90; 31 P-{ 1 H} NMR (CDCl3) δ(ppm): 114.17."

6,Synthesis of chiral C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite) ligand and its corresponding Ru(II) complex,"3.1 Synthesis of chiral C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite) ligand and its corresponding Ru(II) complex The C 2-symmetric chiral diols derivated from amino alcohols have led to the synthesis of several chiral bis(phosphinites) as ligands for asymmetric catalysis [28]. Firstly, we prepared the chiral C 2-symmetric amino alcohol (1S,8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanediol according to the literature procedure [29]. We then synthesized C 2-symmetric chiral bis(phosphinite) ligand (1S,8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanebis(diphenylphosphinite) from the chiral C 2-symmetric amino alcohol by the subsequent reaction with two equivalents of chlorodiphenylphosphine (Ph2PCl) and Et3N in freshly distilled toluene under argon atmosphere as seen in Scheme 1 . It is well known that the phosphinites are unstable in the solid state and decompose rapidly on exposure to air or moisture. In order to avoid oxidation of the phosphinite groups, the synthesis and isolation of the phosphinites must be carried out under argon atmosphere. The formation of bis(phosphinite) ligand was followed by 31P-{1H} NMR spectroscopy in which the signal of the Ph2PCl at δ =81.0ppm disappeared and new singlet appeared due to diphenylphosphinite moiety at 114.17ppm (in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds [30–33]) due to the equivalent phosphorus nuclei [33,28a] of C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite) ligand as seen Fig. 1 . The ammonium salt was separated by filtration and the ligand was obtained by removing the solvent under reduced pressure in 94% yield at the end of the reaction. Furthermore, solution of the phosphinite ligand in CDCl3 or common organic solvents is unstable, decomposes gradually to give corresponding oxide. We circumvented this problem by preparing ruthenium complex via an in situ way. The corresponding ruthenium(II) complex was prepared from the interaction of chiral C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite) ligand and [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 (molar ratio 2:1) and then used as a catalyst precursor in asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions (new singlet appeared due to diphenylphosphinite-Ru(II) moiety at 112.14ppm, Fig. 1)."
7,Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones,"3.2 Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions are one of the most basic, but important, transformations in organic chemistry. Synthesis of chiral secondary alcohols via transition metal catalyzed reactions has also drawn a great interest. Numerous chiral secondary alcohol formed by asymmetric catalysts have been described in the literature [34]. Efficient catalysts for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones include chiral Sm(III) complexes [1,34b] with high enantioselectivity and Noyori’s ruthenium complexes containing arene and TsDPEN (Ts: p-toluensulfonyl) ligands [34a,35]. The ligands used in asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions contain various combinations of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur and arsenic as the donor atom and they can also be classified as anionic or neutral [16]. Among these ligands, phosphinites are the most important phosphorus based ligands with different steric and electronic properties [11–13]. Intensive studies have been carried out both in industry and academia to the development of bis(phosphinite) or bis(phosphine) ligands that promote enantioselective ruthenium catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of pro-chiral aromatic ketones [1,27]. The catalytic performance (conversion and enantioselectivity) of a novel chiral C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite) ligand-ruthenium(II) catalyst system was explored in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone by isopropyl alcohol (IPA),wherein IPA is the hydrogen source as seen in Scheme 2 . This catalyst system catalyzed the reduction of acetophenone to the (S)-1-phenylethanol via hydrogen transfer from IPA (Scheme 2) and the results are summarized in Fig. 2 . Employed acetophenone/Cat/KOH molar ratios and reaction temperatures were varied in order to find optimal transfer hydrogenation conditions. The optimization of acetophenone/Cat/KOH molar ratio and reaction temperature were to be essential to achieve high enantioselectivity or conversion (Fig. 2). The presence of base (KOH or NaOH) is absolutely necessary to observe appreciable conversions because of the fact that base presumably facilitates catalysis by promoting formation of intermediates (possibly [Ru]-H from the [Ru]-Cl precatalyst) [16,36]. The transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone (acetophenone/Cat/KOH; 100:1:5 ratios) proceeded very slowly and the (S)-1-phenylethanol was formed with a low conversion (up to 15%) and moderate enantioselectivity (up to 76% ee) in all reactions at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 2, optimization studies of the catalytic reduction of acetophenone in IPA showed that good activity was obtained with a base/catalyst ratio of >5:1 and increasing the substrate-to-catalyst ratio does not lower the conversions of the product in most cases. It should be noted that the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone could be achieved up to 95% conversion and enantioselectivty was still high even if the substrate-to-catalyst ratio reached to 1000:1. The transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone proceeded enantioselectivity with a slow rate (but conversion did not change) when the reaction performed in air. Encouraged by the good catalytic activity (enantioselectivities and conversions) obtained from these optimization studies, we extended our investigation to include asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives at different temperatures (50 or 82°C). Only low conversions (36–46%) but high ee’s (82–89%) were observed after 24h for acetophenone derivatives (Fig. 3 ) at 50°C. The catalytic activity of chiral bis(phosphinite)-Ru(II) catalyst system was significantly enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature from room temperature to 82°C, giving almost quantitative conversions and high enantioselectivity of acetophenone derivatives (p-fluoroacetophenone, p-chloroacetophenone, p-bromoacetophenone, p-methoxyacetophenone, o-methoxyacetophenone) in range of 90–98% and 80–89% in 1h, respectively (Fig. 4 ). A significant higher conversion could be achieved at 82°C, which led to only a slight decrease in enantioselectivity in comparison to the reaction at 50°C (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) [37]. It is well known that electronic properties of the substituents on the phenyl ring of the acetophenone also caused changes in the reduction rate. The introduction of F, Cl or Br (known as electron-withdrawing group) to the p-position of the aryl ring of the ketone was improved the reduction rate giving rise to easier hydrogenation [25,38]. As shown in Fig. 3 or Fig. 4, the introduction of a methoxy group (known as electron-donating group) to the p-position of the aryl ring of the ketone decelerates the reaction, but that to the o-position increases the rate and improves the enantioselectivity. p-methoxyacetophenone is known to be a challenging substrate thus, the introduction of a methoxy group to the p-position decelerates the reaction probably because of its low redox potential, but addition to the o-position increases the rate and improves the enantioselectivity [37]. Among all selected ketones, the best results were obtained in the reduction of o-methoxyacetophenone giving 90% or 89% ee at 50 or 82°C, respectively. Table 1 shows the various C 2-symmetric chiral bis(phosphinite)-Ru(II) catalyst systems which have been tested in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone to produce the corresponding (R)-or (S)-1-phenylethanol at different temperature. Compared to catalyst systems given in Table 1, it is worth to note that the in situ prepared (1S,8S)-3,6-[N-(S)-α-phenyl ethyl]diaza-1,8-diphenoxymethyl-1,8-octanebis(diphenylphosphinite)-Ru(II) catalyst showed good catalytic activity for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone."
8,Conclusion,A new and efficient chiral C 2-symmetric bis(phosphinite)-Ru(II) catalyst system was used for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of pro-chiral and substituted aromatic ketones. We found that this catalyst system shows moderate to high conversion and also shows high enantioselectivity at different temperatures.
