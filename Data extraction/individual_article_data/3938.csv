0,Introduction,"Second-generation (2G) ethanol is a biofuel that can potentially replace fossil fuels and curb increasing green-house gases emissions [1]. Due to its the compact structure of lignocellulosic biomass, pretreatment is required to reduce its natural recalcitrance. Pretreatment with ionic liquids (ILs) have been studied in the past years and shown promising results [2]. One of the main advantages of using ILs is their capacity to be tailored to their application, and so by choosing a suitable cation/anion combination it is possible to increase the selectivity of pretreatment [3]. Lignin is one of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass and its presence in the biomass hinders enzyme accessibility [4]. An ideal pretreatment selectively removes/solubilizes the lignin and preserves the carbohydrates — cellulose and hemicelluloses — in the remaining pulp, which may then be further converted into sugar monomers by enzyme cocktails. The price of the IL also needs to be taken into account during IL design. Aprotic ILs have demonstrated promising results in terms of biomass fractionation, but their high cost poses a significant economic hurdle on process development [5]. PIL synthesis consists of an acid base neutralization from bulk chemicals that impact in a low solvent cost of around $1.8 kg−1 [5], which is cheaper than the most commonly used aprotic ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [Emim][OAc], with estimated solvent cost of $20-50 kg−1 [6]. Protic ionic liquids (PILs) have been recently studied for biomass fractionation and have shown promising features, especially in terms of lignin solubilization [6–8]. Some insights into the mechanisms of how PILs work in dissolving biomass were already described in the literature [9–11]. The anion plays an important role on lignocellulosic biomass solubilization, especially towards lignin linkages. Under high temperatures, the anion act as a nucleophile and attacks electron-deficient sites in the lignin and β-O-4 bonds are the main ones cleaved, which result in the increase of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Aliphatic hydroxyl groups content may also decrease under high temperatures due to dehydration reactions [9,11]. The overall result of such reactions is the reduction of the average molecular weight of the macromolecule. The cation also impacts on biomass solubilization. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the cation enhances biomass deconstruction and may act synergistically with the anion by hydrogen bond interactions [12]. PILs such as triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate, [TEA][HSO4], are potential pretreatment agents to selectively solubilize lignin and hemicelluloses and generate cellulose-rich pulps [13]. Most studies, however, were performed at a small scale in vials or glass tubes, suitable for introductory studies, but lacking information on following scale up. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a protic ionic liquid, 2-hydroxyethanol ammonium acetate or monoethanolammonium acetate, [MEA][OAc], by testing several conditions in bench scale reactors (0.5 L) without milling or sieving of the raw biomass, in order to mimic a larger-scale process. Pretreatment severity is a parameter mainly affected by temperature and residence time; higher severity usually implies higher biomass fractionation at the cost of lower selectivity [14]. Pretreatment with PILs such as [MEA][OAc], however, may provide high delignification selectivity whilst effectively fractionating biomass components even under high severities [6]. Pretreatment parameters that are directly linked to mass transfer properties, such as solids loading and water content, may also be considered in process optimization. The influence of water content is not as easily predictable. Early studies that evaluated the impact of water in ionic liquid pretreatment systems claimed ILs required a hygroscopic medium for a high performance [15], but this has been shown not to be true for PILs, which are water-compatible [16]. An anti-solvent is added to the pretreatment mixture after the reaction to facilitate the separation of the pulp from the IL. By changing the polarity/structure of the anti-solvent, lignin extraction may improve from the reaction mixture and possibly increase enzyme accessibility and lignin recovery. Additionally, chemical interactions between the anti-solvent and lignin may affect lignin structure upon its precipitation. Enzyme loading also plays an important role in the economics of cellulosic ethanol production and should thus be carefully investigated [17]. However, there is a lack of such studies in the literature. To integrate and add value to sugarcane biorefinery, a structural characterization of the recovered lignins needs to be performed so that possible future applications may be identified [18]. Lignin valorization can be performed chemically by catalytic depolymerization and/or functionalization for the production of added value aromatic molecules and lignin-based materials such as lignin polymers/composites [18–20]. Therefore, in this study we also aimed to analyze the structure of the lignins obtained in the PIL pretreatment."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock Sugarcane bagasse was provided by São João Mill (Araras-SP, Brazil). The material was air dried for chemical compositional analysis and pretreatment assays. Samples were not ground prior to PIL pretreatment. The chemical composition of raw sugarcane bagasse, as percentage of dry mass, was: cellulose, 41.95 ± 1.41%; hemicelluloses, 25.43 ± 0.69%; lignin, 23.79 ± 1.34%; extractives 2.13 ± 0.46%, acetyl groups 3.46 ± 0.07% and ash, 2.95 ± 0.80%."
3,Protic ionic liquid synthesis and characterization,"2.2 Protic ionic liquid synthesis and characterization The protic ionic liquid [MEA][OAc] was synthesized by adding equimolar amounts of acetic acid and monoethanolamine in a stirring jacketed glass reactor according to Pin et al. [12]. Physico-chemical properties of the synthesized [MEA][OAc] such as viscosity, refraction index, and density were also measured. The NMR-H [1] and NMR-C [13] spectra were recorded and are shown in the ESI."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Factorial designs were employed in this study in order to provide a better understanding of the factors’ impact range and their interaction on cellulose and hemicellulose saccharification yields, the main response variables evaluated in this work. To a lesser extent, the degree of delignification was also assessed and correlated with the carbohydrate conversions in saccharification. The deviation values for the degree of delignification were based on triplicates for the time-temperature experiments and duplicates for the water content and anti-solvent experiments. Some experiments were further validated by single-variable experiments (time-temperature and solids loading-water content) to ensure all parameters were appropriately investigated. Table 1 summarizes the experimental outlook of this work. To study the influence of pretreatment’s severity, a 32 full factorial design with center point triplicates was performed, with time and temperature as factors. The high temperature level, 150 °C was chosen based on the onset degradation temperature of [MEA][OAc] in a TGA analysis by Rocha et al. [7]. Following this, pretreatment time was varied as a single factor to validate the assumptions from the time-temperature experiments. A 22 full factorial design with center point triplicates was performed to assess the impact of solids loading and water content — mass transfer parameters — on the PIL performance. Due to its importance, the water content was reevaluated in a single variable experiment. The impact of the anti-solvent was assessed by using protic solvents with different carbon numbers in their structure. Lastly, investigation on the enzyme loading was performed with a 22 full factorial design with 4 axial points and center point triplicates. Cellulases and hemicellulases loading were the considered factors."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis All data collected from the optimization experiments was subjected to statistical tests. Levene’s test was performed to guarantee the homoscedasticity of the data. ANOVA was performed on the factorial designs as well as linear regressions and, when necessary, Tukey’s test was also performed for post-hoc analysis. The statistical tests were applied with the softwares STATISTICA (version 10.0, Statsoft) and R Studio (version 1.1.4.56, RStudio Inc.)."
6,Protic ionic liquid pretreatment,"2.5 Protic ionic liquid pretreatment Pretreatment assays were performed in custom-built stainless-steel reactors of 0.5 L capacity. Around 10.7 g of unground, air dried sugarcane bagasse were added to the reactors together with a mixture of [MEA][OAc] and water. This amount of biomass was kept fixed and [MEA][OAc] and water quantities varied according to the biomass loading and water content shown in Table 1. After mixing, the reactors were immersed in a glycerin bath (Marconi, MA 159/BB, Brazil) that was pre-heated to the pretreatment temperature (120, 135 or 150 °C). Pretreatment parameters were varied (or kept fixed) as detailed in Table 1. The heating ramps were based on the residence time calculations for the pretreatments [21]. Following the reaction, the reactors were cooled in an ice bath. Pretreated samples were washed three times with 250 mL of the anti-solvent (water, isoamyl alcohol, isopropanol, or ethanol) and filtered in cloth bags. The filtered solids were air dried for further enzymatic hydrolysis evaluation and the three liquid fractions were combined and evaporated by rotary evaporation (Ika, RV10 control VC, Germany) at 70 °C and 500 mbar to produce a mixture of PIL-water-lignin. The mixture was then centrifuged (Marconi, Brazil) at 7500 RPM (6300 g) for 30 min to precipitate the lignin, which was then thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried in the oven for 24 h at 105 °C and stored in plastic bags for further analysis."
7,Enzymatic saccharification,"2.6 Enzymatic saccharification Pretreated materials were subjected to enzymatic saccharification. For all the saccharification assays — except for the enzyme optimization experiments — a cellulase cocktail Cellic Ctec2 (Novozymes) was employed with a loading of 15 FPU·g−1 dry biomass and 10 wt% solids loading. Enzyme optimization assays were also performed with a hemicellulases cocktail Cellic Htec2 (Novozymes), the enzyme loading was varied according with Table 1 and solids loading was kept at 10 wt%. All saccharification assays were performed in flasks incubated in an orbital shaker (MA-832, Marconi, Brazil) at 150 rpm, 50 °C, for 72 h and held at pH 4.8 with a 0.05 mol L−1 sodium citrate buffer. Cellulases activity was determined as filter paper units per mL of enzyme, as recommended by IUPAC [22]. Xylanases activity were also determined [23] with reaction volumes adapted for micro reactions [24]. Total protein was determined by the Bradford method [25]. Measured enzyme activities were 154.17 FPU·mL−1 for the cellulases and 6783 IU·mL−1 for the hemicellulases. The total protein was 78.6 and 76.5 mg mL−1 of protein for Cellic Ctec 2 and Htec2, respectively."
8,Compositional analysis of solid fractions,"2.7 Compositional analysis of solid fractions Pretreated bagasse samples obtained were air dried to less than 10 wt% of moisture content and milled prior to compositional analysis to less than 0.08 mm of particle size in a shear and impact mill (Pulverisette 14, Fritsch GmbH, Idar – Oberstein, Germany (Pulverisette 19, Fritsch GmbH, Idar – Oberstein, Germany). Structural carbohydrates — cellulose and hemicelluloses— and acid-soluble and insoluble lignin were quantified according to Sluiter et al. [26]. Moisture content of the samples was determined using an automatic infrared moisture analyser MA35 (Sartorius Gmbh, Goettingen, Germany)."
9,Compositional analysis of liquid fractions,"2.8 Compositional analysis of liquid fractions Monosaccharides and organic acids (formic and acetic acids) in the hydrolysates were analyzed using an HPLC system 1260 Infinity (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector. Columns and mobile phase conditions were employed based on a previously developed method [27]."
10,Lignin analysis,"2.9 Lignin analysis 2.9.1 Infrared FTIR spectroscopy (Spectrum One FTIR system, PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA) was performed on lignin samples with a universal attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory. Samples were analyzed without prior pelletization. FTIR spectra were obtained by averaging 16–32 scans from wavelength of 600–4000 cm−1. FTIR and GPC graphs were depicted in the E-supplementary data of this work which can be found in online version of the paper. 2.9.2 2D-NMR – heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) HSQC analysis was performed on the precipitated lignin. 20 mg of lignin was dissolved in 0.25 mL of DMSO‑d 6 [6] and the solution was transferred to a Shigemi tube. HSQC NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer based on Gschwend et al. [28]. 2.9.3 GPC GPC analysis was performed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity instrument equipped with a Viscotek column set (AGuard, A6000M and A3000M) and RID detector was used for detection. DMSO containing LiBr (1 g L−1) was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min−1 at 60 °C. Samples and standards preparation was performed according with Gschwend et al. [28]. Standard deviations for the lignins were Mn ± 100, Mw ± 300 and PDI ±0.3 or less. The calibration curve was obtained with polystyrene standards (range 170–2 × 106 g mol−1) of known molecular weight secured from Agilent."
11,Calculations,
12,Pulp yields,"3.1 Pulp yields The pulp yields were calculated based on the mass ratios of bagasse before and after pretreatment in a dry weight basis, as described in Equation (1).

13,Cellulose and hemicellulose yield in saccharification,"3.2 Cellulose and hemicellulose yield in saccharification Yields were calculated based on the mass ratios of cellulose and hemicellulose (xylan and arabinan) released on enzymatic saccharification, normalized to the initial amount used in the pretreatment (Equations (2) and (3)).

14,Degree of delignification,"3.3 Degree of delignification The degree of delignification was calculated based on the mass difference in the lignin content before and after pretreatment relative to the lignin content in raw bagasse in a dry weight basis, as shown in Equation (4).

16,Results and discussion,
17,Process parameter investigation,"4.1 Process parameter investigation Statistical analyses and overall parameter investigation progress were summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . In order to avoid an exhaustive statistical description of each experiment, the regression equations — with the significant factors — are shown in Table 2. All regressions passed the F test and reached significance levels of <0.10. Practical considerations were taken into account when selecting the best condition i.e. that where parameters would improve overall process efficiency rather than just maximizing carbohydrate conversion. For instance, compromising between a higher solids loading and water content in pretreatment, and a lower enzyme loading in saccharification. 4.1.1 Time and temperature — the influence of severity Residence time and temperature are fundamental parameters for a pretreatment, greatly impacting the severity of the process [14], and thus dictating the required robustness of the reactors and ease of downstream processing. In this work, it was decided not to combine both time and temperature in a single parameter, i.e., the severity (R0), in order to investigate their influence and possible interaction. The statistical analysis shown in Table 2 indicated that both time and temperature were significant, and that their increase improved cellulose and hemicellulose yields during saccharification. There was also a negative interaction between the two factors, as when they both increased there was a slight decrease in sugar yields, due to higher solubilization of cellulose and hemicellulose in the pretreatment step. For the cellulose yield, both time and temperature effects had similar orders of magnitude, despite temperature exerting a higher impact. For the hemicellulose yield, however, time had almost twice the impact of temperature, indicating hemicellulose are more time-sensitive. The graphs for the time-temperature experiments are summarized in Fig. 1 . The best conditions based on this factorial design were 150 min and 150 °C, which led to cellulose and hemicellulose yields of 76.6% and 51.1%, respectively; and 63.7% delignification (Table 3). There is a clear trend found in the response surfaces (Fig. 1 a-c): as temperature and time increased, the highest cellulose and hemicellulose yields were obtained, as well the highest delignification. It can be noted that cellulose yield and delignification had higher slopes when compared with the hemicellulose yield, which might indicate cellulose accessibility is more sensitive to delignification. It was possible to draw a correlation between delignification and cellulose yield (Fig. 1d) with R2 = 0.92. A similarly high correlation, was also reported by Rocha et al. [7], who obtained an R2 value of 0.94. Lignin is well-known to act as a physical barrier to enzymes and hinder their access to cellulose [4], and removal of this macropolymer from the biomass greatly improves enzyme performance in saccharification. Chambon et al. [29], studied the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with the PIL triethyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate [TEA][HSO4] with several particle sizes. There was also a high correlation between delignification and cellulose yields, especially for the whole bagasse samples, which is also the case in the present study. The hemicellulose yields, however, were low as [TEA][HSO4] is an acidic PIL and promotes rapid hemicellulose degradation even at short pretreatment times. Cellulose swelling rate accelerates as the temperature increases. Higher kinetic energy provided by high temperatures breaks down hydrogen bonds in the three-dimensional cellulose structure [15]. Rocha et al. [7] also studied the impact of temperature on the pretreatment performance of sugarcane bagasse with several PILs including [MEA][OAc]. They found that higher temperatures promoted higher cellulose yields: by increasing the temperature from 75 °C to 150 °C, there was a 3-fold increase in cellulose yield. Sun et al. [30] evaluated the pretreatment performance of switchgrass with [MEA][OAc] and found that the cellulose and hemicellulose yield (reported as xylose yield only) increased by 20% and 18%, respectively, when the temperature was raised from 140 °C to 160 °C. In this study, from 120 °C to 150 °C with 150 min of pretreatment time, there was an increase of 30% and 15% in the cellulose and hemicellulose yields respectively. Although aprotic ILs act differently on the biomass, the effect of temperature can also be compared. A study by Kimon et al. [31] with sugarcane bagasse pretreated with 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride, [BMIM] [Cl], at different temperatures (110–160 °C) showed that partial cellulose dissolution occurred in all conditions. However, saccharification yields were significantly higher above 150 °C. Silva et al. [32] studied the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate, [EMIM][OAc] and observed that by increasing temperature from 60 °C to 120 °C there was a 2-fold increase glucose yield in the enzymatic saccharification of regenerated bagasse. The hemicellulose yield, however, decreased as temperature increased from 100 °C to 120 °C, indicating hemicellulose degradation. This was not the case of the present study, proving [MEA][OAc] is more selective towards hemicellulose fractionation. 4.1.2 Time course experiment Time-temperature factorial design showed that higher temperatures and longer residence times provided better PIL performance in terms of sugar yield and delignification. While the highest temperature and longest duration considered in this study were 150 °C and 8 h respectively, it was possible that longer pretreatment times and higher temperatures would further enhance the performance of the PIL. Prior tests (data not shown) with [MEA][OAc] showed that higher temperatures (up to 180 °C) did not significantly improve IL performance. Therefore, a time-course experiment at a fixed temperature (150 °C) was designed to investigate the isolated effect of residence time on the pretreatment performance of [MEA][OAc]. Statistical analysis of time-course data (Table 2) indicated that residence time did not impact substantially on cellulose yield at 150 °C given its small effect, 1.53 and R2 = 0.62. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference amongst the different residence times, but the Tukey test revealed that such difference only appears from 2 to 8 h [33]. The hemicellulose yields did not present any significant differences amongst the pretreatment times. Fig. 1e confirms the statistical analysis by showing a small difference for the different pretreatment times, both for cellulose and hemicellulose yields. A 2 h pretreatment time was chosen as the best condition (Table 3) from the time-course experiment, since shorter pretreatment times allow higher productivity. Sun et al. [30] also investigated the effect of time on switchgrass pretreatment performance with [MEA][OAc] and reported a slight increase in cellulose yield over time at high temperatures (160 °C). Chambon et al. [29] varied pretreatment time with the PIL [TEA][HSO4] from 1 to 24 h, and also observed satisfactory performance up to 8 h of pretreatment, however, due to the acidic PIL nature, there was a decrease in both cellulose and xylose yield for longer pretreatment times. Brandt et al. [5] worked on the pretreatment of miscanthus with [TEA][HSO4] and also reported good PIL performance up to 8 h of pretreatment and a drop in efficiency over time. Aprotic ILs present a reverse trend compared to the aforementioned works with PILs. Yoon et al. [34] studied the effect of residence time on the pretreatment performance of sugarcane bagasse with [EMIM][OAc] and noticed that under low temperatures, longer pretreatment times led to higher sugar yields, but at higher temperatures the yields decreased instead. Similar works with [EMIM][OAc] and red oak and kenaf powder also showed the same pattern. Yoon et al. [34] also found that longer pretreatment times at high temperatures led to the formation of coagulates that made it harder to regenerate the dissolved sugarcane bagasse. 4.1.3 Solids loading and water content — the impact on mass transfer The solids loading and water content are important parameters related directly to the mass and heat transfer properties of the system. One of the most significant methods to decrease the cost of pretreatment is to increase biomass loading and reduce IL use [35,36]. Ideally, by employing high solids loading, higher ethanol titres could be obtained, increasing overall process productivity. High water contents allow less PIL to be used and therefore make the process less costly. Although in theory ILs are recyclable and recoverable, their recycle rates are never quantitative and there are thus losses over the recycles; a typical recycle rate obtained by Brandt et al. [5] with the PIL [TEA][HSO4] varied between 98 and 99%. Hence, major PIL losses could be avoided by using less PIL. This would, however, come at the cost of losing catalytic efficiency if the PIL is too diluted. Eventually, a balance between high catalytic efficiency and high water content must be reached. Statistical analysis (Table 2) showed that both solids loading and water content impacted negatively on cellulose and hemicellulose yields, as expected. However, solids loading had a larger impact on sugar yields: nearly twice that of the water content on average. This could be explained by higher biomass loadings heavily impacting the mass transfer properties [35]. By increasing the solids loading, the overall viscosity of the system increases, whereas the opposite occurs by increasing the water content. By analyzing the graphs in Fig. 2 a-b, it can be noted the center points present values closer to the point of highest cellulose/xylan yield, i.e, 10 wt% solids and water, with statistical analysis indicating no significant difference between such yields. Therefore, the center point, corresponding to 15 wt% and 20 wt% of solids loading and water content respectively, was chosen as the best condition (Table 3) for such experiments. Sun et al. [30] studied the effect of biomass loading on the pretreatment performance of sugarcane bagasse with [MEA][OAc]. By increasing the solids loading from 5 wt% to 20 wt%, there was a drop in cellulose yield of approximately 10%. In this study, for both water content levels (10 wt% and 30 wt%), there was also an average drop of 10% in the cellulose yield as solids loading increased from 10 to 20 wt%. Weigand et al. [37] — in the pretreatment of willow with [TEA][HSO4] — and Semerci and Güler [38] — in the pretreatment of cotton stalks with 1-butyl-imidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HBMIM][HSO4] — also obtained satisfactory cellulose yields by employing 15% solids loading and 20% water content, proving ammonium-based PILs are both water compatible and tolerate high biomass loadings. Aprotic ILs present different behavior, as they tolerate very high solids loadings, up to 50 wt%. By varying the solids loading from 5 to 50%, Zhang et al. [39], found an optimum load of 30% in the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with [EMIM][OAc]. Whereas Cruz et al. [35], in a similar study on the effect of solids loading on the pretreatment of switchgrass with [EMIM][OAc], observed that up to 50 wt% there were no decrease in overall cellulose yields. The major drawbacks of using aprotic ILs are their high price and incompatibility with water. Once their main goal is to solubilize cellulose, even small water impurities can be detrimental to cellulose solubility. For instance, a study by Mazza et al. [40] on the cellulose dissolution in aprotic ILs showed the onset of cellulose precipitation in [BMIM][Cl] occurred at about 0.15 wt% water and that it was essentially complete at 0.25 wt% water. While there is no consensus on the major reason behind aprotic ILs sensitivity to water, one possible explanation is the disruption of cellulose-IL interactions via hydrogen bonds [6]. 4.1.4 Water content experiment The impact of water on IL performance in biomass deconstruction has been discussed in the literature [16,41]. As previously mentioned, aprotic ILs — that make up most of the studies — are quite sensitive towards low water concentrations. On the other hand, PILs, whose studies on biomass deconstruction are rapidly increasing, reveal a high water tolerance by altering cellulose structure rather solubilizing it in the IL [16]. The statistical analysis of the water content experiment (Table 2) showed that it impacted negatively on cellulose/hemicellulose yields, although small coefficient values indicate a low slope. As mentioned before, higher water contents allow less PIL to be used, but consequently decrease its catalytic efficiency. Fig. 2c shows that the cellulose yield is only kept high up to 20 wt% water. However, Tukey tests on the cellulose and hemicellulose yield showed there were no significant differences from 20 to 40 wt% water. Delignification also appeared to be negatively affected by higher water contents, but a Tukey test showed no significant differences amongst lower water contents of 3, 10 and 20 wt% [33]. Hence, aiming to maintain high sugar yields but also avoiding a decrease in delignification, it was decided to keep 20 wt% water as the best condition (Table 3). This condition provided 79.2%, 50.3%, and 53.4% of cellulose/hemicellulose yield and delignification, respectively. Brandt et al. [16] in a study on the pretreatment of miscanthus with 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium methyl sulfate, [BMIM][MeSO4], varied the water content from 1.1 to 80 vol% and observed that the highest cellulose yields were obtained with 10–30 vol% water, which confirms the trend found in this work. Interestingly, the lowest water content in Brandt et al.’s work, 1.1 vol%, did not present the highest cellulose content, whereas, in this work, the lowest possible water content 3 vol% did. PILs tend to exhibit a trend of water content converging to 20 wt% as seen from works by Rocha et al. [7], Weigand et al. [37], Brandt et al. [6], and Chambon et al. [29]. The majority of aprotic ILs, as aforementioned, have a high sensitivity towards water. However, there are some exceptions. Abe et al. [42] reported the dissolution of 15 wt% cellulose in aqueous solutions of tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide, [(C4)4P][OH], and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, [(C4)4N][OH], containing 40–50 wt% water at room temperature. A study on the pretreatment of rice husk with 60 wt% [(C4)4P][OH] showed incompatibility with a further enzymatic hydrolysis due to incorporation of phosphonium species in the regenerated biomass [43]. Shi et al. [44] studied the pretreatment of switchgrass with [EMIM][OAc] with several water contents (20, 50 and 80 wt%). They showed that IL-water mixtures with up to 50 wt% water still provided high cellulose yields after 72 h of saccharification. However, a closer look on more recent works on the biomass pretreatment with [EMIM][OAc] revealed that several authors prefer performing pretreatment under anhydrous conditions, which might still indicate such IL is not the best option for aqueous IL mixtures in the pretreatment [45–47]. 4.1.5 The effect of the anti-solvent The anti-solvent plays a crucial role on the solid-liquid separation step after pretreatment. The main goal of the anti-solvent is to solubilize the PIL and the extracted lignin from the insoluble pretreated material. Three anti-solvents with different carbon numbers in their structure were tested: ethanol, isopropanol and isoamyl alcohol plus a control with water. Statistical tests on the cellulose/hemicellulose yields showed there were no significant differences amongst the anti-solvents. However, the degree of delignification presented significant differences as can be observed from Fig. 3 a. Alcohols with lower carbon number in the alkyl chain presented higher delignification of the pulps, the lowest value — from isoamyl alcohol — was comparable to the water control. Presumably a different mechanism of lignin extraction occurs with the alcohols. The short alkyl chains (2 or 3 carbons) contributed to more hydrophobic lignin-alcohol interactions. Water stands out by having a high polarity and small molecular size, the former lessening lignin-alcohol interactions and the latter enhancing them. Its high polarity impacted more on lignin solubility than its size. From the lignin balance in Fig. 3b, approximately half of the lignin amount, or 30–35 wt% of the total lignin, extracted from the biomass was recovered in the precipitation step. Differences in polarity can also be noted from Fig. 3-c, which shows that more polar anti-solvents extract [MEA][OAc] more efficiently from the biomass. Water exhibited the highest recovery, 97.9 ± 0.87%, followed by ethanol, 92.2 ± 1.59%. The two higher alkyl chain alcohols — isoamyl alcohol and isopropanol — are statistically the same, from 85.2 ± 2.46% to 86.0 ± 1.65%. It is known that high PIL recovery rates are required to ensure the economic feasibility of the process [17]. Rocha et al. [7] reported a higher delignification and lignin recovery of 68 and 41 wt%, probably due to the more severe pretreatment conditions, 150 °C and 3.5 h on the bagasse pretreatment with [MEA][OAc]. Chambon et al. [29] reported even higher values of nearly 80 wt% for both delignification/lignin recovery using the PIL [TEA][HSO4]. As previously mentioned, [TEA][HSO4] is an acidic PIL and is therefore more “aggressive” towards biomass deconstruction, with high lignin and hemicellulose solubilization. Additionally, lignin precipitation is favored under low pHs. Sun et al. [30] reported high delignification rates of up to 75 wt% but did not recover the lignin from the PIL. There are no reports in the literature about the study of anti-solvents in PIL pretreatment. However, there are several studies upon the role of the anti-solvents in aprotic ILs pretreatment. Sun et al. [30], when testing the solubility of commercial biomass fractions in [EMIM][OAc], showed that a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) water:acetone had a high solubility for Kraft lignin, whereas the solubility of xylan and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were negligible. Li et al. [48] tested water, ethanol and methanol as anti-solvents for wheat straw regeneration from the IL mixture with 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium diethyl phosphate [EMIM][DEP] and did not find any significant differences in terms of sugar yield during saccharification. Wang et al. [49] observed that the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to water as an anti-solvent increased the cellulose content in the regenerated biomass. However, DMSO recovery from the aqueous mixtures would demand high energy input. As for the acetone-water mixtures, prior pretreatment tests in our work showed that the fractionated lignin was insoluble, confirming that PILs present a different mechanism of action compared to their aprotic counterparts. Water was still chosen as the best anti-solvent (Table 3) due to its low cost, best ability to extract [MEA][OAc], and the lack of significant differences in sugar yields amongst the tested anti-solvents. 4.1.6 The impact of enzyme loading The enzyme loading is an important process parameter as the enzyme price heavily impacts the ethanol price [17]. Although important, only a few studies with PILs evaluated the effect of the enzyme loading on sugar yields [30,45]. The statistical analysis (Table 2) showed that both cellulases and hemicellulases had a strong positive impact on the cellulose yield, with cellulases having a slightly higher impact (7.22 over 6.03). However, it is worth mentioning that the factors’ ranges in terms of protein loading were substantially different: 2.55–7.65 mg cellulases·g−1 biomass versus 10–50 mg hemicellulases gbiomass −1. The recommended high hemicellulases dosage by Novozymes is 0.6 wt%, which is substantially lower than this study’s upper level, 5 wt%. It was decided to choose such a high enzyme dosage for the upper level of hemicellulases loading due to the low hemicellulose yields obtained in past optimization experiments and prior tests with lower enzyme loadings. Cellulose yields of up to 88% were obtained (Fig. 4 a) with high enzyme loadings (17 FPU·gbiomass −1 and 5.83 wt%). The center point also provided considerable cellulose yield 80.3%, still in the range of cellulose yields obtained in previously assessed conditions (Table 3). The hemicellulose yield indeed was very sensitive towards both enzyme loadings as can be observed from Fig. 4b, which shows a steep response surface on the upper levels of both factors. Despite one negative quadratic estimate for cellulases loading (Table 2), all the remaining effect estimates impacted positively on the hemicelluloses yield with the linear effect of cellulases being the highest, 16.56, even employing higher hemicellulases loading. In fact, control experiments with only cellulases with 5, 10 and 15 FPU·gbiomass −1 provided 69.6, 77.1 and 78.6% of cellulose yield in 72 h, while the hemicellulose yields were 38.3, 42.9 and 49% respectively. Only the highest enzyme loadings provided yields higher than the control experiments, which would impact heavily on the process economics. Therefore, it was decided to keep 15 FPU gbiomass −1 (7.65 mg·gbiomass−1) without the addition of hemicellulases as the best condition (Table 3). The majority of works on PIL pretreatment [29,30,37,45,50] employed 20 mg·gbiomass −1 as recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [51]. Rocha et al. [7] also employed 15 FPU gbiomass −1 but added 20 IU·gbiomass −1 of β-glucosidases as additional enzymes. In all saccharification samples subjected to HPLC analysis in this work, cellobiose was not detected, once the cellulase cocktail (Cellic Ctec 2) contained β-glucosidases. Hence, our work employed the lowest enzyme loading for PIL pretreated samples. 4.1.7 Mass balance for [MEA][OAc] pretreatment A mass balance for the best conditions (last entry in Table 3) of [MEA][OAc] pretreatment is shown in Fig. 5 . One interesting feature is that the PIL pretreatment was highly selective towards delignification and carbohydrate preservation in the biomass. Acetate-based PILs are mildly alkaline and such feature impact on less hemicellulose solubilization during pretreatment [6], acidic PILs such as [TEA][HSO4] completely solubilize hemicelluloses after 8 h of pretreatment (Miscanthus pretreatment performed at 120 °C and 20 wt% of water) [5]. This is particularly noteworthy considering there are no reports in the literature on highly selective pretreatments. Enzymatic saccharification of the pulp yielded 33.65 g glucose·100 gbiomass −1 and 13.94 g pentoses·100 gbiomass −1. Rocha et al. [7], on the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with [MEA][OAc], reported 35.5 g glucose·100 gbiomass −1 and 15.0 g pentoses·100 gbiomass −1, slightly higher values. However, they did not optimize pretreatment parameters. For instance, they employed lower solids loading (10 wt%), longer pretreatment times (3.5 h) and they also added β-glucosidases to the enzyme cocktail. The sugar yields obtained in this work are also higher than in other works with PIL pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse, such as from Brandt et al. [5], Chambon et al. [29] and Sun et al. [30] or even aprotic ILs such as from Saha et al. [46] and Ávila et al. [45]."
18,Lignin analysis,"4.2 Lignin analysis The lignins generated from the anti-solvents tested in the parameter investigation process of [MEA][OAc] were analyzed for structural characterization. The pulps that resulted from such tests were subjected to enzymatic saccharification and there were no significant changes among the different pulps (Section 4.1.5). By following the same trend, we would not expect significant changes across the lignins. This was confirmed by spectroscopic techniques and GPC. However, lignins from [MEA][OAc] pretreatment still present interesting structural features. 4.2.1 FT-IR Lignin’s FT-IR spectrum (Supplementary Information) presents three distinct regions, with the correspondent bands for each region described in Table 4 . Region I contains the high frequency vibrations such as O–H stretching (3697 cm−1) and C–H stretching (2917 and 2849 cm−1). The large O–H stretching band indicates the lignin contains a lot of hydroxyl groups, whether phenolic or aliphatic, that interact through hydrogen bonds. Region II contains mainly CC (1630, 1557 and 1506 cm−1) stretching vibrations that come from the aromatic rings. In the low frequency part, there are also some C–H (1455 cm−1) and O–H bending vibrations (1420, 1375 and 1327 cm−1) that come from aliphatic and aromatic hydroxyl groups. There was also an absence of strong carbonyl bands around 1715 and 1730 cm−1 that excluded the presence of aldehydes or ketones in the lignin. Region III contains O–H stretching from alkyl aryl ether and primary/secondary alcohols (1221, 1120 and 1031 cm−1) and CC bending vibrations (913 and 831 cm−1). The strong O–H stretching band at 1031 cm−1 is a signature band for highly oxygenated materials such as lignocellulosic biomass. 4.2.2 HSQC HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) NMR is one of the most powerful techniques to unveil lignin structures because it correlates carbon and proton signals and thus makes the assignment for specific molecular moieties easier. There are usually two main regions of an HSQC spectrum that can be analyzed — the aliphatic and aromatic. The aliphatic or side chain region lies between 2.0 and 6.0 ppm. As the name implies, signals corresponding to the functional groups attached to the side chain regions of lignin can be found. The HSQC spectrum of lignin and the moiety assignments are depicted in Fig. 6 . From the side chain region (Fig. 6a), one moiety dominates the region, moiety A (Fig. 6c) with two aliphatic hydroxyl groups and residual β-O-4 bonds that confirm the bands in region III from the FT-IR spectrum. A signal from the γ position in moiety B also appears (Fig. 6c). Some residual xylan was also visible (Fig. 6c), indicating that the PIL was not able to completely fractionate lignin from hemicellulose. The strong signal from the methoxy groups is a signature signal in lignins due to the highly methoxylated aromatic moieties [50]. The aromatic region of the HSQC usually lies between 6.0 and 8.0 ppm and contains the aromatic moieties that make up lignin architecture. The basic building blocks of lignin are sinnapyl (S), guayacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units (Fig. 6c). Such units vary in their relative amount, say S:G:H ratio depending on the feedstock, harvest season and pretreatment conditions. However, as the H content is usually low in sugarcane’s lignin, the S/G ratio is a more important parameter. The calculated S/G ratio for the lignin was 2.04, a slightly higher value compared to the lignin obtained from sugarcane’s milled wood lignin, 1.6, indicating a decrease in G groups [52]. Menezes et al. [53] in the alkaline pretreatment of bagasse catalyzed by anthraquinone, obtained a similar S/G ratio of 2.2 which might confirm that pretreatment with [MEA][OAc] acts similarly to alkaline pretreatments not only due to the high degree of delignification, but also to the decrease in G units content. The relatively low S/G ratio and presence of H groups in the lignin suggest these lignins are not condensed and are prone to chemical derivatization. Some other moieties such as p-coumaric acid (PCA), ferulic acid (FA) and p-benzoic acid (PBC) were also found. The abundance in aromatic moieties in the lignin recovered from [MEA][OAc] fosters future applications in further depolymerization and production of aromatic compounds [18]. 4.2.3 GPC Except for the lignin produced with isoamyl alcohol as anti-solvent, all the GPC peaks (Supplementary Information) present the exact same shape and retention time. This can also be confirmed by the molecular weights shown in Table 5 . The polydispersity (PD) values varied between 3.74 (EtOH) to 8.88 (isoamyl alcohol); apart from isoamyl alcohol, such PD values are quite low and indicate that fractionation of lignin produced somehow more uniform lignin subunits. The Mw values varied between 4580 and 8141 g mol−1, which are quite low compared to the lignins obtained by Brandt et al. [5] on the pretreatment of miscanthus with [TEA][HSO4], whose average Mw varied between 5800 and 9000 g mol−1, showing that [MEA][OAc] deconstructed more the lignin structure. On the other hand, Saha et al. [46] obtained a much lower Mw and PD values, 1769 g mol−1 and 1.61, on the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with [EMIM][OAc], indicating that such IL was more efficient at lignin fractionation. Depending on the type of IL, it is possible to generate lignin fractions with different Mw/PD ranges that could be potentially tailored for future applications."
19,Conclusions,"Process parameter investigation with the PIL [MEA][OAc] paved the way for several novel features: a highly selective pretreatment that delignifies sugarcane bagasse but also preserves the carbohydrates; high solids loading, compatibility with water and a low dosage of cellulases during enzymatic saccharification of the pulps. Delignification efficiency was kept high — around 60% — throughout the experiments. Structural characterization of the recovered lignin revealed a wide variety of functional groups and moieties that could potentially add value to the sugarcane biorefinery."
