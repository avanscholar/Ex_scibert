0,Introduction,"Global fossil energy consumption has been gradually increasing environmental pollution [1]. Nowadays, the environment and energy have been put in the eternal subject of considerable global research and development over the past few decades [2]. Renewable energy sources are becoming essential for totally resolving the problems [3]. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising clean and sustainable energy carriers and emits only water as a byproduct without any carbon emissions [4]. Hydrogen has many attractive properties as a promising energy carrier and high energy. The global interest is rapidly refocused on hydrogen energy [5]. It is today’s research hotspot that the theme is focused on the intersection of the three hot issues - renewable energy, wastewater treatment and hydrogen production. So, this topic, linked in solar-enabled hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment, is exactly the research point in this paper. Hydrogen is a very clean carrier of energy in terms of the environmental impact of its use in zero emission. So far, the development of hydrogen energy has been programmed on the vital worldwide agenda [2]. Two present domains of the hydrogen production have scalably been operated by non-renewable energy and resources, covering the cracking fossil fuel hydrogen and water splitting hydrogen generated by the non-renewable energy [6]. The hydrogen productions are consuming a lot of non-renewable energy and resource. It is high time to seek alternative technology for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production. Therefore, the current target has been switched to renewable energy-powered water splitting to oxygen (O2) and hydrogen generation [7]. For the application of renewable energy, a representative exemplification was illustrated in the photocatalytic water splitting with a currently highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.1% [8]. However, the gap displayed that the overall solar efficiency water splitting has not been at most more than 10% [9]. Photovoltaic hydrogen production is an alternative way on the whole, which utilizes solar electricity, not solar heat, as the energy source to produce hydrogen. Nevertheless, it never exceeds the solar cell efficiency. Organics, especially small organic molecules, are mostly concerned with the organic pollutants in environmental water discharged by the chemical production sectors [10]. Due to their variety of toxicity, it is a very heavy load completely to minimize/mineralize the organic pollutants. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the treatment of organic pollutants by a variety of physical and chemical methods [11]. Until now, the photocatalytic oxidations have been extensively investigated with a less scalable application, but by listing most papers in recent publications [12]. The electrochemical methods are a promising technique for the resolution of environmental pollution with versatility, powerful oxidation, and high efficiency [13]. The small organic molecules are an active electron donor that can be electrochemically oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) on the anode [14]. The advanced electrochemical oxidation has employed the high efficient anodes, including dimensionally stable anode (DSA) and boron-doped diamond electrode [13]. Thus, the solar-driven electrochemical approach, only utilized electrons instead of chemicals, offers a sustainable energy-environmental strategy for the treatment of organic pollutants with simultaneous hydrogen production. For a representation of the electrochemical water splitting chemistry to hydrogen [5], the two-electrode reactions, occurred directly through electron transfer via an electron donor (H2O, water) on the anode and an electron acceptor (H+, hydrogen ion) on the cathode, can be ascribed to one overall reaction: H2O → 1/2 O2 + H2, the standard water-splitting potential Eo Rev = 1.229 V and Eo The = 1.481 V(SHE, 25℃), here, Eo Rev is reversible standard potential, Eo The is thermo-neutral standard potential, SHE is standard hydrogen electrode. The electrolytic water splitting can produce pure hydrogen at low temperature, but it is a very energy-intensive process due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requiring greater than 6 kWh electric power input per m3 of hydrogen produced [15]. In terms of thermodynamic energy considerations, the reversible voltage of the overall water electrolysis reaction is ERev = 1.229 V under the standard condition. However, the minimum voltage so-called thermo-neutral voltage required for the electrolysis process to start is EThe = 1.48 V, corresponding to 3.24 kWh m3 electric input under the standard condition [16]. The actual cell voltage required can be more than 1.5 V due to the electrode polarization and electrolyte resistance. As known, the high heat input favors the decrease of the electrolytic potential for the endothermic water-splitting chemistry. The potential could be reduced to<1.229 V (SHE, 25℃) under the high temperature. The lower potential is mostly facilitated for the energy-saving and efficiency elevation. So, in this paper, the solar thermal input is just for the sake of the realization of the goal was proposed innovatively. Another approach is to a switch of the anodic reaction with a low anodic potential donor, that is, a change of the electron donor. The low-potential shuttle-electron donor will easily be electrooxidized on the anode below the lower potential of φa = 1.229 V (SHE, 25℃). Currently, considerable contributions have been devoted to researching a novel water electrolysis system, so-called carbon/biomass assisted water electrolysis technologies, to efficiently produce hydrogen by utilizing carbon (C) sources such as hydrocarbon (carbon [17] and coal [18]), and biomass (glycerol [19], ethylene glycol [20], cellulose [21], etc.) The carbon/biomass assisted water electrolysis can significantly reduce the electric energy input for hydrogen production via the feed of solid coal/carbon particles or powder dispersed slurry [22]. Principally, the role of carbon and coal is based on the following reaction [23]: C + 2H2O → CO2 + 2H2 (Eo Rev = 0.21 V/Eo The = 0.46 V). The merit is that the applied potential can be remarkably reduced to 0.21 V as compared to 1.23 V for the conventional water electrolysis, as shown in the above. This system can reach the energy balance only around 40% electric input, with 60% harvesting from the chemical energy offered by carbon/hydrocarbon [23]. But, the dispersion and diffusion were affected by the insolubility of the solid carbon and insoluble biomass in the systems. In this design, the anodic potentials of soluble organics (φOrganics/CO2) in wastewater, such as small organic molecules - alcohol, aldehyde, acid, will be mostly lower than the φH2O/O2 in the sole water splitting. In that way, Eo Organics are estimated to be less than Eo water = 1.229 V. Therefore, the small organic molecules as anodic donors exactly match the alternative of the oxygen evolution reaction. The solar thermo-assisted electrochemical splitting of water plus organics would be expected to gain efficient production and clean water. Solar multifield-driven hybrid chemical process (also called the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process - STEP) has been successfully applied to many fields, such as organic synthesis [24], wastewater treatment [25], depolymerization of lignin [26]. The theory and practices have been entrusted in a clean, safe, and sustainable model. Based on the STEP framework, a solar system is originally designed for solar water splitting efficiently to produce hydrogen and treat wastewater, organically linking solar energy to hydrogen production and water treatment. In this paper, the redox model and thermodynamic calculation were first conducted for a motivation of totally elucidating the solar thermo-assisted and organic-donor alternated water splitting model and theory. The novel results were harvested for fully understanding the water splitting complex system and controlling the hydrogen production via the organic donor choice and temperature modulation."
1,Results and discussion,"The STEP is a solar multifield-driven hybrid chemical process. The solar-driven multifields, photo and electro and thermoenergy, initiate hybrid chemical processes, photochemical, electrochemical, and thermochemical reactions. Considering the distributions of the solar-to-photo, solar-to-thermal and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency, and differences of photochemical, electrochemistry, and thermochemistry for a specific molecular reaction, an exact coupling of the solar multifield with the hybrid chemical process can provide a comprehensive solution to the efficient utilization of solar energy for any chemical reaction. The goal is great to improve solar energy conversion, solar reaction efficiency, and solar product selectivity. This STEP process has been successfully practiced for the production of energetic molecules, the transformation of environmentally stable molecules, and the conversion of solar fuel and hydrogen."
2,The solar thermo-assisted electrochemical process framework for solar-driven thermal & donor modulated hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment,"2.1 The solar thermo-assisted electrochemical process framework for solar-driven thermal & donor modulated hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment The option of more solar heat and less electricity gains a higher solar utilization for an endothermic reaction. Furthermore, solar thermal input diminishes the energy required by the endothermic electrochemical reaction, and the reactants are lived to becoming the activation states. Energetically forbidden reactions become allowable forward for altering the chemical pathways. So, the STEP process can tune both solar multifields and the hybrid chemistry for synergistically matching solar spectrum and favorably balancing the photochemical, thermochemical, and electrochemical reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of the STEP and water splitting redox chemistry, solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment was constructed for the solar-driven water splitting to efficient hydrogen production and effective wastewater treatment. A schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 1 . Totally, sunlight is divided into three beams, serving the direct photo irradiation and indirect photo-to-electro and photo-to-thermo conversion. The three photo energies can initiate chemical reactions: the solar heat is used for preheating reaction or conducts the thermochemistry; the solar electricity is employed for the redox chemistry; the solar photo is directly irradiated for the photocatalysis. Among the reactions, the electrochemical reaction plays a dominant role in executing the oxidation/reduction reaction. For the electrolytic water splitting, H2O/organic molecules as a sacrificial reagent are oxidized on the anode to evolve hydrogen on the cathode. The organic molecules in wastewater will be continuously pumped to support the consumption in the system. It can be seen that the STEP framework, especially by the solar-driven thermal & donor modulation, can control and enhance the electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment. The STEP framework is included for two aspects of the solar-driven thermal effect and organic molecular donor modulation connected to the enhancement of both solar conversion and chemical efficiency. The high hydrogen production plus the organic molecular treatment will be adapted by the rational utilization of the solar heat and organic waste. In that way, the solar energy plus organic chemicals will offer a solution to a high challenge in energy, wastewater treatment and hydrogen production. Truly, it is a sustainable and green chemical process."
3,Redox model of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment,"2.2 Redox model of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment Nowadays, the chemistry of water splitting redox to hydrogen has been reported in detail. Water redox can occur directly through electron transfer between the anode and cathode. 2.2.1 Fundamentals of electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production For a redox reaction, the electrolytic potential Eo , can be calculated by Gibbs free energy ΔG°=-nFEo . Electrochemically, the smaller the value of the standard oxidation potentials, the easier it is for the element to be oxidized (losing electrons); in other words, they are better reducing agents. The redox model can be summarized for the direct electrochemical water splitting: On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (1) H 2 O → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e φ a o = 1 . 229V SHE , 25oC On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (1) 2 H + + 2 e → H 2 φ c o = 0.00 V SHE , 25oC Overall cell reaction: Overall: (3) H 2 O(l) = 1 2 O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Practically, (4) 1H2O + Electricity (237.2 KJ/mol) + Heat (48.6 KJ/mol) → H2 + 1/2O2 Splitting a mole of liquid water to produce a mole of hydrogen at 25℃ requires 285.8 kJ of energy − 237.2 kJ as electricity and 48.6 kJ as heat. The total energy is composed of both electrical and thermal energy known as enthalpy (ΔH). The electrical energy is known as the Gibbs free energy (ΔG). Irreversible energy or entropy (ΔS) is the energy cost of doing the chemical reaction, which is dependent on the temperature at which the reaction takes place. Consequently, the change value in these quantities in the standard condition follows the form: ΔH = ΔG + TΔS. So, the reversible standard potential Eo Rev-water = ΔG/nF = 273210/(2 × 96485) = 1.229 V (SHE, 25℃), and the thermo-neutral standard potential Eo The-water=(ΔG + ΔH)/nF = 285800/(2 × 96485) = 1.481 V (SHE, 25℃). The extra heat (48.6 kJ) is required for the practical electrolysis cell due to internal resistance. This heat requirement should be directly balanced by the supplied electricity. In other words, electricity-supplied 285.8 kJ, not 237.2 kJ is required to the water splitting, converted in the minimum cell potential 1.481 V, not 1.229 V, from the electricity source. The analysis arises a good idea that the electrical energy (VRev = 1.229 V) can be supplied by the solar electro-energy while the thermal energy (48.6 kJ) does by the solar electro-energy for filling the requirement of 285.8 kJ of energy (EThe = 1.48 V). Furthermore, the high heat will cause a fall in electrical energy (ERev ). It is a reasonable approach to achieve the high efficiency of electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen. 2.2.2 Redox model of electrochemical water plus organics splitting to hydrogen and wastewater treatment The hydrogen production by sole water electrolysis has revealed a clear redox reaction. It is a complicated system for the chemical process of adding other molecules. First of all, all the chemical reactions should be considered on the anode and cathode. According to the comparison of the redox potentials, the prevailing or domain reactions can be determined in the system. The following equations summarize the redox models and electrolytic potentials of electrochemical water plus organics splitting, (a) Redox model of the complete reaction of formic acid (HCOOH) in aqueous solution On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (5) HCOOH (l) → CO2 (g) + 2H+ (l) + 2e − On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (6) 2H+ + 2e − → H2 Overall cell reaction: (7) HCOOH (l) = CO2 (g) + H2 (g) (8) E Re v - O r g 1 o = 0.170 V SHE , 25 o C (b) Redox model of the complete reaction of formaldehyde (HCHO) in aqueous solution On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (9) HCHO(g) + H2O(l) → CO2 (g) + 4H+ (l) + 4e − On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (10) 4H+ + 4e − → 2H2 (11) Overall cell reaction: HCHO(g) + H2O(l) = CO2 (g) + 2H2 (g) (12) E Re v - O r g 2 o = 0.121 V SHE , 25 o C (c) Redox model of the complete reaction of methanol (CH3OH) in aqueous solution On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (13) CH3OH(l) + H2O(l) → CO2 (g) + 6H+ (l) + 6e− On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (14) 6H+ + 6e − → 3H2 Overall cell reaction: (15) CH3OH(l) + H2O(l) = CO2 (g) + 3H2(g) (16) E Re v - O r g 3 o = - 0.016 V SHE , 25 o C (d) Redox model of the complete reaction of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in aqueous solution On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (17) CH3COOH(l) + 2H2O(l) → 2CO2 (g) + 8H+ (l) + 8e− On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (18) 8H+ + 8e − → 4H2 Overall cell reaction: (19) CH3COOH(l) + 2H2O(l) = 2CO2 (g) + 4H2(g) (20) E Re v - O r g 4 o = - 0.089 V SHE , 25 o C (e) Redox model of the complete reaction of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) in aqueous solution. On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (21) CH3CHO(l) + 3H2O(l) → 2CO2 (g) + 10H + (l) + 10e − On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (22) 10H + + 10e − → 5H2 Overall cell reaction: (23) CH3CHO(l) + 3H2O(l) = 2CO2(g) + 5H2(g) E Re v - O r g 5 o = - 0.052 V SHE , 25 o C (f) Redox model of the complete reaction of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) in aqueous solution On the anode, an electron donor reacts: (25) CH3CH2OH(l) + 3H2O(l) → 2CO2(g) + 12H+ (l) + 12e − On the cathode, an electron acceptor reacts: (26) 12H+ + 12e − → 6H2 Overall cell reaction: (27) CH3CH2OH(l) + 3H2O(l) = 2CO2 (g) + 6H2(g) (28) E Re v - O r g 6 o = - 0.085 V SHE , 25 o C Table 1 summarizes the ΔG° and E° of the equations of the electrochemical splitting of water plus alternative donors. The data demonstrate that all the chemical equations are E Re v o < 0 except formic acid and formaldehyde, whose processes are nonspontaneous. The E Re v o values can be converted to the applied electrolytic cell potential E cell o for a clear indication of the dramatic reduction of the required cell potential via a switch of the alternative. The composition reaction of small organic molecules (Organics → CO2 + H2O, ΔG° = −46 to 97 kJ/mol) is thermodynamically less stringent compared with the water-splitting reaction ( H 2 O(l) = 1 2 O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) , ΔG° = 273.2 kJ/mol). Due to the potential variation of the anodic half-reaction, obviously, φoa-Organics < φoa-H2O, the anodic half-reaction of H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e − (OER, φoa = 1.229 V) is replaced by the anodic reaction the easily oxidized organics (organics → CO2 + H2O + ne−, φoa < 0.10 V). As a result, the E cell - O r g a n i c s o is less than the direct E cell - H 2 O o . The less applied potential will primarily reduce the electric power input of produced hydrogen (requiring less than 6 kWh/m3). It is noted that even if they are all organic compounds, different functional groups, such as organic alcohol, aldehyde, acid, show the different potentials (Eo cell). The carbon number of organics also affects the potential. The C1 organics display the potentials less than the C2 organic compounds, such as methanol (0.016 V)/ethanol (0.085 V) and formic acid (−0.017 V)/acetic acid (0.098 V). On the basis of the thermodynamic data, the remarkable modulation of the potential can be subjected to the alternative of proper electron donors for the control of the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, the feed of the organics switches the smooth pathway of hydrogen production from the water splitting to the elimination of organics in wastewater with a small applied voltage and high efficiency. Plus the high heat operated by the STEP process, this offer is that the actual electrolysis potential can be significantly decreased to less than o.6 V in comparison to 1.5 V for the conventional water electrosplitting reaction."
4,Theoretical calculation of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment,"2.3 Theoretical calculation of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment In this section, a method is introduced for the theoretical calculation. The integrated classical chemical thermodynamic equations are combined with the solar-driven thermal & donor modulated redox. The results are presented for each prevailing reaction or domain in the thermal effect on the applied potential. 2.3.1 Method of theoretical calculation As known, the water-splitting redox is an endothermic reaction. The solar-thermal coupling can reduce the energy required for the water electrolytic reaction, which is manifested in the fall of the electrolytic potential. For a general chemical equation, A + B = C + D, the calculation of the thermo-dependent cell potential (ERev ) can be determined by using the entropy S, enthalpy H, and free-energy G according to the thermodynamic equation: ΔH = ΔG + TΔS. In the standard condition (T = 25℃, P = 1 atm), an electrolytic cell Eo Rev must be deduced from Gibbs free energy ΔGo by the following equation: (29) E Re v o = - Δ G o / n F Where n is the number of transferring electron moles per mole product, and F is the Faraday constant, 96,485C/mol. The primary thermodynamic data are searched in the NIST Chemistry WebBook. In the above equation, Eo Rev is the standard electrode potential (SEP) of the reaction. The SEP can judge whether an electrochemical reaction occurs spontaneously. If Eo Rev ＞0, the reaction can occur spontaneously without an external electric field, while if Eo Rev ＜0, the reaction is nonspontaneous. Principally, at any electrolytic temperature and unit activity, the electrolytic reaction has an electrochemical potential of ERev . The value can be calculated by using the fixed thermodynamic data. Such a process can be identified by the negative isothermal temperature coefficient of the cell potential [27]. The (dE/dT)isoth coefficient is the derivative of the electromotive force for the isothermal cell. The isothermal coefficient can be obtained from the electrolytic potential of a constant temperature cell: (30) dE / d T isoth = Δ S / n F = ( Δ H - Δ G ) / n F T For a non-standard condition, ΔH° and ΔS° needs to be calculated: (31) Δ H o = Δ H 298 o + ∫ 298 T Δ C p Δ d T (32) Δ S o = Δ S 298 o + ∫ 298 T Δ C p / T d T Here: (33) Δ C p = ∑ i n i Δ C p By using the 298 K data of the reactants and products, the integral constant value of ΔH°298 and ΔS°298 , were gained, so for any standard enthalpy change ΔH° and entropy change ΔS°, and then for any Gibbs energy ΔG°, the standard electrode potential Ecell under arbitrary temperature was finally obtained. Because Ecell = − Eo Rev , the cell voltage Ecell could be gained from the electrolytic cell reaction. The temperature variation of redox potentials and electrochemical mobilities can be significant. The standard data such as the NIST thermochemical data was set to determine E° at unit activity. The activity coefficient variation can be substantial in aqueous media. The potential variation is derived by activity, a = [concentration] × [activity coefficient], for each of the reactants and products of the electrolysis reaction [28]. 2.3.2 Results and analysis of theoretical calculation For a demonstration of solar thermo-assisted action on the water splitting, the temp-dependent potentials were calculated in the range of 25–100 °C according to the redox models of the water and alternative organics splitting to hydrogen. The curves are drawn for the temp-dependent potentials of the pure water and water-plus-organics to CO2 in the aqueous solution in Fig. 2 (a) to Fig. 2(g). Electrolytic splitting of pure water The error analysis was carried out by using differences of the theoretical value - standard Gibbs energy ΔG° (considered as the real value from standard manual data) and the calculated value (from the above equations), as well as the calculated values E cell by the classical electrochemical thermodynamic equation. The absolute errors E cell of the 7 reactions were calculated at −0.0018 V (formic acid), 0.0062 V (formaldehyde), −0.00069 V (methanol), 0 V (water), −6.1E-05 V (acetic acid), −0.00021 V (acetaldehyde) and −0.00011 V (ethanol). All the calculated curves indicate a negative temperature coefficient, that is, the electrolytic potentials of the reactions decrease with increasing the temperature, resulting in a remarkable gap from 25℃ to 100℃. The elevated thermal input is favorable for hydrogen evolution and organic oxidation (organics → CO2 + H2O). The data have elucidated that the solar heat can be applied to the system for lowering the applied potential and activating the organic molecules for favorable hydrogen evolution and organic oxidation. This effect offers a theoretical basis for the solar thermo-assisted process to efficient hydrogen production and complete oxidation of the organics beyond the occurrence of toxic intermediates. The curves display that the redox reaction is switched and the electrolytic potential was altered by the donor modulation (the addition of the organic molecules). The electrolytic potentials of the organics (Fig. 2-b to f) are less than the one of the sole water (Fig. 2-a). The modulation is advantageous to lowering the electrolysis voltage and enhancing the hydrogen production. Based on the above thermodynamic curves, the comparative diagram of the temp-dependant theoretical electrolytic potentials is plotted in Fig. 3 . The figure demonstrates that the electrolytic potentials are indeed declined for these endothermic reactions by the action of both elevated temperature and organics feed. The minimum cell voltage of the conventional water electrolysis is enormously more than the one of the solar thermal and organics donor assisted electrolytic water splitting, the solar system can be driven effectively to produce hydrogen in low consumption of the electrolysis energy via the decreased potential operation. Therefore, remodifying the redox model of electrolytic water splitting was shown in the following scheme: On the anode, the half-reaction of an electron donor: Possibly, (34) H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H++2e − φoa-H2O = 1.229 V (SHE, 25 °C) (35) Organics → CO2 + nH+ + ne − φoa-Organics = < 0.6 V (SHE, 25 °C) Comparably, (36) φ a - H 2 O o > φ a - O r g a n i c s o Prevailingly, (37) Organics → CO2 + nH+ + ne − On the cathode, the half-reaction of an electron acceptor: (38) 2 H + + 2 e → H 2 φ c o = 0.00 V SHE , 25 o C Overall cell reaction: (39) Overall: H2O + Organics → H2 + CO2 Eo cell = < 0.6 V (SHE, 25 °C) Resultantly, the thermo-assisted and organics alternated effects are to (40) H2O + Electricity (<237.2 KJ/mol from solar electro) + Heat (˃48.6 KJ/mol from solar thermo) → H2 + 1/2O2 So, the electricity was reduced by a combination of the high temperature and organics alternated effects. The heat is replaced by the solar heat, rather than supplied by the electricity."
5,Illustration and application of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment,"2.4 Illustration and application of solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment Electrolytic splitting water to hydrogen production and water treatment are generally considered as energy consuming processes. If the conventional energy is adopted for two operations, it will cost a lot and pollute the environment seriously. Using solar energy is an inevitable, renewable and environmentally friendly way. This is exactly a motivation of this research. In this research, the solar energy dominates a certain functional role in the electrochemical reaction. The easily converted solar heat has a certainly assisted effect on the chemical oxidation with the high heat supply. The combination of solar heat can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy and the yield of chemical reaction. Most of the small molecule organics are organic pollutants in wastewater. It is very difficult fully to treat them by the conventional methods with high consume energy. However, the small molecule organics essentially demonstrate a low redox potential. They can be preferentially oxidized on the anode. If included in wastewater and fed to the electrolysis cell, they are easy to be oxidized. The oxidation of the small molecule organics transfers a certain amount of energy to the hydrogen production. So, the anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction can be switched and regulated. Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is the most energy consuming because of its high electrolysis voltage. If organic small molecules are added, it is easy to control the anodic reactions and decrease the electrolysis voltage. In this study, high temperature effect and organic compound addition can reduce the electrolysis voltage was confirmed, which is powerful for hydrogen production and organic oxidation. So, the data of six organic molecules and temperature effect the accurately designing the water splitting complex system, precisely controlling the hydrogen production efficiency, and effectively treating the organic wastewater via the organic donor choice and temperature modulation in basis of the actual conditions and available organics. For a full understanding of the system, the future application is expanded for the solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment. The system consists of the solar tower for PV module array (electricity) and condensed thermal collector (heat) to supply the reactor. According to the organics data and availability in wastewater, as well as the operating facilities, the solar thermal input will be employed for heating the wastewater, and the solar electricity will be conducted to drive the electrolysis with the precise voltage shown in the data. The systems will be operated in an optimal condition by modeling and following the data."
6,Conclusions,"In this study, a solar system of thermal & donor-modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment was constructed efficiently for hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. For totally elucidating the solar thermo-assisted and organic donor-alternated water splitting system, the redox model and thermodynamic calculation were conducted in this paper. (1) The redox models fully demonstrate that the prevailing and dominant reactions occur in the alternative of the organic molecular donors, fed in soluable small organic molecules such as small organic molecular alcohol, aldehyde, acid. (2) Due to the potential variation of the anodic half-reaction, obviously, φ a - O r g a n i c s o < φ a - H 2 O o , the anodic half-reaction of (H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−, OER, φo a = 1.229 V) is replaced by the dominant anodic reaction of the organics (Organics → CO2 + nH+ + ne−, φ a o <0.60 V). As a result, the E cell - O r g a n i c s o is less than the direct E cell - H 2 O o . The less applied potential will primarily reduce the electric power input of produced hydrogen (requiring<6 kWh/m3). (3) The thermodynamic calculation illustrates that the electrolytic potential is sharply reduced by a switch of the anodic reaction by an alternative of the organic electron donor as compared to the direct electrochemical water splitting. (4)The calculated thermo-dependent potentials reveal that the thermo-assisted effect results in a negative temperature coefficient to the cell potential. Therefore, both thermal assistance and organic donor alternation give fall to the cell potential (from 1.229 V to 0.40–0.6 V) and switch to the oxygen evolution reaction to the anodic oxidation of organic molecules. The operated cell potential is predicted reasonably mostly less e than the applied voltage required for the endothermic water-splitting redox (˃1.5 V). The study theoretically proves that the water-splitting redox chemistry can be modulated by solar highly thermal input and organic donor-alternative. The novel results were harvested for fully understanding the water splitting complex system and controlling the hydrogen production via the organic donor choice and temperature modulation. The data could offer the support for solar enabled hydrogen production and water treatment by a model of a solar multifiled-driven hybrid chemical system."
