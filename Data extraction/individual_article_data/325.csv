0,Introduction,"Sunlight is one of the most invaluable sources of renewable energy. But the abundant solar photons reaching Earth's surface need to be converted into chemical energy vectors, such as hydrogen (H2), before being used as fuel. H2 is a promising vector due to its high energetic content. But today, H2 is still produced via costly fossil fuel-based processes hindering its widespread acceptance. Solar photons can also be converted to H2 through photocatalysis. However, the search for high-performing photocatalytic materials has yet to produce a reliable alternative to fossil fuel-based processes. Improving materials' performances will thus play a key important role in reducing production costs and stimulating the development of the hydrogen economy. The state-of-the-art in H2 photo-assisted production is the use of rational design strategies, such as plasmonic metal/semiconductor (M/SC) Schottky junctions and semiconductor/semiconductor (SC1/SC2) Z-scheme heterojunctions. Both are promising approaches for synthesizing multi-phase composites with enhanced solar energy conversions. However, to accomplish cost-efficient nanostructures, some challenges need to be addressed. For instance, many new studies on this field fail to report key photocatalytic aspects leading to an added difficulty in standardizing and comparing results obtained by different groups, and hampering the identification of key functional properties in each component of the hybrid composites. In this review, we highlight the role of H2 as the key energy vector in our efforts to reduce the environmental footprint and prevent energy shortages by closing the energy loop and transforming our current model in a circular economy. Besides, an overview of recent state-of-the-art H2 production technologies is included, highlighting photocatalysis as the core technology for efficient and sustainable solar energy conversion and the principles photocatalytic water splitting and H2 storage/distribution are also covered. Case studies of plasmonic Au-based Schottky junctions on three SC support systems are included: TiO2, gC3N4, and TiO2-gC3N4. TiO2 and gC3N4 SCs are benchmark and emergent visible-light-driven photocatalysts, respectively. Hence, their heterojunction, named Z-scheme, is predicted to be beneficial for photocatalytic applications. Relevant studies will be presented and aspects of material synthesis procedures, key properties, and efficiency in H2 production via water splitting, will be critically discussed. Gold (Au) is also introduced as an outstanding metal due to its peculiar physical and chemical properties able to enhance SCs photocatalytic activities in the order of 10–100 times compared to SC's efficiencies alone [1]."
1,Energy and climate contexts,"1.1 Energy and climate contexts Population growth, unsustainable lifestyle, and dependency on fossil fuels have been the key culprits of the present energy and environmental crisis. World's population is predicted to increase by 40–50% within the next decades, rising to over 9 billion people by 2050 [2,3]. A trend expected to exacerbate the current energy demand and lead to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves (oil, coal, and natural gas [2,4]) within the next 80 years (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). But the search for alternative energy sources only gained traction during the first oil crisis in the 1970s [8,9], influenced by M. King Hubbert predictions of global warning and the imminent depletion of the Earth's oil reserves [10–12]. Today, it is well established that fossil fuels are the main actors in the climate change crisis [13] marked by the flagrant rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions [6,14,15] and Earth's surface temperature by 0.9 °C in 2020 [7]. The crisis has prompted the development of renewable energies, such as tidal, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, and solar energy [2,5,8,16,17]. Among these, solar has always been considered the most promising solution [5,8,18] (Fig. 3 a) since only a small fraction of the solar irradiation (0,04%, 36,000 TW) is expected to supply current and future global energy demand (16 TW in 2009 and 28 TW by 2050) (Fig. 3b) [19]. The vast potential of solar power has been driving the development of a wide range of solar energy systems. While photovoltaic and concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies have already been successfully scaled up for commercial applications, alternative technologies such as H2 production via water splitting still need to be improved."
2,Hydrogen,"1.2 Hydrogen The signature of the Paris agreement in 2016 has put in motion a series of global and European strategies to support the hydrogen economy. SUNERGY is one of the most ambitious results of the agreement. A large-scale research and experimental development (R&D) initiative gathering experts from academia, industry, and politics and aiming to decarbonize industry and society by 2050 [20]. The European Commission has also launched an unprecedented call Green Deal to foster innovation and advance the transition to a clean and circular economy [21]. H2 is the simplest and lightest of all existing elements, and the most abundant chemical element in the universe [22]. On Earth, H2 is not readily available but mostly present in combination with other elements, such as water (H2O), hydrocarbons, or organic matter [23], due to its flammable nature and ease of reaction with other chemical substances. H2 can serve as fuel either for direct combustion in an internal combustion engine or fuel cell, producing only water as the only by-product and no greenhouse gases (CO2) [24,25]. Today, H2 is mainly obtained from natural gas (48%), hydrocarbons (30% from heavy oils and naphtha), and coal (18%) [26]. Approximately half of its production is employed on the Haber-Bosch process to obtain ammonia (NH3) and ammonium based-fertilizers. Another significant use of H2 is in oil refinery, namely in cracking long-chain into light hydrocarbons (hydrocracking process), in removing sulfur or nitrogen from petroleum products (HDS - hydrodesulfurization and HDN hydrodenitrogenation processes) and aromatic compounds from complex mixtures (dearomatization). Hydrogen is used also in the hydrogenation reaction (e.g., oil to margarine process) and, in lesser extent, as rocket propellant [4,25,27]. 1.2.1 Energy vector H2 has the highest heating value of all existing fuels per mass unit (142 kJ/mol). Compared to conventional fossil fuels, it possesses two to three times more energy content than methane (55 kJ/mol), propane (50.3 kJ/mol), gasoline (45.8 kJ/mol), and natural gas (47.2 kJ/mol) (Fig. 4 ) [27,28]. The major challenges in the widespread adoption of H2 as an energy vector stem from the low availability of its molecular form, lack of sustainable production technologies, and hindrances in storage and transportation [29]. In contrast, the non-polluting nature of H2 by-products, the abundance of sources, and high heating value is expected to drive the demand for this energy vector and consequently decrease its production costs propelling the transition to an H2-driven economy (Fig. 5 ). A trend that has intensified since the 1980s due to the progressive depletion of fossil fuels and socio-economic instability in the Middle East [31]. 1.2.2 Production processes Hydrogen can be produced using conventional or alternative processes that either use raw materials, such as fossil fuels, or renewable resources such as water. There are currently four processes of H2 production (Fig. 6 ), with the conversion from fossil fuels responsible for 96% of all the produced H2 and the electrolysis of water accounting for only 4%. Typically, fossil fuels are converted to H2 through reforming or pyrolysis with natural gas steam reforming as the dominant technology. Currently, this energy-intensive and pollutant process, supplies most of the global H2 demand (95%) [33], thus dictating the global production costs of this fuel. Commonly, there are three types of conventional hydrocarbon reforming methods, depending on the employed reactant (Fig. 7 ): 1 Steam reforming 2 Partial oxidation 3 Autothermal reforming On a smaller scale, biomass and water are the major renewable sources of H2. The biomass processes can be divided into three types, ca. thermochemical, biological, and emerging steam reforming of bioethanol [34,35]. Whilst water splitting techniques can be classified by their input activation source (Fig. 7): 1 Direct electrolysis (electricity) 2 Thermolysis (temperature) 3 Photolysis (light) 4 Al-H2O reaction (corrosion of aluminum in alkaline media) [36–38]. 5 Photo-(electro) catalysis (light and/or electricity) For storage and transportation, H2 is compressed into gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid tankers, pipelines, or tubes and stored at approximately 250 bar, creating two important challenges: (i) the high cost of the infrastructure [41] and (ii) the predicted leakage of 10% [42] during storage (ii). Conventional cylinders and tanks used for storage are made of heavy-weight steel with a high internal amount of compressed H2 (15.6 kg at 200 bar). The high weight significantly increases transportation costs compared to other fuels such as oil [41]. Moreover, the high pressure imposes a heavy regulation to ensure safe transport. For example, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) allows a maximum 560–720 kg of H2 per truck in national routes [43]. In this context, adopting composite storage vessels with lower weights may be a foreseeable solution. Additionally, H2 leakage is predicted to have a negative impact in the ozone layer. Being lighter than air (0.0899 kg m−3 at 0 °C and 1 bar), H2 can rapidly dissipate and reach the troposphere where 90% of Earth's ozone is found [44]. At this altitude, H2 may react with ozone, potentially contributing to widening the ozone hole [45]. To address these concerns, an alternative storage solution for H2 can be found in its conjugation with captured CO2 resulting in small hydrocarbon liquids, which are easier to store and transport [46]."
3,Principles of photocatalysis and introduction to plasmonic photocatalysis,"1.3 Principles of photocatalysis and introduction to plasmonic photocatalysis Photocatalysis is a specific type of heterogeneous catalysis [47], requiring light instead of heat (as usual in thermal catalysis) to diminish the activation energy barrier of chemical reactions. The word photocatalysis first appeared in the pioneering work of Doerffler and Hauffe (1964) to describe the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) using a combination of ZnO and light [48]. To date, the most well-studied photocatalyst is TiO2, mainly in its anatase form. The ideal photocatalytic mechanism comprises five general steps (Fig. 8 ): (1) Diffusion of the reactants from the liquid phase to the photocatalyst's surface (2) Adsorption of the reactants to the surface of the photocatalyst (3) Catalyst activation by absorption of photons from the SC. This step can be divided into 4 sub-steps: (3-a) Photons absorption and exciton generation (3-b) Exciton disruption into e− (in the SC's conduction band, CB) and h+ (in the SC's valence band, VB) (3-c) Migration of the charge carriers (e−/h+) to the surface. In this step, if the charge carriers are in the bulk instead of the SC's surface, recombination is triggered, a process known to hamper the activity of the photocatalysts (3-d) Surface oxidation and reduction reactions with adsorbed chemical species (4) Desorption of the products and reactants (5) Diffusion of the products from the photocatalyst surface to the liquid phase Steps 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent to those observed in thermally activated catalysis. Yet, step 3, comprising the redox reaction, is unique to the photocatalytic process. Over the last decades, photocatalytic systems have been developed for environmental and energetic applications to oxidize a large variety of organic (alkanes, alcohols, carboxylic acids, sulfur, and nitrogen-containing products and others) and inorganic (CO, NH3, H2S, and others) molecules. For environmental applications, the process has found extensive use in water and air purification by degrading contaminants via highly reactive radicals, such as hydroxyl OH˙ or superoxide O2 ˙, or directly via the h+ ion. Ideally, these reactions lead to the total mineralization of organics and partial decomposition of some inorganic pollutants (not oxidant conditions) (NO2, SO2, and others). Photocatalysis has also found application as an air or water disinfection process since microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, spores) are a complex mixture of organic molecules which can be oxidized via the same highly reactive radicals [49–51]. Recently, efforts in this area have been focused on developing photocatalytic coatings or other functionalized surfaces [52–54]. In an energy context, water splitting for H2 production and CO2 reduction to mitigate our carbon footprint are the two main application of photocatalysis [55,56]. Recently, plasmonic photocatalysis has risen as an attractive alternative for efficient light harvesting [57]. It differs from conventional SC materials because it uses metallic (M) nanoparticles (NPs) (e.g., Au, Pt, Pd, Ag, Cu, etc) on the surface of a photocatalyst (e.g., TiO2, gC3N4, ZnO, etc) to enhance photoactivity. In plasmonics, parameters such as the NP material type, size and morphology, inter-particle spacing, metal loading, surrounding medium, pH, and temperature, are known to influence efficiency [57,58]. Critical aspects and progress in plasmonic photocatalysis will be covered in section 2."
4,Water splitting,"1.4 Water splitting Water splitting (WS) refers to the chemical dissociation of water into H2 and O2. In turn, solar “artificial WS” is used to describe the dissociation of water by an artificial light source. The generation of solar fuels mimics the natural process of photosynthesis not only in the nature of the redox reactions but also in terms of thermodynamics (water splitting 1.23 eV vs. glucose formation: 1.24 eV) (Fig. 9 ). Due to its tri-component nature (a light source to activate the SC; the SC to photo-generate the e−/h+ pair; and water as the reactant), WC is considered one of the cleanest paths to solar power generation. But despite the simplicity of its underlying principle, the photon-to-product conversion ratios are widely dependent on multiple photophysical, mass transfer, and chemical processes. WS is an endothermic reaction, in theory, it requires a potential of 1.23 V to take place. But in practice, energy losses are unavoidable, due to dispersion caused by to the medium's ionic strength or kinetic overpotential. For this reason, the real potential necessary to effectively split a water molecule ranges between 2 and 2.4 V [59]. Two approaches are recurrently used for WS: photocatalysis and photo (electro) chemistry. Both comprise two major steps: a) catalyst activation which takes place when the irradiating photons has an equal or greater energy than the SC's bandgap (Eg) and b) interface reactions on the surface of the catalyst [60] (Fig. 10 , equation (1)). (1) S C + h v → e C B − + h V B + In photo (electro) catalytic water splitting, this initial step (step 1, Fig. 10) is followed by the relaxation of the exciton. After overcoming the binding energy determined by the electronic structure, the exciton separates (step 2, Fig. 10) into e− and h+, which then move independently to the bottom of the Conduction Band (CB or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) or the top of the Valence Band (VB or highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO), respectively. When each species starts its migration, the carriers diffuse and are transported (step 3–4, Fig. 10) to the interface of the catalyst. An interface loss is inherent to the SC/catalyst/electrolyte system due to the different electronic barriers that both the e− and h+ must overcome to reach the surface. Successful charge transfer and diffusion occur within microseconds of photon irradiation. At this stage, the driving force is the difference in chemical potentials and Fermi levels (overpotential (V)) between the e− and the h+ that drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, equation (2)) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, equation (3)) consisting of the two essential WS half-reactions happening on the surface of the catalyst. These electrocatalytic redox reactions are limited by the mass transfer phenomenon (step 6, Fig. 10), happening when the reactant approaches the exposed active sites of the catalyst. In optimal conditions, the OER half-reaction (equation (2)), occurring in the anode, consists of the oxidation of water generating O2 in the presence of the photogenerated h+. As a result, a proton is also produced serving as the reactant in the HER half-reaction in the cathode (equation (3)). (2) H 2 O + 2 h V B + → 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + (3) 2 H + + 2 e C B − → H 2 To obtain high water splitting efficiencies, the selection of adequate components such as SC photocatalyst, additional bias, co-catalyst, and sacrificial donor/acceptor, is critical. Ideally, the SC used in WC should present two properties: (i) a VB with higher electrochemical potential than the O2/H2O redox couple, to guarantee the oxidation of H2O into O2 and H+, and (ii) a CB with lower electrochemical potential than the H+/H2 redox couple, to guarantee proton reduction and generation of H2. Besides the adequate SC band energy alignment (CB and VB), another important requirement is the magnitude of its Eg. Ideally the SC should be able to efficiently absorb a wide range of wavelengths from the visible and near infrared spectrum mimicking the standard solar spectrum reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. If the SC is unable to absorb photons in this spectrum, a sensitization method can be applied to increase photon absorption range. However, finding an SC with this broad absorption range remains an important challenge in this field. In contrast, in the photocatalytic configuration both half-reactions occur in the same reactor (single compartment). Thus, the global process of WS remains difficult to perform and control when a single SC is used. For this reason, the addition of a co-catalyst (e.g., a metal) is often required to act as an electron trap site and to increase charge separation (e−/h+ pairs) [30,55,56]. Additionally, a sacrificial electron donor or electron acceptor molecule is often used to limit the back reaction between the newly generated O2 and H2 molecules. Due to these technical constraints, it is often useful to study and separately optimize each half-reaction to design suitable materials for photocatalytic WS."
5,Monometallic nanostructure: gold (Au),"In the seminal lecture of Michael Faraday back in 1857, he reported achieving the synthesis of colloidal Au NPs via phosphorous-based reduction for the first time. By further studying the response of these Au NPs to light, Faraday discovered that the size of Au NPs heavily influenced their resulting optical properties [62]. Soon after, the synthesis of Au NPs became widespread and studies bloomed fostered by the development of Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). In 1945, microscopic technologies finally achieved a resolution of 2 nm, enabling new types of morphological analysis of metallic systems and visualization of individual heavy atoms and atomic lattice spacing [63]. As a consequence, the study and application of Au NPs grew exponentially in multiple fields, such as nanomedicine, bio-imaging, sensing, quantum optics, analytical sciences, photovoltaics, solar cells, and heterogeneous catalysis, among others [64]. All protocols of colloidal Au synthesis can be divided into top-down or bottom-up strategies. The first consists of the systematic rupture of the bulk state Au down to Au NPs of smaller dimensions. Whereas, the bottom up relies on the formation of Au NPs coming from individual molecules, involving chemical or biological reduction [65]. The reduction methods comprise two sequential steps, i.e., nucleation and growth. The so-called in situ synthesis applies when both nucleation and growth occur at the same stage. On the contrary, if the two steps occur separately, it is referred as the seed-growth method. Undoubtedly, both in situ and seed-growth methods have advantages and disadvantages. Whereof, the major advantage of seed-growth method is the possibility of synthesizing Au NPs controlling shape and size, whilst the top-down strategy only limited control can be exerted in these properties of the NPs. Therefore, in a rational design strategy, the method needs to be selected according to the requirements of the final application. In 1951, John Turkevich further advanced Faraday's discoveries of colloidal Au synthesis by clarifying the nucleation and growth aspects [66]. In his studies, he reported the reaction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) with trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7), acting both as reductant and nucleating agent. The reaction resulted in colloidal gold micelles with sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Later in 1973, Frens revisited the Turkevich method by varying the concentration of Na3C6H5O7, which caused size variations in the gold micelles (15–150 nm). Thus, Frens concluded that controlling the trisodium citrate to Au ratio further influenced the number of nuclei which grew to form particles [67]. In the following years, several improvements were achieved on the Turkevich-Frens method. The seed-growth methodology was proposed by Schmid et al. in 1981 with Au55-phosphine cluster to control more precisely the size of the NPs [68]. Due to the use of phosphorus based ligand-stabilized Au NPs, the functionalization and preparation of bimetallic cores of Au NPs was thus possible [69,70]. Schmid's cluster, his greatest achievement, was based on [Au55(PPh3)12Cl6] (PPh3 represents triphenylphosphine) and exhibited a very narrow dispersity with quantum-dot particle properties [71]. In 2000, Weare and Hutchison [70] further improved Schmid's method by introducing stronger reducing agents such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and N(C8H15)4Br in water-toluene. In 2001, Sau et al. proposed a two-step seed grow method [72] to improve stability of small NPs. Firstly, using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and varying the Au ion to stabilizer/reductant ratio (TX-100), small particles (ca. 5–20 nm) were formed. Followed by non-iterative seed-mediated growth of the initial NPs with ascorbic acid, particles with 20–110 nm were obtained [73–75]. In 1994, Brust-Schiffrin introduced the water/toluene two-phase method. Such a method included redox reagents in the two reaction phases, a phase-transfer agent, and a protected reductant agent, which created a complex reaction medium. The thiolate-stabilizer provided a good control of Au sizes (1–3 nm) during in situ condition [76]. The success of Brust-Schiffrin was mainly to (I) room temperature reaction condition (II) moderate thermal and oxidation resistance (III) no decomposition or aggregation after re-dissolving (IV) easy functionalization (V) Au NPs with size of ≤5 nm with cuboctahedral and icosahedral shapes [77]. In the following years, advancements on the Brust-Schiffrin method were achieved. By comparing the main abovementioned methods, the strength of reducing agent in Brust-Schiffrin is stronger than that of citrate sodium in Turkevich reaction. Yet, thanks to Marcus theory, reaction rates formation of Au NPs in presence of NaBH4 are faster and the size of the NPs is smaller than those obtained with the Turkevich method. However, one drawback of using Brust-Schiffrin method is the added purification step before separation. Nonetheless, the desired application of the SCs should dictate the type of protocol used for its production. For more exhaustive details about the development of Au synthesis protocols, please refer to additional references [77–79]."
6,Au properties,"2.1 Au properties Noble and coinage metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Ag, Cu, and Ni) are frequently used as co-catalysts in photocatalytic reactions owing to both their capacity to extract the photogenerated electrons of the SC (electronic property) and their ability for light harvesting in the visible and near infrared (IR) spectrum (optical property), acting as antennas [57,64,80]. One key criteria to select the most efficient metal is its noble nature [40,81]. In this context, platinum is by far the highest efficient co-catalyst [82], yet its high cost has limited its use. In contrast, Au due to its unique properties, is a popular alternative to reduce catalyst costs without harming the catalytic efficiency. Au behaves peculiarly due to quantum size effects [83], charge transfer to and from the support [84], oxygen spill-over [85], high resistance to oxidation [86], and to the role of low-coordinated Au atoms [87]. In catalysis, Au has a special status, but has recently received much attention in photocatalysis and optoelectronics [88]. This preference can be explained by its outstanding electronical and optical properties like a high work function (Φ) ca. 5.0–5.1 eV [89] under ultra-high vacuum, atomically clean (no impurities), and dielectric constant (ε) [81] which depends on the refraction index (η) according with Drude's (more details in section 2.1.3). However, these properties are susceptible to significant due to the influence of internal or external elements in the resulting electronic and optical structure. For this reason, it is recommended to be highly critical when reporting surface-related properties. 2.1.1 Electron trapping function Schottky junctions allow the unidirectional and irreversible migration of the photoexcited e− from the CB of the SC towards the M NP in an upward band bending configuration. At this stage, the intimate interface M/SC provides a concurrent acceleration of both charge separation and transfer and the M NP acts an electron trapping site [90]. The advantage of Schottky junctions and corresponding electronic concepts will be covered in section 2.2. 2.1.2 Co-catalyst Metals in general can act as surface sites [91] and as charge-trap centers [58] to capture the photoexcited e− migrating from the CB of the SC. These two roles involve different e−types: either intrinsic metal e− or trapped e− originated from the SC, respectively. Undoubtedly, irrespective of the origin of the e−, both scenarios offer vast possibilities of multiple interfacial reactions. 2.1.3 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) Plasmonic photocatalysis has driven a paramount enhancement in photocatalytic efficiencies, resulting in a tremendous shift in visible and near infrared light-absorbing materials [57] (see section 1.3). The vast applications of plasmonic photocatalysis are possible thanks to knowledge gained by the establishment of different physical models derived from different systems. For instance, back in the XX century, Paul Drude proposed an electrical conduction model for metals at the nanometric scale. He based his model on the principle of the kinetic theory of gases but applied it to electrons in a solid medium to deduce the metal dielectric permittivity [92,93]. A plasmon is characterized by the plasma frequency or pulsation (ωp) depending on the electronic density (n), elementary charge (e), metal permittivity (ε 0), and electron mass (m) as shown in equation (4). (4) ω p = n e 2 ε 0 m Drude's model describes how the free electrons oscillation cloud resonates after an external electrical field has been applied. The number of oscillations of a plasmon, also known as the plasma wave (fp), represents the electrical charges present in conductive media. The plasma wave in plasmons can be calculated according to equation (5). (5) f p = 1 2 π ∗ ω p In 1920, plasmons were classified as waves. The plasma oscillation (plasmon) can be calculated by applying the Maxwell's equations using strict boundary conditions [94]. For a single spherical particle, Mie theory accurately describes the properties when there is an electrodynamic response [95]. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can be described with the extinction (absorption + scattering) cross section Cext (equation (6)) that depends on particle radius (R), excitation wavelength (λ), relative dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the metal nanosphere (εm), imaginary part dielectric function (εi), and real part dielectric function (εr). The following equation is obtained thanks to combination of Mie theory and Maxwell equations creating a solution for a metal nanosphere [96]. (6) C e x t = 24 π 2 R 3 ε m 3 2 λ [ ε i ( ε r + 2 ε m ) 2 + ε i 2 ] An interesting physical parameter of the plasmon is the quality factor (Q) (equation (7)), which determines the width and strength of a resonance knowing the LSPR frequency ( ω S P ) and the plasmon decay rate ( γ ) [97]. Q indicates the number of oscillations taking place before heat dissipation of the light. A study on the Q of different metals demonstrated that the plasmonic properties were different in function of the metal but also in function of their wavelength. Mostly Au, Ag, Al, and Li display an attractive Q (Q ≥ 1) in the work region wavelength. Yet, the ideal minimum requirement for plasmonic applications is Q ≥ 10, although some ultrahigh Q-factors have been reported [98]. (7) Q = ω S P 2 γ The formation of the localized surface plasmon (LSP) occurs when an M NP is irradiated with a wavelength that wider than its size. Thus, the electron density decomposes, resulting in a decreased density on the illuminated side and increased density on the opposite side of the NP. The phenomenon causes a displacement of the metal's electronic cloud in one direction along the applied field [99,100]. Concomitantly, the electron cloud is redistributed in an asymmetrical shape and a coulombic force operates on the negative electrons and positive nuclei as illustrated in Fig. 11 . Due to the resulting charge density dynamic, oscillations of free electrons take place in the surroundings of the M NP. Yet, the total mechanic energy is preserved with no energy dispersion. Accordingly, a plasmon is defined as a collective coherent oscillation of free electrons in a M NP [101]. Surface plasmons (SP) are waves that propagate along the interface between a conductor and dielectric materials [103]. When a beam of light travels in a non-conductor media, also known as dielectric (air, water, glass), and reaches the surface of a conductor material (Au, Ag, M), a surface wave is generated at the interface of the M and the dielectric material. Under specific resonance conditions, a travelling surface wave is generated in an impinging point of light. The wave travels along the interface generating an intensity contour of the associated electromagnetic field, called the SP polaritron. Its generation creates, in turn, a propagation wave extending away from its initial surface point. Three characteristic distances can be identified in the SP: the evanescent field in the dielectric (δdiel), the evanescent field in the M (δmetal), and the surface plasmon propagation (SPP) (δSPP), as illustrated in Fig. 12 . Each distance has a different physical meaning, the δdiel describes how far the SP wave extends in the dielectric material, the δmetal describes how deep the SP wave reaches in the M, and the δSPP describes how far from the exaltation point the SP can travel along the M/dielectric interface [104]. The LSPR takes place when a working plasmon resonance frequency meets a single M NP at maximum functionality of its optical extinction, in which its frequency enables conduction electrons within the NP to suffer minimal energy dissipation while oscillating [88]. When this condition is fulfilled and the frequency of the incident light matches the LPSR, it is thus possible for the M NP to generate intense and localized electric fields on their surfaces benefiting photocatalytic applications. 2.1.3.1 Surface plasmon benefits for photocatalysis Nanoplasmonic systems are increasing the light harvesting capacity and simultaneously reducing material thickness. This trend is advantageous because it diminishes both bulk recombination and cost, making M NPs promising materials for boosting energy conversion efficiencies. The creation of the resonant M NP high-energy electron, or the so-called “hot” electron, comprises several steps, namely (I) excitation of LSP, (II) their decay to hot carriers (III) transport, and (IV) injection [100]. The multiple light absorption interactions and energy transfer mechanisms between an M NP and SPR can be reasonably predicted by knowing the energy level positions of each individual system in contrast to the Fermi level, i.e., NP, adsorbed molecule, and SC. The precise hot electron mediated chemical contribution (still a debate within the field) can be associated with three scenarios: (i) electron-hole pair separation, where the hot electrons induced by the SPR jump through the Schottky barrier inject into the SC CB, (ii) injection of hot electrons from the plasmonic NP to adsorbed molecules on the metal's surface, and (iii) thermal heating provoked by LSP. For the sake of simplicity, this review will briefly explain the generation of hot carriers, SC light absorption exaltation (M/SC interface), and hot electron injection (M/SC and M/molecule interfaces). No details on LSP decay and its associated thermal heating effect will be covered. a) Generation and relaxation of hot carriers Before referring to the utility of hot carriers, the generation and relaxation will be briefly covered to understand how they are created and transported. The excited SP decay emits a photon via a radiative path or generates an e−/h+ pair via non-radiative path by Landau damping means. The adjective “hot” for the charge carriers is used to indicate the larger energy amount of these types of carriers compared to the ones near the Fermi energy. Consequently, one can understand that a hot electron is merely an electron generated after the SP decay with a considerable amount of energy. Thus, the generation of e−/h+ pairs via SP decay can undergo either by inter or intraband transitions. The case of a direct transition, a ground state electron is excited from the VB to the CB with no modification of the crystal momentum, requiring a minimum contained energy to surpass the interband threshold energy. One can highlight that the d band regarding the Fermi level plays a key role in defining the energy distribution of excited hot carriers, i.e., high or low-energy carriers. Contrarily, the indirect transition cannot occur since their momentum is too small compared to that of the electrons. For this reason, a mediator is needed to achieve the momentum difference. In this context, two mediators can be found, e.g., phonons or confinement of the electron cloud [100]. Phonons, emitted from the SP decay, possess a significant energy to help the intrinsic intraband transition energy and together promote an exited electron to a hot electron [105]. The second mediator is the physical confinement of the electron cloud. This electron cloud extends along the nanostructure axis and contains a finite size, inducing an uncertainty in the momentum thanks to the uncertainty principle. In light of the large electric field gradient obtained in the vicinity of the M surface, it provides sufficient momentum to transform an excited electron in a hot electron [105]. For instance, these two mediators or predominant indirect energy transitions are equivalent since both are found below the interband threshold. Regarding the relaxation of hot carriers, the excited hot electrons tend to diffuse when trading their energy with either other hot electrons or phonons. When excited electrons exchange energy between themselves, a remaining thermal magnitude is release in the order of 100 fs via Fermi-Dirac distribution [106]. In the following step, electrons are scattered by phonons until the electron and lattice temperature reach a common ground. The interaction/exchange between electron-phonon scattering will accelerate or slow the needed equilibrium between the electron and lattice temperature compared to inter-electron scattering [107]. Yet, these theoretical studies have been performed only in tiny particles or bulk materials, due to the complexity of an accurate description of hot carrier dynamics on electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering. However, one can extrapolate that the low-energy carriers have longer lifetimes and longer average diffusion distances. When carrier energy increases, the electron-phonon scattering remains constant. Whilst, for the electron-electron scattering case, increases result in lower lifetimes and diffusion distances [108]. b) Semiconductor light absorption exaltation The SC light absorption exaltation mechanism (Fig. 13 ) comprises two effects. The first effect comprehends the electromagnetic field intensification in the surroundings of the M NP. The second effect consists in the photonic diffusion on the SC's surface coming from the relaxation of the plasmon from the surface of the M NP. In other words, when the electronic cloud of the NP resonates due to the influence of incident electromagnetic field, the field near the NP intensifies significantly, even for several nanometers around the NP. The formation of e−/h+ pairs within the SC is proportional to the squared of the incident field (E-field2). In turn, this new intense field on its surface leads to an increase in the number of e−/h+ pairs. Only a few photogenerated charge carriers are located on the surface, where they are ideally placed to react with species in solution before recombining. One can notice that for the occurrence of the SC light absorption exaltation, a condition must be fulfilled. The SC absorption window has to overlap with the resonance wavelength range of the M NP, to leverage the antenna functionality of the M NP [109]. c) Hot electron injection When hot electrons are on the edge of the metal's surface and have enough energy to surpass the barriers, they can jump either to an adsorbed molecule or the CB of the SC. Besides this conventional viewpoint of electron transfer, another direct electron excitation may occur in the absence of hot electron states. This new direction proposes a different channel for both M/SC and M/molecule interfaces [100]. c) i. Hot electron injection into a semiconductor The hot electron injection mechanism starts with an associated energy resulting from the electronic cloud of an irradiated M NP in oscillation [110]. Such injection in the NP's edge can be transported to the CB of the SC by charge transfer [111] via two possible paths: direct excitation of the metal-generated electron into the CB of the SC (Fig. 14 . 1), or indirect charge transfer (tunnel effect) via hot electrons formed by the SP decay followed by injection into the CB of the SC (Fig. 14. 2) [112,113]. The hot electrons and holes are not equivalent to the photogenerated e−/h+ pairs of a SC. But like other excited electrons, hot electrons can relax if a lower energy state is available and be transferred to the CB of the SC if their energy level is lower energy than that of the plasmonic resonance. Noble metal nanoparticles are characterized by an excellent electronic mobility and efficient absorption capacity, 105 times higher than organic dyes, making them a potential candidate for this type of indirect energy transfer [110]. The hot h+ generated in the M NP, has been more poorly described. But since the hot e− transfer follows the same principle as the metallic band diagram, the same can be applied to the hot h+ that migrates from the VB of the SC to the interior of the M NP. This charge transfer happens when the M NP is in intimate contact with the SC, oscillating and creating a positive charge deficit. Assuming the charge carrier's direction, the hot h+ might behave like a Z-scheme dynamic. It must be underlined that this transfer is merely a hypothesis that may explain a path on how to compensate the global generation of hot charges within the M NP. c) ii. Hot electron injection into an adsorbed molecule. The hot electron injection from the M into an adsorbed molecule can occur in two different cases. The first one relies on the direct transfer of the excited electron of the M NP to the lowest unoccupied adsorbate state (Fig. 15 a), whilst the second comprehends an indirect charge transfer. The diffusion length and lifetime are longer for the low-energy hot electrons compared to the high-energy electrons, thus providing a more efficient path for molecules with unoccupied adsorbate states near the M Fermi level (Fig. 15 b) [114]. In the water splitting reaction, either of the described hot e− would be injected into a water molecule to oxidize the chemical entity and undergo the first half reaction enabling the production of H2 in the second half reaction (H+ reduction)."
7,Binary nanostructures: Schottky M NP/SC junctions and Z-scheme SC1-SC2 heterojunctions,
8,Schottky M NP/SC junction's general principle,"3.1 Schottky M NP/SC junction's general principle When a M and a SC are in intimate contact at the nanoscale, a M/SC junction is formed. The quality of this junction is defined by the type of interactions formed between the two components, driven by their corresponding work function and Fermi levels. The work function (ɸ) is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level. It also represents the minimum energy required to transfer an e− from the solid to a position in the vacuum beyond the surface of the M [115]. When combining a M NP with a n-type SC junction, where the latter contains electron acceptor impurities with 5 valence electrons in its crystal lattice, three cases can happen: (1) ɸM = ɸSC, the Fermi energy level of the metal (EF,M) and the SC (EF,SC) are aligned before contact. But, after contact, there is no exchange of charge carriers. (2) Ohmic junction - ɸM < ɸSC, after contact, the M (e−) on the interface has higher energy than the SC (e−), therefore the M (e−) will transfer from the SC to the EF,M/EF,SC alignment. (3) Schottky junction - ɸM ˃ ɸSC, after contact, the SC (e−) on the interface has higher energy than that of the M NP, causing the SC (e−) to transfer to the Fermi alignment. M/n-type SC Schottky junction (3rd case) is one of the focal points of this review; the other two cases are merely informative. In this case, a solid M/SC system must fulfill two electronic conditions to enable the occurrence of the Schottky junction. One was already mentioned and it pertains the magnitude of ɸM being larger than the ɸSC. The second condition relies on the magnitude of EfSC being larger than of the EfM. If the M/SC system fulfills these conditions, the synchronization of their Ef takes place and the upward band bending can undergo the migration of photoexcited e− from the SC towards the M. Au/TiO2 and Au/gC3N4 are two systems able to fulfill these electronic conditions, and thus presenting efficient Schottky junctions. In these cases, theoretically the M NP can act as e− pump and thanks to this electronic advantage, a better charge carrier's separation is induced within the M/SC system. This condition also decreases direct recombination of e−/h+ pairs and ensures the migration of the photogenerated e− from the CB in the TiO2 towards the M NP. That is, assuming that the Schottky barrier height allows e− migration from one component to the other [116,117]. But to meet any of these conditions, the photogenerated e− in the bulk must first migrate to the surface and be transferred to the M NP. However, if having reached the surface, the photogenerated e− easily recombines with an h+, it reduces the overall activity. If it evades recombination, the e− becomes trapped within the M NP, undergoing beneficial reduction reactions, e.g., proton reduction to hydrogen (Fig. 16 ) which improve overall activity. The M/SC junction is broadly used to build the space-charge region or depletion layer (Schottky barrier) inside M/SC interface upon illumination. At the M/SC, electron transfer from one component to the other occurs, aligning the Fermi energy levels, avoiding charge recombination, and ultimately enhancing the photocatalytic performance [118]. Hence, the electrons and holes are forced to move in different directions once they are created inside or near the Schottky junction [119]. On top of the Schottky junction, the M NP also provides a fast lane for charge transfer [120], and its surface acts as a charge-trap center hosting multiple active sites with more reaction possibilities. It is only at this point that both the Schottky junction and the fast-lane charge transfer work together to hamper the electron-hole recombination. Before contact, both components, M (our case Au) and SC, (our case TiO2 or gC3N4, both n-type) have different Fermi levels or electropotentials. A condition must be fulfilled to get the Schottky layer formation at the interface – ɸM ˃ ɸSC. If the opposite situation takes place (ɸSC ˃ ɸM), an Ohmic contact is formed instead of a Schottky junction. When the equilibrium is reached (without illumination), a Helmholtz double layer forms, balancing the Fermi level of the SC (Ef,S) and the work function of the metal (ɸM). The balancing effect makes charge transference across the Schottky barrier unfeasible due to insufficient concentration of free charge carriers in the SC. The electric field between the M and SC interfaces cannot effectively function as a bridge to transfer the carriers from one side to the other. Nevertheless, these free charge carriers near the SC's surface are unbalanced in comparison to the bulk, also known as space charge region. For example, with an n-type SC (e− as the majority of charge carriers), the e− are depleted in the space charge region (also known as depletion layer) characterized by excess positive charges. Illumination alters the equilibrium state. It is thus possible to generate a higher charge carrier's concentration which will consequently be transferred across the Schottky barrier, resulting an upwards band bending due to the repulsion from the negatively charged layer on the metal surface and the positively charged layer on the SC. The three mentioned cases are illustrated in a detailed scheme in Fig. 17 . 3.1.1 Au–TiO2 composites 3.1.1.1 TiO2: relevance, physical-chemical properties, and synthesis TiO2 is the most studied photocatalyst. Its importance stems from being the most active SC for photon-induced applications. For this reason, it is the benchmark material in environmental and energy fields [122] and thus recommended as an internal reference material. TiO2 presents interesting features such as strong oxidizing abilities [56] under irradiation, chemical stability, long term durability, biocompatibility, reasonable cost, and strong mechanical resistance. Thanks to these features, it is a very attractive material for photocatalytic water splitting) [123], dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) or even photovoltaic cells (Grätzel cell) [110,124], lithium-ion batteries [125], photocatalytic oxidation, especially for water [126–128] and air [129,130] decontamination processes, super hydrophilicity [131], electrochromic [132], biomedical coatings, and sensors. TiO2 is a n-type SC with a wide band gap of 3.1–3.2 eV, a working function (Φ) of 4.9–5.2 eV, and its band edges positions are found at −0.5 and 2.7 V vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) at pH = 7 for CB and VB [133], respectively. These light absorption and energy potential characteristics attribute TiO2 two main practical limitations hampering its use at large scale for solar light-driven water splitting: (i) exclusive UV-light absorption, and (ii) limited reductant character to undergo the proton reduction half reaction by itself. Other disadvantages of TiO2, are the fast recombination rate of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and the insufficient ionic/electrical conductivity [122,134,135]. In this context, several photosensitization strategies are developed to solve simultaneously the abovementioned limitations [136] and expanding the functionality of TiO2 in applications such as dye grafting [137], surface functionalization [138], ion doping [139,140], plasmonic M NPs deposition [87,141], and coupling with lower band gap SCs [142]. TiO2 presents mainly four polymorphs, anatase (tetragonal, space group I 41/amd), rutile (tetragonal, space group P 42/mnm), brookite (orthorhombic, space group Pbca), and TiO2 (B) (monoclinic, space group C2m) [143,144]. Among these polymorphs, the most active in low temperature photocatalysis is anatase due to its significant specific surface area, which is beneficial for technological implementation aspects [145–147]. Hence, commercial TiO2 P25 is still the benchmark photocatalyst, and the most used for preliminary studies or proof-of-concept ideas because it is largely characterized and its peculiar physical-chemical properties. In fact, TiO2 P25 contains 80:20 anatase/rutile proportion resulting in a stable heterojunction, which efficiently separates the photogenerated electron-hole pairs [148–150]. TiO2 synthesis method will define important physical-chemical properties, which makes it a useful and important parameter. In function of the selected synthetic method, key properties will be tuned and therefore oriented for specific reactions/applications. The synthetic methods can be divided into two main groups: physical and chemical. Within physical methods, sputtering, cathodic pulverization, or Atomic Layer Deposition are considered precise thin layer deposition methods, but they require either high temperature treatment, partial vacuum, and sophisticated equipment, making them relatively expensive [151]. Furthermore, those preparation methods are mainly limited to small-scale synthesis. Contrarily, the chemical methods are simpler, thus more used for preparing higher amounts of catalyst. One can mention the most used methods: chemical vapor deposition [152], microemulsion [153], electrochemical anodization [154,155], sol-gel [156,157], and hydrothermal [158] synthesis. Every synthetic protocol provides different TiO2 morphologies, thus allowing the control of particle size and distribution, shape, crystalline phase, and specific surface area, which are the determining properties with an immediate impact in TiO2 activity. Despite of the TiO2 advantages, its wide band gap requires UV energy photons for its activation, thus hindering the use of large part of the solar spectrum. For this reason, TiO2 nanomaterials are not used for visible-light applications yet. Nevertheless, several TiO2 photosensitization strategies had been proposed to maximize visible and near IR light harvesting. Among countless strategies, one can briefly mention coupling [142] with lower band gap SCs (to form SC1/SC2 heterojunctions, preferably with a Z-scheme mechanism), deposition of plasmonic metallic NPs [159] (to form also M NP/SC Schottky junction), doping with impurities [160] (anion, cation, co-doped, and co-alloyed) Fig. 18 , and dye grafting [161–163] for surface activation with anchoring useful molecules exposed, e.g. photosensitizers. 3.1.1.2 Au/TiO2 binary composite Plasmonic Schottky Au/TiO2 junctions have been one of the most studied systems of this type. Numerous parametric studies have been conducted to achieve interesting performances and provide a good understanding of the mechanistic operating steps. As a matter of fact, typical studies on Schottky TiO2-based junctions report at least three metals, not only necessarily Au, but Pt, Pd, and Ag, which have been used for longer in water splitting. Herein, we will focus on Au/TiO2 as binary composite since is an immediate reference of the multi-phasic composite Au/TiO2-gC3N4, the core material of this review. Table 1 shows a comparative assessment of distinctive works. Similar materials, Au/TiO2, to produce H2 under different working conditions such as mass of photocatalyst, metal loading, sacrificial agent, reaction temperature, a synthesis method of metal deposition, and calcination (among other) are introduced aiming at identifying major differences. One can notice, that the H2 rates were reported in different units, thus, whenever cumulative H2 was reported, rates were normalized per time and mass units to homogenize rates and achieve a more accurate comparison. The scientific community still debates whether H2 formation rates should be normalized by specific surface area (SSA) or by mass of catalyst used. On this review, H2 rates were normalized per mass of catalyst since it is currently the most accepted option. The preference for this method can be explained by the intrinsic limitations of normalizing per SSA. In this case, rates would only reflect the intrinsic structural property of the materials (bearing in mind the wide range of SSA's in different materials) and disregard experimental conditions. The second parameter that varies significantly among the studies is the lamp optical characteristics. Whilst most articles report the power, only a few reported the irradiance. In this context, the need for further benchmarking regarding optical characteristics of the lamp will be thus desirable. The system temperature while acquiring the data is also of great importance since H2 can also be produced by thermal processes. For that reason, it is advised to use room temperature as the optimal working condition with constant monitoring to avoid thermal catalysis contribution. Regarding the use of a sacrificial agent, cited studies used mostly methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), and in less extend isopropanol (IPA), which are part of the conventional alcohols for such application when using TiO2 based materials. Given the significant variations in experimental conditions, one can conclude that no direct comparison of materials’ performance is possible. Regarding the twenty-nine studies in Table 1, the comparison will be made between studies reporting H2 rates in μmol h−1 g−1 and quantum yields in percentage, which are the standard units used in all tables of this review. This criterion aims at uniformizing results, even though, results remain heterogeneous. Given the heterogeneity due to lack of standardization of photocatalytic results prevents accurate international comparison of materials. By consequence other promising materials may not be identified during this analysis. It must be noted that optical analysis should be given a closer look while calculating quantum yields. The precise expression and recommended is internal quantum yield. While irradiated area or reactor geometry are often reported, it limits to calculate apparent quantum yield. Yet, for accurate measurements the absorbed photons of the catalyst should be known to enable internal quantum yield calculations, independently of using a poly or monochromatic light. For that purpose, a spectroradiometer or photodiode should be used (expensive devices), or the classic actinometry approach (less expensive but time consuming). Among the selected Au/TiO2 studies, considered the most prominent catalysts, one can see that the four used MeOH as a sacrificial agent. The preparation methods of Au deposition ranged from solid grinding, radiolysis, and photo-deposition. Another relevant parameter is the Au loading, which surprisingly was found to be between 0.5 and 1 wt%, a narrow loading for unbiased comparison of this parameter. At last, all the studies used calcination treatment at different temperatures to either crystallize the support material or simultaneously guarantee a strong attachment of Au NPs on the surface of the catalyst while reducing AuI or AuIII to Au0. Marchal et al., showed an optimal 0.5 wt% Au/TiO2(P25) catalyst photo-producing H2 at a rate of 500 μmol h−1 g−1. This photo activity correlated to the mild air treatment performed during the synthesis of the catalyst known to allow a good contact between the Au NPs and TiO2 and minimize the recombination of charge carriers [164]. In a different study, Marchal et al., compared the impact of two different Au precursors using the equivalent solid grinding method. The most active Au/TiO2 composite exhibited a 590 μmol h−1 g−1 production after calcination at 400 °C. This activity was ascribed to intimate interaction between the two components resulting in photogenerated electron transfer from TiO2 to Au NPs, enhancing its co-catalytic and charges separation functionalities [165]. Following the increased activity, Luna et al. introduced an Au/TiO2 photocatalyst obtained via radiolysis displaying a production rate of 784 μmol H2 h−1 g−1. Such photoactivity was assigned to long lifetimes of mobile e− compared to the TiO2 reference and a slower decay, evidencing the capacity of Au to avoid fast charge carrier recombination [166]. The most active Au/TiO2 photocatalyst of the selected series was attributed to Zhou et al. [90]. The authors reported a photo deposited Au NPs onto TiO2 with a relatively low loading and reduced MeOH content. This binary composite was able to photoproduce 1600 μmol H2 h−1 g−1. Among the activity-structure relationships, one can highlight the manipulation of TiO2 surface nanocrystals by photo-deposited Au NPs, allowing oxygen vacancies and serving as efficient defect structures, namely e−trap sites. Therefore, the authors advised to pre-treat TiO2 at high temperatures to provide a suitable anchor for the photo deposited Au NPs, leading to a good distribution along the support surface while enhancing the catalytic performance. 3.1.2 Au-gC3N4 composites 3.1.2.1 gC3N4 relevance, physical-chemical properties, and synthesis Carbon nitride (C3N4) belongs to a large family of carbon and nitrogen materials with hydrogen impurities. Recently, Melchionna and Fornasiero pointed out the fast-growing number of publications on C3N4 photocatalysis over the last decade, attributing it to the high relevance of the emergent, tunable, and interesting material [192]. C3N4 is also considered the oldest synthetic polymer, first produced via solid-state synthesis by Berzelius in 1834. He synthesized C3N4 using mercury (II) thiocyanate (Hg(SCN)2), which resulted in a yellow pale solid, amorphous, insoluble product, more commonly known as Pharaoh's snakes due its analogue pyrotechnic growth. It was named ""melon"" by Liebig due to its color. The second attempt took place one year after (1835), when Gmelin synthesized potassium hydromelonate (K3C6N7NCN) by heating potassium ferricyanide and sulfur [193]. Nevertheless, the elucidation of both C3N4 and K3C6N7NCN structures was not possible due to the lack of advanced analytical and characterization tools at the time. In 1922, Franklin introduced the concept of carbon nitride (C3N4)x. By Hg (SCN)2 thermolysis, he produced an amorphous C/N compound as the final polymerization product while deaminating the amino-carboxylic acid [194]. He proposed the 2, 5, 8 triamino-tri-s-triazine (C126H21N175) structure, amongst several structures too, but the experimental results lacked strong evidence. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was needed to demonstrate the different phases inside the polymeric structure of graphitic (g-)C3N4. In this context, Pauling and Sturdivant suggested for the first time the coplanar tricyclic tri-s-triazine (s-heptazine) unit as the elementary structural motif with XRD evidence. Three years later, Lucas and Redemann found an inconsistency in melon's composition proposed by Liebig and Franklin. Thus, the authors proposed the alternative structures of melam, melem, and melon. Still, their major contribution was to report that the ""melon"" structure was graphite [195]. From 1950 to 1980, Finkel'shtein and co-workers carried out a series of experiments to confirm the different derivates of gC3N4 mentioned so far [196]. A theoretical study conducted by Teter and Hemley in 1996, also suggested a triazine-based structure for gC3N4 [197]. In 1989, a theoretical prediction drawn by Liu and Cohen, of an ultra-hard carbon nitride material (β-C3N4, sp3) harder than diamond, help foster research on C3N4 materials [198]. Nevertheless, it was only in 2008 that Wang and Antonietti et al. published a milestone work regarding the photocatalytic capacity of C3N4 for H2 and O2 production under visible irradiation using a co-catalyst and a sacrificial agent [199]. Seven different crystalline polymorphs (allotropes) are well described in experimental and theoretical literature, six of them are 3D: α-C3N4, β-C3N4, cubic-C3N4, pseudocubic-C3N4, g-h-triazine, and g-h-heptazine; while the last allotrope is two dimensional (2D): graphitic gC3N4, the most stable of the seven [198,200,201]. The graphitic phase presents a chemical structure analogue to graphene. Several in-plane π conjugated systems, which are based on perpendicular weak interactions (van der Waals) with both top and bottom sheets, are stacked in a 2D network of hexagons based on aromatic rings. Graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) has emerged among the polymorphs' family in material chemistry for several reasons. Due to its facile and rapid synthesis, cheap and abundant N2-rich precursors, scalable method, and ease of modification [199,202]. Besides, it's unique electronic band gap, high thermal and chemical stability, make it the most stable allotrope at room temperature and the most amenable to complex band gap engineering strategies [201]. gC3N4 is attractive due to its specific features, it is a n-type SC with a medium band gap of ca. 2.7 eV exhibiting a partial visible absorption, working function (Φ) of 4.65 eV [203], and band edges positions at −1.3 and 1.4 V vs. NHE at pH = 7 for CB and VB [133,204], respectively. The crystallographic structure is based on tri-s-triazine or s-heptazine units, that are hexagonal sheets bonded by covalent bonds between C and N atoms, which are analogue to the graphite/diamond system with a graphitic 2D form (sp2hybridized system. These heptazine units are connected via tertiary amines in the gC3N4 skeleton, explaining its high thermal (up to 600 °C in air) and chemical stability (against acid, base, and organic solvents) [202]. Several gC3N4 synthesis methods have been reported, namely physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, solvothermal, thermal condensation, microwave irradiation, and solid-state reaction [167]. Of all methods, thermal condensation is the most widely used due to its simplicity. Typically, the organic precursors used for the thermal polycondensation are cheap nitrogen-rich species, e.g., urea, thiourea, melamine, cyanamide, dicyandiamide (DCDA), and others like ammonium thiocyanate, etc. For each precursor, the thermal decomposition transformation might occur with a different poly addition and polycondensation mechanistic paths, all leading to an equivalent melamine formation step. Debate exists in the research community of whether the existence of these intermediates can be experimentally proved by crystallography due to the lack of in situ measurement and considering the difficulty of measuring in the presence of ammonia, corrosive gas. Despite the lack of experimental confirmation, this model is the most widely accepted thermal polycondensation mechanism [109] (Fig. 19 ). In spite of the advantages of gC3N4, it exhibits intrinsic drawbacks, such as fast recombination rates of the charge carriers, limited absorption (below 460 nm), reduced surface area, tight active sites for interfacial (photo)reactions, moderate oxidation ability, and low charge mobility due to its low electrical conductivity [206]. To overcome these limitations, different modifications strategies have been proposed and implemented in its nanoarchitecture design, such as templates (hard [207–212], soft [213–217], free [218–221], and self-assembly [222–225]), copolymerization [226–231], and exfoliation [232] (thermal [233], chemical [234,235], and liquid [236]). 3.1.2.2 Au/gC3N4 binary composite Plasmonic Schottky Au/gC3N4 junctions are very recent composites prompted by studies on gC3N4 materials [237]. Despite its recency, numerous parametric studies have been conducted reporting good performances and increasing our understanding of the mechanistic operating steps. Typical studies with Schottky TiO2-based junctions report at least three metals, not necessarily Au, since Pt, Pd and Ag, have been used for longer in water splitting. Therein, we will focus on Au/gC3N4 as a binary composite since it is an immediate reference of the multi-phasic composite Au/TiO2-gC3N4. Table 2 shows a comparative assessment of Au/gC3N4 studies under different experimental conditions. Like Table 1, one can notice that key parameters were reported in different units hampering unbiased comparison. For that reason, the H2 rate (central column) reported in Table 2 was normalized per mass of catalyst (when necessary) to obtain comparable results. Furthermore, one can notice that only one study [238] reported the irradiance of the lamp and the internal quantum yield (IQY), parameters that established the relationship between the photon-to-product conversion. In this context, the present authors reiterate on the need for reporting further optical characteristics to calculate crucial quantum yields. Regarding the sacrificial agent, two main agents were used, MeOH and triethanolamine (TEOA), the latter with high affinity towards gC3N4, probably due to carrying three instead of one OH group [239]. Among the nine reported studies (Table 2), three Au/gC3N4 composites exhibited less than 300 μmol h−1 g−1 [240–242] and were thus classified as low activity. Two additional studies reported a similar activity [238,243], yet both presented different experimental/material features. For instance, Tian et al. described unique Au nanorods with near infrared (NIR) light harvesting capacity. This NIR absorption ability results from their longitudinal SPR enabling hot e−injection into the CB of gC3N4, hampering charge carrier recombination, and ultimately benefiting the composite photocatalytic activity [243]. In the second study, Jiménez-Calvo et al. reported a series of Au/gC3N4-atm and demonstrated that synthesis of gC3N4 in pure NH3 with only 0.3 wt% Au loading resulted in a significant production of H2, considering its atypical experimental/material parameters. Such enhancement was attributed to a higher degree of crystallization, surface area, larger volume of mesopores, and more intimate interface contact with 3.2 nm Au NPs. It must be highlighted that this study obtained satisfactory activity (324 and 26 μmol h−1 g−1 at full lamp spectrum and visible light) by using 3–6 times less Au loading and 10–25 times less sacrificial agent in comparison to the other eight studies. Since Au acts mostly as a co-catalyst in this Schottky junction, it is known to enhance activity by 10–100 fold [1]. In the same process, the hole scavenger molecule (sacrificial agent) can serve as source of photo (thermal) reforming, contributing to the overall H2 production. So, the idea is to keep direct conversion of H2 using a low amount of these two components during the operational test. Regarding the studies with higher H2 rates, Guo et al. synthesized 18 nm-sized Au nanospheres/gC3N4 photocatalyst exhibiting an activity of 540 μmol H2 h−1 g−1. This activity correlates to the electron sink and plasmonic effects of Au nanocrystals in different spectral regions further improving the photocatalytic activity [244]. Thereafter, Chinh-Chien et al., introduced another Au/gC3N4 catalyst with large nitrogen defects, obtained via post calcination. The process resulted in nitrogen vacancies promoting stronger interactions with Au NPs and facilitating the SPR effect [245]. Zhang et al. reported an optimal 2.1 wt% Au/gC3N4 achieving 3308 μmol H2 h−1 g−1 [246]. Such activity was ascribed firstly to the electron sink functionality, where AuNPs reduce the radiative recombination of e−/h+ in the gC3N4 matrix and secondly to the high concentration of hot electrons generated from the larger AuNPs. But the most remarkable result on Au/gC3N4 binary junction was reported by Samanta et al. via deposition–precipitation. The authors reported that size, shape and fine dispersion of Au NPs over the gC3N4 layer was highly beneficial for photoactivity with a significant plasmonic effect. Thus, by the unique visible-light absorption of Au NPs, a noticeable number of photogenerated e−/h + pairs were produced evidencing the suitability of polar SC/noble M interfaces for these reactions [247]."
9,SC1/SC2 heterojunction's general principle,"3.2 SC1/SC2 heterojunction's general principle The formation of heterojunction systems occurs at the nanoscale and consists of the creation of an interface between two SC's (ideally with different Eg, CB and VB energies). The resulting hybrid junction modifies their theoretical Fermi level, band edge positions, and e−/h+ generation and transfer processes. When a heterojunction forms between two SCs of different band gap magnitudes, three types can be described (Fig. 20 ): (I) Straddling gap, (II) Staggered gap, and (III) Broken gap [248]. Type I happens when a junction forms between a larger (SC1) and a smaller (SC2) band gap SCs. At the interface, both VB and CB potentials of the SC2 are confined within the larger band gap of SC1, creating the straddling band alignment. When light with sufficient energy irradiates (equal or greater than the Eg of the SC's), the photogeneration of e−/h+ occurs, resulting in one direction transfer and thus accumulation of all charge carriers in a single component within the hybrid structure owing to the band edge positions. Since the charge carriers are accumulated in one SC, there is no enhancement of charge separation, impairing the photoredox efficiency. In type II interfaces, the band edge potentials are staggered between SC1 and SC2. Because of a difference in chemical potential between both SC's, upward or downward band bending is formed, leading to the migration of charge carriers in the opposite direction. This process enhances the e−/h+ spatial separation on several parts of the heterojunction and retards charges recombination prolonging the lifetime of free e− and h+. In this case, the oxidation/reduction reactions take place in different regions of the two different SC's. To date, the most widely studied heterojunctions can be classified as type II. Type III interface happen when both VB and CB edges of the SC2 are above the CB potential of the SC1 without crossing each other. The two SC's work alone with no enhancement of charge transfer [142,249]. Several reasons explain why the scientific community has been focused on studying the design and synthesis of heterojunction Z-scheme hybrid systems. The first reason is that, when one of the SCs has a medium band gap, these hybrid systems absorb more photons from the visible range. Another reason stems from the increased charge separation of the photogenerated species. In the ideal configuration, it is possible to obtain both visible photons absorption and enhancement of spatial charge separation. The final advantage relies on the beneficial performance on two half reactions of water-oxidation and proton reduction, requiring adequate VB and CB positions in reference to the electrochemical potentials of the half reactions. 3.2.1 TiO2-gC3N4: a study case for its synergistic effect towards the use of visible-light and better charge carrier separation TiO2 coupled with lower band gap and different energy level SCs preferentially forms a type II heterojunction or Z-scheme with two simultaneous benefits. The first one is the extension of its light-absorption capacity towards the visible region. The second one is the reduction of the recombination of carriers [136]. It has been reported that an adequate matching of the CB and VB positions of the SCs could guarantee an efficient vectorial transfer of the charge carriers from one to the other. TiO2 as a wide band gap SC, is preferably coupled with smaller band gap SCs (CdS, CdSe, WO3, SnO2, gC3N4, etc.), that absorb photons from the visible-light range (Eg TiO2 ˃ Eg SC2). The medium band gap SCs needs to have a more negative CB then the electrons generated in the SC2 to enable the injection of electrons into the TiO2 CB. By respecting this condition, the VB position of the SC2 will be at a lower energetic level than the VB of TiO2, so that the TiO2 can transfer h+ from its VB to the VB of the SC2. These two paths are shown in Fig. 21 when TiO2 is coupled specifically with gC3N4 in a staggered heterojunction type. In this optimal configuration, besides the visible-light activation of composite materials, the overall separation between the photogenerated e−/h+ pair is enhanced. TiO2-gC3N4 heterojunction synthesis can take place [250] by mixing the precursors of both SCs, adding the precursors of one SC to the second already-synthesized SC, or by mixing both fully synthesized SCs. To enhance physical proximity between the two SCs and promote an efficient and stable interface, an additional thermal treatment is recommended for evaporating any residues of solvents used in synthesis and create the desired binary heterojunction. The success of any thermal treatment depends on the atmosphere, temperature, and treatment time. Each condition will influence the final electronic and chemical contact at the heterojunction and the structure, morphology, and even defects of individual SCs. Hence, conventional synthesis methods to obtain TiO2-gC3N4 heterojunction are wet impregnation [251–254], hydrothermal [255], ball milling [256], and electrospinning [257]."
10,Ternary nanostructure M/SC1-SC2: Z-scheme and Schottky hybrid systems together,"Heterostructured multi-phase catalysts combining plasmonic M NPs and dual-phase SC systems have received substantial attention in the material's research field lately. They have been explored for photo (electro) catalysis, plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy, photovoltaics, optics, solar cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology applications [258]. It is hoped that such composites become benchmark materials for multiple applications. The multifunctionality of these nanocomposites relies on the synergistic interactions between their different components. For the dual-phase SC system, a staggered type II configuration is expected, assuming an effective intimate electronic and chemical contact. This configuration enhances charge separation by hampering the recombination of charge carriers and transferring generated charges in opposite directions in the two SCs. The effect further extends the charge carriers’ lifetime and enhances light harvesting capacities by combining the optical absorption of the two SCs. For the plasmonic M NPs, assuming an effective contact with the support, the improvement of light absorption capacities is expected, particularly towards visible-to-near-infrared. The mechanism occurs via SC light absorption exaltation which retards the encounter between the e− and the h+ by acting as e− trap sites for SC-originated e− and as co-catalyst (i.e., photo (electro) catalysis) of both conventional and hot e−."
11,Au/TiO2-gC3N4 composites,"4.1 Au/TiO2-gC3N4 composites Multi-phase of Au/TiO2-gC3N4 apply both Z-scheme dynamics and plasmonic Schottky junctions within the same material (see section 3). The junction significantly enhances the performance of individual components, as reported in several studies. Table 3 depicts four studies with Au/TiO2-gC3N4 composites synthesized via different routes. One of these composites exhibited a particularly low activity, even though it was synthesized via a sophisticated electrospinning method [257]. In another study, Rather et al. reported an interesting tubular TiO2 nanostructured coupled with gC3N4 and decorated with Au NPs which exhibited a reasonable performance [255]. But since the irradiance or quantum yield were not included in these two studies, direct comparison with others is difficult to achieve. The two remaining studies [251,252] showed promising photocatalytic-based H2 production, mainly at visible-light irradiation and full lamp spectra with very low quantities of sacrificial agent and Au loading. Despite using the same wet impregnation (dual-phase heterojunction) and chemical reduction (Au NPs) protocols, Jiménez-Calvo et al. [251] accomplished a faster and simpler Au/TiO2-gC3N4 synthesis in comparison to the other study based on similar protocols [252]. In this case, the authors used commercial TiO2–P25 (Evonik) instead of TiO2 sol-gel, suggesting TiO2 morphology has a high impact in composite synthesis. Besides the impact in the synthesis process, the two composites exhibited different dynamics of charge carriers, evidenced by Time-Resolved Micro Conductivity (TRMC). Jiménez-Calvo et al. [251], who reported composites with varying gC3N4 abundances (2.5, 5, and 10%. Fig. 22 , a-c), revealed an unprecedented TiO2 photosensitization at 360, 450, and 500 nm (UV-A + visible) based on TRMC measurements. This new property seems thus to correlate with the textural and structural characteristics of TiO2–P25 that enhances contact between both SCs. Interestingly, both studies show that the optimal relative proportion between TiO2 and gC3N4 remains at 95–5, independently of TiO2 morphology. Thus, 0.3 wt% Au/TiO2(P25)-gC3N4 (95–5) [251] exhibited a 16% higher H2 production yield under visible light compared to its TiO2 sol-gel homolog [252], with almost half of Au content and a lower lamp irradiance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest H2 production (5 mL after 2.5 h of visible-light irradiation) ever reported among studies with comparable experimental conditions (Fig. 22 d) [251]. The new composite using gC3N4, an inexpensive and emergent material, and M NPs as e− trap site and co-catalyst, has the potential to serve as a new benchmark hybrid material in further studies. Moreover, if future studies aiming to boost TiO2 efficiencies via photosensitization, employ other metals besides Au, 10–100 fold production rate increases may be achieved [1]."
12,Conclusions and outlook,"H2 is an ideal energy vector, but its application is currently limited or non-existent in sectors with a high environmental cost, such as transportation, construction, and power generation. The adoption of H2 in these sectors would ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy and circular economy model. However, before that can happen, H2 production must shift from steam methane reforming to a more sustainable method and current limitations, associated with storage and distribution, must be surpassed. This transition to an H2-driven economy is currently hindered by the lack of standardization found across multiple photocatalytic studies. As noted in Tables 1–3, light-source parameters are not reported in a standard or comparable way, which hinders any attempt to critically assess efficiencies between the different plasmon Au-based systems. For instance, many studies report only the output light power in Watts (W), whereas others report irradiance (mW cm−2) including the respective irradiance light spectra, which is more precise and critical than W measurements alone, specifically for calculating the process efficiency. A deeper problem concerns the lack of information on the quantum yield, which represents the photon-conversion from the energy input to the formed product. While only a few groups reporting it, most of them express the apparent quantum yield and not necessarily the internal quantum yield (precise one). In Tables 1–3 only 35%, 44%, and 50%, respectively, studies reported the quantum yield. This trend provides a scientific evidence and a visual proof of the lack of reproducibility of expressing a determining activity factor in different sub-field communities. To change this, it is important that researchers and reviewers abide by the same standards and ensure that all studies report the same essential parameters. Since photocatalysis implies the use of photons to activate catalysts, it remains imperative to report the photon conversion in quantum yield, associating optics, reactor engineering, surface catalysis, and ultimately materials’ performance. Plasmonic Au-based junctions make up a class of promising materials, which can undoubtedly play a vital role in the conversion of solar into chemical energy. Among the noble and coinage metals, Au is of great interest for photocatalytic water splitting due to its potential to obtain efficient H2 production rates or CO2 reduction into C1/C2 products. In the foreseeable future, the use of bimetallic catalysts will probably play a crucial role in the development of next generation plasmonic photocatalysts. In these advanced systems, the association of Au with a second metal (Pd, Pt, Ag, Ni, Cu, etc.), needs to be designed with two objectives in mind: the bimetallic system must enhance the optical absorption of the system, towards longer wavelengths (i.e., visible range), and it must also lead to more efficient reactions rates compared to monometallic reference systems. Thus, the pre-requisites for the rational design of plasmonic-based systems will comprise the optimization of the plasmonic response by controlling bimetallic composition, loading, and morphology (core-shell, embedded, alloys, islands, pyramids, bipyramids, or rods …), in addition, to the typical parameters that are recurrently optimized in monometallic systems (i.e., size, shape, environment, and distribution of metal NPs). Single-atom characterization of metal-based systems with plasmon properties is becoming essential to obtain fundamental insights. Characterization at this level should employ state-of-the-art techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) [259] and infrared absorption (SEIRAS) [260] spectroscopies, as well as, electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [261]. SERS and SEIRAS allow the observation of single molecules by Raman or IR spectra. The techniques raise their scattering intensities thanks to the strong near-field enhancement when interacting with light. In contrast, EELS can demonstrate plasmon mode and influence of the metal environment via eventual shifts on its energy loss values. Due to capturing different properties of the composites, it is highly recommended to use several of the abovementioned single-atom analysis to better understand the plasmon behavior and the surrounding atomic vicinity. Comprehensive characterization will help researchers establish structure-activity relationships and better tune the performance of M/SC junctions by rational design. Despite being the most widely studied SC, TiO2 has been known for a series of limitations, specifically its limited UV-A light-harvesting capacity and insufficient energy overpotential to undergo H+ reduction. The deposition of metal particles and coupling with SCs is recurrently used to compensate for these limitations. In this context, gC3N4 emerges as an exceptional candidate to be coupled with TiO2 for several reasons: cheap and versatile N-rich precursors, high thermal and chemical stability, suitable CB and VB positions, and most importantly, its visible light harvesting capacity. Although, M/SC Schottky junctions and TiO2-gC3N4 heterojunctions have brought new and interesting developments, the combination of both strategies has the potential to further boost the development of next generation of sun-driven photocatalytic systems. The rational design of plasmonic Au-based Schottky junctions for SPR chemical transformations and solar fuels production needs improvement. Future approaches should focus on developing predictive and including first principles analysis. The models can serve as tools to narrow down the number of different synthesis approaches that need to be tested in the lab; they should focus on describing the interconnecting physical-chemical properties of the two or three individual components, specifically at the nanoscale interface. This interface is where the charge carriers are generated, separated, recombined, and transferred from one component to the other under the influence of many and complex factors. Thus, the development of comprehensive predictive models is crucial to better understand the behavior and the parameters with the greatest influence in energy conversion, reaction efficiency, and recombination. Additionally, first principles analysis and transition state theory applied to the M/SC surface reactions can serve as powerful tools to predict the quantum chemical behavior. This can be done by using existing protocols as the density functional theory or any alternative models allowing the prediction of opto-electronic properties on complex systems. In sum, rational first principles analysis has the potential of bridging the gap between experimentalists and theoretical scientists working towards the common goal of producing more efficient materials. The comprehension of multi-phase photocatalytic systems is driven by the identification of key driving-forces in each optical, photophysical, photochemical, and redox reactions taking place on the component's interface. Therefore, precise elucidation of such nanoscale events should be accomplished using state-of-the-art techniques such as EELS, STEM, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF), TRMC, time-resolved spectroscopies, photoluminescence, UPS, XPS, XANES, EXAFS techniques, and DFT simulations, including in situ and in-operando studies, as well as synchrotron radiation. In light of these findings, multidisciplinary teams will be crucial to tackle current challenges, identify gaps, and accelerate the development of multi-phase, heterojunctions, and plasmonics nanocomposites for even broader applications."
