0,Introduction,"The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and biomass-derived chemicals (e.g., triglycerides, fatty acids) into fuel or value-added chemicals is essential not only for energy security but also for sustainable environment. Among several key steps involved, the ketonization of carboxylic acids [1–4] is important since it allows the simultaneous CC coupling and the removal of an oxygen atom. In this reaction, two molecules of the acid is coupled into a ketone with the liberation of CO2 and H2O, Eq (1). The lengthening of the carbon chain in the product with the loss of one carbon as CO2 further contributes to atom economy. Ketones with long hydrocarbon chains (i.e, fatty ketones) find some applications [5] in detergents, personal care products, etc. (1) RCOOH + RCOOH → R(C = O)R + CO2 + H2O The ketonization of carboxylic acids is catalyzed by metal oxides with basic sites [5–8] or with oxygen vacancy defects VO (which are closely linked to the coordinatively unsaturated sites or cus of the metal [3,9–12]). Widely-studied materials include ZrO2, CeO2, and TiO2. Particularly, TiO2 is active, relatively inexpensive, abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally benign. However, the TiO6 octahedra in anatase- or rutile-type TiO2 are densely connected in three dimensions, requiring a rather high reduction temperature to generate the VO defect. On the other hand, there are other titanium-based oxides with more opened structure such as alkali hexatitanate A 2Ti6O13 [13–15] (A = K, Na, Li), that contain some of the facilely removed cus O atoms [16]. As shown in Fig. 1 , three TiO6 octahedra are edge-shared in a row forming the ribbon. The ribbons are corner-shared resulting in the framework and the tunnel. The large K+ (and Na+) ion is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms [13,14], while the small Li+ ion is enclosed by three oxygen atoms [15]. Notably, some of the oxygen atoms (i.e., those close to the alkali ions) have a low coordination number such that they can be easily removed [16]. In addition, the (Ti6O13)2− framework presents a permanent negative charge unlike the neutral TiO2, thereby allowing ion exchange/insertion. For example, the Li+/Na+ exchange from molten LiNO3/Na2Ti6O13 [17] allows the synthesis of Li2Ti6O13 that cannot be directly prepared via a traditional solid state method. Herein, the formation of VO defects and also the structural (long range and local) stability of A 2Ti6O13 were investigated, as compared to anatase-type TiO2. The presence of the V O defects was deduced with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and also diffuse reflectance ultraviolet visible (DRUV-VIS) spectroscopy. These defects were tested for the ketonization of carboxylic acids, exemplified here using acetic acid, heptanoic acid, and lauric acid. The effect of reduction temperature and the type of a carrier gas (H2 vs N2) was discovered. The activity was compared and ranked by combining results from H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR) and the heat of formation of the oxygen-deficient A 2Ti6O13- x obtained via the density functional theory (DFT) calculations [16,18–22]. In addition to ketonization, we elaborated further that the formed ketone could be subsequently hydrogenated-dehydrated on the Pt-loaded, oxygen-deficient K2Ti6O13- x catalyst into long chain olefins. Here, we chose Pt (0–1.0 wt%) as an illustrative example, since Pt is well known to promote hydrogenation in a variety of substrates, in combination with the possibility of exhibiting the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect [23,24]. Unlike other works on acid-to-olefins via decarbonylation by metal supported catalysts [25–28], the catalytic system reported in this work provided a simultaneous CC coupling and oxygen removal at the minimal use of H2 in a single-bed flow reactor at 400 °C. While a closely related reaction has been reported [5,29] in a two-bed reactor using M/MgO (M = Pt, Ru, Pd) catalysts, the fatty acid was converted into alkanes, but not olefins. So, our direct acid-to-olefins opened up the possibility of producing value-added chemicals from biomass-derived feeds, complementing recent works on other routes [5,29–35]."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis The chemicals used for synthesis are commercially available reagents and were used as received, except the alkali salts which were dried at 120 °C overnight prior to use. K2Ti6O13 was prepared by calcining the stoichiometric mixture of KNO3 and P25-type TiO2 at 700 °C for 10 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under static air [36]. Na2Ti6O13 was prepared similarly from Na2CO3 and anatase-type TiO2 at 800 °C for 20 h [37]. The preparation of the lithium analog was slightly modified from the reported molten salt exchange method [17] as follows. The synthesized Na2Ti6O13 was mixed with 100 % excess LiNO3 in an alumina crucible, followed by heating at 350 °C for 7 days. The product was washed free from the salt by deionized water. Platinum-loaded yPt/K2Ti6O13 catalysts (y = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt% Pt) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using 1 M aqueous solution of Pt2+ from H2PtCl6·xH2O. This solution was impregnated over the as-made K2Ti6O13, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. All catalysts were kept in a desiccator prior to use."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected from a DMAX2200 Ultima + diffractometer (Rigaku) using the Cu Kα radiation from 2θ = 10-50°. Unit cell parameters were refined using CellCalc [38]. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded using an Autosorb-1 instrument (Quantachrome) after degassing the sample at 300 °C for 12 h. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were acquired from a EVO MA10 instrument (Zeiss) after gold sputtering. Chemical analyses were performed using a Tiger wavelength dispersive X-ray florescence spectrometer (Bruker). The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were collected using an Axis Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical), with a monochromatized Al Kα radiation under the internal pressure of 1 × 10−8 torr, in some cases after reduction with H2 (1 bar) at 400−500 °C for 2 h. The diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DRUV-VIS) spectra were collected using a T92 + UV/VIS spectrometer (PG instrument) in the absorbance mode at the 1.0-nm interval from 200−700 nm. An amount of ∼0.01 g of the sample was mixed with 5 g of BaSO4 and thoroughly grounded prior to the measurement. Raman spectra were recorded from the undiluted sample using a DXR Smart Raman (Thermoscientific) at the laser wavelength of 532 nm and the laser power of 5 mW. For temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2 TPR), ∼0.1 g of the sieved sample was activated in air (30 mL·min−1) from RT to 500 °C (10 °C min−1) for 2 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to RT under N2 (30 mL·min−1). After that, the reduction profile was recorded in the range 50−900 °C (5 °C min−1) under 10 %H2/Ar using a thermal conductivity detector. The amount of H2 desorbed (μmol H2 g−1) was calculated from the peak area, as calibrated from the reduction of a known amount of the CuO standard."
4,Catalytic activity testing,"2.3 Catalytic activity testing A fixed-bed flow reactor was employed and three model compounds were separately studied: 90 % v/v acetic acid in p-xylene, 10 % v/v n-heptanoic acid in p-xylene, and 5 % v/v lauric acid in n-dodecane. An amount of ∼0.2 g of the catalyst was pretreated under air at 500 °C for 2 h (10 °C min−1), followed by a H2 reduction at 400 °C for 2 h. In some cases, the reduction was performed at 500 °C or it was totally omitted. A 10 %H2/Ar was typically used as the carrier gas, though occasionally N2 was employed as well. The model compound was fed into the reactor by a syringe pump corresponding to the contact time (W/F) of 15 g·h·mol−1 for acetic acid, 50−250 g·h·mol−1 for heptanoic acid, and 250 g·h·mol−1 for lauric acid. The catalytic activity was evaluated at reaction temperature of 400 °C. The liquid products were collected by a water-ice trap every 60 min for a total time on stream of 360 min, and were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800) equipped with a DB-wax column (30m × 0.53 mm) or a DB-1 column (30m × 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector."
5,Computational method,"2.4 Computational method We used first-principles calculations based on density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximations parameterized by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) for the exchange-correlation energy [39]. The interactions between core and valence electrons were treated by the projector augmented wave method [40] as implemented in the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) codes [41]. The energy cutoff for expanding the plane-wave basis set was set at 500 eV. All atoms in the 126-atom supercell were allowed to relax fully until the Hellmann-Feynman forces became less than 0.01 eV·Å−1. The optimized crystal structures of A 2Ti6O13 (A = K, Na, Li) were the same as those reported in our previous work [16]. The likelihood of V O formation is ranked by the defect formation energy ΔHf (V O q ) [42] following Eq (2): (2) ΔHf (V O q ) = E tot(bulk) – E tot(V O q ) + μ O – q(E Fermi + EVBM ) where the first and second terms on the right hand side are the total energies of a perfect supercell, and a supercell containing one V O defect; μ O is the chemical potential of oxygen (set to half of the total energy of the O2 molecule); q is the charge state of V O defect; and E Fermi is the energy at the Fermi level, referenced to the energy at the valence band maximum EVBM . It is assumed that different types of A do not significantly alter the valence band position of A 2Ti6O13- x . The E tot(V O q ) of each A 2Ti6O13- x represents the lowest energy of the oxygen-deficient supercell, where the oxygen atom of different types and at different positions [16] have already been considered."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical properties of the alkali hexatitanate catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the alkali hexatitanate catalysts All samples after calcination are white powders. Their XRD patterns (Fig. 2 ) are characteristics of the monoclinic A 2Ti6O13 phase (A = K, JCPDS #74-0275; A = Na, JCPDS #73-1398; and A = Li, JCPDS #37-0952). The strongest peak at 2θ ∼11.5–11.9° (d ∼7.5–7.8 Å) is assigned to the 200 reflection, corresponding to the inter-tunnel distance along the a-axis. Unit cell parameters of these samples, tabulated in Table S1, are in reasonable agreement with the previous reports [14–16]. The samples are micrometer-sized rods as shown in Figure S1. The specific surface area SBET (m2 g−1) summarized in Table 1 , is in the order: K2Ti6O13 (21) > Li2Ti6O13 (16) > Na2Ti6O13 (9). This suggests that all catalyst samples are essentially non-porous and the observed difference in surface area is due solely the different particle sizes. The elemental composition, also shown in Table 1, indicates that the experimental A 2O and TiO2 contents (including the amount of Pt when applicable) are reasonably close to the nominal values. For example, we found 0.11 wt% Pt for 0.1 Pt/K2Ti6O13, and 0.80 wt% for 1 Pt/K2Ti6O13. Altogether, results from different characterizations provide a strong evidence for the successful synthesis of the alkali hexatitanate samples."
8,Reducibility and structural stability,"3.2 Reducibility and structural stability The reducibility of the as made samples was deduced from TPR experiments, as summarized in Fig. 3 . As for K2Ti6O13 (Fig. 3a), it shows a broad, unresolved reduction peak covering a wide temperature range (∼130−850 °C) with the peak Tp at 563 °C. Typically, the peak at such a high temperature is indicative of the reduction not only on the surface but also at the bulk (at least partially). Similarly, Na2Ti6O13 (Fig. 3c) shows a broad reduction peak but with a shift to a higher temperature (∼280−850 °C, Tp =660 °C). In contrast, the reduction of Li2Ti6O13 (Fig. 3d) starts at relatively high temperature, i.e, ∼500−650 °C but with a somewhat lower Tp =545 °C (the spike at low temperature was found to be an artifact). Notably, the onset of the reduction in the K2Ti6O13 and Na2Ti6O13 occurs at an early temperature compared to the reduction of anatase in Fig. 3e (∼400−830 °C, Tp =610 °C, which is consistent with the literature [43]). While the exact peak position in temperature-programmed experiments depends on several parameters [44,45], our results hint at the facile reduction of A2Ti6O13 (A = K, Na) in comparison to TiO2. The difficult reduction of Li2Ti6O13 (vs the other two members) can be explained by the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle [46]. Li+ is the hard acid which would bind strongly to the O atom, in contrast to the soft acids (Na+, K+) that bind relatively weakly to the O atom. The different magnitude of the alkali-O interaction can be expected to affect several microscopic processes including surface reduction, bulk-to-surface O migration (i.e., replenishment), lattice oxygen mobility, and so on. Considering A2Ti6O13 in general, it is assumed [16] that Eq. (3) occurs in the H2 TPR experiment: (3) A 2(Ti4+)6O13 + xH2 → A 2(Ti4+)6-2 x (Ti3+)2 x O13- x (Vo) x + xH2O That is, H2 removes the oxygen atom from A 2Ti6O13 in the form of water, generating the oxygen vacancy site VO . In turn, the creation of VO leads to the generation of a nearby cus Ti. Accordingly, the number of VO is equivalent to the number (i.e., mole) of H2 consumed, x, assuming the composition A 2Ti6O13- x (or TiO2- x ) at the end of the TPR experiments. It is found that, after the reduction up to 900 °C, the VO content of the catalyst samples is in the order: K2Ti6O13 (x = 0.78) > Na2Ti6O13 (x = 0.65) >> anatase (x = 0.0044) > Li2Ti6O13 (x = 0.0023). Apparently, the extent of the reduction (x) depends not only on SBET (surface reduction) but also on the nature of each catalyst (bulk reduction). This results indicates the A-dependent reduction behavior of A2Ti6O13, which occurs to a larger extent (for A = K, Na) than anatase and the A = Li member. Following Eq. (3), electronic compensation requires that VO generates twice as much as Ti3+ to preserve charge neutrality [47–49]. In line with this view, the post-TPR K2Ti6O13- x shows a broad absorption in the visible region (similar to the blue TiO2- x [49]), in addition to the typical adsorption at 200−400 nm for the as-made K2Ti6O13 sample. The blue color is in contrast to the as-made sample appearing white, as shown in Fig. 4 . Since the post-TPR K2Ti6O13- x has remained blue for more than 6 months under an ambient condition, Ti3+ could be both at surfaces and the bulk. Fig. 5 a shows the Ti 2p spectrum of the K2Ti6O13- x samples reduced at 400 °C and 500 °C, which are the reduction temperatures at which the ketonization activity will be investigated (later). For the 400 °C-reduced K2Ti6O13- x , the signal characteristics of Ti3+ [50] (463.7 eV, Ti 2p1/2; 457.9 eV, Ti 2p3/2) can be observed, in addition to that of Ti4+ (463.9, 458.3 eV) as anticipated [50,51]. (The list of the binding energy can be found in Table S2.) Ti3+ was similarly detected in the 500 °C-reduced K2Ti6O13- x but the Ti3+ fraction was reduced. On the contrary, only Ti4+ was detected (but not Ti3+) in the as made K2Ti6O13. With DRUV-VIS and XPS, it is clear that the reduced samples contain a significant fraction of surface Ti3+ and consequently the VO defect. In a supporting manner, the O1 s XPS spectra are depicted in Fig. 5b. Reduction at 400−500 °C results in the OI signal (529.0–529.1 eV), in addition to the lattice oxygens (OII, 529.6 eV; OIII, 530.7 eV) [50,51] which are present in all samples. Notably, the OI was observed only after reduction, and its binding energy is closer to that in Ti2O3 [50,51] (with the nominal Ti3+), as compared to the O atom in TiO2. The relatively low binding energy of OI in the reduced K2Ti6O13- x suggests that it is an electron rich species, presumably as a result of neighboring Ti4+ reduction. As with the Ti3+ signal, the content of OI decreased when the reduction temperature was increased. The change to the surface ratio of Ti3+ and OI species reported above might be explained by structural stability and the oxygen replenishment. The alkali hexatitanate samples showed sufficient stability after reduction as evidenced by the XRD patterns in Fig. 2, Figure S2. The two patterns (K2Ti6O13- x reduced 400 °C vs the as-made K2Ti6O13) are generally similar but differ in two additional, small peaks in the former (marked by ×) at 2θ ∼ 27.5, 36.1° (d = 3.24 and 2.49 Å). Notably for the reduced sample, the in plane reflections [e.g., (-201), (602), (-404)] are heavily broaden while those parallel to the cell edge [e.g., (200), (003), (020)] remain rather sharp. This finding suggests the bulk oxygen atom migration to the surfaces (i.e., O replenishment) during the reduction, such that the inside could be more disordered compared to the surfaces. So, this further suggests that the potassium hexatitanate was reduced by H2 not only on the surface but also partially at the bulk. Among the A 2Ti6O13- x , the peak broadening is particularly pronounced for A = K, which is consistent with the observed large H2 consumption in this catalyst. Yet, the long range structure is adequately maintain as judged from the preservation of the general XRD pattern. The coherent length of all samples was calculated using the Scherrer equation and the full width at half maximum of the 200 reflection as the representative. A ∼44–50 % decrease in the coherent length was observed in these samples after H2 reduction compared to the as made ones, as summarized in Table 1. Such a decrease might be explained by the bulk-to-surface oxygen migration discussed above, which decrease the extent of atomic ordering and therefore the coherent length. In addition, the local structure of the post-TPR samples was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Figure S3 shows that the spectra prior to vs post-TPR are generally similar for all alkali hexatitanate samples (and consistent with reported spectra [52,53]), indicating their sufficient stability under reducing condition. Again, the spectrum of the post-TPR K2Ti6O13- x is much broader than others, further emphasizing a more extensive local disorder in this catalyst. For Pt loaded K2Ti6O13- x (i.e., with 1 wt% Pt) two reduction events were completed at <300 °C as shown in Fig. 3b. This early and relatively sharp reduction is in contrast to the much broader reduction in K2Ti6O13- x finishing at ∼850 °C discussed previously. The first peak at Tp =154 °C can be ascribed to the reduction of Pt2+ to metallic Pt [43]. The second peak at Tp =240 °C is most likely due to the reduction of surface oxygen atoms in potassium hexatitanate, which is considerably shifted from Tp =563 °C in the Pt-free sample. The facile reduction to 1 Pt/K2Ti6O13-x might be explained by H2 spillover effect [54,55] known to occur in the system such as Pt/TiO2- x . Unfortunately, these effects prevent us from reliably calculating the Pt content and the extent of K2Ti6O13 reduction at present. So, the H2 consumptions in all Pt-incorporated samples are not included in Table 1. A more detailed account of these effects, including the morphological study of the formed Pt particles, will be reported elsewhere. The presence of the low temperature peaks in the H2 TPR profile of 1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x suggests that the surface reduction is predominant. In line with this view, the coherent length in 1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x (30 nm) is very close to that of the as made K2Ti6O13 (35 nm), but is clearly different from 17 nm of reduced K2Ti6O13- x . Likewise, the alkali hexatitanate structure was adequately preserved as seen in the XRD pattern in Fig. 2. Extra peaks (marked by ◼) at 2θ = 15.8°, 25.9° and 36.9° indicate the presence of additional, unidentified phase as a result of the H2 reduction. Yet, reflections due to the Pt metal (39.8° and 46.1°, JCPDS 00-004-0802) were not detected even at 1 wt% which is the highest Pt loading investigated here. This result suggests that Pt metal must be small in size and/or highly dispersed. Consistently, the SBET after loading nominally 0.1–1.0 wt% Pt is 17-19 m2 g−1, practically similar to 21 m2 g-1 for the as made K2Ti6O13. Moreover, there was no obvious difference in the microstructure between as made K2Ti6O13 and reduced 1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x , Figure S1."
9,Ketonization activity,"3.3 Ketonization activity The alkali hexatitanate catalysts were evaluated for the acetic acid ketonization activity at 400 °C under N2. In order to study the influence of VO , the catalysts were activated at 400 °C either under N2 where VO would be minimal (non-reduced, NR); or under H2 where a considerable concentration of VO was expected (reduced, R). Fig. 6 a-d show the time on stream dependence of the catalytic activity for all catalysts. Acetone was solely produced and the missing C-yield is due to CO2 as a co-product [Eq. (1)]. It was found that all non-reduced catalysts exhibited relatively low catalytic activity, with acetic acid conversion of only ∼5–7 % for A 2Ti6O13, and even zero conversion over anatase-type TiO2. In contrast, the catalytic activity is significantly increased upon H2 reduction, approximately by a factor of six. For example over K2Ti6O13- x , the acetic acid conversion is increased from ∼7 % to 32 %, while the acetone yield is increased from ∼4 % to 25 %. Similar enhancement in catalytic activity by H2 reduction was observed over Na2Ti6O13- x and Li2Ti6O13- x . Although anatase is considered inactive at the present condition, the reduction treatment still has noticeable (but small) positive effect. For the alkali hexatitanate catalysts, a correlation between the square of the VO content (i.e., x2 determined from TPR) vs acetic acid conversion can be observed as shown in Fig. 6e. While the number of data points is rather limited, this finding is still consistent with the widely accepted biomolecular reaction mechanism characteristics of ketonization [3]. The catalytic activity enhancement by H2 reduction in A 2Ti6O13- x can be explained by the known beneficial role of the VO defects toward acid ketonization [3,10]. As seen from H2 TPR and catalytic activity, the removal of the O atom is particularly facile for potassium and sodium hexatitanate. On the other hand, the reduction of Li2Ti6O13 does not occur as easily. We have carried out the preliminary DFT calculations to study the ease of forming the oxygen-deficient A 2Ti6O13- x . Here, it is assumed that a material containing a higher concentration of V O would require relatively low energy for V O formation [i.e., ΔHf (V O q ) in eq (2)], and vice versa. The V O defect in all A 2Ti6O13- x is a double shallow donor which does not create any level in the band gap, as stated in our previous report [16]. We found that the relative formation energy was in the order: Na (0 eV) < K (0.42 eV) < Li (1.38 eV). That is, the creation of the VO defect to give Na2Ti6O13- x requires the lowest energy, followed closely by K2Ti6O13- x . (The difference of ∼0.4 eV between these two catalysts is strongly dependent on computational details, and this is currently being investigated.) Meanwhile, it is clear that a much higher energy is required to create the VO defect in Li2Ti6O13- x , consistent with the recent work [21]. The facile formation of VO for K2Ti6O13- x and Na2Ti6O13- x (as opposed to Li2Ti6O13- x ) concluded from the DFT calculations is qualitatively consistent with the correlation between the ketonization activity and x2 . The beneficial role of the VO for ketonization activity also depends on the reduction temperature as shown in Fig. 7 . We observed a decrease in both acetic acid conversion (∼33 % to 25 %) and the yield of acetone (∼28 % to 19 %) when the reduction temperature is increased from 400 °C to 500 °C. This is presumably due to a decrease in surface VO when the catalyst is reduced at high temperature. As discussed previously, the VO defect can be qualitatively traced by the XPS signals of Ti3+ and OI (Fig. 5). So, its content can be compared by the peak area ratio Ti3+/Titotal and OI/Ototal. Accordingly, we found that the Ti3+/Titotal declines from 53 % to 40 %, and the OI/Ototal from 41 % to 33 % (Table S2), when the reduction temperature was increased. Such a decrease in the surface VO content (via the Ti3+/Titotal and OI /Ototal ratio) is parallel to the decrease in the ketonization activity. We postulate that at high temperature, the oxygen atom at the bulk could possess sufficient thermal energy so as to overcome the barrier for bulk-to-surface migration, such that the surface VO is decreased. Note that our recent in situ XAS study on K2Ti6O13 [16] also reported an increase-then-decrease Ti3+ (or VO ) content as the reduction temperature continually increased. While the exact turning point cannot be directly compared between the present work and in [16], there is clearly a maximum reduction temperature at which the Ti3+ (or the VO ) signal, and consequently the catalytic activity, is diminished. In addition to acetic acid, the deoxygenation of heptanoic acid via ketonization over K2Ti6O13- x (reduced at 400 °C for 2 h) can be achieved under a H2 carrier gas. Fig. 8 shows the heptanoic acid conversion and the liquid products yield as a function of the contact time (W/F, 100−250 g·h·mol−1) averaged from the time on stream of 60−360 min. It was found that heptanoic acid conversion is increased from ∼60 to 90 % as the W/F is increased. This finding is a strong indication for the catalytically-driven ketonization over the reduced potassium hexatitanate catalyst. The major liquid product 7-tridecanone (a C13 ketone) is most likely produced via ketonization of heptanoic acid. (The gaseous CO2 and H2O was indeed detected in a separate analysis, although their amount was not routinely quantified.) We found that 2-octanone was the most abundant minor product, with gradually increased yield from ∼0.1 % to 0.4 %. It is suggested that 2-octanone is derived from the CC bond cleavage at the α-β position (McLafferty rearrangement [10,56]) of 7-tridecanone. As with acetic acid, VO defects are considered essential for the ketonization of heptanoic acid. This is affirmed by the reaction under H2 vs N2 over K2Ti6O13- x . Clearly, a relatively stable heptanoic acid conversion of ∼75 % was achieved throughout the 300-min period under H2 (Fig. 9 ). On the contrary, the conversion under N2 was rapidly declined from 75 % to 50 %. This finding is expected since it is generally accepted [10] that H2 not only assist in the creation of the VO defects, but also enhances the hydrogen transfer, thereby preventing the coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
10,Direct conversion of fatty acid-to-olefins,"3.4 Direct conversion of fatty acid-to-olefins The direct acid-to-olefin conversion can be obtained by incorporating Pt on the K2Ti6O13 support to promote hydrogenation-dehydration of the ketone intermediate. The catalytic activity of the oxygen-deficient 0.1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x (reduced at 400 °C for 2 h) for heptanoic acid conversion as a function of the W/F is displayed in Fig. 10 . At low W/F, it was observed that the incorporation of 0.1 wt% Pt enhances heptanoic acid conversion (compare Fig. 10a vs Fig. 8). This is because a higher VO content would be generated upon reduction when Pt is incorporated via the SMSI effect [23,24] as evidenced by TPR in Fig. 3. At high W/F, an almost complete heptanoic acid conversion can be achieved in both cases. With 0.1 wt% Pt, the major product remains 7-tridecanone, but its yield reached a maximum followed by a decline. Importantly, a considerable increase in 7-tridecene, 1-, 2- and 3-hexene were observed (Fig. 10b), while none of which was previously detected without Pt. The formation of olefins can be explained by a series of reaction occurring at different active sites. The ketonization of heptanoic acid first occurs on the VO defects, producing 7-tridecanone as discussed previously. With the highly active Pt metal well known to promote hydrogenation [23,24], the formed ketone can be hydrogenated over the Pt site to an alcohol that could undergo rapid dehydration to generate 7-tridecene. It is very likely that the SMSI effect [57–59] was operating in the 0.1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x , thereby selectively hydrogenating the CO bond of the ketone (but not CC bond in the olefin products). The SMSI effect might as well generate vacancies acting as acid sites and promoting the alcohol dehydration. In addition, the formation of several isomers of hexenes suggests the direct decarbonylation of heptanoic acid to hexenes. This reaction and their isomerization is also known to be catalyzed by Pt-based catalysts [25–28]. Meanwhile, the small amount of n-hexane at higher W/F suggests the hydrogenation of some hexenes. Lastly, the presence of a small amount of n-heptane suggests the hydrogenolysis of heptanoic acid that is likely promoted by the excess Pt sites. The optimum acid-to-olefins transformation proposed here depends on the Pt content. Table 2 compares the heptanoic acid conversion and the liquid products yields over the yPt/K2Ti6O13- x catalysts with the nominal Pt content (y) of 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt%. It was found that the heptanoic acid conversion is increased from ∼74–88 % with y = 0, 0.1 to an almost complete conversion at y > 0.5. The increased conversion is as expected considering the SMSI effect as discussed above. It was also found that the liquid olefins yields over yPt/K2Ti6O13- x were ∼0, 7, 32 and 29 % for y = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 respectively. The 0.5 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x catalyst provides the highest olefins yield (∼32 %), and at the same time gives the lowest ketone yield. This finding further supports our proposed reaction pathway that the formed ketone is a major source of olefins, presumably via hydrogenation-dehydration. However, at y > 0.5, a sharp increase in the paraffin yield was observed (3- or 4-fold from that at y = 0.1). This is likely due to the additional hydrogenolysis activity of excess Pt sites, as deduced from a decrease in total liquid yields and the presence of light gases (e.g., methane, ethane) in a separate analysis (not shown). While the paraffin is diesel-like and can find potential use as the fuel, it is of interest to optimize the catalyst further for selective olefins formation via e.g., alloying of Pt with Sn, Fe, Ru, Pd [60,61]. Such work is in progress and will be reported elsewhere. Different experimental conditions makes a comparison of our olefins yield vs that reported in the literature less straightforward. Yet, our present system produced adequate olefins yield at 400 °C in a single-bed flow reactor, and can be operated at atmospheric pressure of 10 %H2/Ar. In addition to heptanoic acid as a model feed, this approach can be applied for the long-chain olefins production from a fatty acid, i.e. lauric acid, a C12 acid. Fig. 11 a shows the lauric acid conversion and liquid products yields as a function of time on stream over 0.1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x . The complete lauric acid conversion was again achieved and remained stable at 400 °C. It was found that 12-tricosanone [(C11H23)2(C = O)], a C23 ketone, was the major product at ∼57 % yield. The hydrogenation-dehydration of this ketone (which is analogous to 7-tridecanone produced from heptanoic acid) produces ∼14 % of 12-tricosene (a C23H46 olefin). Other olefins includes ∼14 % undecene (C11H22) from decarbonylation of lauric acid; and ∼9 % dodecene (C12H24) from direct hydrogenation-dehydration of lauric acid. Hydrogenation of these olefins produces a small amount of the saturated hydrocarbons such as tricosane (C23H48) and dodecane (C12H26). Altogether, while the reaction condition has not yet been fully optimized, we achieved a ∼37 % yield of olefins (a combination of C23, C12 and C11) at the complete conversion of lauric acid (C12) over 0.1 Pt/K2Ti6O13- x ."
11,Conclusion,"It was found that for the potassium and sodium hexatitanate A 2Ti6O13 (A = K, Na), the extent of reduction (i.e., the formation of oxygen vacancy defects V O ) is larger than that of A = Li and also the anatase-type TiO2. The presence of VO can be deduced through the Ti3+ signal by XPS and by the absorption similar to the blue TiO2- x by DRUV-VIS. This defect is essential for ketonization as seen from the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in reduced catalysts, compared to a much smaller activity for non-reduced catalysts. The reaction is second order as deduced from the linear correlation between the square of the V O content and the acetic acid ketonization activity. Over yPt/K2Ti6O13- x (y = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt% Pt), the direct acid-to-olefins conversion can be promoted under atmospheric 10 %H2/Ar at 400 °C. The ketonization of the acid took place over the V O defects, prior to the selective ketone hydrogenation over the Pt site, and the subsequent dehydration into the long-chain olefins. The Pt content and hence the SMSI effect contribute significantly to the acid conversion and the selectivity to olefins products. Over the Pt-loaded, oxygen-deficient K2Ti6O13- x , the liquid olefins yields of ∼30–40 % from heptanoic acid and lauric acid can be obtained. Importantly, the number of carbon atoms in the olefins is significantly increased compared to the starting acids (i.e., C13 olefin from C7 acid, and C23 olefin from C12 acid). The direct acid-to-olefins conversion reported herein is potentially applicable to biomass-derived fatty acids, providing a promising platform for the production of value-added products."
