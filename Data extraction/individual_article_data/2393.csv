0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are causing global climate change, mainly due to the emission of pollutants such as CO2 and CH4 from the combustion of these fuels. Consequently, there is an array of research projects to find alternative energy sources that are renewable and environmentally friendly [1]. Hydrogen satisfies the above requirements because water is the only by-product of its combustion. Hydrogen can be produced by a number of processes, including electrolysis of water, thermocatalytic reformation of hydrogen rich organic compounds, and biological processes [2]. The biological hydrogen production process includes photosynthetic hydrogen production and dark fermentation. This biological process is friendlier to the environment and less energy intensive when compared to other processes e.g. the electrolysis of water [3]. In comparison to photosynthetic hydrogen production, dark fermentative hydrogen production has the advantages of greater hydrogen production rates, greater versatility of the substrates used and is able to operate in the absence of light. Environmental factors are crucial for the dark fermentation process. The pH is very important for enzyme activity [4] while a substrate at a high concentration may cause inhibitory effects and lead to a decrease in the hydrogen production rate and yield [5]. High temperature could increase the rate of the biochemical process and/or change the composition of the microbial community, which could result in higher hydrogen yield and less variety of fermentation end-products than mesophillic conditions [6]. Hydrogen production yields between 0.79 and 2.01 mol H2/mol sugarconsumed are normally obtained with mesophiles. However, yields of greater than 2.28 mol H2/mol sugarconsumed have been obtained with thermophiles [3,5–8]. Consequently, a hydrogen production in thermophilic conditions has drawn the interest of researchers. Oil palm is one of the most important industrial crops in Thailand. In 2010, there were around 624,000 ha of oil palm planting areas distributed over 25 provinces of the country, mainly in the South [9]. Palm trees generally start bearing oil-containing fruits 3 years after planting, with productivity decreasing after 20–25 years. Therefore, it is necessary to cut the old palm trees and replant new seedlings at plantation sites to maintain the oil productivity. In Thailand, most of the old palm trees, around 81 million cubic meters per year, are cut and discarded or burnt at the plantation site [9]. This can cause environmental problems because of toxic gasses that are emitted during combustion. The trunk, leaves and shell of the oil palm tree are lignocellulosic materials that yield cellulose and monosugars such as glucose, xylose and arabinose after pretreatment. These sugars could be used as substrate to produce renewable energy such as ethanol and hydrogen by microbial fermentation. Oil Palm Trunk (OPT) is made up of three main structural components: cellulose 34.5%, hemicellulose (mainly xylan) 31.8% and lignin 25.7% [10]. These components can be liberated by hydrolysis and subsequently fermented by microorganisms to form different chemicals. For example, dilute acid treatment of OPT yields a solution containing mainly glucose and xylose [11], which could be used to produce hydrogen by various types of microorganisms such as Clostridium sp. HR-1, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain W16 and ∆ldh mutant of T. aotearoense with yields of 2.01, 2.37 and 2.28 mol H2 mol/mol mixed sugar, respectively [8,12]. Among the various conventional pretreatment methods, such as steam explosion, autoclave, acid and alkaline pretreatments, the dilute acid hydrolysis method has been widely used to hydrolyze lignocellulosic materials because it is effective and inexpensive. However, the traditional thermal acid pretreatment method produces inhibitors e.g. furfural, acetic acid and hydroxymethyl furfural that can inhibit bacterial growth and sugars production; it is also considered a time consuming method. There has been a lot of recent interest in microwave irradiation to pretreat lignocellulosic materials with the main advantage of being able to decrease reaction time from hours to minutes. The sudden rise of temperature by rapid rotation of dipole, such as water, by alternating the electric field is the key for rapid hydrolysis of the materials by microwave [13]. For example, it has been reported that the successive saccharification of wheat straw [14] and rice straw [15] by microwave/chemical pretreatment has resulted in an increase in sugar yield and a shorter reaction time. Therefore, this study employed the microwave assisted acid pretreatment method in order to achieve the highest sugar yield possible in the hydrolysis of OPT within a short reaction time. The goal of this research is to produce hydrogen from OPT hydrolysate by dark fermentation under thermoplilic anaerobic conditions. In order to achieve this goal, we first optimized the conditions for OPT hydrolysis by microwave-assisted H2SO4 pretreatment employing response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). It was hoped that OPT hydrolysate suitable as a substrate (high sugar concentrations and low growth inhibitors) for producing hydrogen could be obtained. The next step was the investigation by RSM and CCD of the three most important factors affecting hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate i.e., initial pH, initial total sugar concentration and NaHCO3 concentration. This approach will not only add value to OPT, in the form of safe and clean energy, but will also be a solution approach for making use of the abundant waste i.e., OPT."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Enrichment of thermophilic hydrogen producers from hot spring sediment,"2.1 Enrichment of thermophilic hydrogen producers from hot spring sediment The hot spring sediment was collected from the Southern part of Thailand. The temperature and pH of the sampling site was 80 °C and 7.8, respectively. Enrichment of the thermophilic hydrogen producer from the hot spring sediment, three replications, was conducted under anaerobic conditions in 120 mL serum bottles with a 70 mL working volume made up of 7 mL sediment-rich water and 63 mL enrichment medium. The enrichment medium was prepared using 20 g/L of mixed sugars, which was made up of 12 g/L xylose, 6 g/L glucose and 2 g/L arabinose. This was supplemented with inorganic nutrient that contained 5.24 g/L NH4HCO3, 6.72 g/L NaHCO3 and 1 mL/L each of 125 K2HPO4, 100 MgCl2·6H2O, 15 MnSO4·6H2O, 2.5 FeSO4·7H2O, 5 CuSO4·5H2O and 0.125 CoCl2·5H2O solution [16]. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 by 3 N NaOH or 3 N HCl. The bottles were incubated at 55 °C in a water bath. Three successive batch cycles (10% inoculum in the medium with 48 h cultivation per cycle) were conducted. The enriched culture obtained from the third batch cycle was pooled and further used as the seed inoculum for hydrogen production experiments. The microbial community analysis of the enriched cultures was analyzed by the PCR-DGGE technique."
3,Pretreatment of OPT,"2.2 Pretreatment of OPT The OPT was collected from the farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. It was chopped by knife, ground by a food blending machine and then passed through a 2 mm screen. The ground OPT was kept in plastic bags at room temperature prior to use. The microwave-H2SO4 pretreatment was carried out in a Samsung/M1817 microwave oven at a fixed power of 450 W. The 30 g of ground OPT was placed in a 500 mL laboratory glass bottle containing 450 mL of dilute H2SO4 and put in the microwave. The concentration of the H2SO4 and the reaction time for microwave pretreatment was adjusted according to the experimental design. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Following pretreatment, a solid residue was separated by filtration through a thin layer cloth. The pH of the hydrolysate was adjusted to 10 with Ca(OH)2 and the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min. It was then re-acidified to pH 7, followed by further centrifugation at the same rpm and centrifugation time [17]. The supernatant was collected and analyzed for the concentrations of sugars (glucose, xylose, arabinose) and inhibitors (furfural, acetic acid) by HPLC. The supernatant from the treatment that gave the highest sugars and lowest inhibitor concentrations was used as the substrate in the hydrogen production experiment and stored at −20 °C, prior to use."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design RSM with CCD was used to evaluate the main and interaction effects of two independent factors (Table 1 ) i.e., the dilute H2SO4 concentration and the reaction time for microwave pretreatment. The total sugar (glucose, xylose, arabinose) concentration and total inhibitor (furfural, acetic acid) concentration were selected as the dependent output variables. For statistical calculations, the test factors (X i) were coded as x i according to the following transformation equation (Eq. (1)): (1) x i = ( X i − X 0 ) / Δ X i where x i is the coded value of the variable, X i is the actual value of the independent variable, X o is the actual value of X i at the center point, and ΔX i is the step change value. A quadratic model (Eq. (2)) [18] was used to evaluate the optimization of the pretreatment factors: (2) Y i = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β ii x i 2 + ∑ β ij x i x j where Y i is the predicted responses, x i is the parameters, β 0 is a constant, β i is the linear coefficients, β ii is the squared coefficients, and β ij is the cross-product coefficients. The response variables (total sugar and total inhibitors concentrations) were fitted using a predictive polynomial quadratic equation (Eq. (2)) in order to correlate the response variable to the independent variables. The total sugar and total inhibitor concentrations were regressed with respect to H2SO4 concentration and reaction time for microwave pretreatment. The Design-Expert 7.0.0 Demo version (Stat-Ease Inc., MN, USA) software was used for the regression and graphical analysis of the experimental data obtained. A differentiation calculation was then employed to predict the optimum values of different factors giving the OPT hydrolysate with high total sugar and low total inhibitors concentrations. The quality of the fit of quadratic model was expressed by the coefficient of determination, R 2, and its statistical significance was checked by F-test using the Design-Expert 7.0.0 Demo version software (Stat-Ease. Inc., MN, USA)."
5,Batch hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate,"2.4 Batch hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate The batch hydrogen fermentation was conducted in 50 mL serum bottle containing 29 mL of fermentative medium and 1 mL of enriched hydrogen producer (7.2 g/L of inoculum as measured by volatile suspended solid (VSS)). OPT hydrolysate supplemented with inorganic nutrient containing 5.24 g/L NH4HCO3 and 1 mL/L each of 125 K2HPO4, 100 MgCl2·6H2O, 15 MnSO4·6H2O, 2.5 FeSO4·7H2O, 5 CuSO4·5H2O and 0.125 CoCl2·5H2O solution [16] was used as the fermentative medium. In this experiment, NH4HCO3 in the inorganic nutrient was used as the initial alkalinity. RSM with CCD was used to evaluate the main and interaction effects of three independent factors (Table 2 ) i.e., the initial pH, the total sugar (in OPT hydrolysate) concentration and the NaHCO3 concentration for hydrogen production. The initial pH, total sugar (in OPT hydrolysate) concentration and NaHCO3 concentration of the fermentative medium were adjusted according to the experimental design (Table 2). The pH of the medium was adjusted to the designated value using 3 N NaOH or 3 N HCl. The serum bottle was purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition, capped with a rubber stopper, and incubated at 55 °C in a water bath. The experiments were performed in triplicate. For statistical calculations, the test factors (X i) were coded as x i (Eq. (1)). A quadratic model (Eq. (2)) [18] was used to evaluate the effect of each independent variable on the hydrogen production potential (P s) as response (dependent variable). The P s values were regressed with respect to the initial pH, initial total sugar concentration and initial NaHCO3 concentration. The regression and graphical analysis of the experimental data obtained and the optimum values of different factors for the maximum P s were calculated using the Design-Expert 7.0.0 Demo version software (Stat-Ease. Inc., MN, USA). The quality of the fit of quadratic model was expressed by the coefficient of determination, R 2, and the statistical significance was checked by F-test."
6,Analytical procedures,"2.5 Analytical procedures 2.5.1 Compositions of OPT hydrolysate and fermentative broth OPT hydrolysate was filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane prior to analysis for sugar and inhibitor concentrations by HPLC. The fermented broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was acidified by 0.2N oxalic acid and filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane filter before being analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol concentrations by HPLC. The concentration of sugars (glucose, xylose and arabinose), furfural, VFAs (acetic, butyric, lactic and formic acids), and alcohols (ethanol and butanol) in liquid samples were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu LC-10AD) with an Aminex HPX-87H column following the method of Fangkum and Reungsang [19]. 2.5.2 Volume and composition of biogas The volume of biogas was determined using wetted glass syringes of 20–50 mL [20]. The biogas produced was collected at the interval time and analyzed for hydrogen content by Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with a 2 m stainless column packed with Shin carbon (50/80 mesh) following the method of Fangkum and Reungsang [19]. The cumulative hydrogen production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of hydrogen produced at each time interval was calculated using the mass balance equation [21]. The hydrogen production rate (HPR; mL H2/L.day) was calculated from the cumulative hydrogen gas volume divided by the fermentation time (day). Hydrogen yield (HY) was calculated as the total molaric amount of hydrogen divided by the total molaric amount of sugar consumed (mol-H2/mol-total sugar consumed). The total molaric amount of hydrogen was calculated using the ideal gas law."
7,Kinetic analysis,"2.6 Kinetic analysis The cumulative hydrogen production in the experiments is described by the following modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (3)) [22]: (3) H = P s exp { − exp ( R m e P s ( λ − t + 1 ) ) } where H is the cumulative hydrogen produced (mL/L medium), P s is the hydrogen production potential (mL/L medium), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/L h), λ is the lag-phase time (h), t is the incubation time (h) and e is 2.718281828. Parameters (P s, Rm and λ) were estimated using the solver function in Sigmaplot 10 (Systat Software Inc., USA) as explained by Khanal et al. [22]."
8,Microbial community analysis,"2.7 Microbial community analysis Total genomic DNA was extracted from enriched cultures and fermentative broth collected from the steady state of the optimum condition using a modified phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol method [23]. After DNA extraction, two steps of PCR amplification were employed in this study. For the 16S rDNA analysis, a universal primer set including forward primer PA 19-38 (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and reverse primer PH 1541-1561 (5′-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3′) was used for amplifying an approximately 1500 bp fragment of bacterial 16S rDNA. PCR amplification was conducted in a Px2 thermal cycler (Thermo, USA) using the following protocol: initial denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, extension for 2 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. For the DGGE profile analysis, PCR amplification was used on the primer set of 357f with GC clamp (5′-CGCCCGCCG CGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 518r (5′-ATTACCGCGCTGCTGG-3′) [24]. PCR amplification was conducted in a Px2 thermal cycler (Thermo, USA) using the protocol of Sreela-or et al. [23]. The DGGE analysis of PCR products was performed by electrophoresis for 20 min at 20 V and 16 h at 70 V through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a linear gradient of denaturant ranging from 30% to 70% in 0.5x TAE buffer at a constant temperature of 60 °C. The gel was stained with SYBR-Gold (1000 ng mL/L) for 20 min and visualized on a UV transilluminator.Most of the bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified with the forward primer without a GC clamp and the reverse primer. After re-amplification, the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN,USA) and sequenced using primer 518r, 357f and an ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by database searches in GenBank using BLAST [25]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Microwave pretreatment of OPT,"3.1 Microwave pretreatment of OPT 3.1.1 Fitting the model The effects of dilute H2SO4 concentration (X 1) and microwave reaction time (X 2) on two responses i.e., total sugar (Ysugar ) and total inhibitor (Yinhibitor ) concentrations were investigated during the microwave pretreatment of OPT. The regression models are shown in Eq. (4) and (5). (4) Y s u g a r = 26.76 + 2.85 X 1 + 4.74 X 2 + 3.26 X 1 X 2 − 5.78 X 1 2 − 4.81 X 2 2 (5) Y i n h i b i t o r = 3.72 + 0.91 X 1 + 1.04 X 2 + 0.54 X 1 X 2 − 0.88 X 1 2 − 1.03 X 2 2 The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and the adequacy of the regression models plus the significance of the coefficients are shown in Table 3 . The high values of the correlation coefficient for the response (R2 ) of 0.967 and 0.993 implied that the models accurately representated the experimental data. The Fisher’s F-test with a very low probability (P < 0.0001) also suggested that the models significantly represented the data. The regression analysis results indicated that the linear model terms (X1 and X1 ), quadratic model terms (X1 2 and X2 2 ) and the interactive model terms (X1X2 ) are significant (P < 0.05). In addition, the lack of fits for both models were insignificant (P > 0.05). From these results, it could be concluded that the obtained models accurately represented the data for all predictions. 3.1.2 Hydrolysate composition and RSM analysis The observed values of sugar and inhibitor concentrations, the predicted values of total sugar and the total inhibitor concentrations obtained from each condition are summarized in Table 1. Glucose (7.46–12.57 g/L), xylose (2.30–11.16 g/L) and arabinose (0.45–5.27 g/L) were the main sugars observed in the OPT hydrolysate (Table 1). The degradation of hemicelluloses normally release xylose and arabinose and the degradation of cellulose normally releases glucose [26]. The response surface plot representing the interaction effect of dilute H2SO4 concentration and reaction time on total sugar concentration based on Eq. (4) is shown in Fig. 1 A. The increase in H2SO4 concentration and reaction time significantly increased the total sugar concentration to a peak value of 28.23 g/L at the H2SO4 concentration of 2.4% and reaction time of 14.65 min (Fig. 1A). An increase in acid concentration or reaction time in the microwave-assisted acid pretreatment provides strong or complete reaction for the solubilization of the lignocellulosic material components leading to an increase in the total sugar concentration in the hydrolysate [13]. However, a further increase in the H2SO4 concentration and reaction time resulted in a decrease in total sugar concentration (Fig. 1A). A long microwave irradiation time and high acid concentration might result in the secondary decomposition of the sugars to other derivatives such as formic acid, levulinic acid and hydroxymethylfurfural [26–28]. This could result in the reduction of sugar concentrations in the hydrolysate. Acetic acid was detected as the only inhibitor in the hydrolysate at concentrations between 0.25 and 4.12 g/L. Acetic acid is released when the hydrolysis takes place at the acetyl group of hemicelluloses [26]. Furfural was not detected in any treatment (Table 1). The response surface plot showing the interaction effect of H2SO4 concentration and reaction time on acetic acid concentration based on Eq. (5) is shown in Fig. 1B. Within the experimental range, the predicted highest acetic acid concentration of 2.57 g/L was obtained at 1.47% H2SO4 and 8.15 min reaction time while the lowest acetic acid concentration of 0.40 g/L was obtained at 1.0% H2SO4 and 5 min reaction time (Fig. 1B). The concentration of acetic acid increased with the increase in H2SO4 concentration and reaction time from 1.0 to 1.47% and 5–8.15 min respectively. A slight decrease in acetic acid concentration was observed when the H2SO4 concentration and reaction time were further increased (Fig. 1B). 3.1.3 Optimization and confirmation of the results In order to efficiently use OPT hydrolysate as the substrate to produce hydrogen, the hydrolysate of OPT containing high total sugar but low inhibitor concentrations is needed. Sugars in the hydrolysate can be used as substrate for hydrogen production whereas acetic acid can inhibit the fermentation process. Van Ginkel and Logan [29] reported that the undissociated acetic acid concentrations of 3.0 g/L (50 mM) or more could almost completely inhibit hydrogen production because it can promote solventogenesis processes. Acetic acid concentration ranging between 4 and 10 g/L can be an inhibitor for microbial growth due to its ability to diffuse through the cell membrane and increase intracellular pH; causing an adverse effect on microbial metabolisms [30]. Based on these published results, the criteria of Ysugar = maximum value and Yinhibitor ≤ 2.5 g/L was set as the constraints on optimization in order to simultaneously achieve a high total sugar concentration and a low inhibitor concentration (below the inhibitory level of the fermentation process). Using this criteria, the optimum condition for microwave-assisted acid pretreatment of OPT was found to be 1.56% H2SO4 and 7.50 min microwave reaction time. A total sugar concentration of 21.23 g/L and an inhibitor concentration of 2.50 g/L were predicted at this optimum point. To reconfirm the adequacy of the model, three replications of the experiment were conducted at the optimum, medium (run 11), high (run 3) and worst (run 2) conditions (Table 4 ). The observed results (Table 4) are in close agreement with the predicted values (Table 1).The total sugar concentration of 21.80 g/L and acetic acid concentration of 2.61 g/L were obtained at the optimum condition (Table 4). These results indicate that the model is satisfactory and accurate. The results of OPT hydrolysis using microwave-assisted acid pretreatment in this study were comparable to the results of using any of the other pretreatment methods in which a higher total sugar concentration could be obtained, even though the liquid to solid ratio was higher than the reported data (Table 5 ). We found that the microwave-assisted acid pretreatment was considered superior to the steam explosion followed by acid hydrolysis autoclave pretreatment methods (Table 5) in terms of a shorter reaction time. Microwave irradiation can damage the structure of the lignocellulosic materials by sudden rises in temperature and the internal pressure of the cells. This in turn can result in the ultrastucture change of cellulose and the degradation of hemicellulose and lignin [32]. The H+ and SO4 + ions in the hydrolysis solution were activated easily by microwave energy. The hydrolysis reaction was then enhanced via an increase in molecular movement by microwave irradiation [26,33,34]. Therefore, the microwave-assisted pretreatment is able to decrease the reaction time in comparison to the other pretreatment methods."
11,Hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate,"3.2 Hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate 3.2.1 Fitting the model and RSM analysis The effects of initial pH (X 1), initial substrate concentration (X 2) and NaHCO3 concentration (X 3) on hydrogen production potential (P s) were investigated during hydrogen fermentation. The results showed that P s ranged from 0 to 2226.62 mL H2/L medium (Table 2).The maximum P s of 2226.62 mL H2/L medium was obtained in run 4, however, no hydrogen was produced on run 19 (Table 2). The regression model is shown in Eq. (6) (6) Y Ps = 1902.21 + 290.82 X 1 + 154.77 X 2 − 18.22 X 3 + 261.28 X 1 X 2 + 38.05 X 1 X 3 − 19.93 X 2 X 3 − 483.36 X 1 2 − 575.474 X 2 2 − 488.1 X 3 2 The ANOVA (Table 6 ) was conducted to test the significance of fit for the obtained polynomial equation. The model of P s presented a high determination coefficient (R2 0.9726) and the value of the adjusted determination coefficient (R2 0.9482). The regression analysis of the model indicated that the model was significant; this was evident from the Fisher’s F-test with a very low probability (P< 0.0001) and the insignificant lack of fit (P = 0.6294). From these results, it could be concluded that the obtained models accurately represent the data for all predictions. The results also showed that the linear effect and quadratic effect of the initial pH and the initial substrate concentration, the interactive effect between the initial pH and initial substrate concentration on P s were significant (P < 0.05). This indicates that these terms had a high impact on P s. The concentration of NaHCO3 had little impact on P s in which its linear and quadratic effects, as well as its interaction effect with the initial pH and initial substrate concentration were insignificant. By solving the inverse matrix from Eq. (6), the optimum condition for hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate by anaerobic mixed cultures were an initial pH of 6.03, an initial substrate concentration of 22.07 g/L and a NaHCO3 concentration of 6.71 g/L. Under these conditions, the maximum predicted P s of 1969.26 mL H2/L medium could be obtained. The response surface plot based on Eq. (6) with one variable being kept constant at its optimum level and the other two variables varying within the experimental range is shown in Fig. 2 A–C. The response surface of P s indicated a clear peak, which means that the maximum P s could be achieved inside the designed boundary. The P s increased with an increase in initial pH from 4.00 to 6.01, and then decreased when the initial pH was further increased above 6.01 (Fig. 2A and B). The pH is the most important factor affecting hydrogen production. The optimum pH values for hydrogen production are varied and depend on the type of hydrogen producers used. The weak acid condition (pH 5.0–6.5) was reported to be suitable for hydrogen production by many species of hydrogen producers such as Clostridium sp. [3,17,35], Enterobacter sp. [36] and Thermoanaerobacter sp. [7,8,11]. A low hydrogen production in the acidic condition might be due to the shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis, which is the route microorganisms take to prevent obstructions in their metabolic flux. In addition, the acid in the medium can pass through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and inhibit the growth of microorganisms as well as their abilities to produce hydrogen [37]. Increasing the initial pH would delay the beginning of the inhibition caused by the metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis [38]. However, an initial pH higher than the optimum value can cause negative effects on the hydrogenase activity and metabolic pathways of the hydrogen-producing bacteria, resulting in low hydrogen production efficiency [35,36,39]. An increase in initial substrate concentration from 10.00 g/L to 21.22 g/L resulted in an increase in P s (Fig. 2A and C). However, a further increase in initial substrate concentration above 21.22 g/L caused a reduction in P s. The low P s obtained at the low initial substrate concentration was mainly due to the exhausted substrate while a low P s at the high initial substrate concentration was caused by substrate inhibition [40]. In addition, the high substrate (sugar in this case) concentration resulted in the large quantities of acids produced as by products and a partial pressure accumulation. These could lead to a solventogenesis process that could directly decrease hydrogen production [41]. The interaction between the initial pH and initial substrate concentration was significant on P s (Table 2, Fig. 1A). The interactive effect of a low initial pH and a high initial substrate concentration caused a strong inhibition on hydrogen production, which was indicated by the obtainment of a low P s value (Fig. 1A). An increase in the initial pH at a high initial substrate concentration could reduce the inhibition effect on hydrogen production, which was indicated by an increase in P s (Fig. 1A). This may be due to the fact that at a high initial substrate concentration, large amounts of soluble metabolite products (SMPs) (mainly VFAs) would be produced and accumulated, resulting in a rapid drop of pH in the fermentation broth. Therefore, if the initial pH was low, a rapid drop of pH in the fermented broth to an inhibitory level would occur and in turn, the hydrogen production would rapidly stop, resulting in a reduction of P s. In contrast, if the initial pH was high, the decline in pH to the inhibitory level could be slowed down, as a result, the hydrogen production could be improved. A very high initial pH value of more than 6.03 caused the decrease in the P s value in any range of initial substrate concentration (Fig. 1A). This might be due to the negative effect of a high pH value on hydrogenase activity as described elsewhere [35,36,39]. The NaHCO3 concentration showed a similar effect to the initial pH and initial substrate concentration on P s (Fig. 2B and C). The NaHCO3 functions as a buffer that could decrease the pH fluctuation of the fermentation medium caused by VFAs accumulated during hydrogen production. However, a high concentration of NaHCO3 could increase CO2 by dissolution of carbonate in the system, hence decreasing the hydrogen content in the gas phase [42]. Therefore, the optimization of NaHCO3 concentration is needed in order to achieve a high P s as well as an effective hydrogen production process. 3.2.2 Optimization and confirmation of the results The optimum condition for hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate for maximizing P s were an initial pH of 6.03, an initial substrate concentration of 22.07 g/L and a NaHCO3 concentration of 6.71 g/L. The maximum predicted value of P s was 1969.26 mL H2/L medium (Table 7 ). To reconfirm the adequacy of the model, three replications of the experiments were conducted at the optimum, medium, high and worst conditions (Table 7). The close agreement between observed and predicted results verified the validity of the model and reflected the existence of the optimum point (Table 7). The observed P s of 1947.61 mL H2/L medium was obtained at the optimum condition, which is only 1.10% different from the predicted maximum value of 1969.26 mL H2/L medium. The maximum HPR and HY of 259.68 mL H2/L day and 0.71 mol H2/mol sugar consumed, respectively, were obtained at the optimum condition (Table 7). The results suggest that RSM with CCD is a useful tool to optimize the production of hydrogen from OPT hydrolysate by anaerobic mixed cultures. The SMPs in the fermentation broth were determined at the steady state of hydrogen production in the confirmation experiment (Table 7). The results indicated that the hydrogen production was accompanied by VFAs production. The main SMPs were butyric acid, acetic acid and ethanol with small amounts of lactic and propionic acids detected (Table 7). At the optimum condition, butyric acid, acetic acid and ethanol constituted of 64.62%, 26.78% and 5.60%, respectively, of the total metabolites. The detection of butyric and acetic acids is a good indicator of effective hydrogen fermentation [17,19]. Theoretically, 2 mol of hydrogen are produced when butyrate is the main metabolite while 4 mol of hydrogen are produced from glucose concomitantly with 2 mol of acetate [39]. The presence of a greater amount of butyrate than acetate in this study indicated that the hydrogen fermentation was butyrate type fermentation. The relatively high concentration of ethanol (0.24 g/L) disfavored hydrogen production in which the hydrogen might be consumed to reduce the acids to alcohols, thus resulting in the low hydrogen yield obtained [43]. The results at the optimum condition in this study were compared to the results from other experiments using the hydrolysate of cellulosic materials as substrate for hydrogen production (Table 8 ). The HY obtained in this study were comparable to those obtained in the studies by Almarsdottir et al. [44]. However, the HY were much lower than the studies by Hniman et al. [11], Liu et al. [45] and Cao et al. [46]. The different in the HY might be due to the fermentation conditions, compositions of the hydrolysate and microorganisms used in each experiment."
12,Microbial community analysis,"3.3 Microbial community analysis The DGGE profiles of seed inocula enriched in mixed sugars (glucose, xylose and arabinose) are shown in Lane A (Fig. 3 ) while the DGGE profiles of seed inocula at a steady state of optimum condition for hydrogen production are depicted in Lane B (Fig. 3). Each band on the DGGE profile corresponds to a fragment of 16 S rDNA sequences and represents a specific species in the microbial community [47]. The staining intensity of a band represents the relative abundance of that microbial species [48]. The microorganisms community in seed inocula enriched with mixed sugars were Clostridium sp., Thermoaerobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. According to the band intensity, Thermoaerobacterium sp. was the most abundant followed by Clostridium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. respectively (Fig. 3, lane A). Clostridium sp. is a gram-positive-low G + C contents strain that is known to produce hydrogen accompanied by butyric and acetic acids through dark fermentation [49,50]. Clostridium sp. was detected as the predominant species in both the mesophilic [17,35,40] and the thermophilic [19] hydrogen fermentation systems. In addition, Clostridium sp. had been reported to efficiently produce hydrogen from complex substrates such as palm oil mill effluent [6], hydrolysates of sugarcane bagasse [17] and OPT [11]. Thermoaerobacterium sp. is a gram-positive-low G + C contents bacteria that was reported to produce hydrogen under thermophilic (50–78 °C) conditions [9,11,43,46]. Various species of Thermoaerobacterium sp. including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, T. zeae, T. lactoethylicum and T. aotearoense have hydrogen production characteristics. They are able to produce hydrogen using mixed xylose and glucose substrate [9,11,43,46] . Lactobacillus sp. is a gram positive, facultative anaerobe and heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium (LAB) [51]. The LAB could have negative effects on hydrogen production through competition in the organic substrates with hydrogen producers [52] since heterofermentative LAB ferment 1 mol glucose to 1 mol lactic acid, 1 mol ethanol, and 1 mol of CO2 without the production of hydrogen. Moreover, Lactobacillus sp. had been reported to decrease hydrogen content in biogas production due to its inhibitory effect caused by the excreted bacteriocins that have an adverse effect on hydrogen-producing bacteria [53]. Under the optimum condition for hydrogen fermentation from OPT hydrolysate, only Clostridium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. were the predominant microorganisms. Clostridium sp. has stronger band intensity than Lactobacillus sp. (Fig. 3). Clostridium species are known hydrogen producers with butyrate type fermentation in which acetic acid and alcohols were the minor metabolites [49,50]. This result coincided with the SMPs analysis, suggesting that butyrate was the main metabolite observed during the fermentation of OPT hydrolysate followed by acetic acid and ethanol. The detection of Lactobacillus sp., lactic acid producing bacteria, at a low density population (Fig. 3) was also in agreement with the small amount of lactic acid detected in the fermented broth. Thermoaerobacterium sp. disappeared at the optimum condition (Fig. 3), suggesting that the optimum condition used in this study did not favor the growth of this species."
13,Conclusions,"The conditions of microwave-H2SO4 pretreatment of OPT and hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate by hot spring enriched culture were optimized using RSM with CCD. The maximum predicted total sugar concentration of 21.23 g/L with a low inhibitor concentration of 2.50 g/L was achieved at the of H2SO4 concentration of 1.56% (w/v) and reaction time of 7.50 min. The initial pH and initial substrate concentration had a statistically individual effect on P s while NaHCO3 concentration had no statistically individual effect on P s. At the optimum condition of 6.03 initial pH, 22.07 g/L initial substrate concentration and 6.71 g/L NaHCO3 concentration, the predicted value of P s was 1969.26 mL H2/L medium. The results of confirmation experiments at the optimum condition for microwave-H2SO4 pretreatment and hydrogen production from OPT hydrolysate indicated a close agreement of the predicted and observed responses, which suggested that the models obtained are adequate for all predictions. Results from the PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the predominant hydrogen producers at the optimum condition were Clostridium sp. A low band intensity of Lactobacillus sp. was detected on the DGGE profile, which was in agreement with the small amount of lactic acid detected."
