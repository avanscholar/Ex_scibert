0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production is the first step toward the transition to a hydrogen economy with benefits such as reduced dependence on non-renewable resources and decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hydrogen may be used in fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines to release its stored energy. Several proven technologies, such as steam reforming, autothermal reforming, partial oxidation, coal gasification and water gas shift (WGS), can be harnessed to extract hydrogen from fuels like gasoline, diesel, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), methane, ethanol and methanol [1]. At present, methane steam reforming is the main commercial route for H2 production [2]. Nevertheless, several research groups have studied alcohol reforming, more specifically methanol [3,4] and ethanol. The interest on these molecules rises from their availability and the possibility of producing them renewably from various biomass sources, including energy crops, residual materials from agro-industries or forestry, and organic/gasifiable fractions of municipal solid waste. Furthermore, alcohol reforming proceeds at temperatures typically below 600°C, which are significantly lower than those required for CH4 or gasoline reforming [5–7]. This is an important feature for the improved heat integration in vehicles equipped with fuel cells. Unlike other hydrocarbons, alcohols are also free of sulfur, which is considered as a catalyst poison in the reforming of hydrocarbons [8]. Ethanol is generally preferred to methanol since its industrial production from renewable resources is well known and well established; it is less acidic and safer than methanol to handle, transport and store [8]. It is also significantly less toxic than methanol [9]. Ethanol produced from renewable sources (i.e. biomass fermentation) [10] for the production of H2 energy is CO2 neutral [11]. The catalytic decomposition of ethanol over iron-based catalysts has already been studied. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a diameter range of 30–50nm were synthesized by ethanol vapour decomposition over ball-milled iron oxide (Fe2O3)-coated copper sheets by Singjai et al. [12]. CNTs with larger diameters of 100–300nm were also produced. These authors proposed that the stresses and cracks induced in Fe2O3 powder by ball milling can reduce the size of the catalyst particles and therefore influence the diameter of the formed CNTs. The presence of α-Fe and Fe3C phases in CNTs was proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and catalytic particles at CNT tips were observed. They suggested that Fe2O3 powder was transformed into nanosized Fe and Fe3C particles, and CNTs grew by Fe3C transformation into Fe and graphite. Zheng et al. [13] have reported on the synthesis of long CNTs from ethanol decomposition in chemical vapour deposition over iron catalysts. They also demonstrated [14] that ethanol can produce clean and long CNTs with small amounts of amorphous carbon. They investigated the influence of reaction temperature on CNT growth, employing cobalt-based catalysts supported on alumina substrates, and found that CNT growth started readily at 600°C. At temperatures below 550°C and above 650°C, the CNT growth rate was modest, with presentation of tangled structures. Wang et al. [15] adopted the chemical vapour deposition method to produce high-quality, single-walled CNT (SWCNT) by catalytic decomposition of ethanol at atmospheric pressure and over Fe–Co/MgO catalyst. The product consisted of SWCNT bundles containing small amounts of amorphous carbon. They showed that SWCNT diameter could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of ethanol solution, and the addition of water. The SWCNT production through ethanol vapour deposition over (a) Co and Mo [16–19], (b) high surface area CeO2 (CeO2 (HSA)) [20] and (c) CeO2 on the surface of Au–Rh/CeO2 [21] was also studied. Although ethanol steam reforming has been widely investigated [22–30], its dry (CO2) reforming is much less known. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a GHG, is a big concern of many hydrogen production technologies relying on renewable energy. Therefore, ethanol reforming with CO2 as oxidant is an interesting approach in converting CO2 into high value-added inert carbon (carbon nanofilaments (CNFs) and CNT), removing it from the carbon biosphere cycle. Ethanol dry reforming was only recently investigated. Tsiakaras and Demin [31] studied the thermodynamics of ethanol dry reforming, but did not perform any experimental work. De Oliveira-Vigier et al. [32] reported that iron alloy was a promising catalyst for ethanol dry reforming. They discerned that although carbon formation caused serious problems deactivating the catalyst, it could also sequester CO2 if carbon deposits could be removed from the surface of the catalyst without harming its reactivity. They tested stainless steel, a catalyst with such a surface that the carbon formed could be easily removed while the activity of the catalyst was still maintained. They proved that carbon deposits in the form of CNFs. The latter is a potentially marketable by-product which could help in offsetting the energetic cost of the process. Fe alloys are active catalysts for CO disproportionation through the Boudouard reaction. Chen and Yuen [33] have reported that stainless steel can efficiently form carbon filaments at high temperature from hydrocarbon pyrolysis. Auprêtre et al. [34] tried Fe/γ-Al2O3 and discovered that it had lower activity for ethanol steam reforming than Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3. It has been shown recently that carbon steel is an active catalyst for ethanol dry reforming and CO2 sequestration in the form of CNFs [35]. The present work examines in detail the reactions of ethanol reforming with CO2 and ethanol cracking over carbon steel catalyst. Thermodynamic calculations were made to determine the yields of products at equilibrium. These results were compared with experimental data. The effect of operating parameters, such as reaction temperature and the CO2/ethanol (CO2/EtOH from now on) ratio, on the yields of ethanol reforming and quality of the CNFs produced was investigated. The possibility of thermal cracking or thermal reforming of ethanol was examined in the same operating conditions as for catalytic ethanol reforming."
1,Methodology,"A quartz, bench-scale, fixed-bed reactor, with a diameter of 4.6cm and a length of 122cm, was used. Reactor conditions were set at 550°C and 1atm. Liquid ethanol (99.9% v/v) was pumped from a reservoir and then vaporized before entering the reactor. CO2 or Ar gases were added to the ethanol vapour upstream of the reactor. All gases were supplied by Praxair, their purity being 99.99% for both CO2 and Ar (Fig. 1 ). The carbon steel catalyst, AISI steel 1010, contained a maximum of 0.13% C, 0.3–0.6% Mn, a maximum of 0.04% P, and a maximum of 0.05% S. Sheet thickness was 0.13mm (±10%), and UPC number was 13320 (16AS). All herein-reported material content percentages are in w/w. The catalyst, consisting of carbon steel strips, was fixed on the quartz tube which also contained the central thermocouple located at the reactor centre. Exiting gas was dried in a cold trap and molecular sieve column, and then analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Model CP3800 from Varian Inc.: Hayesep Q CP81073, Hayesep Q 81069, and Hayesep T CP81072 columns and Molsieve 13X CP81071 and Molsieve 5A CP81025, with column temperatures maintained at 50°C). A Hitachi S-4700 high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) ensured both high-quality imaging and elemental CNFs analyses. Reactions were conducted in the fixed-bed, isothermal reactor at 550°C, with the above-described pre-treated carbon steel strips as catalyst. Overall Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) was based on the geometrically calculated surface area of the catalyst (the carbon steel strips are non-porous and, consequently, the internal surface is negligible). To maintain equivalent reaction conditions in the tests without catalysts, the chosen gas flow rates remained the same. The catalyst consisted of low carbon (0.1%) steel sheets thermally pre-treated at 800°C and then partially oxidized at 550°C [36]. Carbon nanostructures formed on the carbon steel catalyst surface during the reforming and cracking reactions were recovered by mechanical means and analyzed subsequently, according to SEM methods, and shown to have diameters ranging between 5nm and 200nm. The CNFs purification process was undertaken with nitric acid 70% for 4h with mechanical agitation. The CNFs were filtered and washed with deionized water over a glass fibre filter, followed by overnight drying at 100°C. Thermo-Gravimetric and Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) (SETARAM, Model SETSYS2400, 1600°C TG/DTA Module, initial and final temperatures of 20°C and 1000°C, ΔT/min=10K/min and under air) of CNFs before and after chemical treatment revealed 11.55 and 0.3mass% of the catalyst."
2,Experimental and discussion,"Ethanol dry reforming and cracking were studied in 3 steps. In the first step, thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of ethanol cracking and dry reforming reactions was performed at various CO2/EtOH ratios and at temperatures ranging from 250°C to 850°C. ΔG calculation served to decide upon the feasibility of the reactions. The effect of CO2/EtOH ratio and temperature on product yields was investigated in the same temperature range. In the second step, thermodynamic calculations at equilibrium were compared with the experimental results for 3 temperatures and 2 CO2/EtOH ratios for ethanol dry reforming reactions. In the third step, ethanol thermal cracking and thermal dry reforming were performed under the same operating conditions. The results of this step were compared to the catalytic cracking and catalytic dry reforming data, and the low extent of ethanol thermal cracking and dry reforming was proved under these conditions."
3,Thermodynamic analysis of ethanol cracking and dry reforming,"3.1 Thermodynamic analysis of ethanol cracking and dry reforming Delta Gibbs free energy ΔG for the global ethanol dry reforming reaction (CH3CH2OH+CO2 ⇔2H2 +2CO+C+H2O) at equilibrium, was calculated in a temperature range between 250°C and 850°C, with FactSage software. These calculations were repeated for CO2/EtOH molar ratios of 0, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1, and 3/1 (Fig. 2 ). At temperatures below 250°C, ΔG was very small and, therefore, the reforming reaction rate was prohibitively low. Increased ΔG with temperature illustrated that equilibrium was attained faster at higher temperatures. It can also be seen that ΔG was increased at a higher CO2/EtOH ratio and, therefore, conversion was favoured at higher CO2/EtOH ratios. H2, CH4, CO, CO2 and carbon yields were calculated at equilibrium for different CO2/EtOH ratios. It was theoretically found that H2 yield increased at high temperatures (Fig. 3 ). Carbon yield at equilibrium is presented in Fig. 4 . For oxidant/EtOH molar ratios of 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1, carbon formation was thermodynamically unfavourable at temperatures above 900, 750°C and 700°C, respectively. This conclusion is in agreement with the observations of Tsiakaras and Demin [31], who studied Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) being fed with the thermodynamic equilibrium products of ethanol reforming with CO2. Equilibrium calculations were performed in the temperature range between 800K and 1200K (528–927°C), and the regions where carbon formation was thermodynamically unfavourable were determined, assuming different oxidant/EtOH ratios of the initial system. It was shown that the oxidant/EtOH molar ratio, at which carbon formation in the equilibrium mixture was thermodynamically impossible, was greater than 4 for temperatures below 500°C. Methane selectivity in equilibrium conditions decreased with increasing temperature. This theoretical observation was also proved by experimental data from Sun et al. [37], showing that the reason for the lower selectivity of methane at higher temperatures was that the rates of steam and CO2 reforming of methane became significant at higher temperatures. Higher rates of methane dry reforming resulted in decreased CO2 yield for temperatures above 650°C, in agreement with CO2 yields calculated at equilibrium for this temperature range. According to these theoretical calculations, the highest CO2 yield was expected at about 550°C. This can be explained by the fact that the Boudouard reaction toward the production of carbon and CO2 was favoured in the temperature range of 500–550°C. CO yield increased significantly at temperatures above 600°C. This is mainly due to the fact that the Boudouard reaction plays a role more important than the WGS on the CO production because water is present in the reaction at much smaller quantities than CO2. This is easy to validate from the results presented in all tables. For example, from column 1 of Table 3 (reporting in a catalytic dry reforming test) it can be calculated that the H2O flow rate at the exit stream is 36ml/min; this is approximately 40% of the CO2 and 20% of the CO. In summary, at the exit (real case not at chemical equilibrium conditions) the observed molar ratios were: C/CO/CO2/H2O=4.7/8.0/4.3/1.6."
4,Equilibrium analysis and experimental results of ethanol dry reforming,"3.2 Equilibrium analysis and experimental results of ethanol dry reforming 3.2.1 Effect of temperature on the yield of ethanol reforming H2, CO2, CO, C, CH4, and H2O yields were calculated at equilibrium for a CO2/EtOH ratio of 1 and a temperature range of 250–850°C. The effect of reaction temperature on the yield of ethanol reforming at equilibrium is illustrated in Fig. 5 . It was observed that for temperatures above 550°C, H2 and CO volumes increased, while methane volume decreased. Up to 550°C, the quantity of carbon deposit declined slightly with rising temperature, but above 550°C, it was reduced much faster, and at about 850°C, carbon deposition was thermodynamically impossible. Consequently, since the objective was to find conditions which favour high hydrogen and CNFs yields as valuable products of reforming reactions, temperatures above 650°C were not of interest in our study. Although H2 production at such high temperatures is favoured, mainly due to the exothermicity of the WGS, the decline in CNFs production is even more important. Temperatures below 500°C were not chosen because of low hydrogen yield. Following this analysis, 3 temperatures were selected for investigation in experimental settings of 500°C, 550°C and 600°C. The experimental conditions of the reactions as well as the experimental results are summarized in Table 1 . At the beginning of the ethanol reforming experiment at 600°C, higher CO2 conversion was observed in comparison with the next 90min of the experiment (Fig. 6 ). Ethanol and CO2 conversions were 99% and 21%, respectively (Table 1). After 30min from the beginning of the reaction, the volumes of the produced gases were constant. These observations can be explained as follows. The high CO2 conversion and the high rate of carbon production during the first 30min can be related to the high rate of reforming reaction on the steel surface due to its high activity at the beginning of the reaction. However, after a certain time from the beginning of the reaction, e.g. 30min, large amounts of carbon were deposited on the catalyst. As described by Jankhah et al. [38], this carbon was also an active catalyst for ethanol reforming but with slightly lower activity than carbon steel itself. Therefore, CO2 and ethanol could be converted on the carbon deposit on the catalyst surface. The carbon deposit was analyzed by SEM, and was in the form of CNFs (Fig. 7 ). In the experiment on ethanol catalytic reforming at 500°C, ethanol and CO2 conversions were 96.4% and −6%, respectively (Table 1). This negative conversion means that CO2 conversion was slightly lower than its production. The carbon deposit analyzed by SEM proved to be also in the form of CNFs (Fig. 8 ). Comparing the results of ethanol dry reforming at 3 temperatures, as presented in Table 1, it was found that the highest H2 and CNFs yields and the highest CO2 conversion were obtained at 550°C. Moreover, CNFs with the smallest diameters (10nm) were observed at 550°C (Fig. 9 ). The calculated yields of H2, CO2, CO, C, CH4, and H2O at equilibrium were compared to the experimental results obtained for the CO2/EtOH ratio of 1/1 and for the 3 temperatures, 500°C, 550°C and 600°C (Figs. 10 and 11 ). It can be seen that the experimental results at 600°C are closer to equilibrium calculations than at the other 2 temperatures. As illustrated in Fig. 10, the experimental yields did not follow the equilibrium yields' trend. Maximum experimental H2 yields were observed at 550°C; meanwhile, the experimental H2 yield was always higher than its yield at equilibrium because of carbon sequestration which shifts the equilibrium reaction. Fig. 11 compares carbon yield for the CO2/EtOH ratio of 1 and for the 3 temperatures of 500°C, 550°C and 600°C. For 550°C and 600°C, the CO experimental yield was higher than its equilibrium yield; CO2 and C experimental yields were less than their yields at equilibrium. Comparing the calculated yields with the yields obtained experimentally proves that the reaction was not at equilibrium. Thus, the Boudouard reaction, not being at equilibrium at this temperature, gives more CO than at equilibrium, basically coming from methane dry reforming whose rate is higher at higher temperatures because of its endothermicity. Consequently, higher yields of CO and H2 and lower yields of C and CO2 are obtained. However, at 500°C, the Boudouard reaction rate being higher, higher CO2 yields are observed at this temperature. 3.2.2 The effect of CO2/EtOH ratio on ethanol reforming yields To investigate the effect of CO2/EtOH molar ratio, the ethanol dry reforming reaction at CO2/EtOH molar ratios of 1/1 and 1/3 was studied at 550°C. The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 2 . The results obtained experimentally and the yields of H2, CO2, CO, C, CH4, and H2O calculated at equilibrium at 550°C and at CO2/EtOH molar ratios of 1/1 and 1/3 are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 . Fig. 12 shows that both CO2/EtOH ratios resulted in similar H2 yields. Although the CO2/EtOH molar ratio of 1/3 had a higher H2 yield potential (about 15% higher), Fig. 13 reports that higher CO2 and CH4 yields were expected and obtained. Theoretically, it would be preferable to choose a CO2/EtOH molar ratio of 1/1 to minimize CO2 and CH4 yields, but at this ratio, a much lower yield of carbon is expected. However, since only a very small fraction of the carbon formed at the catalyst surface can be considered as a species participating in the reaction or, alternatively, that the reaction activity of carbon, once formed, is very low, it can be concluded that low GHSVs can lead to near 100% completion of the Boudouard reaction. The latter is highly undesirable because it would be equivalent to the pyrolytic production of carbon from EtOH and a final CO2 conversion equal to 0! Consequently, CO2 conversion is thermodynamically limited; 100% CO2 conversion to C would only be possible if CO is removed from the reaction environment directly upon its formation. Table 2 compares the results of 2 experiments with CO2/EtOH molar ratios of 1/1 and 1/3. At the CO2/EtOH molar ratio of 1/1, ethanol was completely converted, while its conversion was 93% at the CO2/EtOH molar ratio of 1/3. A higher ratio of “moles of CO2 converted/moles of ethanol converted” was also observed at the CO2/EtOH molar ratio of 1/1 (0.3 compared to 0.1); this means a higher rate of consumption for CO2 and, consequently, a higher capacity for CO2 sequestration."
5,Ethanol thermal cracking and thermal dry reforming,"3.3 Ethanol thermal cracking and thermal dry reforming Experiments in the absence of catalyst were designed to investigate yields of ethanol thermal cracking and dry reforming under the same temperature and GHSV conditions. The results obtained were compared to ethanol catalytic cracking and dry reforming to distinguish between thermal and catalytic reforming and cracking reactions (Table 3 ). In these experiments, a catalytically inert material (glass wool) was placed in the middle of the reactor, supported on the central quartz tube containing the thermocouple. This provided inert support for the deposition of carbon which might be produced by thermal cracking and/or reforming reactions. A 44% conversion of ethanol was observed in the thermal reforming experiment. However, as seen in Table 3, H2 and CO yields were much lower than those obtained in catalytic reforming reactions under the same experimental conditions. In addition, no carbon deposit was formed on the glass wool support. In the thermal cracking experiment under the same operating conditions, ethanol and CO2 conversions were 46% and −11%, respectively. Ethanol catalytic cracking was performed under the same operating conditions as in the experiment on catalytic dry reforming of ethanol, replacing CO2 by pure Ar at the same flow rate to maintain the same GHSV in the reactor as in the experiment on ethanol dry reforming. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 3. It was found that ethanol cracking at 550°C in the presence of carbon steel was almost complete (conversion of 96%). As observed in Table 3, in ethanol thermal cracking reactions, ethanol conversion and H2 and CO yields were significantly lower than in the catalytic cracking experiment. The experimental results on catalytic ethanol cracking were compared to the equilibrium calculations and also to thermal reforming reaction. It was found that H2 yields produced during ethanol cracking were higher than in the reforming reaction, but lower yields of CO and CH4 gases were obtained. Carbon deposit was formed on the catalyst; SEM analyses (Fig. 14 ) showed that this carbon was in the form of nanofilaments."
6,Structure of the CNFs,"3.4 Structure of the CNFs TEM analyses of the filamentous carbon produced over the used catalyst are shown in Fig. 15 a–d. They reveal four interesting features: The filamentous carbon is mainly in the forms of CNFs. From Fig. 15a it can be clearly observed that the graphite sheets are not concentric to the internal empty tube but rather oblique to the tube axis. The expected presence of iron containing grains [38] inside the carbon nanofilaments (CNFs) was confirmed (Fig. 15b). The filamentous carbon is in the form of both rectilinear (Fig. 15b) and helicoidally arranged CNFs (Fig. 15b and c). In some cases there is more than one grain inside each CNFs (Fig. 15d). In some cases there are more than one CNF associated with one grain. Fig. 15d shows four star-linked CNFs, all departing from the same grain. The above information is actually under study in elucidating the mechanism of the reactions producing CNFs. Based on equilibrium calculations (Figs. 3 and 4), higher H2, CH4 and C yields for ethanol cracking at 550°C were expected compared to ethanol reforming. This was in full agreement with the reported experimental results. However, the experimental H2 yields were higher and the carbon yields were lower than at equilibrium, for both ethanol reforming and ethanol cracking."
7,Conclusion,"We undertook thermodynamic equilibrium analyses of ethanol catalytic reforming with CO2, a technique to produce hydrogen gas and to sequester the GHG CO2 in the form of carbon deposits. The effect of temperature and CO2/EtOH molar ratio on ΔG and yields of ethanol reforming and cracking was studied. It was found experimentally that a CO2/EtOH ratio of 1 favours hydrogen and CNFs production during ethanol catalytic reforming. The results of reforming reactions at 3 temperatures of 500°C, 550°C and 600°C were compared as well as with the theoretical thermodynamic calculations at equilibrium. H2 and CO yields were higher in all experiments than predicted theoretically, while the opposite was observed for carbon. As expected from the theoretical calculations (Fig. 8), the highest rate of carbon production occurred at 550°C. The highest conversions of ethanol and, more significantly, of CO2 as well as the highest H2 yield were obtained at 550°C. However, comparison of the yields obtained experimentally at 500°C, 550°C and 600°C with the calculated equilibrium yields shows that the results of reforming at 600°C were the closest to equilibrium. This was due to the higher reaction rates at 600°C. At the operating conditions tested, it was noted that ethanol thermal reforming and thermal cracking rates were low, and no carbon deposit was formed in the absence of carbon steel. However, ethanol catalytic cracking occurred. Consequently, in the experiments with both CO2 and ethanol as reactive gases and in the presence of carbon steel, the cracking and reforming reactions took place simultaneously. Previous literature provides a first insight on the mechanism of the CNFs formation iron-catalyzed reactions [38] but the actual work reveals the complexity of the latter. Although, it is now well established that CNFs are built around catalytic grains and that the CNFs diameter depends on their size, it is not well understood (a) how these grains are formed; (b) which mechanism decides for their size; (c) why one CNF can contain more than one grain or (d) how more than one CNFs can be formed on a catalytic grain. Finally, it is not yet clear whether there is dry reforming activity from the beginning of the reaction or whether cracking activity is followed by the Boudouard reaction. In other words, we do not know if CO2 adsorbs significantly on the studied steel surface to initiate reforming reactions. Ongoing research is focused on clarifying this mechanism."
