0,Introduction,"Utilizing cyanobacteria and algae as cell factories for the efficient photocatalytic conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy is a biotechnological challenge that is believed to be an achievable goal by some for production of renewable and clean fuel [1]. Selected strains of cyanobacteria possessing either nitrogenase or the bidirectional class of hydrogenases are potentially capable of evolving hydrogen. However, because of low in vivo activity of the enzymes and poisoning by oxygen, screening of candidate microorganisms for hydrogen production has proven difficult. Therefore, providing the physiological conditions necessary for optimal maturation of these enzymes and optimal activity of the functionally assembled enzyme is a prerequisite for successful screening. Every hydrogenase found in cyanobacteria to date binds one iron atom and one nickel atom at its active site, and typically additional Fe atoms associated with integral iron–sulfur clusters. These so-called NiFe-hydrogenases are classified into multiple groups [2] of which only one, the NAD(P)H-dependent bidirectional hydrogenases, can evolve hydrogen using electrons from either NADPH or NADH. The membrane-bound type of NiFe-hydrogenase that is found in cyanobacteria serves exclusively for H 2 uptake (e.g., is physiologically unidirectional). Nearly all nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have an uptake hydrogenase that allows for recovery of electrons lost to hydrogen evolution via nitrogenase, with only a few counterexamples: the unicellular Synechococcus sp. BG 043511 [3] and perhaps strains of unicellular thermophilic cyanobacteria in certain hot spring microbial mats [4] having recently been reported. Some level of nickel availability is therefore essential for hydrogenase activity in cyanobacteria. However, many reports of hydrogen evolution in cyanobacteria have not used nickel as a medium component [5–9]; the very frequently used BG-11 (or Allen's) medium is free of added nickel salts [10]. Contaminant levels of nickel are present in sufficient quantities to allow hydrogenase activity in these reports. The importance of nickel concentration for hydrogen production can be easily overlooked in cyanobacteria since the photoautotrophic growth rate is slowed by nickel or prevented altogether depending upon concentration [11,12]. Under nitrogen-fixing conditions (anaerobic, lacking soluble nitrogen donor), nickel supplementation has been shown to aid in growth of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria possessing membrane-bound uptake hydrogenases, such as Nostoc muscorum [13] and Anabaena cylindrica [14]. In contrast, under conditions in which nitrate or ammonium is present in the medium, the hydrogenases are superfluous to photoautotrophic growth and Ni addition fails to improve the growth rate or cell density. Similarly, only a minor decrease in growth rate and maximum cell density is observed in a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant lacking the bidirectional hydrogenase versus the wild type [8]. Genetic and phenotypic differences have also been described for different wild-type strains of the nondiazotrophic unicellular Synechocystis, including a substrain that has a severely reduced hydrogenase activity that can be partly activated by the addition of excess nickel to the medium [15]. Nickel supplementation in the growth medium has also been reported to be necessary for full activity of urease, a metalloenzyme containing two nickel atoms at its active site, for the filamentous cyanobacterium A. cylindrica [16] as well as the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 [17]. Herein we show that addition of adequate nickel concentration to the growth medium plays a dominant role in the capacity for H 2 production by the filamentous nondiazotrophic cyanobacterium Arthrospira maxima. This organism possesses a bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase (hox gene cluster) [18] that produces H 2 in the dark, but apparently no nitrogenase (nif gene cluster) nor any uptake class of hydrogenase (hup gene cluster) (unpublished data). As a result of this simplicity, A. maxima is a good candidate for mechanistic studies of H 2 metabolism by the bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase. A. maxima is a filamentous nonheterocystous nondiazotrophic cyanobacterium isolated from alkaline soda lakes in East Africa. Arthrospira species are vigorous photoautotrophs that are noted for their high primary productivity in biomass accumulation [19]. Arthrospira species thrive in alkaline carbonate medium at high ionic strengths (up to 1M NaCl) and can tolerate high light fluxes ( 1400 μ E m - 2 s - 1 ) [20]. In our hands, A. maxima grows to high cell densities (up to 3.0 g dry weight L culture - 1 ). It also has the fastest turnover of its Photosystem II/water-oxidizing complex observed in vivo which is up to five times faster than algae and higher plant PSII enzymes [21]. Arthrospira species were reported to produce low levels of hydrogen under dark anaerobic conditions, including Arthrospira platensis [22,23]. Nevertheless, A. maxima and A. platensis are typically grown with little or no added nickel in their growth medium [24–26]. Because the concentration of nickel that is necessary to achieve maximum rates of H 2 production is deleterious to photoautotrophic growth, the upper limit of hydrogenase activity has generally not been explored previously in Arthrospira species [23] nor many other cyanobacteria. We report the nickel requirement for the optimal rate and yield of hydrogenase-dependent H 2 production by intact cells (so-called in vivo H 2 ). We show these are limited by the intracellular reductant capacity (NAD(P)H), in contrast to broken cells (so-called in vitro H 2 ) which allows the maximum possible rate to be measured. We use three independent methods for measuring H 2 : (1) conventional gas chromatography (GC) detection of headspace H 2 gas produced in sealed glass vials, (2) a novel microvolume bioreactor containing an integrated electrochemical cell for rapid anaerobic induction which measures dissolved H 2 in solution, and (3) the widely used methyl viologen assay for measuring maximum rates of hydrogenase-dependent H 2 production in cell-free extracts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cell culturing,"2.1 Cell culturing The filamentous cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima (CS-328) was obtained from the Tasmanian CSIRO Collection of Living Microalgae. It was found to have a bacterial contaminant which was removed by sterile filtration. Arthrospira was grown in Zarrouk's medium as described elsewhere [26] with the following modifications: 6.5 g L - 1 NaHCO 3 and 7.0 g L - 1 Na 2 CO 3 instead of 18.0 g L - 1 NaHCO 3 and omission of standard 0.17 μ M NiSO 4 . A full description of our medium is included in Supplemental Material. Cells were grown in 500mL batches in 1L wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flasks under 12h light–dark cycles with a light flux of 40 μ E m - 2 s - 1 and supplemented with NiCl 2 at final concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 μ M . Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of cultures were monitored by extracting chlorophyll from cells concentrated from 500 μ L aliquots and added to N,N-dimethylformamide, which was then centrifuged and immediately placed in a spectrophotometer for absorbance measurements at 652 and 720nm based on the Arnon method [27,28]. For demonstrating the deleterious effect of nickel supplementation on growth at high light, cells were grown for 3 days with 0.17, 1.7, 3.4, and 5.0 μ M Ni 2 + in 1L Roux flasks with stirring at a light flux of approximately 100 μ E m - 2 s - 1 . The source of illumination was always cool white fluorescent lamps. Methyl viologen assays were performed under conditions similar to those described elsewhere [29]. Cells were harvested from batch cultures in early stationary phase (cell density ∼ 35 mg chlorophyll a or ∼ 1.5 g dry weight L culture - 1 ), and lysed anaerobically with glass beads in 50mM MES buffer, pH 6.8 with 3mM MgCl 2 . To this, final concentrations of the following were added: 6mM methyl viologen, 9mM sodium dithionite, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Gas phase hydrogen was sampled from these 3.5mL suspensions in 10.0mL sealed glass vials by GC."
3,Dissolved hydrogen rate electrode measurements,2.2 Dissolved hydrogen rate electrode measurements A home-built Clark-type electrode with a 4mm Pt/Ir cathode poised at + 420 mV and covered with an ultra-thin gas-permeable membrane was used to monitor hydrogen evolution rates from 5 μ L cell suspensions. This electrode has a time resolution of 100ms and sensitivity of 2nM H 2 and was described previously [30]. Aliquots of cultures (with or without added glucose) were placed directly over the entire surface of the electrode and sealed with a glass disk and covered for darkness. Cells were sometimes concentrated to higher cell densities by centrifugation before placing on electrode to enhance the hydrogen signal and respiration rates.
4,Gas-phase H2 measurements by GC,2.3 Gas-phase H2 measurements by GC An amount of 10mL aliquots of cultures were placed in 26mL glass vials with glucose (20mM final concentration) and sealed with Teflon-coated rubber septa. The headspace was purged with argon and vials were placed in the dark. Hydrogen was monitored by withdrawing 200 μ L headspace samples with a gastight syringe (Hamilton) and injecting in a calibrated gas chromatograph (Gow-Mac) equipped with a 13X molecular sieve column and argon carrier gas.
5,Results,"The low nickel concentration used for standard growth of Arthrospira species is likely due to optimization of growth under natural light flux. It was reported that nickel is not beneficial for growth of A. platensis grown in a bioreactor at light fluxes ranging from 88 to 122 W m - 2 ( ∼ 400 – 600 μ E m - 2 s - 1 ) [25]. We find that growing A. maxima at 100 μ E m - 2 s - 1 in Roux flasks with a short optical path length are unfavorable conditions for nickel supplementation. Fig. 1 A shows cultures grown for 3 days with 0.17, 1.7, 3.4, and 5.0 μ M Ni 2 + clearly demonstrating a lack of cell growth that was concomitant with loss of chlorophyll (and yellowing of cells) with increasing nickel concentration. However, growing cultures in Erlenmeyer flasks under lower light flux ( ∼ 40 μ E m - 2 s - 1 ) allowed for nickel supplementation. Cultures containing up to 1 μ M added NiCl 2 grow at indistinguishable rates (measured spectrophotometrically as extractable Chl a) under low light flux as shown by the growth curve in Fig. 1B. A slight, but significant delay in the initial growth rate is observed with 4 μ M NiCl 2 , but cultures recover after about 12 days to cell densities equal to those of cultures with less nickel. This delayed growth coincides with yellowing of the suspension due to bleaching of chlorophyll as with cultures supplemented with nickel and grown at higher light flux. Cells grown in higher light intensity with high nickel concentrations also recover after 1–2 weeks as cell densities return, but this process is much slower than with low light, and in general higher light and higher nickel concentrations do kill cells in culture. It is of interest to note that while cultures shown in Fig. 1A were grown in continuous high light, the same antagonistic effect of nickel is observed for cells grown on a 12/12 light/dark cycle with high lightillumination. While nickel is clearly an antagonist for photoautotrophic growth at high light flux, supplementing cultures with NiCl 2 during growth under low light increases their capacity to produce hydrogen following anaerobic induction in darkness, as determined by the standard in vitro methyl viologen assay (Fig. 2 ). Cells assayed for hydrogenase activity after 25 days of photoautotrophic growth show that nickel supplemented cultures evolve hydrogen at initial rates 18-fold higher than unsupplemented cultures (Fig. 2 inset). The observed decrease in hydrogen evolution rate over a few hours is due to degradation of hydrogenase under the assay conditions. Further addition of substrate at these time points does not recover initial evolution rates. Nickel supplementation also increases hydrogen evolution rates from cells in vivo. Cyanobacteria produce hydrogen via hydrogenase as a product of fermentation, requiring anaerobic conditions. We measured hydrogen evolution from live cells in two different ways: (1) electrochemically by means of a membrane-covered electrode (Clark-type) that continually consumes hydrogen and gives a current signal proportional to hydrogen evolution rate (herein referred to as the “rate electrode”), and (2) by GC measuring hydrogen amount evolved into the headspace of cell suspensions in sealed glass vials. In both cases, we relied on the native cellular respiration to consume O 2 thereby achieving anaerobisis of the culture sufficient for induction of hydrogen production. This strategy is more effective when using the microvolume bioreactor sampled by the large surface area rate electrode as it possesses a total sample volume of only 5 μ L and has no gaseous headspace volume. We have measured the rate of uptake of residual dissolved oxygen by respiration within the aqueous cell suspensions under H 2 oxidizing conditions occurs within approximately 2min. In contrast, trace oxygen in the headspace of the 26mL sealed glass vials must also be consumed when using GC detection and this requires more time, likely of the order of hours, and is prone to leaks. This difference in method of detecting hydrogen influences the ability to resolve the effect of nickel supplementation on hydrogen evolution rates from fermenting cells. Cells grown with increasing concentrations of added nickel show a clear increase in fermentative H 2 evolution of endogenous substrates (predominantly photosynthetically derived glycogen) on the rate electrode (Fig. 3 ). Here the integrated hydrogen yield is 3.6 times higher from cells grown in 3 μ M Ni than with cells containing only contaminating nickel (19nM see below). The major rise in hydrogen evolution rate occurs earlier with increasing nickel concentrations. At 3 μ M added Ni, high hydrogen evolution begins after 10h dark anaerobisis; the major rise for 0.17 μ M Ni and no added Ni is after 15 and 20h dark anaerobisis, respectively. An earlier minor rise in hydrogen evolution rate is seen as early as 6h after dark anaerobisis for cultures grown with no added Ni. While a trend for higher hydrogen yields was observed in some trials using the sealed vials and GC detection, the presence of trace oxygen precluded reliable reproducibility of this smaller effect for cells fermenting only endogenous substrates. Hydrogen evolution rates are significantly lower in the absence of added glucose, sometimes with no detectable hydrogen in the headspace of cultures in sealed glass vials for young cells. For this reason, we examined media supplemented with a fermentable substrate following anaerobic induction. Adding 20mM glucose to serve as fermentable substrate at the start of anaerobic induction further increases the rate of hydrogen evolved and this rate increases with Ni concentration (Fig. 4 ). This result is observed for both headspace H 2 measured by GC using sealed glass vials where H 2 is allowed to accumulate, and for dissolved H 2 in cell suspensions measured with the microreactor/rate electrode where H 2 is not allowed to accumulate owing to consumption. Fig. 4A illustrates a 3-fold increase in H 2 evolved to the headspace in the bulk vial reactors after 4h of dark anaerobisis for cultures grown with 1 μ M added NiCl 2 versus without nickel. This difference in H 2 yield continues to be seen after 15h of dark anaerobisis, with an increase in evolution rate (slope) observed in all samples after the first 4h of dark anaerobisis. This slope increase after 4h in the bulk vial reactors is likely due to further removal of oxygen (via respiration), which in the first few hours of darkness is limiting hydrogenase activity and competing for catabolic electrons. It should be noted that for these particular samples, respiratory and fermentative rates were sufficiently slow in the absence of glucose that no appreciable hydrogen was evolved to the headspace for any of these samples in sealed glass vials in the absence of glucose. Using the microreactor/rate electrode (Fig. 4B), the glucose-supplemented H 2 evolution rate begins within minutes after darkness, achieves 50% of the maximum rate in 15min and nearly saturates after 1h. The inset to Fig. 4B shows the ratio of H 2 evolution rates from cells grown with 1 μ M NiCl 2 versus without added nickel. The ratio increases rapidly to a peak value that is 21-fold higher in the first half-hour of darkness, followed by a rapid decrease to a ratio of about 6 after 1h, and continues to decrease slowly at a constant rate over the next 12h as the fermentable substrates are consumed. The intercept of this line with the time zero axis is 6.2 which is the ratio of initial steady-state rates of H 2 production. The average integrated yield of H 2 after 12h darkness is 2.6-fold greater in the sample supplemented with 1 μ M NiCl 2 versus without added nickel. The samples for measurements in Figs. 3 and 4B, respectively, were from cultures of different ages and measured at different cell densities. Therefore, while magnitudes of relative hydrogen evolution rates can be compared within a figure, they cannot be compared between figures. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, cells without any supplemental NiCl 2 evolved some hydrogen. This activity can be explained by the presence of contaminant levels of nickel due to impure medium components. The complete medium unsupplemented by nickel was determined to contain 19nM Ni by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Huffman Laboratories, Golden, CO). Attempts to remove this low level of contaminant nickel from the medium by treating solutions of medium components with Chex-100 resin and using 99.99% pure zinc, cobalt, and iron only lowered the contaminant nickel level marginally (to 15nM)."
6,Discussion,"Because the addition of nickel stimulates hydrogenase activity measured from broken cells (in vitro) to a much greater degree than for intact filaments (in vivo), it is inferred that in vivo hydrogen evolution is largely limited by availability of intracellular reduction equivalents (in the form of NAD(P)H) rather than hydrogenase availability for cells in growth medium. We are able to reliably resolve differences in hydrogen evolution rates from cultures fermenting endogenous substrates that are grown in varying added nickel concentrations using the rate electrode, but not in headspaces above cell suspensions owing to the lower sensitivity of the instrumentation and slower response. A representative example of the hydrogen evolution rate profiles measured on the rate electrode from cells grown with 3.0, 0.17, and no added nickel showed that the onset of largest hydrogen evolution rates occurs earlier and that after 24h, integral hydrogen evolution is higher with increasing nickel. We expect that higher hydrogenase activities in cells allow for hydrogen production earlier and in greater amount, but we cannot rule out the possibility that metabolic fluxes are also different between samples. For example, catabolism of pigments and their protein complexes, which occurs as a result of the initial shock to high nickel, produces a larger pool of NADH that may not have fully cleared even though cell growth has recovered (Fig. 1). Additionally, we do not have data to explain why cells that were not supplemented with nickel show an earlier minor rise in hydrogen evolution rate (after 6h dark anaerobisis) than cells grown with 3.0 or 0.17 μ M Ni. A clear difference in hydrogen rates and yields is more easily observed from cells grown in different nickel concentrations when they are fermented in the presence of an external substrate (20mM glucose). A difference is observed in the headspace above cell suspensions and on the rate electrode as shown in Figs. 4A and B, respectively. While cells from this experiment grown at all nickel concentrations made only trace amounts of hydrogen after 16h dark anaerobisis in the absence of glucose (data not shown), significant hydrogen was produced from these cells that increases with the amount of nickel added to the culture during growth when fermented in the presence of 20mM glucose. The rate electrode allows resolution of the immediate rise in hydrogen production which is both faster and to a higher intensity from cells grown with 1.0 μ M added nickel relative to unsupplemented cultures. We do not have metabolic data to allow us to speculate on why there is an approximate 1h delay in the rise of the hydrogen evolution rate for the unsupplemented cells. Our measurements show that the limitation of nickel can be significant for hydrogen evolution from whole cells of A. maxima. Hydrogenase and hydrogen metabolism studies of cyanobacteria that have reported nickel supplementation often list Ni 2 + addition at similar concentrations, ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 μ M [13,15,31,32]. Our results show that both the in vitro (Fig. 2) and the in vivo (Fig. 4) stimulation of hydrogen evolution by added NiCl 2 produces 50% of the maximum stimulation at about 0.2 μ M and saturates when cells are grown at about 1 μ M in A. maxima at low light intensity ( ∼ 40 μ E m - 2 s - 1 ) which is well below mean daytime solar flux in equatorial Africa where A. maxima originates. This nickel concentration is comparable to the saturating concentration of supplemental NiSO 4 needed for maximal urease-dependent phycobiliprotein biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 reported by Sakamoto and Bryant [17]. Curiously, these authors found that cyanobacteria strains Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 do not require nickel supplementation for optimal urease activity and proposed that the strain-dependent requirement for added nickel was likely contingent upon the absence of high-affinity nickel-ion transporters that enable cells to bring nickel ions across their plasma membrane in media containing only trace levels of nickel. This would certainly explain why studies of some cyanobacterial strains grown without added nickel reported hydrogenase activity. This includes for example important mechanistic studies of the hydrogenase in cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [8,9]. However, most often literature reports of hydrogen evolution rates from cyanobacteria grown in the absence of added nickel have not investigated the nickel requirement for hydrogenase activity and are therefore potentially underestimated, due to low and variable levels of nickel and possible absence of high-affinity nickel-ion transporters. This complicates attempts to use published rates in search of potential high hydrogen producing species. Screening efforts for high hydrogen producing cyanobacteria are especially prone to this complication if cells are grown in medium recommended for optimal photoautotrophic growth rather than for optimal hydrogenase activity, as has been the case for previous screens [5,6]. We recommend that future screens for high hydrogen producing cyanobacteria supplement growth media with 1 μ M nickel and avoid possible antagonistic effects by growing cells at low light fluxes. Though minimal concentrations of nickel for toxic effects are reported to vary strongly among strains of cyanobacteria, our experience with several strains lead us to believe that 1 μ M is generally a tolerable concentration of nickel that does not appear to significantly decrease cell viability for cells grown at or below 50 μ E m - 2 s - 1 . This is consistent with nickel toxicity reports of cyanobacteria that list 2 μ M or higher at the lower end of nickel concentrations that decrease culture cell densities [11,12]. An obvious alternative approach to avoiding the antagonistic effects of nickel on growth, while gaining the benefits of higher hydrogenase activity, is to add nickel at a later stage in growth after cultures have reached higher cell densities. We have grown cells to high densities using our standard light intensity in a medium with no added nickel and then supplemented nickel at the time of anaerobisis and did not observe an increase in hydrogen production (data not shown). However, we have not fully explored this approach at higher light intensities where nickel has a stronger deleterious effect. A closer investigation into the best times for nickel addition to cultures grown in high light might aid in an understanding of how to gain higher hydrogen activities from cultures by nickel addition without inducing severe chlorophyll degradation. Light-dependent nickel toxicity leading to loss of chlorophyll a has been reported for cyanobacteria such as A. platensis (formerly Spirulina platensis) and a Synechococcus strain (formerly Anacystis nidulans) by Azeez and Banerjee [12]. These authors speculated that metal binding to sulphydryl-like groups in chlorophyll a biosynthetic enzymes, which are activated in the presence of light, could explain this observation. Additionally, we speculate that the intracellular Ni 2 + level may be sufficient to displace Mg 2 + from chlorophyll which is a main binding site for attachment to the reaction center and inner antenna protein complexes via histidine and other amino acid side chains. The source of the Ni stimulation effect on fermentative H 2 evolution could have two likely possibilities. It may be attributable to an increased activity of a fixed population of incompletely assembled [NiFe]-hydrogenase due to insertion of Ni into the active site. Alternatively, nickel supplementation may increase the expression of the hox structural and/or maturation genes, giving rise to increased levels of hydrogenase subunits. Future experiments that measure transcript and protein levels of hydrogenase upon addition of nickel would help distinguish these two possibilities. Addition of nickel has been shown to stimulate transcription for the large structural subunit of the bidirectional hydrogenase (hoxH) in the filamentous cyanobacterium N. muscorum and the uptake hydrogenases (hupL) in N. muscorum and Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 [31] as well as the uptake hydrogenase in the rhizobium Bradyrhizobium japonicum [33]. This stimulation was observed at nickel concentrations similar to those reported here (0.5 and 0.25 – 1.0 μ M for the Nostoc strains and B. japonicum, respectively). However, our preliminary data show that supplementation of nickel does not result in a measurable change in either in vivo or in vitro hydrogenase activity for both Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (data not shown). Likewise, transcript levels of hox structural genes encoding the bidirectional hydrogenase in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 have been monitored by RT-PCR and appear to decrease, rather than increase, with addition of 5 μ M nickel (Y. Xu and D.A. Byrant, unpublished data). This difference in the hox transcriptional response to nickel addition between cyanobacterial species illustrates the difficulty in resolving a universal role of bidirectional hydrogenases in cyanobacteria because different species seem to regulate bidirectional hydrogenases differently. For example, the physiological function of this enzyme is thought to be primarily for providing protons as an alternative electron acceptor in order to vent excess reducing equivalents under anoxic conditions for A. maxima in our laboratory and for many cyanobacteria such as Cyanothece sp. PCC 7822 [34] and perhaps N. muscorum where induction of anaerobic conditions increases transcription of hoxH [31]. However, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, activity of the bidirectional hydrogenase correlates with high photosynthetic and low respiratory activity [8]. Strain-dependent differences in availability and affinities of nickel-ion transporters may also affect a cell's requirement for nickel supplementation in order to achieve higher hydrogenase activity. Two high-affinity transport systems specific for nickel in prokaryotes have been genetically characterized: ABC-type transporters first studied in Escherichia coli (NikABCDE) [35] and nickel-specific permeases such as HoxN in Cupriavidus necator (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus or Ralstonia eutrophus) [36]. ABC-type transporters are thought to have diverged considerably in comparison to the E. coli Nik system, and intricate spatial interactions between two transmembrane domains of HoxN are highly important for metal ion selectivity [37]. This complicates the identification of nickel-specific high-affinity transporter homologs in cyanobacteria based on primary sequence data. Our attempts to identify putative high-affinity nickel transport proteins by homology or binding motifs from the genomes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 did not lead to proteins that could be assigned unambiguously as nickel-binding (or even divalent metal-binding) proteins. Additionally, differences between strains in assembly proteins involved in nickel insertion at the active site of hydrogenase (specificity and/or protein levels) could explain differences among strains in their dependence on nickel supplemented growth medium. Mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 lacking the hydrogenase assembly genes hypA1 or hypB1 involved in nickel insertion at the active site have almost no hydrogenase activity if grown without nickel supplementation, but activities can be increased upon addition of up to 15 μ M nickel [38]. We hope our findings will offer a novel strategy for studying the importance of bidirectional hydrogenases in the energy metabolism. Because A. maxima cultures can be grown with and without nickel supplementation with equal viability and demonstrate differential hydrogen evolution, nickel availability is a potential tool for redirecting fermentative electrons (NAD(P)H) from acid and alcohol products to hydrogen. By studying the difference in fermentative products from cultures with and without nickel supplementation, one could directly assess the degree to which fermentative products are in competition with hydrogenase for NAD(P)H. These experiments are in progress in our laboratory."
