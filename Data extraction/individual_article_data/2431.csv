0,Introduction,"The ability to supply pure hydrogen is instrumental to a number of applications including fuel cells, hydrotreating, and ammonia synthesis. For example, even sub-10ppm levels of carbon monoxide poison proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) anodes [1] and ammonia synthesis catalysts [2]. Since most hydrogen is generated from carbon-based sources, cleanup and separation of carbon species is a key part of the processing. Whereas stationary technology permits the use of the incredible useful water-gas shift reaction, [2] this purification process is equilibrium limited. The need for multiple, large reactors often results. A further non-WGS reactor is also needed to provide a purity level not provided through its equilibrium limitations. This step is often methanation, [2] but the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in the presence of hydrogen or simply PROX catalysis [3,4] is gaining attention as an alternative means. An advantage of using PROX rather than methanation is that hydrogen is not used as a reactant to remove the unwanted carbon monoxide in the PROX reaction. Instead, oxygen is added and the important element is the selectivity of the oxidation catalysis. The main focus of this effort is to demonstrate that methanol decomposition can be combined with PROX catalysis for selective, partial methanol oxidation to generate hydrogen with minimal carbon monoxide production. Oxygen is added to methanol to aid in its decomposition to the desired products of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Similar to PROX catalysis, the key feature is the selective oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide rather than hydrogen to water. This technology takes advantage of the commercial availability of methanol [5] and its proposed [1] use as a as a hydrogen carrier. The application of this technology is not to replace hydrogen purification in large-scale plants, but rather to apply toward niche fuel cell applications where simplicity, foot-print restrictions, and possibly auxiliary processes to recover the waste heat of the exothermic reactions exist making the loss of hydrogen generated by the water-gas shift tolerable. In this study, partial methanol oxidation is demonstrated using silica supported transition metal catalysts. For this initial effort, platinum (Pt) and silver (Ag) catalysts are being employed. Pt and Ag are among the most popular transition metal catalysts for oxidation catalysis [6–9]. The unique properties of precious metals such as Pt allow the concentration of molecules at the surface to increase reaction rates, but also to be resistant to formation of strong adsorption and/or bulk phase transitions [9]. Pt and Pt-based catalysts are commonly studied for PROX catalysis [4,10–12]. Since Ag is a metal with unique oxygen catalysis capabilities, coupling Ag with Pt may lead to interesting catalytic properties including the development of CO-tolerant catalysts, [13] which would be important for other applications including PEMFC anode electrocatalysts. Pt and Ag bimetallic catalysts have been reported as interesting catalysts for the control activity and selectivity through ligand and bifunctional effects [13,14]. Although support effects enhance methanol oxidation rates on Pt and Ag monometallic catalysts [15–17], this initial effort is focused on modifying the metal function directly to control the activity and selectivity."
1,Experimental section,All solvents were research grade from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. All compressed gases were purchased from Airgas in the highest purity available.
2,Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization The nanoparticles capped by polyvinlypyrrolidone (PVP) were prepared by established colloidal routes existing in the literature [18–22]. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6 • 6H2O, 99.9% pure on metals basis), silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99% pure), and polyvinlypyrrolidone (PVP) with a molecular weight of 40,000 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. First, an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid and/or silver nitrate were measured and dissolved into DI water to achieve a volume of 20mL. The concentrations were 6.0mM for the monometallic Ag and Pt particles and 3.0mM each of Pt and Ag for the bimetallic Ag–Pt (1:1) particles. This solution was then diluted with 180mL of methanol. PVP (133mg) was dissolved into this mixture, which was then refluxed for 3h. The combined solution was heated to 110°C in a reflux apparatus to arrive at the reduced nanoparticles. After cooling, the suspension was triple washed (cycles of hexane and ethanol with intermediate centrifugation) to remove excess capping agent with the surfactant. The cleaned particles were re-dispersed in an ethanol suspension. The morphology and size of particles was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images were acquired at acceleration voltages of 60kV using an FEI Morgagni 268D microscope. For each synthesis, the average particle size and a particle size histogram was measured by counting the particle size of 100 particles."
3,Supported catalyst synthesis and characterization,"2.2 Supported catalyst synthesis and characterization The metal nanoparticles were loaded at value of 2 wt. percent on silica (Cab-O-Sil; ~210m2/g). For typical synthesis, the nanoparticle-ethanol suspension was added to an appropriate mass of silica based on the mass of Ag and/or Pt in the suspension. The slurry was sonicated at room temperature for 2h. The silica-immobilized nanoparticles were separated from solution by centrifuging for 15min at 5000rpm. The clear supernatant was decanted. The final catalysts were obtained by drying first at ambient conditions and then at 100°C. The physical mixture of Pt and Ag supported on silica was prepared by mixing the monometallic suspensions to arrive at a catalyst with an equimolar ratio of Pt:Ag of 1:1. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption on an Autosorb IQ (Quantachrome Instruments). Catalysts were degassed at 200°C prior to analysis. Nitrogen isotherms were acquired at 77K. Standard BET analyses was performed to get the specific surface area from the adsorption isotherm."
4,Methanol decomposition and partial oxidation catalytic studies,"2.3 Methanol decomposition and partial oxidation catalytic studies Catalytic methanol decomposition and oxidation were performed with a laboratory-scale, fixed-bed flow reactor enclosed within a Thermolyne furnace. The catalysts (50mg) were loaded into a quartz U-tube reactor between plugs of quartz wool. A type-K thermocouple was used to measure the temperature near the bottom of the catalyst bed. Gas flowrates were controlled by calibrated mass flow controllers (Alicat Scientific). Prior to the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was purged in 50 SCCM of He at 110°C for 30min. A temperature program from room temperature to 110°C with a rate of 5°C/min was used. The sample was then cooled to 50°C under the same gas flow. For experiments without oxygen, a total flow of 50 SCCM was used and it was comprised of 5 SCCM of methanol and 45 SCCM of helium. For experiments with oxygen, a total flow of 50 SCCM was used and it was comprised of 5 SCCM of methanol, 2.5 SCCM of oxygen and 42.5 SCCM of helium. The combined gases were introduced into the reactor at atmospheric pressure and the composition of the effluent stream of the reactor was analyzed on-line by a mass spectrometer (MKS Cirrus) using an electron multiplier detector. Calibrations were performed to convert the raw signals into concentrations. A temperature program from 50 to 350°C with a ramp rate of 10°C/min and a 1h hold at 350°C was used. An extended time-on-stream study was performed with the same conditions as above except the hold was 9h. A post-experiment temperature-program oxidation (TPO) was performed for this case to assess coke formation. For the TPO, the catalyst was cooled to 50°C in He (50 SCCM) following the reaction. Then, the catalyst was heated at 10°C/min to 600°C in 10% O2/He (50 SCCM) while the mass spectrometer was used to measure the effluent gases. TOFs were calculated from the methanol conversion (from m/z=31) normalized per surface metal atom using the size-calculated dispersion to correct for the surface to bulk ratio. All of the oxygen-free rates and activities were obtained under differential conditions (less than 10% conversion). For partial methanol oxidation, the conversions will be denoted in the results section. Only carbon monoxide (m/z=28), carbon dioxide (m/z=44), water (m/z=18), and hydrogen (m/z=2) were observed as products. Selectivity toward hydrogen was calculated by selectivity (hydrogen)=hydrogen concentration * 100 % / (hydrogen concentration+water concentration). A similar equation for used for carbon dioxide selectivity using concentrations of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. No conversion was obtained using silica (no metal) as a catalyst under same conditions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Synthesis and characterization of Pt, Ag and Pt–Ag nanoparticles","3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Pt, Ag and Pt–Ag nanoparticles Colloidal routes are successful methods for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with well-defined morphology [23–26]. Here, a synthesis adopted from the synthesis of ~3nm Pt particles [19,22,27] is applied to the synthesis of Ag, and Ag–Pt bimetallic catalysts. During the syntheses, for the Pt and Pt–Ag nanoparticles, the precursor solution turned black indicating the formation of metal nanoparticles. For the Ag nanoparticles, the solution turned a shade of orange. Such a color change is expected for Ag nanoparticles due to their characteristic plasmonic properties in visible light [28]. The TEM images of Pt, Ag, and Pt–Ag (1:1) nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 1 . From these images, an average particle size and a distribution was determined (Table 1 ) by measuring the size of 100 particles and statistically analyzing the resulting histograms. The Pt nanoparticles had an average size slightly smaller than 3nm and a size deviation of roughly 20%, which both agreed with the literature results [19,22] for this synthesis. The monometallic Ag particle resulted in both a larger size (3.34nm) and a larger deviation (40%) as compared to the Pt particles. The result can be attributed to using a higher temperature (110°C) than needed for the reduction and then forcing Ostwald ripening to simultaneously occur. Ag nanoparticles are typically synthesized at low temperatures to achieve small particles [29] because elevated temperature result in 50+ nm sizes [30]. Interestingly, the Pt–Ag bimetallic nanoparticles demonstrated the smallest size (2.52nm) of the three particles and a deviation similar to the Pt nanoparticles. This finding suggested an interesting nucleation and reduction behavior of combined metal ions and that bimetallic particles resulted. A possible explanation is that Ag ions nucleated and then Pt coated the Ag particles preventing agglomeration. However, computational studies [31] predict, in the absence of adsorbates, the Ag segregation to the surface for both Pt in a host Ag structure and Ag in a host Pt structure. With the water, methanol, and organic capping in solution, the more labile Pt may prefer to segregate to the nanoparticle surface. With the particle sizes on the nanometer scale, sufficiently low diffusion lengths provide the possibility of atomic transport under reaction conditions. From these results and insights, these particles may be expected to have interesting and unique catalytic and optical properties."
7,Immobilization of nanoparticles onto silica and characterization of supported catalysts,"3.2 Immobilization of nanoparticles onto silica and characterization of supported catalysts After washing, the nanoparticles were immobilized onto silica during sonication in an ultrasonic bath. The TEM images in Fig. 1 were taken after washing as well. The nitrogen porosimetry results are presented in Table 2 . The results are well aligned with those values measured for the silica support alone, which indicates no clogging of the pores during the immobilization step. Previous results [32] have demonstrated that washing effectively removes the polymer stabilizing agent by comparing carbon dioxide profiles generated by temperature-programmed oxidation experiments of washed (no CO2 produced) and unwashed (CO2 produced) Pt particles prepared by a similar method as here. Ethylene hydrogenation, a well-studied structure insensitive catalytic reaction over Pt, [33–36], was also performed on the Pt/silica catalyst. A turnover frequency of 12s−1 was measured at T=40°C. Correcting this value to those values previously used in a correlation, [37] a dispersion of 23% was determined. This dispersion is in good agreement with the results calculated from the average particle size of the Pt nanoparticles (Table 1) and previous [22] chemisorption results. By these arguments, the dispersion calculated from the average particle sizes is used for the calculation of turnover frequencies for methanol decomposition described below."
8,Catalysis activity for methanol decomposition and oxidation,"3.3 Catalysis activity for methanol decomposition and oxidation Methanol conversion to syngas was measured with and without oxygen added. The reaction onset temperature, based on the hydrogen signal (m/z=2) for the Pt/silica was 110°C, which is lower, but comparable, to the temperature of ~150°C [17,38] previously reported for a similar catalyst. The shift toward the lower onset temperature in the present study as compared to the previous work [17,38] may be due to the extensive washing protocol used in this study, which is assumed as effective as discussed in Section 3.2. This analysis is supported because high calcination temperatures were needed in the previous studies [17,38] whereas only a low temperature treatment (110°C) to remove water vapor was conducted in this study. From the carbon monoxide signal (m/z=28), a high onset temperature (180°C) was observed relative to that of hydrogen. This finding is in agreement with methanol TPD studies [8,39] performed on Pt (111) single crystals that showed carbon monoxide desorbed at a temperature 70 to 90°C higher than hydrogen. It also suggested that the kinetically limiting step is linked to carbon monoxide desorption, which was previously found [40] for Pd/silica catalysts. Once higher temperatures were reached, the reaction products reached the stoichiometric amounts (twice as much hydrogen as carbon monoxide). The reaction rates and turnover frequencies for the catalysts are compared in Fig. 2 . From these results, the Ag/silica catalyst is observed to be more active than the Pt/silica catalyst. On Pt single crystals, molecularly adsorbed carbon monoxide [41] is the most stable adsorbate out of molecularly adsorbed methanol [39], dissociatively adsorbed methanol [39], and dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen [41]. As mentioned above, carbon monoxide is a key adsorbate in the catalytic cycle and the trend just described from the surface science approach fits with the results obtained here for Pt and Ag catalysts surfaces. Both of the Pt–Ag/silica catalysts yield activities between the two monometallic catalysts (Fig. 2). Since the physical mixture of the monometallic nanoparticles behaved differently than the Ag–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles of the same composition, it suggests the bimetallic particles have modified electronic structures through both Ag and Pt being in the same particle. With regards to stability, little deactivation occurred during the hold at T=350°C for the three Pt-containing catalysts. For the Ag/silica catalyst, roughly 30% of its activity was lost during the 1h hold. Furthermore, multiple cycles conducted on the Ag–Pt/silica catalyst demonstrated the profiles and stability obtained on the first cycle were reproducible in subsequent cycles. With the performances of the catalysts for methanol decomposition now established, the performances for partial methanol oxidation are now discussed. Since the conversions of methanol and oxygen (Fig. 3 ) were no longer limited to differential reactor conditions under the same space velocities used for the oxygen-free experiments, the conversions and apparent rates will be used. At 350°C, oxygen consumption was high over all catalysts. Moreover, the performance was stable over the 1h hold at this temperature. An extended time-on-stream study was performed for the Pt–Ag/silica catalyst as shown in Fig. 4 . Over the nearly 9h on stream, the conversion decreased from 40 to 25%. A post-reaction TPO indicated 0.4g coke formed/(g cat∗h) from the time-on-stream at T=350°C, which was presumed as the source of deactivation. Methanol conversion was greatly increased by the addition of oxygen with Ag/silica again being more active than Pt/silica. The effect of the oxygen addition on the methanol conversion rate is directly compared in Fig. 5 and indicates an order of magnitude increase in the rate in the presence of oxygen for all catalysts. This finding is in agreement with the concept the carbon monoxide poisoning because oxygen aids in the formation of carbon dioxide and water (ideally, just carbon dioxide), which are more likely to have weaker chemical bonds with the metal surfaces. This explanation is in agreement with carbon monoxide being molecularly bound more strongly on Ag and Pt surfaces than carbon dioxide [41]. There was a decrease in the oxygen conversion for the Pt–Ag/silica catalyst as compared to the parent materials and the physical mixture of them. Since oxygen more strongly bounds to model Pt surfaces than Ag surfaces [41] and the binding strength of dissociatively adsorbed oxygen on Pt surfaces is the stronger than methanol, carbon monoxide, water, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide [39,41], Pt enrichment at the surface remains the most likely scenario. In that case, carbon monoxide and oxygen now appear to dictate the conversion process. A Pt overlayer on Ag would weaken the adsorption of oxygen (dissociative) and carbon monoxide (molecular) compared to a pure Pt surface. However, this discussion would still require oxygen conversion of the bimetallic Pt–Ag surface to be between the parent surfaces. Incorporation of the other reaction species is needed to capture the full picture. The methanol conversion selectivities toward the desired products, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, are presented in Fig. 6 . As compared to Pt/silica, the higher activity for oxygen conversion for Ag/silica resulted in less hydrogen (more water) and carbon dioxide, which infers that Ag is better at oxidizing hydrogen than carbon monoxide compared to Pt. The lower oxygen conversion of Pt–Ag/silica catalyst resulted in primarily less carbon dioxide forming compared to the other three catalysts. Additionally, the bimetallic Pt–Ag/silica had similar hydrogen selectivity as the Pt/silica catalyst. These results suggested a change in surface coverage as the Ag amount would be increased. Based on computational studies [41] in model systems, a transition of the dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen from negative to positive should occur as the amount of Ag in the Pt–Ag surface increases. Once the value becomes positive, it is much less likely than hydrogen would become oxidized because its combination and dissociation rates should increase rapidly. Then, there is a window of parameter space in the particle restructuring dynamics (which also depend on conditions and particle composition and size) in which enhanced hydrogen selectivity with low carbon dioxide selectivity would exist. Even though this result was not what was sought, the use of bimetallic catalysts to tune the selectivities to the desired products in partial methanol oxidation to CO-free hydrogen is possible. However, the initial selection of materials warrants further investigation into the desired formulation to maximize hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields."
9,Conclusion and outlook,"Pt, Ag, and Pt–Ag nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple, alcohol reduction and demonstrated size-control on the sub 5nm scale. An existing synthesis for Pt nanoparticles was extended to Ag and bimetallic nanoparticles. Moreover, the unique properties of the bimetallic Pt–Ag particles, as compared to the physical mixture and the parent compounds, demonstrated their bimetallic nature. This synthesis and resulting materials may have many applications including photocatalysis because of the ability to tune the plasmonic and catalytic properties. Here, the particles were demonstrated for their catalytic properties in hydrogen conversion from methanol. The catalytic activity for partial methanol oxidation was greater than methanol decomposition. However, the catalysts selected here showed potential for high hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields when oxygen was added. Further work is needed to refine the process and the catalyst to optimize these yields. The overall effort of this contribution demonstrated a platform to produce CO-free hydrogen from methanol by adding oxygen as a reactant. The technology may be used in niche applications where pure hydrogen is needed from a small footprint reactor. A subsequent goal of this effort is to use these nanoparticles, demonstrated here as active catalysts, for phototcatalysis when supported on titania. The combination of properties of Pt (catalytic and electron trap), Ag (catalytic and photocatalytic [42–44] and plasmonic [28]), and titania (photocatalytic and support) to achieve a high performing photocatalyst for environmental remediation. As with other titania-based catalysts modified by materials and molecules that absorb visible light, the use of a broader spectrum of light is expected through synergistic combination of the metal and titania materials. The application of the metal nanoparticles for the photo-degradation of phenol and phenol derivatives in aqueous solution is the focus of future examination."
