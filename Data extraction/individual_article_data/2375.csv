0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is an underutilized low value renewable resource with an estimated global annual production of 4.63 billion tons [1]. Utilizing this abundant resource for fermentative hydrogen (H2) production could potentially lead to the development of an economical biohydrogen production process [2,3]. Because of their sugar composition, low value biomass such as corn stover [4], sugarcane bagasse [5], switchgrass [6] and wheat straw [7] could serve as viable feedstocks for biohydrogen production. However, lignocellulosic materials are not readily usable because of their complex structure and recalcitrant nature. A major goal of the biofuels industry is to develop pretreatment technologies which can produce chemicals and fuels from lignocellulosics; however, to date, only a few technologies can efficiently use this biomass source [8–10]. Among the different technologies, steam explosion is used extensively to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass [11]. During pretreatment, lignocellulosic residues release free sugars and other chemicals such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), vanillin, syringaldehyde, organic acids and other phenolic compounds [12–14]. A key challenge for producing biofuels from sugars in a liquor produced from pretreatment is to alleviate the microbial inhibitory effects caused by furans (furfural and HMF). Optimum production of sugars with minimum levels of furans is dependent on optimizing the pretreatment conditions. During pretreatment, furfural and HMF are produced from pentose and hexose dehydration, respectively. The levels of furfural and HMF produced are dependent on the nature of the lignocellulosic raw materials, the operating conditions and the treatment process. Many microorganisms modify these compounds as a means to reduce their toxic effects. Furfural is converted into furfuryl alcohol and furoic acid [15] while HMF is either converted to 5-hydroxymethyl furfuryl alcohol [16] or 2,5-bis-hydroxymethylfuran [17]. Evidence describing the effects of HMF and furfural and other furan derivatives on pure cultures have been reported by several researchers [18–20]. According to Pienkos and Zhang [19], the inhibition trend for Escherichia coli LY01, a recombinant ethanologenic strain, is as follows: hydroxybenzaldehyde > vanillin > syringaldehyde > furfural > HMF > ethanol. Hydrogen producing mixed microbial cultures are negatively impacted by furans and furan derivatives. In comparison to H2 producing controls (1.67 mol mol−1 xylose), low H2 yields ranging from 0.34 to 1.39 mol H2 mol−1 xylose have been reported for cultures inhibited with furan derivatives, phenolics and lignin [21]. Inhibition studies demonstrating the larger inhibitory effect caused by furan derivatives in comparison to phenolics have been described by Quemeneur et al. [21]. According to these researchers, H2 yields for cultures fed furan derivatives and phenolics were 0.40–0.51 mol mol−1 xylose and 1.28–1.39 mol mol−1 xylose, respectively. Many studies have shown H2 production from sugars using mixed anaerobic microbial communities [22,23]. Anaerobic microbial communities are a mixture of hydrolytic microorganisms, acidogens, acetogens and methanogens. Two essential populations which can affect the H2 yield are grouped as H2 consumers (methanogens) and H2 producers. In methanogenic reactors, H2 consumers and H2 producers operate in synchrony to maintain low H2 levels and hence, provide stable thermodynamic conditions [24]. Uncoupling this syntrophic condition between H2 consumers and H2 producers by employing different reactor operating strategies and/or applying stressing agents can lead to increased H2 yields. Inorganic acids, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA) and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) such as linoleic acid (LA) are microbial inhibitors and their use as microbial stressing agents have been reported in many studies [25–28]. LCFAs are renewable chemicals, utilizing them to inhibit methanogenesis could be an economical approach for maximizing H2 production when compared to thermal and other chemical methods. According to Ray et al. [27], LA is an excellent H2 uncoupler and hence, a methanogenic inhibitor. Oleic acid (OA) is another LCFA which have been reported to inhibit H2 consumers and subsequently increase the H2 yield in mixed anaerobic communities fed glucose and xylose [23]. Chemical inhibitors impose their effect at threshold levels on specific microbial populations. For example, LA, furfural and HMF are effective in uncoupling the syntrophic interaction between H2 producers and H2 consumers at threshold levels [29,30]. Several studies have provided evidence showing H2 production using LA inhibited cultures fed glucose [27,30]. One objective of this study was to examine the impact of feeding mixtures containing glucose, furfural and HMF to two mixed anaerobic microbial communities not inhibited and inhibited with LA. Another objective was to examine the inhibition of H2 production at threshold furfural and HMF levels and assess their transformation into less toxic compounds."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Inoculum source,"2.1 Inoculum source Mixed anaerobic granular cultures were obtained from two industrial wastewater treatment facilities (Cornwall, ON and Guelph, ON). Cultures (40 g L−1 volatile suspended solids (VSS)) from the treatment facilities were crushed and diluted with basal media in 4 L reactors (designated reactors A and B) to 10 g L−1 VSS. The reactors were maintained at 37 °C and fed with 5 g L−1 glucose every 6 to 7 days (when all the glucose and byprodcuts were converted to methane). The 10 g L−1 VSS culture was diluted with basal media to 2 g L−1 VSS in 160 mL batch reactors. The basal media composition was prepared in accordance with Chowdhury et al. [30]."
3,Experimental design,2.2 Experimental design The experimental design (Table 1 ) was configured to examine the inhibitory effect of furans (HMF and furfural) together with LA on fermentative H2 production from glucose. The design also considered the impact of only furans and the inhibitory effect of varying the HMF and furfural ratio. The selected furfural and HMF levels were based on the concentrations reported by Boopathy [31] and Sanchez and Bautista [32]. The LA concentration (2 g L−1) and pH (5.5) were adapted from work reported by Chaganti et al. [33]. All experimental conditions were examined in triplicate.
4,Experimental conditions,"2.3 Experimental conditions All experiments (Table 1) were examined in 160 mL batch reactors with a 50 mL working volume. The reactors were maintained at 37 °C and the initial pH was adjusted to 5.5. Batch reactor preparation was conducted in an anaerobic glove box with an atmosphere containing approximately 80% N2, 20% CO2 and low levels of H2. The serum bottles were sealed with Teflon®-lined silicone rubber septa and aluminum crimp caps. In order to avoid the formation of negative pressure conditions in the headspace during liquid and gas sampling, 20 mL of the gas from the anaerobic glove box was injected prior to removing the reactors from the anaerobic chamber. The reactors were agitated for 24 h to remove trace H2 levels from the headspace by methanogenesis. Next, the bottles were injected with LA and agitated (200 rpm) again for 24 h at 37 °C before injecting the substrates (glucose, furfural and HMF) on day 0. Gas and liquid samples were removed and analyzed at regular interval over 4 days. Before injecting glucose again on day 4, the reactors were re-opened, the pH was adjusted to 5.5 and the headspace was sparged with N2 for 3 min before sealing them with Teflon® lined red rubber septas and aluminum crimp caps. Gas and liquid samples were removed at regular intervals for an additional 3 days. Before adding the substrates on day 0 and day 4, the reactors were left standing to settle the solids. After settling the solids, the total liquid volume (50 mL) in each reactor was maintained by removing a volume of liquid equivalent to the total volume of the injected substrate stock solutions. A LA (99.9% purity) (Sigma Aldrich, ON) stock solution (50 g L−1) was prepared au-bain marie in accordance with Rinzema et al. [34]. The furfural and HMF stock solutions (50 g L−1) were prepared in Milli-Q water."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Headspace gas samples (25 μL) were analyzed using a Varian-3600 (Palo Alto, CA) gas chromatograph (GC) configured with a TCD detector. A 2 m long × 2 mm I.D. Carbon Shin column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) was used to conduct the gas analysis. The GC injector, detector, and oven temperatures were set at 100 °C, 200 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. The N2 carrier gas flow rate was set at 15 mL min−1. The detection limit for H2 was 5 μL bottle−1 (160 mL) and for methane and CO2 were 10 μL bottle−1 (160 mL). Liquid samples (0.5 mL) were withdrawn and diluted with (4.5 mL) Milli-Q (MQ) water. The samples were centrifuged (4000 rpm) for 10 min and the supernatant filtered using 0.45 μm polypropylene membrane (GE Osmonics, MN) filter to remove suspended solids. Next, the samples were filtered again using a pack bed resin (Chelex 100, Bio-Rad, California) filter to remove dissolved metals. The filtered samples were diluted (1:1) with MQ and analyzed using ion chromatography (IC). Liquid samples containing glucose and alcohol analyses were analyzed using a Dionex-600 IC configured with a 25 cm long × 4 mm diameter CarboPac Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) MA-1 column and ED50 electrochemical detector. The 480 mM NaOH eluent flow rate was set at 0.4 mL min−1. The detection limit for glucose and the alcohols (ethanol, i-propanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and i-butanol) was 5 mg L−1 for an injection volume of 25 μL sample. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in liquid samples were analyzed using a Dionex-600 ion chromatograph IC Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) configured with a conductivity detector. The instrument configuration and analytical method were previously described by Chowdhury et al. [30]. The detection limit for a lactate, acetate, propionate, formate and butyrate was 2 mg L−1 for a 25 μL sample. Furfural, HMF and metabolite byproducts were analyzed using a Dionex Ultimate 2000 high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) configured with a photo-diode array (PDA) detector and a 3.0 mm × 100 mm column (Eclipse plus C18, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The eluent (80% of a 0.5% H3PO4 solution and 20% methanol) flow rate was set at 0.2 mL min−1. The instrument was set to scan at 205, 215, 252 and 280 nm. The detection limit for furfural, HMF, furfuryl alcohol and furoic acid was 0.5 mg L−1 for an injection volume of 10 μL."
6,Microbial analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism,2.5 Microbial analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism Microbial samples were collected at the end of the each experiment (Table 1). Genomic DNA was isolated from the samples. Bacterial and Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the V1-V3 region 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labeled 5′ end of the forward primers [35]. The amplified PCR product (16S rRNA gene) was digested with restriction enzymes Hae III and Hha I. The digested terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel using a DNA analyzer (LICOR). Details of the protocol were previously described by Chaganti et al. [35]. The T-RFs data generated by the digestion of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from the samples were formatted for Phylogenetic Assignment Tool and analyzed online using a default fragment bin tolerance window settings [35].
7,Statistical analysis and modeling,"2.6 Statistical analysis and modeling 2.6.1 Tukey's test All the results in this study are reported as the mean of triplicate samples. The statistical difference between multiple means was compared using the Tukey's test comparison procedure at a 95% confidence level [36]. 2.6.2 Principal component analysis Principal component analysis (PCA), a multivariate analysis tool, was used to assist in elucidating patterns based on their similarity and differences. The method extracts all the factors underlying a set of variables in a data set and represents them in the form of new orthogonal variables which are defined as principal components [37]. Patterns of similarity are represented as clustering of data points on the PCA map. The PCA was conducted using the PAST software package [38]. Gas and liquid metabolites were used as inputs to the PCA. Based on the metabolite distribution pattern, the PCA was used to compare cultures treated under different treatment conditions. 2.6.3 Canonical correspondence analysis Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), a statistical tool widely used in ecological and environmental studies, was used to evaluate the impact of different factors on the composition of mixed microbial communities [39]. Metabolites produced from glucose fermentation were used to represent the factors and their effect on the microbial composition at different fermenting conditions were examined (Table 1). The CCA was performed using the PAST software package [38]. 2.6.4 Kulczynski similarity index A non-parametric clustering technique (multivariate cluster analysis) was used to determine similarities between the T-RFs. The Kulczynski similarity index was used to quantify the number of similar groups present within the microbial samples based on the T-RFs presence or absence [40]. 2.6.5 Anderson–Darling test Fitting the H2 production data to a model equation was performed using Sigma Plot (Systat Software, Inc., IL). The regression coefficient (R 2) and F value were used to evaluate the ‘goodness of fit’. The Anderson–Darling (AD) test was used to assess the normal distribution of the response residuals [41]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Hydrogen production by two cultures,"3.1 Hydrogen production by two cultures No statistical significant difference in the H2 yield was observed for cultures fed 1 g L−1 of furan and 2 g L−1 LA. On day 7, a maximum H2 yield of 1.89 ± 0.27 mol mol−1 glucose was observed for culture A fed LA (2 g L−1), furfural (0.75 g L−1) and HMF (0.25 g L−1) (Expt. # A-2, Table 1) while for culture B fed the same inhibitors at the same levels, the maximum H2 yield was 1.75 ± 0.22 mol mol−1 glucose (Expt. # B-2, Table 1) (Fig. 1 ). Studies by Nissilä et al. [42] have shown a H2 yield of 160 ± 10 mL g−1 TS for mixed anaerobic cultures operating at pH 6 and fed a hydrolysate from dry conifer. Assuming 1 g glucose = 1 g TS and 22.4 L = 1 mol H2 (at standard temperature and pressure), 160 mL H2 g−1 TS is equivalent to 1.3 mol H2 mol−1 glucose. Relative to the maximum yield, adding furfural (1 g L−1) plus HMF (1 g L−1) caused the H2 yield on the day 7 to decrease by 32 ± 4% (1.28 ± 0.12 mol mol−1 glucose) and 48 ± 6% (0.91 ± 0.12 mol mol−1 glucose) in cultures A and B, respectively (Expt. # 6, Table 1). These results suggest that beyond the threshold furfural and HMF levels, the inhibitory effect likely affected not only the H2 consumers but also the H2 producers. Studies describing the impact of furans or lignocellulosic hydrolysates on H2 producing mixed anaerobic cultures are limited and further work is required to establish the full impact of these chemicals on microorganisms. Although data on the fermentation of lignocellulosics residues and hydrolysates to methane showed evidence on the impact of anaerobic microorganisms, no comprehensive study has described the impact of furan and furan derivatives on specific populations. Note according to Nissilä et al. [42], microorganisms belonging to the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were involved in converting a birch and conifer hydrolysate into H2. The Tukey's test at a 95% confidence interval revealed that the H2 yields were statistically similar for cultures A and B treated with LA. This analysis indicates the ratio of furfural to HMF at 1 g L−1 did not affect the H2 yield (Fig. 1, Table 1). Data from this work contradicts work reported by Cao et al. [18] and Mussatto and Roberto [43], where the former observed inhibition in H2 yield observed at 1 g L−1 HMF was greater when compared to 1 g L−1 furfural and the later observed a larger negative synergistic effect when a mixture of the inhibitors was compared to each inhibitor. Evidence showing the impact of LA is based on data for experiments conducted using a feed containing glucose plus 0.5 g L−1 furfural and 0.5 g L−1 HMF (Expt. C, Table 1) in comparison to cultures fed glucose, 2 g L−1 LA, plus 0.5 g L−1 furfural and 0.5 g L−1 HMF (Expt. # 3, Table 1). On day 7, the H2 yield for culture A and culture B receiving 0.5 g L−1 furfural and 0.5 g L−1 HMF were 20 ± 3% (1.46 ± 0.15 mol mol−1 glucose) and 62 ± 15% (0.67 ± 0.38 mol mol−1 glucose), respectively, less in comparison to cultures operating under conditions with maximum yields. The H2 yields in this study are comparable to the yields obtained by Cao et al. [44] for Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 fed acid hydrolyzed corn stalk liquor. These researchers reported a H2 yield range of 0.71–2.24 mol mol−1 sugar for a feed containing furans concentration ranging from 0.21 to 0.94 g L−1 and a culture operating at 60 °C and pH 7. Hydrogen production studies by Fangkum and Reungsang [45] have provided some evidence showing the effects of furans in lignocellulosic liquor. They reported using a hydrolysate containing (g L−1) glucose (1.46), xylose (9.10), arabinose (0.72) acetic acid (1.30) and furfural (0.22). Fangkum and Reungsang [45] reported a H2 yield of 1.48 ± 0.22 mol mol−1 sugar consumed for a heat treated elephant manure culture operating at 55 °C and maintained at a pH of 5.5. Notice studies reported by Cao et al. [44] and Fangkum and Reungsang [45] were conducted under thermophilic conditions while this work was performed using mesophilic cultures."
10,Impact of furans and their degradation byproducts,"3.2 Impact of furans and their degradation byproducts The impact of furans and their degradation byproducts on microorganisms have been reviewed by Almeida et al. [46]. Furfural and HMF can affect the metabolism of many microbial populations. Microorganisms relieve these chemical stresses by converting HMF and furfural into less inhibitory compounds as long as the initial concentrations are not beyond a threshold inhibitory level [47]. In this study, furfural degradation byproducts, furoic acid and furfuryl alcohol, were detected in the fermentation broth (Fig. 2 ). HMF degradation was observed; however, its degradation byproducts were not detected. At threshold levels, inhibitors such as LA and furans are able to affect the metabolic pathways of dominant anaerobic microorganisms and the distribution of fermentation byproducts [27,48]. The distribution of metabolites from glucose fermentation was affected by the presence of furans or furans plus LA. Furoic acid was the major byproduct detected in controls without LA. Although HMF was degraded, the degradation rate was less in comparison to furfural. The ease of HMF degradation in comparison to furfural is similar to data reported by Larsson et al. [13] for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A lag in gas production after the first glucose injection was likely caused by the inhibition imposed by furfural and HMF. Decreasing H2 yields were observed when the furfural and HMF levels increased to a combined total of 2 g L−1 (Fig. 1, Table 1 (Expt. # 6)). In the presence of 1 g L−1 furans (Expt. # 1–5, Table 1), 54.8 ± 3.7% of the electron equivalents were diverted to the total VFAs in culture B. In comparison, increasing the furan level beyond 1 g L−1 (Expt. #6, Table 1) in culture B caused 40.0 ± 5.0% of the electrons equivalents to be diverted into VFAs (Table 2 ). This decrease in electron diversion could be due to differences in the microbial populations as well as variations in the inhibitory effects on H2 producers in the two cultures."
11,Electron distribution under different conditions,"3.3 Electron distribution under different conditions The concentration and distribution of VFAs and alcohols are useful indicators for monitoring H2 production. The major VFAs detected were acetate, propionate and butyrate while ethanol and i-propanol were the key alcohols (Table 2 and Appendix A). Based on the percent electron equivalents, in the presence of feeds containing furans plus LA, the average VFA levels in culture A (36.5 ± 2.4%) was less than culture B (52.3 ± 6.2%) while the average alcohol levels in culture A (34 ± 11%) was greater than in culture B (12 ± 5%) (Table 2). The distribution of electron equivalences is likely linked to synergistic interactions between LA and furans under low pH conditions or LA and low pH conditions. Evidence of LA inhibition at pH 5.5 on methanogens and the redirection of electron equivalents to reduced metabolites was reported by Chaganti et al. [23] and Ray et al. [27]. The acetate concentration was approximately the same for cultures fed 1 g L−1 furans plus LA. In cultures A and B, acetate production accounted for 12.5 ± 0.4% and 16.7 ± 1.1% of the total electron equivalents, respectively. Relative to the controls, acetate formation in cultures A and B was greater by 25 ± 2% and 29 ± 4%, respectively. At elevated furan levels of 2 g L−1, the low acetate levels produced in cultures A and B indicate inhibition of acetogenic microorganisms. In cultures A and B, the quantity of electron equivalents diverted to propionate production was 9 ± 2% and 23 ± 3%, respectively. The propionate levels in culture B controls and those fed furan plus LA were approximately the same. Relative to the control for culture A, more propionate (51 ± 5% (Table 2)) was produced in the furan plus LA fed cultures. The percent electrons diverted to butyrate in cultures A and B fed furan plus LA was approximately the same in both cultures (15 ± 2% (Table 2)). In culture A, the ethanol levels produced were greater in comparison to culture B. In culture A, conditions favoring the growth of ethanol producing microorganisms was likely responsible for the difference in metabolite levels. Notice at a threshold (Expt. A-6 and B-6, Table 1) furan level (1 g L−1 HMF plus 1 g L−1 furfural), the quantity of electron equivalents diverted to i-propanol formation was substantially reduced in cultures A and B. The inhibition of enzymes responsible for i-propanol production by the presence of furans might be responsible for this decrease. Under stressful conditions, microorganisms adapt by implementing numerous mechanisms. In the presence of chemical agents such as HMF and furfural, anaerobic mixed cultures avoid the stress conditions by converting these chemicals into less toxic compounds. The formation of different metabolites at varying levels in two cultures fed the same substrates could be associated with chemical potential fluctuations in microenvironments, differences in the type and quantity of microorganisms and availability of co-factors and adenonucleotides. In microenvironments within cultures A and B, pH variations, metabolite type and concentration as well as microbial populations will affect the metabolic pathways. Under elevated H2 levels, microorganisms relieve stressful conditions by the production of reduced metabolites [49,50]. Metabolic switching between pathways is a strategy used by microorganisms to relieve the effects of inhibitory agents [51]."
12,Principal component analysis,"3.4 Principal component analysis PCA is a tool used to visualize the variance in a data set obtained from multiple samples. The data set analyzed were taken from the measured outputs for the different conditions under which cultures A and B were subjected to during H2 fermentation. These variables included the substrate, gas and liquid metabolites (H2, CH4, lactate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, i-propanol and ethanol). The clusters shown in Fig. 3 are associated with the gas and liquid byproducts. PC1 and PC2 accounted for 67% of the total variability present in the data set (Fig. 3). Based on the loading values, PC1 correlated with butyrate (0.71) and ethanol (0.81) while PC2 was correlated with H2 (0.87) and i-propanol (0.76). Both cultures (A and B) fed mixtures of different furfural and HMF ratios (1 g L−1 total), 5 g L−1 glucose and 2 g L−1 LA were clustered into two groups. This trend indicates the ratio of furfural to HMF did not affect the byproduct distribution for culture A and B when the total furan concentration was set at 1 g L−1. However, at 2 g L−1 furans (1:1 ratio), cultures A and B were clustered and associated with butyrate production. Notice at 2 g L−1 LA, culture A was linked to alcohol and H2 production while oxidized byproducts were associated with culture B (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Controls (cultures A and B) linked to methane production were clustered into one group. At a threshold furan level of 1 g L−1, methane production was not inhibited in both cultures A and B (Expt. C, Table 1). This trend indicates common microbial population between the two cultures are involved in methanogenesis. With increasing stress conditions, the cultures metabolic pathways were expressed differently and diverged into the production of different metabolites. Evidence supporting the influence of stressing agents such as pH and LA has shown to vary the distribution of electron fluxes from glucose to byproducts [33]. Similarly, studies by Qureshi et al. [52] have shown the effects of furans (furfural and HMF) on acetone, ethanol and butanol production by Clostridium beijerinckii P260. At 1.5 g L−1 furfural plus 1.0 g L−1 HMF, they observed a 50% decrease in alcohol productivity."
13,Canonical correspondence analysis,"3.5 Canonical correspondence analysis In the CCA plot, the length of the vector indicates the extent to which the community structure can be explained by a given environmental variable, while the angle between the vectors provides an indicator of the correlation between environmental variables. On the tri-plot, the variables (gas, VFAs and alcohol) are depicted using dashed lines and the T-RFs with band intensity ≥20% are shown by open squares. The first two axis of the CCA explains approximately 47.5% of the species variation in the samples analyzed (Fig. 4 ). Component 1 was mostly associated with methane and butyrate whereas component 2 was associated with acetate, propionate and i-propanol. Note correlations between the variables and the species were weak with 0.04 on the first axis and 0.02 on the second (Table 3 ). The CCA plot showed that LA treated cultures were primarily associated with acetate, propionate, H2 and i-propanol while the control cultures were linked with methane and butyrate. Species which were abundant but less sensitive (correlated) to the factors were closely associated with the cultures within the cluster. Only control cultures (not treated with LA) were located in different quadrants. Species associated with the variables included Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium sp., Flavobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., and Eubacterium sp. Clostridium sp., are known to produce byproducts such as acetate, butyrate, ethanol and propionate [53]. Apart from the liquid byproducts, Clostridium sp. are H2 producers and are able to survive stressful conditions [21,35]. Flavobacetrium sp. is able to grow and ferment feedstocks containing furans [45,54]. The presence of Propionibacterium sp. is strongly associated with the detection of propionate in cultures treated with LA (Table 2). Ren et al. [55] reported that Propionibacterium sp. are facultative anaerobes which could grow on a wide pH range from 5 to 9 and showed propionic acid type of fermentation in mixed anaerobic communities. Bacillus sp. and Thermoanerobacter sp. are known to produce H2 and ethanol from lignocellulosic feed stock [56,57]. Klinke et al. [57] have reported the effect of the fermentation inhibitors in hydrolysate from wheat straw using Thermoanerobacter sp. These authors have shown that Themoanaerobacter sp. were less affected by the furoic acid. The presence of Moorella thermoacetica indicated acetogenic activity which is considered as a known acetogenic bacterium capable of producing acetate from carbon sources such as glucose, CO2 and CO [58]."
14,Modeling the experimental data,"3.6 Modeling the experimental data Interaction effects of LA, furfural and HMF on the response variable are shown in the contour plots (Fig. 5 a and b). The plots are generated for a set value of 1 g L−1 LA. The shape of the contour shows a combined effect caused by furan inhibitors (furfural and HMF) on H2 production. For culture A, when the individual concentration of furfural and HMF were in the range of approximately 0.4–0.7 g L−1 and 0.32–0.7 g L−1, respectively, the peak H2 yield attained was approximately 2 mol mol−1 glucose (Fig. 5a). In the case of culture B, the peak H2 yield attained was approximately 2 mol mol−1 glucose when the individual concentration of furfural and HMF were in the range of approximately 0.53–0.8 g L−1 and 0.48–0.85 g L−1, respectively (Fig. 5b). When the individual concentration of furfural and HMF reached approximately 1 g L−1, the H2 yield attained in culture A and B were 1.3 mol mol−1 glucose and 1.0 mol mol−1 glucose, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). Model equations for the H2 yield as a function of the furfural, HMF and LA concentrations were developed for cultures A and B (Equations (1) and (2)). (1) H 2 yield ( A ) ( mol mol - 1 ) = 2.010 - 0.496 × [ furfural ] ( g L - 1 ) - 0.604 × [ HMF ] ( g L - 1 ) + 0.185 × [ LA ] ( g L - 1 ) (2) H 2 yield ( B ) ( mol mol - 1 ) = 1.382 - 0.654 × [ furfural ] ( g L - 1 ) - 0.770 × [ HMF ] ( g L - 1 ) + 0.476 × [ LA ] ( g L - 1 ) An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the significance of fit for a linear fit. The ANOVA for H2 production in culture A indicated that the F-value of 141.0 at a 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.001) implied that the model was significant (Table 4 ). For culture B, an F value of 40.3 at a 95% confidence interval (p-value = 0.006) was also significant (Table 4). A correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates a good correlation between the predicted and the observed values. In cultures A and B, the correlation coefficients were 0.993 and 0.976, respectively (Fig. 6 a and b). Based on the F and p values, the models fit to the experimental data were adequate. The H2 yield data for the two cultures was tested for normality using the AD test (Fig. 6c and d). The AD plots indicated a normal distribution of the residuals. The AD values of 0.229 and 0.319 for culture A and B, respectively, were less than the critical value of 0.717 for a sample size of 7. The models were significant at a 5% level of confidence based on p-values for both cultures which were larger than 0.05."
15,Microbial analysis,"3.7 Microbial analysis A cluster analysis was used to identify clusters among the mixed microbial cultures based on their similarity pattern. The cluster analysis is based on the Kulczynski similarity measure paired group algorithm. The analysis was conducted using the presence–absence of the T-RFs. The dendrogram is divided into 12 leaf nodes and 2 clusters or clades (Fig. 7 ). The length of connecting lines reflects the degree of dissimilarity. For example, the similarity between A4 and B4 is greater than that between B1 and B2. The degree of similarity between A4, A5, B4 and B5 is approximately 54%–80%. The goodness of fit of the T-RFs data set is supported by a cophenetic correlation coefficient of 0.87. Clade 1, with a similarity index range from 40 to 65%, showed the presence of H2 producing organisms such as Clostridium sp. and Flavobacterium sp. In addition to H2 producers in Clade 1, Methanococcus sp. was detected in the control cultures fed furans. According to Belay et al. [27] Methanococcus sp. is capable of degrading furfural and HMF. A possible reason for the control cultures to cluster with the culture treated with LA may be due to the presence of the H2 producers belonging to the same genera. Clade 2, sharing a similarity index of 50%–75%, were affiliated with the LA inhibited cultures A and B fed HMF ≥0.5 g L−1 (Expt. # 3, 4 and 5). Methane producers (Methanococcus sp.) in cultures treated with LA and fed 1 g L−1 furans (Expt. # 1–5, Table 1) were inhibited while H2 producers, Clostridium sp. and Flavobacterium sp., were unaffected. No methane was detected in cultures examined in experiments #1 to #5 (data not shown). According to Lopez et al. [54], Flavobacterium sp. are capable of degrading furans. Furthermore, Akutsu et al. [59] and Lu et al. [60] have reported Flavobacterium sp. is capable of producing H2 from complex substrate such as starch and corn stalk. The presence of Flavobacterium sp. in cultures fed furfural and HMF indicate they survived the chemical stress condition and likely degraded sugars in a liquid hydrolyzate. Data from this work contradicts reports by Quéméneur et al. [21] where 1 g L−1 furfural or 1 g L−1 HMF inhibited H2 production. Notice increasing the furan level to 2 g L−1 (1 g L−1 furfural plus 1 g L−1 HMF) with 2 g L−1 LA likely inhibited Clostridium sp., Flavobacterium sp. in addition to Methanococcus sp."
16,Conclusions,"In mixed anaerobic cultures treated with LA, fermentative H2 production was affected by furans. Furan levels up to 1 g L−1 in different furfural and HMF ratios were favorable to propionate or ethanol production in cultures A and B. Relative to the maximum yields, at higher furan levels with LA treatment, the H2 yield decreased by 32 ± 04% and 48 ± 06% in cultures A and B, respectively. In both control cultures fed 1 g L−1 of furfural and HMF at equal ratio, Methanococcus sp. and H2 producers were presented. Methanogenesis was not observed in LA treated cultures fed 1 and 2 g L−1 furan. Clostridium sp. and Flavobacterium sp. were detected in both cultures A and B. Furans were converted to less toxic compounds in control and LA inhibited cultures. The maximum H2 yield observed was 1.89 ± 0.27 mol mol−1 glucose and 1.75 ± 0.22 mol mol−1 glucose in cultures A and B, respectively, for a feed containing, 0.75 g L−1 furfural, 0.25 g L−1 HMF and 5 g L−1 glucose. The model demonstrated that the furfural or/and HMF concentrations ranging above 0.75–0.8 g L−1 lowered the H2 yield in cultures A and B fed LA. A PCA biplot revealed the metabolite distribution was dependent on the culture source. Alcohols and VFAs in liquid byproducts were associated with cultures A and B, respectively. A CCA based on the T-RFs and the fermentation metabolites revealed a weak interaction between the species composition and factors."
