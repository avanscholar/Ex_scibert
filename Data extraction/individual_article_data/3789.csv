0,Introduction,"Conversion of CO2 to valuable products provides an acceptable solution for reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. CO2 has been used as C1 feedstock for synthesis of various chemicals and fuel alternatives [1,2]. The hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates provides an alternative energy storage solution. Unfortunately, the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons is a challenging task because of thermodynamic stability, chemical inertness and fully oxidized nature of the CO2 molecule which often required high pressure conditions for obtaining desirable products [3]. Among the products, the synthesis of paraffins and olefins from CO2 is valuable compared to methane, although methane production is thermodynamically more favorable [4,5]. The lower olefins, such as ethene (C2=) and propene (C3=), are important basic feedstock for industries and are considered to be value added products [6]. It has been widely accepted that the transformation of CO2 to hydrocarbons proceeds in two steps. First, CO is formed from hydrogenation of CO2 by reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) route. Then, CO undergoes further hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons by different types of intermediate species formation [7]. Cobalt based catalysts have been widely explored for synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO by Fischer-Tropsch process [8]. So far less attention has been focused on cobalt catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions, due to more selective methane formation tendency [9]. The relatively low heat of CO2 adsorption on catalyst surface favors the fast hydrogenation of surface-adsorbed intermediates, leading to the shift in CO2 hydrogenation selectivity towards methane and decreased C2+ hydrocarbon yield [10,11]. In order to obtain valuable hydrocarbons, it is highly desirable to suppress the fast hydrogenation activity of cobalt. The catalytic performance of cobalt based hydrogenation catalyst is largely affected by the Co surface species. The higher concentration of surface Co3+ species is responsible for high conversion and hydrocarbon selectivity [12]. In addition, partially reduced cobalt species retards activity for secondary reaction of olefins to form paraffin hydrocarbons [13,14]. Researchers have investigated promoted cobalt catalyst systems for the conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons [15–17]. Owen et al. showed that the addition of noble metals and alkali promoters in cobalt based catalysts enhanced the hydrocarbon selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions [18]. However it is a difficult task to produce C2+ hydrocarbons by unpromoted cobalt catalyst under similar conditions. Catalytic materials containing same composition but different morphologies and structures show significant diversity in catalytic activity, selectivity due to varying extent of exposable active sites [19–23]. Co3O4 materials with different structures and morphologies have been widely reported as catalysts as well as support materials for noble metals for heterogeneous catalytic processes like CO oxidation, NOx reduction, glycerol reduction, water oxidation and oxidation of volatile organic compounds [24 and references therein]. Recently Jimenez et al. demonstrated that the reduction under pure hydrogen of different faceted Co3O4 particles generates active surface species enabling to tune the product selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Co3O4 nanorods with exposed {110} facets exhibit higher methane yield by inhibiting the formation of site blocking formate species as compared to conventional Co3O4 nanoparticles with exposed {111} and {001} facets [25]. Hydrogenation of CO2 over mesoporous solid oxides is of great interest, not only due to their textural properties but also due to their lower deactivation and product distribution property [26–29]. The ordered and open porosity can also enhance the mass transfer efficiency of the products through the mesoporous structure with less formation of deposited inactive coke [30,31]. Mesoporous metal oxides, especially cobalt oxide, have been well studied in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Li et al. reported Pt promoted mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols under high pressure conditions [27]. It was observed that the ordered mesoporous structure promotes the carbon chain growth for production of higher alcohols and retards the rate of methane formation. The hard silica templating or nanocasting method is a versatile route for synthesis of mesoporous metal oxides. By changing the silica template pore structure, it is indeed possible to synthesize mesoporous metal oxides with different textural properties [32]. In this study, ordered mesoporous Co3O4 with tunable textural parameters are synthesized by using two dimensional longitudinal mesoporous channels containing SBA-15 and three dimensional interconnected mesoporous KIT-6 silica as hard templates. Obtained 2D and 3D replicas are evaluated in atmospheric pressure CO2 hydrogenation. In terms of ease of safe handling of hydrogen and for a hydrogen economy, development of a stable CO2 hydrogenation catalyst under atmospheric conditions is a boon. SBA-15 silica hard template generates two dimensional mesoporous Co3O4 (m-Co-SBA-15), while KIT-6 silica forms interconnected three dimensional mesoporous Co3O4 (m-Co-KIT-6). Thus by changing the pore structure of hard silica template, ordered mesoporous Co3O4 materials with different pore morphologies have been developed. For comparison, non porous Co3O4 nanoparticles were also prepared by a precipitation method. The mesoporous Co3O4 nanostructures as well as Co3O4 nanoparticles have been extensively characterized by N2-physisorption, XRD, TEM, H2-TPR and XPS techniques. Further, the importance of morphology of the catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions has been reported."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were purchased from Thomas Baker Chemicals. The PEO-PPO-PEO Pluronic triblock copolymer (P123) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. All chemicals used were of analytical grade and used in synthesis without further purification. 2.1.1 Preparation of hard template mesoporous silica Mesoporous KIT-6 silica particles were prepared according to procedure given in literature [33]. In a typical synthesis, 12 g of P123 was first dissolved in 432 mL distilled water and 23.7 g of conc. HCl (37%), the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 37 °C to form a complete homogeneous solution. Then 12 g of n-butanol was added at the same temperature and stirred for another 1 h. After that 25.8 g TEOS (Tertra Ethyl Ortho Silicate) was added. The mixture was kept under vigorous stirring at 37 °C for another 24 h and subjected to hydrothermal treatment in polypropylene bottle under static and constant conditions at 100 °C for 24 h. The solid product was filtered, washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried in oven at 80 °C and finally calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. Similarly mesoporous SBA-15 was also prepared according to a reported procedure [34]. In a typical synthesis, 12 g P123 was dissolved in 450 mL of 1.6 M HCl solution and stirred for 3 h at 37 °C to obtain a transparent homogeneous mixture. After that TEOS was added at same temperature conditions and continuously stirred for 4 h. The mixture was left under static conditions in polypropylene bottle at 100 °C for 24 h (hydrothermal treatment). The solid product was filtered, washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried in oven at 80 °C and finally calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of mesoporous cobalt oxide KIT-6 and SBA-15 silica’s were used as hard templates for the synthesis of mesoporous cobalt oxides. Briefly, 0.5 g KIT-6 or SBA-15 was dispersed in 4 mL of 0.8 M cobalt nitrate precursor ethanolic solution and sonicated for 1 min and subsequently stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The silica precursor mixture was then kept in an oven at 55 °C for evaporation of ethanol. After complete drying the composite was calcined in air at 200 °C for 4 h. The black colour composite was re-dispersed with cobalt nitrate precursor solution (0.8 M, 3.5 mL) followed by evaporation and calcination at 500 °C with ramping rate 1 °C/min for 4 h with a plateau of 200 °C for 2 h. The silica template was removed from the black color composite by NaOH etching. Hot solution of 2 M NaOH was used to selectively solubilize the silica template followed by repeated washings with water and ethanol. Finally, a black powder of mesoporous cobalt oxide was obtained by drying at 80 °C. The mesoporous cobalt oxides obtained using SBA-15 and KIT-6 silica were denoted as m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 respectively. 2.1.3 Preparation of cobalt oxide nanoparticles Co3O4-nano was synthesized by precipitation of cobalt nitrate precursor using 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution. The final precipitate was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol and then dried in oven at 80 °C for overnight. Finally, dried powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of samples were recorded with a FEI Tecnai 20 instrument equipped with a cold field electron gun. The 200 keV accelerating power with LaB6 filament were used. The samples were prepared on meshed copper microscopic grid by drop casting of ethanolic solution of catalyst followed by drying. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of prepared materials were measured with a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 apparatus with adsorption analyses performed at 77 K. Before the analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C (for silica template) and 200 °C (for mesoporous cobalt oxide) for 3 h. The specific surface areas were measured from the BET method at relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.2. The total pore volumes were determined by total volume adsorbed at relative pressure of 0.95. The pore size distribution curves were obtained from the desorption branch of isotherm using BJH equation. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of fresh and spent mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts were measured in the range of 10–80° using a Bruker-D8 diffractometer with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 3°/min. The Co3O4 crystallite size of all fresh catalysts were estimated using Debye-Scherrer equation with the value of FWHM obtained from the most intense peak of Co3O4 diffraction pattern at 2θ = 36.8°. In order to verify the formation of an ordered mesoporous structure, low angle-XRD analysis was also carried out using Rigaku D/max instrument operating at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu-Kα radiation of λ = 1.5406 Å in the range of 0.5–5°. To evaluate the reducibility of Co3O4, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out using an Autochem II 2920 apparatus equipped with a TCD detector (Micromeritics instrument). The samples (25 mg) were loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor and purged with 30 mL/min He, heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min to 200 °C, and temperature was maintained for 1 h to remove traces of water and impurities. After cooling to 50 °C, the samples were reduced in a flow of 5 vol% H2/He (30 mL/min) while being heated from 50 to 800 °C at 5 °C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific K alpha+ spectrometer equipped with a microfocussed and monochromatic Al Kα x-ray radiation source. The wide area spectrum was acquired using 200 eV pass energy while for individual core levels 50 eV pass energy was used. Charge neutralization gun was switched on during the data acquisition. All measured binding energies were calibrated with C 1s line at 284.6 eV as reference."
4,Typical procedure for atmospheric pressure CO2 hydrogenation,"2.3 Typical procedure for atmospheric pressure CO2 hydrogenation All catalytic tests were carried out in a plug-flow tubular quartz reactor of 40 cm length and with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The reactor was fixed inside a carbolite vertical furnace equipped with a programmable temperature controller. Typically, 50 mg powder catalyst was mixed with 100 mg SiC as diluent with a granule size of 200 mesh. Prior to CO2 hydrogenation, Co3O4 catalysts were reduced in situ at 350 °C under pure stream of H2 for 3 h. The catalysts were then cooled to 100 °C under H2 stream. Mixed gases CO2, H2 and N2 (1:3:0.5) with WHSV of 10,800 mL h−1 gcat −1 were introduced into the reactor and catalytic bed temperature was increased to reaction temperature. The effluent gas from the reactor was analyzed by using an online gas chromatograph (Nucon 5765, GC) equipped with two columns in parallel: one is a HP plot-Q capillary column connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) for the analysis of C1–C5 hydrocarbons, and the other a carbosieve packed column connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the analysis of permanent gases H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. The stability tests were performed under the same space velocity at 320 °C for 24 h. The conversion of CO2 (X CO2) was calculated using eq. (1) (1) X C O 2 % = C O 2 i n - C O 2 o u t C O 2 i n × 100 % where [CO2]in and [CO2]out represent the concentration of CO2 in the inlet and outlet gas, respectively. The selectivity of specific product (S specific product) was calculated using eq. (2) (2) S s p e c i f i c p r o d u c t ( % ) = % s p e c i f i c p r o d u c t % t o t a l p r o d u c t s × 100 % where % specific product was calculated from standard calibration The olefin fraction (%) was calculated using eq. (3) (3) F r a c t i o n o l e f i n ( % ) = % C 2 + a l k e n e s % C 2 + h y d r o c a r b o n × 100 % The turn over frequency (TOF) was calculated using eq. (4) (4) T O F ( s e c - 1 ) = X C O 2 × C O 2 t o t a l m c a t a l y s t × [ C o ] s u r f ÷ M C o where XCO2 is the conversion of CO2, [CO2]total is the total concentration of CO2 (mol/sec), mcatalyst is the mass of catalyst, [Co]surf is the content of surface Co in the catalyst based on H2-pulse chemisorption analysis and MCo is the relative atomic mass of the Co (58.94 g/mol)"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Textural characterization of catalysts Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) pore size distribution plots of ordered mesoporous Co3O4 replicas and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms were observed for both mesoporous samples, which suggest the successful replication of silica templates. The hysteresis loop of the Co3O4 mesoporous materials is observed at relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.4–0.9 and reflects the capillary condensation phenomenon in the mesopores. The adsorption step at high relative pressure (P/P0) > 0.9 is typically associated with inter particles voids. Due to an increase in the density of the replicated materials (6.11 g.cm−3 for Co3O4 versus 2.2 g.cm−3 for silica), the sorption isotherm shows a reduction in nitrogen uptake compared with the parent KIT-6 and SBA-15 templates (Fig. S1). In comparison, the isotherm of Co3O4 nanoparticles was found similar to a weakly porous material exhibiting significant intergranular spaces as suggested by the nitrogen uptake at high relative pressure. Textural properties including surface area, average pore diameter and total pore volume of all Co3O4 catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . From the data presented in Table 1, it is obvious that m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 are having similar range of surface areas (96–108 m2/g), average pore sizes (3.9–4.1 nm), and pore volumes (0.12–0.13 cm3/g). The surface areas of mesoporous Co3O4 prepared by nanocasting method were much higher than those of Co3O4-nano (37 m2/g) synthesized by the precipitation method. Fig. 2 a shows the low angle XRD patterns of m-Co-KIT-6, m-Co-SBA-15 and Co3O4-nano samples. The low angle XRD pattern of corresponding silica template is also provided in supporting information (Fig. S2) and indicates the successful synthesis of SBA-15 and KIT-6 silica with expected mesostructure. In ordered mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts the low angle XRD pattern reflects the corresponding mesoporous silica template and suggest the ordered porosity to be maintained during the replication process [24]. The m-Co-SBA-15 catalyst showed diffraction peaks at 1.00°, 1.14° and 1.85° 2θ values which correspond to (100), (110) and (200) plane in a p6mm 2D ordered mesostructure [35]. Similarly, in m-Co-KIT-6, a diffraction peak for (220) plane at 1.00° 2θ value can be clearly assigned to an Ia3d cubic ordered mesostructure [36]. However, in the case of Co3O4 obtained by the precipitation method, no peak was observed in low angle XRD region indicating the absence of ordered mesoporosity. Thus, there is an overall agreement between low angle XRD data from N2-physisorption results. The wide angle powder X-ray diffraction patterns from all the fresh Co3O4 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2b, and are in good agreement with the formation of face-centered cubic Co3O4 spinel phase (JCPDS 42-1467). The 2θ values observed were 19.0, 31.2, 36.8, 38.5, 44.8, 59.3 and 65.2°, which represent the characteristic crystalline Co3O4 diffraction of (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (511) and (440) planes respectively [37]. The average crystallite size of Co3O4 was estimated through Debye-Scherrer equation after Warren’s correction, using the most intense peak at 2θ value at 36.8° and the results are summarized in Table 1. The crystallite size of the two mesoporous Co3O4 were found to be in similar range, 11.0 and 12.3 nm for m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 respectively. The crystallite size calculated for Co3O4-nano was 22.3 nm. The particle sizes of metallic cobalt obtained from Co3O4 crystallites were also calculated using the equation d(Co°) = 0.75 × d(Co3O4) on the basis of relative molar volume change [38]. The calculated metallic particle size was found to be 17.2 nm for Co3O4-nano and above 8 nm for all mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst. Since CO2 hydrogenation is size insensitive above 6−8 nm Co particles [39], the particle size variation of our cobalt catalysts were deemed not critical in the activity comparison. Fig. 3 shows the transmission electron microscopy images of the Co3O4-nano, m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6. From the images it is observed that each particle of Co3O4-nano is composed of individual dispersed crystallites (Fig. 3A and 3a), whereas m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 mesostructures were interconnected in nature. By carefully examining the TEM images of m-Co-SBA-15 (Fig. 3B and 3b) and m-Co-KIT-6 (Fig. 3C and 3c), it can be concluded that highly ordered mesoporous structure was obtained by nanocasting of corresponding silica template. Additional TEM images of silica template SBA-15 and KIT-6 are provided in supporting information (Fig. S3). When SBA-15 was employed as hard template the growth of Co3O4 particles occurred in two dimensions and gave rise to rod-shaped particles with two-dimensional pore channels. However, in the case of KIT-6 the growth of Co3O4 proceeds in three dimensions resulting in the formation of 3D cubic mesoporous structure. Selected area energy dispersive X-ray (SAEDX) spectra showed negligible presence of silica in mesoporous Co3O4 which confirmed an efficient removal of the silica template during etching process."
7,Reducibility and surface composition of catalysts,"3.2 Reducibility and surface composition of catalysts The reduction process of the different cobalt oxides was determined by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments and shown in Fig. 4 . A stepwise reduction behavior with characteristic reduction peaks, first for the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO at low temperature domains and the second reduction step for reduction of CoO to metallic cobalt at higher temperature were clearly identified [40]. For Co3O4-nano, two characteristic reduction peaks were observed at 285 and 360 °C. Interestingly, the second reduction peak of the mesoporous Co3O4 is shifted to higher temperature. We attribute this high temperature shift to the ordered hexagonal pore Co3O4 framework which could attenuate the diffusion rate of H2 through the mesopores by trapped water formed during reduction [14]. The quantifiable low temperature H2-TPR reduction peak area of Co3O4-nano is much smaller than the high temperature reduction peak, which indicated that the concentration of reducible Co3+ is smaller in comparison to m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 catalysts (trend we also observed from XPS analysis), that is coherent with the 1/3 Co(II) – 2/3 Co(III) repartition in Co3O4. In the two mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts, shoulder peak was observed between the two major reduction peaks, which could originate from aggregation of Co particles formed due to a partial structure collapse during synthesis step. It is already known that the substantial amount of Co3+ species on catalyst surface could play important role in reducibility. XPS is a popular and extremely useful technique to analyze the surface chemical composition and species of a solid catalyst [41]. Fig. 5 shows the Co 2p and O 1s spectra of Co3O4 catalysts. The Co 2p3/2 has two components at binding energies 779.8 and 781.3 eV with corresponding 2p1/2 at 794.9 and 796.5 eV which are assigned to Co3+ and Co2+ ions respectively. The energy difference between the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peak is 15.2 eV, which matches well with that of the pure phase Co3O4 [42,43]. The surface Co2+/Co3+ ratio for as synthesized m-Co-KIT-6 (0.81) was lower than those of other two catalysts which has almost similar fraction of Co2+ and Co3+ in m-Co-SBA-15 (1.12) and Co3O4-nano (1.19) catalysts (Fig. 5a). The reduced catalyst shows altogether different cobalt surface characteristics. There is a clear indication of a substantial increase of Co2+ in m-Co-KIT-6 where total Co2+ on the surface (5.3) was higher compared to m-Co-SBA-15 (1.93) and Co3O4-nano (1.50). The reason for the presence of larger proportion of Co2+ in m-Co-KIT-6 is further understood by the analysis of O1 s spectra of the reduced catalyst. For the O1 s spectra, the signal for each catalyst could be deconvoluted into three components corresponding to the surface lattice oxygen species (O) at 529.5 eV, surface adsorbed oxygen species (O’) at 531.4 eV and surface bound water species (O”) at 533.2 eV [44,45]. The O1s spectra collected from the as-synthesized m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst shows large fraction of adsorbed surface bound water species (Fig. S6) compared to other two catalysts. The presence of higher fraction of adsorbed water (∼ 533 eV) in m-Co-KIT-6 followed by m-Co-SBA-15 also suggests the stability of adsorbed water in the confined pores which was found to influence the reducibility of the mesoporous catalyst. This observation matches well with the TPR results discussed in the previous section. The O1 s spectra of reduced catalyst were used to calculate the O’ads/Olatt. ratio for all the catalysts. It is evident that m-Co-KIT-6 (4.21) has higher O’ads species compared to m-Co-SBA-15 and Co3O4-nano catalysts. Quantitative analysis giving surface composition of the Co 2p and O 1s spectra is summarized in Table 2 . It is well known that Co2+ or oxygen vacancy centers are sites for CO2 activation [46,47]. The XPS quantification results indicate that there was higher density of oxygen vacancies on m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst in comparison to other two catalysts. Larger fraction of these sites can influence the CO2 hydrogenation activity in the catalysts prepared in this study. The amount of H2 uptake during H2-TPR process by different Co3O4 catalysts are also listed in Table 2. The H2-TPR results also matched well with XPS analysis."
8,CO2 hydrogenation activity and product selectivity under atmospheric pressure,"3.3 CO2 hydrogenation activity and product selectivity under atmospheric pressure The catalytic CO2 hydrogenation activity of the different Co3O4 catalysts were carried out at atmospheric pressure and with a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 10,800 mL mixed gas/gcat h. The CO2 conversion rate as a function of temperature was monitored and measured at 6 h under steady state conditions as shown in Fig. 6 a. With increase in temperature the rate of CO2 conversion increased in all Co3O4 catalyst. However, above 320 °C the activity of Co3O4-nano was far below the mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts. At 320 °C, m-Co-KIT-6 showed 16.9% CO2 conversion and outperformed the m-Co-SBA-15 catalyst with a CO2 conversion of about 9.5%. Above this temperature, it should be noted that the difference in CO2 conversion between m-Co-KIT-6 and m-Co-SBA-15 is not significantly different. However, the difference in the selectivity of these catalysts at different temperatures was worth noting (Fig. 6b, c and d). Co3O4-nano showed higher selectivity for methane under all reaction temperature conditions. The CO selectivity for Co3O4-nano and m-Co-SBA-15 were significantly lower compared to the m-Co-KIT-6 which can be attributed to the metallic Co generated on these catalysts during the reaction or under pretreatment condition. It is well established that the metallic Co is largely responsible for methane selectivity under atmospheric CO2 hydrogenation [48]. In the case of mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts, a steady increase in methane selectivity was observed reaching close to Co3O4-nano (80%) at 400 °C m-Co-SBA-15. Among the mesoporous catalysts, the methane selectivity was significantly lower at all temperatures for m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst with selectivity reaching only up to 59% at the highest reaction temperature. This can be attributed to the resistance of metallic Co formation on m-Co-KIT-6 due to the presence of water in the confined three dimensional mesoporous cages. The spent catalysts analysis by XPS clearly indicates the generation of more metallic Co sites where the peak maxima in Co2p is shifted towards lower binding energy side in m-Co-SBA-15 and Co3O4-nano catalysts whereas m-Co-KIT-6 largely existed in Co2+ (Fig. S7). The selectivity of C2+ hydrocarbons showed morphological trends since a higher selectivity is observed for mesoporous Co3O4 compared to Co3O4-nano with respect to temperature. However at 400 °C the C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity is drastically decreased for m-Co-KIT-6 and m-Co-SBA-15 catalysts and reached close to Co3O4-nano, which we attribute to the collapse of the mesoporous structure under such conditions (discussed later). It is quite interesting that under different reaction temperatures, olefin fraction is highest for m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst (Fig. 6b). The difference in catalytic selectivity for products between mesoporous m-Co-KIT-6, m-Co-SBA-15 and Co3O4-nano clearly suggest a strong impact of the surface state and morphology of the mesoporous m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst. Fig. 7 summarizes the product selectivity and olefin fraction at a reaction temperature of 320 °C for all Co3O4 catalysts. The Co3O4 catalysts synthesized using hard silica templates showed higher C2+ selectivity compared to Co3O4-nano. Furthermore, the high percentage of olefin fraction exclusively present in out stream products and catalyzed by m-Co-KIT-6 may be due to prevention of secondary hydrogenation of olefin to paraffin by the 3D pore network of the catalyst and the presence of high percentage of Co2+ cobalt species on m-Co-KIT-6. The TOFs (Table 3 ) were calculated using metallic Co present on catalysts surface estimated by H2-Pulse chemisorption after pretreatment under similar reduction condition before the reaction. The values of TOF were found to be 0.214 for Co3O4-nano, 0.331 for m-Co-SBA-15 and 1.171 for m-Co-KIT-6. The higher TOF value for m-Co-KIT-6 can be attributed to lower Co metallic surface area and high intrinsic CO2 conversion. In order to evaluate the stability of catalysts, time on stream study was carried out for 24 h at 320 °C (Fig. 8 ). The catalytic CO2 conversion was higher for m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst while both m-Co-SBA-15 and Co3O4-nano catalysts showed almost similar CO2 conversion for 24 h time on stream. For m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst, the activity drops down initially and gets stabilized after 16 h. But the overall activity was always higher than the other catalysts. This trend can be attributed to be due to two reasons; 1) partially collapsed mesostructure as indicated in the TEM of spent catalysts (Fig. S4); 2) long duration required to reach steady state of reaction in 3D-mesoporous m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst. The yield of C2+ hydrocarbons on different Co3O4 catalysts were in the order of m-Co-KIT-6 > m-Co-SBA-15 > Co3O4-nano indicating that the textural properties of the catalyst played an important role in C2+ hydrocarbon formation. Further the product selectivity and olefin fraction of m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst was evaluated by screening the catalyst time on stream reaction at 320 °C for 24 h (Fig. 9 ). The catalyst showed consistent olefin fraction with slight decrease in C2+ selectivity until it stabilized at 16 h. Decrease in C2+ selectivity was also accompanied by CO selectivity increase. Fig. 10 shows the influence of pre-reduction temperature of m-Co-KIT and m-Co-SBA-15 catalyst on CO2 conversion and product selectivity. It was found that the reduction temperature had negligible effect on CO2 conversion. However, for both mesoporous catalysts an increase in the reduction temperature to 400 °C resulted in a decrease in the selectivity for C2+ products and increased CH4 selectivity. For m-Co-KIT-6 catalyst CH4 selectivity increased from 47% to 80% and C2+ selectivity decreased from 25% to 15%. However, high reduction temperature pretreatment resulted in mesostructure collapse of Co3O4 which was clearly observed in TEM analysis of 400 °C reduced spent catalyst (Fig. S5)."
9,Conclusion,"Mesoporous m-Co-SBA-15 and m-Co-KIT-6 catalysts were prepared by the silica nanocasting method and nano-Co3O4 catalyst was prepared by the precipitation method. The order of CO2 hydrogenation activity is m-Co-KIT-6 > m-Co-SBA-15 > nano-Co3O4. The distribution of CH4, CO and C2+ hydrocarbon products over these mesostructured Co3O4 catalysts were found to be different from the Co3O4-nano catalyst. The latter showed only methane production with negligible amount of C2+ hydrocarbons fraction produced. m-Co-SBA-15 formed both CH4 and C2+ hydrocarbons. However, 3-dimensional mesoporous m-Co-KIT-6 showed high selectivity for CO and C2+ hydrocarbons with higher olefins fraction. According to different characterization results, mesoporous Co3O4 catalysts, especially m-Co-KIT-6 possessed 3-D pore structure arrangement, stable Co2+ cationic species and abundant active surface oxygen defective centers. It can be concluded that the pore structure properties of mesoporous Co3O4 largely controls the adsorption, activation and diffusion of reactants, thereby controlling the finally observed activity and selectivity. The study of mesoporous structure-surface composition-activity relationships provides new understanding for the production of hydrocarbons (other than methane) in CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions."
