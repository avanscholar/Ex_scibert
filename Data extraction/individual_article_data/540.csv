0,Introduction,"Li2TiO3 is one of the most promising solid tritium breeder materials and has many advantages including an excellent chemical stability [1], a good compatibility with structural materials [2], and an excellent tritium release ability [3]. Therefore, China chooses Li2TiO3 as one of the alternative materials for tritium breeding. Li et al. [4] speculated that self-sustained tritium would be one of the key issues in the first phase for the 200 MW Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor (CFETR). To popularize fusion energy, it is necessary to mass-produce tritium. Large-scale tritium factories will have to be constituted to produce tritium in a self-sufficient manner [5]. Since tritium production consumes a large amount of tritium breeder pebbles, improving the production rate of tritium breeder pebbles is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Besides, Mandal et al. [6] suggested the burn up of tritium breeder pebbles in the fusion reactor would only be 15–17 atomic percentage. At the end of the life of the pebbles, more than 45% unused 6Li isotope remained. Therefore, the recovery and recycling of the unused Li from Li2TiO3 pebbles may be an alternative option used to improve service efficiency of tritium breeder. Currently, the main preparation methods of breeder ceramic pebble include melting [7,8], wet processes [9], extrusion-spheroidization [10,11]. The melting method is a simple process and a promising approach for mass-producing tritium-breeding ceramic with a high yield and a high density. Schott in Germany can produce 200–300 kg per year by this method [12]. However, it is difficult to control the size (diameter) of the pebbles accurately during the melting spray process [13]. In addition, too high temperature differences lead to large internal stress in the ceramic pebbles prepared since microcracks form and affect the mechanical properties. The wet method can be used to prepare pebbles with a high sphericity, a high crush load, and a uniform size. Lee et al. [14] prepared Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles with a size distribution from 1.2 to 1.5 mm and a crush load as high as 50 N. However, the fluidity of the slurry is a critical factor that seriously restricts the efficient production of pellets and the annual output only reaches a few dozen kilograms [15,16]. The extrusion-spheroidization technique is an efficient method for the massive production of Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles. However, the pebble shape is difficult to control during spheroidization and the fabricated pebbles usually have a wide size distribution [17,18]. To overcome the limitations of the current methods, we introduce a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) assisted granulation method (APG). APG is a novel process to prepare tritium ceramic pebbles and has many advantages, such as simplicity, low-cost, high yields, and ideal sphericity. The process consists of three steps: the pretreatment of the powder particles, spheronization at low speeds, and densification at high speeds. The detailed process is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this work, the formation mechanism of Li2TiO3 GPs prepared by APG was investigated. In addition, the phase, the microstructure, and the mechanical properties of the sintered Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles were studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Li2TiO3 powders,"2.1 Preparation of Li2TiO3 powders The powders were fabricated by liquid-phase ball-milling. 2.22 mol/L of metatitanic acid (H2TiO3, analytical reagent, ≥98.0%) and 4.44 mol/L lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H2O, guaranteed reagent, ≥99.0%) were added to 400 mL deionized water in a ball-milling jar and stirred for 5 min (min). Then, ball-milling at 180–200 revolutions per minute (rpm) was performed for 12–15 h (h). Next, the ball-milled slurry was dried, grinded, and sieved. Finally, the Li2TiO3 powder obtained was set aside. The reactions of the ball-milling process at room temperature and atmospheric pressure are: (1) H2TiO3 (s) + 2 LiOH·H2O (s) → Li2TiO3 (s) + 4H2O (l) (2) CO2 (g) + 2 LiOH·H2O (s) → Li2CO3 (s) + 3H2O (l)"
3,Preparation of Li2TiO3 green pebbles,"2.2 Preparation of Li2TiO3 green pebbles The mass production of GPs was composed of three steps, as shown in Fig. 1. First, the powders were pretreated (Fig. 1a). 100 g of Li2TiO3 powder was added to 1 L (1 wt%) of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, analytical reagent, ≥98.0%) solution. Then, the mixture was stirred at 70–80 °C for 5–8 h until the surface of the Li2TiO3 powder particle was fully infiltrated and tightly coated with PVA through the engaging force, hydrogen bonding force, van der Waals’ force, and the liquid bridge force. Finally, the mixture was dried at 80–100 °C for 10–12 h, and then milled, sieved to obtain an ultrafine secondary-powder. Second, spheronization was carried out at low speeds. As shown in Fig. 1b, a small amount of secondary-powder was sprayed in the low-speed rotary table using the upper-right nozzle. When the powder particles were spread evenly under the centrifugal force, a certain amount (3 wt%) of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, analytical reagent, ≥95.0%) solution was sprayed on the surface of the Li2TiO3 powder particles in a rotary table using the upper-left nozzle. After the PVP solution uniformly wetted the surface and the powder particles bonded formed aggregates, the new Li2TiO3 secondary-powder was sprayed again. This was performed in alternately until the ideal sized of GP was obtained. In this alternate process, the powder was bonded layer by layer owing to the viscosity interaction of the solution and powder. The PVA molecules on the surface of the powder particle were tightly bound to the PVP molecules by hydrogen bonding, liquid bridge forces, and diffusion. These three factors accelerated the spheroidization rate of the GP. G. Jaya Rao et al. [19] suggested that the molecules of the binder cross-linking into a three-dimensional network with interspersed water used to produce an extruded mass with sufficient strength for spherodization. Therefore, for our samples, the space grid structure constituted of PVA and PVP in the GP (upper-right inset of Fig. 1b) could form a skeleton that improved the spheronization rate of the GP. The size of the pebbles could be controlled by changing the amount of powders. Third, densification was carried out at high speeds. As shown in Fig. 1c, the molded GPs were transferred to a high-speed rotating ball-mill (200–220 rpm) for rolling without the ceramic ball. The final density, the sphericity, and the crush load of the GPs were improved under the action of the centrifugal force, the jar wall force, the frictional forces from the wall of the ball grinding tank [20], the collision forces between the pebbles, and the three internal forces of the pebbles (engaging force, interaction force, and diffusion)."
4,Preparation of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles,"2.3 Preparation of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles When the GPs in the ball mill jar reached a certain strength, they were taken out. After screening, the uniform GPs were sintered at different temperatures (700 °C, 750 °C, 800 °C, 850 °C, 900 °C, and 950 °C) in a muffle furnace to obtain the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles. The current production capacity of the system is 50 g per hour (g/h). This was expected to improve further by scaling-up the equipment used."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The phase analysis of the powders and the ceramics was carried out on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance, Germany). The microstructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6360LV, Japan). The grain size and the sphericity were determined using the Nano Measurer software. The crush load was measured on a universal testing machine (AGS-X Series, Shimadzu Europa GmbH, Germany). The quantitative elemental analysis was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 730, United States)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Phase and micromorphology of Li2TiO3 powders,"3.1 Phase and micromorphology of Li2TiO3 powders The phase and the crystallization degree of Li2TiO3 powders are shown in Fig. 2 a. Two intensive peaks near 43° and 63° are attributed to the ( 1 ¯ 33 ) and ( 2 ¯ 06 ) diffraction peaks of Li2TiO3, respectively. This confirms that the main component is Li2TiO3. A few weak peaks of Li2CO3 are observed at low diffraction angles from the reaction between LiOH and CO2 in the high-speed ball-milling process or due to putting the powders in air for a long time. The melting point of Li2CO3 is only 618 °C [21]. Therefore, the liquid phase (Li2CO3) will hinder agglomeration and contribute to obtain finer, more isolated Li2TiO3 grain particles during the subsequent sintering process [22]. The microstructures of the powders are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The powder is made of well-dispersed softly agglomerated particles with sizes from 1 to 5 μm. They consist of massive crystallites with sizes from 10 to 20 nm."
8,Phase and micromorphology of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles,"3.2 Phase and micromorphology of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles XRD patterns were acquired to investigate the phase and the crystallization degree of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles (Fig. 3 ). The diffraction peaks at all sintering temperatures correspond to Li2TiO3 and match well with JCPDS-33-0831. Besides, the ICP-OES measurements show that the ideal molar ratio of lithium to titanium for the sintered samples was 2.098. Thereby illustrating the high purity of the samples. The peaks of Li2CO3 observed previously disappear, which is attributed to de-carbonation during sintering [23]. The cross-sectional microscopic morphology of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles for different rolling durations are shown in Fig. 4 . Initially, a mass of irregular pores appear for short rolling durations (Fig. 4a and b). When the rolling duration increases, the pore size decreases gradually and the pores are distributed more uniformly. And the engaging force in the powder particles of GP, the hydrogen bonding forces, the liquid bridge forces between PVA and PVP, and the interaction force between GPs all increase. Higher forces increased the agglomeration rate and the densification of the GPs, particularly for GPs rolled for 96 h (Fig. 4e). Sintering necks and grain interfusion are clearly observed, which indicates that the material has a high sintering activity. However, when the duration increased to 108 h, large pores appear again. This is likely due to the evaporation of water that decreases the liquid bridge force and the hydrogen bonding force. Our results indicate an optimal duration of the rolling process of 96 h. To investigate the sintering of Li2TiO3 ceramics produced by APG, SEM images and the grain size distribution for different sintering temperatures are acquired, as shown in Fig. 5 . When the temperature increases from 700 to 950 °C, the pore size and the number of pores gradually decrease, whereas the densification and the crystalline grain size both increase gradually, as shown in Fig. 5a–f. A nonlinear fit suggests that the grain size follows a log-normal distribution in all cases. The grain size increases rapidly from 89.80 nm to 2.87 μm. The values obtained are smaller than previously published results for the same sintering temperatures [24], because the longer chain structure of PVA helps reducing the fusion of Li2TiO3 particles from steric effects during the PVA infiltration process (Fig. 1a) [25]. Obtaining powder particles with a good dispersion is one of the most important prerequisites to prepare small-grained Li2TiO3 ceramic pebble."
9,Morphology and sphericity of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles,"3.3 Morphology and sphericity of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles Fig. 6 a shows over 1 kg of Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles with a good uniformity in the enlarged image (Fig. 6a1) using APG. The sphericity is an important indicator to evaluate the pebble quality and is defined as the ratio of the maximum diameter to the minimum diameter of a pebble [26]. The distribution of the sphericity in ceramic pebbles obtained by APG is shown in Fig. 6b. The sphericity is relatively narrowly distributed with values ranging from 1.00 to 1.30. The average value is only 1.08, which is higher than that obtained by Ying et al. [27]. Good wettability [28] and dispersion [29] of PVP are conduced to increase the sphericity. Pebbles with sizes of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm are shown in Fig. 6c. The size can be controlled by changing the amount of PVA and Li2TiO3 powders during the second preparation step (Fig. 1b). Fig. 6d shows the section of a ceramic pebble. The interior is solid and the microstructure is uniform, rings are clearly visible. This confirms that the pebble is molded through the layer-by-layer caking of powder particles under the influence of PVA and the PVP binders."
10,Crush load of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles,"3.4 Crush load of the Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles The tritium breeder pebbles need a high crush load to prevent them from breaking or being pulverized in the tritium-breeding module [30]. Therefore, the crush loads at different sintering temperatures are showed in Fig. 7 . A sintering temperature of 850 °C produced an optimal crush load of 15.31 N. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the crush load. The change of crush load may result from the joint effect of densification and layer structure. As can be seen from Fig. 8 a–c, with the increase of sintering temperature from 700 to 850 °C, the densification plays a decisive role to improving crush load. And the layer structure is nonexistent. With the further increase of temperature from 850 to 950 °C, densification further increases. What's more, the layer structure appears from Fig. 8d–f, this is due to the thermal stress caused by excessive temperature difference between inside and outside of the pebble. And the layer structure spreads outward from the center of the pebble. Especially for the sample sintered at 950 °C, the cavity structure forms, which may be the main reason for decrease in strength of the pebble at this time. The ideal rolling duration is 96 h and corresponding to a crush load of 21.16 N (Fig. 9 ). When the rolling duration increases to 108 h, the crush load decreases to 16.07 N, which is attributed to the reduced adhesion between powder particles caused by the evaporation of water. In addition, the data indicates that the crush load is generally low, which mainly depends on the spheronization process, rolling and bonding form a layered structure and different parts visible that may be the reason for the poor crush load of the pebbles."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a mass production process of Li2TiO3 tritium breeder ceramic pebbles with a good sphericity of 1.08 was proposed using PVA and PVP assisted granulation method (APG). The current production capacity of the system is 50 g/h. The space grid structures composed of PVA and PVP binders provides a skeleton that improves the spheronization rate of the Li2TiO3 GPs. Additionally, the good wettability and the good dispersion of the PVP help improve the sphericity. A rolling duration of 96 h is optimal to obtain Li2TiO3 ceramic pebbles with a maximum crush load of 21.16 N. However, this value still does not meet the requirements of the CFETR. Therefore, the crush load of the pebbles must still be increased further."
