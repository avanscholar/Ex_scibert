0,Introduction,"Biorefinery, the production of fuels or chemicals from biomass, has caught the world’s attention due to the limited fossil fuel resources [1–3]. Oxygen-containing chemicals from biomass have high market price and furfural that comes mostly from the dehydration of sugars is an interesting intermediate in biorefinery for industrial use [4–6]. For example, it can be converted into furfuryl alcohol (FOL), and then used to produce lysine [7,8], lubricants and thermostatic resins [9–11]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a promising technology for the hydrogenation of CO and CC groups, including the conversion of furfural to FOL [12,13]. Comparing to the explosive H2, using renewable alcohols or organic acids as hydrogenation donor is easier and safer to transport [14,15]. It is reported that CTH of furfural is carried out via a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction obeying acid-base mechanism [16–18]. Thus, solid base catalysts (e.g. K3PO4 [19], γ-Fe2O3@HAP [20]) and acid/base bifunctional catalyst (e.g. Al-Zr@Fe3O4 [21]) are active for CTH of carbonyl compounds. Perovskite oxides with ABO3 formula can be regarded as one type of acid-base catalyst owing to the presence of cationic metals and anionic oxygen vacancies, and hence applied to the CTH reactions [22–24]. For example, Kulkarni et al. reported that LaMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, Al) perovskites were used for CTH of aromatic nitro compounds with iso-propanol as hydrogen donor and KOH as promoter [25]. One concern of using perovskite oxides for catalysis is that they display low surface areas and expose limited number of active sites, restraining its ability to absorb the reactants and catalyze the reaction. To improve the surface area, many methods have been reported, including the use of soft and hard templates to fabricate porous structure [26,27], the dispersion on high-surface-area supports [28–30]. We recently also found that the filling of carbon materials to the holes made between the LaFeO3 particles can improve the surface area and accelerate the rate of reactants being transferred to the active site, thus enhancing the activity for CTH reactions [31]. Carbon materials have been received great attentions in many fields owing to its high surface area, microporous structure and rich surface functional groups [32–35]. For example, it can be an adsorbent for the adsorption removal of organic molecules [36,37]. The good adsorption capacity of carbon potentiates that it could be used in heterogeneous catalysis as a promoter to enhance the ability of catalyst to absorb reactants for activation, as observed in the previous work [38]. Moreover, the textural properties of carbon can be tuned by altering preparation method [39], or using different organic precursors [40], thus offering a way to tailor the texture of carbon according to the specific demand of reaction. In this work, based on our previous achievements that the presence of carbon can enhance greatly the activity of LaFeO3 for CTH reactions by absorbing and delivering reactants from solution to the active sites [31], we investigated the effects of different carbon precursors on the structure and catalytic CTH performances of the as-prepared LaFeO3 and carbon composites (LaFeO3@C-x), to extend and rich the previous results. The filling of carbon was achieved by a facile one-step method as described previously and the physicochemical properties of LaFeO3@C-x were tuned by using different organic precursors. It was found that the carbon sources affect significantly the physicochemical properties of carbon and also that of LaFeO3, for example, the pore structure, the surface area and the surface functional groups of carbon materials; and the crystalline size and the oxygen vacancy amount of LaFeO3. Consequently, the ability of carbon to absorb and deliver reactants from solution to active site, and the ability of LaFeO3 to catalyze the reaction between furfural and isopropanol, changes and depends on the carbon precursor used. Among LaFeO3@C-x, the sample prepared using maltose as carbon precursor (defined as LaFeO3@C-M) exhibited the best CTH performances. The effects of catalyst mass, reaction time and reaction temperature on the catalytic performances, as well as the reusability and the applicability of LaFeO3@C-M to other substrates, were systematically investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 5 mmol La(NO3)3, 5 mmol Fe(NO3)3 and carbon precursors (glucose C6H12O6·H2O, sucrose C12H22O11, soluble starch (C6H10O5)n, fructose C6H12O6 or maltose C12H22O11·H2O) were first dissolved in 20 mL deionized water. Since the diverse carbon weight per mole of precursor, the molar ratio of (La + Fe) to C6 in carbohydrates is kept at 1:2. The mixture was then stirred and heated in a water bath at 80 °C for 1 h, yielding a brown gel. The gel was dried at 100 °C overnight, grinded and finally heated to 700 °C with a rate of 3 °C/min in N2 atmosphere and kept at this temperature for 4 h, to carbonize the carbon precursor and yield the LaFeO3 perovskite simultaneously. Depending on the carbon precursors, these in-situ prepared LaFeO3 and carbon composites were defined as LaFeO3@C-x (x represents the initials of carbon precursors). Thus, LaFeO3@C-G, LaFeO3@C-S, LaFeO3@C-SS, LaFeO3@C-F and LaFeO3@C-M are prepared using glucose, sucrose, soluble starch, fructose and maltose as carbon precursor, respectively. For comparison, pure LaFeO3 was prepared by sol-gel method using citric acid as chelating agent. The dried sample was directly calcined in air at 700 °C for 4 h and the product was denoted as LaFeO3_A."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray instrument using Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å). The operation voltage was 40 kV and the current was 40 mA. XRD data were recorded with a resolution of 0.02° and a scan speed of 10°/min. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on an ASAP 2460 physisorption apparatus at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C) and the surface area was calculated by multiple points using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Before measurements, sample was treated in vacuum for 5 h at 150 °C. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449F5 thermal analyzer under a dynamic air atmosphere (80 mL/min) in the temperature range 40−800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. XPS measurements were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi apparatus (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source with voltage of 15 kV. The sample was demagnetized before sample pretreatment. The binding energies were calibrated using C 1s (284.8 eV) as reference. Peak fitting was performed using the Thermo Scientific Avantage software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin instrument equipped with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Raman spectra were collected via a Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution) with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser. The zeta potentials were measured at room temperature using a zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern). Typically, 5 mg sample was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water by ultra-sonication for 30 min. The zeta potential was measured three times. In order to obtain the isoelectric point (IEP), the pH value of the suspension was adjusted by adding 0.25 mol/L HCl or NaOH solution. The average zeta potential was plotted against the pH value. The pH value where the zeta potential was zero was taken as the isoelectric point."
4,Activity tests,"2.3 Activity tests CTH of furfural was carried out in a sealed stainless steel reactor (100 mL). Furfural (85 μL), dodecane (85 μL, internal standard), catalyst (50 mg), and iso-propanol (15 mL) were charged in the reactor and sealed in N2 atmosphere (1.0 MPa). The reactor was heated to 180 °C and kept for 3 h with a stirring speed of 300 rpm. After reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and the products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP2020) equipped with an SH-Rxi-5Sil MS column (30 m ×0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The reaction activity was evaluated in terms of reaction rate of furfural, which was defined with reference to the mass of LaFeO3, as follows: R e a c t i o n r a t e = { [ F u r ] 0 – [ F u r ] t } * V m L a F e O 3 * t Where [Fur]0 and [Fur] t represent the concentrations of furfural at reaction time 0 and t (h), respectively; V represents the solution volume and mLaFeO3 represents the mass of LaFeO3 in the composite catalyst. For each CTH reaction, the composite catalyst mass is 50 mg and the LaFeO3 content of the LaFeO3@C-x composites (LaFeO3 wt%) was obtained from the TGA result. Thus the mass of LaFeO3 in the catalyst is calculated as follows: mLaFeO3 = 50 mg × LaFeO3 wt%. In this work, the reaction time t (h) was set at 3 h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the LaFeO3@C-x composites,"3.1 Characterization of the LaFeO3@C-x composites Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of LaFeO3@C-x composites synthesized with different carbon precursors. Compared with pure LaFeO3 by sol-gel method, all samples have the characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to LaFeO3 perovskite, indicating that the carbon precursors do not affect the formation of perovskite LaFeO3. Whereas, as listed in Table 1 , the crystalline size of LaFeO3 calculated by the Scherrer equation varies with the carbon precursor, and the composite LaFeO3@C-S, prepared using sucrose as carbon precursor, has the smallest LaFeO3 particle size (10.0 nm), which is almost half than that of LaFeO3@C-M prepared using maltose as carbon precursor (18.9 nm). That is, although the carbon precursor does not affect the formation of LaFeO3 perovskite phase, it influences the morphology of LaFeO3. The better crystalline structure is formed for LaFeO3@C-M. In addition, from the TGA profiles presented in Fig. 1B, we see that the carbon contents of the samples also vary with the carbon precursors, with the highest obtained from LaFeO3@C-S (37.5 %) and the lowest from LaFeO3@-SS and LaFeO3@-F (26.8 %). For LaFeO3@-SS, LaFeO3@-F and LaFeO3@-M, the mass increases of 2.1 % under 300 °C is probably due to the oxidation of the incomplete oxidized iron species formed in the reductive preparation process. As the weight loss has no direct relation to the number of carbon atoms in the precursors, we infer that the carbon content produced depends not only on the number of carbon atoms in the precursors that is used to yield carbon, but also on the physiochemical properties of carbon precursors, e.g., the melting point and the burning temperature. Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of LaFeO3@C-x and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The rapid increase of N2 adsorption volume at relative pressure (p/p0 ) below 0.1 reveals that microporous carbon materials are formed in the composites. All the samples show type IV isotherms with capillary condensation steps at p/p0 of 0.4−0.8, Fig. 2A, suggesting that they not only have micropores, but also mesopores. However, the different shapes of hysteresis loops indicate that they have different pore structures, due to the varied properties of each carbon precursor. As depicted in Fig. 2B, the LaFeO3@C-x composites have three regions of pore distribution, centering at 0.5−0.6, 1.2 and 2.7 nm. From Table 1, the specific surface areas of LaFeO3@C-x composites are between 134 and 170 m2/g, which are much larger than the sole perovskite oxide (21.3 m2/g) due to the presence of carbon materials [41]. The LaFeO3@C-SS composites, prepared using soluble starch as carbon precursor, exhibit the highest SBET and pore volume while the lowest micropore area and micropore volume. This can be partly the fact that it has the lowest carbon contents, as detected by the TGA measurements (Fig. 1B). Therefore, more pores are created due to the release of carbon materials while less contributions to the micropores. For similar reasons, the LaFeO3@C-S composite that possesses the highest carbon content, shows low SBET and the highest micropore area and volume. As shown in Fig. S1, Raman spectra confirm the presence of carbon materials and measure the defect structure. All the composites have two bands at 1595 and 1336 cm−1, assigned to the G and D bands of carbon materials, respectively. The intensity ratios of D band to G band (ID/IG) for them are almost the same (0.89), implying that all the carbon materials have similar and large amounts of surface defects. TEM images show that the LaFeO3 nanoparticles are well dispersed in the carbon materials, except that for LaFeO3@C-G, Fig. 3 A. The aggregation of LaFeO3 nanoparticles in LaFeO3@C-G may be that the carbonization of glucose does not synchronize with the formation of perovskite LaFeO3, and the decomposition of metal nitrates probably occurs earlier than the carbonization of glucose. The particle sizes of LaFeO3 are in the range of 10−20 nm, which is in well accordance to that calculated from the XRD patterns. It is possible that the LaFeO3 nanoparticles are separated or enwrapped by carbon materials, or that the growth of LaFeO3 particles is restricted by the carbon materials, as demonstrated above. Compared with bulk LaFeO3 prepared by conventional sol-gel method that was calcined directly in air atmosphere [42], the present LaFeO3 nanoparticles would expose more active sites due to the smaller particle size. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of LaFeO3@C-M shows that the lattice distance of LaFeO3 is 0.278 nm, Fig. 3F, corresponding to the (121) crystal face of LaFeO3, and is in well agreement with the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 32.2° in XRD patterns."
7,Surface compositions and properties,"3.2 Surface compositions and properties Analysis on the surface properties of LaFeO3@C-x from XPS measurements are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S2-S4. The surface atomic distributions of La and Fe vary with the carbon precursors. The percentage of carbon is far higher than the other elements on the surface, due to the presence of carbon materials and the adventitious carbon. This implies that the LaFeO3 perovskites is wrapped by the carbon materials, as observed in the TEM images. Interestingly, the oxygen atoms also have high percentage, with values in the range of 26–31 %, suggesting that a large number of oxygen functional groups are formed on the carbon surface, besides the oxygen that are adsorbed from air atmosphere. The surface percentage for La and Fe atoms is small, since most of them are wrapped by the carbon materials. The surface La/Fe ratio is above stoichiometry of theoretic LaFeO3, and depends closely on the carbon precursor used, suggesting that the LaFeO3@C-x composites exhibit La-enriched surface composition, especially for the LaFeO3@C-M sample, which has a La/Fe ratio of 2.26. Deconvolution of Fe 2p spectra gives three peaks, assignable to Fe3+, Fe4+ and shake-up satellite, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2. As for the Fe4+/Fe3+ molar ratio, LaFeO3@C-S with the highest carbon contents shows the lowest value (1.51), suggesting that the carbon content affects partly the reduction of Fe4+ to Fe3+. Meanwhile, LaFeO3@C-S also shows the lowest La/Fe ratio of 1.18. The Fe4+/Fe3+ molar ratio of other samples are in the range of 1.7–1.9, and the LaFeO3@C-M that has the highest La enrichment, also shows high Fe4+/Fe3+ ratio (1.91). Two peaks can be fitted for the O1s spectra (Fig. S3), with the first locating at ca. 532.5 eV attributed to the oxygen adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy and that in the oxygen functional group (defined as OA), and the later at ca. 529.7 eV to the lattice oxygen (defined as OL) of LaFeO3 [43]. As expected, the ratios of OA/OL vary with the carbon precursors, due to the variations in the surface La/Fe ratio and the different properties of carbon materials. From the values listed in Table 2, it is seen that the LaFeO3@C-M composites have the highest OA/OL ratio of 1.98, namely, more oxygen vacancies and/or oxygen functional groups, which can be adsorption site of reactants (e.g., furfural) [41,44]. The lowest ratio of 1.19 over LaFeO3@C-SS may affect the adsorption ability of reactants on the catalyst surface. The presence of surface oxygen functional groups is confirmed by the C 1s XPS, Fig. S4, which can be deconvoluted into five well-resolved peaks, with the first attributed to sp2 CC and sp3 CC (284.6 eV) and the others to CO (285.7 eV), >CO (287.3 eV) and COOR (289.2 eV) groups and the π-π* shake-up feature (290.4 eV). This explains why a large amount of oxygen atoms are detected on the surface of samples. It is known that the proceeding of CTH reaction follows an acid-base mechanism, thus the surface acidity and basicity of catalysts play a crucial role in such reactions. However, it is not feasible to measure the surface acidity and basicity of catalyst by the conventional TPD method due to the presence of carbon materials, as it is hard to differentiate whether the desorbed gases (e.g., CO2 or NH3) is from the basic/acidic sites or just from that stayed inside the pores of carbon. Also, the surface oxygen functional groups of carbon can be decomposed at high temperature, thus interfering with the result. For these reasons, we evaluated the surface charges by measuring the Zeta potentials of the LaFeO3@C-x composites in the pH range of 2–12, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . The isoelectric point (IEP) represents the pH of solution at which the net surface charge of adsorbent is zero. It is similar for LaFeO3@C-SS, LaFeO3@C-F and LaFeO3@C-M, with pH value of 3.6, which is higher than that of LaFeO3@C-G and LaFeO3@C-S. When pH is below the IEP, LaFeO3@C-SS, LaFeO3@C-F and LaFeO3@C-M exhibited higher Zeta potential values than LaFeO3@C-G and LaFeO3@C-S, suggesting a stronger surface acidity of the former samples. With increasing the pH value, the surface of all the composites is negatively charged, and LaFeO3@C-M shows the most negative Zeta potential, which implies that it has more negative charges and stronger basicity than the others [45–47]. Hence, it is inferred that the LaFeO3@C-M has the most matched surface acidity and basicity among the investigated composites."
8,Catalytic performance of LaFeO3@C-x,"3.3 Catalytic performance of LaFeO3@C-x For blank experiment without catalyst, the FOL yield is only 5.4 % (entry 1, Table 3 ), indicating that the CTH reaction is hard to occur without catalyst. When pure LaFeO3 (LaFeO3_A) is added, the FOL selectivity increases greatly but the FOL yield is 11.1 % (entry 2, Table 3). The composite of LaFeO3 and carbon exhibits much better performances for CTH reaction, and the best activity is obtained from LaFeO3@C-M, which shows furfural conversion to FOL of 93.2 % and FOL selectivity of 94.1 %. It could be inferred that the participation of carbon component facilitates the transportation of reactants to active sites in CTH reaction as reported in our previous work [31]. The FOL yield increases in order of LaFeO3@C-S < LaFeO3@C-G ≈ LaFeO3@C-SS < LaFeO3@C-F < LaFeO3@C-M (entry 4-8, Table 3). To identify whether the activity comes from LaFeO3 or carbon, the activity of carbon, which was obtained by etching the sample (e.g., LaFeO3@C-M) with HCl, for the CTH reaction was also tested (entry 2, Table 3). Although the furfural conversion seems high (23.7 %), the FOL selectivity and yield are only 12.7 % and 3.0 %. This suggests that the furfural conversion is mostly attributed to the adsorption of furfural on the carbon, without being converted to FOL, namely, LaFeO3 is the active site of the CTH reaction. Therefore, the CTH reaction rate in the following was calculated by referring LaFeO3 as the active site. Table 3 compares that the reaction rates obtained from the LaFeO2@C-x samples, showing that the highest is obtained at LaFeO3@C-M (9.27), which is three times higher than that of the LaFeO3@C-S (3.05). This suggests that the carbon materials in the composites also play important role in the reaction. Considering that carbon is less active to the reaction, we infer that the role of carbon is to absorb and deliver the reactants from solution to the LaFeO3 active sites, where the reaction occurs, as proposed previously [31]. Also, the FOL selectivity varies with the carbon precursors, with similar trends as that observed for furfural conversion. To identify whether the variation of FOL selectivity is due to the formation of byproducts or that the furfural is adsorbed on the carbon surface, the solution after reaction was analyzed by GC–MS and the total ionic chromatography was shown in Fig. S5. The results showed that byproduct furfurylideneacetone is formed over LaFeO3@C-S, demonstrating that the decrease of FOL selectivity is due to the formation of byproducts. Hence, the carbon material not only affects the ability to adsorb and deliver reactant from solution to LaFeO3 active site, but also influences the reaction process. To illuminate the factors accounting for the high activity of LaFeO3@C-M, the relationship between the activity and the physicochemical properties of catalysts are correlated based on the characterizations discussed above. From the XRD patterns and N2 physisorption, it seems that the activity has no direct relation to the crystalline size and BET surface area. It could be that all the samples have small crystalline size (< 19 nm) and big BET surface area (> 130 m2/g), and the small difference between them is negligible for the reaction. That is, the effect of textural properties could be neglected. As for the surface properties, the surface enriched La atoms, the oxygen vacancy and/or surface oxygen functional groups are beneficial to the CTH reaction. It has been reported that basic La2O3 is more active than Fe2O3 for the CTH reaction [41,48], and oxygen vacancies or surface oxygen functional groups can be the adsorption sites of reactants (e.g., furfural) [44]. Therefore, LaFeO3@C-M and LaFeO3@C-F with larger surface La/Fe and OA/OL ratios show higher reaction rate than the others. Even for LaFeO3@C-G with particle aggregations (Fig. 3A), it exhibits higher reaction rate than LaFeO3@C-S and LaFeO3@C-SS because of its larger surface La/Fe and OA/OL ratios. Correlation to the Zeta potential results shows that sample (i.e., LaFeO3@C-M) with stronger surface acidity and basicity facilitates better to the reaction. Whereas, from the absolute Zeta potential of LaFeO3@C-M, we see that the surface basicity is stronger than the surface acidity. It has been reported that the dominant surface base of perovskites facilitates the dehydrogenation of iso-propanol, which is the primary step of CTH reaction [23]. This supports our results that LaFeO3@C-M with the strongest basicity exhibits the highest activity than the others. That is, surface base is more crucial than surface acid for the CTH reactions. Overall, the carbon precursors affect not only the carbon contents, but also the surface compositions and properties of LaFeO3@C-x composites, such as the surface La enrichment, the oxygen vacancies or the surface oxygen functional groups and thus the surface acidity and basicity. This offers a facile route to tailor the textural and surface properties of LaFeO3@C by simply changing the carbon precursor. Among the carbohydrates investigated, maltose is appropriate for synthesizing carbon encapsulated LaFeO3 with strong surface basicity. Consequently, a possible reaction route for the CTH reaction conducted on LaFeO3@C composites is proposed, as shown in Fig. 5 . The reactants furfural and iso-propanol are first adsorbed on the porous carbon component that has rich surface oxygen functional groups, and then transferred through the meso/micropores to the active sites of LaFeO3, where the CTH reaction occurs. As reported in our previous work [41], >C = O group of furfural is adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy and the O atom of iso-propanol is adsorbed on the neighboring active sites (La3+ or Fe4+), then the hydrogen transfer takes place via a concerted six-link intermediate. The function of carbon material to absorb and deliver reactants from solution to the LaFeO3 active sites is a crucial factor to improve the catalytic efficiency of LaFeO3, which provides also a new vista to design catalyst with high catalytic efficiency. To demonstrate the superiority of the LaFeO3@C-M composite, catalytic activity for CTH of furfural over various catalysts was compared, Table S1. Among the simple metal oxides, Fe2O3 is not the best selective hydrogenation catalyst for furfural (entry 1–6, Table S1). Perovskite LaFeO3 by sol-gel method showed limited catalytic activity for CTH reaction due to the low activities of La2O3 and Fe2O3 (entry 5–6 and 15, Table S1). The surface acidity and basicity of LaFeO3 were increased significantly by in-situ carbon template method leading to the better activity for CTH reaction (entry 14, Table S1). The introduction of carbon for CTH reaction is an effective method for the catalytic performance enhancement of Al2O3 and Fe3O4 (entry 12–13, Table S1). As expected, when LaFeO3 was encapsulated with porous carbon, the activity was further increased (entry 16, Table S1), because the presence of carbon can additionally increase the contact efficiency between reactants and catalyst, to accelerate the reaction rate. Even when compared with supported Pd catalyst (2 wt% Pd/Fe2O3, entry 10, Table S1) and the acid/base bifunctional oxide encapsulated catalyst (Al7Zr3@Fe3O4, entry 11, Table S1), the herein reported LaFeO3@C-M catalyst has superior activity for the CTH reaction, alongside with low-cost and simple preparation method. In order to further clarify the activity gap between LaFeO3@C_M and the strong acidic/base catalysts, we listed the reaction conditions and activities in Table S2. The metal oxide catalysts showed good activities for CTH of furfural at a low mass ratio of furfural to catalyst (entry 2–6, Table S2) under mild conditions. However, there was a sharp fall in the furfural conversion and FOL selectivity (entry 7, Table S2) when the mass ratio was doubled. Although the LaFeO3@C-M required an initial reaction pressure of 1 MPa, the corresponding activity was higher than that of Al2O3 at the similar mass ratio of furfural to catalyst (entry 7, Table S2). Therefore, the composite LaFeO3@C_M from maltose synthesized by a facile in-situ method has considerable activity for CTH reaction even close to the strong acidic/base catalysts, such as Al2O3 and MgO."
9,Effect of other reaction conditions over LaFeO3@C-M,"3.4 Effect of other reaction conditions over LaFeO3@C-M Effect of reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst weight on the activity are also investigated to comprehend the reaction, using LaFeO3@C-M as the model catalyst (Fig. S6). The selective hydrogenation activities increase linearly with the catalyst weight, reaction time and temperature. To make further insights into the reaction, the reaction kinetics was investigated. Herein, because the concentration of isopropanol (which is used also as the solvent) is far higher than that of furfural, we consider that the reaction rate is affected mainly by the furfural concentration and the effect of isopropanol concentration can be neglected. On this assumption, the function of ln(Ct/C0) vs. reaction time obtained at different temperatures is plotted and presented in Fig. 6 , wherein C0 and Ct represent the concentration of furfural at reaction time 0 and t (h), respectively. Obviously, the reaction rate constant (k) increases with the reaction temperature, from 0.143 h−1 (120 °C) to 0.230 h−1 (140 °C) and further to 0.333 h-1 (160 °C), supporting that it is an endothermic reaction. The plot of ln(k) vs. 1/T, inserted in Fig. 6, shows that the apparent activation energy (Ea) of reaction is 30.02 kJ mol-1, which is much lower than that obtained from γ-Fe2O3@HAP catalyst (47.69 kJ mol-1) [20]. The activities of LaFeO3@C-M for the CTH of other carbonyl compounds were also investigated, to check its applicability for industrial use. Table 4 shows that LaFeO3@C-M is active for selective hydrogenation of benzaldehyde, cyclohexanone and acetophenone. In particular, the catalyst is exclusive for the CTH of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol, with 99.0 % conversion and 96.4 % selectivity obtained at 180 °C for 3 h. The moderate activity for CTH of cinnamaldehyde could be that the long branched chain hinders its access to the active site due to the steric effect, and the presence of CC double bond results in the formation of byproduct 1-propenyl benzene (Fig. S7). Thus, only 45.4 % conversion and 49.5 % selectivity was observed for the CTH of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol reaction."
10,Reusability of LaFeO3@C-M,"3.5 Reusability of LaFeO3@C-M Fig. 7 shows the reusability of LaFeO3@C-M for CTH of furfural to FOL. A big decrease in the activity was observed for the “dried” catalyst, which was obtained by drying the used LaFeO3@C-M catalyst in air at 100 °C for 1 h. To test if the decrease is due to the covering of active sites, we washed the used catalyst with ethanol for three times to remove any reactants/products adsorbed on the active sites, and then dried in air oven. This “washed + dried” catalyst exhibits improved activity compared to the “dried” catalyst, indicating that the covering of active sites is indeed a reason accounting for the activity decrease. However, as the activity is still not high enough as compared to that of the fresh catalyst, we consider that the simple washing and drying steps are not enough to remove the reactants/products completely from the active sites of the used catalyst. For this reason, we treated the used catalyst under a more severe condition, i.e., calcination at 300 °C in N2 atmosphere. As expected, this “calcined” catalyst regenerates further the activity, and longer treatment time leads to better regenerated activity. This confirms again that the removal of reactants/products adsorbed on the active site is crucial to regenerate the catalyst. Nevertheless, the difference in the activity of the fresh and used catalysts is still big despite of the treatment in N2 atmosphere. The reasons can be the fact that the reactants/products adsorbed on the active sites and that inside the pores of carbon are hard to remove even being treated in N2 atmosphere at 300 °C. The adsorbed reactants/products are carbonized when treated in N2 atmosphere, and these new produced carbon materials would cover again the active sites and/or block the original pores, restraining the reaction. Therefore, a suitable method to remove the adsorbed reactants/products will be a new challenge of this field. To support further the above conclusions, we conducted TGA, N2-isotherms and XPS measurements for the used catalysts and the results were presented in Fig. S8-9. N2 physisorption results show a sharp drop in the N2 adsorption amount and no signal for micropore appears for the used LaFeO3@C-M, suggesting that the pores of carbon was seriously blocked by reactants/products. TGA results demonstrate a weight loss of 37.9 % for the used catalyst, which is higher than the fresh LaFeO3@C-M (33.0 %), this also suggests that a few amount of organics are remained on the used catalyst. As for the XPS measurement (Table S3), the atomic carbon percentage of the used LaFeO3@C-M (69.58 %) is much higher than that of the fresh one (55.37 %), supporting that new carbon containing species were adsorbed on the used catalyst. Thus, it is concluded that a few amounts of reactants/products are adsorbed on the used catalyst, and the deactivation is not due to the destruction of catalyst, but to the covering of active sites."
11,Conclusions,"Carbon encapsulated LaFeO3 composites (LaFeO3@C-x) were synthesized by a facile one-step method using varied carbohydrates as carbon precursors, and the effect of carbohydrates on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performances of LaFeO3@C-x for CTH reactions were investigated. The texture of carbon materials, e.g., the pore structure, surface area and surface oxygen functional groups, and the surface properties of LaFeO3, e.g. molar ratio of La/Fe, Fe4+/Fe3+ and OA/OL, varied with the carbon precursor used, which offers a facile route to tailor the surface properties of LaFeO3@C by simply changing the carbon precursor. Catalytic tests showed that among the precursors investigated, maltose is the most suitable carbon precursor to prepare LaFeO3@C-M for CTH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol reaction, with conversion and selectivity of 93.2 % and 94.1 %, respectively, which can be attributed to the surface La enrichment, rich oxygen functional groups / oxygen vacancy and matched surface acidity-basicity. The apparent activation energy obtained from the LaFeO3@C-M is 30 kJ/mol, which is lower than that obtained from catalysts reported in literature. The LaFeO3@C-M is also active for CTH of other carbonyl compounds, in particular the benzaldehyde. Reusability tests indicated that the refresh of active sites, covered by reactants/products, is the main problem of regenerating the catalyst, which will be a challenging topic in this field in future."
