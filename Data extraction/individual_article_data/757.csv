0,Introduction,
1,Background,"1.1 Background Fossil-based resources, including coal, petroleum and nature gas, provide the majority of chemicals and fuels for the development of human society [1,2]. It is of great significance to look for renewable alternatives to fossil fuels, in consideration that rapidly diminished crude oil and coal resources have led to serious exhaust emission and unfavorable impact on environment. Biomass, known as the most abundant and renewable carbon resources on earth, has drawn worldwide attention in the past decades. Biomass feedstocks can be transformed into value-added chemicals and transportation fuels [3]. Therefore, catalytic conversion of biomass is regarded as one of the most promising approaches to solve existing issues on energy shortage and environmental pollution [4]. Lignocellulosic biomass, widely distributed with agricultural waste, is the most abundantly available biomass resource and could be produced in large quantities per year [5]. It consists of cellulose (30–45%), hemicellulose (25–35%) and lignin (20–45%) [6]. Converting lignocellulose into renewable chemicals is the key step to achieve the above prospect. Levulinic acid (LA) is a promising biomass platform molecule produced from the conversion of cellulose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, Scheme 1 (a)) [3,6–9]. It has been widely served as fuel additive, plasticizer, spice as well as precursor in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, LA exhibits great potential as an excellent precursor for the production of various industrially relevant intermediates, including γ-valerolactone (GVL), 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO), valeric acid (VA) and alkyl valerates, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), pyrrolidinones, etc. [3,10–12] Actually LA esters, directly produced from hemicellulose in alcohol solvents with furfural and furfuryl alcohol as intermediates or derived from LA (Scheme 1(a)), process similar chemical properties to LA, so they have been extensively investigated as well [3,13]."
2,LA and derivatives,"1.2 LA and derivatives 1.2.1 LA to GVL In fact, all those products mentioned above involve hydrogenation of LA and its esters to GVL as key conversion step (Scheme 1 (b)) [14]. Thus, hydrogenation of LA to GVL plays a pivotal role. GVL is regarded as one of the most outstanding biomass-derived chemicals on account of its benign physiochemical properties and versatile functions [15–18]. In general, GVL can be synthesized by hydrogenation of LA through the following two reaction pathways (Scheme 1 (b)): (1) dehydration of LA to angelica lactone followed by hydrogenation process to GVL (pathway 1 in Scheme 1 (b)), and (2) an unstable intermediate γ-hydroxyvaleric acid is formed by hydrogenation of the ketone group in LA, and then cascade dehydration and intramolecular esterification leads to the formation of GVL [19]. 1.2.2 LA to others Further hydrogenation of GVL could yield other value-added chemicals. Known as “valeric biofuels”, VA and alkyl valerates are important LA derivatives owing to appropriate energy densities and polarities [2,3]. It is proved that alkyl valerates can be used as main fuel additives for gasoline and diesel, showing better fuel performances than ethanol (EtOH) [20]. Previous work of catalyst design mainly focused on Pt, [20,21] Pd, [22–24] Ru, [25–27], Cu, [28–30] Ni, [31,32] Co, [33,34] etc. In addition, 1,4-PDO is a versatile C5 diol used as organic solvents, fragrances, lubricants, polymers and medicines [2,3]. Numerous work has been published to show that several catalysts can produce 1,4-PDO as main product, [13,15] including homogeneous Ru-, [35–38] Fe-, [39] Co-based [40] catalysts and heterogeneous metallic Cu [41–43] and bimetallic RuRe, [44] MoIr, [45] CuCo [46] catalysts, etc. 2-MTHF can be obtained from GVL or 1,4-PDO [47]. Blending 2-MTHF with gasoline could promote excellent fuel performances with 2-MTHF content up to 60% (v/v) [48]. Cu-based catalysts [10,49–53] present excellent performances while other promising candidates include Ru-, [35,54,55] Pt-, [56] Ni-based [57] catalysts."
3,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation: the scope of this review,"1.3 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation: the scope of this review It is well established that, traditional hydrogenation processes using pressurized H2 are usually conducted under harsh temperatures (>150 °C) or pressures (>3 MPa). The use of H2, still derived from fossil fuels, makes biomass conversion costly and unsustainable [58]. In contrast, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) without external H2 display both technological and economic advantages, since the reaction is conducted under milder conditions with inexpensive H-donors (alcohols, acids and hydrazine) leading to safer operation environment, better atomic economy and low capital investment (Scheme 2 ) [8,59–61]. Formic acid (FA) and alcohols are typically selected as H-donors in CTH of LA. FA is formed as a major co-product in the production of LA. Therefore, using FA directly as an H-donor instead of removing it could be more atomic and energy economical [62,63]. When alcohol compounds are chosen as H-donors, the nature of CTH of LA usually belongs to the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction, which is an exceptional approach to realizing the hydrogenation of keto C=O groups with high chemoselectivity in the presence of other functional groups [3]. Significantly, using alcohol as an H-donor in place of H2 and conducting under mild reaction conditions make this process environment-friendly and cost-effective [19,64]. Compared with homogeneous catalysts (e.g. aluminum or titanium alkoxide), heterogeneous catalysts for the MPV reaction are more widely studied, including metal oxides, zeolites and metal organic framework (MOFs) [65–69]. In fact, the mechanism of MPV reaction is forming a six-membered transition state achieved by the synergy of acidic and basic active species in catalyst, which leads to the formation of corresponding alcohol and ketone (e.g. isopropanol (IPA) as an H-donor is transformed into acetone in Scheme 3 ) [70–73]. Many reports have shown that noble metal catalyst are highly active for CTH reactions, high price and rare existence of noble metal resources however, prevent technological implementation in future bio-refineries [74,75]. As far as we know, it is found that many non-noble metal catalysts also exhibit good performances for catalytic hydrogenation of LA. Recent reviews have been focused on catalyst performances of noble and non-noble catalysts [2,13,19,76]. There is lack of systematic summary on the rational design of non-noble metal catalysts with regard to tunable Brønsted/Lewis acidity [77]. Therefore, in this review we mainly focus on CTH of LA and its esters to GVL over inexpensive materials and summarize the structural, acid-base sites, interaction characteristics of catalysts and reaction mechanism. The review is shown as followed in Scheme 4 ."
4,CTH of LA ester using alcohols as H-donors,
5,Zr-based hybridized nanocomposites,"2.1 Zr-based hybridized nanocomposites Zr-based nanostructured materials are among the most popular candidates for CTH of LA using alcohols as H-donors. Various types of Zr-based materials, including ZrO2, [78–80,85] supported Zr oxides, [82,83,86] ZrP, [91,93,94] immobilized homogeneous Zr complexes and Zr-based organic frameworks [65–68,98–100,106], exhibit excellent transfer hydrogenation activity in LA conversion. 2.1.1 ZrO2 catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation ZrO2-based catalysts include ZrO2 (Entries#1 - #4 in Table 1 ) and supported ZrO2 (Entries#5 - #9 in Table 1), which are generally prepared through precipitation or in-situ hydrolysis method. In a synthesis process, usually ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O, ZrOCl2·8H2O and n-butoxide (Zr(OnBu)4) are chosen as precursors. XRD patterns show that ZrO2 could exist as amorphous, monoclinic, tetragonal or mixed phases. Thus it can be known that crystalline phase is not the key factor determining catalytic performances. However, catalysts contained Lewis acid/base sites and high surface area (120–900 m2 g−1) have been found to be critical in catalytic activity. (2) Catalytic performance Initial efforts were primarily focused on preparing ZrO2 catalysts using various wet chemical synthetic approaches [78–80,85]. For example, Tabanelli and Mauriello et al. [80] studied tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts in the conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) with 27% of GVL yields in EtOH medium. Under continuous gas-flow conditions, 75% of GVL yield was obtained using tetragonal ZrO2 catalyst. Kuwahara et al. [85] demonstrated that amorphous ZrO2 catalysts supported on high-surface-area silica are more active and reusable in CTH of LA and its esters to GVL and achieved 88% GVL yield with 98% methyl levulinate (ML) conversion at 150 °C in IPA. A series of metal hydroxides were examined as catalysts in the synthesis of GVL from EL by Sun and Lin [89]. Among these catalysts, amorphous ZrO(OH)2·xH2O was found to be most active. EL conversion of 93.6% and GVL selectivity of 94.5% were achieved when IPA was used as an H-donor at 200 °C with a reaction time of only 1 h. In another study, Luque and Pineda et al. [84] investigated highly dispersed ZrO2/Si-SBA-15 catalysts for continuous ML hydrogenation to GVL in IPA medium and obtained 89% ML conversion and 100% GVL selectivity at 200 °C. Huang et al. [90] reported a mesoporous Zr/SBA-15 catalyst through in-situ sol-gel method, offering 99% yield of GVL at 160 °C. Mechanistic studies revealed that the interaction of polar C=O bonds was key to the reaction efficiency, while poisoning experiments confirmed the existence of acid-base sites for transfer hydrogenation process. Zeolite dispersed ZrO2 catalysts display tunable acidity due to the presence of large amounts of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Luque and Pineda et al. [84] studied the ML conversion to GVL in IPA at 200 °C using various ZrO2 catalysts including ZrO2, ZrO2/SBA-15 and ZrO2/Si-SBA-15. The material ZrO2/Si-SBA-15 synthesized by impregnation owns higher Lewis acidity, which is relate to a better accessibility of the active sites by probe molecules. Through tuning the strength of Lewis acid, LA can be converted into GVL with high selectivity (>89%) and conversion (100%). The electronic nature of Zr4+ centers and cation dispersion on mesoporous structures is the primary focus in most studies. Limited work is reported on local lattice structures of –O–Zr4+–O– and possible electronic reconfiguration due to isolated Zr4+ sites within silica framework. Kuwahara and Yamashita et al. [83] prepared a series of ZrO2/SBA-15 catalysts for conversion of LA and its esters to GVL using several alcohols as H-donors. The highly-dispersed Zr4+-oxide species with low-coordination geometry is the dominant active species and convert ML to GVL with 95% yield at 150 °C in IPA. ZrO2/SBA-15 materials exhibited well-defined diffraction planes associated with 2D hexagonal mesoporous structure and Zr species is existing as highly-dispersed Zr species or as amorphous zirconia. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was confirmed by TEM images (Fig. 1 (a, b)). Zr species are dominantly deposited inside the pore channels with uniform distribution at lower ZrO2 loading levels, but introduction of an excess amount of Zr (>35 wt%) leads to a formation of extra-framework aggregated ZrO2 particles. Other ZrO2 nanocomposites have also been reported for tunable surface properties. A microspheric Ti–Zr porous oxides has been developed by Yang and colleagues [103]. They used IPA as an H-donor and solvent to produce GVL from EL via MPV reduction. A GVL yield of 90.1% was achieved at 180 °C. The mixed metal oxides show amorphous porous structure (Fig. 1 (c)). It is clear that Zr species can be well distributed within the microspheres of nanocomposites. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the present of Lewis and Brønsted acids, which were enhanced with the introduction of Ti species. In another study, Fang et al. [104] found that Ni–Zr oxides prepared by co-precipitation method and their partially reduced counterparts were efficient for GVL production (yield: 95.2%, at 200 °C in IPA). Introducing an additional metal oxide (e.g., CuO, ZnO, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and NiO) in combination with ZrO2 result in increased acidity and basicity, leading to high formation rates (up to 54.9 mmol g−1 h−1). Similar results were also found by Fang et al. [88] with magnetic acid-base bifunctionalized FeZrOx nanocatalysts giving GVL in yield of 87.2% at 230 °C in 3 h. Hybridizing ZrO2 with other inorganic materials is also considered as effective methodology for exposing active sites to catalytic reactions. Liu et al. [82] reported ZrO2/GO (graphene oxide) catalyst, which can be simply prepared via the hydrothermal treatment of ZrOCl2·8H2O in the presence of GO. Fig. 1 (d, e) shows ZrO2 particles are almost in an oval morphology. A full conversion of EL and a high selectivity of GVL of 94.8% were obtained at the reaction temperature of 180 °C. Kinetic studies indicated that hydrogenation of EL into GVL was sensitive to the reaction temperature with activation energy of 47.69 kJ mol−1, via a tandem MPV reduction and cyclization/lactonization mechanism. There exists a strong interaction between ZrO2 particles and the support, which should be possibly derived by the interaction between hydroxyl group and carboxylic acid groups on the surface of the GO and the ZrO2 particles. High surface area of GO seems to play a key role in dispersing ZrO2 sites. A series of mesoporous acid-base bifunctional Zr–B mixed oxides with different molar ratios were prepared by Yang et al. [131] using a sol-gel method, and developed for conversion of EL to GVL by using alcohol as H-source. A high GVL yield of 88.5% with 95.1% conversion of EL was achieved at 200 °C. This catalyst show amorphous morphologies (Fig. 1 (f, g)) and with exclusively Lewis acidic sites. The electronic donating effect by boron oxide seems to be key for synergistic performances. 2.1.2 Zirconium phosphate catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Zr phosphate catalysts, as seen in Entries#14 - #20 in Table 1, generally synthesized by the precipitation method using ZrOCl2·8H2O and phosphate. Zr species exhibit amorphous phase or low crystallinity. The good catalytic performance is mainly ascribed to Lewis acid sites from Zr element and Lewis basic sites from phosphate groups. On one hand, higher Lewis acidity of Zr is beneficial to activation of carbonyl groups and thus increasing the total reaction rate. On the other hand, higher basicity is favorable for the dissociation of hydroxyl groups in alcohol occurring through activation by basic sites (O2−) with the aid of Lewis acid sites (Zr4+), thus increasing the hydrogenation rate via MPV mechanism. (2) Catalytic performance Phosphate promoted cationic active centers are known to be active for many catalytic reactions [91–94,96,97]. To alter the nature of active centers, some efforts have been put to manipulate the morphologies of phosphate nanocomposites. A series of amorphous zirconium phosphate catalysts (ZrPO) were developed by Long and Li et al. [91] for conversion of levulinate esters to GVL using IPA as an H-donor. Experimental results show that 98.1% butyl levulinate (BL) conversion and 95.7% GVL yield can be achieved at 210 °C. FT-IR suggested that the catalysts are a mixture of phosphate, polyphosphate and hydrophosphates. But P:Zr ratio has a significant effect on Brønsted acid sites, while its influence on Lewis acid sites is negligible. Lewis acid sites dominate the MPV reduction, while the basic sites are auxiliary in ZrPO promoted reactions. But Brønsted acid sites play a crucial role to enhance the conversion of 4-hydroxypentanoate (4-HPE) to GVL. Therefore, it is clear the co-existence of both acidic and basic sites are key for synergistic transfer hydrogenation over ZrPO catalysts. In another study, Wang et al. [95] also synthesized a novel amorphous zirconium trimetaphosphate (Zr-TMPA, Fig. 2 (a)) for CTH of EL to GVL using IPA as an H-donor and solvent. 96.2% GVL yield and 100% EL conversion were achieved at 160 °C. SEM images show that the gaps between the aggregated particles result to high porosity. For reaction mechanism, it is possible that the carbonyl group in LA can be activated by Zr4+-O2- species through a six-member structure as key intermediate. The same group also reported an amorphous porous Zr containing inorganic pyrophosphate catalyst (ZrOPP) [92]. Yield of 94% GVL was achieved at 160 °C after 11 h of batch time. SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2(b), demonstrate that the catalyst consisted of conglomerated particles to form a laminated structure and had no uniform shape. The role of basic sites on catalytic performances are still under debate. It is possible that tunable Zr–O–P bonding also leads to similar six-member ring mechanism. They also designed a series of amorphous organic zirconium phosphonate catalysts by a simple co-precipitation method. The catalysts were tested for EL to GVL in IPA with 92% GVL yield and 99% EL conversion at 160 °C [93]. The results demonstrated that the number of acid sites and basic sites between the layers of the catalysts play very important roles in promoting the conversion of EL to GVL and that the functional groups that exist in phosphates could regulate the number of acid and basic sites. This work provides important information on the formation mechanism of amorphous structures of zirconium phosphonate. Amorphous inorganic zirconium phosphonate is possibly generated via random growth of zirconium phosphonate facets on the existing cores in aqueous phase. The difference in the nature of acidic and basic sites demands further investigation, particularly on their role in promoting H transfer reactions. Li and Yang et al. [96] developed a facile solvothermal approach for the preparation of an amorphous acid-base bifunctional hybrid BPhZr from the assembly of zirconium with diphosphonic acid as ligand. It was demonstrated to positively promote the conversion of EL to GVL up to 95% yield at 160 °C in IPA with TOF value of 3.2 h−1. BPhZr was synthesized under solvothermal conditions and have both Lewis and Brønsted acidic centers in higher density, but with relatively lower basicity (Figure S1). A good spatial arrangement of P, C, O and Zr was observed for BPhZr, indicating the homogenous dispersion and thereby having connectivity between Zr4+ and -PO3 2- moieties throughout the network (Figure S2). This could intrinsically promote the formation of acid-base bifunctionalized sites in the catalysts. In addition to co-precipitation and solvothermal approaches, other preparation methods were also documented for transfer hydrogenation of levulinate esters. Song and Han et al. [94] developed a new porous zirconium phosphonate (Zr-PhyA), which was prepared by the reaction of ZrCl4 and phosphonate (Fig. 2(d)). Both the Lewis-acidic Zr element and the Lewis-basic phosphate groups contribute significantly to the excellent catalytic performance (GVL yield = 96.7%). Although the above-mentioned investigations have all shown that acid-base bifunctional nature leads to the formation of mesoporosity, the advantages of such morphologies, however, is still under debate. Fang et al. [97] developed a facile and effective approach to prepare a series of orderly layered and mesoporous zirconium phosphonate by simply reacting ZrCl4 with different xylylenediphosphonic acids. The resulting PhPZr (PhP: xylylenediphosphonic) nano-hybrids show outstanding performances for CTH of EL to GVL with 100% EL conversion, 98% GVL selectivity and 8.6 h−1 of TOF values at 160 °C. Compared with other zirconium phosphonate catalysts, the proposed candidate in this work shows highly ordered interlayers, whereas a larger amount of plate-like particles are bonded together, thus exhibiting no regular layer distribution (Fig. 2(e)). Deuterium-labeling experiments confirm that the CTH reaction proceeds through direct intermolecular hydrogen transfer, rather than the metal hydride route. 2.1.3 Other organic Zr-based catalysts Compared with conventional inorganic ZrO2 catalytic materials, organic Zr-containing catalysts (Entries#21 - #34 in Table 1), such as MOFs and immobilized homogeneous Zr species, often show advantages such as well-defined active sites and large surface area (1000–1200 m2 g−1). But there are only a few studies documented in this area. Wang et al. [102] studied novel heterogeneous Zr-containing organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of EL to GVL with IPA. A GVL yield of 96.5% with 99% EL conversion was obtained using amorphous Zr-Pg (phloroglucinol), which was prepared by the reaction of ZrCl4 and Pg in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature. Zr-Pg also have both acidic and the basic sites. Similar to amorphous Zr–P catalysts, Zr-Pg materials display layered structures and 3D orientation as more layers are packed for mesoporous mophologies (Fig. 3 (a)). But the strong basicity of Zr-Pg mainly resulted from the phenate groups, which could be helpful for the dissociation of IPA to H and alkoxide. Wang et al. [101] designed new porous Zr-catalyst containing phenate and aniline groups, Zr(Salphen)/MCM-41. As illustrated in Fig. 3(b), these mesoporous silica materials were likely spherical, but the surface of the functionalized mesoporous molecular sieves has been changed (Figure S3). Organic Zr catalysts could be next promising candidates to replace inorganic ZrO2 and zirconium phosphonate materials due to well-defined structures and cationic centers of Zr4+. Future efforts need to be paid to understand possible interaction between acidic and basic sites and the electronic withdrawing/donating effect from solid supports. Wang and Zhang et al. [123] synthesized porous MOFs of Zr- and Hf-based DUT67 by the solvothermal method for CTH reaction of EL to produce GVL using IPA as an H-donor and solvent. 63.3% conversion of EL and 45.3% yield of GVL were achieved under catalysis of Zr-DUT67 at 160 °C. Better catalytic activity of DUT67 can be attributed to that 8-connected metal nodes are coordinatively unsaturated and appears to be easily accessible catalytically active sites. SEM image (Fig. 3(c)) shows that the particles of Zr-DUT67 adopt a truncated octahedral morphology with smooth outer surface. Park et al. [100] studied a series of DUT catalysts which were synthesized and used as heterogeneous catalysts for the CTH of EL to produce GVL using IPA as an H-donor. A high GVL yield of 94% with >99% selectivity was obtained at 160 °C over Zr-DUT52 catalyst (Fig. 3(d)). It is found that the 12-connected 3D Zr-DUT52 catalysts, which had the highest BET surface area of 1208 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.49 cm3 g−1, exhibited superior CTH activity to those of the eight-connected 2D Hf-DUT53 and six-connected Zr-DUT84 catalysts. Yamashita et al. [11] designed sulfonic acid functionalized UiO-66 catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by the solvothermal method. A high GVL yield was attained from ML by increasing the content of sulfoterephthalic acid linkers with a maximum GVL yield of 85% over UiO-66 at 140 °C in 2-butanol (2-BuOH), which was due to the cooperative effect between Lewis-basic Zr oxo clusters and Brønsted-acidic –SO3H groups uniformly arranged in a confined nanospace of UiO-66 (Figure S4), where each Zr oxo cluster is 12-fold connected to adjacent clusters through a BDC linker, resulting in a highly packed fcc structure. Hwang et al. [99] studied a series of crystalline porous Zr-MOFs, which were synthesized by the reflux method. The maximum yield of GVL (up to 92.7%) was achieved at 200 °C with Zr–UiO–66 (Fig. 4 , surface area: 1046 m2 g−1). UiO-66 (Zr) catalysts were successfully synthesized via solvothermal method by Ouyang and Luque et al. [98] and employed in the transformation of ML to GVL in IPA under continuous flow, which gave >99% ML conversion and 96% GVL selectivity at 240 °C with the productivity of 29.9 mmol GVL g−1 h−1. Zr4+–O2- acid-base pair sites located in the Zr oxo clusters are uniformly embedded in the porous framework with high surface area (Scheme S1), boosting the reaction with efficient reagent diffusion as well as easily accessible active sites. Moreover, the esterification reaction can also benefit from the Brønsted acidity of the μ3-OH groups and organic linker defect sites, promoting the cyclization step in the GVL production. For MOFs materials, the nature of acidic and basic sites in catalyzing tandem hydrogenation reactions have not been fully understood. Most attention is still focused on morphological control. Therefore, future efforts need to be put on fundamental understanding on the role of surface Brønsted acidity at defected sites on enhanced catalytic C–H and C=O bond activation. Xue and Mu et al. [109] studied a new porous zirconium-cyanuric acid (Zr-CA) coordination polymer, which has been designed by the reaction of ZrCl4 and cyanuric acid. 98.9% GVL yield and 100% EL conversion achieved at 150 °C. There were large amounts of acidic sites (originating from Zr4+) and basic sites (resulting from O2− in the phenate groups and pyridinic type N atoms) in Zr-CA. The porous Zr-CA catalyst was amorphous and had no uniform shape (Figure S5). Zhou and Liu et al. [108] studied a novel Zr-containing catalyst (Zr-HA) based on humic acids (HAs), which has been synthesized and proved to be highly efficient for the conversion of EL to GVL via MPV reaction. A novel approach to construct Zr-based catalysts using lignite as raw materials was proposed by Zhou and Liu et al. [110] Both humic acids (HA) extracted from lignite and the solid residues (SR) after HA extraction could be used for preparing the catalysts, which were found to be highly efficient for the conversion of EL into GVL with the selectivity higher than 90% at 150 °C in IPA for 7–9 h. 2.1.4 Summary ZrO2-based catalysts exhibit various crystalline phase, including amorphous, monoclinic, tetragonal or mixed phases, which is not the decisive factor for catalytic performance however. The excellent activity is attributed to the present of Lewis acid/base sites and high surface area. In addition, high active sites dispersion in supported ZrO2 catalysts could also play an important role. For Zr phosphate catalysts, the higher Lewis acidity from Zr element is beneficial to activating the carbonyl groups and higher basicity from phosphate groups is favorable for the dissociation of the hydroxyl groups in alcohol to increase the hydrogenation rate. And there is generally huge surface area (>1000 m2 g−1) in organic Zr-containing catalysts like MOFs which could provide much more active sites."
6,Cu-based nanocatalysts,"2.2 Cu-based nanocatalysts Cu-based catalysts have been extensively for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions [132–134]. For transfer hydrogenation reactions, Cu-support interaction is the central focus for tunable morphologies. The electronic properties are however, unclear and still lack of detailed investigations. 2.2.1 Supported Cu catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Supported Cu catalysts (Entries#36 - #39 in Table 1) are prepared by the co-precipitation method using Cu(NO3)2·6H2O and other metal nitrate. Compared with Zr-based catalysts, surface area of supported Cu catalysts is smaller (35–55 m2 g−1). The metallic Cu species and good dispersion lead to excellent catalytic activity and cycle stability. (2) Catalytic performance Tian et al. [42] designed Cu/ZrO2 catalyst using the co-precipitation method and obtained yields of 75% GVL, 39% 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) and 13.8% 1-pentanol (1-PAO) from ML in IPA at 200 °C. The catalyst possesses the most abundant acidic sites and more acid content. The rich acidic sites and acid content in the Cu-containing catalysts have a high promotion on the hydrogenolysis mechanism of lactone and some categories of esters. The same research group also reported Cu/ZrOCO3 catalysts for conversion of ML in one pot providing 90% GVL yield at 180 °C in IPA [112]. The strong Cu–Zr interaction results in the generation of Cu/Cu+ within ZrOCO3 framework. The existence of Cu+ contributes to conversion of GVL into 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO). In the CTH reaction, Cu2(OH)2CO3 in the catalyst is reduced to Cu and Cu2O. Such evolution of Cu oxidation state also results in a pore-rich structure (Figure S6). After one reaction, the fact that the specific surface area of the in-situ reduced Cu/ZrOCO3 became large was caused by reduction of Cu2(OH)2CO3 in the catalyst to metallic Cu, which is advantageous for enhancing catalytic activity. Tian and colleagues also proposed a one-step strategy for catalyst preparation of Cu nanocatalysts. The nanostructured Cu/AlOOH catalyst prepared by in-situ reduction of Cu2(OH)2CO3/AlOOH [114]. The optimal reaction condition for GVL is 180 °C using the in-situ reduced Cu2(OH)2CO3/AlOOH catalyst with Cu:Al molar ratio 3:1 (96% conversion of ML and 90% yield of GVL). The catalysts have a rich pore structure. XPS analysis further proved that Cu2+ species were reduced to Cu or Cu+ species after CTH reactions. Huo and Jin et al. [113] developed an effective ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) catalyst by co-precipitation method for CTH process of EL to GVL, giving a 99.0% yield of GVL with IPA as an H-donor at 140 °C for 2 h. Only the diffraction peaks of Cu were detectable when the Al2O3 was put together with Cu and ZnO as a composition of the CZA catalysts, which suggested that the addition of Al2O3 might increase the dispersion of ZnO and reduce its crystallinity. Moreover, CTH activity was significantly affected by CZA catalysts with different calcination temperatures, which had different morphological structures. The surface properties and the active phase dispersion directly influenced catalytic performance. High calcination temperature resulted in sintering and recrystallization of Cu and the collapse of porous structure, leading to poor activity. Clearly, metal oxides provide both acid and base sites for Cu species. The strong electronic interaction prevent reduction of Cu2+ to metallic phase. The experimental studies share similar observation with previous work on Cu catalyst design for other hydrogenation reactions. Cu+-support interaction induced morphological evolution also need further attention. 2.2.2 Mixed Cu oxide catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation There are many synthesis methods for mixed Cu oxide catalysts (Entries#40 - #43 in Table 1) including thermal decomposition of metal nitrate salts, incipient impregnation and precipitation method. Cu and other metals usually exist in alloy form, such as Cu–Ni alloy. Hybridizing CuO with other oxides often show synergistic performances. Different from supported Cu system, bimetal oxides and bimetallic catalysts such as Cu–Ni and Cu–Cr catalysts show dual-site behaviors for conversion of LA ester. (2) Catalytic performance Pan and Huang et al. [116] reported a Cu–Ni bimetallic catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of EL to GVL, providing the highest GVL yield of 97% by using 2-BuOH as an H-donor at 150 °C. Characterization of the fresh and spent catalyst showed that the synergy between Cu and Ni is key for the high stability and reactivity of the bimetallic catalyst. They believed that secondary alcohol was first absorbed on the surface of the catalyst and formed alkoxide species by dissociation its O–H bond. The alkoxide species subsequently underwent β-hydride elimination to form metal hydride species and release the side product (e.g., acetone if using IPA). The unsaturated C=O bond of EL was then hydrogenated by the active metal hydride species to yield 4-HPE, which finally underwent intramolecular cyclization and formed GVL. The presence of Cu could lower the reduction temperature of Ni species in the bimetallic Cu–Ni catalysts and provided more reduced Ni sites. Similarly, oxidation states of Cu and Ni are also critical for catalytic performances. For example, Kuboona et al. [115] CuNiO catalysts prepared by thermal decomposition of metal nitrate salts showed potential performance for ∼100% selectivity GVL with full conversion of ML in the IPA system at 200 °C. CuNiO showed the highest acidity compared with other mixed metal oxide catalysts while the acidity could be doubled after the reduction of CuNiO to form CuNi alloy. Li et al. [117] developed new hierarchical multi-level supported bimetallic Ni–Cu catalysts (Fig. 5 (a and b)) via a flower-like Al2O3@NiCuAl-LDH precursor route, which had highly porous superstructure. Such superstructure can facilitate substrates to easily get access to more fully surface active sites, thus greatly improving the catalytic performance. Sun and Lin et al. [111] developed a nano-Cu catalyst, which was prepared in-situ by the reduction of CuO in methanol (MeOH) and played a dual role in H2 production by MeOH reforming and the subsequent hydrogenation of ML to GVL. The in-situ formed nanocopper catalyst displayed a satisfactory robustness against humins produced during the acid-catalyzed methanolysis of cellulose. Metal-metal interaction also leads to tunable formation of Cu+ species in bimetallic catalysts. Zeng and Lin et al. [118] reported an atom-economical synthesis of GVL from ML with an extremely low amount of initial MeOH input (29 mol% of ML) as the in-situ hydrogen source over a Cu–Cr catalyst, which ensured a complete ML conversion and GVL yield of 89.8% at 250 °C. Cu nano-particles dispersed on the surface of a catalyst after in-situ activation (Fig. 5(c)). XRD spectra showed that CuO in the catalyst was reduced to Cu2O and Cu during the reaction (Figure S7). Besides, no Cu2+ was detected for the used Cu–Cr catalyst in XPS spectra but Cu0 and Cu+ species was found. It seems that Cu–Cr interaction leads to the formation of layered structures with 3D orientation. 2.2.3 Summary The metallic Cu species and good dispersion lead to good catalytic activity in supported Cu catalysts. It is found that Cu0 species is favorable to the hydrogenation process. And the strong interaction between Cu and oxide support, such as ZrO2 and Al2O3, make the catalysts more stable. Similarly, Cu and other metals usually exist in alloy form in mixed Cu oxide catalysts. The synergistic effect between Cu and another metal, such as Ni and Cr, often show excellent cascade hydrogenation activity in CTH of LA using alcohol as an H-donor."
7,Other nanostructured catalysts,"2.3 Other nanostructured catalysts Except to Zr– and Cu–based catalysts, there are also several investigation in Hf metal (Entries#46 - #53 in Table 1). Hf–based catalysts often exhibit amorphous phase and thus have many defects or irregular connectivities. Lewis acid and base sites were found to play a synergistic role in the hydrogenation step, while Brønsted acid species improved the adsorption of the substrate and the lactonization step. Song and Han et al. [121] designed an Hf-containing organic-inorganic hybrid catalyst, denoted as Hf-ATMP, giving 95% EL conversion and 86% GVL yield at 150 °C. Hf-ATMP had low crystallinity or was poorly ordered with many defects (Fig. 6 (a and b)). Li et al. [124] synthesized a hierarchically structured Hf-USY zeolite (Fig. 6(c, d and e)) via a two-step post-synthetic strategy, including the controlled dealumination of USY and the dry impregnation of the Cp2HfCl2 precursor. The author studied the mechanism of Hf incorporation, chemical states of Hf species and acidic properties of Hf-USY zeolites. Then Hf-USY zeolite was used in CTH of EL in IPA and obtained 88.3% GVL yield and 95.1% EL conversion at 120 °C for 8 h. García and Corma et al. [125] demonstrated that Hf-based MOFs exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the MPV reaction toward formation of valuable alcohols in high yields from biomass-based carbonyl compounds via direct hydrogen transfer. Fang et al. [126] found that simple assembly of biomass-derived FDCA with Hf under template-free conditions gave a new porous and acid-base bifunctional FDCA-Hf hybrid. FDCA-Hf exhibited excellent activity (98% GVL yield, 2.28 h−1 of TOF value) in the conversion of EL to GVL in IPA at 160 °C. The FDCA-Hf hybrid was formed in porous surface. FT-IR indicated the present of weak Brønsted acid sites (Figure S8). The hybrid was amorphous, further affirming the presence of defects or irregular connectivity. Li and Yang et al. [122] designed a stable Hf-containing acid-base bifunctional solid catalyst, in the form of organic phosphonate-hafnium solid catalyst (PPOA-Hf). Acid and base sites were found to play a synergistic role in the hydrogenation step, while Brønsted acid species improved the adsorption of the substrate and the lactonization step, thus efficiently promoting the cascade reaction. PY-IR spectra (Figure S9) showed the present of Lewis acid sites weak Brønsted acid sites in PPOA-Hf. XRD analyses show that PPOA-Hf does not have a highly crystalline nature. Guo and Fu et al. [119] reported RANEY® Ni catalysts for >99% of GVL. Surface studies on the poisoning effect of primary alcohols on Ni (111) and Ni (100) surfaces revealed that the adsorption of MeOH or EtOH involves the cleavage of the O–H bond and generates a surface alkoxy group which would block the RANEY® Ni surface. In contrast, the secondary alcohols are easily undergoing the β-H elimination step after the generation of an alkoxy group on the Ni surface. During the elimination process, a ketone molecule was released and two H-atoms remained on the Ni surface which were the active species for transfer hydrogenation. After hydrogenation, the RANEY® Ni catalyst regenerated (Scheme S2). Rinaldi et al. [120] utilized RANEY® Ni to convert alkyl levulinates and obtained 94% yield of GVL at 120 °C in IPA. A process concept based on the current results was also proposed, which provides a comprehensive overview of the practical possibilities of this process as part of the lignocellulose-based biorefineries."
8,Mechanistic studies,"2.4 Mechanistic studies 2.4.1 Plausible mechanism over Zr-based catalysts Zr-based catalysts are strongly believed to facilitate transfer hydrogenation reactions through MPV mechanism via forming six-member ring as key intermediate (see Schemes 5–7 ) [83,91,123]. The bifunctional nature of Zr4+-O2- pair coordinately interact with ketone group in LA molecules to initiate catalytic cycles. Kuwahara and colleagues’ work, [83] as shown in Scheme 5, found that, first step is the interaction of alcohol with the Zr-related acid-base site (unsaturated Zr4+-O2−pairs), where alcohol is adsorbed on the basic Zr site (Zr–OH species) and dissociated to form the corresponding Zr-bound alkoxide (Step 1) [83]. The carbonyl group of levulinate ester is then coordinated to the Zr site, probably due to the electrostatic interaction between electron-rich O atoms in the ketone group and the electron-deficient Zr-related Lewis acid site, while this is not a rate-determining step, and subsequently forms a six-membered-ring transition state (Step 2). The-hydride of the Zr-bound alkoxide attacks the carbonyl group of levulinate ester to yield Zr-bound 4-HPE species and new carbonyl compound corresponding to the alcohol (Step 3). Subsequently, the carbonyl byproduct is released (Step 4) and the Zr-bound 4-HPE species are displaced by another alcohol to regenerate the Zr-bound alkoxide species (Step 5), thus the catalytic cycle is completed. According to literature (Schemes 7 and 8 ), phosphate promoted Zr and Zr-MOFs show similar mechanism for activation of H-donors such as IPA. Basic Zr carbonates are found to be efficient catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of LA and its esters to GVL using IPA as both the solvent and H-donor via the cascade process of MPV reduction and lactonization reaction by Long and Li et al. [105] The cooperation effect between acid (Mn+) and base (-OH) sites (basic zirconium carbonate) facilitates the highly selective formation of GVL under relatively mild conditions. Cu+ can be used as a Lewis acid to adsorb and activate C=O groups through the electron lone pairs of oxygen atoms. And the alcohol can be excited to form activated metal hydrides on the active surface of Cu0, and then attack the activated C=O groups to form O–H groups. Besides, as an amphoteric substance, ZrOCO3 has Lewis acid-base sites, which can also promote hydrogen transfer via a six-membered-ring intermediate, without forming a metal hydride. Therefore, there are two different hydrogen transfer paths in the reaction (Scheme 8(a) and 8(b)) [112]. For Scheme 8(a), ML and IPA form six-membered-ring intermediate through the acid-base site to achieve direct hydrogen transfer. For Scheme 8(b), IPA is first activated by metal Cu0 to form metal hydrogen, and then metal hydrogen attacks the C=O functional group of ML activated by Lewis acid. Under CTH conditions, alkyl levulinates (R = CH3, CH2CH3) undergo a series of reactions (Scheme S3): (i) carbonyl CTH hydrogenation resulting in B, which rapidly undergoes cyclization to GVL, and (ii) transesterification leading to D. At the same time, GVL can also be formed via the CTH of α- and β-angelica lactones (the latter being formed by the cyclization of alkyl levulinates) which, in turn, may undergo alcoholysis leading to D. Formation of D and E from angelica lactones was confirmed by allowing the β-angelica lactone to react with different alcoholic solvents. F–H were formed in only minor amounts. The different peculiarities of H-donor/solvent alcohols (MeOH, EtOH, and 2-PrOH) explain the different amounts of products formed. Again, EL accepts the H from the dissociation of IPA to form 4-HPE via the formation of a six-membered transition (see Scheme 9 ). Meanwhile, six-membered-ring transition state via Brønsted acid (–OH)–catalyzed intramolecular dealcoholization can be converted to GVL as the reported GVL formation processes. Thus, the –OH groups present in the framework of Zr-Pg play a critical role in the selection of GVL. There are numerous Lewis acid sites and basic sites existing in the catalyst, which are propitious to CTH reactions. The acid sites mainly stemmed from the zirconium atoms and the basic sites mostly originated from oxygen atoms in the pyrophosphate groups. As shown in Scheme 10 . Firstly, the interaction between acid-base sites in the catalyst and IPA led to dissociation of IPA to the corresponding alkoxide. Meanwhile, the carbonyl group in EL was activated by acid sites. Proton transfer then occurred between activated carbonyl and alkoxide to form a six-member intermediate, which further led to produce 4-HPE. Ultimately, 4-PHE was transformed into GVL through an intramolecular transesterification under the boost of acid sites. The acid sites including those of Lewis acid (stemming from zirconium atoms) and Brønsted acid (stemming from –OH) as well as the basic sites (originating from N and O in organophosphonic acid) were crucial to the CTH of EL to GVL. As shown in Scheme 11 . Primarily, with the assistance of basic sites, IPA took away the proton in the hydroxyl group and adsorbed on the surface of Lewis acid sites to form the corresponding alkoxide. Simultaneously, the carbonyl group in EL was activated by Lewis acid sites in the catalyst. During the reaction, the two main by-products were 2-isopropyl ethlvalerate and isopropyl levulinate (IPL), and the latter could be transformed into GVL with a similar reaction route to EL. Tabanelli and Cavani et al. [78] proposed similar mechanism over BPhZr catalyst (Scheme 12 ). Upon simultaneous activation of the carbonyl group in EL by Zr4+, a six-membered intermediate is formed, which is quite favorable for the process of hydrogen transfer. Afterwards, the intermediate (4-HPE) can be further transformed into GVL via lactonization over either Lewis basic sites or Brønsted acidic species generated from structural defect. As described in Scheme 13 . The Zr(Salphen)-MCM-41 catalysts possess acidic sites (Zr4+, –OH) and basic sites (O2−, N3−). These active sites (Zr4+, O2−, and N3−) interacted with both EL and IPA to activate the carbonyl group, leading to the dissociation of IPA to its corresponding alkoxide and proton, then EL accepted the proton from the dissociation of IPA to form 4-HPE. At this stage, through a six-membered-ring transition state, Brønsted acid (-OH) induces an intramolecular esterification to give GVL, as also supported in similar GVL forming processes. Thus, the –OH present in the channels of MCM-41 play a key role in the selective formation of GVL. IPL underwent further CTH to form GVL much like EL, which initially formed by transesterification of EL. Similarly, Song and Han et al. [107] found that the catalytic activity of Zr-HBA (4-hydroxybenzoic acid) is very high, because the existence of phenate in the Zr-HBA structure increases the basicity of the catalyst (Figure S10). Acidic and basic sites in the catalyst are crucial for a CTH reaction. There were both acid sites and basic sites on the Zr-HBA. The acid sites mainly originated from the Zr4+ and the basic sites resulted mainly from O2− in the carboxylate and phenate groups. As shown in Scheme 14 . Firstly, the interaction of IPA with the acid-base sites (Zr4+-O2-) on Zr-HBA leads to its dissociation to the corresponding alkoxide. At the same time, the carbonyl group in EL can be adsorbed and activated by Zr4+-O2- on Zr-HBA. Then, hydrogen transfer takes place between the dissociated alcohol and the activated EL via a concerted process involving a six-link intermediate to form 4-HPE. Finally, the 4-HPE is converted into GVL through an intramolecular transesterification. Meanwhile, IPA is converted into acetone after losing two H atoms. In the reaction process, the by-product IPL can be formed by transesterification of EL with IPA. Two possible reaction pathways (hydrogenation-cyclization and cyclization-reduction) can be involved for producing GVL from EL. As shown in Scheme S4. The formation of 2-propoxide and the activation of carbonyl group of EL are promoted by both acid and base sites (Zr4+-O2-) of the Ti–Zr catalyst, [103] resulting in the production of 4-HPE through a six-membered transition state, which can be further transformed into GVL via a intramolecular transesterification process. 2.4.2 Plausible mechanism over Cu-based catalysts Huo and Jin et al. [113] proposed a possible mechanism on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA-3) catalyst. As shown in Scheme 15 . Firstly, a surface alkoxy group was generated when the O–H bond of IPA was absorbed on CZA-3 surface. Then, β-H elimination happened to produce acetone and two Cu–H active species of CTH process formed. The active H species hydrogenated acetyl group to obtain 4-HPE (D). Finally, intramolecular nucleophilic attack of compound D took place to afford GVL along with the regeneration of CZA-3 and the formation of EtOH. A trace amount of 1,4-PDO was also obtained by further hydrogenation of GVL. Kuboona et al. [115] proposed a mechanism about CTH of ML to GVL over CuNiO catalysts (Scheme 16 ). Typically, two major steps including (1) alcohol dehydrogenation to activate surface of the catalyst and (2) hydrogenation of ML followed by simultaneous cyclization to produce GVL. In the first major step, IPA was oxidized over a mixed metal oxide catalyst (containing both Lewis acid and Brønsted base sites) to form 2-propoxide on the catalyst surface (step i). This dehydrogenated intermediate generated hydrogen species and acetone via direct catalytic transfer or MPV mechanism (step ii). Then, the hydrogen species reduced metal oxides surface simultaneously to form metal active sites (Lewis acid) and this process generated water which could partially reoxidize the metals to metal hydroxides. After ML was inserted to the active metal sites (step iii) under adequate reaction pressure resulted from generated H2 and alcohol vapor at 200 °C, ML could then spontaneously react with adsorbed hydrogen species on the catalyst surface to form 4-HPE adsorbed on the surface (step iv). Some of this intermediate could be eliminated from the surface (step v) while the others underwent cyclization (step vii) leading to GVL production as well as MeOH formation (step viii). The vacant active sites were then filled with IPA (step ix) to generate active hydrogen species after IPA dehydrogenation (step x) and acetone elimination (step xi). This led to an active site ready for the next cycle of GVL production. Due to the fact that there were less number of Lewis acid (metal or alloy) than Brønsted base (species on the catalyst active sites at the beginning of the reaction, both alcohol dehydrogenation and GVL production preferably underwent trough MPV mechanism. However, after the first cycle of reaction both MPV and metal hydride are crucial pathways for IPA dehydrogenation and ML hydrogenation. Li et al. [117] studied the mechanism of EL to GVL over Ni–Cu nanoparticle catalysts. As shown in Scheme 17 . On one hand, the C=O group of EL can strongly interact with Ni–Cu catalysts. In addition, the adsorbed C=O group can be activated by surface Lewis acid sites (Route 1). On the other hand, abundant basic and acidic sites in the Ni–Cu also is responsible for its best catalytic activity via MPV reduction route (Route 2). 2.4.3 Plausible mechanism over Hf-based catalysts The mechanism over Hf-based catalyst is familiar with Zr-based catalyst. Leshkov et al. [135] investigated the reaction kinetics of the MPV reduction of ML to 4-HPE and subsequent lactonization to GVL catalyzed by Lewis acid zeolites. Reaction kinetics studies show a first-order dependence on ML and 2-BuOH, confirm that the hydride shift is the rate-limiting step, and support a dual-binding mechanism on a single Lewis acid site. Hf-Beta was determined to be a highly active and selective catalyst for the MPV reduction of ML to 4-HPE and subsequent ring closing to GVL (selectivity>97%) in 2-BuOH. The active Lewis acid site is hypothesized to be a partially hydrolyzed ‘‘open site’’ where the metal is coordinated to three O–Si framework groups and one hydroxyl group. The reaction proceeds in the following steps (Scheme 18 ): adsorption and deprotonation of BuOH over the Lewis acid center (step 1); adsorption of ML (step 2) and hydride shift from deprotonated BuOH to ML through a six-membered cyclic transition state (step 3); desorption of 2-butanone (step 4); and hydrogen transfer from the catalyst and desorption of 4-HPE (step 5). 4-HPE then undergoes a spontaneous intramolecular ring-closure and a Brønsted acid-catalyzed release of MeOH to form GVL (step 6). Song and Han et al. [121] believed that (Scheme 19 ), in a first step, IPA interacted with the acid-base sites (Hf4+-O2-) or the amino groups on the Hf-ATMP, and dissociated to the corresponding alkoxide and proton. At the same time, the carbonyl groups in LA and its esters was activated by Hf4+-O2-. Then, the activated carbonyl group interacted with the nearby activated IPA to form a six-link intermediate, and 4-HPE or its ester could be formed by hydrogen transfer. Finally, GVL could be obtained from 4-HPE through intramolecular esterification or transesterification. The Brønsted/Lewis acid (originating from Hf4+ and –OH, respectively) and base (originating from O2− in carboxyl groups) couple sites are crucial for the cascade transfer hydrogenation and lactonization of EL to GVL [126]. For the possible reaction mechanism, it can be proposed that the adsorption of IPA onto FDCA-Hf assisted with Lewis acid-base sites (Hf4+-O2-) leads to the formation of isopropoxide and hydride by dissociation, while the carbonyl group in EL possibly anchored by Brønsted acidic species was simultaneously activated by Hf4+, thus generating a six-link intermediate to facilitate the hydrogen transfer route (Scheme S5). Then, the resulting 4-HPE is further converted to GVL via intramolecular transesterification promoted by both basic sites and Brønsted acidic species generated from structural defect. The acid-base sites in PPOA-Hf played a cooperative role in the reaction of EL to GVL (Scheme 20 ) studied by Li and Yang et al. [122] Firstly, IPA was activated via combination with the Lewis acid sites (Hf4+) and Lewis base sites (O2−) of PPOA-Hf. Concurrently, the carbonyl group in EL was activated via the Lewis acid sites (Hf4+). As a result, a hydrogen transfer reaction was carried out successfully with PPOA-Hf. Subsequently, lactonization occurred via a five-membered ring, which was facilitated by the Brønsted acid. 2.4.4 Summary It is found that Zr-based catalysts could facilitate transfer hydrogenation reactions through MPV mechanism via forming six-member ring as key intermediate. The bifunctional nature of Zr4+-O2- pair coordinately interact with ketone group in LA molecules to initiate catalytic cycles. Alcohol is first adsorbed on the basic Zr site (Zr–OH species) and dissociated to form the corresponding Zr-bound alkoxide. The carbonyl group of levulinate ester is then coordinated to the Zr site and subsequently forms a six-membered-ring transition state. The-hydride of the Zr-bound alkoxide attacks the carbonyl group of levulinate ester to yield Zr-bound 4-HPE species and new carbonyl compound corresponding to the alcohol. Subsequently, the carbonyl byproduct is released and the Zr-bound 4-HPE species are displaced by another alcohol to regenerate the Zr-bound alkoxide species, thus the catalytic cycle is completed. Hf-based catalysts show similar mechanism for transfer hydrogenation of LA esters. For Cu-based catalysts, the adsorbed C=O group of LA ester on catalyst surface can be activated by surface Lewis acidic and basic sites which are responsible for good catalytic activity via MPV reduction route."
9,CTH of LA using alcohols as H-donors,
10,ZrO2-based catalysts,"3.1 ZrO2-based catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Like LA ester, studies on CTH of LA using alcohol are focus on Zr-based materials (Entries#1 - #7 in Table 2 ). Several methods were used to synthesize ZrO2 catalysts, including wet impregnation, precipitation method, etc. In this system, the well dispersed Lewis acid sites on large surface area (300–800 m2 g−1) are attributing to the high activity. (2) Catalytic performance ZrO2 based materials display remarkable performances in dissociating alcohols in non-aqueous medium. The Lewis acid centers are effective in activating C–H and O–H bond in alcoholic molecules for H2 generation. Sun and Lin et al. [139] first reported HCl/ZrO(OH)2 catalysts prepared in-situ by the autonomous decomposition of ZrOCl2·8H2O in LA/2-BuOH solution, which catalyzed the esterification of LA in tandem with hydrocyclization to GVL via MPV mechanism. XRD and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns showed that the in-situ generated ZrO(OH)2 existed in an amorphous state and its specific surface area and morphology of the in-situ generated catalysts showed a strong dependence on the substrates (Fig. 7 (a)). And a maximum GVL yield of 92.4% and a GVL formation rate of 1.0922 mmol g−1 min−1 were achieved at 240 °C in 2 h. It is found that the unexpected catalytic efficiency was attributed mainly to its extremely high surface area. Enhanced dispersion of ZrO2 species on porous materials with high surface area is known to be effective in many catalytic applications. ZrO2-Beta was also used in CTH of LA to GVL by Chuah and colleagues [138]. Quantitative conversion with >99% yield of GVL was obtained with a steady generation rate of 460 mmol g−1 h−1 in a flow reactor at 118 °C. The presence of Lewis acid sites with moderate strength and only relatively few basic sites are key factors for its good activity and lack of poisoning by the acidic substrate. Rao et al. [136] found that ZrO2/SBA-15 (Fig. 7(b)) prepared by wet impregnation method could be used as an efficient catalyst for the production of GVL from transfer hydrogenation of LA in vapor phase (250 °C) at atmospheric pressure, which delivered 100% of LA conversion with 93% of GVL selectivity. The good performance is attributed to presence of well dispersed acidic sites of ZrO2 associated with improved surface area having sustained pore channels. The parent SBA-15 and ZrO2/SBA-15 catalysts have retained their 2D hexagonal mesoporous pore arrangement (Figure S11) but ZrO2 might be in amorphous form or highly dispersed form. The acidity of the catalysts increases linearly with the zirconia loading. Lin et al. [140] designed a novel ZrF/MOFs preparation method in water other than toxic DMF, which can exhibit 96% of LA conversion and 98% of GVL selectivity at 200 °C. The key finding in this work is that, modulation (monocarboxylic acids, e.g., FA, acetic acid and propanoic acid, which are employed as modulators during the preparation of water-born ZrF) effect greatly influenced size and shape of water-born ZrF. Since three modulators led to quite distinct morphologies of ZrF, different degrees of dispersion of these ZrF materials in reaction media would be also expected to influence their catalytic performances for LA conversion to GVL. Specifically, when more modulators and shorter modulators were employed, the resulting ZrF materials could be significantly larger and more non-spherical. In contrast, while few modulators and longer modulators were employed, the resulting ZrF exhibited very small size and seriously aggregated. As for LA conversion, the large-sized ZrF modulated by FA was more favorable than small-sized ZrF modulated by propanoic acid for LA conversion to GVL. The morphologies of ZrF prepared using various modulators were first characterized and shown in Fig. 7(c and d)."
11,Metal-based catalysts,"3.2 Metal-based catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Compared with metal oxide, metal-based nanocatalysts show remarkable performances for activation of LA molecules. Among various non-noble metals, Ni-based materials (Entries#8 - #12 in Table 2), which contain Lewis acid and Brønsted acid, exhibit most promising activity and selectivity in transfer hydrogenation using alcohols as H-donors. (2) Catalytic performance Osawa et al. [142] prepared a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst using impregnation method, in which the partial inclusion of Ni into the amorphous ZrO2 could resulted in the transformation to tetragonal phases during the calcination. The GVL yield of 94% at 100 °C and 92% even at 90 °C were attained for the hydrogenation of ML over Ni/ZrO2. For the hydrogenation of LA, the GVL yield of 86% was attained at 120 °C. Ni in the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst largely contributed to the hydrogenation of the substrate and ZrO2 had a high activity for the lactonization of the hydrogenated product. Clearly, the hybridized materials display strong synergism in conversion of LA in alcoholic medium. Similar to ZrO2 materials, other acidic supports also show strong promoting effect in LA conversion. Srinivasan et al. [144] utilized a commercial Ni/SiO2–Al2O3 (Ni/SA) catalyst for CTH of LA in IPA and obtained 99% yield of GVL at 200 °C in 15 min. The catalysts have spherical and plate-like morphologies. Ni particles are uniformly distributed on the external surface of SiO2–Al2O3 support with an average particle size of 10–20 nm (Figure S12). Rode et al. [143] utilized NaBH4 reduction method to synthesize Ni-MMT catalyst, which showed almost complete LA conversion (>99%) and selectivity (>99%) to GVL within 1 h at 200 °C. Surface characterization shows that Ni particles were uniformly distributed within the MMT matrix thereby forming the homogenous phase of the Ni/MMT composite (Figure S13). The HRTEM image of 50%-Ni/MMT revealed a spherical shape forming a chain of beads of metal nanoparticles. Although Ni-acid pairs show synergistic enhancement for CTH reactions. The fundamental understanding on the possible electronic coupling at Ni and acid interface is still not fully understood. Some recent efforts have also been devoted to developing bimetallic catalysts, but relevant studies are still very limited. Zhao et al. [145] synthesized the NiFe alloy nanoparticles using carbothermal method, which are evenly embedded in carbon matrix. The catalyst displayed a full conversion of LA with almost 100% GVL selectivity and 2.785 mmol g−1 h−1 GVL productivity at 180 °C within 0.5 h. According to the characteristics, it can be concluded that the synthesized Ni–Fe NPs/C catalyst is a Ni–Fe alloy form of NPs and homogeneously embedded in sheet-like carbon supporting matrix (Fig. 8 ). Zhao et al. [4] utilized a facile ultrasound-assisted impregnation method to prepare Cu nanoparticle catalyst on active carbon (AC). Quantitative conversion of LA (>99%) with an 89.9% GVL selectivity can be achieved within 5 h at 220 °C. XRD pattern confirmed the present of Cu, Cu2O and CuO phases in the catalyst and XPS indicated that Cu catalyst displayed the mixture species of Cu2+and Cu+/Cu0. The TEM analyses (Figure S14) revealed that the formed Cu NPs are uniform in size and well-dispersed in AC support."
12,Mechanism studies,"3.3 Mechanism studies Assary and Curtiss et al. [149] studied the mechanism of transfer hydrogenation of LA and EL in various solvent. An intramolecular hydride transferred through a six-membered transition state was found to be the turnover controlling transition state of liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds considered in this study. Because of the presence of carboxylate group, LA is not an ideal starting compound for the reduction using metal ions due to the strong affinity of carboxylate functional group toward the metal ion. Therefore EL is chosen to study the relative catalytic ability of the Sn and Zr model catalysts in IPA. The reaction sequence proceeds via three key reaction sequence steps (Fig. 9 ) as follows. (a) Deprotonation of IPA by the Lewis base (-OH): A→D. (b) Intermolecular hydride transfer from the carbon with the activated oxygen atom: D→G. (c) Protonation of alkoxy group by the water ligand: G→I. Dumesic et al. [64] demonstrated for the first time that the MPV reaction can be exploited for the formation of GVL from LA and its esters over heterogeneous catalysts, which could achieve over various metal oxide catalysts using secondary alcohols as H-donors. ZrO2 was demonstrated to be a highly active material for CTH, in both batch and continuous flow reactor studies. 4-oxopentanoate (SBL) was one of the main compounds in the liquid product. This observation indicates that LA first undergoes esterification to SBL, which is followed by the CTH of SBL to 4-HPE and the lactonization of 4-HPE to yield GVL in 2-BuOH (Scheme 21 ). Leshkov et al. [137] demonstrated a combination of solid Lewis (Zr-Beta) and Brønsted acids (Al-MFI-ns) catalyzed a domino reaction of Fur into GVL involving sequential transfer hydrogenation and ring-opening steps in high GVL yields approaching 80%. In the conversion of LA, Zr-Beta showed the highest activity with the formation of GVL in 97% yield at 120 °C and an initial production rate of 17.101 mmol g−1 min−1. As shown in Scheme S6. First, Fur was converted into furfuryl alcohol through a CTH promoted by a Lewis acid catalyst and 2-BuOH as an H-donor. In the presence of an acid catalyst and 2-BuOH, a fraction of FA was converted into butyl furfuryl ether (FE). Next, a Brønsted acid converted FA and FE into a mixture of LA and BL through hydrolytic ring-opening reactions. Finally, both LA and BL underwent a second CTH step to produce the corresponding 4-HPE, followed by lactonization to form GVL. LA hydrogenation at solvent-free conditions was studied in a slurry reactor over the sulphide form of NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst by Grilc et al. [59] The influence of process parameters on the H2 equilibrium solubility in the liquid, the external and internal mass transfer limitations, adsorption and desorption rates and the rates of surface and homogenous reactions were determined experimentally and computationally by utilizing a newly-developed micro-kinetic model. The presence of four major reaction pathways as shown in Scheme S7: (1) HDO of LA by dehydrative cyclization to α- or β-angelica lactone (AL) and their subsequent hydrogenation to GVL, (2) HDO of LA by hydrogenation to 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (HVA) and subsequent dehydrative cyclization to GVL, (3) direct decarboxylation of LA to 2-butanone (BK) and (4) C–C coupling reaction via aldol addition. Arias et al. [10] prepared Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst using a simple wet impregnation method, which resulted in an 80% yields of GVL at 250 °C in CTH of LA with IPA as solvent. The bimetallic promotion effect of the catalyst is confirmed, which produced less active sites with much higher activity instead of improving the dispersion of the metal. The possible hydrogen sources are illustrated in Scheme 22 , which shows the LA to GVL reactions under N2. Rode et al. [143] studied the plausible mechanism of CTH of LA to GVL over Ni-MMT catalyst. A plausible reaction pathway (Scheme 23 ) is proposed involving the following steps: (i) esterification of LA in the presence of IPA to give IPL (ii) simultaneous elimination of β-H from IPA to giving 4-hydroxy IPA-LA (iii) its cyclization to GVL with IPA as a byproduct. And the strong acid strength of MMT facilitated the esterification of LA as well as cyclization to GVL. Similarly, Srinivasan et al. [144] detected the formation of 4-HPE intermediates during the reaction, which confirmed that the reaction occurs through hydrogenation of LA followed by cyclization (intra-molecular esterification) to yield GVL. Zhao et al. [145] synthesized the NiFe alloy nanoparticles using carbothermal method, which are evenly embedded in carbon matrix. As shown in Fig. 10 . The esterification reaction between the hydroxyl group of IPA and carboxyl group of LA can readily occur to form an intermediate of IPL (T1). When the reaction temperature reaches a key point, the catalyst promotes the IPA dissociation to release active H∗. The carbonyl group of T1 and H∗ are catalyzed by the catalyst to convert T1 into T2 (isopropyl 4-hydroxypentate), which is unstable and inclined to take the intramolecular lactonization reaction to generate target product of GVL. It is found that LA is captured by the electrophilic Cu+ species, then accomplished by CTH through the MPV reaction at Cu catalyst. For the CTH of LA to GVL, LA could be captured by the electrophilic Cu+ species. It is well understood that the LA to GVL conversion in alcohol solvent essentially proceeds through the formation of LA-esters and followed by their hydrogenation on the catalytic surface. Therefore, it could be regarded as accomplished by CTH through the MPV reaction over Cu catalyst (Fig. 11 ). Xu et al. [146] obtained high LA conversion (85.1%) and GVL selectivity (95.2%) at 110 °C employing a simply synthesized hexagonal mesoporous arrays Sn-modified silica catalyst (SnO2/SBA-15) with both Lewis and Brønsted acidity (Figure S15), which could synergistically catalyze the tandem steps of hydrogen transfer and esterification. The good catalytic performance is reasonably attributed to the strong Lewis acid sites on SnO2/SBA-15, which could efficiently catalyze the individual reactions of hydrogen transfer, as well as the Brønsted acidity, which is benefit for the esterification step. The conversion of LA to GVL should process the tandem steps of (I) transfer hydrogenation from IPA to reduce the C=O to C–OH group on LA and (II) esterification of C–OH and COOH groups and the combined reaction of (III) transformation of LA to GVL using IPA as an H-donor (Scheme 24 ). It is interesting that the reduction conversion of LA could also be applied in electrocatalysis. Li et al. [148] reported an effective approach to electricity storage in biofuels by selective electrocatalytic reduction of LA to high-energy-density VA or GVL on a non-noble Pb electrode in a single-polymer electrolyte membrane electrocatalytic cell reactor with a very high yield of VA (>90%), a high Faradaic efficiency (>86%), promising electricity storage efficiency (70.8%) and a low electricity consumption (1.5 kWh LVA −1). The reaction pathway is shown in Scheme 25 ."
13,CTH of LA using FA as an H-donor,
14,Catalyst design,"4.1 Catalyst design Different from previous case, where metal oxide based catalyst materials have been widely studied for CTH of LA using alcohols as H-donors, in this part, supported metal catalysts usually display remarkable performances for conversion of LA using FA as an H-donor. But unlike using alcohols as H-donors, which mainly focus on Zr-based catalysts, the existing studies are very limited with a few metal catalysts, such as Cu and Ni. Generally, the good performances are attributed to high surface area, high metal dispersion and strong metal-support interaction. However, there is a lack of research on the effects of morphology on performance. 4.1.1 Cu-based catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Using the incipient wet impregnation or precipitation method can obtain several Cu-based catalysts (Entries#1 - #5 in Table 3 ). In this system, the reducible Cu species were proven to be the active phase. And strong Cu-support interaction play an important role in catalytic performance and stability. It is found that the synergistic interaction between Cu and support can improve the FA decomposition activity. (2) Catalytic performance Cu-based solid catalysts have been extensively studied for hydrogenolysis of C–O bond for polyols. The overall activity is low, although chemoselectivity for C–O cleavage over excess C–C rupture is very high compared with other systems. The molecular nature of C=O bond activation on Cu-based catalysts has been well-established for petrochemical industry, as catalytic dehydrogenation of terminal and internal alcohols over Cu catalysts are promising for production of fatty aldehydes or ketones [163,164]. Sultana et al. [150] reported vapor phase conversion of aqueous LA with FA over different Cu catalysts. Among them, the Cu/SiO2 prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O showed the highest LA conversion (56%) and selectivity to GVL (87%) at 250 °C in aqueous mixture of LA and FA. It is important to mention that, Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation method often display fast particle sintering due to weak Cu/SiO2 interaction [150,151]. But characterization in this work showed that there was reduced copper species or metallic Cu in Cu/SiO2 with weak and medium acidic sites. The reducibility of the Cu supported catalyst plays a more important role than its surface area and acidity. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of LA and FA (both could act as H-donors) could lead to in-situ rearrangement of Cu particles and possibly enhance metal-support interaction. Relatively strong support interaction with the copper species in Cu–SiO2 lead to enhanced LA conversion and high GVL selectivity. The role of acid sites is to cleavage of C–O bonds by dehydration forming angelicalactone (AL), which gets converted to GVL by the following hydrogenation over metallic Cu. Therefore, it is plausible that metallic Cu promoted by weak acidity over SiO2 contributes to improved conversion of LA to GVL [151]. However, further characterization is needed to understand the molecular nature of such hybridized structures. Rao et al. [152] studied vapor phase hydrogenation of LA using FA as an H-donor, which has been conducted over ordered mesoporous Cu/Fe2O3 catalysts prepared by hard template method using SBA-15. They obtained 100% conversion of LA and 100% selectivity of GVL at 250 °C. The high catalytic performance was attributed to the interaction between Cu and Fe oxide particles because of which a large number of easily reducible CuO species was present. The XRD patterns of reduced catalysts show the reflections due to CuFe2O4. Cu/Fe2O3 looks a thread-like morphology in Figure S16. Compared with previous studies on Cu catalysts for hydrogenation, it seems that the nature of active centers for CuFe2O4 catalysts are not Cu+ species. Cao et al. [154] describe a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst prepared from the oxalate-gel co-precipitation method for directly converting a 1:1 aqueous mixture of LA and FA into GVL at 200 °C and obtained 100% LA conversion and 100% GVL selectivity. The high performance of the copper catalyst for the in-situ generation of H2 in the systems by the highly selective decomposition of FA in an aqueous medium is essential. The completely reduced metallic Cu was detected dispreading on the tetragonal ZrO2 crystallites. And this catalytic system is also found to be effective with other raw cellulosic biomass, such as giant reed. For Cu-based catalysts, high dispersion generally exhibit good activity and different Cu crystal facet process specific effect. The nature of catalytically active centers for decomposition of FA and activation of C=O bond in LA is not well-established yet. It seems that both metallic Cu and CuO show good activity for conversion of LA. Further studies should be conducted to establish the fundamental understanding of the intrinsically active sites for C–H bond cleavage of FA and subsequent C=O rupture of LA molecules. 4.1.2 Ni-based catalysts (1) Catalysts preparation Ni catalysts also show promising performances in hydrogenolysis of cellulosic resources. For example, numerous work has shown that Ni-based mono and bimetallic catalysts exhibit good performances in conversion of glycerol, xylitol and sorbitol [165–167]. The combination of Ni with Cu has also been studied. Ni-based catalysts (Entries#6 - #9 in Table 3) can be obtained through impregnation method or hydrothermal method. Different from Cu-based materials, high dispersion of metallic Ni and lower particle size are favorably to the good performance. (2) Catalytic performance Varkolu and Kamaraju et al. [155] developed NiO/Al2O3 catalyst for hydrogenation of LA to GVL in the present of FA and without water and obtained 99% of LA conversion with 100% of GVL selectivity at 250 °C. The catalyst was prepared by a wet impregnation method. The generation of available NiO species that interact weakly with the Al2O3 support results in a higher number of Ni metallic species with smaller sizes and high dispersion, making the NiO/Al2O3 a promising catalytic system (Fig. 12 (a)). Guo and Smith et al. [157] developed methods for single-step synthesis of Ni-functional catalysts and for one-pot conversion of LA to GVL in a scCO2-ionic liquid biphasic system using FA as an H-donor source, giving a 99% LA conversion and 98% GVL selectivity after 3 h at 170 °C in the [BMIM]Cl ionic liquid. The catalyst was prepared by simple one-step hydrothermal carbonization of glucose in the presence of a metal sulfate salt and 5-sulfosalicylic acid and denoted as Ni-functionalized carbon (Ni/NiO/C). The metal catalytic materials were reduced using glucose under hydrothermal conditions during the single-step synthesis method as shown by: C6H12O6+12Ni2++6H2O →12Ni+24H++6CO2. As shown in Fig. 12(b). XRD pattern confirms the existence of Ni and NiO species. FT-IR spectrum indicates that the catalyst had COO−, –SO3H and –OH groups, and the metallic particles were widely dispersed in the carbon material. The presence of scCO2 in the [BMIM]Cl ionic liquid phase enhanced hydrogenation of LA into GVL. The generally favorable performance of the Ni/NiO/C catalyst for hydrogenation may be due to a cooperative effect between Ni and NiO sites. The role of the scCO2 is that it inhibits volatilization of an H-donor substrate, increases mass transfer of substrates in the ionic liquid phase, enhances H2 solubility in the ionic liquid phase and removes the GVL product from the reaction (ionic liquid) phase. The heterojunction of Ni and NiO interfaces could also lead to the synergism of transfer hydrogenation reactions. Varkolu and Zyl et al. [156] employed various preparation methods, including impregnation (IM), co-precipitation (CP), deposition-precipitation (DP), and citric acid assisted impregnation combustion (SG), for the preparation of Ni/SiO2 catalysts for LA hydrogenation with FA as an H-donor in a continuous process at atmospheric pressure. The Ni/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the citric acid assisted method and calcined in inert gas flow was the most efficient (93% GVL yield at 250 °C). The catalytic performance is presumably due to the high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and optimal porosity. XRD patterns (Figure S17) of the calcined material revealed the presence of NiO particles, while calcination in an inert atmosphere produced Ni particles through in-situ reduction of NiO. According to experimental studies, it is clear that Ni-Lewis acid interaction is critical for metal dispersion and chemoselectivity towards GVL. The size-dependence catalytic performances are yet to be established for Ni-based catalysts. In particular, the influence of particle size and Ni-acid interaction on activity and selectivity is still unclear at this stage. Additionally, Ni-support interaction induced altered Ni oxidation states should also be considered for future studies. Combining Cu with Ni catalysts is another promising method to improve overall performances of non-noble catalysts for conversion of LA in FA medium. Hwang and Chang et al. [153] prepared thermally stable NiCu/SiO2 catalyst via a deposition-precipitation method and used it for vapor phase hydrogenation of LA. The catalyst selectively converts 99% of LA into 96% of GVL in 1,4-dioxane at 285 °C. The CuO and NiO exist in calcined catalysts and Cu and NiO exist in reduced catalysts. The Cu and Ni species are homogenously dispersed in the catalyst and no evidence was obtained for the presence of Cu–Ni alloy in the catalyst (Fig. 12(c and d)). 4.1.3 Other metal oxide catalysts In addition to Ni and Cu catalysts, other non-noble metal materials such as MgO–Al2O3 and FeOx materials (Entries#10 - #14 in Table 3) have also been investigated for conversion of LA in FA medium. These metal oxide materials have many basic sites for activation of carboxylic groups. In particular, altered metal oxidation state results in tunable surface basicity, through precise control of catalyst morphologies and post-treatment conditions such as temperature and atmosphere. The calcined hydrotalcite samples with various Mg/Al proportions were synthesized by co-precipitation method and examined for the conversion of LA to GVL using FA by Chary et al. [162] The calcined Mg/Al hydrotalcite catalyst with Mg:Al ratio of 3:1 exhibited superior performance giving GVL selectivity of 98% and total conversion of LA till 10 h at 270 °C. This is apparently due to the presence of larger number of available active (basic) sites on the catalyst surface. The presence of various types of basic sites on the hydrotalcite catalysts is mainly owed to the presence of small amount of OH− groups, Mg–O pairs and O2− ions on the catalyst surface. The catalysts exhibited the presence of irregular shaped with non-orderly arranged particles. From the characterization, the layered hydrotalcite structure was detected but destroyed during the calcination of samples. Burtoloso et al. [158] converted LA into GVL in the presence of FA in high yields (up to 92%) using Fe3(CO)12 compounds as catalyst precursors. And to mimic a biorefinery setting, they directly converted crude liquor (containing 20% LA) from the acid hydrolysis of sugarcane biomass in a pilot plant facility into GVL in good yield (50%), without the need for isolating LA. Fu et al. [161] reported a Fe-based homogeneous catalyst for conversion of EL and FA into GVL in high yield of 99% at 140 °C after 24 in 1,4-dioxane. The key to achieve this Fe-catalyzed process is the suitable combination of a tertraphosphine chelation ligand and a weakly coordinated iron precursor, Fe (II) triflate at 140 °C. Luque et al. [160] synthesized supported Fe oxide nanocatalysts under continuous flow conditions and used them in the microwave-assisted conversion of LA in FA medium. A simple and highly reproducible continuous flow method has been used for the homogeneous deposition of Fe oxide nanoparticles on the porous silicates supports. This Fe/Zr-SBA catalysts provided higher LA conversion (30%) and GVL selectivity (78%) with TOF values of 125 h−1 at 200 °C compared with other materials. Fe species in the materials were found to correlate to a hematite Fe2O3 phase with nanoparticle sizes in the 5–7 nm range (Fig. 13 )."
15,Mechanism studies,"4.2 Mechanism studies A possible mechanism has been proposed for Fe-catalyzed CTH of LA using FA as an H-donor (Scheme 26 ). The Fe catalyst can be formed by coordination of Fe (II) triflate with PP3 ligand. Triflate anion on iron can be easily replaced by formate anion due to the weak coordination ability to form complex 1. The complex 1 can isomerize to 2 by changing the coordination mode of formate anion. After dehydrogenation of 2, a Fe–H species is formed. This Fe–H species can further coordinate with EL, to form complex 3. Since neutral carbonyl group has weak coordination ability with Fe (II), this step may be easily hampered in the presence of an anion with stronger coordination ability. After reducing the carbonyl group by Fe–H, alkoxide anion can be protonated and replaced by formate anion to regenerate complex 2. The LA hydrogenation proceeds via two routes (Scheme 27 ), initial cyclodehydration to AL over acidic sites of catalyst and afterwards reduction of AL over metallic sites to form GVL or reduction of LA to 4-hydroxyvaleric acid followed by cyclodehydration to form GVL. Therefore, the selection of support with specific acid sites for dehydration and metal site for reduction are both important for this reaction. Here, AL was detected as intermediate, indicating that the hydrogenation is LA in the presence of FA and water, indeed proceeds via the LA-AL-GVL route."
16,Conclusions and outlooks,"In this review article, we have systematically discussed the structural uniqueness of various non-noble metal-based solid catalysts for facile transfer hydrogenation of levulinic acid and esters. Surface morphology, electronic properties of Brønsted/Lewis acid pairs and Lewis acid/base pairs are found to be key factors contributing to tandem H2 generation, H transfer and hydrogenation reactions over Zr, Cu, Ni, Hf and Fe catalysts. It is clear that activation of C–H and C=O bond on cationic and anionic centers is critical for chemoselectivity and atomic economics during transfer hydrogenation reactions. In addition, mechanistic studies reveal that the abundance of surface metallic sites, Brønsted/Lewis acid pairs and Lewis acid/base pairs is the determining factor for H2 utilization efficiency, as tunable M − H bonding (M: active sites) is crucial for either dehydrogenation or H transfer step. The following aspects need to be paid with extensive attention in future studies: (a) Precise control of lattice facet. As shown in various cases of metal oxide catalysts, the poor catalytic activity of non-noble materials originate from ill-defined surface facets. Although surface defects might leads to improved activity, the poorly defined surface facet disturbs H-transfer step, thus the overall H2 utilization efficiency demands further improvement. (b) Further understanding on Brønsted/Lewis acid pairs and Lewis acid/base pairs. Again, it is a classic topic, but the detailed relation for acid and base pairs with tunable C–H and C=O bond activation is still not well established. This is because that there is lack of comprehensive kinetic studies, to correlate acidic and basic properties with each of the key reaction step in catalytic cycles. (c) Influence of electronic reconfiguration. As already discussed in the maintext, many promising catalyst candidates have hybridized compositions and structures. Despite of inspected surface characterization, the electronic coupling effect in mixed metal oxides and multimetallic catalysts are still under debate. In other words, whether compositional effect or electronic resemble play the predominant role in catalyzing C–H and C=O bond cleavage is not yet studies in large. There is no doubt that transfer hydrogenation represent most promising hydrogenation techniques for future bio-refineries. Fundamental understanding on catalyst morphologies and electronic features will be useful for successful implementation of such novel technologies for hydrogenation as well as other biomass conversion processes."
