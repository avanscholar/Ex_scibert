0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the world is facing two significantly related challenges: an increasing demand for new energy and a stringently environmental concern. The increasingly environmental regulations require the utilization of clean energy in a variety of areas. Hydrogen is such a clean fuel that has received a great attention because of its importance in fuel cell technology, petroleum refining, food, electronics and metallurgical processing industries and many other fields [1–4]. Approximately 95% of the hydrogen is produced from carbonaceous raw materials, primarily fossil in origin and the rest from alternative resources as biomass and water [5]. There are a number of emerging and attractive approaches or processes for the production of hydrogen, as the natural gas catalytic decomposition, steam reforming, photocatalytic decomposition of water and biomass gasification, etc. [5–12]. Hydrogen produced by photocatalytic decomposition of water is very clean and it is an economical approach. Unfortunately, it still remains at laboratory stage because of some technical difficulties for scale-up. Steam reforming of methane is highly endothermic and produces a large amount of CO x (CO2 and CO). Therefore, additional steps are required to remove these CO x by-products in order to meet the requirements in the fuel cell applications, which increases the operation cost. Economic analysis has shown that if the carbon produced in the reaction procedure can be utilized, it will be financially attractive. It is noted that both hydrogen and carbon nanotube materials can be simultaneously produced through a single technical approach of methane catalytic decomposition (MCD) that is regarded as a fully green chemical process. By methane catalytic decomposition, CO x (CO and CO2)-free hydrogen can be obtained with a moderately endothermic process [13–19]. For hydrogen production, the MCD process is believed to be superior to steam reforming from economical points of view, and it is also superior to the photocatalytic decomposition of water from the technical point of view [2,20]. Moreover, MCD is easy for scaling-up for the production of carbon nanotubes, and it is used to obtain multiwalled nanotubes with high mechanical strength, differing from the route of arc-discharge evaporation of graphite where single wall carbon nanotubes could be produced [20]. The catalysts used for methane catalytic decomposition usually consist of transition metals and a support. SiO2 [17,21–23], MgO [22], Al2O3 [20,24,25], SiO2–Al2O3 [26], SiO2–CeO2 [27], ZnAl2O4 [28] and MgAl2O4 [29], zeolite [5], carbon [30–32] and hydrotalcite-like materials [33] are the most common support. The active phases are usually group VIII transition metals Fe, Co and Ni, others like Cu and Pd are used as promoters [5,16,25,33–37]. Among these, the intensely studied catalysts are Ni supported alumina and Ni supported silica. The main influence factors on MCD are the reaction temperature, nature of the support, type and quantity of active metals. The activity and the lifetime of the Ni supported catalysts depend significantly on the size of the metal particle and are sensitive to the textural properties and pore geometry of the support [29]. It is known that the surfactant-assistant technique in the materials synthesis may provide materials with appropriate pore diameter, high surface areas and a better access to the active sites [38,39]. The application of mesoporous materials as catalysts support for hydrogen production has not been reported yet. In addition, in a preliminary investigation, we found that ceria doped silica as catalyst support shows a rather stable catalytic activity in the methane decomposition reaction [27]. In the present work, we report some new results of the synthesis, structural characterization and catalytic properties of a series of Ni/Ce-MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts synthesized by a surfactant-assisted technique for simultaneous production of hydrogen and nanocarbons (nanotubes and nanofibers). These catalysts exhibit high catalytic stability in comparison with the traditional Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Several kinds of nanocarbons are formed and their formation mechanisms are discussed and postulated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of Ce-MCM-41 mesoporous materials,"2.1 Synthesis of Ce-MCM-41 mesoporous materials The cerium promoted mesoporous materials (noted as Ce-MCM-41) were prepared by the use CeCl3·7H2O as cerium precursor, tetraethyl ortosilicate (TEOS) as silicon precursor and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) bromide as synthetic templating agent. A typical preparation of the sample with a molar relationship of Si/Ce = 20 was described as follows. Two solutions were prepared, the first solution was prepared by 1.86 g of CeCl3·7H2O and 22.8 ml of TEOS diluted in 50 ml of water with agitation; the second solution was made by addition of 11.4 g of CTABr in 200 ml hot water (near 50 °C) with stirring, followed by the addition of 145 ml of NH3·H2O (28 wt.%). Then the first solution was added, drop by drop, into the second solution to obtain a mixture. During the addition, the mixture was vigorously agitated for near 2 h until the gel was formed. The resulting gel was heated at 100 °C by 24 h. The solid was washed with deionized water and dried for 24 h. Finally the sample was annealed at 600 °C by 5 h in air with a flow rate of 60 ml/min. The heating rate was set at 1 °C/min. The other two samples with Si/Ce molar ratio 10 and 5 were synthesized with the similar method as described above."
3,Preparation of Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts The nickel supported catalysts were prepared by incipient impregnation of the calcined supports with Ni(NO3)2 solution. The Ni loading of the catalysts was 30 wt.% and 50 wt.%, respectively. After impregnation, the Ni supported materials were dried at 80 °C for 10 h and then calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. Before the catalytic evaluation, the oxidized catalysts were reduced using 99.9% H2 at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain metallic Ni particles on the catalyst surface. These catalysts are noted as Ni/Ce-MCM-41-x, where x is Si/Ce molar ratio, x = 5, 10 and 20."
4,N2-adsorption–desorption isotherms measurement,"2.3 N2-adsorption–desorption isotherms measurement The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution of the Ce-MCM-41 samples were measured in a Digisorb 2600 equipment by using low temperature N2 physisorption isotherms. Before the N2 adsorption, the samples calcined at 600 °C were thermally treated at 400 °C for 2 h. The surface area was determined according to the standard Brunaur–Emmett–Teller (BET) method in a relative pressure range of 0.04–0.2 and the total volume was evaluated from the amount of adsorbed N2 at a relative pressure (P/P 0) of about 0.99. The pore diameter distributions were calculated based on the desorption isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method."
5,Low angle X-ray diffraction analysis,"2.4 Low angle X-ray diffraction analysis The low angle X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were measured in a D-500 SIEMENS diffractometer with a graphite secondary beam monochromator to obtain a monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation, and the evaluation of the diffractograms was made by DIFFRAC/AT software. The scanning was made from 1.5 to 10, 2θ step size of 0.02 and step time of 2 s. Position correction was made using the NIST standard reference material 675."
6,Powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement,"2.5 Powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement The power X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature in a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a secondary beam monochromator. The intensities were obtained in the 2θ range between 20 and 60° with a step of 0.02° and a measuring time of 2.67 s at each point. The crystalline structures were refined using FULLPROF98 code with the Rietveld method [40,41]. The atomic positions and their coordinates of each structure corresponding to metallic Ni and graphite carbon and amorphous carbon are reported in Tables 1–3 . The goodness of the refinement fitting the experimental patterns reported as an R wp closed to 0.14 was reached."
7,Electron microscope,"2.6 Electron microscope Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Ce-MCM-41 and Ni/Ce-MCM-41 were carried out in a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope with accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The microscope is equipped with a Schottky-type field emission gun and an ultra high resolution (UHR) configuration (Cs = 0.5 mm; Cc 1.1 mm; point-to-point resolution, 0.19 nm) and in-column energy filter omega-type. The powder samples were grounded softly in an agate mortar and dispersed in isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for several minutes. A few drops were then deposited on 200 mesh copper grids covered with a holey carbon film."
8,Raman spectroscopic analysis,"2.7 Raman spectroscopic analysis The Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Yvon Jobin Horiba (T64000) spectrometer, equipped with a CCD camera detector. As a source of excitation the 514 nm lines of a Spectra Physics 2018 Argon/Krypton Ion Laser system were focused through an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a 100× magnification objective."
9,Catalytic evaluation,"2.8 Catalytic evaluation The methane catalytic decomposition was carried out in a microreactor system (Advanced Scientific Design-RXM-100) with a stainless steel fixed bed reactor (10 mm i.d. and 500 mm in length) at atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperatures varied from 500 °C to 540 °C and 580 °C. The catalyst loading was ca. 50 mg. The feed steam was a mixture of high-purity methane diluted in argon (20 mol % of methane). The total flow of the reaction gases was 75 ml min−1. The temperature increasing rate was controlled at 30 °C min−1. The inlet and outlet effluents were monitored by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) analyzer with a PE-Molsieve capillary column, using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for hydrogen analysis and a flame ionization detector (FID) for methane analysis."
10,Results,
11,Ce-MCM-41 supports,"3.1 Ce-MCM-41 supports 3.1.1 Crystalline structure Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined cerium-containing solids. All the samples have three diffraction peaks, which respectively correspond to (100), (110) and (200) reflections of the solid. The XRD patterns indicate that the long-range order of mesoporous molecular sieves with hexagonal framework was formed in the materials. These XRD patterns are very similar to the pure Si-MCM-41 sample, indicating that a small amount cerium incorporated into the Si-MCM-41 framework does not strongly modify the structure of Si-MCM-41. However, it is observed that as the cerium content increases, intensities of the XRD peaks gradually diminish, showing a reduction of the structural ordering. For the sample containing high cerium content, e.g., Si/Ce = 5, the peaks related to (110) and (200) are rather low, which indicates that the hexagonal lattice structure might partially collapse, forming wormhole-like pore system in some degree. 3.1.2 Textural properties Based on the IUPAC classification, the loops of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms belong to type IV profiles (Fig. 2 ). The presence of framework-confined mesoporous is indicated by the adsorption step centered in the relative pressure P/P o region from 0.25 to 0.45. It is found that the shape and sharpness of the loops vary with the cerium content. For example, as the cerium content increases in the materials, the sharpness of the loop in the second stage gradually decreases. The lines of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are almost overlapped in the region between P/P o < 0.75, indicating that the adsorption and desorption behaviors in the pores of the samples are very similar. The pore diameter distributions of the samples calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm by using the BJH method and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 4 . In the sample Si/Ce = 20, pore diameter was concentrated around 2.7 nm. As the cerium content increased, bimodal pore diameter distributions were observed: the main peak corresponds to pores having a diameter (D p) approximately 2.7 nm and a small one relates to some pores with larger diameter (D mp) around 3.5 nm. The structural ordering is reduced as more cerium ions are incorporated, thus some of the adjacent pores might collapse at high cerium content solid, forming some pores with diameter around 3.5 nm. In addition to this, some large pores (D lp) with a wide pore diameter distribution were formed in the range between 40 and 100 nm for the sample Si/Ce = 10 and between 20 and 100 nm for the sample with Si/Ce = 5. The formation of these pores in the mesoporous and macroporous region can be explained by the formation of voids due to inter-nanoparticles in contact. The surface area (SABET) decreases from 820 to 620 and 444 m2/g as the Si/Ce molar ratio decreases from 20 to 10 and 5, respectively. Among these samples, the solid with Si/Ce = 5 has the largest lattice cell dimension and smallest surface area and most pore wall thickness (τ). These observations show that cerium incorporation strongly affects the textural properties of the resultant materials. High cerium content not only leads to diminution of the long-range order of the mesostructure and surface area, but also increases the population of the pores with large diameter."
12,Hydrogen production over Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogen production over Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts A series of the catalysts of Ni/Ce-MCM-41 with Ni loading 30 wt.% and 50 wt.%, were used for methane catalytic decomposition. Reaction temperature has a significant influence on the methane conversion. Over all the catalysts, CH4 conversion increased with increasing of the reaction temperature (not shown). In order to study the catalytic stability of the catalysts, the CH4 decomposition reaction was continuously carried out for 1400 min. Fig. 4 shows the methane conversion via reaction time at 580 °C over the different catalysts. During the 1400 min continuous reaction, the methane conversion over different catalysts varied between 67 and 74%, no obvious deactivation was observed, indicating that the catalytic activity of the catalysts is very stable under experimental conditions. Compared with Ni/SiO2 catalyst on which complete deactivation took place after 2 h of reaction [27], the catalytic stability of the Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts is greatly enhanced by approximately 10 times. These results show that Ni-based Ce-MCM-41 mesostructured catalysts have a great potential for application in the hydrogen production due to their high stability and good catalytic activity. It has been reported that the use of basic or redox promoters decreases the formation of coke during the reforming of methane with CeO2 through a mechanism of Ce4+/Ce3+. This means that Ce species promote the adsorption of CO2 and the elimination of coke species formed on the surface of the catalyst [42]. Additionally, it has found that Ce addition increases the thermal stability and affects the metallic particle size in several catalysts and reactions [43]. In the case of the methane decomposition reaction, in our previous work, we have found that addition cerium may enhance the catalytic stability [27] We speculate that cerium addition may promote the carbon remove from specific surface to remain active Ni clean and stabilize the Ni particle, these roles are quite important for obtaining the catalysts with long lifetime."
13,Carbon nanotube (CNT) formation,"3.3 Carbon nanotube (CNT) formation 3.3.1 XRD analysis The Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts after 1400 min of reaction. The XRD reflections at 2θ = 44.2° and 53.8° correspond to metallic Ni [JCPDS No. 04-850] with an average particle size approximately 40 nm. The reflections at 2θ = 26.1° and 54.0° are assigned to graphitic carbon [ICSD No. 01-0640]. While, a peak located at 42.9° is indicative of the formation of quasi-amorphous nanocarbons. The crystalline structures of each phase in the catalysts were refined with the Rietveld method. Fig. 6 shows a typical Rietveld refinement plot of the used catalyst 50 wt.% Ni/Ce-MCM-41 with a Si/Ce molar ratio 10. Ni nanoparticles, graphitic and quasi-amorphous nanocarbons were formed in the sample. Quantitative data of the crystalline structures of metallic Ni, graphite and quasi-amorphous carbon materials determined from the Rietveld refinements are shown in Table 5 . Fig. 7 a shows the cubic unit cell used to model the Ni structure, whose symmetry corresponds to the space group Fm3m (S. G. 225). The cell parameter a is between 0.35288 and 0.35398 nm. Each cell contains 4 Ni atoms and stacking of this cell forms particles or cubic crystallites of around 40 nm in average diameter. The perspective packing drawings of the structures of carbon arrangements are shown in Fig. 7b and c. These graphite and quasi-amorphous carbons have different structures and particle sizes. The graphite carbon contributed to the formation of CNTs. As shown in Table 5, the lattice cell parameters corresponding to graphite structure vary within a small range: a, from 0.23903 nm up to 0.25191 nm, and c from 0.67900 nm up to 0.68699 nm. The primitive rhombohedral unit cell used for modelling the graphite structure, whose hexagonal symmetry corresponds to the space group P6 3/mmc. Note that the angle γ is 120° and that a hexagonal prism consists of three unit cells. Every cell contains 4 atoms of C (Z = 4). Stacking of this cell forms polyhedral crystallite particles with shape hexagonal. Their growth results in the formation of carbon nanotubes. Another kind of carbon particles with very fine particle size is of quasi-amorphous, which is usually formed in the initial stage of reaction, locating on the surfaces of the metallic Ni particles. This carbon has a reduced local order forming a hexagonal arrangement, as very small crystallites, with a symmetry corresponding to the space group P6 3/mmc. Its lattice parameters are: a between 0.25185 nm and 0.25406 nm; c between 1.63232 nm and 1.69775 nm. Each cell contains 16 carbon atoms. Stacking of this arrangement forms small clusters of carbon. The average diameter of this kind carbon clusters is approximately 5.5 nm. 3.3.2 Raman spectroscopy Raman scattering is one of the most useful and powerful techniques to characterize CNT samples. Raman scattering in carbon nanotubes involves strong resonances of the incoming and outgoing light and the vibration states with the electronic energy levels of a nanotube. The Raman spectra, therefore, carry a wealth of information about the electronic states and the phonon dispersion of CNTs. Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of the 50 wt.% Ni/Ce-MCM-41 used catalysts. Two bands around 1580 cm−1 and to 1350 cm−1 are observed. The strong peak around 1580 cm−1 corresponds to G band of the graphitic carbon arising from the zone-center E2g mode; the peak around 1350 cm−1 is assigned to D band, corresponding to A 1g zone-edge phonon induced by the disorder due to finite crystalline size [44]. Appearance of D band is a clear indication of the formation of multiwalled CNTs. The Raman spectrum further confirms that carbon nanotubes are of multiple walls with a graphitic crystalline structure, which reveals the similar information as shown by XRD analysis and the Rietveld refinement. 3.3.3 TEM images Fig. 9 shows the bright field TEM images of the tested Ni/catalysts after 1400 min of time on steam. Large quantities of nanocarbons were deposited in the catalysts during the methane decomposition. Most of the nickel particles located at the tip of the carbon nanofibers/nanotubes. After 1400 min of reaction, the exposed surfaces of the Ni particles remained still clean; therefore, they could continuously decompose methane to produce carbon nanofibers/nanotubes and hydrogen. It can be observed that the nanocarbons have multiple walls with length several hundred manometers to tens micrometers. The outer diameter of the carbon nanotubes greatly depends on the size of Ni particles: larger Ni particle leads to carbon nanotubes with larger diameter, as shown in the arrowed CNTs in Fig. 9a and inset A in Fig. 9b. The channel diameter ranged 4–7 nm, about 1/4–1/8 of the outer diameter of the tubes. Almost all of the carbon nanotubes, no matter whether it is thin or thick in wall, they are strongly curved. Some the CNTs have an open end and some have a closed end where no Ni particles are observed (Fig. 9b). As shown in Fig. 9c, some small pieces of Ni particles embedded inside the carbon tubes were observed. Most of the carbon nanofibers/nanotubes have multiple walls parallel with the axis of the carbon nanotubes; however, some of the nanocarbons have a fish-bone structure (Fig. 10 ). At least, four types of nanocarbons were observed by TEM: (i) Nanocarbons with mouth filled with Ni particle having pear-shape, which can be divided into two classes: one has carbon nanotubes with parallel layers in the walls and another has carbon walls with fish-bone arrangements. These two kinds of nanocarbons are predominant; (ii) CNTs have open end but without Ni particle on the tip; (iii) CNTs have closed end but without Ni particle on the tip; (iv) CNTs embedded small size of Ni particle inside their tubes. The simplified schematic pictures of these carbon nanotubes/nanofibers are shown in Fig. 11 ."
14,Discussion,
15,Ni particle shape variation and carbide-like phase formation,"4.1 Ni particle shape variation and carbide-like phase formation It is noteworthy that in the fresh Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts, most of the Ni particles have a shape as pseudo-sphere. However, after the reaction, the Ni particle shows a shape diamond or pear-like. The sharp tail of the Ni particle inserts into the carbon nanotube. It seems that the Ni particle becomes quasi-liquid during the reaction. As we know that the melting point of metallic Ni is 1452 °C and its Tamman temperature is around Tm = 726 °C. It is possible for a Ni particle to be fluidity only at the temperature reaching its Tamman point. Therefore, a question is naturally arisen: how can the Ni particle possess unusual fluidity at a reaction temperature far below the melting point, herein, 580 °C? It is reported that for a used Ni/SiO2 catalyst, the C1s level of the XPS spectrum consists of one bond at 281.9 eV that is attributed to carbide feature (Ni3C) and another at 284.7 eV assigned to filament carbon [45]. It is evident that Ni3C has lattice unit like hexagonal Ni crystal and it is an inactive phase for methane decomposition. Ni3C is unstable with respect to metal Ni and graphitic carbon; it, therefore, can be decomposed into a mixture of nickel and graphite at a relative low temperature, for example, 400 °C, which is even lower than the Tamman temperature of pure Ni particle [46,47]. Thus, Ni3C formation provides the possibility of Ni or/C atoms fluidity. It is proven that carbon atoms produced from CH4 decomposition over the Ni-based catalysts can form Ni x C y solid solution as intermediate due to carbon atoms dissolution into the bulk Ni; at such condition, C atoms are able to move within the Ni particles and they are then released from the Ni x C y solid solution to form graphitic structure in the support–metal interface [45]. The Rietveld refinements of our used catalysts confirm that the largest lattice cell parameter of metallic Ni in our catalysts is a = 0.35389 nm with a maximal volume (V m) of a close-packed arrangement of approximately 0.044354 nm3. It seems to be an insufficient room for carbon atom (C atom radii is 0.077 nm) locating in the octahedral voids of Ni crystal. However it is noteworthy that when C atoms transfer within Ni crystals, the lattice constituents oscillating must be produced. Therefore, the temperature of the Ni particle surface is at an overheat state with respect to its surrounding temperature because of the continuous release of heat energy during the CH4 decomposition. Such a lattice constituents oscillating is equivalent to temperature elevation in the Ni crystal system to form hot spots. As a result, the Ni-C system may transfer into a quasi-liquid state at a reaction temperature even lower than the Tamman temperature inherent in it. Now, the second question encounters: what is the driving force to allow the carbon diffusion within the Ni particle? There must have a gradient of carbide concentration in the Ni particles during the MCD reaction, therefore, pressure can be built up at the internal surface of the graphitic envelope, due to the continuous formation of graphite layers. The mass transfer of carbon occurred by diffusion through the bulk particle under the effect of carbon concentration gradient, drives the Ni particles to be squeezed out. The movement of the C atoms along the Ni particles through both the surface and bulk towards the interface induces the Ni sphere changing to pear-like shape."
16,Mechanisms of various nanocarbons formation,"4.2 Mechanisms of various nanocarbons formation 4.2.1 Nanocarbons with end filled with Ni particles [48] It is well recognized that in the MCD reaction, C–H bonds in methane are broken down on the surface of the Ni active phases of the Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts, producing carbon atoms and hydrogen. In one hand, some of the carbon atoms may spread on the surface of Ni particles and move towards the metal–support interface; in the other hand, some of carbon atoms may be dissolved into the Ni particle to form Ni x C y metastable solid solution as intermediate which may be decomposed to release Ni and C at the interface between metal particle and support, where carbon atoms are constructed to form nanotubes by precipitation, nucleation and crystallization. As the reaction proceeds, more carbon atoms are released in the metal–support interface that forces the carbon nanotubes to continuously grow, which supports the Ni particle on the tip of the CNTs. The graphite layers contacting the Ni particle oriented along 40–60° angles parallel with the surface of the Ni particle (Fig. 10a). In the portion contacting the Ni particle, the graphite layers show as fish-bones arrangements. After their growth went beyond the Ni particle dimension, they changed to parallel with the axis of the tubes in the rest part. However, some carbon nanofibers with complete fish-bone structures are also observed (Fig. 10b). This widely accepted model also explains why Ni particles are often located at the tip of one end of carbon nanotubes. 4.2.2 Carbon nanotubes with open end It was observed that some of the carbon nanotubes have an open end. The shape of the open end is the same or very similar as pear-shape of Ni particle (Fig. 9b). Therefore, the open end is probably formed due to the Ni releasing from the carbon tube end in certain reasons, for example, mechanical disturbing. Formation mechanism of the carbon nanotubes with open end is assumed to be the same as those with carbon nanotube filled with Ni particles as described above. 4.2.3 Carbons nanotubes embedding small pieces of Ni particles Some of the carbon nanotubes were found to embed small pieces of metallic Ni particles (Fig. 9c). It is assumed that some of the Ni particles are strongly interacted with the support and they are deeply anchored into the support and are difficult for motion. Methane decomposition reaction occurs on the exposed surface of such kind Ni particles to form Ni x C y metastable solid solution intermediate. As the Ni x C y is continuously formed and accumulated, C atoms are released due to decomposition of the metastable C x Ni y intermediate in the other side of the exposed surface of the Ni particles, but not in the interface between the lower potion of Ni particle and support as usual. In such case, the carbon nanotubes are constructed in the surface of the Ni particle towards gas–solid interface. As a result, the Ni particle is fixed in the support but leaving carbon tube growing with a closed end (Fig. 12 , Path A). The tails of the quasi-liquid Ni x C y particles are easy to be split into several parts, some of which can be enclosed into tubes. Similar phenomenon was also observed in the Fe/Al2O3 catalysts [49]. In the methane catalytic decomposition, the formed Ni carbide in our Ni/Ce-MCM-41 catalysts may be decomposed into supersaturation of the Ni particle with carbon that results in the emergence of graphite nucleus and then layers on the Ni particles. These graphitic layers are initially oriented in parallel to the particle surface, they are, however, distorted and their orientation may change to form a hollow structure. As the carbon nanotubes grow further, its part in contact with the particle becomes narrowed and the tail of the metal particle is pulled inside the carbon capsule, forming a small piece of Ni particle encapsulated in the carbon tube with diameter the same as the inner diameter of the carbon tube. 4.2.4 Nanocarbons with closed end without Ni particle on the tip There are some carbon nanotubes having a closed end without Ni particle on the tip nor small pieces of Ni particles embedded inside them (Fig. 12, path B). It is believed that the formation of these kind carbon nanotubes follows a similar pathway as the ones encapsulating small pieces of Ni particles. However, due to interaction between Ni particle and support is different, the strong interaction between them makes Ni particle difficult to move, hence, some of metals are strongly fixed in the support and the carbon tubes have to grow towards the solid–gas interface. As for whether or not the carbon nanotubes contain small pieces of Ni particle, it might depend on the reaction temperature and degree of the interaction between Ni particle and support. Usually, higher reaction temperature favors the formation of carbon tubes embedding small pieces of Ni; if the Ni particle is deeply anchored into the support, only small part of the surface is exposed to the reaction atmosphere, the interaction between Ni particle and support is rather strong, these metal particles are difficult to be cut off into small pieces and thus the formed carbon nanotubes do not embed any pieces of small Ni particle."
17,Conclusions,"Ce-MCM-41 mesoporous materials with large surface area and ordered pore structure system could be synthesized through a surfactant-assisted approach. In the methane decomposition reaction, the catalytic activity of the Ni/Ce-MCM-41−x (x = Si/Ce molar ratio = 20, 10, and 5) catalysts show high catalytic stability. During the 1400 min of reaction, no obvious catalytic deactivation was observed. Both nanocarbons with graphitic structure and quasi-amorphous carbon were formed in the evaluated catalysts. The carbon nanotubes have 30–50 nm in diameters and hundred nanometers to tens micrometers in length and all the carbon nanotubes consist of multiple layer walls. Most of the metallic Ni particles are located at the tip of carbon nanotubes and their exposed surface remain clean after 1400 min of reaction, which explains the high catalytic stability of these catalysts. Several types of carbon nanotubes/nanofibiers were formed in the tested catalysts. Their formation mechanisms greatly depended on the reaction temperature and degree of the interaction between the metallic Ni and the support."
