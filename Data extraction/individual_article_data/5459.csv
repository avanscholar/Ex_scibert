0,Introduction,"Lignin is one of the major wastes generated in the paper and pulp industry and second generation bioethanol refineries, and the valorization of lignin is one of the foremost sustainable ways to attain carbon neutrality. Lignin is one of the simplest carbon-based energy sources to obtain high-value chemicals. Even though various thermochemical and catalytic technologies such as hydrolysis, oxidation, pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrogenolysis are available to obtain high value chemicals from lignin [1,2], hydrogenolysis is an emerging and sustainable pathway to obtain chemicals selectively at high atom economy. In lignin, phenolic monomers are linked via different linkages, viz., β-O-4, α-O-4, 4-O-5, α-1, β-1, and β-β [2,3]. Due to this complex structure of lignin, selectively obtaining monomers is one of the major challenges. Researchers are continuously studying various catalyst systems for hydrogenolysis, right from the homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysts [4]. Recent studies on heterogeneous catalysts have shown that the combination of active hydrogenation metals and transition metals exhibits superior activity for lignin hydrogenolysis. The active hydrogenation metals are usually Ni, Fe, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru [4]. Literature studies show that, NiM-based (M = Pd, Pt, Re, and Ru) bimetallic catalyst systems are effective for the cleavage of C-O linkages in lignin [4,5]. Similarly, the bifunctional catalysts obtained by combining active hydrogenation metals with transition metals like Mo, W, Zr, Al, and Co in the form of metal salts, metal oxides and metal carbides enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of CO bonds in lignin [6–10]. Ni-based catalysts are used extensively due to its cost-effectiveness, while Pd-based catalysts are also active and lead to aromatic ring hydrogenation. A small quantity of Pd along with other metals substantially decreases the overall cost of the catalyst. The use of bifunctional catalysts results in high lignin depolymerization rate and phenolic monomer selectivity [6–9]. Tymchyshyn et al. [11] demonstrated that the hydrodeoxygenated phenolic monomers were obtained selectively when MoRu/activated carbon bimetallic catalyst was used than a monometallic catalyst, due to synergism between Mo and Ru. PtRe/TiO2 bimetallic catalyst exhibits high selectivity to propyl syringol (PS) with 100% selectivity to β-O-4 bonds cleavage [12]. The synergistic effect between Pt and MgO (basic support) led to the formation of C8 phenolic monomers from C9 phenolic monomers via decarboxylation [13]. Similarly, the base-promoted hydrogenolysis of lignin with Ru/carbon resulted in CC bond cleavage, and selectivity towards low carbon C8 phenolic monomers [14]. The CC bond cleavage in phenolic monomers is driven by the electron transfer from Ni0 to C-support in Ni/carbon catalyst [15]. In the presence of NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, high selectivity to 4-propyl guaiacol (PG) was observed, in which CC bond cleavage was suppressed [16]. In the presence of Ni on Al-doped mesoporous silica nanospheres catalyst, selective hydrogenolysis CO bond was detected, and the selectivity to PS was increased with decrease in selectivity to propanol syringol (PohS) [17]. In another study, using Ni/ZrP-2.0 (P/Zr = 2.0) catalyst resulted in high selectivity to 4-ethyl phenol, and the char formation increased with P/Zr ratio [18]. Traditional supports such as metal oxides, zeolites, silica, mixed oxides and carbon-based supports are widely studied [19,20]. Supports are usually chosen based on the acidic and basic properties. Supports with high Brønsted acidity lead to better lignin conversion, but this also leads to repolymerisation/condensation of phenolic monomers, thus resulting in decreased selectivity to phenolic monomers. Similarly, a wide range of solvents were studied, and among which, methanol and isopropyl alcohol are shown to be prominent for hydrogenolysis. With inappropriate solvents, the solubility of phenolic monomers will decrease, and thereby lignin conversion would also decrease leading to more char formation. High Brønsted acidity and low phenolic monomer solubility lead to high char formation due to self-condensation and repolymerisation of monomers [9,18]. Catalyst properties such as acidity, redox potential, and metal-support interactions play a crucial role in catalytic activity. In this study, for the first time, Lewis acid metal oxides (ZrO2, WO x , and MoO3) are used as secondary active metal sites along with Pd on activated biochar catalyst for lignin hydrogenolysis. These bifunctional catalysts are thoroughly characterized for their structure, acidity, particle size, surface area and porosity, metal dispersion, metal concentration and reducing ability. The phenolic monomer selectivities are examined with various catalysts, and the effect of Lewis acid metal oxides on C9 phenolic monomer distribution is also studied. The active metal vs its activity for specific phenolic compound production are discussed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, potassium hydroxide (KOH), nitric acid (HNO3) and zirconium nitrate (Zr(NO3)4) were purchased from Merck, India. Alkali lignin or Kraft lignin (henceforth denoted as lignin), ammonium metatungstate hydrate (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O), palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2), acetovanillone, 4-ethyl guaiacol, eugenol, guaiacol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy phenylacetone, cis-isoeugenol, trans-isoeugenol, 4-methyl guaiacol, methyl vanillate, 4-propyl guaiacol, vanillin, and commercial activated carbon (CAC) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. 4-Propanol guaiacol was purchased from TCI Chemicals (India) Pvt. Ltd. The chemicals used for the preparation of catalysts were of reagent grade, and used as received."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of activated biochar The activated biochar (ABC) was prepared from biochar, which was obtained by microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass [21]. The obtained pyrolysis biochar was subjected to size reduction up to 300 μm average particle size using a ball mill. The ABC was prepared by HNO3 and KOH treatment methods following the procedure described elsewhere with modifications [22]. Metal oxides and inorganic ash impurities were removed from the biochar in a step-by-step process. Initially, 15 g of biochar was mixed with 1 M HNO3 (300 mL). The dispersed solid solution was heated to 80 °C under continuous stirring for 12 h. The obtained solid solution was filtered and washed till the filtrate reached neutral pH, and finally dried at 110 °C. The dried solid was mixed with 10 wt% KOH (300 mL), and the solution was heated to 80 °C under continuous stirring for 24 h. This step aids in the removal of silica present in biochar. The solution was filtered and washed till the filtrate reached neutral pH and dried at 110 °C. The obtained solid residue is the activated biochar, named as ABC. 2.2.2 Metal oxide loading over ABC The wetness impregnation method was adopted to obtain 5 wt% of metal on ABC. 2 g of ABC was dispersed in 40 mL of distilled water. To this, the required amount of metal precursor (e.g., Zr(NO3)4) was added. The solution was stirred for 6 h at 70 °C in an oil bath. Water was then removed under vacuum at 65 °C, and the solid obtained was dried at 60 °C in a hot air oven. The sample was calcined in a tubular furnace at 300 °C for 3 h, at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, under a continuous flow of air at 30 mL min−1. This procedure was also adopted for loading of 5 wt% of Mo (using (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O precursor) and W (using (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O precursor). The obtained samples were named as 5Zr/ABC, 5Mo/ABC, and 5W/ABC. 2.2.3 Palladium loading over metal oxide impregnated ABC 2 wt% of Pd was also loaded using the wetness impregnation method. The protocol was similar to the loading of metal oxides on the support as described in Section 2.2.2. After the dry solid powder was obtained, it was calcined and reduced in a hydrogen environment (30 mL min−1) in a tubular furnace at 300 °C (heating rate of 2 °C min−1) for 3 h. Accordingly, 2 wt% of Pd on (a) 5 wt% Zr/ABC, (b) 5 wt% Mo/ABC and (c) 5 wt% W/ABC were prepared, and they were named as 2Pd-5Zr/ABC, 2Pd-5Mo/ABC and 2Pd-5W/ABC, respectively. Similarly, 2 wt% of Pd was loaded directly on ABC, which was named as 2Pd/ABC."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer using Ni filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA). The system was equipped with an integrated multi-mode EIGER2 detector. The 2θ range was 10–90°, and the scan rate was 5 °C min−1. The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by the N2 physisorption technique using a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ instrument. The analysis was performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C), and the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used. Before analysis, the samples were degassed at 300 °C in vacuum for 3 h. The isotherms were analyzed in the relative pressure range of 0.05 to 0.30. The metal crystallite size and the dispersion of the catalysts were measured using CO chemisorption in the same Quantachrome Autosorb IQ instrument. Before the analysis, the catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 at 300 °C for 2 h. The samples were further evacuated at 300 °C for 2 h, followed by subsequent cooling to 40 °C, and the adsorption isotherms were recorded. The average crystallite size and dispersion were measured using the volume of gas chemisorbed per gram of metal using an established procedure [23]. Proximate analysis of biochars was carried out according to the ASTM E1131-08 method in a TG analyzer (TGA-2000A, Navas Instruments, U.S.A.). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the catalyst samples was performed in a TG analyzer (SDT Q600, T.A. Instruments). The measurement was carried out in N2 ambience (100 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using c.a. 5 mg of sample. The acidity of the catalysts was determined by temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3–TPD) in a Micromeritics Autochem-2920 instrument. Before TPD measurements, the sample was activated at 300 °C in He (40 mL min−1) for 1 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 50 °C, and NH3 was sorbed by exposing the samples to a stream of 10% NH3 in He (30 mL min−1) for 0.5 h. The temperature was then increased to 100 °C and flushed with He for 1 h at 100 °C to remove the physisorbed NH3. The desorption of NH3 was carried out in He flow (40 mL min−1) by increasing the temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. The concentration of NH3 desorbed was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pyridine diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy experiments were conducted using NICOLET iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific). Pyridine adsorption was measured by taking the sample in a high vacuum cell, and activated at 300 °C in presene of N2 (20 mL min−1). The sample was then cooled to 100 °C and a spectrum was recorded without pyridine adsorption. While cooling down from 100 to 50 °C, 30 μL of pyridine was injected through the N2 line. The temperature was again raised to 100 °C, and the physisorbed pyridine was evacuated for 1 h. The temperature was further increased to 240 °C, and a spectrum was recorded after 15 min at 240 °C. The pyridine adsorption spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum obtained at 100 °C without pyridine from that obtained at 240 °C with pyridine. The reduction temperature of palladium catalysts was measured by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) in the Micromeritics Autochem-2920 instrument. Before the TPR experiment, the sample was activated at 300 °C by passing 5% O2 in Ar (40 mL min−1) for 2 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 100 °C, and reduction was carried out using 5% H2 in Ar (40 mL min−1) by increasing the temperature to 900 °C at 10 °C min−1. The concentration of H2 was monitored using a TCD. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained using a JEM-2100 Plus instrument (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. The samples for HRTEM measurements were prepared by placing a droplet of the sample suspension (prepared in isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonication) on a carbon-coated copper grid, followed by drying at room temperature. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300 DV. All the samples were digested in aqua regia solution. WOx and MoOx samples were digested using HNO3: HF (1:1 v/v) solution. Standard solutions containing different elements were used for calibration. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of lignin was recorded using a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Model AVANCE AVIII) equipped with a dual carbon/proton (CPDUL) cryoprobe. Approximately, 0.1 g of lignin was dissolved in 1.0 mL dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. Two-dimensional (2D) 1H-13C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) NMR spectra were obtained using the hsqcetgp pulse program. The spectral widths were 165 ppm (20831 Hz) and 7.8 ppm (3937 Hz) for the 13C and 1H dimensions, respectively. 1024 and 256 points were collected for 1H and 13C, respectively, with a relaxation delay of 0.2 s and 16 scans. The 1 J CH was 140 Hz. The solvent peak (DMSO) was used as an internal chemical shift reference point (δC/δH 39.5/2.49)."
5,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests Hydrogenolysis of lignin was carried out in a 100 mL autoclave made of Inconel alloy (Amar Instruments, India). The reactor was equipped with an internal cooling coil, K-type thermocouple, and a turbine blade stirrer. The reaction vessel was charged with the required amount of lignin (0.5 g), catalyst (0.1 g), and methanol (40 mL). The Pd-to-lignin ratio used in this study corresponds to 0.44%. Before the reaction, the autoclave was flushed 5 times with hydrogen gas to remove the residual gases. The autoclave was then pressurized to 3.0 MPa while stirring the contents at 600 rpm before heating it to 240 °C. Reaction time was noted once the autoclave reached the set temperature. After the completion of the reaction, heating was stopped, stirrer speed was decreased to 100 rpm, and cold water was circulated through the cooling coil. This was continued till the autoclave temperature reached <35 °C. The schematic representation of monomer and product separation protocol is presented in Fig. 1 . Briefly, the reaction mixture was collected in a beaker after washing the contents multiple times with methanol. The obtained reaction mixture was filtered through a Whatman filter paper (grade A), and the residue was dried in an oven at 65 °C. This residue contains the catalyst and unconverted/partially depolymerized lignin, and the filtrate contains the products. The solvent was removed at 50 °C under vacuum, and the obtained slurry was again dissolved in ethyl acetate. This aids in dissolving the lignin hydrogenolysis products and the unreacted is precipitated. This solution was filtered, and the mass of solubles was calculated. The solution obtained was made up to 25 mL in a volumetric flask, and was injected in a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the products. The experiments were repeated three times, and the standard deviations in the conversion and liquid yield were within 3–5%. The following calculations were performed to determine the lignin conversion, the yield of liquid products, and the mass balance achieved. (1) Lignin c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = W L - W UL W L × 100 (2) Liquid y i e l d ( w t . % ) = W LQ W L × 100 (3) Mass b a l a n c e ( % ) = W LQ + W UL W L × 100 In the above expressions, WUL , WL , and WLQ denote the mass of unconverted lignin, initial mass of lignin, and mass of liquid products, respectively."
6,Product characterization,"2.5 Product characterization GC/MS (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus and QP2020) equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) was used to separate the components in the product mixture. Helium (99.9995%) was used as the carrier gas at a column flow rate of 1.49 mL min−1. The column oven was held isothermally at 45 °C for 1 min, ramped up to 250 °C at 5 °C min−1, and finally held at 250 °C for 10 min. The injector, MS ion source, and interface temperatures were set at 280, 250, and 280 °C, respectively. The compounds were recorded in the mass range from 50 to 500 Da. Nine major and six minor phenolic monomers were identified and quantified. The match factors of the identified compounds with respect to the NIST library of mass spectra were high (>90%). The concentrations of the identified phenolic monomers in the soluble liquid mixture were determined by constructing calibration graphs using pure compounds, and determining the response factors. A total of twelve compounds, viz., acetovanillone, eugenol, 4-ethyl guaiacol, guaiacol, cis-isoeugenol, trans-isoeugenol, 4-methyl guaiacol, methyl vanillate, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy phenylacetone, 4-propanol guaiacol, 4-propyl guaiacol, and vanillin were used as calibration standards. An average response factor obtained from standards was considered for other compounds, viz., ethyl guaiacol, propiovanillone, methyl homo vanillate, 4-ethenyl-2-methoxyphenol, ethylbenzene, 4-ethyl-phenol, and phenol [24]. Using the response factors of individual compounds, the wt.% yield of a monomer and its % selectivity were calculated using the following expressions.

7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD profiles of untreated biochar, activated biochar, and Pd/metal oxide loaded biochar catalysts. Crystalline oxide impurities of Si, Al, Zn, and Ti were observed with untreated biochar [25]. The presence of these oxides results in a high amount of ash (23.9 wt%) in untreated biochar. After chemical treatment of biochar, the ash content was reduced to 4.4 wt% and carbon was enriched (Table 1 ). From the XRD of ABC, there is clear evidence for the amorphous nature of carbon due to the broad peak at 2θ 22°. A small crystalline carbon peak was observed at 2θ 26.6°. From Fig. 2b and c, it is observed that there are no characteristic diffractions found for WO x in 5W/ABC and 2Pd-5W/ABC, and ZrO2 in 5Zr/ABC and 2Pd-5Zr/ABC. This is an evidence for good dispersion of metal oxides over the ABC. Molybdenum oxide exhibits different diffractions in 5Mo/ABC (Fig. 2d). The peaks at 2θ 12.4, 23.5, 25.9, 27.1 and 34.9° correspond to MoO3 (JCPDS: 85-2405), while the peaks at 2θ 18.5, 22.1, 24.8 and 38.6° correspond to Mo4O11 (JCPDS: 13-0142). All the reduced Pd-loaded catalysts exhibit characteristic diffractions for Pd0 at 2θ 39.9, 46.4, 68.0, and 81.8° (JCPDS: 46-1043). In the case of reduced 2Pd-5Mo/ABC, a stable oxide form of MoO3 at 2θ 12.4, 23.5, 25.9, 27.1, and 34.9° (JCPDS: 85-2405) was obtained. The crystallite size of Pd0 was measured by the Scherrer formula for the (111) plane. The crystallite size of Pd0 in 2Pd/ABC was 18.8 nm. The following trend was observed with the addition of different metals: 22.3 nm (2Pd-5Zr/ABC) < 27.8 nm (2Pd-5W/ABC) < 28.3 nm (2Pd-5Mo/ABC). This shows that the addition of secondary metal oxides influences the crystallite size of Pd0. The multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area data of the catalysts show no significant increase in the surface area of activated biochar due to chemical treatment (Table 2 ). However, chemical treatment is essential to reduce the inorganics from 23.9 to 4.4 wt% with a simultaneous increase in fixed carbon from 57.3 to 67.5 wt% (Table 1). BET surface area is improved for the metal oxide loaded catalysts compared to untreated biochar; further, it is improved for the Pd loaded catalysts. In order to understand the increase in BET surface area, the ABC was reduced at 300 °C in presence of H2 (30 mL) for 3 h, and analyzed. Interestingly, the BET surface area of the reduced ABC increased to 65 m2 g−1 from 31 m2 g−1 for the unreduced sample. This is due to the possible reconstruction of biochar in hydrogen ambience at high temperatures under reducing conditions. This is supported by Gurrath et al. [26] who reported an increase in surface area of different carbon supports after H2 pretreatment. The further increase in the surface area of metal-loaded catalysts is due to the dispersion of metal, which contributes to the increase in BET surface area. Similar increase in BET surface area was observed by Mishra et al. after loading Pd onto mesoporous titania-alumina catalyst [27]. The average crystallite size of Pd0 based on CO chemisorption measurement was 11.4 nm for 2Pd/ABC, and this increased to 16.9 nm, 20.6 nm, and 22.0 nm for 2Pd-5Zr/ABC, 2Pd-5W/ABC, and 2Pd-5Mo/ABC, respectively. This trend is in line with the crystallite size calculated using the (111) diffraction plane from XRD. Interestingly, the Pd0 metal dispersion decreased with the addition of secondary metal oxides. High Pd0 metal dispersion (19.4%) was observed in the case of 2Pd/ABC. The CO adsorption isotherm used to calculate the metal dispersion is shown in Fig. S1 (in Supplementary Material). The wt.% of Pd and other metal oxides loaded over the support are given in Table 2. The thermal stability of Pd-loaded catalysts was evaluated by performing TGA in inert N2 atmosphere (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Material). It is evident that the mass loss exhibited by all the metal-loaded catalysts at 300 °C, which is above the typical hydrogenolysis temperature, is within 3.0%. At the final temperature of 800 °C, the mass loss exhibited by the Pd-loaded catalysts was in the range of 17.3–19.5%. The reduction behavior of Pd-loaded catalysts with secondary metal oxides was studied using TPR experiments. The maximum reduction temperature (Tmax) varied in the range of 200–360 °C for 2Pd/ABC, 2Pd-5W/ABC, and 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalysts (Fig. 3 a). This suggests the strong interaction between Pd and the support. Literature shows that the reduction temperature peaks are proportional to metal–oxygen bond strengths. The Pd reduction was initiated at lower temperatures (170 °C) for 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, which demonstrates the ease of Pd reduction, and this is attributed to the metal-support interactions [28]. In the case of 2Pd-5Mo/ABC, two reduction temperatures are observed at Tmax of 180 and 300 °C. Two different reduction peaks arise due to reduction of Pd oxide at different sites over the support or the existence of PdO of different crystallite sizes [28]. The reduction of Pd2+ to Pd0 takes place in a single step. The low-temperature reduction peak can be related to reducing PdO species that weakly interact with the support, while the high-temperature peak can be assigned to the reduction of PdO species that interacts strongly with the support [28,29]. Wang et al. [29] made a similar observation for the high-temperature reduction peaks. This can also be assigned to the hydrogen spillover from Pd0 to other metals or the strong Pd-secondary metal interaction. This is supported by the results of Zhang et al. [30] who showed that two reduction peaks of Pt were observed in Pt/nMoOx/MgO catalyst. This was attributed to monolayer coverage of MoO3 species that transfered an electron to reduce Pt, and the electronic interaction between Pt and Mo species [30]. The total acidity of the catalysts was measured using NH3-TPD experiments. From the TPD profiles, three distinct desorption peaks were observed for all the catalysts (Fig. 3b and c). The desorption peaks are attributed to weak adsorption (100–250 °C, D1), moderate adsorption (250–500/550 °C, D2), and decomposition of support (>500/550 °C, D3) respectively. The D1 and D2 desorption peaks arise due to weak and moderate acidic sites present over the catalyst, respectively. The D3 desorption peak arises due to the decomposition of support at high temperatures, which was verified by subjecting ABC support to TPD experiment without adsorbing NH3 (Fig. 3b, dashed line). All desorption curves were deconvoluted, and the amount of NH3 desorbed below 550 °C was considered to determine the acidity of the catalyst (Table 2). The total acidity of Lewis metal oxides-loaded catalysts followed the trend: 5W/ABC < 5Zr/ABC < 5Mo/ABC. The acidity of metal oxides depends on the total metal content, oxidation state of the metal, dispersion, particle size, and metal-support interactions. In an earlier study, pyridine-FTIR characterization revealed that the presence of ≥ 5 wt% MoO3 enhances the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst [31]. Accordingly, the high acidity of the Mo-based catalyst can be attributed to the Brønsted acidity. Total acidity of Pd-loaded catalysts followed a similar trend as metal oxide-loaded catalysts (2Pd-5W/ABC ≈ 2Pd-5Zr/ABC < 2Pd-5Mo/ABC). It is, therefore, evident that acidity decreases after Pd loading over the metal oxides, which is due to partial blockage of acidic sites of metal oxides by Pd0. Fig. 3d shows the pyridine-DRIFT characterization of Pd-loaded catalysts at 240 °C. The strong adsorption band at 1430–1440 cm−1 corresponds to the Lewis acidity (LA) imparted by the metal oxides. The adsorption at 1545 cm−1, which usually corresponds to pyridinium ions at strong Brønsted acid sites, was absent for all the catalysts [32]. However, pyridinium ions at weak Brønsted acid (BA) sites were confirmed by the peak at 1658 cm−1 for 2Pd-5Mo/ABC catalyst. These results are in agreement with earlier reports [31,33]. Therefore, the increase in total acidity of Mo-based catalysts is due to the rise in Brønsted acid sites, which corroborates the NH3-TPD results. The HRTEM images of Pd-loaded catalysts were recorded to understand the metal lattice parameters. The HRTEM images of all as-prepared catalysts show the dispersion of spherical Pd0 (Fig. 4 a-d) and metal oxide particles (Fig. 4b-d) at different magnifications. In 2Pd/ABC catalyst, lattice fringes correspond to d-spacing of 0.22 nm for Pd0, and can be assigned to the face-centered cubic crystalline plane of (111) of Pd0. The same was observed for 2Pd-5Zr/ABC, 2Pd-5Mo/ABC, and 2Pd-5W/ABC catalysts. Interestingly, edge-sharing of lattice fringes for Pd0 and the secondary metal oxides was observed (Fig. 4b-d). The diffraction planes of the metal oxides were assigned based on the d-spacing values obtained from the lattice fringes. The crystal structures of the metal oxides can be assigned as cubic for ZrO2, and orthorhombic for MoO3 and WO2.6 (JCPDS: 49-1642, 75-0912, and 81-1172)."
9,Lignin characterization,"3.2 Lignin characterization The structural linkages and the functional groups present in the lignin was examined using the 2D-HSQC NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 5 ). The cross-signals of 13C–1H in the HSQC spectra of lignin shows various functional groups (guaiacol units and methoxy) and linkages (β–β, β–O–4, α–O–4, and β–5). The G2, G5 and G6 carbon-hydrogen cross-signals of the aromatic ring of guaiacol were observed at 113.0/7.0 ppm, 115.0/6.7 ppm, and 120.0/6.8 ppm, respectively [34]. Similarly, the signal corresponding to methoxyl group (OCH3) of the guaiacol units was observed at 56.0/3.7 ppm [34]. The various linkages such as β–β, β–O–4, α–O–4, and β–5 were observed in the region 50–90/2.5–5.5 ppm. This proves the abundance of G units in lignin. In our earlier studies, this lignin sample is shown to possess molecular weight in the range of 2500–600 g mol−1 [35], and contain mostly G-units with insignificant S-units [36]."
10,Catalytic activity for lignin hydrogenolysis,"3.3 Catalytic activity for lignin hydrogenolysis 3.3.1 Effect of different catalysts Depolymerization of lignin to monomeric phenols was conducted using different catalysts. Based on the literature, optimized reaction conditions were chosen for the catalytic activity test, such as reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure and methanol solvent. Initially, lignin was subjected to hydrogenolysis without any catalyst, and a low lignin conversion of ~31% was obtained. The liquid yield was also low, and the selectivities to guaiacol and t-isoeugenol (t-IEug) were 10.9% and 13.9%, respectively (Table 3 ). When N2 was used instead of H2, the lignin conversion increased to 46.6% with similar liquid yield (30 wt%). High selectivities to guaiacol (23.9%) and vanillin derivatives (17.6%) were observed. The absence of H2 basically results in transfer hydrogenolysis, which alters the phenolic distribution. Due to non-selective cleavage of lignin, vanillin derivatives (15.3%) and other phenolic monomers (17.1%) were obtained in the absence of catalyst with H2. Generally, the simultaneous cleavage of multiple bonds like β–O–4, α–O–4, β–1 and α–1 result in guaiacol and vanillin derivatives. The high selectivity to guaiacol is due to decarboxylation and demethoxylation of alkyl guaiacols in the absence of catalyst [37]. Vanillin esters like methyl vanillate and methyl homovanillate were formed in reasonable selectivity (8–10%) when no catalyst was used, which indicates their possible formation via esterification reaction with the solvent. Extractives, such as terpenes and terpenoids, and heavy products (or heavies), like dimers and oligomers, were also observed. The structures of various phenolic monomers, extractives, heavies and other compounds that were detected and quantified in this study are given in Fig. 6 . Lignin hydrogenolysis experiments were also performed using untreated biochar, ABC, and commercial activated carbon as catalysts. The conversion of lignin increased from 47.6% with untreated biochar to 58.3% with the ABC catalyst (Table 3). The liquid yield obtained using untreated biochar was also low (31.5%), and was similar to that obtained without using any catalyst. High selectivity to 4-propanol guaiacol (PohG) was obtained with untreated biochar, which may be due to the metals present in the inorganic ash that aids in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In the case of ABC catalyst, high selectivities to t-IEug and PohG were obtained. With CAC catalyst the liquid yield was relatively low (38%) as compared to that using ABC (47.8%). However, the yield and selectivity to t-IEug were high with CAC (9.1 wt%, 23.4%, respectively) as compared to that from ABC (5.7 wt%, ~12%). Further investigation was performed using metal oxide (MOx) loaded-ABC catalysts. With MOx/ABC catalysts, the conversion slightly decreased compared to that with ABC catalyst and liquid yield also decreased concurrently. The decrease in lignin conversion can be attributed to the repolymerisation of phenolic monomers caused by the acidity of the 5Mo/ABC catalyst. Both lignin converted and liquid yield decreased by ~10% with 5W/ABC and 5Zr/ABC catalysts. The selectivities to guaiacol and t-IEug were high with 5W/ABC and 5Zr/ABC catalysts, while t-IEug formed selectively (30.2%) with 5Mo/ABC catalyst. The lignin conversion increased to 65.3% when 2Pd/ABC catalyst was used. High selectivities to C9 phenolic monomers like PG (15.3%) and PohG (17%) were obtained, and the selectivity to t-IEug (4.4%) was low. From C9 monomer selectivity, it can be concluded that Pd-based active metal catalysts result in hydroxyl-substituted C9 phenolic monomers of guaiacol/syringol units, which is in line with Li et al. [7]. With the addition of Lewis acid metals and Pd to ABC, the conversion of lignin increased slightly (67–69%) with slightly lower liquid yields (48–52 wt%) as compared to that with 2Pd/ABC catalyst. Interestingly, significant changes in phenolic monomers selectivity were observed (Table 3). The 2Pd-5Mo/ABC catalyst demonstrated high selectivity to t-IEug (23.9%) and PG (13.4%). Similarly, 2Pd-5W/ABC exhibited high selectivity to PG (16.4%) with slightly low t-IEug (14.2%) as compared to 2Pd-5Mo/ABC. Whereas, in the presence of 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, high yield and selectivity to PG (10 wt%, 19.4%) and PohG (8.3 wt%, 16%) were observed. The yield of C9 phenolic monomers (t-IEug + PG) formed via dehydroxylation pathway followed the trend: 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (17.9 wt%) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (15.1 wt%) > 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (12.8 wt%) > 2Pd/ABC (10.7 wt%). This result is in agreement with the order of Lewis acidity of the catalysts obtained from the pyridine-FTIR study. The GC/MS spectra of the liquid product, and mass spectra of the individual compounds obtained using 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst are shown in Fig. S3 (in Supplementary Material). All the catalysts exhibited 4% selectivity to methyl guaiacol due to the cleavage of Cα-Cβ or β-1 bond. With all the catalysts, the selectivity to ethyl guaiacol was similar (8.8–9.7%). Its formation can be traced to Cβ-Cγ bond cleavage. The synergistic effects of the catalysts were confirmed by performing the experiments using isolated metal catalysts (2Pd/ABC + 5Zr/ABC), and the results are shown in Table 3. With 2Pd/ABC + 5Zr/ABC, the fraction of lignin converted was still lower (59.1%) than that using 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (68.9%) and 2Pd/ABC (65.3%) catalysts. Higher selectivity to t-IEug (22.5%) was observed with the physically mixed 2Pd/ABC + 5Zr/ABC, while 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst demonstrates high selectivity to PG due to the synergism of the metal oxide with Pd. The yield and selectivity of PG followed the trend: 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (10 wt%, 19.4%) > 5Zr/ABC + 2Pd/ABC (7.8 wt%, 15.8%) ≈ 2Pd/ABC (8.3 wt%, 15.3%) > 5Zr/ABC (0.6 wt%, 2.0%). Similar synergetic activity was observed with metal salts and heterogenized Lewis acidic centers and Pd-based catalysts [38–40]. The yields of all the phenolic monomers from lignin using different catalysts are given in Table S1 (in Supplementary Material). 3.3.2 Effect of reaction time on phenolic monomers selectivity The effect of reaction time was evaluated with every catalyst in order to optimize the selectivity to phenolic monomers (Fig. 7 ). With all the catalysts, the maximum conversion of lignin was obtained at 3 h, after which there was a drop in lignin conversion, which is due to repolymerization of the monomeric and oligomeric fractions. Interestingly, clear trends are observed in the selectivity to the phenolic monomers with increase in reaction time. With the 2Pd/ABC catalyst, there is an obvious decrease in selectivity to C9 phenolic monomers as the reaction time is increased from 2 h to 4 h. Consequently, selectivities to C8 and C7 phenolic monomers are increased. Notably, the selectivity to vanillin derivatives increased from 11.5% to 21.2%. High selectivity to t-IEug (8.6%), PohG (20.0%) and PG (14.4%) was obtained at 2 h. The gradual decrease in selectivity of C9 monomeric phenols, and increase in C8 and C7 phenolic monomers observed from 2 h to 3 h shows that longer reaction time results in the cleavage of propyl side chain of the C9 phenols to produce phenols with low carbon number. Similarly, an increase in time drastically decreases the total phenolic monomer selectivity. This can be related to the increased production of heavies, which include oligomers and condensed ring high molecular weight phenolics. Their selectivity followed the trend: 18.5% (4 h) > 15.6% (3 h) > 11.6% (2 h). With 2Pd-5Mo/ABC catalyst, a drastic increase in the lignin conversion was observed from 2 h to 3 h (45% to 70%). Moreover, further increase in time brought down the amount of lignin converted to liquids. This is due to repolymerziation of the phenolic monomers to high molecular weight compounds, whose selectivity was 8.2%. Relatively, the liquid yield increased from 2 h to 3 h (37 wt% to 48.2 wt%), and again decreased to 39 wt% at 4 h. This can be attributed to the condensation of the phenolic monomers to form high molecular weight compounds, which is catalyzed by the acidic centers present in the catalysts. This results in a decrease in soluble liquid products. As an evidence to this, C9 phenolic monomer selectivity decreased from 3 h to 4 h (57.3 to 48.9%). High selectivity to t-IEug (23.9%) was obtained after 3 h with 2Pd-5Mo/ABC catalyst. In the case of 2Pd-5W/ABC catalyst, an increase in lignin conversion from 2 h to 3 h is also accompanied by an increase in selectivity to total C9 monomeric phenols. With further increase in time from 3 h to 4 h, the production of C9 phenols decreased from 45% to 34.5% with a concomitant increase in selectivity to C6 guaiacol. High selectivities to PG (16.4%) and t-IEug (14.2%) were observed at 3 h. Other non-specific phenolic monomers were obtained with this catalyst at long reaction times. With 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, initial conversion increased from 57% (2 h) to 69% (3 h), and further decreased to 64% (4 h). The total monomer selectivity and the C9 phenolic monomer selectivity decreased a little with an increase in time from 3 h to 4 h. Nevertheless, no major change in product selectivities were observed except for C6 guaiacol. From 2 h to 4 h, a gradual decrease in selectivity to t-IEug and PohG was observed, and the selectivity to PG increased marginally. Notably, the selectivity to heavies increased from 11% (2 h) to 15% (4 h). This discussion proves that, for all the catalysts, 3 h reaction time is the optimum to achieve favorable yields and selectivities to the monomeric phenols. 3.3.3 Unraveling the reaction pathway of PG formation through model compounds From the experimental results obtained with different catalysts, a possible reaction pathway can be proposed based on the C9 phenolic monomer yield and selectivity. The control experiments show that t-IEug and PohG are the primary products obtained by the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages. This shows the existence of a parallel pathway for the formation of t-IEug and PohG from lignin hydrogenolysis (Fig. 8 ) [41]. At the same time, PG can be produced via hydrogenation and dehydroxylation of t-IEug and PohG, respectively. Therefore, the activity of the catalyst depends on the dehydroxylation of Cγ or hydrogenation of Cα Cβ. Two model compounds, viz., t-IEug and PohG, were subjected to hydrogenolysis experiments using all Pd-loaded catalysts. An equimolar mixture of t-IEug and PohG was employed, and the results are shown in Fig. S4 (in Supplementary Material). The results demonstrate that all the Pd-loaded catalysts actively participate in the hydrogenation of the Cα Cβ of t-IEug, which results in 100% conversion of t-IEug within 30 min. This is due to the presence of active Pd site, which favors the adsorption of Cα Cβ bonds. However, the conversion of PohG was only <4% after 3 h. This proves that the dominant step for the formation of PG is through hydrogenation of t-IEug. Even though the dehydroxylation of Cγ was more favorable with 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, the contribution of this pathway to PG formation is low. The yield of PG after 3 h follows the trend: 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (53.9 mol%) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (52.9 mol%) > 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (51.8 mol%) ≈ 2Pd-ABC (51.1 mol%). 3.3.4 Catalytic activity for C9 monomeric phenols With Pd/ABC catalyst, the product distribution shows that the presence of Pd as an active metal results in superior activity for the hydrogenation of Cα Cβ. The presence of Mo and W promotes dehydroxylation of Cγ compared to hydrogenation of Cα Cβ [16,42]. Larger the particle size of the active metal, lower is the hydrogenation of Cα Cβ [43]. The average crystallite size of Pd0 in W and Mo-based catalysts are 20.6 and 22.0 nm, which substantiates the high selectivity to t-IEug. With 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, the dehydroxylation and hydrogenation activities were relatively better than other catalysts. Due to this, the selectivities to PG (19.4%) and PohG (16%) were high. These observations reveal that the presence of Lewis acid metal oxides (Zr, W, and Mo) promote dehydroxylation of Cγ and aids in the cleavage of ether bonds [16,42]. The order of activity of the catalysts for PG, is given by: 2Pd-5Zr/ABC > 2Pd-5W/ABC > 2Pd/ABC > 2Pd-5Mo/ABC. Although Mo showed poor activity to form PG, it is a better candidate to obtain high selectivity to C9 alkene guaiacol such as t-IEug. t-Isoeugenol is a good starting material for fragrances and is also used in making flavor additives. The promising results from this investigation shows that 2Pd-5Mo/ABC and 2Pd-5Zr/ABC are promising catalysts to improve the selectivity to monomeric phenols like t-isoeugenol, propyl guaiacol and propanol guaiacol. The maximum theoretical phenolic monomer yield that can be obtained from softwood lignin is reported to be 25%, which is based on NMR analysis of bond types [44]. However, the quantification of monomers using GC techniques have shown that the monomer yield is as high as 36–42 wt% [45–47], which is in line with this study. Table 4 [13–15,18,42,45,48] shows the benchmarking of the results obtained in this study with the literature. As compared to the existing studies, this study has employed very less amount of noble metal (2 wt%), and achieved 42.2 wt% of total phenolic monomer yield with 21.9 wt% of C9 monomers."
11,Recyclability of the Pd-based catalysts,"3.4 Recyclability of the Pd-based catalysts The recyclability of Pd-loaded catalysts was studied by recovering and reactivating the spent catalysts, and subjecting them to hydrogenolysis experiments. The catalysts were recovered using 1 M NaOH solution and the unconverted lignin was washed out. Thereafter, thecatalyst was thoroughly washed with MeOH and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The dried catalysts were reactivated in H2 ambience (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 3 h. It is worthwhile to note that the catalysts were not subjected to cacination in air ambience to remove carbon deposits. The reactivated catalysts were used for the recyclability tests, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 9 and Table S2 (in Supplementary Material). The lignin conversion decreased for all the catalysts by ~ 15% with respect to the experiment conducted with the fresh catalyst. For 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst, the lignin conversion decreased by ~ 26% with respect to the fresh catalyst. The liquid yield also decreased, which points to the possible deactivation of the active sites of the catalysts through coking. Interestingly, the selectivity to the phenolic monomers remained almost the same (~80%) with maximum decrease of 9.5% observed for 2Pd-5Mo/ABC catalyst. 3.4.1 Spent catalysts and unreacted lignin characterization In order to understand the reason for the decrease in catalytic activity, the spent catalysts were characterized using ATR-FTIR, and gravimetric analysis to quantify coking. Fig. 10 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of fresh, spent and the recovered forms of 2Pd-5Zr/ABC catalyst. For the fresh catalyst, the characteristic vibrations corresponding to ABC support are evident in the fingerprint region (400 to 1500 cm−1). The spent catalyst exhibits the following distinct vibrations corresponding to unreacted lignin: (a) 850 cm−1: CH out-of-plane deformation of aromatic ring, (b) 1025 cm−1: CH bending, (c) 1140 cm−1: CH in-plane deformation, (d) 1210 cm−1: combination of CC + CO stretching, (e) 1250 cm−1: guaiacyl ring (G-unit), (f) 1420 and 1520 cm−1: C6 aromatic ring, (g) 1461 cm−1: CH deformation of C6 aromatic ring, (h) 2840 cm−1: CH asymmetric stretch in CH2 and CH3, and (i) 2935 cm−1: CH stretch in OCH3 functionalities. For the recovered catalyst, the characteristic vibrations corresponding to lignin were not observed, which is clearly evident from the absence of CH stretching vibration. So, it can be concluded that the recovered catalyst is free of unreacted lignin. In fact, the ATR-FTIR spectra of unreacted lignin obtained from the different catalysts (Fig. S5 in Supplementary Material) reveal that they are similar to spent catalyst, albeit with intense peaks observed for a majority of the functional groups. Nevertheless, the formation of carbonaceous residue/coke cannot be ignored. From the gravimetric analysis of fresh catalyst, spent catalyst and recovered catalyst, the mass% of solid residue/coke was determined to be 7.0 wt%, 9.7 wt%, 12.6 wt%, and 16.3 wt% for 2Pd/ABC, 2Pd-5Mo/ABC, 2Pd-5Zr/ABC and 2Pd-5W/ABC catalysts, respectively. This shows that further studies related to catalyst reactivation need to be performed to establish stable forms of these catalysts for long duration and many-cycle operation."
12,Conclusions,"The effect of Lewis metal oxides (MoO3, WO2.6, ZrO2) combined with a meager amount of Pd supported on activated biochar for hydrogenolysis of lignin to selectively obtain C9 phenolic monomers were studied. Pyridine-DRIFT measurement proved the presence of Lewis acid sites due to metal oxides, which followed the trend: 2Pd-5Mo/ABC > 2Pd-5W/ABC > 2Pd-5Zr/ABC. The results demonstrate that the activity of the catalysts to form PG followed the trend: 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (10 wt% yield, 19.4% selectivity) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (8.1 wt%, 16.4%) ≈ 2Pd/ABC (8.3 wt%, 15.3%) > 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (6.4 wt%, 13.4%) at 3 h. This is in agreement with the electropositive nature of the secondary metal oxides: ZrO2 > WO2.6 > MoO3. MoO3 enhances the dehydroxylation of Cγ-OH and inhibits the hydrogenation of Cα Cβ, and as a result, high selectivity to t-IEug was obtained. The hydrogenation activity of the catalysts for the formation of PohG followed the trend: 2Pd/ABC (17.0%) ≈ 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (16.0%) > 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (8.3%) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (5.3%). Similarly, the formation of t-IEug followed the trend: 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (23.9%) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (14.2%) > 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (5.5%) ≈ 2Pd/ABC (4.4%) at 3 h. The model compound study unequivocally revealed that PG is formed predominantly via hydrogenation of t-IEug. The carbon atom economy of the catalysts for phenolic monomer production follows the trend: 2Pd/ABC (50.4%) > 2Pd-5Mo/ABC (48.2%) > 2Pd-5Zr/ABC (47.6%) > 2Pd-5W/ABC (41.8%). The high acidity of these catalysts also lead to significant repolymerisation of the phenolic monomers. An ensemble of the results show that bifunctional Pd-Lewis metal oxide catalysts greatly influence the selective production of C9 phenolic monomers, which are the valuable products from a lignin biorefinery."
