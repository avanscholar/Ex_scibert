0,Introduction,"The industrial growth of the hydrogen economy is one of the challenging issues that gained the attention of researchers in the quest for developing renewable energy resources [1]. Photocatalytic and photochemical water splitting techniques have a route map to produce hydrogen (H2) under direct sunlight [2]. Unfortunately, in the photocatalytic process, the low energy conversion limits the efficiency in large scale applications. While for the water electrolysis, electrochemical water splitting technique can overcome this setback [3]. Water electrolysis in an alkaline medium is the most promising method for producing high purity hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively [4]. Compared to the HER, the OER requires higher overpotential for the removal of four electrons to transform O2 from water, as shown in the following equation [5]. 2H2O (1) → O2 (g) + 4H+ (aq) + 4e− E0 = +1.23 V (vs RHE) Therefore, the selection of suitable electrocatalyst is significant to catalyze the water splitting process with low overpotential for the OER. In addition, the stability of the electrocatalyst is crucial in an acid or alkaline medium. Noble metals such as platinum, ruthenium, and iridium-based materials are considered as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the OER and the HER in an alkaline medium [6,7]. However, their high cost, poor stability, and low abundance restrict large scale production [8]. To overcome these drawbacks, different materials have emerged, with various research groups starting to develop non-precious electrocatalytic materials, such as transition metals-based oxides, phosphates, selenides, sulfides, nitrides, borides, carbides, organometallic compounds, hydroxides, double hydroxides, oxy(hydroxide), and graphene-based hybrids to evaluate the HER and the OER performance [9–13]. Later, researchers started working on environment friendly layer double hydroxides (LDHs) for the OER and the HER due to their earth-abundant nature, low cost, and multiple valence states [14]. In general, LDH materials are a class of ionic lamellar structures ([M2+ 1−x M3+ x(OH)2] [An−]x/n·zH2O) where metal cations occupy the centers of edge sharing octahedra, and the vertexes contain hydroxide ions that connect to form infinite 2D sheets [15]. This 2D-LDH material has a wide range of applications, such as drug delivery, dye removal, catalysts, fuel cells, and CO2 capturing [16]. Inclusively, LDH materials have a large specific surface area, which provides large number of active sites to facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte and improve its electrocatalytic performance [17]. Recently, the first series of 3d transition metals namely, Ni, Fe, and Co-based LDH materials possess variable valence states, which have great advantage in enhancing their OER and HER performance [18]. There are number of reports on these materials such as, NiV-LDHs [19], NiFe-LDHs [20], FeNi-LDHs [21], NiCo-LDHs [22,23], CoFe-LDHs [24], CoMn-LDHs [25], ZnCo-LDHs [26], FeNiCo-LDHs [27], and CoNi-LDH/CoO [28]. Among the different bimetallic LDH materials, Co-based LDHs are very active electrocatalysts due to the presence of unsaturated CoO6-x octahedron, which promotes more active sites for the OER and HER process [29]. Interestingly, another metal in the second row of 3d transition metal molybdenum (Mo) also believed to have high beneficial factors when it is incorporated with other metals and opens a wide range of applications [30]. More specifically, CoMo-LDH material have potential for bifunctional water splitting [31]. But, still lowering the overpotential of OER remains the challenging area. To overcome this limitation, in this present study, the design of electrocatalyst is considered as an important criterion. In this context, we developed a novel 3D architecture of marigold flower-like CoMo-LDH structure consisting of 2D nanosheets as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and the HER to lower the overpotential. The CoMo-LDH with different Co/Mo weight ratios of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1 were synthesized and evaluated its catalytic performance for the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH. The results suggest that Co3Mo2-LDH electrocatalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec−1 for the OER. In addition, it delivers an overpotential of 165 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec−1 for the HER. The improved electrocatalytic properties mainly due to the unique structure of the 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH, which provides more active sites to enhance the evolution of O2 and H2."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, C6H12N4) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. Isopropyl alcohol, Nafion solution (5 wt%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were obtained from the Duskan pure chemicals Co. Ltd. Distilled water was used for all the experiments."
3,Preparation of 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH,"2.2 Preparation of 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH The 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH electrocatalysts with different weight ratios of Co/Mo such as, Co1Mo4 (1:4), Co2Mo3 (2:3), Co3Mo2 (3:2), and Co4Mo1 (4:1) were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis of Co1Mo4-LDH, 10 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 40 mM Na2MoO4·2H2O, and 60 mM HMTA were dissolved in 60 mL DI water, then transferred to Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 90 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the formed precipitate was washed with DI H2O and ethanol for several times and dried at 80 °C in a hot air oven for 6 h. A similar procedure was followed to synthesize Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs with different Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O weight ratios."
4,Structural characterization,"2.3 Structural characterization The crystalline characteristics of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’pert Pro, PANalytical diffractometer) equipped with nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV and 30 mA). The morphology of the samples was examined using field emission scanning transmission microscopy (FESEM; S-4800, HITACHI). The detailed structural features, lattice spacings, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, and elemental composition were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning TEM-high angular annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) using FEI Tecnai G2 F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the samples were analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer (BET, 3-flex, Micromeritics) at Core Research Support Center for Natural Products and Medical Materials in Yeungnam University. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded using ESCALAB 250 to explore the elemental surface composition of the samples. Elemental analysis were performed on inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICPS-7300DV)."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical activities of the prepared Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2 and Co4Mo1-LDHs catalysts were tested for the OER and the HER on an Autolab potentiostat galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N, Metrohm) equipped with three electrode cell and a rotating disk electrode (RDE), along with a system for controlling the rotational speed of the electrode. A commercial glassy carbon electrode (GCE; 3 mm diameter and 0.07 cm−2 surface area) served as the working electrode, whereas Ag/AgCl in 3.0 M KCl, and a platinum plate act as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing 5 mg of each CoMo-LDH with isopropyl alcohol, DI water, and 5 wt% Nafion solution. The mixer was sonicated for 30 min and then drop cast into GCE, after drying at room temperature. The weight of the catalysts was measured to be ∼0.1 mg cm−2. The electrochemical OER and HER activity of the prepared electrocatalyst samples were carried out in a 1.0 M KOH solution. All the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were performed at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 with the rotating speed of 1600 rpm to avoid the generation of bubbles at the electrode surface. For the OER and the HER experiments, after CV activation for 30 cycles, LSV polarization curves were performed by sweeping the potential from 1.0 to 1.8 V and 0.2 to −0.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. For comparison commercially available RuO2 and Pt/C samples were also tested under similar conditions to that of prepared LDHs materials. The double layered capacitance of the catalyst was estimated under a non-faradic region by measuring the capacitive current associated with double layer charging, calculated from the different CV scan rates from 0.96 to 1.00 V (vs RHE). The long-term stability of the electrocatalyst was checked via the chronopotentiometry technique at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at a voltage of 1.50 and −0.21 V vs RHE."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphological features of the synthesized 3D CoMo-LDH,"3.1 Morphological features of the synthesized 3D CoMo-LDH The synthesis process and the formation of 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this work, CoMo-LDH with four different ratios Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1 were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal method using Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, and HMTA in water. During the reaction process, HMTA a dual feature surfactant (structure directing agent and a ligand), which links two metal atoms of Co and Mo to form the organometallic complex in water through hydrogen bond. Finally, it can leads to the formation of 2D-LDH nanosheets, which are assembled to form 3D flower-like structure [32,33]. In detail, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, and HMTA in water form polyoxometalate cluster-like complex [34]. This cluster complex upon hydrothermal process (i.e. hydrolysis reaction), forms a 1D chain like units, which are linked with a supramolecular water octamer to form 2D CoMo-LDH nanosheets layers, further parallel-stacked to generate a 3D flower-like structure [35]. Simultaneously, in this process, HMTA releases ammonia and formaldehyde then by decomposition, CO3 2– ions incorporated into LDH layers as intercalated anionic species [36,37]. Meanwhile, some of the water molecules might also enter as intercalated molecules in LDH layers [38]. Moreover, the FESEM, TEM, and HRTEM analyses were performed to understand the structure of the as-prepared CoMo-LDH samples with various ratios. Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of CoMo-LDH with different Co/Mo ratios but with similar 3D flower-like morphology. These 3D flowers are composed of numerous ultrathin 2D nanosheets, which are densely connected to form a spherical structure. Interestingly, the low magnification FESEM images in inset Fig. 2a, d, g, and j projects the single sphere-shaped 3D flowers of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs, which resembles the marigold-like flowers shown in inset Fig. 2a, respectively. The typical flowers in Fig. 2b, e, h, and k clearly show the clean and smooth 2D ultrathin nanosheets present in 3D marigold flower-like CoMo-LDH [39]. This indicates that the morphology of the nanosheets is not affected by tuning the ratios of Co/Mo. The high-resolution FESEM images of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs depicted in Fig. 2c, f, i, and l exhibit the 2D ultrathin nanosheets, which are overlapped with each layer. Furthermore, the nanosheets were interconnected via three-way junction (Y-shaped) to form flower-like structure, demonstrating the Y shaped junctions in 2D ultrathin nanosheets for the four ratios of CoMo-LDHs. The formed structure well agreed with the proposed structure of stacking the chain-like units of the 2D layered structure to form a 3D flower-like structure. To further elucidate the structure of 3D marigold flower-like CoMo-LDH, TEM and HRTEM analyses were carried out for Co3Mo2-LDH sample. Fig. 3 a-c shows the 3D marigold flower-like structure consisting of 2D ultrathin nanosheets in fluffy architecture, to the inset FESEM image (Fig. 3a). As mentioned in the FESEM images, the 3D flowers are assembled by numerous 2D nanosheets which is evident from these TEM images. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3d represents the 2D ultrathin nanosheets, where the holey feature can be identified from the red circles, which is an important advantage of 3D flower-like CoMo-LDH structure in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity [40,41]. The SAED pattern of the nanosheets layer, as shown in inset Fig. 3d exhibits diffraction rings of (012) and (110) planes. Furthermore, the STEM-EDS elemental mapping was performed to confirm the chemical composition of 3D flower-like Co3Mo2-LDH. The TEM image in Fig. 4 a projects the clear view of 2D ultrathin holey nanosheets in flower-like CoMo-LDH. Fig. 4b represents the STEM bright field image and the selected area scanning profiles in Fig. 4c-e confirm the Co, Mo, and O elements co-exist in the 3D Co3Mo2-LDH. The individual panels in Fig. 4c-e demonstrates the even distribution of Co, Mo, and O elements, and the corresponding EDS spectrum (Fig. S1, supplementary data) also coincide with mapping images, with the Cu peak arising from the TEM grid used for analysis. This type of 2D ultrathin layered holey nanosheets in 3D flowers provide excellent surface accessibility for the charge transfer process, which possibly enhances the OER and the HER performance."
8,Characterization of the 3D CoMo-LDH,"3.2 Characterization of the 3D CoMo-LDH The crystallographic structures of the as-synthesized Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs samples were examined by XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 5 . The weak peak around 2θ values of 25° corresponds to (006) plane of LDH materials [42]. Similarly, the two peaks observed at 2θ values of 33.6° and 59.5° for all the ratios can be indexed to (012) and (110) planes of the LDH structure, which is consistent with the JCPDS no. 50-0235 [31,43]. The low crystallinity LDH phases appeared in the as-prepared samples may be due to the low synthesis temperature (90 °C) and adsorption of anions into the hydroxide layers [44]. This further confirms that the synthesized samples were purely LDH in nature. The XRD planes of Co3Mo2-LDH also coincide with the SAED pattern, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3d. The absence of additional Co(OH)2 and MoO3 peaks indicates that the as-prepared samples were solely composed of CoMo-LDH, which is evidenced by (012) and (110) lattice planes [45]. Moreover, the XRD result is in good agreement with the SEM results as the structure showed the same morphology even after changing the ratios of Co/Mo. In order to estimate the specific surface area of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDH materials, nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis were carried out. Its corresponding isotherms and pore size distribution were shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6a, the BET surface area of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2 and Co4Mo1-LDHs are 73.39, 106.93, 130.40 and 103.89 m2 g−1. Fig. 6b and inset figures clearly shows the pore size distribution of these LDHs materials, which are found to be 3.485, 3.775, 3.856 and 3.576 nm, respectively. It can be observed that Co3Mo2-LDH have larger surface area, which is approximately twice that of Co1Mo4-LDH. While Co2Mo3-LDH and Co4Mo1-LDH have approximately have equal surface area. Moreover, all the four ratios of LDHs materials shows the type IV adsorption and desorption isotherms and H3 hysteresis loops (Fig. 6a), which indicates that the pore structure exhibits mesopores in nature mainly due to the holes present in the 2D nanosheets [46]. This feature might also enhance the mass charge transfer phenomena, thereby improving the OER and HER performance [47]. To further study the surface elemental composition and valence states, the XPS technique was performed on Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs. The high-resolution XPS individual core level spectra of Co, Mo, and O for the four ratios of CoMo-LDH are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The Co 2p spectra in Fig. 7a shows two main spin-orbit doublets with binding energies of approximately 781.2 and 797.2 eV in Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively [48]. The Co 2p3/2 was further deconvoluted into two peaks at a range of binding energies with 780.9 ± 0.5 and 782.4 ± 0.2 eV being assigned to Co3+ and Co2+ species, while other two peaks at 796.4 ± 0.5 and 797.9 ± 0.5 eV were related to Co3+ and Co2+ in Co 2p1/2, respectively [49]. The two pairs of spin-orbitals (Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2) indicate the existence of Co3+ and Co2+ in all the four ratios of CoMo-LDH specimens, which are consistent with the previous report [42]. The formation of Co3+ may be due to the oxidation of Co2+ by dissolved oxygen in the hydrothermal process [35]. Moreover, two satellite peaks found at 786.9 and 803.1 eV can also be attributed to the shake-up peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, in all the four ratios of CoMo-LDH specimens [50]. The Mo 3d spectrum shown in Fig. 7b displays the deconvoluted spectra of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs. The two strong doublet peaks at 232.5 ± 0.1 and 235.5 ± 0.1 eV with a splitting width of 3.2 eV were ascribed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively. These two intense peaks are characteristic of hexavalent Mo6+ species [51,52]. In all the four ratios the weak peak at binding energy 237.5 eV corresponds to production Mo6+, this occurred due to the partial oxidation of Mo2+on the catalyst surface [53]. In CoMo-LDH, Co is the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states with electronic configurations of [Ar] 3d7 and [Ar] 3d6 with low spin transition states t2g 6eg 1 and t2g 5eg 1, which can be considered as the active centers for the OER process. These two active centers show maximum activity when the eg orbital occupancy is unity [54]. On the other hand, Mo is the only presence of Mo6+ oxidation state with electronic configuration [Kr] 4d5 5 s1. In OER process under oxidation conditions, Co2+/3+ loses electron for the regeneration of active sites, where Mo has a prominent ability to draw these electrons which could keep Co in the high valance state as an active sites [31,42]. Therefore, the divalent (Co2+) and trivalent (Co3+) Co species adsorbs hydroxyl ion from KOH, undergoes oxidation losing electrons, and attains high oxidation state coordinating with hydroxyl ions, then followed by the deprotonation process to form the oxyhydroxide, which further undergoes a reduction reaction releasing O2. In Fig. 7c, the O1s peak can be splitted to two peaks, first the strong peak at binding energy at 531.5 ± 0.1 eV assigned to the surface hydroxyl group of the metal center (M-OH). The second peak at binding energy 532.8 eV denotes the presence water molecules [55]. Therefore, the O 1 s spectra results satisfy the structure of the common LDH material reported elsewhere [56]. From the morphological and structural characterization studies, we confirmed that 3D marigold flower-like CoMo-LDH electrocatalysts with 2D ultrathin nanosheets were successfully prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. In order to further confirm the different ratios of prepared LDHs materials were analyzed by ICP and the results are shown in the Table 1 . The values in the table clearly shows that the prepared different ratios CoMo samples maintained the molar ratios of experimental value."
9,Electrocatalytic performance of the 3D CoMo-LDH for OER,"3.3 Electrocatalytic performance of the 3D CoMo-LDH for OER Encouraged by the unique structural characteristics, the electrocatalytic performance of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs toward OER was first evaluated in 1.0 M KOH electrolytic solution. For comparison, the commercial RuO2 was also tested at the same condition. All the samples were coated on GC electrode with a constant mass loading of ∼0.1 mg cm−2 and used as a working electrode. The full OER profile of CoMo-LDH with different ratios and commercial RuO2 is represented in Fig. 8 . The LSV curves of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, Co4Mo1, and RuO2 clearly denotes that the potential to attain a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 are 1.542, 1.516, 1.496, 1.531, and 1.630 V (vs RHE), respectively (Fig. 8a). The typical LSV curve of Co3Mo2-LDH shows that the overpotential to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 266 mV, which is apparently lower than Co2Mo3-LDH (286 mV), Co4Mo1-LDH (301 mV), and Co1Mo4 (312 mV) (Fig. 8b). Furthermore, such overpotentials are quite lower than that of RuO2 (400 mV). Meanwhile, the bare GC electrode shows a negligible current density, which confirms that the increased current density of all the catalysts is originated from its inherent catalytic activity. In the OER process, the important factor that predicts the catalytic activity is the Tafel slope, which can be explained by the Krasilshchkov mechanism including a four-step process in the OER [57]. The first step is the adsorption of water molecules or hydroxyl groups via the charge transfer process. The second step is the deprotonation of the adsorbed hydroxyl group, while the third and fourth step are the formation of the intermediate oxyhydroxyl groups and evolution of oxygen, respectively. Adopting Krasilshchkov path, herein we propose the possible mechanism: Inherently, all the ratios of 3D CoMo-LDHs have the divalent (Co2+) and trivalent (Co3+) Co species as revealed from XPS data, which are the active sites in OER process. The inset LSV curves in Fig. 8a also confirms the oxidation peaks at the potential region from 1.0 to 1.3 V vs RHE in all the ratios of CoMo-LDHs correspond to transitions of Co(II) ↔ Co(III) ↔ Co (IV) [58]. Briefly, divalent (Co2+) and trivalent (Co3+) Co species in CoMo-LDHs undergoes oxidation (losing electrons) to higher oxidation state (Co3+/Co4+) forming Co-OOH or (Co-OO) oxyhydroxide, which further undergoes a reduction reaction for releasing O2. Throughout the OER process, Co sites in CoMo-LDHs could regenerate the active sites at a faster rate. Therefore, herein all the ratios of 3D flower-like CoMo-LDHs exhibit low overpotentials than RuO2 due to high OH adsorption on the catalyst surface. Notably, Co3Mo2-LDH exhibits low overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm−2 than other CoMo-LDH ratios. Hence, the ratio between Co and Mo is an important factor and the synergic effect between these two species also enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, Co3Mo2-LDH and Co2Mo3-LDH exhibits good OER performances compared to Co4Mo1-LDH and Co1Mo4-LDH, which confirms more active sites in the former ratios than in the latter, respectively. In Co4Mo1-LDH, Co-species are high, but the Mo sites are low for the regeneration of active sites and is vice versa in Co1Mo4-LDH ratio. Moreover, the performances of Co3Mo2-LDH was also compared with other LDH materials (Table S1, supplementary data). The superior performance of Co3Mo2-LDH is further determined by Tafel value, which is considered as rate-determining step in the OER, based on the number of the electron transfer process, it can be calculated using the Tafel equation: η = a + b log ( j ) where ƞ, a, b, and j represent the overpotential, constant, Tafel slope, and current density, respectively. The Tafel slopes of the four ratios of CoMo-LDHs and RuO2 were represented in Fig. 8c. Tafel slopes of RuO2 (121 mV dec−1) and Co1Mo4-LDH (120 mV dec−1) were close to each other but are comparatively higher than Co2Mo3-LDH (64 mV dec−1), Co4Mo1-LDH (117 mV dec−1). Meanwhile, Co3Mo2-LDH (49 mV dec−1) exhibits lowest Tafel slope than other catalysts suggesting its outstanding catalytic activity towards OER. The fundamental origin and trend in activity of these catalysts might be due to unique structural feature (3D flowers assembled by 2D nanosheets) and synergistic interaction between Co and Mo atoms. To elucidate the synergistic effect between Co and Mo, cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) were prepared and analyzed by XRD pattern, LSV curves (Fig. S2, supplementary data). The formed Co(OH)2 exhibits the diffraction peaks indexed to (101), (113), (024) and (220) planes of β-Co(OH)2 (Fig. 2a), which match well with the JCPDS No-73-2134. Moreover, the typical LSV curve clearly denotes the potential to attain current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 1.604 V (vs RHE) (Fig. S2b). Whereas, Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDH exhibits 1.542, 1.516, 1.496, and 1.531 V (vs RHE), respectively, which is found to be lower than that of Co(OH)2. From these results, it can be confirmed the synergistic interaction between co and Mo exists. The synergistic effect and reactivity of the active sites in the 2D nanosheets increases the catalytic activity. Moreover, the catalytic activity of these catalysts can be well explained based on ECSA, which can be estimated by double layer capacitance (Cdl). The Co3Mo2-LDH possesses a higher surface area than Co2Mo3, Co4Mo1, and Co1Mo4-LDHs (Fig. 8d and Fig. S3, supplementary data). All these results reveal that the Co3Mo2-LDH possess higher OER activity. Furthermore, the EIS analysis was performed to explore the charge-transfer resistance phenomena between CoMo-LDH and electrolyte interface. Fig. 8e shows the Nyquist plots for Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1 LDHs and the inset equivalent circuit diagram was used to fit the spectra. In the circuit, R s corresponds to the solution resistance, R ct represents the charge transfer resistance, and CPE denotes the electrochemical double layer capacity (C dl). The R ct for Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs were found to be 24.22, 12.38, 7.89, and 21.58 Ω, respectively. This result further confirms that Co3Mo2-LDH exhibits the lowest resistance (R ct) value and a fast charge transfer rate due to more active sites leading to its enhanced OER performance. The long-term stability of the Co3Mo2-LDH was tested via performing CV and chronopotentiometry studies, as shown in Fig. 8f. The LSV curves of the Co3Mo2-LDH before and after 1000 cycles demonstrate excellent stability compared to the other ratios (Fig. S4, supplementary data). The chronopotentiometry study for Co3Mo2-LDH reveals that a cell voltage of 1.496 V vs RHE is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and maintains excellent robust stability for 12 h (inset Fig. 8f)."
10,Electrocatalytic performance of the 3D CoMo-LDH for HER,"3.4 Electrocatalytic performance of the 3D CoMo-LDH for HER Inspired by the OER performances, CoMo-LDHs were also evaluated for HER in 1 M KOH solution. The LSV curves of the GC electrode loaded with Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, Co4Mo1-LDHs, and commercial Pt/C were shown in Fig. 9 a. From the typical LSV curves, Co3Mo2-LDH exhibited higher current density (250 mA cm−2), which is comparatively equal to RuO2. While, the bare GC electrode delivered a negligible current density, confirms the important role of the CoMo-LDHs coated GC electrode in examining it’s HER activity. Moreover, it can be observed from Fig. 9a and b that Pt/C delivers low overpotential of 62 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 than Co3Mo2-LDH (165 mV), Co2Mo3-LDH (260 mV), Co4Mo1-LDH (304 mV), and Co1Mo4-LDH (322 mV). The overpotential of Co3Mo2-LDH at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was also compared with other catalyst material summarized in Table S2, supplementary data. Furthermore, interestingly Co3Mo2-LDH exhibits overpotential of about 325 mV at 100 mA cm−2, which is comparatively lower than that of Pt/C (455 mV at 100 mA cm−2), confirming remarkable activity of Co3Mo2-LDH than other ratios of CoMo-LDHs. Similar to the OER, the “Volmer-Heyrovsky” process or the Tafel process is the rate-determining step for the HER [59]. Based on the Volmer mechanism, we propose a possible pathway process for CoMo-LDHs. The first step is the dissociation of H2O molecules in an alkaline medium to produce protons. In CoMo-LDH, the d electrons in Co are not paired (Co2+- t2g 6eg 1 and Co3+- t2g 5eg 1), and therefore, the electron transfer process will be easier for the dissociation of H2O and e− to form H* radical and OH–. The second step is the deprotonation process and release of H2 (Tafel step) [60]. As discussed for the OER process Co2+ and Co3+ are considered as active centers, exclusively Mo6+ also exhibits high conductivity in enhancing durability and catalytic activity for the HER [42,61]. The Tafel slope values obtained for Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, Co4Mo1-LDHs, and Pt/C were 140, 88, 57, 110, and 46 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 9c). The Tafel value (57 mVdec−1) of the Co3Mo2-LDH via the Volmer-Heyrovsky process shows the best HER activity, which is adjacent to Pt/C (46 mV dec−1). The Co3Mo2-LDH Tafel slope is also compared with that of other reported catalysts, Pt/C (118 mVdec−1), Co(OH)2/g-CNX (165 mV dec−1), Fe(OH)2/g-CNX (136 mV dec−1), Ni3S2/VO2 (114 mV dec−1), NiCo (132 mV dec−1), N-doped Ni3S2 (113 mV dec−1), NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 (105 mV dec−1), Ni3N@carbon quantum dots (CQDS) (108 mV dec−1), Ni3N-CeO2 (122 mV dec−1), MoS2/MoO2 (129 mV dec−1), Ni(OH)2@CoS2 (118 mV dec−1), Ni(OH)2@CuS (104 mV dec−1), Ni(OH)2@Fe2P (105 mV dec−1), and Pt/Ni (120 mV dec−1) [54,62,63]. Fig. 9d shows the Nyquist plots for Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs and the inset depicts the equivalent circuit used to fit the spectra. The R ct for Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1-LDHs were found to be 39.36, 21.58, 10.29, and 26.62 Ω, respectively. Therefore, the fast charge transfer rate for Co3Mo2-LDH leads to an increase in HER performance. The durability of the catalyst is paramount for determining the performance of HER, hence the long-term stability was tested for Co3Mo2-LDH by performing CV and chronopotentiometry tests. Fig. 8e shows the LSV curves of before and after 1000 CV cycles (Co3Mo2-LDH), where the catalyst exhibits impressive stability compared to other ratios (Fig. S5, supplementary data). Furthermore, the chronopotentiometry measurements in Fig. 9f shows that cell voltage of −0.165 V (vs RHE) required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the cell remained stable for 12 h. From the OER and HER performance of as-prepared CoMo-based LDH catalysts with different ratios, we found that the order of the electrocatalytic activity to be Co3Mo2-LDH > Co2Mo3-LDH > Co4Mo1-LDH > Co1Mo4-LDH. This study suggests that Co3Mo2-LDH shows better OER and HER compared to other ratios due to its higher ECSA, synergic effect between Co and Mo in unique 3D marigold-like flowers, and compositional merits."
11,Conclusions,"3D hierarchical architecture of CoMo-LDH catalyst with different Co/Mo ratios was prepared via a hydrothermal method in water medium. The as-prepared CoMo-LDH showed a marigold flower-like structure composed of 2D ultrathin nanosheets. Four different CoMo-LDHs of Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1 ratios were investigated for the OER and HER activity. Among the different ratios, Co3Mo2-LDH exhibited superior OER and HER activity in an alkaline medium, which required a low overpotential of 266 and 165 mV with low Tafel slope of 49 and 57 mV dec−1 to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, Co3Mo2-LDH showed extraordinary electrocatalytic activity compared to RuO2 where it needed a cell potential of 1.496 to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. Additionally, the robust stability of the catalyst accounts for its outstanding performances. This type of eco–friendly electrocatalyst with less toxicity and low-cost synthesis process will be beneficial for producing O2 and H2 in industrial sectors."
