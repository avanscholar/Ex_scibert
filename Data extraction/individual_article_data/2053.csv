0,Introduction,"At present, jet fuels are mainly obtained through traditional petrochemical and coal chemical industries. Considering the shortage of traditional fossil energy and the growing market demand, the development and utilization of biomass have become the current research hotspot. More recently, biological isobutyl alcohol as a new generation biomass energy can be produced through biomass fermentation [1,2]. The production of jet-range hydrocarbons utilizing biological isobutyl alcohol as a raw material is a very new promising process route that does not depend on traditional fossil energy sources. Industrial production methods of isobutyl alcohol mainly include chemical synthesis and biological fermentation. The chemical synthesis technology such as carbonylation and aldol condensation [3], etc., has been flourishing since 1950s, and is currently the main production method of isobutyl alcohol in the world. In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology as well as the development of society, the production of isobutyl alcohol by using genetically-modified microbes or metabolic engineering has received worldwide attention [4–6]. More importantly, researches have demonstrated that microbes can synthesize isobutyl alcohol using non-food crops such as cellulose, CO2 and low protein. In future, non-grain production of isobutyl alcohol is expected to implement its formation on a large scale [7,8]. Atsumi et al. [5] used genetic engineering to knock out the genes that express byproducts during isobutyl alcohol synthesis pathway, which allows the highly efficient formation of isobutyl alcohol isobutyl alcohol with a 86 % of the theoretical value. Li et al. [9] put forward an ultrasound-assisted route to enhance sugar utilization of cassawa starch as a raw material, thus improving the production yield of isobutyl alcohol. Wendy et al. [10] also employed genetic engineering to modify cellulose clostridium and C. cellulolyticum, as a result of which these engineered bacteria could directly convert cellulose into isobutyl alcohol and the isobutyl alcohol production can reach 660 mg/L in 8 days. Therefore, in recent years, the further processing of isobutyl alcohol such as converting it into high value chemicals with a broader market prospect, has attracted much attention. Gevo, Inc of United States used isobutyl alcohol as crude material to produce high-value jet-range hydrocarbons through dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation reactions [11]. The detailed processes are as follows: first, isobutyl alcohol is fixed into dehydration reactor and then dehydrates to isobutylene; after separating the water, the obtained isobutylene will generate high-carbon alkene in polymerization reactor, followed by hydrogenation of C8−16 alkenes to get jet fuels. These reaction processes are complex, and three-step reactions need to be carried out on three kinds of catalysts. Thus, recent developments of alcohol dehydration and alkene oligomerization over acidic zeolite have attracted much attention [12–15]. It should be noted that both isobutyl alcohol dehydration and isobutylene oligomerization can be catalyzed by acidic zeolite, providing a clue for combining both reactions to directly produce jet-range hydrocarbons through isobutyl alcohol oligomerization. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and microporous layered silicate are kinds of new porous functional materials. Through the coordination of different organic ligands with metal centers, MOFs endowed with the functions are widely used in catalysis and many other fields [16]. Microporous layered silicate having the zeolite-like open microchannels within its layers, can exhibit excellent molecular recognition ability for the aromatic compounds via the microchannels, which is considered as excellent catalysts [17]. In the recent decade, periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) with aluminosilica realizes an ordered porous structure and wide variety of organic moiety, and its high surface area has been widely employed in the catalysts [18]. Beta, BEA type zeolite, with a three dimensional pore network including 12-MR pores has been widely used for various dehydration and oligomerization reactions, such as methanol to olefins (MTO) reaction [19,20] and alkene oligomerization reaction [21,22]. Herein, we conducted the isobutyl alcohol oligomerization reaction over zeolite Beta catalysts treated by various dealuminum or desilication methods to compare the effectiveness of the catalysts in isobutyl alcohol oligomerization reaction, and to provide possible way to develop a promising catalyst. Besides, related factors of the zeolite catalyst such as acid site, pore structure, and pore size influencing reactive activity, were also studied via the utilization of XRD, SEM, XRF, Nitrogen adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, Py-FTIR, and 27Al-NMR. Especially, the reaction activity, C8−16 hydrocarbons selectivity and regenerability of the catalysts were discussed in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the materials,"2.1 Preparation of the materials Briefly, the commercial Beta zeolites (TOSOH) were mixed with 0.1 mol/L NH4NO3 aqueous solution and stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. After filtration and washing with deionized water until no nitrate ions could be detected, and then the obtained products were dried at room temperature overnight, calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. This proton-exchanged parent zeolite Beta was designated as BEA. The zeolites H-Beta was treated by the HCl or the EDTA to dealuminate. The HCl treatment was carried out under stirring at 80 °C in a 20 mL 1 mol/L HCl solution (2 g BEA) for 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 h. For EDTA treatment, the Beta were refluxed in 20 mL of distilled water with 0.96 g of H4EDTA for a certain time (1, 2, 4 or 8 h). The mixture was heated to a specific temperature (at 100 °C) with stirring. Respectively, the HCl treatment and EDTA of H-Beta zeolites are defined as HClxh-BEA and EDTAxh-BEA, in addition, for different treatment methods, x means the treatment time of the samples. The desilicated process was achieved by NaOH treatment. 3 g of H-Beta were dispersed into 60 mL of NaOH solution (0.4 mol/L) at 65 °C under stirring for 30 min. The slurry was filtered and then washed with deionized water and dried at 120 °C. The obained sample was designated as NaOH-BEA."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of catalysts were analyzed by RINT 2400 System (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 20 mA. The scan was performed with a rate of 0.02°/s. The surface morphology was evaluated using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-JSM-6360). N2 physisorption tests were carried out with a Quantachrome Instruments equipment (NOVA-2200e). Prior to tests, 30−40 mg samples were first degassed at 300 °C for 2 h. Afterward, the N2 adsorption isotherms were recorded at −196 °C to obtain the surface area, pore volume and the average pore size according to the BJH method. And XRF analyses were used to determine the Si/Al of Beta zeolite by different treatment and performed on PHILIPS PW2404R. The acidity of catalysts was studied with NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) using BELCAT-B-TT (BEL.JAPAN INC.). The NH3-TPD was carried out between 50 °C and 900 °C under a helium flow (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Before the test, the samples were pretreated under helium atmosphere at 500 °C for 1 h, then, cooled to 50 °C, and exposed to pure NH3 (30 mL/min) for 0.5 h. Pyridine adsorption (Py-FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Tensor 27 IR spectrometer from Bruker. The BEA, HCl2 h-BEA, EDTA8h-BEA zeolite samples were directly pressed into thin wafers, which were mounted into a vacuum cell. Prior to the measurement, the sample cell was vacuumized to 10−2 Pa at 500 °C for 1 h, the IR spectra were then recorded at 150 °C. The 27Al-MAS NMR spectra were registered using JNM-ECX500 MHz (magnetic field is 11.7 T), equipped with a 4 mm probe at the spinning speed of 15 kHz. The pulse sequence contained one single excitation pulse of 1.2 μs (π/8) duration, the repeat time was 1 s. The char/coke was analyzed through thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA-60, Shimadzu). It was carried out in a METTLER TOLEDO STARe system, with the heating rate of 10 °C/min under air atmosphere to identify the type of char and coke as well as to determine the total amounts of carbon deposition in the spent catalysts."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing Isobutyl alcohol oligomerization reaction was carried out in an 85 mL steel batch reactor. In brief, 0.5 g of the catalyst and 10 mL of isobutyl alcohol (2-Methyl-1-Propanol, Tokyo Chemical Industry) were placed into the reactor. Then the reactor system was purged three times with N2 to remove the trapped air. After purging, the reactor was pressurized with N2 of 1 MPa, and then the reactor system was heated up to reaction temperature. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down to the 0 °C and then depressurized to atmospheric pressure to collect the gas product. Liquid phase products were separated by filter. The liquid products were analyzed by a capillary chromatography (GC-14B, FID, Shimadzu, Japan). The gas products were also analyzed by another capillary chromatography (GC-14B, FID, Shimadzu, Japan). The filtered solid was then washed three times with n-hexane (100 mL, each time) and dried at 120 °C for 12 h for further analysis. The conversion of isobutyl alcohol was calculated by its consumption: Isobutyl alcohol conversion (%) = [1 − (Cmole of isobutyl alcohol after reaction)/(Cmole of initial isobutyl alcohol)]×100 % The selectivity of component i was calculated with carbon molar base: S e l . C i = C m o l e o f C i h y d r o c a r b o n ∑ i=1 n C m o l e o f C i h y d r o c a r b o n × 100 %"
5,Result and discussion,
6,Structural and textural properties of catalysts,"3.1 Structural and textural properties of catalysts It can be seen from Fig. 1 that XRD spectra of the Beta zeolite after treatment with hydrochloric acid, EDTA or NaOH still retain characteristic peaks at 7.4 and 22.4°, which can be attributed to typical crystal structure, indicating that hydrochloric acid, EDTA or NaOH treatment could not break the channel structure system of Beta-zeolite zeolite. Moreover, the intensities of low angle peak and high angle peak increase significantly after dealumination treatment, which is due to the removal of impurities and extra-framework aluminum in zeolite after acid pickling, and then it improves the crystallinity of Beta zeolite obviously. But for HCl dealuminization, the crystallinity increases first and then decreases with the increase of dealumination time. This is because that dealuminization in high concentration of HCl for a long time removes a part of framework aluminum and breaks the internal structure, leading to defective lattice and lowered crystallinity [23]. In contrast, in the XRD spectra of Beta zeolite treated with strong alkali solution of NaOH, the intensities of absorption peaks at 2θ = 7.4° are significantly reduced, which demonstrates that the structures of zeolite are partly destroyed after NaOH treatment [24]. Fig. 2 gives SEM images of Beta zeolite under different treatment conditions. Regular stacked grains can be clearly seen in all zeolite samples. Some of Beta zeolite are flake, and few collapses occurs after treatment by NaOH solution, proving that strong alkali is corrosive to the crystal grains of zeolite. The alkali liquor dissolves Si in the zeolite framework and causes the zeolite framework to collapse. However, when the zeolite is treated with hydrochloric acid and EDTA solution, no damages can be found in the crystal grains. As the treatment time increases, the morphology of the zeolite has not changes. It suggests that hydrochloric acid and EDTA would modify the zeolite in a milder manner, which is also consistent with their XRD characterization results. The Si/Al molar ratio of the Beta zeolite by different treatments was calculated by XRF and showed in Table 1 . Thus, according to Table 1,we can estimate the dealumination degree on the zeolite. For HCl dealuminization, it has strong ability on dealumination process, and the Si/Al increases from 19.8–52.6. For the case of EDTA dealuminization, it modifies the zeolite in a milder manner, and the Si/Al was increased slightly from 19.8–37.8 [23]. The samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption method. Fig. 3 gives the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding BJH pore size distribution curves of the samples under different treatment conditions, and the analysis data are also given in Table 1. In Fig. 3, pristine Beta zeolite shows a large micropore volume. After dealuminization, the specific surface area and pore volume of Beta zeolite rise together. However, the pore size distribution shifts to big pore size after EDTA treatment. For the zeolite undergoing hydrochloric acid treatment, its pore size distribution shifts to left first and then shifts to right, along with increasing dealuminization time. As discussed above, EDTA dealuminization mainly removes the surface aluminum and amorphous aluminum, but it cannot get rid of framework aluminum completely [23]. Differently, hydrochloric acid dealuminization not only eliminates aluminum in the pores of zeolite and some amorphous impurities that block the pores, but also removes extra-framework aluminum. Therefore, some micropores with a certain amount of framework aluminum can be formed, which makes the channels more smooth. From Fig. 3 and Table 1, it can be concluded that the specific surface area of Beta zeolite treated with NaOH is greatly reduced. Especially, the micropores numbers is significantly lowered because the strong alkali dissolves the silicon framework in the zeolite, leading to the structure collapse of zeolite [25]. These results are consistent with the above SEM and XRD characterizations, which proves that the employed NaOH solution is too strong to the modification of Beta zeolite."
7,27Al-solid-NMR characterization of catalysts,"3.2 27Al-solid-NMR characterization of catalysts To better understand the detail of dealumination process, the Al species of Beta zeolite and the acid treated Beta zeolites were comparative investigated by 27Al NMR. As shown in Fig. 4 , the peaks at 60 and 0 ppm can be ascribed to the tetrahedral framework Al (FAl) and octahedral extra-framework Al species (EFAl), respectively [26,27]. After treating by EDTA acid, the intensity of peak at 0 ppm decreases obviously. The ratio of EFAl/FAl changes from 0.18 to 0.1 after EDTA treatment, which indicates the non-framework Al are more easily to be eliminated than the framework Al during acid leaching process. However, it is interesting to note that the intensity of EFAl is disappeared and the intensity of FAl decreases after HCl treatment (2 h). Therefore, the framework aluminum can be partly removed by HCl treatment [28]."
8,NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR analysis of the catalysts,"3.3 NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR analysis of the catalysts Fig. 5 depicted the NH3-TPD curves of H-beta zeolites prepared under different treatment conditions. NH3 desorption peaks at around 220 °C and 350 °C can be attributed to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively. Compared with the parent zeolite, the acid strength of the BEA zeolites after EDTA or HCl treatment is decreased with the peak position shifts to lower temperature or peak intensity decreases, which can be attributed to the removal of the Al species in the zeolite channels [29]. The acidity of BEA zeolite undergoes tremendous change after NaOH treatment with strong acid sites even disappears due to the desilication process by the strong alkali solution. The acid properties of BEA, HCl2 h-BEA, and EDTA8h-BEA were further characterized by the in-situ pyridine-adsorption Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (py-FTIR). The typical peaks at 1540 and 1450 cm−1 are derived from the interactions of pyridine molecules with the Brønsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites, respectively. The characteristic peak at 1490 cm−1 can be attributed to the sum of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The amounts of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites can be further quantified based on the previous literature and the results are shown in the Table 2 [23]. Both of the B and L acid sites decreases after HCl or EDTA treatment compared with that of the parent BEA zeolite due to the extraction of framework and extra-framework Al species by acidic solution [30,31]. However, it should be noted that HCl treatment leads to the higher amount ratio of L to B acid sites, which is beneficial to the oligomerization reaction due to the synergistic effect between the L and B acid sites [23]."
9,Catalytic performance of the catalysts in isobutyl alcohol oligomerization,"3.4 Catalytic performance of the catalysts in isobutyl alcohol oligomerization The conversion of isobutyl alcohol catalyzed over Beta zeolite catalyst and the distribution of olefin products were shown in Fig. 7. It is clear that the conversion of isobutyl alcohol over the modified Beta zeolite dealuminated with respective HCl or EDTA is higher than that of original Beta zeolite. Meanwhile, the conversion of isobutyl alcohol increases with an augment of dealumination time. When the Beta zeolite is dealuminated with HCl for 2 h, the conversion of isobutyl alcohol is up to 98 %, much higher than that of 75 % over original Beta zeolite. However, as Beta zeolite treated by NaOH, the conversion of isobutyl alcohol decreases markedly. As for the produced C4 =, the selectivity is the opposite tendency as that of isobutyl alcohol conversion. As depicted in Fig. 6 , C4 is the primary isobutylene which is formed from isobutyl alcohol dehydration, and C8−16 mainly composes of isobutylene dimer, trimer and tetramer. For isobutyl alcohol oligomerization over Beta zeolite, the pore openings of Beta zeolite as well as molecular size of reactants play critical role in the selectivity of products listed in Table 3 , which is mainly attributed to the shape-selectivity function of zeolite. By dealumination of Beta zeolite with HCl or EDTA, the selectivity of C8−16 is increased. This may be due to a fact that the impurities and the part of aluminum ions on zeolite skeleton and extra framework on Beta zeolite are effectively removed by dealuminated treatment, enlarging the pore size of Beta zeolite and then enhancing the diffusion ability of products. By comparison, the C8−16 selectivity over NaOH-treated Beta zeolite is also obtained, and the C8−16 selectivity is negligible. The result indicates that the acidity of Beta zeolite is responsible for the oligomerization of isobutyl alcohol. In order to further investigate isobutyl alcohol oligomerization reaction, the hydrocarbons distribution of C8−16 over BEA, HCl (2 h) or EDTA (8 h)-treated Beta zeolite was presented in Fig. 8 . For BEA catalyst, the products are primary C8−12, which mainly originates from the cracking of hydrocarbon with large molecule. However, with regard to HCl (2 h) or EDTA (8 h)-treated Beta zeolite, the products distribution shifts to heavy hydrocarbon. It is worth noting that the HCl (2 h) -treated Beta zeolite presents more obvious deviation. This could be explained that both reactions of the isobutyl alcohol dehydration and the isobutylene oligomerization are based on the mechanism of carbonium ions in isobutyl alcohol oligomerization shown in Fig. 9 [32–34]. Brønsted acid is generally deemed as the active center of cracking reaction, large amounts of the Brønsted acid may increase the formation of carbon deposits which will block the acidic site of catalyst and result in the deactivation of catalyst [35], and Lewis acid acts as the active center for isobutylene oligomerization. Although the total acid content greatly reduced after HCl treatment with 2 h, the ratio of Lewis acid to Brønsted acid increased due to the removal of extra-framework aluminum and partial framework aluminum on Beta zeolite, thus promoting the reaction to proceed towards oligomerization. Simultaneously, the oligomerization of isobutylene consumed carbonium ions and thus promoted the dehydration of isobutyl alcohol. All of these factors contributed to the excellent catalytic activity of the Beta zeolite treated with HCl (2 h). Furthermore, Brønsted acid is generally deemed as the active center of cracking reaction, and the relatively weak acid sites on HCl (2 h)-treated Beta zeolite resulted in less products of isobutylene pyrolysis, which consists of C8, C12 and C16 mainly. The carbon balance of the experiment employing catalysts by different treatment is listed in Table 4 . As we can see, it is clear that the carbon balance over the modified Beta zeolite dealuminated with respective HCl or EDTA is better than those over original Beta zeolite. To explain the coke formed during the reaction, TG/DTA was used to analyze the spent catalysts. The results of spent catalysts by different treatments are illustrated in Fig. 10 , which can provide information on the coke weight of spent catalyst. Obviously, the endothermic peak between 400 °C and 600 °C was decreased after the HCl or EDTA treatment. A possible explanation is that Brønsted acid was decreased by the acid treatment, suppressing the formation of carbon deposits [35]. And the pore size and the pore opening were increased due to the removal of impurities and extra-framework aluminum in zeolite after acid pickling. Consequently the catalysts by acid treatment formed less hard coke. On the other hand, the main weight loss of HCl2 h-BEA and EDTA8h-BEA occurred below 200 °C, which might be ascribed to the water in the catalysts. Meanwhile, the carbon balance of HCl2 h-BEA and EDTA8h-BEA is better than those of other catalysts. The effect of reaction time on isobutyl alcohol oligomerization over HCl2 h-BEA is depicted in Fig. 11 . Apparently, the isobutyl alcohol conversion increased rapidly from 30 % to 74 % at first 2 h of reaction and then approached to the maximum with continuous increased reaction time, reaching 98 % at 4 h. As shown in Fig. 11b, the selectivity of oligomeric products(C8−16) displays the similar trend with isobutyl alcohol conversion, which reaches the maximum at 4 h but then decreases slightly after 6 h. The slight decrease of C8−16 selectivity could be attributed to the increase of the by-products (C5−7 and C16 +) with prolonged reaction time. The C4 = selectivity presents almost opposite trend with isobutyl alcohol conversion and C8−16 selectivity. It is because that this reaction system discussed here mainly involved two reactions (isobutyl alcohol dehydration and isobutylene oligomerization), and both reactions could occur at same acid sites of catalyst successively. The isobutyl alcohol is first dehydrated to produce isobutylene and then isobutylene is oligomerized to oligomeric C8−16 products. However, by prolonging the reaction time, about 20 % C4 = still exists and could not be converted completely, which maybe because that the generated C16 + products blocked the acid site of HCl2 h-BEA catalyst and led to deactivation of catalyst. However, this process is promising as a new way to produce jet fuels with the potential to be an industrialization technology, so, the regeneration of the catalysts would be important. In order to investigate the regenerability of cataytlys, the spent HCl2 h-BEA after 8 h of reaction is calcined in the air at 600 °C, and the catalytic performance of the regenerated catalyst was shown in Fig. 12 . It is obvious that the calcined HCl2 h-BEA fully recovered the catalytic performances and the conversion and C8−16 selectivity is very similar to those of the fresh catalyst. It is probably because that although some oligomeric products adsorbed strongly on active acid sites or the generated C16 + products blocked the channels of zeolite, which leads to deactivation of the catalyst, they does not destroy the pore structure and active site of beta zeolite. Therefore, the regeneration of this catalyst is easily, which make the HCl2 h-BEA catalyst as an attractively potential catalyst for isobutyl alcohol oligomerization."
10,Conclusions,"In this paper, we used various dealuminization methods, with HCl and EDTA as acids, to treat zeolite, by which to effectively adjust the pore structure and acidity of Beta zeolite. With the obtained zeolite as catalysts, we also investigated their catalytic performance for isobutyl alcohol oligomerization to synthesize jet fuels. Although undergoing dealumination processes, the Beta zeolite still remains its integrated channels and framework. The employed dealumination process could effectively remove the extra-framework aluminum and impurities. As a result, the pores of zeolite samples become smoother, by which to further improve their catalytic activity. Due to the dealumination process, the total acidic sites and the number of Brønsted acid sites on zeolite were reduced to some extent. However, the increased ratio of Lewis/Brønsted acidic sites was available for promoting the oligomerization reaction step to form jet fuels. Meanwhile, the promoted oligomerization reaction step also facilitated the dehydration reaction step of isobutyl alcohol. Among the tested catalysts, the HCL2 h-BEA catalyst exhibited the highest conversion of 98 % and the highest C8−16 selectivity of 59 %. In addition, after removing the carbon deposit on this HCL2 h-BEA catalyst by calcination, this spent catalyst also given similar catalytic performance to its fresh one."
