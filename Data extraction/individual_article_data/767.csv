0,Introduction,"During the last decades, a significant increase in the energy demand has been noticed followed by a massive utilization of fossil fuels in developing countries [1]. During the coming years, the use of renewable energy is apparently going to grow in various ways. Production of hydrogen for fuel cells and other industrial applications from biomass is a part of the quest for a sustainable future. Nowadays the main part of hydrogen is produced through energy intensive steam reforming of methane [2] releasing substantial amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Dumesic and co-workers in 2002 developed a single-step process coined the aqueous phase reforming or APR [3] for production of renewable hydrogen and/or alkanes from sugars and polyols at a much lower temperature using heterogeneous catalysts. This process is considered as a viable option for production of hydrogen and alkanes from biomass derived oxygenated compounds even if currently it is almost impossible to position APR as a viable alternative to methane steam reforming. APR in general is considered as a two-step process comprising transformations of a certain substrate into H2 and CO on metal-supported catalysts at low temperature (200–250 °C) and high pressures (20–40 atm) followed by the water gas shift reaction, generating additional hydrogen. Aqueous phase reforming has thus multiple advantages such as neutral greenhouse gas emissions [4], lower energy consumption compared to steam reforming, and utilization of water as a solvent and as a reactant giving additional hydrogen via the water gas shift [5]. An extensive metal screening was performed for supported catalysts in aqueous phase reforming [5,6]. Platinum was shown to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production, which can be even further improved by addition of a second transition metal [7]. Palladium displayed a good potential as the second metal to obtain high selectivity to hydrogen [4]. While several attempts have been made to find a replacement of this expensive metal, however, they have been only partially successful because of stability issues related to sintering, oxidation and metal leaching [3,5,8,9]. The structure sensitivity aspects were discussed in the context of APR [10,11] showing that for glycerol the reaction was structure insensitive. The reaction pathways depend, however, strongly on the catalyst support. Polarity, hydrophobicity and especially acidity play an essential role in the final product distribution [10]. Oxide supports with a higher electron donating character resulted in an increase in activity and selectivity to hydrogen [12]. The APR shows a pH influence on the distribution of the reaction products for some catalysts. Basic conditions tend to promote hydrogen formation leading, however, to catalyst deactivation. A higher carbon chain length in the reactants results in a higher selectivity to alkanes [13]. Hydrogen has an important role in selectivity to alkanes. Therefore, it is imperative to have a control on the hydrogen partial pressures to decrease this effect [14] when hydrogen is the desired product. An increase of the hydrogen and carbon dioxide partial pressures drives the water gas shift reaction in the reverse direction leading to carbon monoxide covering the metal surface and thus decreasing catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity [5]. APR of C5 and C6 polyols is typically done with individual model compounds [5,15] even if more industrially relevant mixtures (e.g. produced by hydrogenation of sucrose) were also studied [16]. It has been recently demonstrated [17], that the economic feasibility of APR depends substantially on the feedstock costs. In this context, it is important to have access to polyols, produced in an efficient way from lignocellulosic biomass. One of the technologies for fractionation of such feedstock includes extraction of hemicelluloses with their subsequent hydrolysis in the presence of formic acid [18]. To address the potential role of formic acid, the APR of polyol mixtures in the presence of formic acid was studied in the current work. Previous APR studies using xylitol and alcohols with two or three carbon atoms demonstrated efficient catalytic behavior of Pt supported on carbon [10,15,23] resulting in high activity and selectivity in the case of glycerol [15] and xylitol [10]. Monometallic 3 wt% Pt on silica catalyst was clearly superior compared to other monometallic catalysts including Pd tested in APR of ethylene glycol [23]. Addition of a second metal such as Ni or Co improves activity, while incorporation of rhenium elevating activity simultaneously increases selectivity to production of alkanes at the expense of hydrogen formation [23]. No specific role of palladium as a second metal was reported in the literature for APR of polyols with supported platinum catalysts. The same result was seen in the preliminary experiments of the authors on APR of a mixture of xylose and formic acid over Pt/C and PtPd/C catalysts giving essentially the same activity and selectivity. The specific role of adding palladium is thus in influencing decomposition of formic acid. In fact, decomposition of formic acid to hydrogen and CO2 per se [19,20] and as an aid to enhance hydrogenation [21] has been investigated intensively. It has been demonstrated [22] that, in particular, palladium catalysts can efficiently decompose formic acid. Therefore, a bimetallic catalyst, comprising platinum and palladium, was selected to combine respectively APR of sugar alcohols with decomposition of formic acid. In the current work, APR of a range of polyols relevant in the context of reactive extraction of hemicelluloses in the presence of formic acid was performed. To this end ethylene glycol, glycerol, erythritol and sorbitol were selected as model compounds. Data for these substrates, including the work done by the present authors, are mainly available at the reaction temperature of 225 °C. In fact, in the previous studies, the experimental work was performed only at temperatures higher than 210 °C [5]. Apparently, there is a need to explore lower temperatures such as 200 °C studied in the current work to observe its influence on activity and selectivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals PdCl2 (Kraszvetmet, Krasnoyarsk, Russia) and H2PtCl6 (Kraszvetmet, Krasnoyarsk, Russia) was used as a catalyst precursor. For the preparation of the carbon supported catalysts, mesoporous carbon Sibunit (fraction 250–500 μm, SBET = 350 m2∙g−1) was applied. The polyols used in the work were ethylene glycol (Fluka, 99.5%), glycerol (Fisher BioReagents, 99.5%), erythritol (Acros Organics, 99%) and sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%)."
3,Catalyst and catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst and catalyst preparation The catalyst containing 2.50 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Pd supported on a mesoporous carbon Sibunit was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a solution of PdCl2 (0.1 M) and H2PtCl6 (0.1 M). Thereafter, the samples were dried at 110 °C for 17 h and reduced by molecular hydrogen from room temperature up to 400 °C with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min. In addition, the samples were treated with hydrogen during 3 h at 400 °C to remove the excess of chloride. XPS analysis (not shown) was performed to confirm that the content of chloride in the catalyst is at the level of noise."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The metal dispersion was determined by CO chemisorption using a Micromeritics 2910 AutoChem instrument. The CO-metal ratio was assumed to be unity in the calculations. Prior to the CO chemisorption at 25 °C the catalyst was reduced at 250 °C under a flow of hydrogen. Scanning and transmission electron micrographs were also taken from the catalyst surface with a Leo 1530 Gemini and a Jeol JEM-1400 microscopes, respectively."
5,Set-up,"2.4 Set-up Fig. 1 presents the setup, which was used in catalytic experiments. This system included a co-current trickle bed reactor to which nitrogen, containing 1% helium, was fed along with the liquid phase i.e. the 3 wt% of a polyol in aqueous solution. The reactor had a length of 50 cm with an inner diameter of 4.6 mm. The catalyst comprising 2.50 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Pd supported on mesoporous carbon Sibunit was diluted by glass beads in a weight proportion of 1:6. The liquid phase was pumped by a HPLC pump (Elmex 1SM) and the gas phase was fed through the flow controller MFC-1. Downstream the reactor, the pressure was controlled by a membrane pressure controller Equilibar (U3L Ultra Low Flow Back Pressure Regulator). After the pressure controller (PC-1) located downstream the reactor, the gas-liquid separator was placed, operating at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In the separator, the liquid samples were collected to be analysed offline by the liquid chromatography (Hewlett Packard series 1100). The gas phase was led through a condenser at −5 °C to prevent clogging of the micro gas chromatograph (Agilent 3000A). After the condenser, most of the gas phase was vented and the rest was routed to the micro-GC for the on-line analysis of the gas stream. The hydrogen line in Fig. 1 was used during reduction of the catalyst performed at 250 °C with a constant flow of hydrogen (30 ml/min) for 2 h. Heating to the desired temperature under hydrogen flow was done at a ramp 5 °C/min."
6,Analysis of products,"2.5 Analysis of products The micro-GC used in the experiment was Agilent 3000A equipped with four columns: Plot U, OV-1, Alumina and Molsieve. The calibration was done for 17 gases. Twelve alkanes with the carbon chain ranging from C1 to C7 as well as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium and carbon monoxide were calibrated. The twelve alkanes calibrated were methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, n-pentane, iso-pentane, neo-pentane, n-hexane, iso-hexane, c-hexane and n-heptane. Ten samples of each gas were taken for calibration. The high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) was a Hewlett Packard series 1100 equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column. The analysis was performed at 45 °C under isocratic conditions and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of 5 mM aqueous solution of H2SO4. The products were analyzed by using a refractive index detector (RI). For HPLC analysis, it was necessary to identify different substrates present in the liquid samples. After the substrate identification the calibration was made for 28 compounds using solutions of different concentrations. The calibrated compounds were sorbitol, arabitol, xylitol, erythritol, glycolaldehyde, lactic acid, glycerol, acetic acid, ethylene glycol, propane-1,2-diol, propane-1,3-diol, methanol, 1,2 butanediol, ethanol, propanol. Precision of analysis was typically 1–3%."
7,Catalytic experiments:,"2.6 Catalytic experiments: Two kinds of experiments were performed with different substrates. The first one was with 3 wt% of aqueous solutions of a particular polyol, while in the second one, the solutions also contained 2 wt% of formic acid. The liquid flow was 0.1 ml/min and the gas flow was 36.4 ml/min. During the experiments two different temperatures were tested, namely 200 and 225 °C. The pressure was fixed at 32 bar for both temperatures. Previously it was demonstrated that the selected reaction conditions and the size of catalyst particles allow elimination of the mass transfer limitations [10]. The following equations were used to quantify the products from different experiments. Conversion of the substrates was calculated assuming that the volumetric flow ( V · ) did not change during the reaction, therefore concentrations obtained by HPLC can be used directly: (1) X % = C in - C out C in ∗ 100 % where Cin is the inlet concentration and Cout is the outlet concentration. The selectivity to hydrogen was defined as: (2) H 2 s e l e c t i v i t y % = outflow o f h y d r o g e n ∗ 2 total a m o u n t o f h y d r o g e n i n t h e g a s p h a s e p r o d u c t s ∗ 100 % where the flow is defined in mol/min. The total amount of hydrogen in the gas phase products corresponded to the sum of every identified product molar flow multiplied by the number of hydrogen atoms in the respective molecule. Selectivity to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and the alkanes was calculated as: (3) Product s e l e c t i v i t y % = carbon i n t h e p r o d u c t total a m o u n t o f c a r b o n i n t h e g a s p h a s e p r o d u c t s ∗ 100 % Similar to hydrogen selectivity the total amount of carbon in the gas phase products was calculated through the sum of every identified product molar flows multiplied by the number of carbon atoms in the respective molecule. The amount of carbon in a particular product and the total amount were expressed in mol/min. The specific catalytic activity to a particular product was calculated from the following relationship: (4) Specific a c t i v i t y = molar f l o w o f t h e p r o d u c t mol m i n mols o f P t i n t h e c a t a l y s t b e d ( m o l ) , 1 / m i n Only platinum was taken into account in these calculations in order to compare the results with the literature data as Pt was considered to be the catalytically active metal, while the role of Pd was to decompose formic acid."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The apparent metal dispersion reflecting both metals in the bimetallic catalyst was determined by CO chemisorption to be 47%. The surface composition of the catalyst, analysed by SEM-EDX, was found to contain 1.3 wt% Pd and 4.8 wt% Pt, which is approximately twofold of the nominal loading. This result can be explained by predominant location of metals close to the outer surface of fairly large carbon particles. The TEM presented in Fig. 2 illustrates that the average metal cluster size is ca.1.5 nm."
10,Catalytic results,"3.2 Catalytic results The effect of the carbon chain length in the APR of polyos was studied over the catalyst containing 2.50 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Pd supported in the mesoporous carbon Sibunit. The experiments were compared in terms of activity, selectivity, distribution of alkanes and the liquid phase composition. Application of 46 molecules for the calibration with a high reliability gave very good carbon identification resulting in the carbon balance closure of ca. 100% for every substrate. Fig. 3 accounting for APR of ethylene glycol as well as other figures below show the results of long-term experiments when the feed and temperature were changed for the same catalyst load. Otherwise for each polyol a separate experiment was conducted with a new reactor utilizing the same amount of catalyst, taken from the same batch. APR of ethylene glycol (Fig. 3) resulted in the average conversion of 65% at 200 °C and 85% at 225 °C. In terms of reactivity expressed through turnover frequency the results are in line with the performance of mono and bimetallic platinum catalysts studied in the literature [23] as will be discussed later. While the catalytic behaviour was rather stable at 200 °C, the activity deteriorated with time on stream at 225 °C. A decrease from ca. 90 to ca. 75% of conversion was noticed after 180 min of time-on-stream. However, the selectivity remained constant with values of ca. 100% for H2 and CO2. These values showed an improvement in the catalytic performance with a lower production of alkanes compared to Pt/C catalyst [24], where, for example, the molar ratio between carbon dioxide and methane was reported to be equal to 8.4. Addition of formic acid to the ethylene glycol solution did not cause essential changes in the ethylene glycol APR at 200 °C. However, at 225 °C a decrease in the ethylene glycol activity was noticed while selectivity was fairly constant and the formic acid conversion was complete during the entire process. APR of glycerol (Fig. 4 ) exhibited a lower conversion than ethylene glycol with a values of ca. 10% at 200 °C. Interestingly the initial value of conversion was much higher at 225 °C and the final value of conversion at this temperature was ca. 70% similarly to ethylene glycol and erythritol, discussed below. This interesting behaviour of glycerol at a lower temperature can be connected to differences in dehydrogenation at this temperature and requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the catalyst used in the current work was at least two-fold more active compared with supported Pt and Pd catalysts reported previously [25,26]. Selectivity was shown to be related to the reaction temperature. At 200 °C the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide was close to 90% while it was 10% towards alkanes. During the experiment at 225 °C selectivity to hydrogen and alkanes was stable not changing with TOS. Carbon monoxide was detected with a 7% selectivity, decreasing therefore the carbon dioxide selectivity to 83%. As a comparison almost no CO was formed in the case of ethylene glycol APR (Fig. 3). According to the literature, presence of CO in the gas phase can have a negative effect on activity [4]. A potential negative influence of CO can be anticipated to be even more pronounced for the catalyst used in the current work, as it contains Pd known for its ability to strongly bind CO. A decrease of catalytic activity at 225 °C in the case of glycerol (Fig. 4) and erythritol (Fig. 5 ) is probably associated with poisoning by CO. Similar behavior was also observed in APR of sorbitol as discussed later in the text. Addition of formic acid did not cause important changes in the APR of glycerol in terms of reactivity. Selectivity, however, exhibited changes under both conditions. A decrease in the production of alkanes was noticed at 200 °C resulting in the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide of 100%. At 225 °C the selectivity of carbon monoxide and alkanes decreased gradually to 5%, while, selectivity to H2 and CO2 increased to 95%. The APR of erythritol (Fig. 5) displayed a high variability in the activity during the entire process. The conversion was in the range between 50 and 30% at 200 °C being higher than that of glycerol APR (10%) under similar conditions. At a higher temperature (225 °C) the conversion increased to 70% decreasing thereafter with time-on-stream. Nevertheless, under both conditions, the product selectivity was similar to the APR of glycerol. Selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide of 90% was observed, while selectivity to alkanes was close to 10% at a low temperature 200 °C (Fig. 5). At 225 °C the hydrogen and alkane selectivity was maintained, while the carbon dioxide production decreased at the expense of the formation of carbon monoxide. Activity in the APR of erythritol in the presence of formic acid was maintained at 200 °C with some differences at the beginning of the experiment showing, however, a stable performance at a longer time on stream. This result is in good agreement with the APR of ethylene glycol and glycerol. However, at a higher temperature (225 °C) the results were different giving an important increase in the activity for erythritol APR, which became the most active substrate under these conditions with conversion equal to 98%. Selectivity exhibited a similar behaviour as for glycerol APR. At 225 °C the addition of formic acid suppressed the carbon monoxide formation illustrating a more prominent water gas shift reaction. Formic acid was completely converted in the mixture with erythritol similar to the APR of ethylene glycol and glycerol. APR of sorbitol at 200 °C (Fig. 6 ) exhibited a behaviour different from other substrates, namely displaying an activity increase during the entire experiment. An averaged activity was similar to the APR of erythritol (ca. 45%). At 225 °C, the activity increased significantly resulting in complete conversion. Moreover, selectivity to hydrogen, being similar to APR of glycerol and erythritol, was better with this catalyst than reported in the literature for APR of sorbitol [12,27]. It should be noted that conversion levels in [12,27] were the same as achieved in the current work at 225 °C. Minor amounts of carbon monoxide were detected in the gas phase. The presence of formic acid in the sorbitol APR increased the stability and activity at 200 °C, while a decrease in the conversion from 70 to 45% was observed at 225 °C. Under both conditions, the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide increased upon introduction of formic acid while formation of alkanes was suppressed. In addition to the activity decrease when formic acid was added at 225 °C, the carbon monoxide formation was noticed with a 5% selectivity suggesting a lower activity of the water gas shift reaction and subsequently potential catalyst poisoning by CO. All polyols exhibited high selectivity to hydrogen and CO2. To assess the efficiency of a polyol transformations to carbon dioxide the yield of the latter was calculated as the percentage of converted substrate transformed into the final product (CO2). Ethylene glycol APR displayed the CO2 yields of 77.3% and 87.1% at 200 °C and 225 °C, respectively. In the presence of formic acid, the carbon dioxide yield decreased to 56% at 200 °C, which can be related to inhibition of further transformations of the intermediates present in the liquid phase. Other polyols demonstrated a comparable behaviour increasing the yield of CO2 with the temperature elevation and formic acid addition (Table 1 ). Interestingly the erythritol APR in the presence of formic acid exhibited a similar yield at both temperatures. More discussion on the transformations of polyols to the liquid phase intermediates influencing the carbon dioxide yield is provided in Section 3.5 covering the carbon balance. An evaluation of the specific catalytic activity for bimetallic catalysts is not straightforward because both metals can contribute to catalysis. For the sake of clarity and easier comparison with the literature data, Table 2 summarizes the values of the specific catalyst activity calculated per total mole of platinum obtained in the present work and the values of TOF (per exposed site) reported in the literature. It can be clearly seen from Table 2 that the specific catalytic activity in general has a trend of decreasing its value upon the chain length increase except for the APR of sorbitol. According to the mechanism of polyols APR [17,18] a key step in the reaction mechanism is dehydrogenation of a corresponding polyol, which is becoming less prominent upon the chain length increase from two to four carbon atoms. Sorbitol is apparently a special case which can be probably related to the cyclic nature of the aldehyde formed by dehydrogenation. The values of specific activity for the catalyst tested in this work have a trend similar to the results reported in the literature. Moreover, even the absolute values are comparable. For example, the value of specific catalytic activity for ethylene glycol of 5.7 min−1 gives the TOF value of 8.6 min−1 for the exposed metal site taking into account the average platinum metal dispersion from TEM. This value of TOF is in good correspondence with the literature value of 7.5 min−1 considering the experimental errors in determination of conversion and especially metal dispersion."
11,Behaviour of alkanes,"3.3 Behaviour of alkanes In the aqueous phase reforming of polyols an important issue is the production of alkanes, because these side products diminish the hydrogen consumption making the process less attractive by a decrease of the H2:CO2 ratio. Hence, during the experiments, the formation of each alkane was quantified. The APR of ethylene glycol displayed a high selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Thus, selectivity to alkanes was low (Fig. 7 a). The highest selectivity was observed for butane at 200 °C being nevertheless lower than 0.4%. After butane the most abundant alkane was methane with a selectivity of 0.2%. This result is similar to carbon supported Pt and Pd catalysts [23,24]. During the experiments in the presence of formic acid, the selectivity to each alkane was lower than 0.1%, with methane being the most important alkane. The experiment with glycerol showed (Fig. 7b) a rather high selectivity to methane i.e. 8% at both temperatures similar to previous experiments reported for Pt supported on alumina [28], while other alkanes exhibited a low selectivity, e.g. C4 displayed selectivity of 1.1% at 200 °C. Glycerol thus exhibited an APR behaviour different from ethylene glycol. The presence of formic acid diminished the selectivity to alkanes with the magnitude dependent on temperature. The highest selectivity of 0.5% starting from glycerol was observed for C4 at 225 °C. Nevertheless, after addition of formic acid the most selective alkanes were C4 hydrocarbons. Erythritol APR (Fig. 7c) showed a high selectivity to ethane followed by methane without distribution changes upon the temperature increase or formic acid addition. The alkane distribution was clearly different from the APR of ethylene glycol and glycerol. Addition of formic acid did not change the distribution of alkanes similarly to the APR of glycerol. The selectivity in the APR of sorbitol (Fig. 7d) to alkanes was low with a maximum 2.4% for methane at 200 °C. Methane and ethane were the main products among alkanes as also reported in the literature for APR of sorbitol and galactitol [14,27]. Moreover, while APR of sorbitol similarly to the APR of erythritol gave mainly C2 and C1 alkanes, the latter was predominantly formed in the case of sorbitol, while C2 was generated for erythritol APR. Formic acid addition decreased the alkane production resulting in a more uniform distribution of alkanes at 200 °C. It should be noted that in the APR of each substrate it was possible to find alkanes with a carbon number larger than in the substrate pointing out on the presence of condensation reactions."
12,Liquid phase composition,"3.4 Liquid phase composition In aqueous phase reforming of polyols, the product analysis of the liquid phase is one of the biggest challenges. As reported by Kirilin et al. [12] in APR of sorbitol over 260 compounds could be identified. Therefore, it is necessary to have a reliable determination of the major products to close the mass balance. During this work, it was possible to detect 28 reaction products in the liquid phase with a very high degree of product identification for all the reactants. The level of the liquid-phase products identification for erythritol and sorbitol APR was close to 100%. Determination of C2 and C3 polyols among the reaction intermediates of larger molecules shows that a majority of polyols could have similar reaction paths. Distribution of the liquid phase products in ethylene glycol APR given in Fig. 8 a shows five intermediates with low concentrations. Although 16 compounds were identified only five of them were present in the liquid phase APR of all the substrates. Methanol exhibited the highest concentration, which increased with temperature. The products presented in the liquid phase of ethylene glycol were similar to those reported previously in the literature [24]. The liquid phase in APR of glycerol (Fig. 8b) is characterized by low concentrations of intermediates and changes in the distribution upon the temperature increase and addition of formic acid. At 200 °C the most abundant product was ethanol, while propane diols were more prominent at 225 °C. The liquid phase products in glycerol APR have been reported previously [29] to include all the liquid products from ethylene glycol APR. However, APR of a mixture, containing glycerol and formic acid, resulted in a decrease of the concentration of the intermediates produced without any formation of additional intermediates. The liquid phase of erythritol APR (Fig. 8c) is characterized by a substantial amount of methanol as observed in the APR of ethylene glycol. Propanediol exhibited the second largest concentration, being identified as an intermediate of the glycerol APR. Hence, the liquid phase in the erythritol APR exhibited the presence of the products appearing in the APR of smaller polyols. The amount of intermediates was increased because of the presence of some C4 products as butanol and butanediols. Even if the composition of the liquid phase products in the sorbitol APR (Fig. 8d) was changing with the variation of the reaction conditions (i.e. temperature and formic acid addition), the overall behaviour was similar to erythritol with methanol and propane diols being the most important liquid phase products. Moreover, the presence of all products observed in the erythritol APR and some C5 and C6 alcohols in the liquid phase suggests evident similarities between APR of different polyols. More specifically, the routes to the liquid phase products are the same for all polyols. Summarising it can be stated that methanol and propane diols were the most important reaction products present in the liquid phase for every substrate under the experimental conditions studied. It is important to emphasize that methanol as an intermediate in the ethylene glycol APR was reported in the literature [30] while propanediol has been described as an intermediate in the glycerol APR [28]. The composition of the liquid phase could be considered as an evidence of similar reaction pathways for all the polyols and generation of shorter chains polyols from the longer ones during the APR."
13,Carbon balance,"3.5 Carbon balance The carbon balance is a useful tool for the analysis of the overall mass balance. The carbon content was quantified both in the liquid and the gas phases. Evaluation of the carbon balance was done by quantification of the calibrated molecules (28 in the liquid phase and 17 in the gas phase). More gas phase products were formed upon addition of formic acid and temperature elevation. The carbon balance in the ethylene glycol APR was almost complete under all conditions as exemplified by values close to 100% for every liquid and gas carbon flow identified (Fig. 9 a). The values above 100% in the liquid and gas phases (i.e. Liq + Gas in Fig. 9) can be explained by experimental errors. The carbon balance indicated that at 225 °C most of carbon was released to the gas phase. The presence of formic acid did not result in changes in the carbon balance behaviour. The carbon balance for glycerol was complete (Fig. 9b). Most of carbon remained in the liquid phase at 200 °C due to a low catalytic activity in the glycerol APR. However, introduction of formic acid increased the amount of gas phase products at both temperatures. The carbon amount in the gas phase at 225 °C was similar to the liquid phase, however, in presence of formic acid the gas phase became the phase with the higher amount of identified carbon. Fig. 9 also illustrates the concentration of the initial substrate in the liquid phase, which in comparison to the total amount of carbon in the same phase reflects the level of a polyol transformations to the liquid-phase intermediates. The APR of erythritol displayed a complete carbon balance (Fig. 9c). At 225 °C with formic acid addition it was possible to observe an increase of the gas phase products. In that sense operation at 225 °C in the presence of formic acid was the optimal among the screened conditions because most of carbon was present in the gas phase. The overall carbon balance and the influence of operation conditions in APR of sorbitol were similar to other substrates (Fig. 9d) with a larger content of gas-phase products in this case compared to C3 and C4 polyols. Interestingly the largest amount of gas phase products was obtained in the case of ethylene glycol. There is clearly a correlation between the specific catalytic activity (Table 1) and the ratio between the gas and liquid phase products. Not surprisingly a higher catalytic activity inevitably gives more carbon in the gas phase."
14,Conclusions,"A bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon Sibunit was used in the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol, glycerol, erythritol and sorbitol per se at 200 and 225 °C and in the presence of formic acid as a compound used in extraction of hemicelluloses from lignocellulosic biomass. APR of polyols was in general highly selective to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Introduction of formic acid and temperature elevation had a positive impact on H2 and CO2 production. The specific catalytic activity was decreasing upon the chain length increase except the data obtained for sorbitol. The latter is a special case among other polyols as the first step of the reaction – dehydrogenation of an alcohol to a corresponding aldehyde results in a compound which can have a cyclic nature. The same trend of the carbon chain influence was observed for the split between the products in the gas and liquid phases. APR of sorbitol gave a larger content of gas-phase products compared to C3 and C4 polyols, which was still lower than the gas generation for ethylene glycol as the substrate. Hydrogen and CO2 were the main gas phase products. Methane and ethane were the most abundant alkanes for sorbitol APR, while for the case of erythritol selectivity to ethane was rather high reaching ca. 7%. For glycerol APR besides methane also n-butane was formed in almost the same amounts. In this and in other cases generation of hydrocarbons with carbon chains longer than in the substrate suggests the presence of condensation reactions. Butane was also the dominating alkane in the case of ethylene glycol APR, although in this case, overall very low amounts of alkanes were formed compared to APR of other polyols. The liquid phase analysis pointed out on a strong interrelation between the reaction paths for different polyols. The molecules identified in the smaller polyols APR were a helpful starting point to recognize the compounds in APR of other substrates. Selectivity analysis and product identification revealed important similarities between the reaction paths in the liquid and the gas phase. This gives a possibility to explore the mechanism the APR of longer chain substrates by studying smaller substrates as model building blocks."
