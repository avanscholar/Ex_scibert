0,Introduction,"It is a promising way to synthesize valuable chemicals from biomass in substitution of fossil resources because biomass is the only renewable carbon-containing resource. Some typical biomass platforms are widely used for preparation of fine chemicals or fuels. Hydrogenation is one of useful processes in the high valorization of biomass. To achieve this process, heterogeneous catalysts have been widely used, especially metal oxide supported transition metals (Tomishige et al., 2017, 2020). Nickel is often adopted in hydrogenation process owing to its low price. For instance, Ni catalysts are very usually adopted in the upgrading of guaiacol by hydrogenation. In order to improve the activity of Ni, some strategies were employed. Ardizzone et al. used a series of Ni supported on alumina-silica in H2 at 50 bar and 300 °C and found that the more acidic the isoelectric point resulted the better performance of the catalyst (Broglia et al., 2019). Song et al. prepared NixPy/SiO2-TiO2 and used it in hydrogenation of guaiacol. The performance and characterization showed that the existence of a strong interaction between TiO2-x species and NixPy particles caused electron transfer from TiO2-x species to the NixPy surface, and TiO2-x species on the NixPy surface promoted the adsorption and activation of the CO bond in the guaiacol molecule, thus the activity was enhanced (Zhang et al., 2019a). Another work by Zhang et al. also revealed similar conclusion, i.e., the synergetic effect between Ni and TiO2 promoted the hydrogenation of guaiacol (Zhang et al., 2019b). Another instance for the utilization of Ni in the conversion of biomass by hydrogenation is the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran. Ma et al. prepared Cu-Ni/Biochar catalyst for selective hydrodeoxygenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran and the synergetic effect between alloyed Cu-Ni and Lewis acid sites from NiOx was proved (Zhu et al., 2019). Fatty acid is widely existed in many oilseed crops, and still underdeveloped. That provides us new opportunities and challenges in utilization (Zanetti et al., 2013). So fatty acid and oil has become another biomass platform, which can be hydrogenated into fatty alcohol or alkane. The former is an important intermediates for surfactants, lubricants, organic synthesis, and plasticizers. The latter is usually used as bio-fuel. Recent developments of hydrogenation of fatty acid usually involved mono- and bimetallic catalysts (Tamura et al., 2020). Wang et al. developed a low-cost and effective NiFe bimetallic catalyst with a remarkable performance in the conversion of fatty acid to alcohol (Kong et al., 2018). The synergetic effect between Ni and FeOx species played a key role in the selective hydrogenation of fatty acid to alcohol, where FeOx species was responsible for the adsorption of carboxyl groups while Ni was in the charge of dissociating hydrogen molecular. Tomishige et al. modified Rh or Ru with MoOx to catalyze amino acid or lactic acid to corresponding alcohol respectively (Tamura et al., 2014, 2015). Bimetallic Re-Pd catalyst was also a strategy to convert carboxylic acid to alcohol (Takeda et al., 2015, 2016). They thought that the interface between metal species was active reaction site. Lercher et al. has developed a series of Ni/ZrO2 catalysts for the hydrogenation of stearic acid or oil to alkane at 240−300 °C and around 4 MPa H2(Foraita et al., 2015, 2017; Peng et al., 2012, 2013). Two main paths, hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodecarbonation, influenced the alkanes distribution, which was determined by acidity of ZrO2 support. Detailed research showed that hydrogenation of the fatty acid is either catalyzed solely by metallic Ni to form aldehyde or catalyzed by synergistic Ni and the ZrO2 support (Peng et al., 2012). Other Ni-based catalysts such as phosphide (Peroni et al., 2017, 2016) and sulphide (Wagenhofer et al., 2017) were also developed. Yoosuk et al. used Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst to partially hydrogenate palm oil. In this way eco-friendly lubricant could be prepared (Shomchoam and Yoosuk, 2014). Chen et al. synthesized a series of Pt/SAPO-11 for one-step catalytic hydrotreatment of castor oil to C8-C16 alkanes. La, Ce, Sn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn were added to change the catalyst properties. La was found to be the best promoter because it increased the acid sites and decreased the crystalline size of Pt (Chen et al., 2020). Another method to covert oil to fuel is pyrolysis. Li et al. created an acid and base based on SBA-15 bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn, to produce hydrocarbon from waste cooking oils. They found that Lewis acid sites could break CC bond to form hydrocarbons and short-chain fatty acid, while base sites could deoxidize fatty acid. This synergy effect improves the quality of biofuel and simplifies the production process (Shitao et al., 2020). In our previous work, our group has developed a series of Nb based materials, such as Nb2O5 (Shao et al., 2017), Nb2O5-SiO2 (Shao et al., 2015) and NbOPO4 (Xi et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016, 2014), after loading Pt, Ru or Pd, catalysts with excellent ability of HDO have been obtained. These catalysts have exhibited superior activity of HDO in the conversion of biomass or its derivatives. The good performance in HDO of biomass or its derivatives originate from the outstanding affinity of NbOx species with oxygen atoms or groups in the reactants. Although we have done many efforts on the synergy between NbOx species and noble metal, we have not studied the synergetic effect between NbOx species and Ni. Here, we present a systematic investigation on the preparation, characterization and catalytic property of Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) catalysts in hydrogenation of palmitic acid. Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) of varying Nb compositions (x = 5, 10 and 20, weight percent of Nb2O5) are employed to understand any possible support effect. Kinetic analysis of hydrogenation reaction is conducted to gain information on the catalytic mechanism and synergy effect between Ni and NbOx in Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) catalysts."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were purchased from Lingfeng Materials Technology Shanghai Co., Ltd, palmitic acid was purchased from TCI, and commercial Nb2O5 was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All other chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used without purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Nb precursor (niobium citrate) was prepared according to the literature procedure (Sarkar and Pramanik, 2009), and a niobium citrate solution with a Nb concentration of 0.4 mol⋅L−1 was prepared for use. Nb2O5-SiO2 with different Nb2O5 content was prepared by a sol–gel method in the presence of citric acid, which is an effective method for the synthesis of thermally stable mesoporous aluminophosphate materials or mesoporous silica-based materials (Liu et al., 2004, 2009; Liu et al., 2012). The detailed process is as follows: a certain amount of niobium citrate (50.0 mL) and TEOS (89.2 mL) was mixed under stirring. After aging for 2 h, the mixture was heated at 50 °C to remove water and all other volatiles to afford the as-synthesized precursor. Finally, the dried solid was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h (heating rate 5 °C⋅ min−1), and the 10 wt%Nb2O5-SiO2 (Nb2O5-SiO2 (10)) sample was obtained. The Nb2O5-SiO2 (5) and Nb2O5-SiO2 (20) catalysts were prepared by the same method with the amount of TEOS changed to 175.1 ml and 36.9 mL, respectively. The pure support of Nb2O5 and SiO2 for reference were synthesized by the similar sol-gel method. Only niobium citrate solution as the precursor for preparation of Nb2O5, while only TEOS was mixed with the solution of citric acid for preparing SiO2. Ni-based catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method with appropriate amounts of aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. The obtained sample was dried at 50 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 3 h (heating rate 2 °C⋅ min−1). The Ni loading was fixed at 10 wt%. The Ni-based catalysts were reduced in a flowing gas of 10 % H2/Ar mixture at 500 °C for 3 h before use."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The powder XRD patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/max-2550VB/PC diffractometer by using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M sorption analyzer. Before the measurements, the samples were outgassed at 200 °C for 12 h under vacuum to remove moisture and volatile impurities. The TEM images were recorded with a FEI Tecnai F20s-TWIN instrument, and the electron-beam accelerating voltage was 200 kV. H2-TPR tests were operated on Huasi DAS-7200 automatic chemisorption instrument. 50 mg sample was pretreated in Ar (30 mL/min) at 150 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. A reducing gas containing 5 %H2/95 %Ar was employed at a flow rate of 30 ml/min and a heating rate of 10 °C/min from ambient temperature to 800 °C, using a TCD detector to monitor the H2 consumption."
5,Catalytic test and products analysis,"2.4 Catalytic test and products analysis Hydrogenation reactions were performed in a high-pressure batch reactor. Unless otherwise specified, the autoclave was loaded with 6.46 g of cyclohexane (AR, Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd.), 0.1−0.7 g of palmitic acid (AR, Sigma-Aldrich), and a certain amount of catalyst. After purging with H2 (∼0.8 MPa) for 3 times, the autoclave was pressurized to a H2 pressure of 2.0 MPa at room temperature. Zero reaction time was taken as soon as the autoclave was heated to the desired reaction temperature (e.g., 250 °C), and the mechanical stirring was not switched on until that very moment. Around 20 min were needed to reach the target temperature. Preliminary experiments performed using varying stirring speeds (in the range of 300−900 rpm, Fig. 1 ) showed that the selected stirring speed (800 rpm) enabled the reaction to proceed in the absence of diffusion limitation under the present reaction conditions. The absence of mass transfer effect on the reaction rate in our system was also checked by changing the catalyst mass (10−40 mg) for the reaction (Koros and Nowak, 1967), as shown in Fig. 2 . After the completion of the reaction, the reactor was quenched in a water bath to room temperature. The liquid solution was separated from the solid catalyst by centrifugation and analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890B) with an HP-5 column. Tridecane was used as the internal standard for the quantification of the liquid products."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of various Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) materials are shown in Fig. 3 . The XRD patterns of Nb2O5-SiO2 (x) support show broad peaks (not present here), indicating the amorphous structure and hinting the amorphous niobium oxide species were well dispersed in silica. After being impregnated with Ni, the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 44.5, 51.8°and 76.4°appeared, which were attributed to (110), (200) and (220) planes, respectively (PDF No. 04-0850), indicating the formation of fcc Ni phase. It is interesting that with the increase of NbOx content, the Ni size decreased from 27.9, 20.2–18.6 nm calculated by Scherrer equation. It seems that the NbOx promote Ni dispersing well. We therefore think the interaction between Ni and niobium oxide species is stronger than that between Ni and silica. No Nb2O5 or SiO2 peaks was detected, indicating the impregnation of Ni didn’t change the amorphous structure of Nb2O5-SiO2. The TEM images of the Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in the images, we can see that the increase of NbOx amount could favor the dispersion of Ni, which was also in agreement with that from XRD analysis. The BET surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore diameters are summarized in Table 1 . All of the Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) samples had mesoporous characteristics with pore size distributions in the range of 2−4 nm. The specific surface areas first increase and then decrease with increasing NbOx content. Compared to parent Nb2O5-SiO2 support, if more NbOx was added, the loss of BET surface area was decreased, while the pore volumes and pore size were increased. Fig. 4 shows the TEM of catalysts and mapping images of Ni and Nb species, respectively. It can be seen that Ni species were highly dispersed over the catalyst and were also located near the Nb, suggesting the presence of the interaction between Ni species and NbOx. It was a pity that the amount of Nb in Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(5) was too low to be detected in the mapping pattern. Temperature programed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR) was carried out using unreduced Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) samples. The corresponding reduction profiles for the samples are shown in Fig. 5 . The reduction profile for the Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(x) sample showed two main hydrogen consumption signals, which meant two oxide species existed on the catalyst (Jasik et al., 2005). The first peak from 350 to 500 °C could be assigned to the reduction of NiOx species. With increasing NbOx content, the reduction temperature of NiOx shifted to higher temperature, and overlap of these peaks increased, indicating more Ni species interacted with NbOx as increasing the Nb content. More NbOx could broaden the reduction profiles of nickel oxide (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006). It is also in agreement with the results from the analysis of XRD and TEM. The peak appeared at high temperature is ascribed the partial reduction of Nb2O5 to low valence NbOx, which has been known Nb2O5 is difficult to be reduced to metallic state (Wojcieszak et al., 2006)."
8,Catalytic reaction,"3.2 Catalytic reaction In order to compare the performance of three catalysts and identify the role of Ni and NbOx species, the reaction time curves were recorded and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The catalyst with 10 % niobia doped showed the fastest rate and palmitic acid was almost totally converted in 8 h (Fig. 6B), while 12 h was needed for both Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(5) (Fig. 6A) and Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(20) (Fig. 6C). In order to verify the function of Nb2O5, Ni/SiO2 and the mixture of Ni/SiO2 and Nb2O5 were employed as control catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6D and E, these two control catalysts exhibited poor performance and only gave a conversion of 65.5 % and 67.8 % even after 12 h, respectively. The introduction of isolated Nb2O5 could not improve the performance of Ni/SiO2, indicating that the synergy between Ni and NbOx plays an important role in the hydrogenation of palmitic acid. It is worth noting that, in this catalytic system, the main product was ester but not palmitic alcohol. As the ester was originated from palmitic acid and palmitic alcohol by dehydrolysis, we therefore also took both ester and alcohol as products of initial hydrogenation to analyze the kinetic behavior. In addition of ester and alcohol, there were also small amount of hexadecane and pentadecane in the product. The stability of Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) catalyst was also tested. As shown in Fig. 7 , after 3 recycles, the conversion had a slight decrease. In the first recycle, the products distribution had a little change, hexadecane decreased while esters increased. However, since the second recycle, the conversion and products distribution tended to be unchanged. The used catalyst was also characterized by XRD, TEM-mapping and N2 adsorption/desorption. The XRD pattern of used Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) showed that the Ni particle size did not change, which remained to be ca. 20 nm (Fig. S2). The TEM-mapping also showed that the Ni and NbOx dispersed very well after reaction (Fig. S1). However, the surface area and pore size became small (Table S2)."
9,Kinetic study,"3.3 Kinetic study 3.3.1 Kinetic data analysis The kinetic study of hydrogenation of palmitic acid was conducted at a temperature range of 230−290 °C with the presence of a constant pressure of H2. The palmitic acid conversions were limited to lower than 20 %. The fatty acid concentrations with the reaction rate at different temperatures were fitted with pseudo-first-order equation (El Seoud et al., 2016). r = k c P A n The initial rate of hydrogenation was calculated based on the formation rate of palmitic alcohol plus palmitic ester. The equation was shown below. r = c a l c o h o l + c e s t e r t ∙ m c a t c alcohol: concentration of formed palmitic alcohol, mol L−1 c ester: concentration of formed palmitic ester, mol L−1 t: reaction time, min m cat: mass of the catalyst, g The reaction rate constant k and reaction order for palmitic acid n in the equation were determined by linear least-squares fitting of the experimental data obtained by initial-rate method. According to the equation, n and k is obtained from the slope of plot ln{r}-ln{c} shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8, we can see the reaction order of palmitic acid was close to zero, at a range from 0.06 to 0.32, indicating that the effect of concentration of palmitic acid on reaction rate was insignificant, and the increase of reaction rate was non-linear as the concentration increases. The reaction rate constant k at 250 °C was 0.012, 0.022 and 0.018 on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(5), Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) and Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(20), respectively. Arrhenius parameters including apparent activation energy E a a p p and pre-exponential coefficients A were determined by plotting natural log of rate constants k vs. reciprocal of temperature T, as shown in Fig. 9 . All the parameters were summarized in Table 2 . As exhibited in Table 2, the E a a p p on Ni/SiO2 was 116.61 kJ mol−1. With increasing of NbOx doping, the E a a p p increased to 128.87 on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(5), which is not in line with expectation. However, the pre-exponential coefficients A on Ni/SiO2 also decreased severely, which could also lead the decrease of reaction rate. This explains why Ni/SiO2 exhibited the worst activity. To further increase NbOx doping, the E a a p p decreased to 96.22 and 63.99 kJ mol−1 on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) and Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(20), respectively, indicating that NbOx species could easily adsorb and activate palmitic acid. However, Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) showed the highest rate constant. It can be explained by compensation effect (Fig. 10 ) (Guo et al., 2018), i.e., lowered E a a p p also decreased A, leading Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(20) with the lowest E a a p p did not show the fastest reaction rate k. Thus from the kinetic data, it is suggested that proper increase of NbOx doping indeed accelerated the reaction. However, excessive amount of NbOx had negative effect on reaction rate. 3.3.2 Kinetic modeling The data obtained on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) catalyst at 250 °C were taken for kinetic modeling of hydrogenation of palmitic acid. According to Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, the hydrogenation of palmitic acid to alcohol could be divided into the following elementary steps, including the adsorption of palmitic acid (I) and H2 (II) on the active sites, surface reaction between the adsorbed reactants (III, IV) and desorption of product (V, VI). In this proposal, the decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation of palmitic alcohol were excluded because the initial rate method was taken for collecting the kinetic data. The proposed elementary steps are as following: (I) P A + * → k P A P A * (II) H 2 + 2 * → k H 2 2 H * (III) P A * + 2 H * → k 1 P a l * + H 2 O + * (IV) P a l * + 2 H * → k 2 P o l * + 2 * (V) P o l * → k P o l P o l + * (VI) H 2 O * → k H 2 O H 2 O + * PA: palmitic acid, Pal: hexadecanal, Pol: hexadecanol, *: active site K x: equilibrium constant for x adsorption; k x: rate constant for x elementary step; a, b: parameters in the regression model; R2: correlation coefficient obtained by linear regression Here hexadecanol was used as the representative product because it and its derivative ester were the dominant compounds in the products in the initial period (1 mol palmitic ester was also equal to 1 mol hexadecanol). Because experimental kinetic rates were obtained at very high reactant / product ratios, any adsorption of product on the catalyst surface would have no kinetic effects (the palmitic acid conversion was <20 %; Table 3 ). The elemental steps of product desorption (V, VI) would not be considered as a candidate for the rate-determining step. Besides, hexadecanal was never detected in our experiments, so the hydrogenation of palmitic acid to hexadecanal (IV) was a fast step which couldn’t determine the rate. It was not taken as the rate-determining step, either. Therefore only step I, II, and III could be assumed to be the rate-determining step, respectively. Based on this condition, the rate expressions of Langmuir-Hinshelwood model are given in Table 3. It is worth noting that only the rate determination step (RDS) can be considered as an irreversible step when deriving the rate expression. There may be two ways for the adsorption of the reactants palmitic acid and H2 on the catalyst. One is the two reactants adsorbed competitively on the same kind of active site, the other is they adsorbed on two different kinds of active sites independently. The two rate expressions for the surface reaction kinetics in Table 3 correspond to these two possibilities. Mathematical reformulation of the equations resulted in linearized forms with regard to the concentration of palmitic acid. Linear regression using the experiment reaction rates under different concentration over the Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) catalyst produced the fitness results (R2), which are given in the last column of Table 3. Comparing to the R2 in the four assumption, the last kinetic model showed the highest fitness to the experiment data (R2 = 0.9741). Therefore, in the hydrogenation of palmitic acid on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) catalyst, the surface reaction between palmitic acid molecules and H atoms which adsorbed on different kinds of active sites independently would be the rate-determining step. These kinetic assessments identify that the active sites responsible for H2 activation are different from those for palmitic acid adsorption on Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10). Combined with the characterizations (XRD, TEM and H2-TPR), kinetic data (rate constant, activation energy and pre-exponential factor), results of reaction (Fig. 6, B and D) and the previous reports(Kandel et al., 2015; Kong et al., 2018), it is deduced that the metallic Ni was responsible for the adsorption/activation of H2 while the NbOx species played the role of adsorption/activation of CO group in Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2(10) catalyst. Compared to the analysis on Ni/SiO2, we can conclude that NbOx played an important role in adsorbing the palmitic acid. Without NbOx, the RDS was palmitic acid adsorption (Table S1). The induction of NbOx changed the RDS. According to Tomishige’s comprehension (Takeda et al., 2015), we inferred that the reaction occurred on the interface between Ni and NbOx."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we prepared a kind of Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2 catalysts by a simple sol-gel method and use it in hydrogenation of palmitic acid. The increase of NbOx amount in the catalysts could favor the dispersion of Ni. A synergy between Ni and NbOx was operating in the hydrogenation of palmitic acid, in which Ni and NbOx sites functioned, respectively, for the activation of H2 and fatty acid. The synergy was affected by the NbOx content of the support. Kinetic study reveals a higher percentage of NbOx could lower the activation energy apparently and pre-exponential factor as well. The overall reaction rate was determined by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface reaction step between independently adsorbed palmitic acid and H atoms over the Ni/Nb2O5-SiO2 catalyst."
