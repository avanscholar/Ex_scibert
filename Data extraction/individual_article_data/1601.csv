0,Introduction,"The continuous use of fossil fuels as the major energy source has led the world to a potential energy and environmental crisis. This is due to the depletion of this energy source and consequent increase of exhaust gas emissions that accumulate in the atmosphere and bring about global warming [1–3]. The search for renewable and carbon-neutral energy sources has shown three main routes for the production of such sustainable fuels: (i) direct production by photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and microalgae; (ii) fermentative and non-fermentative production by heterotrophic microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts or fungi; and (iii) chemical conversion of biomass into fuels [4]. Several reviews have reported the use of photosynthetic organisms for fuel production and the chemical conversion of biomass into fuels [5–8]. However, problems concerning biomass production costs, scale-up and the competition for arable land arise from these processes, limiting their application in large-scale biofuels production [6,9,10]. Alternatively, the microbial production of biofuels through fermentative and non-fermentative pathways is a promising technique, since numerous microorganisms have demonstrated to be able to produce such a variety of compounds that can be used as fuels, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical products [1,2,4,11]. However, microorganisms presenting this innate capacity are often distinct from well-characterized microorganisms, such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae, known for their effectiveness in industrial and large-scale applications [1]. Additionally, optimization of the production processes in innate microorganisms is often limited by the lack of genetic and biology tools, as well as physiological knowledge, which are determinant in microbial engineering and manipulation. In order to make use of both innate capacity of some microorganisms for the production of valuable compounds and great effectiveness of microorganisms commonly used in industrial applications, one possible approach is to synthesize and import genes involved in the original pathways from innate microorganisms to these industrial-friendly organisms, which also have well-established genetic tools [1,2,12,13]. Currently, ethanol constitutes the major biofuel form [1,11,13,14], especially in the US, with 14.3 billion gallons produced in 2014 [15]. However, ethanol is highly hygroscopic and corrosive, limiting their application with the existing fuel storage and distribution infrastructures [1,11,13]. To overcome the problems associated to the use of bioethanol as main fuel form, the potential of other compounds, such as biodiesel, biobutanol, longer-chain alcohols, hydrogen and synthetic petroleum hydrocarbons, is being investigated [1]. The aim of this study was to present the state of the art of metabolic engineering of E. coli for higher alcohols production. More specifically, this review highlights the recent advances in 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol (2MB) and 3-methyl-1-butanol (3MB) production using the genetic tractable microorganism E. coli. Although different reviews have already focused this topic [11,16–22], this study provides updated information and discusses how metabolic engineering and systems and synthetic biology can be used to increase biofuels productivities and microbial tolerance to these compounds."
1,Current transportation fuels and biologically-related compounds,"Current transportation fuels that need biosynthetic alternatives with similar properties are gasoline, diesel and jet fuel [4,13]. Gasoline corresponds to the fuel applied in spark ignition engines and consists in a complex mixture of C4-C12 hydrocarbons, mainly branched-chain alkanes (40–60%) and aromatics (20–40%) [4,13,23]. To obtain substitute candidates to gasoline, biosynthetic fuels must have comparable properties to those of gasoline, namely the energy content (32MJL−1), octane number (87−91) and transportability. Possible alternatives to this fuel form, which can be used either as an additive or in replacement of gasoline, include short-chain alcohols and alkanes ( Table 1) [4,13]. Diesel fuel is a mixture of hydrocarbons with carbon lengths between 9 and 23 used in compression engines [3,4,13]. These hydrocarbons can be linear, branched and cyclic alkanes (75%) and aromatics (25%). Potential biofuels that could be used as a supplement or in replacement of diesel include fatty acid methyl esters or fatty acid ethyl esters, fatty alcohols, alkanes and linear or cyclic isoprenoids (Table 1). These biofuels must achieve a freezing temperature of approximately −9.5°C, a vapour pressure of about 0.5mmHg at 21°C and a cetane number ranging between 50 and 60 [13]. Both gasoline and diesel properties strongly depend on the hydrocarbons that constitute these fuels. For example, the presence of branched and unsaturated compounds results in increased octane numbers in gasoline [24] and lower cetane numbers in diesel [25]. On the other hand, alkanes are responsible for higher cetane numbers in diesel and lower octane numbers in gasoline [24,25]. In addition to the hydrocarbons, several additives can be used to increase the performance and stability of gasoline and diesel. Commonly used additives in gasoline include anti-knock agents, anti-oxidants, lead scavengers, lubricants and detergents. In diesel, the main additives used are alcohols and ethers, as they can reduce emissions, and benzene and lead, which tend to be toxic [23–25]. Jet fuel consists in a mixture of C8-C16 hydrocarbons, commonly used in gas turbines. In this mixture, 25% of the hydrocarbons corresponds to aromatics. Fatty acid- and isoprenoid-based biofuels can supplement or replace jet fuel (Table 1), provided that they can achieve similar values of heat of combustion, freezing temperature (−40°C) and energy content (53.4MJL−1) [13]."
2,The role of metabolic engineering and systems and synthetic biology in the optimization of metabolic pathways,"Several biofuels can be produced using microorganisms. However, to obtain cost-effective biofuel production systems, it becomes necessary to increase yields and productivities of target compounds. To solve this problem, tools for pathways and microorganisms’ engineering are strongly required. Recently, improvements in biofuels production are mainly due to (i) fine-tuning of some steps within the production pathway or (ii) regulation of the carbon flux to and from the pathway. Additionally, the complete understanding of microbial metabolisms and the effects of fuel toxicity on microbial cells can be used to avoid or minimize undesirable effects or pathway routes and maximize carbon flux towards the target product [2,12]. An approach to the whole cell metabolism can be predicted by defining cell behaviour models. These models correspond to the integration of several parameters that can be monitored using functional genomics techniques and can be used to identify potential bottlenecks in biofuel production [12,26]. As a result, increasing biofuel productivities requires several iterative rounds of metabolic engineering and systems biology [2,12,26]: (i) microbial engineering for biofuel production; (ii) application of functional genomics and metabolic flux analysis to the engineered microorganism to determine potential bottlenecks and toxicity effects resulting from pathway expression; and (iii) application of systems biology predictions to the microorganisms and evaluation of fuel productivities. However, metabolic engineering and systems biology cycle have some limitations concerning time and resource allocation necessary to complete the entire rounds. To overcome these limitations, synthetic biology appears as a good solution, as it requires less time and resource allocation. In synthetic biology, a cell corresponds to an assemblage of parts creating a specific phenotype. Accordingly, biofuel production pathways in synthetic biology are constructed through the following steps: (i) standardization of part connections in a cell; (ii) standardization of the methods for part analysis; (iii) analysis of the cell parts’ behaviour; and (iv) development of models that describe part behaviour. As the engineered parts are standardized, they can be introduced in any pathway, meaning that synthetic biology provides broad-spectrum tools for improving metabolic pathways instead of specific fine-tuning ones [27–31]. The use of synthetic biology tools has been successfully applied in the following applications [27,29,31]: (i) engineering of transcription factors to improve several phenotypes at the same time; and (ii) engineering of several enzymes to increase metabolic activities and alter substrate and product specificities. In the future, the use of systems biology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools will provide the necessary information for microbial engineering, contributing to the sustainable achievement of biofuel productivities capable of satisfying global demands."
3,The use of E. coli instead of oleaginous microorganisms,"High productivities of microbial fuels can be achieved using microorganisms that naturally accumulate fuel precursors. Such microorganisms, capable of accumulating lipids in concentrations higher than 20% (% w/wcell), can be considered oleaginous organisms and include yeasts, fungi and algae. Examples of these microorganisms include the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides, which can reach lipid concentrations of over 70gL−1 through a fermentative pathway [32] and some microalgae, such as Botryococcus braunii and Schizochytrium sp., which present lipid contents ranging from 25% to 75% and 50% to 77% (% w/wcell), respectively [6]. However, the lack of knowledge and genetic tools for these microorganisms, limits their application in improving biofuels productivities and modifying the composition of the produced fuels, so that they can be applied in fuel engines [4]. Alternatively, metabolic engineering can be used to convert well-known organisms, such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae, in oleaginous microorganisms. This conversion may be performed by expressing the pathways for fuel production known for oleaginous organisms in this user-friendly hosts. Several studies have already demonstrated the potential of E. coli in the production of valuable metabolites, such as farnesene (an isoprene-derived fuel precursor), 1,3-propanediol (a key component in polymer business), the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate, growth hormones and a wide variety of pharmaceuticals [1,4]. The availability of genetic tools and the large genomic, metabolic and physiological knowledge base for E. coli have made it possible to easily engineer this microorganism as an efficient biocatalyst [1,2,4,14]. Additionally, E. coli presents several advantages in biofuels production in larger scales [2,33,34]: (i) high growth rates; (ii) ability to grow in low-cost mineral media and in the absence of oxygen, which can significantly reduce production costs and facilitate the scale-up process; and (iii) ability to use different carbon sources, such as carbohydrates, polyoils and fatty acids. However, non-native pathways' expression may result in the accumulation of heterologous metabolites that can have toxic effects on microbial cells [20]. Therefore, to increase productivities of the target compounds, compatible pathways to the host microorganism are required. Although E. coli is not able to naturally produce a wide variety of compounds in large amounts, advances in the fields of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and systems biology have overcome these limitations, allowing the engineering of this microorganism to produce a wide variety of biofuels."
4,Metabolic pathways to fuel production,"According to the pathways from which they are produced, microbial biofuels can be divided into four classes ( Fig. 1): (i) fermentative short-chain alcohols; (ii) non-fermentative short-chain alcohols; (iii) isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbons; and (iv) fatty acid-derived hydrocarbons [4,22]. The following sections present a brief description of the pathways that lead to the production of these compounds."
5,The fermentative pathway,"5.1 The fermentative pathway Several Clostridium species are well-known for their ability to produce compounds, such as n-butanol and isopropanol, in a fermentative pathway commonly referred as acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation [2–4,11,13,35,36]. This pathway, represented in Fig. 2, starts by the action of the enzyme acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, also known as thiolase (THL), which converts two acetyl-CoA molecules into acetoacetyl-CoA. After this step, the pathway is divided to produce isopropanol and n-butanol separately. In isopropanol biosynthesis, the CoA group from acetoacetyl-CoA is transferred to acetate, forming acetoacetate. This step is catalysed by an acetoacetyl-CoA transferase (AACT). Acetoacetate, in turn, is decarboxylated by an acetoacetate decarboxylase (ADC), forming acetone. Finally, isopropanol is formed through the reduction of acetone by a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH), which is NADPH-dependent. In n-butanol biosynthesis, acetoacetyl-CoA is reduced to butanol through four NADH-dependent reduction steps and one dehydration step. Firstly, acetoacetyl-CoA is reduced to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBCDH). Then, a crotonase (CRT) catalyses the dehydration of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into crotonyl-CoA, which is then reduced to butyryl-CoA by the action of the enzyme butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCDH). This pathway finishes with two consecutive reduction steps catalysed by an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AADH), completing the conversion of butyryl-CoA into n-butanol [4,36,37]."
6,The keto acid (non-fermentative) pathway,"5.2 The keto acid (non-fermentative) pathway Amino acid biosynthesis pathways are very common in almost all organisms [11]. This non-fermentative pathway ( Fig. 3) produces amino acids through 2-keto acid precursors. Keto acids, in turn, can be used for the production of alcohols through the Ehrlich degradation pathway, which comprises a decarboxylation step catalysed by a keto acid decarboxylase (KDC) and a reduction step using a alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) [2,4,11,13,35,36]. The following compounds can be produced through the Ehrlich degradation pathway: (i) 1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol from 2-ketobutyrate and 2-keto-3-methylvalerate, both intermediates of isoleucine biosynthesis; (ii) isobutanol from 2-ketoisovalerate, an intermediate of valine biosynthesis; (iii) 3-methyl-1-butanol from 2-keto-4-methylvalerate, an intermediate of leucine biosynthesis; (iv) 2-phenylethanol from phenylpyruvate, an intermediate of phenylalanine biosynthesis; and (v) 1-butanol from 2-ketovalerate, an intermediate of norvaline biosynthesis [13,22,36]."
7,The isoprenoid pathway,"5.3 The isoprenoid pathway Isoprenoids can also be used as an alternative to current transportation fuels. Through the isoprenoid pathway ( Fig. 4), it is possible to synthesize branched-chain alcohols, alkanes, alkenes and cyclic hydrocarbons [3,11,13]. However, such a variety of compounds are a result of the same C5 precursors: isoprenyl pyrophosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These activated C5 isoprenoid units can be synthetized through the following pathways: (i) the mevalonate pathway with acetyl-CoA as precursor; and (ii) the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway, being pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate the precursors [3,4,11,36]. Both isoprenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate are then condensed by isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases (IPPS) to form geranyl pyrophosphate (C10), farnesyl pyrophosphate (C15) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (C20). Due to the enzymatic activity of terpene synthases (TS), these compounds can be converted into branched-chain or cyclic alkenes, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, respectively. Furthermore, isoprenyl phosphatases (IPP) and isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases (IPPS) can oxidize the above mentioned alkenes into alcohols, such as geraniol, farnesol and geranylgeraniol, respectively [4,13,19,22]."
8,The fatty acid biosynthesis pathway,"5.4 The fatty acid biosynthesis pathway The fatty acid biosynthesis pathway ( Fig. 5) can lead to the production of long chain alkanes and esters, which can be used in replacement of diesel and jet fuel. This pathway starts by the addition of a carboxyl group to an acetyl-CoA molecule using bicarbonate and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) as catalyst, resulting in the formation of malonyl-CoA. Acetyl transacylase (AT) and malonyl transacylase (MT) are then responsible for the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into acetyl-acyl carrier protein (acetyl-ACP) and malonyl-acyl carrier protein (malonyl-ACP), respectively. The beginning of the elongation step starts at this point, where the following reactions take place: (i) conversion of acetyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP into acetoacetyl-ACP, catalysed by a β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS); (ii) reduction of acetoacetyl-ACP to D-3-hydroxyl-butyryl-ACP, catalysed by a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR); (iii) dehydration of D-3-hydroxyl-butyryl-ACP to form crotonyl-ACP, catalysed by a β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (HD); and (iv) reduction of crotonyl-ACP to butyryl-ACP, catalysed by an enoyl-ACP reductase (ER) [13,36]. In each round of the elongation, a malonyl-ACP is added to the compound, resulting in a two-carbon increase after each round [36]. In eukaryotes, when the fatty acid reaches a certain carbon length (e.g., C16), a thioesterase (TE) hydrolyses the fatty acid-ACP generating a free fatty acid. On the other hand, prokaryotes do not release a free fatty acid, as the fatty acid-ACP is directly transferred to glycerol-3-phosphate [13,19,22]."
9,"Engineering E. coli for the production of 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol","The properties of n-butanol make this compound a viable substitute or supplement of gasoline as a transportation fuel. This C4 alcohol presents an energy content of 27MJL−1, which is very similar to the one reported for gasoline (32MJL−1) [11,13,36] and an octane number of 87 [13]. Its vapour pressure (4mm Hg at 20°C) is almost 11 times lower than that of ethanol, allowing mixing with gasoline at any ratio. Furthermore, due to its hydrophobicity, n-butanol can be stored and transported using the existing infrastructures with no or minimal modifications [11,13,36]. Another potential substitute for current transportation fuels is isobutanol, which presents high energy density (about 26.4MJL−1). Similarly, 2MB and 3MB can also be potential replacements for transportation fuels. These C4 and C5 alcohols present energy densities close to that of gasoline, low water solubility, low volatilities and high compatibility with the available storage and transportation infrastructures [13,34]. As discussed earlier, 1-butanol production has been identified in microorganisms from the genera Clostridia. However, any microorganism has been identified to naturally produce higher alcohols, such as isobutanol, 2MB and 3MB, except for little amounts, which are typically considered as microbial by-products. In fact, these alcohols, as well as n-butanol, can be produced through the precursors of several amino acids, known as keto acids, by direct decarboxylation, followed by a reduction. The next sections show current attempts in metabolic engineering of E. coli to produce C4 and C5 alcohols, such as 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2MB and 3MB, via the fermentative, exclusively for 1-butanol production, and non-fermentative pathways. Tables 2 and 3 present the strategies commonly applied to increase productivities of the above referred compounds through the fermentative and non-fermentative pathways, respectively."
10,Engineering the fermentative pathway,"6.1 Engineering the fermentative pathway Atsumi et al. [14] were the pioneers in re-constructing the Clostridium n-butanol biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. In this study, the authors introduced the C. acetobutylicum genes for n-butanol production from acetyl-CoA in two operons: (i) the first operon encoded acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thl) and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE2); and (ii) the second one encoded 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/electron transfer flavoprotein (bcd/etfAB). Expression of this synthetic pathway resulted in 1-butanol productivities of 13.9mgL−1 under anaerobic conditions. To increase 1-butanol production, the authors replaced C. acetobutylicum thl by the E. coli atoB. Overexpression of the native gene resulted in an increase in 1-butanol productivities of more than three-fold, which may be explained by the higher activity of the native enzyme. The authors also tested the activity of homologues and isoenzymes of bcd. For that, bcd and etfAB from Megasphaera elsdenii, as well as ccr from Streptomyces coelicor, which encodes a crotonyl-CoA reductase without the need of an etf, were overexpressed in E. coli. However, these replacements resulted in a decrease in 1-butanol productivities. In an attempt to further increase 1-butanol productivities, the host genes that would compete with the engineered pathway for the precursor acetyl-CoA or the cofactor NADH were deleted. Deletion of these genes, encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), ethanol dehydrogenase (adhE) and fumerate reductase (frdBC), resulted in a two-fold increase in 1-butanol production by significantly decreasing lactate, ethanol and succinate production. However, these deletions led to an increased production of acetate. To avoid such high productivities of this compound, the gene encoding phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) was also deleted. These deletions (∆ldhA, ∆adhE, ∆frdBC and ∆pta) resulted in a decrease in acetate production, but also decreased 1-butanol production. Deleting the gene encoding pyruvate formate lyase (∆ldhA, ∆adhE, ∆frdBC, ∆pta and ∆pfl) from the strain expressing the n-butanol production pathway strongly reduced 1-butanol production, indicating that pyruvate formate lyase, rather than the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), is the primary enzyme involved in acetyl-CoA production. To activate PDHc and improve NADH production per mole of acetyl-CoA produced, the fnr was deleted, whose gene product regulates expression of the genes encoding PDH. The resulting strain (∆ldhA, ∆adhE, ∆frdBC, ∆pta and ∆fnr) was able to produce 373mgL−1 of 1-butanol. However, 1-butanol productivities were significantly lower than those of ethanol (714mgL−1), formate (966mgL−1) and pyruvate (2.0gL−1). These results suggest that fnr deletion was not effective in PDHc activation. Finally, the authors tested different growth media to improve 1-butanol productivities. Using Terrific Broth media supplemented with glycerol, the strain carrying the deletions (∆ldhA, ∆adhE, ∆frdBC, ∆pta and ∆fnr) together with the expression of the n-butanol production pathway (atoB, hbd, crt, bcd/etfAB and adhE2) was able to produce 552mgL−1 of 1-butanol. Inui et al. [38] also engineered E. coli for 1-butanol production using the same C. acetobutylicum pathway. However, expression of this pathway was performed in a single vector with different promoters: (i) the first promoter expressed the crt-bcd/etfAB-hbd operon; (ii) the second promoter expressed thl; and (iii) the third promoter expressed the alcohol dehydrogenase adhE. The authors also tested the activity of C. acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes (adhE1 and adhE2). 1-Butanol productivities achieved with the expression of adhE1 and adhE2 were 320 and 540mgL−1, respectively. After 60h of incubation, 1-butanol productivities increased up to 1.2gL−1. Nielsen et al. [39] also tried to re-construct the Clostridium fermentative pathway in E. coli. Unlike their ancestors, the authors evaluated the effect of polycistronic expression of n-butanol pathway genes on 1-butanol production. To do that, two vectors were constructed: (i) in the first vector the crt-bcd/etfAB-hbd operon was expressed; and (ii) in the second vector thl and adhE1 were expressed as an operon. Polycistronic expression of the n-butanol production pathway resulted in the production of 34.5mgL−1 of 1-butanol. Afterwards, the authors re-constructed the n-butanol pathway using four vectors with individual genes expressed from T7 lac promoters: (i) peT, which expressed thl; (ii) pcHC, which expressed hbd and crt; (iii) pkBE, which expressed bcd; and (iv) paA1, which expressed adhE1. The expression of individual genes resulted in 1-butanol productivities of 200mgL−1. Using the four-vector system and replacing the C. acetobutylicum thl by the E. coli atoB, the authors further increased 1-butanol productivities to 220mgL−1. Additionally, the authors increased the intracellular pool of NADH by overexpressing the gene encoding formate dehydrogenase (fdh1), which produces one NADH molecule by catalysing the conversion of formate into CO2. Overexpression of this gene increased not only the NADH pool, but also 1-butanol production to 400mgL−1. Furthermore, overexpression of the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) drove the carbon flux through the glycolytic pathway, increasing 1-butanol productivities to 580mgL−1. Higher 1-butanol productivities were achieved in the study performed by Shen et al. [40]. Those authors re-constructed the C. acetobutylicum pathway in E. coli by establishing driving forces towards 1-butanol production. Since the C. acetobutylicum pathway can use both NADH and reduced ferredoxin (encoded by the bcd-etfAB complex) as reducing power sources, re-construction of this pathway so that NADH is used as the sole reducing power agent can direct the flux towards 1-butanol production, being NADH accumulation the driving force. Accordingly, the NADH driving force was established by replacing the bcd-etfAB complex, able to catalyse the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA, by a trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (encoded by ter), able to reduce crotonyl-CoA using NADH as reducing equivalent. Additionally, the authors deleted the genes encoding the major acetyl-CoA-consuming enzyme (phosphate acetyltransferase), encoded by pta, thus creating an acetyl-CoA driving force. The resulting strain, atoB, hbd, crt, ter, adhE2, ∆pta, was able to reach 1-butanol productivities of 30gL−1. Later, Chen et al. [41] optimized fermentation conditions of an engineered E. coli strain expressing thl-crt-bcd-etfAB-hbd-adhE1-adhE. The authors evaluated the influence of pH and different carbon sources (glucose, xylose, glycerol, citrate and glutathione) and concentrations on 1-butanol productivities. Using glucose at 20gL−1 with no pH control, the engineered strain was able to produce 4.5mgL−1 of 1-butanol. When replacing glucose by xylose, 1-butanol productivities increased by 73%. Moreover, pH control has resulted in an overall increase of 1-butanol production, reaching productivities of about 11.7mgL−1. In the study performed by Zhou et al. [42], an E. coli strain able to synthetize 1-butanol from glycerol was constructed. In a first attempt, the transfer of the plasmids expressing the genes thl-crt-bcd-etfAB-hbd-adhE2 to E. coli has resulted in the production of up to 18.5mgL−1 of 1-butanol from a glycerol-rich medium. By expressing the glycerol transport protein gene, GlpF, 1-butanol production increased to 22.7mgL−1. By deleting the competing pathways for ethanol, succinate and lactate production and introducing a NADH regeneration system, the authors were able to achieve a productivity of 154.0mgL−1 of 1-butanol. More recently, Wen and Shen [43] have constructed a self-regulated 1-butanol production system. For this, the authors have used the E. coli endogenous regulatory elements to drive 1-butanol production in response to its natural fermentation needs. The regions controlling the expression of the major fermentative genes lhhA, frdABCD, adhE and ackA were cloned and 1-butanol productivity reached 10gL−1 in 24h."
11,Engineering the keto acid pathway,"6.2 Engineering the keto acid pathway To determine which higher alcohols could be obtained from the amino acid biosynthetic pathway, Atsumi et al. [34] re-constructed the Ehrlich pathway in E. coli using (i) 2-ketoacid decarboxylases (KDCs) to convert 2-keto acids into aldehydes; and (ii) alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) to convert the aldehydes into alcohols. Accordingly, the authors studied five KDCs presenting broad substrate specificity (Lactococcus lactis kivd, E. coli aro10 and pdc6, S. cerevisiae thi3 and C. acetobutylicum pdc) and coexpressed them with the S. cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by adh2). With this study, the authors concluded that higher alcohol productivities were achieved when using L. lactis kivd, resulting in the conversion of six 2-keto acid intermediates into the following alcohols: 1-propanol (31mgL−1), 1-butanol (16mgL−1), isobutanol (389mgL−1), 2MB (68mgL−1), 3MB (132mgL−1) and 2-phenylethanol (40mgL−1). The main advantage of using this pathway for alcohol production is that it does not require an excessive introduction of heterologous enzymes, when compared to the fermentative pathway. However, due to the wide substrate specificity of the decarboxylase and dehydrogenase steps, this pathway leads to the production of alcohol mixtures instead of single alcohols. 6.2.1 1-Butanol To increase 1-butanol production, Atsumi et al. [34] tried to increase the production of its precursor, 2-ketovalerate. For that, the authors overexpressed the gene leuABCD, responsible for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate obtained from threonine into 2-ketovalerate. Moreover, the authors overexpressed the gene responsible for the production of 2-ketobutyrate from threonine, ilvA. With the overexpression of the genes leuABCD, ilvA, kivd, and adh2, 1-butanol productivities of 44.4mgL−1 were achieved. As 2-ketobutyrate is also an intermediate of 1-propanol production, this step resulted in the production of a 1-butanol/1-propanol mixture. To further increase 1-butanol productivities, the authors deleted the ilvD gene, which is responsible for: (i) eliminating 2-ketoisovalerate production, the native leuABCD substrate, thus freeing up leuABCD for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into 2-ketovalerate; and (ii) eliminating 2-keto-3-methylvalerate production, a kivd substrate, thus freeing up kivd for 1-butanol production. Deletion of this gene, as well as externally feeding of threonine, almost duplicated 1-butanol productivities. By implementing different feeding experiments, the authors concluded that threonine is a limiting substrate in 1-butanol/1-propanol production. Taking into account these conclusions, Shen and Liao [44] attempted to increase threonine productivities. For this, the authors expressed a feedback-resistant mutant of ThrA behind a non-native promoter in a thrA-fbr-BC operon. Expression of this operon has resulted in a three-fold increase of 1-butanol/1-propanol levels. Additionally, the authors deleted metA and tdh, thus eliminating pathways that could compete for threonine and increasing 1-butanol/1-propanol production to 1.2gL−1. To avoid the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into 2-keto-3-methylvalerate, the genes ilvB and ilvI were also deleted, resulting in increased 1-butanol productivities, but with negligible effects on 1-propanol production. Finally, to reduce the amount of acetyl-CoA used for ethanol production, adhE was also deleted. Expression of leuABCD, ilvA, thrA-fbr-BC, kivd and adh2 and deletion of ∆ilvB, ∆ilvI, ∆metA, ∆tdh and ∆adhE resulted in an increase in 1-butanol/1-propanol production to about 2gL−1 (at an approximate ratio of 1:1). Later, to improve 1-butanol/1-propanol productivities, Atsumi and Liao [45] inserted the Methanococcus jannaschii citramalate synthesis pathway in E. coli. In this pathway, citramalate synthase (encoded by cimA) catalyses the production of citramalate from pyruvate and acetyl-CoA and the resulting citramalate can be directly converted into 2-ketobutyrate by leuABCD. To introduce the citramalate pathway in E. coli, the authors overexpressed M. jannaschii cimA and the E. coli leuABCD genes in an E. coli strain unable to synthesize 2-ketobutyrate. As a result, the strain expressing the citramalate pathway presented higher isoleucine productivities and specific growth rates, being able to produce 524mgL−1 of 1-butanol. 6.2.2 Isobutanol Similarly to 1-butanol, Atsumi et al. [34] engineered the amino acid biosynthetic pathway for isobutanol production. In this sense, to increase the amount of 2-ketoisovalerate available, the authors overexpressed the kivd and adh2 genes, as well as the E. coli genes ilvHCD. Overexpression of the above mentioned genes resulted in the production of 1.7gL−1 of isobutanol. Additionally, the authors deleted the genes responsible for the branch of 2-ketoisovalerate from the isobutanol production pathway (ΔadhE, ΔldhA, ΔfrdAB, Δfnr and Δpta). These deletions increased isobutanol productivities to 2.2gL−1. Furthermore, E. coli IlvIH was replaced by the Bacillus subtilis alsS, leading to an isobutanol production of 3.7gL−1. The previously referred overexpressions and deletions, along with the deletion of pflB, which competes for pyruvate, resulted in an overall isobutanol production of 22gL−1. Later, Atsumi et al. [46] tried to improve isobutanol productivities by comparing the effect of different alcohol dehydrogenases in the last step of isobutanol production. For this, the authors expressed the native genes encoding for different alcohol dehydrogenases, adhE, adhP, eutG, yiaY, yqhD and yjgB, S. cerevisiae adh2 and L. lactis adhA. This study demonstrated that the gene yqhD plays an important role in isobutanol production, since its deletion has resulted in a significant decrease in isobutanol productivity. Additionally, comparing the effect of adh2 and adhA, overexpression of the genes yqhD and adh2 has resulted in lower isobutanol productivities (about 7gL−1) than overexpression of yqhD and adhA, where isobutanol productivities were higher than 8gL−1. Recently, Shi et al. [47] also engineered E. coli for isobutanol production. In this study, genetically stable E. coli strains were engineered by integrating essential genes in the chromosome, followed by gene modulation with multiple regulatory parts. This strategy was applied to avoid the cofactor imbalance commonly found in anaerobic isobutanol production. Although the most common reducing equivalent present in anaerobic conditions is NADH, isobutanol production in these conditions requires NADPH. Taking into account this imbalance, the authors modulated the expression of trans-hydrogenase and NAD kinase genes (pntAB and yfjB, respectively) in chromosome with multiple regulatory parts, achieving isobutanol productivities of 10.8gL−1. In the study performed by Guo et al. [48], aro10 and adh2 genes from S. cerevisiae and dgat gene from Acinetobacter baylyi were amplified to create the expression vector pDG101. Expression of this vector has resulted in an isobutanol production of 103.7mgL−1. 6.2.3 2-Methyl-1-butanol Cann and Liao [49] tried to improve 2MB production by increasing the production of its precursor, 2-keto-3-methylvaletate. To improve this precursor, the following routes should be enhanced: (i) condensation of 2-ketobutyrate and pyruvate to form 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate, a step catalysed by an acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS); and (ii) transamination of threonine to 2-ketobutyrate. To improve the first step, four AHAS isoenzymes were evaluated, being AHASII from Salmonella typhimurium (encoded by ilvGM) the most sensitive and effective in 2MB production. For the second step, the authors tested three threonine transaminase isoenzymes. With externally fed threonine, overexpression of Corynebacterium glutamicum ilvA resulted in the highest concentration of 2MB. In summary, overexpression of S. typhimurium ilvGM, C. glutamicum ilvA, E. coli thrABC, L. lactis kivd and S. cerevisiae adh2 resulted in 2MB productivities of 970mgL−1. Further deletion of metA and tdh also contributed to an increase in 2MB productivities (to 1.25gL−1), by eliminating side pathways competing for 2-ketobutyrate. 6.2.4 3-Methyl-1-butanol For 3MB production, 2-ketoisovalerate must be conducted through the leucine biosynthetic pathway to produce 2-keto-4-methylvalerate, which can then be reduced to 3MB. Accordingly, Connor and Liao [50] engineered the amino acid biosynthetic pathway in E. coli for 3MB production by overexpressing E. coli ilvIHCD and leuABCD, L. lactis kivd and S. cerevisiae adh2 (3MB productivities achieved with these modifications were 56mgL−1). To further increase 3MB productivities, B. subtilis alsS, which encoded for acetolactate synthase, was tested in the place of ilvIH. Overexpression of alsS resulted in a minimal increase of 3MB production to 67mgL−1. Later, the authors introduced the 3MB producing genes (alsS, ilvCD, leuABCD, kivd and adh2) into the strain previously optimized for isobutanol production (ΔadhE, ΔfrdBC, ΔldhA, Δpta, Δfnr and ΔpflB), increasing 3MB productivities to 76mgL−1. Additionally, the authors targeted the inhibition of isobutanol by-product formation (that was about 2gL−1). To determine if 3MB production was mostly influenced by competition of kivd for 2-ketoisovalerate or weak leuABCD activity, the intracellular concentration of leuABCD was increased using a synthetic ribosomal binding site (RBS). However, this increase has not significantly increased 2-keto-4-methylvalerate production, suggesting that leuABCD activity was the major bottleneck in the pathway. Accordingly, to increase leuABCD activity, the authors used the feedback inhibition mutant leuAfbr with leuBCD, which led to a 2-keto-4-methylvalerate production of 1.61gL−1. Similar results were obtained when leuABCD was expressed in a ΔilvE and ΔtyrB strain. In sum, overexpression of alsS, ilvCD, leuABCD, kivd and adh2 using a synthetic RBS in a ΔilvE, ΔtyrB, ΔadhE, ΔfrdBC, ΔldhA, Δpta, Δfnr and ΔpflB strain resulted in the production of 806mgL−1 of 3MB. 3MB productivities were further increased to 1.28gL−1 by increasing fermentation time and glucose concentration to 10gL−1. In the study performed by Connor et al. [51] improved 3MB productivities were obtained through random mutagenesis and selection with 4-aza-D,L-leucine, a structural analogue of L-leucine. This step resulted in the development of a new E. coli strain able to produce 4.4gL−1 of 3MB. More recently, Chen et al. [52] have overexpressed L. lactis subsp. Lactis kivd and Zymomonas mobilis AdhB in E. coli, reaching 3MB productivities of 104mgL−1 in LB medium. When using a glucose-containing medium (5gL−1), 3MB productivities increased to 161mgL−1. Under these conditions, isobutanol productivities also increased up to 156mgL−1."
12,Improving microbial tolerance to these alcohols,"6.3 Improving microbial tolerance to these alcohols Although producing biofuels in E. coli engineered strains can be a viable alternative towards the achievement of current transportation fuel demands, microbial tolerance to these compounds constitutes a major challenge. Fuels toxicity to microorganisms is well documented in the literature [53–55]. These compounds are often responsible for a reduction in cells’ viability through their membrane damage, influencing essential physiological processes, such as energy maintenance in microbial cells. The antimicrobial activity of organic solvents strongly depends on their hydrophobicity. Accordingly, microbial tolerance to these compounds is variable, as it is possible to see in Table 4 for the specific case of E. coli. However, tolerance properties can also vary between different species and strains [56]. To increase microbial tolerance to organic compounds, several studies have suggested the transfer of tolerance mechanisms, commonly found in microorganisms able to survive in hydrocarbon-rich conditions, to genetic tractable strains [57,58]. Typical mechanisms involved in microbial tolerance to organic solvents include: (i) efflux pumps, membrane transporters that recognize and export toxic compounds from the cell using the proton motive force [59]; (ii) heat shock proteins, molecular chaperones that, under stress conditions, prevent protein aggregation and assist with refolding [60]; and (iii) membrane modifications that block organic compounds entry to microbial cells [53,55]. For an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms involved in microbial stress and tolerance to different organic compounds, several comprehensive reviews have covered this topic [53–56,61]. Regarding the compounds focused in this study, 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2MB and 3MB, several studies have attempted to increase 1-butanol and isobutanol tolerance in E. coli [53–56,61]. In the study performed by Rutherford et al. [62], 1-butanol stress response in E. coli was evaluated at the transcript, protein and metabolite levels, evidencing that exposure to this compound results in (i) perturbation of respiratory functions (nuo and cyo operons); (ii) oxidative stress (sodA, sodC, and yqhD); (iii) heat shock and cell envelope stress (rpoE, clpB, htpG, cpxR, and cpxP); and (iv) metabolite transport and biosynthesis (malE and opp operon). Additionally, this study allowed the identification of key genes involved in the attenuation of oxidative stress and protein misfolding, which may lead to an increase in 1-butanol productivities. On the other hand, Lee et al. [63] increased E. coli tolerance to 1-butanol from 1% to 1.5% (v/v) using artificial transcription factor libraries consisting of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins and an E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein. Similarly to Rutherford et al. [62], Atsumi et al. [64] tried to understand the response mechanisms involved in isobutanol stress using whole-genome sequencing followed by genome repair and knock-out. With this study, the authors identified five mutations (acrA, gatY, tnaA, yhbJ, and marCRAB) responsible for increased isobutanol tolerance and re-constructed the tolerance phenotype by combining deletions of these genes. The engineered strains also showed increased tolerance to 1-butanol and 2MB. Later, Minty et al. [65] applied experimental evolution followed by genome re-sequencing and gene expression to elucidate about the genetic bases of adaptation to exogenous isobutanol stress. With this study, the authors proposed rpoS and post-transcriptional regulators, such as hfq, RNA helicases, and sRNAs as interesting mutagenesis targets for modulating isobutanol tolerance."
13,Research needs,"The development of synthetic biology tools, more reliable and that require less time to make genetic constructions, may increase the availability of metabolic engineering techniques for the production of a large variety of fuels and chemicals. Additionally, the continuous application of systems biology tools, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and fluxomics could be very helpful in the design and integration of new metabolic pathways for biofuel production. In brief, using and developing strategies and tools from these fields can be very advantageous in increasing productivities of potential biofuels from different feedstocks, making them possible alternatives for current transportation fuels [1,2,66]. In the particular case of 1-butanol, isobutanol, 2MB and 3MB production, it is well-known that these compounds cause citotoxicity at a specific level, which means that in further production optimizations, toxicity of these compounds should be a concern. Giving that, strains must be engineered to have increased tolerance to these compounds, which is not very well documented for 2MB and 3MB [13]."
14,Conclusions,"From the examples described in this review, it is possible to conclude that many studies have focused on engineering E. coli for the production of a broad-spectrum of compounds that could be used as substitutes for currently used fuels. Although some studies have reported increased productivities for the compounds in study, other factors should be taken into account before they can be applied in large-scale production units. First of all, the physical properties of the biofuel candidate must be similar to those derived from petroleum. Furthermore, improvements in the kind of feedstock or carbon source used and in the biofuel biosynthetic pathways can have a high impact in the development of energy- and cost-effective processes able to produce fuels that could compete with petroleum based ones. For such improvements, metabolic engineering and systems and synthetic biology may play an important role, as they provide the necessary tools for an effective manipulation and engineering of E. coli to produce such a wide variety of potential biofuel compounds."
