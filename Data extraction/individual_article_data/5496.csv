0,Introduction,"In the last decades, a lot of efforts have been made for reducing the fossil fuel dependence. The alternative energy sources include wind, geothermal, hydropower and solar energy, each of them presents practical advantages and limitations. In particular, solar energy is capable of producing electricity and heat to satisfy the global demand of energy but its exploitation presents important difficulties. Thus, sunlight is intermittent and depends on geographical position and season. A solution to this limitation could be the use of hydrogen as energy vector if it is obtained from solar energy. Hydrogen shows some advantages fuel due to its high storage capability and abundance from various sustainable sources (biomass or water). Power can be obtained from hydrogen by using fuel cells, which are devices that converts chemical energy into electricity through the chemical reaction of protons with oxygens or another oxidizing agent. In this way, hydrogen can be considered a good alternative to fossil fuels. However, it is hard to produce hydrogen efficiently for being used as fuel. Photocatalytic water splitting (H2O → H2 + ½ O2) is one of the ideal methods, since hydrogen can be produced from water by using solar energy, in the range UV-visible [1–4]. It is well known that semiconductors with band gap about or lower to 3 eV, like TiO2, WO3, CdSe and SiC, satisfy the requirements for production of hydrogen by using photocatalysis [2,5–9]. An additional requirement should be the chemical stability of the photocatalyst in the water solution. In this way, TiO2 has been extensively investigated for being used in UV light photocatalysis because it has enough positive valence band edge to oxidize water to oxygen (the electron-hole created by sunlight can split and the obtained charge carriers might shift to the surface where they radicalize water and oxygen). Moreover, TiO2 is very stable in aqueous electrolyte solutions [10–13]. Furthermore, the addition of a co-catalyst on the catalyst surface (Pt, Ag, Au, etc.) or the addition of different types of alcohols as sacrificial reagent in the catalyst suspension (methanol, ethanol, etc.), favors the photocatalytic activity and increases the H2 production, due to their action as electron or hole scavenger, respectively [2,14]. There is not strong chemical bonding between co-catalyst particles and TiO2 nanocrystals. In particular, Pt particles are adhered to TiO2 by metal-support interaction (MSI) due to the overlapping of the occupied orbitals from Pt and unoccupied d orbitals of TiO2 [15,16]. On the other hand, when alcohols are used to improve hydrogen photoproduction, a process, usually called photoreforming, is carried out, making use of semiconductors to promote redox reactions, namely, the oxidation of organic molecules and the reduction of H+ to H2 (CH3OH + H2O → 3H2 + CO2, methanol photoreforming). According to this, H2 is obtained while sacrificial agents are mineralized. The way to achieve industrial applications of these photocatalytic processes is still long due to its present low efficiency [17]. Among the factors to be considered are to develop novel visible-light-active materials and charge separation improvements [18–20]. Only few works have been devoted to pilot plants. In general, Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) illumination is extensively used, being the hydrogen obtained from wastewater, by using real town wastewater as the source of sacrificial organic molecules (glycerol, sulphides …) [21–25]. Although many semiconductor photocatalysts have been synthetized and their ability to produce H2 tested, the comparison of the efficiencies achieved is frequently not possible. Commonly, the reported data include the rate of H2 production, which depend not only of the photocatalyst but also of the experimental photocatalysis setup. In this sense, there are not homologated setups to test the photocatalysts. Moreover, enough details of the photocatalysis setup design are normally non-reported. In particular, the intensity and spectrum of the light received by the photocatalysts during the measurements commonly are not indicated. On the other hand, frequently the maximum rate of H2 production is reported, but without information about the exhaustion of the photocatalytic solution after prolonged exposition to the light in the reactor. We should point out that the reaction temperature is a relevant parameter but there are few studies about the influence of this temperature on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Moreover, this temperature is frequently non-reported, although it should be increased by the incident light in the photocatalysis setup. In this work, the TiO2 photocatalytic activity has been improved by adding platinum as co-catalyst [7,26,27] by photodeposition techniques [7,28]. The results obtained by different photocatalyst synthesis method have been compared. The prepared materials have been analyzed by means of XRD and SEM techniques to obtain structural and morphological information. Besides, the influence of different alcohols as sacrificial reagents on photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied for each photocatalyst. Photocatalytic measurements have been carried out by using a novel homemade reaction system, with a new design and equipped with an elliptical cylindrical collector. The H2 production was continuously monitored for long periods of time, by means of a mass spectrometer, in order to test the exhaustion of the photocatalytic dissolution. Moreover, the dependence of the H2 production on the reaction temperature has been analyzed in a wide temperature range and the apparent activation energy has been determined. We also present results of H2 production obtained by using a commercial photocatalyst, TiO2 P25 from Evonik Industries, in our experimental setup, in order to provide a reliable reference, which can be used by others authors for comparison of different photocatalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Photocatalyst materials were synthetized by impregnation of TiO2 nanoparticles in H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (previously prepared by dissolving pure platinum wires in 50% HNO3-50% HCl vol/vol, also called aqua regia) and subsequent photodeposition. Two methods were used. The first one, also called “two-steps”, is similar to the experimental procedure explained by Yu et al. [28]. In this case, Aeroxide TiO2 P25 (Evonik Industries) catalyst was mixed with suitable stoichiometric concentration of H2PtCl6 solution and then photoreduced, by UV illumination with a 350 W Xe arc lamp during 30 min. The obtained product was centrifuged, washed with water and ketone several times and left in an oven at 80 °C during 72 h for drying it. The nominal weight ratio of Pt to Ti was 6 wt%. Finally, 0.2 g of powder was suspended in a 200 ml solution of H2O with 25 vol% of alcohol (methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) or isopropyl alcohol (IPA)), with pH adjusted to 5. In the second method, also called “one-step”, 80 ml of Pt-TiO2 suspension obtained like in the first procedure was directly added to 120 ml of solution with H2O and alcohol, with no previous photoreduction process. The obtained photocatalysts were labeled 6Pt-TiO2-2S and 6Pt-TiO2-1S, where 2S and 1S stand for two-steps and one-step, respectively. In addition, 2 wt% Pt in TiO2 P25 from Evonik Industries, labeled 2Pt-TiO2, was prepared by photodeposition, following the procedure proposed by E. Pulido Melian et al. [7] and others [29]."
3,Characterization techniques,"2.2 Characterization techniques PANalytical X'Pert diffractometer, equipped with a primary monochromator and X'Celerator detector, was used for recording the X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the synthesized Pt-TiO2 samples. The obtained patterns were collected in 20–70° 2θ range with 0.016° by step during 2 h. Phase identification was performed with X'Pert HighScore Plus v.2.0a software using the JCPDS and ICSD [30,31]. The morphology of the Pt-TiO2 specimens was studied by using scanning electron microscopy technique (SEM) (Jeol LTD, mod. JSM-6300, Tokio, Japan) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). All samples were covered with a thin layer of sputtered silver for avoiding electrostatic charging problems."
4,Photocatalytic setup,"2.3 Photocatalytic setup We have used a novel confocal homemade setup for hydrogen production, see Fig. 1 , with a double wall borosilicate reactor and an UV Mercury lamp (Philips, HPA Synergy 300 W). The reactor and the lamp are located at the focuses of a stainless steel elliptic cylinder reflector. By this means, the whole of the light coming from the lamp, located at one focus, is concentrated over the reactor, sited at the other focus. For dynamical measurements of hydrogen production, a mass spectrometer Omnistar of Pfeiffer Vacuum Co. (Aβlar, Germany) was used connected to the reactor. A continuous nitrogen flux of 3.5 ml/min through the reactor was fixed by a mass flow controller (Bronkhorst, EL-FlOW Select). In order to analyze the photocatalytic hydrogen production, 200 ml of water or 150 mL of water with 50 mL of alcohol (25% vol.), as sacrificial reagent, and 0.2 g of Pt-TiO2 were introduced into the reactor. The irradiance received in the photocatalytic suspension was measured by using a calibrated spectrometer (Black-Comet, StellarNet). An optical fiber with a cosine receptor head was introduced into the reactor with a suspension of Pt-TiO2 in water/MeOH. By this way it was possible to measure the irradiance into the suspension in operative conditions, at different distances from the surface. The results obtained at distances of 5 and 20 mm from the surface are shown in Fig. 2 . The TiO2 band gap at 3.2 eV and the cut off of the spectra by absorption of the borosilicate wall of the reactor (at 350 nm) are indicated. It is found that there is a fast attenuation of the UV radiation in the medium, therefore the photocatalytic reaction takes places close to the surface. The reactor temperature was controlled in the range of 5–60 °C by a continuous water flux through the double wall reactor jacket. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, the reactor temperature was adjusted to 25 ± 0.1 °C; except when the influence of the reaction temperature was studied, where it was regulated in the range 5–60 °C, also with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the photocatalyst Diffraction patterns of P25, 2Pt-TiO2 and 6Pt-TiO2–2S are shown in Fig. 3 . Characteristics Braggs peaks corresponding to anatase (JCPDS file 21-1272) and rutile (JCPDS file 21-1276) phases are observed without further crystalline phases associated to the platinum [30,31]. From these XRD spectra the nanocrystal means sizes of the different samples could be calculated by means of Scherrer equation (1) from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the position of the peaks [32]. (1) d = k · λ β · cos θ where d is the crystal size, λ the X-ray wavelength, θ the diffraction angle, β the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and k is a constant depending on the particle shape (currently k = 0.9). The obtained mean nanocrystal sizes, shown in Table 1 , are similar to those obtained from the datasheet of commercial Aeroxide TiO2 P25 (Evonik Industries) catalyst. From this datasheet, 79% of TiO2 P25 corresponds to the anatase phase. SEM images of 6Pt-TiO2-2S and 2Pt-TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4 . These images illustrates that both samples present a similar morphology. The corresponding platinum distribution maps obtained by means of EDS are also included in Fig. 4. The results show that the distribution of the platinum atoms is not uniform, i.e. it does not totally cover the surface of the TiO2 particles, like occurs for larger percentages of heavy metals [33]. On the other hand, there seems to be a good distribution of platinum particles, which favors the photocatalytic performances of these materials."
7,Influence of the photocatalyst preparation and sacrificial agent on H2 production,"3.2 Influence of the photocatalyst preparation and sacrificial agent on H2 production The hydrogen production efficiency has been studied for each photocatalyst and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . Different solvents, MeOH, EtOH and IPA, were used like sacrificial agents, which facilitate the water reduction by photoelectrons from the conduction band [34,35]. Results for suspension with only water, without sacrificial agents, are also shown for the 2Pt-TiO2 photocatalyst to confirm the benefit obtained by the addition of these alcohols. The 2Pt-TiO2 photocatalyst shows the best results for the three alcohols, i.e., for MeOH, EtOH and IPA, during 10 h. On the other hand, photocatalyst 6Pt-TiO2-1S shows higher H2 production than 6Pt-TiO2-2S. It would be noticed that the best results are obtained with MeOH as sacrificial reagents. Moreover, for 2Pt-TiO2 we have also checked the H2 production without any sacrificial agent, i.e. only with water, the obtained results are shown in Fig. 6 . In this case the production rate is about 15 times lower than in alcohol-water suspensions. These results indicate the importance of the sacrificial agents, which reduce the electron-hole recombination, improving the H2 production. Finally, we include in Fig. 5 results obtained with commercial P25 TiO2, without Pt, in water/MeOH in order to provide a reference, which could be used by other authors for comparison. The H2 production rates achieved with the different combinations of photocatalyst and sacrificial agent, shown in Fig. 6, are collected in Table 2 . It would be noticed that the H2 production rate of the commercial P25 TiO2 in water/MeOH increases by a factor close to 30 by the addition of Pt, when compared with 2Pt-TiO2. Moreover, it would be remarked that the H2 production rates shown in Table 2 for TiO2 with Pt in water/alcohol are between the highest values reported in the literature for the noble metal/TiO2 system [7,36]. To achieve more information about the H2 production for long reaction time, measurements for the different photocatalysts in MeOH have been performed; following the evolution of the hydrogen production during 72 h, see Fig. 6. As it can be seen, the H2 production of the most efficient photocatalyst, 2Pt-TiO2, decays slowly, from 16.5 to 8.5 mmol g−1h−1. A slower decay is observed for 6Pt-TiO2-1S, whereas 6Pt-TiO2-2S present a more stable H2 production during this long period of time, without signs of exhaustion. So, it can be seen that after 72 h the hydrogen production is still high, with values of 5.3 and 4.0 mmol g−1h−1 for the experiments with 6Pt-TiO2-1S and 6Pt-TiO2-2S, respectively. For the best of our knowledge, results of photocatalytic H2 production for so long times have not been previously reported."
8,Influence of the reaction temperature on H2 production,"3.3 Influence of the reaction temperature on H2 production The reactor temperature is an important factor to be considered in this kind of studies about hydrogen production. But usually the temperature is no reported neither controlled. The temperature inside the reactor is expected to increase due to the incident radiation from the lamp. For this reason we have designed and built a setup where water from a thermostatic bath flows through the double wall of the reactor, controlling the temperature of the suspension with high accuracy. We have investigated the influence of the temperature on hydrogen production in the range of 5–60 °C, using 2Pt-TiO2 as photocatalyst. The rate of H2 production versus reaction temperature after 2 h of reaction is shown in Fig. 7 , with and without MeOH as sacrificial reagent. As can be observed, when the reaction temperature increases, the hydrogen production also increases. The maximum hydrogen production rate by water dissociation, without MeOH, achieves a value of 2.3 mmol g−1h−1 at 60 °C. Meanwhile, the hydrogen production by methanol photoreforming rises up to 38.0 mmol g−1h−1 at 60 °C. This last value is higher than the corresponding one at 5 °C by a factor 5.5. Even comparing results for 60 °C and room temperature there is a remarkable increase by a factor 2.6. This significant dependence of the H2 production rate on reaction temperature takes to the need of controlling this parameter in the studies of H2 production. At 60 °C we find again, as at room temperature, that the H2 production is strongly favored by the presence of MeOH. This is due to MeOH acts as a sacrificial agent that facilitates water reduction by the photoelectrons from the conduction band [34,35]. The apparent activation energy Ea (kJ·mol−1) of the photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen production was calculated by means of the Arrhenius equation: (2) ln ( H 2 ) = ln ( A ) − E a R ( 1 T ) The Ea value was determined from the slope of the natural logarithm of the rate of hydrogen production as a function of the reciprocal of the temperature. R is the gas constant, 8.314 J mol−1K−1. Arrhenius fits of the photocatalytic hydrogen production for 2Pt-TiO2/water and 2Pt-TiO2/water/MeOH systems are also shown in Fig. 7. The apparent activation energy for 2Pt-TiO2/water system was found to be 17.5 kJ mol−1 versus 23.3 kJ mol−1 for 2Pt-TiO2/water/MeOH system. Although there are no major differences in the values obtained, the hydrogen production yields are quite different, indicating that hydrogen is produced from different reactions (water splitting and reforming of methanol, respectively). In general, the apparent activation energy of photocatalytic process is very low, about some kJ·mol−1 in the temperature range 20–80 °C [37]."
9,Conclusions,"Several Pt-TiO2 nano-particles based photocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by impregnation and photoreduction method to be used as photocatalysts for H2 production by water-splitting and alcohol photoreforming. The different synthesis procedures provide materials with promising H2 production rates, achieving over 16.0 mmol g−1h−1 for 2Pt-TiO2 in water/MeOH solution at 25 °C, with slow decreases for long reaction times which have been analyzed until 72 h. As a reference for comparison, the maximum H2 production rate obtained for 2Pt-TiO2 in water/MeOH increased by a factor close to 30 respect to the commercial P25 TiO2, in the same experimental conditions. The addition of a sacrificial reagent increased significantly the hydrogen production, obtaining the best results with MeOH. The hydrogen production rate is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature, increasing continuously in the temperature range studied from 5 to 60 °C. This hydrogen production rate at 60 °C was higher than at room temperature by a factor 2.6, achieving a large rate of 38.0 mmol g−1h−1 for 2Pt-TiO2/water/MeOH systems. Experimental data of H2 production versus reaction temperature can be fitted by Arrhenius equation. The apparent activation energy obtained for 2Pt-TiO2/water/MeOH systems was 23.3 kJ mol−1, slightly higher that the value obtained for the same system but without MeOH."
