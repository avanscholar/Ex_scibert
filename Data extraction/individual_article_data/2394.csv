0,"An overview of energy system – past, present and future","Energy is very crucial for the growth and survival of all living beings and it plays a vital role in the socio-economic development as well as human welfare of a country. Energy is regarded as a ‘strategic commodity’ [1]. Insecurity of its supply poses great threat for the functioning of the economy, particularly in developing economies. Achievement of energy security in a strategic way holds importance for Indian economy as well as for the growth of the human development especially with respect to get rid of poverty, unemployment and meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [2]. A great deal of planning is required for achieving the alternate source of energy which ensures long-lasting energy supply to address the issues related to energy demand, energy poverty and the environmental effects of energy growth. In present era, the energy requirements are satisfied by petroleum-based fuels and electricity powered by the fossil fuels. These resources have dwindling stocks of energy and therefore, they are not considered as sustainable. These energy sources pose huge negative impact on the environment in several ways that are unacceptable for mankind. The main by-product in the use of fossil fuel is carbon dioxide, which contributes up to 82% of the estimated green house gases [3]. An urge to find alternative energy source to supersede non-carbon genic resources is highly unavoidable. Such efforts are expected in order to stabilize the negative environmental issues in the future. Presently, fossil fuels viz. oil, coal and natural gas are contributing about 95% of the total energy demands in world. By 2020, the consumption of fossil fuels is estimated to be 3.3 terawatts (TW) i.e. with respect to year 2000, there will be an increase by 32% with same proportions of oil, natural gas and coal [4]. For the next 10 years, global energy consumption is projected to further rise as shown in Fig. 1 as projected in earlier report [5,6]. Fossil fuels are not evenly distributed resources on the globe; they are generally controlled by only certain nations in the world. The major resources are existing in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) those include Iran, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq. This questions the security of supply and distribution of these resources evenly to the developing countries. In addition, due to limited availability of these resources, a global competition for these resources and increase of prices in the future is not ruled out and may roll-up to unaffordable numbers. A 2013 report published by the International Monetary Fund concluded that global fossil fuel subsidies amount to $1.9 trillion annually. $1.4 trillion of this is due to externalities, $800 billion due to climate change. This estimate is based on a conservative social cost of carbon of $25 per tonne of CO2 emitted. An arguably more realistic estimate of $100 per tonne of COwould bring global fossil fuel subsidies to over $4 trillion per year, with $3.2 trillion due to climate change. This increases the levalized costs to approximately 18–28 cents per kWh, which is more than hydroelectric, onshore wind, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, natural gas, and on par with solar photovoltaic and solar thermal (whose costs are falling rapidly), and offshore wind. Therefore, now it is highly desirable to explore the renewable resources of energy that could look after future needs. This necessitates one to re-look at the advances and prospects available in renewable hydrogen energy sources. This article concisely describes various possibilities wrt. present and future scenario for production of hydrogen energy. Presently, the rapid development in solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy utilisation has set plenty of options in exploiting renewable energy sources. Numerous options among the current renewable sources are available for large scale energy generation, some of which are – Hydropower, Solar energy, Geothermal, Biogas, etc [5,6]. This can be clearly understood from the presentation in Fig. 2 ."
1,Renewable sources of energy,"(1) Hydropower methodology is one where electrical energy is generated via., abundant renewable source of water [7]. A common method employed for generation of hydropower is by building dams near flowing water bodies. The idea is based on utilizing the kinetic energy of flowing water that drives the mechanical dynamos thus generating electricity. The dams however are relatively expensive and are usually considered for a long-term investment. They also are known to bring geological change in the surroundings and a probable imbalance in the ecology. Since ages, this has been one of the major methodology world relied for electricity generation. (2) Wind energy represents the nearest term cost competitive renewable energy source [8]. The winds are mainly produced by the convective effect that is induced by solar heating of earth’s surface. Such wind energy thus produced is known to be proportional to the cube of its velocity. This type of energy presents a dual-use technology: i.e. while utilization of wind; the land can still be used for farming, ranching and forestry, and the collection of solar energy. European countries as United Kingdom and Denmark are known to have significant offshore wind power generation capacity. (3) Solar energy, is obtained from the natural resource as sun, Sun can be used to generate electricity via. photovoltaics and concentrators [9] and thus categorized as a best and never dying renewable energy generating option. It has its advantages over hydropower and wind energy due to its cheaper maintenance cost. However, the downside is that solar energy largely depends on the geological location and season for the maximum exposure to the sun. (4) Geothermal energy is heat extracted from rocks beneath water beds or underground [10]. It is considered as very reliable source, since it is not intermittent and is long lasting. However, the heat is not restored as rapidly by the environment as it is extracted which puts a limitation on the life of geothermal plants. United States of America and Philippines are known to have significant geothermal energy generating capacity. These are various known ways to utilize the existing renewable energy sources as described above. However they lack with expected realization in human life either for geographical reasons or technological reasons. In an urge to identify new ways or to modify existing ways to extract maximum energy out of energy resources hydrogen has been looked upon as a potential energy carrier."
2,Hydrogen as future fuel,"Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element on earth. It is a zero emission or emission free fuel that can be easily produced by the domestic sources. The interest in hydrogen as an alternate fuel (under the Energy policy Act 1992) has drastically increased recently. The preference to hydrogen as a potentially green fuel is due to its clean burning qualities, potential for domestic production and fuel cell vehicle and it is 2–3 times higher efficiency prospects than gasoline [11,12]. Hydrogen has high energy–density hence it was demonstrated to be highly useful in 1970s for propelling the spacecrafts and rockets by NASA. It has low volumetric energy density, as energy derived from 1 kg of hydrogen is equivalent to energy produced from 1 gallon of gasoline [13]. However, the main challenge in utilizing hydrogen as a fuel is its production in pure form. Hydrogen is present in enormous quantities in water (H2O), hydrocarbons (methane) and other organic matter. There are different technologies used for production of pure hydrogen as shown in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen from the figure that hydrogen can be utilized with respect to near term and long term goals not only from hydro/wind/ solar/geothermal sources but also from biomass/concentrated solar power/microorganism/semiconductors. Today industrially, 96% of hydrogen is produced by steam reforming method [14]. It is a well-established technology to extract hydrogen from fossil fuel stocks. Almost 10–11 million tonnes of hydrogen requirements of U.S. is fulfilled using steam reforming every year. Another 4% of hydrogen is produced from electrolysis method [15]. In this technology, water is splitted into oxygen and hydrogen using electric current. Some other techniques also contribute to hydrogen production like thermochemical cycles, wind, biomass gasification and solar. But these technologies are still at primary stage of research. As for overall hydrogen production potential, a 2009 analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) titled “Hydrogen Potential from Coal, Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Hydro Resources” examined the combined hydrogen production potential from the non-renewable energy sources, from renewable sources as wind, solar, and biomass [16]. The study found that out of total energy produced in US from coal, natural gas, hydro-electric, and nuclear power one can generate about 72 million metric tonnes of energy via. hydrogen that will have energy share of 30% with respect to the current annual energy used [16,17]. A key point related to hydrogen for energy production is that it is a substance that is “found” like crude oil or natural gas, but rather “made” in a similar to electricity from one of the many different means [18,19]. As with electricity, the environmental impacts of hydrogen use vary significantly by production method and its accompanying value or fuel chain. Recently, Borse et al. reported a similar information which indicated that, though hydrogen is a potential fuel, but it needs tremendous efforts with respect to its commercial viability. Ultimately it means hydrogen based technology still waits for identification of best ways to generate hydrogen for it commercial usage. In following section we have described various methodologies for production of hydrogen and it scope towards commercialization in future."
3,Paths of hydrogen production,
4,Steam methane reforming,"4.1 Steam methane reforming Natural gas is a not a recent advancement but a mature pathway for hydrogen production. It uses existing natural gas as an energy source, which is extracted from the earth’s crust. Around 96% of U.S. hydrogen production depends on this technology. Natural gas contains methane which can be combined with steam using thermal processes such as steam methane reformation and partial oxidation to produce hydrogen. In this technology steam maintained at high temperature (700–1000 °C) and pressure (3–25 bar) reacts with methane (CH4) in presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Further carbon monoxide and steam reacts over a catalyst to form carbon dioxide and more hydrogen. Further carbon dioxide and other impurities are removed to obtain pure hydrogen, above process is known as pressure swing adsorption. In place of CH4 there are also other fuels those can be used such as propane, gasoline, diesel and ethanol. Mainly some nickel based catalysts are needed to carry out such reaction. This is also known as steam methane reforming (SMR). The process in schematically summarized in Fig. 3 . The following reactions are involved in steam reforming process [14,20]: C H 4 + H 2 O → C O + 3 H 2 CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Most of the hydrogen produced in U.S. is mainly contributed by SMR methodology. This technique is highly preferred since it promises the commercial hydrogen production to fulfil all the demands in a very cost effective manner. In addition, emission of greenhouse gases is much less than the gasoline dependent methodologies. The main disadvantage of this method is it depends on dwindling fossil fuel stocks."
5,Coal gasification,"4.2 Coal gasification Coal gasification is another important ways to generate hydrogen. Coal is an important material that is useful to obtain variety of products. There are different methods to utilize coal as a source for fuel. One of them is coal gasification, which could yield power, liquid fuels, chemical and hydrogen. During such process, coal reacts with hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2) and steam under high pressure to form a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (synthesis gas). Carbon monoxide further reacts with steam via. Water-gas shift reaction to form additional hydrogen and carbon. After this process pure hydrogen is separated from the system and carbon is captured and sequestered. The schematic of method [21] is shown in Fig. 4 . The reactions occurring during this process can be given in following manner [22]: 3 C + O 2 + H 2 → H 2 + 3 C O CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Though USA has abundant coal source that can last for more than 250 years, but the greenhouse gas emission is a major threat for our environment. Consequently, this technology needs attention with respect to making it eco-friendlier so that it will hamper the environment. Accordingly, this technology could be made efficient and environment friendly if the coal gasification is further improved with respect to carbon capture and sequestration thus ensuring zero carbon dioxide release, that also involves employment of techniques other than cryogenic processes to separate oxygen from air, and possibly development of membranes to separate out pure hydrogen from the system. However, it needs time as well as financial investment to make the methodology an eco-friendly technique."
6,Electrolysis,"4.3 Electrolysis In the electrolysis process, water splits into hydrogen and oxygen by the application of electrical current. Generally, two electrodes (cathode and anode) are used in an aqueous solution containing KOH electrolyte as shown in Fig. 5 . This unit is known as electrolyser. Electrolysers can be small and large based on small scale and large scale hydrogen production respectively. This technology is relevant for “distributed hydrogen production”. Hydrogen production via electrolysis can be made completely zero greenhouse gas emissions depending upon the source used to provide energy to split water molecule. Accordingly, researchers are concentrating on wind energy or nuclear option to replace energy for electrolyser. It is predicted that usage of such energy source would result in reduction of cost incurred in delivering the electrical energy. The reaction occurring during the electrolysis can be written in following manner [23]: E l e c t r o l y t e 4 H 2 O → 4 H + + 4 OH - C a t h o d e 4 H + + 4 e - → 2 H 2 A n o d e 4 OH - → O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 4 e - O v e r a l l 2 H 2 O → O 2 + 2 H 2 This technology is used quite easily at industrial stage. There are various techniques[24] adopted for the improvement of this method like (1) Use of acidic polymer membrane rather than liquid electrolyte; (2) High temperature electrolysis, since energy needed at higher temperature is less than at lower temperature; (3) Use of photovoltaic system to provide electric power using solar energy to electrolyser. The main advantage of this technique is that, (1) it is a potential method for renewable energy generation; and (2) no greenhouse gas emission occurs. The main challenge associated with this technology involves a reduction in the cost of electrolyser manufacturing as well as improving efficiency of process. Another challenge is to interface the compressor in electrolyser so as to avoid cost of separate compressor that is desirable for high pressure hydrogen storage."
7,Biomass gasification,"4.4 Biomass gasification Biomass is one of the potential energy resources for hydrogen generation [25]. It is generally referred to the biological organic energy resources such as corn stover, wheat straw, forest residues, witch grass, willow trees, human waste and animal waste. There are various methods (viz. physical, thermal, chemical and biological conversion) to generate energy from biomass. The biomass could be converted to heat, electricity, solid fuels such as coal, liquid fuels such as bio-oil, methanol, etc. and gas fuels such as hydrogen and syngas. Gasification is a thermochemical process for destruction of feedstocks (i.e. biomass, lignocellulosic residues, agriculture waste, refuse derived fuel and organic wastes) to produce energy carrier. However, the technology with steam alone requires additional energy cost for increasing temperature of the steam. Further, the steam gasification reaction being an endothermic reaction, to reduce the energy cost by partial oxidation (exothermic reaction) reaction of biomass, air is also used. Thus, Biomass can be productively converted into mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide on reaction with steam and oxygen under high temperature and pressure. The unit used for carrying out such reactions is known as gasifier. The synthesis gas produced in this technology is produced by breaking down biomass chemically by heat, steam and oxygen present in the gasifier. Further to this, a reaction similar to coal gasification i.e. water gas shift reaction, occurs to convert carbon monoxide (CO) into carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2), and ultimately the separation of hydrogen. Biomass gasification generally involves thermal treatment of organic or fossil fuels based matter and its conversion into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The schematic of biomass gasification is shown in Fig. 6 . The reaction is carried out at high temperature more than 700 °C without letting combustion to occur. It involves chain of reaction in which firstly steam reacts with char to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen via reaction [25]: C + H 2 O → C O + H 2 Further steam is reacted with carbon monoxide and gives more hydrogen CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 The main challenge involved in this technology is biomass gasification, as it is not as simple as coal gasification, and it also leads to other undesirable hydrocarbon compounds as by-products. Thus some extra steps are required to reform these hydrocarbons into pure synthesis gas by using catalyst. This technology is most appropriate for large scale, centralized hydrogen production. This holds advantages as (1) Abundance of Biomass as energy source; (2) Near-zero release of greenhouse gases as growth of biomass gasification reaction carbon dioxide is consumed, which in turn consumes it from atmosphere and makes it clean. Thus, the gasification of the biomass and/or the agriculture waste can efficiently generate the hydrogen and the syngas. If this process can be fully utilized, the gasification of these materials not only partially solving the problem of landfill, energy, especially hydrogen, can also be produced during the waste treatment. Further, to enhance the hydrogen yield and reduce the tar formation during the process, catalyst can also be added into the gasifier."
8,Photoelectrochemical/photocatalytic decomposition of water,"4.5 Photoelectrochemical/photocatalytic decomposition of water Photo-electrochemical water splitting involves production of hydrogen from two most abundant renewable sources as water and sunlight. Generally, a two-electrode setup is used where one electrode acts as anode to yield oxygen, and the other electrode as cathode to produce hydrogen. The anode is a semiconducting electrode, which generates electrons when illuminated using solar light. These electrons are capable of producing hydrogen from water. Such cells used for hydrogen production are known as photo-electrochemical cells. This technology is still at its infancy with respect to its commercial viability. Thus a focussed research is required on finding most suited semiconductor, which has ideal band edge positions as well as has very good stability in electrolyte. Another important aspect is reactor designing, which needs directional attention from researchers and engineers to resolve various problems occurring in fabrication and utilization of an ideal configuration. Fig. 7 shows schematic of a laboratory scale photo electrochemical cell that is capable of performing PEC studies under simulated solar radiation [27]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production involves use of semiconducting powder for the production of hydrogen. This kind of reactions doesn’t need any external biasing."
9,Thermochemical water splitting,"4.6 Thermochemical water splitting Thermochemical processes involve chemical reaction that produces hydrogen derived by high temperature heat (500–2000 °C). The source of heat could be nuclear reactor or solar concentrators. Chemicals are reused within each cycle to create a closed loop chemical reaction with only consumption of water for hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 8 . In thermochemical water splitting, series of chemical reactions are carried out at high temperature to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This technology produces hydrogen at low cost and high efficiency. But still it couldn’t reach commercial stage. The following reactions are followed in Sulphur/Iodine cycle [28]. H 2 SO 4 850 ° C → S O 2 + H 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 I 2 120 ° C + SO 2 + 2 H 2 O → H 2 SO 4 + 2 H I 2 H I 450 ° C → H 2 + I 2 This technology is suitable for large scale and centralized hydrogen production. The advantage of use of above method involves clean and pure hydrogen production with zero greenhouse gas emissions. This technology faces the challenges of reducing the cost of solar concentrators and heat transfer medium and also development of nuclear reactor technology to provide required heat at low temperature."
10,Bio-hydrogen production,"4.7 Bio-hydrogen production Bio-hydrogen method of hydrogen production has gained tremendous momentum since last two decades in view of rising fraction of waste-materials and thereby need of their minimization. Biological processes are catalysed by microorganisms those exist in aqueous environment, atmospheric pressure and under ambient temperature [29–33]. Such processes can be exploited in the localities where sources of biomass or bio-waste materials are well-accessible. Natural availability of these precursors thus reduce the energy costs and the transport-cost of the initial raw material. It is imperative that the low cost of raw material, content of carbohydrate, their bio-degradability and availability enables one to select these materials for generating useful hydrogen energy. In general, biological processes occur over various types of anaerobic bacteria or algae. Microorganisms participate in different manner wrt. the type of substrate and the process conditions. Unlike various other methods bio-hydrogen is interesting renewable methodology, that needs a technology development wrt. efficient hydrogen production by an economic way. Biologically produced hydrogen is a by-product of various metabolic processes of microorganisms. There are various newly developed technologies those can be explained in following section. Biological hydrogen production methods can be classified as follows: • Direct bio-photolysis • Indirect bio-photolysis • Photo fermentation • Dark fermentation • Two stage process (integration of dark and photo fermentation) • Bio-catalyzed electrolysis We briefly explain each of the methods in following sections below: 4.7.1 Direct bio-photolysis Direct photolysis is one where water molecule is split over biological system under the irradiation of photons, such processes are found in plants and algal photosynthesis. Fig. 9 shows a schematic of one such process. The figure clearly shows that how solar energy is directly converted to hydrogen via. photosynthetic reactions. 2H2O+‘light energy’→2H2+O2 Algae splits water molecules to H+ and oxygen via. photosynthesis process. The generated H+ are converted into hydrogen gas by “hydrogenase enzyme”. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is one of the well-known hydrogen producing algae. Activity of hydrogenase has also been observed in other green algae like Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorococcum littorale, Platymonas subcordiformis and Chlorella fusca. The advantage of the present method is utilization of water as an inexpensive and abundant reactant. There are quite a few reports on improvement of bio-hydrogen production efficiency using micro algae [34]. Direct bio-photolysis method occurs at a partial pressure of nearly one atmosphere of O2, which is a 1000-fold higher than its maximum tolerance. Thus, the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase enzyme reaction and supporting reductant generating pathway remains the key problem for more than 3 decades. Hydrogen production by green algae based direct photolysis is currently limited by three issues: (i) solar conversion efficiency of the photosynthetic reactor; (ii) H2 synthesis processes (i.e. the need to separate the processes of H2O oxidation from H2 synthesis); and (iii) Bio-reactor design and economy. There are number of approaches to improve H2 production by green algae. They include -Genetic engineering of light gathering antennae, Optimization of light input into photo-bioreactors, and Improvement to the two-phase H2 production systems used with green algae. In direct bio-photolysis, hydrogen production rates of the order of 0.07 mmol/h per liter have been reported in the literature. 4.7.2 Indirect bio-photolysis In indirect bio-photolysis, problems of sensitivity of the hydrogen evolving process are potentially circumvented by separating temporally and/or spatially oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution. Thus indirect bio-photolysis processes involve separation of the H2 and O2 evolution reactions into separate stages, coupled through CO2 fixation/evolution. The schematic for the indirect bio-photolysis is shown in Fig. 10 . Cyanobacteria have the unique characteristics of using CO2 in the air as a carbon source and solar energy as an energy source. The cells take up CO2 first to produce cellular substances, which are subsequently used for hydrogen production. The overall mechanism of hydrogen production in cyanobacteria can be represented by the following reactions [29]: 12H2O+6CO2+‘lightenergy’→C6H12O6+6O2 C6H12O6+12H2O+‘light energy’→12H2+6CO2 Cyanobacteria possess key enzymes (nitrogenase and hydrogenase) those carry out the metabolic functions facilitate the hydrogen generation. Anabaena species and strains have been subject of intense study due to their higher rates of H2 production. In indirect bio-photolysis mutant strains of A. variabilis have demonstrated hydrogen production rate of the order of 0.355 mmol/h per liter. 4.7.3 Photo fermentation H2 production by purple non-sulfur bacteria is mainly due to the presence of nitrogenase under nitrogen-deficient conditions using light energy and reduced compounds (organic acids). The reaction is as follows: CH3COOH+2H2O+‘light energy’→4H2+2CO2 Photosynthetic bacteria have long been studied for their capacity to produce significant amounts of hydrogen. The advantage of this method are that oxygen does not inhibit the process. These photoheterotrophic bacteria have been found suitable to convert light energy into H2 using organic wastes as substrate in batch processes, continuous cultures, or immobilized whole cell system using different solid matrices like carrageenan, agar gel, porous glass, and polyurethane foam. The disadvantages are the limited availability of organic acids, the nitrogenase enzyme is slow, the process requires a relatively high amount of energy, and hydrogen re-oxidation. To increase the nitrogenase activity and decrease the energy requirements, the proper ratio of carbon to nitrogen nutrients must be maintained. Another major factor affecting the photo-fermentation process is light intensity. Although an increase in light intensity has shown some stimulatory effect on the overall hydrogen production rate of photosynthetic micro-organisms, an adverse effect was also reported on their light conversion efficiency at high light intensities. However, the light conversion efficiency can be improved by genetic manipulation of the light-harvesting antennae, thereby reducing the saturation effect of light. Hydrogen production rates of the order of 145–160 mmol/h per liter by this methods have been reported. Certain photoheterotrophic bacteria within the superfamily Rhodospirillaceae can grow in the dark using CO as the sole carbon source to generate ATP with the simultaneous release of H2 and CO2. The oxidation of CO to CO2 with the release of H2 occurs via a water gas shift reaction as shown below: CO+H2O→CO2+H2 4.7.4 Dark fermentation Hydrogen can be produced by anaerobic bacteria, grown in the dark on carbohydrate-rich substrates. Bacteria known to produce hydrogen include species of Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium. Carbohydrates, mainly glucose, are the preferred carbon sources for fermentation processes, which predominantly give rise to acetic and butyric acids together with hydrogen gas. Theoretically bioconversion of 1 mol of glucose yields 12 mol of hydrogen gas (H2). According to reaction stoichiometry, bioconversion of 1 mol of glucose into acetate yields 4 mol H2/mol glucose, but only 2 molH2/mol glucose is formed when butyrate is the end product. The equations below explain the stoichiometry. C6H12O6+2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2+4H2 C6H12O6+2H2O→2CH3CH2COOH+2CO2+2H2 While direct and indirect photolysis systems produce pure H2, dark fermentation processes produce a mixed biogas containing primarily H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2), but which may also contain lesser amounts of methane (CH4), CO, and/or hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Dark-fermentation proves to be superior over photo-fermentation as this requires no light and the energy produced is relatively higher, due to the fermentation of sugar and carbohydrates. The process is initiated by the hydrolysis of organic polymers to monomers, thereafter acetogenic conversion of monomers to organic acids, alcohols, and release of hydrogen. Although bio-hydrogen production by dark fermentation is promising and advantageous over photo-fermentation. However, the requirement of organic biomass as a feedstock makes this process quite expensive. Hydrogen production by these bacteria is highly dependent on the process conditions such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and gas partial pressure, which affect metabolic balance. The partial pressure of H2 (pH2) is an extremely important factor for continuous H2 synthesis. Hydrogen synthesis pathways are sensitive to H2 concentrations and are subject to end-product inhibition. As H2 concentrations increase, H2 synthesis decreases. Sugars and carbohydrate rich biomass are reported to be the most suitable feedstock for the formation of bio-hydrogen from dark fermentation. Two stage process with integration of dark and photo fermentation In fermentation, complete oxidation of 1 mol of glucose yields 12 mol of hydrogen. However, complete oxidation of glucose into hydrogen and carbon dioxide is not possible as the corresponding reaction is not feasible thermodynamically as can be understood from the following equation. C6H12O6+6H2O→12H2+6CO2 With external energy supply (photon-energy in photo-fermentation) theoretically 12 mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose can be produced. However, this process cannot be operated in the absence of light. On the other hand, in the absence of external energy (in the case of dark fermentation), oxidation of glucose by fermentative bacteria results in other by-products also and maximum 4 mol of hydrogen are produced per mole of glucose consumption with acetate as the sole by-product as given by the equation below. C6H12O6+2H2O→4H2+2CO2+2CH3COOH Acetate produced in the dark-fermentation stage can be oxidized by photosynthetic bacteria to produce hydrogen as follows: CH3COOH+2H2O+‘light energy’→4H2+2CO2 Hence continuous production of hydrogen at maximum yield can be achieved by integrating dark- and photo-fermentation methods [30]. 4.7.5 Bio-catalyzed electrolysis Another way of oxidizing the acetate (or the effluent of dark fermentation process) to produce hydrogen is to provide external energy in the form of electrical energy instead of solar energy. In this approach, the bioreactor containing acetate forms the anodic compartment of an electrolyzer cell and protons and electrons produced by bacteria are collected at cathode (a platinum electrode catalysing hydrogen evolution reaction). Anodic and cathodic reactions are as follows: Anodic:2CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2+8H++8e− Cathodic:8H++8e−→4H2 This section distinctly validates that there is tremendous potential in Bio-hydrogen methodology as an eco-friendly and renewable option. The ongoing developments are thus expected to yield a technology that would generate hydrogen in a more rapid manner. Such developments would facilitate the promotion of hydrogen as fuel of the future [35]."
11,Summary,"Hydrogen production using natural gas and fossil fuels covers major part of industrial hydrogen production at present time. It is predicted to continue in future also at rather large scale of production with this technology. However, generation of greenhouse gases is a major drawback of these reactions, in addition the dwindling stocks of fossil fuels is a topic of concern. The 95% of today’s hydrogen demands are fulfilled by natural gas as it proves to be promising technique relative to present scenario of all other hydrogen production techniques. Another useful method, which involves hydrogen production at feasible stage, is electrolysis. There are tremendous attempts to use other renewable sources instead of electricity as; it makes this hydrogen technology a comparatively a costly method. Distributed hydrogen production can be possible by making use of electrolysis process which can also be utilized in small scale industries. But predicted higher infrastructure cost is seen as a financial burden for small capacity plants. Hydrogen production using coal gasification and biomass gasification are simpler to utilize for hydrogen generation but they still need solution with respect to minimization of heavy carbon dioxide production produced during these gasification reactions. In other words carbon capture and sequestration must be more effective. Photo-electrochemical and Bio hydrogen production involves clean and pure hydrogen production via. most abundant renewable sources like water and sunlight. But these technologies are still in infancy and thus need significant research and commercialization steps. Nonetheless, the cost of hydrogen (summarized in Table 1 ) remains an important issue to be considered. SMR costs 18 dollar/million BTU, which is 3 times more than natural gas (6 dollar/million BTU). Electrolysis produces pure hydrogen at the cost of 28 dollar/million BTU. Thus, till today natural gas is the most favoured option for hydrogen generation and utilization in industries. In order to have a competing renewable energy option, though bio-hydrogen seems to be most relevant but it needs lot of efforts for cost reduction. At the extreme end hydrogen generation using renewable sources as water and solar light, it would need some important achievement with respect to photocatalytic and photoelectron chemical hydrogen generation."
