0,Introduction,"Globally, the rapid increase in the number of vehicles mandates the need for more fossil fuel resource to meet the fuel demands and simultaneously, it produces more emissions. It is need of the hour to have an alternative for fossil fuel to demand the global fuel demands. In line with this, the production cost and exhaust emission of the alternative fuel should be kept at minimum levels. A number of researchers tested various edible/non-edible oils as bio fuels for engine application. But the cost of fuel cost from raw oil to final stage of biodiesel production is higher than the fossil fuel while the output is also not superior in bio fuels compared to their counterparts. The main drawback of biodiesel production is that it needs more land area for high amount of production. Further, the risk of increase in the food price is also present when edible feed stocks are preferred as biodiesel instead of food [1,2]. Biomass is an excellent alternative for producing vehicle fuels which can surpass the need for petroleum products and it can also reduce the Greenhouse Gas emissions. Ashok et al. [3] extracted the biofuel from lemon peel and blended it with diesel to fuel the single cylinder stationary diesel engine. The researchers concluded from the results there was an improvement in the diesel engine performance while at the same time, the carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emission also got reduced when the lemon peel oil was high in the blend proportion. Many researchers used the alcohols, oxygenated additives with biodiesel to enhance the combustion efficiency and reduce the exhaust emission. Ashok et al. [4–6] used Calophyllum Inophyllum methyl ester with zinc oxide, decanol, ethanox and hexanox. They observed that exhaust emissions of HC, CO and NOx reduced by adding above mentioned fuel additives and alcohols. Ashok et al. [7,8] tested the antioxidant Ethanox, Butylated hydroxytoluene blended with Calophyllum Inophyllum methyl ester and noticed the increasing of CO, HC, BTE and BSFC. Cashew nut shell (CNS) is one of the prominent biomasses available in abundant quantities in India, particularly in the southern region of the country. It can be utilized as a biofuel in the transportation of vehicles. The cultivation of cashew nut in India is spread across 0.87 million hectares of land and a total of 0.6 million metric tons of raw cashew nuts are produced every year [9]. Patel et al., [10,11] in their study reported the cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) extraction through vacuum pyrolysis method. Generally, the CNSL is made up to 52% cardanol, 30% polymeric material with 10% cardol, whereas other substances make up the remaining 8%. Distillation process is deployed to process the technical CNSL at reduced pressure with an aim to get rid of the polymeric material. The distilled technical CNSL has 78% cardanol in it with 8% cardol and 2% polymeric material whereas the rest of the portion (12%) is made up by other remaining substances. The CNSL produced a dark brown oil when gently heated at 100-175OC and when it was made to undergo pyrolysis at 5000C under vacuum (720 mm Hg), it further got purified [12]. There is a huge calorific value (40 MJ/kg) noted in this pyrolyzed oil which makes it one of the best promising bio oils that can replace the fuel in diesel engines [13–15]. Through double-stage transesterification process too, one can produce the biodiesel from CNSL and this process should be followed by preheating so as to increase the BTE and decrease the HC and CO emissions in diesel engine [16]. The thermal cracking process, also known as the pyrolysis, was demonstrated by Edwin Geo et al., [17] and the process is based on thermo-chemical decomposition of matter without the presence of oxidants. In the research conducted by Velmurugan et al., [18,19] a thermal reactor was fabricated by the researchers in order to extract the thermal cracked CNSL (TC-CNSL) and its properties were tested. The final results from the engine test inferred there is an improvement in the performance as well as reduction in the HC, CO emissions due to pre heating of the CNSL. In the recent times, the investigations conducted upon hydrogen-enriched diesel engine gained momentum, thanks to the environmental benefits one acquires from it. The modern diesel engines with hydrogen-enriched air systems increase the BTE and decrease the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. There is a mild increase in the emission of oxides of nitrogen when contrasted with diesel operations though there is a decline observed in terms of smoke and particulate matter [20,21]. Senthilkumar et al., [22] also tested a single cylinder diesel engine with hydrogen-diesel dual fuel mode. The engine was supplied with industrial-standards hydrogen at a reduced pressure of 2 bar from 140 bar to the inlet manifold via a water-and-air-based flame arrestor. In this study, the hydrogen flow rate was fixed at three levels such as 4 lpm, 6lpm as well as 8 lpm. Of the considered levels, the 6 lpm hydrogen flow rate exhibited the least HC and CO emission with high BTE. Koten et al.,[23] investigated a four-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine with hydrogen flow rates being 0.20, 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80 lpm. The results showed an increase in BTE and reduced HC, CO and soot emission due to excellent formation of the mixture and increase in the flame speed of hydrogen gas. In recent times, a number of researchers used hydrogen along with biofuels in duel fuel mode only to improve the combustion efficiency as well as diminish the exhaust emissions. GokhanTuccar and Erinc¸ Uludamar [24] considered Pomegranate seed Oil Biodiesel (POB) as an alternative fuel in diesel engines that are enriched with hydrogen. The results inferred that the hydrogen enrichment with POB resulted in a mild enhancement in exhaust emissions as well as engine performance. Mustafa KaanBaltacioglu et al., [25] conducted an investigation on pilot injection diesel engine with few additives of substitute fuels such as biodiesel, hydroxy (HHO) and pure hydrogen. It was observed by the researchers that there was an increase in the engine performance when the intake air was enriched with HHO than pure hydrogen in contrast to normal diesel fuel operating conditions. In the study conducted by T. Korakianitis et al., [26], the water-in-biodiesel emulsions were tested as a pilot fuel with hydrogen dual-fuel mode operation. The results showed that there was an increase in the thermal efficiency and decrease in the NOx emission when using emulsified biodiesel fuels when compared to neat biodiesel. In the study, the Natural Gas (NG) was infused at the intake air inlet replacing the hydrogen in biodiesel-operated diesel engine [27]. In this research, the pilot fuel (eucalyptus biodiesel or diesel fuel) is injected inside the combustion chamber in order to cover a tentative 10% maximum power output and retain the pilot fuel flow rate at a constant rate, whereas the power output is then enhanced utilizing NG. In case of heavy engine loads, there was a reduction in the emission levels of HC, CO and CO2 when using eucalyptus biodiesel as the pilot fuel. A heavy-duty diesel engine was experimented by Timothy Gattset al., [28] under NG-diesel and H2-diesel dual fuel combustion mode. According to the study results, it was inferred that the combustion efficiency of the gaseous fuels got increased when H2 or NG was added above 4% or 3%. At the time of adding in small quantities, there was a comparative combustion efficiency of CH4 was recorded, but only less to H2. This might be attributed to the enhanced CO emissions when operating under NG-diesel dual fuel engine. Various proportions of ethanol were also used with Tamanu Methyl Ester (TME) and hydrogen to improve the BTE and reduce the CO, smoke and NOx emissions [29]. The NOx emission rate is higher in hydrogen-diesel or biodiesel engine, thanks to high temperature creation and high flame speed recorded in hydrogen fuel. Even though there are numerous NOx control methods are incorporated in the engine, the EGR remains the best effective technical method since it recirculates the exhaust gas into the engine’s intake manifold and it decreases the emission of oxides of nitrogen from diesel engines. This is possible as it diminishes the flame temperature as well as the concentration of oxygen in working fluid present in the combustion chamber. A number of researchers used the EGR technique with hydrogen-enriched diesel or biodiesel engine to reduce the NOx emission. Nanthagopal et al., [30] used 30% EGR in a diesel engine fueled with 100% waste cooking oil methyl ester and conventional diesel. The study reveals that the 30% EGR addition decreased the BTE and NOx. Further, the 30% EGR has substantially increased the carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions for both the fuels at load. The author also introduced the EGR in hydrogen-diesel dual fuel mode engine [31,32]. Here the H2 fuel flow was varied from 2 lpm to 10 lpm at a pressure of 2 bar and the EGR percentages were kept at 10% and 20%. From the results, the optimum combination of 6 lpm hydrogen flow rate was identified to reduce the BTE, HC and CO whereas the NOx emission got increased in the absence of EGR. There was a reduction in high NOx emission with 10% and 20% EGR. Probir Kumar Bose and Dines Maji [33] introduced hydrogen along with EGR and air via the diesel engine’s inlet manifold. The researchers maintained the hydrogen injection rates at five different levels such as 2 L/min, 4 L/min, 6 L/min, 8 L/min and 10 L/min with 2 bar injection pressure. The results inferred that there was a decrease in the HRR and peak pressure when the EGR rate got increased. In view of the literature overviewed, the usage of biodiesel from consumable as well as non-consumable oils in automobile is emerging slowly as a potential and promising substitute for fossil fuel. However, few major drawbacks associated with biodiesel are its viscosity, volatility, emission, cultivation area and production cost. These factors limit the usage of biodiesel in automobiles which can be resolved by substituting the gaseous fuels like hydrogen and natural gas with biodiesel. The mixture formation and flame speed of the gaseous fuels enhance the combustion efficiency as well as mitigate the emission problem. But the problem with gaseous fuels is that it increases the NOx emission and reduces the power output. At present, the EGR technology is used to reduce the NOx emission in diesel engines. Most of the literatures available are diesel - hydrogen dual fuel engine with EGR. But there is no significant research conducted that analyzes the effect of EGR in biodiesel-hydrogen dual fuel engine to minimize NOx emission. Moreover, the cost of producing biodiesel from different edible and non-edible oils is high when contrasted with diesel fuel. In the present work, the Bio fuel extracted from Cashew Nut Shell is a promising, low cost and renewable alternative that produce low emissions and further, it can be disposed in a useful manner. The thermal-cracked Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (TC-CNSL) biofuel was produced from locally designed and fabricated thermal reactor following pyrolysis method. Both hydrogen as well as biofuel is used in dual fuel mode. Here the optimized TC-CNSL-diesel blend (B20) was experimented at different flow rates of hydrogen fuel. The in-house developed cooled EGR system was used in biodiesel- hydrogen dual fuel engine. In this work, different EGR percentages were utilized to minimize the NOX emission. The optimized CNSL biodiesel-hydrogen-EGR was used to analyze the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the dual fuel engine."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Production of TC-CNSL,"2.1 Production of TC-CNSL In processing the raw CNSL, the distillation of the technical CNSL (DT-CNSL) is the first step. In DT-CNSL, the proportion of components is 78% cardanol with 8% cardol and 2% polymeric material whereas the rest is made up by other substances on volume basis. In the current research work, the thermal-cracked CNSL (TC-CNSL) was derived from Cardonal in the temperature range of 180 °C and 380 °C, under 1 atmosphere pressure. Fig. 1 shows the schematic reactor for the generation of TC-CNSL. The main components of the reactor are CNSL tank, heating coil, safety valve, pressure gauge, temperature controller, condenser, and beaker. A 5-litre capacity tank is filled with DT-CNSL (cardanol). This is followed by heating the reactor by temperature-controlled electric heater until the temperature of oil reaches 380 °C. Once the evaporated oil gets condensed in the condenser, it is collected in the beaker. Fig. 2 shows the collected organic fraction i.e., TC-CNSL which is light dark in color. In the condenser, the researchers used the constant flow rate of water as a coolant. Both pressure gauge as well as safety value were used in the reactor in order to determine the confine the surplus pressure generated within the reactor respectively. Table 1 lists out the critical features of TC-CNSL as well as diesel fuel which were experimented in the laboratory. At IIT Madras, Chennai, the TC-CNSL sample was evaluated with FTIR at Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility. In the Fig. 3 , the FTIR spectra is showcasing the TC-CNSL’s functional group compositional analysis. With the help of Nicolet Magna 550 series FTIR spectroscopy, the researchers recorded the FTIR spectra using an online plotter in order to generate the IR spectra in the derived oil [13]. The purpose behind using IR spectroscopy is to monitor the development of cracking reactions that occur in TC-CNSL and to characterize the organic, inorganic and biological compounds that are available in the CSNL methyl ester. This study further utilized a two-beam interferometer in which a set of IR rays were allowed to pass through the sample. Using FTIR technique, the path difference as well as the wavelength absorption rate were discussed resulting in the rise of a spectrum. This spectrum is then contrasted with standard data and identified for the availability of different compounds. This research made use of Perkin Elmer spectrum FTIR instrument which can cover the whole IR region i.e., 450–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 1.0 cm−1. With this precision, one can identify different functional groups such as alkanes, alkyl halides, ethers, alkenes, esters, amines, anhydrides, ketones, aldehydes, alkynes, benzenes, acid chlorides, alcohols, carboxylic acid and amides using this instrument. Fig. 3 shows the spectral data collected from FTIR from which it was inferred that the composition of TC-CNSL oil has excellent quality and high quantity of esters carboxylic acid and alkyl functional group. From the peak absorption of OH group, it was understood that the phenolic compounds got projected at a frequency of 3289 cm−1 [18]."
3,Hydrogen fuel supply system,"2.2 Hydrogen fuel supply system The hydrogen fuel supplying system consists of a hydrogen cylinder along with a pressure regulator whereas the flame arrester as well as flash back arrestor and digital gas flow meter are its components as shown in the Fig. 4 . Fig. 4.1 shows that the hydrogen gas (of 99.995% purity), stored in a cylinder, was fed into the engine manifold at 2 bar pressure. A total of 7 cubic meter of hydrogen was filled in the hydrogen cylinder at a pressure of 140 bar. The pressure of the hydrogen was brought down from 140 to 2 bar with the help of regulator. In order to ensure there is no backfiring in the cylinder, the gas from the cylinder is let out through a water flame trap, chemical flame arrestor, along with a non-return type flashback arrester in the series. Water-based flame arrester is one of the simplest and important safety devices in the hydrogen flow line. It is made of stainless steel and partly filled with water as shown in Fig. 4.2. The inlet tube is immersed in the water whereas the outlet tube is mounted just above the water level. The gas from hydrogen cylinder is passed through the inlet tube and the gas that comes out of the water in the form of bubbles is collected in the empty space above the water level. It is then passed through the outlet tube to the engine. When the fire that comes from the engine side is completely stopped, the flow of fire is prevented further to the cylinder. Chemical-based flame arrester (Fig. 4.3) a honeycomb structure in which the chemical substances are mounted in its central part. The hydrogen gas from the cylinder is passed through the flame arrester to the engine side. The mechanism behind this flame arrester is, when the fire travels from engine to the central part of flame arrester, it heats the central part of the chemical honeycomb structure, thereby producing a chemical reaction which quenches the fire. It never allows the fire from one side to another. The non-return valve (Fig. 4.4) is used to ensure that there is no occurrence of reverse flow of hydrogen into the system. The non-return valve, made up of brass, allows the gas in only one direction i.e., from cylinder to engine. The flow rate of hydrogen is measured by ALICAT-make digital mass flow meter (Fig. 4.5) in Liters Per Minute (LPM), which has the flow range of 0 to 100 LPM. The digital mass flow meter is calibrated by allowing a known amount of hydrogen gas to flow through and repeating the measurements for 6 times to check the accuracy and repeatability."
4,Hydrogen enrichment,"2.3 Hydrogen enrichment The process of adding hydrogen to air is called as hydrogen enrichment. In this experiment, different flow rates of hydrogen were used such as 4 lpm, 6 lpm and 8 lpm. Since the intake air is enriched with hydrogen, the amount of biodiesel combusted by the engine is reduced in all the loads. Fig. 5 showcases that there is an increment in the percentage of biodiesel replacement with the increase in hydrogen flow rate at any given load. In line with this, when the hydrogen flow rate was fixed, the percentage of biodiesel replacement by hydrogen was also increased with decreasing loads. High replacement was recorded in lower load than the higher load. This is a trend impacted by the fact that the hydrogen flow rate is fixed for overall loads while at the same time, there is a decrease in the consumption of biodiesel with decreasing loads. In the Fig. 6 , the energy discharged by hydrogen at various hydrogen flow rates under various loads is showcased. When the Figs. 5 and 6 are compared at full load at 4 lpm hydrogen, 5.26% energy released with 2% biodiesel replacement. In case of 20% load with 4% diesel replacement, the hydrogen energy content was 10%. This trend was observed similarly in all the flow rates of hydrogen at various loads. This might be attributed to the high caloric value of the hydrogen gas, during the replacement of biodiesel, and its excellent combustion at high flame speed [32]."
5,Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),"2.4 Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) The diesel engines predominantly emit NO x , HC, CO and particulates in the form of exhaust gas. In controlling the NOx emission, the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) seems to be the best method with high efficiency. When the exhaust gas is recirculated, then it avoids the combustion chamber being filled with incoming fresh air [31,32]. During this scenario, there is a reduction in the oxygen level in combustion chamber which eventually impacts the exhaust emission too. When the exhaust gas is added into the engine cylinder, it enhances the specific heat of the mixture which leads to diminished combustion rate of air-fuel mixture. The lower peak temperature occurs as a result due to reduced oxygen content of air as well as reduced combustion rate. Thus, the engine’s NOx formation gets decreased. The engine’s EGR percentage (%EGR) is defined as (1) % E G R = Volume o f E G R Totalchar g e i n t o t h e c y l i n d e r ∗ 100 With the high concentration of inert gases present in the combustion chamber, there is a reduction noted in adiabatic flame temperature [34]. When full loads of EGR is used, there are disadvantages associated with it, for instance, high soot and particulate emissions due to decrease in the diffusion combustion. At the same time, in case of low loads, a section of the unburnt HC gets burnt in the successive cycles thus reducing the HC emissions at part load. In this work, the engine was tested at different EGR rates namely 10% to 20%, and 30% with the optimized flow rate of 6 lpm H2 and B20 blends. Keeping the EGR temperature at constant 25 °C, the coolant was circulated with temperature controller. The researchers assessed the emission, performance and combustion parameters for diverse EGR rates with optimized flow rate of 6lpm H2 and B20 blends."
6,Experimental setup and procedure,"In this present investigation, the researchers conducted the tests using a single cylinder, water-cooled, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine which is manufactured by Kirloskar (AV-1, make-Kirloskar). The rated power and speed of the engine were 3.7 kW and 1500 rpm. The schematic diagram of the experimental setup and engine specifications are depicted in Fig. 7 and Table 2 respectively. The test setup consisted of an engine, a dynamometer, biodiesel supply system, intake air supply line, hydrogen supply line, EGR system, data acquisition unit and emission analyzer. The engine was loaded using an eddy-current dynamometer (SaJ- make) fixed with a controller in order to measure and vary the load. In determining the consumption of pilot fuel biodiesel, the weighing machine (Essae- make) was used and time taken for 50 g of fuel consumption was measured. With the help of a K-type thermocouple, the exhaust gas temperature was measured since the former is connected to the digital display unit. The researchers also determined the crank angle as well as the cylinder pressure using crank angle encoder and piezoelectric pressure transducer (Make: Kistler, Type 6056A) respectively. The pressure signal acquired from the setup was then passed onto data acquisition system from where the information on combustion such as peak pressure, cylinder pressure, ignition delay and HRR were obtained. All the parameters measurements were carried out for 100 cycles and an average of these values were considered to diminish the impact of cycle-by-cycle variation. Using Non-Dispersive Infrared Analyzers (NDIR) (Make: HORIBA, Japan), the NOx, CO and HC emissions were determined. Prior to the measurement, the gas analyzers were calibrated with the help of standard gases. In the hydrogen supply system, there exists H2 Cylinder, flame arrestor, pressure regulator, flashback arrestor and mass flow meter (detail given in chapter 2.3). The EGR system consists of EGR valve and EGR cooler. The experimentation was performed in the first stage using various mixtures of CNSL and diesel fuel which are termed asB20, B40, B60, B80 and B100. The B20 blend found to be an optimized blend for maximum BTE and reduced HC and CO emission. This blend was used as a pilot fuel for further investigation with the addition of H2. In the second stage, the H2 gas was inducted with air in the inlet manifold at different flow rates namely 4 lpm, 6 lpm and 8 lpm. The optimum flow rate of H2 was found to be 6 lpm with B20blendsformaximum BTE and minimum HC and CO emission. In order to reduce the NOx emission, the EGR was introduced in the third stage with different percentages namely 10%, 20% and 30% with 6lpm H2 and B20 blends. The engine was loaded starting from 0% and up to 100% in the interval range of 20% for overall combination of EGR rate and fuel. Further, the study also discussed the performance, emissions and combustion of the hydrogen enriched with biodiesel and EGR which were then compared and contrasted with B20 biodiesel. Any experimental measurements, irrespective of the type of instrument used, possess some uncertainty. In the present research work, the Uncertainty analysis is carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of engine performance and emission measurements. Estimation of uncertainty of some important parameters from known measured values is evaluated based on the square root method and the same has been presented in Table 3 ."
7,Result and discussion,
8,Performance analysis,"4.1 Performance analysis 4.1.1 Brake thermal efficiency In all the tested fuels, there was an increase in BTE observed whenever the engine load was increased. Fig. 8 showcases the BTE differences with brake power in case of various fuel modes such as B20, B20 and 6lpm H2 (B206H2), 10%, 20% and 30% EGR addition. From the experimental results, it can be inferred that there is an increase in the BTE when hydrogen is added in all the loads. Further, there is also an indication that the hydrogen got combusted. The reason behind the increase in the efficiency might be due to increased combustion rate, thanks to hydrogen’s high flame velocity [25,34]. There was a low combustion efficiency observed in the hydrogen when biodiesel was present in low load range. In high range load, the combustion efficiency of hydrogen, in presence of biodiesel, was high. The BTE got decreased with the addition of EGR in all engine loads. This might be attributed to the availability of EGR where the oxygen concentration in the intake air is lowered resulting in a notable negative impact on the combustion [34]. There was a decrease observed in the engine BTE when the EGR percentage was increased. The BTE was 32.3% in case of 10% EGR at full load while the BTE got reduced to 30.5%, in case of 30% EGR. 4.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) In the Fig. 9 , the BSFC is seen plotted with brake power for B20, B206H2 and different percentages of EGR addition. It can be observed that the BSFC of B206H2 was less than B20 and EGR addition for all engine loads. This occurred only because of the excellent blend of hydrogen as well as air leading to complete combustion of fuel. In addition to this, a wide flammability range, high flame speed and short quenching distance of hydrogen ensured that the biodiesel is combusted completely resulting in the reduced BSFC [25]. At the time of applying EGR, there was an increase found in BSFC with the increasing trend in EGR percentage, in all loads. This increment found in the BSFC might be because of the negative impact of EGR upon combustion which in turn results in the incomplete combustion [33]. The increase in BSFC was more for 30% EGR, when compared to all combinations of fuel used such as B20, B206H2, 10% EGR and20% EGR. Hence the dilution effect of inlet air was high during high quantity of EGR addition. There was less percentage of reduction observed in BSFC at higher load in comparison with lower load. This is the reason for excess amount of air available at full load for complete combustion. The BSFC for B206H2, 10%, 20% and 30% EGR addition were 0.26, 0.28, 0.29 and 0.33 kg/kW.hr respectively at full load. 4.1.3 Exhaust gas temperature Fig. 10 shows the different exhaust gas temperatures with power for B20, B206H2 and varied EGR percentages such as 10%, 20% and 30%. An increment was observed in the EGT when the hydrogen is added at all engine loads. At full load conditions, the B206H2 has an exhaust gas temperature of 348 °C, while it was 312 °C in case of B20. The scenario behind the increased exhaust gas temperature when enriched with hydrogen is the increased combustion rate of hydrogen [33]. There seems to be a low exhaust gas temperature at the time of applying EGR and when there is an increase in the EGR percentage, the former got further reduced [34]. At full load conditions, the exhaust gas temperature was 340 °C for 10% EGR and in case of 30% EGR, it was 315 °C. This might be attributed to the reduction in the temperature due to inlet air dilution and accordingly the presence of low amount of oxygen for combustion and high specific heat of intake air mixture."
9,Emission analysis,"4.2 Emission analysis 4.2.1 HC emission The differences observed in the unburned HC (UHC) emissions with brake power for B20, different EGRrates, 6 lpm H2 enrichment with B20 are illustrated in the Fig. 11 . It can be understood that the emission of hydrocarbons for enriching with hydrogen in the absence of EGR was 110 ppm, whereas for B20 it was120 ppm. For 10% EGR, the HC was 130 ppm and with 30% EGR, it was 145 ppm. The HC emission got decreased with the addition of hydrogentoB20 and air at all engine load conditions. The supplementation of hydrogen into the inlet air led to the homogeneity in mixture, higher flame speed and absence of carbon in hydrogen fuel, thus resulting in the reduction of HC emission [35,36]. Further, there is also another observation that the HC emission got increased with increase in EGR percentage with B206H2 fuel [31,32,34]. The increase in HC is due to low amount of excessively-available oxygen resulting in rich air fuel mixture, slower burning rate and causing more UHC [33,34]. The UHC increased to 9% when the EGR was 10% and 20% when the EGR was 30% at full load. 4.2.2 CO emission Fig. 12 shows the different CO emission rates with engine brake power for B20, varied EGR percentages and B206H2 fuel. The CO emission heavily relies on the air-fuel ratio in accordance to the stoichiometric proportions [21,23]. Since there is no carbon present in hydrogen gas, the CO emission was low when enriched with hydrogen whereas the present emission occurred due to pilot biodiesel (B20) and lube oil. The CO emission was efficiently reduced due to the addition of hydrogen with B20, thanks for wide flammability range and high flame speed of hydrogen gas [33]. The CO emission got increased when the high EGR percentage was introduced [31,32]. When the EGR rate was increased, there was a decrease observed in the reaction speed, O2 concentration and in-cylinder temperature. This weakened the oxidation reaction resulting in more CO emission [34]. It can be observed that the percentage of CO increasedupto30% when the EGR was 40% compared to B206H2 fuel mode at full load. 4.2.3 NOx emission The amount of oxygen in the composition of fuel and the maximum temperature inside the cylinders are the two important factors when it comes to emission of NOx. The NOx emission rate is higher when the combustion temperature and oxygen concentration are higher. The nitrogen and oxygen get converted to NOx in the presence of high combustion temperature that is generated by the burning fuel sprays controlled by local conditions. Being a common term, the NOx denotes nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) [37]. At the time of introducing hydrogen, there was an increase in the temperature due to enhanced combustion rate. This further increased the NOx emission too. Whenever hydrogen is inducted, the above-discussed scenario remains the prominent environmental issue [38,39]. There was an increase observed in NOx emissions when the engine loads were increased, thanks to increased combustion temperature which is illustrated in the Fig. 13 . Various EGR rates were used 10%, 20% and 30%in B206H2 fuel. More EGR rate, diminishes the emission of NOx. However, when the hydrogen is enriched with the fuel, the reaction becomes vice versa whereas the EGR addition reduces the combustion temperature and accordingly reduce the combustion efficiency resulting in lower NOx [32–34]. The percentage of NOx reduction was 20% in case of 30% EGR compared to B206H2 fuel mode without EGR at full load."
10,Combustion analysis,"4.3 Combustion analysis 4.3.1 Cylinder pressure Fig. 14 illustrates the cylinder pressure with regards to crank angle diagrams in all the tested fuels during maximum load conditions. When it comes to diesel engine, the amount of fuel burnt at the time of premixed combustion phase predominantly influences the peak pressure on the combustion rate in the beginning. Both ignition delay period as well as the mixture preparation takes care of the premixed or uncontrolled combustion phase at the time of delay period [40]. Further there was a gradual increase in the pressure inside the cylinder because due to the increased load, the amount of fuel getting burnt also increases. The researchers were able to observe higher peak cylinder pressure for hydrogen-enriched biodiesel fuel, followed by the EGR mode [26,27]. The peak pressure values were 71.12, 69.95, 68.41 and 68.12 bars, for B206 H2, 10% EGR, 20% EGR and 30% EGR respectively at full load. It can be observed that the H2enrichment enables a higher peak pressure compared to other modes. This is due to the enhanced combustion byH2 and reduced ignition delay period. A vital role is played by the addition of EGR and its concentration upon ignition delay period as well as peak pressure. In spite of the fact that there was an increase in the ignition delay period at the time of adding EGR with B20 6H2dual fuel, there was a suppression in the peak pressure development by EGR in the blend [24]. This might be attributed to the reduced flame speed and less oxygen concentration in inlet mixture. 4.3.2 Heat release rate Fig. 15 illustrates the graph for Heat Release Rate (HRR) with crank angle for different percentages of EGR addition with B20H2 dual fuel mode. One can easily note that the highest HRR was 64.2 J/deg. CA for B206H2dualfuel mode compared to 48.22 J/deg. CA for 30% EGR mode. It is proved that there was high amount of heat released when enriched with hydrogen than the addition of EGR. The HRR, during premixed combustion, is held accountable for the high peak pressure [24,41]. There occurs a rapid burning of premixed fuel resulting in the release of humongous heat after which the controlled heat release occurs for hydrogen enrichment. This might be due to the instantaneous combustion (constant volume) that occurs in hydrogen fuel. In EGR operation, the combustion processes work on the basis of spray quality of the pilot biodiesel fuel and the mixing quality of hydrogen and EGR in the cylinder charge. The HRR was lowered by EGR, thanks to dilution effect at the time of premixed combustion phase. This confines the turbulent flame propagation from pilot ignition zones to cylinder charge. It further impacts the heat concentration released at the time of combustion [42]. The HRR for 30% EGR was 49 J/deg.CA whereas in case of B206H2 operation without EGR, it was 65 J/deg.CA. There was a decrease in the HRR with increasing EGR rate."
11,Conclusions,"In the present research work, the effects of EGR addition at the intake port of CNSL biodiesel–hydrogen dual fuel mode operated diesel engine upon parameters such as combustion, performance as well as the exhaust emission characteristics of single cylinder, water-cooled CI engine were investigated. The B20 blends of CNSL-diesel was optimized for maximum BTE and minimum HC and CO emission. The hydrogen gas was introduced via inlet manifold at varied flow rates such as 4 lpm, 6 lpm and 8 lpm with optimized B20 blends. At the end, different percentages of EGR were added in the inlet manifold with optimized B206H2 fuel. The experimental results were concluded with the following observations. • The BTE of hydrogen enriched-CNSL biodiesel (B20) dual fuel engine got increased without the addition of EGR. But the BTE got reduced when EGR was added. The percentage increase of BTE for B206 H2 dual fuel without EGR was 14% compared to 30% EGR mode. • The BSFC got increased in case of higher EGR rate (30%) for H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine. The BSFC for 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% EGR addition were 0.26, 0.28, 0.29 and 0.33 kg/kW.hr respectively at full load. • The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) decreased during EGR addition with H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine. But it got increased in case of H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine without EGR. • The HC and CO emission got increased for EGR addition with H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine at all load conditions. The percentage of increase in the HC emission for 30% EGR was 24% compared to B206H2 dual fuel engine without EGR. The UHC got increased to 9% when the EGR was 10% whereas the former was 20% at 30% EGR at full load. • The NOx emission got increased for H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine, but it got decreased for all the percentages of EGR addition with H2-enriched biodiesel. The percentage of decrease in NOx emission was 20% for 30% EGR compared to0% EGR in H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine • The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate were found to be decreased for EGR addition withH2-enriched CNSL biodiesel compared to B206H2 dual fuel engine at full load condition. • The in-cylinder pressure got decreased for EGR addition compared to B206H2 dual fuel engine. The cylinder pressure for 30% EGR was 68.12 bar whereas for H2-enriched biodiesel operation without EGR, it was 71.2 bar • The HRR got decreased for EGR addition compared to B206H dual fuel engine. The HRR for 30% EGR was 49 J/deg.CA whereas for H2-enriched biodiesel operation without EGR, it was 65 J/deg.CA. On the whole it can be concluded that the H2enrichment with CNSL biodiesel (B20) dual fuel increased the BTE and reduced the HC and CO emissions. At the same time, the NOx emission got increased in the above mode. This NOx emission got reduced when EGR was added with B206H2 dual fuel. But the increase in HC and CO was observed in higher percentages of EGR addition. This can be reduced by adding optimum percentage (10%) of EGR with B206H2 fuel without decreasing the engine performance and increasing the HC and CO emissions."
