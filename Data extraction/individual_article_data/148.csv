0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy plays an increasingly important role in the world energy stage owing to its excellent combustion and pollution-free characteristics [1]. The development of global industrial hydrogen market puts forward a new requirement for large-scale hydrogen production technology. Hydrogen can be obtained by means of various methods including electrolysis or photo-dissociation of water, catalytic reforming and ammonia decomposition [2–5]. Among them, catalytic reforming is regarded as one of the most popular methods for hydrogen production as a result of its abundant fuel sources [6,7]. Nowadays, more than 60% of hydrogen production comes from natural gas [8]. Besides, light alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are easy to handle owing to low toxicity, high capacity, energy density and availability [9–12]. A fixed bed is the most common catalytic reforming reactor for hydrogen production, whereas it suffers from poor heat and mass transfer behavior, high temperature gradient, catalyst sintering, coke deposition and dust jamming. A fluidized bed shows its advantage in the industrial-scale catalytic reforming process because the coke formed could be separated continuously [13]. Khajeh et al. [14] conducted a modelling to compare the fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reformers. It was pointed out that there was a more effective temperature management and fuel conversion in a fluidized bed. Jing et al. [15] experimentally investigated the methane reforming process in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors. It was found that the circulation of catalyst particles between oxidization zone and reduction zone in a fluidized bed favored the inhibition of coke deposition and fuel conversion. Therefore, the introduction of a fluidized bed reactor provides a promising opportunity for the catalytic reforming process. Even though a fluidized bed reactor in the application of hydrogen production appears some advantages, there are still a few challenges [16].The limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium leads to the practical hydrogen output much lower than the theoretical maximum hydrogen yield. High temperature operation increases the cost. The water-gas shift reaction and other side reactions with coke formation hinder the hydrogen yield and purity, which urges the development of the enhancing methods for the fluidized bed catalytic reforming process. Previous literatures reviewed the advantages and perspectives in the industry of the membrane reactor technology for sustainable hydrogen generation via steam reforming of hydrocarbons [17]. It was pointed out that a membrane reactor showed its advantages over a traditional reactor in the filed of hydrogen production from the economic and environmental perspectives. Whereas there are few reviews about the application of fluidized bed membrane reactors in the hydrogen production. In this paper, more attention is paid towards the hydrogen production via a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor. More detail will be discussed on the interaction mechanism of the fluidized bed technology and membrane separation."
1,Hydrogen separation enhanced reforming in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor,"Hydrogen separation via the membrane can overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium constraint and shift the reaction towards the fuel conversion so as to enhance the reforming performance and promote the hydrogen yield [18–21]. Meanwhile, the same hydrogen yield can be obtained under the low operating temperature in a membrane reactor, which means that the external energy input is saved [22,23]. In contrast to a fixed bed, a fluidized bed can hinder the defect of the membrane tube caused by local excessive temperature owing to its uniform temperature distribution [24]. Additionally, gas velocity is enhanced around permeable membranes of a fluidized bed so as to enhance the mass transfer performance between the bed and the permeable membrane. Fewer membrane areas are required in a fluidized bed membrane reactor compared to a packed bed membrane reactor [25,26]. For the autothermal operation, the introduction of membranes helps to reduce the NH3 formation [27]. The serious problems of hot spot temperature and the danger of reactor thermal runaway could be eliminated under the combined effect of oxygen distribution and hydrogen membrane [28]. Therefore, the introduction of a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor undoubtedly provides a promising opportunity for catalytic reforming process [29–32]."
2,Perm-selective membrane,"2.1 Perm-selective membrane 2.1.1 Membrane material Adhikari et al. [33] reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of different hydrogen separation membranes. Hydrogen separation membranes can be divided into organic and inorganic membranes. Although organic (polymer) membranes have some advantages of high pressure drops and low cost, its mechanical strength and high sensitivity to certain chemicals is restrictive. Pd and its alloy membranes as the typical representative of inorganic membranes are usually applied to hydrogen purification and production as a result of good stability under the condition of high temperature [34]. In addition to Pd, some other metals like V, Ta and Nb are also used for hydrogen separation. Although V, Nb and Ta appear a higher hydrogen permeability, their mechanical resistances are low with hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon [35]. Pd alloyed with other metals can overcome a drastic embrittlement phenomenon with a relatively high hydrogen permeability [17]. The thermal and chemical stability can be also improved via alloying Pd [33]. Fernandez et al. [36] experimentally evaluated the characteristic of the metallic supported Pd–Ag membrane for hydrogen separation at high temperature. An ultra-high H2/N2 perm-selectivity of the membrane could be achieved. The major barrier of Pd membranes is the cost of material. The utilization of thin membranes in supports is regarded as an efficient way to reduce the cost. The supports mainly include ceramic and metal supports. Ceramic supports possess high permeability as well as chemical and thermal resistances. Whereas they suffer from poor film adhesion and worse resistance to thermal shock. Metal supports mainly include stainless steel, Ni and TiAl, which has good mechanical and corrosion resistances as well as cheap manufacture cost. The porosity and smoothness of the surface are barriers for metal supports. How to achieve a compromise between a proper adhesion and an adequate film thickness is a key issue [35]. Table 1 displays the hydrogen permeation properties of some Pd-based and its alloy membranes [37–42]. In addition to metal alloys or composite metal membranes, ceramic membranes can achieve a high permeance owing to the fact that hydrogen permeation flux is proportional to the pressure and allow high-temperature operation as a result of its chemically inert property [33]. Adhikari et al. [33] summarized the performance of hydrogen selective ceramic membranes. 2.1.2 Membrane sealing The sealing of membrane layer deposited on the supports plays a critical role in the membrane separation, especially under high temperature condition and in a fluidized bed reactor. High-temperature glazes can be used to seal the end of membrane tube [43–46]. However, it is restrictive in the industrial application owing to additional heat loss, volume loss and membrane defects. The utilization of graphite gasket is regarded as a promising sealing way [47,48], whereas the sealing compression easily induces the mechanical stress of membranes. Fernandez et al. [37] optimized a sealing procedure based on the standard Swagelok and graphite ferrules, which can be used to connect the ceramic supported Pd-based membrane to dense metal tubes. Chen et al. [49] introduced an effective connector with the graphite as sealing material. It was reported that the graphite has no contamination effect on membrane permeability. 2.1.3 Membrane stability Membrane stability plays an important role in the operation of hydrogen separation enhanced reforming process, which is affected by many factors including carbon monoxide poisoning, interaction between catalyst and permeable membrane, abrasion caused by flow particles and dust clogging. During the catalytic reforming process, carbon monoxide as by-product is inevitably produced and blocks the active sites of permeable membrane [50]. Fernandez et al. [37] and Helmi et al. [38] experimentally studied the carbon monoxide poisoning effect in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. It was found that the carbon monoxide poisoning effect depended on the temperature and was more significant under the condition of low temperature. In addition to the carbon monoxide poisoning, Fernandez et al. [37] explored the interaction between catalysts and membranes by means of the element analysis on the membrane surface with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology. It was found that the strong chemical interaction between catalysts and membrane surfaces existed, resulting in the decline of the membrane permeability. Hence, the selectivity of catalyst/support is important. There is no interaction between the alumina or zirconia-based supports and membrane, which can be chosen as catalyst/supports operated in a fluidized bed reactor. Tosto et al. [51] experimentally measured the effect of CO poisoning on the membrane stability. It was demonstrated that there was a sharp reduction of permeance even at very low CO concentration. Additionally, it was found that the membrane morphology suffered from the fluidization. The particle attrition resulted in the reduction of external roughness. In generally, mechanical conditions of a fluidized bed reactor are worse than those of a fixed bed reactor owing to the violent particle movement. High-velocity particles can crash the permeable membrane so as to result in a sharp deterioration of the performance, especially when turbulent or fast fluidization states are applied. Arratibel et al. [52,53] experimentally tested the stability of the Pd–Ag membrane with the porous ceramic protective layer in a fluidized bed membrane reactor with glass pellets as the flow medium. It was pointed out that the porous layer was removed by the violent particle collision, as shown in Fig. 1 [52]. Moreover, the addition of a porous protective layer to the Pd–Ag layer could improve the membrane stability under fluidization condition. During the reaction process, the dust is usually accumulated on the membrane surface to form a coating, leading to the membrane pollution and decline of permeation rate, which can be alleviated by the violent particle motion in a fluidized bed. Wang et al. [54] explored the effect of the flow medium spherical degree on the membrane pollution efficiency with micron grade particles as particulate pollutants, where the high-speed camera was employed to capture local hydrodynamic parameters (particle velocity, particle rotation speed, particle contact area). The results showed that the alleviating effect on membrane pollution was significant with smaller particles when the high spherical flow media was applied. In addition, the increase of particle velocity was not conducive to local membrane pollution mitigation for flow medium with high sphericity. 2.1.4 Membrane arrangement In a fluidized bed membrane reactor, membrane arrangement mainly includes coated wall membrane and immersed membrane. For wall membranes, more membrane areas are required for large-scale hydrogen production so as to increase the cost. Immersed membranes are usually divided into vertical membranes, horizontal membranes and oblique membranes. Nowadays, vertical immersed mode is widely applied to separate the hydrogen for its simple structure and relatively weak membrane abrasion caused by particle collision [55]. However, part of catalyst particles are entrained up to the freeboard zone. Voncken et al. [56] implemented the two-fluid model to evaluate mass transfer behaviors in gas-solid fluidized beds with horizontally immersed membranes, where hydrogen separation was considered via an implementation of membrane source terms in the computational cells adjacent to a membrane boundary, as shown in Fig. 2 [56]. The source terms was expressed as follows [56]: (1) ∂ ∂ t ( α g ρ g Y H 2 ) + ∇ ⋅ ( α g ρ g u g Y H 2 ) = ∇ ⋅ [ α g ρ g D H 2 ∇ Y H 2 ] + S m (2) S m = A c V c Q m M w , H 2 [ ( X H 2 ret p t o t ) n - ( X H 2 p e r m p t o t ) n ] The velocity condition normal to the membrane surface was imposed [56]: (3) u m = S m R T p M w , H 2 V c A c The results revealed that large distance between wall and membrane could lead to the gas bypassing. In-line tube bank configuration suffered from gas channeling and decreased the hydrogen permeance. Yang et al. [57] numerically investigated erosion behaviors of membrane tubes in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. The results showed that the membrane tube erosion could be weakened with hydrogen removal. There was a severe membrane wear at the region between wall and bed center. de Jong et al. [58] developed a novel hybrid IBM-DPM model and numerically investigated the effect of membrane arrangement on the hydrodynamics. It was found that the reduction of bubble size with horizontal membrane tubes was more significant than that with vertical membranes. Helmi et al. [59] conducted experiments to evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior of a fluidized bed reactor with vertically immersed membranes and examined the membrane location effect. The results revealed that solids fluxes strongly depended on membrane sites. Medrano et al. [60] evaluated the effect of gas pockets in the vicinities of membranes immersed in fluidized beds by means of the experimental and numerical study. It was reported that gas pockets attached to the membranes reduced the effective contact area with the emulsion phase and had an important mass transfer limitation. Helmi et al. [61] experimentally studied the hydrodynamics of membrane-assisted fluidized beds using X-ray analysis and examined the effect of membrane spacer. It was concluded that the reduction of the distance between the spacers was beneficial to promote the membrane lifetime."
3,Fluidization with membrane separation,"2.2 Fluidization with membrane separation 2.2.1 Fluidization regime The performance in a fluidized bed membrane reactor depends on fluidization regime in the reactor. In general, bubbling fluidization, turbulent fluidization and fast fluidization are selected as the reforming reactor. Roses et al. [62] carried out an experimental study of steam methane reforming and reported that the bed-to-membrane mass transfer limitation could be reduced owing to the bubble motion. Mahecha-Botero et al. [63] evaluated the methane reforming performance in a fluidized bed under different fluidization regimes via a simplified equilibrium model. The predictions showed that the hydrogen yields under fast fluidization and turbulent fluidization were superior to that under bubbling fluidization owing to the inhibition of mass transfer resistance by the violent mixing between gas and particles. 2.2.2 Reforming fuel For the reforming for hydrogen production in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed, different fuels are used. The methane steam reforming is the major hydrogen production method. Mahecha-Botero et al. [24] experimentally studied the hydrogen production process operated under steam methane reforming condition in a fluidized-bed membrane reactor. A high permeate purity of 99.994% with a H2/CH4 yield of 3.03 was achieved via the full complement of membrane panels. Ethanol reforming is regarded as one kind of the sustainable method for hydrogen production owing to its availability from the biomass fermentative process. Spallina et al. [39] evaluated the ethanol auto-thermal reforming for hydrogen production. It was reported that the EtOH conversion at the reactor outlet reached above 99.9%, implying that the system was at the thermodynamic equilibrium. The naphtha as the common liquid hydrocarbon feedstock for hydrogen production is preferred for reforming process. Rakib et al. [31] investigated the performance of heptane steam reforming in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. The heptane conversion exceeded 99% and the hydrogen purity of 99.99% could be achieved from individual membrane panels. Meanwhile, the steam reforming of propane in a fluidized bed membrane reactor was experimentally studied. It was reported that high-purity hydrogen (∼99.99%hydrogen) was produced from each membrane panel with a high hydrogen yield under a relatively low temperature [21]. 2.2.3 Sweep gas The hydrogen is separated from the reaction side to the permeate side and removed by means of the sweep gas or vacuum pump. The hydrogen permeation flux depends on the permeation driving force or pressure difference between the two sides of membrane, which can be improved by increasing the sweep gas velocity and reducing the absolute pressure of the vacuum pump. Foresti et al. [64] evaluated the effect of permeation methods on the reforming performance and design parameters via the simulations of a 5 kW micro-cogeneration system with bioethanol as fuel. The results demonstrated that the net electrical efficiency of sweep gas was higher while the membrane area was low than that using the vacuum pump. Abashar et al. [65,66] simulated the methane steam reforming in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor. The effect of cocurrent and countercurrent configurations on the reforming performance was examined. It was pointed out that the countercurrent configuration was superior to the cocurrent mode without the limitation of reactor height. In addition, the fuel conversion rate was sensitive to the pressure in the reaction side of the countercurrent configuration. For the cocurrent configuration, the effect of membrane thickness on the methane conversion rate was more significant. Chen et al. [67] compared the hydrogen partial pressures in the reaction side and permeate side to explain the fact that the countercurrent configuration was superior via a kinetic model simulation. The increase of hydrogen partial pressure in the permeate side along the axial height led to a rapid decreasing pressure difference, which always existed in the countercurrent mode. This implied that the countercurrent arrangement could maximize the permeation driving force. Foresti et al. [68] developed a comprehensive model of a fluidized bed membrane reactor and evaluated the impact of sweep gas. It was pointed out that the slow gas diffusion in the thick supports of membrane could cause a higher hydrogen partial pressure at the membrane interface than that in the bulk so as to hinder the sweep gas effect. Although the sweep gas is often used to improve the driving force for membrane permeation in experimental studies, the application of sweep gas in the practical process is limited owing to the fact that the gas mixture formation caused by sweep gas increases the additional cost of gas separation [69]. Nordio et al. [70] evaluated the impact of sweep gas on hydrogen permeation of supported Pd membranes by means of experiment and modeling. It was suggested that the driving force of the permeation was reduced with the presence of stagnant sweep gas in the pores of the membrane support owing to the reduction of the hydrogen diffusion through the support. Pinacci et al. [71] pointed out that the effect of sweep gas flow on H2 partial pressure in the permeate side was restrictive as a result of the change of the diffusion resistance of the support. 2.2.4 Bubble-to-emulsion mass transfer A phenomenological reactor model was developed to investigate the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol in a fluidized bed membrane reactor [72], where the bubble phase gas was assumed to be in plug flow and the gas in the emulsion was considered to be completely mixed in each section. The overall conversion equations of bubble and emulsion are summarized in Table 2 [72]. It was pointed out that the bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer limitations reduced the effectiveness of separation and required more membrane areas. 2.2.5 Densified zone formation Local high particle concentration areas (densified zones) are formed near the membrane with hydrogen separation, as shown in Fig. 3 [73]. It can be seen that the formation of densified zone results in the bubble moving towards the bed center. The bubble coalescence is more obvious, which hinders the gas-solid contact so as to influence the reforming performance and hydrogen production. Wassie et al. [74] experimentally studied the densified zone formation in a pseudo-2D membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor by means of the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technology. In order to identify the densified zone, a criterion was set on the particle velocity as follows [74]: (4) − γ ≤ v i ≤ γ where v i was the local instantaneous particle velocity and γ was the threshold value, which was based on some sample histogram profiles derived from a sensitivity analysis. Dang et al. [75] experimentally investigated the solids circulation and densified zone distribution in a micro-structured fluidized bed membrane reactor using PIV and Digital Image Analysis (DIA).The densified zone extent was quantified as [75]: (5) E = ∑ A d e n s i f i e d z o n e s A t o t a l where A densified zones represented the area with the solid hold-up above the threshold value. It was pointed out that the densified zone could be reduced via the turbulent fluidization regime. Yang et al. [76] reported that low pressure of permeate side could enlarge the scope of densified zone and reduce the hydrogen yield via numerical simulation. Julián et al. [77] compared the effect of membrane arrangement on densified zone formation in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor via the two-fluid model. The dense zone location depended on membrane sites. The wall membrane could lead to a wider densified zone compared to the immersed membrane. Tan et al. [78,79] implemented discrete particle simulations of micro membrane-assisted fluidized beds with hydrogen extraction. The results showed that the densified zones close to membranes became more significant with the increase of gas extraction velocity, which was detrimental for gas-solid contact and bed-to-membrane mass transfer. Dang et al. [80] carried out a gas back-mixing study in a membrane-assisted micro-structured fluidized bed using a combined PIV/DIA technique. It was demonstrated that the utilization of large particle could reduce the densified zone formation and inhibit the gas back-mixing."
4,Concentration polarization,"2.3 Concentration polarization During the membrane hydrogen separation process, other gas components are continuously accumulated near the membrane surface so as to form a high concentration. Under the action of concentration gradient, the gas diffusion from the membrane surface to the fluid bulk will occur, resulting in the formation of boundary layers, named concentration polarization [81]. When the hydrogen permeability of membrane is enough high, the concentration polarization resistance will become the main resistance for the mass transfer of hydrogen permeation through the membrane. From the study of Lüdtke et al. [82], the resistance in the boundary layer exceeded the separation layer resistance under the condition of high pressure. Mori et al. [83] conducted an experimental evaluation of concentration polarization effect in a membrane reactor and pointed out that optimizing the reactor configuration such as the installation of baffle plates could reduce the concentration polarization effect. Fernandez et al. [37] experimentally evaluated the concentration polarization resistance in a fluidized bed reactor. It was shown that decreasing the inlet hydrogen concentration could lead to the decline of hydrogen permeation flux with the same inlet hydrogen permeation driving force and the mass transfer restriction of concentration polarization film was confirmed. Compared to the empty reactor, the concentration polarization of a fluidized bed was weakened. Helmi et al. [84] carried out a quantitative study of hydrogen concentration distribution in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor via the multi-fluid model. The concentration polarization phenomenon was simplified as the mass transfer boundary. It was reported that the performance of fluidized bed membrane reactors was significantly influenced by concentration polarization when integrating highly permeable membranes. de Nooijer et al. [85] established a one-dimensional fluidized bed reactor model to conduct a simulation of biogas reforming process in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. It was found that the film layer description in the model could well describe the effect of concentration polarization in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. Voncken et al. [86] evaluated the effect of vertically immersed membrane on the basis of the two-fluid model, where membrane separation was considered via a sink term. It was pointed out that there existed the interaction between the concentration polarization zones of multiple membranes. The closely packed membranes competed for hydrogen. Concentration polarization coefficient (CPC) of Caravella et al. [87] was introduced to characterize the local concentration polarization degree, expressed as below: (6) CPC = 1 - ∆ P H 2 M e m b r a n e ∆ P H 2 B u l k where P H 2 , b u l k and P H 2 , m e m b r a n e represented the hydrogen partial pressure in the bulk and around the membrane. Yang et al. [88] employed the two-fluid model to evaluate the membrane site effect on the CPC in a fluidized bed reactor.It was exhibited that the concentration polarization could be hindered with the arrangement of internal membrane."
5,Integration of hydrogen permeation and carbon dioxide sorption technology,"Carbon dioxide sorption is regarded as an efficient enhanced-reforming approach for high-purity hydrogen production. On one hand, gas product carbon dioxide is removed so as to improve the hydrogen purity. On the other hand, additional heat can be provided for the reforming reaction owing to the exothermic carbon dioxide sorption reaction [89]. Therefore, the integrated technology of hydrogen membrane permeation and carbon dioxide in-situ sorption as well as its application in the catalytic reforming process have attracted researchers’ interests [90].Andrés et al. [91] experimentally studied the effect of hydrogen permeation and carbon dioxide sorption on the methane steam reforming performance in a pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor, as shown in Fig. 4 [91]. It was reported that the molar ratio of permeable hydrogen and feed methane could exceed 1.9. The produced hydrogen purity exceeded 99.99% via in-situ carbon dioxide capture [91]. Gallucciet et al. [92] simulated the methane autothermal reforming in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor with CO2 capture via a phenomenological model and evaluated the effect of a series of operating parameters on the reforming performance. It was stated that the fuel conversion and hydrogen recovery with this integrated enhancing method were higher than those without the membrane technology. Chen et al. [93] established a simplified mathematical model to simulate the sorption-enhanced methane reforming process in a fluidized bed membrane reactor and further analyzed the influence of particle size, sorption rate and membrane effective factor on the reforming performance. The results showed that the outlet carbon dioxide concentration with the integrated method was higher than that with single carbon dioxide in-situ sorption. In addition, it was pointed out that the methane conversion rate was very sensitive to the effective factor of membrane. When the membrane effective factor was small, the sorption rate was very important in the reduction of carbon monoxide emission. The introduction of sorbent influences the flow characteristic of a fluidized bed reactor. Di Carlo et al. [94] employed the Eulerian-Eulerian model to examine the sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming process. It was observed that the addition of sorbent removed carbon dioxide from the rising bubbles, resulting in the increase of outgoing gas composition oscillations. Meanwhile, when the discrepancy of particle size or density of catalyst and sorbent was evident, the particle segregation phenomenon appeared in the reactor. The catalytic reaction and sorption reaction in different regions hindered the mass transfer of carbon dioxide from catalysts to sorbents [95]. Yang et al. [96] implemented a numerical simulation to examine the influence of carbon dioxide sorption on concentration polarization in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed. The results demonstrated that the concentration polarization resistance could be weakened with carbon dioxide sorption. Meanwhile, the coupling of membrane separation and carbon dioxide sorption at low temperature was evaluated using hydrotalcite as sorbent [97]. It was reported that a high hydrogen yield could be achieved under low temperature operation via the enhancing ways of hydrogen removal and carbon dioxide sorption. Chen et al. [98] experimentally investigated CO2 reforming of methane in a fixed-bed/fluidized-bed. It was found that in the fluidized-bed operation, carbon accumulation could be suppressed and part of deposited coke could be removed."
6,Coupling of hydrogen separation and oxygen introduction,"In order to overcome the inefficiency of heat supply to endothermic reforming reactions and inhibit the coke formation, oxygen is successfully introduced into a fluidized bed for oxidative reforming (or partial oxidation) so that the auto-thermal condition can be achieved [99,100]. To attain an increase in reaction rate and catalyst regeneration, a novel circulating fast fluidization-bed membrane reformer (CFFBMR) was suggested [101,102], as shown in Fig. 5 [101], where hydrogen separation membrane and oxygen addition membrane were simultaneously introduced into a fluidize bed reactor. A simplified mathematical model was established to investigate the reforming performance of methane and heptane in a combined fluidized bed membrane reactor [103,104]. There was a descending temperature near the inlet at a lower oxygen supply rate. Meanwhile, a hot spot near the inlet appeared when the supply rate was excessive owing to the heat released by the oxidative reforming. Therefore, a reasonable control of oxygen permeation rate is a key to optimize the performance of the combined membrane reactor. Chen et al. [105] reported that coke deposition was enhanced with hydrogen permselective membranes as a result of the shift of the reversible methane cracking reaction to coke formation based on a catalyst deactivation model. Prasad et al. [106] conducted a modeling study and stated that the low flux of membrane especially at lower temperature limited the oxygen introduction. Patil et al. [107,108] designed another type of a combined membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor for high-purity hydrogen production with light hydrocarbon as fuel, consisting of two membrane-assisted fluidized beds, as shown in Fig. 6 [107]. The hydrogen separation membrane was located at the upper reactor, while the oxygen addition membrane was set at the bottom. The autothermic operation with a high fuel conversion and hydrogen yield could be achieved with a low catalyst load. In addition, the temperature in these two zones could be effectively controlled to achieve an optimum reforming performance by adjusting the feed ratio of the bottom to the top zone. Dehkordi et al. [109] developed a compartment model to describe flow patterns of a membrane-assisted fluidized bed under the bubbling fluidization regime for the methane reforming process with the introduction of oxygen. It was pointed out that there existed an optimum oxygen-to-methane ratio to achieve the favorable hydrogen production. Durán et al. [110] experimentally evaluated the methane dry reforming in a two-zone fluidized bed reactor with membrane, where the regeneration of catalyst could be achieved via an oxidizing stream. It was stated that the oxygen introduction favored coke combustion. Whereas an excess of oxygen could result in the oxidation of metallic active phase of catalyst."
7,Conclusion and future prospect,"Catalytic steam reforming is a promising large-scale hydrogen production method, whereas it suffers from low hydrogen yield and purity as well as carbon dioxide emission. A high hydrogen production efficiency can be achieved via a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor. Recent studies about catalytic reforming process in a membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor can be synthesized as below: (1) Membrane selectivity is a key for hydrogen-separation enhanced-reforming process. Considering the stability and cost, some metallic supported composite membrane materials are promising in the application of hydrogen separation. Pd-based and its alloy membranes are the dominant materials in the membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor. The development of membrane material is still one of core issues for the enhanced-reforming hydrogen production process. The comprehensive consideration of membrane permeability and selectivity, thermal and chemical resistance as well as the fabrication cost to meet the industrial needs is required. (2) Membrane stability depends on many factors like carbon monoxide poisoning, interaction between catalyst and permeable membrane, abrasion caused by flow particles and dust clogging. Besides membrane material, the selection of catalysts is another determining factor. There exists a strong chemical interaction between catalyst and membrane surface. A good matching relationship of catalyst and membrane is a prerequisite for highly efficient hydrogen production. The alumina or zirconia-based supports has no interaction with membrane, which may be a good choice as catalyst/supports operated in a fluidized bed reactor. (3) The arrangement of membrane site in a fluidized bed reactor greatly influences the reforming performance. Considering the membrane abrasion caused by particle collision, vertical immersed mode is usually suggested for hydrogen separation. From the view of fluidization regimes, the hydrogen yields under fast fluidization and turbulent fluidization are superior to that under bubbling fluidization owing to the inhibition of mass transfer resistance. Whereas the improvement of hydrogen yield under the turbulent fluidization is at the cost of membrane lifetime reduction caused by membrane wear. How to balance the hydrogen production efficiency and the economy cost is essential. Although sweep gas can increase the driving force of hydrogen permeation in experimental studies, the application of sweep gas in the practical process is limited owing to the additional cost of gas separation and the diffusion resistance of the support. The mass transfer limitation becomes remarkable in presence of sweep gas. The tradeoff between membrane permeance and mass transfer limitation as well as mechanical stability is an another key issue. (4) The reforming performance in a fluidized bed membrane reactor will cause two key issues. One is densified zone formation. Hydrogen membrane separation produces a local high particle concentration zone so as to hinder the gas-solid contact. There is a wider range of densified zones for wall membrane compared to immersed membrane. The utilization of large particles can weaken the densified zone formation. The other issue is concentration polarization. Membrane hydrogen separation leads to concentration gradients of gas components so as to influence the gas diffusion and increase the hydrogen transfer resistance. The installation of baffle plates is beneficial to hinder the concentration polarization effect. For the densified zone and concentration polarization caused by membrane separation, a reasonable arrangement of membrane sites and the optimization of the fluidization bed reactor such as component installation is meaningful. (5) To achieve the auto-thermal condition of reforming system, the coupling technologies of hydrogen separation and other processes have been developed, including carbon dioxide sorption and oxygen introduction. A high-purity hydrogen can be obtained and concentration polarization resistance is weakened with carbon dioxide sorption. Moreover, the oxygen introduction favors the coke combustion. Whereas the control of oxygen amount is an important problem. Excessively oxygen introduction results in the oxidation of metallic active phase of catalyst and hot spot formation. The thermal management of the combined system becomes urged."
