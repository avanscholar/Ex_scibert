0,Introduction,"Nowadays, biomass valorization is one of the most interesting research topics in the context of sustainable chemistry [1]. Biomass can be used as an energy source [2–4]. There is, however a unique feature of biomass as compared to other renewable energy sources: it can also provide chemicals [5–7]. Furfural and furfural derivatives are among the so-called platform molecules obtained from biomass which can be used for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels [8,9]. Furfural selective hydrogenation can lead to furfuryl alcohol, which has important applications in the production of resins, fibers or as a solvent, just to cite some of them [10,11]. Copper-based solids are the most widely used catalysts for furfural hydrogenation into furfuryl alcohol [10,11], though some other non-noble (Fe, Co, Ni) [12–14] or noble metals (Pt, Pd, Au, Ru) [15–18] have also been described. Hydrogenation is normally conducted using molecular hydrogen. Nevertheless, carbonyl groups can also be reduced to the corresponding alcohol through hydrogen transfer from an alcohol (the so-called Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley, MPV, reaction) [19–21]. The process, traditionally conducted in the homogeneous phase using aluminium alkoxides as the catalysts, has also been successfully described in the heterogeneous phase using a wide range of solids such as magnesia or zirconia [22–27]. In the present piece of research different zirconium-based systems were obtained through the microemulsion technique. For comparative purposes, the solids were also synthesized through conventional sol-gel process. The systems were tested for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol using propan-2-ol as the hydrogen donor (MPV process)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chloroform anhydrous ≥99% (Ref. 288306-2L), 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane anhydrous 99.8% (36006-1L), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) ≥98% (H5882-500G), 1-Butanol (360465-2.5L), ethanol (02860-2.5L), ammonium hydroxide solution (0.1N) (318620-2L), zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate (346462), furfural (185914) and furfuryl alcohol (185930) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium hydroxide solution (5.0N) (318612-2L) and hydrochloric acid solution (318949-2L) were purchased from Fluka analytical. Milli-Q water was used for preparation of solutions."
3,Synthesis of the solids,"2.2 Synthesis of the solids 2.2.1 Precipitation method (P series) A 0.4M zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate solution was dropwise added to a 200mL solution of NH4OH (pH 10, prepared from NH4OH 5N). pH 10 was kept during the whole process adding NH4OH 5N or HCl 0.2M using a Syrris Atlas pump, with constant agitation (500rpm). Once the addition had finished, typically after 1h, the solution was aged overnight. Then the white precipitate was filtered and dried overnight at 120°C. Afterwards, the solid was calcined at the desired temperature (200, 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700°C) for four hours with a temperature ramp of 5°C/min under synthetic air flow (50mL/min). Finally, the solids were ground and sieved (particle size <0.149mm). The nomenclature used for the solids was P-Zr-X, where X indicates the calcination temperature. 2.2.2 Microemulsion method (ME series) For the synthesis of zirconium systems through reverse (water in oil) microemulsion, two microemulsion systems, ME1 and ME2, for NH4OH and the Zr precursor, respectively, were prepared. Under optimized conditions, the composition of microemulsions (ME) was surfactant: CTAB (15wt%), oil: 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (53%), co-surfactant: butan-1-ol (12%), water solution: 20wt%. In the case of ME1, water solution contained 5M NH4OH whereas for ME2 0.4M ZrO(NO3)2 · xH2O was used. Similarly as for precipitation method, ME2 was dropwise added to ME1 at a stirring rate of 500rpm. In order to ensure complete precipitation of zirconium precursor, the used amount of NH4OH was three times that stoichiometrically required. Once both microemulsions had been mixed, a white precipitate was observed, which was kept aging overnight under constant agitation. The precipitate was then filtered and divided into two parts. One portion was washed 5 times with 200mL of a 50/50% chloroform/ethanol mixture, with the intention to remove the residual surfactant. The solid was then dried in an oven at 120°C overnight. The other portion was directly dried in an oven at 120°C overnight without washing. The rest of the preparation procedure was analogous to that described for the precipitation method: after the drying process, all solids were calcined at the desired temperature (200, 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700°C) for 4h (ramp temperature of 5°C/min under 50mL/min synthetic flow). Catalyst nomenclature is ME-Zr-X- Y were X denotes the calcination temperature and Y whether the solid was washed (W) or unwashed (UW)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA–DTA) were performed on a Setaram SetSys 12 instrument. An amount of 20mg of sample was placed in an alumina crucible and heated at temperatures from 30 to 1000°C at a rate of 10°C/min under a stream of synthetic air at 50mL/min in order to measure weight loss, heat flow and derivative weight loss. Surface areas of the solids were determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 instrument, using the Brunnauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. All samples were degassed to 0.1Pa at 120°C prior to measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM 1400 microscope. All samples were mounted on 3mm holey carbon copper grids. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of all catalysts were performed on a Siemens D-5000 X-Ray diffractometer using a cobalt source, Co Kα, and a graphite monochromator. The voltage and current intensity were 20kV and 25mA, respectively. Scans were performed at 0.05° intervals over the 2θ range from 10° to 70°. Surface acidity in the catalysts were determined by thermal programmed desorption (TPD) of a pre-adsorbed probe molecule, pyridine (Py) monitored by TCD. An amount of 50mg of sample was placed under a He stream flowing at 75mL/min in a reactor 10mm in diameter that was placed inside an oven. He stream was used to clean the solids by heating to 350°C (200°C in the case of solids calcined at 200°C) at a rate of 10°C/min and then cooling to 50°C. At that point, the surface of the solid was saturated with the Py for 30min. Pyridine was supplied by bubbling the He stream through liquid pyridine at room temperature over the samples. After saturation, excess physisorbed Py was removed increasing the temperature up to 50°C and passing a He stream at 75mL/min for 60min. Then temperature was increased up to 400°C (200°C in the case of solids calcined at 200°C) at 10°C/min, holding the final level for 30min. Desorbed pyridine was quantified against a calibration graph previously constructed from variable injected volumes of pyridine. Additionally, Raman analyses of solids pre-saturated with pyridine were performed in order to determine the type of surface acid sites. First the solids were cleaned by heating up until 120°C during 30min under nitrogen flow. Then temperature was cooled down to 50°C and the pyridine was saturated for 1h. Physisorbed pyridine was removed by heating up to 120°C for 1h under nitrogen flow. Finally, the Raman spectra were recorded at 300mW using a portable Raman spectrometer EZRaman-N series 785-B, (Manufactured by TSI, Irvine CA, USA) with an excitation laser of 785nm."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests The solids were tested for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol using propan-2-ol as the hydrogen donor. Catalytic test were conducted in two reaction systems: 2.4.1 Multi-reactor (conventional thermal heating) A Carrusel Reaction Station TM multi-reactor (Radley Discovery Technologies) with twelve 50mL vials was used. The reaction mixture consisted in 1mL furfural, 9mL isopropanol and 50mg catalyst. Temperature and stirring rate were adjusted at 100°C and 1000rpm, respectively. The top part of the vials was always refrigerated at 5°C thus preventing lost in the reaction volume as a result of evaporation. 2.4.2 Microwave oven Microwave assisted reactions were carried out in a computer-controlled CEM Discover microwave reactor. Reactions were performed in a closed 10mL vial at 100°C, with a maximum pressure of 200 psi. The reaction mixture consisted in 0.5mL furfural, 2.0mL isopropanol and 25mg catalyst (i.e. same substrate/catalyst ratio as for conventional heating). After the reactions, the solids were filtered using a PTFE syringe filter 0.45μm and the liquid phase was analyzed by gas chromatography, GC-FID (Agilent Technologies 7890, with a Supelcowax-10 capillary column) with confirmation by GC–MS (CP-3800 Gas Chromatograph connected to a Varian 1200 QuadrupoleMS). Quantification of furfural and furfuryl alcohol was performed using the corresponding calibration curves."
6,Results and discussion,"TGA-DTA profiles of P-Zr, ME-Zr-W and ME-Zr-UW gels are represented in Fig. 1 . From that figure it is evident that weight loss is significantly higher in the case of ME series, especially for the unwashed system, due to the presence of surfactant (weight losses percentages of 17.0, 36.9 and 72.5%, for P-Zr, ME-Zr-W and ME-Zr-UW, respectively). As for the heat flow profiles, in the case of P-Zr (Fig. 1A), there are two main peaks. The first endothermic peak centered at ca. 106°C corresponds to the loss of water whereas the sharp exothermal peak at ca. 453°C (the so-called glow exotherm) is attributed to the crystallization of zirconia [24,28]. For solids synthesized through microemulsion method, combustion of CTAB (which occurs in the 300–550°C for pure CTAB, see dotted line in Fig. 1C) tends to mask the glow exotherm, though it can be seen at 477°C in ME-Zr-W solid (Fig. 1B) thus evidencing that zirconia crystallization is retarded in the presence of the surfactant. Fig. 2 represents the evolution of surface area (as determined by the BET method) as a function of the calcination temperature of the solids. Results are consistent with TG-DTA profiles: for calcination temperatures below 200°C, BET surface area of the solids of ME series are very low as compared to P-Zr system as a result of the presence of a high amount of surfactant. As the temperature rises, zirconia crystallizes which results in BET area dropping. However, in the 200–400°C range, the catalysts synthesized through microemulsion, especially unwashed solids, exhibit higher BET area values than those of the P series which can be ascribed to the retardation in zirconia crystallization evidenced in the heat flow profile of Fig. 1B. All in all, the highest surface areas (200–250m2/g) correspond to solids synthesized in the 200–300°C range. BET isotherms (see Fig. S1A) are of the H2b type according to IUPAC nomenclature [29], associated to mesoporous materials. In fact, average pore sizes are in the 3–9nm for P-Zr and ME-Zr W solids, whereas ME-Zr UW systems exhibited larger pores (4–15nm). (Fig. S1B). Pore sizes are smaller for lower calcination temperatures. Nevertheless, they are always in the range of mesopores whereas furfural molecular size is 5.7Å (0.57nm) which ensures the absence of diffusion problems [30,31]. XRD patterns (Fig. 3 ) evidenced that solids calcined at temperatures below 400°C are amorphous and confirmed the retardation in the crystallization in the presence of residual surfactant. From TEM micrographs (Fig. S2), it seems that the presence of CTAB also resulted in more separation between particles. Moreover, crystallite particle size, as determined from XRD through Scherrer equation, is significant lower for the microemulsion method as compared to conventional sol-gel precipitation (Fig. 3). At 400 and 500°C zirconia is present in the tetragonal phase mainly (JCPDS Card No. 42-1164) whereas subsequent calcination at 700°C results in monoclinic (JCPDS Card No. 37-1484) being the predominant phase for P-Zr and ME-Zr-W solids. On the contrary, tetragonal is still the major phase in ME-Zr 700UW system which suggests that surfactant could somehow contribute to the stabilization of such a phase on calcination. Determination of the surface acidity of the solids is difficult, especially at the lowest calcination temperatures, since catalysts structure of hydrous zirconia can vary under experimental conditions and the presence of surfactant in the ME series can interfere in the measurement. Nevertheless, in order to have a comparison of acidity of solids, pyridine TPD profiles of the systems calcined at 200, 400, 500 and 700°C were recorded (Fig. 4 ). All three series present quite similar acidities which in the case of solids calcined at 400°C correspond to 250, 217 and 237μmol py/g for P-Zr 400, ME-Zr 400W and ME-Zr 400UW, respectively. Additionally, some Raman spectra of pre-adsorbed pyridine were recorded (Fig. S3). Liquid pyridine exhibits a Raman band at ca. 990cm−1 (symmetric ring breathing), the position of this band being sensitive to the interaction with the catalyst surface through hydrogen bonds (996–1008cm−1) or chemisorption at Brönsted (1007–1015cm−1) or Lewis acid sites (1018–1028cm−1) [32]. From Fig. S3, it is evident that P-Zr-200 solid exhibits such hydrogen bonds or Brönsted sites. For solids obtained through microemulsion, their colored nature made the analysis difficult though in the case of ME-Zr-200UW those signals seem to be present."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.1 Catalytic activity Initially, solids were tested for selective reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol in the multi-reactor system under conventional heating. Results achieved for solids calcined at 120, 300, 500 and 700°C are summarized in Fig. 5 expressed as conversion, selectivity to furfuryl alcohol (FA) and furfuryl alcohol yield after 3, 6 and 20h. The main by-product identified by GC–MS was a C13 compound resulting from the condensation of acetone with two furfural molecules [25]. In the absence of a standard, the response factor was calculated considering the so-called effective carbon number [33]. In general, conversion values decrease with calcination temperature. This is especially dramatic in the case of P-Zr solids which are not active at temperatures ≥500°C whereas ME-Zr W and ME-Zr UW still exhibit some conversion. The generally accepted mechanism for MPV reaction on hidrous zirconia is represented in Fig. 6 A [24,27]. As can be seen, surface OH groups play an important role in the reaction as anchoring groups for propan-2-ol which adsorbs onto OH groups as 2-propoxide via dehydration. As calcination temperature rises, the number of surface OH groups decreases thus resulting in a drop in conversion. The presence of surfactant retards ZrO2 crystallization and consequently surface dehydration thus accounting for the observed higher activity in ME series at high temperatures as compared to P-Zr solids. It is also worth noting that solids synthesized through microemulsion technique exhibit higher selectivity to furfuryl alcohol than those obtained by conventional sol-gel method, especially at low calcination temperatures. Meric et al. [34] studied chemoselective reduction of citral on supported paladium systems synthesized through the microemulsion method. The authors reported a change in product selectivity (citronellal or dihydrocitronellal) depending on palladium being under microemulsion conditions or outside the microemulsion. The authors explained the differences in terms of the specific environment of the “micelle enclosed” Pd particles. The steric hindrance of the citral molecule by the surfactant molecules adsorbed on the Pd particle favored the interaction through the CO group. This could also be the case in our work, and explain the high selectivity observed to furfuryl alcohol (Fig. 6B). An excessive amount of surfactant could be detrimental to the adsorption, thus accounting for the higher selectivity to FA observed on ME-Zr 120W as compared to ME-Zr 120UW. For ME solids, calcination results in the progressive loss of the surfactant, thus resulting in a drop in selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. All in all, the highest furfuryl alcohol yields obtained at this first screening corresponded to ME-Zr 120UW (21.8% yield to FA at 24.7% conversion for t=20h). From this first screening it is evident that the most active solids are those calcined at low temperatures. In principle, in order to conduct selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol on hydrous zirconia, the optimum catalysts to achieve a high conversion should be those with a high density of surface OH groups and exhibiting a relatively high surface area. In this sense, the calcination temperature of 200°C could be a good choice since all three systems (P-Zr-200, ME-Zr-200UW and ME-Zr-W 200) are still amorphous (Fig. 3) and exhibit surface areas in the 213–232m2/g range (Fig. 2). Moreover, selectivity to FA could be enhanced by the presence of a certain amount of the surfactant which has not been completely eliminated (evidenced by TG-DTA in Fig. 1). Catalytic results obtained for solids calcined at 200°C in the multi-reactor system are summarized in Fig. 7 . As can be seen, despite exhibiting similar BET surface areas, conversion values follow the sequence ME-Zr 200UW>ME-Zr 200W>P-Zr 200 which is also that expected considering that ME retards crystallization and thus results in more surface OH groups. As for the selectivity, again, the system synthesized by microemulsion but with a lower amount of surfactant as a result of the washing (ME-Zr-200W) exhibits the highest values (ca. 98%) whereas solids obtained by conventional sol-gel method (P-Zr 200) or containing a larger amount of surfactant (ME-Zr 200UW) present selectivities in the 70–89% range. Yields to FA on the solids synthesized by the microemulsion method are ca. 53–57% after 120h of reaction. Some additional studies were performed doubling the catalyst/substrate ratio which resulted in conversion rate almost being doubled whereas selectivity to furfuryl alcohol remained almost the same (e.g. 48.2% conversion and 98.1% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol over ME-Zr-200W for t=24h, Table 1 ). Finally, in a new attempt at decreasing reaction times, the solids calcined at 200°C were tested in the microwave oven (Fig. 8 ). Such a Figure confirms results observed by conventional heating in terms of higher conversion and selectivities to FA for similar reaction times for solids synthesized through microemulsion and the particularly high selectivities on ME-Zr-200W. Moreover, the reaction is indeed accelerated under these conditions (15–30 times for ME solids, compare Figs. 7 and 8). The question on whether acceleration of chemical reactions by microwaves is a result of the thermal heat generated by the microwave or any specific effect of microwave heating (“specific microwave effect”) continues to be a matter of debate [35,36]. In the latter case, basically the two ways to increase the reaction rate according to Arrhenius equation (k=A e−ΔG‡/RT) are: (i) affecting preexponential factor through increasing molecular vibrations; (ii) altering free energy of activation, ΔG‡. From the practical point of view, many reactions are accelerated, especially when polarity increases during the reaction. In our case, an additional factor to be considered, given the low calcination temperature of the most active solids, is the possibility that microwaves affected catalyst structure during the reaction. To cast further light on that, some experiments were performed on ME-Zr-200UW system: two portions of fresh catalyst were re-suspended in isopropanol and submitted to conventional and microwave heating, respectively, for 30min. Then, the solvent was eliminated and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were registered. Results showed that in all three cases (fresh catalyst, catalyst submitted to conventional heating or to microwaves), BET surface areas were in the 200–215m2/g range and pore size distribution hardly changed. Therefore, the catalysts synthesized at 200°C are stable under working conditions."
8,Conclusions,"Different zirconium-based systems were obtained from zirconium (IV) oxynitrate via microemulsion (ME) water in oil technique. Once nanoparticles had been precipitated, one portion was washed with chloroform/ethanol mixture to partially eliminate the surfactant prior to calcination whereas another portion was not washed. For comparative purposes, other solids were also synthesized by conventional sol-gel process (P series). The presence of surfactant remaining from the synthetic procedure retarded ZrO2 crystallisation (as evidenced by TGA-DTA) and resulted in higher surface areas in the 300–400°C range as compared to P-series. Moreover, average particle sizes (XRD) in ME solids are comparatively smaller than those of the systems belonging to P series. The solids were tested for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation furfural to furfuryl alcohol using propan-2-ol as the hydrogen donor, under conventional heating and microwave irradiation. The optimum calcination temperature was about 200°C which ensured that hydrous zirconia was still amorphous with a high amount of OH surface groups to catalyze the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley process and a high surface area (ca. 200m2/g). Moreover, the presence of some surfactant from the synthetic procedure in solids synthesized through the microemulsion process favored the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. The steric hindrance of furfural molecule by the surfactant molecules surrounding zirconium nanoparticles could somehow favor the interaction through the CO group. Nevertheless, the amount of surfactant residues should not be too high, as evidenced by the fact that ME series solids submitted to a washing process prior to calcination led to better results in term of selectivity to furfuryl alcohol than unwashed systems."
