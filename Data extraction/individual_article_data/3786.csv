0,Introduction,"The consequences of increasing population and rapid industrialization accompanied by the massive consumption of fossil fuels are reflected in the deterioration of the environment. Further, the limited availability of non-renewable fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are expected to cause an energy shortage unless alternative energy resources are fully developed. Therefore, there is a growing demand for renewable, eco-friendly, and non-polluting zero-emission alternative sources of energy to break the dependence on fossil fuels while helping reduce environmental pollution. Many countries like Japan, Germany, the USA, China, and South Korea have set their targets to increase renewable energy production via wind, geothermal, hydro, solar, nuclear, and hydrogen energy. Further, the European Union has announced 30–40% electricity production from renewable energy by 2020 [1]. Germany aims to produce 50% of its electricity from solar power plants and winds by 2030 and 80% by 2050 [1]. Among all kinds of renewable energy sources, hydrogen is considered to be a preferable option to help phase out the use of fossil fuels due to its high calorific value, light weight, and high gravimetric energy density (~33kWh/Kg) [2]. Hydrogen can also limit global warming because there are no direct emissions of pollutants like CO2 upon its combustion. The use of hydrogen energy technologies has gained considerable attention from researchers and industries throughout the world. The global demand for hydrogen is continuously increasing, and it is expected to increase by almost 80 EJ by 2050, as shown in Fig. 1, [3]. The use of MXenes, layered structures, and their composites has been explored from various fields (e.g., EMI shielding, electro-CO2 reduction, catalyst, hydrogen evolution, supercapacitor, batteries, and catalysis) [4–14]. The great potential of two-dimensional (2D) materials as practical hydrogen storage materials is also recognized due to their advantageous properties such as large aspect ratios, excellent mechanical stiffness, and also exceptional thermal conductivity [10,15–18]. MXenes are composed of transition metals and carbides (or nitrides). As transition metals like titanium have already been used to improve the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon-based materials, MXenes can be recommendable for hydrogen storage applications [19,20]. The storage of hydrogen can be promoted via Kubas-type interaction due to the presence of transition metals in MXenes [21,22]. The utility of MXene-based materials (e.g., Ti2C) have rarely been assessed for hydrogen storage applications to date despite their high potential for this application due to their superior capacities (as high as 8.5 wt% via density functional theory) [23]. In this article, we describe the recent progress in hydrogen storage technologies. We developed this state-of-the-art review to describe the fundamental aspects of MXene-based materials for their applications in hydrogen storage. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort to offer a comprehensive review on MXene-based materials for hydrogen storage applications. We also describe the different methodologies available for the synthesis of MXene-based materials along with an evaluation of their performance. Finally, the discussion is extended to the future potential of MXene-based technology for hydrogen storage."
1,Current methodologies for hydrogen storage,"Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier for fuel cell technologies due to its light weight and high gravimetric energy density. For applications of fuel cells and light duty vehicular systems that require hydrogen storage technologies, molecular hydrogen needs to be stored either in gas, liquid, or solid-state form. Fig. 2 is a schematic for different types of hydrogen storage technologies based on physical and chemical routes in relation to diverse substrate materials described below. These types are classified further to obtain the better idea for hydrogen storage on the existing materials. Many reviews have been written that describe hydrogen storage technologies [24–26]. Fig. 3 shows a graphical presentation of the selected storage materials including carbon- and metal-based complex hydrides with respect to volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density (as briefly described later) [27]."
2,Physical storage,"2.1 Physical storage The most common technologies for hydrogen storage are compressed gas and liquid storage. Hydrogen is commonly stored in cylinders or tanks in gaseous form and compressed at high pressures between 35 and 70 MPa in Type IV carbon composite cylinders [28]. At ambient temperature and pressure, the energy of hydrogen gas is 10 MJ/m3, which requires a huge container to store the hydrogen. Thus, it is essential to use special alloys or composite fiber-based designed tanks. Hydrogen was stored at 700 bar pressure in a single tank with a gravimetric density of 4.2 wt% and a volumetric density of 2.9 MJ/L system with an approximate cost of 15 $/kWh [29]. Compression and its dynamics have been well described in the past [30]. The main advantage of compressed gas storage technology is that it has a straightforward, efficient, and fast filling/releasing rate, which ensures commercial utility. It however suffers from several disadvantages such as low volumetric capacity, high energy consumption for compression, heat management during filling, and high-pressure tanks. Such pressurized (35–70 MPa) tanks may have various safety concerns like gas leakage, vessel explosion, and temperature rise. As described above, many challenges exist as hurdles for the commercialization of gas storage technologies. In this regard, researchers are seeking suitable technologies to compress the hydrogen gas efficiently. The second most straight forward approach for hydrogen storage is liquefaction. The liquefied hydrogen (LH2) is stored in cryogenic tanks as first introduced in the 1990s [30]. In this LH2 storage technology, the first hydrogen needs to be cooled down at a low temperature of − 253°C before it can be stored in cryogenic tanks [31]. A typical cryogenic tank is constructed of low density, high strength, high fracture toughness, and low permeation materials for both gas and liquid hydrogen. The main advantage of the LH2 technique is to acquire a higher density of 70.8 kg/m3 in comparison to a compressed gas storage density of 35 kg/m3. This high density of LH2 is being used primarily in space applications, since LH2 requires more input energy for storage. Theoretical calculations suggested that a minimum power of 3.9kWh/(kgLH2) is needed for hydrogen liquefaction (Peschka W. 1992. Liquid Hydrogen - Fuel of the Future. Vienna: Springer-Verlag). The benchmark for hydrogen liquefaction is an estimated cost of €1.72/(kg LH2) [32]. The main hurdle in this technique is to reduce the boil-off losses, which may vary from 0.1% to 3% per day. Many efforts along with research and development are focusing on this option. Both LH2 and compressed gas hydrogen storage technologies are well understood and commercialized. In addition, combined cryo-compressed technology was also developed in which hydrogen is first liquefied and then compressed in cryo-tanks. BMW launched the first cryo-compressed technology in 2012 [33]. The main advantage of this cryo-compressed technology is to get relatively high volumetric density, but it does not reduce the total system cost. Physical storage of hydrogen was investigated by developing various types of solid-state materials via adsorption such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), hyper cross-linked polymers, clathrate hydrates, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerene, graphene, and graphene oxides [24,28,34,35]. For some of these materials (e.g., fullerenes, graphene, and COFs), hydrogen storage capacities of ~9.0, ~7.0, and 5–7 wt%, respectively that are higher than the DOE target value of 5.5 wt%. Despite such enhanced capacity (≥5.5 wt%), these materials have not been commercialized due to their operability and durability issues [36,37]. As such, there are more issues to be considered for practical use such as the system efficiency, weight and volume, durability/operability, charging/discharging, and storage cost. In general, the main problem of physiosorption is low binding capacity (or energy) between hydrogen molecules and host material. Hydrogen storage in solid-state materials depends on the interactions between a hydrogen atom and a host/substrate. Hydrogen can be stored in solid-state materials either through chemisorption, physisorption, Kubas-type interaction, and spillover processes [38]. In the former, host materials and hydrogen atoms have strong binding energy (40–80 kJ/mol), which makes it challenging to release hydrogen at ambient conditions for practical applications [22]. In contrast, physisorption in MOF and graphitic materials shows weak binding energies of 4–10 kJ/mol, which are also not feasible for practical applications [22,39]. Theoretical studies showed that decoration with metals (e.g., transition metals, alkali, and alkaline earth) can increase the binding energy of hydrogen atoms on sorption-based materials [40,41]. However, the decoration of metals on sorbents tends to form clusters, which may reduce the hydrogen storage properties. Further, it was found that storage capacities can be improved through optimization of material properties (e.g., pore size, volume, and surface area)."
3,Chemical storage,"2.2 Chemical storage In the chemical storage process, hydrogen is stored by forming covalent bonds with solid or liquid state materials. In this series, commonly used materials including hydrocarbons (e.g., methane and benzene), ammonia and liquid organics have already been explored for hydrogen storage. In this technology, storage involves decomposition of source materials such as storing hydrogen in gaseous ammonia through a catalytic route. It has already been reported that ammonia-based compounds can show a hydrogen storage capacity up to 17.4 wt% [42,43]. Liquid organic heterocycles, alcohols, and ammonia borane (AB) have been studied as storage materials [44–46]. Low silica type X zeolites containing alkali metal cations have shown hydrogen storage capacities of 1.6 wt% at ambient conditions [47,48]. Metal hydrides are the most common compounds used for chemical hydrogen storage. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) showed a hydrogen storage capacity up to 7.6 wt%, which is far above the DOE requirement [49]. Further, complex hydrides, e.g., sodium borohydride and lithium borohydride, have been widely investigated and they provide storage capacities ranging from 14.9 to 18.5 wt% [50]. Unfortunately, high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures and slow kinetics are an issue for reversible storage [51–53]. A comprehensive review of metal hydrides has been published elsewhere [36]."
4,Overview of MXene synthesis,"MXenes are considered as a new class of 2D layered materials. The general chemical formula of MAX phases is Mn+1AXn (n = 1, 2, 3), where M is an early transition metal element such as Ti and Sc, and A represents group 13 or 14 elements such as Al or Si, and X refers to C, N, or their blends. MAX phases are classified into 211, 312, and 413 structures [54]. The cross-sectional view of the 211, 312, and 413 MAX phases and their corresponding MXene structures are shown in Fig. 4 [55]. A single layer or multi-layer MXenes are usually produced through selective etching of the A layer from the MAX phase. MAX phases are layered ternary transition metal carbides or nitrides. To date, more than 60 MAX phases have been synthesized [56]. The M-X bond is more stable than the M-A bond, leading to the etching of A layers from the MAX phase upon the intercalation of a suitable etching agent in the MAX phase to produce single M-X layers. The first MXene, Ti3C2 sheets, was synthesized by Gogotsi and co-workers by etching Al from Ti3AlC2 MAX powder using a hydrofluoric (HF) acid solution. Table 1 summarizes the synthesis methods of MXenes, which were used so far in different applications including electrocatalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, capacitor, adsorbent, and health care ( Fig. 5). The Ti3AlC2 powder was immersed in a 50% HF solution for 2 h at room temperature [57]. Then, the resulting solution was washed several times with deionized water. The Al layers were etched using ultrasonication. Finally, Ti3C2 nanosheets were obtained through centrifugation. During the etching of the Al layer, surface functional groups (OH and F) were attached to the transition metal. The following equations describe the suggested mechanism to obtain 2D Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets with attached functional groups like hydroxyls and fluorine: (1) Ti3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 +1·5H2 + Ti3C2 (2) Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2 (OH)2 + H2 (3) Ti3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2 The synthesis of single-layer MXene depends on many parameters, such as the lateral size of the MAX phase, the concentration of HF, sonication time, and M-A bond strength. Other etching agents and intercalation/delamination methods were introduced to obtain single or few layers of MXene sheets. In most of the synthesis methods, the thickness of the MXene layer was measured as less than 1 nm with a few to tens of microns in size later on. A detailed study of Ti3C2Tx was made using different etchants and delamination methods [58]. Conditions like the composition of HF acid and reaction time were optimized to produce high-quality Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. It was found that Al etching occurred at 5 wt% HF, although the accordion-like morphology was observed only for ≥ 10 wt% HF solutions ( Table 2). HF is a widely used etchant for the synthesis of most MXenes. However, due to its toxic nature, other kinds of etchants were proposed for MXene synthesis. For instance, a new etchant (ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2)) was used for the synthesis of 2D Ti3C2TX MXene film [59]. Despite its low harmfulness, this method led to the concomitant intercalation of NH3 and NH4 + during the etching process. Consequently, Ti3C2TX films exhibited a 25% higher c lattice parameter and higher transparencies than HF etched films. Further, the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene in 1 M of different bifluoride solutions has been studied in detail [60]. The roles of temperature and etching time were also considered. A minimum etching time of 8 h at 60 °C was observed for exfoliating Ti3AlC2 in a 1 M bifluoride solution. Ghidiu et al. (2014) used 6 M HCl and a LiF mixture as the etchant for the Ti3AlC2 MAX powder under a constant temperature of 35 °C for 24 h, followed by washing with DI water. The obtained Ti3C2TX flakes were found to be larger without any defects. 2D Ti3C2Tx sheets formed a clay-like paste, which can adopt free-standing or other designed shapes [61]. Afterward, other fluoride salts like NaF, NH4F, CaF2, and FeF3 mixtures with HCl were used as etchants in the place of HF [62]. In a further study, Gogosti et al. prepared transition metal nitride MXenes by heating the mixture of the Ti4AlN3 MAX phase and ternary eutectic molten fluoride salt (LiF, NaF, and KF) at 550 °C under an inert atmosphere [55]. The obtained Ti4N3Tx MXene showed inferior crystallinity in comparison to fluoride salt etched transition metal carbide MXenes. This is due to the stronger bonding of Al-N in Tin+1AlNn than the Al-C bond in Tin+1AlCn. Also, nitrogen-containing MXenes are less stable than carbon-containing MXenes due to the lower cohesive energy of nitrides [63]. In addition to HF and fluoride salt etching methods, MXenes were also synthesized using alkaline etching methods. For instance, an alkali-assisted hydrothermal method was employed for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene using a NaOH solution as an etching agent [64]. The fluorine-free synthesis of MXene was inspired by the Bayer process, which is used in bauxite refining. High temperature (270 °C) and a high concentration of NaOH (27.5 M) were used for the conversion of Al(OH)3 and AlO(OH) into dissolvable Al(OH)4 -. This method produced multi-layer MXene sheets with a purity of ~92 wt%. Using this fluorine-free alkali-etching method, one can avoid the release of HF. Nonetheless, heating of a concentrated NaOH solution at high temperature and pressure under hydrothermal conditions can again result in safety concerns. The issue in the alkali-etching hydrothermal method was resolved by proposing a new tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) etchant, which is commercially used for Al etching. This organic-based TMAOH can easily intercalate in Ti3AlC2, while the bonding of O atoms of Al(OH)4− with Ti atoms at the surface may promote delamination [65]. Afterward, many other organic bases like hydrazine, urea, choline hydroxide, and n-butylamine were tested as delamination agents. These organic molecules intercalate into layers of MXene flakes, which can easily be delaminated upon sonication or handshaking, as shown in Fig. 6 [66,67]. Synthesis of few-layer MXenes was also introduced by MAX powders dispersion in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) using high-energy mechanical milling [68]. The produced few-layer MXene sheets have shown fast electron transport (with less charge transfer resistance) and Na+ diffusion, which is good for electrochemical applications [69]. Like graphene, MXenes were also synthesized through electrochemical methods. In this method, MXenes were obtained by electrochemical etching from MAX phases. In recent work, a thermally-assisted electrochemical etching method was developed for V2CTx, Ti2CTx, and Cr2CTx MXenes [70]. Different etching voltages (0.4–0.7 V for V2AlC, 0.3 V for Ti2AlC, and 0.6–1.0 V for Cr2AlC) were applied for different types of MXenes samples [71]. In this electrochemical etching process, etching of Al atoms was done by applying a voltage to form layered carbides. Further etching was carried out to produce a single layer of MXene sheets. This method is simple but not favorable for large-scale synthesis due to the long etching time."
5,Hydrogen storage in MXenes,"The application of MXenes for hydrogen storage has been investigated rather rarely compared to other fields of research. A schematic of hydrogen storage is presented in Fig. 7. In solid-state storage materials, hydrogen adsorption mainly proceeds in two different routes: weak physisorption of H2 molecules vs. strong chemisorption of dissociated hydrogen atoms. In general, the binding energy of hydrogen molecules in physisorption is less than 0.1 eV. In chemisorption, dissociated hydrogen atoms form a strong covalent bond with metals with a binding energy of ≥ 0.8 eV. There is one more type of hydrogen interaction—the Kubas interaction—in which binding energies fall in between weak physisorption and strong chemisorption. Usually, the binding energy in Kubas-type interactions lies in the range of 0.2–0.8 eV/H2, which is required for reversible hydrogen storage at 300–400 K and ambient pressure. The Kubas-type interaction between hydrogen molecules and transition metals has been described in previous studies [19,72,73]. The Kubas-type binding interaction is important for hydrogen storage because it can provide binding energy in between chemisorption and physisorption. The Kubas-type interaction is consistent with the lengthening of H-H bond without breakage with an electron donation (e.g., from an H-H σ-bonding orbital to an empty d-orbital of metal) [74]. At the same time, π-back-donation from a filled transition metal (d-orbital) takes place into vacant σ* anti-bonding orbital of H2 molecule. As a means to achieve Kubas-type interaction, a number of attempts (e.g., metal decoration on sorption materials) have been made to increase the binding energy between hydrogen and host material [19,75]. Nonetheless, the development of such materials, which use Kubas-type interaction to store hydrogen, is yet challenging. It was suggested that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of CNTs and graphene can be enhanced by doping of metal nanoparticles [76,77]. The mechanism behind the enhancement of hydrogen storage properties in metal decorated CNTs/graphene is due to the strong interaction of metals and hydrogen atoms. 2D MXene is composed of transition metal carbides, nitrides, or blends. The strong bonding between the transition metal and carbon/nitrogen in MXenes can solve the long-standing problem of transition metal aggregation [78–81]. Due to the partial metallic nature of 2D MXenes, it provides an excellent opportunity to adsorb molecular hydrogen with a desirable binding energy of 10–20 kJ/mol for practical applications. Numerous theoretical studies on hydrogen storage in 2D MXenes have been reported. However, there are only a few experimental studies reported on MXenes for hydrogen storage applications. The first hydrogen storage investigation of Ti2C MXene was based on first-principles calculations [23]. The Ti2C MXene was expected to have a high gravimetric storage capacity due to its high surface area and strong Ti-C bond. Density functional theory (DFT) was used for first-principles total-energy pseudopotential calculations for Ti2C. Hydrogen adsorption calculations were investigated on a Ti2C 3 × 3 periodic supercell with six favorable hydrogen adsorption sites, as shown in Fig. 7a. The following equation was used to compute the binding energy (E b ) between H2 molecules and the Ti2C host material: (4) E b = ( E host + n E H 2 − E host + n H 2 ) / n where E host , E H 2 , and E host + n H 2 represent the total energy of the host structure, total energy of a free H 2 , and total energy of the host structure with adsorption of hydrogen molecules, respectively. The number n is the number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules. The hydrogen adsorption calculations were performed on a 2D Ti2C 3 × 3 supercell [23]. The distance between neighboring cells was taken to be 20 Å to avoid any interactions. For hydrogen storage calculations, a total of six favorable sites were identified for adsorption of an H2 molecule, as shown in Fig. 7a. Once a hydrogen molecule is placed in the Ti2C of the supercell, the H2 molecule is transferred parallel to the three sites but perpendicular to the hollow_2 site. As the hollow_2 site is thermally unstable, the hydrogen molecule dissociates into two H atoms to occupy the hollow_1 site. Calculations showed that the hollow_1 site is the most stable one for the adsorption of dissociated H atoms (Fig. 7b). The calculated binding energy of 5.027 eV/H with a bond distance of 1.977 Å in Ti-H revealed strong interactions between H atoms and the Ti2C surface. Further, the adsorption of hydrogen on the Ti2C(3×3)_18H, Ti2C(3×3)_18H_18H2, Ti2C(3×3)_18H_36H2 structures was studied. Fig. 7c and d represent the top and side view of the Ti2C(3×3)_18H_36H2 model. In this model, hydrogen can be adsorbed on the MXene sheet via three different routes (i.e., chemisorption, Kubas-type, and physisorption interaction). The corresponding hydrogen adsorption values (and binding energies) were calculated to be 1.7 wt% (5.027 eV), 3.4 wt% (0.272 eV), and 3.4 wt% (0.109 eV), respectively. Accordingly, strongly chemically bonded hydrogen cannot be released due to the high binding energy of chemisorption under ambient conditions. In contrast, it is very difficult to bind hydrogen through physisorption to the host material. Hence, the reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 3.4 wt% was obtained from Kubas-type interaction available for practical applications [23]. The total hydrogen adsorption capacity of 8.6 wt% is higher than the gravimetric capacity of 5.5 wt% set by U.S. DOE (2015). Further, molecular dynamic simulation studies confirmed the Kubas-type interaction of hydrogen with Ti2C MXene. The analysis of hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion on Ti2C MXene was made using first-principles calculations using density functional theory [82]. Similar to previous work, the Ti2C 3 × 3×1 supercell was constructed with and without carbon vacancies along with an adjacent Ti2C layer distance of 20 Å. Fig. 8a showed three different adsorption sites (Ti top, hollow site A, and hollow site B) along with carbon vacancies. Fig. 8b depicts the side of Ti2C 3×3x1 supercells with end on and side on configurations. The following equations were used to calculate the adsorption energy E ads of H2 molecules and H atoms: (5) E ads = E T i 2 C + H 2 − E T i 2 C − E ( H 2 ) (6) E ads = E T i 2 C + H − E T i 2 C − E ( H 2 ) / 2 where E(Ti 2 C+H 2 ) is the calculated total energy of the system with H2 adsorption, E(Ti2C) is the total energy of the system with or without carbon vacancies, and E(H2) presents the gas-phase energy of H2 molecules. Similarly, E(Ti2C+H), and E(Ti2C) are the total energies of the system with and without H atom adsorption, respectively. Adsorption energies of the H2 molecule were calculated for both end on and side on configurations. In the end-on configuration, H-H bond lengths are comparable to the free H2 molecule, confirming the adsorption of hydrogen in molecular form. As such, these results support the physisorption of the H2 molecule on Ti2C MXene. In contrast, in the side-on configuration, the H2 molecule was dissociated into H atoms. Different configuration models were proposed for the adsorption of dissociated H atoms. It was found that both H atoms would preferably adsorb on hollow A site positions. The adsorption energy is lower (−1.35 eV) for hollow site A relative to the top or hollow B site (Fig. 8c). Further, the diffusion and permeation abilities of hydrogen were investigated on the surface of the single-layer Ti2C and on the inside. Fig. 8d shows the relative potential energy as a function of diffusion sites. The hydrogen atom first starts at hollow site A, passes a bridge with the potential energy of 0.54 eV to hollow site B, and then again reaches hollow site A. This is accompanied by an energy barrier of 0.12 eV to reach a carbon vacancy. The proposed diffusion pathway revealed better hydrogen diffusion with the introduction of carbon vacancies on the Ti2C monolayer. Experimental evidence of molecular hydrogen trapping in Ti3C2Tx MXene was confirmed by inelastic and elastic neutron scattering [83]. Only MXene samples prepared using more than 10% HF showed trapping of hydrogen. The trapping of hydrogen on the MXene sample is due to defects on its surface caused by the use of a strong etchant. In a further study, Ti3C2 MXenes were also introduced into 4Mg-LiAlH4 to improve its desorption/absorption properties [84]. The Ti3C2/4Mg-LiAlH4 composites were synthesized using a ball milling method. A fully automated Sieverts-type apparatus was used for isothermal hydrogenation and non-isothermal dehydrogenation measurements at a hydrogen pressure range from 0.01 to 5 MPa. The de-hydrogenation measurements of 4MgH2-LiAlH4-Ti3C2 composite showed around 6.6 wt% hydrogen release in three stages during the dehydrogenation of the ternary composite system. Hydrogen storage properties in other MXenes like Cr2C and Ti2N were also evaluated [85,86]. Similar to previous theoretical calculations [82], hydrogen storage in 2D Ti2N was calculated by first-principles calculations [86]. Simulation results revealed 8.55 wt% maximum hydrogen storage capacity in Ti2N MXenes. However, the reversible hydrogen storage capacity was 3.42 wt%, which is obtained from Kubas-type interactions. Also, Ti2N(OH)2 MXene achieved reversible hydrogen storage capacity up to 2.66 wt%. Hydrogen storage properties of 2D Cr2C MXene were also studied using density functional theory [85]. The binding energies of H or H2 adsorption on the Cr2C layer were calculated. Different calculation models for binding energies parallel and perpendicular to the Cr2C surface were considered for hydrogen adsorption. A study of the partial density of states showed high H-adsorption. The binding energy and density of states confirmed the possible interaction of atomic and molecular hydrogen with a Cr2C surface via weak electrostatic, physisorption, and chemisorption [85]. This study showed a maximum H2 gravimetric storage capacity of 7.6 wt%, in which 6.4 wt% was accounted for by the reversible hydrogen storage capacity. This 6.4 wt% value is due to weak electrostatic interactions and Kubas-type interactions with a hydrogen binding energy ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 eV/H2. The utility of multilayer Ti3C2Tx made of both monolayer MXenes sheets and incomplete etched MXene was explored for hydrogen storage [87]. The results of this multilayer MXene showed 8.8 wt% of hydrogen storage at 60 bar H2 while it could retain 4 wt% at ambient conditions. This excellent hydrogen storage is attributed to weak chemisorption of hydrogen between sub-nanoscale interlayer space in multilayer Ti3C2Tx. MXenes were excellent catalysts for hydrogen storage properties. MXene compound (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 was used as a catalyst for hydrogen storage in MgH2 [88]. The as prepared MgH2-10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 exhibited optimum (5 wt%) hydrogen storage properties. The hydrogen desorbing temperature was reduced by 70 °C in comparison to pristine MgH2. The hydrogenated MgH2-10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 absorbed 4.8 wt% hydrogen within 5 s at 120 °C. Further, the catalytic effect of Nb4C3Tx MXene on the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 was investigated [89]. The MgH2-5 wt% Nb4C3Tx exhibits superior hydrogen storage kinetics properties. In a further study, the hydrogen storage potential of doped MXene has also been explored. Sodium alanates (NaH/Al) in situ doped with Ti3C2 MXene were also evaluated for hydrogen storage properties [90]. The Ti3C2-doped NaH/Al composite exhibited 4.2 wt% H2 storage within 4.5 min at 76 °C with good absorption/desorption cycle stability. Fig. 9 shows the isothermal curves of hydrogen absorption of dehydrogenated NaAlH4-8 wt% Ti3C2 and NaH/Al-8 wt% Ti3C2 composites under three different temperatures. Initially, H2 absorption increased with an increase in temperature and then saturated. At 100 °C, dehydrogenated NaAlH4-8 wt% Ti3C2 absorbs 4.2 wt% H2 within 4.5 min and increased up to 4.9 wt% H2 in 64 min Table 1 shows the hydrogen storage performance of MXenes and its composites materials. The effect of Ti3C2 MXene on hydrogen storage performance of its composite with lithium borohydride (LiBH4) has been explored [91]. Accordingly, the dehydrogenation temperature is reduced from 180 °C to 120 °C, when the hydrogen storage capability of LiBH4 + 40 wt% Ti3C2 is evaluated. Also, this composite released much higher hydrogen (5.37 wt%) than that of the pristine LiBH4 (~1 wt%) within an hour at 350 °C. Further analysis indicates a significant reduction in activation energy to 70.3 kJ/mol for LiBH4/Ti3C2 composite, which is much lower than the pristine LiBH4 (187 kJ/mole) [92]. The reduction in activation energy and improved hydrogen storage capacity in LiBH4/Ti3C2 composite may be due to layered active Ti containing Ti3C2 MXene. In other work, Ti3C2 MXene sheets were introduced into NaAlH4 for improving hydrogen storage properties [93]. A significant reduction in operating temperature was found with the noticeable improvement in hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics. For example, dehydrogenation temperature of 7 wt% Ti3C2/NaAlH4 composite is reduced to 100 °C with the liberation of 4.7 wt% hydrogen within 100 min at 140 °C. Dehydrogenated Ti3C2/NaAlH4 composite absorbs 4.6 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 120 °C. This is indeed much higher than pristine NaAlH4 which absorbs only 0.4 wt% under identical conditions. Also, Ti3C2/NaAlH4 composite showed good cyclic stability (more than 10 cycle) with insignificant changes in hydrogenation/dehydrogenation results [93]. The XRD/XPS analysis revealed that in the Ti3C2/NaAlH4 sample, the Ti3C2 reacts with NaAlH4 to form metallic Ti and Ti3+ species. In fact, these species are important for improving dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics while lowering the operating temperatures. Recently, Zhu et al. reported self-assembled Ni decorated Ti3C2 MXene (Ni@Ti-MX) based catalyst for improving MgH2 hydrogen storage properties [94]. First, Ni@Ti-MX catalyst was introduced into MgH2 once Ni nanoparticles were decorated on Ti3C2 MXene sheets. HRTEM analysis confirms the uniform distribution of Ni nanoparticles on 2D Ti3C2 MXene with the formation of multiphase components (Mg2Ni, TiO2, metallic Ti, or amorphous carbon) in the MgH2/Ni@Ti-MX composite sample. The composite sample exhibits enhanced hydrogen sorption kinetics of MgH2. Results showed the 5.4 wt% absorptions of H2 in 25 s at 125 °C and release of 5.2 wt% H2 in 15 min at 250 °C as shown in Fig. 10a,b. Further analysis exhibits 4 wt% hydrogen absorption at room temperature. In addition to enhanced sorption kinetics, the dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2/Ni@Ti-MX composite is around 221 °C, which is 122 °C lower than pure MgH2. Fig. 10c depicts the possible hydrogen absorption mechanism in MgH2/Ni@Ti-MX composite sample. The enhanced hydrogen sorption properties of MgH2/Ni@Ti-MX composite should be ascribable to core-shell MgH2@Mg2NiH4 nanostructure and interfacial coupling between catalyst and matrix. Because of many advantages of MXenes for hydrogen storage (e.g., lightweight, high surface area, and Kubas type interaction), they are preferable options for high gravimetric storage capacity at moderate temperature and pressure. In recent theoretical studies, a hydrogen storage capacity of 8.5 wt% has been demonstrated for Ti3C2Tx MXene at room temperature. This value is in fact far larger than the required value (5.5 wt%) by U.S. DOE targets for onboard hydrogen storage systems for light-duty vehicles. The MXenes showed hydrogen storage capacity comparable to metal decorated CNTs or Sc-decorated graphene nanoribbons [19,20]. Nonetheless, metals have shown non-uniform dispersion on any solid substrate with slow reaction kinetics. The 2D MXenes can also be used preferably to improve both kinetics and dehydrogenation temperature of metal hydrides (e.g. MgH2, and NaAlH4) [93,95]. Also, the diversity of transition metals (e.g., Ti, Mo, Nb, V, Cr, and Ta) can offer diversities for the combination of MXenes hybrid structures with more options for enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity."
6,Summary and outlook,"In this review, we investigated the main problems associated with hydrogen storage technologies. We have highlighted the different methodologies available for hydrogen storage through different routes. In this context, MXene-based materials have emerged as promising alternative materials for the enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity. The maximum gravimetric hydrogen storage (up to 8.8 wt%) and reversible hydrogen storage of 6.4 wt% can be achieved in MXene materials. This high hydrogen storage capacity demonstrates that the MXene-based materials are very promising for reversible hydrogen storage applications. Future research on MXene-based materials may further improve their uses in hydrogen storage as follows: 1) The interaction of atomic/molecular hydrogen with the MXene surface is a key parameter to achieve the optimum hydrogen adsorption by a number of routes (e.g., via chemisorption, physisorption, and Kubas-type interactions). Therefore, a better understanding of fundamental topographical properties of MXenes is important for such applications. 2) The functional groups on MXenes can play a vital role in determining hydrogen adsorption properties. Thus, the role of functional groups on MXene layers needs to be explored. 3) Controlled doping of metals on MXenes is a useful option to upgrade their hydrogen storage capacity using the merits of metals for capacity enhancement. 4) Controlled interlayer spacing among MXene sheets can adsorb a greater number of hydrogen atoms because an aligned structure (similar like 2D materials) may improve adsorption properties. A number of properties need to be improved to develop efficient materials for strong physisorption in terms of structure, topographical properties, existing functional groups, interlayer spacing, and the presence of a certain amount of metal. In this context, MXenes have been identified as an ideal option for hydrogen storage technologies as they have all the recommended properties described above. As such, MXene can be considered as a new alternative class of materials that can be used effectively for the advancement of physisorption-/adsorption-based technologies for hydrogen storage."
