0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting using solar energy is considered the “Holy Grail” of hydrogen economy. Since 1950, a large number of photocatalysts have been developed for hydrogen generation. Unfortunately, most of them are of a wide forbidden band, and only respond to UV light of the sun. Moreover, photo-induced carriers tend to recombination before reaching surface reaction cites of photocatalyst. Therefore, the development of efficient, stable, and low-cost photocatalysts is still the key factor for the application of this technique. CdS is a typical semiconductor photocatalyst with a narrow band gap of 2.4 eV (≤520 nm), which has been widely used in R&D of photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Its conduction band (CB) position is −0.52 V vs. NHE, which is more negative than H+/H2 (0 V vs. RHE), and its valence band position is 1.88 eV vs. NHE[1], which is more negative than OH–/O2 (1.23 V vs. RHE), meeting the thermodynamic conditions of photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen[2]. CdS alone is inactive toward photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction, and is usually coupled with noble metal cocatalyst or another semiconductor to achieve high hydrogen generation rate. Fig. 1 lists the CdS-based researching works in the last two years. It can be seen that the modification of CdS photocatalyst have three technique routes: 1) Cations and anions doping in the bulk of CdS, such as O2– [3], Mo4+ [4], Zn2+ [5], Er3+ [6], etc. Ion doping forms intermediate levels in the energy band of CdS, not only expands the absorption of solar energy, but also promotes the separation efficiency of the photo-induced carriers, which result in the acceleration of hydrogen generation rate. 2) Metals and their alloys deposition on the surface of CdS, such as noble metals Pt[7], PtNi[8,9], PtCo[10], PtNiCo[10], PdNi[11], Ru[12], and non-noble metal Ni[13], Co[14]. Because the work functions of these metals are larger than that of CdS, the photo-induced electrons can be trapped by these metals, resulting in the promotion of separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers. As to the alloy cocatalyst, the enhanced activity can also be attributed to the synergistic effect of the bi-metal or tri-metal. In our previous works, the structure of metal cocatalysts is proved to be a key factor to their activity. Pt with polyhedron structure[10,15,16], hollow structure[9,11] are more active, which might be caused by the high percentage of surface atoms, and high miscoordination of Pt atom. 3) CdS compounded with another semiconductor, such as metallic oxides (TiO2 [17], WO3 [18], CeO2 [19] etc.), metal sulfides (ZnS[20], CoS[21], Cu2S[22]), metal hydroxides (Cu(OH)2 [23], Zn(OH)2 [24]), metal phosphides (NiCoP[25], FeP[26], FeCoP[27]), carbon materials (g-C3N4 [28], rGO[29]), and metal–organic framework (MIL-53(Fe)[30], Mn-ZIF-67[31], UiO-66[32]) etc. Heterostructure benefits the photo-induced electrons and holes migrating opposite, resulting in the promotion of separation efficiency. Pt-based nanoframe material is of a three-dimensional open structure with more exposed subsurface atoms, and has been used in Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) recently. In this study, PtNi octahedral nanoframe (NF) was used as cocatalyst, and was modified on the surface of CdS by photoreduction deposition with (NH4)2SO3 as hole scavenger. The Ni element in the PtNi NF is very active, and it continuously migrated from the bulk of PtNi NF and reacted with the OH– in reaction solution to form Ni(OH)2, which formed a semi-enclosed structure around the residual Pt NF. This new Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst shows excellent performance in hydrogen production from water splitting under visible light, and the maximum hydrogen yield rate reaches 44.05 mmol/h/g (QE = 58.89%, λ = 420 nm)."

All chemicals were used without further purification. All the water used in the experiment is deionized water."
3,Preparation of PtNi NF,"2.2 Preparation of PtNi NF PtNi NF was synthesized via a solvothermal method following a modified two-phase corrosion approach[33]. Typically, 0.1 mmol of Pt(acac)2, 1 mmol of Ni(acac)2, 2 mmol of benzoic acid, and 400 mg PVP were dissolved in 25 mL benzyl alcohol, and stirred for 20 min. The mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated to 453 K, and kept for 10 h. The PtNi octahedra (PtNi Octa) product was separated from the reaction solution, re-dispersed into a solution of 10 mL ethanol and 5 mL oleylamine, refluxed at 383 K for 5 h under nitrogen flow and magnetic stirring. Finally, PtNi Octa was centrifugally separated, washed with the solution of toluene and ethanol, and dispersed in 20 mL toluene. The PtNi NF was obtained by etching the PtNi octahedra with EDTA-2Na. Typically, 20 mg EDTA-2Na and 0.5 mL oleylamine were added into a mixture of 3 mL pure water and 2 mL PtNi Octa toluene suspension, respectively. The mixture was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated up to 363 K and kept for 6 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the product was separated from the reaction solution in a centrifugal machine, washed with deionized water, dried at 343 K for 12 h, finally stored in a sealed jar."
4,Preparation of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS,"2.3 Preparation of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS Scheme 1 shows the synthesis process of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS. CdS nanoplate was synthesized by a hydrothermal method[16]. The as-prepared PtNi NF was photodeposited on the surface of CdS in 50 mL 1 M (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution while the hydrogen photo-generation reaction took place. Since Ni ions are very active, easily combined with free OH– in the aqueous solution to form Ni(OH)2, Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS was formed gradually."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD, BrukerD8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation was used to analyze the phase composition of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS in the 2θ range from 5° to 90°. Inductively Coupled Plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 2100DV) was used to analyze the atomic ratio of as-prepared cocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi equipped with Al Kα source under room temperature. TEM, HRTEM, and element mapping were performed using a FEI Talos F200X, operating at 200 kV. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on Shimadzu, JapanUV-2600. The fluorescence lifetimes were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer under 420 nm light excitation source. The photoluminescence (PL) of photocatalysts were tested with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F7000). Electron spin resonance (ESR, BrukerA300) was detected using 0.1 mg/L photocatalyst suspension and 0.02 mmol/L TEMPO solution. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo Scientific ESCA 250Xi) was performed with He I (21.22 eV) as monochromatic light source and a negative bias of –5 V was applied during the UPS measurement. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore properties of samples were obtained using Quadrasorb SI-4 (Quantachrome Instruments) at 77 K, the samples were degassed at 180 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). The electrochemical work station is equipped with a traditional three-electrode system, which contained a glassy carbon electrode (0.07 cm2) as working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, a platinum wire electrode as counter electrode, respectively. A 0.5 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 is used as the electrolyte solution for the following characterization. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured from −0.6 V to −1.5 V. With a 300 W Xe lamp (PerfectlightPLS-SXE300) as light source, the transient photocurrent response curve was measured under turning on and off the light for four times. The time interval between turning on and off the light is 20 s. All measured potentials were converted reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation. E RHE = E SCE + 0.059 × p H + 0.197"
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate was tested in a Teflon reactor with stainless steel water jacket (internal diameter: 9 cm, height: 5.4 cm). A circular quartz skylight is on the top of the reactor (diameter: 6.5 cm, exposed area: 33.18 cm2), and a 300 W Xe lamp (PerfectlightPLS-SXE300, λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as light source. The as-prepared 50 mg photocatalysts were dispersed in 50 mL 1 M (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution or 50 mL 20% (V/V) lactic acid, and purged in N2 flow for 30 min under magnetic stirring to remove dissolved oxygen from water."
8,Result and discussion,
9,Structure characterization,"3.1 Structure characterization In this work, CdS coupled with a novel cocatalyst Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 was applied in photocatalytic H2 generation under visible light in 1 M (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution. PtNi octahedral nanoparticles (PtNi Octa) were synthesized by solvothermal method, and then etched with EDTA-2Na to obtain PtNi nanoframe (NF). The as-prepared PtNi NF was photodeposited on the surface of CdS in (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution while the hydrogen photo-generation reaction took place. Since Ni ions are very active, easily combined with free OH– to form Ni(OH)2, Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS was formed gradually. Fig. 2 a is the XRD patterns of both as-prepared PtNi Octa and PtNi NF. In this figure, the diffraction peaks appeared at 44.5° and 51.8° correspond to (111) and (200) of nickel elemental (JCPDS PDF #65–2865), and those located at 40.5°, 47.1°, and 68.8° are attributed to (111), (200), and (220) of platinum elemental (JCPDS PDF #65–2868), respectively. Notably, the diffraction peaks of both materials have blue-shifted compared with those of pure Pt, possibly due to the formation of platinum-nickel alloy. More interestingly, the intensity of nickel diffraction peaks in PtNi Octa is significantly smaller than that in PtNi NF, which confirms that nickel element in PtNi Octa has been etched by EDTA-2Na, leaving only a small fraction of Ni to form a PtNi nanoframe structure. To further verify this point, Inductively Coupled Plasma spectrometer (ICP) was used to analyze the atomic ratio of Pt and Ni, and the results show that the Pt/Ni atomic ratio of PtNi Octa and PtNi NF is 13.91/86.09, 42.41/57.59, respectively. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of PtNi Octa/CdS, Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, and CdS were acquired to confirm the successful formation of the composites. In Fig. 2b, several distinct diffraction peaks appear in the range of 20°∼ 60° due to the high crystallinity of CdS and they can be well indexed to the hexagonal CdS phase (JCPDS PDF #65–3414). Besides, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt or Ni cannot be observed in this figure, indicating that the cocatalysts are only loaded on the surface of CdS, and their loading amount is very low. Moreover, the (002) plane intensity of CdS was significantly reduced after the cocatalyst was loaded; therefore, inferring that the cocatalysts have been mainly loaded on the (002) plane. Secondly, the morphologies of PtNi NF and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS were characterized by TEM and HRTEM. As can be seen in Fig. 3 a, most of PtNi NF shows the octahedral frame structure with an average size of ∼ 6 nm while a few particles incurred slight shape change due to the leaching of element Ni. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b shows that the average interplanar spacing of PtNi NF is about 0.21 nm, indexed to the (111) crystal plane. Also, the continuous lattice fringes in this figure indicate that PtNi NF has a face-centered cubic structure. In addition, the octahedral frame morphology of PtNi NF can be verified by the obvious bright and dark contrast between crystal interplanar spacing. Typically, cadmium acetate and thiourea were used to synthesize leaf-shaped CdS (shown in Fig. 3c with a length of about 5 μm by a hydrothermal method at 473 K for 20 h. The nanoplate structure with a large surface area can facilitate electrons migration from the bulk phase to surface active sites, and thus enhance hydrogen evolution performance. The TEM image of the as-prepared Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS (Fig. 3d shows that Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 particles are uniformly deposited on the surface of the CdS, which would facilitate the rapid transmission of electrons and reduce the recombination of carriers. Furthermore, the specific morphology and EDS mapping of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS are characterized in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4a-c, the frogspawn-like Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 with a diameter of ∼ 20 nm are evenly distributed on the surface of CdS to form a new structure of so-called frame@semi-shell (Pt NF@Ni(OH)2). In detail, the HRTEM image of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS (Fig. 4b indicates that the lattice fringes of CdS, Pt, and Ni(OH)2 are 0.33 nm, 0.21 nm, and 0.28 nm. It can also be observed from Fig. 4c that the dark cores of Pt NF are coated by the semi-transparent Ni(OH)2 shells. The formation of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 could be attributed to the oxidation of the Ni in the etched PtNi nanoframe to Ni2+, which then reacted with OH– to form Ni(OH)2 in the weak alkaline condition. Next, the EDS mapping of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS was collected to further verify the formation of the new cocatalyst. Fig. 4d-4e shows EDS mapping at different magnifications, from which the Cd, S, Pt, and Ni elements can be clearly observed. Noticeably, Pt is evenly distributed on the surface of CdS in Fig. 4d, which can effectively capture photogenerated electrons and improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. It is also worth noting that the distribution of Ni is consistent with that of Pt in Fig. 4e, indicating that Ni(OH)2 was successfully formed around Pt NF. To further study the formation process of Ni(OH)2 shell, the photocatalysts prepared with different photocatalytic reaction time were characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 5 a, without photocatalytic reaction, the Ni(OH)2 shell cannot be formed on PtNi NF, which are evenly distributed on the surface of CdS. Fig. 5b shows that the Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 (frame@shell) structure was preliminarily formed with an average diameter of about 10 nm after 2 h of photocatalytic reaction. When the reaction time was further extended to 7.5 h, the average diameter of the Ni(OH)2 shell was grown to about 20 nm (Fig. 5c, forming a perfect frame@shell structure. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the frame@shell structure was formed gradually with the increase of photocatalytic reaction time in the weakly alkaline condition. Meanwhile, indicated by the photocatalytic H2 evolution data, the hydrogen production rate at the prepared photocatalyst does not decrease with the increase of Ni(OH)2 shell diameter, which is demonstrated to be not a dominating factor for hydrogen evolution activity. The improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is mainly due to the synergistic effect of PtNi nanoframe structure and Ni(OH)2, which significantly improves the carrier separation efficiency. Thirdly, the chemical states and surface compositions of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS and PtNi NF were investigated using XPS. The binding energies of 161.48 eV and 162.48 eV shown in Fig. 6 a are assigned to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. Fig. 6b shows two peaks at the binding energies of 405.08 eV and 411.88 eV, belonging to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 for Cd2+ in CdS, respectively. In Fig. 6c, Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 ascribed to zero-valent Pt were fitted at the binding energies of 71.22 eV and 74.32 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni 2p peaks in Fig. 6d at the binding energies of 856.15 eV and 873.82 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of Ni2+ in Ni(OH)2, respectively. And the peaks at binding energies of 861.56 eV and 879.51 eV are assigned to the satellite peaks of Ni 2p. The above XPS results confirmed that PtNi NF was successfully loaded on the surface of CdS, and Ni(OH)2 was simultaneously formed. To deeply investigate the chemical state changes of PtNi NF after being loaded on CdS, the XPS study of PtNi NF was also conducted. The Pt 4f spectrum exhibits two contributions, Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, located at 71.89 eV and 75.26 eV (shown in Fig. 6e respectively, which can be indexed to Pt0. As shown in Fig. 6f, there are two peaks located at 855.79 eV and 873.52 eV, indexed to Ni2+ of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively. In addition, the peaks located at 861.01 eV and 879.48 eV are assigned to the XPS satellite peaks of Ni 2p. Consequently, the binding energies of Pt 4f and Ni 2p in PtNi NF were shifted from 71.89 eV to 71.22 eV and from 855.79 eV to 856.15 eV, respectively after the formation of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS. Furthermore, XPS reveals that the ratio of Pt to Ni on the surface of PtNi NF and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, are 1:4.8 and 1:10, respectively. The increase of surface Ni content also confirms the formation of Ni(OH)2, which is consistent with TEM results. Finally, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated, based on which the specific surface areas and pore properties were calculated (Fig. 7 . PtNi NF/CdS was prepared via same photodecomposition technique except that (NH4)2SO3 aqueous solution was replaced by 20% (V/V) latic acid aqueous solution. It is seen that all curves shown type II adsorption isotherm and the pore size distribution ranges from 2 to 16 nm (Fig. 7b. The BET surface areas of CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, PtNi NF/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS are 3.241 m2/g, 4.375 m2/g, 4.557 m2/g and 5.511 m2/g, respectively. Compared with pure CdS, the surface area of Pt-based cocatalyst decorated CdS increased obviously."
10,Hydrogen generation evolution,"3.2 Hydrogen generation evolution Fig. 8 a, b exhibits the effect of loading amount of PtNi NF on the H2 generation rate of CdS. With the loading amount of PtNi NF increased within 0.5–2 wt%, the H2 evolution rate of CdS increased, and reached to its peak value 44.05 mmol/h/g (QE = 58.89%, λ = 420 nm) as the loading amount is 2 wt%. When the loading amount of PtNi NF was higher than 2 wt%, the hydrogen generation rate reduced. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 8c, the H2 evolution rate of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst is increased in the first 2 h, and then stabilized over the following 3 h. This experimental phenomenon indicated that the formation of Ni(OH)2 is in the first 2 h, which is consistent with the HRTEM characterization (Fig. 5. In order to investigate the mechanism of cocatalyst Pt NF@Ni(OH)2, photocatalytic hydrogen generation reactions were also performed in lactic acid aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 8d, the hydrogen generation rate of PtNi Octa/CdS, PtNi NF/CdS, Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS with the same PtNi concentration (2 wt% of CdS photocatalyst dosage) are 20.7 mmol/h/g, 25.9 mmol/h/g, 33.3 mmol/h/g, respectively. PtNi NF increases the proportion of atoms exposed on the surface, and thus enhances its performance in photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the presence of CdS under visible light. As Ni(OH)2 formed a semi-enclosed structure around the residual Pt NF, the hydrogen generation rate is significantly increased. Ni(OH)2 has been reported to function as cocatalysts for water splitting affording hydrogen and oxygen or for organic pollutant degrading in water and air[34–36]. It is thought that CdS/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure benefits the separation of photo-induced carriers of CdS, and accelerates the hydrogen generation rate. Considering the high surface area of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, we suggested that its excellent photocatalytic performance is, to some extent, attributed to the high active sites for hydrogen generation reaction. The cyclic H2 evolution test was carried out to evaluate the stability of the as-prepared photocatalyst, considering that the stability is another key factor of CdS photocatalysts. Typically, photocatalyst was filtered and dried after one cycle, then dispersed in 1 M (NH4)2SO3 solution for the next cycle, each cycle lasted for 5 h for a total of 4 cycles, and the H2 evolution rate was measured after the activity has stabilized. What can be clearly seen in Fig. 9 a is that the activity of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS could be still retained at a high level after four H2 evolution test cycles. To be specific, an increasing trend of H2 evolution rate can be observed with extending photocatalytic reaction time at the beginning of photocatalytic reaction, which is probably attributed to the gradual formation of Ni(OH)2 shell. Fig. 9b shows the H2 evolution rate from the 1st to the 4th cycle, 44.05, 42.63, 41.23 and 37.88 mmol/h/g. The H2 evolution rate of the fourth run is 85.99% of the initial run, which is possibly due to the photocatalyst loss during filtration and photo-corrosion of CdS. These results reveal that Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS possesses good durability under the photocatalytic process. In summary, as-prepared Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS shows high activity and stability toward photocatalytic hydrogen reaction from water-splitting."
11,Electrochemical measurement,"3.3 Electrochemical measurement Recently, it has been proved that the catalytic performance of a catalyst can be improved by increasing its specific surface area[37] because the surface area of the catalyst is proportional to the active sites on the catalyst[38]. To confirm that the cocatalyst PtNi NF with nanoframe structure can improve the H2 evolution rate of CdS, the H2 evolution current density of CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS was measured by LSV, as shown in Fig. 10 a. The results indicate that the H2 evolution current density of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS is larger than that of pure CdS and PtNi Octa/CdS. which could be attributed to the excellent photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation ability of the former. Furthermore, Tafel plots of pure CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS were transformed from the LSV results, as displayed in Fig. 10b. It is apparent that photocatalyst with surface modification of PtNi NF has the lowest H2 evolution overpotential (0.29 V) compared to pure CdS (0.81 V) and PtNi Octa/CdS (0.42 V) samples. In addition to H2 evolution overpotential, charge separation efficiency is also one of the most important factors to evaluate the catalytic performance of photocatalyst because it determines the photocurrent density of photocatalyst[39]. Accordingly, the transient photocurrent response curves were recorded in Fig. 11 a under visible light irritation for several light on–off cycles. The photocurrent density under illumination is in the order of: CdS < PtNi Octa/CdS < PtNi NF/CdS − 0 h < PtNi NF/CdS − 2 h < Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, showing that Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS has a better charge separation ability than those of CdS and PtNi Octa/CdS. Meanwhile, with the increase of reaction time, the photocurrent density of PtNi NF/CdS was also improved, revealing that the formation of Ni(OH)2 is conductive to the capture of photogenerated electrons. Next, the Nyquist plots (Fig. 11b of CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS were collected to compare the charge-transfer resistance at the surface of these materials. It is well known that the radius of Nyquist plots is proportional to the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and inversely proportional to the photocatalytic reaction rate[40]. The semicircle radius of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS is smaller than CdS and PtNi Octa/CdS, due to the reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of the Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, which greatly improved the hydrogen evolution performance of photocatalyst."
12,Spectral analysis,"3.4 Spectral analysis The optical properties of the photocatalysts were evaluated by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 12 a, CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS all display UV − vis absorption threshold at about 533 nm, which is supported by the band gap (2.3 eV) of CdS, also implying that the cocatalyst was only modified on the surface of CdS. Besides, the light absorption intensity of PtNi Octa/CdS and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS was obviously increased in the range of 550–800 nm, indicating that the light absorption capacity of CdS was enhanced, which is beneficial to photocatalytic hydrogen production. Moreover, Fig. 12b shows the lifetime curves of the various photocatalysts excited at 407 nm, revealing that the average radiative lifetime of pure CdS, PtNi Octa/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS are 6319.6 ns, 8340.22 ns, and 8982.19 ns, respectively (Table 1 . The short lifetime indicates the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, the longest lifetime of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS implies that the Pt NF and Ni(OH)2 have a strong ability to capture photogenerated electrons, and can minimize the recombination of carriers. This is consistent with the results from hydrogen evolution test and electrochemical measurement."
13,Electron spin resonance analysis,"3.5 Electron spin resonance analysis Electron spin resonance (ESR) is usually used to confirm the active species in the photocatalytic reaction[41]. Photogenerated electron (e-) is a very important active species and plays an important role in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution[42]. It could react with the free radical trapping agent, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) with strong paramagnetic properties to produce a non-paramagnetic substance, TEMPOH, which only shows weak ESR signal[43]. Therefore, the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be verified by the strength of ESR signal. That is, the lower the ESR signal intensity, the more the photogenerated electrons can be transferred to the surface active sites to reduce carrier recombination[44]. Herein, ESR technique was used to investigate the charges transfer ability of pure CdS, PtNi NF/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS under different irradiation time (Fig. 13 . In the absence of irradiation there are no changes in ESR signal intensity of all the photocatalysts (Fig. 13a. As displayed in Fig. 13b, after the catalysts were irradiated for 5 min, their ESR signal intensity were significantly weakened, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons were produced under irradiation to react with TEMPO, resulting in the decline of ESR signal. In Fig. 13c, the intensity of ESR signal was further weakened after 10 min of illumination due to the same reason as above. The signal intensity is in the order of CdS > PtNi NF/CdS > Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS, which is consistent with the results of electrochemical characterization and PL lifetime tests. This proves that the formation of Ni(OH)2 can provide multiple paths for charge transport, which reduces the recombination of charge carriers and enhances the hydrogen evolution activity."
14,Mechanism analysis,"3.6 Mechanism analysis The electrons transfer is driven by the difference between cocatalyst and semiconductor in photocatalyst. In order to further study the electron transfer in photocatalysts. The work functions (Φ) of the samples was measured by UPS, as shown in Fig. 13d, the work functions of CdS, PtNi NF/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS is located at 3.85 eV, 4.86 eV, and 5.01 eV (vs. vacuum level), respectively. As is known to all, work function is the difference between the vacuum level (Evac ) and the Fermi level (EF )[45,46]. The Fermi levels of the samples are estimated as follows: E F = E vac - Φ If we assume that the vacuum level is 0 eV, the corresponding fermi level of CdS, PtNi NF/CdS, and Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS are calculated to be −3.85 eV, −4.86 eV, and −5.01 eV (vs. vacuum level), respectively. Obviously, the EF of Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS is more negative than CdS and PtNi NF/CdS, indicating that electrons might migrate from CdS to PtNi NF to achieve Fermi level equilibrium. Then, with the formation of Ni(OH)2, a new Fermi level equilibrium was established among CdS, Pt NF, and Ni(OH)2. Based on the above characterization results, a dual transport route of photogenerated electrons of the Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst was proposed in Fig. 14 . In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, (1) electrons from CdS are captured by PtNi NF, and then transferred to Ni(OH)2. The Pt atoms at the vertices and edges form coordinated bond with the migrated Ni ions due to their unsaturated coordination, which is very beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from Pt NF to Ni(OH)2 and the separation of photogenerated carriers of CdS; (2) a heterojunction is formed between CdS and Ni(OH)2, so that photogenerated electrons can be transferred directly from CdS to Ni(OH)2 across the CdS-Ni(OH)2 interface. In this case, Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 cocatalyst can minimize the recombination of carriers, and effectively improve the hydrogen evolution performance of CdS. Table 2 lists the researches of Pt-based cocatalyst coupled with CdS in hydrogen generation from water-splitting in recent years. It’s seen that the composition, morphology, and size of cocatalyst are the key factors to its photocatalytic performance. This study supplies a new strategy for the design of Pt-based cocatalyst, the novel cocatalyst Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 sets up multiple-path for electrons transfer and separation."
15,Conclusion,"The modification of CdS has always been one of the hotspots in the field of hydrogen production from water splitting by solar energy. This study proposes a new structure of so-called frame@semi-shell (Pt NF@Ni(OH)2) for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light. First, compared with PtNi Octa, PtNi NF possesses higher interface energy due to the high proportion of surface atoms and highly unsaturated coordination of Pt atoms, which is conducive to capture photogenerated electrons of CdS. Second, the introduction of Ni produces a synergistic effect between Pt and Ni to further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS. Third, a heterojunction is formed between the hemispherical Ni(OH)2 shell and CdS sheets, which constitute an additional way to separate photogenerated electrons and holes of CdS. The experimental results shows that the Pt NF@Ni(OH)2/CdS photocatalyst possesses excellent hydrogen production performance under visible light. The transient state fluorescence and ESR results further reveal that Pt NF@Ni(OH)2 is beneficial to prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in CdS and improving its photochemical conversion efficiency. The study in this work has provided a novel strategy for the preparation of highly efficient photocatalysts in the production of clean energies."
