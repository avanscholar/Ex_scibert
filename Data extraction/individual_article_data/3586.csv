0,Introduction,"Jet fuel consumption is approximately 1.5–1.7billion barrels per year world-widely, of which accounts for ca. 9% of petroleum refining products [1]. With the increasing concerns of environment and energy issues, renewable bio-jet fuels from biomass are considered as potential alternatives to petroleum-derived jet fuel [2–4]. So far, hydrotreating esters and fatty acids process (HEFA) is a relatively mature technology for bio-jet fuel production commercially [4,5]. However, the limited availability of fatty/oil feedstock has restricted HEFA’s development [6,7]. Industrial and academic attention is focusing on the substitute process using lignocellulosic biomass via thermo- or bio-chemical decomposition technology [8,9]. The produced intermediates such as syngas, alcohols, bio-oil and sugars would be converted to bio-jet fuels by further fermentative or catalytic process [10,11]. Recently special attention is on bio-jet fuel production in aqueous phase due to the mild hydrothermal condition for acidic or enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass [12]. Various hydrolysis derivatives, such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), methyl furfural and levulinic acid (LA), and the corresponding catalytic conversion pathways have been intensively investigated [13–16]. Although bio-jet fuel production under hydrothermal condition is expected to improve process energy efficiency and its economy, few concrete results have been reported via techno-economic investigation, especially for pilot- or demo-scale facilities [17–19]. The integrated biofuel fuel process needs to optimize feedstock component, platform chemicals and conversion pathways to minimize cost and increase yield [20]. The efforts on exploring novel bio-jet fuel production process and evaluating first-of-a-kind facilities are still in urgent. Using acetone, furfural and LA for aldol condensation reaction to obtain oxygenated precursors of bio-jet fuel with increased carbon-chain has been studied in our group [21,22]. The pioneering pilot facility with bio-jet fuel capacity of 0.13ML/a was built in Liaoning Province, China. The test runs in this facility have been carried out to obtain useful information for process simulation. The aim of this study is to perform a pilot-scale process design and simulation of this unique bio-jet fuel production technology that uses hemicellulose-derived furfural and cellulose-derived LA by two-step corncob decomposition, together with its techno-economic analysis. The novelty of this conversion pathway is that both cellulose and hemicellulose in corncob could be utilized, which increases remaining carbon in bio-jet fuel precursor via aldol condensation reaction between furfural and LA. This process includes the consecutive steps: two-step decomposition of corncob to furfural and LA, aldol condensation of these derivatives to oxygenated precursors of bio-jet fuel and the subsequent hydro-processing to produce jet fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8–C15). Techno-economic analysis agglomerates process information from the public domain and our lab experiment results, which was used for process simulation by Aspen Plus. Quantitative results of mass and energy were generated for economic analysis of a pioneering facility with production capacity of 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel. Economic analysis was to estimate both capital and operating expenses of bio-jet fuel (OPEX). Single-point cost sensitivity of major expenses on OPEX, such as feedstock price, catalyst lifetime and chemical used, was discussed. Economies of facility capacity scale of 1.3ML/a, 6.5ML/a and 13ML/a, on minimum selling price of bio-jet fuel (MSPB), were also studied under different discount rate and incentive policy condition."
1,Methods,"The process design and simulation was performed using ASPEN PLUS software to obtain material and energy balance data, which also assist in determining fixed capital investment (FCI), OPEX and MSPB. Corncob was used as feedstock and its composition was 39.2% cellulose, 36.9% xylan, 16.5% lignin, 3.3% ash, 4.1% of other compounds, on a dry weight basis [23]. The moisture content of the feedstock is 20%. The final products are jet-fuel range hydrocarbons (C8 to C15)."
2,Process flowsheet,"2.1 Process flowsheet The integrated process is made up of four main areas as shown in Fig. 1 . It includes oxygenated precursor production from two-step corncob decomposition and catalytic conversion I of aldol condensation in batch reactor (A100, A200 and A300), catalytic conversion II of hydro-processing (low-temperature hydrogenation in autoclave reactor, high temperature hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and upgrading in fixed-bed reactor, A400), wastewater treatment & solvent distillation (A500 & A800) and burner/boiler (A700). The auxiliary of storage and utilities (A600 and A900) is also included in process."
3,Lab experiments,"2.2 Lab experiments The steam-stripping tests were carried out in a 1L tank at 175°C and 0.9MPa, preloaded with soaked corncob at solid-to-liquid ratio of 2.5 by 8wt% H2SO4 . The furfural-containing vapor stream was condensed by cooling water, which was further concentrated. The steam-stripping residual (SSR) was further hydrolyzed by adding 9-fold of 0.24M H2SO4 solution at 180°C to produce LA. Insoluble residue, mainly of lignin, was filtrated. Primary produced hydrolysate was added by lime to remove acid, followed by filtration and concentration. The concentrated hydrolysate was mixed with the concentrated furfural solution at furfural to LA ratio of 2.0 under the existence of basic catalyst. Dilute H2SO4 solution was used after aldol condensation reaction finished, by which the insoluble carboxylic acids of oxygenated precursors with long carbon-chain were separated from the aqueous phase. After filtration and drying, the collected yellow particle solid was dissolved in solvent. Hydro-processing step included low-temperature pre-hydrogenation in batch reactor (150°C, 4MPa, 33wt%) and high-temperature HDO (280°C, 4MPa, LHSV=0.5h−1) and upgrading (300°C, 4MPa, LHSV=1.0h−1) in fixed-bed reactor for oxygen removal from the precursor and bio-jet fuel production. The catalyst used for pre-hydrogenation, HDO and upgrading was 3wt%Ru/C, 8wt%Ru/Al2O3 and 8wt% Ru-M/Al2O3 respectively. All the catalysts was prepared in lab"
4,Process simulation of a 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel facility,"2.3 Process simulation of a 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel facility The information used for process simulation were obtained from lab results below, experience from our test runs, literatures and expert advices [24]. Steam to furfural ratio was 30 for furfural stripping at 175°C and furfural yield was 59.5mol% (based on hemicellulose amount in corncob). Furfural recovery from dilute furfural solution was 95% during modeling distillation, of which resulted in furfural content of 80wt% in concentrated solution. The solid-to-liquid ratio was 1:9 for hydrolysis at H2SO4 concentration of 0.24M H2SO4. LA yield was 34.4mol% (based on cellulose amount in corncob). pH value was set as 7 to calculate lime amount requirement to remove SO4 2 − from the primary hydrolysate. The yield ratio of C15 oxygenates (C15H12O5) and C10 oxygenates (C10H10O4) was at a weight ratio of 9.0 during modeling aldol condensation, resulting from excessive amount of furfural [25]. Three kinds of double bonds (alkene CC, furan CC and ketone CO bonds) in the oxygenated precursors was supposed to be saturated for the low-temperature pre-hydrogenation modeling. C8–C15 alkane yield was set at 51wt% after high temperature HDO and upgrading treatment. R-Yield reactor type was used in hydro-processing simulation since the more detailed kinetic data was not available."
5,Economic modeling,"2.4 Economic modeling The capital investment (TCI) was estimated using the factored estimation method, and might include uncertainties of as much as ±30% [18]. The method started with costs of major equipment based on our pilot facility, literature and expert query. The scaling exponent is different for various equipment, but usually in the range of 0.5–0.8 as in Ref. [26]. Total direct cost (TDC) was calculated based on the total equipment cost using the Langer coefficient method. The variable operation costs were determined based on materials input and output from the ASPEN simulation and publicly quoted prices. Fixed operation cost was based on the labors for facility operation and maintenance. And the operation expense (OPEX) was the results of variable and fixed operation expense. MSPB was calculated based on zero net present value method (NPV) with discount rate, 100% equity and facility lifetime of 30years. Annual working hours of 7200h and depreciation period of 8years were used in economic analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Lab result analysis,"3.1 Lab result analysis Corncob and corn stover are favorable feedstock for furfural products due to the high hemicellulose content, of which corncob was chosen for bio-jet fuel production in this process. Lab experiments of the major areas of this process were performed. 3.1.1 Furfural and LA production by two-step corncob decomposition The effect of steam usage on furfural yield (based on hemicellulose) and furfural concentration in the condensed solution is shown in Fig. 2 . of furfural concentration is 6.25wt% with low furfural yield at steam to furfural ratio of 10. Furfural yield increased with the ratio increase, derived from the increased furfural recovery in the batch hydrolyzer, which is not obvious when the ratio was higher than 30. While furfural concentration decreased due to the condensation of quite amount of steam [24]. Considering the energy cost for steam generation, steam to furfural ratio of 30 with furfural yield of 59.5mol% was used for process simulation. LA concentration in the primary hydrolysate and its yield increased with prolonged hydrolysis time from 0.5h to 2.0h, as shown in Fig. 3 . The same phenomena was reported in other literatures [27,28] . It is due to the subsequent decomposition of cellulose in acid catalysis conversions, which is primarily decomposed to glucose, then to 5-HMF, and eventually to LA. LA yield decreased slightly when hydrolysis time was more than 2h in this context. It might attribute to the side reactions of LA decomposition under acidic hydrothermal condition, such as re-condensation of hydrolysis intermediates and LA to humins as reported by Hu [29]. 5-HMF concentration was as low as 0.5wt%, which indicated its instantaneous conversion to LA and humins. It was reported that LA production could not be significantly increased at CSF values higher than 50, which is a power function of the effects of reaction time, temperature and acid catalyst on LA production. The equation is as below, as provided by Ref. [30]. CSV = t 0.2 ∗ exp ( ( T - 100 ) / 14.75 ) ∗ [ Acid ] 1.8 In this context, CSV value was calculated to be 45 at 2h hydrolysis time, 180°C and 0.24M H2SO4. It could be deduced that it is hard to further increase LA yield by using more severe condition. So LA yield of 34.4mol% was used for process simulation in Section 3.2. 3.1.2 Aldol condensation reaction between furfural and LA solutions Aldol condensation reaction lasted 2h in a batch reactor under basic catalyst to maximum furfural and LA conversion. The transparent solution of the produced C10–C15 carboxylates became muddy simultaneously as dilute H2SO4 solution was added, which corresponded to the formation of insoluble carboxylic acid from soluble C10–C15 carboxylates under H2+ ion interchange effect from H2SO4. The elemental analysis and GPC results of the collected yellow solids of bio-jet fuel’s oxygenated precursors under two reaction conditions are shown in Table1 . Obviously, neither of the two solid precursors matched the results of model monomer precursors I&II or dimer precursor III, as shown in Fig. 4 . The solid precursors should be the complex mixture with various condensation degrees, indicated by molecular distribution peaks from GPC analysis. Compared with the solid precursor I, precursor II, produced by concentrated furfural solution of 80% with LA under ambient condition, does not contain heavy compounds with molecular weight higher than 750. The content for compounds with molecular weight above 500 was only 7.27%, which is 34.6% in precursor I. The major species in both precursor mixtures are those with molecular weight of 370, which are 63.9% and 68.3%, respectively. It was reported that side polymerization reactions could occur under basic condition [31]. It could be deduced that Michael condensation between unsaturated CC bonds of the primarily produced monomer precursor I&II was likely to happen in this context. The low furfural content might have resulted in inefficient contact of furfural with monomer precursor. So self-condensation reaction between monomer precursors by CC bonds was likely to accelerate heavy component production in solid precursor I. Light compounds with molecular weight lower than 300 had a content of 19.6% in solid precursor II, which indicated the existence of monomer precursor in precursor II. Combing with its elemental results, similar with that of dimer precursor, a mixture precursor with weight ratio of 9 for dimer and mono precursor was chosen for process simulation. 3.1.3 Hydro-processing operation in lab After low-temperature hydrogenation at 150°C to saturate double bonds of alkene CC, furan CC and acyl CO in the precursors, HDO reaction of the hydrogenated precursor was fed to a fixed-bed HDO reactor to remove oxygen. For further O removal from crude oil, upgrading was applied in another fixed-bed reactor. The yield of bio-jet fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8–C15) was 51wt% and carbon selectivity was 72mol% in lab test, based on the solid precursors. According to GC–MS results of the bio-jet fuel sample, 27 kinds of organics were chosen as the surrogates of bio-jet fuel. The distribution of different species is shown in Table 2 , containing n-paraffin, iso-paraffin, cycloalkane, aromatics and oxygenates of 18.9wt%, 60.1wt%, 15.55wt%, 3.8wt% and 1.65wt% respectively. The calculated elemental content of the model bio-jet fuel, is 84.7wt%C, 15.0wt%H and 0.23wt%O."
8,Material and energy analysis of a pilot facility with 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel production,"3.2 Material and energy analysis of a pilot facility with 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel production Process analysis gives insights into input and output of energy and materials, which provides information for the feasibility analysis of the process. Material and energy balance of a 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel project is evaluated here as first-of-a-kind facility using the above process, derived from ASPEN PLUS model (see Table 3 ). Carbon, water, steam and electricity play important role within the facility, and are analyzed too. The yield of oxygenated precursors of bio-jet fuel, after filtration and washing, is 75wt% of the input furfural and LA at mass flow of 456kg/h. This low yield was chosen because the oxygenated precursors had small particle size, which caused difficulty in collection in lab experiments and test runs. The precursors were supposed to be 100% converted to the corresponding hydrogenated precursors by low temperature pre-hydrogenation treatment. The carbon selectivity to CO, CO2, CH4, C2–C7 and C8–C15 was 1.4%, 8.2%, 10.8%, 7.2%, 72% respectively, for high temperature HDO, according to the result from our lab experiments. Oxygen was further removed after upgrading treatment, which contributed 7.4wt% loss of HDO products. The final bio-jet fuel yield was139kg/h or 0.125tonne/tonne dried corncob. All the input carbon in the process derived from corncob feed. The closure on the carbon balance was 99.6% with small errors in Table 4 , due to the imperfect stoichiometry used to generate microbial cell mass in wastewater treatment and minor carbon deposition on catalyst. Of the carbon input, 22.9% carbon atoms leave as bio-jet fuel. 69% carbon atoms leave in the combustion exhaust, which derived from the burning of by-products (lignin, tail gas, and CH4 from wastewater treatment) to form CO2. Only the carbohydrate component of corncob in this process can be converted to furfural and LA, and then to bio-jet fuel. Of the input carbon flow from corncob, 380kg/h of carbon flow derives from carbohydrates. The current carbon recovery in bio-jet fuel is 31.0% of theoretical input of carbohydrate carbon. The relatively low carbon yield was due to the conservatively low yield of furfural, LA, precursors and jet fuel in process simulation of this first-of-a-kind pioneering facility. Water balance analysis is shown in Table 5 . Water enters in the process via feedstock, raw chemicals and reactions, et al. Water is consumed in wastewater treatment (WWT) and loss in the WWT brine, solid waste disposal, oxygenated precursor drying or evaporation. Acid hydrolysis residue, which was supposed to be combusted for steam generation, contained about 40% water. This part of water lost from combustor exhaust. Majority of makeup water (80%) is consumed by cooling tower evaporation. It is due to the high cooling duties, such as the cooling of streams from furfural stripping units, acid hydrolysis units and concentration units. In addition, the optimization of heat integration was not performed in process simulation due to intermittent operation of some process units. For example, corncob decomposition reaction is supposed to occur in a hydrolyzer, which is hard for heat recovery. Consumptive water usage is 12.3kg per liter of bio-jet fuel produced in this process. Steam usage analysis is shown in Table 6 , based on a 1.3ML/a facility. Steam striping for furfural production is the largest consumer due to the high steam to furfural ratio for maximum furfural yield. For hydrolysis operation, steam is designed to inject directly into SSR stream. Steam optimization was not strictly performed in this simulation, which would not be practical in a small scale facility. And water content in the used solvent after HDO area was about 10%, which need to be removed by distillation. About 15.2kg steam per liter bio-jet fuel would be used for concentration of the raw furfural and LA solutions. Low-temperature pre-hydrogenation is operated at 150°C with steam heating, of which steam usage is minor. The last two streams of steams may be returned to the process to reduce water usage. Table 7 shows electricity consumption by process area. Due to the relatively small production capacity, it is supposed that electricity is purchased in this process simulation. The area of HDO&upgrading has consumed the largest fraction of electricity for high temperature reaction. Although quite amount of the equipment was used for furfural&LA production, electricity consumed in this area is relatively low of 0.30KWh/L bio-jet fuel due to the intermittent operation for steam stripping and hydrolysis. Electricity consumed on air compressor and water pump of boiler area is 0.30KWh/L bio-jet fuel. Compared to the similar studies that produced ethanol by biochemical process (1.03KWh/L ethanol) [32], the electricity consumption in this context is high. It is due to the extra processing steps involved in hydrocarbon fuel production instead of ethanol. This process simulation did not include H2 generation area. That decreased overall electricity consumption compared with the other report (2.11KWh/L bio-hydrocarbon fuel, in situ H2 generation), using the process of acid/enzyme decomposition and catalytic conversion of sugars [18]. Energy balance result is shown in Table 8 , to analyze the bio-jet fuel energy to the potential energy from corncob (on lower heating value basis). The streams that cannot be burned, such as water, H2SO4 and lime, have positive potential energy due to the evaporation of water. The other input energy flows include that from H2, solvent and electricity. All acid hydrolysis residue, obtained after hydrolysis, was burned to generated steam. The purchased electricity and H2 increase potential energy input. Energy input from H2 is about 18.6% of total energy inputs. The energy loss from the cooling tower is significant. And ambient heat losses are also large, which include the wastewater treatment, air-cooled condenser. Combustion exhaust attributes the third largest energy losses. The energy available from bio-jet fuel is 34.7% of corncob energy content. Since bio-jet fuel energy can only derive from the energy content of carbohydrate components in corncob in this process, which is −12734MJ/h. That means only 73% of corncob’s combustion energy could be used to produce bio-jet fuel. In this way the percent of carbohydrate energy in corncob recovered as bio-jet fuel is about 47.6%, higher than that 31% of carbohydrate carbon recovered as bio-jet fuel as discussed above. It can be concluded that this process has increased product energy density, aiming at bio-jet fuel production."
9,Economic analysis,"3.3 Economic analysis 3.3.1 TCI analysis Capital investment is evaluated as mentioned in section 2.4. Base prices of similar equipment were obtained from the Machinery& Electronic Products Quotation Manual, using polynomial fitting method for the current process. The plant is designed to incorporate in a refinery, where pressurized hydrogen is purchased, so there is no investment on reforming section, different from the analysis on HEFA process [33]. Table 9 shows investment cost of a 1.3ML/a facility by major process area. The fixed capital and TCI is ca. $3.73MM and $3.96MM, respectively. Converting corncob to oxygenated precursor is the most expensive part of the process, which is 28% of total equipment investment and 16% of TCI. This is due to the long operation time for steam stripping and hydrolysis of corncob in batch reactor. That means multiply hydrolyzers are needed in the process, of which expensive acid-erosion resistant material is required. Also the large number of the auxiliary equipment, including pumps, filters, condensers and concentrators, also increases the direct cost in this area. 23.7% of total equipment cost is spent on wastewater treatment, derived from high usage of steam and water for furfural and LA production. Most of them end as wastewater after concentration and aldol condensation reaction. Problems associated with high water treatment amount can be avoided by choosing highly active hydrothermal condition for biomass decomposition. Recycling the primary hydrolysate for the next batch of corncob decomposition is also a feasibility solution to decrease water usage. Only 14.5% of equipment cost is spent on hydro-processing area due to the relatively maturity of hydrogenation technology and the usage of purchased H2 from nearby refinery. It has been reported a cost of $1.83 per annual liter of alcohol with a capacity of 230ML/a and a cost of $2.37 per annual liter of bio-jet fuel with a capacity of 380ML/a, respectively[17,32]. The present study estimates cost of $3.05 per annual liter of bio-jet fuel for the capacity of 1.3MML/a. The cost is higher due to complexities of the process compared to ethanol production. The relatively small capacity scale of bio-jet fuel also results in its high cost here. Due to the scattered planting tradition in China, it is impractical to collect corncob in large scale as that in U.S. So the factored estimation method is applied to calculate TCI of the pilot facilities with the capacities of 1.3ML/a, 6.5ML/an and 13ML/a. Economy of scale of bio-jet fuel production is shown in Fig. 5 , where the capital cost per annual liter with different capacity is plotted against the capacity. With the scale enlargement, TCI of the three facilities is $3.96MM. $10MM and $14MM and the corresponding cost is $3.05, $1.52, $1.08 per annual liter of bio-jet fuel for capacities of 1.3ML/a, 6.5ML/a and 13ML/a respectively. The expenses is lower than those in the literature that estimated $4.7 per annual liter of jet fuel for a larger capacity of 76ML/a, which had a capital cost estimation of $356MM for the facility. The cheap capital investment in China seems to increase bio-jet fuel production economy, even at a smaller production capacity. 3.3.2 Bio-jet fuel expense estimation Table 10 shows the annual variable operation expense for a pilot facility with 1.3ML/a capacity, which is $1.40MM. H2 here was purchased at $0.12/Nm3 from nearby refinery. H2 requirement in this process is substantially high due to the oxygen removal from the precursors to produce hydrocarbon products. The annual expenses on feedstock, HDO catalyst and H2 are the three main contributors to the total variable operation costs. The expense on H2SO4, lime and basic catalyst was also high, due to the unrecyclable chemicals used for corncob decomposition and aldol condensation reactions. The utilization of solid acidic or basic catalyst to reduce chemical use and new technologies for platform chemical production should be investigated for efficient fuel production. The annual fixed operation expense is $0.14MM and the operation expense (OPEX) of bio-jet fuel was $1.18/L. Expense breakdown for a 1.3ML/a bio-jet fuel facility is shown in Fig. 6 . Expenses on corncob, catalytic catalyst and H2 are 23%, 19% and 16% respectively. Chemical expense for oxygenated precursor production, such as H2SO4 and lime, is ca. 12% of $0.14/L. Expenses on electricity and solvent are also significant, which are 11% and 7% of OPEX, respectively. The results of single-point sensitivity analysis of the major expense breakdown on the change of OPEX are shown in Fig. 7 . Corncob price, HDO catalyst lifetime, H2 price, hydrolysis acid concentration and solvent consumption ratio is $45/tonne, 1year, $0.12/Nm3, 0.24M and 8% under the base case, which results in OPEX of $1.18/L as discussed above. The catalytic lifetime is the most important factor for OPEX change, which could increase bio-jet fuel OPEX of $0.21/L when it is decreased to 0.5year. On the other hand, the search of cheap metal loaded catalyst, such as Ni-based HDO catalysts is another effect way to decrease OPEX, since hydro-processing catalysts applied in this simulation are all noble metal catalysts. Corncob price was the second factor that affect bio-jet fuel OPEX, which chould increase bio-jet fuel OPEX by $0.1/L when its price increases from $45/tonne to $60/tonne. MSPB are plotted in Fig. 8 , which decrease as facility capacity increases due to the scale economies. As the discount rate increases and taxes impose, economies of scale is more apparent. For the facility with small capacity of 1.3ML/a, MSFB is $1.36/L, $1.45/L and $1.62/L at discount rate of 7%, 10% and 15%, which decreases to the corresponding prices of $1.02/L, $1.05/L and $1.11/L for a 13.0ML/a facility. For comparison, the study in 2016 estimated MSFB is $0.93/L and $1.35/L with capacity of 380ML/a and 76ML/a respectively, with a discount rate of 10% and using alcohol-to-jet fuel pathways [17]. Another studies by national renewable energy laboratory of U.S estimated minimum hydrocarbon fuel selling prices (tax and depreciation included, 10% discount rate) of $1.13/L, $1.41/L and $1.07/L at the respective facility capacity of 158MML/a, 118MML/a and 215MML/a Refs. [18,34,35]. The process of gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis, acid/enzyme decomposition-bioconversion of sugars and acid/enzyme decomposition-catalytic conversion of sugars was applied in the above simulation respectively. The low MSPB at smaller facility capacity in this context should be due to the relatively low capital investment in China. Incentive policy was critical to promote bio-fuel development, especially for pilot or demonstration facilities [36,37]. MSPB at 10% discount rate for a 1.3ML/a facility in this context is of $1.55/L at 47% tax rate, which includes the general industrial taxes of income tax (25%), value-added tax (17%) and consumption tax (5%) in China. MSPB decreases to $1.48/L at 22% tax rate for a 1.3ML/a facility when income tax is waved, which is similar with the MSPB of $1.46/L for a 70ML/a facility at 10% discount rate using alcohol-to-jet pathway. Subsidy of $0.308/L is significant for MSPB, which could decrease 20% of the price. The lowest MSPB of $0.74/L with subsidy for 13ML/a facility is still higher than that of petroleum-derived jet fuel, which is about $0.37–0.43/L currently. However, the bio-jet fuel facility will be profitable under high jet fuel price condition, such as that of $181.6/barrel in July 2008. On the other hand, the low yield of platform chemicals, oxygenated precursor and bio-jet oil was very conservative in this process simulation as mentioned above, of which the pioneering conversion pathway in this process. With the optimization of this process, mass and energy consumption ratio should be greatly improved to increase the efficiency of this process in futrure."
10,Conclusion,"The design and process simulation of a pilot bio-jet fuel facility with capacity production of 1.3ML/a using a pioneering technology, including two-step corncob hydrotherma1 decomposition, aldol condensation of derived furfural and levulinic acid and hydro-processing of oxygenated precursor with long carbon-chain, was investigated. The conservatively yield design of furfural, LA, oxygenated precursor and bio-jet fuel-range hydrocarbons and lack of process optimization in this small-scale simulation have caused the high consumption of water, steam and electricity, compared with the other facilities for bio-hydrocarbon production with large capacity of above 50ML/a in the literatures. It consequently increases OPEX in this context. Economies of scale is obvious for a larger facility, of which MSPB at 10% discount rates are $1.45/L and $1.05/L for a 1.3ML/a facility and a 13ML/a facility respectively. The MSPB different increases to $0.46/L for the two different capacity facilities as 47% of tax rate is applied. The lowest MSPB of $0.74/L with subsidy for 13ML/a facility cannot compete with that of petroleum-derived jet fuel. So bio-jet fuel facility is currently unprofitable even by giving subsidy, especially for small scale plants. Therefore, optimization of this process to decrease material and utility consumption and increase bio-jet fuel yield is essential for this technology development. On the other hand, searching for the other efficient conversion technology and incentive policy enforcement are still in need for competitive bio-jet fuel production in future."
