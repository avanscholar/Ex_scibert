0,Introduction,"With the aggravation of environmental problems and energy crisis, hydrogen as a kind of environmental protection fuel has been paid more and more attention. Efforts have been made to develop various stable photocatalysts, such as In2S3, CdS, ZnIn2S4, etc. [1–6]. However, these photocatalysts have low photocatalytic activity due to their narrow solar spectral response and high photo-excited charge recombination rate, which hinders their practical application. One of the major challenges facing the world today is to explore efficient and stable visible light-driven catalysts and improve the efficiency of photo-catalyzes [7–9]. The narrow band-gap semiconductor CdIn2S4 can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen production because it has a band gap of 2.0 eV and a more negative conduction band potential than the H+/H2 reduction potential [10–13]. The high rate charge recombination of CdIn2S4 has a very low ability to decompose water. It has been reported in the literature that the construction of heterostructures is an effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity, which can reduce the recombination probability of surface electron-hole pairs, modify the surface defects in CdIn2S4 crystals [14,15]. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been widely used in photoelectric catalysis [16,17], energy storage [18–20] and super-capacitors [21–24] due to its excellent photoelectric properties. In addition, the edge defect caused by the exposure of the unsaturated S atom of MoS2 as the active site is more conducive to the adsorption of H2, which can be used as an efficient UV–visible light catalytic hydrogen production and improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution [17,25,26]. In this paper, we have prepared a novel flower-like CdIn2S4/MoS2 nanomaterials by a simple two-step hydrothermal method with cheap raw materials and without adding any stabilizer. The flower-like CdIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction exhibits excellent hydrogen production performance. The hydrogen production rate can reach 293 μmol g−1 h−1 when the MoS2 loading is 9%, which is 3.15 times that of the CdIn2S4 monomer. The nano-flower is a heterostructure loaded with a small amount of nano-molybdenum disulfide on the flower-like CdIn2S4, which has a shorter radial transport path and fewer defects, and is conducive to electron and hole transport. Part of the crystal structure of nano-MoS2 provides more exposure catalytic active sites for CdIn2S4. MoS2 is used as a co-catalyst to grow on the flower-like CdIn2S4. The plane-surface close contact promotes electron transfer, thus effectively reducing surface charge recombination and improving the catalytic performance of CdIn2S4."

3,"Synthesis of the CdIn2S4, MoS2 and CdIn2S4/MoS2 hetero-junction catalysts","2.2 Synthesis of the CdIn2S4, MoS2 and CdIn2S4/MoS2 hetero-junction catalysts The flower-like nano-materials CdIn2S4 was prepared by traditional hydrothermal synthesis. In a typical procedure for the synthesis of CdIn2S4 nano particles with a Cd/In ratio of 1:2, 1 mmol Cd(NO3)2, 2 mmol In(NO3)3 were successively added to a beaker containing 50 mL of deionized water during the stirring process, followed by 4 mmol TAA added to the above. Then the mixed solution was poured into a 50 mL PTFE lined reactor. The reaction was carried out at 180 ℃ for 24 h and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The yellow sediments obtained were washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol for several times and then dried in a 60 ℃ blast oven. The preparation process of MoS2 is as follows: firstly, 0.25 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O and 1.6 mmol thioacetamide were dissovled in 50 mL of deionized water under stirring in the open air; then the mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL PTFE lined reactor. After that the reaction was carried at 180 ℃ for 24 h and naturally cooled to room temperature. The black sediments (MoS2) were washed several times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and then placed in a 60 ℃ air-blast drying oven for overnight drying. CdIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction was prepared by simple hydrothermal method. The preparation process of sample 2CM is as follows: 237 mg CdIn2S4 monomer was placed in 50 mL deionized water, and the monomer was uniformly dispersed by ultrasonic for 30 min. Then, under the stirring condition, 10.88 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 21.76 mg TAA were added to the above mixed solution, and the ultrasonic continued for 30 min. Then the mixed solution was poured into a 50 mL PTFE lined reactor with high pressure that could withstand the reaction. The reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 24 h at a constant temperature, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The resulting yellowish-brown sediments were washed several times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and then placed in a 60 °C air-drying oven for overnight drying. It is worth noting that CdIn2S4, 7 mol% CdIn2S4/MoS2, 9 mol% CdIn2S4/MoS2, 11 mol% CdIn2S4/MoS2 and MoS2 are labeled as sample C, sample 1CM, sample 2CM, sample 3CM and sample M, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected on a Rigaku MinFlex II equipped with Cu Kα irradiation. The surface area and pore diameter were also determined by the BET method, using a Micromeritics apparatus, model ASAP 2020. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) operated at 200 kV to investigate the microstructure and lattice fringes of photocatalysts. Scanning electron microscope (SEM, GMINI 500) were used to identify the morphology and composition of the samples. The optical properties of the samples were characterized by UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS, Cary 5000). The valence states of the composite samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the binding energy was calibrated with the carbon signal of 284.8 eV as the reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on F96PR with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. Photocurrent (I-T) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) images were obtained from the CHI 660B electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode structure. The three electrode systems include reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode), working electrode (photoelectrode), counter electrode (Pt electrode). The photoelectrode was prepared by adding the sample (5 mg) into a solution containing water (500 μL), ethanol (450 μL) and 5 wt% Nafion solution (50 μL). After ultrasonic treatment for 2 h, the SnO2 conductive glass (FTO) doped with fluorine was uniformly coated with 50 μL suspension. Let dry in the air for 4 h. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source and 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement parameters were set as frequency: 10 MHz to 100 kHz, amplitude: 10 mV. The photocurrent response is obtained at a constant potential of + 0.7 V."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic performance of the composite was evaluated by measuring the photodegradation rate and stability of the composite. In the experiment, a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300) was used to simulate the visible light source. The light source was fixed 1 cm from the top of a cylindrical reactor 12 cm high and 7 cm in diameter. In the hydrogen production experiment, 50 mg photocatalyst was dispersed into the aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3, the reaction system was vacuumed by using a vacuum pump and the condensation cycle system was opened, and the system temperature was kept at about 5 ℃. After that, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiment was conducted. Every hour, external standard method was used to quantitatively detect and analyze the hydrogen content generated by gas chromatography. The hydrogen production efficiency of different samples was calculated according to the test results."
6,Results and discussion,"The crystal peaks detected in curve C correspond to hexagonal CdIn2S4 (JCPDS No. 27‑0060) [14,15,27]. In the XRD pattern of MoS2 (inset in Fig. 1a), these diffraction peaks at about 14.3°, 32.6° and 58.3° correspond to the (002), (100) and (110) crystal faces of hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS Nos: 37‑1492 [28]). There was no obvious characteristic peak of MoS2 in the XRD spectra of CdIn2S4/MoS2 complex, which may be due to the small particle size and high dispersion degree of MoS2 on the surface of CdIn2S4, leading to insensitivity to XRD characterization. The results are consistent with TEM images. As shown in Fig. 1, the sample 2CM lattice spacing is mainly 0.329 nm, 0.313 nm and 0.683 nm, corresponding to (311), (222) and (111) crystal planes respectively. From the (306) crystal plane of MoS2, it can be seen that the lattice spacing of CdIn2S4 particles on the outer surface of MoS2 crystal is 0.615 nm, indicating that MoS2 crystal and CdIn2S4 particles form a heterogeneous structure, which is consistent with the results of the XRD diffraction pattern. The SEM image of the sample is shown in Fig. S2, which shows a flower-like microsphere with a diameter of 1.4–1.5 µm at sample 2CM. The size of microspheres is smaller than that of C, 1CM and 2CM samples, and there are flake MoS2 nanocrystals on the surface; the spacing of crystal planes is 0.267 nm, which corresponds to the (400) plane of CdIn2S4 nanocrystals. This result is also consistent with the XRD pattern. In addition, EDX pattern (Fig. S2) demonstrates that the sample contains the signals of Cd, In, Mo and S elements in sample 2CM with the atomic mass percentage of 22.1:50.3:4.0:23.6, respectively, which once again confirmed that CdIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by simple hydrothermal method. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was used to characterize the texture properties of the photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 2, showing the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the photocatalyst. Obviously, according to IUPAC classification, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of CdIn2S4 photocatalyst belong to type Ⅳ, reflecting the presence of mesoporous structure in the sample. At the same time, the BET specific surface area and pore volume of sample 2CM were larger than that of sample C. For example, the sum of specific surface area of sample 2CM is 23.3 m2 g−1 and that of sample C is 21.37 m2 g−1. From the perspective of surface chemistry, the photocatalyst with higher BET specific surface area is conducive to the adsorption and separation of reactants and products on the active site of the catalyst, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. This can be confirmed by the photocatalytic activity results in the following paper. As shown in Fig. 3, the elemental composition and surface valence states of sample 2CM show the main signals of Cd, In, Mo and S, as well as the presence of C and O, respectively. The instrument used the surface adventitious carbon 1s peak of Be = 284.8 eV as a reference component to correct the binding energy of other elements present in the photocatalyst, which is mainly due to the mixing of carbon in the sample during preparation. The O1S peak in the total spectrum is related to the atmospheric oxygen absorbed by the sample during the analysis. The XPS comparison study shows that the valence analysis of the surface elements of heterojunction and the explanation of electron transfer mechanism in the sample 2CM photocatalyst system are supported. Fig. 3b and c shows the high-definition XPS spectra of Cd 3d and In3d, respectively. Two characteristic peaks of monomer CdIn2S4 at the binding energy of 405.03 eV and 411.78 eV can be observed, corresponding to the spin orbits of Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. Two characteristic peaks of monomer CdIn2S4 at the binding energy of 405.03 eV and 411.78 eV can be observed, corresponding to the spin orbits of Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. Cd2+ has been shown to be present in complexes. At the same time, two characteristic peaks are detected at 444.58 eV and 452.02 eV, which correspond to In 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin orbits, respectively, suggesting that In has a + 3 valence. Compared with the sample C, the positions of characteristic peaks of Cd 3d and In 3d in the sample 2CM show different degrees of deviation, which is mainly due to the interaction between the two materials after bonding. In addition, two characteristic peaks of the S 2p electron spectrum of CdIn2S4 are found in Fig. 3d, which are located at the binding energies of 161.63 eV and 162.78 eV, respectively, corresponding to the orbitals S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2. The energy difference between the two peaks is 1.2 eV, indicating that the valence state of sulfur ion is − 2 [15–17,29,30]. The characteristic peaks of S 2p in the composites were located at 161.58 eV and 162.73 eV, and the peaks were shifted about 0.14 eV to the lower binding energy compared with the monomer CdIn2S4. This phenomenon further supports the strong interaction between the two materials, which may be caused by the formation of MoS bond between the two materials. In Fig. 3e, the high-definition XPS map of Mo, there is a weak peak at the binding energy of 232.43 eV, located at 3d3/2, indicating that Mo4+ is dominant in MoS2, which is caused by the low content of MoS2 in sample 2CM. In addition, due to the existence of the 2 S peak, another peak with a binding energy of 229.18 eV was determined through the above XPS analysis, which proved that the CdIn2S4/MoS2 composite heterostructure has been successfully prepared. In an aqueous solution containing Na2S-Na2SO3 (sacrificed electron donor), the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CdIn2S4 and CdIn2S4/MoS2 under UV–visible light irradiation was evaluated as shown in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4b, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of sample C was about 93 μmol h−1 g−1, which was mainly due to the fact that sample C could not rapidly separate the photogenerated carriers. In the CdIn2S4/MoS2 system, the rate of hydrogen production increases with the increase of MoS2 loading. When the MoS2 loading is 9 mol%, the rate of hydrogen production reaches the maximum of 293 μmol h−1 g−1, which is more than 3 times of the rate of hydrogen production of sample C. When the amount of MoS2 is higher than 9% molar amount, increasing the amount of MoS2 will decrease the overall rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Although the hydrogen production rate of sample 3CM is only 155 μmol h−1 g−1, it is still higher than that of sample C, indicating that the construction of heterostructures using its photon absorption is very efficient. It is reported that the combination of MoS2 and semiconductor photocatalyst can improve the activity of hydrogen production in photocatalytic hydrolysis [31–33]. This is mainly because MoS2 is an excellent electron acceptor, which can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron holes and promote more photogenerated electrons to reach the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, the improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CdIn2S4/MoS2 can be attributed to the successful loading of MoS2 on the surface of CdIn2S4. In order to better evaluate the photo-stability of CdIn2S4/MoS2 hetero-structure composites, the photolysis water cycle experiment was carried out on the sample 2CM under UV–vis light irradiation ( Fig. 5a). The average rate of hydrogen production remained at 201.3 μmol h-1 g-1 after 16 h of UV–visible light irradiation, indicating that the nano-composite has excellent photo-catalytic stability. In addition, XRD comparison of sample 2CM was made before and after the cycle experiment (Fig. 5b), and it was found that after 4 cycle experiments, the XRD pattern of sample 2CM photo-catalyst did not show significant peak shift, indicating that the crystal structure of the sample could still maintain stable performance after a long time of photocatalytic reaction. To investigate the mechanism of CdIn2S4/MoS2 composites for hydrogen generation, the visible light absorption ability of sample C, sample 1CM, sample 2CM, sample 3CM, and sample M were analyzed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, as shown in Fig. 6 a and b. It can be observed that the edge of CdIn2S4 nano-flower absorption band around 610 nm is consistent with the results reported in the literature [30], while MoS2 shows a higher absorbance in the visible region. With the increase of the MoS2 loading, the visible light absorption capacity of the composite sample gradually increased. This is consistent with the color change of the sample. With the increase of MoS2, the color of the sample gradually deepened. This additional bandwidth can be attributed to the intrinsic absorption of the MoS2 nanosheets and is verified by the successful loading of MoS2 on the CdIn2S4 surface. According to the relationship between absorption and photon energy, the energy band of semiconductor can be estimated by the formula αhν = A(hν-Eg)1/2. Where α is the absorption coefficient, hν describes the incident photon energy, A is constant and Eg represents the band gap of the material. Thus, the band gap of sample C, sample 1CM, sample 2CM and sample 3CM were calculated as 2.0 eV, 1.95 eV, 1.98 eV and 1.92 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b. In addition, Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy is considered as an effective technique to evaluate the separation efficiency of photo-induced electron hole pairs. As depicted in Fig. 6c, the strength of sample 2CM is lower than CdIn2S4 and other composites at the excitation wavelength of 295 nm at room temperature, which suggesting that the sample 2CM has a better electron-hole separation efficiency. It is well known that the weaker the PL strength, the easier the separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs, the higher the carrier separation efficiency and the higher the photocatalytic activity of the nano-semiconductor materials. Therefore, it is certain that the modification of CdIn2S4 by MoS2 is beneficial to the suppression of carrier recombination. In addition, the amount of MoS2 plays an important role in the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron hole pairs in the heterojunction. When the mass ratio of MoS2 is 9 mol%, the corresponding microstructure, such as effective specific surface area, surface morphology and heterojunction (Fig. 2, Table S1) has a good effect on inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced electron hole pairs, which is consistent to the Electrochemical test results of transfer kinetics of photogenerated electrons and holes shown in Fig. 7a. The transient photocurrent response of sample C and sample composites under UV–visible light irradiation at the bias potential CM of 0.7 V relative to Ag/AgCl electrode. It can be seen from the figure that the photo-current of all the working electrodes increases immediately after turning on the lamp, and quickly decreases to zero after turning off the lamp, indicating that the semiconductor materials prepared have good photoresponse ability. The results show that the sample composites hetero-structure has a higher photocurrent density than the sample C, especially the average photocurrent density of sample 2CM is about twice that of sample C, indicating that sample 2CM has a better separation rate of e−/h+ pairs [34,37]. It is well known that the photocurrent mainly depends on the generation and separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers in the electrode. The stronger the photocurrent response, the higher the efficiency of photoinduced electron and hole generation and separation. In addition, the illustrated are fitted equivalent circuits (Rs and Rt, representing solution resistance and inter-facial charge transfer resistance, respectively). Here, the Rt of sample 2CM is 9.08 Ω, which is less than sample C (13.41 Ω), suggesting that the hetero-junction between sheet MoS2 and CdIn2S4 complex can migrate to the active site more quickly for redox reaction. Therefore, the increase of the transient photocurrent density of sample 2CM photocatalyst proves that the hetero-structure composites can be used as an effective photon capture carrier to promote the generation of electron hole pairs, improve the interfacial electron transport and prolong the life of photogenerated carriers, as well as an efficient structure to accelerate the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. In addition, the results of EIS are shown in the form of Nyquist plot in Fig. 7b. The results show that the semicircle diameter of CdIn2S4/MoS2 (sample 2CM) is smaller than that of other materials. The smaller the semicircle diameter is, the more effective the carrier transfer is and the faster the redox reaction rate is. Therefore, the hetero-photo-catalyst containing sample 2CM has better charge transfer efficiency and photo-catalytic performance. In order to further expound the generation, separation, and reaction processes of photo-generated charge carriers, the energy band structures were ascertained according to the following empirical formulas Eqs. (1) and (2) [36,37]: (1) E C B = χ − E e − 0.5 E g (2) E V B = E C B + E g Where, ECB, EVB and Eg are the conduction band potential, valence band potential and band gap width of the semiconductor material respectively, χ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which was calculated to be 4.84 eV and 5.32 eV of CdIn2S4 and MoS2, respectively. Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (≈4.5 eV). Eg is the band gap energy based on the result of UV–vis spectra (Fig. 6), in which the band gaps of MoS2 and CdIn2S4 are 1.09 eV and 2.00 eV. Therefore, the ECB and EVB are − 0.275 eV and 0.815 eV for MoS2, and − 0.66 eV and 1.34 eV for CdIn2S4, respectively, which is consistent with previous result [35,41]. The bandgap calculation results based on diffuse reflection test data show that the ECB of CdIn2S4 (−0.66 eV) is lower than MoS2 (−0.275 eV), while the EVB of CdIn2S4 (1.34 eV) is higher than MoS2 (0.815 eV). The possible mechanism of photocatalytic RhB degradation by composite materials is shown in Fig. 8. Under visible light irradiation, h+ migrates from the valence band of CdIn2S4 to the valence band of MoS2, and the photo-induced electrons accumulate on all sides near the interface [38], while the number of electrons accumulate on the conduction band side of CdIn2S4 is the same. Since the ECB (−0.66 eV) of CdIn2S4 is much more negative than that of MoS2 (−0.275 eV), the photo-induced electrons of CdIn2S4 form electron hole pairs and are transferred to MoS2 through the generated alloy structure, where they react with O2 to form ·O2−. It is noteworthy that CdIn2S4 (ECB = −0.66 eV) can reduce the formation of surface-captured ·O2- radicals captured on the surface due to it more negative conduction potential than O2/·O2− (−0.33 eV). The valence band potential of MoS2 (0.815 eV) was lower than -OH/·OH (2.4 eV), so no oxidation reaction of ·OH occurred. In addition, the introduction of low band gap energy MoS2 reduces the band gap energy and optical excitation condition of 2CM composites. Different band positions also lead to the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons/holes, which is conducive to increasing carrier lifetime and thus improving photocatalytic degradation efficiency [39,40]. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of 2CM composite material under visible light irradiation is superior to that of MoS2 and CdIn2S4."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, a three-dimensional flower-like CdIn2S4/MoS2 catalyst with good performance for photocatalytic hydrogen production was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The sample 2CM (9% CdIn2S4/MoS2 composites) presented a flower-like micro-sphere shape and was almost uniform in size. It was assembled by flake MoS2 and CdIn2S4 particles. In this structure, the hetero-junction shows stronger photo-catalytic activity for hydrogen production than MoS2 and CdIn2S4. The enhanced photo-catalytic performance exhibited by the composites can be attributed to the larger specific surface area, the active site provided by the flake MoS2, and the efficient charge separation capability. In conclusion, the hetero-junction materials prepared in this paper provide a feasible strategy for energy application."
