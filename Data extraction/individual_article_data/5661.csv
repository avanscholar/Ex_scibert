0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as a clean and green energy carrier, has the highest energy density, making it a promising substitution to traditional fossil fuels in the future. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an important pathway to produce hydrogen through water splitting driven by electricity (electrochemical HER) and solar sources (photo-electrochemical HER) [1–4]. Platinum (Pt) is the most effective electro-catalysts for HER so far [5–7]. However, the high cost and low storage severely of Pt limit its sustainable utilization on a large scale in energy harvesting systems. Therefore, searching for cost-effective and earth-abundant materials with high HER activity and stability have been intensely pursed toward enabling a hydrogen economy. Pt-free electro-catalysts, such as MoS2 [8–10], WS2 [11,12], Ni3S2 [13,14], CoS2 [15,16], MoSe2 [17], NiSe2 [18], CoSe2 [19], CoP [20], Ni2P [21], FeP [22], WP2 [23], MoC [24], WC [25,26], MoNiNC [27], MXene [28,29], and Ni based alloys [30–32] are explored as alternatives for Pt because of the low cost and natural abundance. Since the poor conductivity of semi-conductive TMDs, such as MoS2 [8,9,33], often causes high overpotential and low efficiency compared to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, the metallic TMDs (e.g., VS2, NbS2, and TaS2) with delicate nanostructures are expected to deliver excellent HER catalytic activity. The DFT calculation have indicated that VS2 monolayers possessed superior HER activity among other TMDs [34–36]. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of VS2 was found strongly depend on its edge structure and configuration [37]. Up to date, only a few methods have been reported dealing with the synthesis and application of VS2 in energy conversion and storage [38–45]. For example, Jiangtan Yuan et al. reported a CVD method to synthesize singe crystal VS2 nanosheets, which showed extremely low overpotential (−68 mV) at the specific 10 mA cm−2, small Tafel slopes (≈34 mV decade−1), and high stability in HER reaction [39]. Recently, VS2 nanoplates growing on carbon paper were synthesized using liquid phase method and further tested as HER catalysts, which showed a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1 and an extremely low overpotential of 42 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 [38]. Therefore, in terms of large-scale renewable energy applications, low temperature liquid phase method is a much more facile and economic approach [41,46,47]. Herein, we report a facile hydrothermal method followed by calcination to synthesize vanadium self-intercalated C/V1.11S2 nanosheets with abundant active sites with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The V1.11S2 phase is one of nonstoichiometric 1T-V1+xS2 (0 < x < 0.25) with a significant amount x of V atoms in the interstitial site between adjacent layers [48]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to prepare vanadium self-intercalated C/V1.11S2 nanosheets and evaluate them as the HER catalysts. The process of synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1a, when using Na3VO4·12O and TAA (thioacetamide) as V and S sources to prepare VS2 in a hydrothermal process, the crystal growth is prior to the (001) facet because the surface energy of (001) facet is much lower than the other facets of VS2, leading to bulk VS2 [49]. Fig. 1b shows the synthesis process of vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 with PVP assistance. PVP has hydroxyl groups at the end of the molecule structures as an anion surfactant, which will absorb on the surface of VS2 layers, leading to self-intercalated nanosheets due to electrostatic interactions with NH4 + from the TAA [47]. After a reaction of 24 h in the hydrothermal process, PVP is easy to be carbonized, but the rest hydroxyl groups will adsorb the NH4 + between the VS2 layers to form stable VS2·NH3 phase with enlarged interlayer space (9.2 Å) in the precursor. During the calcination process, the carbon derived from PVP carbonization reduces the VS2 to V1.11S2 phase with rich sulfur defects, while the NH3 molecule between the layers is released."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) (Mw = 58,000), Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4·12H2O), TAA (thioacetamide), and isoproponal were commercially available from Shanghai Aladdin biochemical Polytron Technologies Inc. All reagents were analytical grade and used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor and bulk VS2,"2.2 Preparation of PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor and bulk VS2 In a typical experiment, 3 mmol Na3VO4·12H2O and 21 mmol TAA were dissolved in 40 mL distilled water in a glass jar, which was then stirred for 1 h. Then 0.3 g PVP was added into the previous solution and stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution and transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. Afterward, the system was cooled down to room temperature. Black precipitate was finally collected by centrifugation and washed several times with absolute alcohol and distilled water, then dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h, affording PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor. The bulk VS2 was prepared in the same procedure without the addition of PVP."
4,Preparation of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets,2.3 Preparation of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets The obtained PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor was pyrolyzed at 350 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to obtain C/V1.11S2 nanosheets.
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM, TESCAN) measurements were employed to characterize the morphologies of the obtained samples. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) measurements were carried out with a Tecnai F30 microscope. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded with a Bruke D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ1⁄40.15406 nm) radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe Ⅱ instrument. Raman spectra were recorded on a HORIBA Raman microscope with an Ar laser source of 532 nm in a macroscopic configuration. FT-IR data were collected with an FT-IR Spectrometer (PerkinElmer). ICP-MS was performed on Varian 720 instrument."
6,Electrochemistry,"2.5 Electrochemistry Electrochemical measurements were performed with an electrochemical workstation (Biological VMP3) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt plate were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. A calculated amount of sample was loaded on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) which was used as the working electrode. Experimentally, 5 mg of the respective catalyst powders was dispersed in 1 mL of 3:1 (v/v) water/isoproponal mixed solvents with 50 μL of a Nafion solution under ultra-sonication for 30 min. 3.5 μL of the resulting solution was dropped onto the glassy-carbon disk by a microliter syringe and dried at room temperature. Polarization curves with ohmic compensation were acquired by sweeping the potential from 0 to −0.8 V (vs. SCE) at a potential sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to probe the electrochemical double layer capacitance at non-faradaic potentials as a method to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrodes. Voltage–time responses were monitored by chronoamperometric measurements for up to 20 h at the applied current density of 25 mA cm−2."
7,DFT calculation,"2.6 DFT calculation The Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [50] incorporated with projector augmented wave (PAW) scheme [51,52], which is based on the density functional theory (DFT) [50] and the Perdew-Burke-Eznerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) [54], is used in our calculations. To avoid image-image interaction between two monolayers in neighbouring supercells, vacuum regions of at least 20 Å in vertical directions is used. Based on the Monkhorst and Pack scheme, a 5 × 5 × 1 grid for k-point sampling for geometry optimization of supercells is applied. An energy cut-off of 450 eV is consistently used in our calculations. Good convergence is obtained with these parameters and the total energy was converged to 2.0 × 10−5 eV per atom. A 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of VS2 and V1.11S2 is applied."
8,Results and discussion,"The morphology of the bulk VS2 and C/V1.11S2 are illustrated in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2a, the bulk VS2 flower-like microspheres prepared without PVP consist of nanosheets with a diameter of around 5–10 μm. The higher resolution image in Fig. 2c shows the thickness of bulk VS2 has a thickness of about 50 nm with smooth surface. Fig. S1 shows the PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor consists of nanosheets with a much smaller diameter of 300–400 nm. After calcination, the V1.11S2 nanosheets maintain the nanostructure as shown in Fig. 2b. Furthermore, the high-resolution SEM image of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets (Fig. 2d) shows that there are distinct carbon layer distributing in the space between different V1.11S2 nanosheet layers or on the surface of V1.11S2 nanosheets, leading to aggregated nanosheets with rough surfaces. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the detailed structure of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets (Fig. 3a∼f). The HAADF image (Fig. 3 a) and EDS mapping images (Fig. 3c∼e) show that the V, S and C elements distribute homogeneously in C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. In Fig. 3f, the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets in the (001) orientation have an interlayer space of around 0.57 nm, and that on the (101) facet is around 0.25 nm. It has also been observed that there are many discontinuous crystal fringes along the curled edge due to the existence of rich defects, as indicated in Fig. 3f [9]. In addition, we see that the amorphous C area without distinct crystal fringes has an obvious boundary with the V1.11S2 nanosheets. The phases of the as-prepared samples were identified by XRD (Fig. 3g). All the characteristic peaks of bulk VS2 (the black line) show that it is has a hexagonal phase (space group: P-3ml (164), JCPDF No. 89-1640) without impurity [38,47]. The sharp and narrow peaks indicate the good crystallization of bulk VS2. The XRD pattern of PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor is shown in Fig. S2, and the characteristic peaks can be indexed into VS2·NH3 phase (space group: R-3m (166), JCPDF No. 41-0642) [41]. In Fig. S3, there exists N 1s states in XPS spectrum of PVP/VS2·NH3 precursor indicating that NH3 or NH4+ intercalates between adjacent VS2 layers. In order to further confirm the existence of NH3 in the VS2·NH3 counterpart, the FTIR spectra were measured. As shown in Fig. S4, the VS2·NH3 counterparts display a typical stretching absorption at 3150 cm−1 for NH in NH3 and a symmetric bending vibration absorption at 1406 cm−1 for NH in NH3, indicating the intercalation of NH3 into the interlayers. After calcination at 350°, all the characteristic peaks in the XRD pattern of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets (Fig. 3g in the red plots) can be indexed into V1.11S2 phase (space group: P-3ml (JCPDF No. 33-1445) [55]. In addition, the diffraction peaks of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets are more broaden and lower in intensity, indicating the smaller crystalline size of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, which is consistent with the morphology of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets (Fig. 2b). From the inset image in Fig. 3g, it is much easier to see that the sharp peak centered at 15.38° is the (001) diffraction peak of bulk VS2 with an interlayer spacing of 5.75 Å, while the broad peak centered at 15.55° is the (001) diffraction peak of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets with the interlayer spacing of 5.70 Å. In addition, the peaks of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets centered at 56.1°, 68.1° and 74.7° are left-shift than bulk VS2 (Fig. S5). Raman spectra of bulk VS2 and the C/V1.11S2 composites show two characteristic peaks (Fig. S6) at 282 cm−1 and 406 cm−1. The former is associated with the Eg mode of hexagonal VS2 originated from a curvature of VS2 sheets and the latter is attributed to the out-of-plane (Ag) symmetric displacements of sulfur atoms along the c-axis vibration modes [38]. For the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, two addition vibrational bands at 1350.4 and 1593.8 cm−1 are observed, which are the characteristic D and G vibrational bands of graphitic carbon that is produced from carbonization of PVP (Fig. S7) [56]. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometric (EDS) mapping (Fig. S8) of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets confirms the uniform distribution of V, S and C, which is consistent with the Raman results of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. The mole ratio of V to S in C/V1.11S2 is calculated as 0.56 which is a bit higher than 0.55, indicating the sulfur defects in the V1.11S2, while the mole ratio of V to S in the bulk VS2 (in Fig. S9) is 0.51 closing to the theoretical value of stoichiometric VS2. In order to measure the content of C in the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, TGA/DSC were carried out in air atmosphere from 30 to 800 °C (Fig. S10). TGA/DSC curves display a three-step mass loss. The first weight loss occurs at about 195.6 °C, which is contributed by the water on the surface of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. The second weight loss appears from 306.1 to 406.1 °C, which can be mainly attributed to the removal of C by oxidation process. The third weight loss from about 400 to 500 °C is corresponding to the oxidization from V1.11S2 to V2O5. In addition, the theoretical weight loss ratio of the oxidization is calculated to be up to 19.57%, which is close to the third weight loss value (20.37%). From these results, it is calculated that the weight content of carbon in the composite is about 11.0%, and the weight content of V1.11S2 nanosheets is about 89%. To investigate chemical environment and valence states of the prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out (Fig. 4 ). The peaks at 516.2 and 523.5 eV (Fig. 4a) are attributed to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 levels, indicating the V4+ oxidation state in the bulk VS2. Different from bulk VS2, the spectrum of V1.11S2 (V2p) shows two additional broad peaks at lower binding energy of 512.9 and 520.6 eV, which are assigned to V2p3/2 and V2p1/2 of V2+, respectively (Fig. 4b). Further quantitative analysis indicates that the V2+/V4+ atomic ratio is about 1:4. Based on the band balance, the V1.11S2 can be calculated as V(2+)0.22V(4+)0.89S2 [55]. The peak fitting analysis of S 2p confirms the presence of S2− with two peaks located at 161.2 and 162.5 eV that can be assigned to S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4c) [57]. The peaks around 163.7 and 168.5 eV are assigned to SC bond and SO bond, indicating the surface of the C/V1.11S2 is partially oxidized [38,56]. The high-resolution scan of the C 1s states shows a peak at 284.5 eV, which is the characteristic of sp2 carbon, another one at 286.3 eV for CS and a third one at 288.8 eV for CO (Fig. 4d), confirming the interfacial bonding between carbon and VS2 in C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. Our characterizations show that the vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 phase can be synthesized easily in the hydrothermal and subsequently annealing method with PVP assistance. The C/V1.11S2 nanosheets have small sizes and the rich sulfur defects, which can be expected to provide large contact area with the electrolyte, increase the reaction sites and enhance charge transfer during catalytic process, resulting in the improvement of electrochemical performance. The electrocatalytic HER activity of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets was investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a three-electrode system. Fig. 5 a shows the polarization curves for a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) loaded with 20 wt% Pt/C, C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, PVP/VS2·N precursor and bulk VS2, respectively. The C/V1.11S2 has a small onset potential of 15 mV, which is close to that of 20 wt% Pt/C (9 mV vs. RHE) and superior to those of bulk VS2 (56 mV) and PVP/VS2·NH3 (200 mV). The calculated Tafel slopes are 51 mV dec−1, 70 mV dec−1, 110 mV dec−1 and 35 mV dec−1 for C/V1.11S2, bulk VS2, PVP/VS2·NH3 and 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively (Fig. 5b). A lower Tafel slope suggests a smaller activation energy for HER, which means a lower overpotential is required to generate a certain current density. To evaluate the effects of surface and active sites on the catalytic ability, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to estimate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the samples. The corresponding current in the applied potential window of 0–0.10 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) should be originated from the charging of the double-layer, and the calculated capacitance (C) should be proportional to the ECSA [12,38]. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets modified electrode possess a double layer capacitance (32.0 mF cm−2), which is much higher than those of bulk VS2 (2.8 mF cm−2) and PVP/VS2·NH3 (4.6 mF cm−2). The high ECSA of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets certainly contributes to its high catalytic activity. It is worth noting that the ECSA of PVP/VS2·NH3 is higher than that of bulk VS2, but the HER performance of PVP/VS2·NH3 is the poorest among all the samples. This can be ascribed to the poor electronic conductivity of the incompletely carbonized PVP in the hydrothermal process. After calcination, the PVP is further carbonized to enhance the conductivity of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, leading to excellent HER activity of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. To further verify the stability of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets for HER, the voltage-time plot was acquired at the current density of −25 mA cm−2 for 20 h of continuous operation (Fig. 5e). The catalytic current keeps almost unchanged, indicating strong durability of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, the cycling performance of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets (Fig. S11) shows that the decay of the cathodic currents is negligible even after continuous operation of 2000 CV cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective method to investigate the kinetics at electrode/electrolyte interface in the HER process. As shown in the inset in Fig. 5f, the main arc in the EIS spectra was fitted using a simplified Randles equivalent circuit, which consisted of Rs (electrical electronic conductivity of electrodes), Rct (interface electrocatalytic reaction between electrode and electrolyte) and CPE (a constant phase element). The fitting parameters were estimated through the application of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization procedure. Specifically, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics, and a lower value corresponds to a faster reaction rate, which can be quantified from the diameter of the semicircle in the low frequency zone. In Fig. 5f, the Rct values of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets decreases significantly with increasing overpotentials, from 40.2 Ω at 100 mV to 11.7 Ω at 180 mV, which are much lower than those of bulk VS2 (from 65.5 Ω at 100 mV to 22.4 Ω at 180 mV) and PVP/VS2·NH3 (from 270.3 Ω at 100 mV to 81.2 Ω at 180 mV) (Fig. S12), suggesting faster electron transfer and more favorable HER kinetics at the electrolyte interface of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. The high resistance of PVP/VS2·NH3 indicates that the incompletely carbonized PVP/VS2·NH3 with low conductivity has slow HER kinetics, which is responsible for the poor HER activity. To better elucidate the HER performance, we have carried out the first-principles calculations to study the catalytic performance of the VS2 and V1.11S2 in hydrogen production. As reported in previous work [55,58,59], the crystal structure of V1.11S2 was found to be similar to VS2, but with random vacancies in the otherwise filled layers. Specifically, the structure contains VS2 monolayer building blocks alternating with extra V-atoms partially occupying 20% of the available sites between the monolayers [59]. From this structural feature, the formula of V1.11S2 can, therefore, be written as V0.22V0.89S2 which agrees well with our XPS results [58]. We build the initial structure of vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 (Fig. S13a) by using two layers of VS2 with interlayer distance of 5.75 Å, which is derived from the bulk crystal structure of VS2 (Fig. S13d), and adding extra V atoms between the two layers of VS2. The structures of vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 and VS2 after optimization are shown in Fig. 6 . After the structure relax of V1.11S2, the S atoms at the outmost layer (Fig. 6a and b) is disturbed due to the intercalated V atoms which leading to the distance of the average VS (V1 S, V2 S, and V3 S) bond changing from 2.354 Å (Fig. S13a) to 2.405 Å (Fig. 6a and b). In addition, the optimized interlayer spacing of the V1.11S2 is 5.70 Å which agrees well with results of XRD (Fig. 3g). The Bader charge analysis also shows the S atom in V1.11S2 is 0.02 e more than that of VS2 which results in lowering the interaction with H due to the electron repulsion. Importantly, the HER performance of V1.11S2 and VS2 can be characterized by the Gibbs free reaction energy of hydrogen adsorption ΔGH [34,60,61], which can be calculated from the following equation: ΔGH = ΔEH + ΔEZPE - TΔSH, where ΔSH is the difference in entropy, and ΔEZPE is the difference in zero-point energy between the adsorbed and the gas phase. ΔEZPE - TΔSH is about 0.24 eV [61,62]. The ΔGH is regarded as a major indicator of HER activity for various catalysts, whose absolute value should be zero [62]. As shown in Fig. 7 , the calculated ΔGH for V1.11S2 is −0.046 eV which is much closer to zero than −0.160 eV for VS2, indicating that the vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 phase can provide much faster proton/electron adsorption and hydrogen release process than the VS2. The theoretical results agree well with the above experimental and further prove the excellent HER activity of self-intercalated V1.11S2. Recently, many researchers advocate using stable graphite rod to replace Pt plate/wire as counter electrode when evaluating the HER activity in three-electrode system, because Pt is easy to be absolved in acid solution and deposited on the surface of the working electrode, leading to the enhanced HER activity [63–66]. However, it is worth propulsive to explore the relationship between the Pt deposition and the intrinsic properties of the working electrode. Kai Tang et al. reported that the edge-rich layered WS2 nanosheets have high edge selectivity of Pt deposition in acid solution [67]. Results indicated that the exposed edges have stronger interaction with Pt atoms. When acted as HER electrocatalysts, the in situ electrochemical Pt-deposited WS2 nanosheets with rich exposed edges exhibit commercial Pt-like HER performance in the acid and alkaline media. Lihan Zhang et al. prepared successfully single Pt atoms on CoP-based nanotube arrays supported by nickel foam via a facile electrochemical deposition [68]. When evaluated as HER cathodes, the integrated electrode delivered excellent performances which are comparable to and better than those of commercial Pt/C at low and high current densities. David Zitoun's group reported platinum-group metal including Pt and Pd growing on the edges of vertically aligned MoS2 as HER electrocatalysts by electrodeposition [69]. Both electrocatalysts VA-MoS2@Pt and VA-MoS2@Pd show excellent performances with a low onset potential and high current density at 300 mV potentials. To explore whether the Pt counter electrode has effect on the HER activity of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets, active materials of the working electrode after long cycles are stripped from the glass carbon electrode and characterized by SEM and TEM. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . The EDS mapping images (Fig. 8a∼8c) show the even distribution of V and S elements of the electrode materials which indicates the stability of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets in the long cycles. In addition, a small quantity (∼2%) of Pt element has also been detected that testify the deposition of Pt process during the HER testing when using Pt as counter electrode (Fig. 8d). Furthermore, from the HAADF image (Fig. 8e), it is easy to observe small Pt particles with an even diameter of about 10 nm depositing on the surface of electrode materials. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. S14 testifies that the Pt nanoparticles are prior to deposit on the basal plane of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets which may be ascribed to the high conductivity of the basal plane of the metallic V1.11S2 phase."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed a facile hydrothermal method followed by a calcination process to prepare vanadium self-intercalated C/V1.11S2 nanosheets with abundant active sites. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst for HER, the obtained C/V1.11S2 nanosheets exhibit outstanding catalytic activity and excellent long-term stability in acidic media superior to the state-of-art results. The excellent HER activity of the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets can be contributed to the abundant active sites derived from: (i) the unique vanadium self-intercalated structure of V1.11S2 phase; (ii) nanostructured morphology (iii) rich sulfur defects in the edge of vanadium self-intercalated structure and a synergetic effect between Pt nanoparticles and the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. The abundant active sites facilitate the interface contact between the electrode and electrolyte, and enhance charge transfer during reaction, resulting in excellent HER catalytic activity of the obtained C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. Low cost and scalable solution synthesis and high catalytic activity make the C/V1.11S2 nanosheets a promising alternative to Pt for large-scale hydrogen production. The vanadium self-intercalated C/V1.11S2 nanosheets reported in this work may be applied in energy storage systems, such as supercapacitors and batteries."
