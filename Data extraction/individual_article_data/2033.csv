0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely accepted as a favourable technology for both waste disposal and energy recovery (Khalid et al., 2011). Acidogenesis process is one of the most important steps during AD, which affects the overall efficiency of AD (Parawira et al., 2004). Carboxylic acids including acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate are common products of acidogenic fermentation (Parawira et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2014). Carboxylic acids which have a broad range of applications, such as biological nitrogen removal (Lim et al., 2006), production of biogas (Li et al., 2010), generation of electricity by microbial fuel cell (Chen et al., 2013b) and synthesis of polymers (Chen et al., 2013a) are widely used in the plastics, pharmaceutical, wastewater treatment and food industries. Hence, production of high-value carboxylic acids by acidogenic fermentation is an alternative choice in AD. In AD process, hydrogen is a co-product with the production of acids (Nissilä et al., 2014), which can be rapidly consumed and converted to methane by hydrogen-consuming microorganisms in the methanogenesis stage (Guo et al., 2014). In acidogenic fermentation, elevated pressure of H2 in the reactor occurred due to the artificial termination of methanogenesis. The accumulation of dissolved H2 in the liquid or high P H2 in the headspace may alter the electron flow in the biochemical pathway of microorganisms and affect the efficiency and conversion of the reactions (Cazier et al., 2015; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2006). Therefore, in order to increase the recovery of carboxylic acids from the acidogenic fermentation of glucose, it is necessary to reduce the inhibition of P H2. The P H2 can be reduced by some physical removing methods such as releasing gases and exhausting gases by sparging other gas. On the other hand, consumption of H2 by microorganisms is another way to decrease the influence of P H2 (Nie et al., 2008). There are functional groups of bacteria in anaerobic system called homoacetogens. They can grow both autotrophically on H2 and CO2/CO and/or heterotrophically on organic compounds such as saccharides, alcohols, methoxylated aromatic compounds, etc. as sources of energy and carbon for acetate production (Chen et al., 2003; Drake, 1994). It was previously reported that homoacetogenesis consumed 11–43% of the H2 yield in single and repeated batch fermentations, respectively (Saady, 2013). In addition, the product of homoacetogenesis is acetate. Thus, it is predicted that the production of carboxylic acids can be increased by enhancing the homoacetogenesis in the reactor. For now, there are various factors studied would influence the activities of homoacetogens. Firstly, the introduction of trace metals in media is necessary as the metalloenzymes in acetogens are important in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway which could convert CO2 and H2 to acetate (Zhu and Tan, 2009). In addition, some homoacetogens such as Acetobacterium woodii can couple CO2 reduction to acetate production with the generation of an electrochemical sodium ion gradient across the membrane, which is then used to drive ATP synthesis (Biegel et al., 2011; Fritz et al., 2008) and flagella rotation (Müller and Bowien, 1995). Moreover, as CO2 is used as a terminal electron acceptor and carbon source by homoacetogens, homoacetogenesis could be optimized in media containing CO2 and H2. Based on the effective factors mentioned above, the conditions with appropriate nutrient solution and headspace gases will enhance the growth and activities of homoacetogens. To date, most existing studies which have been carried out to enhance the recovery of carboxylic acids from acidogenic fermentation focused on the strategies such as pre-treatment (Zhou et al., 2014), co-digestion (Zhou et al., 2013), or optimization of operational parameters including pH (Chen et al., 2013a), temperature (Jiang et al., 2013), hydraulic retention time (Dinsdale et al., 2000) and organic loading rate (Lim et al., 2008). In addition, previous work showed that carboxylic acids production increased by supplementing hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide in mixed culture fermentation (Arslan et al., 2012), which indicated the headspace, especially the hydrogen partial pressure could be a critical factor for the production of carboxylic acids. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of decreasing P H2 on carboxylic acids production during acidogenic fermentation of glucose and reveal the change of microbial communities and metabolic pathways. It will provide valuable information for further optimization of microbial carboxylic acids production during the anaerobic digestion."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sludge,"2.1 Sludge The sludge, obtained from the Tuandao wastewater treatment plant (Qingdao, China) was dried at 105°C for 2h in order to inactivate non-spore-forming methanogens and then sieved using a #30 mesh. The treated sludge was either used within 1day or stored in sealed containers at ambient temperature (25°C) and would be used within one week."
3,Acclimation of inoculum,"2.2 Acclimation of inoculum Acidogenic microbes were acclimated by adding 7.00g heat-treated sludge to a 500mL glucose solution. This solution contained (mg/L): glucose 3.00g/L; K2HPO4·3H2O·22.82g/L; KH2PO4 13.61g/L; yeast extract 1.00g/L; NH4Cl 50.00; sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) 2.11g/L; MgCl2·6H2O 30.00; FeCl3 2.50; NiSO4 1.60; CaCl2 2.50; ZnCl2 1.20; CoCl2·6H2O 1.10; CuCl2·5H2O 0.50L; MnCl2·4H2O 1.50. The reactor was purged with N2 to ensure anaerobic conditions, and then placed in a 37°C incubator at 100rpm. The cultivation medium was renewed every 2days. After 2weeks, the mixed liquid in reactor containing microorganisms and cultivation medium was collected, centrifuged at 2500×g for 5min, and the cell pellet was used as the inoculum. The homoacetogens were acclimatized by adding 2.80g heat-treated sludge to a 200mL glucose solution. The composition of the homoacetogenic medium was selected according to a previous study (Drake et al., 2006): glucose 3.00g/L; NaHCO3 7.50g/L; KH2PO4 0.50g/L; yeast extract 1.00g/L; BES 2.11g/L; NaCl 400.00; MgCl2·6H2O 330.00; NH4Cl 400.00; CaCl2·6H2O 50.00; MnCl2·4H2O 2.20; FeSO4·7H2O 0.50; CoCl2·6H2O 0.41; ZnCl2 0.50; NiSO4·6H2O 0.26; H2SeO4 0.30; CuSO4·5H2O 0.05; AlK(SO4)2·12H2O 0.05; H3BO3 0.05; Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.05; Na2WO4·2H2O 0.05. The reactor was purged with mixed gas (H2: CO2 =80:20) to ensure anaerobic conditions, and then placed in a 37°C incubator at 100rpm. Similarly, the cultivating medium was renewed every 2days. In order to enrich autotrophic homoacetogens, organic carbon source was replaced by CO2 and NaHCO3 after 3 series of cultivation. After one month, the mixed liquid in reactor containing microorganisms and cultivation medium was collected, centrifuged at 2500×g for 5min, and the cell pellet was used as the inoculum."
4,Experimental set-up,"2.3 Experimental set-up Serum bottles (250-mL), capped with butyl-rubber septa and aluminum crimp caps, were used as reactors. The reactors were fed with 100mL nutrient solution (contents as above) and 20g/L glucose. Then 2mL of each acclimated inoculum (OD600 ∼0.81) was added into the bottles and mixed well. Before cultivation, l-cysteine and Na2S (0.25g/L) were added to the bottles to eliminate oxygen in the liquid, then flushed with gases (N2, CO2 or H2:CO2 =80:20 in different treatments) without oxygen to ensure anaerobic conditions. All the batch reactors were incubated in the dark at 37°C. Following incubation for 17, 34, 46, 63, 87 and 135h, two bottles from each treatment were taken out and the contents analyzed for glucose, pH, carboxylic acids, alcohols and diversity of bacteria. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the average values are reported. Three strategies were designed to examine the effect of reducing P H2 on the production of carboxylic acids during anaerobic fermentation of glucose i.e., headspace removal (T1), CO2 sparging (T2), and H2:CO2 (80:20) sparging (T3). In treatment T1, the acidogenic headspace was removed continuously; in treatment T2, CO2 was sparged into the reactors throughout the fermentation operation (flow rate 20mL/h); whereas in treatment T3, appropriate nutrient solution and mixed gas (H2:CO2 =80:20) as the headspace gas were used to enhance the activities of homoacetogens. No strategy to reduce the headspace gas pressure was applied in the control treatment (T4). N2 was used to remove the air before digestion in T1 and T4 treatments."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The pH of the medium was analyzed before filtration using a pH meter (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA). After filtration of the medium using a 0.22µm membrane, soluble products i.e., glucose, alcohols, lactic acid and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, n-butyric, iso-butyric, n-valeric and iso-valeric acids) were analyzed using an Agilent 1260 Series high performance liquid chromatography (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with an ultraviolet detector (210nm) and a refractive index detector (60°C, Agilent G1362A). A special ion exchange column Aminex HPX-87H column (300×7.8mm, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was operated at 60°C, and an eluent of 5mM aqueous sulfuric acid flowing at 0.6mL/min was applied for product separation. Concentrations of the samples were determined using a standard curve obtained by injecting standard solutions. Biogas produced in the headspace was collected by gasbags and the composition was analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890) with a TCD detector. Helium was used as gas carrier gas and the standard curve was developed with standard gas bottles i.e., 20% CO2 +80% H2, 100% H2 and 100% and 80% CO2 balanced in N2."
6,DNA extraction,"2.5 DNA extraction Total genomic DNA was extracted from the seed sludge and biomass obtained from the reactors at specific sampling points during the experiment. A 10mL homogeneous solution was centrifuged at 16,000×g for 5min to obtain the pellet, the pellet was washed twice with 1mL of MilliQ water to remove the residual medium, then, DNA from the pellet was extracted in duplicate using a Meta-G-Nome™ DNA Isolation kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Extracted DNA samples were stored at −20°C."
7,High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing,"2.6 High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing The microbial community in the samples collected from the seed sludge and suspended sludge of each reactor were analyzed using high-throughput pyrosequencing on an Illumina platform (Illumina Miseq PE250). Amplicon libraries were constructed for pyrosequencing using bacterial primers 515F (5′-GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3′) targeting the V4–V5 region of the microbial 16S rRNA gene, which was selected as the sequencing primer set to obtain bacterial information. The raw pyrosequencing data were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database (SRX1858661/SRR3715921)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance and SPSS Statistics v19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) to evaluate the effect of reducing P H2 on the performance of digesters. The differences were considered significant when P < 0.05. Carbon recovery calculation was based on mole carbon of detected carboxylic acids, ethanol, CO2, remaining glucose and biomass over the initial mole carbon of substrates including glucose and inorganic carbon supplied in nutrient solution and headspace gas. Homoacetogenesis efficiency was calculated by the amount of acetate produced from CO2 dividing the total production of acetate."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Anaerobic degradation of glucose and change in pH,"3.1 Anaerobic degradation of glucose and change in pH The degradation profiles of glucose in the four treatments are shown in Fig. 1 A. Generally, the concentration of glucose in the reactors decreased rapidly and >85% of glucose was consumed in all treatments within 135h. During the first 50h, glucose was degraded rapidly, then the degradation rate slowed down, which may have been associated with the possible inhibition of fermenting bacteria due to the decline of pH (Fig. 1B). In treatment T3, the decrease of concentration of glucose was the sharpest in the first 20h because of the enhancement of glucose degradation by homoacetogenesis. However, the superiority in T3 could not last during later time due to the inhibition of bacteria under unfavorable environmental conditions. The degradation rate of glucose in treatment T2 with CO2 sparging was lower in comparison with that in the other three treatments. It was reported that sparging CO2 in the headspace had an inhibitory effect on some acetogens (Kim et al., 2006). Hence, the reactions converting glucose to acids and CO2 were inhibited due to high CO2 partial pressure in T2. The production of carboxylic acids led to the decrease in pH, which greatly affected the activities of acetogens (Horiuchi et al., 2002). At the beginning of the digestion, pH in all four treatments decreased rapidly (Fig. 1B), which was in agreement with the rapid degradation of glucose. Subsequently, with the extension of fermentation time, the decrease in pH was slow. There may be two reasons for this phenomenon: (1) the inhibition of acidogens due to the accumulation of acids (Hawkes et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2015), and (2) changes in the metabolic pathway due to the accumulation of H2 (Angenent et al., 2004), as hydrogen was the accompanying product when glucose was broken down to acids. With the three strategies, at 135h, the P H2 in treatments T1, T2 and T3 were 0.62, 0.50 and 0.87bar, respectively and were lower than 1.27bar in the control (Fig. 2 ). pH of treatments T1-T3 were lower than that of the control after 135h, which was in line with the fact that low P H2 prompted the generation of acids instead of solvents (Kraemer and Bagley, 2008). Statistical analysis indicated that the pH in T3 and T2 had significant differences with control, whereas the differences between T1 and the control were not significant."
11,Carboxylic acids production and distribution,"3.2 Carboxylic acids production and distribution During acidogenic fermentation, glucose is converted to carboxylic acids including formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate. The production and distribution of carboxylic acids are the result of acidogenic metabolic pathways. Fig. 3 showed the production of carboxylic acids in different treatments, indicating that the strategies used to decrease the P H2 helped to produce carboxylic acids. The maximum concentrations of carboxylic acids after 135h in treatments T1, T2 and T3 were 10.21, 11.64 and 12.71g/L, respectively, which were 1.04-fold, 1.19-fold and 1.30-fold of that in the control. In treatment T3, homoacetogens which can produce acetate by the autotrophic reduction of CO2 with H2 could decrease the P H2 to 0.87bar and further prompt the production of acetate in the reactor. Hence, T3 showed the best performance in the carboxylic acids production and had significant difference with the control. In treatment T2, CO2 sparging in the headspace decreased the P H2 greatly to 0.50bar, and the reduced P H2 could facilitate the formation of carboxylic acids during acidogenic fermentation; however, some acetogens could be inhibited with CO2 sparging as reported by Kim et al. (2006), leading to the slow degradation rate of glucose which was showed in Fig. 1A. Hence, although the production of carboxylic acids in T2 increased significantly compared to the control, the extent was not as high as that in T3. In treatment T1, headspace removal could decrease P H2 to 0.62bar, but this strategy cannot change the ratio of CO2: H2 in the reactor. Thus, the carboxylic acids production in T1 was not improved significantly. The composition of carboxylic acids was detailed in Fig. 4 . Lactic acid showed the highest abundance among the products in all treatments, which was 8.15, 9.85, 6.63 and 7.81g/L in T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively, accounting for 79.9, 84.9, 52.2 and 80.0% of total carboxylic acids. The second abundant product was formic acid. The distribution of acidogenic products was similar to the results obtained by Zoetemeyer et al. (1982). In a previous study, the influence of pH on acidogenic dissimilation of glucose was investigated. The results showed that lactic acid and formic acid were the main products when the pH value was set at 6.4, which is close to the initial pH in this research (Zoetemeyer et al., 1982). Treatments T1, T2 and T4 showed similar compositions of carboxylic acids, while in treatment T3, the composition and ratio of carboxylic acids changed significantly comparing with the other treatments, which could be related to the preveiling microbial community. The concentration of acetate in treatment T3 was 2.02g/L (15.87% of total carboxylic acids) after fermenting 135h, which was 7.21-fold that of the control. Previous studies showed that the addition of homoacetogens in the heat-treated anaerobic sludge could enhance the proportion of acetate in all soluble products at a certain time period (Yan et al., 2014). In this research, the activities of homoacetogens could be enhanced by suppling appropriate nutrient solution and headspace gases. These homoacetogens, on one hand could convert glucose to acetate, on the other hand could consume the CO2 in the headspace to produce acetate. As a result, the percentage of acetate in carboxylic acids increased in T3. In addition, there was no butyrate detected in treatments T1, T2 and T4, while 1.54g/L of butyrate was obtained in T3, suggesting that the butyrate-producing metabolic pathway became one of the important pathways in this treatment due to the change of bacterial community."
12,Carbon balance,"3.3 Carbon balance Carbon in the substrates (organic and inorganic carbon) was converted into products such as carboxylic acids and alcohols in the broth, CO2 in gases, biomass and other contents in the system. Fig. 5 showed the fraction of carbon flowing to different products. Most of the carbon flowed to lactate which were 44.3, 51.9, 36.0 and 42.5% in T1, T2, T3 and T4, indicating that the lactate-producing pathway was the most popular pathway in all treatments. As indicated from Fig. 5, the average carbon recovery rate was 85–91%, and the rest carbon may flow to the intermediate products which were not analyzed or other products whose concentrations were under the detection limit such as propanol, butanol and iso-butanol. The fractions of carbon among different products in T1 and T2 were similar with that of T4, demonstrating that the strategies removing headspace and CO2 sparging just enhanced the efficiency of reaction but did not change the main metabolic pathways during acidogenic fermentation. While in T3 with enhancement of the activities of homoacetogens by specific nutrient solution and headspace, the carbon flowed to acetate and butyrate besides lactate. This might because different culture conditions changed microbial community and led to more homoacetogens in T3, resulting in homoacetogenesis as prevailing metabolic pathways. In addition, previous reports showed that homoacetogenic process could enhance the production of acetate and butyrate by chemolithoautotrophic (Ragsdale and Pierce, 2008) or organoheterotrophic pathways (Dai et al., 2014). The carbon recovery of carboxylic acids including lactate, formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate in all four treatments were more than 45%. With the strategies to reduce P H2, the carbon recovery in experimental groups increased, as the carbon recovery of carboxylic acids in treatments T1, T2 and T3 were 52.6%, 59.0% and 68.2%, respectively, which were 4.8%, 17.5% and 35.9% higher than that in T4. These results suggested that reducing P H2 could enhance the carbon in substrate flow to carboxylic acids. The most efficient strategy was enhancement of homoacetogenesis, and the carbon recovery of acids in T3 was higher than previous research on acidogenic fermentation, where the carbon recovery of total organic carbon changed from 44.7% to 52.0% under different pH (Fang and Liu, 2002). Based on gases test, the gases released from T3 (172mL) was lower than that from other treatments (325, 245 and 223mL in T1, T2 and T4), resulting in the carbon recovery of CO2 in T3 lowest (0.17%). This is because homoacetogenesis could use the CO2 and H2 to produce acetate. In addition, there was no carbon flowed to ethanol in T3. The results indicated that increased carbon recovery of carboxylic acids in T3 could be attributed to the fixation of CO2 into acid and also the shift of the metabolic pathway to produce acids rather than alcohols."
13,Microbial community analysis,"3.4 Microbial community analysis High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the bacterial communities in four different treatments. Samples were taken from reactors after operating 17, 46 and 135h. There were a total of 137 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in samples. After 135h acidogenic fermentation, T3 showed the highest OTUs (51 OTUs), compared to T1 (22 OTUs), T2 (26 OTUs), and T4 (33 OTUs). And the observed species index showed the same result, indicating that bacterial richness in T3 was highest after fermentation (Fig. 6 A). The Shannon index showed an increasing trend while the Simpson index showed a decreasing trend from 17h to 135h in T2 and T3 (Table 1 ), indicating that the richness and diversity of bacteria in both treatments increased with time going on. However, the diversity in the control decreased according to the Shannon and Simpson indices. After 135h, the Shannon indices in experimental groups were higher than that in control, and Simpson index showed the opposite trend. These results suggested that P H2 had a remarkable effect on the richness and diversity of microbial populations and reducing P H2 can increase the diversity of bacteria. Based on high-throughput sequencing, the relative abundance of acidogenic bacteria at fixed sampling points were obtained (Fig. 6B). A total of twelve genera of bacteria were detected in these samples. Archaea were not detected due to the addition of the methanogenic inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate. Proteus were the most abundant species in treatments T1, T2 and T4, accounting for >48.7% of the total bacterial biomass detected, and was as high as 92.1% in T2 at 17h. The second dominant genus was Enterococcus which was the dominant active species present in the acclimation reactor and served as the inoculum with a proportion of 63.1%. These findings indicated that after sequential acclimation, the abundance of Proteus which fermented glucose to a mixture of acids, was increased. Both Proteus and Enterococcus belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which show considerable adaptation to the environments and inhabit in a range of various niches (Korhonen, 2010). On the other hand, they can ferment organic matters to produce lactic acid and various other end products. The high abundance of Proteus and Enterococcus may the key reason why the production of lactate was high in these treatments. In T3, the dominant species was Clostridium, which accounted for 79.79%, 72.23% and 67.54% of the samples collected at 17, 46 and 135h, respectively, indicating that the conditions in T3 was suitable for the growth of Clostridium. Clostridium which belongs to homoacetogens is commonly found in various environments such as soil, sewage, marine sediments and the intestines of animals. They are gram-positive and obligate anaerobic bacteria capable of producing endospores under conditions of stress. With respect to carbon source utilization, Clostridium is involved in autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways. The former one which usually converts CO2/CO and H2 to acetate is known as the homoacetogenesis pathway. The abundance of homoacetogens and their homoacetogenic homocetogenic process can not only decrease the P H2, but also increase the production of acetate and butyrate in T3."
14,Proposed metabolic pathway during acidogenic fermentation,"3.5 Proposed metabolic pathway during acidogenic fermentation In anaerobic digestion, glucose firstly was converted to pyruvate along with ATP and NADH production (Zhou et al., 2017). The hydrogen lost from glucose during this process with the oxidation transforms NAD+ to NADH. Pyruvate is a pivotal control point in acidogenic metabolic pathways which can be converted into a wide range of products such as formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, H2 and CO2 (Chen et al., 2013b; Macfarlane and Macfarlane, 2003). In treatments T1, T2 and T4, bacteria belonged to Enterobacteriaceae family were dominant species in the communities, leading to the main metabolic pathway to lactate-type pathway. In this pathway, glucose could be oxidized to pyruvate (describe above), then pyruvate was reduced to lactate with the hydrogen supplied by oxidation of NADH to NAD+ (Sikora et al., 2013). During this pathway, there was no hydrogen produced (C6H12O6 →2CH3CH(OH)COOH+2ATP), which could reduce the influence of high P H2. Besides lactate-producing pathway, other metabolic pathways were also active in acidogenic fermentation, as formate, acetate, propionate and ethanol were detected in the products. After glucolysis, pyruvate could be converted to formate and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by Pyruvate-Formate lyase without CO2 releasing. The produced formate could be further converted to CO2 and H2, and the Acetyl-CoA could be used to produce acetate, ethanol or butyrate. The formation of acetate usually starts from pyruvate via the branch of acetyl-CoA with the generation of H2 and CO2 (C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2). Propionate could be produced through two metabolic pathways from pyruvate. In one of them, lactate and propionate come directly from reduction of pyruvate consuming NADH and release NAD+ (Lee et al., 2008). The other pathway does not need lactate as the intermediate, in which propionate is synthesized by catalyzing pyruvate to propionic acid through several intermediates such as oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate, succinate and methylmalonyl-CoA (Yan et al., 2010). In ethanol-producing pathway, pyruvate was converted to ethanol via three steps with acetyl-CoA and acetaldehyde as the intermediates and 2 NADH consumed (C6H12O6 →2CH3CH2OH+2CO2; Chaganti et al., 2011). In treatment T3, the production of acetate increased significantly and Clostridium which could produce acetate was the dominant species. The high percentage of acetate in the products was attributed to acidogenesis as well as homoacetogenesis. Homoacetogens was reported to produce acetate autotrophically or heterotrophically. Glucose was converted to acetate stoichiometrically, e.g., 1mol glucose to 3mol of acetate (C6H12O6 →3CH3COOH). On the other hand, homoacetogens can produce acetate by reduction of CO2 with H2. The autotrophic pathway is called Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Collins et al., 1994). In this pathway, CO2 is reduced to CO and formic acid or directly to a formyl group, the formyl group is reduced to a methyl group and then combined with CO and CoA to produce acetyl-CoA which is transformed to acetate (2CO2 +4H2 →CH3COO− +H+ +2H2O; Ragsdale and Pierce, 2008). In this research, the efficiency of autotrophic pathway was 32.8%, and the low efficiency may be related to the microenvironment e.g. relative low pH of 4.0–5.5. The butyrate-producing pathway also was active under this condition. During this pathway, pyruvate was converted to butyrate through several steps with the intermediates such as acetyl-CoA, acetacetyl-CoA and butryl-CoA, in the meantime, CO2 and ATP were produced and NADH was used to reduce the intermediate. Commonly, bacterial community and operational conditions are the major factors that determine the metabolic pathways in the acidogenic process. In this research, after the strategies such as headspace removal at fixed intervals and CO2 sparging throughout fermentation, most of pathways were enhanced because of the reducing inhibition of high P H2; however, the prevailing pathways did not change due to the similar microbial communities. In treatment T3 with the enhancement of homoacetogenesis, the abundant microorganisms shifted to homoacetogens, which resulted in the significant change of pathways during acidogenic fermentation."
15,Conclusion,Decreasing P H2 is favorable for enhancing the production of carboxylic acids during acidogenic fermentation of glucose. The production of carboxylic acids increased in T1–T3 which was 1.04–1.30-fold of that in the control. The composition of carboxylic acids changed and more acetate and butyrate were produced in T3 with the enhancement of homoacetogenesis as evidenced by the microbial analysis. Carbon balance showed decreasing P H2 led to more carbon flow to carboxylic acids. Further study to improve the proportion of specific acid should be explored.
