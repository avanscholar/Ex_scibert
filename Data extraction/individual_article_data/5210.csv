0,Introduction,"Magnesium fluoride has been applied for many years as a catalyst support. The resistance of MgF2 to hydrogen fluoride causes that it has been successfully used in reactions of hydrodechlorination of chlorofluorocarbons [1–6], in catalytic fluorination of 2-chloropyridine to 2-fluoropyridine [7] and fluorination of CF3CH2Cl [8,9]. Magnesium fluoride was also successfully applied as a support of metallic and oxide active phases in the reactions of hydrodesulfurization [10,11], low-temperature CO oxidation [12,13], NO reduction by propene and NO decomposition [14,15], Michael additions [16], ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile over V2O5/MgF2 [17,18], and oxidation of furfural and 5-hydromethylfurfural [19]. The VOx/MgF2 and Pt doped VOx/MgF2 catalysts were proved to be active for acetone, methanol, ethanol, and benzene photodegradation [20,21]. Recently, magnesium fluoride has been employed as a support of platinum, iridium and ruthenium catalysts for selective hydrogenation of nitro group of ortho-chloronitrobenzene to amino group [22]. It has been found that nitrobenzene adsorption centers on MgF2 surface are characterized by a considerable heterogeneity and among them are active sites of optimal acid strength and geometry which create favourable conditions for hydrogenation of nitro group [23]. Magnesium fluoride has quite an inert surface which contains only Lewis acid centers of weak and medium acid strength as well as weak basic sites [24,25]. However, the properties of MgF2 surface can be modified to quite a wide range. By admixturing MgF2 with transition metal ions at the oxidation state of +3 (Fe3+, Cr3+, V3+, In3+, Ga3+), relatively strong Lewis acid sites are generated [8,26–29]. On the other hand, a change in the hydroxylation degree of high-surface area MgF2 (HS-MgF2) results in the formation of Brønsted acid centers, besides already mentioned Lewis acid centers, so the bi-acidic surface is obtained [16,30,31]. Although numerous modifications of magnesium fluoride have been reported in the literature, no reports were published on the isomorphous substitution of magnesium ions with metal ions at the oxidation state +2 with the formation of solid solution. In the present study we put forward a hypothesis that replacement of Mg2+ cations by d-electron transition metals should result in a change in electronic properties, thereby adsorption and catalytic properties as well. In this work we have introduced Co into the rutile-type structure of MgF2. Since cobalt(II) fluoride has the same crystal structure as MgF2 (tetragonal, P42/mnm), and ionic radius of Co2+ approximates that of Mg2+, a possibility exists that the rutile-type structure of the new bimetallic fluoride will be preserved and only its electronic properties will change. Our calculations performed using density functional theory (DFT) and presented in this paper have shown that the introduction of cobalt into the structure of magnesium fluoride results in a linear decrease in the positive charge of cations and reduction in the strength of Lewis acid centers of such a binary fluoride. We have assumed that the changes in the strength of Lewis acid centers will influence adsorption and catalytic properties of both the support and platinum deposited on it. The electronic interactions of the modified support with the active phase present on its surface are expected to yield new catalytic properties. Our earlier studies have shown that the advantage of employing MgF2 as a support can surpass that obtained when using Al2O3. In the reaction of hydrogenation of o-CNB, the catalyst containing 1 wt.% Pt on MgF2 was six times more active than that containing 1 wt.%Pt on Al2O3 [22]. In another study [23], it was reported that the activity of Pt/MgF2 catalyst fivefold exceeded that of Pt/Al2O3. Magnesium fluoride also worked out as a support of active and selective ruthenium and iridium catalysts [22] however, their activity was lower than that of Pt/MgF2 catalyst. In the present study we prepared catalysts containing 0.5 wt.% Pt on MgCoF binary fluorides and their catalytic properties were tested in the reaction of selective hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to ortho-chloroaniline (o-CAN). Selective catalytic reduction of halogenated nitroaromatic compounds is the most widely used method for the synthesis of halogenated anilines, important intermediates in the chemistry of pesticides, herbicides, drugs, pigments and dyes [32,33]. The reaction is usually conducted in the liquid phase in an autoclave using gaseous hydrogen under elevated pressure. A disadvantage of the aforementioned method is the occurrence of secondary reactions of hydrodechlorination of chloroanilines, which reduces the process selectivity. It results both from higher reactivity of CCl bond in chloroaniline compared to that in chloronitrobenzene [34–36], and from the difference in the strength of adsorption of the above compounds on catalyst surface. We have assumed that the modification of the Lewis acidity (its decrease) caused by the introduction of cobalt into the structure of MgF2 can have a positive effect on the strength and mode of chloronitrobenzene adsorption. During the first minutes of the reaction conducted in the batch reactor, when the catalyst surface is covered by adsorbed nitro groups, the access to the surface is hindered for other functional groups [37]. As the reaction progresses and chloronitrobenzene runs out, the surface centers are no more blocked and this enables other functional groups to react and chloroaniline undergoes hydrodechlorination to aniline. A removal of reaction products from the reaction zone by conducting hydrogenation using the flow method can solve the problem. Hence we carried out, in addition to the tests in the batch reactor, also tests in flow conditions. The reaction medium in chloronitrobenzene hydrogenation usually contains alcohols or an alcohol-water mixture [38,39]. The solvent that makes the reaction medium can also serve as a source of hydrogen generated in the catalytic reaction of the aqueous-phase reforming (APR). The mentioned reaction has recently been widely applied to generate hydrogen utilized in fuel cells [40–42]. However, its potential is much greater since it includes not only hydrogen production, but also in situ utilization of hydrogen in hydrogenation reactions. As an example can serve the aqueous phase hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol catalyzed by 5% Ru/Al2O3 and 5% Pt/Al2O3 [43]. Cao and co-workers [44] have carried out in situ reduction of furfural with hydrogen from the APR of methanol on the Raney Ni catalyst. The above authors have established that the availability of limited amount of hydrogen is the vital factor to control the reaction selectivity. Li et al. [45] have employed in situ obtained hydrogen from APR of methanol (or ethanol) over Raney Ni or Pd/Al2O3 catalyst for hydrogenation of phenol and its derivatives to get cyclohexanone selectivity higher than that achieved using gaseous H2. They found that limited amount of adsorbed hydrogen from the APR of methanol or ethanol favors the formation of cyclohexanone, whereas excessive amount of hydrogen adsorbed when using gaseous H2 favors the formation of cyclohexanol during phenol hydrogenation. Examples of employing in situ generated hydrogen from the aqueous-phase reforming of alcohols for the reduction of nitro group are scarce in the literature [45–47]. Li et al. [46] were first to apply the in situ generated hydrogen to reduce nitrobenzene to aniline and its N-alkylation to N-alkyl arylamine. Zhou et al. [47] have conducted hydrogenation of halogenated nitrobenzene over Ru–Fe/C catalyst and obtained o-chloroaniline with 98.0% selectivity at 99.8% conversion without hydrodehalogenation. We proved [39], that the use of magnesium fluoride as a support of iridium and ruthenium made it possible to produce catalysts showing high selectivity for o-CNB reduction to o-CAN in APR conditions, however, their activity was unsatisfactory. On the other hand, platinum catalyst was characterized by a higher activity, but its selectivity to o-CAN was not high [48]. This is why the aim of the present study was to perform such a modification of MgF2 that the selectivity of platinum catalyst supported on the modified magnesium fluoride, in the reduction of o-CNB to o-CAN, will be improved. The modification consisted in doping MgF2 with cobalt to change electronic properties of the support as well as those of supported platinum."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of MgF2-CoF2 supports (binary MgCoF fluorides),"2.1 Preparation of MgF2-CoF2 supports (binary MgCoF fluorides) The binary MgCoF fluorides were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O to an aqueous solution of NH4F, followed by stirring with a magnetic stirrer for half an hour at room temperature. The formed precipitate was centrifuged and washed twice with distilled water. Then it was dried at 120 °C for 10 h with temperature ramp of 0.1 °C min−1 in static air, followed by treatment with hydrogen in a tubular furnace at 300 °C for 5 h (temperature ramp: 5 °C min−1). The obtained binary fluorides with different cobalt content were denoted as XCo, where X stands for CoF2 content expressed in mol.% (taking as 100% the total content of MgF2 + CoF2). Monofluorides were given the codes 100 Mg and 100Co. The composition of the samples and their codes are presented in Table 1 . The presence of fluorine did not permit using the ICP method for the determination of the composition of samples, therefore we employed the SEM-EDS method (for details see Section 2.4.2)."
3,Preparation of platinum catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of platinum catalysts To introduce platinum on the surface of binary fluorides we employed conventional impregnation (instead of e.g. co-precipitation method), because we wished to avoid encapsulation of platinum in the bulk of the supports. Moreover, the addition of hexafluoroplatinic acid into the solution from which binary fluorides were precipitated, could disturb the process of precipitate formation. Platinum (in the amount of 0.5 wt.%) was introduced by impregnation from an aqueous solution. To this end, 0.5 g of a support was mixed with 7 mL of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution containing 0.354 mg Pt mL−1. Thus formed suspension was stirred on a rotary evaporator for 1 h at 50 °C, followed by evaporation to dryness. Then the samples were dried at 110 °C for 24 h, followed by heating in hydrogen flow (30 mL min−1) in a tubular furnace at 300 °C for 6 h (temperature ramp: 5 °C min−1). The catalysts were denoted as Pt/XCo."
4,Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations of cation charges,"2.3 Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations of cation charges MgF2 crystal has a tetragonal P42/mnm structure with two formula units in the unit cell. On the basis of such a primitive cell from a crystallographic database, a supercell has been created in Gaussian using the Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) module [49]. Once the supercell for MgF2 crystal has been generated (a supercell consists of 24 Mg atoms and 48F atoms), a substitution of Co2+ cations for Mg2+ ones in the tetragonal rutile-type structure of MgF2 crystal was made. The supercell used in calculations is shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary material. Calculations were carried out for the supercell containing from 0 to 12 Co atoms, which corresponds to molar content within the range of 0–50 mol.%. For each structure, the average cation and anion charges were calculated as the arithmetic mean of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) data (natural charges). Natural (localized) orbitals are used in computational chemistry to calculate the distribution of electron density in atoms and in bonds between them. One can notice that many molecular properties of the molecule like electronic structure, dipole moment, polarizability, etc. are affected strongly by atomic charges. The theoretical calculations were made to capture the trend of changes in the value of network charges after the introduction of cobalt into the structure of magnesium fluoride, hence the obtained results should be regarded as indicative. The theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) in Gaussian 09 software package at the level of PBE1PBE with basis sets of 3–21 g for Mg, F and LANL2DZ for Co [49]."
5,Catalysts characterization,"2.4 Catalysts characterization 2.4.1 X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) The XRD measurements of the supports were carried out in the 2θ range from 20 to 81° on a powder diffractometer D8 Advance manufactured by Bruker AXS, using CuKα1 radiation. Incident X-ray photons excite cobalt electrons in the sample, which results in the emission of the characteristic X-ray radiation. Samples that are rich in Co, Fe, Cr, fluoresce under the incident CuKα beam and create polychromatic radiation. This radiation will not affect peak position or intensity; it will only increase the background. To reduce the noise the LYNXEYE detector was used, which ensured the elimination of cobalt fluorescence effect from Cu radiation, allowing for lowering background. The unit cell parameters were calculated using WinPlotr and UnitCellWin programs. The crystallite sizes of the supports were calculated by Scherrer's equation on the basis of the 3–6 strongest reflections. 2.4.2 Scanning electron microscopy with EDS system (SEM-EDS) Scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed using a Quanta FEG 250 (FEI) microscope in high vacuum conditions at the acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted at beam acceleration voltage of 15 kV using an EDAX Octane SDD detector. To determine elemental compositions of samples, 9–15 EDS measurements were performed for 3–4 regions of each sample. Measurement error was expressed as standard deviation. 2.4.3 BET surface area and porosity measurements The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas were determined by N2 adsorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 sorptometer. Total pore volume and average pore radius were determined by applying the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method to the isotherm desorption branch. Prior to the measurements of adsorption/desorption isotherms, the samples were outgassed at 225 °C for 4 h. 2.4.4 Acidity measurements: temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia was carried out using a ChemiSorb 2705 instrument (Micromeritics). Catalyst samples of about 500 mg were activated in-situ for 1 h at 300 °C in helium at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. Then they were cooled down to 100 °C and contacted with NH3 for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1 followed by flushing with helium (30 mL min−1) for 30 min. Measurements of temperature-programmed desorption were conducted in helium flow (30 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 300 °C. The desorbing ammonia was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the signal intensity was normalized to 100 mg for each sample studied. The calibration was performed by dispensing 1 mL NH3 from a calibrated gas loop into the helium flow. 2.4.5 Acidity measurements: FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-FTIR) In situ IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer equipped with a Pyrex IR cell connected to a conventional vacuum system. The sample (30 mg) was pressed into self-supporting wafer, having a surface area of 1.77 cm2 on each face, and mounted into the IR cell equipped with KRS-5 windows. The spectra were recorded with 32 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution. A reference spectrum of the catalyst wafer, taken at measurement temperature, was subtracted from each spectrum. Prior to each experiment, samples were first preheated at 280 °C overnight under reduced pressure (0.4 Pa), followed by cooling to 50 °C under dynamic vacuum conditions. Pyridine adsorption (0.6 kPa) was carried out at 50 °C for 10 min. Spectra were recorded after a 10-min evacuation. 2.4.6 The determination of Pt dispersion by hydrogen chemisorption All chemisorption experiments were performed on an ASAP 2010C sorptometer. The samples were evacuated for 15 min at room temperature, then at 275 °C for 60 min, followed by reduction in hydrogen flow (40 mL min−1) at 275 °C and evacuation at 300 °C for 120 min. The treatment in hydrogen flow was aimed at removing contaminants which could adsorb when samples were in contact with air. Chemisorption of hydrogen was carried out at 35 °C and the isotherms were determined using 5 different pressures in the range of 12–40 kPa. By assuming the stoichiometry of one hydrogen atom per one surface platinum atom (Pts), the dispersion of platinum (D) can be expressed as D = Pts/Ptt = H/Ptt (where Ptt – total number of platinum atoms)."
6,Catalytic activity in hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene,"2.5 Catalytic activity in hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene 2.5.1 Hydrogenation of o-CNB in an autoclave in the presence of gaseous H2 Hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to ortho-chloroaniline (o-CAN) over platinum catalysts was carried out in the liquid-phase at 30 °C for 2 h under hydrogen pressure of 4.0 MPa in a 200 mL stainless steel autoclave with an inside glass tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The autoclave was loaded with 50 mg of catalyst and 50 mL of 0.5 M methanolic solution of o-CNB. Then the autoclave was flushed several times with helium followed by flushing with hydrogen in order to remove air. In each case, the reaction time was 2 h and stirring rate was 1000 rpm. Catalytic tests were carried out also for no platinum-containing supports. However, due to their low activity, the reaction was carried out at a higher temperature (120 °C) under hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa for 2 h using a lower o-CNB concentration (0.1 M). Results of the experiments show that the reaction was conducted in the absence of external mass transport limitations (the stirring rates from 800 to 1000 rpm did not affect the reaction rate). The reaction products were analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column DB-1 and FID detector. A comparison of chromatographic peak areas of the initial reaction mixture with those of post-reaction mixture has shown that the products and the reactants were well balanced in mass. For the most active catalyst, a reuse test was performed by repeating the reaction five times using the same catalyst sample (separated from the post-reaction mixture by centrifugation). A fresh reaction mixture was employed in each repetition of the reaction. 2.5.2 Hydrogenation of o-CNB by the flow method in the presence of gaseous H2 Hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN with gaseous hydrogen was carried out at 30 °C in an X-Cube® flow reactor manufactured by ThalesNano Inc. It enables to conduct flow reactions under elevated pressure at temperatures up to 200 °C. To carry out reactions at higher temperatures, the system was expanded by adding an external reactor equipped with an electronically controlled furnace (Fig. S2). The flow rate of the reaction mixture (0.1 M o-CNB in methanol) was 0.2 mL min−1, catalyst weight 40 mg, H2 pressure 2 MPa. The reaction products were collected in a receiver and analyzed in 15-minute intervals on a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column DB-1 and FID detector. A blind test carried out in the absence of catalyst proved that no conversion of o-CNB occurred. 2.5.3 Hydrogenation of o-CNB with in situ generated hydrogen in the aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of methanol in a continuous-flow reactor Hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN with in situ generated hydrogen from aqueous-phase reforming of methanol was conducted in an X-Cube® reactor (ThalesNano, Inc.). The reaction was carried out in continuous-flow mode in an isothermal fixed-bed reactor at 225 °C. Both reactions, i.e. aqueous-phase reforming of methanol (that is the source of hydrogen) and hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzene proceeded at the same time in the same reactor and in the presence of the same catalyst. Flow rate of the reaction mixture (0.1 M o-CNB in the mixture of methanol:water = 2:1 by volume) was 0.2 mL min−1, catalyst weight 40 mg (0.08 mL), and liquid pressure 3 MPa. Inner diameter of the reactor was 3.8 mm. At the above parameters, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was 150 h−1 and space time (ST = volume of catalyst bed/volume flow rate) was ∼24 s. The reaction products were collected in a receiver and analyzed in 15-minute intervals on a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column DB-1 and FID detector. A blind test carried out in the absence of catalyst proved that no conversion of o-CNB occurred. Since the subject of this study was hydrogenation of o-CNB using APR of methanol as a source of hydrogen, no quantitative analysis of gaseous products was carried out. Qualitative analysis has shown the presence of H2, CO2, CH4 and trace amounts of CO originating from the reaction of methanol reforming. 2.5.4 Analysis of reaction products The desired product of o-chloronitrobenzene hydrogenation is o-chloroaniline. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of gaseous hydrogen (in an autoclave and in hydrogen flow), the post-reaction mixture contained also aniline (AN) and nitrobenzene (NB), which were formed as a result of a side reaction of hydrodechlorination. Sometimes a slight amount of another product was observed, however, it has not been identified because of its insignificant quantity (the above product was denoted as X). Therefore, the selectivity to o-chloroaniline was expressed as the ratio of the obtained o-CAN to the total amount of all products: S = o-CAN o-CAN + AN + NB + X · 100 % In the case of hydrogenation conducted at APR conditions, the sole product was o-CAN. No products of side reactions of o-CAN or o-CNB were observed, hence the selectivity to o-CAN was 100%."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Crystal structure and texture of binary fluorides,"3.1 Crystal structure and texture of binary fluorides 3.1.1 XRD studies The MgF2-CoF2 systems have been obtained by co-precipitation from an aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate - cobalt(II) nitrate mixture and ammonium fluoride: Mg(NO3)2 + Co(NO3)2 + 4NH4F → MgF2 + CoF2 + 4NH4NO3 Three samples of binary fluorides containing 0.6, 7.5 and 37.4 mol.% of CoF2 as well as samples of bare MgF2 and bare CoF2 were prepared. The composition and codes of the obtained fluorides were listed in Table 1 (Section 2.1, Experimental). Transition metal fluorides, contrary to alkaline earth fluorides, are gradually converted during calcination into oxyfluorides and then into oxides [50]. To prevent the formation of oxyfluorides, dry samples were heated at 300 °C in hydrogen. Our goal was to isostructurally introduce cobalt cations in place of magnesium cations into the MgF2 structure and to apply such binary Mg-Co fluorides as platinum catalyst supports. Both fluorides, MgF2 and CoF2, crystallize in the rutile-type structure (P42/mnm) and take the same coordination numbers. The ionic radii of Mg2+ (0.72 Å) and Co2+ (0.735 Å) [51] are very close to each other, hence their isomorphous substitution is possible with the formation of a solid solution. Analysis of diffractograms enables the determination of crystal structure of new binary fluorides, as well as the determination of unit cell parameters and crystallite sizes. In our work, the results of XRD studies provide conclusive evidence for the formation of solid solutions of MgCoF binary fluorides. In Fig. 1 A presented are X-ray patterns of fluoride samples. All of them have shown only reflections characteristic of tetragonal rutile structure. The reflections are single, symmetrical which indicates the homogeneity of the binary fluoride phase. (In the case of a mechanical mixture of MgF2 and CoF2, independent reflections of both compounds are obtained what manifests itself by the presence of “double” reflections). A small addition of Co (samples 0.6Co and 7.5Co) does not result in noticeable changes in the crystallinity compared to bare MgF2. Only a greater Co content (the sample 37.4Co) brings about some reduction in the crystallinity. A similar effect of the crystallinity reduction has been observed by Kemnitz et al. [52], who doped MgF2 with V3+ ions. A thorough analysis of reflections shows the absence of MgF2 and CoF2 separate phases and the formation of a homogeneous rutile-type structure in which Co2+ ions are homogeneously dispersed in the MgF2 lattice. This resulted in changes of the unit cell parameters as shown in Fig. 1B. The unit cell parameters for MgF2 and c/a ratio are in agreement with literature data [53,54], namely they are as follows: a = 4.63 Å, c = 3.05 Å, c/a = 0.659 and unit cell volume = 65.5 Å3. According to Vegard’s law, unit cell parameters should change linearly with the solid solution composition. Usually, a unit cell expands if a small ion is replaced by a larger ion and vice versa. This reveals itself by a shift in the position of reflections towards lower 2θ angles. Indeed, the addition of 37.4 mol.% of Co (the sample 37.4Co) causes a marked shift of reflections to lower 2θ angles and increase in values of the unit cell parameters which grow towards those of CoF2 (a = 4.71, c = 3.17 Å) [55]. However, if Co content was small (samples 0.6Co and 7.5Co), such a growth was not observed (Fig. 1B). Generally, the crystal structure of the three samples: 100 Mg, 0.6Co, 7.5Co should be regarded as almost identical. Changes in the size of crystallites (material crystallinity) are manifested by a change in half-width of reflections. A reduction in the half-width of reflections indicates an increase in the crystallite sizes. This enables to calculate crystallite sizes using Scherrer’s formula (insert in Fig. 1A). They are ∼ 12 nm for 100 Mg, 0.6Co and 7.5Co samples, whereas somewhat smaller (8.6 nm) for 37.4Co. Crystallite size of 100Co sample, that is characterized by the narrowest reflections, is 31.5 nm. Poor crystallinity of 37.4Co sample indicates its mostly amorphous character. 3.1.2 SEM and EDS analysis In Fig. 2 SEM images have been shown of 100 Mg, 37.4Co and 100Co samples. The sample 100 Mg is characterized by crystalline structure. The structure of 100Co sample is considerably more fine-crystalline (spongy). The morphology of the sample 37.4Co resembles both bare MgF2 (large coarse-crystalline structures are present) and bare CoF2 (the presence of fine-crystalline structures). The EDS measurements enable a verification of the composition of the prepared materials. If MgF2 and CoF2 in our materials form separate phases, they should be visible on maps of Co and Mg distribution as areas rich in one element. In Fig. 3 presented are EDS maps for F, Mg and Co in which a fragment characterized by a high degree of crystallinity was purposely chosen. Distribution maps of elements display a homogeneous dispersion of fluorine, magnesium and cobalt within sample, which confirms the formation of binary fluoride solid solution. At the same time, the above results rule out the occurrence of separate phases of MgF2 and CoF2, thus confirming conclusions drawn from the XRD studies. 3.1.3 Surface area and porosity. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements Binary fluorides prepared in this study are new systems that never before were employed in catalysis. This is why we carried out measurements of such important parameters as porosity and surface area. All the supports (Fig. S3) and catalysts (Fig. 4 ) were characterized by type IV(a) isotherms (according to the IUPAC classification [56]) with a clearly marked hysteresis loop that testifies to their mesoporosity (except for Pt/100Co, the porosity of which is negligible). The shape of adsorption/desorption isotherms of binary fluoride supports is very similar to that observed for catalysts and for this reason the isotherms of supports were moved to the Supplementary material (Fig. S3). The shape of hysteresis loop (type H2(b)) indicates that the catalyst Pt/100 Mg has mainly cylindrical pores as results from the parallel course of the isotherm adsorption and desorption branches in the range of p/p0 0.7–0.9. The fact that the hysteresis loop closes at p/p0 = 0.4 indicates that small cone-shaped pores are present as well. The isotherms measured for the Pt/0.6Co and Pt/7.5Co catalysts are very similar to the isotherm for the catalyst Pt/Mg100 which indicates that the effect of small additions of CoF2 on the catalyst texture is scant. A distinct change in the shape of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms was observed only when the contribution of CoF2 reached 37.4 mol.%. The shape of the latter isotherm is typical of mesoporous materials with cylindrical pores. The catalyst Pt/100Co is a non-porous material as evidenced by its low surface area and the absence of hysteresis loop in the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm. Pore size distributions (Fig. 4B) in the platinum catalysts supported on 100 Mg, 0.6Co and 37.4Co are very similar – they are characterized by a wide range of sizes from 2 to 30 nm. With increasing amount of CoF2 in supports, the pore sizes gradually decrease. On the other hand, the catalyst Pt/37.4Co is characterized by a relatively narrow pore size distribution with a maximum at about 10 nm. The low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to calculate surface areas of supports and platinum catalysts – Fig. 5 . Surface area of supports gradually increases from 36.5 m2 g−1 for bare MgF2 to 49.0 m2 g−1 for 37.4Co. Similar changes are observed in the case of surface area of catalysts, however, the latter is always somewhat smaller than surface area of relevant supports. The decrease in surface area is a result of the deposition of active phase and additional wet and thermal treatment during catalyst preparation. The sample 37.4 Co has the greatest surface area what correlates with results of XRD measurements, which indicated high amorphicity of the sample (the highest among the catalysts studied). The lowest surface areas were found in 100Co samples – in the case of bare CoF2 16.0 m2 g−1 and in that of Pt/100Co only 4.7 m2 g−1. This shows that MgF2 plays the role of a textural stabilizer in MgCoF binary fluorides."
9,Theoretical calculations of lattice charges using DFT,"3.2 Theoretical calculations of lattice charges using DFT As it was already mentioned in the Introduction, this study was inspired by results of theoretical calculations by density functional theory method which showed that the positive charge accumulated on cations decreases with increasing amount of cobalt in the structure of MgCoF binary fluorides. The supercell used in the calculations is shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary material. Calculations were carried out for the supercell containing from 0 to 12 Co atoms which corresponds to molar content in the range of 0–50 mol.%. The results of the calculations are presented in Fig. 6 (exact values of charges on cations and anions for all the studied structures are shown in Supplementary material in Excel file). The dependence of the average cation charge on cobalt content in MgCoF binary fluorides is linear and its Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient is −0.99. As the amount of cobalt in the structure of MgCoF binary fluorides increases, the value of the positive charge accumulated on cations decreases. Similarly, the average value of negative charge accumulated on fluorine atoms also decreases and the dependence is linear, too (Pearson’s r = 0.99). The value of the positive charge accumulated on cations can be connected with the strength of Lewis acid centers. Thus, the reduction in the positive charge value indicates a decrease in the strength of Lewis acid centers. This hypothesis will be experimentally verified in the further part of our work. Changes in the positive charge value and connected with them changes in the strength of Lewis acid centers should influence the electronic properties of platinum supported on the surface of binary fluorides as well as on the catalytic properties. One can expect that the interaction between platinum and Lewis acid centers will result in the appearance of a partial positive charge on platinum crystallites. The reduction in Lewis acidity generated by the introduction of cobalt will limit this interaction and, due to this, the partial negative charge accumulated on platinum will be slightly greater than on bare Pt/100 Mg. These interactions should affect adsorption properties of both supports and catalysts. To determine the capability of chemisorbing chloronitrobenzene, we will employ nitrobenzene and observe its adsorbed species using FTIR technique (Section 3.5). In turn, the ability to chemisorb hydrogen will be determined by the volumetric method on the basis of chemisorption isotherm (Section 3.4)."
10,Surface acidity of supports,"3.3 Surface acidity of supports Magnesium fluoride is characterized by quite an inert surface which contains only Lewis acid centers of weak and medium acid strength as well as weak basic sites. Theoretical calculations (DFT) indicate that the introduction of cobalt into MgF2 structure should result in a decrease in the strength of Lewis acid centers. To confirm this hypothesis we carried out measurements of surface acidity using NH3-TPD technique and pyridine adsorption using IR spectroscopy. 3.3.1 Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) NH3-TPD measurements make it possible to determine not only the acid center concentration on the adsorbent surface, but also to observe the distribution of their acid strength. The NH3-TPD profiles were presented in Fig. 7 and results of their deconvolution in Fig. S4. The shape of the NH3-TPD profiles clearly indicates the presence of acid centers of different strength – weak centers which are responsible for the desorption peak at about 135 °C, medium strength centers responsible for the peak with the maximum at about 300 °C and strong centers from which ammonia is desorbed above 300 °C. The maximum desorption temperature in our study was just 300 °C which was dictated by the conditions of the preparation of binary fluorides (the latter were activated in hydrogen flow just at the above temperature). In the case of exceeding this temperature during the NH3-TPD measurements, the thermal decomposition of samples could occur and the evolved gases could be misinterpreted as ammonia because the employed detector (TCD) did not enable to identify the evolved gases. On the basis of the NH3-TPD profiles, the concentration of surface acid centers was calculated (Table 2 , column 1) and after deconvolution of the profiles (Fig. S4), the concentration of centers of weak, medium and high acid strength was evaluated (Fig. 8 ). The reduction in the strength of acid centers with increasing cobalt content, as suggested on the basis of DFT calculations, seems to be confirmed by the distribution of acid center strength – the contribution of strong acid centers to the total acidity decreases in favor of medium and weak acid centers. The decrease in the contribution of strong acid centers with increasing cobalt content in the binary fluorides is also evident, when their concentration is expressed per square meter of surface area of the supports (Table S1). 3.3.2 Infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption (Py-FTIR) The NH3-TPD study provided information on the strength and concentration of acid centers on the surface of supports. However, it could not determine their nature, therefore FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine was employed to this end. In Fig. 9 FTIR spectra recorded after pyridine adsorption on the surface of supports are presented. Bands characteristic of Py coordinately bound to Lewis acid sites were observed: ν19b at 1444.4 and ν8a at 1604.5 cm−1. No presence of Brønsted acid centers (1645 cm−1) was found. The position of the ν19b band at 1444.4 cm−1 may be indicative of the presence of Lewis acid centers of medium/weak strength. However, we should be very careful while interpreting the band at 1444 cm−1 because it can also originate from pyridine hydrogen-bonded to surface hydroxyl groups. To discriminate between H-bonded pyridine and weakly coordinated pyridine, observation of ν (CH) vibrations was carried out [57]. The analysis of the shape and position of bands originating from ν (CH) vibrations (Fig. S5) showed a great similarity to the spectrum of pyridine adsorbed on MgO [57], in which only weakly coordinated pyridine was observed. However, the main ν (CH) at 3076 cm−1 is clearly shifted relative to that observed for MgO (3062 cm−1) and this indicates a greater strength of Lewis acid sites on MgCoF binary fluorides compared to MgO. Much higher electronegativity of fluorine relative to oxygen provides an explanation for the differences – the ability of fluorine to withdraw electrons from magnesium ions is stronger than that of oxygen, therefore stronger Lewis acid centers are generated both on MgF2 and binary MgCoF fluorides. On the basis of the area of the band at 1444.4 cm−1, using pyridine molar extinction coefficient ε = 1.73 cm μmol−1 [42], the concentration of acid sites on the surface of MgCoF binary fluorides was estimated (Table 2 , column 2). The determination of real concentration of Lewis acid centers with the use of molar extinction coefficient (ε) is disputable [58,59]. However, to express concentration of acid centers in numerical values, we assumed ε = 1.73 cm μmol−1 (after Tamura et al. [60]). This is average value obtained from measurements carried out for a wide variety of different supports. In the further part of our work we also assumed after Tamura et al. the molar extinction coefficient for nitrobenzene. The concentration of acid sites increases with increasing cobalt content in the binary fluorides, reaching its maximum for 7.5Co, followed by a decrease to take the lowest value for bare CoF2. These results are in accordance with data obtained from NH3-TPD measurements. The changes in the concentration of acid sites do not correlate with the specific surface area, since the samples 0.6Co and 37.4Co, whose surface areas are close enough, differ considerably in the concentration of acid sites. Moreover, the sample 37.4Co, although its surface area (49.0 m2 g−1) is greater than that of 7.5Co (42.7 m2 g−1), has a lower acidity. It results from the above considerations that there is an optimal cobalt content at which on the surface of the binary fluorides the greatest number of acid centers is generated."
11,Nitrobenzene adsorption on Pt/MgCoF catalysts – FTIR study,"3.4 Nitrobenzene adsorption on Pt/MgCoF catalysts – FTIR study To determine the mode of chloronitrobenzene adsorption on the surface of catalysts, we employed nitrobenzene (NB) as a model compound, because o-chloronitrobenzene is a solid and its vapor pressure at room temperature is negligible. Although we do not have a direct evidence that the adsorption mode of chloronitrobenzene is the same as that of nitrobenzene, one can conclude indirectly (on the basis of similar activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of different halonitrobenzenes) that adsorption of nitrobenzene and halonitrobenzenes proceeds in a similar way – via NO2 group. After NB adsorption on the Pt/MgCoF catalysts, characteristic bands originating from stretching vibrations of nitro group - asymmetric νas(NO2) and symmetric νs(NO2) ones, were observed (Fig. 10 ). Wavenumbers of the bands, their shifts and intensity are listed in Table 3 . In the spectra of all catalysts a single band νas(NO2) was observed, whose position and intensity changed with the change in the composition of binary fluorides. The intensity of the band increased with increasing Co content in the binary fluorides, reaching a maximum for Pt/7.5Co catalyst and then it decreased (Table 2, column 3). The position of the band νas(NO2) also undergoes changes – it is shifted relative to liquid NB by 7.2–8.7 cm−1 towards higher wavenumbers (Table 3, column 2), which is indicative of nitrobenzene interaction with the surface of the samples via oxygen atoms of nitro group. Generally, the greater shift towards higher frequencies the stronger interaction with the catalyst surface. The shift observed for the samples Pt/100 Mg, Pt/0.6Co and Pt/7.5Co is greater than that for Pt/37.4Co and Pt/100Co, which testifies to a stronger adsorption on the former ones. The theoretical calculations by DFT method showed that the introduction of cobalt into the structure of MgF2 results in a reduction of the positive charge accumulated on cations, i.e. a decrease in the strength of Lewis acid centers. This is reflected by the strength with which NB is bonded – it decreases with increasing Co content in the binary fluorides. The amount of adsorbed nitrobenzene can be estimated on the basis of the νas(NO2) band intensity and hence the number of adsorption centers on the catalyst surface [60]. By employing the Lambert-Beer law and molar extinction coefficient for nitrobenzene ε = 7.56 cm μmol−1 [60], the concentration of NB adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts was determined (Table 2, column 3). The NB concentration on the surface of the samples grows with increasing Co content in the binary fluorides, reaching the maximum equal to 165 μmol g−1 for the Pt/7.5Co catalyst and then decreases. The surface concentration of NB on bare MgF2 is 48 μmol g−1, while that on bare CoF2 is only 3 μmol g−1. A strong correlation occurs with the observed changes in Lewis acidity determined on the basis of pyridine adsorption and NH3-TPD measurements. This fact is a strong argument for the hypothesis that nitrobenzene interacts with the catalyst surface by binding to a Lewis acid site. The shape and intensity of NB bands in the region of asymmetric vibrations of -NO2 group are very similar to those observed in the spectrum of liquid nitrobenzene (Fig. 10). This cannot be said about bands in the region of symmetric vibrations (1340–1400 cm−1). While in the case of liquid NB a single band with the maximum at 1346.3 cm−1 is observed, in that of the catalysts the signals are broad and consist of many components. Among them present is a band characteristic of νs(NO2) vibrations in nitrobenzene (∼1350 cm−1), which was denoted as νs1, as well as a broad band with a complex structure at 1355–1400 cm−1, denoted as νs2. Such a complexity of the structure of νs(NO2) bands indicates the presence of a multitude of NB adsorption species on the surface of Pt/MgCoF catalysts, thereby points to the heterogeneity of acid centers which are the sites for NB adsorption. The share of νs1 and νs2 components can be evaluated on the basis of their intensities (Table 3, column 7). A progressive rise is observed in the νs1/νs2 ratio from Pt/100 Mg to Pt/100Co which means a decrease in the share the component νs2. The highest intensity of νs(NO2) bands was observed for the Pt/7.5Co catalyst (Fig. 10B), similarly as it was in the case of asymmetric vibrations. To the best of our knowledge, such a behavior of νs(NO2) bands after nitrobenzene adsorption was not observed yet for any other catalyst. The intensity ratio of νas/νs bands contains information on the angle formed by ONO bonds in nitro groups [61]. The large complexity of νs bands in the spectra of the studied catalysts causes that a comparison of the intensity alone would be encumbered with a significant error. Hence, to calculate the νas/νs ratio we have used the area of bands instead of intensity (Table 3, column 8). The above ratio for NB in the liquid phase is 1.09, whereas for catalysts it ranges from 1.24 to 1.44. An increase of the νas/νs ratio means a rise of the O-N-O angle which in turn is associated with adsorption center geometry."
12,Hydrogen chemisorption measurements,"3.5 Hydrogen chemisorption measurements The amount of supported platinum was very small (0.5 wt.%), therefore observations of Pt0 reflections in X-ray diffraction patterns were not possible. In such a situation, the only effective technique appeared to be hydrogen chemisorption measurements. The measurements were carried out in a volumetric system at 35 °C, preceded by in situ activation of catalyst at 275 °C in hydrogen flow. On the basis of hydrogen chemisorption measurements, calculations were performed of average particle size (d), dispersion (D) and surface area of platinum (SPt). Results of the calculations are presented in Table 4 . To our mind, platinum is quite well dispersed on the studied supports, particularly when considering that the surface area of the catalysts is relatively small (Fig. 5), one can state that studied. The highest dispersion (∼36%) was obtained for the catalyst Pt/37.4Co which, to a certain extent, can be due to the greatest surface area of the support (large surface area is conducive to high dispersion of platinum)."
13,Catalytic tests for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN,"3.6 Catalytic tests for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN Catalytic activity of the prepared platinum catalysts has been studied in the reaction of selective hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to ortho-chloroaniline (o-CAN). The reaction was carried out using three methods: (a) batch method in a steel autoclave under hydrogen pressure, (b) flow method under hydrogen pressure; (c) flow method in conditions of in situ generation of hydrogen from alcohol and water by aqueous-phase reforming without using compressed hydrogen. In the reaction (c) methanol is not only a solvent, but also a reactant, which in the reaction of aqueous-phase reforming forms hydrogen consumed in the reaction of o-CNB hydrogenation. Hence in the reactions (a) and (b) we have also employed methanol as a solvent. Moreover, as proved in Ref. [62], methanol is one of the best solvents for the reaction of o-CNB hydrogenation, better than ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and hexane. 3.6.1 Catalytic tests for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN in a batch reactor In the presence of bare supports, the reaction was carried out at 120 °C under hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa for 2 h using 0.1 M solution of o-CNB in methanol. Catalytic activity of the supports was very low (conversion of 2–5%), however, their selectivity to o-CAN (91.0 – 99.9%) was high. Such high selectivities to o-CAN are a result of low conversion of parent compounds and this fact causes that secondary reactions of hydrodechlorination, which contribute to the highest extent to the selectivity decrease, are greatly limited by low concentration of the produced o-CAN. Cobalt catalysts have been used extremely rarely in the reaction of CNB reduction [63–65]. In each case, however, they contained metallic cobalt. In our catalysts, cobalt occurs in the form of CoF2, what explains their low activity. When platinum catalysts were employed in the same conditions as those used during testing of bare supports, 100% conversion was reached in a very short time. This is why we lowered the reaction temperature to 30 °C, at the same time increasing o-CNB concentration to 0.5 M (other reaction parameters remained unchanged). In these conditions, conversions on the level of 20–98% were obtained, depending on catalyst. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 11 . The highest activity was obtained in the presence of platinum catalysts supported on binary MgCoF fluorides. The admixture of cobalt to MgF2 is a decisive factor, because platinum supported on bare MgF2, and particularly on bare CoF2, shows lower activity. In our earlier studies [22,23], in which we have established that the activity of MgF2-based catalysts is 5–6 times higher than that based on Al2O3, the present results gain even more in importance. Also in the case of selectivity, a dependence on CoF2 content in supports has been observed. The best catalysts – Pt/7.5Co and Pt/37.4Co – reached a high selectivity to o-CAN (over 90–91%). The latter catalyst has also been subjected to reusability tests (Fig. 11B). It was characterized by a very high stability – no decrease in activity and selectivity was observed up to 3 runs (even a small increase in them occurred). Only after the fourth run a slight reduction in activity and selectivity was noticed. Taking into consideration that selectivity is the most important parameter in the reaction studied, one can acknowledge that the application of MgCoF systems as platinum supports instead of single metal fluoride-containing supports such as MgF2 or CoF2, enables to considerably improve selectivity, while at the same time increasing activity. Platinum has been known for its high activity for nitro group reduction in halogenated nitroaromatic compounds and, at the same time, for its high activity for hydrodechlorination [34,66]. This is why the search is conducted for supports capable of limiting the occurrence of hydrodechlorination. The MgCoF supports studied by us seem to be interesting materials combining high activity for nitro group reduction and retardation of undesirable reaction of hydrodechlorination. 3.6.2 Catalytic tests for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN with gaseous hydrogen in a flow reactor Reduction of chloronitrobenzene to chloroaniline is usually conducted in a batch reactor under elevated hydrogen pressure. The latter method is by its nature quite a difficult and this is why attempts are made to replace it by flow method. In the initial minutes of the reaction, we have observed small fluctuations of activity and selectivity, which can be seen in Fig. S6, but after 105 min they stabilized. In Fig. 12 presented are activity and selectivity observed after 105 min of the reaction when it was carried out in a flow reactor at 30 °C. Similarly as it was in the case of the reaction conducted in the batch reactor, also in that of the reaction carried out by a continuous-flow method, very high activity and selectivity were achieved. The most active and the most selective catalyst was Pt/7.5Co. The contact time of substrates and reaction products with catalyst surface is in the case of the flow method considerably shorter than that during the reaction proceeding in a batch reactor, therefore we have expected a selectivity increase, when the latter method was applied. Unfortunately, no improvement in the selectivity was observed and even some deterioration occurred. We believe that the reason for such a result was too long space time equal to 24sec (LHSV = 150 h−1). Most likely this time was long enough to bring about hydrodechlorination of chloroaniline as a result of consecutive reactions which cause a reduction in the selectivity. 3.6.3 Catalytic tests for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN in a flow reactor at APR conditions in the absence of gaseous hydrogen In the aqueous phase reforming, reactions proceed between an organic compound (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol) and water, which yield mainly hydrogen of high purity [39,41,67,68]. According to the literature reports, this hydrogen can be utilized in a simultaneous reaction of hydrogenation, if a reducible compound is present in the reaction medium [39,69,70]. In our case, such a compound has been o-CNB (Scheme 1 ). The reaction was carried out in an X-Cube® pressure reactor at 225 °C (such a high temperature was necessary to start the APR reaction) under pressure of 3 MPa using o-CNB dissolved in the methanol:water mixture (2:1 by vol.) as reactants. Results of catalytic activity measurements are presented in Fig. 13 . In the initial minutes of the reaction a gradual decrease in the activity was observed (Fig. S7). The stabilization of the activity occurred after about 150 min. Platinum catalysts on 7.5Co and 37.4Co supports showed the highest activity, similarly as it was in the case of batch and flow conditions. The catalysts on bare MgF2 and bare CoF2 supports were less active. It is worth noticing that during hydrogenation of o-CNB in APR conditions the selectivity to o-CAN was always 100%, irrespective of catalyst employed and conversion obtained. This proves that the catalyst structure influences only catalytic activity, whereas high selectivity is rather associated with means of hydrogen supply, which has already been observed by the authors of the study on hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone [45]. In situ generated hydrogen from the reaction of APR is consumed directly for nitro group reduction which results in much lower concentration of hydrogen on the catalyst surface than that observed during the reaction conducted with the use of gaseous hydrogen that is intentionally supplied with a large excess. A higher reactivity of nitro group compared to that of C-Cl bond causes that hydrogen is consumed in the first place by the nitro group reduction. Due to this fact, the side reaction of C-Cl bond hydrogenolysis is totally blocked, which permits to reduce o-CNB to o-CAN with 100% selectivity. Similarly, the reactions of hydrogen with CO or CO2, which lead to the formation of hydrocarbons as a consequence of methanation or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, are blocked because of fast consumption of hydrogen by nitro group hydrogenation."
14,Summary,"The results of theoretical calculations performed using density functional theory (DFT) showed that the introduction of cobalt ions into MgF2 lattice results in a reduction in the value of positive charge (a decrease in the strength of Lewis acid centers) on cations present in the lattice. Inspired by these results, we prepared a series of binary MgCoF fluorides with different cobalt content and experimentally confirmed the theoretical predictions that the introduction of Co2+ ions into the MgF2 lattice results in the reduction in the strength of acid sites (NH3-TPD) and that these sites are solely Lewis acid centers (Py-FTIR). At the same time, the presence of cobalt ions is a source of new surface defects what results in an increase in the number of acid centers. A strong correlation of the catalytic activity for o-CNB hydrogenation with the concentration of acid sites and the amount of adsorbed nitrobenzene (Fig. 14 ) shows that the mode of nitrobenzene adsorption on acid sites determines its reactivity. The FTIR studies of adsorbed nitrobenzene indicate that it forms on the surface of binary fluorides the complexes which were not observed earlier. The aforementioned complexes are responsible for the activation of –NO2 group, which results in an increase in its reactivity. We believe that nitrobenzene adsorption proceeds on the boundary centers located between platinum crystallites and support. The presence of electron-rich cobalt ions in the support enables a shift of negative charge from Co onto Pt, which leads to the formation of electron-rich Pt centers. Electron-deficient Mg2+ species and electron-rich Pt species are the adsorption centers for chloronitrobenzene via oxygen atom and nitrogen atom from -NO2 group as shown in Scheme 2 . Such a cooperative interaction between Co and Pt also causes that hydrogen atoms formed on platinum are bound more weakly, thereby are more reactive. The source of high selectivity of a catalyst is rightfully sought in its structure, therefore to attain high selectivity the catalyst is subjected to a number of modifications. Our attempts at modifying MgF2 with cobalt ions made it possible to increase the selectivity of Pt/MgCoF catalysts by a dozen or even several dozen per cent. However, no matter if the reaction was carried out in batch or flow mode, we were unable to reach the most desirable level of 100%. Only a change of the approach to the reaction – the elimination of gaseous hydrogen and its replacement with hydrogen generated in situ in the reaction of aqueous-phase reforming of methanol – radically improved the reaction selectivity enabling to attain 100% selectivity to o-CAN."
15,Conclusions,"1. A method has been developed for the preparation of binary magnesium-cobalt fluorides that makes it possible to obtain a homogeneous rutile-type structure in which magnesium ions are isomorphously substituted with cobalt ions. 2. The substitution of magnesium ions with cobalt ions results in an increase in surface area, surface acidity and nitrobenzene adsorption ability of binary magnesium-cobalt fluorides compared to single fluorides of these metals. It has a crucial effect on the activity for hydrogenation of o-CNB. 3. Chloronitrobenzene adsorbs on metal-support boundary centers present on the surface of Pt/MgCoF catalysts via: (1) nitrogen atom of nitro group and electron-rich platinum centers and (2) via oxygen atom of nitro group and electron deficient Mg2+ ions (Lewis acidic centers). 4. Platinum catalysts supported on the binary fluoride systems (7.5Co and 37.4Co) have excellent catalytic properties for hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN. These catalysts are the best, irrespective of method of conducting the process (batch, flow or APR). 5. The most effective means of supplying hydrogen for the reduction of nitro group present in o-CNB is in-situ generation of hydrogen in the reaction of aqueous phase reforming of methanol (APR). In these conditions, hydrogenation of o-CNB proceeds with 100% selectivity to o-CAN, which was unattainable in the presence of gaseous hydrogen."
