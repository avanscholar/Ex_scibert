0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for future society that is not dependent on fossil fuel energy. There are various hydrogen sources such as hydrocarbon species and oxygenate hydrocarbons including alcohol. Methanol has merits of being liquid phase and having high hydrogen to carbon ratio. Hydrogen is extracted by reforming processes including partial oxidation, steam reforming and dry reforming. The steam reforming is most suitable for methanol because it produces the largest amount of hydrogen per unit mole of methanol. The temperature for methanol-steam reforming should be above 250 °C considering thermodynamic equilibrium to get methanol conversion above 80% [1]. High reforming temperature caused serious catalyst deteriorations; thus, the periodic catalyst replacement was required. Cu-based catalysts have been mostly used for methanol-steam reforming [2]. The activity, stability and durability of catalysts still need to be improved. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the reforming temperature. Recently, plasma-catalyst hybrid process has been attempted to reduce the reforming temperature [3–6]. Yu et al. [4] performed CO2 reforming of propane in combination of non-thermal plasma and Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. They showed that the temperature for activating the reaction was reduced, and the propane conversion was improved compared with using the plasma or the catalyst only. Sekine et al. [5] reported that at low temperature condition, where no reactivity was observed using catalyst only, methane was converted by introducing discharge in the volume of catalyst. They also disclosed that ZrO2, which is not active on a catalytic reaction, improved the reactivity on methane reforming under the electric discharge because the reducibility of lattice oxygen on a catalyst support was improved. The electric discharge was also used to initiate ethanol-steam reforming at low temperature [6]. The ethanol under the electric discharge was initiated to be decomposed at low temperature where the catalyst was not working. The effect of the electric discharge on water–gas shift reaction was higher than that of ethanol decomposition. Although the effect of the electric discharge on catalytic reforming reactions was reported in the literature, characteristics of the reforming reaction under the electric discharge should be thoroughly investigated in terms of reaction and electric discharge conditions. In the present study, methanol-steam reforming was selected for a model reaction. Synergetic effect between the catalytic reaction and the electric discharge on the methanol-steam reforming was investigated at the various reaction and electric discharge conditions, such as the temperature, feed rate, discharge voltage, frequency, and voltage waveform."
1,Experiments,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cu/ZnO was used as the catalyst for methanol-steam reforming, considering its proven reactivity and selectivity [7–9]. A spherical γ-Al2O3-pellet (Alfar Aesar) with a diameter of 2 mm was used as the support. The Cu/ZnO was loaded in the γ-Al2O3-pellet using the wet impregnation method. A mixture containing a 0.7 M aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 and a 0.3 M aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 was prepared. The catalyst support, γ-Al2O3-pellet, was immersed in the mixture. The moisture was removed by drying the catalyst-loaded support in a convection oven at 70 °C for 12 h followed by calcination in a furnace at 350 °C for 3 h. After the coating, the catalyst surface was activated by reduction in a hot hydrogen flow. The Cu/ZnO loading was 5.0 wt.% of the total weight of the catalyst support. The catalysts were coated uniformly on the surface of the spherical pellet and the particle size of the catalyst was approximately 20 nm [1]."
3,Reactor design,"2.2 Reactor design A quartz tube was used as the reactor, in which the catalyst pellet was packed. Two electrodes were used; one was inserted in the middle of reactor and the other was wrapped around the outer wall of the reactor. A flange, which is not electrically conducting, was installed at the lower part of reactor to fix the catalyst pellet. The flange was also used to fix the electrode precisely at the middle of the reactor because the electric discharge can be distorted if the gap between the two electrodes is not uniform. The gap between the two electrodes was 4.925 mm, between which 10 g catalyst pellets were packed. During the reaction, the reaction temperature was monitored with a K-type thermocouple, which was placed 1 cm away from the catalyst to avoid an electric discharge to the thermocouple. The electric discharge was generated only between the two electrodes due to the larger space between the catalyst and thermocouple than between the two electrodes."
4,Experimental apparatus,"2.3 Experimental apparatus Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus for methanol-steam reforming using an electric discharge. The reaction temperature was controlled using a programmable electric furnace. The methanol and water mixture was fed through a syringe pump (KDS200). The methanol to water feed ratio was fixed to 1.0 by mixing them before the reaction. High-purity nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas of the reactants vaporized before being supplied to the reactor. A high-voltage amplifier (Trek 20/20C) was used to generate a high-voltage electric discharge on the catalyst. The voltage, frequency and waveform were controlled using a function generator (Agilent 33220A). The discharge voltage, frequency and waveform were monitored using an oscilloscope (WaveSurfer 424, LeCroy). The reformate was condensed prior to gas analysis. The liquid products, such as unreacted methanol and water, were separated through a liquid trap. The uncondensed gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (YL6100, YONGLIN) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionized detector (FID). The gas species measured included H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO, CO2 and C2–C3 hydrocarbons. Methanol-steam reforming under an electric discharge was performed at a range of temperatures, feed rates, discharge voltages, and frequencies. The reaction temperatures ranged from 180 to 250 °C, and the feed rates varied from 0.5 to 2.0 ml/h. Steam-to-carbon ratio was fixed at 1.0. The discharge voltages varied from 0 to 4.0 kV, where 0 kV means it using catalyst only. The discharge frequency varied from 10 Hz to 50 kHz. The various voltage waveforms were used including sine, pulse and square. Table 1 lists the experimental conditions. All of experiments were repeated more than 5 times and the averaged values were presented."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of the electric discharge on methanol conversion,"3.1 Effect of the electric discharge on methanol conversion Fig. 2 shows the methanol conversion as a function of reaction temperature at the discharge voltage of 4.0 kV. The zero voltage means the reforming reaction using the catalyst only. The reaction temperature varied from 180 to 250 °C. The feed rate and discharge frequency were fixed to 0.5 ml/h and 50 kHz, respectively. The methanol conversion increased with increasing the reaction temperature. Normally, a catalytic reaction depends strongly on the temperature of the catalyst. The catalytic reaction under the electric discharge has also the same dependency to the catalytic reaction using the catalyst only. The methanol conversion at 180 °C was 5.7% when using the catalyst only. However, the methanol conversion under the electric discharge increased by 39.1%. The electric discharge provided the sufficient energy to break chemical bonds of methanol and steam. The C–O bond in methanol has bond dissociation energy of ∼380 kJ/mol [12]. The electric discharge produces electrons having a higher energy than the bond dissociation energy. Moreover, the electric discharge increased the absorption intensities of reactants on the active sites of the catalyst surface. The electrons generated by the electric discharge can excite vibrationally the reactants. Halonen et al. [13] reported that the vibrationally-excited species are absorbed with a lower activation energy than that of ground-state species. The methanol conversion increased under the electric discharge but the degree of increase was different as a range of temperature. At the temperature of 180 °C, the methanol conversion increased dramatically. The methanol conversion increased slightly with increasing temperature, whereas at the temperature of 250 °C, the methanol conversion decreased suddenly. At the low temperature, the interaction of the electric discharge with the catalytic reaction would be high because the methanol conversion was relatively low using the catalyst only. The catalyst was not activated well at the low temperature and had a low reactivity in the methanol reactions. However, under the electric discharge, the excited radicals accelerated to break the chemical bonds of methanol into methyl radicals; thus, the methanol conversion could increase at the low temperature. The effect of the electric discharge on the methanol conversion at 250 °C was relatively smaller than at 180 °C, because the catalytic reaction became dominant as the catalyst was working well at the high temperature [6]. At 250 °C, the sufficient thermal energy was provided to activate the reforming reaction. In this condition, the electric discharge functioned as an inhibitor of the reaction. This result implies that the electric discharge modified the reaction path way of the reaction. Fig. 3 shows the methanol conversion as a function of the discharge frequency. The discharge frequency varied from 10 Hz to 50 kHz. The discharge voltage and temperature were fixed to 2.0 kV and 220 °C, respectively. The methanol conversion increased slightly with increasing the discharge frequency. When the alternating current is used for the electric discharge, a dielectric heating occurs inherently. The dielectric heating is proportional to the permittivity of the dielectric barrier material and the discharge frequency. For dielectric heating, the generated power density per volume is given by: (1) p = f ɛ E 2 where p, f, ɛ and E are the power density, discharge frequency, dielectric constant and electric field strength, respectively. The dielectric barrier in the reactor configuration is the quartz material between two electrodes. The dielectric heating has a meaningful effect at the high frequency. The dielectric constant of the quartz is 3.78 at 3.0 GHz. The discharge frequency used for the reaction was less than 50 kHz. The power generated by the dielectric heating was calculated less than 0.2 W at the maximum frequency; thus, the dielectric heating for the reactor will be negligible. Actually, the reaction temperature maintained its value during the reaction. The catalytic reaction under the electric discharge was more improved at a high discharge frequency. That was not because of a thermal effect by the dielectric heating. We suppose that more electrons can be generated at a higher discharge frequency, accelerating an electron-impact dissociation of methanol. Fig. 4 shows the methanol conversion as a function of the feed rate with and without the electric discharge. The feed rate varied from 0.5 to 2.0 ml/h. The discharge voltage and frequency were fixed to 2.0 kV and 50 kHz, respectively. The reaction temperature was 250 °C. The methanol conversion decreased as the feed rate increased when using the catalyst only. In the same manner, under the electric discharge, the methanol conversion decreased as the feed rate increased. Nevertheless, the methanol conversion increased under the electric discharge at the entire range of the feed rate. The methanol-steam reforming under the electric discharge depends on the space velocity of reactants on the catalyst. That is because the reactive species with radicals formed by the electric discharge were reacted on the active sites of catalyst. Therefore, the residence time on the catalyst surface also affects the reaction rate when the electric discharge is used. The effect of the voltage waveforms on the methanol conversion such as sine, pulse and square waveform is present in Table 2 . The discharge voltage, frequency, feed rate and temperature were fixed to 2.0 kV, 50 kHz, 0.5 ml/h and 220 °C, respectively. The square waveform was more effective on the methanol conversion than other waveforms. The steep voltage rise consumed a higher discharge power compared to the smooth voltage rise such as the sine waveform. When the electric discharge with a square voltage waveform is applied, therefore, more electrons are generated and have more chance to collide with the catalyst surface. Accordingly, the methanol conversion more increased when the electric discharge with a square voltage waveform was applied."
7,Reaction mechanism of methanol-steam reforming under the electric discharge,"3.2 Reaction mechanism of methanol-steam reforming under the electric discharge The methanol-steam reforming consists of three overall reactions; methanol decomposition, water–gas shift reaction, and methanol-steam reaction as expressed in Eqs. (2)–(4) [10]. (2) CH 3 OH ↔ CO + 2 H 2 (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 (4) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 3 H 2 The methanol is decomposed to produce CO and H2 in Eq. (2). The CO with H2O generates CO2 and H2 through water–gas shift reaction as Eq. (3). The methanol with H2O directly can convert into CO2 and H2. Totally, the methanol-steam reforming produces 1 mol CO2 and 3 mol H2. The reactions in Eqs. (2)–(4) take place on the active sites of the catalysts; as aforementioned, the Cu is the active site and ZnO plays a role as the surface stabilizer of the active sites [8]. Peppley et al. [10] reported that the methanol is absorbed dissociatively on the Cu sites to form methoxy species as expressed in Eq. (5). (5) S 1 + S 1 a + CH 3 OH ( g ) ↔ CH 3 O ( 1 ) + H ( 1 a ) where S is the active sites that have two types of sites such as S1 and S1a. The S1 is the active site for the methanol decomposition and the S1a is the H2 absorbing site associated with the methanol-steam reaction. The methoxy species are dehydrogenated to form oxymethylene, which is subsequently converted to a formate as expressed in Eqs. (6) and (7). (6) CH 3 O ( 1 ) + S 1 a ↔ CH 2 O ( 1 ) + H ( 1 a ) (7) OH ( 1 ) + CO ( 1 ) ↔ HCOO ( 1 ) + S 1 The reactions in Eqs. (6) and (7) are the rate-determining step (RDS) in the methanol-steam reaction. The strong electric discharge on the surface of catalyst can accelerate the reaction rate of the RDS. If the RDS can be faster under the electric discharge, the hydrogen production also increases at the low temperature. Moreover, the diffusion and absorption of methanol on the catalyst can be improved by the electric discharge; thus, the methanol can be decomposed at the low temperature. At the experimental results, the methanol conversion was 5.7% but increased by 39.1% at 180 °C when the discharge voltage was 4.0 kV. The electric discharge can break the strong bonds of CH3OH into CH3 and OH radicals. In addition, the steam can be dissociated into H and OH radicals under the electric discharge [11]. It is expected that the electric discharge will make radicals such as CH3, OH and H at low temperature. It seems that the radicals such as CH3 and OH played an important role to enhance the interaction between the plasma and the catalytic reaction. The CH3 and OH radicals can react with other species and radicals through a homogeneous process during the catalytic reaction that is a heterogeneous process. In particular, the CH3 radical can be converted to other hydrocarbon species. Consequently, the reaction mechanism could be progressed through another reaction path way under the electric discharge as shown in Fig. 5 . From the above results, the methanol-steam reforming was more improved on the catalyst at low temperature using the electric discharge. The detailed mechanism of the methanol reforming under the electric discharge will be studied in order to understand the synergic effect of the plasma-catalyst hybrid process."
8,Conclusion,"In the present study, methanol-steam reforming under the electric discharge was investigated at various conditions, such as temperature, feeding rate, voltage, frequency and voltage waveform. The reaction mechanism of methanol-steam reforming under the electric discharge was discussed. The methanol conversion increased with increasing the discharge voltage and frequency. The square waveform was more effective than other waveforms such as sine and pulse. The electric discharge provided the sufficient energy to break chemical bonds of methanol and steam. Moreover, the strong electric field improved the diffusion and absorption of reactants on the active sites of the catalyst surface. The methanol-steam reforming was more improved under the electric discharge; consequently, the temperature for activating the process was reduced."
