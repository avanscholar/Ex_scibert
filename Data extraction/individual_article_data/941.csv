0,Introduction,"Finite resources of fossil fuels along with the environmental crisis resulting from the combustion (carbon dioxide, CO2, emissions) have stimulated a broad, intensive search for alternative energy sources that meet global energy needs without further impact on the environment. One of the focuses is to develop more active and selective processes for alcohol synthesis (i.e., methanol, ethanol) from small molecules such as hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and CO2 [1–3], where hydrogen is assumed to come from a variety of renewable technologies and the CO2 and CO from either burning fossil fuel or gasification of bio-mass ( Fig. 1). In addition, the synthesized alcohols should be burned efficiently [4–6]. With the use of renewable sources, the overall production and combustion of the synthetic alcohols generate no net CO2 emission. However, the currently used catalysts suffer low yield, low selectivity, low stability and/or high cost [7–10]. To accomplish the tasks requires enough knowledge of complex catalytic processes and entirely new catalysts: more active, more selective and more stable catalysts and preferably catalysts including earth-abundant elements. The ultimate goal is to have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and active sites to be able to design catalysts on desire. However, these processes are very complex in kinetics and involve the formations and cleavages of C–C, C–O, C–H and O–H bonds [7–9]. It is extremely difficult to obtain all of these necessary details from current experimental techniques. Over the past few decades, theory starts to be recognized as an essential tool in optimization of catalysts for energy applications [11]. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) starts to be recognized as an essential tool in describing catalysts. DFT attempts to solve Schrödinger equation, where the kinetic and potential energies are transformed into the Hamiltonian and act upon the wavefunction to generate the evolution of the wavefunction in time and space [12–14]. It is derived directly from theoretical principles with no experimental data, providing accurate and reliable theoretical results with reasonable computational costs. DFT permits more realistic models of the intrinsic reaction than can be afforded by other quantum mechanical methods and is widely employed in catalysis. Advances in DFT make it possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare with experiment in a meaningful way [6,15–20]. The theoretical studies also describe chemical reactions in detail and understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another [21–25]. Such understanding allows the theoretical optimization for better catalysts [26–29]. In the current report we will discuss the theoretical studies using DFT in the past few years on alcohol decomposition and methanol (CH3OH) synthesis from CO2 and H2. To model a surface, periodic boundary conditions are commonly applied in all three dimensions. The atoms in the lower portion of the supercell ﬁll the entire super-cell in the x and y directions with 3–5 layers along the surface direction to model the subsurface. Empty space has been left above the atoms in the top portion of the supercell. This is so-called slab model. In the case of cluster models, there is either no periodic boundary condition, or the atoms are surrounded by empty space. The DFT calculations reported in the following were mostly performed using generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. The electron–ion interaction was described using effective core potentials, all electrons or ultra-soft Vanderbilt pseudo-potentials. The wave functions were expanded in terms of a double-numerical or plane wave basis sets. As you will see the geometries predicted from the DFT calculations with different setups are very similar for the same system, while it can make differences in energetics. However, the energetic variation from one group to the next, which is very important for catalyst development, follows the same trend independence of the detailed setups of DFT calculations. In the following, the CH3OH decomposition to CO (CH3OH→CO+2H2) will be firstly addressed including the preferential adsorption configuration, adsorption energy, and transition states along different reaction pathways, together with kinetic modeling. We will then demonstrate the detailed knowledge of reactions of CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH on various surfaces (CO2+3H2→CH3OH+H2O). The studies on the decomposition and synthesis of ethanol will also be briefly reviewed. Finally, the future directions for theoretical studies on alcohol chemistry will be addressed. The review of theoretical studies on alcohol decomposition and synthesis will help gain better understandings of the complex kinetics and the roles that metal and the other components play. This is of great importance to rational design of better catalysts for alcohol efficient use and renewal synthesis."
1,Methanol decomposition,"There have been considerable interests in the chemical behavior of CH3OH on surfaces in the past two decades, due to its importance in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) [4]. Except for DMFC, the ideal fuel for PEM fuel cells is pure hydrogen, with less than 50ppm carbon monoxide, as dictated by the poisoning limit of the Pt fuel cell catalyst. As a result, methanol steam reforming (MSR, CH3OH+H2O→CO2+3H2) has been suggested as an efficient way to produce H2 [5]. In addition, CH3OH is one of the important synthetic chemicals. It is a simple aliphatic alcohol with one methyl unit and has a pK a value close to that of water; it also has a reactive hydroxyl (OH) group. Finally, CH3OH is the simplest alcohol containing three different kinds of heteroatom bonds (C–H, C–O, and O–H), and has been selected as one of the prototypes in surface science for exploring the selective activation of chemical bonds on surfaces. Studies on the adsorption and decomposition of CH3OH are also important for its potential applications in molecule-based devices, biosensors, nanolithography and organic dielectrics [30,31]. There have been subject of numerous studies investigated over various surfaces of metal, alloy, and metal compound (metal oxide, carbide, sulfide, phosphide and chloride). The best catalyst should be active enough to break the bonds of CH3OH, but still being able to allow further reactions of intermediates and removals of products."
2,Metal surfaces,"2.1 Metal surfaces CH3OH decomposition to CO is a strongly endothermic reaction (ΔH 0=0.94eV). Different reaction mechanisms have been proposed based on the calculations. Fig. 2 includes four possible reaction pathways for CH3OH decomposition to formaldehyde (H2CO) or CO and H2, depending on intermediates for O–H or C–H bond scission. The behavior of CH3OH on metal surfaces has been well studied for various metal surfaces using DFT. Some of these calculations focused only on the molecular adsorption, e.g. Fe(100) [32], Fe(110) [33], Al(111) [32], Ru(001) [34], and Cu(111) [35]; others elucidated the possible reaction pathways and intermediates involved in the decomposition process (see Table 1). Among all the metal surfaces, Pt and Cu surfaces are studied the most extensively. 2.1.1 Group 11 metals Among Group 11 metals, Cu is the most studied systems for the reactions related to CH3OH in both experiment and theory, due to the fact that Cu-based catalysts have attracted considerable attentions as the feedstock in DMFC and the MSR [4,36,37]. The decomposition pathways of CH3OH on Cu, and in particular the elementary steps, play an important role in the MSR process. This process, which occurs over Cu-based catalysts, has the potential to provide an economical, convenient source of H2 for the next generation fuel cells [38]. Therefore, understanding the reaction mechanism on Cu surfaces is vital to the further development of Cu-based catalysts for the MSR. 2.1.1.1 Cu surfaces Experimental studies have made efforts to investigate the CH3OH decomposition on low-index copper surfaces, Cu(111), Cu(110) and Cu(100), using surface science techniques, such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc., showing a relatively low activity for CH3OH [39–42]. At low surface temperatures, CH3OH is weakly adsorbed as the intact molecule [40,42]. With increasing of temperatures, CH3OH decomposition is observed, first as methoxy (H3CO) and then by H2CO, which eventually leads to H2CO desorption or the associative desorption of H and H3CO in the form of CH3OH, depending on the concentration of H available on the surfaces [41,43,44]. Yet, it is not clear which reaction pathway is preferred. What are the rate-limiting steps that hinder the decomposition? Is the reaction structure sensitive to the Cu surface? To answer these fundamental questions, DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the CH3OH decomposition on single crystal Cu surfaces. Firstly, all the calculations indicated weak interactions between CH3OH and the (111), (110) and (100) surfaces of Cu (≤−0.5eV, Table 1). This is in accordance with the TPD measurements, which show the low-temperature desorption of CH3OH (∼270K) [39–42]. On Cu(111), CH3OH is weakly adsorbed on the top site with its C–O axis tilted towards the surface and the O–H bond roughly parallel to the surface ( Fig. 3). In contrast, CH3OH is more strongly bound to Cu(110) [38,45–47]. Secondly, C–O bond cleavage is not favored on Cu surfaces [46,48,49]. DFT calculations were also performed to determine the possible reaction pathways. Mavrikakis et al. showed the Path , CH3OH→H3CO→H2CO→HCO→CO, is energetically preferred on Cu(111). The CH3OH decomposition is initiated by the O–H bond scission [38]. The resulting H3CO radical is the most abundant species found from the first step of CH3OH decomposition, which explains well the experimental observations [40]. The second step, the abstraction of hydrogen from the H3CO intermediate, is found to have large thermochemical (∼1.0eV) and kinetic (∼1.4eV) barriers and is identified as the rate-limiting step. In addition, CH3OH, H2CO and CO are weakly bound to the surface and likely desorbed before undergoing any reaction under UHV conditions as observed experimentally [40]. In contrast, H3CO, formyl (HCO), and H are much more strongly bound. The slow dehydrogenation of H3CO and the possible H2CO desorption were also found by Rősch et al. using DFT [48,49]. On Cu(110) and Cu(100), Sakong and Groβ and Mei et al. showed that similar to Cu(111), Path (Fig. 2) is the most favorable route for the complete decomposition of CH3OH toward CO [45,46]. Along the decomposition route, the formed H2CO most likely desorbs from the surface before further dehydrogenation to CO, which agrees with the experimental observations [41]. The rate-limiting step along this route is again the dehydrogenation of H3CO to H2CO [45,46]. Overall, CH3OH decomposition does not seem to be sensitive to the structure of Cu. Path (Fig. 2) is preferred on all three low-index surfaces and the dehydrogenation of H3CO is the rate-limiting step, where the corresponding barriers vary slightly with the orientation going from closely-packed (111) to the more open (100) surface (Table 1). In agreement with the experiments, the theoretical calculations show that Cu surfaces are not active towards CH3OH decomposition. Besides H2, the possible products are H2CO and CO. However, a different behavior was observed for a small Cu4 cluster using DFT, where the CH3OH decomposition process preferred Path , CH3OH→H2COH→HCOH→HCO→CO and the C–H bond scission was favored rather than the O–H bond in the initial stage [50]. 2.1.1.2 Ag surfaces Ag has been used commercially in CH3OH oxidation to produce H2CO. The adsorption and oxidation of CH3OH on Ag(111)and Ag(110) were studied by TPD, Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), XPS and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) [51–54]. It was found that CH3OH adsorbs reversibly at 110K from Ag(111). H3CO is generated by exposing a pre-oxidized Ag(111) surface to CH3OH at 180–290K, above which it decomposes to yield H2CO as the major product [53]. Using periodic slab models and cluster models, DFT calculations showed that adsorption of CH3OH on the clean silver surface is very weak (see Table 1) and easy to desorb from the surface [55–57]. In addition, Path is identified for the CH3OH conversion to H3CO and H2CO on Ag(111) [55,58]. However, the decomposition does not produce CO; instead H2CO is the likely product, in accordance with experiment [53]. The possible rate-limiting step in this path is the H3CO dehydrogenation. Similar results were also reported by a DFT study on Ag(110) using a cluster model [56,57]. Consistent with the experiment, the calculations showed that the CH3OH decomposition on Ag surfaces is highly activated. The reaction can be significantly promoted by the nature of the oxygen (O) species, which will be addressed later [55–57]. 2.1.1.3 Au surfaces CH3OH is found weakly bound to Au(111) by DFT calculations, with an adsorption energy of −0.15eV [59]. This small adsorption energy means that molecular adsorption of CH3OH is fully reversible on a clean Au(111) surface, consistent with experimental observations using TPD, vibrational high-resolution electron energy loss (HREEL) spectroscopy and molecular beam reactive scattering (MBRS) [60,61]. CH3OH decomposition on Au(111) follows path , producing H3CO and sequentially H2CO, rather than CO, which readily desorbs from the surface due to the weak Au–H2CO interaction ( Fig. 4) [59,62]. These predictions are consistent with the experimental results, where H2CO and H2 have been observed to be the major product on Au(111) [60,61]. Different rate-limiting steps have been proposed. One is H3CO formation from CH3OH (barrier: 1.58eV, Table 1); [59] the other is H2CO formation from H3CO (barrier: 1.55eV, Table 1) [62]. Nevertheless, both calculations demonstrated that the decomposition of CH3OH is energetically difficult on clean Au(111). Pre-exposure to O is necessary to activate the O–H bond in CH3OH decomposition, as shown below [59–61]. 2.1.2 Group 10 metals 2.1.2.1 Pt surfaces Among the Group 10 metals, Pt has been studied most intensively for CH3OH decomposition. The decomposition of CH3OH on Pt is the main reaction that occurs on the anodes of DMFC, in which CH3OH is completely oxidized to CO2 (CH3OH+H2O→CO2+6H++6e−). In general, the catalysts that are active to dehydrogenate CH3OH and oxidize CO to CO2, as opposed to CO accumulation at the electrodes, are of high interest. Because of CO poisoning, the catalysts that catalyze the dehydrogenation without complete oxidation may be unsuitable for practical use. Thus, to aid the design of more CO tolerant anode catalysts, a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry on Pt is required. CH3OH adsorption, desorption, and decomposition on Pt(111) were observed by Sexton using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and TPD [63]. On the clean Pt(111) surface, CH3OH is dehydrogenated above 140K to form adsorbed CO and H. Later experiments using HREELS indicated that at low temperatures the decomposition appears to occur primarily at defect sites [64]. A pristine Pt(111) surface is unreactive for CH3OH decomposition at ≤180K. To understand the reaction mechanism on Pt(111), extensive DFT calculations have been carried out. Several reaction pathways have been proposed (Table 1). By combining DFT and micro-kinetic modeling, Mavrikakis et al. proposed that Path is the optimal pathway (Fig. 2), where the calculated rate is several orders of magnitude higher than that for Path and Path [65–67]. The decomposition is initiated by C–H cleavage to produce hydroxymethyl (H2COH) and eventually CO via the HCOH and HCO intermediates. Along Path , the first C–H bond cleavage in CH3OH is identified as the rate-limiting step. In addition, the kinetic study showed that CO is the main species covering the surface, leading to possible CO poisoning at lower temperatures. Path was also proposed by Ishikawa et al. by performing a DFT calculation on a Pt10 cluster [68]. However, the DFT calculations by Desai et al. predicted that Path is favored, where H2COH prefers O–H cleavage to form H2CO, HCO and therefore CO [69]. More recently, the DFT calculations by Niu et al., identified Path as the most favorable mechanism, where the O–H bond cleavage is preferred and the formation of H3CO from CH3OH has the highest activation energy [70]. The difference between the calculations by Wang et al. and by Mavrikakis and Neurock has been attributed to the initial configuration of CH3OH. By adapting a stable configuration, O–H bond scission is favored for the first dehydrogenation of CH3OH on Pt(111) [70]. Further mechanistic studies combining DFT and kinetic modeling under more realistic conditions would help to clarify the decomposition mechanism CH3OH on Pt(111). Nevertheless, all the theoretical calculations show (Table 1) that CH3OH binds weakly on Pt(111). The dehydrogenation of CH3OH is endothermic while the pathway to H2COH has an intrinsic barrier larger than the heat of desorption. CH3OH preferred to desorb from Pt(111). Consequently, clean Pt(111) is unreactive for CH3OH decomposition. The Pt(110) surface is a more open surface than Pt(111). DFT calculations by Niu et al. predicted [70] that CH3OH decomposition follows Path . CO is produced via H3CO, H2CO and HCO, and the first dehydrogenation step to H3CO is predicted as rate-limiting step (Table 1). Compared to Pt(111), the bindings of CH3OH and the reaction intermediates on Pt(110) are stronger and the corresponding barriers for the decomposition reaction are lower [70]. The C–O bond scission on Pt(110) is unlikely. This conclusion is different from that found early in the experiment reported by Wang and Masel [71] in which C–O bond cleavage was observed on Pt(110) [71]. On Pt(100) both Path and Path have been proposed by DFT calculations for CH3OH decomposition [72]. C–H bond scission to form H2COH has been found to be the kinetically favored reaction step; whereas C–O and O–H bond cleavages are not likely. The dehydrogenation of H2COH produces H2CO and HCOH, which ultimately leads to the formation of HCO and finally CO. For both pathways, the dehydrogenation of H2COH is identified to be the most activated step. One can see from the theoretical calculations the similar energetics for CH3OH decomposition on the three defect-free Pt(111), (110), and (100) surfaces, though the reaction paths vary among Paths , and . Firstly, the CH3OH is weakly bound on all three Pt surfaces (<−0.5eV). Compared to the decomposition reaction (rate-limiting barrier >0.6eV), CH3OH is more likely to desorb from the ideal Pt surfaces under the UHV conditions. This prediction is consistent with surface science studies, which observe decomposition only at higher temperatures [64,72–74]. Secondly, as shown in Table 1, the barriers for the rate-limiting step among the three surfaces vary within 0.3eV. Indeed, this variation is very small, considering the variation in parameters and transition state search methods used in the different calculations. Thirdly, all the calculations show that the likely products of CH3OH decomposition on all the Pt surfaces are CO and H2 and C–O bond cleavage is not favored, which agrees well with the experimental observations using EELS and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) [64,72–74]. Finally, the thermodynamics and kinetics of all elementary steps for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions on Pt(111) are found linearly correlated ( Fig. 5), indicating a strong late transition for these reactions [65]. Such a correlation was not evident for CH3OH decompositions of Pt(110) and Pt(100) [70,72]. 2.1.2.2 Pd surfaces Pd is an effective catalyst for CH3OH decomposition [75], oxidation [76] and steam reforming [36]. To gain better understanding of the catalytic performance of Pd, CH3OH adsorption and decomposition on single crystal Pd surfaces have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental findings suggest that the supported Pd nanoparticles exhibit a high fraction of (111) and smaller extent (100) facets [77,78]. Thus, the two facets have received considerable attention. On Pd(111), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), XPS and TPD measurements have shown that CH3OH decomposition results in CO and H2, either via initial C–H (Paths , , ) or O–H (Path ) bond scission [75,79,80]. No C–O scission is observed [75]. As shown in Table 1, both Path [49,81,82] and Path [80,83] have been identified as the optimal pathway by DFT calculations. Along Path , the rate-limiting step is found to be the O–H bond breaking of CH3OH to form H3CO, where the other pathways are not well considered. Along Path , the most difficult step is the C–H bond breaking step to form H2COH. By mapping the overall reaction network, the calculations predicted that thermodynamically the dehydrogenation via Path is more favorable than that via Path [80,83]. Similar results have been found for small Pd clusters [84]. Experiments on Pd(100) found that dissociative H3CO species are mostly hydrogenated to CH3OH in the presence of adsorbed H [85]. The observed CO is postulated to come from the isomers of H3CO. To clarify the reaction mechanism on Pd(100), DFT calculations were carried out, showing that Path is preferred and the CO is produced from the dehydrogenation of H2COH [86]. Compared to Pd(111), Pd(100) binds most of the adsorbates more strongly, and therefore lower barriers are obtained. On both Pd(111) and (100) surfaces, DFT calculations show that H3CO is preferentially hydrogenated back to CH3OH in accordance with the experiments [79,80,85], while the actual CH3OH decomposition proceeds via the H2COH intermediate. Possible products include H2CO, CO and H2. Decomposition of CH3OH to form CO is favored at terrace sites. Scission of the C–O is not as facile as dehydrogenation, yet carbon (C) or carbonaceous species (CH x ) produced by the decomposition of H3CO and H2COH likely blocks the particle edges and steps [84,87]. 2.1.2.3 Ni surfaces Experimentally, CH3OH is observed to decompose to H2 and CO on Ni surfaces [88–91]. The observation of a deuterium kinetic isotope effect in the initial sticking coefficient showed that the O–H bond is the first bond to break in the chemisorbed CH3OH molecule. However, whether H3CO is the active intermediate to produce CO is not clear [92]. In addition, the possibility of C–O bond scission depending on the CH3OH pressure is still under debate. Previous studies have concluded that breaking the C–O bond is not a viable elementary process on the Ni(111), Ni(110) and Ni(100) surfaces [90,91,93]; however it was observed as a possible mechanism on polycrystalline Ni foil, which was attributed either to more open surfaces, or to the disordered areas and boundaries between close packed parts of the surface [94]. DFT calculations have been helpful in probing CH3OH decomposition pathways and the surface intermediates that may be formed on Ni surfaces [95,96]. One of the important issues is whether the first step of CH3OH decomposition occurs via an O–H, C–O or C–H bond scission. As shown in Table 1, the calculations by Wang et al. predicted that on Ni(111) the major reaction path involves O–H bond breaking in CH3OH (Path ) [95]. The further decomposition of the resulting H3CO species produces CO and H via stepwise hydrogen abstractions. The abstraction of hydrogen from H3CO itself is the rate-limiting step, which explains the experimental observation of H3CO species at relatively low temperature [88]. On Ni(100), Zhou et al. showed that CH3OH decomposition via O–H bond scission (Path ) and C–H bond scission (Path ) should run in parallel [96]. The activation barriers to form H2COH, H3CO and H2CO are much lower on Ni(100) than those on Ni(111) ( Fig. 6). By contrast, the barrier for C–O bond scission is higher, due to the larger repulsive force between methyl (CH3) and OH on Ni(100). Nevertheless, the C–O bond scission is not favored on both (111) and (100) surfaces. The rate-limiting step along Path is the same as that of Ni(111), C–H scission in H3CO. Along Path , the C–H bond breaking of CH3OH to form H2COH is identified as the most activated step. In addition, the dehydrogenation of HCO to CO along both paths also corresponds to a high barrier (Table 1). The major product, CO, is shown to be so strongly bound on both Ni surfaces (∼2.3eV) that it could lead to the surface poisoning [96]. According to mechanistic studies using DFT, one can see that CH3OH decomposition on Ni surfaces is structure-sensitive, where the differences in preferential reaction pathways and energetics are observed both on (111) and (100) surfaces. On the other hand, it is not structure-sensitive, where the production of CO is predicted and the C–O bond scission is not favored. 2.1.3 Groups 8–9 metals 2.1.3.1 Fe surfaces The adsorption of organic compounds onto Fe surfaces is of considerable interest not only for the development of relevant catalytic reactions but also for their industrial applications; e.g. organic coating, adhesive bonding, and corrosion inhibition of steel. On Fe(110), XPS results showed that CH3OH easily dissociates into H3CO and H even at 100K and desorbed at 140K. Using DFT and two-layer periodic slab models, Yanagisawa et al. examined both the molecular and dissociative adsorption of CH3OH on Fe(110) [33]. Weakly adsorbed CH3OH was observed. In contrast, strong binding of H3CO on the Fe slabs was obtained (−2.16eV), which is accompanied by large electron transfers from Fe to H3CO. The large exothermicity of dissociative adsorption, CH3OH→H3CO+H, is likely to drive the decomposition along Path at low temperature, as observed experimentally [97]. In addition, the experiments also showed that on Fe(110), H3CO dehydrogenates at ∼400K and produces gaseous H2 and CO products. C–O bond scission competes with CO evolution at 400K, accounting for ∼25% of the CO yield [97]. To date, no theoretical calculation has been reported for H3CO decomposition on Fe(110). On Fe(100), Lu et al. observed the decomposition of CH3OH through the H3CO intermediate using HREELS and TPRS [98]. The H and CO intermediates were found to bind strongly to the surface near 440K and CO dissociated at higher temperatures. No adsorbed H2CO species were observed. Again, the DFT study on Fe(100) using a slab model has been limited to CH3OH adsorption only, where an on-top adsorption site was found to be the most stable. In contrast to the case of Fe(110), the CH3OH–Fe interaction is relatively strong, with the estimated adsorption energy of −0.91eV. CH3OH binding involved electron transfer from Fe to the molecule (∼0.1e). 2.1.3.2 Ru surfaces At low temperatures (85–90K) and for submonolayer coverages, CH3OH is adsorbed on Ru(001) only dissociatively as H3CO [99–101]. Adsorbed H3CO is found to either recombine with H and desorb as CH3OH between 220 and 250K [102], or decompose to CO and H at higher temperatures [103]. In addition, C–O bond breaking is ruled out [101]. Ishikawa et al. studied the decomposition of CH3OH on Ru(001) by performing DFT calculations on a 10-atom Ru cluster [68]. Path is predicted by the calculation to be dominant for CH3OH dehydrogenation on Ru. The calculated decomposition steps are exothermic and correspond to relatively low activation energies with the highest barrier being 0.6eV (see Table 1). Therefore a facile decomposition has been observed experimentally, though the removal of CO is difficult due to the strong Ru–CO interaction [99,100,103]. In addition, the experiments showed that methanol decomposition is strongly dependent on coverage; however this observation has not been examined by theoretical calculations. 2.1.3.3 Rh surfaces CH3OH decomposition on Rh(111) was studied experimentally at low temperatures under UHV conditions [104,105]. CH3OH is found to readily adsorb on the Rh(111) surface at 100K and decompose to CH3O at 140K. Solymosi et al. suggested that both H3CO hydrogenation to CH3OH at 210–250K and dehydrogenation to adsorbed CO and H at ∼200K are possible [105]. Houtman and Barteau believed that the products are exclusively CO and H2 [104]. In addition to H3CO, no other intermediates are observed. The DFT calculations in combination with micro-kinetic modeling were carried out by Jiang et al., showing the CH3OH adsorption energy of −0.64eV [106]. This value is a little lower than the experimental observation (−0.5eV) [105]. In addition, it was also revealed that Path and Path run in parallel under all the reaction conditions, whereas at high temperatures and high pressures, Path and Path are also significant. The micro-kinetic modeling showed that the rate-limiting step along Path and Path is the dehydrogenation of CH3OH, and the conversions of H2CO to HCO are facile. The calculations predicted that the most abundant surface species is CO ( Fig. 7), which strongly interacts with Rh (adsorption energy, ∼−1.8eV) and is likely to result in poisoning Rh sites. The coverages for other intermediates are found rather low. The latter agrees with experiments, where only the H3CO intermediate and the product CO are observed [104,105]. 2.1.4 Groups 13–14 semiconductors and metals 2.1.4.1 Al surfaces In order to clarify the adsorption properties of lubricant on metal surfaces, the interaction of molecules on A1 surfaces have been studied. A photoemission investigation showed that CH3OH dissociates on Al(111) at 90K [107]. CH3OH is fully decomposed on Al(111) upon heating to 200K. The dissociation was proposed to involve H3CO formation via O–H bond cleavage as indicated by HREEL spectra. At∼445K, the only desorption species is methane (CH4), due to the C–O bond cleavage of H3CO [108]. A DFT study of CH3OH on Al(111) was reported only for the geometry of molecular adsorption [32]. The calculations showed that molecular adsorption of CH3OH on Al(111) is weak (adsorption energy, ∼−0.3eV), and the on-top adsorption via the O atom of CH3OH is more energetically favorable. However, a detailed reaction mechanism on Al surfaces has not been reported. 2.1.4.2 Si surfaces The reactions of alcohols on semiconductor surfaces have been studied mainly on Si surfaces. It is of great importance in many applications, such as molecular electronics, nano-catalysis, non-linear optics or even biosensors. XPS, STM and TPD experiments observed the dissociation of CH3OH on both Si(100)−2×1 and Si(111)−7×7, with O–H bond to form H3CO and H. These fragments bind to Si dimer atoms, and further decomposition via C–O bond breaking has been a topic of debate [31,109,110]. Carbone and Larsson, using DFT and a slab model, investigated dissociative adsorption of CH3OH on a Si(100)−2×1 surface [111]. CH3OH dissociation into H3CO is found to be energetically favorable, with binding at the top site being the most energetically favored. This is in accordance with experiment, where the presence of H3CO was detected on Si at temperatures between 100K and 500K [112]. A DFT-GGA study by Sonnet et al. using a periodic slab was also performed to investigate the initial stages of the CH3OH adsorption on Si(111)−7×7 [113]. The results showed that the pair dissociation is largely favored, in agreement with the experimental observations. However, in clear contradiction with the experimental data [109,110], the calculations predicted the preferential C–O bond scission of CH3OH rather than O–H bond scission. The reason for the difference is still not clear. 2.1.4.3 Ge surfaces According to a HREELS study, CH3OH dissociates into methyl radicals and hydroxyl species on Ge(100) at room temperature, resulting in the surface oxidation [114]. In contrast, CH3OH dissociation to form Ge–OCH3 and Ge–H species at low coverage was observed by STM ( Fig. 8) [115]. DFT calculations by Kim et al. showed that at low coverage, the molecularly bonded structure is not thermodynamically favorable (adsorption energy, ∼−0.6eV) and might act as a precursor for the dissociation. The formation of H3CO via O–H bond cleavage (barrier: ∼0.1eV) is found energetically favorable over C–O bond breaking (barrier: ∼1.7eV) [116]. The accompanying H atom is bound to a Ge atom nearby, passivating the dangling bond. The calculations strongly support the STM results with a dominant H–Ge–Ge–OCH3 adsorption configuration at room temperature (Fig. 8) [115]. Further decomposition has not been studied theoretically. As discussed above, extensive theoretical calculations have been carried out to investigate CH3OH decomposition on metal surfaces. The information about reaction pathways, intermediates and transition states, which are obtained from the calculations, not only allows the better understanding of the experimental observations, but also provides the basis for further catalyst development. As shown in Fig. 9a, the adsorption energy of CH3OH generally decreases in the sequence: Group 8>Group 9>Group 10>Group 11. Within the same group, the adsorption energy follows the trend of 3d-metals>4d-metals>5d-metals for the surfaces with the same orientation. Similar trends are observed for other intermediates such as H3CO, which can be readily explained by the calculated electronic structures [117]. Note that there are some scattering points due to differences in the setups of DFT calculations. Yet, the variation from one group to the next generally follows the same trend independence of the calculation details. For Groups 10 and 11 metals, in particular Ag and Au, molecular adsorption energies are relatively small in most cases. For these metals, CH3OH prefers to desorb before undergoing any reaction under UHV conditions. Similar variations are observed for reaction energies (Fig. 9b). In terms of thermodynamics, the stronger methanol binds to the surface, the more the rate-limiting step becomes energetically favorable, and therefore a higher activity for methanol decomposition is expected. For the Group 11 metals, the CH3OH decomposition to CO is hindered due to the weak interaction with the metal surfaces; instead, methanol desorbs or undergoes partial decomposition to H2CO. Moving to Groups 9 and 10 metals, the selective decomposition to CO is favored due to the stronger adsorbate–surface interaction, though C–O scission is still difficult. When going to Group 8 metals with the increasing binding activity, C–O bond cleavage is also feasible. As a result, poisoning by CO or C may occur, which blocks the active metal sites and deactivates the catalysts. Overall, the variation in decomposition activity from one system to the next follows Sabatier's principle [118]. Pure metals are mono-functional catalysts, which in principle have only one kind of active species on the surface to catalyze the reaction. For CH3OH decomposition (see Fig. 10), some pure metal catalysts, e.g. Au and Ag, bind the molecule too weakly and the reaction is hindered. Other metals, e.g. Fe and Ru, bind the adsorbates more strongly and the decomposition reactions occur more readily; however, the product, C or CO, may interact with the surface too strongly to remove, which results in poisoning the catalysts. Therefore, following the Sabatier's principle [118], a volcano-like correlation between the binding strength of the catalysts to a key reaction intermediate and the catalytic activity is always expected. The best catalyst is located on the top of the curve and has a moderate binding, high enough to dissociate reactants and weak enough to allow the reactions of intermediates and the removals of products. In this case, Pt has been identified as the best metal systems for CH3OH decomposition [117]. If only using monofunctional catalysts the further catalyst development will be limited once the top of volcano is reached. In contrast, using multifunctional catalysts that have two or more active sites on the surface is able to open new possibilities for catalyst improvements. In the following, the effects of introducing additional active components to metals, e.g. alloys, metal compounds with light elements (O, S, C, Cl) or supported metals, to CH3OH decomposition on metals will be reported."
3,Metal alloy surfaces,"2.2 Metal alloy surfaces Metal alloys are well known to have unique catalytic properties in electrocatalysis, particularly for low-temperature fuel cells [119]. The enhanced activity of Pt alloys for direct CH3OH electrooxidation has been extensively studied in experiment [120,121]. In addition, metal alloys have also been proposed to facilitate the MSR reactions [122]. Despite the extensive experimental efforts, the origin of the promoting effect of alloying remains elusive due to limitations in experimental characterization. The primary question to be addressed is: whether is the enhancement associated with the ligand effect [123] that is introduced via binding, charge transfer and strain, or the ensemble effect [123] that describes the synergistic behavior of different constituents, or both? To answer the question, theoretical calculations have been carried out to study CH3OH decomposition on metal alloy surfaces. 2.2.1 Pt alloys: PtM (M=Au, Ru, Sn) surfaces Carbon-supported PtM nanoparticle catalysts have been explored for their excellent properties for DMFC [124,125]. The detailed reaction pathways on PtAu(111) were investigated by Yuan et al. using DFT-GGA and a slab model [126]. To model PtAu(111), 50% of the surface Au atoms were replaced by Pt, in the arrangement that avoided Pt 3-fold hollow sites ( Fig. 11). The results showed that all adsorbates prefers the active Pt sites on PtAu(111) and Pt becomes more active than Pt(111) as a result of ligand effect. Both Path and Path are identified for CH3OH decomposition to CO and H atoms. Similar to Pt(111), the rate-limiting step along Path is O–H bond scission to form H3CO (barrier, 0.98eV). Along Path , C–H bond scission of intermediate HCOH to make COH is the most difficult step (barrier, 0.91eV). Compared to Pt(111), removal of Pt 3-fold hollow sites on PtAu(111) (ensemble effect) makes most dehydrogenation steps rather difficult. However, by blocking the dehydrogenation of the H2CO intermediate, this surface allows direct oxidation of H2CO and prevents CO poisoning in fuel cells. For PtRu and PtSn, DFT calculation using a cluster model [68] showed that Ru promotes CH3OH decomposition on Pt via the optimal Path due to the direct participation of Ru in the reaction (ensemble effect), while Sn does not seem to help in agreement with the TPD measurement [127]. Both Ru and Sn introduces the electronic modification on Pt (ligand effect), resulting in a weakened Pt–CO interaction to release the CO poisoning. This was also observed experimentally [128], though under electrochemical conditions, both ligand and ensemble effects were considered to contribute to the removal of CO. 2.2.2 PdZn alloys The high performance of Pd/ZnO catalysts in MSR has been attributed to the formation of a PdZn (1:1) alloy [129]. Unlike Pd metal alone, CH3OH decomposition on the PdZn alloy was shown to result in the formation of methyl formate (HCOOCH3) with only a small amount of CO [130]. To understand the reaction mechanisms, Rősch et al. employed DFT slab model calculations to study the decomposition of H3CO on PdZn(111), a key intermediate in CH3OH decomposition and steam reforming reactions [49,82]. The results showed that both Pd and Zn participate in the reaction directly. The ensemble effect is found to be considerably more overwhelming than the ligand effect [49]. By alloying with Zn, the adsorption geometries and energetics for HxCO are different from the case of Pd(111). H3CO prefers the Zn-dominated hollow site with binding via the O atom. H2CO adsorbs at Zn–Pd bridge via Zn-O and Pd–C bonds, while HCO and CO favor the Pd sites via the C binding. The DFT calculations showed that the reaction intermediates and transitions are less stable on PdZn(111) than on Pd(111) and therefore the dehydrogenation of H3CO is less favorable on going form PdZn(111) to Pd(111) [49]. The formation of CO on PdZn by HCO dehydrogenation is found likely to occur at defect sites of PdZn. 2.2.3 NiAl alloys It was observed experimentally that CH3OH adsorbs molecularly on a NiAl alloy surface at low temperature. By increasing the temperature, normally to∼200K, it decomposes to H3CO by O–H bond scission [131,132], similar to that observed on A1 [107] and Ni [92] surfaces. At higher temperatures H2 and CO are formed [132]. The NiAl(110) surface displays the higher ability to break the C–O bond of H3CO at the lower temperature than on pure Al (about 300–400K), which is accompanied with the formations of CH4, CH3 and C2H4 [133]. Using DFT, Borck et al. investigated the adsorption of CH3OH and H3CO on NiAl(110) and Ni3Al(111) [134]. Again, both Al and Ni were found to play direct roles in the adsorbate bindings. CH3OH is bound to Al on-top sites through the O atom on both surfaces, with an adsorption energy of −0.41eV on NiAl(110) ( Fig. 12) and −0.29eV on Ni3Al(111), similar to those on pure Ni and Al surfaces (Section 2.1). The Ni sites help to stabilize H atoms. Binding of H3CO also shows a preference for Al-dominated sites with much stronger adsorption energy than CH3OH, −2.88eV at the Al–Al bridge site on NiAl(110) (Fig. 12) and −2.82eV at the Ni–Al hybrid hollow site on Ni3Al(111). These binding energies are slightly higher than that reported for Ni(111) [117]. Therefore, the decomposition of CH3OH to H3CO is thermodynamically favorable on both NiAl(110) and Ni3Al(111) with ensemble effects playing an important role, although further decomposition of H3CO remains elusive. Both experiments and theoretical calculations show that alloy formation may have significant effects on the CH3OH decomposition on metal surfaces. By introducing the secondary metal species, the alloys may behave differently from the pure metal system in terms of the energetics and/or the reaction pathways, where ligand and ensemble effects play an essential role. Changing the loading and distribution of secondary metal species may open the opportunity to further improve the activity of metal catalysts."
4,O-preadsorbed metal surfaces,"2.3 O-preadsorbed metal surfaces Modification of metal surfaces by preadsorbing O atom (O–M) can strongly affect their chemical activity of these surfaces. O is a strong adsorbate on most metal surfaces [135], often leading to surface reconstruction [136,137]. On one hand, the presence of surface oxygen and the possibility of surface reconstruction can either block the reaction or facilitate chemisorption and further reaction (ensemble effect) [137,138]; on the other hand, the large electronegativity of O atoms can modify the electron density of metals and thereby modify their chemical activity (ligand effect). The effect of preadsorbed O on metal surfaces has received considerable attention recently. In the presence of preadsorbed O, CH3OH decomposes on almost all substrates. As demonstrated in Section 2.1, in the absence of surface O, there is always some degree of dissociation on metal surfaces except Cu, Ag and Au, on which CH3OH prefers reversible adsorption/desorption. Therefore extensive studies have been performed to investigate the effect of preadsorbed O on CH3OH decomposition on Group 11 metal surfaces. 2.3.1 O-Group 11 metal surfaces 2.3.1.1 O–Au surfaces Using TPD and vibrational HREELS, Xu et al. uncovered the important mechanistic information about the reaction of CH3OH with O–Au(111), which leads to the formation of the ester product, HCOOCH3 [60]. TPD of adsorbed CH3OH by Mullins et al. showed desorption of only CH3OH, H2O, CO, and CO2 from O–Au(111). No other partial oxidation products or derivatives were observed [61]. The difference between the two studies was attributed to the surface O coverage, which can be used to tune the product selectivity [60]. A follow-up study by Xu et al. using DFT showed that the presence of surface O atoms at local 3-fold hollow sites and coverage of 0.11 monolayer does not affect the preference of reaction pathway and Path is favored on both clean and O-preadsorbed Au(111) ( Fig. 13) [59]. What the preadsorbed O affects is the energetics of the reaction intermediates and transition states. Compared to clean Au(111), O of O–Au(111) not only results a gain of ∼0.29eV in CH3OH binding by forming hydrogen bond (Fig. 13), but also lowers the barriers for O–H bond scission of CH3OH by 1.17eV and C–H bond cleavage of H3CO by 0.15eV [59]. In addition, the rate-limiting step changes from the CH3OH dehydrogenation to H3CO in the case of Au(111) to H3CO dehydrogenation to H2CO on O–Au(111). The production of CH3OCHO from the reaction of H3CO and H2CO is barrierless, which agrees well with experimental observations [60,139]. Both experiments [60,61] and the DFT calculation showed that H2CO production from CH3OH is not likely on O–Au(111), whereas it is the major product on clean Au surfaces (Table 1). 2.3.1.2 O–Ag surfaces Wachs and Madix proposed Path for CH3OH decomposition on O–Ag(110) surface on the basis of TPRS [54]. The reaction between CH3OH and surface O produces a H3CO intermediate, which decomposes to H2CO. The observation of H2CO implies a desorption-limited formation step. In accordance with experiments, DFT studies by Montoya and Haynes also showed that compared to clean Ag(111), O at the 3-fold hollow sites of the Ag surface do not change the reaction pathway at both 0.25 and 0.11 monolayer of coverage, and H2CO formation via Path is favorable [55]. The surface O leads to the stronger binding of the intermediates involved in CH3OH decomposition. In the absence of O, O–H bond cleavage of CH3OH and C–H bond cleavage of H3CO are endothermic and are hindered by significant energy barriers. In the presence of surface O, the reactions become exothermic and the energy barriers are lowered, not only by more tightly binding H3CO and H2CO, but also by the formation of OH with H atoms from dehydrogenation. DFT calculations showed that O–H bond cleavage of CH3OH is also facilitated on the O–Ag(110) surface [56,57]. By contrast, the effect of sub-surface O atoms on CH3OH decomposition is less dramatic [55–57]. 2.3.1.3 O–Cu surfaces Russell Jr. et al. found that the preadsorbed O on a Cu(111) facilitates the decomposition of CH3OH to H3CO and H2O at 187–350K, while on a clean surface, the CH3OH molecule desorbs at 210K without reaction [40]. With increasing of temperature, H3CO decomposes to H2CO, which desorbs as a major product [40]. On the surface, Sexton et al. found that reactivity of O–Cu(110) towards CH3OH is increased by at least a factor of two compared to that of Cu(110), resulting in a substantial H3CO formation below 370K and H2CO formation at higher temperatures [43]. On O–Cu(100), CH3OH is found to form H3CO at or below 90K [140]. These results indicate that surface oxygen does not change the reaction pathway for methanol decomposition on Cu, i.e., Path is still preferred; however, the presence of surface O increases the reaction rate and induces the formation of H2O as a major product rather than H2 in the case of clean Cu surfaces. In addition, the optical studies attribute the promoting effect of O to the synergy between O and Cu. By covering all the Cu sites with O, the surface interacts weakly with CH3OH and no decomposition is observed [141]. Gomes and Gomes employed DFT and adopted a Cu22 cluster to model CH3OH decomposition on a Cu(111) surface with adsorbed O on 3-fold hollow sites [142]. The results showed that the potential energy goes downhill along the reaction path, 2CH3OH+3O→2H3CO+2O+H2O→2CH2O+2O+H2+H2O→2CH2OO+H2+H2O→2CO2+3H2+H2O, though other possible reaction pathways have not been considered. The overall change in energy was calculated to be −4.34eV. DFT slab calculations used by Tao et al. also pointed out a substantial decrease in the barrier (∼0.8eV) and reaction energy for CH3OH+O→H3CO+OH and H3CO+O→H2CO+OH when going from O–Cu(111) to Cu(111) [47]. Similar effects of surface O were predicted by DFT calculations for Cu(110) and Cu(100) [45]. In accordance with the experimental observations [141], the DFT studies confirm that O acts as a promoter for CH3OH decomposition. 2.3.2 O-Groups 8–10 metal surfaces By comparison to Group 11 metals, the effect of surface O on Groups 8–10 metal surfaces is much less studied for CH3OH decomposition. Experiments using various techniques investigated the CH3OH decomposition on O–Pt surfaces [143,144], O–Pd surfaces [75], O–Rh surfaces [106], and O–Fe surfaces [97,98]. The reaction pathway has been found depending strongly on the initial CH3OH coverage and O coverage. As a result, the products vary from H2CO, HCOO to CO2. However, no theoretical study for these systems has been reported so far, except for O–Ru [145]. 2.3.2.1 O–Ru surfaces Infrared spectroscopy experiments on O–Ru(001) under UHV conditions showed CH3OH dissociation to H3CO for a low exposure (0.05L) at 90K and to H2CO, HCO and HCOO at higher temperatures (100K≤T≤130K) [146]. The O coverage determined the stability of the reaction intermediates, indicating the direct participation of preadsorbed O in the reaction [102]. DFT calculations were performed by Cordeiro et al. to study the important H3CO intermediate on O–Ru(001) at low O coverage, where two-layer cluster Ru n(n=13–28) clusters was used to model the surface [145]. The results showed that the bonding geometry of H3CO is not particularly affected by pre-adsorption of O at 3-fold hollow sites and low coverage. Instead, the adsorbed H3CO is less stable by ∼0.3eV on the O-modified surface than that on clean surface and is expected to dissociate or desorb more easily, which confirms the experimental findings. This decrease in H3CO adsorption energy was attributed to downward-shift (0.6eV) in the d-band center introduced by the presence of surface O (ligand effect, Fig. 14) [145]. In general, CH3OH decomposition on transition metal surfaces can be promoted by the preadsorbed O. For noble Group-11 metals, the synergetic effect has been identified. O on the surface helps to lower the barrier for dehydrogenation, by stabilizing CHxO intermediate via O…H hydrogen bonds and the H atoms via the formation of OH, while the metal sites bind CH3OH, other CHxO species and CO. For the active metals, O moderates the activity of the metal sites and therefore decreases the possibility of surface poisoning. The reaction pathway and energetics strongly depend on the initial coverage of O and CH3OH, which is able to tune the activity and product selectivity. Depending on the activity of the metal and coverage of O and CH3OH, the products for CH3OH decomposition may vary from H2CO, HCOO, CH3OCHO to CO and CO2. However, the theoretical studies have so far only focused on the initial dehydrogenation, and the mechanism of “deep oxidation” of CH3OH, which leads to the formation of CO2 instead of H2CO or CO, has not been fully investigated."
5,Metal oxide surfaces,"2.4 Metal oxide surfaces By exposing O on metal surfaces, metal oxides may form, which show acidic and basic sites at the surface, thus making it possible to catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions possible, including hydrogenations, dehydrogenations and oxidations. On one hand, the oxidation of metal sites may lead to a different activity (ligand effect); on the other hand, the presence of O may not only vary the number of metal sites available to the reaction, but also facilitate the reaction via the direct participation (ensemble effect). 2.4.1 TiO2 Aimed at understanding the photochemical oxidation of organics on TiO2 surfaces, extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the chemistry of CH3OH on TiO2(110) surfaces [147]. On the vacuum annealed rutile TiO2 surface, TPD, LEED and HREELS measurements showed that CH3OH generally adsorbs intact, but can dissociate to CH3O at bridged O vacancy sites. CH3OH dissociation at non-vacancy sites was also reported [147,148]. It has not firmly established whether CH3OH can dissociate on the stoichiometric surface. DFT calculations and MD simulations using slab model demonstrated that on stoichiometric TiO2(110) surface, the molecular adsorbs at 5-fold coordinated Ti sites with an adsorption energy varying within 0.7–1.0eV depending on the coverage ( Fig. 15) [149–151]. The dehydrogenation of CH3OH to H3CO is found to be thermoneutral and barrierless (barrier, ∼0.1eV). The energy barrier for the reverse reaction is also low and the adsorbed H3CO readily desorbs as CH3OH. On a defective surface, vacancy sites are preferred by CH3OH, as shown in Fig. 15. Dissociation onto a neighboring O site to produce OH (Fig. 15) is thermodynamically favored (reaction energy,∼−0.5eV; barrier, ∼0.4eV) [149,150] In agreement with experiment, CH3OH energetically is able to dissociate into H3CO on TiO2(110) with and without defects. However, only the defect sites stabilize the H3CO product and effectively prevent the recombination of H3CO and H. On the more photo-catalytically active anatase surfaces, XPS showed no evidence of CH3OH dissociation. However, TPD detected features characteristic of adsorbed H3CO, which was attributed to the dissociation at step edges [152]. DFT and MD calculations by Tilocca and Selloni indicated that molecular adsorptions at 5-fold Ti site of TiO2(101) is thermodynamically favored (adsorption energy, ∼−0.7eV for coverage up to 1 ML), in agreement with experiment; yet the possibility of dissociation to H3CO increases with coverage [153]. In presence of bridged O vacancies, which is less common in anatase than in rutile, the 4-fold Ti sites interact more strongly with CH3OH than the 5-fold Ti sites and the O vacancy sites. The dissociation products leading to H3CO species are predicted to be lower in energy (∼0.6eV) than intact CH3OH adsorption. On the hydroxylated surface, dissociative and molecular adsorptions were found to be competitive [153]. 2.4.2 Cu2O Cu2O has been postulated to be catalytically active for the oxidative carbonylation of CH3OH [154], though the details of the catalytic mechanism are still unclear. Periodic DFT calculations by Zhang et al. were carried out to investigate the mechanism of CH3OH decomposition on a Cu2O (111) surface [155]. The most energetically favorable adsorption site for methanol was found to be at coordinately unsaturated Cu sites (adsorption energy, −0.9eV). The DFT calculations also predicted that the formation of H3CO by O–H bond cleavage is activated with a barrier of ∼1eV. Similarly to a clean Cu(111) surface, the preadsorbed O is shown to be able to lower the barrier for O–H scission by ∼0.3eV by stabilizing the released H atoms via the formation of OH, while C–O bond breaking remains highly unlikely (barrier, ∼3eV). 2.4.3 Cr2O3 Cr2O3 has a wide variety of uses in alcohol hydration and dehydrogenation [156]. Using TDS, AES and LEED, Mensch et al. observed CH4, H2CO, CO, CO2 and H2 as products in thermal desorption following CH3OH adsorption on Cr-terminated α-Cr2O3 ( 10 1 ¯ 2 ) surface at 600–800K [156]. The O-terminated surface is completely unreactive. DFT calculations of the Cr-terminated α-Cr2O3(0001) surface predicted that CH3OH bind via the O atom at a 3-fold hollow site (adsorption energy, −0.82eV), with the OH bond tilted towards the nearby O [157]. H3CO was strongly adsorbed to the surface with an adsorption energy of −3.3eV, providing a driving force for O–H cleavage and H3CO formation. In addition, the adsorption energy and structure of methanol on α-Cr2O3(001) do not change with coverage. 2.4.4 Ga2O3 Ga2O3 is normally an insulator and is chemically and thermally stable. On the surface of β-Ga2O3 polymorph, FTIR measurements verified the presence of intact molecular CH3OH and H3CO from dissociative adsorption [158,159]. Using a cluster model, DFT calculations by Branda et al. showed that the interaction of CH3OH with the β-Ga2O3(100) surface strongly depends on the local surface chemical environment [159]. The β-Ga2O3(100) surface without O vacancies is very reactive. The unsaturated surface O atoms strongly oxidize the adsorbed CH3OH, producing H2CO, HCOOH, CO2 and H2O ( Fig. 16). On the other hand, CH3OH adsorbed on tetrahedral and octahedral Ga sites is non-dissociative. The dissociation of CH3OH to H3CO is only energetically feasible by introducing neighboring O vacancies on tetrahedral Ga sites. 2.4.5 Al2O3 Al2O3 is catalytically active for the dehydration of alcohols, and has been used as a support for catalysts employed in the decomposition of CH3OH [160]. Experiments using UPS, HREELS and TPD observed that CH3OH molecularly chemisorbs on α-Al2O3 under UHV conditions, and produces HCOO under higher pressure conditions [161,162]. DFT slab calculations by Borck and Schröde showed that CH3OH binds to Al atoms at the α-Al2O3(001) surface, corresponding to an adsorption energy of −1.23eV at a coverage 0.25 ML and −1.03eV at 1 ML coverage [163]. No theoretical study of CH3OH decomposition on Al2O3 has been reported so far. 2.4.6 CeO2 A TPD study demonstrated that the fully oxidized CeO2(111) surface is not active for CH3OH adsorption or decomposition at a saturation dose at room temperature [164]. CH3OH was observed to adsorb dissociatively on O vacancy sites to produce the H3CO intermediate, which undergoes dehydrogenation to H2CO and H2O at 680K on CeO2(111). Using DFT, Mei et al. showed that the behavior of CH3OH on a fully oxidized CeO2(111) surface is coverage-dependent [165]. At low coverage, the dissociative adsorption to form H2COH and OH via C–H bond breaking is preferred (reaction energy, −0.43eV/molecule at 0.25 ML, Fig. 17). At a coverage higher than 0.5 ML, the intact molecular adsorption is more energetically favorable than the dissociative adsorption, and CH3OH dissociation favors O–H bond scission to form H3CO (reaction energy, 0.23eV at 1 ML, Fig. 17). The full decomposition mechanism and kinetics have not investigated. 2.4.7 MgO MgO has been considered as a prototype system for the studying the catalytic properties of oxides, due to its very simple cubic crystalline structure. XPS revealed that CH3OH only dissociates at low coordination adsorption sites [166]. IR indicated the presence of intact CH3OH and H3CO dissociation products linked to a Mg ion as well as surface CH3 group linked to an O ion [167]. To understand the influence of coordination number of the adsorption site on the adsorption process, DFT calculations were carried out using a cluster model to represent the local structure of the MgO surface [168–170]. The energetics of CH3OH dissociation was shown by the calculations to increase with the decreasing coordination number of the surface atoms. The calculated adsorption energy of CH3OH varies from ∼−0.6eV on terraces to ∼−1.8eV at edges and steps. Dissociative adsorption to H3CO and H is energetically favored only at O vacancies (∼−2.4eV) [170], in agreement with the experimental observations. 2.4.8 ZnO XPS and UPS measurements showed that in the absence of O vacancies, CH3OH adsorbed on ZnO molecularly with a small amount of H3CO from dissociation [171]. In agreement with the experiment, DFT calculations by Pala and Metiu showed that the most stable state is the molecularly adsorbed CH3OH at the Zn sites with a adsorption energy of −1.1eV [172]. In contrast, dissociations via O–H scission to form H3CO and OH (−0.8eV) and via C–O scission to give CH3 and OH (−0.4eV) are less favorable. Overall, the theoretical calculations for CH3OH decomposition show that in general on metal oxides the O anions and metal cations operate in a synergistic way, where both ensemble and ligand effects play an important role. Surface O helps the dehydrogenation by forming OH species with the H atoms produced from the dehydrogenation reactions. The oxidation by surface O is able to tune the activity of surface metal cation sites. The high activity is expected for the metal cations, which are active enough to adsorb CH3OH and H x CO species produced by dissociation, and inert enough to avoid C–O bond cleavage on the parent metal surfaces. However, so far theoretical calculations have been limited to the adsorption of the molecule and the first dehydrogenation step, though further decomposition reactions have been observed experimentally."
6,"Metal carbide, sulfide and chloride surfaces","2.5 Metal carbide, sulfide and chloride surfaces Analogous to the metal oxides, the addition of other elements to form carbide, sulfide and chloride may modify the activity of metals. The phenomena responsible for the chemical properties of these metal compounds are again attributed to a distinct electronic structure induced by the presence of the light element (ligand effect) and the effect of embedding light element in/on the surface ensembles of metal sites (ensemble effect). 2.5.1 Metal carbides Early transition metal carbides have attracted considerable attention as potential catalysts since they often exhibit catalytic properties similar to Pt [173]. Moreover, the transition metal carbides of Groups 4–6 combine the unique properties of both metals and ceramics, with good electrical and thermal conductivity while possessing ultra-hardness at the same time, very high melting points and stability [174]. It has been shown that transition metal carbides can display a range of performances depending on the nature of the metal centers, the C (Carbon)/M (Metal) ratio and orientation of the carbide surfaces [175–179]. 2.5.1.1 Mo2C surfaces Mo2C has been reported to catalyze many important reactions, e.g. hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [180] and water–gas shift (WGS) [179]. Barthos et al. reported that Mo2C on ZSM-5 markedly enhanced the aromatization of CH3OH [181]. Using a C support, the reaction pathway is altered and CH3OH decomposition to H2 is prominent. TPD showed that Mo2C/C is an effective catalyst for conversion of CH3OH to H2 and CO with selectivity for H2 of ∼80% at 623–673K. The catalyst also exhibits remarkable stability [182]. To provide a deeper understanding of the adsorption and decomposition, Pistonesi et al. studied CH3OH adsorption and decomposition on a Mo-terminated β-Mo2C(001) surface using DFT [183]. CH3OH is shown to prefer the adsorption on the Mo top sites with an adsorption energy of −0.39eV, which is very close to the experimental value [182]. The presence of C atoms lead to electron transfer from Mo to C and the deactivation of Mo (ligand effect) [179]; yet the dissociation of CH3OH to H3CO via Path is energetically favorable (reaction energy, −0.84eV; barrier, 0.6eV). The further decomposition reactions and the ensemble effect have not been studied. 2.5.1.2 WC surfaces A complete mapping of CH3OH decomposition on a W-terminated WC(001) surface was obtained using DFT, where a strong CH3OH–W interaction was observed (adsorption energy, −0.82eV, Fig. 18) [72]. The calculations found that C–H scission does not occur readily over WC; therefore, CH3OH preferentially decomposes first to H3CO via Path (Fig. 18). Further dehydrogenation of H3CO is not favored; instead, the C–O bond scission to form CH3 is preferred, which likely recombines with nearby protons and desorbs in the form of CH4 (Fig. 18). The rate-limiting step in this process is the C–O scission. The tendency of WC to break the C–O bond makes it less selective for the conversion of CH3OH to CO and H2. It is known that controlling the methanation pathway is critical to DMFC as it consumes four of the six electrons produced in CH3OH decomposition (67% of the available power). Therefore, WC is not good catalyst for DMFC. The DFT results are in consistent with the experiment [72]. TPD revealed that WC is very active and leads to complete decomposition of CH3OH, forming H2 and CH4. HREELS demonstrated the formation of H3CO upon heating to 200K and CH3 after heating to 300K, where both intermediates are predicted in the optimal pathways predicted by DFT (Fig. 18). 2.5.2 Metal sulfides 2.5.2.1 MoS2 surfaces Extensive theoretical and experimental studies were carried out to study the superior catalytic behavior of MoS2 for HDS [184] and hydrogenation (HYD) [185,186]. Using DFT, Chen et al., investigated CH3OH adsorption and dissociation at Mo and S edges of MoS2, which has been considered as active sites for catalysis [187]. The calculations showed that the adsorption of CH3OH molecule through the O atom prefers the top of corner Mo on both Mo- (adsorption energy, −1.27eV) and S- (adsorption energy, −1.00eV) edges. O–H scission of CH3OH on both edges (Path ) was found to be the most favorable pathway with a barrier of 0.45eV for Mo-edge and 1.16eV for S-edge, respectively. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the MoS2 surface is likely dominated by H3CO species. Possible C–O bond cleavage to form methylene (CH2) is also identified on the Mo edge. During this process, Mo plays an important role in adsorbing CH3OH and most of the reaction intermediates; in contrast, the role of S atoms is minor, which only stabilizes the dissociated H atoms by forming HS. Increasing the amount of S at the Mo edge was found to increase the barriers for the bond breakings. No experiment has been reported so far. 2.5.3 Metal chlorides 2.5.3.1 CuCl surfaces CuCl was found active for CH3OH synthesis from syngas and oxidative carbonylation of CH3OH [188,189]. Wang et al. used periodic DFT to investigate the decomposition of CH3OH over a CuCl(111) surface, where the surface contains both Cu and Cl sites in a 1:1 ratio ( Fig. 19) [190]. According to the calculations, CH3OH is adsorbed on the top of surface Cu. Depending on the coverage, the adsorption energy ranges from −0.63eV at 0.06 ML to −0.46eV at 1 ML. Path initiated by O–H bond breaking of CH3OH (barrier, 0.42eV) was found to be the lowest energy path. In addition, the reaction is highly activated due to the rate-limiting dehydrogenation of H3CO to H2CO (barrier, 3.18eV) in Path , which is much higher than that on pure Cu surfaces (Table 1) and can be facilitated in the presence of surface O on CuCl(111) (barrier, 1.25eV) [190]. During the decomposition process, only Cu sites appears to be active and no direct participation of Cl is shown. Compared to pure Cu, the Cu sites on CuCl(111) are much less active due to the ligand effect by Cl; on the other hand the ensemble effect seems to contribute to deactivation, where the Cl ions act as a spectator and do not interact with the reaction intermediates. No experimental study of CH3OH adsorption on CuCl surfaces has been reported. As demonstrated above, the formation of metal compounds, such as oxides, carbides, sulfides and chlorides, also offers the opportunity to modify the activity of metal towards CH3OH decomposition. The ligand effect leads to the oxidation of metals, which therefore can have a significant impact on the decomposition. The ensemble effect also contributes. The light elements may either act as a spectator and decrease the number of active metal sites, or participate in the reaction directly to help the dehydrogenation by binding H atoms. Consequently, light elements play an essential role in CH3OH decomposition on metal compounds and varying the amount of light elements can have significant effects on the activity."
7,Metal/support,"2.6 Metal/support Another way to modify the chemical activity of metals is to use support. Extensive studies have shown that the formations of metal/support materials, in some cases, are able to combine the advantages of metal and support and achieve a superior activity different from the parent systems [15–17,19,29,191–194]. However, due to the structural complexity of such materials, fundamental understanding of the catalytic behaviors, e.g. reaction mechanism and active sites, is difficult to achieve only using the experimental techniques. To identify the role of metal, support and metal-support interface in the reactions, theory plays an essential role, capable of providing fundamental understandings to chemical reactions on composite materials [15–17,19,29,191–194], though for CH3OH decomposition, so far, there has only been one theoretical study on metal/support. 2.6.1 Pt/WC Pt/WC is particularly interesting because it shows promising activity and stability for the electrooxidation of CH3OH, superior to WC by itself [195]. To understand the promoting effect, DFT calculations were performed to predict the reaction pathways on the Pt overlayer supported on WC(001) surface (Pt/WC) [72]. This model is a very different from the supported metal particle, as shown in Section 3.4, which includes an exposed boundary between metal and support. Similar to WC, Path is identified as the optimal path for CH3OH decomposition on Pt/WC, while on Pt surfaces, as shown in Table 1, multiple pathways have been predicted to run in parallel (Path – ). The binding of CH3OH is weaker than Pt and WC alone (adsorption energy, −0.36eV, Fig. 20). The rate-limiting step was found to be the first dehydrogenation of CH3OH to form H3CO. Finally, different from WC (Fig. 18) but similar to Pt, the production of hydrocarbons via C–O cleavage were highly activated on Pt/WC. Therefore, the methanation pathway can be prohibited (Fig. 20). The results from DFT calculations are in agreement with the experiment [72]. According to TPD measurements, the production of CH4 is prevented by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of Pt on the surface of WC. In HREELS on Pt/WC, H3CO and H2CO-like species were also detectable. The results discussed above demonstrate that the formation of Pt/WC surface is able to optimize the activity towards CH3OH decomposition. Pt/WC behaves differently from WC and Pt. The decomposition mechanism on Pt/WC retains much of the high activity on WC but results in minimal CH4 formation like Pt."
8,Catalyst development for CH3OH decomposition from understanding,"2.7 Catalyst development for CH3OH decomposition from understanding Pure metal surfaces have been studied the most extensively for CH3OH decomposition both theoretically and experimentally. What do we learn? As mono-functional catalysts, some metals bond the molecule too weakly to adsorb and dissociate CH3OH. Some metals bond the adsorbates too strongly to remove the products, which results in the poisoning of the catalysts. Following the Sabatier's principle, [118] Pt has been identified as the best metal catalyst for CH3OH decomposition, [117] being able to provide a moderate binding to facilitate the decomposition as well as allow the removal of product. To further improve the activity for CH3OH decomposition, one of the effective ways is to use multifunctional catalysts. Fig. 21 displays the catalyst development to achieve higher performance by increasing the complexity of the catalysts from pure metal, metal modified by light elements or the secondary metal, metal compound to metal/support. It has been found that introducing new components on the surface can be an effective way to improve catalytic activity and selectivity. One way is to form alloys (Fig. 21). The secondary metal species may either participate in the reaction directly to catalyze some of the elementary steps, or act as a building block to vary the atomic arrangement of the active metal sites (ensemble effect). In addition, it may modify the electronic structure of the active metals to tune its catalytic activity (ligand effect). If it works well, both effects allow alloys working as bi-functional catalyst, which leads to an improved activity and selectivity for CH3OH decomposition. Another way is to incorporate small amount of light elements, e.g. O (Fig. 21). In general, the light element (X) in the metal surface, facilitates the decomposition reaction by stabilizing H x CO via the X…H hydrogen bond and the dissociated H via the formation of XH species (ensemble). X coverage also plays an important role, which may vary the metal activity and selectivity towards CH3OH decomposition. Significant promoting effects of X have been observed for noble metals; in contrast it is less effective for active metals. The formation of early transition metal compounds, e.g. oxides, sulfides, carbides and chlorides, may also improve the activity of metal-based catalysts (Fig. 21). On one hand, the strong X-metal interaction changes the metal oxidation state (ligand effect). As shown in Fig. 10, this can be an effective way to tune the activity of metal cations by modifying the appropriate binding energies to an adsorbant and achieve the optimal activity. On another hand, the nonmetal species again may affect the arrangement of metal sites and help in the interactions with HxCO species and H atoms (ensemble effect). However, none of the metal compounds reported so far has been a good catalyst for selective CH3OH decomposition to produce CO. For some cases the metal ions are too inert and the decomposition only produces H x CO rather than CO due to the “over-deactivation” of the metals sites via the reaction with X; for the other cases, the deactivation by interacting with X is not enough and the metal ions are still too active. As a result, the C–O bond cleavage may occur, which leads to the formation of CH4. The further development of catalysts for CH3OH decomposition relies on forming multifunctional materials, aimed at combining the advantages of metal clusters, metal ions and light element ions for decomposing reactants and removing products (Fig. 21). The synergy among the different components has been observed for many important catalytic conversions, resulting in an activity and selectivity superior to each component by itself [15–17,19,29,191–194]. For CH3OH decomposition, indeed, Pt/WC behaves differently from WC and Pt. retaining much of its high activity on WC but minimize the production of CH4 as that on Pt."
9,CO2 conversion to methanol,"In general, the use of CO2 as a potential C source has been hampered by its chemical inertness. The transformation of CO2 into other organic compounds, however, can typically be mediated by various transition metals that are able to activate CO2 or its coupling partner, resulting in the formation of new C–C, C–N, C–O, or C–H bonds [196]. Meanwhile, CO2 is not only a greenhouse gas but is also the greatest C resource in the world. In recent years, much attention has been paid to the chemical fixation of CO2 to synthesize useful intermediates and chemicals. A number of compounds have been reported to react with CO2 in the presence of metal catalysts, including hydrogen, alkenes, acetals, epoxides, amines, and carbon–carbon unsaturated compounds. Hydrogenation of CO2 to synthesize CH3OH has attracted considerable interests [3,8,197]. This reaction is of great industrial importance because CH3OH is an important resource to synthesize many organic compounds, e. g., acetic acid (CH3COOH), HCOOCH3 [10]. More importantly, CH3OH has been proposed as an alternative energy source. It is used conveniently in internal combustion engine or DMFC, where CO2 produced from the thermal or electrochemical combustion of CH3OH as liquid fuel can be chemically converted back into CH3OH [1,198]. In this way a CO2 neutral cycle will be completed. This has been also believed to be a promising way to lower levels of atmospheric CO2 [10]. CH3OH synthesis from CO2 and H2 is an exothermic reaction (ΔH 0=−49kJ/mol). It has been found that the kinetics hinders the overall conversion. Hence, the performance of the catalyst is of great importance to make this process viable. Commercially CH3OH is produced from syngas mixture (CO–CO2–H2) over a Cu–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at the industrial conditions (493–573K and 5–10MPa) [199]. Isotopic labeling experiments showed that CO2 is the dominant C source for CH3OH synthesis [200]. Despite considerable effort to optimize this catalytic system, the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH is kinetically limited to 15–25% under the industrial conditions [8]. In order to design a catalyst with a better performance, great efforts have been devoted to investigate the underlying reaction mechanism over a variety of catalysts. Fig. 22 presents five possible reaction pathways for the conversion of CO2 and H2 to CH3OH. Path 1 is the conventional formate pathway, where the reaction proceeds through the formation of HCOO, H2COO (dioxomethylene), H2CO, H3CO and the final product, CH3OH. Path 2 is the modified formate pathway. It also starts with the HCOO formation, but unlike Path 1, HCOOH (formic acid) is formed rather than H2COO. Instead of desorption, HCOOH is further hydrogenated to form H2COOH (hydroxymethoxy), which eventually overlaps with Path 1 to produce H2CO, H3CO and CH3OH. Path 3 is initiated by the CO2 dissociation rather than the hydrogenation to form CO, which is then hydrogenated to produce CH3OH via HCO, H2CO and H3CO intermediates. Path 4 is very similar to Path 3. The only difference is that CO along Path 4 is produced through the reverse water–gas-shift reaction (RWGS, CO2+H2→CO+H2O) via the HOCO intermediate. Path 5 is a H2O-mediated mechanism, where the HOCO intermediate is also involved. In Path 5, H2O is the H atom source for hydrogenation. Here, one of the O–H bonds in H2O breaks and the H atom reacts with the adsorbed CO2 to form HOCO, while the remaining OH group reacts with the other surface H to produce H2O. The HOCO intermediate is further hydrogenated to COHOH (dihydrocarbene) by O–H bond formation. Finally, the dissociation of COHOH leads to the formation of COH and CH3OH via the intermediates HCOH and H2COH."
10,Metal surfaces,"3.1 Metal surfaces 3.1.1 Cu As Cu is considered the active component in the commercial catalyst, surface science studies of CH3OH synthesis have focused on Cu surfaces, including polycrystalline Cu, [201] Cu(111), [202] Cu(100) [203–205] and Cu(110) [206]. According to TPD, AES and XPS measurements, CO2 has been found to adsorb on Cu surfaces weakly [207–210]. Experimental studies have also determined that the apparent activation energy for CH3OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is ∼0.8eV on polycrystalline Cu[201], ∼1.1eV on Cu(111) [202], ∼0.7eV on Cu(110) [206] and Cu(100) [203,204]. Under reaction conditions, both CH3OH synthesis and the RWGS reaction occur simultaneously and CO is detected as a byproduct of the reaction ( Fig. 23) [201,202,206]. HCOO species has also been detected on the postreaction surface [201–204,206]. Despite all the experimental efforts mentioned above, some fundamental questions regarding the reaction mechanism remains unanswered. What is the dominant reaction pathway of the reaction? Is HCOO a reaction intermediate or merely a spectator? What are the identities of the possible intermediates? What is the rate-limiting step during the reaction? To answer these fundamental questions, DFT calculations were carried out for the CH3OH synthesis reaction over extended Cu surfaces and small clusters as one kind of model systems for Cu-based catalysts. Hu et al. studied the reaction on a Cu(100) surface using an adcluster model [211]. The surface was modeled by a Cu8 cluster. They proposed that Path 1 is the preferred reaction pathway. The rate-limiting step during the reaction was found to be the hydrogenation of HCOO to H2COO with a barrier as high as 1.00eV ( Table 2) and the further hydrogenation of H2COO to H2CO was also not easy (barrier: 0.74eV) [212]. More recently, Yang et al. carried out DFT calculations to study the reaction mechanism on a Cu(111) surface and a Cu29 nanoparticle to model the terrace and corner sites of the Cu nanoparticles in the commercial catalysts [202]. As shown in Fig. 24, Cu29 adopts a pyramidal structure formed by a combination of (100) and (111) surface, with low-coordinated sites at the corner. Path 1 (Fig. 22) was found to be favored for CH3OH production over Cu29. CO2 does not bind to the Cu29 nanoparticle, therefore the first hydrogenation step follows an Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism. Hydrogenation of HCOO was predicted to be one of the difficult steps with a relatively high barrier of 1.34eV (Fig. 24). Another difficult step is the hydrogenation of H2COO with similarly high barrier of 1.41eV (Fig. 24). In accordance with the experiments [202], the calculations estimated that the CO production via the RWGS reaction is∼100 times faster than the CH3OH production via Path 1 (Fig. 23). CH3OH production from CO via the RWGS pathway (Path 4, Fig. 22) is hindered by CO hydrogenation to HCO due to the instability of HCO (Fig. 24). As a result, CO is likely to accumulate as a product instead of being hydrogenated to produce CH3OH, which is also observed experimentally [202]. On Cu(111) the reaction also follows Path 1 and the rate is controlled by both the hydrogenation of HCOO (barrier, 1.20eV) and H2COO (barrier, 1.60eV). Based on a comparison of the calculated energetics, the DFT calculations predicted that Cu29 should exhibit a superior catalytic activity over Cu(111). This agrees with the experimental observations of the increasing activity from Cu(111) to Cu/ZnO (Fig. 23), where ZnO with the O-termination is considered not to participate in the reaction directly [202]. The promoting effect of Cu nanoparticles has been attributed to the fluxionality of the structure and the presence of low-coordinated Cu sites. As shown in Fig. 24, the key intermediates, HCOO and H2COO, are stabilized by such Cu sites and therefore the corresponding hydrogenation barriers are lowered. Grabow and Mavrikakis concluded that Path 2 (Fig. 22) is preferred on Cu(111) using DFT and mean-field micro-kinetic modeling [213]. Unlike from Path 1, the hydrogenation of HCOO was found to prefer the formation of HCOOH. In spite of the fact that HCOOH is bound weakly at the top site of Cu(111) through the O atom (adsorption energy, −0.22eV, Fig. 25), the highly activated hydrogenation of HCOOH to H2COOH has been proposed (barrier, 1.04eV) as the precursor for C–O bond cleavage to form H2CO and ultimately CH3OH. The effect of CO is also included in this study. It was claimed that CO is also responsible for the production of CH3OH via the sequence CO→HCO→H2CO→H3CO→CH3OH. According to the kinetic modeling, the overall rate of CH3OH production from both CO2 and CO channel is controlled by the slow hydrogenation of H3CO (barrier, 1.17eV) with the CO2 path dominated the CH3OH production under industrial conditions. CO also promotes the CO2 path by removing the OH to produce H2O and CO2 via the WGS reaction [213]. Zhao et al. also reported on the high barriers for HCOO and H2COO hydrogenation for CH3OH synthesis via Path 1 [214]. In addition, they also proposed a water-mediated mechanism (Path 5, Fig. 22), where one of the O–H bonds of H2O is broken and the resulting H reacted with CO2 to form HOCO, while the remaining OH group reacts with the surface H to produce H2O. The calculated barrier for this step is 0.17eV, which is lower than that for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into HCOO or HOCO in absence of H2O. The COHOH produced by HOCO hydrogenation is identified as the precursor for C–O bond scission to form COH and eventually CH3OH via hydrogenation, where the C–O bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step in this pathway (barrier, 0.68eV). Besides the methanol synthesis, Cu is also the best-known metal catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 [215]. Different from the gas-phase reaction, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Cu preferred to produce hydrocarbons, e.g. CH4. Nørskov et al. performed DFT calculations on Cu surfaces, Cu(211), Cu(100) and Cu(111), to understand the electrochemical reaction mechanisms [216,217]. Their study showed that CO is produced from CO2 via the HOCO intermediate. CO is then protonated to HCO, followed by HCO sequential hydrogenation to H2CO and H3CO. CO bond breaking of H3CO is also preferred and the produced CH3 intermediate then reacts with another proton from solution to form CH4. CH3OH is not the products of CO2 electroreduction due to a higher potential required compared to that for producing CH4 formation. During this process, the protonation of adsorbed CO is identified as the most important step contributing to the overpotential [215]. 3.1.2 Ni Ni deposited on Cu(100) has been shown to promote methanol synthesis from a gas mixture of CO, CO2 and H2 [218–221]. To better understand the promoting effect of Ni on the methanol synthesis reaction, a number of experimental studies have been devoted to investigating the CO2 activation on Ni(110) using surface science techniques such as TPD, XPS, HREELS and STM [222–225]. On Ni(110), CO2 is found to be chemically bound in a bent configuration [222–225] and the hydrogenation of CO2 leads to HCOO on the surface [221,222,224]. Further hydrogenation of HCOO does not happen under UHV condition. Instead, HCOO undergoes dehydrogenation [221,226]. At higher H2 pressure, both CO and H2O are observed as the result of CO2 activation on Ni(110) [221]. Despite these experimental efforts, several important mechanistic questions remain unanswered. Why is HCOO the dead-end spectator on Ni(110)? What is the mechanism of CO production? Why is CO produced on Ni(110) instead of CH3OH? In order to obtain an atomic-scale description of the reaction, theoretical studies have been conducted by a number of groups. Consistent with experimental observation, the DFT calculations showed that CO2 occupies a surface hollow site in a bent configuration on Ni(110) ( Fig. 26) [221,223,227,228]. HCOO formation from the adsorbed CO2 is also identified by the calculations as an easy step with an activation barrier of 0.43eV [221,224]. However, the further reactions of HCOO via either hydrogenation to produce H2COO and HCOOH, or dissociation back to CO2 or CO are predicted to be all highly activated (Fig. 26). Therefore HCOO is claimed to be a dead-end spectator, which agrees with experimental observations under UHV conditions [221]. To simulate the high pressure of H2, the interaction between adsorbed CO2 and the gas-phase atomic H was studied (Fig. 26). Besides producing HCOO on the surface, CO2 hydrogenation also leads to the formation of the HOCO precursor with a barrier as low as 0.12eV. The latter reaction step is responsible for the experimental observation of CO production via the RWGS reaction [221]. One can see from this section that CH3OH synthesis on metal surfaces is even more complicated than the decomposition. Several reaction pathways are needed to be considered and they may run in parallel. Along one pathway, several slow steps are involved in the reaction and it is difficult to pinpoint a single rate-limiting step. For these more complex systems, the DFT calculations alone are not capable of providing a complete description of the reaction network. One of more effective approaches is the coupling of DFT results with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations under reaction conditions [229]. As an example, the calculation by combining DFT, KMC and sensitivity analysis was performed to study the CH3OH production on Cu(111), where both Path 1 and Path 4 were considered [229]. The sensitivity analysis is based on the KMC simulations, where the activation barrier of each elementary step is varied arbitrarily and independently. In this way the sensitivity of the CH3OH production rate to each activated elementary step can be evaluated [230]. As shown in Fig. 27, three key factors that are able to control the production of CH3OH are identified, namely the H2COO hydrogenation barrier, the CO adsorption energy and the CO hydrogenation barrier. The CH3OH yield from Path 1 can be enhanced by lowering the barrier for H2COO hydrogenation. In addition, moderate CO binding that is strong enough to prevent desorption and weak enough to allow the hydrogenation helped the CH3OH production via Path 4. Accordingly, two key parameters are identified as descriptors for CH3OH production on Cu-based catalysts. The first is the H2COO hydrogenation barrier and the other is the CO adsorption energy. Hence, to achieve high activity for CH3OH production, Cu should be modified in such a way as to promote H2COO hydrogenation and/or moderate CO binding energy. In the following, the effect of different promoters on the activity of Cu and Ni for CH3OH synthesis will be reviewed."
11,Alloy surfaces,"3.2 Alloy surfaces Previous experimental studies have shown that some surface alloys exhibit enhanced activity towards CH3OH synthesis compared with the corresponding pure Cu surfaces [218–220,231–233]. CH3OH production from CO2 hydrogenation on Zn-deposited Cu(111) [231,232], Cu(100) [233] and Cu(110) [233] surfaces were investigated by TPD, XPS and IRAS techniques. A promoting effect for Zn-deposited on Cu surfaces was observed when the Zn coverage was lower than 0.2 ML. Postreaction analysis by XPS and IRAS showed that HCOO is on the surfaces. Chorkendorff et al. observed similar promotion of CH3OH production from a gas mixture of CO, CO2 and H2 on Cu(100) modified by Ni [218–220]. In their study, CO2 hydrogenation was proposed for the formation of CH3OH, whereas CO only helps to stabilize Ni on the surface. The role of Ni in promoting the CH3OH synthesis reaction was attributed to stabilization of O-containing species. Despite all the experimental efforts devoted to characterizing the reaction mechanism on the alloys, the origin of the observed promoting effects is still unclear. A general guide of how to design better alloy catalysts for CH3OH production is still missing. Theoretical calculations have been carried out to help identify the reaction pathways, intermediates and active sites over these alloys so that a better understanding can be achieved. Nakatsuji and Hu studied the CH3OH synthesis reaction over a Zn–Cu(100) surface, which was modeled by a Cu7Zn cluster [212]. The hydrogenation of CO2 follows Path 1 to produce CH3OH, where both Cu and Zn sites directly participate in the reaction. In their calculations, the first step of CO2 hydrogenation occurs on a Cu–Cu site. The resulting HCOO is proposed to migrate to a Cu–Zn site before it is further hydrogenated to H2COO. Subsequent hydrogenation of H2COO to produce H2CO also favors the Cu–Zn sites, while H2CO prefers to diffuse back to a Cu–Cu site and be hydrogenated to H3CO and then CH3OH. The rate-limiting step on Zn–Cu(100) is predicted to be the hydrogenation of H2COO and the corresponding barrier is lower than that on Cu(100). Therefore, the Zn/Cu(100) surface is expected to have an enhanced activity compared to Cu(100), which is consistent with previous experimental observations [231–233]. The enhanced activity was explained by synergy between Cu and Zn on the surface. Recently, Yang et al. conducted a systematic study of the promoting effects of metal dopants on Cu surfaces on CH3OH synthesis [229]. DFT calculations and KMC simulations were used, and both Path 1 and Path 4 were included. Doping was modeled by replacing one of the surface Cu atoms by a dopant metal atom, corresponding to 1/9 ML coverage ( Fig. 28a). The results showed that the rate for CH3OH production increases in the sequence: Au–Cu(111)<Cu(111)<Pd–Cu(111)<Rh–Cu(111)<Pt–Cu(111)<Ni–Cu(111) (Fig. 28b). The doped metal was found to not only affect the stability of the reaction intermediates and the transition states, but could also change the preferential reaction pathway [229]. As seen in Fig. 28c, Path 1 via the HCOO intermediate dominates the CH3OH production on Cu(111) and Au-doped Cu(111) surfaces. For Pd, Rh, Pt and Ni doped Cu(111) surfaces, Path 4 via the RWGS and CO hydrogenation is an important route to produce CH3OH, and Path 1 plays the secondary role. Similar to the predictions made for the case of Cu(111) (Fig. 27, Section 3.1), the CO adsorption energy and the barrier for H2COO hydrogenation were identified as the two key parameters to capture the variation in CH3OH production rate for the different doped surfaces. Fig. 28b shows the volcano-like trend for the CO adsorption energy versus the CH3OH production rate, where Ni-doped Cu(111) sits at the top. With increasing CO binding energy, e.g., from Au to Ni, the CO desorption rate is decreased, while the CO hydrogenation still has a reasonable rate. The doping of Rh results in CO-poisoning, due to the strong Rh–CO interaction. Therefore, the study of doped Cu(111) systems validates the predictions from the sensitivity analysis performed for Cu(111) [229]. More specifically, a good catalyst for CH3OH synthesis should bind CO moderately, being strong enough to favor the desired CO hydrogenation rather than desorption, but weak enough to prevent CO poisoning. In addition, the significant effect of the barrier for H2COO hydrogenation on the CH3OH production rate was also validated, and similar correlation as shown in Fig. 27 was also observed for the metal-doped Cu(111) surfaces. Again Ni shows the best performance with the lowest barrier and the highest rate for CH3OH synthesis. Furthermore, the calculations also showed that facilitating Path 4 is the more effective way to promote the CH3OH production than that for Path 1. This is in consistent with the sensitivity analysis for Cu(111) shown in Fig. 27. Overall, in order to achieve high activity for CH3OH synthesis, Cu-based catalysts need to be able to hydrogenate H2COO easily and/or bond CO moderately. Modifying the catalyst may not only change the energetics, but also vary the reaction pathway."
12,Molybdenum sulfide surfaces,"3.3 Molybdenum sulfide surfaces Molybdenum sulfide catalysts, especially alkali and transition metals doped or oxide supported MoS2 nanoparticles, have shown promising activity for the conversion of syngas (mainly CO) to alcohols [9,234]. However, unpromoted and/or unsupported MoS2 nanoparticles were found to convert syngas only to hydrocarbons, e.g. CH4 [185,235]. DFT was used to study CH3OH synthesis on a model Mo6S8 cluster, which is expected to exhibit very different reactivity than stoichiometric MoS2 particles [236]. The Mo6S8 cluster has been identified as a stable species in gas-phase cluster sources [237–240] and as the basic building block of the well-known chevrel phase of molybdenum sulfide solid state compounds [241,242]. The structure of Mo6S8 cluster found in the chevrel phases is highly symmetric with a Mo6 octahedral core and the sulfur atoms located in the faces of the octahedron ( Fig. 29) [243]. The DFT results predicted that unlike MoS2, the Mo6S8 cluster is highly selective for produce CH3OH from CO2 and H2 [236]. The reaction was found to follow Path 4 (Fig. 29), with the rate-limiting step being the hydrogenation of CO to HCO (barrier, ∼1eV). The latter is lower than that on the Cu29 nanoparticles [202]. Both the Mo and S sites participate in the reaction directly. The Mo atoms were found to bind CO2, CO and HxCO, while the S sites facilitate the H–H bond cleavage by stabilizing the dissociated H atoms. In general, the Mo6S8 cluster exhibits a more complex behavior than that of pure metal nanoparticles. The substoichiometric Mo6S8 cluster has a lower intrinsic activity than MoS2 in spite of its smaller size and lower S/Mo ratio. The unique atomic and electronic structure of the Mo6S8 cluster, however, results in generally moderate interactions with the adsorbates involved in CH3OH synthesis, i.e., CO2, CO, H and H x CO. As a consequence, C–O bond cleavage, which leads to CH x formation, is suppressed during the reaction sequence. Hence, the Mo6S8 cluster was predicted to be a more selective, albeit less active, catalyst for alcohol formation than MoS2. This example shows that decreasing the non-metal concentration and/or the size of the metal particles does not necessarily lead to an increased activity, but can be used to alter selectivity instead. Especially for small metal or metal compound clusters, the specific atomic structure and stoichiometry are likely to have a larger impact on catalytic activity than just particle size."
13,Metal/oxide,"3.4 Metal/oxide Again, another way to modify the chemical activity of metals is to use support. Oxides are commonly used as support for metals. Different from the case of Pt/WC, in the following metals are modeled as particles, where an exposed boundary between metal and oxide is included. 3.4.1 Cu/oxide Extensive experimental investigations have been carried out to understand the reaction mechanism of CH3OH synthesis over metal oxides, e.g. ZnO, [202,244–248] ZrO2, [249] Al2O3, [246] SiO2, [246,248–253] supported Cu-based catalysts using surface science techniques such as TEM, FTIR, TPD and XPS. However, there still exists some controversy over the fundamental issues, e.g. the identities of reaction intermediates, the effect of the oxide support and the nature of the active site. In general, bidentate HCOO was observed to dominate the surface under the reaction conditions [202,249,251] and was proposed as a reaction intermediate [244,247,252]. However, the experiment by Yang et al. concluded that on both supported (Cu/SiO2) and unsupported Cu catalysts, the stepwise hydrogenation of bidentate HCOO involving only surface H species was not responsible for the CH3OH production under relatively mild conditions; instead, some unidentified surface O or H2O-derived species were suggested to promote the formation of CH3OH [250]. The specific roles of the oxide support and Cu particles are also under debate. On one hand, the oxide supports are believed to be important for Cu particle dispersion and do not directly participate in the reaction; [202,244,246] according to others, a synergistic effect is proposed to explain the activity of the Cu/oxide catalysts [247,248,253]. According to the experiments by Burch et al., on Cu/ZnO catalysts, CH3OH production takes place on the Cu sites and ZnO serves as a reservoir of H atoms, which are formed by dissociation of H2 on Cu and followed by diffusion to the ZnO surface [245]. Joo et al. reported that HCOO is produced on the Cu particles and migrates onto ZnO to produce CH3OH [247]. On Cu/ZrO2/SiO2 catalysts, Fisher et al. proposed that Cu catalyzed H2 dissociation and the resulting H atoms are used for the CH3OH synthesis on ZrO2 [249]. Both Cu+ [205,246,248] and Cu0 [202] were also observed during the reaction and were proposed as the active sites for the overall reaction. Still other studies suggested that the reaction occurs at the interface of Cu particles and the metal oxides [2,254]. As before, theoretical calculations have provided additional insight into CH3OH synthesis reaction mechanism on model supported Cu catalysts 3.4.1.1 Cu/ZnO Ab inito molecular orbital (MO) and DFT calculations were carried out by Terumitsu and Kakumoto and Watanabe in order to understand the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism over Cu/ZnO catalyst [255,256]. The adsorption configurations of the potential intermediates, e.g. HCOO, H2CO, H3CO, HOCO, CO, HCO, HCOH and H2COH on Cu0, Cu+ and Zn+ were determined. By comparing the relative energies of the possible intermediates over the different sites, it was concluded that the direct CH3OH synthesis from CO2 proceeds via Path 1 on the Cu+ sites. Conversion of CO2 to CO via the RWGS reaction occurs at the Cu0 sites, and the CH3OH production from CO hydrogenation via Path 4 favors the Cu+ sites. The overall activity and selectivity to CH3OH production was predicted to be enhanced by increasing the number of Cu+ sites, as removing electrons from Cu sites increases the stability of HCOO and H2CO intermediates. According to the calculated atomic charge distribution on Cu/CuO and Cu/ZnO clusters, Cu+ is only located Cu–ZnO interface. Hence, Kakumoto et al. claimed that methanol synthesis occurs only at the interface between Cu and ZnO. 3.4.1.2 Cu/ZrO2 CH3OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation over the binary catalyst Cu/ZrO2 was investigated by Tang et al. [257] using DFT and KMC simulations. The interface was modeled by a two-layer Cu strip supported on the stepped ZrO2 ( 2 ¯ 12 ) surface ( Fig. 30). Two pathways were considered in their study, Path 1 and Path 3. CO2 was found to adsorb on ZrO2 sites, exhibiting a trident configuration with the C atom bound to the O and two O atoms binding to Zr4+ sites (Fig. 30), while H atoms prefers to Cu sites. In Path 1, CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH occurs on the ZrO2 surface and H atoms are provided by Cu sites. In Path 3, CO2 undergoes direct dissociation into CO at the Cu–ZrO2 interface edge sites. According to their calculations, the resulting CO molecules either desorb from the surface or hydrogenate to HCO and subsequently to ultimately CH3OH. To remove surface O atoms that result from CO2 dissociation, a barrierless hydrolysis reaction to produce OH and a kinetically slow coupling between OH and H to release H2O are expected. The KMC study using input from the DFT calculations showed that under typical experimental conditions Path 3 is favored path for CH3OH production. However, due to the strong O–Zr interaction, most of the interface sites are found to be occupied by O-containing intermediates and a low conversion rate of CO2 is predicted, though the selectivity to CH3OH is high. The removal of O atoms from the catalyst was found to be the rate-limiting step, which leads to the formation of O-rich Cu/ZrO2. Indeed, Cu+ has been observed experimentally during the reaction [246]. Accordingly, Hong and Liu also studied the reaction at the O-rich Cu/ZrO2 interface [258]. The energetics of CO2 hydrogenation along Path 1 and Path 3 were calculated using the same methodology. Unlike the calculated results for Cu/ZrO2, Path 1 was identified as the preferred pathway for CH3OH production at the O-rich interface [97]. The rate-limiting steps were found to be CO2 adsorption and H2CO hydrogenation, where the major surface species is HCOO. By blocking the active Zr sites with O atoms, CO production from CO2 dissociation via Path 3 is hindered. Changes in pathway for the O-rich surface could have a significant effect on the activity and selectivity for methanol synthesis. 3.4.1.3 Cu/Al2O3 Pan et al. studied the adsorption and activation of CO2 at the interface of Cu and Al2O3 using DFT calculations [259]. Cu/Al2O3 was modeled by a Cu dimer (Cu2) supported on both “dry” and partially hydroxlylated γ-Al2O3(110) surfaces. CO2 was found to adsorb at the Cu2/Al2O3(110) interface in a bent configuration, where C and one of the O atoms interact with Cu and the other O atom is bound to an Al3+ in alumina surface. The negatively charged CO2 indicates that the CO2 is activated on Cu2/Al2O3 catalysts. For a Cu4/Al2O3, DFT calculations by Wang et al. found that CO2 is also bound to the Cu cluster in a bent configuration. Hydrogenation utilized H atoms that are preferentially bound to the Cu–Al2O3 interface via interactions with both Cu and Al atoms [260]. The H atoms attack the C atom of CO2 to produce a monodentate HCOO ( Fig. 31), which then converts into bidentate HCOO easily. In contrast, the production of CO via intermediate HOCO was found to be unlikely. The presence of OH group on Cu4/Al2O3 surface lowers the stability of Cu4 relative to the case of a “dry” Al2O3 surface. However, the preferential reaction pathway remains the same, though the corresponding barrier is slightly higher than that for Cu4/Al2O3. Accordingly, Path 1 or Path 2 is likely to dominate the CH3OH synthesis at the Cu–Al2O3 interface, as HCOO is the main product for the first step of CO2 hydrogenation. 3.4.2 Ni/oxide The experimental study of CH3OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation over oxide supported Ni catalysts is limited because the selectivity towards CH3OH is low. Instead, methanation reaction is favored over the CO2 hydrogenation [261,262]. Recently, the effects of surface OH species on the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were studied by Pan et al. using DFT calculations [263]. The structure of the catalysts were modeled by a tetrahedral Ni4 cluster supported on both dry and hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(110) surface. The formations of HCOO and CO, which have been claimed to be the two important intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation on Ni surfaces, were explored in this study. Unlike the Cu/Al2O3 surface, the DFT calculations showed that both CO2 and H are only bound to the Ni sites on Ni4/Al2O3. However, the pathway for CO2 hydrogenation was found to be similar to that on Cu/Al2O3. Specifically, a bidentate HCOO intermediate on the dry Ni4/Al2O3 surface is energetically more favorable than CO production via the RWGS reaction ( Fig. 32) [263]. The presence of OH on the Al2O3 surface is able to alter the stability, the electronic structure of the supported Ni4 cluster, and the preferred pathway for CO2 hydrogenation. In presence of surface OH, the CO production was found to be more likely than formation of the HCOO intermediate (Fig. 32). In general, the calculations by Ge et al. demonstrate that hydroxylation of the Al2O3 support affects the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Regardless of the presence of surface OH, the reaction occurs only at the Ni sites, rather than the interface, which is different from other metal/metal oxide catalysts. Again, like the case of CH3OH decomposition, CH3OH synthesis on metals can be promoted by forming alloys, metal compounds and metal/oxide composite materials (Table 2). The additional components may be active themselves and directly participate in the reaction by catalyzing some of the elementary steps (ensemble effect). Or they may modify the electronic structure of the active metal sites and therefore affect CH3OH production indirectly (ligand effect). Both effects can cause the reaction mechanisms to change, which offer new possibilities to improve the activity and selectivity."
14,Theoretical studies of ethanol and higher alcohol,
15,Ethanol and higher alcohol decomposition,"4.1 Ethanol and higher alcohol decomposition With a higher energy density than CH3OH, ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and higher alcohols are attractive for energy applications as sustainable alternatives to gasoline, owing to the ease of their transportation and storage, higher values of lower heating value (LHV) compared to that of gasoline and the use of biomass for production [6, 264–266]. Broadly speaking, improved catalysts for the decompositions of CH3CH2OH and other higher alcohols are important as a source of hydrogen in a hydrogen economy based on renewable fuels. A good catalyst must be efficient in C–C, C–H and O–H bond dissociation, CO or C oxidation, and H–H association. This process is considerably more complex than CH3OH decomposition and higher temperatures are generally needed. To develop a better catalyst, a molecular level understanding of how the catalysts work is essential, which cannot be achieved by experiments alone due to the complexity of the kinetics. Therefore, theory can play a unique role in catalyst development. So far, only theoretical studies, mostly using DFT, have been reported which describe the details of the complex reaction network for ethanol and higher alcohols conversions. To date, extended metal surfaces have been considered as model systems to understand the role of metal in the dehydrogenation and oxidation of CH3CH2OH, both experimentally [267–277] and theoretically [269,274–287], including Pt, [279,281,282,285,286] Pd [22,279,284] and Rh [269,279,287–289] surfaces. The calculations have shown that the reaction pathway, energetics of intermediates and transition states, and therefore, the activity and selectivity for C2H5OH decomposition vary depending on the metals and the surface orientation. On open surfaces of Pt, i.e., Pt(100) and Pt(211), complete C2H5OH decomposition was found to prefer the reaction path CH3CH2OH→CH3CHO→CH3CO→CH2CO→CHCO→CO+C/CH x together with the formation of H2, where the C–C bond was cleaved via the strongly adsorbed intermediates (ketene, CH2CO or ketenyl, CHCO) [282]. In addition to the complete decomposition via CHCO, the close-packed Pt(111) surface also promoted the partial decomposition to form acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) as product [281,282,285,286]. This is very different from CH3OH on Pt(111) (Section 2.1.2), where a complete decomposition to CO was observed. These results demonstrate that the additional methyl ligand in CH3CH2OH plays a crucial role in determining the surface chemistry [290]. Similar effects of surface orientations were found for Pd surfaces, where the strong interaction between CH3CH2OH and Pd led to lower activation barriers for dehydrogenation on Pd(100) than on Pd(111) and Pd(110) [284]. Yet, CO, CH2 and CH4 were predicted to form on all three Pd surfaces [22]. Rh-based catalysts have been used for both CH3CH2OH electrooxidation and steam reforming. RhPt/SnO2 was reported recently as an extremely good catalyst for the electro-oxidation of CH3CH2OH [6]. Wherein, CH3CH2OH is converted to CO2 at low potential and Rh plays an essential role in breaking the C–C bond. In addition, Rh also appears to be the most suitable metal for CH3CH2OH steam reforming at reasonable operating temperatures [265]. DFT calculations by Choi and Liu proposed two reaction pathways running in parallel on Rh(111), as shown in Fig. 33 [287]. Both pathways lead to the production of C, CO and H2 products, in accordance with experiments [267,268] The calculations also showed that the formation of CHx is unlikely on Rh(111) due to the strong C–Rh interaction. According the energetics shown in Fig. 33, the calculations predicted several possible rate-limiting steps and associated surface species that might vary with temperature and pressure. KMC simulation allowed more insight into the reaction kinetics, showing that in the case of Rh(111), the reaction via ethoxy (CH3CH2O) pathway contributes more than the pathway involving hydroxyethyl (CH3CHOH). The major intermediates observed are CH3CH2O and CH [287]. A surface oxametallacycle (Rh–CH2CH2O–Rh) was also found to be an important intermediate, which leads to the formation of CHCO, the precursor for the C–C bond breaking. In addition, the DFT and KMC studies also indicated that the major obstacle for CH3CH2OH decomposition on the Rh(111) surface is not C–C bond cleavage, but the surface C contamination. The atomic C was found to be difficult to remove even at elevated temperatures and might deactivate the Rh catalyst [287]. The C contamination was also observed for the Rh(211) surface, though the reaction pathway is different [289]. The mechanistic understandings derived from calculations on pure metal surfaces can also be applied to catalyst optimization by modifying the metal with promoters to achieve the higher activity and selectivity. Similar to the case of CH3OH, one of the effective ways to improve catalyst performance is to form alloys [287,291]. For example, calculations have shown that forming a bimetallic alloy of Rh with Pt or Pd weakens the C–Rh interaction and makes C removal or C oxidation easier than Rh alone [287]. In this way, H2 production becomes more efficient from CH3CH2OH combustion on RhPt and RhPd alloys, which is consistent with the experimental observations [265,292–295]. The activity and selectivity was found to be further improved by forming the ternary catalysts, PtRh/SnO2 [6]. DFT calculations showed that the individual components of the PtRh/SnO2 catalyzed electrooxidation in a synergistic way ( Fig. 34): SnO2 contributes to the stability of the catalysts by providing strong interactions with Pt and Rh deposited on its surface. In addition, water strongly adsorbs on SnO2 surface, the Rh and Pt sites do not react with H2O to form M–OH (oxidation by water), but remain available for the reaction. Water interactions with SnO2 also provide the OH species to oxidize CO at the Rh sites. The Pt sites contribute to the dehydrogenation steps by binding H atoms. More importantly, Pt modifies the electronic structure of Rh so that it bonds moderately with the intermediates, especially CH2CH2O, which is the intermediate that is predicted to undergo C–C bond breaking. In this way, the ternary catalyst is able to convert CH3CH2OH to CO2 at low potentials, in agreement with experiment [6]. In fact, the synergy predicted from theory is able to well explain the experimental observations, showing that the binary systems (Rh/SnO2 and Pt/SnO2) are not as active as the ternary PtRh/SnO2 catalyst [264]. Similar synergistic effects in CH3CH2OH decomposition were also reported for Rh/CeO2 [296]. The theoretical studies on the decomposition of the higher alcohols, such as glycerol and furfuryl alcohol are very limited due to the tremendous computational cost needed to describe the reaction mechanism [297–300]. So far, the calculations have been carried out only on extended single metal surfaces, e.g. Rh(111), Pd(111) and Pt(111), and targeted only a few elementary steps that may be involved in the decomposition. Little is known about the overall reaction network."
16,Ethanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation,"4.2 Ethanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation CH3CH2OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is much less studied than that of CH3OH (Section 3) and no viable catalysts have been identified for the industrial application. The catalysts that have been studied include Rh-based catalysts, modified CH3OH synthesis catalysts, modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts and modified Mo-based catalysts, which so far have suffered low yield or low selectivity to CH3CH2OH [7]. In addition, currently, there is no generally accepted mechanism, although several have been proposed [7,9]. One mechanism involves CO formation via the RWGS reaction, followed by hydrogenation of CO to CH3CH2OH; an alternative involves the CO2 dissociation into C and O, which are then used as precursors to CH3CH2OH. Finally, CO2 is hydrogenated first to CH3OH, as demonstrated in Section 3, followed by CH3CH2OH formation from reactions between CH3OH, CO2 and H2. No theoretical study has been carried out so far to determine the complete pathway. The development of catalysts for ethanol synthesis is currently hindered by the lack of any definitive mechanistic information. Unlike CO2 conversion, systematic studies using DFT have been performed to understand the reaction network for conversion of CO and H2 to CH3CH2OH (2CO+4H2→CH3CH2OH+H2O), though they have mainly focused on simplified model systems. To understand the unique efficiency and selectivity of Rh-based catalysts that are observed experimentally, [9] Choi and Liu carried out DFT calculations and kinetic modeling for CH3CH2OH synthesis from CO and H2 [230]. The results showed that CH3CH2OH synthesis on Rh(111) starts from the formation of HCO, followed by subsequent hydrogenation reactions, C–O bond breaking and CO insertion. Within a micro-kinetic modeling scheme, three major products were found by this reaction pathway: CH4, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH. At experimental temperatures, the kinetic modeling ( Fig. 35) showed that ethanol production on Rh(111) is small, with CH4 being the main product. The rate-limiting step of the overall conversion was found to be the hydrogenation of CO to HCO species, while the selectivity to CH3CH2OH was controlled by methane formation and C–C bond formation between methyl species and CO. To achieve higher yield and selectivity for CH3CH2OH, Rh requires promoters, which should be able to suppress CH4 formation and/or boost C–C bond formation. Structure-sensitivity of Rh towards for CH3CH2OH formation was also observed by DFT calculations, showing markedly different barriers and intermediates on Rh(111) and Rh(211) surfaces [301]."
17,Summary and perspectives,"In the last few decades, theoretical studies have revolutionized our basic, fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis of CH3OH and higher alcohols by providing new insight into the atomistic details of numerous catalytic reactions. This insight has mainly been obtained by applying DFT in which the catalytic reactions are studied on well-defined model systems, pinpointing the details about adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and reaction of adsorbates. Huge efforts have been devoted to such study, resulting in enormous knowledge about the catalytic reactions. In particular, the combination of DFT and kinetic modeling has been successful in qualitative, in some cases, quantitative description of reaction mechanism and active sites for model catalysts. It has also been demonstrated that the insights gained from theory can build up the basis for the design and development of new and improved catalysts. According to the present report, the assembly of multifunctional catalysts can be an effective way to achieve high activity and selectivity for the complex reactions involved in alcohol chemistry. Using monofunctional (pure metal) catalysts e.g., pure metals, a volcano-like correlation is always expected between binding strengths of key intermediates and their catalytic activity. The best catalyst is located at the top of the volcano and usually exhibits a moderate binding, that is, high enough to dissociate reactants and weak enough to allow facile product formation and removal. Further catalyst development is limited by trying to compromise the two criteria operating in an opposite direction. Increasing the complexity to multi-component catalysts, e.g., metal/metal compound catalysts, offers new possibilities to “tune” the performance of a catalyst. A good multifunctional catalyst is not necessary to make the compromise; instead, it takes advantage of each component that is able to promote different elementary steps. The synergy between the different components can result in a system with a novel performance for catalysis applications. The theoretical studies discussed in this report have so far been generally limited to model systems, such as single crystal surfaces and well-defined cluster supported on single crystal surfaces. In contrast, the real catalysts are normally irregularly shaped particles, which are randomly distributed on high surface materials. This is the so-called “material gap”. Model systems in theoretical studies are in some cases too simplified to simulate the real catalysts effectively. For instance, real catalysts may contain particles that behave differently with size. Recently, a half-sphere model have been developed to model nanoparticles with sizes more typical of real catalysts using DFT (<5nm) [302,303] The model assumes that the nanoparticle is symmetric, which allows the reduction of the computational cost by only considering the atoms in half of the particle. Different from the slab model, relaxations were allowed in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions, being able to capture the surface contraction associated with the particle size and shape with affordable cost. These calculations show that the performance (activity and stability) of such a nanoparticle can vary significantly from that of the extended surface ( Fig. 36). In addition, the variation trend in catalytic performance from one system to the next can also change with the size (Fig. 36); yet it is common for DFT studies to use extended surfaces as models for such systems, even when looking for trends. Thus, theoretical predictions based on the calculations of extended surfaces may not necessarily be able to describe the real catalysts consisting of small nanoparticles. Modeling the catalysts in the size of real catalysts can be essential for theory to make meaningful guidance to experimental observations. Another significant issue that has to be addressed by modern computational studies of catalysis is the so-called “pressure gap” which refers to the 13 orders of magnitude difference in pressure between UHV based experiments and typical operating pressures inside a catalytic reactor. A key issue in the modeling of a catalyst under operating conditions is the high coverage structures formed at high gas pressures. Although many studies have shown a correspondence between adsorption structures formed at high pressure and under UHV conditions, this is not always the case. For example, the DFT calculations showed that the RuOx phase on TiO2(110) transformed under different conditions [304]. As shown in Fig. 37, depending on the temperatures and pressures, the system varies from RuO/TiO2(110), Ru2O4/TiO2(110), Ru3O6/TiO2(110) to monolayer RuO2/ TiO2(110). These phase changes are accompanied by changes in chemical activity of RuOx/TiO2(110) surfaces towards CO oxidation. Therefore, to model a catalytic reaction under relatively high pressure, the effects of pressure on the catalyst phase, catalyst structure, binding energy of an intermediate and the kinetics of each elementary step have to be addressed, which may cause significant differences from the case under UHV conditions. Finally, the ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to screen new catalysts on the basis of the fundamental understandings of reaction mechanism and active sites. In fact, theoretical screening for better catalysts using a single-scaling descriptor that captures the overall activity or selectivity from one system to the next has been developed. This approach has been very successful in predicting new catalysts for many important catalytic processes, e.g. oxygen reduction reaction, methanation reaction and water–gas shift reaction [29,305–307]. As seen in the examples discussed above, the chemistry of methanol and higher alcohol involves reaction networks that can be very complex with multiple reaction pathways, rate-limiting steps and products. Moreover, the best catalaysts for alcohol transformations are likely to be multicomponent systems where the reaction mechanism invlves elenmentary steps on different catalyst components. For the latter, it will be difficult to capture the variation in overall activity using just a single descriptor. According to our previous studies, [229] for such complex catalytic systems multiple descriptors may be involved. Some of the parameters may run cooperatively to control the activity and selectivity along the same reaction pathway; the others may operate sparately and affect different reaction pathways. It has been shown that all these key parameters important and have to be considered in catalyst screening [229]. To identity the key parameters that control the activity and selectivity, one of the effective ways is sensitivity analysis, which is perfomed based on the understanding of the overall reaction network obtained from extensive DFT calculations and KMC simulations. To summarize, theory, in particular DFT has become more and more important in catalysis. However, currently gaps exit between theory and real catalysis, and in many cases, e.g. presently reported alcohol chemistry, theoretical modeling is not capable to well describe the real catalysis. To strengthen the role of theory in understanding the mechanism and screening the better catalysts, more sophisticated methodology should be developed, allowing more efficient and accurate descriptions of reactions on more realistic catalysts under more realistic conditions."
