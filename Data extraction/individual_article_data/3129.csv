0,Introduction,"Vinyl alcohol-based polymers are strong competitors for conventional non-biodegradable polyolefin in several applications. They are water-soluble plastics widely used as protective coatings, emulsion paints, products for cosmetic and packaging industry, drug delivery systems, fibers and adhesives [1]. However, these polymers exhibit some drawbacks, such as poor water barrier and mechanical properties above all when the material is plasticized in the presence of water. Thus, to overcome these issues, the incorporation of several reinforcing fillers has been widely explored as a suitable approach to enhance the polymer performances. Indeed, vinyl alcohol-based polymers are multi-hydroxyl polymers with high polarity; thus, due to their elevated hydrogen bonding capacity and high chain flexibility, these polymers have shown good compatibility with most inorganic/organic fillers. In the recent literature, several papers deal with the production of vinyl alcohol-based nanocomposites exhibiting very good performances due to the loading of various fillers and suitable additives into the polymeric matrix [1–3]. Among the various fillers, several researchers have reported the great potential of cellulose nanofillers; thus, leading to the production of green nanocomposites [4]. Generally, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are promising candidates for manufacturing of enhanced nanocomposites, owing to their large specific surface area and shape, wide availability, biocompatibility and biodegradability, which may offer great opportunities to develop environmentally friendly structural composites [5,6]. Due to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between their hydroxyl groups, CNC have a great tendency for self-association, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional rigid percolating network within the matrix, which enhances the functional properties of nanocomposite films [5]. However, in some cases, these strong interactions can cause aggregation during the preparation of nanocomposites and limit the homogeneous dispersion and distribution of CNC; thus, reducing the mechanical properties of the resulting films [7]. To improve the dispersion of CNC filler, Aloui et al. [2] have explored the potentiality of using halloysite nanotubes as co-dispersing agent of CNC in PVA nanocomposites manufactured by solvent casting. Results highlighted that small amount of halloysite (3 wt%) allows a homogeneous dispersion of cellulosic nanocrystals, preventing the formation of surface wrinkles within the final system. Recently, 2D-filler GO has been investigated as a promising co-filler to avoid CNC aggregation and thus, to further improve the performance of various polymer matrices. Indeed, graphene has gained significant attention and has become one of the most widely investigated materials because of its superior material properties. Among all of them, graphene is ultrathin, with outstanding electrical and thermal properties and it is perfect for the realization of tailored bi-dimensional layered structures or three-dimensional segregated morphology, which exhibits excellent barrier properties against gas diffusion [8]. The synergistic use of these two reinforcing fillers, the 1D organic nanofiller CNC and the 2D nanofiller GO, to improve the final performance of the resulting nanocomposite, is particularly interesting and challenging. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanocomposite films [9] and CS-based hydrogels [10] loaded with cellulose nanocrystals and GO have been recently developed and studied. Particularly, Li et al. [9] report that the synergistic effect between CNC and GO through covalent CNC-GO or noncovalent CNC/GO bonds form strong interfacial interactions and lead to the development of PHBV-based composites exhibiting excellent crystallization ability, good mechanical and barrier properties and good antibacterial activity, all important features in the development of potential food packaging materials. As for vinyl alcohol-based polymers, to the best of our knowledge, only Xu et al. [11] have explored the preparation and studied the final properties of PVOH composite films loaded with CNC and GO. They report that PVOH/GO/CNC films prepared by a solution blending method exhibit excellent O2 barrier and mechanical properties ascribed to a homogeneous distribution of the two fillers. In the present paper, authors aim to improve water vapour barrier and mechanical properties of a very interesting vinyl alcohol-based polymer, namely a high amorphous vinyl alcohol (HAVOH), which is commercialized with the trade name of G-Polymer (Nippon-Goshei, Japan). This polymer is particularly interesting due to its ease for coating, excellent extrusion processability and very low oxygen permeability, which make this polymer very promising for applications as both coatings and films, including also the internal barrier in multilayer structures for food packaging. For this reason, the synergistic effect of CNC and GO on the functional properties of HAVOH-based nanocomposites have been thoroughly investigated. Nanocomposite films have been obtained by solvent-casting technique, dissolving and mixing the HAVOH polymer with the two fillers, using a water-based procedure, thus leading to the formation of a very promising material for sustainable packaging applications. However, it must be taken into account that GO is significantly sensitive to relative humidity because of its hydrophilic nature. As such, GO should be chemically or thermally reduced to prevent water vapour permeation through the nanocomposite films or coatings [12]. Among the methods used to reduce GO in rGO, in this paper, the authors have exploited the redox reactions between GO and mercaptans. Indeed, it was already proven that GO can be effectively reduced by mercapto groups in the acidic conditions even at room temperature [13,14] through the nucleophilic ring opening of oxirane on GO by alkylthio-moiety followed by addition of another alkylthio group, with the formation of disulphide groups. Moreover, the mercapto moieties added in the systems developed in this paper as (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane, can also be used as crosslinking agents for vinyl alcohol-based polymers due to the formation of disulphides bonds between mercapto-silanes anchored to different HAVOH macromolecules as well as to the formation of siloxane domains. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane as reducing agent for GO and crosslinking agent for HAVOH polymer as well as the synergistic effect of both reduced-GO and CNC as reinforcing fillers on the final properties of the obtained nanocomposites with potential applications in several sectors including, but not limiting to, food packaging as possible high-barrier internal layer of laminate structures."
1,Experimental section - material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials High amorphous polyvinyl alcohol [G-Polymer, GP, grade OKS-8049 with viscosity 4.6 mPa s (4%aq at 20 °C)] was purchased from the Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). 3-Mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Italy). Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were extracted from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC dimensions of 10–15 μm, Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and used as nanofillers. In details, CNC-based solution (0.5 mg mL−1) was prepared according to the procedure previously shown by some of the authors [2]. MCC was hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid (64 wt %) at 45 °C for 30 min. Centrifugation and dialysis were applied to remove the acid excess while a mixed bed ion-exchange resin (Dowex Marathon MR-3 hydrogen and hydroxide form) was added to the cellulose suspension for 48 h and then removed by filtration. The resultant cellulose-based aqueous suspension was sonicated (Vibracell 750) for 5 min at frequency of 20 kHz, in an ice-bath. Additionally, the CNC were neutralized by the addition of 1.0% (v/v) of 0.25 M NaOH. The final CNC water suspension had approximately 0.5 wt%, with a calculated hydrolysis yield of approximately 20%. The obtained CNC showed the typical acicular structure with dimensions ranging from 100 to 200 nm in length and 5–10 nm in width, as previously reported by Fortunati et al. [15]. Graphene oxide (GO) was obtained through oxidation of natural flake graphite according to a modification of the Hummers' method [16]. The as-prepared GO powder was exfoliated in deionized water (DI) by ultrasonication for 2 h to get a homogeneous GO aqueous suspension (0.1 mg mL−1). Structural analysis of the GO nanoparticles in terms of aspect ratio, which is about 200, and layer morphology which shows the presence of few nanoplatelets (AFM image is reported in SI), as well as chemical characterization were already presented in the previous papers of some of the authors [16,17]. Deionized water (DI) was used throughout the experiments. All the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and they were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of pristine HAVOH and mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH films,2.2 Preparation of pristine HAVOH and mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH films HAVOH films functionalized with (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (HAVOH/MS) have been prepared by using the following procedure: HAVOH powder was dissolved in water at room temperature to prepare a HAVOH aqueous solution (10% weight/weight); then MS (mass ratio HAVOH:MS equal to 10:1) was dissolved into the obtained solution under stirring for 1 h at 60 °C. The obtained solution was poured into a glass plate and air-dried to allow solvent removal. The as-formed membrane was peeled off and thermally treated at 120 °C for 1 h under vacuum before further characterizations. Pristine HAVOH and mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH films have been coded as HAVOH and HAVOH/MS respectively.
4,Preparation of HAVOH composites,"2.3 Preparation of HAVOH composites GO dispersion (0.1 mg mL−1) was mixed with mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH solution and stirred for 1 h at 60 °C and then sonicated for 2 h (cycle 0.5, amplitude 80%) by tip probe sonicator (Hielscher ultrasonics, Mod. Up200s). The resulting dispersion was poured into a glass plate and air-dried to allow solvent removal. The obtained film was peeled off and thermally treated at 120 °C for 1 h under vacuum before further characterization. Two different GO amounts, namely 0.5 and 1 wt% with respect to the polymer were used for the preparation of GO-based composites, coded as HAVOH/MS/05G and HAVOH/MS/1G. Binary composite films containing GO and cellulose nanocrystals were obtained by adding the CNC dispersion into the mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH/GO solution accordingly to the procedure previously described. Two different CNC amounts (i.e. 0,5 and 1%wt/wt) were loaded into the GO/mercaptosilane-functionalized HAVOH dispersion and the resulting binary composites were coded as HAVOH/MS/05G/05C, HAVOH/MS/05G/05C, HAVOH/MS/1G/05C and HAVOH/MS/1G/1C where the numerical figure refers to the percentage amount of the specific filler with respect to the HAVOH polymer. For the sake of comparison, HAVOH-based composites not containing the mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane have also been prepared and coded as HAVOH/1G and HAVOH/1G/1C."
5,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis,"2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR spectra were recorded at room temperature by using an infrared spectrometer (model Frontier Dual Ranger, PerkinElmer, USA) in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode from 650 to 4000 cm−1. Spectra were recorded at 4 cm−1 resolutions, and the reported spectra are the average of 64 scans."
6,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis,"2.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS of composite materials including also XAES spectra of C KVV were carried out by using a spectrometer Escalab 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd, East Grinstead, UK) equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα source and a 6-channeltron detector. A standard electromagnetic lens mode with analysis area of about 1 mm in diameter was used together with 20 eV pass energy of analyzer, ensuring the resolution in energy of 0.35 eV. To eliminate the sample charging, two low-energy flood sources (in-lens electron beam and external Ar ion beam) were used. Final calibration of binding energy (BE) scale was done by fixing the main component of C 1s peak (C-C bonds) at 284.6 eV. For some selected samples AES analyses in an Escalab MkII (VG Scientific Ltd, East Grinstead, UK) equipped with a LEG200 electron gun were also performed. Both, the energy and the current of the electron beam were kept very low (2–3 keV and 4–10 nA) to avoid any sample damage by electron beam. The C KVV spectra in AES and XAES modes were collected at 100 eV pass energy to increase the signal‐to‐noise ratio. All experimental data were processed by the software Avantage v.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peak fitting of XPS spectra has been performed by using Shirley background, Voigt peak-shape (mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian with variable ratio) and linked full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) for the same core level. Experimental C KVV spectra were smoothed at least for 11 times by moving average routine with a width of 1.2 eV. Afterwards, these spectra were differentiated by using a width of 7 data points for the determination of D parameter [18]."
7,Morphological analysis,"2.6 Morphological analysis The morphological analysis of pristine HAVOH and composites was performed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, SEM and TEM analysis respectively. In particular, a FEI Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope (ESEM) (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in high vacuum mode by using an accelerating voltage within 10–20 kV range and a secondary electron detector (Everhart-Thornley detector) were used for SEM analysis. Before the analysis, dried specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs by means of carbon adhesive disks and coated with a thin layer (about 10 nm thick) of an Au-Pd alloy by means of an Emitech K575 sputter coating system (Quorum Technologies LTD, Ashford, UK). TEM micrographs were obtained with a FEI Tecnai G12 Spirit-Twin transmission electron microscope with a LaB6 source and operating with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV, equipped with a bottom-mounted FEI Eagle-4k CCD camera (Eindhoven, the Netherlands). Thin sample slices were cryo-microtomated from samples embedded in epoxy resin."
8,Mechanical characterization,"2.7 Mechanical characterization Tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D882 by using an Lonost Test 1 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 250 N load cell, with a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. For statistical purpose data were averaged on 5 different tests."
9,Water permeability and contact angle measurements,"2.8 Water permeability and contact angle measurements Water vapour permeability was determined using the infrared sensor technique by means of a PermatranW3/31 (Mocon, Germany). Samples with a surface area of 5 cm2 were tested at 25 °C. Permeation tests were performed by setting the relative humidity at the downstream and upstream sides of the film to 0% and to 50% respectively. A flow rate of 100 mL/min of a nitrogen stream was used. Each test was carried out in duplicate. Contact angle measurements were carried out by using a DataPhysics OCA 20 apparatus. Distilled water was dropped onto HAVOH and HAVOH/MS/1G/1CNC sample, at least in 10 different sites, and the static contact angle was computed as the average value from the taken measurements."
10,Results and discussion,"To investigate the chemical interactions, which take place between the mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH matrix and GO and CNC fillers, FTIR/ATR spectra of pristine and HAVOH-based composites were collected and analysed for comparison. The spectra, normalized for the intensity of the invariant peak at 915 cm−1 assigned to the CH2 rocking vibration, are shown in Fig. 1 . Pristine HAVOH spectrum (black curve) highlights all major peaks related to hydroxyl and acetate groups. The large bands observed between 3550 and 3000 cm−1 are related to the OH stretching mode, ν(O–H) arising from the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds network of HAVOH matrix. The peaks at 2940 cm−1 and 2910 cm−1, 1425 cm−1 and 1329 cm−1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching mode of CH2 groups, ν(C–H), bending vibration of the CH2 groups, δ(C–H) and C–H deformation vibration, respectively. The peak at 1720 cm−1 is due to the stretching mode of C=O bond, ν(C=O) from acetate groups, whereas the peak at 1650 cm−1 is tentatively assigned to the presence of residual C=C terminal bonds and the presence of water [19,20]. The peak at 1141 cm−1 is assigned to ν(C-C) stretching vibrations of the polymeric chain in the crystalline phase and a further peak, around 1080 cm−1, is due to ν(C-C) stretching vibrations [21,22]. However, it is worth considering that HAVOH is highly hydrophilic and so in the region 3550 and 3200 cm−1, as well as at 1650 cm−1, adsorption bands ascribed to ν(OH) vibration stretching and ν(HOH) bending mode of adsorbed water molecules may also be present [23,24]. The mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH spectrum shows the two peaks at 2940 cm−1 and 2910 cm−1, corresponding to vibrations of the –CH2 groups present in the main macromolecular structure of HAVOH, exhibiting a profile slightly flatter than that of pristine HAVOH. This feature can be tentatively ascribed to the restrictions of vibration modes due to the presence of organosilane molecules anchored on the main macromolecules of HAVOH [25] (see red curve in Fig. 1, zoom a). All samples with mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH exhibit this spectroscopy feature; on the contrary, the sample HAVOH/1GO (not functionalized with mercapto-silane) exhibits the asymmetric C-H stretching peaks with shape and ratio intensity between the two constituent peaks somewhat comparable to those of pristine HAVOH. The HAVOH/1GO sample shows additional spectroscopy features comparable to those of pristine HAVOH identified in the other spectral regions as shown in Fig. 1. It is worth noting that for the sample HAVOH/MS it is not possible to detect the presence of –SH groups expected at ~2550 cm−1, which are well known to have a low molar absorptivity [26,27]. The appearance of two new peaks at 1260 cm−1 and 1180 cm−1 confirms the presence of mercapto-silane moieties anchored onto HAVOH macromolecules (see red curve in Fig. 1, zoom b). In details, they correspond, respectively, to Si-O bending [25] and likely to both –CH2CH3 rock vibration from –SiOCH2CH3 groups [28] and CH2C(OH)H rock vibration from SiO-CH2C(OH)H linked to the backbone segment bonded with Si-O. Furthermore, the decrease of absorbance intensity of the band in the region 3550 and 3000 cm−1, which is observed for the composite materials is ascribed to the decreased OH group concentration of HVOH and of GO (it is due to the reduction of GO in rGO for the action of mercapto moieties anchored to HAVOH macromolecules, as better shown hereafter) [29] and to the formation of SiOSi bonds from hydrolysis and condensation of silane moieties, respectively [30]. As it will be better analysed within the discussion of XPS results, the GO filler is chemically reduced to rGO during the preparation of the composites, due to the presence of mercapto groups and their redox reduction potential. This evidence is confirmed also by FTIR analysis; indeed, the band at 3448 cm−1 decreases dramatically, confirming that most functional groups containing oxygen atoms as hydroxyls and carboxylic acid in the GO are removed; whereas the spectroscopy features in the range between 950 and 1150 cm−1 significantly change as consequence of the simultaneous formation of siloxane domains. Moreover, the appearance of a shoulder peak at around 1625 cm−1 in all samples containing GO, and thus, containing rGO after the reduction reaction with mercapto groups (see blue and magenta curves in zoom b of Fig. 1), suggests the formation of sp2 lattice due to the chemical reduction of GO [31,32]. For completeness purpose, it is worth noting that the simultaneous presence of GO and CNC in the HAVOH/MS/1G/1C composite (magenta curve in Fig. 1) does not bring any significant modification of the main highlighted insights, preserving the GO reduction action of the mercaptosilane during the preparation of the composites (see zoom b of Fig. 1). Overall, it must be highlighted that the comprehensive rationalization of all FTIR results is particularly complex due to the GO reduction reaction and the simultaneous formation of several non-covalent and covalent interactions taking place in the composites between the mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH and the GO and CNC fillers. For this reason, FTIR results have been coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS), particularly, with the determination of superficial composition of all prepared composites, with the aim to evaluate the mercapto-silane functionalization of HAVOH, the chemical reduction of GO to rGO and to reveal the interactions taking place between the HAVOH polymer and the filler including GO, rGO and CNCs. As for the mercapto-silane functionalization of HAVOH polymer, Fig. 2 shows the C 1s spectra of pristine HAVOH and the mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH sample alongside with the S 2p spectrum. The C1s spectra can be deconvoluted by using three different components at binding energy (BE) of 284.6, 286.2 and 288.8 eV, corresponding to carbon atoms in different functional groups: C-C in alkan structure, C-O in alkoxy groups and C=O and -C(=O)O- in carboxyl groups, respectively [17]. These spectra show that due to the mercapto-silane functionalization, which realizes through the reaction between its ethoxy or alkoxy silane groups and the OH groups of HAVOH, the intensity of the C-O peak at 286.2 eV of COH groups is significantly reduced with respect to the C-C bond. In fact, the ratio of the C-O peak to the C-C peak is 0.45 for the HAVOH and 0.05 for the HAVOH/MS composite (see atomic concentrations of single elements/groups reported in the Supporting Information). The decrease of this ratio is ascribed to the formation of C-O-Si bonds which leads to the consequent decrease of –COH bonds. Moreover, it is mainly due to the significant increase of the C-C bonds concentration, due to the high amount of available -CH2- groups which come from propyl moieties of the mercapto silane. Furthermore, the S 2p spectrum of the sample HAVOH/MS can be deconvoluted in two peaks of spin-orbit splitting at BE of 163.5 eV (S 2p3/2) and 164.8 eV (S 2p1/2) ascribed to the mercapto groups [27]. The XPS data related to the silicon bonds (see the Supporting Information) confirm that the ethoxy groups of silane hydrolyse and/or condense to form -SiOC- bonds as well as siloxane structures that likely contribute to crosslink the HAVOH polymeric network. The XPS results confirm that the HAVOH is functionalized with silane moieties and the –SH groups are preserved during the functionalization reaction (see Scheme 1 ). As for the chemical reduction of GO by the mercapto groups of silane anchored to HAVOH macromolecules, Fig. 3 shows the C 1s XPS spectra of the HAVOH/1G and of the HAVOH/MS/1G composites alongside with the S 2p spectrum of this latter composite. The C 1s spectra again contain different components at BE of 284.6, 286.1–286.4 eV and 288.7 eV assigned to C=C/C-C in aromatic rings and alkane structure, CO (epoxy and alkoxy), C=O and -C(=O)O- groups, respectively [17], which arise from the simultaneous presence of HAVOH and carbonaceous filler, ie. GO and/or rGO. The quantification of deconvoluted peaks confirms the strong reduction of C-O component ascribed to the reaction of GO with mercapto groups [13]. In fact, the ratio of C-O (epoxy and alkoxy) to the C-C bonds changes from 0.73 for HAVOH/1G composite (which is higher than that of pristine HAVOH due to the higher content of oxygen atoms in the GO), to 0.08 for the sample HAVOH/MS/1G. This evidence confirms that the GO is chemically reduced during the preparation of composites and the mechanism is ascribed to the effect of mercapto groups and their redox reduction potential [13]. The S 2p XPS spectrum of the sample HAVOH/MS/1G exhibits two different peaks, which can be deconvoluted in spin–orbit doublet of S 2p3/2 at BE = 163.2 eV and S 2p1/2 at BE = 164.3 eV attributed to disulphides (or residual mercapto groups) and another doublet of S 2p3/2 at BE = 167.6 eV, S 2p1/2 at BE = 168.8 eV characteristic for sulphate groups. The presence of both disulphides and sulphate groups is related to the capability of mercapto groups to chemically reduce the GO filler. Some of the authors of this paper have already reported about this reduction mechanism [33] and this chemical reduction is also well documented in the paper by Fang et al. [13]. In details, the mechanism involves the nucleophilic ring opening of oxirane on GO by mercapto moiety of silanes anchored to HAVOH polymer, followed by the addition of another alkyl-thiol group. This addition brings to the formation of disulphide groups, which crosslink the polymeric structure (see Scheme 2 of GO reduction induced by mercapto groups). Moreover, the reduction mechanism of the hydroxyl group could be more complex, involving both radical and anionic processes. It is worth noting, that in the present paper the reduction temperature, i.e. 60 °C is comparable with the conditions explored by Fang et al. [12], equal to 60–80 °C. The driving force of the redox chemistry is the recovery of the conjugated plane of graphene. The oxidative activity of GO is moderate because disulphides are always present together with products of higher oxidation state, such as sulphate groups. Finally, it is worth noting (see data reported in Supporting Information) that the contents of O=C, O–C(O) groups seem not to be affected by the mercapto induced reduction, indicating that mercaptans are unable to reduce these relatively inert groups. The simultaneous presence of GO and CNC in the mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH does not bring any modification of the main findings discussed so far, and the mercapto moieties anchored to HAVOH macromolecules are always capable of reducing GO during the preparation of the composites. Thermal treatment at 120 °C of the formed films is particularly interesting since it contributes to a further reduction of the amount of C-O bonds. In fact, the ratio of C-C bonds to C-O bonds changes from 7 to 8.5, when the sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C is thermally treated. This confirms that the thermal treatment is able to stabilize the graphitic structure of rGO, further enhancing the GO reduction. A quantitative view of the most relevant differences in terms of chemical composition for several composites is shown in Fig. 4 , where the atomic ratios of C-C to C-O species and hydroxyl groups (or C-O) to the main C-C component are reported. The ratio of C-C to C-O species does not change significantly when GO or CNC are added to the HAVOH matrix, whereas it remarkably increases when HAVOH is modified through mercapto-silane functionalization, mainly due to the increase of C-C bonds of silane. The significant reduction of atomic ratio of C-C to C-O species with the addition of GO and CNC filler is due to the increment of OH groups and C-O bonds. In fact, it is possible to observe that the addition of 1 wt% of GO to HAVOH brings to a reduction of this ratio of about 30%, which is similar to the reduction observed for the addition of 1 wt% of GO to the HAVOH/MS matrix. Similar consideration may be done by evaluating the atomic ratio of OH groups to C-C bonds. By adding GO and CNC to the HAVOH polymer, it is possible to observe an increase in concentration of OH groups due to the hydroxyls of the fillers. To further confirm the reduction of GO to rGO by the mercapto moieties of silane, the method of the D parameter (the width of Auger peak C KVV), developed by Kaciulis et al. [18] and successfully applied for the investigation of GO reduction [34] and rGO in composite materials [35], was used. In all the samples containing the mercapto-silane (i.e. HAVOH/MS/1G/1C before and after thermal annealing at 120 °C, HAVOH/MS/1G and HAVOH/MS) the value of D parameter obtained from X-ray induced (XAES) C KVV spectra is in the range between 13.0 and 13.6 eV, being diamond-like and, thus, indicating the presence of graphene due to the chemical reduction of GO. A careful study has been carried out on the selected sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C, which has been analysed by multipoint AES, registering C KVV spectra induced by electron beam. More than 10 points on the sample surface resulted to be graphitic with D = 20.2–23.6 eV, whereas other 8 points gave values of D parameter lower than 20 eV. In the 10 graphitic points, the values of D parameter, along with diamond-like value of XAES measurement, indicates the presence of graphene. On the contrary, it is absent in other 8 points of composite with D < 20 eV; thus, indicating the presence of only polymer matrix or only GO. Typical C KVV spectra of the sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C obtained by using X-rays (before and after thermal annealing at 120 °C) and by electron beam are presented in Fig. 5 . It is clear from Fig. 5 (black curve), that in the observed sample, GO is already reduced before annealing, therefore both C KVV spectra are almost identical. The two AES spectra of this sample (Fig. 5 – black curve before annealing, red curve after annealing) are characteristic to the points of graphene (with graphitic value D = 21.4 eV) and of polymer matrix or residual GO (with intermediate values of D parameter < 20 eV). The results confirm that the chemical reduction of GO induced by mercapto-silane anchored to HAVOH macromolecules, is effective and the further reduction by thermal treatments at 120 °C does not bring any contribution to the formation of graphene islands on the 2D nanoplateles. Morphological characterization of pristine and HAVOH composites has been performed to assess the level of dispersion, the presence of aggregate and the distribution of the nanoparticles within the HAVOH matrix. SEM images of the fracture surfaces of HAVOH/MS/1G and HAVOH/MS/1G/1C composites are shown in Fig. 6 a and b. The samples show a coarse morphology with presence of rGO particles (range around 1micron) and additional smaller spherical particles likely ascribed to the formation of siloxane domains in the sample HAVOH/MS/1G and more numerous particles, slightly bigger and well evidenced into the sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C, ascribed to the aggregation of CNC filler [20]. In this latter sample, it is also possible to observe the presence of graphene platelets, which are orientated parallel to the casting surface and support CNC agglomerates. In Fig. 6c and d TEM images for the samples HAVOH/MS/1G and HAVOH/MS/1G/1C are shown: it can be clearly observed the lamellar structure of rGO and the acicular structure of nanocellulose particles. Thermogravimetric analysis has been carried out to assess the effect of both siloxane crosslinking and of the presence of GO and CNC nanoparticles on the thermal stability of the composites compared to pristine HAVOH (experimental and data are reported in the SI – Fig. S2). Due to the effect of silane functionalization and the presence of GO and CNC fillers, the two degradation processes for the composites (see SI - Table 8S) shift at higher temperatures; this may be ascribed to the stabilizing effect of filler to slow down the migration of degradation gases to/from the samples [36,37]. Mechanical characterization in tensile configuration has been carried out to analyse the effect of mercapto-silane functionalization and the presence of the fillers on macroscopic behaviour of HAVOH composites, compared to pristine HAVOH. Fillers loadings within polymer matrix, their dispersion and the interfacial interactions between 2D-1D filler and filler-polymer contribute to enhance the polymer's rigidity, hardness, modulus and toughness [2]. The stress−strain curves of composite films are reported in Fig. 7 , results from the tensile tests are gathered in Table 1 . The effect of siloxane crosslinking, originated from hydrolysis and condensation of SiOH groups of silane functionalization of HAVOH as well as from the disulphides bridges during GO reduction, leads to an embrittlement of the HAVOH matrix. The crosslinking reduces the macromolecules mobility, thus, leading to a decrease in toughness [38]. This can be highlighted by the increase of Young modulus of HAVOH/MS samples (3621.3 MPa) with respect to pristine HAVOH (2203.7 MPa) and by the reduction of the strain at failure from 33.7% to 25.1%, respectively. The addition of GO (i.e. 0.5 wt%) further reduces the strain to failure while holding constant the elastic modulus; the nanocrystals, instead, lead to a plasticization effect enhancing the strain to failure of about 15% compared to HAVOH/MS composite. A more relevant effect is found when the GO and CNC contents are increased up to 1 wt%: the addition of high amount of GO (1 wt%) brings about a significant increase of Young modulus with respect to pristine HAVOH and this effect is even more pronounced when GO is added in combination with high amount of CNC (1 wt%) which acts as plasticizer of the system. Indeed, the addition of 1 wt% GO realizes a rigid filler-like effect, which likely induces an increase of the filler−matrix interphase interaction and, consequently, an overall constraint of matrix chain mobility compared to pristine HAVOH. The addition of both 1 wt% GO and 1 wt% CNC induces a higher level of organization of HAVOH chains, probably due to a synergic effect of both GO and CNC in the HAVOH/MS/1G/1C sample. DMA results (experimental and data are reported in SI) highlight that the pristine HAVOH shows a peak at about 80 °C, ascribed to frictional energy dissipation due to internal macromolecular relaxation around the Tg, whereas the material functionalized with silane exhibits a smaller peak ascribed to the effect of chemical crosslinking occurring between the silane-functionalized HAVOH macromolecules. Moreover, the storage modulus of the several composites increases with the presence of fillers. However, at cellulose content of 2 and 0.5 wt%, the composites exhibit a significant reduction in the storage modulus, which can be ascribed to the effect of filler aggregation as well as to the lack of a percolating reinforcing network (see Fig. S3). Water vapour permeability (WVP) tests have been performed to evaluate the effect of mercapto-silane functionalization and the presence of GO and CNC fillers on the water barrier properties of the HAVOH composites. Pristine HAVOH polymer presents very good oxygen barrier properties but is particularly sensitive to water; thus, a reduction of water permeability is highly desirable. All the composites present lower water vapour permeation values, at different extent, than pristine HAVOH (Fig. 8 ). Water vapour permeability is affected by the filler content, its dispersion and its influence on the chain mobility. The mercapto-silane functionalization leads to the formation of more stable physical cross-links, due to the presence of siloxane domains and disulphides bridges inter- and intra- HAVOH macromolecules, which decreases the chain mobility and creates a more tortuous path for water diffusion. Due to this effect, water vapour permeability value of crosslinked HAVOH/MS composite results lower than corresponding pristine HAVOH value. Permeability data analysis shows that the presence of low amounts of both GO and CNC fillers (0.5%wt/wt) results in a negligible variation of the WVP, likely due to their inhomogeneous dispersion within the polymer matrix (as further confirmation of results related to mechanical properties). When GO is added at higher content (1%wt/wt), the resulting composites present lower WVP values than pristine HAVOH. This result can be explained by taking into account that, due to the presence of mercapto groups, GO is present in its reduced form, as previously discussed in XPS and FTIR analysis. As reported in literature [39], rGO exhibits a more hydrophobic behaviour since the reduction brings about a decrease of oxygen groups and, thus, the amount of water molecules, which can easily adsorb and diffuse through the interlayer spacing, reduces. This is clearly confirmed by the permeability results, since the WVP value of sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C, containing GO in its reduced form, is much lower than the corresponding HAVOH/1G/1C (not containing mercapto-silane functionalized HAVOH); thus, showing a more hydrophobic behaviour and a better water barrier performance. The highest WVP reduction (about 45%) with respect to pristine HAVOH is observed for the sample HAVOH/MS/1G/1C. The hydrophobic feature of this latter sample has been proved by contact angle measurement, which resulted much higher (~88.6°) than the corresponding value (36.4°) for the pristine HAVOH sample. Hence, the observed WVP decrease is likely due to various concurring effects: the crosslinking of HAVOH matrix, the presence of high amount of GO (1%wt) which, in its reduced form due to the reducing effect of mercapto groups, impart a hydrophobic behaviour to the composite and the presence of high amount of CNC (1 wt%), which can bind more diffusing water molecules. Cellulose–water interactions result in rearrangements of water molecules within the matrix, decreasing the plasticization effect of water and consequently favouring the barrier properties of the resulting material [40]."
11,Conclusions,"The synergistic reinforcing effect of a 1D filler (CNC) and of a 2D filler (GO), in combination with the effect of (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane agent, has been investigated in a high amorphous vinyl alcohol (HAVOH). It was found that the presence of mercapto silane has a twofold effect. Firstly, mercapto groups, due to their redox reduction potential, have the capability to chemically reduce the GO filler to rGO during the preparation of the HAVOH-based composites. Indeed, FTIR analysis reveals that many oxygen containing functional groups in GO have been removed. Moreover, also the analysis of the S 2p XPS spectrum of the sample HAVOH/MS/1G shows the presence of both disulphides and sulphate groups, which is related with the capability of mercapto groups to chemically reduce the GO filler. Secondly, the crosslinking effect of mercapto-silane into HAVOH structure has been highlighted. XPS data related to the silicon bonds confirm that ethoxy groups of silane hydrolyse and/or condense to form -SiOC- bonds as well as siloxane structures likely contributing to the formed polymeric network. The obtained data show that the reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic ring opening of oxirane on GO by mercapto moiety of silanes anchored to HAVOH polymer. The addition of alkyl-thiol groups leads to the formation of disulphides, which crosslink the polymeric structure. It is worth noting that the simultaneous presence of GO and CNC in mercapto-silane-functionalized HAVOH negligibly affects the GO reduction and the chemical crosslinking. SEM analysis shows the presence of a coarse morphology with presence of rGO particles and additional smaller spherical particles likely ascribed to the formation of siloxane domains. In the samples containing CNC fillers, numerous particles, slightly bigger and well evidenced show their aggregation. The lamellar structure of rGO and the acicular structure of nanocrystals can be clearly observed by TEM images. The TGA curves of composites are shifted toward higher temperatures as compared to pristine HAVOH; thus, showing a stabilizing effect due to the presence of the fillers. Results of tensile tests show that the effect of siloxane crosslinking leads to an embrittlement of the HAVOH matrix, which is avoided when rGO e CNC are dispersed within the composites. The crosslinking, indeed, reduces the macromolecules mobility thus, leading to a decrease in the toughness. Moreover, the addition of both 1 wt% GO and 1 wt% CNC induces a further organization of the HAVOH chains, due to the two filler synergy. Finally, it has been shown that all the composites present water vapour permeation values lower than pristine HAVOH. Particularly, the mercapto-silane functionalization leads to the formation of more stable physical cross-links, which decreases the chain mobility creating a more tortuous path for water diffusion. The highest WVP reduction of about 45% compared to pristine HAVOH is observed for HAVOH/MS/1G/1C sample and it is likely due to the occurrence of the crosslinking effect of HAVOH matrix, and the presence of a high amount of both rGO (i.e. 1%wt), which exhibits a more hydrophobic behaviour due to the decrease of oxygen groups and CNC (i.e. 1 wt%), which can bind more diffusing water molecules, thus, delaying them during permeation. Overall, the obtained results clearly evidence the effect of GO and CNC as reinforcing fillers on the final properties of the obtained nanocomposites, which could be potentially used in several applications."
