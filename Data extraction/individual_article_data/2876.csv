0,Introduction,"Graphene, a type of single-layer two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial made for the first time by “the micromechanical stripping method” in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov [1], is one of the most exciting fields of research, in particular now that the focus is on exploiting its applications. The excellent properties of graphene have attracted interests from all industries with great achievements in the preparation, functionalization and application of graphene. To date, there have been numerous investigations of graphene in fields such as supercapacitors [2–4], biological sensors [5–7], fuel cells [8–10], and thin film materials [11,12]. Whilst applications of graphene are often associated with small quantities in high value-added industries, there are also attempts to investigate the feasibility of incorporating graphene in cementitious materials [13–17] which are the most commonly used civil engineering and infrastructure materials owing to their abundant availability, satisfactory functionality including workability, mechanical properties and durability, and low cost. Bai [13,14] reported the incorporation of 0.1 wt% of graphene enhance the compressive strength by 16% and 2 wt% of graphene can reduce the electrical resistivity to 105 Ω mm (vs. 107 Ω mm without graphene). Wang [15] found the compressive and flexural strengths of cement composites with 0.06 wt% graphene nanoplates increased by 11.0% and 30.6% compared to pure cement. Ho [16] found 34.3% and 26.9% improvement in compressive and tensile strength with 0.07 wt% graphene at 28 d. Liu [17] reported 0.025 wt% graphene sheets increased the 7-d compressive strength by 14.9%, the flexural strength by 23.6% and direct tensile strength by 15.2%. Incorporating a tiny amount of graphene has the potential to drastically improve the functionality of cementitious materials, allowing less cementitious materials to be used thereby promoting sustainable development. However, cementitious materials are always used in very large quantities, therefore even a very low weight percentage could require very large amount of graphene to be added in, rendering the manufacturing of graphene modified cementitious materials too high for the application in civil industries. Hence it is necessary to consider graphene fabrication methods that uses graphite as graphene sources, such as micromechanical exfoliation [1], liquid-shear exfoliation [18–21] and redox processes [22,23]. Among these methods, redox process is the most commonly adopted approach, not only due to its high production rate, but also because the graphene oxides (GO) produced by redox process have abundant functional groups which make GO hydrophilic and weaken the van der Waals interactions between GO layers, thus, making GO easier to disperse in cement matrix than graphene. As a result, graphene oxide (GO) is employed in most graphene-modified cementitious materials and large enhancement of material properties by adding GO to cementitious material have been reported [24–27]. For example, Lv [28] reported that adding 0.03% GO by weight of cement to cement enhanced the tensile and flexural strengths by 78.6% and 60.7%, respectively, at 28 d. Li’s group also reported that 0.04% GO improved the tensile strength by 67% due to a reduction in secondary sorptivity [29]. Hu’s group reported a 126.6% improvement arising from the synergistic effect of microwave curing and GO doping [30]. However, GO suffers from some important drawbacks: the indeterminacy of the degree of oxidation can increase inhomogeneity of GO modified cementitious materials. Most importantly, the manufacturing process of GO generally requires a large amount of strong acids, which increases the cost of manufacture and might cause pollution. Liquid-shear exfoliation, which uses graphite as graphene source and has a high production rate of graphene to be 5.3 g per hour, is a promising candidate of manufacturing process for potential practical industrial application of graphene modified cementitious materials. Graphite can be considered as piled-up graphene layer structure based on accumulation and combination of van der Waals force with the layer spacing of 0.34 nm. Peeling graphite into a single layer of graphene requires overcoming the van der Waals attraction between adjacent layers. According to Lennard-Jones's theory, as a result of the van der Waals force is inverse proportion to the sixth power of the intermolecular distance [20,31]. Therefore, increasing the distance between the graphite layers can reduce the interlayer forces. When the interlayer spacing is about 0.5 nm, van der Waals forces approach zero, and this process can be realized by liquid infiltration. When the surface energy of the solvent matches that of graphene, the interaction between the solvent and graphene can balance and meet the energy required for peeling graphene [32,33]. During liquid-exfoliation, graphene layers originally stacked together in graphite are separated by shear force and few-layer graphene (2–5 layers) is produced. Exfoliated graphene sheets still have a strong tendency to aggregate, therefore surfactant and stabilizer such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [19], sodium cholate [34] and some polymers [33,35] are usually added to prevent aggregation. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a polymer with excellent water solubility and is commonly added to cementitious materials as a modifier to improve their workability and flexural strength [36–38]. When the water soluble PVA is added into cement, PVA can be evenly distributed in the cement matrix, and form a uniform distribution of polymer film. These films have a certain tensile strength and bridge between the cement plates, which can delay or inhibit the development of cracks [39–41]. Since the surface tension of PVA solution matches the surface energy of graphene, PVA has been demonstrated to have the ability of peeling graphite and stabilizing graphene in water during liquid shear exfoliation [21]. The functional groups in PVA are mainly hydroxyl, which is a hydrophilic group, and methyl, which is a hydrophobic group. The adsorption of methyl group on graphene prevents the agglomeration of graphene and helps the dispersion of grapheme [42–44]. Compared with other graphene stabilizer such as sodium cholate and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone [45], PVA are much cheaper and environmentally friendly. Besides the ability to disperse graphene, PVA can also serve as a strengthening and toughening material which improves the mechanical properties of cementitious material along with grapheme [46]. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, this research focuses on the preparation and effects of a novel graphene/PVA modified cementitious material by using PVA-stabilized graphene aqueous dispersion produced by liquid-exfoliation to replace water during cement casting. To gain a deeper understanding of the PVA-assisted graphene dispersion mechanism, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to reveal the dispersion mechanism at a molecular scale."
1,Experimental and numerical simulation techniques,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (Mw = 31,000–50,000, 87–89% hydrolyzed) and graphite flakes were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. P. II42.5R Portland cement was purchased from Green Island (Yunfu) Company Limited."
3,Preparation of Graphene/PVA dispersion,"2.2 Preparation of Graphene/PVA dispersion First, 3.6% by weight PVA was dissolved in 95 °C deionized water with magnetic stirring. Graphite flakes (5% by weight) were added to the solution and blended with a commercial high-shear blender (Philips HR2096) at 21,000 rpm. The turbulence-induced shear exfoliation caused the graphite planes to slip relative to each other until full exfoliation was achieved, resulting in free-floating graphene. The graphene was subsequently bound to the PVA in the solution, preventing the reaggregation of graphene into graphite. The solution was typically blended for 30 min until a dispersion of graphene and graphite was formed. The dispersion was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to remove large graphite and graphene particles and to obtain a pure graphene dispersion. The dispersion was then stored at room temperature until further use for the production of graphene/PVA composite-modified cementitious material."
4,Fabrication of graphene/PVA composite-modified cement,"2.3 Fabrication of graphene/PVA composite-modified cement The cementitious composite was prepared by mixing cement and a certain amount of graphene/PVA dispersion. The water to cement ratio was 0.5, and the PVA to cement ratio was kept constant at 1.8% (according to the literature [47], the PVA concentration should be less than 2% by weight of cement). Graphene concentrations were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 g/L in water. Thus, the graphene to cement ratio by weight were 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07%, respectively. The highest concentration of graphene (1.4 mg/mL) could be fully dispersed in the PVA solution, while the lower concentration of graphene is diluted by adding the same concentration of PVA solution. Therefore, graphene could be completely dispersed. Plain cement without any graphene or PVA was prepared as a control. 300 mL water or graphene/PVA dispersion was added into the beaker, and then the corresponding amount cement was added in. The beaker was placed on a fixed frame, rising to a fixed position, followed by the boot of the mixer. After 120 s stirring at 150 rpm and 120 s stirring at 300 rpm, the mixes were obtained. For each stirring phase, the time error was controlled within 1 s. The mixing time and the operation process are strictly controlled to ensure that the formation of air voids the gas content is consistent. The obtained mixes were cast into molds with sizes of 20 × 20 × 20 mm3 and 10 × 10 × 40 mm3, followed by vibration to ensure good compaction. For parallel experimentation and error reduction, six samples were prepared at each measuring point. Then, the molds were removed after 24 h, and the samples continued to be cured under standard curing conditions (20 ± 2 °C and 95% relative humidity) until testing."
5,Characterization of graphene/PVA dispersion,"2.4 Characterization of graphene/PVA dispersion To evaluate the concentration of graphene in the dispersion, vacuum filtration and TGA were carried out. First, 20 mL of the dispersion was vacuum-filtrated by using alumina membranes with a pore size of 0.2 μm. The obtained films were subsequently rinsed with deionized water several times to remove PVA. The films were dried at 75 °C under vacuum for 48 h and then weighed. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409PC thermogravimetric analyzer. To evaluate the concentration of graphene in the dispersions and correlate it with absorbance, UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrometer. The morphologies of graphene were investigated using a FEI-talos 200 kV field-emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM). Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope."
6,Properties and microstructure of graphene/PVA composite-modified cement,"2.5 Properties and microstructure of graphene/PVA composite-modified cement The workability of the cement paste was evaluated by the mini-slump test on the basis of ASTM C1437-15. Compressive strengths were determined according to ASTM C349-14 with a pressure increasing rate of 2400 ± 200 N/s. Flexural strengths were identified from the three-point flexural test according to ASTM C348-14 with a pressure increasing rate of 50 ± 10 N/s. Thermal conductivity tests were performed on a NETZSCH HFM 436/3/1E thermal conductivity analyzer based on ASTM C177-13. For each series, six samples were tested, and the average was taken. The results were evaluated according to the standard deviation. The morphology and microstructure of the fracture surface of graphene/PVA composite-modified cementitious material were examined by a ZEISS Gemini SEM 300 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS)."
7,Molecular dynamics simulation of the stabilization effect of PVA,"2.6 Molecular dynamics simulation of the stabilization effect of PVA Simulations of adsorption of PVA chains on graphene surfaces and PVA-assisted dispersion of graphene in water were conducted using the LAMMPS software package [48]. The visualization of the simulation data was realized by OVITO [49]. Throughout the simulations, periodic boundary conditions in cubic simulation boxes with a lateral length of 5 nm were adopted. To simulate aqueous solutions, water molecules were randomly dispersed in the simulation box to reach the desired bulk phase density (~1.0 g/cm3). The interatomic interactions were described by the consistent-valence force field (CVFF) [50]. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by the particle mesh Ewald method with a real-space cutoff of 10.0 Å and a tolerance of 10−5. Before dynamic simulations, geometric optimizations were conducted to reach a local energy minimum. Dynamic simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble (NVT) using the Nose-Hoover thermostat to maintain a constant temperature of 300 K. The time step used for integrating Newton’s equation was 0.1 fs, and each simulation was run for 2 ns to reach equilibrium."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Preparation of graphene/PVA dispersion,"3.1 Preparation of graphene/PVA dispersion The concentration of graphene in the resulting PVA dispersion was measured using TGA, vacuum filtration and UV–Vis absorbance measurements. Fig. 1 presents the TGA curves of the graphene/PVA dispersion. As can been seen, two steps of weight loss can be observed in the TG curve, corresponding to the two peaks in the DTG curve, which respectively represent the water heat absorption and evaporation at 100 °C and the decomposition of PVA from about 200 °C to 250 °C. Eventually, the TG curve was stable at 0.1%, indicating that the graphene concentration in the dispersion was 0.1%, which was equal to 1 g/L. The dispersion was filtered by vacuum and rinsed with ethanol and hot water for several times to remove PVA. Then the weight of graphene was weighed by an analytical balance after drying, which was consistent with the TGA results. The net output of graphene was calculated to be 20 mg if 1 g of graphite is used by using the liquid shear exfoliation method. An important advantage of PVA is that it functions as a stabilizer, preventing graphene aggregation by its adsorption on graphene surfaces. The insert of Fig. 2 shows pictures of a dispersion that is freshly prepared and allowed to sit for 6 h, 12 h, 7 d, 14 d and 28 d, respectively. As desired, no difference can be found from the pictures indicating no agglomeration even after long durations. Fig. 2 shows the measured absorbance relative to the concentration of graphene/PVA dispersions. The absorbance of the dispersion increased linearly with increasing graphene concentration, with an absorbance coefficient of 0.615 mg/(mL·m). The linear relationship also suggests the stability of graphene dispersion in PVA. Based on the Lambert-Beer law, the graphene concentration can be determined from absorbance using Eq. (1), without having to weigh graphene by TGA or vacuum filtration every time. (1) A = 0.615 C + 0.03484 where A was the absorbance and C was the concentration of the solution. One of the major drawbacks of GO in the cementitious materials was that the carboxyl groups in GO were inclined to form complexation with calcium ions in pore solution [51,52] leading to the aggregation of GO. To check that no graphene aggregation is generated in alkaline cement matrix during the hydration process, Fig. 3 compares the dispersion conditions of graphene/PVA in water, in saturated Ca(OH)2 solution and simulated pore solution with a pH value of 13.5 (0.20% Ca(OH)2, 1% KOH, 2.45% NaOH and 96.35% D.I. water). No agglomeration was observed in these three solutions by visual inspection, indicating graphene/PVA remaining dispersed uniformly in alkaline cement pore solution. The quality of the obtained graphene was evaluated by TEM characterization and Raman spectroscopy. TEM characterization was conducted on PVA-free graphene nanosheets which were extracted by drop-casting ethanol-diluted dispersions onto copper grids and vacuum-drying at 60 °C for 12 h. Bright-field and energy-filtered TEM images were taken at random locations across the grids. A few-layers of graphene sheets can be observed in Fig. 4 a and b. The images of the sheet edges indicate that the sheets are two to five layers thick. The copper grid can be observed beneath, indicating the presence of only a limited number of stacked graphene sheet layers. According to the corresponding SAED patterns in the inset of Fig. 4b, the sheets were crystalline, indicating high- quality grapheme [53,54]. Raman spectroscopy was utilized to characterize the defects of the exfoliated graphene. In Fig. 5 , representative Raman spectra of graphite and the exfoliated graphene are compared. A small D band (~1350 cm−1) [55] can be observed in the graphene spectrum with an ID/IG ratio of 0.32, indicating that the exfoliation process induced few defects at the graphene edges. In addition, the 2D band (~2700 cm−1) [56] represented the characteristic peak of graphene with few layers, which was in accordance with the TEM results. The equivalent sheet size was estimated to be 0.1 μm2, according to the following equation (Eq. (2)), [55,57,58], (2) L = 0.094 I D / I G GNS - I D / I G Graphite where L is expressed in micrometers with the estimated error to be ~20%. Assuming the parent graphite is free of defect, the contribution of D peak is negligible as compared to G peak for graphite. As evident from the D and G peaks, the ID/IG value is around 0.32 and the estimated mean length value of the prepared graphene sheet is found to be ~0.3 μm. Based on these characterizations, high quality graphene can be produced by high-shear exfoliation with the assistance of PVA."
10,MD simulation of the mechanism of PVA assisted dispersion of graphene,"3.2 MD simulation of the mechanism of PVA assisted dispersion of graphene The above experimental results have shown that graphene can disperse stably in PVA aqueous solution. Although MD cannot obtain the exact value of the improvement rate of PVA on the dispersion of graphene at the macro level, it can elucidate the mechanism of improving the dispersion of graphene at the micro level. In order to provide complimentary information on the role that PVA plays in stabilizing graphene dispersion, a series of MD simulations were performed to provide detailed understanding at a molecular level. Firstly, adsorption of a single chain of PVA (N = 20) from the aqueous phase onto graphene sheet was simulated. The graphene sheet was modeled as a square in the x-y plane with a lateral length of 2.8 nm2. Since the simulated graphene sheet has limited size, the dangling bonds were saturated with hydrogen atoms. Geometry optimization was first performed to relax the system to a local energy minimum. Afterwards, the position of the graphene sheet was fixed and dynamic simulation was performed until reaching equilibrium. Fig. 6 a displays the time evolution of the distance between the center-of-mass of the PVA chain and the graphene sheet. This distance decreased rapidly and stabilized after 0.8 ns to reach a final distance of 0.42 nm. This distance is slightly larger than the interlayer distance of graphite (0.34 nm), which means graphene can be stabilized by PVA in water without aggregation. Fig. 6b and c show snapshots of PVA absorption onto graphene surface, which reflects the time evolution of PVA motion towards the graphene surface. Initially, the PVA chain and the graphene sheet are separately solvated in water. When adsorption starts, the PVA chain gradually approaches the graphene surface and attaches itself to the graphene surface. At 2 ns, the PVA chain is completely absorbed on the graphene surface. These simulation results show that even though graphene is hydrophobic, water does not hinder PVA absorbance onto graphene. In the second step of MD simulation, the possibility of graphene aggregation after shear mixing was considered. Suppose that graphene sheets have already been exfoliated from graphite. This situation can be modeled with two graphene sheets placed separately in water. As shown in Fig. 6e and f, the two graphene sheets that were initially separated would aggregate spontaneously in water. This result is consistent with observations of poor graphene dispersion in water by others [59,60]. From the time evolution of center-of-mass distance between the top and bottom graphene sheets (Fig. 6d), it can be seen that the distance between the two graphene sheets varies little with time after 0.8 ns, indicating an equilibrium state. The equilibrium distance between the two graphene sheets was 0.34 nm, which is the interlayer distance of graphite. To study the influence of PVA on the dispersion of graphene sheets in water, a model with a PVA chain (N = 20) placed between two graphene sheets was built. The time evolution of center-of-mass distance of the PVA chain from the top graphene sheet and between the top graphene sheet to the bottom graphene sheet is shown in Fig. 6g, with Fig. 6h and i showing snapshots at 0 ns and 2 ns. It can be seen from Fig. 6g that after 0.8 ns, the two distances remain stable, indicating a geometric equilibrium of the system. The equilibrium distance between the two graphene sheets is 0.75 nm, while the distance from PVA to the bottom graphene sheet is 0.37 nm. From Fig. 6h and i, it can be observed that due to presence of the PVA chain, the top graphene sheet cannot attach to the bottom graphene sheet. This result confirms that the adsorption of PVA onto the graphene surface can prevent aggregation of graphene in water."
11,Properties of graphene/PVA synergistically-modified cement,"3.3 Properties of graphene/PVA synergistically-modified cement The cement specimens were cast with graphene/PVA dispersion instead of water without any further treatment. Fig. 7 plots workability values of the freshly mixed paste, as determined by the slump test. The results indicate that compared with those of plain cement, the workability of cement pastes with graphene concentrations of 0 (which means PVA only), 0.2 g/L, 0.8 g/L, and 1.4 g/L in water, all with 1.8% PVA by weight of cement. increased by 5.2% and 4.2% and decreased by 1.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Previous researches by others have shown that PVA modified cementitious materials improve workability of plain cement [47,61]. This was due to the high surface activation energy of the water-soluble polymer which increased viscosity of the aqueous phase in the modified cementitious materials. On the other hand, adding graphene into cementitious materials may cause its workability to decrease due to the relatively large specific surface area of the nano-carbon material graphene, thus more water was required [62–64]. The two opposing influences lead to the trend of increasing and then decreasing workability with increasing amount of graphene. Nevertheless, even with a small reduction, the workability values of graphene modified cement pastes were all adequate for practical applications. Figs. 8 and 9 compare compressive and flexural strengths of cement pastes with different graphene concentrations. The dot lines represented the mechanical behaviors of plain cement at 28 d. The compressive strength of the cement was measured on specimens with dimensions of 20 × 20 × 20 mm3. The flexural strength of cement was measured by three-point bending of square bars with dimensions of 10 × 10 × 40 mm3. As shown in the figures, compared with plain cement, pure PVA modified cement (Cg = 0) had little effect on the compressive strength (0.8% reduction) but increased the flexural strength by 36.2%. The high slump flow of the PVA modified sample which is one of the reasons the pure PVA modified cement expressed a lower compressive strength that pure cement. Meanwhile, the formation of hydrogen bond between PVA polymer and cement particles resulted in the enhancement in the flexural strength [47]. The synergistic effects of PVA/graphene can be clearly demonstrated by increases in mechanical properties of PVA/graphene modified cement over those with PVA only. At a graphene concentration of 1.4 g/L in water, the compressive strength of cement increased by 71.1%, 68.6% and 66.9% after 7 d, 14 d and 28 d of curing, compared with a specimen with 1.8% PVA by weight of cement but no graphene, respectively. The flexural strength of cement containing 1.4 g/L graphene together with 1.8 wt% PVA was 106.5% higher than that of plain cement, compared to an increase of 36.2% by PVA alone. The effect of graphene concentration on thermal conductivity is presented in Fig. 10 . In comparison to that of the specimen without graphene, the thermal conductivity coefficient of graphene-containing specimens reached a maximum enhancement of 75.8%, compared to a value of 2.4% with PVA only (Cg = 0). The improvement of thermal conductivity of composite cementitious material system by incorporating thermal conductivity filler graphene followed the combined enhancement mechanism of the overall thermoelastic coefficient of composite system. The thermal conductivity coefficient gradually increased with the increase of graphene content, which can be explained by thermal vibration transmission [65]. Since the content of graphene in cementitious materials was extremely low, it conformed to the Maxwell model of composite thermal conductivity [65]. Graphene was evenly dispersed in cement-based materials without interacting with each other. The thermal conductivity of the composite λc followed the Maxwell equation (Eq. (3)), (3) λ c = λ 1 λ 1 + 2 λ 1 + 2 V 2 λ 2 - λ 1 λ 1 + 2 λ 1 - 2 V 2 λ 2 - λ 1 where, λ1 and λ2 were the thermal conductivity of continuous matrix phase and dispersed particles phase respectively, in this case, were the thermal conductivity of PVA modified cement matrix and graphene respectively, and V2 was the volume percentage of graphene. Due to the extremely low density (2.2 g/m3 for single layer graphene) and the high thermal conductivity (3500–5000 W/m-K) of graphene, the addition of a small amount of graphene (0.07% weight percent of cement) can greatly improve the thermal conductivity of composites (75.8% enhancement), which also indicated that graphene was well dispersed in the cement matrix and occupied a large volume ratio. The properties of hydrated cement depend on the characteristics of its microstructure. SEM images at different magnifications of the crystal morphology in plain cement and modified cement after 7 d of curing are shown in Fig. 11 . On the fracture surface of plain cement, needle-shaped crystals and flocculation structures can be seen. These structures are those of cement hydration products ettringite and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel, respectively [66,67]. Distinctly different morphology can be observed when graphene was introduced into the cement. The size and shape of the pores of well-dispersed cement and the crystalline hydration products were completely different. With graphene in cement, clusters of rod-like ettringite crystals and granular C-S-H can be observed. The shape of ettringite changed from a needle to a rod, indicating that the incorporation of graphene into cement promoted the hydration process. PVA established a three-dimensional spatial structure in the cement and tended to form a continuous membrane in the hydrated cement [68]. Compared with plain cement paste, the graphene/PVA synergistically-modified cement paste was well decentralized, which was evaluated by EDS characterization (as shown in Fig. 12 ). This result indicates that with the assistance of PVA, graphene dispersed uniformly in cement paste and functioned as a nucleation-inducing agent. In the cement hydration stage, as the amount of water decreased, PVA was gradually restricted in capillary pores, forming a gel membrane on the surface of the hydrated cement. The membrane wrapped the hydrated cement gel, the unhydrated cement particles and graphene together to form a three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the cement, especially its flexural strength. Based on the above macro performance and micro analysis, it can be obtained by promoting the hydration process of cement, affecting the size, shape and distribution of hydration products, and changing the internal structure after hydration from a microscopic perspective, PVA together with graphene fundamentally improved the mechanical strength of cementitious composites and therefore can greatly extend their service life. Owing to the well-dispersed graphene, the thermal conductivity was increased, which would improve the thermal conduction loop [65] and help to accelerate the diffusion of cement hydration heat thus reducing the temperature difference inside and outside of cement leading to reduced thermal cracking."
12,Conclusions,"This paper has presented an experimental investigation of a new low-cost dispersion method of graphene in water which is suitable for large-scale practical industrial applications of making cementitious materials. The results indicate that using water-soluble PVA as a solute of the liquid phase exfoliation solution and stabilizer, commercial graphite flakes can be exfoliated into low number layer graphene which can stably disperse in water in a one-step combined solution. The experimental results have been supplemented by detailed MD simulation to confirm that there was no graphene aggregation in water when PVA was the solute. The graphene/PVA dispersion can directly substitute for water in the cement casting process, making high quantity practical applications feasible. With the assistance of PVA, graphene flakes dispersed uniformly in the cement paste. During the hydration stage, as the amount of water decreased, PVA was gradually restricted in the capillary pores, forming a gel membrane on the surface of the hydrated cement. The membrane wrapped the hydrated cement gel, the unhydrated cement particles and graphene flakes together to form a three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the cement, especially its flexural strength. Compared to cement with 1.8% PVA by weight, the modified cement with graphene and PVA has increases of 71.1%, 106.5% and 75.8% in compressive strength, flexural strength and thermal conductivity respectively. The corresponding values are 0.8%, 36.2% and 2.4% respectively when the cement is modified by 1.8% PVA only. This strongly demonstrates the synergistic effects of graphene/PVA in improving cement properties. The graphene processing approach of this paper is feasible to scale up the production of graphene/PVA concrete, providing a new method of synergistic modification of cementitious materials for practical application of graphene in in civil engineering."
