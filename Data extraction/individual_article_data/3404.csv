0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a clean and renewable energy source. Many environmental regulations have brought about technological advances in hydrogen utilization such as fuel cell [1–3]. Catalytic reforming technologies have been widely investigated as primary processes for converting hydrocarbons or alcohols into hydrogen [4–17]. Among various reforming technologies, steam reforming has been recognized as a feasible process for hydrogen production from methane. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is mainly composed of methane, can serve as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure in modern cities may become more widespread in the future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential reformers in fuel cell applications. Although ruthenium- and rhodium-based catalysts exhibit a superior catalytic performance compared to other transition metal-based catalysts, nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in the commercial steam reforming processes due to their low cost and relatively high intrinsic catalytic activity. However, nickel-based catalysts exhibit poor resistance toward carbon deposition reaction, which can cause severe catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming reaction [18,19]. To overcome this problem, conventional steam reforming process requires high reaction temperature (>800°C), high reaction pressure (20–40bar), and high steam to methane ratio (≈3) [19,20]. Undoubtedly, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for on-site hydrogen production due to safety problems. Many efforts have been made to increase the stability of nickel-based catalysts in the steam reforming reactions [21–23]. In particular, it has been reported that nickel catalysts finely dispersed on the surface of mesoporous supports exhibited a strong resistance toward catalyst deactivation during the reforming reactions [22–25]. In the previous works [22,24], it has also been reported that mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts prepared by a single-step non-ionic surfactant-templating method exhibited a better catalytic performance than nickel catalyst supported on commercial non-porous alumina or on mesoporous alumina. However, it is expected that interaction between nickel species and alumina in the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalyst might be strongly affected by calcination temperature. In this work, therefore, mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts prepared by a non-ionic surfactant-templating method were calcined at various temperatures for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of calcination temperature of nickel–alumina catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity for steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mesoporous nickel–alumina catalyst was prepared by a single-step non-ionic surfactant-templating method, according to the similar methods reported in the literatures [22–24]. 12g of non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic P-123, BASF) was dissolved in 100ml of 2-butanol (Sigma–Aldrich) at room temperature under constant stirring (Solution A). 2.15g of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 50ml of 2-butanol, and then it was slowly added into Solution A (Solution B). 10.4g of aluminum precursor (aluminum sec-butoxide, Sigma–Aldrich) was separately dissolved in 20ml of 2-butanol at room temperature under constant stirring (Solution C). After slowly adding Solution C into Solution B, the resulting solution was stirred for 3h (Solution D). Another solution containing 1.52ml of distilled water was diluted with 30ml of 2-butanol (Solution E). A green semi-solid solution was formed within a few seconds upon adding Solution E into Solution D. After stirring the semi-solid solution for 2h, it was maintained at room temperature for 3 days. A solid obtained from green semi-solid solution by centrifugation was successively washed with ethanol and distilled water. The solid product was dried overnight at 100°C. The resulting powder was calcined at various temperatures for 5h to yield the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalyst. The prepared nickel–alumina catalysts were denoted as Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000), where X represents the calcination temperature in Celsius degree. Ni/Al ratio in the Ni–A-NS catalysts was fixed at 0.17 in all cases."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Crystalline structures of Ni–A-NS catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.541Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to examine the reducibility of Ni–A-NS catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of reduced Ni–A-NS catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen and argon at 700°C for 3h. Nickel dispersion and nickel surface area were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom and that cross-sectional area of atomic nickel is 6.49×10−20 m2/Ni-atom. The amount of carbon deposited on the used Ni–A-NS catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 =4.6:0.4:10:30, and total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000ml/hg. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas were calculated according to the following equations on the basis of carbon balance: (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = 1 − F C H 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F C H 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in × 100 (2) Hydrogen composition in dry gas ( % ) = F H 2 , out F H 2 , out + F C H 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out + F CO , out + F E 2 , out × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystalline structure of the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts,"3.1 Crystalline structure of the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts. It is interesting to note that bulk nickel oxide species were not observed in all the catalysts. This indicates that nickel oxide species were finely dispersed in the Ni–A-NS catalysts, by forming small nickel particles that were under the detection limit of XRD measurements. Moreover, (440) diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 shifted to a low diffraction angle in all the catalysts. This is because finely dispersed nickel oxide species in the Ni–A-NS catalysts were readily incorporated into the lattice of γ-Al2O3 during the impregnation and calcination steps, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate phase [24,26]. It is reported that phase transformation of transition alumina occurs from γ→δ→θ→α within temperature of 500–1300°C [27]. However, it is noteworthy that no significant changes in crystalline structure of Ni–A-NS catalysts were observed at temperature ranging from 700 to 1000°C. This might be understood by the fact that phase transformation of transition alumina is significantly affected by physical and chemical properties of mother material such as particle size, morphology, and impurities, as reported in the literatures [27,28]. It can be inferred from experimental results that formation of nickel aluminate phase retarded phase transformation of Ni–A-NS catalysts by increasing activation energy for crystallization of both alumina and nickel oxide species, in good agreement with the previous report [29]."
7,Metal-support interaction in the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts,"3.2 Metal-support interaction in the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the reducibility of Ni–A-NS catalysts and to examine the interaction between nickel species and alumina. TPR profiles of supported nickel catalysts are strongly affected by the nature of metal-support interaction. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts. The reduction peak temperature of Ni–A-NS catalysts was similar to the reduction peak temperature of nickel aluminate phase [22–24]. This result is in good agreement with the XRD data (Fig. 1). However, reduction behavior of Ni–A-NS catalysts was quite different depending on the calcination temperature. It is noticeable that reduction peak temperature increased with increasing calcination temperature. In other words, reducibility of Ni–A-NS catalysts decreased with increasing calcination temperature. This implies that nickel ions diffuse from octahedral sites to tetrahedral sites of γ-Al2O3 with increasing calcination temperature of Ni–A-NS catalysts. This is because nickel ions in the tetrahedral sites are less reducible than those in the octahedral sites [30]. According to the literatures [31,32], the interaction between nickel species and alumina increases with increasing calcination temperature, resulting in formation of highly stable (less reducible) nickel aluminate phase."
8,Nickel dispersion in the reduced mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts,"3.3 Nickel dispersion in the reduced mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the reduced Ni–A-NS catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The amount of hydrogen uptake on the Ni–A-NS catalysts decreased with increasing calcination temperature. As a consequence, nickel dispersion and nickel surface area decreased in the order of Ni–A-NS700>Ni–A-NS750>Ni–A-NS800>Ni–A-NS850>Ni–A-NS900>Ni–A-NS950>Ni–A-NS1000. It was found that nickel dispersion and nickel surface area increased with decreasing TPR peak temperature of Ni–A-NS catalysts (Fig. 2). In other words, nickel dispersion and nickel surface area increased with increasing reducibility of Ni–A-NS catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, Ni–A-NS700 catalyst with the highest reducibility exhibited the largest hydrogen uptake, the highest nickel dispersion, and the highest nickel surface area."
9,Steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts,"3.4 Steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts Fig. 3 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen compositions in dry gas with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts. Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, and 900) catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during 1000-min reaction. However, Ni–A-NS950 experienced a gradual deactivation and Ni–A-NS1000 catalyst was inactive in the steam reforming reaction. As listed in Table 2 , Ni–A-NS950 catalyst retained large amount of carbon compared to the other catalysts. It is assumed that significant amount of carbon deposited on the Ni–A-NS950 catalyst hindered the assessment of reactants to the active nickel sites, resulting in poor catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS950 catalyst with time on stream [33,34]. The lowest catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS1000 was due to the lack of active nickel sites (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen compositions in dry gas over Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG, plotted as a function of calcination temperature of Ni–A-NS catalysts. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas over Ni–A-NS catalysts decreased with increasing calcination temperature. Among the catalysts tested, Ni–A-NS700 catalyst showed the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen composition in dry gas. Fig. 5 shows the correlation between nickel surface area and catalytic performance of Ni–A-NSX (X =700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, and 1000) catalysts. LNG conversion increased with increasing nickel surface area. The correlation clearly showed that nickel surface area played an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS catalysts. This is because dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbon species is a rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [35,36]. Therefore, high catalytic performance can be achieved by enhancing the number of active nickel sites on the surface of reduced catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, Ni–A-NS700 catalyst with the highest nickel surface area showed the best catalytic performance. Thus, an optimal calcination temperature was required for maximum catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS catalyst in the steam reforming of LNG."
10,Conclusions,"Mesoporous nickel–alumina (Ni–A-NS) catalysts prepared by a non-ionic surfactant-templating method were calcined at various temperatures for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of calcination temperature of nickel–alumina catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity for steam reforming of LNG was investigated. Catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS catalysts was strongly influenced by calcination temperature. Both reducibility and nickel surface area of Ni–A-NS catalysts decreased with increasing calcination temperature. Catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS catalysts decreased in the order of Ni–A-NS700>Ni–A-NS750>Ni–A-NS800>Ni–A-NS850>Ni–A-NS900>Ni–A-NS950>Ni–A-NS1000. Nickel surface area played an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Ni–A-NS catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, Ni–A-NS700 with the highest nickel surface area showed the best catalytic performance. The highest reducibility of Ni–A-NS700 was also responsible for its superior catalytic performance."
