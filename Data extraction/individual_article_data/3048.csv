0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied to achieve complete removing during wine fermentation because of undesirable reductive odors. H2S can also form volatile sulfur compounds, and metal-complexed and oxidized forms of H2S can be reduced to H2S during bottling (Ferreira et al., 2018). Most commercial strains used for wine fermentation show excessive H2S production (Kumar et al., 2010), especially under conditions of high elemental sulfur or low assimilable nitrogen levels leading to an increase of H2S liberation (Jiranek et al., 1995). There have been numerous researches over the last decade to identify the genomic determination of S. cerevisiae during wine fermentation. It has been found that strain variations in H2S production are caused by different expression and mutations in genes involve in the sulfate assimilation pathway (SAP). Overexpression of MET14, MET16, and SSU1 increase H2S production (Donalies and Stahl, 2002), whereas mutations in MET10 and MET2 reduce H2S production (Huang et al., 2014; Linderholm et al., 2010). Notably, genes in the SAP exhibit various functions under different genetic backgrounds. For example, MET17 overexpression does not always reduce H2S production (Spiropoulos and Bisson, 2000), and MET10 mutations in high H2S producers were found to be nonfunctional in a non-H2S producing strain (Linderholm et al., 2010). Additionally, the amount of H2S produced by the strain varies greatly in different fermentation conditions (Cordente et al., 2009; Donalies and Stahl, 2002; Spiropoulos and Bisson, 2000), whereas non-H2S producers are not (Linderholm et al., 2010; Spiropoulos et al., 2000). In our previous experiments, we showed multi-gene participation traits among indigenous yeast in mechanism of H2S production (Wang et al., 2018), which also indicated metabolic variation caused by genetic background (Kumar et al., 2010; Ugliano et al., 2011) among strains. Therefore, differences in genetic background are the main cause of variations in H2S production (Mendes-Ferreira et al., 2002, 2009; Nowak et al., 2004; Spiropoulos et al., 2000). Although numerous efforts have been made to uncover the relationships between SAP and H2S production, the mechanisms under wild strains exhibited different patterns of gene regulation during natural fermentation conditions are still unclear. It is hard to unequivocally uncover the mechanism that leads to H2S overflow if only SAP variation is considered in high-H2S producer. H2S has been studied as a physiological mediator with a variety of functions in mammals, including synaptic transmission, vascular tone, angiogenesis, and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Kimura, 2014), and was shown to be not only a byproduct of sulfur metabolism but also have a function of stress resistance in bacteria (Shatalin et al., 2011; Mironov et al., 2017). Although mechanism of H2S production in yeast has been studied for years, it may inspire us to think that pathways related to cellular roles of H2S may also affect H2S liberation. This study was designed to investigate metabolic difference between H2S-free strain and H2S producer and to explain H2S overflow mechanism in indigenous S. cerevisiae strain by enriching the genetic difference of RNA-Seq comparisons. Our findings provide new insights into our understanding of the mechanisms of sulfur regulation and the relationships between cell defense and H2S production behavior. The results would aid understanding H2S generation regulation during wine fermentation from the perspective of H2S formation roles in oxidative stress resistance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,S. cerevisiae strains and cultivation,"2.1 S. cerevisiae strains and cultivation The S. cerevisiae isolates used in this study were obtained from the College of Enology, Northwest A&F University (China). All 166 strains were isolated from different stages in spontaneous fermentation using various grapes among Chinese vineyards over numerous years. Sequencing of the 26S ribosomal DNA D1/D2 domain and Interdelta sequence analysis were used to identify isolates, as described by Sun et al. (2014). Strains 112y4 and 32y12 used in this study are diploid. YPD synthetic medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) was used for cultivation of all strains."
3,Screening of strains with extreme H2S production,"2.2 Screening of strains with extreme H2S production Overnight culture in 96-well plates was performed, followed by growth on BiGGY agar for 48 h to identify the color of each strain. The strains were classified as white, cream, brownish yellow, light brown, brown, or dark brown on BiGGY agar medium, corresponding to H2S production from low to high yield. Fermentations were carried out in at least triplicate in 1-L conical flasks containing 600 mL Triple M medium: 100 g/L glucose, 100 g/L fructose, 1 g/L (NH4)3PO4, 2 g/L casamino acids, 1 g/L L-proline, 0.8 g/L L-arginine, 0.1 g/L tryptophan, 6 g/L tartaric acid, 3 g/L malic acid, 0.5 g/L citric acid, and 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, pH 3.25 (Spiropoulos et al., 2000). Fermentation was performed using an inoculation of 5 × 105 cells/mL at 20 °C with a shaking speed of 150 rpm. H2S detection were performed using H2S detector tubes as described by Wang et al. (2018). Samples were collected at 16 h after inoculation and subsequently every 24 h until the end of fermentation. The collected samples were used directly to monitor biomass (OD600 nm) and residual sugar using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay (Wang et al., 2018)."
4,"RNA extraction, cDNA library construction, and RNA sequencing","2.3 RNA extraction, cDNA library construction, and RNA sequencing Two strains, i.e., the non-H2S producer 112y4 and the high H2S producer 32y12, were used to dissect the physiological mechanisms of H2S production. Samples for RNA extraction were collected after 40, 88, and 160 h of fermentation with three replications. Sampling and RNA extraction were carried out according to a study by Wang et al. (2018). The RNA samples were then characterized on 1% agarose gels and examined with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND1000, USA). The RNA integrity numbers (>8.0) of these samples were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100, USA). The construction of cDNA libraries and sequencing of RNA were performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China) using standard protocols."
5,Data processing and analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs),"2.4 Data processing and analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) After trimming of adaptor sequences, more than 5.82 million clean reads were obtained from 18 samples, which were filtered from raw reads by removing reads in which the percentage of unknown bases was greater than 10% and low-quality reads with quality values of less than or equal to 5 were greater than 50% in a read. Clean reads were mapped onto the reference sequences for S. cerevisiae S288c (http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/) using SOAP aligner (Li et al., 2009), with average mapping ratios of 94% for the genome of each sample, among which the unique alignment ratios were higher than 84% (Supplementary File 1-Table 1). Gene expression levels were calculated using the reads per kb per million reads (RPKM) method (Mortazavi et al., 2008). The NOISeq method was used to screen DEGs between the two groups (Tarazona et al., 2011), according to the following default criteria: fold change ≥ 2 and diverge probability ≥ 0.8. Two patterns were used to analyze DEGs between the two strains (Supplementary File 1-Table 2), and DEG data for the nine groups are shown in Supplementary Files 2–10. The results from BLAST sequences were annotated to the Nr database of NCBI according to gene ontology (GO) terms using BLAST2 GO (default parameters). The assembled sequences were annotated to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways also using BLAST. GO enrichment analysis was used to filter the DEGs that corresponded to specific biological functions by applying a strict algorithm. The calculated p values were subjected to Bonferroni corrections, and corrected p values of 0.05 or less were considered significant."
6,Survival tests against reactive oxygen species on solid medium,"2.5 Survival tests against reactive oxygen species on solid medium The two strains stored at −80 °C grown overnight in liquid YPD to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1, and the cultures were incubated in normal saline for 2 h after diluted to OD600 0.1. Yeast cells were centrifuged and resuspended with distilled water to final OD600 = 0.1, then serially diluted 10-fold three times and spotted (4 μL of each spot) onto YPD and Triple M plates containing 3–6 mM H2O2. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h and for plate images analysis."
7,Results,
8,Phenotypic assays for H2S production by native yeasts,"3.1 Phenotypic assays for H2S production by native yeasts To select two strains with extreme phenotypes among yeasts, we first used BiGGY agar to quantify the potential production of H2S. 166 strains were separated into six levels (I–VI) according to the colony color (Fig. 1 A), with 3, 6, 20, 20, 47, and 70 strains of type I, II, III, IV, V, and VI colonies, respectively (Supplementary File 1-Table 3). Strains with brownish yellow and dark color accounted for 90% of all strains, whereas strains with white or cream color accounted for only 10% of strains. To obtain strains with extreme H2S production, strains with colors I (using three strains) and II–VI (using two strains each for colors II–V and three strains for color VI) were chosen for H2S rescreening in Triple M condition. As expected, strains with color I showed lower H2S production during fermentation; in particular, strain 112y4 showed no detectable H2S during fermentation (Supplementary File 1-Table 4). H2S production in strains with colors II–V were quantified between 15 and 400 ppm and strain 32y12 of color VI showed the highest H2S production, with an H2S yield of 2301.3 ppm. All strains, except for 112y4, were H2S producers, with H2S production becoming detectable at 40 h, peaking at 64–80 h, and then becoming undetectable at around 160 h (Fig. 1B). With regard to fermentation traits, the results showed strain-dependent variations. All fermentations were completed within 280 h, except for that of strains 112y4 and 112y14. Lower OD600 values were observed for high producers 32y15, 32y13, 32y9, and 32y12 (Supplementary File 1-Fig. 1), which were contradictory to the findings for UCD522, a widely studied high H2S producer, which was shown to have a higher OD600 than lower producer (Mendes-Ferreira et al., 2009). These results indicated that the relationship between H2S yield and biomass was not relevant."
9,RNA-sequencing and data analysis,"3.2 RNA-sequencing and data analysis To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with H2S production, we performed a RNA-seq analysis of strains 112y4 and 32y12, which exhibited extreme H2S production capabilities. The DEGs of both strains were analyzed using two comparison patterns (comparison pattern A compared DEGs of the same stages between the two strains; comparison pattern B compared DEGs of the same strain between the different stages, explained in Supplementary File 1-Table 2) in three stages during wine fermentation. Strain comparison (pattern A) revealed 507, 1193, and 754 DEGs in three stages (Fig. 2 A), suggested a distinct mechanism of gene expression regulation among three stages between the two strain. From time-points comparison (pattern B), we found that more DEGs were highly expressed in strain 32y12, particularly at 88 h of fermentation, and that most DEGs in strain 112y4 were downregulated during this stage but upregulated during stage III (Fig. 2B). To further analyze the distribution of DEGs in metabolic pathways between the two strains, GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment were used. GO functional enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of DEGs with oxidoreductase activity (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S1), including enriched carbohydrate metabolism (carboxylic acid, oxoacid, organic acid) and glucose and hexose metabolism (Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, sulfur compound, alpha-amino acid, and amino sugar metabolism were enriched during stage I; ribosome biogenesis, gene expression and translation, thiamine-containing compound metabolic metabolism, pyrimidine-containing compound metabolism, and cellular aromatic compound metabolism were enriched during stage II (Supplementary Table S1). KEGG metabolic pathway analysis showed fewer enriched pathways with corrected p-values less than 0.05; however, the enriched pathways were consistent with the GO analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, we further evaluated these pathways and their relationships with oxidoreductase and sulfur compound metabolism. 3.2.1 Divergence of oxidoreductase activity regulation in the two extreme H2S production strains in wine fermentation stress Oxidoreductase activity differed dramatically between the two strains according to GO functional analysis. The DEGs related to oxidoreductase activity (Fig. 3) were listed in Table 1 . In strain 112y4, these highly expressed genes were mainly enriched in oxidative stress response, including CTA1, CTT1, and SOD2, encoding catalase T and mitochondrial matrix superoxide dismutases, which are important enzymatic defense systems to maintain the cellular redox state (Jamieson, 1998). The remaining set of DEGs overexpressed in oxidative stress response was associated with thioredoxin and glutaredoxin oxidoreduction systems, including TSA2, AHP1, SCO2, and PRX1, encoding thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxins; MXR1/2, encoding peptide-methionine (R)S-oxide reductase (Boschi-Muller et al., 2008); RNR2, encoding a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, a thioredoxin-specific reductase (An et al., 2006); and GTT1, GTO1, and ECM4, encoding enzymes involved in the glutaredoxin oxidoreduction system. This suggested that in strain 112y4, oxidative stress response systems were more susceptible to the stress caused by wine fermentation conditions. However, in strain 32y12, DEGs involved in oxidoreductase activity were enriched in cellular amino acid biosynthesis and were almost all associated with methionine and lysine (Table 1). Notably, the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin oxidoreduction systems as well as the syntheses of methionine and lysine all require NADPH (Celton et al., 2012; Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012), which is also directly associated with H2S production as a cofactor of sulfite reductase (Celton et al., 2012). Therefore, we analyzed DEGs associated with regeneration and consumption of NADPH (Table 2 ). Cytosolic NADPH is regenerated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd1/2p), isocitrate dehydrogenase isozyme 2 (Idp2p), and cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by ALD6. GND2 was highly expressed in strain 32y12 during stage I; ZWF1, GND2, and IDP2 were overexpressed in strain 112y4; ALD6 was upregulated in strain 32y12 during stage II; and GND2 and IDP2 were highly expressed in strain 112y4 during the final stage. These results suggested that the NADPH regeneration pathway was activated during the early stages of fermentation in strain 32y12 and during later stages of fermentation in strain 112y4. DEGs involved in NADPH consumption (e.g., ADH7, ERG5, ETR1, GDH1, GLN1, HMX1, ILV5, MET16, and OYE3) were highly expressed in strain 112y4 during stage I; DEGs associated with lysine, S-containing amino acids, glutamic acid, fatty acids, and ergosterol synthesis were highly expressed in strain 32y12 during stage II. These data could indicate that NADPH accumulated at the beginning of H2S release and was consumed mainly for the synthesis of amino acids in strain 32y12. However, strain 112y4 induced NADPH regeneration in stage II to mediate the oxidative stress response. 3.2.2 Differences in transcriptional profiles of genes related to SAP As expected, DEGs of SAP had different expression patterns in most comparisons (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Files 2–10) because H2S production was most vulnerable to gene expression and mutations in SAP. Most genes involved in sulfate assimilation and sulfide discharge in strain 112y4 were upregulated in stage I (e.g., upregulation of SUL2 and MET16 involved in sulfate assimilation and upregulation of SSU1 involved in sulfide discharge by 2.14-, 2.8-, and 9.7-fold, respectively, compared with strain 32y12), whereas there was a more significant decrease in stages II and III compared with that in stage I (Fig. 4). These results suggested that sulfate was discharged as SO2 in strain 112y4 in stage I and that SAP was downregulated during the remaining time of fermentation. In contrast, in strain 32y12, the set of genes related to SAM synthesis (e.g., SUL1, MET14, MET16, MET10, and MET12) was upregulated during stages II and III, indicating a demand for SAM in strain 32y12. Additionally, serine synthesis pathway genes (SER1, SER2, SER3, and SER33, 2–3.8-fold) and O-acetyl homoserine-related genes (HOM3, 2.1-fold) were significantly upregulated in strain 112y4 at 40 h. The relationship between serine anabolism and H2S production is still unclear. However, not all genes in SAP showed significant discrepancies between the two strains, such as genes involved in the synthesis of cysteine, glutathione, and multifunctional factors, except for Cbf1p (Supplementary Files 2–9). 3.2.3 Strain 32y12 exhibited an enhanced thiamine demand during wine fermentation The de novo thiamine synthesis pathway was one of the most significantly altered pathways between the two strains. As shown in Fig. 5 , almost all genes involved in thiamine synthesis, transport, and regulation were upregulated by at least 2-fold in strain 32y12. In addition, genes associated with the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) were also up-regulated in strain 32y12. THI5 family genes showed prominent changes (2–238-fold), whereas THI13 was significantly downregulated. Consistent with this, regulators of this pathway (THI2, THI3, and PDC2) were also highly expressed in this strain (2–2.4-fold change). The expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in thiamin biosynthesis was repressed by exogenous thiamin and induced in the absence of thiamin by an autoregulation complex composed of Thi2p, Thi3p, and Pdc2p (Nosaka et al., 2005; Nosaka, 2006). Accordingly, the dramatic increase in thiamine synthesis during the fermentation process suggested a great aggregated demand in strain 32y12. The active form of thiamine, thiaminediphosphate (TDP), is a cofactor for many enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDA1), ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD1), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1/5/6), and transketolase (TKL1/2), and two genes (ILV2 and ARP10) related to isoleucine or valine synthesis and the Ehrlich pathway (Mojzita and Hohmann, 2006). As shown in Fig. 5, PDA1, ILV2, PDC1, and PDC6 expression levels did not change, whereas PDC5 and TKL1 were highly expressed in strain 32y12. Overall, there were no significant differences among the conventional pathways needing TDP as cofactor. Therefore, excessive production of TDP may have functions in pathways other than the conventional pathway. Moreover, most genes involved in PLP synthesis were highly expressed in strain 32y12 (Fig. 5). In particular, PLP is a coenzyme for cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine γ-lyase, cystathionine γ-synthase, and cystathionine β-lyase (Cys4p, Cys3p, Str2p, and Str3p, respectively, in yeast) in cysteine synthesis (Messerschmidt et al., 2003; Aitken and Kirsch, 2005), however, the effects of intracellular PLP on H2S production in yeast are still unclear."
10,The sensitivities of the two strains to oxidative stress,"3.3 The sensitivities of the two strains to oxidative stress Metabolism of oxidative defense factors was differentially regulated in the two strains, which may be related to H2S production capabilities. We therefore examined the sensitivities of the two strains to the oxidative stress in both rich (YPD plates) and fermentation conditions (Triple M plates). Fig. 6 showed the results of plates analysis of the sensitivity of the two strains to oxidative stress caused by H2O2. Strain 112y4 was more sensitive to the oxidative stress than strain 32y12 in both rich and fermentation conditions. Considering the harsher environment encountered in wine fermentation conditions, strains were more sensitive to the oxidative stress in fermentation condition than YPD culture. This observation confirmed our hypothesis that strains with extreme H2S production capacities possessed the different characteristics of oxidative stress responses, which may be tightly related to the H2S production mechanism."
11,Discussion,"The importance of variations in sulfur metabolism to H2S production has been demonstrated in numerous studies because H2S liberation can be greatly affected when gene of sulfur metabolism was disturbed (Huang et al., 2014; Linderholm et al., 2010; Donalies and Stahl, 2002; Spiropoulos and Bisson, 2000). In reality, these results were found in high producer and few studies have been investigated the mechanism of none producer. Therefore, examined metabolic differences between non- and high H2S production strains may provide new insights into H2S production. In order to investigate the differences between these two types of strains, 166 strains in China vineyards were screened, and two strains were found with extreme H2S yield. We found that less than 2% of the wild strains possessed little or no H2S production ability, consistent with the results of previous studies (Kumar et al., 2010; Spiropoulos et al., 2000). Notably, rescreening fermentation results showed that strains with different H2S yields had similarities in H2S formation patterns but variations in biomass and fermentation abilities. These results also supported that there is a weak relationship among H2S production, biomass, and fermentation ability (Wang et al., 2018). Thus, differences in metabolic pathways related to H2S production capacity can be observed, even when two strains possess different fermentation traits. RNA-Seq analysis in three fermentation stages allowed us to compare the differences in gene regulation between the two strains. Previous gene regulation profiles using DNA microarray analysis revealed that only thiamine biosynthetic genes were expressed differentially in high and low H2S production strains (Bartra et al., 2010). However, our results showed that not only this pathway but also genes related to oxidoreductase activity and sulfur metabolism were dysregulated. We found that the oxidative stress response contained the most DEGs in strain 112y4, whereas two set of genes (MET and LYS) catalyzing S-containing amino acids and lysine were enriched in strain 32y12. Interestingly, these enriched pathways in the two strains were connected by NADPH/NADP+ metabolism, which differed dramatically between the two strains. NADPH is the reductive potential in cell, required for a variety of biosynthetic pathways (fatty acids, amino acids), redox reactions and protecting against oxidative stress (Pollak et al., 2007). In strain 112y4, DEGs related to NADPH consumption was involved in oxidative stress resistance via the glutaredoxin/glutathione and thioredoxin systems, which could eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by oxidation of self-sulfhydryl groups (SH) using NADPH as an electrons donor (Murray et al., 2011). Consistent with this, DEGs involved in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria were highly expressed in strain 112y4, which may promote the generation of cellular ROS. Thus, the standard level of NADPH may be reduced due to upregulation of glutaredoxin/glutathione and thioredoxin systems. However, in strain 32y12, DEGs related to NADPH consumption was mainly related to S-containg compounds and lysine biosynthesis. Indeed, NADPH offers the reducing power of sulfide reductase encoded by MET5 and MET10, which encodes the α-subunit of sulfide reductase and has been shown to be the single genetic determinant of undetectable H2S production traits in strain UCD522 (Linderholm et al., 2010). These results indicated that a specific NADPH metabolic variations between the two types of strains may account for the different traits related to H2S production. Meanwhile H2S generation has been found to be related to NADPH in humans (Lin et al., 2013). It is likely that NADPH deficiency caused by highly expressed genes related to NADPH consumption in the beginning of H2S release limit the reducing power of sulfite reduction in strain 112y4, leading to the low H2S production. Redundant sulfite was exhausted extracellularly by overexpression of SSU1, which also be confirmed by high total SO2 in wine after alcoholic fermentation finished in low or none-H2S producers (data not shown). In contrast, in strain 32y12, the increased demand for SAM or SAM-related compounds induced the sulfur metabolic pathway leading to the high production of H2S. Apart from the upregulation of glutaredoxin/glutathione and thioredoxin systems in non-H2S producer counteracted oxidative damage, our results also revealed that a greater oxidative tolerance may cause by a different oxidative resistance pattern in high producer. Based on the RNA-seq analysis, we found that genes involved in oxidative stress resistance, SAM synthesis, and thiamine synthesis pathways had dramatically different expressions between the two strains. Studies found that SAM is a precursor of polyamine synthesis, which is connected to stress resistance (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006), furthermore, thiamine has also been shown to have noncofactor-related functions in resistance to oxidative damage (Wolak et al., 2014). SAM is a methyl donor and precursor for the synthesis of polyamines, vitamins, phospholipids, and modified nucleotides, which are connected to stress resistance (Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012). In Particular, polyamines have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes and protect cells from ROS accumulation (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006). Thiamine is involved in the maintenance of the redox balance under oxidative stress conditions (Li et al., 2010; Wolak et al., 2014). These studies illustrate SAM or thiamine-mediated protection mechanism existed in S. cerevisiae. Because previous studies revealed that increasing thiamine and SAM biosynthesis expression levels alleviated redox stress (Zeng et al., 2017), we postulate that the upregulation of SAM and thiamine biosynthesis in high producer lead to higher oxidative stress tolerance. Indeed, strain 32y12 exhibited more tolerance than strain 112y4 (Fig. 6), confirming that upregulation of SAM and thiamine biosynthesis directly or indirectly confers to higher oxidative stress tolerance in S. cerevisiae. The mechanism of such SAM or thiamine-mediated protection remains unknown. Our results indicated an oxidative damage protection in high-H2S producer, which may differ from normal oxidative defense system consisting of superoxide dismutases (Sod p), cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1p) and glutaredoxin/glutathione and thioredoxin systems (reviewed by Murray et al., 2011). Besides, we speculated that such different oxidative damage protection may also related with high H2S production because the upregulation of SAM and thiamine biosynthesis have a strong connection to high-H2S production. Furthermore, it has been known that H2S has a crucial function of cellular stress resistance in mammals and bacteria. Recently, a model of H2S-mediated protection against oxidative stress was identified in Escherichia coli (Mironov et al., 2017). Although the detailed mechanism of H2S-mediated protection in yeast remains unknown, these results suggested that SAM and thiamine biosynthesis upregulation in oxidative stress condition may be related to H2S production to against the oxidative damage during wine fermentation in high-H2S producer."
12,Conclusion,"In this study, we highlighted the importance of gene expression patterns of NADPH metabolism in H2S production and oxidative stress tolerance capacities of the two strains under wine fermentation conditions. A decreased number of expressed genes in involved in the SAP and a high level of NADPH consumption related to oxidative stress resistance were observed in strain 112y4, although these results have not yet been confirmed; these findings may account for the lack of H2S production. Interestingly, we also found that the high expression of genes involved in the synthesis of S-containing amino acids and thiamine, which may be the mechanism that enabled the increase in oxidative stress tolerance in strain 32y12, but more work should be done to stand this mechanism. Considering the relationships among MET, THI, and stress resistance, variations in H2S production may be related to different patterns of cell defense, a potential novel mechanism of H2S production. Because the transcriptional data are not perfect, further studies are needed to determine the extent to which oxidative stress defense depends on sulfur metabolism or H2S in both non- and high H2S production strains and to elucidate the roles of NADPH in this mechanism. Understanding the mechanism of H2S-mediated protection in yeast has important implications for wine industry, which would not only diminish H2S yield during wine fermentation but also, improve the stress resistance of yeast during wine fermentation."
