0,Introduction,"Conventional sources of energy (e.g. coal, natural gas, petroleum) are exploited to meet the majority part of energy needs of the world. On the other hand, CO2, which is produced in the most combustion processes, is believed to be the main culprit of the global warming. In recent years there has been a growing interest in using renewable energy sources, mainly utilization of solar energy. Hydrogen has also become another suitable alternative energy source. Hydrogen is considered as a future energy carrier, which can be acquired for example from methanol by several processes [1–3]. Currently about 95% of hydrogen is produced by the steam reforming of methane (non-renewable source), so the possibility of using the solar radiation to produce hydrogen as a renewable green fuel is very promising, nevertheless it presents a challenge for many researchers all over the world [1,4]. One of the possible paths for the hydrogen production may be the photocatalytic conversion of methanol; this alcohol is one of the ideal resources for the generation of hydrogen and other organic compounds. The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol has been investigated in several studies [5–14]. Most of these works were carried out in a liquid phase and the most widely used photocatalyst was TiO2 doped by various metals (e.g. Cu, Pt, Au). The photocatalytic reforming of methanol with the use of different metal doped TiO2 under the light irradiation can be described by the Eq. (1) [2,4,15]: (1) C H 3 O H + H 2 O → h v , p h o t o c a t a l y s t C O 2 + 3 H 2 The model of photocatalysis was boosted not only by various experimental studies, but also by a theoretical works. Methanol is widely used as a hole trapper or a hole scavenger with various types of TiO2 in the photocatalytical processes [16,17]. Despite a number of investigations, it is difficult to determine the driving force (photon coupling, charge transfer) for the most reactions with organic molecules (such as formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, acetone, etc.) and TiO2 as the photocatalyst. It is assumed that the reactions are driven by the hole-mediated processes for the majority of these reactions. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations [18] indicate that the hole transfer to the adsorbate and proton transfer to the surface proceed simultaneously, leading to the photoinduced dissociation of alcohol (or acid) on anatase TiO2 (101). The energy discrepancy between the electronic states of reactants and the photocatalysts holes in the valence band can be a considerable problem for the hole-mediated process. In the case when the energy discrepancy is very large, the hole transfer can be effectively inhibited, especially for water and methanol [19]. It was proved that the activity of TiO2 in the hydrogen production by the photocatalytic reactions with water and methanol depends on surface phase of TiO2 [20]. Phase junction created between the surface of anatase and rutile may significantly enhance the production of hydrogen. Doping of TiO2 can additionally affect changes in the phase structure, electronic structure and surface structure [21]. Doping of TiO2 with rare earth elements results in the formation of multiple electron configurations with special optical properties (due to their abundant energy levels and electron transitions 4f); and doping with lanthanides can enhance the surface adsorption of the photocatalyst. It was found that the greatest potential of lanthanides in photocatalysis should have neodymium [22], but the findings on the effect of neodymium doping are ambiguous and somewhat different amounts of neodymium are recommended as optimal [23–25]. Nassoko et al. demonstrated that Nd-doped TiO2 achieved higher photocatalytic activity than P25 and pure TiO2 [26]. On the other hand, other studies found Nd-doped catalysts, which were prepared by a sol-gel method, to be less efficient compared to P25; and doping with 10 wt.% Nd had a negative effect on the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst under the UV irradiation, but showed only slightly better activity under solar light [22]. In the presented paper, we focused on finding an optimal amount of neodymium added to TiO2 with respect to its structural, optical and photocatalytic properties. This work follows our previous studies, where we reported extraordinary activity of Ce-TiO2 photocatalysts in the N2O decomposition and CO2 removing [27]. We demonstrated that a low Ce loading (0.3 wt.%) appeared to be the most beneficial. We chose Nd as the promoter of TiO2 photocatalysts with respect to their utilization in the oxidation of methanol as continuation of our previous research."
1,Experimental details,
2,Preparation of doped TiO2 photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of doped TiO2 photocatalysts Parent TiO2 and TiO2 photocatalysts doped with neodymium (0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 wt.% of Nd) were prepared by the sol-gel technique within the reverse micelles of nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 in cyclohexane followed by thermal treatment. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, purity >97%, Aldrich) and neodymium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Nd(NO3)3·6H2O, purity >99%, Aldrich) were used as the sources of metal cations. For the TiO2 and Nd-doped TiO2 synthesis the molar ratio of cyclohexane: Triton X-114: H2O: Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 was kept at 11: 1: 1: 1, changing the Nd: Ti molar ratio particularly. The prepared sols were poured on Petrís dishes and left for 24 h on air at ambient pressure and temperature. The sols converted to rigid yellowish transparent gels. Subsequently, the samples were thermally treated at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in air atmosphere in order to produce powder photocatalysts. Finally, the materials were sieved to particle size <0.160 mm."
3,Characterization methods of photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterization methods of photocatalysts Nitrogen physisorption was performed in the automated volumetric apparatus 3Flex (Micromeritics Instruments, USA) after sample degassing at 150 °C for 24 h under less than 1 Pa vacuum. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of nitrogen were measured at −196 °C. The specific surface area, SBET, was calculated according to the classical Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory for the p/p0 range of 0.05–0.25 [28,29]. The net pore volume, Vnet, corresponds to the total pore volume which was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm at maximum relative pressure p/p0 ∼ 0.99. Moreover, it is recalculated from cm3 (STP/g) (gaseous nitrogen) to mm3 lig/g (liquid nitrogen). Pore-size distribution (PSD) was evaluated from the adsorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm using the BJH method with Faas correction, the empirical Broekhoff-De Boer standard isotherm and assuming the cylindrical pore geometry. Phase composition and microstructural properties were determined using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a D/teX Ultra 250 detector. The source of X-ray irradiation was a Co tube (CoKα, λ1 = 0.178892 nm, λ2 = 0.179278 nm) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Incident and diffracted beam optics were equipped with 5° Soller slits; incident slits were set up to constantly irradiate area of the sample 10 × 10 mm (automatic divergence slits). Slits on the diffracted beam were set up to fixed value of 8 and 14 mm. The powder samples were gently ground using an agate mortar before analysis and pressed using microscope glass in a rotational sample holder and measured in the reflection mode (Bragg-Brentano geometry). The samples rotated (30 rpm) during the measurement to eliminate a preferred orientation effect. The XRD patterns were collected in a 2θ range of 5°–90° with a step size of 0.01° and speed of 0.5° min−1. The measured XRD patterns were evaluated using PDXL 2 software (version 2.4.2.0) and compared with database PDF-2, release 2015. Diffuse reflectance (DR) UV–vis spectra of Nd-TiO2 materials were measured in quartz cuvettes by using a GBS CINTRA 303 spectrometer (GBC Scientific Equipment, Australia). The reflectance was recalculated into the dependence of Kubelka–Munk function (F(R∞)) on the absorption energy using the equation F(R ∞) = (1 − R ∞)2/(2·R ∞), where R ∞ is the diffuse reflectance from a semi-infinite layer. The obtained spectra were transformed to the dependencies of (α·h·ν)1/2 against h·ν in order to obtain the values of the indirect band gap energies. It is possible to assume that absorption coefficient (α) is equal to F(R∞ ). Structural properties of Nd/TiO2 samples were also studied by Raman spectroscopy using a Raman DXR Thermo Scientific DXR SmartRaman. Raman spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range of 55–3500 cm−1. The excitation line of the Nd:YAG laser source was 532 nm with a laser power of 1 mW. The actual concentrations (w/w) of Nd at TiO2 samples were analyzed using Elva X energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Elvatech Ltd., Kiev, Ukraine) equipped with a Pd X-ray tube and thermoelectrically cooled Si-pin detector PF 550 (MOXTEC, USA). Power supply of X-ray tube was operated at 12 kV and 10 μA. The spectra at wavelength region of 0–10 keV were integrated for 120 s and Nd Lα line (5.2 keV) was used as the analytical line. The sample chamber was flushed with He to suppress Ar interference. Powder samples were simply poured into plastic micro-vial covered by Mylar film. Each sample was analyzed at three replicates. XPS spectra were recorded by a hemispherical VG SCIENTA R3000 analyzer with constant pass energy of 100 eV, a monochromatized aluminum source Al K α (E = 1486.6 eV) and a low energy electron flood gun (FS40A-PS) to compensate the charge on the surface of nonconductive samples. The base pressure in the analytical chamber during the measurements was 5·10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to C 1s core level (Eb = 284.6 eV). The composition and chemical surrounding of the sample surface were inquired on the basis of the areas and binding energies of Ti 2p, Nd 3d, O 1s and C 1s photoelectron peaks. The fitting of high resolution spectra was obtained through the Casa XPS software (ver. 2.3.17PR1.1). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out using an EPR spectrometer (EMXplus, Bruker). The TiO2 stock suspensions containing 1 mg TiO2 mL−1 were prepared in redistilled water, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Merck, SeccoSolv®, max. 0.025% H2O) and methanol (MeOH, Merck, SeccoSolv®, max. 0.025% H2O); before adding solvent, the titania powders were homogenized in agate mortar. The stock TiO2 suspensions were sonicated for 3 min in ultrasound (Ultrasonic Compact Cleaner TESON 1; Tesla Piešťany). The spin trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, Sigma-Aldrich) was distilled prior to use. 3,5-Dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate (DBNBS, Sigma-Aldrich) was used without extra purification. Concentrations of the photogenerated paramagnetic species were determined using solutions of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl (Tempol, Sigma-Aldrich) as the calibration standard. The TiO2 suspensions containing the spin trapping agent were mixed and carefully saturated with air or argon using a slight gas stream immediately before the EPR measurement. So prepared samples were transferred to a small quartz flat cell (WG 808-Q, optical cell length 0.04 cm; Wilmad-LabGlass) optimized for the TE102 cavity of the spectrometer X-band EPR spectrometer. During the EPR photochemical experiments the samples were irradiated at 295 K directly in the EPR resonator, and the EPR spectra were recorded in situ during a continuous photoexcitation or after a defined exposure. As an irradiation source a UV LED monochromatic radiator (λmax = 365 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology) was used. The irradiance value (λmax = 365 nm; 12 mW cm−2) within the EPR cavity was determined using a UVX radiometer (UVP, USA). Typical EPR spectrometer settings in a standard photochemical experiment were: microwave frequency, ∼9.424 GHz; microwave power, 10.53 mW; center field, 335.7 mT; sweep width, 8 mT; gain, 1–5 × 105; modulation amplitude, 0.1 mT; scan, 20–60 s; time constant, 10.24 ms. The g-values (±0.0001) were determined using a built-in magnetometer. The EPR spectra so obtained were analyzed and simulated using the Bruker software WinEPR (version 2.11) and SimFonia (version 1.25) and the Winsim2002 (version 0.98) [30]. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a photoelectric spectrometer with a 150 W Xe lamp used as an irradiation source and coupled with the P-IF 1.6 potentiostat (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland). The photocurrent responses were recorded using a classical three electrode setup. The platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode consisted of photocatalyst powder deposited onto indium-tin oxide (ITO) foil coated by polyethylene terephthalate. 0.1 M KNO3 was used as an electrolyte solution. The photocurrent spectra were recorded within the range of 240–450 nm with the step of 10 nm in the potential range of −0.2 to 1.0 V, step 0.1 V. Before the measurement itself, the measuring cell with electrolyte was purged by argon to ensure an oxygen free environment. The argon purge was also kept constant during the whole measurement."
4,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol was carried out in a cylindrical stirred, batch reactor (volume 348 mL) made from stainless steel with a quartz glass window (diameter 75 mm) in the cover (Fig. 1 ). 100 mL of 12 M methanol along with 0.1 g of a photocatalyst (concentration 1 g L−1) were used as reaction suspension. Vigorous agitation ensuring ideal mixing of the suspension was achieved by a magnetic stirrer. An 8W Hg UV lamp (λmax = 254 nm) placed in horizontal position above the quartz glass visor was used as a source of irradiation. The reaction proceeded under inert atmosphere and ambient pressure and temperature. The gaseous samples were discontinuously taken before the reaction (time 0 h) and after switching on the UV lamp during the experiment in defined time intervals 0–4 h. The gaseous samples were taken through septum using a gastight syringe and immediately analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Tracera GC – 2010 plus, Shimadzu) equipped with a ShinCarbon micropacked column and barrier discharge ionization detector (BID). In order to confirm the reproducibility of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol, each experiment was repeated 3 times with the total error being below 5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization The present content of Nd (determined by X-ray fluorescence, Table 1 ) corresponded to the theoretically expected value (calculated based on the amount of neodymium nitrate). The nitrogen physisorption showed an increasing specific surface area with an increasing neodymium loading in the photocatalyst (Table 1). The pore size distribution also (Fig. 2 ) confirmed the trend of increasing specific surface area. Pure TiO2 has the lowest representation of pores, therefore, the lowest specific surface area. The 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 sample has very similar pore volume, but according to the pore size distribution the pores are little bit larger than in pure TiO2. This is the reason of small decrease in the specific surface area compared to pure TiO2. The other photocatalysts have increasing representation of pores and therefore, higher specific surface area. Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns of Nd-TiO2 materials. All diffractions lines could be attributed to the tetragonal form of TiO2 (anatase, PDF-2 card no. 00-021-1272). No additional polymorphic forms of TiO2 or Nd-containing related phases as impurities were detected. The refined lattice parameters, cell volumes and crystallite sizes of all photocatalysts are presented in Table 2 . In general, an ability of dopant to penetrate a TiO2 lattice is strongly dependent on its ionic radius and calcination temperature [31]. The ionic radius of Nd3+ is much larger (0.104 nm) than of Ti4+ (0.088 nm) [31,32], that makes the ion substitution very hard. Therefore, we can expect no substitution of Ti4+ for Nd3+. On the other hand, the lattice parameters show small changes after the addition of neodymium. The highest increase in the lattice parameters and cell volume was observed for the 0.8 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst. A similar increase of lattice parameters was also discussed by other authors [22,33]. The decrease of crystallite size with increasing amount of neodymium can be explained by the creation of TiONd bonds around TiO2 particle which inhibits the formation and growth of crystal nuclei [31]. It is evident that the decrease of crystallite size (Table 1) correlates with the increase of a specific surface area (Table 2). Fig. 4 a shows the Raman spectra of pure TiO2 and Nd doped TiO2 photocatalysts. All spectra show features typical of clear anatase phase [34,35]. Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative method, but it allows the qualitative analysis. Anatase TiO2 has six Raman active modes (A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg) [34,35]. Maximum of band is affected by the sizes of nanoparticles and by a presence of defects of anatase structure. The most intensive Eg band appears at 143 cm−1 in the spectrum of pure TiO2 and its position is shifted to lower wavenumbers for the catalyst 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 and then to higher wavenumbers with increasing Nd content up to 144 cm−1 (Fig. 4b). The blue shift of the Raman band is connected with an increasing content of oxygen vacancies in the structure of the Nd/TiO2 materials [36,37]. Simultaneously, the red shift of the band and its broadening are observed with the increasing Nd concentration (Fig. 4b). It could be attributed to the change of crystallization degree of anatase structure [36,37]. The remaining less intensive peaks (two peaks corresponding to Eg mode at around 195 cm−1 and 639 cm−1, peak around 396 cm−1 ascribed to B1g symmetry mode and one peak at 515 cm−1 corresponds to A1g + B1g modes) show similar behaviour. The indirect band gap energy values (Eg ) were determined by extrapolating the straight line of (αhν)1/2 to zero (Fig. 5 ). It is clearly seen that the presence of neodymium ions did not change the band gap energy value of pure TiO2. It is also associated with the fact that the addition of Nd into the TiO2 was not connected with the change of anatase form of TiO2 support. The observed bands with a maximum at 2.3 eV, 2.1 eV, 1.7 eV, 1.5 eV and 1.4 eV could clearly be attributed to the f–f electronic transition of Nd3+ in the coordination environment of TiO2 nanoparticles [38]. Four different elements (Ti, Nd, O and contaminating C) can be identified in the survey XPS spectra. Unfortunately, the main Nd 3d lines overlap with the oxygen KLL peaks and the Nd 4d lines are too weak to analyze neodymium quantitatively. Nevertheless, the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra give some interesting information on the photocatalysts’ surface (the relative contents of both elements are shown in Table 3 ). Two photoelectron peaks are observed at 458.0 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.0 eV (Ti 2p1/2) for pure TiO2. The determined positions are typical for Ti4+ in TiO2 [40]. Furthermore, the Ti 2p3/2 peak shifts clearly to higher binding energies (458.3 ± 0.1 eV) after the introduction of Nd. This effect confirms the appearance of Ti-O-Nd bonds on the external surface of the TiO2 particles that were previously postulated based on the XRD results. On the other hand, the content of oxygen changes for the Nd doped samples (Table 3). Generally, two various forms of oxygen were found on the surface of all studied photocatalysts, namely lattice oxygen (at 529.5 ± 0.1 eV) and O2 − ions or/and hydroxyls (at 531.5 ± 0.3 eV) [41]. A clear increase in the amount of lattice O2 − compared to pure TiO2 is found for the materials containing Nd. For Nd/TiO2, the amount lattice O2 − decrease and the amount of O2 − ions or/and hydroxyls increased with increasing Nd loading. EPR spectroscopy represents effective tool for the determination and identification of paramagnetic intermediates. The detection of non-persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS) using cw-EPR is limited due to their short life time, consequently, the indirect methods, e.g. EPR spin trapping technique, can be applied [39]. Application of spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) represents suitable technique for the detection of radical intermediates formed in the irradiated titania suspensions [40,41]. So the attention is focused on the identification of paramagnetic species formed upon UVA exposure (λ max = 365 nm, 12 mW cm−2) of undoped and Nd-doped titania in various solvents (water, dimethylsulfoxide, methanol) in the presence of molecular oxygen and under inert atmosphere (argon). The EPR spectra obtained upon the UVA (λ max = 365 nm) photoexcitation of 0.5 wt.% Nd/TiO2/H2O/DMPO/air system revealed the formation of the DMPO-OH spin-adduct (spin-Hamiltonian parameters; a N = 1.495 mT, a H = 1.471 mT, g = 2.0057; inset in Fig. 6 ) [42] immediately after the beginning of exposure; the maximal concentration of spin-adduct was observed after 100 s of irradiation. The concentration of DMPO-OH adduct decreased upon prolonged exposure and a similar behavior was monitored for all studied photocatalysts. The concentration of DMPO-OH spin-adduct evaluated from the integral intensity of EPR signal (100 s exposure; Fig. 6) was comparable for undoped and Nd-doped TiO2 samples. Under given experimental conditions, the increased amount of neodymium in doped samples has no significant effect on the generation of DMPO-OH hydroxyl radicals in an aqueous system upon UVA exposure. The detection of superoxide radical anion generated in an aqueous media is limited due to its rapid disproportion, therefore the EPR experiments were performed in the aprotic solvent DMSO, which stabilizes the O2 − [40,41]. The detection of DMPO-O2 − in DMSO TiO2 suspensions is coupled with a simultaneously produced spin-adducts DMPO-OCH3 and DMPO-CH3 due to the reaction of solvent with ROS formed (O2 −, HO) [40,41]. Hence, upon UVA excitation (λ max = 365 nm) of 0.5 wt.% Nd/TiO2/DMPO/DMSO/air system four individual EPR signals were immediately generated (inset in Fig. 7 ). The detailed simulation analysis revealed the expected spin-adduct DMPO-O2 − with spin-Hamiltonian parameters a N = 1.277 mT, a H β = 1.031 mT, a H γ = 0.146 mT, g = 2.0058; along with DMPO-OCH3 (a N = 1.315 mT, a H β = 0.791 mT, a H γ = 0.165 mT, g = 2.0058), DMPO-OR (a N = 1.291 mT, a H β = 1.475 mT, g = 2.0058) and DMPO-CH3 (a N = 1.453 mT, a H β = 2.074 mT, g = 2.0059). In all tested systems in DMSO suspensions the relative concentration of DMPO-O2 − was lower (∼25%) and the DMPOOCH3 spin-adduct (rel. conc. ∼45%; Fig. 7) dominates in EPR spectra. Despite the application of dried DMSO, irradiation of undoped and doped titania with surface adsorbed HO−/H2O can result in the generation of the hydroxyl radicals. DMSO rapidly reacts with so generated HO on the titania surface forming methyl radical CH3. Consecutive reactions of methyl radical with molecular oxygen resulted in production of CH3OO radicals, trapped as corresponding spin-adducts [40,41]. The attention was also focused on the detection and identification of radical species formed upon UVA exposure of undoped and Nd-doped titania in methanol. The higher concentration of dissolved oxygen in methanol [41] causes significant line-broadening in the EPR spectrum, consequently, the identification of the EPR signal of individual spin-adducts presented in the system is limited, therefore the spin trapping experiments were performed under argon. Methanol is known as efficient scavenger of photogenerated holes; the reaction of methanol with holes results to the production of primary methoxy radical, OCH3 [41]. In the system of 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2/DMPO/MeOH/Ar, at the beginning of UVA exposure, a low-intensity EPR signal, attributed to DMPO-OCH3 (a N = 1.361 mT, a H β = 0.781 mT, a H γ = 0.196 mT, g = 2.0058) was observed. Upon prolonged exposure, the EPR signal of DMPO-OCH3 disappeared and DMPO spin-adduct with spin-Hamiltonian parameters, a N = 1.497 mT, a H β = 2.106 mT and g = 2.0056, was formed (Fig. 8 a). The signal well corresponds with an addition of hydroxymethyl radical on DMPO spin trap, DMPO-CH2OH. DBNBS spin trap was used in the same experiment to corroborate the generation of hydroxymethyl radical, and upon the UVA exposure in methanol only nine-line EPR signal attributed to DBNBS-CH2OH (a N = 1.286 mT, a H(2H) = 0.799 mT and g = 2.0057) was detected (Fig. 8b). We suppose that the CH2OH is generated via complex reactions of OCH3 radicals with methanol molecules or the hydrogen abstraction from methanol via hydroxyl radicals [41]. The analogous EPR spectra were monitored in all methanol suspensions prepared with Nd-doped and undoped titania. The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in order to predict response of the photocatalysts to the irradiation. Fig. 9 shows the wavelength-resolved photocurrent spectra recorded in a 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte. The photoelectrodes consist of a nanocrystalline powder deposited onto an ITO foil. The photocurrent generation is determined by the efficiency of generated charge carriers (h+ and e−) to migrate to the ITO foil or to the electrolyte [43]. In general, the holes migrate to the species in the electrolyte and the electrons are transferred to the ITO foil. In order to keep the path for electrons as short as possible, the sample is being irradiated from the back side (through the foil). The working electrode is also positively biased at 1.0 V, so the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band are forced to migrate to the ITO foil. Right after the irradiation a rapid increase in generated photocurrent is evident for all photocatalysts. This can be explained by the initial excitation of electrons to higher energy states. After this rapid photocurrent generation, a much slower generation follows until it reaches saturation [44]. This slower photocurrent generation can be described by photoexcited states exhibiting short lifetime and probability for a lattice relaxation at the surface in which deep unknown centers form when shallow donors convert into deep donors [44]."
7,The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol,"3.2 The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was tested in the photocatalytic liquid phase oxidation of methanol. The methanol molecule is relatively simple, but its photocatalytic oxidation goes through a number of steps/reactions resulting in several products, hydrogen was the main product formed under the inert atmosphere. Fig. 10 shows the production of hydrogen in the oxidation of methanol under the inert gas (Ar). The highest amount of hydrogen was observed for the 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst. The observed results are in the agreement with photoelectrochemical measurement. The activity of investigated photocatalysts increased with the increasing photocurrent response (Fig. 9). It demonstrates the role of the electron transport for the H2 production on the photocatalytic activity of Nd/TiO2. The most photoactive 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 shows the highest photocurrent. It implies that the highest concentration of charge carriers is formed in this photocatalyst because of the slowest electron–hole recombination. The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol was described by Oros-Ruis et al. by following reaction paths [45]: (2) T i O 2 + h ν → T i O 2 ( h + + e − ) (3) 2 h + + H 2 O ( l i q ) → 1 2 O 2 ( g ) + 2 H + (4) 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 ( g ) (5) 2 h + + C H 3 O H → 2 H + + H C H O (6) C H 3 O H ( l i q ) ⇄ H C H O ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) (7) H C H O ( g ) + H 2 O ( l i q ) ⇄ H C O 2 H ( l i q ) + H 2 ( g ) (8) H C O 2 H ( l i q ) ⇄ C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) (9) C H 3 O H ( l i q ) + H 2 O ( l i q ) ⇄ C O 2 ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) The reaction pathway starts by the excitation of TiO2 by UVA light forming the electron-hole pair (2); the holes oxidize water molecules to oxygen and hydrogen ions (3); the electrons generated on the TiO2 surface reduce the hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas (4). Methanol might present a direct oxidation on the h+ generating hydrogen ions and aldehydes (5). The oxidation of methanol may proceed to aldehyde and hydrogen (6)–(8). The overall reaction is presented in (9). The hydrogen was formed by the oxidation of methanol by photogenerated holes as proposed in Eqs. (10)–(15). The generation of methoxy and hydroxymethyl radicals was supported via EPR spin trapping technique. HCHO can be further oxidized to a final hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The rapid increase in the hydrogen generation is due to the fact that photogenerated electrons can be used for the reduction of H+ (Eq. (4)) and in addition due to the simultaneous water splitting. (10) C H 3 O H + h + → C H 3 O ° + H + (11) C H 3 O ° + C H 3 O ° → ° C H 2 O H + H 2 O (12) C H 3 O H + H O ° → ° C H 2 O H + H 2 O (13) 2 ° C H 2 O H → HCHO + C H 3 O H (14) H + + e − → H ° (15) H ° + H ° → H 2 The photocatalytic properties of photocatalysts are known to depend on the specific surface area, particle size, light absorption, recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and so on [46]. From Fig. 11 a it is clearly evident that the specific surface area is not the most decisive parameter in the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The yields of hydrogen are the highest for 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst with the lowest specific surface area (67 m2 g−1). On the other hand, the yields of hydrogen increased with increasing crystallite size of TiO2 (Fig. 11b) and decreasing amount of lattice and surface O species obtained from XPS (Fig. 11c). The highest yield of hydrogen was achieved for 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst with the lowest amount of lattice and surface O species (70.15 at.%) and the highest crystallite size. When the crystallite size decreases, the density of recombination centres increases, which supports the recombination of holes and electrons [47–50]. Ultra-fine particles (<11.5 nm) can undergo rapid flocculation, which decreases the availability of active surface sites [48,51]. The 1.5 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst with the very small crystallite size (7.58 nm) proved the lowest photoactivity in comparison with 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 photocatalyst which had a significantly higher crystallite size (11.5 nm). This correlation is shown in Fig. 11c. The observed yield trend of the hydrogen is a result of several factors that overshadow the specific surface area advantage of ultra-fine particles: (i) an increase in the surface electron-hole recombination (ii) particle aggregation and (iii) the amount of lattice and surface O species. In the literature, the optimal amount of Nd in Nd-TiO2 based photocatalysts depended on the type of reaction. Zhao et al. reported the optimal amount of doped Nd to be 0.5 at.% for the photodegradation of Rhodamine B [52], Rengaraj et al. proposed 1–3 wt.% of Nd for the photoreduction of Cr (VI) [23], whereas Nassoko et al. reported even 9 at.% of Nd for the photodegradation of Rhodamine B [26]. It is supposable that neodymium dopant influences the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by altering the band gap energy and the position of conduction band or the lifetime of hole in the valence band [53,54]. In our case, the band gap energy was not changed but the doping probably led to the formation of defects in the lattice and the defects acted as electron (or hole) traps, which prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and increased the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. In addition, doping of TiO2 by neodymium caused a decrease of particle size (Table 2) and an increase of specific surface area (Table 1)."
8,Conclusions,"Demand for hydrogen makes the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol interesting as a possible source of a cheap renewable energy. In the presented work, the neodymium modified TiO2 photocatalysts were used in this reaction for the first time. All the photocatalysts were prepared by the common sol-gel method and thoroughly characterized by various methods. The experimental data confirmed the efficiency of the developed photocatalysts in the oxidation of methanol. Under the inert atmosphere, the positive role of neodymium was proved at its very low loadings, i.e. for 0.2 wt.% Nd/TiO2 (0.15 wt.% Nd determined by XRF), which exhibited the highest activity under these conditions. However, should be specified that the best efficiency is reached with the lowest studied amount Nd loading. The lower content of Nd (0.15 wt.%) resulted in a decrease of the electron-hole recombination rate as it was confirmed by the photoelectrochemical measurements. The results of the photocatalytic activity measured during the photocatalytic oxidation of methanol are also in agreement with indirect EPR spin trapping technique. The photocatalytic activity is connected with decreasing amount of surface O species and optimal crystallite size of TiO2."
