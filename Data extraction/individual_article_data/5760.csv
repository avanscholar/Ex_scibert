0,Introduction,"Lipases are unique enzymes that are part of the serine hydrolase family and widely present in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Lipases catalyzes the hydrolysis (and synthesis) of long-chain triglycerides to fatty acids, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol and glycerol known as carboxylesterases [1,2]and also interesterification, esterification, aminolysis and alcoholysis. These reactions are helpful in wide range of industrial applications [3–5]. The microbial lipases are more valuable in comparison to the ones derived from plants or animals due to their variety of catalytic activities, high yield, simplicity of genetic manipulation, absence of seasonal fluctuations, regular supply, and are more stable, safer and the growth rate of microorganisms very high in economical media [6,7]. The bacterial isolates offer higher activities at neutral or alkaline pH and also offer higher thermostability [8–10]. Lipases employ a chymotrypsin-like hydrolysis mechanism using a catalytic triad consisting of a serine nucleophile, a histidine base, and an acid residue, usually aspartic acid [11,12]. Lipases are used as a potential biocatalyst in a large number of biotechnological applications; more specifically, these include dairy products (cheese recovery, flavor enhancement and the production of enzyme-modified cheese (EMC), detergents, chemicals, animal feed, textile, cosmetic, perfumery, biocatalytic resolution, esters and amino acid derivatives synthesis, fine chemicals production, agrochemicals, biosensor, and bioremediation [13–15] agriculture products (pesticides, insects), oil chemistry (fat and oil hydrolysis [16], biodiesel [17,18], synthesis of bio-detergents [19]. Digestive aids, the treatment of malignant tumors, gastrointestinal disturbances therapy, and dyspepsia therapy are also some of the medical applications of lipases [20]. In chemical and pharmaceutical reactions, the chirality of each enantiomer plays a vital role in defining the characteristic properties of the product. Chiral alcohols are representative examples of very attractive and versatile chiral building blocks, because of their ability to easily transform in more complex groups having importance in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, aroma and fine chemical industries [21–25]. Biocatalytic resolution of racemic alcohols has been considered as one of the attractive tool for the synthesis of chiral alcohols. Lipases are an important group of enzyme that can catalyze selective transesterification or esterification of the racemic alcohols to produce acylated alcohols, in which one enantiomer remains unaffected [26–30]. In other approach, racemic ester of alcohol can also be produced firstly by chemical reaction and after that, this ester is subjected to selective hydrolysis to form alcohol using lipase-mediated reaction [31–34]. Lipases are mostly distinguished from carboxyl esterase by their specificity towards different substrates [35], that is, esterase mostly prefer water soluble substrates and lipase having a significantly higher activity for triglycerides containing long chain fatty acids. Lipases also possess very unique feature of acting at both the aqueous and non-aqueous interfaces. Lipases catalyze hydrolysis as well as the reverse reaction, esterification, transesterification and inter-esterification. The possible direction of the reaction depends on the adequate reaction medium used, e.g. organic or aqueous solvents [36]. Lipases also exhibit variety of chemo-, regio- and enantio-selectivity in transformations. The lipases are widely popular owing to their ease of handling, their ability for broad substrate tolerance, high stability under different solvents and temperature and high selectivity and most importantly easy availability. They do not need expensive co-factors. Lipases today have earned immense attention and have been applied widely in different areas of biotechnology, industrial microbiology and pharmaceutical industry. The stereoselectivity of lipases makes them suitable biocatalysts in many industrial processes for the production of enantiopure compounds for example chiral drugs and/or drug intermediates [37–40]. Much attention has been paid to the use and application of lipases obtained from microbial origin due to the rapid cell growth, easy extraction procedures, and unlimited supply [41]. Numerous attempts have been made to isolate lipase producing microorganisms since lipases are used in myriad biotechnological processes. Lipase producing microorganisms can be explored from different environments viz; oil processing factories, industrial waste, dairies and variety of soil samples. Taking into account the importance of lipases in industry, the present study reports the identification of new lipase producing microbe Pseudomonas beteli from soil using multiple screening methodology. The study reports the screening and isolation of new lipase producing microorganisms from soil samples that were collected from different oil rich environments and their use in the kinetic resolution of chiral compounds. The isolated lipase strain was identified based on morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and it was found to be S-selective Pseudomonas beteli. There have been no reports on use Pseudomonas beteli lipase for kinetic resolution of alcohols. The growth condition and production of a Pseudomonas beteli lipase were optimized in shake flask study and also in laboratory scale fermenter."

5,Primary screening: screening and isolation of potent lipase producers,"3.2 Primary screening: screening and isolation of potent lipase producers Soil samples were collected from different places like Amrit Banaspati Company Ltd., Rajpura, Punjab, [near screw type oil mill (peanut, cottonseeds, beans, rapeseeds, sesame, sunflower, grass seeds, olive, and coconut, etc.) and from the different locations of the premises of National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Mohali. Following procedure was adopted to isolate pure colonies from the soil. Image 1"
6,Secondary screening: estimation of lipase activity,"3.3 Secondary screening: estimation of lipase activity Purified cultures of selected strains (from primary screening) were used to find their ability to produce lipase in liquid medium. Tributyrin being a fatty acid ester can be hydrolyzed both by esterases and lipases. To ensure lipase activity, p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) hydrolysis assay was performed on the selected strains. The microbes for the secondary screening had been obtained from three sources which were as follows: • Pure cultures obtained from the primary screening • Strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. • Strains obtained from the lipase library in our laboratory The strains grown on maintenance medium were used for the seed culture generation. Single colony was pricked from the organisms that were grown on nutrient agar plate for 24 ​h and then inoculated in 20 ​mL nutrient broth in a 100 ​mL shake flask for 24 ​h. 5% (v/v) inoculum from grown culture was transferred into 100 ​mL production medium and the culture was allowed to grow at 30 ​°C in an incubator shaker (200 ​rpm). Samples were withdrawn after 72 ​h and were immediately centrifuged (10,000×g for 10 ​min) and the obtained supernatant was collected and checked for lipase activity. Different isolates from the primary screening were tested for lipase activity using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (PNP) as an enzyme substrate. The assay was performed as per the method reported by Winkler and Stuckmann [42] with a slight modification using PNP. The PNP was dissolved in isopropanol (3 ​mg/ml). The mixture was emulsified with 9 ​mL aqueous solution of gum Arabic (0.11%) and Triton X-100 (0.40%). The 0.9 ​mL emulsion was then mixed with 0.5 ​mL CaCl2 (75 ​mM) and 1.5 ​mL Tris-HCl buffer (50 ​mM, pH 8). The complete mixture was pre-incubated at 60 ​°C for 5 ​min and 100 ​μL appropriately diluted crude enzyme obtained previously was mixed and incubated for further 10 ​min. The optical density of sample was measured at wavelength of 410 ​nm using Specord™ UV visible spectrophotometer using substrate and enzyme blanks. One unit enzyme activity was calculated as the amount of enzyme that liberates one μmol/min of p-nitrophenol under given standard assay condition."
7,Tertiary screening: screening for (RS)-alcohol resolving lipase,"3.4 Tertiary screening: screening for (RS)-alcohol resolving lipase Microorganisms having good lipase activity was grown in nutrient broth up to exponential phase and a loop full was spread on the minimum salt medium (MSM) having racemic alcohol (RS)-alcohol [43–45] as the sole carbon source. After a passage through the racemic alcohol, the organism was again grown in nutrient broth medium having racemic alcohol (0.5 ​mM). The culture was allowed to grow at 30 ​°C (200 ​rpm) for 72 ​h. Cell mass was separated by centrifugation (10,000×g, for 10 ​min) and the supernatant was cheeked for lipase activity. It was used for the resolution of racemic alcohols. Mixture of (RS)-alcohols (30 ​mM) and 5.40 ​mmol vinyl acetate was placed in the 10 ​mL round bottom flask containing in 2 ​mL of toluene [46,47]. Lipases from various isolated strains were added to this mix. The round bottom flask was closed and the mixture in round bottom flask was stirred at room temperature by placing it on magnetic stirrer. The Samples (300 ​μl) were taken at every 24 ​h interval until 96 ​h. The reaction was monitored using HPLC (Waters HPLC system equipped with PDA detector) using a chiralcel OD-H/OJ-H column (0.46 mm ​× ​250 ​mm, 5 ​μm, Diacel). Hexane:isopropyl alcohol in different ratios (v/v) were used as a mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 ​mL/min and detection was carried out at 225 ​nm."

The isolated strains were submitted for identification to Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) at the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. Polyphasic taxonomical method was used to carry out bacterial identification. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis (FAME) and biochemical characterization were performed to identify the strain and later on partial16S rRNA gene sequencing was carried out."
9,Estimation of growth,"3.6 Estimation of growth A specific volume of culture growth was taken and centrifugation was carried out at 10,000×g for 10 ​min, the cells were thoroughly washed by distilled water to remove the adhered material and a suspension was made. The optical density was measured at 600 ​nm with distilled water as a blank."
10,Optimization of culture conditions for the growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. in shake flask,"3.7 Optimization of culture conditions for the growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. in shake flask To carry out the esterification of various alcohols, there was a requirement of a large quantity of enzyme, the production of which was increased from the existing level by optimizing the culture conditions. Experiments were conducted at different physico-chemical conditions. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate in 100 ​mL culture medium taken in 500 ​mL flask. The effect of temperature, pH, age of inoculum, agitation and effect of nutrient carbon and nitrogen sources on production of lipase and growth of Pseudomonas sp. were studied in shake flask. 3.7.1 Course of growth and enzyme production In order to study the course of growth condition and lipase production for the isolated organism, experiments were conducted in 100 ​mL culture medium. Seed culture was generated by inoculating single colony from the nutrient agar plate in 20 ​mL starter culture. 2% (v/v), starter culture was inoculated to generate production medium, and the production medium was incubated at 30 ​°C for 120 ​h (200 ​rpm).

Samples were withdrawn at regular time interval and subsequently centrifuged (10,000×g; 5 ​min). Lipase activity was determined using the standard assay protocol and OD for cell suspension was measured at 600 ​nm. 3.7.3 pH To see the effect of medium pH on growth condition and production of enzyme, experiments were conducted in 100 ​mL culture medium at different pH's ranging from pH 5–9. Seed culture was generated by inoculating single colony from the nutrient agar plate in 20 ​mL starter culture. 2% (v/v), starter culture was inoculated to generate production medium and was allowed to grow at 30 ​°C for 96 ​h at 200 ​rpm. Samples were withdrawn at regular time interval and subsequently centrifuged (10,000×g; 5 ​min).

Lipase activity was determined using the standard assay protocol and OD for cell suspension was measured at 600 ​nm. 3.7.5 Inoculum age Inoculum age is an important factor which influence the growth as well lipase production of the strain. The experiments were conducted in 100 ​mL culture medium. Seed culture was generated by inoculating single colony from the nutrient agar plate in 20 ​mL starter culture. 2% (v/v) starter culture with 12 ​h, 18 ​h and 24 ​h seed culture was inoculated to generate production medium, it was allowed to grow at 30 ​°C for 96 ​h and agitated at 200 ​rpm.

Lipase activity was determined using the standard assay protocol and OD for cell suspension was measured at 600."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Primary screening,4.1 Primary screening This screening strategy was based on the clear zone formation around the colonies of the microbes on the MSM-tributyrin plates. Tributyrin being a fatty acid ester is hydrolyzed by the lipase as well as esterase giving a clear zone. Microbes that were growing in colonies with clear zones around them were isolated and subjected to secondary screening.
13,Secondary screening,"4.2 Secondary screening This screening was mainly done to distinguish lipases from esterases as both can hydrolyze tributyrin to give clear zones. This strategy is based on the fact that esterases do not give p-nitrophenyl palmitate lipase assay test. Almost twenty six soil isolates along with the strains from Microbial Type Culture Collection, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India and from the lipase library of our laboratory were screened by this method and the results are given in (Tables 1–3 )."
14,Tertiary screening: kinetic resolution of racemic alcohol,"4.3 Tertiary screening: kinetic resolution of racemic alcohol The tertiary screening was carried out by employing 16 different strains that were selected from secondary screening based on their lipase activity. The isolates were subjected to kinetic resolution of 5 different (RS) alcohols 1a-e (Table 4 ) to form one of its enantiomeric forms. The reaction scheme for esterification is shown in (Scheme 1 ). The racemic alcohols 1a-e was chemically synthesized in our laboratory and chiral HPLC analysis method was also developed and validated for these racemic alcohols. The esterification reaction was carried out using toluene as solvent. Out of the total 16 screened lipases, lab isolate 7a (Entry 16, Table 3) was found to give good activity for racemic resolution of alcohol. The results are shown in (Table 4). The lab isolate 7a was then sent to MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh for identification and characterization."
15,Microbial strain identification,"4.4 Microbial strain identification The organism with higher activity and giving best enantiomeric excess was isolated and sent for identification to Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) at the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. Polyphasic taxonomical method was used to carry out bacterial identification. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis (FAME) and biochemical characterization were performed to identify the strain. Based on morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the strain was identified as Pseudomonas beteli. The complete report obtained from MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh, India is give in supplementary information. (Refer Supplementary information)."
16,Optimization of various culture conditions for growth and production of lipase by Pseudomonas sp. in shake flask,"4.5 Optimization of various culture conditions for growth and production of lipase by Pseudomonas sp. in shake flask Culture conditions and medium components play a vital role in the growth and enzyme production by the microorganism. The production of desired enzyme can be enhanced by altering the various culture conditions such as temperature, pH, agitation, aeration, inoculum age and size, etc. Optimized culture conditions result in enhanced lipase activity [48–50]. 4.5.1 Growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. in shake flask Course of growth and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. was studied in shake flask (Fig. 1 ). The experiments were conducted in 100 ​mL culture medium. The highest enzyme activity (6.24 IU/ml) was obtained at 96 ​h of fermentation; while, maximum growth occurred at 72 ​h. Hence, subsequent studies were carried out up to 96 ​h. 4.5.2 Effect of temperature Effect of temperature was studied at different temperatures ranges from 4 to 55 ​°C. The enzyme activity was highest when flasks were kept at 30 ​°C followed by 25 ​°C. It was found that at higher temperatures, lipase activity decreased considerably. The lipase production occurred in a temperature range of 25–30 ​°C. Organism produced very little lipase at 4 and 55 ​°C, hence the further experiments were performed at 30 ​°C only. Maximum enzyme activity (10 IU/ml) was obtained at 96 ​h where the OD of the broth was 4.47 ​at 600 ​nm (Fig. 2 ). 4.5.3 Effect of pH It is well known fact that initial pH of the fermentation medium greatly affects the growth of an organism and enzyme production [48]. Experiments were conducted by varying the initial pH of the culture medium in the range from pH 5–12. Maximum enzyme activity (9.98 IU/ml) was observed at 96 ​h when initial pH medium was adjusted to 7 (Fig. 3 ). Media having the pH adjusted between pH 5 and 9 showed no considerable growth in the starter culture. It was observed that the cell growth increased as the pH of the initial medium was increased from 6 to 8 but it decreased at pH 10. This shows that higher pH did not support cell growth and lipase production. It is evident that initial pH of the medium should be adjusted to 6.0 for optimum lipase production. For all the further experiments, initial pH of the medium was kept at to 6.0. 4.5.4 Effect of agitation Agitation has profound effect on the enzyme production as well as cell growth since it directly affects the oxygen transfer rate and in evenly distribution of nutrients in the medium [48]. Lower agitation rate may decrease the oxygen transfer and higher agitation rate may cause cell death due to higher shear stress. Experiments were conducted by incubating the flasks at different agitation rates ranging from 150 to 225 ​rpm. Maximum enzyme activity was observed at the agitation rate of 200 ​rpm at 96 ​h (Fig. 4 ). There was not much variance of cell mass growth and lipase production at higher agitation rates. Lipase production at 200 and 225 ​rpm were comparable. All further experiments were carried out by keeping agitation rate of 200 ​rpm. 4.5.5 Effect of inoculum age It can be concluded from Fig. 5 , inoculum age drastically affected growth compared to lipase production. When 18 ​h old seed culture was used, growth of the organism increased significantly in comparison to use of 12 ​h old seed culture. The growth remained almost constant when 24 ​h old seed culture was used. The higher enzyme activity was observed with 18 ​h old seed culture at 96 ​h when OD of the broth at 600 ​nm was highest. Hence, for further studies 18 ​h old seed culture was used in all the subsequent experiments."
17,Effect of nutrients on the growth and enzyme production in shake flask by Pseudomonas sp.,"4.6 Effect of nutrients on the growth and enzyme production in shake flask by Pseudomonas sp. Carbon and nitrogen sources are provided in the medium which are utilized by the cells to yield cell mass and desired products [48–50]. Selection of appropriate medium components is an essential step of the fermentation process. Most of the industrial microorganisms are chemo-organotrophs which require carbohydrates, lipids and proteins for the energy production [51–53]. Usually, alternative nutrient sources are also tested to maximize the product formation at minimum cost. To estimate the minimal amount of nutrients required for the production of maximum cell mass and product is the main objective of medium formulation which ultimately affects the cost of bioprocess. 4.6.1 Effect of carbon source on the growth and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. Various carbon sources like dextrose, sodium citrate, fructose, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, sodium succinate, lactose, sodium potassium tartrate were used at final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) in NB medium for the growth and enzyme production in shake flask at 30 ​°C (200 ​rpm). As the enzyme production was associated with growth, similar pattern of enzyme production was observed with various carbon sources, however, maximum enzyme activity was observed with glucose (Fig. 6 ). 4.6.2 Effect of nitrogen source on the growth and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. The effect of various inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen such as ammonium sulphate, beef extract, tryptone, urea (0.5%, w/v), meat extract, soya peptone, peptone, ammonium chloride, and ammonium nitrate in NB medium were studied to examine its effect on the growth on cell mass and lipase production. The organic sources of nitrogen are more complex and are seen to be highly favored for higher cell mass production in comparison inorganic sources of nitrogen (Fig. 7 ). Among the organic nitrogen sources beef extract and tryptone supported the growth."
18,Optimization of physico-chemical parameters for the growth of cell mass and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. in laboratory scale bioreactor,"4.7 Optimization of physico-chemical parameters for the growth of cell mass and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. in laboratory scale bioreactor The bioreactor provides a controlled environment of pH, temperature, agitation, aeration etc. for the improved microbial growth and product formation. Large scale extracellular enzyme production is generally studied with several modifications. The modifications tend to compensate for one or more of the rate limiting growth conditions or to imitate the wild of the organism. Higher cell mass and enzyme production are generally achieved in batch or fed batch fermenters [54–59]. The rates of mixing and aeration, medium pH, cultivation temperature, strategies of nutrient supply etc. are crucial process parameters needed to be precisely investigated to achieve higher productivity in batch fermenters [60–65]. 4.7.1 Course of cell mass growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. in a laboratory scale bioreactor Initial studies of growth and enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp were carried out in aerated stirred tank bioreactor using the optimized medium at an agitation and aeration rates of 200 ​rpm and 1 vvm, respectively. Fig. 8 represents the kinetics of the fermentation process. The microorganism utilized the substrate (dextrose) rapidly after inoculation, resulting in the rapid and concomitant drop in the dissolved oxygen concentration of the medium. However, the medium pH increased gradually with the growth of cell mass and maximum growth was obtained after 25 h of cultivation. The increase in enzyme activity was seen along with the growth of cell mass and higher enzyme activity was observed after 12 ​h of growth. It is evident from Fig. 8 that instead of going down, the pH of the medium went up gradually. The acidic metabolites formed due to the consumption of dextrose were immediately utilized by the microbes. Both the cell mass growth and lipase activity went down after 25 and 12 ​h of fermentation, respectively. The fermentation broth became alkaline and there was no residual dextrose left. Subsequent studies were carried out to study the effect of different variables influencing the cell mass growth and lipase production in the laboratory scale bioreactor. 4.7.2 Effect of dextrose concentration on the cell mass growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. in a laboratory scale bioreactor Four different concentrations of dextrose (12.5, 15, 20 and 30 ​g/L) were used to investigate its effect on the cell mass growth and lipase production. Experiments were conducted at 30 ​°C with an aeration rates 1 vvm and agitation of 200 ​rpm, respectively regulated at uncontrolled pH 6.5. The course of cell mass production remained same at all the concentrations of dextrose. Maximum growth was seen within 12 ​h of fermentation process when the initial dextrose concentration of the medium was 12.5, 15 and 20 ​g/L, whereas, it took 20 ​h to reach the maximum growth with medium containing 30 ​g/L dextrose. Maximum cell mass was obtained with medium containing 15 ​g/L dextrose, (Fig. 9 ). In all the experiments dextrose was completely consumed during the growth phase of the Pseudomonas Sp., however, according to dextrose content in the fermentation medium, time of complete utilization varied. The course of enzyme production at three different dextrose concentrations varied a lot. With lower dextrose concentration (12.5 ​g/L), enzyme activity showed a typical pattern of increasing with time and then remained more or less constant. In the case of 20 ​g/L and 30 ​g/L dextrose concentration in the production medium, enzyme activity started decreasing after showing maximum value at 16 ​h of growth. Similar pattern was observed with 30 ​g/L dextrose in the medium. This may be due to the repression of lipase biosynthesis at higher glucose concentration in the medium. The DO profile in all the cases remained more or less same. Dextrose was completely utilized within 25 ​h in the medium containing 12.5, 15, and 20 ​g/L dextrose whereas it almost took 35 ​h to consume it fully in the case of 30 ​g/L dextrose in the production medium. The course of enzyme activity was similar in all the dextrose level in the medium, attained maximum in 12 ​h and then decreased. However, opposite to cell mass production, maximum enzyme activity was achieved with 12.5 and 15 ​g/L dextrose respectively in the medium and minimum with 20 ​g/L no activity in 30 ​g/L."
19,Conclusion,"In the present study, primary and secondary screening was carried out for the samples obtained from different environment to select the lipase producing microorganisms capable of carrying out transesterification reaction. Among all the screened samples, sixteen microorganisms were isolated from the oil enriched soils which had shown good lipase activity. Further, tertiary screening was done to select the best lipase producing isolate carrying out transesterification of racemic alcohols in terms of enantioselectivity. The S-selective lipase producing strain Pseudomonas beteli was identified based on morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Culture conditions such as temperature, medium pH, mixing rate, medium components and fermentation time were optimized at shake flask level to improve the cell mass growth and enzyme production. The optimum time for enzyme production by Pseudomonas sp. was 96 ​h whereas cell mass growth was highest at 72 ​h. Optimum temperature and pH were 30 ​°C and 6, respectively. Beef extract (5 ​g/L), peptone (5 ​g/L), sodium chloride (5 ​g/L), yeast extract (1 ​g/L) and glucose (5 ​g/L) were found as optimum nutrition sources for the cell mass growth and lipase production by Pseudomonas sp. The organism was also cultivated in a laboratory scale bioreactor and the various physico-chemical conditions were optimized for the maximum cell growth and enzyme production. Overall, 3.4 times higher enzyme activity and 2.75 times higher cell mass growth were achieved in bioreactor in comparison to the shake flask study. The influence of the reaction conditions on the enzyme activity and enantioselectivity of lipases for the resolution of various racemic alcohols was investigated. Pseudomonas beteli lipase can be explored further by cloning lipase gene into suitable vector to study expression of enzyme and its application in synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates."
