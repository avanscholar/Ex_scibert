0,Introduction,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major cause of medical device-associated sepsis. It is frequently associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections [1]. Biofilms are responsible for hospital infections by growing on implants, catheters, and other medical devices [2–4]. As a member of human skin microflora, S. epidermidis can easily contaminate medical surfaces following surgical procedures [5]. It has been demonstrated that its ability to form biofilms on polymer surfaces greatly contributes to its spread [6]. Biofilms are notoriously tolerant to conventional chemical disinfectants [7]. These high tolerances may be caused by slow diffusion of these compounds through the extracellular polymeric matrices [8]. Some studies have reported that slimes make S. epidermidis highly resistant to antibiotics and host defences [2]. In clinical practice, disinfection is the most important measures to prevent bacterial spread. Over the years, the use of biocides for disinfection purposes has increased [9] inducing the emergence of antiseptic resistant staphylococci which has been reported in many countries [10]. Alcohol-based skin disinfectants are frequently used, resulting in a high extent of bacterial elimination [11]. Recently, ethanol washings were shown to induce biofilms formation [12]. Biocides are used in clinical medicine for preventing the dissemination of nosocomial infections. It is important to evaluate the susceptibility of clinical strains to these compounds in order to assess the efficiency of preventive measures currently used in hospitals. The routine use of alcohol-based skin disinfectants in hospitals, have more clinical attention to get rid against their effect on S. epidermidis biofilm formation. In this study, the effects of commonly used hospital alcohols (isopropanol, ethanol and methanol), hydrogen peroxide and benzalkonium chloride were tested for biofilm formations by clinical S. epidermidis isolated from haemodialysis service in Tunisia. The XTT colorimetric assay was used to determine the percentage of viable cells in biofilms following each treatment."
1,Material and methods,
2,Bacterial strains,"2.1 Bacterial strains Bacteria used in this study were: S. epidermidis CIP106510, biofilm positive (E24) and biofilm negative (S22) strain which were isolated from haemodialysis biomaterial and carried the intercellular adhesion gene (ica) as previously published [13]."
3,Adherence assay of S. epidermidis cells as a function of biocides supplementation,"2.2 Adherence assay of S. epidermidis cells as a function of biocides supplementation Biofilms formation by S. epidermidis strains grown in Trypticase Soy broth (TSB, Bio-Rad, France) was determined using a coloremetric assay on 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), as described previously with slight modification [6,14]. An overnight culture grown at 37°C was diluted to 1:100 in TSB medium with 2% (w/v) glucose to maximise ica operon induction, as reported elsewhere [15]. A total of 200μl of each bacterial suspension were transferred in a U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Wells with sterile TSB alone were served as negative controls. S. epidermidis CIP106510 was used as positive control. The plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24h. Each strain was tested in triplicate. To analyze the degree of biofilms formation as a function of biocides, the TSB medium was supplemented with increasing concentrations; 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14% (v/v) of isopropanol, ethanol and methanol. Hydrogen peroxide was added as following: 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% (v/v) and benzalkonium chloride were used at 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6μgml−1. Each test was done in triplicate."
4,Quantification of viable cells in the biofilm by XTT assay,"2.3 Quantification of viable cells in the biofilm by XTT assay The XTT assay was used to quantify the number of viable cells in each of the wells following biocides supplementation in comparison with disinfectant-free controls. This method has been used extensively for the quantification of bacterial biofilm [16]. It measures the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT)) by metabolically active cells to a coloured water soluble formazan derivative that can be easily quantified colorimetrically [16,17]. Briefly, XTT solution (1mg/ml) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (7mM Na2HPO4, 3mM NaH2PO4 and 130mM NaCl at pH 7.4), sterilized through a 0.22μm pore size filter (Millipore, Sartorius Minisart CE 0297, Germany) and stored at −70°C. Menadione (Sigma–Aldrich, Switzerland) solution (0.4mM) was prepared in acetone and sterilized instantaneously before each assay. Following biocide exposure, the plate was rinsed three times with PBS to remove loosely attached cells, dried in an inverted position, and then 180μl of PBS and 20μl of the XTT-menadione solution (12.5 volume of XTT solution was mixed with 1 volume of menadione solution) were added to each prewashed and control wells and the plate was incubated at 37°C in the dark for 3h [17]. Reduction of XTT (oxidative activity) was then measured at 492nm using automated Multiskan reader (GIO, Rome, Italy)."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis Each analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 statistics package for Windows. The differences in the degree of biofilm formation as a function of biocide supplementation were examined by the Friedman test, followed by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. P <0.05 were considered significant."
6,Results,
7,Biofilm production under standard conditions,3.1 Biofilm production under standard conditions The XTT assay showed in biocide-free biofilms (TSB 2% glucose w/v) two strains (S. epidermidis CIP106510 and E24) were strongly biofilm-producers and displayed a high oxidative activity (1.254 and 0.855 respectively) in comparison with the non-adherent strain (0.196).
8,Effect of biocides on biofilm production,"3.2 Effect of biocides on biofilm production In the present study, XTT assay were performed for evaluating biofilm formation by three ica-positive S. epidermidis strains under standard growth conditions and in the presence of alcohols (isopropanol, ethanol and methanol), hydrogen peroxide and benzalkonium chloride supplementation. Our data revealed that the addition of alcohols (1%) to TSB medium resulted in induction of biofilm formation in the non-adherent S. epidermidis strains (S22). In addition E24 and S22 cultured in TSB supplemented with 2% alcohols (isopropanol and ethanol) displayed a strong oxidative activity (Figs. 1–3 ). We noted also that 2% methanol in TSB increase strongly the oxidative activity of S. epidermidis CIP106510 (Fig. 3). Moreover, 0.125% and 0.25% hydrogen peroxide supplementation (Fig. 4 ) enhanced the increasing oxidative activity of the non-adherent S22 in comparisons with the controls (non-supplemented wells). Our study showed that 1% of H2O2 remains a highly useful tool in the inhibition of S. epidermidis biofilm (P <0.05). Data presented in Fig. 5 demonstrated that the 0.125 and 0.25μgml−1 of benzalkonium chloride increase the oxidative activity of the three tested strains (P <0.05). Then we noted a significant induction of biofilm after 1μgml−1 of benzalkonium chloride treatment for all the tested strains (P =0.011). After addition of 2, 3, 4 and 5μgml−1 of benzalkonium chloride, the biofilms of S. epidermidis strains decreased significantly (P =0.008)."
9,Discussion,"S. epidermidis is the most frequent cause of catheter-associated sepsis and implant infections [18]. Biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of this strain [2]. Bacteria in biofilms are notoriously tolerant to conventional chemical disinfectants [7] and represent a potential health risk [19]. Alcohol-based disinfectants are recommended for cutaneous antisepsis before surgery, as well as for hand disinfection of health care workers [20]. It has been shown that more than 65% of human infections have a biofilm-related origin [21]. This reveals the importance of evaluating the effect of biocide used in hospitals to eradicate cells growing in biofilms. In the present study, XTT assay was performed for evaluating biofilm formation by three strains. The XTT indirectly measures the microbial activity; it is reduced by the dehydrogenase enzymes present in the electron transport system (ETS) to a water-soluble formazan dye [22,23]. To determine whether biocide stress would influence biofilms formation, we investigated the ability of the tested strains to form biofilms in response to 24h biocide exposure. Analysis of the data obtained with increasing alcohol concentrations showed that biofilm formation by the non-adherent strains (S22) was induced with 1% alcohols (isopropanol, ethanol, methanol) supplementation. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the oxidative activity obtained after isopropanol and ethanol supplementation between controls and 1% treated culture (P =0.015), as well as control and 2% (v/v) treated cells for methanol (P =0.08). This result agree with an earlier study which reported that 98% of primary low-grade biofilm-forming S. epidermidis strains, showed an inducible phenotype due to ethanol. In addition, Milisavljevic et al., [24] have mentioned that alcoholic ingredients in skin disinfectant have the potential to increase biofilm formation in clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. Similar results were reported in 18 among 37 S. epidermidis strains, showing increased biofilm formation in the presence of ethanol [25]. As presented in Fig. 3, the addition of 2% methanol in TSB increase strongly the oxidative activity of S. epidermidis CIP106510. This result is in agreement with an earlier study which showed that biofilms production was also induced in same isolates [12]. The increase in biofilms formation due to the alcohol supplementation suggests that this phenomenon may be in accordance with the development of nosocomial S. epidermidis infections in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the alcohols tested in the present study are bactericidal at high concentration by inhibiting biofilms production in the three tested strains. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test revealed a statistical significant difference between the control and the alcohol-treated cells with concentrations over 6% (P =0.008). Our results are in accordance with a recent study, which demonstrated that ethanol or isopropanol reduces the aerobic skin flora when applied at higher concentration as well as for longer times [26]. Fig. 4 showed a strong biofilm inhibition (very low oxidative activity) starting from 1% hydrogen peroxide supplementation, this prove that H2O2-biocide remained very useful tool against S. epidermidis biofilm inhibition. Moreover, 0.125% and 0.25% hydrogen peroxide supplementation (Fig. 4) enhanced the increasing oxidative activity of the non-adherent strain (S22) and S. epidermidis CIP106510 (1.305) in comparison with the controls. It has been reported in a recent study that biofilm in non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae may act as a barrier that prevents penetration of biocidal agents [27]. In addition Conlon et al. [28] reported that the capacity to form biofilm depend on environmental conditions, such as acidic stress or sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations. Regarding oxidative activity obtained with 1% hydrogen peroxide supplementation a statistical significant difference has been notified between controls and treated cells (P <0.001). This result agrees with earlier study which reported that chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds were very active against human pathogenic bacteria [29]. However, some biocides have been shown to be inactivated by bacterial biofilm as a result of an interaction with the glycocalyx [30]. Our study also confirms the many variations in biofilm formation found in clinical S. epidermidis strains following biocide stress. These findings suggest that regulation of biofilm formation under various growth conditions plays a role in the pathogenesis of biomaterial-related S. epidermidis infections."
