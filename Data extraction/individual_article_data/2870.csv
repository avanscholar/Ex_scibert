0,Introduction,"Fabrication of biodegradable material from lignocellulose resources to substitute non-biodegradable synthetic polymers, is gaining great attention due to the growing consciousness of green environment [1]. Cotton gin trash (CGT) is a potential lignocellulose waste obtained from the ginning plants of cotton fibres [2]. It is a mixture of cotton motes (fibres entangled with immature or small seeds), burrs, sticks, leaves and other plant residues that are composed of around 42–50% of holocellulose [3]. While the annual production of cotton was less than 21 million metric tons five years ago, it has reached around 27 million metric tons, for the last couple of years [4]. This increase is directly linked to the generation of a higher CGT amount as it represents one-third weight of each cotton bale [5]. Despite the abundance of natural lignocellulose, these are difficult to dissolve or melt in a common solvent system due to their strong intermolecular bonding among cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [6]. Therefore, the addition of synthetic polymers is often considered to transform these into an anticipated form or film. Since these materials are significant mainly due to their environmentally friendly nature, to prepare a completely green material, uses of the biodegradable synthetic polymer are more desirable rather than the non-biodegradable. In this context, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a great low-cost choice as it is well known for its biodegradability, thermal and chemical stability, and film-forming property. The hydrophilic character and presence of hydroxyl (–OH) groups in PVA are well-matched with carbohydrates producing good compatibility in the composite [6,7]. Materials produced from PVA combining lignocellulose resources (such as CGT), are likely to be recyclable and biodegradable, reducing the impact of plastic contamination in the ecosystem. However, the characteristic of CGT is not completely identical compared to most of the agro-wastes due to the bimodal particle size distribution usually not found in other common natural resources [2]. Though PVA was previously combined with different lignocellulose, such as wheat straw and barley husk for composite production, conception of CGT/PVA composite is very new [2,8–10]. Earlier, CGT was used in a few composite applications, e.g., with low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, poly(lactic acid) and polypropylene, mainly in its coarse form of powder (particle size ≥ 150 μm) [11–14]. The first use of CGT powder in its fine form i.e., d(0.5) = 6.24 μm, was reported recently by our case study with PVA (also the first case of a CGT/PVA composite), though the physicochemical properties were not stated [2]. Following that, a very recent study reported the mechanical properties of CGT/PVA composite based on the coarse form of CGT powder (particle size ˂ 150 μm) [15]. The particle size of the reinforcing material has a key influence on some major properties of composites, such as morphology, tensile strength and thermal properties [16,17]. However, the influence of the fine powder of CGT in composite properties is yet unrevealed. Besides, there is no such study of CGT/PVA composite addressing the effect of both coarse and fine CGT powder on the composite properties. Therefore, the prime objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the impact of CGT particle size on the properties of CGT/PVA composite, and the interrelations among its physicochemical characteristics. To achieve this, CGT was first converted into the coarse and fine powders (particles) and CGT/PVA composite plastics were prepared using both powders. Further, the morphology, chemical structure, crystallinity, thermal stability, optical transmittance, tensile properties, moisture content and biodegradation of the films were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cotton gin trash used in this study was collected from the cotton ginning facility of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Australia. Polyvinyl alcohol (5% w/w) dissolved in deionized (DI) water was purchased from Flew Solutions Australia Pty Ltd., Australia. The degree of hydrolysis of the PVA used in the solution was 86–90% mol and the molecular weight of PVA was ~100,000."
3,Fabrication of powder from CGT,"2.2 Fabrication of powder from CGT The coarse CGT powder was fabricated by cutting CGT using a Pulverisette 19 rotary cutter mill (Fritsch GmbH, Germany) [18]. The fine powder was obtained by milling the coarse powder in S/1 attritor mill (Union Process, USA) at 280 rpm for 4 h following the parameters in our earlier study [2]. The slurry collected, after the milling, was dried to get the fine CGT powder in a B-290 mini spray dryer (Buchi Labortechnik AG, Switzerland) maintaining 180 °C inlet air temperature, 100 °C outlet air temperature and 10 ml/min flow rate [18]."
4,Fabrication of film,"2.3 Fabrication of film The CGT/PVA composite films were prepared with a 50/50 weight ratio of CGT powder and the amount of PVA dissolved in solution. The composite film was prepared at a higher ratio of CGT/PVA such as 60/40, resulting in a brittle film. Therefore, the highest possible amount of CGT (50%) was chosen to retain the flexibility in the final film as shown in Fig. 1 . The CGT powder was added to the PVA solution and stirred for 1 h at 80 °C to get a finely dispersed mixture. The dispersed mixture was temperature-dependent and achieved more rapidly with a higher temperature. In this study, the moderate temperature (80 °C) was selected to produce the mixture in a reasonable time (1 h). The dispersion was then poured on a polystyrene dish and kept overnight in a fume hood to evaporate water and shape the film. The dry film (Fig. 1) was then peeled off from the substrate and taken for investigation. A pure PVA film was also prepared by the same technique using the PVA solution only. The composite films prepared from coarse CGT powder and fine CGT powder were named as CPVA and FPVA, respectively. The thickness of all the films was kept similar and around 90 ± 10 μm by controlling the amount of solutions poured into the dish. Since this study is an extended work from our previous report, the method of film fabrication was kept similar to that of our previous study [2]. However, to enhance the process efficiency, more advanced techniques for composite preparation, such as hot pressing and extrusion are under consideration and could be used in future works."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 Particle size The particle size of CGT powders was measured using Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser (Malvern, USA) accompanied by a Hydro 2000S dispersion unit. The refractive index of CGT was considered to be 1.53 following the previous report [2]. Powders were dispersed in Deionized (DI) water before the test and the mean value of 3 measurements was reported. 2.4.2 Morphology The morphology of the samples was observed by a Supra 55 VP (Zeiss, Germany) scanning electron microscope (SEM) using 3 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were gold sputter-coated in an EM ACE600 sputter coater (Leica, Australia) prior to the imaging. 2.4.3 Chemical structure The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of all the samples were investigated with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) mode using a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The experiment was conducted from 600 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 wavenumbers at 4 cm−1 scan resolution and 32 scans/sample, maintaining a N2 atmosphere. 2.4.4 Crystallinity The crystallinity of PVA in all the films was measured using both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR techniques. The XRD patterns of the samples were obtained by an X'Pert Powder instrument (PANalytical, Netherlands) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, maintaining 0.013° step size and 200 s/steps from 15° to 25° of 2-theta. The XRD peak deconvolution was performed by using the Gaussian function in Origin 2019. The crystallinity index (CI) was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) CI = A c A c + A a × 100 where A c is the area of the crystalline region, and A a is the area of the amorphous region. Each sample was tested three times, and the average and standard deviation values were reported. The proposed method of Tretinnikov and Zagorskaya was used [19] to measure the crystallinity by using FTIR technique. The CI was calculated considering the relationship between the intensity of the crystalline band at 1144 cm−1 normalised to CO stretching at 1094 cm−1 using Eq. (2). (2) CI = − 13.1 + 89.5 A 1144 A 1094 where A 1144 and A 1094 are the intensities at 1144 cm−1 and 1094 cm−1 wavenumbers, respectively. 2.4.5 Optical transmittance The optical transmittance of the samples was measured in the transmittance mode using a Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Data were collected as a percentage of transmitted light from 800 nm to 200 nm wavelength. The UV protection factor (UPF) of the film samples was measured using the YG902 UPF and UV penetration/projection measurement system (Fangyuan Instrument, China). 2.4.6 Tensile strength, elongation at break and folding endurance The tensile strength and elongation at break of the film samples were measured at 5 mm/min constant rate of elongation using a universal tensile testing system (Instron 5967, USA) fitted with a 100 N load cell. The gauge size of the specimens was 25 mm × 6 mm and five specimens from each film were tested, while the average and standard deviation values were reported. The actual thickness of each film was used during the calculation of tensile strength, to avoid the influence of thickness variation in results. The folding endurance was evaluated by repeatedly folding strips from each film at the same point up to 200 times or until it breaks [20]. Three specimens of each film were tested, and average and standard deviation values were reported. 2.4.7 Moisture content The moisture content (MC) of CGT coarse and fine powders, and the fabricated films were measured following ASTM D1576–13 method [2]. All the samples were conditioned at 20 °C ± 2 °C and 62% ± 2% relative humidity for 2 days prior to drying at 110 °C in an oven for 4 h. The conditioned weight and dried weight of the samples were used to calculate MC% by the following Eq. (3): (3) MC = W c − W d W c × 100 where W c and W d are the conditioned weight and dried weight, respectively. Each sample was tested three times, and average and standard deviation values were reported. 2.4.8 Thermal degradation The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the powders and films was conducted using TGA Q50 (TA Instruments, USA) in a N2 atmosphere. The percentage loss of weight of the samples was observed from 30 °C to 500 °C temperature maintaining a heating rate of 20 °C/min. 2.4.9 Biodegradation The weight loss due to biodegradation of the films was determined by using a similar method reported in the earlier study [5]. The film was cut into rectangular shapes and buried in Australian standard low-density soil (AS 4419) in a container. The container was kept inside an incubator maintaining 30 °C temperature for 30 days. Since the container was not airtight, water was sprayed into the containers every 10 days to make up the gradual water evaporation. The samples were taken out, cleaned and weighed every 5 days to calculate the weight loss (%) by the degradation. It should be noted that initially, a total of 6 samples of each film were buried, and every time (every 5 days) one of the samples was weighed, so that the biodegradation does not get interrupted by the cleaning and weighing process."
6,Statistical analyses,"2.5 Statistical analyses The statistical significance of the data was measured by performing a two-tailed t-test between the datasets. The calculated probability, p values were derived where p ≤ 0.05 denotes a significant difference, and p > 0.05 denotes no significant differences between the datasets."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Particle size,"3.1 Particle size The volume-based particle size distribution of CGT coarse and fine powder is shown in Fig. 2 . The distribution of coarse powder showed a shoulder with the main curve indicating the presence of a significant volume of smaller particles along with the larger particles in the powder. The particles containing different structures (linters, burrs, broken leaves, dust and inorganic materials) were affected differently by the milling process and resulted in a bimodal distribution for the CGT fine powder, which was similar to the earlier CGT study [2]. Fig. 2 also demonstrates d(0.1), d(0.5) and d(0.9) values of CGT powders which consist of 10%, 50% and 90% of the particles smaller than the presented size, respectively. The d(0.5) of CGT powder reduced from around 144 μm to around 5.7 μm over 4 h attrition. As confirmed by the bimodal distribution stated above, around 10% of the fine powder was found to be less than 0.69 μm in size."
9,Morphology,"3.2 Morphology The morphology of CGT powders and fabricated films is shown in Fig. 3 . The ribbon-shaped cotton fibres were seen in the CGT coarse powder along with other random shape particles with rough surfaces (Fig. 3a). The CGT fine powder collected after attrition was also found in different sizes (Fig. 3b). However, the differences observed in sizes were much lower compared to the coarse powder as the number of smaller particles increased, and larger particles decreased with the attrition. As a result, the cotton fibres were not distinguishable in the fine powder, broken into smaller sizes. The shapes of the CGT fine powder particles also became similar by the attrition which was not observed in coarse powder. The structure of CGT coarse and fine powders directly affected the morphology of the composite films prepared from these powders. The presence of CGT particles was evident in the films (Fig. 3d and Fig. 3e) when compared to the PVA film (Fig. 3c) which showed a very smooth surface. The ribbon-shaped fibres were also seen on the surface of CPVA film which produced rougher areas. Due to the presence of large and uneven CGT particles in CPVA, the distribution was non-uniform and there were more open spaces produced on the surface (observed by the scale provided in the SEM images). However, as the FPVA film was prepared from the fine and more even particles of CGT, the distribution of these particles all over the film was more uniform compared to the CPVA film. The digital image as shown in Fig. 1 (a1 and b1) also confirmed the uniformity of the films, where the CPVA showed more PVA areas (white background), whereas FPVA showed an evenly brown coloured film. However, due to the particles size, the letters in the background of CPVA became indistinguishable, yet completely readable through the FPVA film (Fig. 1)."
10,Chemical structure,"3.3 Chemical structure The chemical structure of PVA/CGT films was analysed using FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 4 ). For both CGT and PVA, the stretching vibrations of OH groups of hydrogen bonds showed a broad peak around 3344 cm−1 to 3292 cm−1 which was unchanged after preparing the composite films [21]. The symmetric and asymmetric CH stretching of the compounds were observed in all samples by the bands at 2920 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1, respectively [22]. Carbonyl group (C=O) in both CGT and PVA was observed at around 1720 cm−1 where PVA showed more intensity in the peaks [5,23]. This (C=O) group was observed in the PVA structure as the PVA used in this study was partially hydrolysed [23]. The (C=C) stretching in the aromatic ring of CGT was represented by the peak around 1627 cm−1 and was not seen in PVA as it does not possess an aromatic ring [21]. However, in CGT/PVA composites, this peak was present at a reduced intensity. The peaks at 1423 cm−1, 1375 cm−1, and 1315 cm−1 represented the CH asymmetric deformation, CH bending and H–C–H bending, respectively in both CGT and PVA [2,23]. Besides, the peaks at 1249 cm−1 and 1161 cm−1 corresponded to CC stretching and C–O–C asymmetric stretch [5]. The CO crystalline peak in C–OH group of PVA was observed at around 1144 cm−1, whereas the broadband of CO stretching vibration was seen at around 1094 cm−1 in all of the films [19]. A peak around 1105 cm−1 was seen in CGT and PVA/CGT due to the aromatic CH in-plane deformation [5]. For CGT, the peak at around 1053 cm−1 corresponded to CO stretching [5]. The peaks for silica (Si–O–Si symmetric and asymmetric stretching at 889 cm−1 and 1034 cm−1, respectively) found in CGT were similar to our previous study [2,5]. These peaks were also observed in the PVA/CGT composites. A peak around 941 cm−1 in the spectra of PVA and shoulder peaks at the same position of PVA/CGT composites corresponded to the CH stretching in PVA [23]. Besides, a peak observed around 830 cm−1 of both PVA and PVA/CGT composite films corresponded to CH rocking originated from PVA [23]. These two peaks at 941 cm−1 and 830 cm−1 were not observed for CGT only samples using fine or coarse powders. Since the chemical structure of PVA and CGT was well retained in the composite films' spectra, it can be concluded that PVA and CGT showed good compatibility inside the PVA/CGT composites."
11,Crystallinity,"3.4 Crystallinity The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of PVA, CPVA and FPVA films showed the characteristic peak around 19.8° related to (101) γ-crystalline phase of PVA representing the semi-crystalline characteristic [24,25]. The CI of the samples was calculated by deconvolution of the peak and by fitting it into two Gaussian peaks (narrow and broad peak representing the crystalline and amorphous region, respectively) [24,26]. A representative XRD pattern of PVA with the curve fitting is shown in Fig. S1. The average CI values of PVA, CPVA and FPVA films calculated from XRD and FTIR data are listed in Table 1 . The CI of pure PVA calculated from XRD spectra was ~42 which was well supported by the average crystallinity obtained from the FTIR analysis (~40.5). No significant differences were observed between CI values calculated from the two different methods (XRD and FTIR) for each individual sample, justifying the accuracy of the results. The CI values reduced significantly compared to the pure PVA when CGT particles were incorporated. This is likely the presence of both PVA and CGT particles in the composite structure, resulted in a reduced amount of PVA crystals compared to the same volume of the PVA only film [24]. The crystallinity of the CPVA film was higher than the FPVA film. Since in our previous study, the crystallinity index of cellulose in CGT powders did not significantly change by the milling process (remained around 30, for coarse and fine powders up to 4 h milling) [2], the lower crystallinity in FPVA was probably due to the well distributed fine powder in PVA matrix compared to the coarse powders (as observed in SEM images). Therefore, the interruption of CGT in PVA crystals was more intense in FPVA film rather than the CPVA film which negatively affected the PVA crystallinity."
12,Optical transmittance,"3.5 Optical transmittance The optical transmittance behaviour of PVA, CPVA and FPVA film from 200 nm to 800 nm wavelength is shown in Fig. 5 . The PVA film was almost completely transparent in the visible spectrum. However, the transmittance of PVA film was ~0.01% at around 200 nm and a band was also observed at around 275 nm due to the absorption of light in the UV region. Generally, these absorption peaks are produced when transitions occur for (n or π) electrons to an excited state (π*). These transitions need the existence of unsaturated functional groups in the sample structure to offer the π orbital [27]. The low transmittance or high absorption at around 200 nm might be due to the presence of the carbonyl group in the PVA structure (FTIR spectrum) which initiated the n → π* transition [28]. Besides, the band around 275 nm was possibly due to the π → π* transition occurring by the available conjugated systems in the PVA structure [27,28]. While the transmittance of both CPVA and FPVA films decreased with the decrease in the wavelength, the CPVA film showed a higher light transmittance. This might be due to the greater PVA areas in the CPVA films (digital and SEM images, Fig. 1 and Fig. 3) where PVA fraction was much higher, letting the light pass through easily. Both composite films showed a band near 680 nm attributing to the brown colour of the films. At the starting point of the UV region (around 400 nm) the light transmittance was around 4% and almost 0% for CPVA and FPVA film, respectively. The transmittance of CPVA film became near zero at around 300 nm whereas a complete UV light protection was observed by FPVA film at all wavelengths. The nature of UV resistance of the composite films is attributed to the presence of lignin from CGT which contains the phenolic groups (observed by FTIR spectra) [29], confirming that lignin was preserved during the milling process. This result was further supported by the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) of the films (Fig. 5, right). A very high UPF was observed for both CPVA (~160) and FPVA (~234), whereas it was almost zero for the pure PVA film. The lower UPF of CPVA compared to FPVA might be due to the larger PVA only areas in CPVA film that led to higher UV transmission."
13,"Tensile strength, elongation at break and folding endurance","3.6 Tensile strength, elongation at break and folding endurance The tensile strength and elongation at break, and folding endurance of PVA, CPVA and FPVA films are listed in Table 2 . The tensile strength of pure PVA was found around 42 MPa which was in the range of reported values in the literature [6]. The tensile strength of the CPVA and FPVA films was around 10% and 20%, respectively higher than the PVA film and statistically significant (CPVA: p ≤ 0.05 and FPVA: p ≤ 0.01). The higher strength of the composite prepared from cellulosic material with PVA compared to the pure PVA is also well reported in several studies [30,31]. Given that the crystallinity of PVA composites reduced, the higher tensile strength may be attributed to the incorporation of cellulose which typically has a higher breaking strength and good compatibility with PVA composite due to the inherent hydroxyl groups [6,17]. The elongation at the break of composite films highly reduced (p ≤ 0.0001) compared to PVA, due to the lower breaking strain of cellulose-based material [17]. This phenomenon is also likely to affect the flexibility of the composite films compared to that of pure PVA film. Confirming that, the folding endurance of the composite films was found much lower than the PVA film as shown in Table 2. Therefore, the use of suitable plasticiser is recommended for future studies to improve the flexibility of CGT/PVA composite film [20,32]. Between the composite films, both the elongation at break and folding endurance of the CPVA film were found slightly higher than that of the FPVA film. This is probably due to the greater continuous PVA areas present in the CPVA film as discussed earlier in Section 3.2 and 3.5. However, these differences were not found statistically significant. The tensile characteristics of PVA only film and composite films are also shown in the representative stress-strain curve in Fig. S2. Between the two composite films, FPVA showed a significantly higher tensile strength than the CPVA. This might be due to the difference in the CGT particle size in the films, as the size reduction in reinforcing material often increases the surface area and hence works favourably towards interfacial interaction in composites [17]. Besides, when the particle size is larger, a greater disturbance angle is produced in the matrix system which directly promotes the early breakage [16]. A probable mechanism of the influence of CGT particle size in matrix disturbance is shown in Fig. 6 ."
14,Moisture content,"3.7 Moisture content The moisture content (MC) of CGT coarse powder, fine powder and fabricated films are shown in Fig. 7 . It was observed that the moisture gaining properties of CGT powder enhanced when transformed into smaller particle size. Overall, the MC of CGT powder increased about 21% when converted into the fine powder. This change was also found at a high level of significance (p ≤ 0.01). The smaller particle size is often correlated to the higher moisture uptake properties due to the enhancement of overall surface area (1.69 m2/g for the coarse powder and 4.08 m2/g for the fine powder (4 h attritation) of CGT, reported in our previous study) [2,33]. The MC of pure PVA film was around 5%, agree with the common moisture properties of PVA reported in the literature (4.5–5%) [34]. The MC increased when CGT powder is incorporated with PVA. This was likely as CGT showed much higher moisture properties compared to PVA (p ≤ 0.001) and thus influenced the moisture uptake properties of the composites. Overall, the increase in MC was around 25% by the incorporation of coarse powder and around 48% by the incorporation of fine powder which was statistically significant at a level of p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.01, respectively compared to the pure PVA. The difference between the MC of CPVA and FPVA was also significant (p ≤ 0.05) which was in accordance with the significant difference between the MC of CGT coarse and fine powders stated above."
15,Thermal degradation,"3.8 Thermal degradation The thermogravimetric analysis of CGT coarse and fine powders, PVA, CPVA and FPVA film is illustrated in Fig. 8 . Overall, the thermogravimetric behaviour of the samples can be divided into three phases. The first phase occurred around 60–150 °C where a small weight loss of each of the samples was observed due to moisture evaporation [2]. The weight loss of the CGT powders was around 9% higher than the films at around 150 °C. This might be due to the significantly higher moisture content of the powders than the films (as discussed in the previous section). The second phase of degradation started at different temperatures for different samples due to the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose in CGT and side chains in PVA [35,36]. CGT powders started to degrade around 230 °C, much earlier than the composites (around 300 °C) and PVA only film (290 °C). This CGT powder behaviour was in accordance with our earlier work [2]. The degradation of PVA was also found identical to the pure PVA degradation temperature reported in the previous study [35]. However, the degradation of the composite films started at a slightly higher temperature (+10 °C) than the PVA. Since these composites contained cellulose and hemicellulose, a gradual loss of weight was also seen starting from around 230 °C similar to the powders. The third phase of the degradation of the CGT powder samples started around 450 °C which was due to the lignin degradation [2]. However, the third phase of PVA only sample started around 350 °C due to the degradation of the backbone of PVA [35]. The FPVA started the third phase at around 400 °C, whereas, CPVA film started around 350 °C similar to the PVA. The thermal behaviour of the samples in this junction of the second and third phase was very interesting. It was observed that the PVA only film lost higher percentages of weight compared to the powder samples after the second phase. For example, at around 400 °C, the loss of weight of PVA was around 74.5% whereas the powders lost around 56–59% weight at the same temperature. A significant difference was observed between the weight loss behaviour of FPVA and CPVA where the weight loss of CPVA was 19% higher than that of FPVA film (~69% for CPVA and ~ 58% for FPVA) at near 400 °C. Since the only difference between these films was the CGT particle size, this behaviour might have resulted from the non-uniform distribution of coarse CGT particles in the CPVA composite, where ‘only PVA’ area was more exposed in CPVA (as noted in the morphology and optical transmittance discussion). Hence, the CPVA film showed thermal property similar to PVA rather than the FPVA film. The differences in the starting points of the third phase of the samples probably also correlated with the distribution of CGT fine and coarse particles in the composites as mentioned above. At around 490 °C, the weight loss of PVA was around 94%, much higher than the CGT samples (66–81%). This might be due to the fact CGT contains not only a combination of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, but also inorganic materials and ashes. Overall, the results suggest a significant improvement in the thermal behaviour of the CGT/PVA composite films, particularly when prepared from the fine CGT powder."
16,Biodegradation,"3.9 Biodegradation The weight loss of the PVA, CPVA and FPVA films due to biodegradation is shown in Fig. 9 . Initially, the weight loss was almost similar for all the samples (5 days), after which the weight loss of the CGT incorporated films gradually increased compared with the PVA only film. It was observed that approximately 17% of the weight was lost from the PVA film within 30 days, whereas the weight loss of CPVA and FPVA films was around 30% and 40% higher, respectively than PVA only film for the same time period. Since in the FTIR study, no chemical change observed in the structure of PVA or CGT in the PVA/CGT composites, this degradation was likely as these materials retained their biodegradable nature. This degradation behaviour has also been reported for PVA based films, where incorporation of lignocellulose biomass enhanced the biodegradability of PVA composites [37]. This is because lignocellulose is a naturally occurring polymer which is more susceptible to the breakdown by the soil microorganism due to the presence of hemicellulose and higher amorphous cellulose portion [37]. The weight loss of the FPVA film was around 8% higher than the CPVA film after 30 days. This was probably because of the lower crystallinity of FPVA compared to CPVA (discussed in Section 3.4) which helped the soil microorganism to intrude inside the sample more easily and perform the degradation [37]. However, this method of measuring biodegradation mostly relies on the breakdown of the material rather than the actual degradation. Therefore, a more appropriate method, such as measuring respiration activity during the biodegradation of the films may be considered in future."
17,Cost estimation,"Estimation of cost for the usage of electricity and chemical during film fabrication from fine CGT powder has been carried out and is listed in Table 3 . Besides, Table 3 also reflects the cost estimation of fabricating film from the coarse CGT powder if the costs of electricity for attritor mill and spray dryer are not considered. The cost of electricity was calculated considering the maximum power consumption by each machine, and 0.28 Australian dollar (AUD) as the current average electricity cost per kWh in Victoria, Australia [38]. However, it should be well noted that the actual cost of film fabrication is likely to be lower than this estimated cost, since the machines did not run at their highest capacity (e.g., rotating speed, temperature) during the process and thus did not consume the maximum power in actual circumstances."
18,Conclusions,"Biodegradable composite plastics were successfully produced from fine and coarse cotton gin trash (CGT) powders and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), where the total cost of plastic film fabricated from the fine powder was estimated around 170 AUD/kg film, in which 20 AUD/kg was the electricity cost. The effect of particle size of fine (around 5.7 μm) and coarse (around 144 μm) powders on the composite properties was investigated. Though the PVA crystallinity was reduced by adding CGT, the tensile strength, UV shielding and thermal stability of the composites were enhanced. Scanning electron microscope images showed the distribution of fine powders in PVA was more uniform compared to the coarse powder. Though the breaking elongation and flexibility of the composites reduced by CGT incorporation, the tensile strength of CGT fine powder/PVA film was around 9% higher than CGT coarse powder/PVA film and around 20% higher than the pure PVA film. Overall, an environmentally friendly method was explored to valorise CGT in a wide range of applications, e.g., biodegradable packaging material."
