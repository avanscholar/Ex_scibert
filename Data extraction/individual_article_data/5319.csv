0,Introduction,"Due to their advanced physical, chemical and biological properties, the development of polymeric nanocomposite materials have gained wide attention for the applications of water treatment [1], corrosion inhibition and electronic devices [2]. The form and concentration of nanomaterials being involved into polymers composites and interaction between nanomaterial and polymer define the way they can be applied and their performance efficiency. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) Fe3O4 are well-known with their synergistic and advantageous properties as high mechanical stability, low thermal expansion, high thermal stability, high corrosion resistance and high thermal conductivity [3]. The structural arrangements of Fe3O4 in octahedral arrangements containing ferrous and ferric ions cause the coordinated electrons to be thermally delocalized within the structure resulting in high conductivity [4]. Furthermore, the electron delocalization effects in magnetite result in metal deficient occurrence at octahedral sites, which provides n- and p-type semiconductors in magnetite particles [4]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biocompatible non-toxic polymer, hydrophilic and has considerable chemical resistance. PVA was known to be of good barrier properties against gas and liquid permeation [5]. It can be easily applied in composite polymers formation forming biodegradable blends. Starch is a biodegradable polymer with high abundance and availability with lower cost than other synthetic polymers, and it has good ability for complete biodegradation with nontoxic residue [6]. Starch could be applied with other polymers to enhance their properties and decreases the production cost [7,8]. On the other hand, the usage of starch film without additives has the disadvantages of brittleness and high water absorption [9]. Therefore, the combination of PVA and starch has been proposed to gain advantageous properties [10–13]. Recent studies have been performed for determining the thermal stability and mechanical stability of PVA/starch composites with different nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene [14–16]. Studying the conductivity properties of polymeric materials was potentially considered as polymeric composites competing the conductive metals in their conductivity behavior. Polymeric materials having electrical conductivity have found wide applications and broad range of practical applications. The applications of conductive polymeric materials include conductive film coating, anti-static parts, shield materials and etc. [17–25]. PVA/starch blends were previously studied and that the weight ratio of 70:30 showed the optimum enhancement in mechanical and conductivity properties using glycerol as a plasticizer [12]. PVA/St composite blends with carbon nanotubes and graphene were studied for their thermomechanical properties [14–16]. The current study, maintain the preparation of PVA/St composite blends containing different concentration of as synthesized magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs). The prepared composite films were characterized using SEM, XRD and TGA/DSC for describing their surface characteristic and stability. Furthermore the electrical and dielectric properties were investigated with emphasis on the MNPs content in the composite films."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (molecular weight 27 000), glycerol and potato starch were provided from Sigma-Aldrich. Magnetite nanoparticles were prepared by alkaline precipitation of ferrous-ferric ions solution. Briefly, aqueous ferrite solution containing ferrous (FeSO4·7H2O) and ferric (FeCl3·6H2O) with 1:2 stoichiometric ratio was treated with 1 mol/L alkali solution (NaOH) till obtaining alkaline mixture with pH 12. The precipitated particles were washed with water till obtaining neutral wash solution. The obtained MNPs were removed via magnet, kept in oven at 70 °C till dyness, to be ready for preparation process."
3,Fabrication of polymer composite films,"2.2 Fabrication of polymer composite films The PVA/ST/MNPs films were fabricated following solution mixing with a modified casting evaporation procedure [26]. Fixed polymer content ratio for PVA:ST of 7:3 was used. Appropriate PVA was completely dissolved in deionized water followed by dispersion of the complementary weight of starch. After complete dispersion, (3 g) of glycerol was transferred to the reaction mixture. A varied amount of the prepared MNPs (varied content shown in Table 1 ) was dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for 30 min. The MNPs dispersion was mixed with the PVA/ST reaction mixture with continuous mechanical stirring for 4 h. The reaction container was nitrogen aerated for 10 min for removing the air bubbles. The casting solution was casted onto a glass sheets and air dried at 50 °C for 24 h. The composite films were pulled off the glass and the thickness were measured by digital caliber and stored in a desiccator to prevent moisture absorption."
4,Characterization of the prepared composite blends,2.3 Characterization of the prepared composite blends The XRD patterns for the film samples were recorded using Shimadzu Lab-XRD–6000 with CuKα radiation. The morphology and the elemental composition were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (JEOL 6340) fitted with Energy-dispersive X-ray unit (EDX). The thermal stability of composite blends was analyzed using a Shimadzu TGA-50H thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) under N2 flow of 20 mL/min. Differential scanning calorimeter Shimadzu DSC-60 was used for DSC analysis.
5,Conductivity measurements,"2.4 Conductivity measurements The film samples were prepared as pieces with thicknesses in the range of 0.3–0.4 mm. The film pieces with different MNPs concentrations were installed individually inside optical cryostat of type LN Oxford DN1704 equipped with quartz windows. A water filter was used to absorb the thermal effect of the white light from the tungsten lamp. The tungsten lamp was connected with aVariac to control the intensity of light. The steady state and transient photoconductivity measurements were performed using a programmable digital electrometer (Keithley 6517b) as a source of voltage and current meter, by using its programs for different measurements. The experimental set up and experiment details were explained elsewhere [27]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the prepared films,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared films The FTIR spectra of PVA/St and PVA/St-MNP composite blends with different concentration of MNP were given in Fig. 1 . The spectra showed an absorption peak at 3250–3350 cm−1 range was assigned to the stretching vibration of OH groups of starch and moisture content [28]. The peak at 2930 cm−1 could be assigned for the CH stretching vibration. The absorption peak at 1651 cm−1 could be assigned for the bound water, which indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding. This peak showed increased intensity in the spectra of samples containing MNP due to formation of hydrogen bond between MNP and the polymer. The two peaks at 1416 and 856 cm−1 were assigned to be due to the vibration of CH2 group. The peaks appeared at 1330 and 1030 cm−1 could be assigned for deformation of COC groups [28]. The SEM images of the prepared composite films are shown Fig. 2 . The SEM images of PVA/St-MNP show a smooth surface with homogeneous starch particle distribution and good MNPs particles dispersion. Additionally, no particles aggregation of MNPs and starch was observed. A continuous phase of MNPs was obtained as the conductive phase within the polymer matrix. The thermal stability of the prepared composite films was studied by TGA and DSC analysis. The TGA analysis of PVA/St and PVA/St-MNP composite film blends (Fig. 3 ) showed the first weight loss at 50−150 °C reached 10–25% in both compounds suggesting bound water evaporation. The second step of temperature range 200−480 °C showed a decrease in the weight loss for the PVA/St-MNP composite with increasing MNP concentration. The results clarify a significant increase in thermal stability for PVA/St-MNP composite than the PVA/St. This observation could be due to decrease in the mobility of the polymer chain and the formation of insulating layer of MNP, which decrease the polymer thermal decomposition. The chare yield also reflects increased thermal stability of the composite films of PVA/St-12%MNP compared to the PVA/St-%MNP [29]. The glass transition temperatures of PVA/St and PVA/St-MNP were determined from the DSC analysis. The results show slight decrease in glass transition temperature of PVA/St-MNP than PVA/St (Table 2 ). This could be attributed to the addition of both plasticizer and MNP. The presence of MNP increases the viscosity of the polymer due to certain interaction between polymer and MNP as it has been reported that the decrease of Tg refers to the occurrence of coordination between plasticizer and MNP. Also, certain hydrogen bonding may be formed between polymer and MNP [11,30,31]. The XRD patterns of MNPs, PVA/ST and PVA/ST/MNPs (Fig. 4 ) show that the major peaks of MNP 2θo of 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 53.4°,57.0°, and 62.6° which could be assigned for the crystal planes (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440), respectively. Therefore, it was confirmed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles have a cubic phase crystalline structure (JCPDS No. 19–629). The characteristic, strong and broad peak for PVA at around 2θ = 20° reflects the semi-crystalline nature and the orthorhombic lattice (101). In the XRD pattern of PVA/St-MNP either with 7% or 12% MNP concentrations a broad peak appeared between 20° and 25° for PVA reflecting the presence of certain bonding between PVA and St or PVA and MNPs. The decreased intensity of the characteristic peaks of MNP could be due to the decreased content and possible bonding as well."
8,Conductivity studies,"3.2 Conductivity studies The first step to study the photoconductivity is to start with examining the characteristics of dark and photo current density depending on the electric field. Seven samples of different MNPs concentrations (3–16%) including a blank sample (pure polymer of PVA/St) were studied. Fig. 5 (a–g) shows the relationship between dark and photo current density, which passed through the samples when the electric field is applied with different values up to 135 V/cm2. The figures show that both the dark and photocurrent current density linearly increase due to increasing the applied electric field within the studied range. The figures also showed that all samples were affected by white light as the current density increased significantly with increasing the intensity of the light, namely 120, 225, 490, 800 and 1300 lx. Fig. 6 (a and b) represent the dark and photoconductivity at different light intensity values versus MNPs contents from 0% to 16 %. The results showed that with increasing Fe3O4 content to 3%, both dark and photoconductivity increased 2-fold of the PVA/St. The dark and photo conductivity was found to steadily increase as Fe3O4 content increased up to12%. The dark and photoconductivity values increased 7-fold of the corresponding values of pure polymer. By increasing the MNP content to 16%, the dark and photo conductivity was found to decrease than the corresponding values of 12% concentration. It has been reported that the energy gap or the so called Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital–Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap of the polymer is the energy difference between the top of the valence band (HOMO) and the bottom of the conduction band (LUMO). It is known that this energy difference is the key factor describing the optical transitions [32]. The material of lower energy gap, is more electrically conductive than that of higher energy gap. The increased photo conductivity with increasing the MNPs concentrations could be explained due to the formation of charge transfer complexes and the formation of localized states in the HOMO-LUMO gap of PVA/ST/MNPs composite. The charge transfer complexes formed in the localized states causes a decrease in the optical energy gap as it increase the trapping and recombination centers and hence improves the transitions of low energy. The improvement in low energy transitions may cause also an improvement in the photoconductivity with increasing MNPs content [33]. It has been reported also that the disorder in the localized state within HOMO-LUMO gap of the composite increase with increasing the contents of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The increase in MNPs concentration causes an increase in the inter-atomic spacing [34], which intern decrease the energy gap and increase conductivity. The decrease in dark and photo conductivity with increasing the MNP content over 12% may be due to inhibition of complex formation in the localized state at higher MNPs concentrations. Photosensitivity is considered one of the important parameters in the optoelectronic devices. The photosensitivity (S) was calculated using Eq. 1: (1) S = σ p h σ d where σph and σd are the photoconductivity and dark electric conductivity, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the effect of MNP content in the polymer on the photosensitivity of the composite to white light. The photosensitivity value was found to be 1.35 and 5.22 at 120 and 3000 lx for PVA/St. These values increased with increasing the concentration of MNP in the composite blends and reached 3.92, 12 at the light intensity 120, 3000 lx respectively for composite blend with 12% MNP. The results also showed a significant decrease in sensitivity of the blend with 16% MNP. It was found that the sample with 12% MNP concentration have high sensitivity to white light as well as higher photoconductivity. The photocurrent was presented against the light intensity for the seven prepared samples (Fig. 8 ). The results in the figure clarify that the photocurrent increases linearly with light intensity increases, which could be explained as result of producing greater free charge carriers. The photocurrent-light intensity relation was found to fit the power law Iph α Fγ; where the constant γ defines the recombination behavior. The values of the constant γ were found to be within 0.55–0.60, referring to a monomolecular recombination process in the samples. These results confirm that the MNPs are distributed continuously in the forbidden gap [35]. The presence of impurities in the forbidden gap may lead to change of the carrier lifetime to differential lifetime. The presence of these impurities and their impact on lifetime requires the study transient photoconductivity. Fig. 9 shows the photoconductivity dependency on time at room temperature. During the first five seconds, the samples were exposed to 500 lx white light. Then the light was cut off for four seconds and the photoconductivity was recorded. The rise of the photocurrent starts with a fast rate due to the generation of photo-carriers, and then it becomes slow. This behavior due to impurities levels in the specimens which might call traps filling carriers. The decay starts rapidly due to the recombination process and, later, the recombination became slow [36]. The results show that the photoconductivity has non-exponential behavior in rise and decay. This result confirms the impact of traps on lifetime. Since the presence of traps makes the carrier lifetime to be longer, so the time defined as differential life time. Fig. 9b shows the photoconductivity decay of pure polymer and the samples which have different values of MNP nanoparticles. The photoconductivity exhibits an initial fast decay due to the recombination of the free carriers, thereafter; the decay becomes slow due to the recombination of the trapped carriers. By increasing the Fe3O4 the photoconductivity decay spends less time indicating the defects become less affected. However, at 16% Fe3O4, the behavior is reversed, i.e the defects become more affected. The carrier differential lifetime can be expressed by the Fuhs concept as follow [37]: (2) τ d = - σ p h ( max ) . ( d σ p h d t ) - 1 where is σph(max) is the photoconductivity with which the decay starts at t = 0 and dσph/dt is the decay rate The results show that the differential lifetime (called response time) is highly dependence on the Fe3O4 content which is equal to σ p h ( max ) / e [38]. The effect of Fe3O4 content in the polymer on carrier life time is shown in Fig. 9b, which has been calculated at the beginning of decay curves [39]. Fig. 10 a,b showed that both life time and differential life time decreases with increasing the Fe3O4 content in the polymer and increases strongly at the concentration of 16%. The distribution of impurities in the polymer due to the increase of Fe3O4 content plays an important role in explaining the change in life time values or differential life time of current carriers."
9,Conclusion,"The current study showed that the prepared polymer blend composite could be a semiconductor polymer and photoconductor as well. The inclusion of magnetite nanoparticles has increased the electrical and photoconductivity and has also increased the photosensitivity. The MNP was found to greatly affect the current density and the photo sensitivity of the composite films towards white light. The sample containing 12% MNP showed the highest photo sensitivity of 14 at 1300 lx. The results of photoconductivity and light intensity confirmed the existence of traps in the composite films. Based on the transient photoconductivity study; the life time and differential life time were determined to be within the range 0.67–0.78 and 3.7–457 S. respectively. The composite blend containing 12% MNP showed promising results in the optoelectronic applications as it has high photo sensitivity to white light, high photocurrent and showed the lowest values of life time. These results render the composite film (PVA/St-12% MNP) could be a very important candidate for practical applications."
