0,Introduction,"The idea of utilizing CO2 as a raw material for synthesis of useful chemicals, fuels, and renewable energy can contribute to solve global warming and climate change problems [1–4]. Hydrogenation of CO2 is an interesting reaction which can produce value-added chemical feedstock and high quality clean energy with no sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, and also lead to the process sustainability as well [5,6]. Most of the researches reported that the main product of CO2 hydrogenation was methane (CH4), while relatively low amounts of small alcohols were produced. Due to the economic value and broad industrial utilization, alcohols are much higher potential chemicals regarding their significance in energy production and carbon dioxide consumption [7,8]. In order to improve alcohol productivity and enhance catalytic activity in CO2 hydrogenation, many variables such as types of metal, promoter, support, and catalyst preparation technique have to be considered. Generally, metal catalysts (e.g., Rh, Pd, Ru, Cu, Fe, Co, Ni) over several metal oxide supports (e.g., Nb2O3, ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2) have been widely used for CO2 hydrogenation reaction [8–12]. Among these, Cu-based catalysts were highly active and selective for methanol production [13–16]. However, the major competitive pathway of methanol synthesis is reverse water–gas-shift (RWGS) reaction [17,18]. In this reaction, CO2 and H2 are converted to CO which can further react with H2 to alcohols and hydrocarbons through Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction [19,20]. In order to modify the catalyst for both RWGS and FTS reactions, it could be expected that Fe catalyst can improve CO conversion and enhance selectivity to alcohols and hydrocarbons [2,21–23]. Furthermore, the catalyst support is one of the key factors that should be considered since it can increase the probability for surface reaction. MCM-41 mesoporous silica is attractive to use as the catalyst support in CO2 hydrogenation regarding its long-range, ordered hexagonal structure, and high surface area [24,25]. In this research, the effects of pore characteristics of supports including unimodal and bimodal pore structures, loading amount of Fe, and reaction temperature on the catalytic performance were investigated. Unimodal and bimodal MCM-41 mesoporous silica supports were synthesized by using sodium silicate hydrate (Na2SiO3) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as silica sources. Accordingly, Fe (0, 0.5, and 3wt.%) and Cu (10wt.%) loaded on the bimodal MCM-41 (T) was tested for CO2 hydrogenation in a fixed bed reactor at reaction temperatures of 250–350°C and pressure of 10bar, and compared to that of the unimodal MCM-41 (SS). We proposed that the bimodal pore characteristics of MCM-41 support could significantly increase the performance of catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation MCM-41 mesoporous silica supports used in this experiment were synthesized from two silica sources including sodium silicate hydrate (Na2SiO3: 32wt.% SiO2) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and were denoted as MCM-41 (SS) and MCM-41 (T), respectively. The former was synthesized by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) as a template. The synthesis procedure is as follows: CTAC of 25.287g was dissolved in 40mL deionized water. Consecutively, 14.658g of sodium silicate hydrate was mixed with 40mL deionized water and then added dropwise into CTAC solution while maintained a constant pH value of 6.5 under stirring with the molar composition of the gel mixture as follows: 1.0 SiO2: 0.2 CTAC: 75 H2O. After continuous stirring for 5h, the pH of mixture was adjusted to 11.25 and kept stirring for 1h. Then the obtained gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 100°C for 24h. After that the solid product was filtered and washed with deionized water, dried at 100°C for 24h, and calcined in air at 550°C for 4h. The latter, MCM-41 (T) was synthesized by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a template. CTAB solution was prepared by dissolving 1.210g of CTAB in 48mL deionized water, followed by adding 3.708mL TEOS and 0.5mL NH4OH solution into CTAB solution. The mixture with molar composition of 1.0 TEOS: 0.2 CTAB: 160 H2O: 1.5 NH3 was stirred continuously at 50°C for 24h. The resulting gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100°C for 24h. After that the solid product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 100°C and then calcined in air at 550°C for 4h. Fe (0, 0.5, and 3wt.%) and Cu (10wt.%) loaded on MCM-41 supports was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. Certain amount of both iron nitrate nanohydrate (Fe(NO3)3 .9H2O) and copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O) used as precursors were mixed with deionized water and dropped into 1g of MCM-41 supports. After that the mixture was dried with microwave at 800 watt for 1min, and then calcined in air at 550°C for 4h. The obtained catalysts were denoted as xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T, SS), where x and 10 represented weight percentage of Fe and Cu loading, T and SS denoted as tetraethyl orthosilicate and sodium silicate hydrate."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The surface area and pore size distribution of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T, SS) catalysts and MCM-41 (T, SS) supports were characterized by N2 physisorption using Quantachrome Autosorp-1C instrument with BET and BJH methods at −196°C. The diffractograms of MCM-41 mesoporous silica supports and the crystallographic structures of catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD: JEOL JDX-3530 and Philips X-Pert) using Cu Kα radiation at low angle in the 2θ range of 0–10°, and high angle in the 2θ range of 5–60°, respectively. Morphology and external structure of the supports were analyzed by using transmission electron microscope (TEM: JEOL JEM-2010) with the acceleration voltage of 200kV. The samples were prepared by suspending in ethanol and then dispersing on a copper grid coated with a carbon film. The FT-IR spectra of the catalysts were recorded in the range of 4000–400cm−1 at room temperature using FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker: TENSOR 27) equipped with DTGS detector. The samples diluted by KBr (weight ratio of 1:100) were pressed into a disc form before analysis. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were performed at 25–500°C and heating rate of 5°C/min in a continuous flow apparatus using a stainless steel (SUS-316, O.D. 3/8”) tubular reactor, where the mixture of H2 and argon (>99.9% purity) was fed into the catalyst bed in order to investigate the reduction temperature of metal catalysts. H2 consumptions were monitored by using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
4,Performance of xFe–10Cu loaded on MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports on CO2 hydrogenation reaction,"2.3 Performance of xFe–10Cu loaded on MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports on CO2 hydrogenation reaction In order to examine the performance of catalysts with different support structures and loading amounts of Fe, 0.5g of each catalyst was mixed with 2.0g of silicon dioxide (SiO2: granulation of 0.075–0.4mm) to avoid hot spots and pressure drop across bed, and packed in the stainless steel (SUS-316, O.D. 3/8”) tubular reactor. Prior to each experiment, the catalyst was activated reducing in H2 atmosphere of (99.99%) at a flow rate of 60ml/min and temperature of 400°C for 3h. After the catalyst activation, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and then the reactant gases (CO2 and H2 with molar ratio of 1:3) were introduced into the reactor. The catalyst temperature was then increased to the range of 160–350°C at the total pressure of 10bar. The obtained products were analyzed by using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 analysis using Unibead-C packed column and argon (>99.9% purity) as the carrier gas and Shimadzu GC-8A with flame ionization detector (FID) to quantify C1–C4 hydrocarbons using a Porapak-Q packed column. For the latter, helium (99.995% purity) was used as the carrier gas while H2 and air were used as the combustion gas for flame ionization detection. The mixture of 25wt.% CO, 25wt.% CO2, 25wt.% CH4 (in H2 balance) was used as standards calibration gas for CO x , H2, and CH4 analysis. The mixture of 5wt.% CH4, 5wt.% C2H4, 5wt.% C2H6, 5wt.% C3H6, 5wt.% C3H8, 5wt.% i-C4H10, 5wt.% n-C4H10, 5wt.% CO, 5wt.% CO2 (in He balance) and the mixture of 20vol.% CH3OH, 20vol.% C2H5OH (in C3H7OH balance) were used for hydrocarbon analysis. The gas hourly space velocity of total reactants (GHSV) was maintained at 4800mLh−1 gcat−1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural and chemical characteristics of MCM-41 supports and catalysts,"3.1 Textural and chemical characteristics of MCM-41 supports and catalysts BET specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore size of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 catalysts and MCM-41 supports were summarized in Table 1 . BET surface areas of MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports were 870m2/g and 1259m2/g, respectively. It was found that MCM-41 (T) had 1.45 times lower surface area than that of MCM-41 (SS) due to the fact that MCM-41 (T) displayed bimodal pore sizes which the smaller pore size of 2.7nm was equal to that of MCM-41 (SS), whereas the larger pore size was 30.5nm. The sorption isotherms and pore size distributions shown in Fig. S1 also clearly confirmed the existence of bimodal pore for MCM-41 (T) and unimodal pore for MCM-41 (SS). Moreover, it is obvious that total pore volume of MCM-41 (T) support (2.4m3/g) was much higher than that of MCM-41 (SS) (1.6m3/g). In the case of Fe and Cu loaded on MCM-41 supports, BET specific surface area of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts was slightly increased, probably caused by the relatively small size of copper oxide species (diameter of 17.9–21.9nm, calculated from XRD patterns) deposited on the larger pore of MCM-41 (T), leading to smaller mean pore diameter, while that of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts was decreased. For total pore volumes of xFe–10Cu loaded on both MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS), they were much decreased when compared with MCM-41 supports. A decrease of specific surface area and pore volume after metals loaded on supports might occur from metals entered into and plugged some pores during the impregnation process [26–28]. Considering pore size between xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts and MCM-41 (T) support, the result showed that the smaller pore size of xFe–Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts was almost constant while the larger pore size was decreased from 30.5nm to 17.1–17.5nm since Cu and Fe metals possibly deposited inside the larger mesopore of MCM-41 (T). However, for xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts, no significant effect from metals on the pore size of catalysts (2.4–2.7nm) was observed. From the above results, MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports synthesized by using different silica sources and synthesis procedures exhibited different physical properties, especially pore diameter and specific surface area. Thus, TEM micrographs and low angle X-ray diffraction patterns were used to confirm the structure of MCM-41 mesoporous silica as shown in Fig. 1 . In the case of MCM-41 (SS) (Fig. 1(a)), a long-range, ordered hexagonal structure was observed. Moreover, from the low angle XRD pattern, a major peak of MCM-41 (SS) at 2θ of 2.4° and two small peaks at 4.3° and 4.8°, corresponding to three reflections planes including (100), (110), and (200), respectively clearly indicated the long-range, ordered hexagonal structure of mesoporous MCM-41 (SS). This was in good agreement with the TEM image; the similar result of MCM-41 (SS) structure had been reported by Jomekian et al. [29] and Teabpinyok et al. [25]. On contrary, short-range hexagonal structure was obtained with that of MCM-41 (T) from TEOS (Fig. 1(b)). Considered the XRD pattern of MCM-41 (T), a major peak shifted to 2θ lower than that of MCM-41 (SS). This result indicated that MCM-41 (T) composed of relatively larger pore size than that of MCM-41 (SS), corresponding to the N2-sorption data as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, no reflections at higher angles were observed on MCM-41 (T), indicating that the long-range, ordered hexagonal pore structure in this support was significantly reduced [30]. This short-range hexagonal pore structure of MCM-41 (T) was formed due to the excess amount of positively charged cationic surfactants [31] not only acted as the surfactant leaving the hexagonal 2D pore structure in the silica matrix but also encapsulated and cut the silica matrix into smaller clusters, leading to the interconnected channels between these smaller silica clusters with the pore opening of approximately 30nm. The FT-IR spectra of 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) and 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) are shown in Fig. 2 . The broad peak of adsorption band around 3500cm−1 represented a characteristic of O–H stretching in mesostructured silica, while the peak around 1630cm−1 was attributed to the deformation vibration of adsorbed water. A strong and broad band at 1000–1250cm−1 and also small bands around 780 and 460cm−1 revealed the asymmetric stretching vibration of Si–O–Si groups. The peak at 966cm−1 indicated a stretching vibration of oxygen atoms not bridging two Si atoms resulting from Si–O- and Si–OH [32,33]. These observations indicated the similar functional groups between xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) and xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts. The information including crystalline phases, types of metal species and average metal oxide crystallite size of the catalysts were investigated by using wide angle XRD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 , all the catalysts exhibited similar diffraction patterns at 2θ of 35.7°, 38.9°, 49.1°, 53.7° and 58.6° which were attributed to CuO. The crystallite sizes calculated from the diffraction peak intensity by Scherrer equation are listed in Table 1. It was found that CuO particle size in all catalysts was almost constant (17.9–21.9nm) and the amount of Fe (0.5–3wt.%) loaded on MCM-41 (SS) and MCM-41 (T) supports did not affect the copper oxide crystallite size. In addition, among all the catalysts listed in Table 1, the crystallite sizes of CuO were larger than the hexagonal pore diameter of MCM-41 supports. It implied that copper oxide particles were located on the outer surface of MCM-41 (SS), whereas they were inserted between the silica clusters in the case of MCM-41 (T). From the XRD patterns of all catalysts, no characteristic diffraction peaks of FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 were observed due to the fact that iron species were finely dispersed on MCM-41 and their contents in the samples were too low to detect by XRD technique. In order to clarify the reduction behavior and interaction between active metals and the supports, TPR measurements were performed as the result shown in Fig. 4 . It was found that xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 catalysts (except 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T)) exhibited only one reduction peak at 261.8–284.1°C which was attributed to a single step reduction of crystalline CuO and Fe2O3 phases. Similar result of CuO reduction had previously reported by Liu et al. [34], which only a single reduction peak was observed when CuO content was less than 30%. In addition, due to the reduction peak of iron oxide species appeared at the same position of CuO (in the temperature range of 150–350°C), the amount of H2 uptake calculated from reduction peak intensity the reduction peak intensity was therefore increased proportional to the increase of Fe loading. As shown in Table 2 , H2 uptake was increased from 4.51 to 5.31mmolgcat−1 for xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) and from 3.51 to 4.23mmolgcat−1 for xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) when the loading amount of Fe was increased. However, the broad band of H2 consumption for 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) could be deconvoluted into two peaks, attributed to the reduction of different metal species. It should be noted that iron oxide species were reduced at lower temperature as 205.9°C, whereas CuO species were reduced at higher temperature as 255.9°C. Among all the catalysts, it was clearly seen that the increase of Fe doping amounts resulted in the shift of reduction peak to lower temperature. This was in good agreement with the result of Bao et al. [35] and Zhang et al. [36]that the incorporation of Fe with Cu component remarkably enhanced the reducibility of Fe2O3 and could dramatically decrease the reduction temperature of Fe3O4 to Fe° as well [37,38]. Comparing the metals-support interaction on MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS), it was found that xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts required lower reduction temperature owing to their weak interaction and better dispersion of mixed Fe–Cu oxide on the supports than those of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS). Therefore, it was suggested that the suitable reduction temperature of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 catalysts was 400°C to completely reduce the catalysts to active forms of Fe° and Cu°, respectively."
7,Performance of xFe–10Cu loaded on MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports for CO2 hydrogenation reaction,"3.2 Performance of xFe–10Cu loaded on MCM-41 (T) and MCM-41 (SS) supports for CO2 hydrogenation reaction CO2 hydrogenation reaction was carried out in the catalytic fixed bed reactor at total pressure of 10bar to investigate the effects of pore characteristics of supports including unimodal MCM-41 (SS) and bimodal MCM-41 (T) pore structures, loading amounts of Fe, and reaction temperatures. As the result of CO2 conversion illustrated in Fig. 5 , it can be seen that CO2 conversion of all catalysts was significantly enhanced as the reaction temperature increased. At reaction temperature lower than 200°C, all the catalysts exhibited similar catalytic activity. However, at temperature higher than 200°C, the modification of 10Cu/MCM-41 with Fe metal could promote CO2 conversion as the highest CO2 conversion of 20.8% was observed over 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalyst at reaction temperature of 350°C. Based on the same loading amount of Fe, it was observed that CO2 conversion of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) was higher than that of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) at all reaction temperatures. Product selectivities were shown in Fig. 6 . With 10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalyst, C1–C4 were selectively formed at the reaction temperature between 160 and 240°C while DME and alcohols were obtained in the temperature range of 240–275°C. Considered 10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalyst, C2–C4 and alcohols were favorably formed in the temperature range of 180–240°C and 240–275°C, respectively. Moreover, the addition of Fe on both the 10Cu/MCM-41 (T) and 10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts led to high selectivity to alcohol at lower reaction temperature as 40–60°C. When compared the reaction temperature between xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) and xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts, the highest alcohol selectivity over xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) was shifted to lower reaction temperature (160–200°C). Comparing alcohol selectivity of this research to other literatures [13,39-42] as shown in Table S1, 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) showed higher alcohol selectivity (54.4–99.9%) at lower reaction temperature (160–220°C) than those of other works. This result indicated that 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) was effective for methanol and ethanol production since the lower metal loading and reaction temperature were applied. Among these catalysts, it was noticed that at low reaction temperature (160–250°C), the reaction led to methanol synthesis (as shown in Eq. (1)) which is an exothermic process [14]. When the temperature was increased to above 220°C, methanol selectivity was decreased due to the fact that CO occurred through reverse water shift (RWGS) reaction [9] (as shown in Eq. (2)) which is endothermic process. It can be concluded that both methanol synthesis and RWGS were sensitive to the reaction temperature since methanol synthesis was favored at low temperature while RWGS was favored at high temperature. (1) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ⇌ CH 3 OH + H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = - 49.8 kJ mol - 1 (2) CO 2 + H 2 ⇌ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = 41 kJ mol - 1 Regarding a correlation between activities and physical properties of catalysts, xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts exhibited the higher surface area, on contrary, the lower catalytic activity than those xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts. In order to further confirm that the bimodal MCM-41 (T) support could promote the catalytic activity of metals, pore volumes corresponding to each pore sizes and H2 chemisorption results of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 catalysts were investigated and related to CO2 conversion. As shown in Table 1, the volume of larger pore diameter of MCM-41 (T) support (1.79m3/g) was much higher than that of smaller pore (0.61m3/g). When xFe–10Cu was loaded on MCM-41 (T), the pore volume of larger pore diameter was remarkably decreased due to the fact that metals were deposited inside the larger pore of MCM-41 (T), resulting in the larger metal size and lower metal–support interaction. From H2 chemisorption results as shown in Table 2, H2 uptake of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts (3.51–4.23mmolgcat−1) was obviously less than those of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts (4.51–5.31mmolgcat−1) due to less metal–support interaction, and lower amount of active Cu and Fe atoms on the surface of bimodal MCM-41 (T) support. Considering the catalytic activity in term of turnover frequency (TOF) at the reaction temperature corresponding to the highest alcohols and CO selectivities (200 and 275°C, respectively), the result was shown in Table 2. It was found that xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalysts were selective to alcohols and CO more than those of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts. The highest TOF of alcohols and CO (1.08×10−25 and 5.47×10−25 molsurface metal atom−1 min−1) were obtained over 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalyst which was approximately 2 times higher than that over 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalyst (0.43×10−25 and 2.88×10−25 molsurface metal atom−1min−1). This result indicated that the high CO2 conversion and product selectivities over 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalyst were strongly attributed to the high active Cu and Fe atoms on bimodal MCM-41 (T). In this case, pore characteristics of the support strongly affected the catalytic activity. The larger mesopore of MCM-41 (T) support could greatly enhance the catalytic performance of xFe–10Cu metals compared to that of the unimodal smaller mesopore structure of MCM-41 (SS) support. It should be noted that the larger pore of MCM-41 (T) led to the formation of metals with larger sizes, and therefore the less interaction between active metals and support were found. Accordingly, the outstanding activities of Fe and Cu atoms were observed."
8,Conclusion,"Bimodal MCM-41 (T) mesoporous silica was successfully synthesized by using tetraethyl orthosilicate as a silica source via sol–gel synthesis. The obtained MCM-41 (T) support displayed two different sizes of pore, where larger pore diameter was 30.5nm and smaller pore diameter of MCM-41 (T) (2.7nm) was similar to that of MCM-41 (SS). It was found that both catalytic activities and product selectivities of xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) and xFe–10Cu/MCM-41 (SS) catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reaction were strongly affected by pore characteristics of supports. Fe and Cu loaded on MCM-41 (T) with bimodal smaller and larger mesopore exhibited the higher CO2 conversion (1.2–2.1 times) and were selective to alcohol at the reaction temperature of 20°C lower than those of MCM-41 (SS) due to the high active Cu and Fe surface atoms. Among all the catalysts, the highest CO2 conversion of 20.8% was observed over 3Fe–10Cu/MCM-41 (T) catalyst at the reaction temperature of 350°C."
