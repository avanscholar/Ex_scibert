0,Introduction,"In recent few years, the scarcity of fossil fuels has caused a global energy crisis. Various types of pollutants which affects the environment and responsible for the hazardous effect on a living organism. In order to overcome this problem, various energy sources and materials have been gradually developed. Hydrogen is considered as one of the substitutes to traditional fossil energy due to its high burning and clean energy source [1–4] . In 1972, Fujishima and Honda [5] done photocatalytic H2 production through water splitting. Photocatalytic H2 evolution using semiconductor materials is considered as a potential approach to resolving the present energy crisis and ecological problems [6–10] . Several semiconductor metal oxides are used for photocatalytic hydrogen production. ZnO and TiO2 are used as the main catalyst material for decontamination of organic pollutants, but the main drawback of these materials are absorption region limited only to ultraviolet region. TiO2 one of the most famous semiconductor material, owing to his better stability in aqueous and acidic medium, and nontoxic in nature [11–13] . TiO2 mainly exist in the three crystalline phases namely anatase, rutile and brookite. Rutile and anatase are the normally used photocatalysis, while rutile phase is more stable than anatase phase, but the rutile exhibits poor photoactivity than the anatase phase, this may be due to the conduction band position of anatase is more negative than rutile, so anatase TiO2 is more suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen production [14,15]. Hou et al. prepared TiO2 nanocrystal via alcohol thermal method and tested the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity [16]. Wang et al. prepared the anatase and rutile TiO2 of single crystal structure by a facile hydrolysis method and studied the possible photocatalytic mechanism of TiO2 with mixed crystal structure [17]. Hu et al. synthesized ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets from the titanate sheets using a gas-assisted liquid exfoliation method and combined with hydrogenation treatment strategy and shows that fast photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 540.7 μmol h−1 (30 mg catalyst) [18] . In this research work, we have prepared highly crystalline TiO2 photocatalyst by the inexpensive, simple, chemical hydrothermal route. The effect of deposition temperature on structural, morphological, optical and catalytic properties are studied. The prepared TiO2 catalyst is used to study photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under ultraviolet illumination."
1,Experimental,"For preparation of TiO2 photocatalyst 0.1 M titanium isopropoxide is dissolved in 50 mL ethanol and prepared precursor solution transferred into Teflon and kept into furnace for different deposition temperature 140, 160 and 180 °C. The prepared samples are annealed at 450 °C and characterized by different characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The prepared catalyst is used to study photocatalytic H2 evolution under ultraviolet illumination."
2,Catalyst characterization,"2.1 Catalyst characterization The deposited thin films were characterized by the, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), UV–vis spectroscopy, techniques. The structural characterization of deposited thin films was carried out, by using the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from a Bruker D2 Phaser in the range of 20–60°. The morphological characterization of the films was studied by using a JEOL JSM-6360 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The optical absorption study was carried out using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu: UV-1800) in the wavelength range 100–900 nm. The Fourier transform Raman (FT- Raman) spectra of the films were recorded in the spectral range of 100–550 cm−1 using a FT-Raman spectrometer (Bruker Multi RAM, Germany) that employs Nd:YAG laser source with an excitation wavelength 1064 nm."
3,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution A gas closed circulation system is used to study the photocatalytic H2 evolution for all for TiO2 samples. The photocatalytic H2 evolution study is done under ultraviolet light (420 nm, 300 W Xenon lamp) illumination. TiO2 photocatalyst was dispersed in 60 mL high-purity water containing 0.5 mol L−1 Na2S and 0.4 mol L−1 Na2SO3. Before ultraviolet irradiation, 0.6 wt% Pt was added on TiO2 photocatalyst using photo deposition technique. The volume of H2 liberated was determined by using a gas chromatography technique."
4,Results and discussion,"The formation of TiO2 material is confirmed with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD pattern TiO2 catalyst deposited at 140, 160 and 180 °C deposition temperature. From XRD pattern it is seen that the deposited TiO2 thin film polycrystalline nature. As deposition temperature increases the intensity of (1 0 1) peak increases with increase in deposition temperature. This type nature observed due to the increase in crystallinity of the film with deposition temperature [19]. The XRD pattern shows three sharp peaks at (1 0 1), (0 0 4), and (2 0 0). The matching of observed and standard d values using the JCPDS card No. 01-075-1537 confirms the tetragonal crystal structure of TiO2 [20]. Anatase phase of TiO2 exhibits better catalytic activity as compared to the rutile and brookite. Also, it confirms the no any other secondary phase is formed. From XRD graph, the crystallite size is determined using Scherer's equation [21] , (1) D = 0.9 λ β cos θ where the wavelength of the X ray source is ‘λ’ = 1.54 Å, ‘β’ is the FWHM of the peak and θ is the angle. Higher peak (1 0 1) intensity is observed for sample deposited at 160 °C. For more intense peak (1 0 1) crystallite size found to be 42 nm for material deposited at 160 °C. Structure and symmetry of TiO2 catalyst is studied with the help Raman spectroscopy [22]. FT-Raman spectrum of TiO2 film presented in Fig. 2 (b). From the Raman spectrum it is seen that there are four different Raman peaks with different Raman intensity. The presence of peaks at 142 cm−1, 197 cm−1, 397 cm−1, 519 cm−1, which confirms the formation of anatase phase of TiO2. The anatase phase shows higher catalytic efficiency as compared to rutile and brookite phases because anatase phase is more stable at room temperature [23]. To find out the chemical composition of prepared sample the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy study has been carried out [24]. The EDS plot deposited TiO2 thin film is shown in Fig. 1(c). The prepared TiO2 sample composed of Ti and O elements, no other impurity element is found. Table 1 shows the EDS data of TiO2 photocatalyst deposited at 160 °C by hydrothermal route. In support with XRD and Raman results EDS study also confirms the formation of material. SEM study was conducted to observe the surface morphology of prepared sample. Fig. 1(d and e) shows SEM micrographs of TiO2 thin film prepared at 160 °C substrate temperature. The surface morphology study shows that the substrate surface is covered nanogranules. The size of the granule is in the range of nanometers. Such morphology is useful for diffusion of liquid into nanogranules and hence more redox sites is available redox reaction and therefore enhancing catalytic performance [25]. Fig. 1(f) presents the band gap plot of TiO2 thin film prepared at different deposition temperature. From fig. it is seen that better absorption in the ultraviolet region. The Tauc equation is used to calculate the band gap of the prepared catalyst [26], (2) α hv = A hv - E g n The α and hν denotes the light absorption factor and the photon energy, respectively and A is constant, Eg is the band gap energy between the two bands i.e. conduction and valance band and n is the diffraction command. By inducing linear fragment to the energy axis at α = 0 and the band gap determined. The band gap energy of films deposited at 140 °C is 3.34 eV, at 160 °C is 3.43 eV & at 180 °C is 3.39 eV. This value of band gap energy is slightly greater than the value of energy reported for single crystal TiO2, and comparable with earlier reported values for spray deposited TiO2 thin films. The observed difference in the band gap energy is due to stoichiometric differences in the TiO2 films deposited at different deposition temperatures [27]."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution study,"The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of TiO2 thin film deposited different substrate temperature as shown Fig. 2(a). To test the enhanced H2 evolution activity was eventually observed due to the good crystallinity of TiO2 with deposition temperature. From the plot it is observed that, the catalytic H2 liberation rate of sample TiO2 deposited at 160 °C shows better performance as compared to samples prepared at 140 and 180 °C. As the deposition temperature increases the H2 production rate increases and then decreases this happen due to the change in the stoichiometry, crystallinity of the material with respect to temperature [28]. The maximum H2 liberation amount getting from the TiO2 sample deposited at 160 °C is found to be 79.1 µmol g−1 h−1, which was about double and high for the sample deposited 140 (34.9 µmol g−1 h−1) and 160 °C (52.2 µmol g−1 h−1), correspondingly. The detailed study of H2 liberation for sample deposited at 160 °C were noted and shown in Fig. 2(b). From the plot it is observed that hydrogen production rate increases slowly during light illumination and decreases afterward cycles. During every catalytic reaction cycle hydrogen generation amount tends to increase with prolonging reaction time. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate for TiO2 sample deposited at 160 °C found to be 79.1 µmol g−1 h−1 after each 9 h cycle. This type phenomenon can be explained on the basis of interfacial action, charge transfer process etc. [27]."
6,Conclusions,"From the above research study, it is seen that TiO2 photocatalyst is produced by easy, simple, chemical hydrothermal route. The structural, optical, surface and composition investigation shows that prepared material has better crystallinity, and presence all expected elements in their desirable chemical states. Optical study shows that absorbance lies in the ultraviolet region. From above all results confirm the TiO2 photocatalyst are good, efficient and show high catalytic for H2 production. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate for the TiO2 sample deposited at 160 °C is found to be 79.1 µmol g−1 h−1 after each 9 h cycle. We can conclude that the prepared TiO2 photocatalyst exhibit good durability and high photocatalytic activity."
