0,Introduction,"Clean energy usage and water supply security are two essential factors for the global sustainable development of human beings [1–5]. Photothermal catalysis can achieve a solar‐powered heat generation and then drive a catalyst surface chemical reaction, i.e. degradation of water pollutants, hydrogen (H2) evolution, and CO2 reduction, which offers a promising eco‐friendly alternative to conventional comsumpion of fossil fuels [6–12]. H2 as an ideal energy storage and carrier medium is considered to be one of the most promising candidate to replace fossil energy [13]. Among numerous technologies, solar-driven H2 production from water is a potential strategy to alleviate the energy crisis [14]. Unfortunately, rapid heat loss and fast charge carrier recombination seriously affect its solar energy utilization and solar‐to‐hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. To achieve high STH conversion efficiency, photo-thermal catalytic synergistic reaction is a research hotspot in the energy and environmental fields, especially, for H2 generation and pollutant removal or organic synthesis [15–17]. In the process of H2 production, artificial addition of electron donors (e.g., alcohols, acids, and amines) as sacrificial agents to scavenge photo-induced holes is not considered environmentally friendly and desirable. Therefore, a more advisable method is to use organic pollutants in water as in situ electron donors. Moreover, regulating the micro‐/nanostructure of catalyst based on the targeted photothermal applications has recently attracted great attention as an effective strategy for realizing excellent catalytic performance [18–20]. Especially, core/yolk–shell, hollow/multishell‐structured nanoreactors with large surface areas, superior light scattering, fast charge transport, and abundant active sites have been widely applied in solar energy conversion [21–26]. Most recently, frame‐like structures display similar favorable features and tunable mass/heat transport for catalytic reactions [27–32]. Therefore, combining the merits of above advanced structures may further improve the photo-thermal catalytic activity. Synthesis methods based on carbon spheres have been proved valid for the preparation of hollow-/multi-shelled and frame‐like structures [33–35]. The tunable surface compositions of carbon spheres provide great flexibility for the design of catalysts with desired features. Inspired by above considerations, we demonstrate the design and synthesis of C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe (MNF) by a facile and cost-effective two‐step adsorption-calcination approach (Fig. S1) for simultaneous photo-thermal catalytic H2 generation and RhB removal. Carbon nanosphere (CS) was chosen as the frame template, and TiCl4 aqueous solution was utilized as the Ti source in a facile adsorption-calcination synthesis of multishell nanoframe photo-thermal catalyst. Mechanism exploration reveals that the difference between the inner and outer gas pressure formed inside C@TiO2 precursor facilitates the selective cleavage of outer TiO2 layers at selected temperatures during calcination. Synergistic effects between residual CS and multi-shelled TiO2 framework endow C@TiO2 MNF with excellent heat confinement and vibrant photocarrier kinetics, leading to excellent photo-thermal conversion for synchronous superior photocatalytic H2 evolution (503 μmol g-1h−1) and 98.2% RhB removal without using any co-catalyst and sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5G). This work enhances the availability of photo-generated electrons and holes, and provides a dual-functional photo-thermal catalytic system for H2 production along with the simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and rhodamine B (RhB) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). All chemicals were of analytical grade (A.R.) and used as received. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm, Millipore) was used for all synthesis and subsequent catalytic tests."
3,Synthesis of C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe,"2.2 Synthesis of C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe The preparation of carbonaceous nanosphere (CS) was reported in our previous paper [36,37]. A 3D C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe (MNF) was synthesized by soaking 1.0 g of fresh-prepared CS in 50 mL of 3 M TiCl4 aqueous solution and then aged for 24 h in a 40 °C water bath under stirring followed by filtration, washing, and drying at 60 °C for 12 h, and then it was heated to 450 °C in air at a heating rate of 7 °C min−1 and held for 30 min, yielding a gray powdered product C@TiO2 MNF. To convert C@TiO2 MNF to TiO2 MNF, the obtained powders were further heated at 500 °C (2 °C min−1) for 120 min."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Morphologies of C@TiO2 MNF were observed by TEM (JEM2100F, JEOL) and FESEM (JSM-6700F, JEOL). HAADF-STEM images were obtained on a JEOL JSM-6700F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Crystal phase was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Ragiku). Raman spectra were measured on a confocal Raman spectrometer (inVia Qontor, Renishaw). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed at a TGA/DSC 1/1600 Mettler Toledo analyzer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were analysed on a Nicolet AVATAR 330 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were implemented on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher) instrument. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurement was conducted on a UV–vis spectrometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). Light-induced temperature variations and thermal images of catalysts were monitored by using an infrared imaging device (VarioCAM HD, InfraTec). Surface photovoltage/photocurrent (SPV/SPC) were measured with monochromatic light source (CHF-XM500W, PerfectLight) through grating monochromator (Omni-λ300, Zolix) and lock-in amplifier (SR830) with an optical chopper (SR540, Stanford Research Systems) and a photovoltaic cell. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement, with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the scavenger of superoxide ( O2 –) and hydroxyl radicals ( OH), was conducted on a Bruker E500 ESR spectrometer."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests were conducted in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon light source in a standard three-electrode system on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation in which MNF catalyst colloid coated onto a fluorine tin oxide (FTO) glass served as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode."
6,Catalytic activity evaluation,"2.5 Catalytic activity evaluation The photothermal catalytic performance of as-synthesized samples was evaluated by simultaneous H2 evolution and RhB degradation in a custom-built visual autoclave (Xi'an Taikang Biological Technology Co., Ltd.). Typically, 10 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of RhB solution (10 mg L-1) by sonication in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium. After sealing, the solution was purged by N2 gas (99.99%) for 30 min to thoroughly remove air. Then, the reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CHF-XM300W, PerfectLight) with AM 1.5G filter. Finally, the evolved H2 was detected by a gas chromatograph with a TCD detector (Agilent 8890, USA). Meanwhile, change in RhB concentration was quantified by UV–vis spectroscopy (TU-1810, Persee, China) at λ = 554 nm. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was investigated under the same reaction conditions except using various band-pass filters to obtain monochromatic light, and was calculated based on the following equation [38]: A Q Y = 2 × t h e n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s the number of incident photons × 100 % For comparison, a photocatalytic test was performed at room temperature controlled by a circulating water system, and at 50 °C as a thermocatalytic measurement."
7,Photothermal decomposition of AIBN,2.6 Photothermal decomposition of AIBN The photothermal decomposition of AIBN was performed by illuminating the hybrid solution consisting of C@TiO2 MNF (800 µg mL−1) and AIBN (0.1 M) in DMF under Xe lamp irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy.
8,FDTD simulation and DFT calculations,"2.7 FDTD simulation and DFT calculations The interfacial electric field distribution simulation of C@TiO2 MNF was performed by using the FDTD Solutions commercial software (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.) with perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions under total-field scatter-field (TFSF) source irradiation. The optical constants of carbon and TiO2 were adopted from the FDTD material database and literature [39]. The refractive index and temperature of the medium were set to be 1.33 and 320 K, respectively. Based on the density functional theory (DFT), the Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP) code [40] within the Materials Studio software was used for all calculations. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange correlation energy [41]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology The synthesis of our novel 3D C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe (MNF) photocatalyst is schematically depicted in Fig. S1. FESEM and TEM technologies were employed to uncover the morphology and fabrication process of MNF (Fig. S2–S7). Carbon sphere (CS) template presents a relatively smooth surface as well as a size around 450 nm (Fig. S8a). Subsequently, TiO2 precursors are uniformly grown on the surface of CS colloids through the adsorption and hydrolysis of TiCl4 (Fig. S8b). After annealed at 450 °C for 30 min, hollow multi-shell structured C@TiO2 is obtained with a rough surface (Fig. S8c). The presence of carbon core in MNF not only facilitates the transfer of electrons, but also effectively prevents structural collapse. Furthermore, TiO2 MNF is fabricated by further heating at 500 °C for 120 min, during which the adhesion among the particles is relatively serious since carbon core collapses during calcination (Fig. S8d). Owing to the low crystallinity of carbon core, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of C@TiO2 MNF only show the characteristic of anatase-TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21‐1272) (Fig. 1 a). Further, Raman spectra confirm that both carbon and TiO2 exist in MNF. As depicted in Fig. 1b, C@TiO2 MNF displays both typical d-band (1348 cm−1) and G-band (1582 cm−1), which are attributed to the carbon defects and ordered graphitic structure, respectively [42]. According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the content of carbon is approximated to be 6.04 wt% (Fig. S9). Besides, for the FT-IR spectra of C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 1c), the bands at 400–800 cm−1 are attributed to the Ti–O stretching vibration, and a moderate intensity band near 1050 cm−1 is related to the characteristic of TiOC bond [43], while the band is absent for TiO2 MNF obtained during the subsequent calcination treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted to further analyze the interaction between carbon core and TiO2 multishell. Fig. S10 verifies the coexistence of Ti, O, and C elements in C@TiO2 MNF. The two characteristic peaks at 464.3 and 458.6 eV in Fig. 1d are assigned to the Ti 2p 1/2 and Ti 2p 3/2 spin-orbital splitting photoelectrons in Ti4+ chemical state. In the O 1 s spectrum of C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 1e), the primary signal suggests the appearance of OTi group (529.8 eV), CO group (530.6 eV), and COC or OH groups (532.5 eV). Moreover, the C 1 s spectrum for C@TiO2 MNF can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 284.8 and 288.7 eV (Fig. 1f), which are attributed to CC bond and TiOC or CO bonds, respectively. These results confirm the strong interplay between carbon core and TiO2 multishell in the interface of C@TiO2 MNF. TEM images clearly represent a multishell nanoframe structure with core and multi-shells (Fig. 2 a). In addition, C@TiO2 MNF is calcined in air atmosphere to remove carbon core and obtain TiO2 MNF (Fig. 2b, c). STEM image further exhibits the details of C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 2d, e), while the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 2g) further prove that the carbon core and TiO2 multi-shells consist of Ti, O, and C elements. HRTEM analysis offers direct evidence for the formation of C@TiO2 MNF heterojunction (Fig. 2f), in which crystallized TiO2 interlaces with amorphous carbon, and the distinct lattice spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the (101) planes of anatase [44]. Clearly, high-quality interfacial contacts are formed between carbon core and TiO2 shell, which can improve the separation and transfer of photo-induced carriers."
11,Formation mechanism,"3.2 Formation mechanism Taking advantage of the feature that rapid heating (7 °C min−1) (Fig. S4) in air can cause structural collapse, the calcination process is controlled to collapse a part of C@TiO2 precursor and retain a part of carbon core to synthesize C@TiO2 MNF. Therefore, a more detailed intrinsic mechanism for the formation of 3D C@TiO2 MNF is shown in Fig. 3 . First, CS rich in surface functional groups is available for sufficient Ti4+ adsorption–hydrolysis to form C@TiO2 precursor. Then, the precursor is rapidly heated (7 °C min−1) to 450 °C for 30 min. During the annealing, the pyrolysis process would accelerate the generation of CO2 gas inside C@TiO2, which would expand the cavity of shells. The differential pressure inside and outside the framework promotes the gradual expansion and cleavage of crystalline TiO2 layers. Meanwhile, the expanded TiO2 layers begin to crack, accompanied with the release of carbon species, resulting in the formation of 3D C@TiO2 MNF, which is further heated at 2 °C min−1 to 500 °C for 120 min to generate TiO2 MNF. This process is just like a “balloon effect”, in which the difference between the inner and outer gas pressure causes the inflation and rupture of balloon [45]. If the entire calcination process proceeds slowly (2 °C min−1), it is easy to form a hollow multi-shell structure of TiO2 (Fig. S11). C@TiO2 MNF is designed to synergistically realize all the two pivotal roles of an efficient photothermal catalytic system, namely heat confinement and vibrant photocarrier kinetics. First, confined photothermal heating in MNF is mainly reflected in three aspects: high light harvesting, excellent photothermal conversion, and minimal heat loss to surrounding."
12,Heat confinement,"3.3 Heat confinement The optical absorption properties of all the architectures were measured by UV–vis DRS spectrometry (Fig. 4 ). As expected, both C@TiO2 MNF and TiO2 MNF present the characteristic absorption feature of titania with a cutoff at λ = ∼400 nm (Fig. 4a), meaning a bandgap energy (∼3.1 eV) for the nature of TiO2. More importantly, C@TiO2 MNF exhibits a broad absorption from the UV to visible region, especially, a superimposed wide band in the range of ∼400–800 nm (Fig. 4a), which exposes a strong interfacial interaction between inner carbon core and outer TiO2 multishell architecture [46]. It may also be attributed to the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of carbon core. Similar to traditional precious metals and carbon materials (carbon dots and graphene) [47–49], carbon core confined in the MNF can be used as plasmonic nanoparticles, which can expand the light absorption in the visible-near infrared region and thus boost the photothermal catalytic activity of C@TiO2 MNF. According to the Kubelka–Munk function, the band gap (E g) values of carbon sphere (CS) and TiO2 MNF have been estimated to be 0.24 and 3.07 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulated light scattering spectra of hollow TiO2 (Fig. 4c) indicate that the light scattered inside the MNF architecture with multi-shelled structures is multiplied, thus enhancing the probability of light absorption [50]. Most of the incident light couples into the MNF with a comparatively longer optical path than that in TiO2 in the form of planar film (100 nm) (Fig. 4d), thereby significantly increasing light absorption. Therefore, C@TiO2 MNF structure can serve as a photonic “black hole” accelerating the kinetics for photothermal catalytic H2 production reaction. The surface temperature of a catalyst is one of the key influential factors in photocatalytic reactions. Next, the high light harvesting of C@TiO2 MNF can be used for efficient solar-to-heat conversion (Fig. 5 a). As illustrated in Fig. 5b. the excitation of C@TiO2 MNF is discovered along with thermal relaxation of carbon core, visualized as local heating through photo-thermal conversion. It is noteworthy that the temperature at the central illumination zone of C@TiO2 MNF, which is also displayed in infrared thermal images (inset of Fig. 5b and S12), increases rapidly from 22 to 60 °C within 200 s upon 1 sun irradiation, whereas that of TiO2 MNF slightly rises, suggesting that C@TiO2 MNF has a significant photothermal effect. Besides, the photothermal effect of C@TiO2 MNF suspension was also evaluated (Fig. S13). The higher temperature response (50 °C) is attributed to the carbon core, which can efficiently convert solar energy into heat. Interestingly, this localized high temperature inside C@TiO2 MNF can be used to drive AIBN thermal decomposition under spatial heat confinement within the shells (Fig. 5c) [51,52]. When C@TiO2 MNF suspension with AIBN is heated by sole external heating to 50 °C, or photothermal heating to keep at ambient temperature (controlled by a circulating water pump system), there is scarcely any AIBN decomposition (Fig. 5d, S14 and S15). Surprisingly, once upon heating the suspension to 50 °C under Xe lamp exposure (photothermal heating), the kinetics of AIBN thermal decomposition (0.01 min−1) is comparable to that of sole external heating to 65 °C (0.007 min−1), which well proves that the temperature inside C@TiO2 MNF is raised to at least 65 °C through photothermal heating. The full encapsulation of carbon core with TiO2 multishell greatly suppresses the heat loss to the surroundings owing to the lower thermal conductivity of TiO2 multishell layers. Consequently, the heat confined inside C@TiO2 MNF is a key criterion for highly efficient photon‐to‐thermal conversion."
13,Vibrant photocarrier kinetics,"3.4 Vibrant photocarrier kinetics On home-made surface photovoltage systems (SPS) photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were further carried out to reveal the dynamic photocarrier behaviors in C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 6 ) [53,54]. Surface photovoltage (SPV) and surface photocurrent (SPC) spectrometry is among the effective techniques for monitoring the separation efficiency and transfer path of photo-generated carriers. As shown in Fig. 6a and 6b, the remarkable SPV and positive SPC responses for C@TiO2 MNF indicate that the introduction of carbon core is beneficial to the separation and transfer of photo-induced carriers and following proton reduction. Just as important, C@TiO2 MNF exhibits much smaller arc radius than TiO2 MNF in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization (Fig. 6c), signifying its lower charge‐transfer resistance, which is possibly attributed to the high electrical conductivity and superb carrier mobility of carbon core and multi-shelled TiO2 in the MNF topology. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent spectra display that C@TiO2 MNF has a relatively higher photocurrent density than TiO2 MNF during on–off cycles of simulated sunlight illumination, thus confirming the efficient charge transfer kinetics in C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 6d), presumably due to the ability of carbon core to improve light capturing and enhance charge separation. Therefore, C@TiO2 MNF possesses high‐speed channels for efficient separation and fast transfer of photogenerated carriers, resulting in robust photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, as the driving force of interfacial charge carrier transfer, the internal electric field (IEF) intensity of C@TiO2 MNF and TiO2 MNF was measured according to the following equation model proposed by Kanata et al. [55]. F s = ( - 2 V s ρ / ε ε 0 ) 1 / 2 where, F s is the IEF magnitude, V s the surface voltage, and could be obtained through the SPV values (Fig. 6a), ρ the surface charge density, and could be obtained by the transient photocurrent peaks (Fig. 6e), Ɛ the low-frequency dielectric constant, and Ɛ 0 the permittivity of free space. As Ɛ and Ɛ 0 are constants, the IEF intensity is determined by V s and ρ. Accordingly, C@TiO2 MNF exhibits definitely greater IEF, about 1.7 times that of TiO2 MNF (Fig. 6f), which could dramatically accelerate the interfacial charge carrier separation through the intimated interface between carbon core and TiO2 multishell. To verify the interfacial charge transfer capacity and electric field enhancement mechanism caused by C@TiO2 MNF, the FDTD method was used to simulate the spatial electric field distribution of C@TiO2 heterostructure under different incident wavelength of light (Fig. 7 ). As illustrated in Fig. 7a and 7b, when the incident wavelength is less than 420 nm (UV region), the electric field intensity on the side of inside carbon core (top) is much greater than that for elsewhere, manifesting the electron transfer from TiO2 to carbon core. As the excitation wavelength increases (Fig. 7c–f), it is clearly found that local “hot spots” are presented at C/TiO2 interface. Particularly, the electric-field magnitude is significantly enhanced under 600 nm irradiation (Fig. 7e), revealing the excellent photo-thermal (PTE) and LSPR effect of carbon core. In the light of Fermi’s golden rule, carbon-induced strong electric field can remarkably strengthen the photoexcitation in TiO2 shells [36]. This high-density of “hot spots” at C/TiO2 interface signifies the transfer of abundant hot electrons from carbon core to TiO2 shell, which is well consistent with electric-field vector analysis (Fig. S16). Obviously, the direction of the electric field starts to shift at 420 nm (Fig. S16b), and is thoroughly reversed at 600 nm (Fig. S16e), which is consistent with the wide absorption in the range of 400–800 nm by C@TiO2 MNF (Fig. 4a). Therefore, the plasmonic C@TiO2 MNF benefits from the hot electron transfer from carbon core to TiO2 shell, and the construction of C@TiO2 MNF heterostructure promotes the accumulation of charge carriers at C/TiO2 interface, thus enhancing the fast separation and transfer of charge on the surface of and inside MNF catalyst. To reveal the influence of carbon core on the electronic structure of MNF photocatalyst, density functional theory (DFT) calculations on C@TiO2 MNF and TiO2 MNF were conducted (Fig. 8 ). As shown in Fig. 8c, d, the density of states (DOS) of C@TiO2 MNF is higher than that of TiO2 MNF near the conduction band level, which means that the introduction of carbon core effectively enhances the electrical conductivity and carrier concentration. More importantly, the electron density difference also indicates that the introduction of carbon core can indeed promote the localization of electrons around Ti metal and enrich the electrons as catalytic active sites, and a larger charge redistribution is observed at C/TiO2 interface (Fig. 8f), favoring the electron migration driven by IEF. These experimental, FDTD simulation, and DFT calculation results collectively prove that the C@TiO2 MNF heterostructure with multi-shelled TiO2 supported by carbon core suppresses electron–hole recombination and boosts photo-excited charge separation and transfer."
14,Photothermal catalytic performances,"3.5 Photothermal catalytic performances The photothermal catalytic (without temperature control) performance was evaluated by simultaneous photocatalytic H2 production and RhB degradation without using any co-catalyst and sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5G). As shown in Fig. 9 a, C@TiO2 MNF exhibits excellent catalytic activity, by which 98.2% RhB is removed in 90 min along with 503 μmol g-1h−1 of H2 evolution simultaneously, 4.3 times the value 116 μmol h−1·g−1 for TiO2 MNF, resulting from the great synergistic effect between water splitting and RhB degradation. Subsequently, the photothermal catalytic H2 generation of C@TiO2 MNF in pure and RhB-containing water samples was compared under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 9b). In the pure water system, the H2 production performance of C@TiO2 MNF is remarkably reduced, with a H2 evolution rate of 178 µmol g-1h−1, which is only about 35% that in RhB-containing aqueous solutions system. More importantly, C@TiO2 MNF exhibits an obviously improved catalytic activity compared with TiO2 MNF without carbon core in different system. Further, the rate constant (k) can be calculated for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB according to the first-order linear equation ln(C t/C 0) = −kt [56]. C@TiO2 MNF has the highest rate constant k of 0.045 min−1, which is 4.1-fold the value 0.011 min−1 of TiO2 MNF (Fig. 9c). This superior photon energy conversion efficiency is due to the effective heat accumulation and generation/separation of electron–hole pairs in C@TiO2 MNF [57]. To further explore temperature impact on catalytic performance, a photocatalytic test was added at room temperature controlled by circulating water during the whole experiment, together with a thermocatalytic measurement (50 °C controlled by external heating), as shown in Fig. S17 and Table S1. All catalysts are observed chemically inert at producing H2 and degrading RhB via sole thermocatalysis (50 °C), owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics in principle. The photo-thermal catalysis is superior to photocatalysis and thermal catalysis in H2 evolution and RhB removal. Besides, the stability of C@TiO2 MNF in the synergistic H2 production and RhB elimination was evaluated. After four cycles, the yield of H2 and degradation efficiency of RhB are slightly decreased (Fig. 9d), possibly owing to the trace loss of C@TiO2 MNF in cyclic tests, indicating the good stability of as-synthesized C@TiO2 MNF system. Moreover, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of about 0.85% at 600 nm is achieved (Fig. 9e and Table S2), which is consistent with the interfacial field enhancement of C@TiO2 MNF at around 600 nm from FDTD simulations (Fig. 7). The AQY values of MNF photothermal system match basically with the UV–vis DRS of C@TiO2 photo-absorber, suggesting that the reaction is driven by solar light via a photocatalytic process [58]. It implies the promising perspective of PTE and LSPR effect in C@TiO2 MNF for enhancement of H2 production and RhB degradation. The active species quenching experiment confirmed that h+ and •OH radicals are the dominant in the RhB degradation over C@TiO2 MNF, while •O2 – radical is less significant (Fig. S18). For the purpose of in-depth insight into the main reactive species in this photo-thermal redox system, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique was implemented to detect the reactive species over C@TiO2 MNF with scavenger DMPO. As displayed in Fig. 9f, under simulated sunlight irradiation for 5 min, four characteristic peaks of DMPO- OH radicals can be observed, while DMPO- O2 – signal is not detected under the same conditions, indicating that hydroxyl radicals ( OH) could be the main reactive species in C@TiO2 MNF for degrading RhB and simultaneously producing H2. It is significant to evaluate the photo-thermal catalytic performance of C@TiO2 MNF for degrading other organic pollutants and producing H2 (Fig. S19 and Table S3). Obviously, removal ratios are higher than 96% for RhB and MO pollutants and higher than 75% for TCH and 4-NP, which illustrate the excellent activity of C@TiO2 MNF for degrading dye pollutants. The H2 evolution rates range from 257 to 503 μmol g-1h−1. The different degradation efficiency for various organics may be due to their different chemical structures. Besides, after decomposition by photo-induced holes or other radicals, some intermediate products may capture photo-generated electrons, which consequently affects H2 production [59]."
15,Photothermal catalytic mechanism,"3.6 Photothermal catalytic mechanism According to the above results, the basic photo-thermal catalytic mechanism involved in the simultaneous RhB removal and H2 production is the direct oxidation of RhB by photoexcited holes and the evolution of H2 by attack of photogenerated electrons on H2O molecules (Fig. 10 ). Before light exposure, a small part of RhB could be adsorbed by C@TiO2 MNF. The adsorption of RhB on the catalyst facilitates the transfer of photo-generated carriers between RhB and catalyst surface during the dye photosensitization process [60]. Under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) irradiation, the electrons of TiO2 shell in VB can be excited to CB to form photo-induced electrons, forming photo-excited holes in VB. C@TiO2 MNF serves as a “black hole” of light as well as an electron harvester, which confines almost all photons to MNF and continuously transfers the hot electrons generated from plasmonic carbon core. More importantly, benefiting from the accumulation of heat generated by the photothermal heating of carbon core and the giant internal electric field (IEF) of C@TiO2 heterostructure, the catalytic reaction rate and interfacial charge separation could be significantly accelerated. On one hand, h+ can oxidize H2O (or OH–) to generate radical OH. Thus, RhB can be mineralized to CO2 and H2O by OH or h+. On the other hand, e– can reduce H2O molecules or H+ into H2. This is a synchronized mechanism where RhB acts as a sacrificial agent via oxidation from h+ directly and OH indirectly [61]. Therefore, the most important photo-thermal catalytic process can be expressed by the following procedures.

16,Conclusions,"In summary, a facile carbonaceous nanosphere template‐based strategy to controllably synthesize unique heterostructured 3D C@TiO2 multishell nanoframe (MNF) was established. Owing to desirable efficient heat confinement and separation/transfer of photogenerated carriers with photothermal heating and hollow multishelled structure, the C@TiO2 MNF exhibited a significantly enhanced photo-thermal catalytic activity for simultaneous H2 production and RhB removal without the use of any co-catalyst and sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight irradiation. This work may open a novel avenue towards advanced nanostructures for efficient waste-to-energy conversion.
