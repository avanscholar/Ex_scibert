0,Introduction,"Over the past decade, the development of hydrogen production has attracted less attention than that of its utilization in fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen production is the subject of very active research [1–4]. Existing approaches for hydrogen generation include steam reforming (SR) [5,6], electrolyzers [7–9] and trigeneration [10,11], which yield hydrogen gas that is difficult to incorporate into existing distribution infrastructure. Today, the hydrogen-station cost is unsustainable at approximately $2.8 million per hydrogen station [12,13]. Moreover, the hydrogen infrastructure involves inevitably the storage and the delivery of gaseous or liquid hydrogen, for which it is essentially important to consider the safety issues for use of hydrogen from such sources. Addressing the costly establishment of hydrogen infrastructure and the safety issue for the use of hydrogen, an on-board hydrogen production technology by reforming of liquid fuels can be appropriate for fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which exactly allows using the existing liquid fuels infrastructure. Such hydrogen is produced instantly on-demand and is instantly consumed by FCEVs, hence circumventing the need to store and deliver the gaseous or liquid hydrogen. It is considered that such a solution for the use of hydrogen for FCEVs would be the ideally safest one. Herein, on-board is defined as hydrogen production in a unit carried within or occurring aboard a vehicle; also, it can be applicable to allocated hydrogen refueling stations [14–16]. On-board hydrogen production via thermocatalytic reforming of liquid fuels (gasoline [17], alcohols [5,6,18,19], etc.) is not a new concept, but has not been realized previously due to mismatches in rates and sizes of the necessary reactors [20]. In terms of the liquid fuel, methanol is an intriguing option as it can be available from renewable sources and contains a high ratio of hydrogen to carbon and no C–C bonds. Extensive efforts [21–23] have been made to develop the thermocatalytic reforming of methanol such as SR, and partial oxidation or autothermal reforming [5]. Although it produces higher hydrogen concentration and results in higher system efficiency [6], the SR reaction is endothermic and typically limited by heat transfer rather than reaction kinetics [5], hence the system features slow responses and scale issues that make it untenable for on-board reforming. In terms of partial oxidation or autothermal reforming, catalyst deactivation arising from coke formation and catalyst sintering limit applicability [24,25], although partial oxidation offers compactness, fast start-up, and rapid responses [6]. Nowadays, non-thermal plasmas can be a valuable alternative to thermocatalytic processes [26,27], and are gaining increasing interests. For plasmas, the electric energy directly and rapidly transfers to electrons, which activate molecules by electron impact excitation, dissociation and ionization, creating reactive plasma chemical species, thereby overcoming the limitations due to slow and nonuniform heat transfer in thermocatalytic SR. The principal advantage of the plasma-chemical approach over thermocatalytic systems, is very high specific productivity (hydrogen productivity per unit volume) due to its volumetric nature, such as up to 1000 times more hydrogen of the same size [28]. Interestingly, in the combination with fuel cells, plasma processes can directly transfer the electric energy (from fuel cells) over electrons to reactant molecules, which could be considered more efficient than separate, standalone processes. By use of plasma reforming of gasoline or diesel fuel with air via plasmatron fuel converter, one can generate hydrogen-rich gas, which can be used as an additive to provide significant reduction of NOx for internal combustion engines (ICE) [14]. Many efforts on methanol reforming using cold plasmas generated by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) [29,30] and corona discharge [31] have been conducted. However, the major drawbacks of low energy efficiency, high energy cost, and high CO selectivity still need to be resolved. Warm plasma [15,32–50] in particular by gliding arc discharge, is efficient and promising for versatile energy and environmental applications. In general, warm plasma features much higher electron density (ca. 1013-14/cm3), compared to that of cold plasma. Such a high electron density accelerates greatly the plasma reactions initiated by electron impact, hence warm plasma allows a high product yield at a low energy density, and gives high energy efficiency and low energy cost. In our recent work [15], warm plasma reforming of methanol exhibits higher energy efficiency and lower energy cost than cold plasma. Oxidative pyrolysis reforming (OPR) of methanol [15], involving partial oxidation (R1, R2, para-reactions) and pyrolysis (R3), occurs in gliding arc discharge, (R1) CH 3 OH + 1 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 K θ = - 192.5 kJ / mol (R2) CH 3 OH + 1 2 O 2 → CO + H 2 O + H 2 Δ H 298K θ = - 151.4 kJ / mol (R3) CH 3 OH → CO + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 K θ = 90.5 kJ / mol However, for the OPR, only a portion of the heat energy released from the exothermic oxidative reforming is utilized by the endothermic pyrolysis reforming in the plasma and the lifetime aspects are unknown. Additionally, the CO concentration in the product gas is 20 vol%, which needs to be remarkably reduced. For warm plasma coupled with catalyst, it has to be two-stage configuration due to the temperature nature. The catalyst can be a “chaining” of downstream catalysts of different functionality in sequence. Very few of works involve plasma coupled with the “chaining” catalysts, actually which is in particular cold plasma coupled with catalysts (MnO2-based) for low-flux environmental treatment (e.g., 70 ppm toluene) [51]. Inspiringly, this may also represent a pragmatic solution [52] to high-flux hydrogen production. In the present work, we demonstrate an advanced on-board hydrogen production for FCEVs by warm plasma chain catalytic reforming of methanol (PC1C2) in a heat-insulated gliding arc reactor without external heating. The PC1C2 process includes the plasma-induced OPR and the subsequent SR (R4) and pyrolysis at high temperature (HT) over NiCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst C1, and SR and water gas shift (WGS, R5) at medium temperature (MT) over FeCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst C2, (R4) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H 298 K θ = 49.4 kJ / mol (R5) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 K θ = - 41.1 kJ / mol To utilize efficiently the heat released from OPR by warm plasma, the subsequent endothermic reactions, HT SR and pyrolysis and MT SR over catalysts, are performed in close thermal contact. Simultaneously, the CO concentration is further reduced via WGS reaction over catalyst C2 and the H2 concentration increases accordingly. The PC1C2 process could allow that partial oxidation occurs in the plasma zone (in absence of catalyst) followed by SR and pyrolysis (with WGS) in the catalyst-bed zone; hence, there is no such an issue of catalyst sintering compared with that which occurs for thermocatalytic partial oxidation (or autothermal reforming) processes. Consequently, the PC1C2 process offers high energy efficiency with high hydrogen atom utilization (U H), low energy cost, and high and rapid hydrogen concentration for on-board hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,"The experimental setup of warm plasma chain catalytic reactor using gliding arc discharge for methanol reforming is shown in Fig. 1 . A stainless steel cylinder of 20 mm in inner diameter is wrapped by ceramic fiber cotton for heat insulation. No external sub-system of heating is included. A high-voltage electrode with ceramic insulator locates at the axis of the cylinder, and the cylinder is grounded. An input power of 60 W with a frequency of 90 kHz is applied by an AC high-voltage power supply (CTP-2000K, Nanjing Suman electronics Co., China). For the selection of catalysts, activity, stability and selectivity are concerned. The temperature ranges for two-stage catalysts in catalyst bed are 700–500 °C for high temperature, and 500–355 °C for medium temperature, respectively. For the high temperature range, Ni is selected as active component due to the excellent thermal stability. Also, Ni is a benchmark to which catalyst NiCu is compared, but it will not be studied afterwards. NiCu is selected instead of Ni considering the enhanced methanol conversion and the inhibited methanation reaction (the very low methane selectivity). For the medium temperature range, FeCu is selected instead of NiCu due to the low reactivity of the latter at below 500 °C. Catalysts of Ni/γ-Al2O3 (10% in weight), NiCu/γ-Al2O3 (7%Ni, 3%Cu) and FeCu/γ-Al2O3 (10%Fe, 10%Cu), are prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using the precursor of aqueous metal nitrate and γ-Al2O3 support of 1–2 mm in diameter for overnight, followed by drying at 110 °C for 6 h and calcination in air at 500 °C for 6 h. The as-prepared catalysts do not need to be reduced prior to the reaction [41]. The catalysts of γ-Al2O3 supported Ni, NiCu and FeCu, are represented by catalyst C0, C1 and C2, respectively. Catalysts are packed and located in the post-plasma zone in the reactor if applicable. For the downstream catalysts, the catalyst-bed height (with mass and volume) is specified 2 cm (5 g and 4.5 cm3), 8 cm (20 g and 18.2 cm3), or 10 cm (29 g and 22.7 cm3). The heights of 2 cm and 8 cm apply to catalyst C1, while 10 cm applies to catalyst C2. For comparison, 8 cm applies to catalyst C0 too. The axial temperature profile of reactor along catalyst bed is measured using a thermocouple. A solution of methanol in deionized (D.I.) water is pumped through a vaporizer into the reactor using a HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) pump. Under conditions of Table 1 , two feeds are fed before and after plasma region. A gap of 35 mm between feed F 2 and the entrance of catalyst bed remains to allow saturation. The ratios of O2/methanol (O2/C) and steam/methanol (S/C) in feed F 1 are consistent with the optimum ones for OPR of methanol by plasma as derived in our previous work [15]. With the feed F 1, total feed F t is set based upon autothermal reforming reaction (R6), hence feed F 2 at a S/C ratio of 1.0, (R6) CH 3 OH + 0.1 O 2 + 0.8 H 2 O → CO 2 + 2.8 H 2 Δ H 298 K θ = 0 kJ / mol Considering that the heat released from OPR may not be fully utilized for subsequent reactions, the O2/C is set as 0.16, a little higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 1.0 in R6. X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffraction measurements on the fresh and used C2 catalysts are conducted by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu) using a Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ ranging from 20° to 80°. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the fresh or used catalysts is measured by N2 adsorption using a surface area analyzer (AUTO SORB-1-MP, Quantachrome). BET surface areas for the fresh and the used catalysts C2 are 99 and 99 m2/g, while 167 and 149 m2/g for catalyst C1, or 155 and 160 m2/g for catalyst C0, respectively. As described elsewhere [15] and in Supporting Information, two gas chromatographs are employed to analyze online gaseous products after the gas–liquid separation using a cold trap. Helium is used as an internal standard gas to quantify H2, and nitrogen (in air, Feed F 1) as another internal standard gas for CO, CO2, CH4 and C2HX hydrocarbon. Supporting Information describes catalyst auto-reduction (Fig. S1, section S1), and analysis of reactor outlet gas by gas chromatograph (Fig. S2, section S2). The definition of conversion, selectivity, production rate, dry-basis concentration, energy efficiency and energy cost is given in equations SE1-12 (section S2). The balance of C, H, O atoms, the conversion of methanol or water (based on the remained reactants), and the stability are checked using equations SE13-22 (Figs. S3–S5, section S3). The individual contribution of plasma, catalyst C1 or catalyst C2 for the PC1C2 process is analysed using equations SE23-29 and overall reaction R7 (section S4). The parameters of plasma-based alcohol reforming approaches are given (Table S1)."
2,Results and discussion,"In the present work, the salient points about size, temperature ranges, and overall coupling and conversion efficiency are stressed. The reactor size is ca. 39.2 mL in Fig. 1, which eventually needs to be scaled up to satisfy the necessary hydrogen production rate for a FCEV and will be discussed later. The temperature ranges at single stages are presented with the overall coupling due to the relevance. All the flow rate and composition of F 1, F 2, and total F t feed are presented in Table 1. For a total feed F t, the ratios of O2/C and S/C at 0.16 and 0.7 are set based upon autothermal reforming reaction (R6). If total feed F t with such low ratios of S/C and O2/C is fed before the plasma zone, there is a substantial soot formation. Hence, two feeds of methanol, air and steam (F 1), and methanol and steam (F 2) are fed before and after the plasma zone, respectively. For a feed F 1, the O2/C ratio for the plasma-induced OPR reaction is set 0.30, which is below the explosion limit of 0.35 [53] and allows a complete consumption of oxygen. The complete consumption of oxygen in the OPR avoids the issue of catalyst deactivation due to sintering for the subsequent reactions (SR, pyrolysis and WGS). Also, the presence of an appropriate amount of water in feed F 1 is necessary to avoid soot formation [15]. Herein, the water that does not participate in the OPR reaction, however may absorb the plasma energy and subsequently cause a decrease in methanol conversion [15]. Hence, a trade-off between avoiding soot formation and the decrease in methanol conversion in the OPR reaction requires a S/C ratio of 0.5. Moreover, for a plasma alone process (no catalyst), it is observed that methanol conversion drops from 78% with only feed F 1 (the data not shown) to 37% with two feeds of F 1 and F 2. Apparently, the coupling of plasma and downstream catalyst(s) seems necessary. To develop the overall coupling system, three individual processes of plasma, PC1 and PC1C2 are involved to identify appropriate catalysts and catalyst-bed height, the overall production, and the single-stage contribution. In close thermal contact, the coupling system is related to the temperature ranges. The temperature ranges spontaneously drop from high (immeasurable) temperature for OPR in plasma region, to 727–550 °C for HT SR and pyrolysis, and 550–355 °C for MT SR and WGS in catalyst-bed region."
3,Warm plasma coupled with one-stage catalyst,"3.1 Warm plasma coupled with one-stage catalyst As shown in Fig. 2 , for plasma alone process, oxygen conversion of 100% for the OPR of methanol is achieved. For plasma catalytic processes, the complete consumption of oxygen occurs prior to catalyst-bed region, hence the issue of catalyst sintering arising from exothermic oxidation is dismissed, compared to thermocatalytic partial oxidation (or autothermal reforming) processes. For simplicity, oxygen conversion is omitted below. Considering the enhanced methanol conversion and the inhibited methanation reaction, NiCu catalyst is hence selected for catalyst C1. The significant increase in methanol conversion is attributed to the SR and pyrolysis over catalyst C0 or C1. For plasma catalytic process, methanol conversion increases remarkably to 74% for PC0, or 80% for PC1, relative to 37% of plasma alone process. Moreover, the increase in hydrogen and CO2 selectivity with the decrease in CO selectivity, suggests that the SR reaction occurs significantly over catalyst C0. The hydrogen selectivity of 87% or 89% for the PC0 or PC1 process, is achieved, respectively, compared to 62% for the plasma alone process. However, a slight increase in methane selectivity for PC0 is observed. The lower methane selectivity over catalyst C1 (NiCu) than catalyst C0 (Ni), may be ascribed to the methanation reaction that is suppressed by introducing copper component in Ni-based catalysts [54–56]. For the PC1 process, the temperature profile shows a fast decrease in the first 2 cm catalyst-bed height followed by a gradual decline till the end of the catalyst bed, i.e., 8 cm in Fig. 3 a. In Fig. 3b, in terms of methanol conversion and hydrogen and CO selectivity, the first 2 cm accounts for the overwhelming proportion of catalyst bed. The weak contribution of the remaining catalyst bed until 8 cm is ascribed to very low activity of NiCu catalyst at below 500 °C."
4,Warm plasma coupled with two-stage catalysts,"3.2 Warm plasma coupled with two-stage catalysts Addressing this aforementioned inefficient catalysis, since Fe-based catalyst features high activity for SR and WGS reactions at 350 to 500 °C [57–59], FeCu catalyst is selected for catalyst C2. Hereafter, based on the temperature ranges a “chaining” of downstream catalysts of different functionality in sequence is incorporated into the coupled system. Consequently, for the PC1C2 process the downstream catalysts of 2 cm catalyst C1 for HT range above 551 °C, followed by 10 cm catalyst C2 for MT range from 350 to 551 °C are chained in Fig. 4 a. In Fig. 4b, a significant increase in methanol conversion from 63% to 92% or water conversion from −22% to 42% for the PC1C2 process is observed, compared to the PC1 process. Symbols of R P , R C 1 , R C 2 , and R P C 1 C 2 represent the single-stage reaction of plasma zone, catalyst C1, catalyst C2, and the overall reaction afterwards, respectively. It is noteworthy that the water conversion changes from negative to positive. The negative conversion is ascribed to more water formation due to OPR reaction (in particular R2) at R P stage, while the positive conversion attributed to more water consumption due to SR and WGS reactions (R4, R5) at R C 2 stage. The hydrogen selectivity favourably increases to 99% (out of maximum 100%), taking water contribution into account in equation SE8. Also, the remarkable decrease in CO selectivity and the significant increase in CO2 selectivity are observed, which manifests that the MT SR and WGS reactions occur remarkably over catalyst C2. Moreover, for the PC1C2 process, the auto-reduction of catalysts C1 and C2 occurs rapidly during the reaction, which makes the hydrogen production process more convenient and simplified due to no need of catalyst pre-reduction prior to reaction. As shown in Fig. S1, CuO and Fe2O3 of the fresh catalyst C2 can be reduced to metallic copper and Fe3O4 after 6-hour reaction, respectively, which contribute to the MT SR and WGS reactions [59,60]. Fig. 5 shows remarkable increases in dry-basis concentrations of hydrogen and total hydrogen t-H2 to 59 and 61 vol%, and a significant decrease in CO to 7 vol% for the PC1C2 process, compared with the plasma alone process. It is attributed to the chain catalysis of (oxidative) pyrolysis and WGS in sequence (as well as SR) over catalysts C1 and C2, which is initiated by warm plasma. The remaining components of product gas are CO2, CH4 and N2 (18, 0.6 and 15.4 vol%). The production rates of hydrogen and total hydrogen t-H2 of 4.1 SLM and 4.6 SLM are achieved. Total hydrogen t-H2 represents a sum of the (present) hydrogen in the gas mixture and the additional hydrogen that is produced by CO reacted with steam through WGS reaction. The CO concentration of 7 vol% approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of 6.65 vol% at 355 °C of the end of catalyst bed. To achieve the low concentrations of CO tolerated by polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC), it is addressed to be coupled with low-temperature WGS and CO purification units [5] to further reduce CO concentration to ca. below 20 ppm. In terms of the consequences of a diluted hydrogen feed stream in fuel cell performance due to the use of air, our system does not have a significant kinetic impact on the fuel cell. For our system, the diluted hydrogen (t-H2/CO2/N2/CH4 of 61.6/23.4/14.4/0.6) in absence of CO is comparable to that of the reformate mixture (H2/CO2/N2 of 40/25/35, 75/25/0 [61], H2/CO2/(N2 + CH4) of 75/20/balance) [62,63]. Consistent with literatures [61–63], the hydrogen dilution and high utilization of hydrogen in the absence of CO do not penalize cell performance very much (e.g., less than 10% power loss vs that of neat hydrogen) [61]. With this approach, the mole fraction of hydrogen in the product gas is 59%, compared with the theoretical value of 41%, 67%, 75% for partial oxidation, autothermal reforming, SR, respectively. Apparently, it seems that there is room for the improvement of the mole fraction of hydrogen. With this approach, the mole fraction of hydrogen would increase further with a decrease in O2 stoichiometry due to the less nitrogen (sourced from air) introduced. For instance, the O2 stoichiometry of 0.16 (in Table 1) can be reduced further down to 0.1 (of autothermal reforming R6), through the remained plasma region and an increase in the amount of methanol in the catalyst-bed region. However, such a decrease in O2 stoichiometry results in less heat with partial oxidation, which is detrimental to the subsequent endothermic reactions and unfortunately increases the energy cost. Therefore, the trade-off of the mole fraction of hydrogen versus the energy cost, governs the rationale of reactions design for our system. It is of interest to identify the individual contribution of plasma, catalyst C1 or catalyst C2 for the PC1C2 process (see section S4, Supplemental Information). As shown in Table 2 , in terms of the single-stage reaction R P , R C 1 and R C 2 , the distribution ratio β P , β C 1 and β C 2 suggests that the OPR, the HT SR and pyrolysis, and the MT SR and WGS accounts for 40%, 30% and 30% the overall reaction on the basis of methanol conversion, respectively. As indicated by the enthalpy changes, such a strong endothermic R C 1 and an endothermic R C 2 , are exactly consistent with the fast decrease (at front 2 cm) and the slow decrease (at back 10 cm) in catalyst-bed temperature in Fig. 4a, respectively. The overall reaction for the PC1C2 process is a slightly exothermic reaction. Apparently, the heat with the exothermic OPR by plasma, is efficiently utilized by the HT SR and pyrolysis over catalyst C1 and the MT SR and WGS over catalyst C2."
5,Hydrogen atom utilization and energy efficiency,"3.3 Hydrogen atom utilization and energy efficiency After the development of the overall coupling system, the overall conversion efficiency of the PC1C2 process is checked, i.e., hydrogen atom utilization (Fig. 6 , Table S1), overall energy efficiency (Fig. 7 ). Figs. 6, 7 and Table S1 are from the same works. Also, the mass balance (Fig. S4) and the stability (Fig. S5) are presented. Consistent with atom economy (a principle of green chemistry), hydrogen atom utilization (U H) is defined to evaluate the process greenness of hydrogen production from a fuel CxHyOz (methanol, etc.), (E1) U H = actually produced t - H 2 theoretical t - H 2 × 100 % Theoretically, it can generate maximum 2 mol t-H2 molecules per molar carbon. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of U H with conversion between our approach and other plasma-based approaches. Compared with that with oxygen, the U H in the absence of oxygen is supposedly higher but unfavourably with higher energy cost (e.g., as indicated by high S/C ratio [65] in Table S1). To achieve low energy cost, in general, the presence of oxygen (hence the exothermic oxidation) in reforming process is necessary. In the presence of oxygen, the PC1C2 process of our approach achieves the highest U H of 88% at O2/C of 0.16 (conversion of 92%), compared with the U H of 32% at O2/C of 0.30 (conversion of 88%) [64]. Explicitly, the only comparison made with the data point of U H at 32% is based on the lowest energy cost of interest. Since there are big differences in nature in various plasmas techniques, it might be very difficult to make the comparisons, and only the comparisons in terms of apparent parameters such as energy efficiency, energy cost and hydrogen atom utilization can be made. Worth noting is that, a match of hydrogen atom utilization for energy efficiency (or energy cost) was not stressed previously in literatures, actually which is crucial for hydrogen production process in presence of oxygen. Fig. 7 shows the energy efficiency of methanol to hydrogen or energy cost of various approaches. Compared with other plasma-based reforming approaches [64–68], the PC1C2 process of our approach achieves the highest energy efficiency of 91%, the very low energy cost of 0.22 kWh/Nm3 and the highest U H of 88% (in Fig. 6) at large t-H2 production rate. In literature [64], although the lowest energy cost (0.05 kWh/Nm3) is achieved, unfortunately it accompanies the very low energy efficiency and U H (37% and 32%). It is ascribed to a large amount of heat generation due to ethanol combustion (complete oxidation) but unexpectedly at the cost of sacrificing the U H. This mismatch (the lowest energy cost unexpectedly with low efficiency and U H), exactly stresses the importance of the match of U H for energy efficiency or energy cost. As a result, the PC1C2 process demonstrates an efficient and green approach for on-board hydrogen production, which features the highest energy efficiency, the highest hydrogen atom utilization and very low energy cost. To check the mass balance of C, H and O atoms, the operation of the PC1C2 process is maintained for time on stream (TOS) of 200 min (see Figs. S2–S4, sections S2-S3, Supporting Information). Fig. S4a shows that the consistency in conversion of methanol or water by two analytic approaches based on the amount of products in reactor outlet gas ( X CH 3 OH , X H 2 O ) or based on the amount of the remained reactants ( X ' CH 3 OH , X ' H 2 O ). Fig. S4b shows the balance of C, O, H atoms of 97.4%, 99.8%, 99.7%. Favourably the PC1C2 process is supported by the mass balance and the conversion consistency. During 6 h of TOS, the methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity keeps steady at around 92 and 99%, respectively, in Fig. S5."
6,Brief economic cost analysis and scale-up,"3.4 Brief economic cost analysis and scale-up A brief economic cost analysis of on-board hydrogen production by the PC1C2 process is conducted. One kg H2 is approximately equivalent to 1 gallon-gasoline-equivalent (gge) on an energy content basis (LHV) [69]. Based on the energy cost (0.22 kWh/Nm3) and the average wholesale price of methanol ($175/tonne [70]), the hydrogen production cost by our approach is calculated $1.19/gge with the assumed electricity for plasma from fuel cells (energy efficiency of 60% [71] at 80 °C), or $1.23/gge with the assumed levelized electricity prices ($0.07/kWh [7]). Herein, the production cost of hydrogen of $1.19/gge using methanol by our approach is comparable to and even cheaper than $ 1.39/gge ($3 (MM BTU natural gas)-1) by on-site steam methane reforming (SMR) using low-cost natural gas [7,69]. Furthermore, our approach is advantageous over SMR approach in terms of a hydrogen levelized cost, which includes the minimized storage and dispensing costs (due to the use of liquid methanol) versus compression, storage and dispensing costs (of $3.85/gge) [69]. To satisfy the requirements of fuel-cell stack operation for automotive, the transient response and hydrogen production rate are concerned. Our system of the PC1C2 process features the transient response due to the rapid response of plasma in nature and the close thermal contact of the coupled system (no external heating). Technically, the startup/shutdown of our system can be accomplished within seconds or minutes. Very similar to existing ICE vehicles, the hybridization with batteries may be necessary to pump liquid fuel (methanol) into reactor, ignite the plasma, and initiate our system. A production rate of hydrogen of 1.16 Nm3/min is required for FCEVs (e.g., 100 kW, operation at 0.6 V, 120 cells that are 2500 cm2). Our system needs to be scaled up to around 29.5 L, i.e., an estimated 10.1 L reactor and 19.4 L (mean size) power supply for plasma ignition based on the plasma density and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). Hence, our system features transient response and very high specific productivity, for which an estimated scaled-up size that matches production rate is compact and makes it pragmatic for on-board hydrogen production in FCEVs, compared to the limitations (e.g., large size) due to slow and nonuniform heat transfer in thermocatalytic SR."
7,Conclusions,"Our approach of warm plasma chain catalysis (the PC1C2 process), demonstrates an advanced on-board hydrogen production for FCEVs by reforming of methanol with air and steam. The OPR by plasma, and the subsequent HT SR and pyrolysis over catalyst C1 and MT SR and WGS over catalyst C2 are conducted in a heat-insulated gliding arc reactor without external heating. In this work, the reactor size of the PC1C2 process is ca. 39.2 mL. To develop the overall coupling system, three individual processes of plasma, PC1 and PC1C2 are involved to identify appropriate catalysts and catalyst-bed height, the overall production, and the single-stage contribution. The temperature ranges spontaneously drop from high (immeasurable) temperature in plasma region to 727–355 °C in catalyst-bed region. Based on the temperature ranges a “chaining” of downstream catalysts of different functionality in sequence is incorporated into the coupled system. To avoid soot formation and catalyst deactivation due to sintering, two feeds of methanol, air and steam, and methanol and steam are fed before and after the plasma, respectively. The auto-reduction of catalysts occurs during reaction. For the PC1C2 process, the complete oxygen conversion of 100% for the OPR allows no issue of catalyst sintering arising from exothermic oxidation, compared with thermocatalytic partial oxidation (or autothermal reforming) processes. Under conditions of 4.8 SLM total flow rate, gliding arc plasma, and catalysts C1 and C2, a hydrogen selectivity of 99% (concentration of 59 vol%, rate of 4.1 SLM) and a methanol conversion of 92% are achieved. The CO concentration of 7 vol% approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of 6.65 vol%. The remaining components of product gas are CO2, CH4 and N2 (18, 0.6 and 15.4 vol%). Moreover, compared with plasma alone process, the enthalpy change of the overall reaction for the coupled system, demonstrates that the heat with OPR reaction by plasma is efficiently utilized by the subsequent endothermic reactions over the catalysts. It is attributed to the chain catalysis of (oxidative) pyrolysis and WGS in sequence (as well as SR) over catalysts C1 and C2, which is initiated by warm plasma. After the development of the overall coupling system, the overall conversion efficiency of the PC1C2 process is checked. Worth noting is that, a match of hydrogen atom utilization for energy efficiency (or energy cost) is stressed for hydrogen production process in particular in presence of oxygen. Among various plasma-based reforming approaches, the PC1C2 process achieves the highest energy efficiency of 91%, the very low energy cost of 0.22 kWh/Nm3 and the highest U H of 88% at large t-H2 production rate. Also, the mass balance of C, O, H atoms is checked 97.4%, 99.8%, 99.7%, as well as the conversion consistency and the stability, which favourably support the PC1C2 process. The brief economic cost analysis shows that the hydrogen production cost for the PC1C2 process is comparable to and even cheaper than that by SMR using low-cost natural gas, as well as the hydrogen levelized cost. More importantly, the PC1C2 process features transient response and very high specific productivity, for which an estimated scaled-up size that matches production rate is compact and makes it pragmatic for on-board hydrogen production in FCEVs. Consequently, our approach of warm plasma chain catalysis is a practical, efficient and highly green approach for on-board hydrogen production in FCEVs, as well as for stationary use of hydrogen production."
