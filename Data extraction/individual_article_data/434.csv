0,Introduction,"Wastewater treatment is one of the most important issues owing to the fast development of modern industries nowadays, for example, the generation of emerging contaminants such as personal and pharmaceutical care products (PPCPs) (Archer et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017), pesticides (Carvalho, 2017), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (Alharbi et al., 2018). These pollutants are not only difficult to decompose but also harmful to human and biosphere. Among these emerging contaminants, Ibuprofen (IBP) is one of the most widely used painkillers. Due to its stability and non-biodegradability, IBP can be detected in natural waters at a concentration of approximately of ppb level (Skoumal et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2016). Technical, economical, and environmental feasibility of resource recovery technologies are needed to minimize the impact of pollutants and to produce environment friendly resources. Photoelectrochemical method employ photocatalysts to utilize both light energy and electrochemical energy to deal with environmental and energy issues, which has become a research hotspot in decades (Grätzel, 2011; Peng et al., 2012b, 2020; Chang et al., 2016). Among all catalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) was the most studied material owing to its relative low cost, stable chemical properties, and wide applications in pollutants degradation, energy generation, and resource recover. However, the huge band gap of 3.0–3.2 eV, corresponding to rutile and anatase phase, and the easy recombination process of hole-electron pairs were the obstacles of application for TiO2. P-type semiconductor, i.e., Cu2O, is capable to modify TiO2, which is a kind of n-type semiconductor, to form the p-n junction (Yang et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2016). As illuminated with suitable light, the free electrons from TiO2 would migrate across the p-n junction to fill up the holes in Cu2O, therefore, reducing the recombination of photo-generated hole-electron pairs. In addition, Cu2O is promising for PEC water splitting due to its high Hall mobility and the relatively small band gap that are 90 cm2/V and 1.90–2.17 eV, respectively. Among various synthetic methods, green synthesis of Cu2O by using plants (Kerour et al., 2018; Induja et al., 2019; Ghadiri et al., 2020) and sugar (Amrani et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2018) as reductants, which is a simple, inexpensive, rapid, and eco-friendly method. Kerour et al. (2018) synthesized cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles (NPs) by using the aqueous extract of Aloe vera and copper sulfate as solvent and precursor, respectively (Kerour et al., 2018). Results indicated that Cu2O NPs are highly improved by the fast degradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution at room temperature under solar simulator irradiation. CuO- and Cu2O NPs, synthesized by using the Salvia hispanica extract by a high-gravity technique, which showed effective antibacterial activity (Ghadiri et al., 2020). In addition to environmental applications, porous molybdenum-doped cuprous oxide (Cu2O:Mo), which was synthesized with the aid of piper longum extract, yielded outstanding Li-ion uptake performance with a specific capacity of 1128 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g–1 and enhanced rate performance and cycling stability (Murphin Kumar et al., 2020). For easy to reuse and recycle, Cu2O NPs has been deposited on titanate nanotube arrays (Cu2O/TNTAs) as a photo-anode in PEC system to remove Ibuprofen (Chang et al., 2016). Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) is widely used by consumers in daily basis (Del Rosario et al., 2014). Among the PPCPs, Ibuprofen (IBP), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is consumed by humans at high dose from 600 to 1200 mg/day for soothing the painful and inflammatory conditions (Cho et al., 2020; Chopra and Kumar, 2020). The annual consumption of IBP was about 166 t/year in France in 1998, 128 t/year in Germany in 2001, 276 t/year in Spain in 2003, and 180 t/year in Canada in 2001 (Verlicchi et al., 2010). IBP may enter to the nature waters through the effluents of pharmaceutical plant, direct disposal of overplus drugs in households, excretion after drug administration to humans and animals, or even from the discharge of unused medicines (Skoumal et al., 2009; Jallouli et al., 2018; Chopra and Kumar, 2020). The concentration of IBP in wastewater treatment effluent can range from ng to μg/L level (Carballa et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2007; Han et al., 2010; Liu and Wong, 2013; Del Rosario et al., 2014; Mohd Zanuri et al., 2017). The existence of IBP in aquatic environments may cause harmful implications to human health and aquatic ecosystem (Pomati et al., 2004; Han et al., 2010; Veldhoen et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2017; Jallouli et al., 2018; Cho et al., 2020; Chopra and Kumar, 2020). From a viewpoint of resource and energy recovery, it is important and feasible to produce value-added products (VAPs) and/or energy-rich products, for examples, to recover heavy metals, nutrient, platform chemicals, and hydrogen from the wastewater treatment procedure (Kumar et al., 2020; Dawn and Vishwakarma, 2021). Kim et al. (2017) converted glycerol into glyceraldehyde (GAD), glyceric acid (GLA), and hydroxy pyruvic acid (HPA) by anodic oxidation by applying water as a stoichiometric chemical oxidant (Kim et al., 2017). Kavitha et al. (2020) applied a novel phase-separation delignification process to obtain the biomethane from rice straw. The D-CBP (delignified cellulase secreting bacterially pretreated) rice straw samples achieved a maximum lignin and biomethane content of 0.5 g/L and 165 mL g−1 VS, respectively (Kavitha et al., 2020). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important greenhouse effect gases. Peng et al. (2012a,b) used N-doped TiO2 thin film to PEC reduced CO2 to energy-rich products, such as methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, and methane (Peng et al., 2012b). As to the energy recovery, hydrogen is a globally accepted clean energy owing to its high energy density (120 kJ g−1), stable, and secure properties. Recently, catalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen generation attracted great attention. Karunadasa et al. (2012) synthesized a well-defined MoIV-disulfide (MoS2) complex that can catalytically generate hydrogen from acidic organic media as well as from acidic water (Karunadasa et al., 2012). Chen et al. (2010) summarized the semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen generation and indicated that considering the lowering cost for solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion, polluting byproduct from industries and biomass from animals or plants are the preferred sacrificial electron donors in water-splitting systems (Chen et al., 2010). Wastewater treatment and hydrogen production can be accomplished simultaneously with little or no cost. The objectives of this study are, (i) to synthesize the p-n junction photocatalysts, Cu2O deposited titanate nanotube arrays (Cu2O/TNTAs), by square wave voltammetry electrochemical deposition methods (SWVE) by applying the extract of green tea and coffee as reducing agents; (ii) to clarify the physical, chemical, and photoelectrochemical properties of green-synthesized Cu2O/TNTAs; (iii) to simultaneously remove Ibuprofen and generate hydrogen by using the as-synthesized Cu2O/TNTAs as a photo-anode in a PEC system; (iv) to detail discuss the oxidation and reduction mechanism in PEC system. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has proposed for the simultaneous removal of Ibuprofen and production of hydrogen by using green-synthesized Cu2O/TNTAs."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Cu2O/TNTAs,"2.1 Preparation of Cu2O/TNTAs Titanate nanotube arrays (TNTAs) were synthesized via anodic oxidation method. The detail of the fabrication of TNTAs was described in our previous study (Peng et al., 2017). Briefly, Ti foil was sequentially clean by acetone, alcohol, and DI water, then etched for 1 h under 40 V through anodic oxidation method to synthesize the TNTAs. In addition, TNTAs was calcinated under 450 °C for 3 h by 2 °C/min to increase its crystallinity. Cu2O/TNTAs were synthesized by an eco-friendly method. First, the extract of green tea and coffee were used as reducing agents in square wave voltammetry electrochemical deposition methods to synthesize Cu2O nanoparticles. Three grams of tealeaf and grinded coffee powders were brewed with 20 mL deionized water (DI water) at 100 °C as the extracts of green tea and coffee, respectively. The mixed solutions of 30 mL CuSO4 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) of 0.03 M, and the extract of green tea or coffee (20 mL) were adjusted to pH 10 by NaOH (97%, Kento chemical Co., inc., Japan), respectively. The as-synthesized TNTAs were immersed in the electrolyte and stirred for 20 min. The TNTAs, Pt wire (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and Ag/AgCl were selected as the working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively, in the SWVE method. The initial applied potential, final potential, amplitude, and frequency was set as −1.0 V, 0.0 V, 5 mV, and 5 Hz, respectively. For comparison, lactic acid (90%, Alfa Aesar, USA) was selected as a chemical reducing agent to synthesize Cu2O by SWVE method. The samples were named as Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c when using lactic acid, green tea, and coffee as reducing agent."
3,Characterizations of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs,"2.2 Characterizations of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs The structure and morphology of the TiO2 nanotube arrays were characterized using a cold-field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), which was capable of energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to analyze the surface elements of as-synthesized materials. The crystallinity of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs catalysts were identified by applying X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D8 SSS, Bruker, Germany) with CuKα radiation. The analyses were operated at 30 mA current with beam voltage of 40 kV and scanned between 20° and 80° with a scan rate of 2°/min. The crystal structures were compared by matching the XRD pattern of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs to the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) of Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) library data. The elemental compositions of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs were determined by electron spectroscope for chemical analysis (ESCA) which is so-called X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ULVAC-PHI, PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Japan). UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry was employed to investigate transmission and reflectance data of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer with an integrating sphere (Jasco V-6300, USA). Electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses were conducted to identify the free radicals in the photoelectrochemical system by a Bruker ESR Spectrometer (EMX-10/12, Bruker, Germany) with 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trapping agent at room temperature. The parameters of ESR experiments were 3485 G, 200 G, 9.777 GHz 100 kHz and 5.066 mW for the center field, sweep width, microwave frequency, modulation frequency, and microwave power, respectively. A quartz capillary tube was used throughout the ESR experiments to minimize measurement errors."
4,Electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical analysis,"2.3 Electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical analysis The EC and PEC experiments were performed in a double chamber cell reactor where a TNTAs (or Cu2O/TNTAs) with a surface area of 4 cm2 was used as anode, a Pt wire was used as cathode and Ag/AgCl was selected as reference electrode. In the PEC and PC (photocatalytic) experiment, the anode was irradiated by 100 W mercury light with a power of 95.5 mW/cm2, while P (photolysis) experiment merely employed irradiation (100 W mercury light, 95.5 mW/cm2) without Cu2O/TNTAs. The distance between anode and light source was 5 cm. A circulating cooling system was employed to maintain the room temperature for the PEC system. In the cell reactor, a Nafion 212 cation exchange membrane (DuPont Co. Ltd. USA) was used to separate the anodic and cathodic chambers. A quartz with an area of 7 cm2 was set on the side of anodic chamber to allow the better light utilization during photoelectrochemical experiments. A potentialstat (PGSTAT 302 N, Autolab, Netherlands) was employed to provide the bias potential and to record the photo-current. The photo-current-time response experiment was performed in a PEC system under +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) of bias potential with/without 100 W mercury light irradiation. Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum (EIS) was conducted to investigate the resistances in the PEC system to evaluate the electron lifetime of photo-generated electrons of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs. The EIS was analyzed under open circuit potential (OCP) in the frequency range from 10−2 to 105 Hz at an applied voltage of 5 mV."
5,Ibuprofen degradation and hydrogen generation,"2.4 Ibuprofen degradation and hydrogen generation Ibuprofen was selected as the target compound to evaluate the PEC oxidation ability of TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c in the anodic chamber of the cell reactor. To increase the conductivity, 5 mg/L of Ibuprofen was dissolved in 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and stirred for 5 days at room temperature. At the meantime of PEC oxidation in the anodic chamber, hydrogen production experiment was investigated in the cathodic chamber with an electrolyte of 0.1 M NaCl by using Pt as the cathode. Furthermore, four methods i.e., PEC, EC, PC, and P, were compared for the efficiency of Ibuprofen removal and the production of hydrogen in the anodic and cathodic chambers, respectively, by using Cu2O/TNTAs-t as the anode. The Ibuprofen was measured by a Liquid Chromatography (LC-6AD, Shimadzu, Japan) which equipped with a SB-C18 column (SB-C18, Agilent, USA) at a wavelength of 254 nm. The total organic carbon (TOC) of Ibuprofen was analyzed by a TOC analyzer (TOC-L, Shimadzu, Japan). The hydrogen was measured by a Gas Chromatography (7890, Agilent, USA) with Thermal Conductivity Detectors (TCD) with a packed column (Part Nbr: 19808, USA)."
6,Result and discussions,
7,Characterization of Cu2O/TNTAs,"3.1 Characterization of Cu2O/TNTAs Fig. 1 shows the FE-SEM images of the as-synthesized TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c. Fig. 1 (a) reveals the tubular structure in ordered alienation on titanium foil that were successfully synthesized by the anodization method, indicating that the beneficial attribute for electrode applications. The diameter and length of TNTAs are 100 nm and 2.83 μm, respectively. Cu2O NPs were loaded on the surface of TNTAs by SWVE method through the three reductants such as lactic acid (Fig. 1 (b)), green tea (Fig. 1 (c)), and coffee (Fig. 1 (d)). Fig. 1 (b) reveals that spherical Cu2O NPs are not only distributed on the surface of TNTAs, but also inserted into the nanotubes, which was similar to the finding of the literature that showed the reduction of the Cu(EDA)2 2+ by electrochemical deposition method (Fen et al., 2012). Fig. 1 (c) shows the thick layer of nanotube arrays attributed to the Cu2O NPs is homogeneously distributed on the surface of TNTAs. This observation was in consistent to the finding of the literature which showed the synthesis of Cu2O/TNTAs by using lactic acid and copper sulfate as electrolyte in the SWVE method (Zhang et al., 2014). The shape of Cu2O NPs in Fig. 1 (d) was similar to Fig. 1 (b), indicating that lactic acid can be replaced by coffee as green reductant. Upon loading with the NPs of Cu2O, the TNTAs kept their structural integrity, illustrating no obvious morphology change. The element content of Cu2O/TNTAs was analyzed by EDS and XPS, and both indicated that Cu2O/TNTAs contains C, O, Ti, and Cu elements (Table 1 ). EDS results show that the atomic percentage (at.%) of Cu content was 12.48, 1.68, and 2.79% in Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c, respectively. XRD was applied to measure the crystallinity of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs as shown in Fig. 2 . The crystal of TiO2, Ti, and Cu2O are referring to no. 21–1272, no. 44–1294, and no. 05–0667, individually based on the JCPDS database. After 450 °C sintering, both TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs revealed the crystal plane of (101), (004), (200), and (105), corresponding to the peaks of anatase phase at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, and 54.0°, respectively. Moreover, there are no characteristic peaks of rutile phase for all samples due to the insufficient calcined temperature. The green synthesized Cu2O/TNTAs show characteristic peaks of Cu2O phase at 2θ = 36.5°, corresponding to crystal phase of (111) (Li et al., 2012). This result proves that using green tea, coffee, and lactic acid as reductants can successfully load the Cu2O NPs on the surface of TNTAs. Furthermore, there are no characteristic peaks of CuO or Cu that emerged in Cu2O/TNTAs, representing that the Cu element is supported on TNTAs in the form of Cu2O. The chemical property and the element state of Cu2O/TNTAs were identified by XPS. Fig. 3 (a) shows that the full spectrum of Cu2O/TNTAs contains Ti, O, C, and Cu elements. Fig. 3 (b) shows the characteristic peaks at 459.4 and 465.3 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p2/3 and Ti 2p1/3, respectively, confirming that titanium was in Ti4+ state in titanium dioxide. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), the characteristic peaks at 932.8 and 952.6 eV, which emerged in the Cu 2p region, referring to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. Both of two peaks represent Cu2O same as the characteristic peak at 570.3 eV in Fig. 3 (d), showing that Cu element is in Cu+1 state instead of Cu0 or Cu2+ in Cu2O/TNTAs. The LMM Auger spectrum of Cu (Fig. 3 (d)) is used to identify Cu (I) and Cu (0) because the binding energy is only 2 eV between them. The peak of Cu appears at 570.3 eV, which is corresponding to the Cu (I) (Chen et al., 2013; Tominaka et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016). XPS results reveal that the atomic percentage (at.%) of Cu content was 14.9%, 2.6%, and 5.4% in Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c, respectively (shown in Table 1). The slight difference in Cu2O/TNTAs elemental analysis between EDS and XPS may be attributed to different depth and area of sample analysis. However, the results of EDS and XPS both prove the existence of Cu element in Cu2O/TNTAs, indicating that the Cu2O NPs were successfully deposited on the surface of TNTAs by SWVE method. In addition, both EDS and XPS results illustrate that the Cu (at%) was higher in Cu2O/TNTAs-L than that of Cu2O/TNTAs-c and Cu2O/TNTAs-t. The reducing ability by natural materials, e.g., tea and coffee in this study, may vary with its concentration, purity, reaction time, temperature, etc. (Wacławek et al., 2018). This study used UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to analyze the absorbance of the as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 4 , the absorption wavelength of TNTAs was under 400 nm, corresponding to the bandgap energy of 3.2 eV, which limited the utilization of TNTAs in visible light. Since the TNTAs had huge band gap, Cu2O NPs were deposited on TNTAs to reduce the band gap and to increase the light utilization efficiency. For Cu2O/TNTAs samples, the bandgap energy of Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c was 2.2, 1.8, and 2.1 eV, respectively. The absorption wavelength of Cu2O/TNTAs red shift to the range of 550–600 nm, indicating that loading the Cu2O NPs not only can reduce the bandgap energy of materials but also increase the photocatalytic performance and visible light utilization efficiency."
8,Electrochemical properties of Cu2O/TNTAs,"3.2 Electrochemical properties of Cu2O/TNTAs Fig. 5 shows little photo-current was observed in the dark condition. As light on, the photo-generated electrons could overcome the band gap and jump from the valence band to the conduction band of Cu2O/TNTAs, then transfer from the anode to the cathode by the attraction of bias potential in PEC system, result in the decreasing of the recombination process of photo-generated hole-electron pairs. The photo-current of TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c reached 1.70, 3.78, 4.23, and 4.12 mA/cm2, respectively. This result demonstrates that the loading Cu2O NPs on TNTAs facilitates electron mobility owing to the reducing recombination process of electron-hole pairs. Moreover, Cu2O NPs is a semiconductor that can provide the electrons as light exciting, leading to the enhancement of photo-current. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) analyses were conducted to investigate the electron mobility between the electrode and electrolyte. In Fig. 6 (a), in the Nyquist diagram, the diameter of the semi-circle arc indicates to the resistance of charge transfer. In a PEC system, the higher separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs accompany with the smaller radius of semi-circle arc (Peng et al., 2020). The diameter of semi-circle arc of the samples followed the order: TNTAs > Cu2O/TNTAs-L > Cu2O/TNTAs-t > Cu2O/TNTAs-c, indicating that the electron mobility has been improved due to the loading of Cu2O NPs. The inset plot in Fig. 6 (a) shows the equivalent circuit plot of simulated EIS fitting results that are composed with Rs, Rp, and CPE. Table 2 reveals the results of equivalent circuit fitting for TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs under +1.0 V of bias potential. The Rs refers to the resistance of the solution, while the Rp represents the charge transfer at the interface between Cu2O/TNTAs and electrolyte. The result shows that the Rp values were 568, 457, 359, and 317 Ω for TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c, respectively. While the Rs values were 22.1, 22.4, 18.8, and 22.8 Ω for, TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c, individually. The smaller resistance in the PEC system is beneficial for the electrochemical reactions which is conductive to the anodic degradation of hazardous contaminants. In addition, the electron lifetime (τ), τ = 1 2 π × f m a x , can be obtained according to the findings in Bode plot (see Fig. 6 (b)). It is noted that the electron lifetime of Cu2O/TNTAs-L and Cu2O/TNTAs-c were 1.2 times higher than that of TNTAs in PEC system, indicating that the loading of Cu2O NPs increased the separation of electron-hole pairs to enhance the photo-current and photocatalytic performance. Similar results of EIS analysis were observed in TiO2/RGO/Cu2O electrode that p-n junction effect of Cu2O can significantly accelerate the electron mobility by depressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs (Fan et al., 2016)."
9,PEC performances,"3.3 PEC performances This study aimed to generate hydrogen and to remove organic pollutants in water simultaneously. Effect of different photo-anodes on PEC Ibuprofen and TOC removal were compared by TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c in anodic chamber, whereas hydrogen production was conducted in the cathodic chamber simultaneously. Fig. 7 (a) shows that the measured current density was higher for Cu2O deposited TNTAs, i.e., Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c than that of pure TNTAs, illustrating the contribution of Cu2O loading. The higher current density accompany with higher H2 yields in the cathodic chamber. Fig. 7 (b) shows the amount of hydrogen generation were 1,095, 1,531, 2,608, and 2132 μM/cm2 in the cathodic chamber for the TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c PEC system, respectively, after 4 h reaction time. The amount of hydrogen generation in study is higher than that of 820 and 219.94 μM/cm2 for Ag/TNA-c (green synthesized by using coffee as reductant) (Peng et al., 2020) and BiOI-TNTAs PEC system (Chen et al., 2018), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 (c), under light irradiation at +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) applied potential, the Ibuprofen (5 mg/L) was completely degraded by Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c in 30 min that was faster than TNTAs. This result also demonstrates that depositing Cu2O NPs on TNTAs can improve the PEC oxidation ability. Table 3 summarize the IBP degradation by different oxidation methods, including UV/H2O2 (Wang et al., 2021), electrochemical, catalytic ozonation (Bing et al., 2015), electro-Fenton (Skoumal et al., 2009), photoelectron-Fenton (Skoumal et al., 2009), persulfate activation (Ding and Hu, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020, 2021), photocatalysis (Jimenez-Salcedo et al., 2019; Shanavas et al., 2019; Nawaz et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and photoelectrochemical method (Sun et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020). In addition to UV/H2O2 and catalytic ozonation for IBP degradation, the rest methods follow first order reaction. Although the initial concentration of IBP is not in consistent, PEC method is one order higher than other methods (except for TiO2 NPs photocatalysis and TiO2 activated persulfate) according to the rate constant of IBP degradation. Light source, dosage of catalyst, and applied bias potential are the possible factors affecting the IBP degradation. The rate of TOC removal in Ibuprofen degradation were 13.42, 27.94, 32.48, and 31.76% in TNTAs, Cu2O/TNTAs-L, Cu2O/TNTAs-t, and Cu2O/TNTAs-c PEC system, respectively, after 4 h (Fig. 7 (d)). The remaining TOC suggests the residual organic intermediates. The removal of Ibuprofen with a concentration of 5 mg/L by using Cu2O/TNTAs-t electrode was studied to compare the performance of P, PC, EC, and PEC processes. Fig. 8 (a) reveals the efficiencies of Ibuprofen degradation followed the order: PEC > PC > P > EC. Ibuprofen can be completely removed by PEC method within 30 min. Fig. 8 (b) shows the corresponding TOC removal in Ibuprofen degradation experiments were 23.98, 24.32, 8.36, and 32.48% by P, PC, EC, and PEC method, respectively. Residual intermediates might be formed from the source of oligomer or polymer formation by radical polymerization (Choina et al., 2013). Although there are some residuals of organic compounds in the solution, the IBP of 5 mg/L was completely decomposed by PEC method within 30 min with a rate constant of 0.197 min−1 which is higher than 0.0718, 0.0002, and 0.0161 min−1 for the PC, EC, and P method, respectively. Above results indicate that PEC is the most effective way in Ibuprofen and TOC removal. This is because of the combination of EC and PC oxidation in PEC system that enhanced the separation of electron-hole pairs leading to the enhancement of oxidation ability of Cu2O/TNTAs. Peng et al. (2012a) further proposed that the higher bias potential, which is a driven force for electrons, could reduce the recombination of electrons and holes. At the same time, using larger bias potential can offer higher anode current to enhance the EC oxidation in the anodic chamber (Peng et al., 2012a). The stability of Cu2O/TNTAs-t in PEC system was performed by the triplicate experiments of simultaneous Ibuprofen degradation and hydrogen generation. Fig. 9 (a) shows that the 5 mg/L of Ibuprofen can be completely degraded within 1 h in the anodic chamber in PEC system after 3 times experiment with the same photo-anode. The removal rate constants of Pseudo first-order reaction were 0.197, 0.147, and 0.150 min−1 for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd experiments. Fig. 9 (b) shows that the yield of hydrogen generation was 2608.3, 2583.3, and 2625.3 μM/cm2 after 4 h reaction time, individually. Results show that after the triplicate experiments, the amount of hydrogen generation and the degradation rates of Ibuprofen remained efficient, which illustrated that Cu2O/TNTAs-t has good stability in the PEC system."
10,ESR analysis,"3.4 ESR analysis Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a useful method to quantify the hydroxyl radicals (·OH). A spin trap of 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was employed to measure the of radicals in the PEC system. Fig. 10 shows the peak of DMPO/·OH, with the signal intensity of 1:2:2:1, can be detected in dark or photo reaction of TNTAs and Cu2O/TNTAs. Fig. 10 (a) shows weak signals in TNTAs dark condition, whereas the peaks of DMPO/·OH were observed at 30 s, 2 min and 5 min as illumination, indicating that the ·OH generate continuously during TNTAs photocatalysis. Fig. 10 (b) reveals that six peaks were measured in Cu2O/TNTAs dark reaction, which represented the methyl radical (·CH3) (Sun et al., 2016) because of using lactic acid, green tea or coffee as the reductants. Moreover, the higher signals of hydroxyl radical were measured with the increasing time of light illumination."
11,Mechanism of Cu2O/TNTAs PEC system,"3.5 Mechanism of Cu2O/TNTAs PEC system This study successfully proved that lactic acid, green tea, and coffee can reduce Cu2O NPs to synthesize the Cu2O/TNTAs heterostructure. Depositing Cu2O NPs not only reduce the bandgap energy of TNTAs to increase light utilization as evidence in UV–vis DRS analysis (Fig. 4) but also decrease the electron-hole recombination to enhance photo-current and the electron lifetime, leading to the efficient PEC performance in Ibuprofen degradation and hydrogen production. Fig. 11 shows the schematic diagram of the PEC system by using Cu2O/TNTAs as the photo-anode. When the light illuminates at Cu2O/TNTAs, electron will be photo-excited from valence band to conduction band. Electrons will be guided from the anode to the cathode to reduce water to generate hydrogen. Notably, the holes, remain on the Cu2O/TNTAs, react with H2O to form hydroxyl radicals which were demonstrated according to the results of ESR analyses (Fig. 10). In the present of applied potential, the electrons in the anode can be driven to the cathode easily, leading to the decrease of the recombination process of electron-hole pairs. In this study, the hydroxyl radicals retained in anodic compartment could oxidize organic compounds (such as Ibuprofen) (Fig. 7 (c)), while electrons can reduce H2O to produce hydrogen in cathodic compartment (Fig. 7 (b)). The capability of redox reaction of TNTAs PEC system was significantly enhanced after Cu2O NPs modification as evidence of photo-current measurement (Fig. 5), Nyquist plot (Fig. 6 (a)), Ibuprofen degradation, and hydrogen generation."
12,Practical applications and future research perspectives,"3.6 Practical applications and future research perspectives The PPCPs are not easy to remove in traditional water treatment procedure such as chlorine disinfection by using hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypochlorite ions (OCI). In this study, we demonstrated a feasible photoelectrochemical method to deal with Ibuprofen by using Cu2O/TNTAs. The Cu2O/TNTAs can be applied in the original process of UV disinfection without additional energy input in a traditional water treatment plant. The UV can excite the Cu2O/TNTAs to generate holes to react with water to form hydroxyl radicals and then to decompose most of persistent organic compounds such as ibuprofen. This method is known as one of the advanced oxidation procedures (AOPs). On the other hand, the photo-generated electrons can be applied to generate hydrogen as an evidence in section 3.3. However, more practical parameters are needed for pilot applications."
13,Conclusions,"Cu2O/TNTAs were fabricated by applying the extract of green tea and coffee as reducing agents for the very first time. The existence of Cu on the surface of TNTAs was demonstrated by EDX and XPS results. XRD analyses shows the characteristic peak of Cu2O at 2θ = 36.5°, corresponding to crystal phase of (111) were observed, illustrating the successful loading of Cu2O NPs. Results of EIS and Bode plot analyses illustrate that the loading of Cu2O NPs is advantage to the separation of electron-hole pairs. Ibuprofen can be completely removed within 30 min in the anodic chamber, while hydrogen was simultaneously produced in the cathodic chamber. Depositing Cu2O NPs on TNTAs not only reduce the bandgap energy of TNTAs but also decrease the electron-hole recombination, therefore, leading to the enhancement of the PEC performances in Ibuprofen degradation and hydrogen production."
