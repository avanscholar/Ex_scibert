0,Motivation of the review,"Until now, the main energy consumption of the world is remaining coal, oil, and natural gas, which occupied around 29%, 31%, and 22%, respectively. However, the energy demand for consumption continues to increase and overuse of these fossil energies accelerates global warming, ecological balance, environmental damage, and other issues [1]. Consequently, energy development has gradually shifted into clean and renewable energy to optimize the modern energy structure. Among the renewable energy, biomass as representative carbon energy is promising for further utilization [2], which can be used for syngas, and other value-added chemicals through thermochemical conversion, biochemical conversion, etc. The main advantages and challenges of biomass thermochemical and biochemical conversion were already concluded in many literatures. Among them, biomass gasification as an attractive technology can be used to produce syngas and further into value-added chemicals through Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis or other catalytic reactions [3]. However, without an advanced catalyst, biomass gasification into syngas will be low efficient and difficult in practical utilization, and tar formation is also an urgent issue that should be overcome. The tar formation during gasification may lead to damage of the gasification system, extra energy loss, and the issues of environmental and human health. Numerous studies have reported high temperature, high equivalence ratio, high steam/biomass (S/B) ratio, and other operation optimization could improve tar cracking [4,5]. However, the tar amount in gaseous products is still far from the industrial application by adjusting the various parameters. The tar elimination by the measures of physical and thermal removal has been demonstrated effective for tar cracking, but abundantly extra energy in tar is still not fully utilized [1]. Up to date, many researchers have developed abundant catalysts for tar elimination and improving H2 content, which has already been reviewed by some researchers and us [1,6,7]. For instance, the group of Kawi has made great efforts in catalyst design for tar reforming, and they published some reviews covering active catalysts in thermal, plasma, and membrane reactors [8]. Furthermore, the influence of catalyst properties (e.g., basic strength and oxygen vacancy) and deactivation mechanism on the reforming of tar model compounds have been well discussed previously [9,10]. However, the economical catalysts, syngas composition, gas purification, and downstream integration have not yet been systematically discussed, which are crucial to advance the gasification development at a large scale. Hence, in this work, we provide a comprehensive and systematic examination of these issues. Firstly, we start by introducing the detailed activity and mechanism of efficient catalysts in tar reforming based on the catalyst types and supplementing the performance of char-derived catalysts in tar reforming. Secondly, the gas compositions, gas clean-up, and integrated possibility with downstream technology are discussed. Following that, we review the common catalysts and mechanisms used in value-added chemical production from hydrogenation technology, and the impurities influences on these reactions are reviewed. Finally, the actual integrated case, summary, and prospects are presented to end this review."
1,Fundamentals of catalyst design in biomass tar reforming,
2,Biomass tar and pathways of biomass tar reforming,"2.1 Biomass tar and pathways of biomass tar reforming Biomass tar is usually generated in the pyrolysis step due to the thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, and the composition of the tar is determined by biomass type, pyrolysis temperature, and pyrolysis atmosphere. Regarding the influence of reaction temperature, atmosphere, S/C ratio, and equivalence ratio on the tar products composition, which has already been reviewed by other researchers [11–13]. According to the tar appearance, molecular weight, etc., there have some classifications of tar composition. For instance, oxygenated hydrocarbons (e.g., levoglucosan, furfural, and hydroxyacetaldehyde), phenolic and olefin compounds (e.g., phenol, cresol, and xylene), and aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and toluene) as the primary, secondary, and tertiary products, are usually produced at around 400–700 °C, 700–850 °C and 850–1000 °C, respectively. Typically, the elimination methods of tar can be categorized into two types: inside of gasifier and outside of the gasifier (Fig. 1 ). In an outside gasifier, tar can be eliminated by methods of chemical or physical treatment. Physical treatment including wet and dry purification, remove tar by organic liquid and cyclone, ceramic filter, etc. However, the separation of liquid mist, lower gasification temperature, and liquid recovery, secondary pollution from sewage, etc. should be considered in wet purification. Dry filtration is considered to be more efficient in tar removal, but the cost recovery of equipment investment, short operating life, etc. hindered its development. In addition, extra energy in tar is wasted, and therefore thermal cracking with/without a catalyst is promising to eliminate biomass tar in recent years. In the inside gasifier, optimization of gasification conditions, bed additives, reactor optimization, and catalyst design has been extensively reported in biomass tar reforming. The operating conditions, such as gasification temperature, pressure, gasifying medium, equivalence ratio play a crucial role in biomass gasification [14]. The optimal parameters in gasification will promote carbon conversion, product gas composition, tar reduction. Normally, the high temperature will reduce more biomass tar (above 800 °C), and especially the temperature determines the tar composition. The pressure increasing in gasification could enhance the phenols elimination, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formation, char stability, light hydrocarbons reforming under different gas pressures [4]. Furthermore, the gasification using different gasifying agents affected the composition and heating value of the gas products. Air gasify agent could decrease the heating value of the producer gas because of the dilution, and the CO2 gasify medium as the internal products are promising due to the reaction of the methane dry reforming in presence of CO2 [15]. In some cases, the researcher studied the effect of the steam-CO2 atmosphere on gas yield and tar composition, and they found the char activity was improved and then more ash will be produced in gasification. Until now, the steam introduction into the system has attracted tremendous attention for biomass tar and tar model compounds reforming. For instance, Franco et al. [16] investigated steam gasification of pinaster, eucalyptus globulus, and holm-oak in an atmospheric fluidized bed at 700–900 °C. The results revealed more H2-rich gas and fewer hydrocarbons can be obtained under optimized conditions (gasification at 830 °C and S/B ratio of 0.6–0.7). Gao et al. [17] studied the effects of gasifier temperature, equivalence ratio, and S/B ratio on the syngas production and composition, heating value, etc. using an updraft gasifier with a continuous biomass feeder. They obtained the syngas with a yield between 45.1 and 135.4 H2/kg biomass and a high calorific value in the range of 8.10–13.40 MJ/Nm3 at 800–950 °C. The heating values trends follow the volcano curve when equivalence ratio increased from 0 to 0.3. In recent years, the focus has gradually shifted to catalyst design, and the catalysts with tailored pore structure, acidity/basicity, active site together with the great gasification agent (i.e., steam), which are reported to be highly effective for H2-rich gas production. During the catalytic reforming of biomass tar, many reactions could be simultaneously performed, and the product distribution can be different based on the conditions. The main reactions are summarized in Table 1 . In addition, the gas composition and reforming behavior could be influenced by the fraction of the tar during the biomass gasification, and then the tar composition is determined by many factors like reforming temperature, atmosphere, steam/carbon (S/C) ratio, and biomass type. As a consequence, biomass tar as the mixtures of condensable hydrocarbons will lead to the difficulty to have a clear understanding of the tar cracking. Using representative tar compounds (toluene, benzene, etc.) to study the cracking mechanism is the optional choice [18]. As presented in Fig. 2 a, the process of syngas from toluene steam reforming can be divided into adsorption, reaction, and desorption, which including steam dissociation, toluene decomposition, the reaction of absorbed •C2H2 and •CH2 with adsorbed O, and then gas release. Jess [19] considered the thermal conversion of toluene is easier than naphthalene and benzene under H2/steam atmosphere. As Fig. 2 b exhibited, they indicated H2 atmosphere could prevent the soot formation and steam has no effects on the conversion of the aromatics. Definitely, it is already the design rule to obtain an outstanding gas production that tuning basicity, oxygen mobility, metal-support interaction, and multi-metal synergistic effect of the catalyst. A catalyst with optimum basicity is beneficial to inhibit coke formation and promote hydrocarbon decomposition. The generated coke can be eliminated by the –OH groups over the basic sites through the spillover, and the reduced –OH can usually be continuously supplied by active steam on the basic site. On the contrary, the zeolite-derived catalysts possessed obvious acidic nature are easily deactivated by dehydration of oxygenates. The common method for improving the catalyst basicity is adding the base metal oxides (e.g., CeO2 and ZrO2) into the support during the catalyst preparation [22], and then using the known catalyst with high basicity (e.g., hydrotalcite) is another strategy. Recently, Ren et al. [20] fabricated Ni-based hydrotalcite-derived catalysts and correlated the structure–activity relationship (i.e., morphology, basicity, and Ni dispersion) of them in toluene reforming (Fig. 2 c). The results revealed that the obtained catalysts (Ni/MgAl-10) possessed higher basicity (1.33 mmol/gcat) could convert more CO2 into syngas through Boudouard reaction, reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, and CO2 methanation. In addition, the existence of Ni (111) plane provides a superior platform for H2 dissociation and reaction with free radicals from toluene cracking. Considering the metal-support interaction (MSI), the support can anchor the active metal to avid the active site loss and carbon formation during the biomass tar reforming, and then catalyst activity could be regenerated by thermal or reduction treatment. However, the catalyst with strong MSI might need a higher temperature to obtain metallic metal, and the higher temperature could result in particle growth and catalyst sintering. Kong et al. [23] compared the activity of Ni/MgO, Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni/α-Al2O3, Ni/SiO2, and Ni/ZrO2 in CO2 reforming of toluene, and they observed that Ni particle size and coke formation were affected by the interaction between Ni and support. Ni/MgO was proved to be the most active catalyst in anti-coking and activity in toluene conversion (91.0%) at 600 °C, which possessed the highest Ni dispersion and strong MSI between Ni and MgO through the formation Ni–Mg–O solid solution. The presence of oxygen vacancies and mobile oxygen species in the support structure can enhance the activation of steam and coke oxidation, and therefore are considered as an important parameter to prevent carbon formation. Ashok et al. [10] considered perovskite-derived catalysts with a special composition (e.g., ABO3 and A2BO4) could provide abundant oxygen vacancies after replacing A or B site metals with other metals. Interestingly, perovskite-derived catalysts that are already identified can exhibit certain activity in anti-sulfur during biomass tar reforming. Zhang et al. [21] synthesized Ni/La1-xSrxAlO3-σ perovskite catalysts for toluene steam reforming in the presence of H2S, and the Ni/γ-Al2O3 was employed for comparison. Their results proved the H2S could be adsorbed on the active sites of the catalysts and formed Ni-S structure, and therefore deactivate the Ni/La1-xSrxAlO3-σ catalysts. Comparing to the commercial Ni/γ-Al2O3, the synthesized perovskite-supported catalysts showed better anti-H2S activity, especially over the catalyst with the La/Sr/Al/O ratio of 7/3/1/1. As depicted in Fig. 2 d, oxygen vacancy originated from Sr promotion could transfer O from H2O dissociation to oxidize the Ni-S bond and then exhibited higher anti-S ability, but the excessive S and carbon deposition will finally deactivate perovskite catalyst. Our group fabricated a layered carbon load Ni catalyst that originated from HCl treated lignite (Ni/HSL) and was used for corncob catalytic gasification and toluene steam reforming [24]. We modified and increased the O-containing species (OCSs) of the lignite with HCl treatment, and then supported Ni by the method of ion exchange. After characterization, the excellent Ni0 and lower activation energy (24.50 kJ/mol) of Ni/HSL were observed, and Ni/HSL with a high TOF of 0.03 h−1 exhibited superior activity and stability for toluene steam reforming. Furusawa et al. [25] compared the activity of Pt and Ni-based catalyst for steam reforming of naphthalene/benzene. They considered the Al2O3 as a support for the steam reforming of naphthalene/benzene showed higher activity and stability than MgO, CeO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 supported catalyst. Pt/Al2O3 showed stable activity after continuous treatment of H2 for 5 cycles. Devi et al. [26] investigated the naphthalene reforming over olivine catalyst, and they proposed possible pathways for syngas production. The results indicated H2O and CO2 atmospheres can enhance the naphthalene decomposition while H2 inhibited the cracking reaction. They considered the cleavage of C–H or C–C bond of non-substituted aromatic compound, rings opening of the aromatic compound and the formation of lower aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbons are the key steps, respectively. In addition to the catalysts mentioned above, there are other catalysts are also proved to be effective in biomass tar reforming, and we will share the representative catalysts and their activities for biomass tar reforming in the following sections."
3,Mineral catalyst,"2.2 Mineral catalyst As the economically available materials, the mineral catalysts obtained from nature have already proved to be active for biomass tar reforming. For example, nickel ore, calcined hydrotalcite, and limonite have proven to possess certain catalytic activity for biomass tar reforming, which containing Ni, Mg, and Fe are usually used as catalyst directly after calcination or reduction. After thermal treatment, the unstable carbonates inside the minerals can be decomposed into metal oxides and then showed higher activity in tar reforming. For instance, dolomites can be chemically active after calcination above 900 °C, and the CaO·MgO (produced from MgCa(CO3)2 → Ca(CO3)MgO + CO2, T > 600 °C); Ca(CO3)MgO → CaO·MgO + CO2, T > 900 °C) is generally considered as the active phase to eliminate tar. In addition, the changes of active phase and morphology change could also take place, and therefore exhibited various performances in syngas production from biomass tar reforming. Zhao et al. [27] employed and modified the limonite by thermal treatment and Ni introduction for biomass tar reforming. They found limonite calcined at 400–700 °C exhibited a different performance, which attributed to the limonite phase changes from goethite (FeOOH) to hematite (Fe2O3) (Fig. 3 a-3c). Furthermore, they observed a volcano trend for the specific surface area of the limonite as the calcination temperature increased and found the limonite with the largest specific surface area at a calcination temperature of 350 °C (183.1 m2/g) was not the most active. The gas yield over calcined limonite (calcined at 700 °C) and reduced limonite reached 25.7 and 41.7 mmol/g, and then 74.1 mmol/g of gas yield was obtained when 30 kPa steam was introduced to the reforming system (Fig. 3 d). Rapagna et al. [29] studied the catalytic performance of olivine and dolomite, and they claimed olivine was more active than calcined dolomite for tar elimination or biomass gasification. Additionally, the introduction of the active metals into natural minerals could enhance the activity for tar reforming or other heterogeneous reactions. For instance, limonite contains the Fe elements (Fe2O3) can be used for support or active metal for catalyst preparation and used limonite can be recycled for iron production. Apart from the limonite, dolomite with the economical characteristics and relatively effective for tar removal are also investigated in recent years. However, pure dolomite without metal addition requires a high temperature to remove the biomass tar. Narváez et al. [30] employed the Seville dolomite and Norte dolomite for biomass tar conversion at 800–835 °C under steam/O2 atmosphere and proved the Norte dolomite with the higher amount of Fe2O3 and bigger pore size had the highest tar conversion (95%) and gas yield. Hervy et al. [28] investigated the evolution of dolomite composition and reactivity during benzene reforming and proposed a mechanism for gas production over the calcined dolomite. As displayed in Fig. 3 e, benzene can be firstly physisorbed over the CaO sites, and the benzene adsorption is the rate-determining step. After that, the ring-opening of benzene is taken place and releases H2 and CH4, and meanwhile, –OH group produced from water dissociation over the MgO can oxidize hydrocarbons to eliminate carbon deposition. Following that, additional –OH will further oxidize intermediates through OH spillover to obtain formiate and other oxygenated C=O species. Finally, the decomposition of formiate can produce unidentate carbonate, which is the main origin of CO2 production. Olivine contains MgO, Fe2O3, and SiO2, which therefore possesses excellent attrition resistance in fluidized bed compared to dolomite during the biomass tar reforming. Rapagna et al. [29] compared the activity of olivine and calcined dolomite in tar steam reforming and observed the high gas yield can be obtained when using olivine. Hence, the active metal and promoters supported on olivine are expected to exhibit higher activity in tar reforming."
4,Alkali metal-based catalyst,"2.3 Alkali metal-based catalyst Alkali metals (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb), have already been reported to be effective for enhancing the gas yield and quality during tar reforming. However, the main problem of alkali catalysts is hard to recovery. Jiang et al. [31] confirmed the performance of inherent alkali and alkaline earth metallic species for biomass tar steam reforming. The results indicated that steam had little influence on the thermal cracking below 900 °C. Alkaline earth metallic species could promote H2 and CO2 production and simultaneously inhibited the production of CO and CH4. Besides, the presence of alkaline earth metallic species stimulated hydrocarbons reforming and water–gas shift (WGS) reactions. Moud et al. [32] altered the gas phase alkali concentrations and investigated their influence on tar catalytic reforming. The KCl solution was firstly atomized and rapidly evaporated to KCl (g) with an aerosol generator. They employed pine pellets for gasification test in bubbling fluidized bed gasifier at 850 °C, and the S and Cl elements effects on reformed results were also investigated. The results indicated that S adsorption had an inhibitory effect on on K uptake. Jiang et al. [33] studied the catalytic behaviors of alkali metal salt in steam gasification of cellulose. They mentioned the temperature has a great influence on gas/tar yield and composition and catalytic activity of KCl. Low reactivity macromolecules or tar can be activated and cracked into H2-rich gas in the presence of KCl. In addition, co-gasification of coal and biomass reported that a high gas yield than biomass or coal gasification, which should be due to the existence of a high amount of alkali and alkali earth metals in the biomass [34]. Overall, the alkali metal in biomass or external addition of alkali metal could enhance the gas yield and quality and then provide a solution for ash treatment. Nevertheless, the recovery difficulties, particle agglomeration, and subsequent loss of activity remain a problem when alkali metals are evaporated during gasification process."
5,Char catalyst,"2.4 Char catalyst As an economical and effective catalyst, char from pyrolysis and gasification of coal or biomass are intensively investigated for tar reforming [35]. Furthermore, the additional energy in the spent char can be released into power production, and the valuable metal in the metal-based char catalyst could also be recovered for further catalyst synthesis. char and metal-loaded char possess highly porous textural structures and optimized properties that can not only obviously promote metal dispersion, but also facilitate absorption and conversion of tar and tar model compounds to hydrocarbon compounds [36,37]. Many researchers considered the char structure and functional groups in/on the char have an influence on the active metal adding and the reactivity of active sites for tar reforming. Besides, the specific surface area, physicochemical structure, pretreatment of the char, and the MSI were also examined and reported in many publications. 2.4.1 Biochar and metal-loaded biochar The attractiveness of biochar/biochar supported metal resulted from highly natural production, easy to obtain, and low cost for tar elimination. Zhang et al. [38] carefully compared the char activity over acid-treated carbon materials (biomass, lignite, etc.) for tar reduction, and the results proved that the five char catalysts showed different performances during the tar reforming. Without the metal addition, the differences between these five catalysts should be due to the variation in the internal structure of the char. The low-rank carbon materials, especially the biomass contains abundant small-aromatic rings, which intend to provide the active site from the carbon defects formation. As indicated by Liu et al. [39], the interactions and adsorptions between the representative tar compounds, phenolic, and the O/N-containing functional groups (Fig. 4 a) were explained. The biochar contains abundant OCSs and N-containing species (NCSs), like C–O, –NH2, –OH, –NH-O-, etc., and the –OH, C–O groups could interact with phenol via hydrogen bond formation. –NH2 as a kind of basic group can also combine with phenol (Lewis acid) through acid-base interaction. The strong electron donation from the –OH group promotes the π electron accumulation and formation of π-π stacking interaction and further enhances the adsorption capacity of the biochar. However, as reported in the literature [40], except for sewage sludge, etc., common biomass (e.g., pinewood and oak sawdust) lacks NCSs, and the trace NCSs could be also decomposed to NO x and HCNO as the calcination temperature rises (see Fig. 4 a). Therefore, the detailed adsorption and reforming mechanism for biomass tar/tar model compound over char derived catalysts are related to the char origin and preparation condition. Min et al. [42] studied the activity of char, char-supported catalysts, and ilmenite for wood tar reforming. They found the char-supported Ni/Fe catalyst exhibited higher activity than ilmenite in tar catalytic elimination, and then the cracked pathway, apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor were also different from that over ilmenite. Besides, they investigated the activity of H-form char alone, Fe-char alone, magnetite (Fe3O4) alone, and a mixture of magnetite and H-form char for reforming of the aromatic ring in tar. The results proved the mixture of magnetite and H-form char was more active than magnetite and H-form char alone, but the mixture produced by physical mixing showed lower activity than Fe-based char prepared by ion exchange. 2.4.2 Coal char and metal-loaded coal char As the traditional fossil energy, the measures should be taken and then achieve the green conversion and upgrading of coal. As stated in the literature, the coal, especially low-rank coal (lignite) with the abundant OCSs and porous structure has already been reported to have the potential to prepare metal-based catalyst via ion-exchange [43]. However, OCSs in lignite structure are usually connected with the Na, K, Mg, Ca, etc., and the insoluble minerals also exited in the lignite [44,45]. In this case, Ren et al. [46] selectively removed the organic salts and insoluble minerals from the Shengli lignite by HCl or HCl-HF treatment and further oxidized these precursors to increase the OCSs of Shengli lignite. Modified lignite was used to prepare Ni/C catalyst and applied for biomass volatile reforming. They observed the lignite demineralization by HCl-HF and/or further H2O2 treatment caused the corrosion of pore structure and decreases the specific surface area. Interestingly, the Ni loaded on AWSL (Ni/AWSL) removed the organic salts meanwhile retain the mineral activity, which possessed 3.8 mmol/g carboxyl group after H2O2 treatment and largest specific space area (291.1 m2/g), highest Ni loading (17.3%), and smallest Ni crystallite size (3.4 nm), as well as the highest activity for biomass tar reforming. To explain the activity of Ni/AWSL, Ren et al. [24] employed various techniques for catalyst characterization and considered the abundant Ni (111) plane and porous layered delocalized electronic structure of the catalyst provided an excellent platform for electron transfer and stimulated tar catalytic reforming (Fig. 4 b). Ren et al. [47] further introduced Ce into Ni-based lignite char and evaluated the catalytic performance and stability of the Ni-Ce/lignite char in biomass tar reforming. They considered that the high and stable gas yield over Ce-doped Ni/modified lignite char were attributed to the formation of a Ni–Ce alloy. Especially the Ni-Ce/modified lignite char with a Ni/Ce weight ratio of 50: 1 showed the highest gas yield (69.1%) and low carbon deposition (weight increase of 1.7%). Unlike other metal-based oxides catalysts, the commonly used regeneration method for coke elimination (i.e., calcination under air) is not suitable for char catalysts. Hence, many researchers focus the enhancement the anti-coke ability of char derived catalyst, and the modification of Ni-based catalyst with promoters have been reported to be effective for extending the catalyst lifetime. After the addition of other metals, the metallic Ni will be strongly bonded with Ni in the form of alloy and therefore exhibited the excellent anti-coke ability [48]. Yang et al. [37] synthesized Ni-Co/acid-washed lignite char and used it for corncob tar reforming evaluation at 450 °C. In their study, they proved the bimetallic Ni-10%Co/acid-washed lignite char possessed the highest H2 yield of 36.3 mmol H2/gcorncob and syngas formation rate (710 μmol/min/g). They explained the superior activity of Ni-Co-based catalysts at low temperature should be the high Ni dispersion, better reducibility, and electronic environment, respectively. Furthermore, the synergy of Ni (111) and Co (220) was also the reason for high syngas yield and great selectivity for H2-rich syngas production. In addition to developing an excellent method to improve the anti-coke ability of metal-loaded char, it is attractive that the active metal and energy of the spent catalysts can be recovered for resynthesis of metal-loaded char and power generation through combustion [41]."
6,Other catalysts,"2.5 Other catalysts Ni-based catalysts were extensively investigated and employed for biomass tar elimination due to their low cost, high activity for tar destruction, methane reforming, and WGS reaction [49]. Furthermore, the Ni-based catalyst could exhibit anti-coke, anti-S, and also reduce NO x ability after being modified by other promoters [50]. Various raw materials or synthesized together with Ni have been therefore extensively studied for tar reforming, the excellent support with the suitable acidity/basicity and the interaction with active Ni play the key role in catalyst preparation and reforming reaction. Until now, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and CeO2 as support for Ni-based catalysts preparation are proved to be active for biomass tar cracking [18]. However, the Ni-based catalysts without other promoters are easily sintered and then deactivated under reaction conditions. As a result, the optimal metal promoters, like Mg and Co were added to improve the activity and stability of as-prepared Ni-based catalysts in tar reforming. Santamaria et al. [51] modified Ni/Al2O3 with CeO2 and MgO promoters for improving performance for pinewood tar reforming. They found the activity of Ni/Al2O3, Ni/MgO-Al2O3, and Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 are similar, while the Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 exhibited the highest stability. The unstable activity of Ni/MgO-Al2O3 should be attributed to the formation of MgAl2O4 spinel phase, which is hard to reduce. Wu et al. [52] investigated the activity of Ni/MCM-41 with different Ni loading (5, 10, 20, and 40 wt%) for wood sawdust tar reforming. Through x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) characterizations, the NiO particles were highly dispersed inside the pores of Ni/MCM-41 with the Ni loading of 5, 10, and 20 wt%. They observed the H2 production was increased from 30.1 to 50.6 vol% with the Ni loading increasing from 5 to 40 wt% during tar reforming. Zhang et al. [53] obtained the gaseous products rich in H2 and CH4 from pine sawdust tar reforming and methanation over Ni/hematite in free-ball and moving bed. Under the conditions of 500 to 600 °C, S/B = 0.4, and the optimal bed materials ratio (Ni/hematite: calcined limestone: 20% quartz sand = 1:3:1), the total gas yield of H2 and CH4 reached above 97 vol%. Nishikawa et al. [54] compared the promotion of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru on Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 for cedar wood gasification in a dual bed reactor. They found the Pt addition in Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 is in favor of syngas production, but noble metal addition cannot inhibit carbon deposition. Interestingly, the unreduced Ni-Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 possessed the same activity as the reduced one, which could attribute to high interaction between Ni and Pt. As we discussed above, Ni-based catalysts were found to be active for tar elimination in the optimal reactor at a relatively low temperature. However, the Ni-based catalysts are easily deactivated by coke deposition and particle growth, especially under a steam atmosphere or longtime running [36,55]. Apart from Ni-based catalysts, Fe- and Co-based catalysts are proved to exhibit comparable activity in syngas production from biomass tar reforming. Adnan et al. [56] synthesized Fe2O3/SiO2-γAl2O3 using a one-pot method and proved it was thermally stable and active for toluene steam reforming. The addition of Fe could significantly affect catalyst acidity, and further influenced its performance in toluene conversion. In addition, more amount of Fe was found to accelerate the Al2O3 collapse and promote γ-Al2O3 phase transformation. Finally, they confirmed the Fe2O3/ SiO2-γAl2O3 with optimized Fe content and Si content of 10 wt% and 15 wt% showed the maximum toluene conversion (76%). Tasaka and Tsutsumi [57] identified the activity of catalysts with the different Co loading of 0–36 wt% for biomass tar reforming in a fluidized bed reactor. They considered that tar conversion was mainly dependent on the specific surface area of the catalyst, and Co/MgO catalyst with 12 wt% Co loading exhibited 16% of tar conversion. In particular, they focused on the content and interconversion of water-soluble and water-insoluble tar over the designed catalyst and found water-insoluble tar can be produced from decarboxylation of water-soluble tar. Wang et al. [58] compared the activity of Fe/Al2O3, Co/Al2O3, and Fe-Co/Al2O3 in steam reforming of cedarwood tar, and the results demonstrated the Fe-Co/Al2O3 with Fe/Co = 0.25 possessed higher performance than monometallic Co and Fe catalysts in terms of the gas production and coke resistance. The characterizations indicated that the fcc Fe-Co alloy and bcc Co–Fe alloy were the main compositions, and the Fe/Co ratio in the bcc Co–Fe alloy was higher than that in the fcc Co–Fe alloy phase. After the reaction, the oxidation of bcc Co–Fe alloy was responsible for the activity loss in toluene reforming (as tar model compound). However, after numerous attempts, Fe and Co are frequently chosen as promoters for Ni-based catalysts preparation to enhance activity and gas production from biomass tar reforming. In general, the noble metal-catalyst (Rh, Pt, Pd, etc.) was proved to be highly active and stable for heterogeneous reactions at low temperatures [54]. Tomishige et al. [59] prepared and compared the activity over CeO2–SiO2 supported Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ni for cedar tar reforming, and they found tar can be almost completely converted to gas products in the presence of Rh/CeO2–SiO2 catalyst at 550 °C. In comparison with other noble metal-based catalysts, Rh/CeO2–SiO2 exhibited higher activity for tar cracking, gas production, and coke resistance. Even though, there have not enough literatures to study the noble metal-catalysts for tar elimination for the reason of the expensive price. To have a clear comparison, the preparation, operation condition, and the activity of the mentioned catalysts are listed in Table 2 . Recently, hydrotalcite-derived and perovskite-derived catalysts with better metal dispersion, thermal stability, and other tailored properties have been well investigated in biomass tar/tar model compounds reforming. Jangam et al. [61] fabricated La1-xSrx-Co0.5Ti0.5O3-δ perovskite catalysts using the ethylene glycol assisted sol–gel method and employed them for steam reforming of toluene. In particular, they employed C2HCl3 and H2S as tar contaminants to investigate the activity and stability of La1-xSrx-Co0.5Ti0.5O3-δ catalysts. La0.8Sr0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 with an optimum composition exhibited superior activity in toluene conversion (∼90%) and syngas production at 700 °C (S/C = 2), and the toluene conversion could be maintained at 80% and 65% in the presence of 0.1 % and 1% of C2HCl3 at 700 °C. The excellent activity of La0.8Sr0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalyst was attributed to the mobile O species and available Co species, together with optimum basic characteristics, which significantly promoted the CO2 adsorption and coke elimination. Jayaprakash et al. [62] synthesized hydrotalcite-derived CeO2-NiO-MgO-Al2O3 catalyst via homogeneous urea hydrolysis and found it showed excellent H2S resistance in steam reforming of toluene. The results of H2-TPR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the addition of Ce could improve the reducibility of the catalysts, and the catalyst with 20% of CeO2 (20Ce-NMA) could give a toluene conversion of 96%. Interestingly, the catalyst with 15% of CeO2 (15Ce-NMA) possessed quicker recovery than other catalysts after deactivation by carbon deposition. Raman analysis indicated that the high amount of graphitic carbon in the 20Ce-NMA was the deactivation reason during toluene reforming. To have a better quality of H2-rich gas, more economical and convenient methods for catalyst preparation should be studied based on a clear mechanism. Although minerals, alkali metal-based, char, and char supported metal, and other metal-based catalysts are effective for tar elimination, the reaction especially the deactivation pathways are still not well overcome."
7,Obstacles and solutions in integration with downstream technology,
8,Integration and challenges of gasification and downstream technology,"3.1 Integration and challenges of gasification and downstream technology Biomass can be used for syngas production and then for methane, and other chemical production via F-T synthesis, etc. Methane production from CO/CO2 hydrogenation (Sabatier reaction) is an important energy carrier to the industry, energy, and transportation sectors [63]. CO/CO2 hydrogenation into methane usually employed the group VIII metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt, etc.) as the catalyst for high CO2/CO conversion [64,65]. Methanol, as an important fundamental chemical [66], is commonly used as solvent and feedstock for chemicals and fuel additives production (acetic acid, formaldehyde, dimethyl terephthalate, methyl methacrylate, etc.) [67]. Commercially, methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is more attractive than CO hydrogenation, which can provide an effective way of decreasing greenhouse gases [68]. Recent literatures claimed that a mixture with a proper H2/CO2/CO can decrease the apparent activation energy of the reaction and then increase the methanol yield [69]. Higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols) have attracted increasing focus from syngas/CO2 hydrogenation, which possessing high energy density and low vapor pressure could be used as an alternative for fuel and fuel additives for industrial application [70]. Due to the limitations of chemical and technological barriers, there are no commercial processes developed until now [71]. The production of C2+ alcohols from syngas start in 1900s and several catalysts like Rh- and Mo-based, modified F–T, or methanol synthesis catalysts have been designed. Meanwhile, synthesis investigations about the C2+ alcohols from CO2 and H2 attract less attention since CO2 is stable and more energy is required to realize this conversion. Recently, some researchers have developed some highly active catalysts (e.g., Co-based, Ru-based, and Pt-based catalyst) for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+ alcohols. Herein, the related reactions for these chemicals production at different H2/CO2 or H2/CO ratios are listed below and the detailed discussion is presented in Section 4 . As listed in Table 3 , the gas reactants with different H2/CO/CO2 compositions can be catalyzed to different chemicals under different conditions. Therefore, it is important to produce gaseous with a pure composition and optimal reactants ratio from biomass gasification before delivery to the next technology. Another thing is the tailored catalyst for catalytic conversion of H2-rich gas with dynamic composition, which should still be selective for production of methane, methanol, C2+ alcohols, etc. To conclude, H2-rich gas from gasification and further for methane, methanol, C2+ higher alcohols, etc. production in downstream technology is promising alternatives for liquid fuels and value-added chemicals generation in the presence of catalyst [3,72]. Methanation and methanol synthesis from syngas have already been industrialized, and the high conversion of CO2 hydrogenation for methane, C2+ higher alcohols is also possible when the stable catalysts are introduced. However, more literatures fixed the feed compositions and usually carried out the reaction at lab-scale, and therefore the dynamic compositions of gas together with gas purity (fly ash, H2S, and NH3) should be considered in piratical utilization. The fly ashes with different compositions and amounts depending on the industries lead to dangerous influences on human health and environment [73]. The bag filters or cyclone separators is usually employed to separate fly ash, and wet scrubber is also proved to be effective for syngas cleaning. As we mentioned in the next sections, the formed tar, H2S, NH3, etc. can be cleaned using the different catalysts, and therefore the efficient conversion of syngas produced from biomass gasification should be the most important issue. The main gas compositions (H2/CO/CO2/CH4) from the reforming of different biomass tar are listed in Table 4 . From Table 4, it can observe the gas composition depends on the biomass types and catalyst used in tar cracking. We previously [24] fabricated a Ni-based modified lignite char catalyst for biomass tar reforming, and we observed the composition of H2-rich gas can be tailored to 1.6–6.3 at different reforming temperatures under inert and steam atmospheres (Fig. 5 a). It indicates the potential use of produced gas over the catalyst for methane, methanol, and other fuels synthesis via catalytic conversion or F-T technology. Im-orb et al. [79], Zeng et al. [80], and Liu et al. [81] have already investigated the effects of biomass/steam ratio, catalyst types, cold gas efficiency on the syngas composition and yield, and the tailored composition of feeding gas is possible to realize for downstream utilization. Secondly, the excellent compatibility and conversion for H2-rich gas (from gasification) converting into methane, methanol, C2+ alcohols are important to integrate different conversion processes. Due to the exothermic characterization of methanation of CO and CO2, increasing H2/CO2 or H2/CO ratio to stoichiometric ratio and heat removal will enhance the CO/CO2 conversion and reaction efficiency during the methanation process. As shown in Fig. 5 b and 5c, the CO conversion and CH4 selectivity are always high when the methanation temperature at below 500 °C, and then byproducts will be produced from the WGS and RWGS when the temperature is further increased [84]. For the methanol synthesis, Li et al. [85] prepared an Rh‐In catalyst and used it for methanol synthesis with a H2/CO ratio of 1:3–3:1, which possessed the optimal adsorption properties to the intermediates and promoted methanol production (Fig. 5 d). The Rh‐In catalyst inhibited the RWGS under H2‐deficient atmosphere and exhibited highly competitive methanol productivity under industrially applicable conditions. Jiao et al. [82] fabricated a ZnCrO x catalyst for syngas direct conversion to light olefins (C2 =–C4 =). They considered the catalyst may allow the use of syngas with different H2/CO ratios from coal or biomass gasification for light olefins production. The results indicated selectivity of C2 =−C4 = and C2 − C4 varied from 67% to 80%, and 81% to 94%, respectively, under the condition of H2/CO of 0.5–3.0. Ding et al. [86] and Lin et al. [87] also carefully investigated the effects of H2/CO/CO2 on the CO/CO2 conversion and selectivity of olefins, and they proved the excellent catalyst with tailored properties was possible for enduring the dynamic compositions. The above illustration proved the existed catalysts are feasible for flexible H2-rich gas into chemicals via advanced downstream technology. However, the accurate gas composition with optimal stoichiometric ratio may have a great improvement for syngas conversion from biomass gasification and realizing integration with downstream technology. In this case, the last issue is the introduction of the external energy and resource into the system. For example, gasification technology can be connected into power to gas (PtG) network, and therefore produce more valuable fuels through methanation, F-T synthesis, etc. As shown in Fig. 6 , PtG process converts surplus power into H2 by water electrolysis and then connects to the downstream technology together with gasification gas. Besides, the other required CO2 could be captured from the industrial waste gas or air, which can be further converted into value-added chemicals via F-T synthesis in the presence of the corresponding catalyst. Therefore, syngas production and composition adjustment during biomass tar reforming is the key route to combine and transform renewable and fossil energy into methane, methanol, ethanol, higher alcohols in the concept. Like biomass tar reforming, the excellent catalyst is also important for the synthesis of methane, methanol, etc., and other detailed parameters and common catalysts in downstream process will be discussed in the following sections."
9,NH3 and H2S removal,"3.2 NH3 and H2S removal Like particulate matters, NCSs, and S-containing species (SCSs) are always produced and sustained in the gaseous products [6,88–91], and most NCSs (60–80%) will be converted to NH3 in gasification in the presence of catalyst [92], and then around 50%–90% NH3 in produced gas would form NO through a complex radical pathway after combustion [93]. A suitable catalyst is required to eliminate NH3 from the product gas in secondary catalytic processes at low temperatures [94]. Many tar-cracked catalysts (e.g., Ni-based, Fe-based, Ru-based, and minerals) were also proved to be active for NH3 reduction (2NH3 → 3H2 + N2) or selective oxidation (4NH3 + 3O2 → 2 N2 + 6H2O) [95,96]. Ohtsuka et al. [97] synthesized Fe and Ca supported on brown coal char and identified catalyst with lower Fe loading and higher dispersion was better for NH3 decomposition at 750 °C, space velocity of 45000 h−1. Also, the promoters such as Mo and Pt can further enhance its performance for NH3 conversion [98,99]. For instance, Ni–Pt/Al2O3 almost realized complete conversion of NH3 (97.4%) at 560 °C [99]. Mojtahedi and Abbasian [100] compared the activity of Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3, and they found Ru/Al2O3 (95.3% conversion) was more active than Ni/Al2O3 (90.4% conversion) for NH3 decomposition at 850 °C. Meanwhile, Ru supported on Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2 have been widely investigated for NH3 conversion, and the results claimed the Al2O3-supported Ru or Ru–Ni catalysts was more active for NH3 conversion in simulated coal-derived syngas [101]. However, the deactivation of catalyst by carbon deposition from gasification (containing tar, CO, and CH4) and H2S formation hindered its further development [102]. SCSs, like COS and H2S produced from gasification could lead to catalyst deactivation and environmental pollution, and H2S is particularly poisonous to Ni-based catalysts through mNi + nH2S → NimSn + n/2H2. The activity of spent catalyst can be regenerated in the presence of steam, H2, and CO at 900 °C via the formulas: (NiS + H2O → NiO + H2S, NiO + H2 → Ni + H2O, and NiO + CO → Ni + CO2) [95]. Husmann et al. [103] presented in-situ desulfurization in gasification over lime, limestone, calcined and raw dolomite. The effects of temperature, space velocity, and steam were investigated, and the results revealed that raising the temperature from 700 to 825 °C has no effect on the residual H2S content, but H2S in the catalyst was increased with the steam amount increased from 30 to 42 vol%. A clear difference can be observed for H2S removal over different catalysts, the calcined dolomite possessed the worst conversion for H2S removal. Moon et al. [104] employed the molten tin as a working fluid for producer gas cleaning from gasification of empty fruit bunch pellets. The results showed that the removal efficiencies of tar and H2S at 400 °C are about 80% and 97%, respectively. Meng et al. [105] and Vamvuka et al. [106] presented great reviews on gas cleaning, and they believed the H2S can be removed from the reaction with metal oxides by forming a solid sulfide. Besides, Roller et al. [107] proved the sorbents like ETS-2 supported Cu, Cu-Cr, and Ce-ETS-2 were also active for H2S removal under simulated gasification conditions."
10,Deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst,"3.3 Deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst As stated above, the produced gas from tar reforming with different H2/CO ratios still can be used for chemicals production through hydrogenation with the tailored catalysts, and the absent H2 can be supplied by PtG technology from the renewable energy to have a high CO/CO2 conversion. Furthermore, the clean-up of the gaseous pollutants (i.e., NCSs and SCSs) in the gas outlet is well discussed, but the deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst are essential to obtain a stable gas production for downstream technology during a long-term operation. First of all, carbon deposition is one of the major causes of catalyst deactivation during biomass tar/tar model compound reforming. Based on the coke location, the coke can be deposited on the surface of active metal, support, and interface of metal-promoter and/or metal-support interface [108,109]. As presented in Fig. 7 a, it can be divided into encapsulating coke, filamentous coke, and pyrolytic coke according to the coke morphologies [109]. Encapsulating coke is generated through the adsorption, subsequent condensation, or polymerization of biomass tar (CxHyOz) over the metal sites, and finally resulting in metal particles encapsulated by coke film. It is the most common process for generating filamentous coke that dissociation of adsorbed coke to atomic carbon on metal sites, carbon diffusion on the metal surface, nucleation, continuous growth, and separation of the metal crystal from the surface. After a long time-on-stream (TOS) running of the tar reforming at high temperature, the metal surface and the voids created by filamentous coke can be encapsulated and filled by pyrolytic coke, but it is rarely reported the catalyst deactivation by it due to the coke can be directly removed through combustion. Ochoa et al. [110] investigated the catalyst deactivation over commercial Ni-based catalyst contains NiO, CaAl2O4, and Al2O3 during biomass tar reforming in a fluidized bed reactor. The results showed that catalyst deactivation was mainly attributed to the Ni sintering (25 nm to 39 nm) and coke encapsulation over Ni particles. The oxygenates (especially phenols) condensation was the reason for carbon formation, and the coke formation rate decreased from 0.30 mgcoke/gcatalyst/min to 0.20 mgcoke/gcatalyst/min during 0–50 min and 50–100 min TOS after reduction of uncovered Ni particles. Fig. 7 b depicted coke location and composition (H/C and/or O/C relationships) on the surface of the catalyst. Coke I was generated from one or a combination of (i) coke located on the metallic sites, (ii) amorphous and higher aliphatics content of coke, and then coke II was ascribed to coke located on the carrier and/or highly ordered aromatics. As TOS increased, carbon deposition mainly occurred in the surroundings of the metallic sites and/or located on the surface of catalyst or promoters, coke II with a fast deposition rate was becoming the main carbon species. As listed in Table 5 , the deactivation of the catalyst by carbon deposition could be regenerated by introducing O2, H2O, and H2 and subsequently reduction. Min et al. [111] used ilmenite for reforming biomass tar and found the continuous carbon deposition on the surface of catalyst inhibited catalyst stability and activity. Through the combustion of catalyst at 800 °C for 20 min under air, the activity of the catalyst cannot fully be recovered due to the existence of another deactivation reason during the reforming. Indeed, the catalyst deactivation usually does not come from a single reason, the other deactivation reasons (e.g., sintering) should be considered. Recently, some researchers developed anti-coking catalysts like perovskite-derived catalysts and metal-promoted catalysts for biomass tar reforming, which have already been well discussed by previous researchers [9,112–114]. It is noted that the activity of char-derived catalysts deactivated by carbon deposition in tar reforming cannot be regenerated by combustion, and the introduction of steam could lead to support gasification. Therefore, the addition of metals like Fe, Ce, and Co are usually employed for enhancing the stability of the catalyst during biomass tar reforming. Furthermore, the active metal and excess energy of the deactivated char-derived catalyst can be recovered by combustion, and therefore using cheap char-derived catalysts has become the research focus in recent years [115]. Secondly, literatures revealed that NCSs and SCSs will continue to react with the active site of catalyst and result in catalyst rapid deactivation/poisoning during biomass tar/tar model compound reforming [116,117]. For instance, the chemisorption of SCSs on the Ni-based catalyst could result in intermediate formation between Ni and S, and then continuously decrease available Ni active sites for biomass tar reforming (Ni + H2S → Ni-S + H2). Engelen et al. [50] developed 1 wt.%/0.5 wt% Ni-Ca on porous filter discs through urea method and used for gas cleaning including tar and particle removal from biomass gasification. The effect of H2S concentrations on the reforming of benzene, naphthalene, and mixtures of benzene and naphthalene were investigated. They observed the benzene conversion reached 93%, 78%, and 57% under 50, 100, and 200 ppm H2S atmospheres, but the heavy tars, like naphthalene and mixtures of benzene and naphthalene were responsible for catalyst deactivation during biomass gasification. They found naphthalene conversion reached 98% under 100 ppm H2S, and the addition of CaO can significantly improve the anti-sulfur activity of the catalyst. Dou et al. [118] studied the poisoning effect of H2S and HCl on Ni-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts during steam reforming of naphthalene. The different activities over the catalyst after introducing H2S and HCl can be attributed to the reforming was catalyzed by different active sites on the Ni surface. The poisoning of catalyst in the reforming of naphthalene was only caused by H2S rather than HCl when both compounds existed in the gas, and the active sites decreasing were assigned to Ni-S formation. Besides, the decreasing of specific surface area and increasing of metal size caused by other purities like NH3 and ash (K2SO4, KCl, and ZnCl2) could affect the catalyst activity in biomass tar reforming. Due to oxidation of the metal center, the trace NOx in the reforming can also lead to catalyst deactivation. Unfortunately, it is reported that catalyst poisoning by sulfur is almost irreversible (Eqs. 25 and 26), and therefore excellent design of anti-sulfur catalyst and S removal before and after feeding biomass tar should be the best choice. In recent years, effective catalysts have been designed for obtaining a stable gas production in the presence of H2S, Gao et al. [9] recently concluded the existed anti-poisoning catalysts in tar reforming, and stated that enhanced stability of the catalyst can be obtained by tuning electronic surroundings, separating active sites, tailoring oxygen vacancy, etc. At last, in addition to carbon deposition and poisoning, oxidation, sintering, and structure destruction are also the common deactivation reaction in heterogeneous catalysis. During the continuous production of reducible gas (i.e., H2 and CO), catalyst oxidation is usually not a reason for catalyst deactivation in tar reforming. Metal sintering involves particle size growth and agglomeration during the long TOS reforming at high temperatures, and the surface area of active sites will be deceased and results in carbon deposition. In addition, the support type, metal amount, and flow rate of reactants can influence the sintering rate and degree [119–121]. Atomic migration and crystallite migration are the formation mechanism of the catalyst sintering during the reforming of biomass tar/tar model compound. In general, it is considered to be useful that utilization of metal-support interaction, the synergy effect of the bimetallic catalysts, and promoters addition to promoting the anti-sintering activity of the catalyst during biomass tar reforming. Currently, perovskite-derived catalysts with an excellent oxygen migration can oxidize Ni-S to sulfates and sulfites, and then significantly improved the H2S tolerance of the catalyst [21,122]."
11,Value-added chemicals production from downstream technology,
12,Methane production,"4.1 Methane production Short introduction. As mentioned in section 3.1, the CO2 or CO methanation is a reversible exothermic reaction, which therefore requires the optimized heterogonous catalyst and feed gas ratio to promote the CO/CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity. Both methanation of CO and CO2 are highly exothermic except for side reaction RWGS which is an endothermic reaction. For this reason, a large amount of heat produced from methanation should be removed to control the methanation temperature. Due to the existence of some side reactions, the deposited carbon would cover the surface of the catalyst and then reduce the catalyst pores or blockage reactors [123]. Besides, a small amount of hydrocarbon could be found in gaseous products [124]. To conclude, an optional catalyst and reactor would show high CH4 selectivity and stability towards methane production. Catalysts. The previous researchers screened many noble and transition metal-based catalysts for methanation reactions. The high compatibility for dynamic CO/CO2 feeding and cheap price, easy preparation, and regeneration, etc. are important in combination with gasification, PtG, and other technology. Although Fe is an economically active metal and can be operated at high temperatures, the low CH4 selectivity during the methanation hindered the development of Fe-based catalyst [125]. Metal Co normally exhibits similar activity with Ni-based catalyst during methanation. The Mo-based catalyst usually shows the high C2+ hydrocarbons selectivity and low S-resistance than others for methanation [126]. Also, noble metal-based catalysts are active and highly stable for many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Ni-based catalysts possess the properties of highly selective and low price are the most promising active metal for commercial application. Ni/Al2O3 are easily deactivated for the reason of carbon deposition, sintering, pore blockage, and metal Ni oxidation [127], the addition of promoter and specific properties modification, have already proved to be helpful to enhance the catalyst activity. Liu et al. [128] investigated the effect of CeO2 addition on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, and they found Ni-CeO2/Al2O3 with 2 wt% CeO2 showed the highest activity of 71% CO2 conversion than Ni/Al2O3 (45% CO2 conversion) and > 99% CH4 selectivity at 300 °C. Rivero-Mendoza et al. [129] prepared the Ni-La/γ-Al2O3 and employed in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to discuss the mechanism of CO2 methanation. They proved the state changes between Ni2+ and LaOx species are the reason for methanation and the methanation pathways should be CO routes. Except for Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and CeO2 metal oxides are also the common carrier for methanation catalyst preparation. ZrO2 as excellent support has been intensively studied in the last decades, which shows the superior ability to absorb CO2, and promote the methanation by H spillover [130]. Jia et al. [130] found Ni/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by the plasma decomposition possessed Ni(111) plane, and oxygen vacancies can enhance cooperation between Ni and interfacial active sites, and then improved CO2 adsorption and activation. Parastaev et al. [65] synthesized the Co/CeZrO4 and deeply studied the MSI on the activity for CO2 hydrogenation into methane. After being carefully characterized by advanced techniques, they revealed the surficial active sites were responsible for the high performance. They demonstrated how the varied support size can be used to adjust the MSIs and further enhanced CO2 methanation. Surprisingly, they considered the oxygen vacancy can be created from the reverse oxygen spillover from the carrier (Fig. 8 ). In other words, the Co particles were stabilized by CeZrO4 with intermediate size, and the dissociated CO/CO2 was further hydrogenated into methane. Aside from metal oxides, some literatures reported hydrotalcite-like material with the tailored properties has already proved to be effective in CO/CO2 hydrogenation [131]. Bian et al. [132] synthesized Ni-Al hydrotalcite-like catalyst for CO methanation, and they observed almost 100% CO conversion over hydrotalcite-like catalyst with different Ni/Al molar ratios at 400–500 °C. Ren et al. [64] fabricated the hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Al supports with the different morphologies, and then supported 20 wt% Ni for CO2 methanation. They claimed Ni/HT-10 with a “rosette-like” structure, high basicity, optimized pore size, active Ni (111) plane and high exposed metallic surface area possessed superior CO2 conversion (83.5%) and a TOF of 13.5 min−1 at 400 °C, and stable performance during 120 h measurement. For noble-based catalysts, like Ru-based catalysts have been proved to be around 120 times more active than Ni-based catalysts for methanation of CO/CO2 or mixtures and are usually used for kinetic study and mechanism investigation. Du et al. [133] prepared a series of active metals supported on the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and compared their activity in CO2 methanation. The results indicated the Ru- and Rh-based MSN catalysts were the most active catalyst and the basicity and the existence of oxygen vacancy on surface-active sites were the reason for methane formation. Mechanisms. Methanation mechanisms in the presence of CO2 or CO or mixtures of CO and CO2 are important to guide highly active catalyst design. Aside from the conventional characterizations such as XRD, SEM, and TEM, in-situ DRIFTS and operando extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) technologies are the common methods to investigate methane formation in the presence of a catalyst. According to the intermediate species and cleavage way of C–O bond, researchers considered the associative pathway and dissociative pathway are the main pathways for methane formation from CO/CO2 hydrogenation. For methanation of CO, the associative pathway and dissociative pathway can be briefly explained as follows: (1) associative pathway: adsorbed H combined with –C=O to form adsorbed –CHO/–COH, C–O breaking and continuous hydrogenation to methane; (2) dissociative pathway: CO is firstly dissociated and adsorbed on the catalyst surface as adsorbed C and adsorbed O, followed by the continuous hydrogenation of adsorbed C to produce methane. These two pathways for CO hydrogenation have already been proved and identified by in-situ DRIFTS and density functional theory (DFT) over Ru-based and Ni-based catalysts [134,135]. As presented in Fig. 9 , the mechanisms for CO2 methanation could be divided into (1) associative pathway: absorbed CO2 react with adsorbed H and form oxygenates intermediates, after that, the intermediates are subsequently hydrogenated to methane; (2) dissociative pathway: CO2 is first dissociated to adsorbed –C=O and adsorbed O and followed by hydrogenation to methane. The synergy effect of the active site and structure defects of the heterogeneous catalysts proved to be selective for CO/CO2 and H2 adsorption. Zhao et al. [136] tailored a bimetallic Ni-Co alloy catalyst for CO methanation. They proved the electron enrichment of Ni and Co in the Ni-Co alloy promoted CO dissociation, hydrogen spillover, and CO2 adsorption, and therefore improved the CO2 conversion, CH4 formation and inhibited the carbon deposition. The CO conversion and CH4 selectivity reached 98% and 78% below 380 °C, and the performance of the catalysts was still stable after 100 h running. Wang et al. [137] designed a bimetallic Ni@Rh core–shell catalyst by galvanic replacement method. The excellent activity of RhNi/Al2O3 should be the highly dispersed Rh encapsulating Ni nanoparticles and the stronger interaction between Rh and Ni. Operando IR spectroscopy identified the CO2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation (via spillover from Rh sites) over Al2O3 as a catalytic spectator in methanation. Vrijburg et al. [138] fabricated NiMn/TiO2 and evaluated the catalytic performance for CO2 methanation by nanoscale characterization STEM-EDX and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), mechanistic study, and DFT calculations. The results revealed the MnO clusters promoted CO2 adsorption and facilitated CO2 activation, and therefore could realize maximum hydrogenation of CO2."
13,Methanol production,"4.2 Methanol production Short introduction. Hydrogenation of syngas to methanol is the conventional method for methanol production, which is generally generated from nature or produced from traditional fuels. Meanwhile, CO2 hydrogenation into methanol has been focused to be attractive way on environmental protection in the past decades. The required H2, CO, and CO2 for methanol synthesis could be produced from biomass/coal steam reforming or partial oxidation of CH4, and generated from splitting of water and PtG is also an essential component to reducing the fossil energy consumption [139]. Methanol synthesis from CO and CO2 hydrogenation are thermodynamically limited and exothermic reactions, and the presence of produced H2O could accelerate the sintering of metal active sites and deactivate the catalyst and subsequently decrease the methanol production [140]. Therefore, an efficient catalyst is needed to promote CO/CO2 activation and simultaneously prevent the side reaction and catalyst deactivation. Catalysts. Cu, Zn, and Pd-based catalysts have been proved to be highly active for methanol synthesis from CO and CO2 hydrogenation [139,141]. The addition of Ga2O3, Nb2O5, and ZnO as structure and electronic promoters were also investigated to facilitate the activity and selectivity for methanol synthesis, which can prevent active metal sintering. ZrO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 as the common support for supporting active metal have already been proved to enhance the thermal stability of the active phase, which also realize the higher exposure and anti-sintering of active sites. In the meantime, the specific acidity/basicity of the support also improves the adsorption of the molecules and for a particular reaction. Kuld et al. [142] fabricated the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and carefully evaluated the CO hydrogenation to methanol, and they explained the promoter effects on the activity and selectivity for CO conversion. After activity measurement, surface area titration, and DFT calculations, they claimed the activity promotion could be attributed to Zn migration on the surface of Cu. Martin et al. [143] evaluated the methanol production over In2O3 supported on ZrO2 and observed the high activity, selectivity, and stability during 1000 h running. Comparing with Cu-ZnO-Al2O3, the high activity of In2O3-based catalysts should be due to the creation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies, and the oxygen defects can be enhanced by co-feeding CO and electronic interactions with the ZrO2 support. Wang et al. [144] reported a ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution could realize the 91% selectivity with the high CO2 single-pass conversion (above 10%). After a series of in-situ characterization and theoretical calculations, the synergetic effect between Zn and Zr sites should be responsible for the excellent activity. Furthermore, the ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution catalyst shows high stability, anti-sintering, and anti-S ability in the reaction stream. As depicted in Fig. 10 , HCOO*, H3CO* species can be observed from in-situ DRIFTS. Through the DFT calculation, and the formation of HCOO* species via CO2* hydrogenation is energetically favorable. Therefore, the formation pathway of methanol should be as follows: HCOO* is hydrogenated by an OH* group and forms a H2COOH* species, and then C-O is cleaved to H2CO* and OH* on Zr and Zn sites. Finally, the H2CO* is subsequently protonated to methanol. Mechanisms. Due to the interconversion of CO and CO2 via WGS and RWGS reaction, CO hydrogenation and CO2 methanation over Cu-based catalysts have already been industrialized [145]. The most acceptable pathways for methanol synthesis are CO2 hydrogenation: HCOO*, H2COO* (HCOOH*), H2COOH*, H2CO*, H3CO*, H3COH, and CO hydrogenation: HCO*, H2CO*, H3CO*, H3COH. Some researchers proposed the HCO* formation from CO hydrogenation is hard because of the higher energy barrier (0.45 eV) than CO desorption (0.03 eV) [146,147]. The reaction pathway through carboxyl (COOH*) or formate (HCOO*) species is the major debate on methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation. The mechanisms for CO and CO2 hydrogenation are proposed, which is consisted of possible reaction steps when pure CO2, CO, or mixtures of CO2 and CO hydrogenations are introduced. Formate formation is the main pathway for CO2 hydrogenation while the formyl-based pathway is responsible for methanol production from CO hydrogenation. Yang et al. [146] compared the catalytic performance of Cu(111), Cu nanoclusters, and Cu/ZnO(0001̅) on methanol synthesis, proved formate was kinetically favorable during methanol formation on Cu surface through DFT calculations. Yang et al. [148] further added transition metals on Cu(111) for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. The methanol yield decreases in the order: Ni/Cu(111) > Pt/Cu(111) > Ph/Cu(111) > Cu(111) > Au/Cu(111). They considered the formation of COOH* intermediate is faster than HCOO* intermediate, which can be generated from RWGS and CO hydrogenation. The kinetic study revealed the yield of CH3OH from CO2 hydrogenation can be influenced by: (1) The hydrogenation barrier of H2COO* via “formate pathway”, (2) The binding energy of CO* on the surface of catalyst (3) The hydrogenation barrier of CO* via “carboxyl pathway”. Moreover, Nie et al. [149] designed Pd-Cu bimetallic system and investigated the reaction pathways of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. DFT results indicated that the surface of stepped PdCu(111) was most active than Cu-rich PdCu3(111) surface for CO2 and H2 activation, and then for CH3OH production, which possessed coordinatively unsaturated Pd atoms and was exposed on the top. The proposed preferable path over PdCu(111) for methanol synthesis from CO2 should be through CO2*→HCOO*→HCOOH*→ H2COOH*→CH2O*→CH3O*→CH3OH*, and they mentioned the rate-determining step was HCOO* hydrogenation to H2COO*. Interestingly, some investigations proved the water could enhance CH3OH formation from CO2 hydrogenation [150–152]. For example, Zhao et al. [152] proved COOH* can be formed via H transfer mechanism, where adsorbed H is migrated to H2O and then significantly decrease the hydrogenation barrier. Besides, the metal oxides, like ZnO–ZrO2, ZnAlOx, and In2O3–ZrO2 with abundant oxygen vacancies have already been proved to be effective for activation and hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH at 300–400 °C [153]. For instance, oxygen vacancy on In2O3 and ZnGa2O4 surfaces affected CO2 activation and product composition [154]. The different densities of oxygen vacancy can be tailored by adjusting the Zn/Ga ratio, and a Zn/Ga ratio of 1/2 in ZnGa2O4 showed the highest amount of oxygen vacancies. The formation rate of CH3OH and the productivity of C2–C4 olefins over Zn–Ga–O/SAPO-34 with the optimum Zn/Ga ratio reached to the maximum. Similar conclusions can also be found for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH over Cr2O3, ZnO–ZrO2, In2O3–ZrO2, etc. [155–158]."
14,C2+ alcohols production,"4.3 C2+ alcohols production Short introduction. C2+ alcohols are usually defined as alcohols possessing two or more carbon atoms, which can be the feedstock and intermediates and therefore attract considerable focus in the chemical and polymer industries. In the few decades, direct synthesis of C2+ alcohols from syngas hydrogenation is particularly appealing since feedstock can be obtained from coal/biomass gasification, PtG technology, and unconventional natural gas. Recently, C2+ alcohols production from direct CO2 conversion has been supposed to alleviate environmental issues [159]. However, the selectivity of C2+ alcohols is still a huge challenge from CO2 hydrogenation. For example, CH4, methanol, C2–C4, and C5+ are also produced during the C2+ alcohols synthesis, which obstructed the development and application of the technology. Catalysts. Mo-based, Rh-based, and modified F-T catalysts are the common catalysts for C2+ alcohols production, which possess the optimal absorption for CO, and CO2 adsorption and dissociation [160]. Luk et al. [161] prepared the carbonaceous materials supported Cu and Fe catalyst, and found the addition of K could promote Cu-Fe nanoparticles deposition on carbon nanofibers and then enhanced the catalyst selectivity and stability. Cu- and Fe-based catalysts with tailored metal particle sizes inhibited the formation of C1 compounds and CO2, and the selectivity of C2+ alcohols and hydrocarbons were reached 47% and 50%, respectively. Mo-based catalysts are also promising for C2+ alcohols production because of their lower cost compared with Pt-group metals. Park et al. [162] investigated the effect of K-promoted Mo2C on C2+ alcohols synthesis and proved that un-promoted Mo2C produced more C1–C5 alkanes in CO hydrogenation. After K2CO3 addition into Mo2C, the CO conversion and alcohol selectivity can reach 10.3% and 50.5% during CO hydrogenation. Apart from the addition of alkali to Mo2C, the addition of Fe, Co and Ni have also been reported to be active for C2+ alcohols production and improving the activity of the promoted system [163]. Shou and Davis [164] investigated the MgO support and Rb2CO3 promoter on the performance of Mo2C-based catalysts for C2+ alcohols synthesis. Rb2CO3 promoted 5 wt% Mo2C/MgO could obtain 61C% on CO2-free basis, the results by XAS indicated that passivated Mo2C/MgO was easily reduced than bulk Mo2C when exposure to reaction conditions for 4 h. The Rb K edge structure identified that the structure of Rb2CO3 promoter was modified and the Mo2C was highly dispersed on MgO. Direct CO2 conversion to C2+ higher alcohols needs the active sites to enhance CO production from RWGS and subsequently CO activation and non-dissociative CO activation to alcohol [165]. Consequently, CO2 hydrogenation route makes the C2+ alcohols production suffers from low selectivity towards C2+ alcohols. Noble metal-based catalysts possessed higher selectivity to ethanol than the transition metal-based catalyst, but the high cost inhibits the development. Caparrós et al. [166] proposed the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol over Pd single atoms anchored on the surface of Fe3O4 and reached 97.5% selectivity at 300 °C, even at atmospheric pressure. Through the comparison of various Pd/MO x catalysts, they found the metal-oxide interface plays a key role in the activity for C2+ higher alcohols production. Wang et al. [167] mentioned the coupling of appropriate C1 intermediates to form C2-oxygenates was the feasible method for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol. They found that Ni addition into the Co catalyst could facilitate the formation of *CH x intermediate, which was highly stable and selective during CO2 hydrogenation. Briefly, *CH x species inserted into the *HCOO to form C2-oxygenates intermediate from the in-situ DRIFTS. Afterward, the CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol over Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x catalyst reached to maximum yield of 15.8 mmol gcat –1 and selectivity of 85.7% at 200 °C. The flake-like morphology of Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x catalyst and CoNi (111) plane also provided a great platform for CO2 adsorption and reaction. Xu et al. [168] reported Cs modified Cu-Fe-Zn oxides could realize highly selective production for C2+ alcohols. As presented in Fig. 11 , the optimized Cs-Cu0.8Fe1.0Zn1.0 exhibited the highest C2+OH/ROH of 93.8% with a high C2+OH space–time of 73.4 mg gcat –1h−1. Especially, they claimed the C2+ alcohols production experienced surface CO* formations on Cu-ZnO dual sites and reacted with surface hydrocarbon on Cu-Fe7C3 dual sites. The excellent balance and synergy effect of dissociative and non-dissociative C–O bond activation led to the high activity of Cs-Cu0.8Fe1.0Zn1.0. Mechanisms. Normally, the mechanism of CO hydrogenation can be divided into four steps: CO activation, CH x formation, CO insertion, and subsequently hydrogenation to the ethanol. As with F-T synthesis, one is dissociation of adsorbed CO by direct or H assistant; another is generation of CHO/COH which is further hydrogenated and dissociated to CH x . After that, CO or CHO insert into CH x to form CH x CO/CH x CHO and finally obtain CH3CHOH. As shown in Fig. 12 a, carbide mechanisms involved the generation of CH x species and CxH2x+1 formation from chain growth, and chain termination until the formation of paraffins, olefins, and oxygenates, β-CH cleavage, and CO insertion, respectively. Other mechanisms, which involve CH2 insertion, are the coupling of RCH2 + CH2, RCH = CH2 + CH2, RCH + CH2. CO insertion mechanism follows the sequence of CO insert into alkyl species, C–O cleavage, and hydrocarbons formation. Here, hydrogenated intermediates like CHO are also proposed to be possible for insertion and producing alcohols. As depicted in Fig. 12 b, the controlled chain growth for hydrocarbons should be reached over tailored catalysts to produce C2+ alcohols. However, the catalyst structure, composition, promoters, and energy barriers of elementary steps, etc. also affect the mechanism for C2+ alcohols production. Recently, Li and Sholl [170] determined the elementary steps in a complex reaction over Mo2C. They considered H-assisted CO dissociation was more dominant than direct CO dissociation, which notably affected the product distribution like CO oxidation, C–C coupling, CH3 hydrogenation, and CO insertion. Also, Choi et al. [171] and Kapur et al. [172] investigated the CO hydrogenation into methane, methanol, and ethanol over Ru-based catalyst by using DFT calculation and microkinetic modeling. Choi et al. [171] found H-assisted CO dissociation was easier than direct CO dissociation on the Ru (111) surface because of a higher energy barrier, especially in CHO* formation. After that, CHO* was subsequently hydrogenated to CH3O*, C–O bond cleavage, CO insertion, and again hydrogenation to ethanol. Kapur et al. [172] conducted CO hydrogenation into alcohols on the surface of Rh (111) and Rh (211). They mentioned the CH2O* hydrogenation to CH2OH* was also kinetically possible on Rh (111), and H-assisted CO dissociation over Ru (211) was more feasible than the direct route. Furthermore, Wang et al. [173] also found that H-assisted CO adsorption was taken place on Rh(211) surface and CH3 was produced from CH2O* rather than CH3O*."
15,Other liquid fuels production,"4.4 Other liquid fuels production Short introduction. Apart from the methane, methanol, C2+ alcohols, syngas originated from nature gas reforming, coal/biomass gasification can be also used for the production of lower olefins, aromatics, and other liquid fuels [174]. Light olefins from syngas for plastics, medicines, and aromatics production have been also extensively applied in petrochemical industries. The hydrogenation of CO2 into C2+ hydrocarbons combining with the RWGS reaction and F-T synthesis to obtain olefins and paraffins are also proved to be promising for energy development. Catalysts. The main challenge of selective CO hydrogenation to light olefins is the controlling of C−C coupling and suppression of the hydrogenation of C–C and methane formation. In 1978, Dwyer et al. [175] found that the existence of CO2 affected F-T products distribution on Fe-based catalysts, but previously computational results already demonstrated that the kinetics of F-T synthesis is not comparable to RWGS [176]. Therefore, the Fe-based catalysts should be modified before being applied for CO/CO2 hydrogenation. Albrecht et al. [177] employed cellulose-template methods for dopant-free bulk Fe2O3 preparation and used it for CO2 hydrogenation. They observed the selectivity to C2–C4 hydrocarbons and CO2 conversions were 37% and 40% under optimized reaction conditions (15 bar, 350 °C, and H2/CO2 = 3/1). Ding et al. [178] synthesized a series of Fe-K/Al2O3 for activity and selectivity evaluation in CO2 hydrogenation. Evidently, they found the CO2 conversion and selectivity of C5+ hydrocarbons researched 54.4% and 31.1% when the point of zero charge at 8.0. Wei et al. [179] synthesized Na-modified Fe3O4 with various zeolites and examined its selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons during CO2 hydrogenation. The HZSM-5 with a 10-member ring showed higher C5-C11 selectivity and was in favor of oligomerization of olefins. HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 160) with a medium/strong acid site and special pore structure is excellent for C5–C11 hydrocarbon production. Importantly, the Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a chain growth (α) value of 0.70, higher than Na–Fe3O4 alone catalyst, which indicated long-chain hydrocarbons production was promoted over Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5 catalyst. Due to the oligomerization and aromatization reactions that occurred on the acid sites of the catalyst, the product distribution on Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5 catalyst deviated from the ASF distribution curve. Na–Fe3O4 without H-ZSM-5 mainly catalyzed the C2-C11 formation, especially for C3 products, and the products shifted to C5-C11 isoparaffins and aromatics after combination with H-ZSM-5. Especially, the selectivity of C5–C11 and CO2 conversion were 78% and 22% over Na-Fe3O4/H-ZSM-5(160) catalyst at 320 °C, 3.0 MPa, and H2/CO2 of 1. Additionally, the metal oxides and zeolites packed in dual-bed mode could enhance proximity and synergistic effect between two catalysts, and then provided the highest selectivity of lower olefins or aromatics production. Zhu et al. [180] prepared a bifunctional catalyst of MnO and SAPO-34 for light olefins production and demonstrated the critical role of oxygen vacancies on the surface of MnO, which enhanced the CO dissociation into surface carbonate and carbon species, and selectivity of light olefins up to 80%. Su et al. [181] reported a bifunctional catalyst consisting of ZnCrO x oxides and AlPO-18 zeolite and observed selectivity for C2-C4 olefins of 45.0% (86.7% in CO2-free) and CO conversion of 25.2% at 390 °C and 4 MPa. After reaction conditions optimization, the CO conversion could increase to 49.3%, and the CD3CN/CO-FTIR characterizations and DFT calculations proved that AlPO-18 zeolite possessed lower acid strength, and therefore resulted in a high olefin/paraffin ratio. Jiao et al. [82] developed a bifunctional catalyst, ZnCrO x /MSAPO achieved higher conversions (17% CO conversion and 80% selectivity of C2 =–C4 =, and 94% selectivity of C2–C4) and avoided deactivation in CO hydrogenation during 110 h TOS. Mechanisms. Some researchers mentioned CH3OH, dimethyl ether (DME) and ketene might be the key intermediates for syngas into lower olefins or aromatics in the presence of a bifunctional catalyst. Many investigations from in-situ DRIFTS identified CH3OH or DME and other adsorbed species such as CH3O* and HCOO* are important intermediates, with the help of DFT calculations. As presented in Fig. 13 a, Li et al. [157] proposed a mechanism for lower olefins formation and intermediates formation via CH3OH to olefins was carried out on oxygen vacancy of the catalyst surface. Furthermore, it was reported oxygen vacancy sites on In2O3 and ZnGa2O4 surfaces could activate CO2 through DFT calculations, produce CHOH, and further for lower olefins production over SAPO-34 (Fig. 13 c). As shown in Fig. 13 d, Bao and co-workers [82,185] found the CO can be activated to CO2 and adsorbed *C through a disproportionation (i.e., Bourdouard reaction) on metal surfaces. They mentioned H2 activation is not important due to adsorbed *C species could be directly hydrogenated to *CH2 species. After that, *CH2 species combined with CO to produce ketene as an intermediate, which can be subsequently diffused into the zeolite to produce lower olefins. Besides, several works also investigated the conversion of the reaction intermediate (CH3OH) on the surface of zeolites. Some workers considered that formed H2O during CO2 hydrogenation to aromatics could further affect the activity of methanol to aromatics over zeolites. In other words, the trace water in intermediates conversion (e.g., C2H4) over Cr2O3 was found to be selective in aromatic formation over HZSM-5, while a large amount of water will reduce the fraction of weak acid sites in HZSM-5 and then inhibited C2H4 adsorption on weak acid sites. Until now, kinetic investigations have not been reported for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins or aromatics. From the existed knowledge, the rate-determining step of CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins or aromatics over tailored catalysts should be the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Like methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation, CO2 conversion to lower olefins also increased with reaction temperature increase over the catalyst, but the side reaction (i.e., RWGS) was also stimulated at higher reaction temperatures. Considering the production of gasoline-range (C5-C11) hydrocarbons from syngas or CO2, Ru, Co, and metal carbide together with zeolites are the common catalyst composition in use. The reducibility, MSI, particle size, and detailed site of active metal on the support are the key impacts in catalyst preparation. Due to special properties of the zeolites, like topology, acidity, and mesoporosity, different zeolites (ZSM-5 and β-zeolite) support different F-T metals are fabricated for C5-C11 hydrocarbons production. Based on the investigations, the presence of mesoporosity has already been proved to be highly effective for suppressing lighter hydrocarbons formation and improving the C5–C11 selectivity during syngas/CO2 conversion. Usually, syngas can be activated and converted into hydrocarbon mixtures via F-T reaction, and then heavier hydrocarbons are cracked on the Brønsted acid sites of the zeolites through hydrocracking and isomerization. For instance, Cheng et al. [186] enhanced the density of Brønsted acid sites and observed an increase in the selectivity of C5–C11 hydrocarbons with respect to Ciso/Cn ratio. Weitkamp [184] observed the higher n-hexadecane (n-C16H34) conversion to C4–C12 hydrocarbons over the Co/meso-ZSM-5 when increasing the density of Brønsted acid sites, and they explained the pathway by carbocation intermediates and hydrocracking mechanism (Fig. 13 b)."
16,Existed challenges and cases in the integration of tar reforming and downstream technology,"Although the main catalysts and mechanisms for the hydrogenation of CO/CO2 to synthetic fuels were discussed above, the common impurities (e.g., CH4, light hydrocarbons, and a large volume of N2) that existed in the gas outlet of reforming setup should be considered. In general, the gas composition from the tar reforming might be fluctuate if the feedstock cannot be continuously fed in. Besides, the unstable activity of the catalysts in real tar reforming due to the deactivation may lead to a dynamic H2/CO/CO2 ratio when entering downstream technology. Therefore, in this section, we present the existed cases that have already addressed the mentioned issues for providing a stable product composition. Han et al. [187] simulated the methanation of biogas over Ni-Mg-Al catalyst and focused on the effect of N2, CH4, and O2 on the CO2 conversion. Firstly, they conducted the CO2 methanation under the same gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and different GHSVs to obtain the various N2 concentrations. As exhibited in Fig. 14 a, the presence of around 3.5%, 23.3%, 44.6%, and 65.9% of N2 in the reactant gas showed a slight decrease in CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity, which can attribute to the higher GHSV shortens the contact time between catalyst and reactant. By contrast, the CO2 conversions were 3% and 5% lower than that using 10% and 30% N2 as a dilution when CO2 methanation was performed at a fixed GHSV (i.e., 15000 h−1, H2/CO2 = 4). With the increasing of N2 concentration, they believed that the decreasing of reactant concentration resulted in less heat release and therefore decrease the reaction temperature. Afterward, the effect of CH4 concentrations (0, 50%, and 65%) for CO2 methanation was carried out, and the results are displayed in Fig. 14 b. The increased content of CH4 in the reactant gas led to a decrease in CO2 conversion, and this is well in consistent with the Le Chatelier principle. In addition, the existence of 4% O2 in the reactant gas on CO2 methanation was investigated, the CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity over the catalyst were decreased by 5% and 3%, respectively. Inconsistent with the typical CO2 methanation pathway, the required oxygen vacancy for CO2 dissociation over the catalyst support was inhibited, and therefore resulted in the deactivation of catalyst in CO2 methanation. During the methanol synthesis, Toyir et al. [188] investigated the effect of hydrocarbons (i.e., methane and ethane) on CO2 conversion over the Cu-Ga/ZnO and Cu-Zn-Ga/SiO2 catalysts, and 50 ppm of CH4 and 20 ppm of C2H6 were introduced to reactor at 250–270 °C. The methanol productivity over Cu-Zn-Ga/SiO2 showed a certain inhibition when hydrocarbons were decreased, and more by-products like methane and ethane were observed. Compared to the Cu-Zn-Ga/SiO2 catalyst, the deactivation profile was different and the negative effect of hydrocarbons in feed gas over Cu-Ga/ZnO on methanol production was relatively low. As can be seen from Fig. 14 c, the Cu-Ga/ZnO even exhibited higher activity than that under pure CO2/H2 for methanol production at low temperatures. At a high temperature, the performance of Cu-Ga/ZnO in methanol synthesis was low in the presence of methane and ethane, but the catalytic activity of it is quite stable during a long TOS. Although the produced water can be removed by water-trap during biomass tar reforming, the accumulated water cannot be ignored especially when reforming is performed on a large scale. Christensen et al. [189] developed a K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst and studied the influence of feed impurities on the production of higher alcohols. As displayed in Fig. 14 d, the declined production of hydrocarbons especially higher alcohols can be observed when the water was introduced to the feed mixture. Interestingly, the methanol productivity can be improved when a proper water fraction (4.7%, 9.9%, and 13.4%) was poured into the catalysis system. This phenomenon suggested that methanol might be the intermediates for higher alcohols, and the reason for decreased higher alcohols and more methanol remained. Moreover, the addition of water may produce more H2 to convert CO2 into methanol but minor contribution for obtaining higher alcohols. They compared the catalyst deactivation for the production of alcohols in the presence of H2S, NH3, and a combination of H2S and NH3, respectively. The results demonstrated that not only H2S, but the presence of NH3 can also affect the yield to higher alcohols over K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C catalyst and deactivate the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 14 e, the production rate of alcohol was decreased from 0.135 to 0.110 g/gcat/h and the production of ethanol and higher alcohols decreased by 23%. Fortunately, the activity of K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C deactivated by NH3 can be recovered in the continuous H2S-containing feed mixture. The presence of H2S in the feed mixture can affect the activity of K2CO3/Co/MoS2/C, and it modulates the inhibition of NH3 during the higher alcohols production. In summary, the presence of impurities does affect the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation reaction, but it is not fatal. Excellent catalysts can still show outstanding performance in the hydrogenation reaction. As mentioned above, although there are many difficulties in realizing the integration of tar reforming and downstream technology, an emerging investigation on this has already been launched. For instance, Zhang et al. [53] obtained a high-quality fuel gas like > 97% of CH4 and H2 in an integration system, which is consisted of a freefall gasifier and a moving bed reactor. Both tar reforming and methanation were catalyzed over the designed Ni/hematite, and then calcined limestone and quartz sand were used as CO2 capturer and diluting agents, respectively. The optimized conditions for reaching maximum tar conversion and methane conversion are 500 to 600 °C, S/B = 0.4, and Ni/hematite/calcined limestone/quartz sand = 20/60/20. Ren et al. [190] evaluated the integrated process of toluene reforming and methanation over Ni/biochar and commercial Ni/Al2O3, and successfully realized the high conversion of toluene and produced syngas. During the steam reforming of toluene, Ni/biochar catalyzed 90% of toluene conversion with a gas yield of 261.4 mmol/gtoluene and H2/CO ratio of 3.01, which identified the possibility of produced gas for methane production. However, the support destruction, exposure of metallic Ni in Ni/biochar by steam introduction was significantly influenced the catalyst stability in both toluene reforming and methanation, which exhibited certain activity loss after 50 h. In addition, the produced CO2, CH4, and other hydrocarbons from toluene reforming were not well removed, which therefore resulted in the insufficient methane selectivity during the methanation. They considered that system efficiency, purification of the produced gas, and more rigorous process evaluation are still required for integration of biomass tar reforming and other technology on a large scale. Holmgren et al. [191] made a comprehensive investigation in the synthesis chain of biomass gasification and methanol synthesis. They evaluated many impactors like the influences of moisture of biomass, the heat pump integration, the H2 addition on methanol yield, and the adding a process for methanol-to-olefins. The results revealed that drying of the biomass materials had a remarkable influence on the energy balance of the whole integration, and the cooling demand for the system increased by 60%. The compromise was always the main consideration for having a better production of methanol yield, electricity, etc. Besides, the direct addition of H2 to replace the WGS reaction could significantly enhance methanol production. Like we already stated, utilizing the PtG and water electrolysis to have additional CO and H2 should be promising for supplying the required chemical resource during the actual integration of biomass tar reforming and downstream hydrogenation. International Energy Agency reported the status of the integrated projects, and they highlighted the importance of sustainable fuels production from the integration of biomass gasification [192]."
17,Summary and perspectives,"Syngas production from biomass gasification is potential for methane, C2+ alcohols, and other value-added chemicals production via F–T synthesis or other catalytic routes. Nevertheless, the specific gas quality and feeding ratio require to be addressed before being used for integrating with the downstream technology. In this review, we reviewed the representative catalysts and the pathways for tar reforming, especially, we emphasized the application of economical char/char supported catalyst in tar elimination. Furthermore, integrated concept (excess reactant and energy supplement from PtG process), gas purification after gasification (i.e., removal of fly ash, NCSs, and SCSs), representative catalysts, and the reaction mechanisms in downstream technologies were discussed. Finally, the challenges in technology integration were discussed to give a deep understanding and alternative approaches for its optimization and development. Overall, the following recommendations should be adopted to advance chemicals production from the gasified products: 1. After optimization of operation parameters, economical catalysts should be developed and further used for commercial utilization. The char/char supported metal catalyst originated from the biomass or coal can be further investigated, which already showed certain activity with the special structures in biomass tar reforming. However, further modifications for the char-derived catalyst to enhance the specific surface area, oxygen defects, MSI, and acidity/basicity should be investigated to strengthen reforming activity. Fortunately, the metal and energy of deactivated char-derived catalyst can be recycled through combustion, and therefore is promising to advance its application on a large scale. Furthermore, as reported in existed literatures, the reforming of represented tar model compounds, toluene, naphthalene, etc. are the single first-order reaction and are therefore possible for kinetics analysis. In the future, the cracking of other tar model compounds and the mutual competition and synergy effects of the tar fraction should also be focused on to obtain the real pathway of biomass tar reforming. 2. The issues of gas cleaning and feeding adjusting must be addressed before syngas from biomass tar reforming are further applied to value-added chemicals production. The deactivation from carbon deposition, metal oxidation, catalyst sintering, etc. can be overcome by tuning catalyst structures like oxygen vacancy, MSI, bimetallic synergic effect during catalyst preparation. However, HCN, NOx, SOx emission from the NCSs and SCSs in biomass tar could lead to catalyst poisoning during downstream conversion. Although some catalysts like perovskite-derived catalysts modified by different promoters (Sr, Ce, etc.) showed certain H2S resistance, the long-term stability must be addressed to feed into downstream hydrogenation technology. Moreover, the tailored catalyst with the ability to process the unstable flow rate, space velocity and pressure from the varied biomass feeding in industrial utilization should be considered in the development of gasification technology. 3. Although the composition of syngas from biomass tar reforming can be highly tailored by PtG technology, pressure supply and byproducts removal are still urgent issues that should be overcome. In comparison with CO adsorption over the metallic surface (in CO methanation), the basic site and oxygen vacancy of the support structure are crucial to dissociated CO2 and subsequent hydrogenation to methane. In addition to traditional metal oxides, hydrotalcite-derived catalysts with the tailored morphology and optimized basicity become hot materials due to the possibility of hosting a higher metal amount without losing the high particle dispersion. Recently, CO2 to methanol has gradually attracted many researchers because of the better effects on the environment and energy consumption. During the CO2 hydrogenation, the methanol production is hindered by the by-products CO produced from WGS and RWGS reactions. Moreover, H2O formation from methanol to lower olefins and methanol to aromatics over optimal support and then transferred to the active metal site for WGS should be considered. For C2+ alcohols preparation, syngas activation and C−C coupling are the challenges for C2+ alcohols synthesis from CO hydrogenation, and the formation rate of CO from RWGS reaction is the key step for CO2 hydrogenation into C2+ higher alcohols. Design the catalyst with bifunctional active sites at an atomic scale, like Co-Fe, Li-Rh, and Ni-Ga to incorporate the other function (carbon chain propagation for methanol synthesis catalysts and alcohol formation function for F-T catalysts) could be new catalytic systems for C2+ alcohols synthesis. In addition, the rational strategy and DFT model for active site design on CO production or activation and C−C coupling might be a new avenue to break the limit of Anderson−Schulz−Flory distribution in the hydrogenation of CO/CO2. Moreover, advanced in-situ characterization and even directly perform operando reactions in instruments should be not only for determining active sites but also to be the basis for obtaining structure–activity correlations for rational catalyst design. At last, we believe that an improved synthesis protocol to design the economical non-noble catalysts for tar reforming and downstream technologies can be realized by using in-depth mechanistic investigations and adequate characterizations. In addition to rational catalyst design, the integrated process could be improved from the engineering perspective. Many works have studied the catalyst activity in the separate reactors and the materials for CO2 adsorption and contaminants removal, but the processing efficiency and energy loss should be calculated to evaluate the industrialized value of the integrated technology."
