0,Introduction,"Rice is the third-largest agricultural product globally, with an annual output of approximately 740 million tons [1]. Because it generates a large quantity of agricultural waste, rice husk is a potential renewable feedstock for bio-oil production. Bio-oil is the main product obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass and has been proposed as a potential renewable substitute to alleviate the current energy dependence on fossil fuels. However, bio-oil has undesirable properties that prevent it from being used as a transportation fuel, including high viscosity, low chemical stability, low heating value, and high corrosiveness. In this scenario, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) emerges as an alternative to increase the quality of bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. Usually, CFP is carried out in an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, helium, or argon. A critical limitation of this traditional thermal cracking method is the accumulation of coke inside the catalyst pores, which causes pore plugging and decreases the catalytic activity [2]. Another disadvantage of CFP is low carbon efficiency as a large amount of carbon initially present in the biomass ends up in the coke, char, and carbon-containing gases, resulting in a liquid phase product with a relatively low hydrocarbon content [3,4]. To solve the problems with CFP mentioned above, hydrogen is introduced as a reactant into the catalytic system in a method known as catalytic hydropyrolysis (CHP). CHP of biomass is a potential method for producing renewable liquid fuels with high aromatic hydrocarbon yields, low oxygen content, and low carbon footprint [5,6]. Aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, are the primary organic raw materials in petrochemical, agriculture, medicine, dyes, and other industries. They are mainly used in the production of nylon, polyurethane, resin, and other synthetic materials. At present, the large-scale production of aromatics is achieved through the thermal fractionation of crude oil and coal [7]. However, the negative environmental implications associated with crude oil usage have led to the need for renewable feedstocks that are widely available. Large amounts of rice husk are disposed off as agricultural waste, and only a small part is re-used – for instance, to raise poultry. In this scenario, rice husk becomes a promising feedstock for aromatic hydrocarbon production via CHP [8]. The presence of a catalyst in the hydropyrolysis of biomass is vital to increase the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil [9] and reduce the extent of polymerization/condensation reactions, leading to undesirable polyaromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., coke precursors). Gamliel et al. found that catalyst acidity is essential for oxygen removal from hydropyrolysis vapors [10]. However, the authors highlight that excess acid sites promote undesirable polymerization reactions, increasing char and coke formation [10]. It has also been shown that hydrogen prevents the formation of coke, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Catalysts used in CHP studies are usually metals (e.g., Ni, Mo, Fe, Re, and Rh) supported on oxides (e.g., Al2O3 and ZrO2) [5,11] or aluminosilicates (e.g., HZSM-5, MCM-41, and H-Beta) [1,3]. According to literature reports, metal-based catalysts help increase the content of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil and minimize the extent of coke and char formation in the CHP of biomass. Sirous-Rezaei and Park studied the CHP of lignin over Fe/H-Beta, FeReOx/MCM-41, Fe/ZrO2, and FeReOx/ZrO2 at 350 °C and 1 bar. The results show that CHP reduced char formation from 43.2 to 32.6 wt% and increased the conversion of oligomeric phenolics into monomeric phenolics from 3.7 to 12.3 wt% relative to CFP [12]. He et al. compared CHP to fast pyrolysis (Py) and concluded that the presence of hydrogen promotes hydrodeoxygenation and deoxygenation reactions, with the highest hydrocarbon selectivity of 49.1 % for the CHP of poplar sawdust over an Rh/ZrO2 catalyst. This process was considered to have the best potential for low-oxygen biofuel production [12]. Meesuk et al. studied the CHP of rice husk using a nickel-loaded brown coal char and reported a relative hydrocarbons content of 19.7 % [14]. Stummann et al. studied the CHP of beech wood over a NiMo catalyst and showed that a hydrogen pressure of 15.9 bar or higher led to an essentially oxygen-free condensed organic phase. They found that coking decreased with hydrogen pressures for pressures up to 19 bar [15]. They also compared six different bed materials during the catalytic hydropyrolysis of beech wood in a hydropyrolysis system composed of a fluidized-bed reactor followed by a hydrodeoxygenation reactor with a sulfide NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The authors found that bog iron was a cheap catalyst with suitable activity in the fluid bed reactor [16]. Chandler et al. found a potential route involving methane oligomerization into aromatics followed by hydrogenation of the resulting aromatics into cycloalkanes during the hydropyrolysis of Arundo donax in a fluidized-bed reactor with a NiMo-HZSM-5 catalyst. They reported that at 400 °C, 68 % (on a carbon basis) of the methane was converted into higher alkenes [17]. It is important to highlight that some of the metals proposed for the CHP of biomass are the most expensive components of the catalyst. The present work is part of a broader research study to develop an economic solid-based catalyst composed of an inorganic oxide framework without any active metals for the CHP of biomass. One of the challenges (common to metallic and non-metallic catalysts) is the coking issue reported in previous studies with zeolite catalysts [12]. To address this, we modified the pore structure of the HZSM-5, which primarily contains micropores, by introducing mesoporosity features. Micropores limit the diffusion and mass transfer rates of large molecules. Eschenbacher et al. reported that the deoxygenation of straw fast pyrolysis vapors with a mesoporous HZSM-5 led to higher conversion of oxygenates and higher resistance to deactivation by coke relative to the pristine HZSM-5 catalyst [18]. If the HZSM-5 pores are inaccessible to pyrolysis vapors, they will aggregate on the external surface of HZSM-5 and eventually form coke, which significantly reduces the catalyst lifetime. To avoid this process, we developed alkali-treated HZSM-5 and hierarchical micro-mesoporous catalysts in our previous work [19–21] to improve the selectivity to hydrocarbons and enhance the catalyst activity for CFP of rice husk. The special channel structure of the hierarchical catalyst is formed by an HZSM-5 core and an MCM-41 shell. We demonstrated that the hierarchical catalyst reduced coke build-up during the CHP of rice husk. However, the use of this innovative catalyst structure for hydropyrolysis has not yet been reported. The present work aims to apply the hierarchical micro-mesoporous catalyst for the CHP of rice husk. The hierarchical micro-mesoporous catalyst reduced coking owing to the presence of mesoporous MCM-41, which is less acidic than HZSM-5 and thus in its own cokes to a lesser extent. We hypothesize that, in the presence of hydrogen, the hierarchical catalyst enables hydrogenation of oxygenates formed during the pyrolysis process, decreasing the extent of polymerization reactions [22]. To support this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of hydrogen pressure on the product distribution from CHP. The process reported in the present work aims to increase the content of hydrocarbons in both gas and liquid phases from the CHP of rice husk. We compared the product distributions from CFP and CHP over pristine HZSM-5, alkali-treated HZMS-5, and hierarchical micro-mesoporous catalyst prepared via alkaline treatment with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time alkali-treated and hierarchical catalysts have been used for the CHP of lignocellulosic biomass. We evaluated the effects of pressure on product selectivity from 1 to 35 bar and the effect of temperature from 300 to 400 °C."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Rice husk (420 µm) (obtained from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China) was dried at 105 °C for 12 h and placed in zipper storage bags. Table 1 shows the ultimate analysis results (dry ash basis), proximate analysis (dry basis), and ash composition of the rice husk used in the present study. TPAOH and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99 % purity) were purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Alumina sand (250 µm, 99.9 % purity) used for fluidization was obtained from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd."
3,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterization The catalyst preparation has been reported in our previous work [23]. First, the HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 27, obtained from the Catalyst Plant of Nankai University) samples were pretreated with a 2.0 mol/L solution of TPAOH to create internal mesoporous features prior to the production of the hierarchical catalyst. TPAOH-treated samples were denoted HM-2.0. After pre-treatment with TPAOH, we calcined the HZSM-5 zeolite samples at 550 °C for 5 h. This step resulted in a solution consisting of aluminosilicate fragments. Then, 125 mL of a 10 wt% CTAB (the template for producing MCM-41) solution was added to the solution containing aluminosilicate fragments and stirred for 60 min at room temperature. The obtained solution was loaded into a high-pressure autoclave equipped with a poly tetra fluoroethylene (PTFE) lining and digested at 110 °C for 24 h. The samples were cooled down to 25 °C, and the pH adjusted to 8.5. After pH adjustment, we recrystallized the samples at high-pressure at 110 °C for 24 h. Finally, the solution was filtered, washed, and dried in air at 550 °C for 6 h to obtain the hierarchical catalyst denoted as HM-2.0 T. All catalysts were sieved to ensure that the particle diameter was in the range of 300–400 µm. The characterization of HT-2.0 and HM-2.0 T were published in our previous works [23,24]. We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) with 20 mg sample (∼48 µm) in a Bruker D8 Advance. The equipment used Cu Kα radiation to provide 3 kW of output power. The data was recorded within a range of 2θ from 5° to 90°. Nitrogen sorption was performed in a V-Sorb X800 produced by Goldapp, China. The surface properties of the sample are closely related to the pretreatment conditions. The pretreatment process is divided into two stages: the first stage is vacuum degassing the catalyst at 200 °C for 60 min, and the second stage is vacuum degassing the catalyst at 250 °C for 240 min. The pretreated sample was placed in 77 K liquid nitrogen for N2 adsorption and desorption experiments. We used the BET equation for the analysis of the overall surface area of the catalysts. We acquired the pore size distribution of the mesoporous structure of the catalyst using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and used the Satio-Foley (SF) method for the microporous structure."
4,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.3 Experimental apparatus and procedure CFP and CHP experiments were conducted in a fluidized-bed system (shown in Fig. 1 ). Before every experiment, 120 g of rice husk were placed in the hopper (2), and 50 g of the catalyst with 150 g of alumina sand were placed inside the fluidized reactor (catalyst-to-alumina ratio = 1:3) (7). As a comparative experiment, we conducted one CHP experiment with a high biomass-to-catalyst ratio (the ratio is 50 and catalyst mass is 2.4 g) and another experiment with no catalyst. The carrier gas was preheated to 280 °C by a preheater (5) before entering the reactor. In addition, the flow rate of the carrier gas was 100 L/h. After the reactor temperature reached the setpoint, we started feeding rice husk into the reactor. The feeding system included a screw feeder with an auger (4) that carried the rice husk from the hopper to the funnel (3), where the feedstock was pneumatically forced into the reactor. For every run, the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was kept at 1.1 h−1. The products flowed from the reactor to the cyclone (8) via a transfer line, which separated the char from the gas stream. The temperature of the cyclone was kept at 275–300 °C throughout the experiment. The vapors were sent to the condensing system, which included two double-pipe condensers (9) and one impinger (11) with dry ice and collectors (10). Finally, the permanent gases went through a coalescing filter and were recycled through the system via a gas booster (STA, Shineeast Co. Ltd) (13). Gas was collected in gas sampling bags (12) at the end of the run for analysis. Each experiment was repeated at least three times under the same conditions in order to generate average values and standard deviations in this study."
5,Pyrolysis products analysis and data processing,"2.4 Pyrolysis products analysis and data processing Liquid products were collected and weighed in the collectors and analyzed by GC–MS/FID (Agilent Technologies, USA). The peaks were identified with reference to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) MS library database and other literature [25–27]. In this work, the liquid fraction weight was accounted for by weighing all components before and after the reaction, including condensers and collectors. The solids collected in the cyclone, transfer line, and reactor were only characterized gravimetrically to calculate the solid yield as presented in Equation (1) (main manuscript) – no chemical characterization was performed for the solids. The coke yield was calculated by subtracting the mass of the spent and fresh catalyst. The spent catalyst was separated from the char and sand by sieving. The method was possible because the coked catalyst (>400 µm) had a larger diameter than the sand (250 µm) and the char particles (<250 µm). The relative content of each aromatic hydrocarbon in the liquid was determined based on the percentage from GC–MS/FID data. Yields of solid, liquid, and gas were calculated according to the following expressions: (1) Solid yield = wt . of solid / wt . total feed × 100 % (2) Liquid yield = wt . of liquid / wt . total feed × 100 % (3) Gas yield = 100 % - Solid yield - - Liquid yield The relative content of compounds in the liquid product was determined according to the equation [28–30]: (4) R content = P 1 P total where Pi is the peak area of a specifically identified product, and Ptotal is the total peak area under a certain condition. Next, the coked catalyst was dried at 120 °C for 4 h and then placed in the muffle oven, where the coke was combusted at 650 °C for 2 h. The coke yield was calculated as the difference in catalyst mass before and after the combustion process, according to the following equation: (5) Y coke = m u - m b m u × 100 where mμ is the mass of the coked catalyst after drying, and mb is the mass of the catalyst after combustion. Gas samples were analyzed by GC/TCD-FID (Agilent Technologies, USA). The relative amount (FID area-%) of each component in the gas, including CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8, was estimated as the peak area of a given component divided by the sum of peak areas of all components in the gas. The yield of an individual component in the gas was calculated according to the following equation: (6) G s = G 1 G total × G yield × 100 % where Gi is the peak area of a specific component in gas, Gtotal is the sum of peak areas of all components in the gas, and Gyield is the total gas yield calculated according to Equation (3)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Comparison between CFP and CHP of rice husk,"3.1 Comparison between CFP and CHP of rice husk To evaluate the effect of hydrogen on the pyrolysis of rice husk, we explored the differences between CHP (hydrogen medium) and CFP (helium medium) under the same conditions (400 °C, 35 bar with a hierarchical catalyst). As Fig. 2 a shows, the coke yield decreased from 4.2 to 1.9 wt% with a change from helium to hydrogen atmosphere, indicating that hydrogen gas reduces the extent of coke build-up on the catalyst. Other literature work has reported drops in coke build-up on the catalyst due to the hydrogen atmosphere – 10.5 to 7.8 wt% from the comparison between CFP and CHP of biomass [31]. The decrease in coke yield is accompanied by an increase in gas yields from 25.2 to 28.8 wt%, suggesting that coke is removed from the catalyst surface via hydrogasification. While there is little difference in liquid yield after switching from helium to hydrogen, major differences are observed within the composition of the liquid products, as shown in Fig. 2b. The relative content of hydrocarbons in the liquid for the CHP of rice husk is 48.9 %, higher than that obtained during the CFP (33.0 %) process. Stummann et al. reported that high-pressure hydrogen decreases the oxygen and increases the carbon content in the organic phase relative to thermal decomposition in the presence of nitrogen, favoring the formation of liquid hydrocarbons [15]. In addition, in a hydrogen-deficient environment, monoaromatic compounds alkylate and oligomerize over the acid sites of the catalyst to form naphthalene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which further polymerize to form coke [32]. Wang et al. studied the CHP of loblolly pine sawdust in a fluidized-bed reactor. The authors reported producing a bio-crude product with low oxygen content and up to 45 wt% carbon – mostly C4 + hydrocarbon products [33]. Our results suggest that pressurized hydrogen promotes effective cleavage of oxygenated bonds present in heavy organic vapors from the primary pyrolysis. In addition, hydrogen can generate radicals that cap reactive volatiles and stabilize oxygenated vapors. Phenol, also shown in Fig. 2b, is considered an intermediate pyrolysis deoxygenation product [34]. Our results indicate that the relative content of phenol decreases from 13.9 % to 11.4 % with the addition of hydrogen. In addition, the relative content of several products decreases in the presence of hydrogen: acids (from 8.2 % to 3.9 %), ketones (from 10.7 % to 6.6 %), alcohols (from 5.5 % to 4.2 %), esters (from 7.7 % to 6.4 %), aldehydes (from 9.2 % to 8.6 %) and others pyrolysis products (from 7.6 % to 6.1 %). The relative content of total oxygenates in the liquid product from CHP is 47.2 %, lower than that from CFP, 62.8 %. Fig. 2c shows that the yields of C2–C3 alkenes increase from 5.4 wt% to 6.4 wt%, and the yield of CH4 increases from 12.5 wt% to 14.2 wt% with the change from helium to hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen is beneficial to maintain the activity of the catalyst so that macromolecular alkanes/alkenes are broken into small molecular gaseous alkanes/alkenes [35]. In addition, oxygen-containing compounds with a benzene ring will be catalytically cracked to form CH4 in a hydrogen atmosphere, which promotes the increase of CH4 content [36]. While both CFP and CHP produce many substantial amount of gaseous products (mostly CH4 and C2–C3), CHP yields a much higher hydrocarbon fraction in the liquid product than CFP. These results show that hydrogen effectively removes oxygen from primary pyrolysis vapors, thus leading to a higher-quality liquid product relative to the pyrolysis process in an inert atmosphere (i.e., helium)."
8,Effect of the catalyst on CHP of rice husk,"3.2 Effect of the catalyst on CHP of rice husk Fig. 3 a shows the product yields from CHP of rice husk over three catalysts: pristine HZSM-5, alkali-treated HZSM-5 (HT-2.0), and hierarchical micro-mesoporous composite catalyst (HM-2.0 T). The liquid yield remained almost unchanged at approximately 40 wt%; independent of the catalyst used. However, the composition of the liquid product varied greatly among the series of catalysts. In order to evaluate whether the alumina sand bed material has an effect on the CHP process, we conducted the hydropyrolysis of rice husk with no catalyst. The gas, solid, and liquid yields are 20.4 wt%, 48.6 wt% and 31 wt%, respectively, a trend similar to the one reported by Meesuk et al. Study [37]. In Fig. 3b, the relative content of hydrocarbons from CHP of rice husk over the hierarchical catalyst (HM-2.0 T) is 48.9 %, higher than the value obtained with the alkali-treated HZSM-5 (36.8 %), with the pristine HZSM-5 (28.6 %) and with no catalyst (4.2 %). Moreover, the relative content of oxygenates from CHP over HZSM-5 is 67.1 % higher than that from alkali-treated HZSM-5 (58.6 %) and hierarchical catalyst (47.2 %). The hierarchical catalyst shows excellent deoxygenation capability. Compared with the catalyst effect on the formation of hydrocarbons, the alumina sand has negligible activity, a result previously reported by Chandler et al. [38]. The results obtained for the different catalysts indicate that the hierarchical catalyst (HM-2.0 T) shows excellent selectivity for liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons (Fig. 3b and c). As shown in Fig. 3a, the increase in the relative content of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons is accompanied by a significant drop in coke yields – the pristine and alkali-treated HZSM-5 catalysts led to coke yields of 9.6 and 6.5 wt%, respectively, while the hierarchical catalyst led to a coke yield of only 1.9 wt%. In addition, CHP with a higher biomass-to-hierarchical catalyst ratio (B:C = 50) was conducted. The results indicate the relative content of oxygenates is 82 %, higher than that from the low B:C ratio. However, the coke yield is 3.9 wt%, lower than HZSM-5 (9.6 %) and HT-2.0 (6.5 %). This result suggests that the amount of hierarchical catalyst in the CHP processing is too small, with little chance for the volatiles to interact with the active sites on the catalyst. We attribute the high selectivity of the hierarchical catalyst for liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons to (1) the ability of this catalyst to promote initial cracking of macromolecules on the MCM-41 outer layer and (2) the high diffusivity of these molecules in the MCM-41-type channels. It is important to add that the TPAOH treatment reduces the concentration of acid sites on the outer surface of the HZSM-5, as demonstrated in our previous publication via NH3-TPD [23]. This treatment minimizes coking by inhibiting the accumulation of strongly adsorbed species on acid sites close to the pore mouth; thus, improving the accessibility of molecules to Brønsted sites present on the catalyst’s inner structure – the HZSM-5 core [39]. Fig. 3b also shows that the hierarchical catalyst led to a lower content of oxygenated species, including acids, ketones, alcohols, phenols, esters, and aldehydes relative to both pristine and alkali-treated HZSM-5. Perkins et al. reported that the relative content of hydrocarbons from CHP of rice husk over dolomite and CoMo/Al2O3 were 8.5 % and 27.4 % [40]. These values are lower than the ones reported in the present work. It is important to emphasize that the hierarchical catalyst used in the present work displays excellent catalytic activity and shows improved coking resistance in the presence of hydrogen. Fig. 3a shows a 4.6 wt% increase in gas yields resulting from introducing mesoporous features to the pristine HZSM-5 catalyst (HT-2.0) with a further increase in gas yields after introducing the MCM-41-like outer layer (HM-2.0 T). Fig. 3c shows that the increase in gas yield is mainly driven by a substantial increase in the relative content of methane, especially after the introduction of the MCM-41 outer layer. The selectivities for CH4 obtained in the present work are significantly higher than those obtained by Chandler et al. with the pristine HZMS-5 under similar conditions. One of the reasons for the higher CH4 yield obtained in our work could be the biomass type – rice husk has a higher C/H ratio than Arundo donax – which may lead to products that contain a higher C/H ratio. Also, the biomass-to-alumina ratio (4:5) used in the present work is lower than the ratio used in Chandler’s et al. work (biomass-to-alumina ratio = 1:1); more alumina contributes to a better heat transfer. The particle size of the catalysts used in the present work, 300–400 µm, is larger than the particle size used in the Chandler et al. work, 2–3 mm – small catalyst particles provide more external surface area for secondary reactions [38]. Fig. 4 a shows the XRD results of the HZSM-5, alkali-treated HZSM-5(HT-2.0), and hierarchical catalyst (HM-2.0 T) catalysts after CHP. The characteristic peaks of spent catalysts do not show obvious changes compared to the original catalysts published in our previous works [23–24]. These results indicate that the crystallographic features of the catalysts did not change significantly after CHP. The N2 sorption isotherms for the HZSM-5, HT-2.0, and HM-2.0 T after CHP are shown in Fig. 4b. The spent alkali-treated and hierarchical catalysts display type IV isotherms with the characteristic hysteresis loop, which suggests the presence of mesoporous structures. On the other hand, the HZSM-5 exhibits type I isotherms, characteristic of microporous materials. After CHP processing, the hysteresis loop has not shown significant differences relative to the pristine catalysts (results published in our previous work [23–24]. These results provide some indications that the effect of coke build-up on pore size distribution under hydrogen atmosphere is negligible. Table 2 shows the surface area, pore volume, and pore size of the different catalysts after the reaction. Compared with the original catalysts [23–24], the surface area, pore volume, and pore size of HM-2.0 T have a less change after reaction, indicating a low extent of coke build-up under hydrogen atmosphere. The porosimetry properties of the spent catalysts shown in Table 2 are consistent with the coke yields reported in Fig. 3a. While the analysis of the liquid fraction indicates that the hierarchical catalyst has the highest deoxygenation and cracking capability among the catalysts tested in the present work, the yields of CO and CO2 are lower than those obtained with the pristine and alkali-treated catalysts. It is important to note CO and CO2 may react with H2 to form methane and water, according to Equations (7) and (8). (7) CO + 3 H 2 ⇌ CH 4 + H 2 O (8) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ⇌ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O The consumption of COx in methanation reactions could provide a potential route for methane production, explaining the high selectivity for methane shown in Fig. 3c. In addition to methanation reactions, there may also be two other routes by which methane is formed: (1) hydrodeoxygenation of volatile oxygenated substances, resulting in aromatic compounds as intermediates, which undergo saturation reactions to generate alkanes [36] and (2) cracking of higher alkanes into methane [41]."
9,Effect of pressure on CHP of rice husk,"3.3 Effect of pressure on CHP of rice husk We investigated the effects of pressure (1 bar, 10 bar, and 35 bar) on the CHP of rice husk over the hierarchical catalyst (HM-2.0 T). Fig. 5 a shows the effect of the pressure on the yields of liquid, gas, char, and coke in the 1–35 bar pressure range. The gas yield decreases from 34.6 wt% to 28.8 wt% as the pressure increases from 1 to 35 bar. On the other hand, char yields increase from 25.3 wt% to 28.6 wt% with pressure. Coke formation decreases with pressure, likely due to an increase in the rates of hydrodeoxygenation reaction with hydrogen pressure. In addition, CH4 and C2–C3 are formed by the hydrocracking of coke. Fig. 5b shows that, as the pressure increases from 1 to 35 bar, the relative content of phenols decreases from 14.9 to 11.1 %, acids decreases from 7.6 to 3.9 %, and aldehydes decreases from 10.5 to 8.6 %. In general, the relative contents of the oxygenates are 47.2 %, 51.4 %, and 54.9 % from CHP of RH over the hierarchical catalyst at 1, 10, and 35 bar, respectively. It is worth mentioning that phenols can undergo hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, followed by subsequent dehydration and removal of the alcohol group, especially at high pressure [42]. The relative content of hydrocarbons increases from 39.9 % to 48.9 % with increasing pressure (see Fig. 5b), which indicates that the hydrodeoxygenation activity increases with pressure. In addition, it has been reported that components of the hydrocarbon pool can react to form alkylated or oligomeric products when the environment is sufficiently rich in hydrogen at high pressure [43]. The yield of gas decreases from 34.6 wt% to 28.8 wt% with increasing pressure. The relative content of the gaseous products shown in Fig. 5c indicates that CH4 and C2–C3 yields increase with increasing pressure from 10.3 wt% and 5.1 % to 14.2 % and 6.7 %, respectively. The yield of CO decreases from 10.4 wt% to 3.7 wt% with increasing pressure. In addition, CO2 yields decrease from 8.8 wt% to 4.2 wt% with pressure (see in Fig. 5c). The results are like those reported by Stummann et al., who pointed out that the CO and CO2 contents decrease with pressure due to the high hydrodeoxygenation activity at high hydrogen partial pressure. According to Stummann et al., hydrodeoxygenation competes with decarbonylation and decarboxylation [15]. In addition, coke yields decreased from 3.4 wt% to 1.9 wt%. It has been suggested that high hydrogen pressure promotes dehydration of intermediate oxygenates to form water, which becomes the dominant deoxygenation pathway to hydrocarbon formation, slightly aiding coke reduction [43]."
10,Effect of temperature in CHP of rice husk,"3.4 Effect of temperature in CHP of rice husk Fig. 6 a shows the yields of gas, liquid, char, and coke for CHP at 300, 350, and 400 °C and 35 bar with the hierarchical catalyst (HM-2.0 T). Increasing the temperature from 300 to 400 °C leads to decreased char and coke yields from 32.6 wt% to 28.6 wt% and from 3.1 wt% to 1.9 wt%, respectively. In contrast, the gas yield increased from 24.9 wt% to 28.8 wt% with temperature (in the same temperature range, 300 to 400 °C). This result is consistent with an increase in the rates of cracking of coke and large aromatic intermediates with temperature [44], leading to high selectivities to methane and light alkenes. Cracking reactions consume large aromatic molecules, reducing the rate of recombination reactions. In addition, condensation/polymerization reactions release energy (exothermic) [45]. Therefore, we expect those reactions to be thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures, agreeing with the results shown in Fig. 6a. The increase in temperature from 300 to 400 °C led to a significant increase in the relative content of hydrocarbons from 38.2 % to 48.9 % and a corresponding decrease in the relative content of oxygenates from 56.6 % to 47.2 %, as shown in Fig. 6b. This trend is similar to the one reported by Meesuk, which reports hydrocarbons contents increasing from 1.8 % to 14.3 % [14]. Most of the gas product is composed of CH4 and C2–C3 alkenes. The yields of CH4 and C2–C3 increase with temperature to the highest value of 14.2 wt% and 6.7 wt%, respectively, at 400 °C (Fig. 6c). This result supports the hypothesis that hydrocracking rates increase with reaction temperature, converting large molecules into smaller ones. It is also important to note that the increase in temperature from 300 to 400 °C increased deoxygenation rates via decarboxylation and decarbonylation, as evidenced by the decrease in yields of oxygenates and increase in yields of CO2 and CO at 400 °C. The liquid yield remains essentially unchanged with temperature at about 40 wt% (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b shows that the relative content of acids and alcohols decreases with temperature from 6.9 % and 5.9 % to 3.9 % and 4.2 %, respectively. The ester and phenol contents remained essentially unchanged. The relative content of ketones goes through a maximum (9.0 %) at 350 °C, and the aldehyde relative content displays an initial increase from 7.2 to 8.4 % (temperature from 300 to 350 °C) reaching a constant value of 8.4 %. At 300 °C, the reduction in catalytic activity led to lower deoxygenation rates than at 350 and 400 °C. The low relative content of oxygenates in the liquid is due to catalytic deoxygenation reactions (decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and dehydration) with the possible occurrence of hydrodeoxygenation reactions. Overall, the presence of hydrogen is conducive to the breakage of the bonds of biomass macromolecules and aids the removal of oxygen heteroatoms, which facilitates the formation of hydrocarbons [46]."
11,Hydropyrolysis overview and lumped reaction pathway,"3.5 Hydropyrolysis overview and lumped reaction pathway The various stages of hydrocarbon production from pyrolysis of rice husk are illustrated in the Van Krevelen diagram shown in Fig. 7 . The diagram shows the relationship between the hydrogen-to-carbon (H:C) ratio and oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio for the original rice husk and the products of thermal conversion. The original biomass is rich in oxygen, a small fraction of which is removed as water during fast pyrolysis (FP), along with CO and CO2 [47], producing bio-oil. The bio-oil upgrading involves adding a catalyst in an inert atmosphere to form a more stable mixture of aromatics and reduce oxygenates in the liquid [36]. However, because there is no hydrogen supply for CFP, even the most deoxygenated upgraded bio-oil has an atomic H:C ratio of approximately 1.0, which is close to the ratio observed in coal. CHP is performed to further enhance the quality of the upgraded bio-oil by increasing the content of hydrocarbons. Removal of oxygen heteroatoms in CHP increases the atomic H:C ratio to 1.75 and increases the high heating value (HHV) of the liquid [36]. In addition, the hydrocarbon content in the gaseous products is also high due to the formation of alkenes and alkanes. Therefore, CHP is an effective alternative to remove undesirable oxygenated species from bio-oil and gaseous products. Nonetheless, hydrogen consumption might impose economical limitations to this technology. Options for hydrogen generation include recycling of the hydrogen feed [44]. Li et al. used electrocatalytic methods to make hydrogen employing mild conditions (≤80 °C and ambient pressure) [46]. Another way would be steam reforming light alkanes formed during pyrolysis – along with recycled hydrogen. In the future, solar energy may provide a route for hydrogen generation at a much lower cost relative to current traditional technologies. Nevertheless, hydrogen consumption should be minimized during CHP, based on the balance between the cost of hydrogen and the economic and environmental benefits of the product. Along these lines, it is imperative to ensure that the hydropyrolysis process transfers the maximum amount of hydrogen atoms from the hydrogen gas feed into the liquid product. One variable that can express this transfer is the relative content of hydrocarbons in the liquid product. The present work contributes to the improved use of the hydrogen gas resource by increasing the relative content of hydrocarbons via the use of the hierarchical catalyst under a series of conditions. The lumped reaction pathway that transfers hydrogen atoms from the gas feed to the liquid product is shown in Fig. 8 . Under pyrolysis conditions, rice husk breaks into oxygenated volatiles. Some of the volatile species crack to form permanent gases and water. Both cracking and hydrocracking reactions occurs in catalytic hydropyrolysis, and these reactions are desirable to the extent where they decrease the molecular size to that of diesel; however, cracking and hydrocracking also leads to an increased yield of light gases, which decreases the hydrocarbons in the condensed organic phase [35]. Methanation reactions are favorable in the presence of hydrogen; thus, improving CH4 yields. Two other possible mechanisms for CH4 formation include: (1) hydrodeoxygenation of oxygenated volatiles, resulting in aromatic compounds as intermediates, which undergo saturation reactions to generate alkanes [36], and (2) cracking of higher alkanes into methane [41]. High pressure favors the formation of char. Large oxygenates undergo cracking, producing small molecules on the MCM-41 channels. Next, the cracked molecules diffuse through the TPAOH-treated HZSM-5 structure, which forms the core of the hierarchical catalyst, where they further react to produce aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and aromatization. The important difference between hydrodeoxygenation and decarbonylation/decarboxylation is that hydrodeoxygenation removes oxygen without loss of carbon, thus leading to higher hydrocarbons yield in the liquid at the expense of higher hydrogen consumption [48]. Additional gaseous alkanes and alkenes such as CH4 and C2–C3 are produced at high temperatures. Moreover, branched aromatic molecules, such as toluene crack to form methane and benzene at high temperatures. In the CFP process, coking is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. However, hydrogen limits coke formation by cracking the macromolecules into smaller hydrocarbons or capping reactive intermediates that otherwise would form coke. Several reduced metal catalysts such as tungsten-based reducible metal oxide, iron-based mixed metal oxide, molybdenum-based reducible metal oxide, and NiMo in catalytic hydropyrolysis indicated those catalysts could lead to a high oil yield with low oxygen content. However, reduced metal catalysts were poisoned and coked leading to inactivation [12,49]. The presence of the MCM-41 catalyst layer in hierarchical micro-mesoporous composite catalyst enhances the anti-coking ability of the hierarchical catalyst. The synergistic effect of the mesoporous catalyst (MCM-41) shell and microporous catalyst (HZSM-5) core promotes catalytic activity."
12,Conclusion,"In the present study, we report results for thermal conversion of rice husk in a hydrogen atmosphere over a hierarchical catalyst. We performed a comparison between CFP and CHP, which shows that the introduction of pressurized hydrogen significantly increases catalytic activity and reduces coking. We attribute the coke reduction to cracking reactions of large aromatic hydrocarbons, which in turn generate gaseous hydrocarbon products, including CH4 and C2–C3. Methanation also appears to contribute to the production of hydrocarbon gases. Two other pathways may be involved in the formation of CH4: (1) Hydrodeoxygenation of oxygenated volatiles, resulting in aromatic compounds as intermediates, which undergo saturation reactions to generate alkanes, and (2) cracking of higher alkanes into methane. The relative content of hydrocarbons from CHP of rice husk (48.9 %) is higher than that of CFP (33.0 %). The results suggest that the hydrogen atmosphere enhances the rates of deoxygenation reaction of acids, aldehydes, and macromolecular oxygenates. The hierarchical micro-mesoporous catalyst has excellent catalytic activity, resulting in the relative content of hydrocarbons of 48.9 %, and shows excellent anti-coking performance. The relative content of hydrocarbons increases from 39.9 % to 48.9 % with increasing pressure (from 1 bar to 35 bar). On the other hand, the coke yield decreases from 3.4 wt% to 1.9 wt%. Moreover, CH4 and C2–C3 contents have a decreasing trend with increasing pressure. Our results also suggest that hydrodeoxygenation is enhanced as the temperature increases from 300 to 400 °C. In addition, branched aromatic molecules, such as toluene crack forming methane and benzene at high temperatures. We proposed a lumped reaction mechanism based on our experimental results, including the major findings of the present study."
