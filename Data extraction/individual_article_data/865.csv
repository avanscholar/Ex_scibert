Mass was matched with NIST or Wiley library; all the GC-MS results have similar retention indexes irrespective of the analysis time. Mass was analyzed by scan mode (from m/z 45 to 750)."
3,Synthesis of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and its amine-functionalized analogue,"2.3 Synthesis of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and its amine-functionalized analogue MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) were synthesized according to the reported procedure [38]. 3 mmol of FeCl3⋅6H2O (810.90 mg), 1.5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O (274.05 mg) and 4.5 mmol of terephthalic acid (747 mg) or 2-amino terephthalic acid (816.75 mg) were dissolved in 100 mL of DMF. To the clear solution, 1.5 mmol of CH3COOH (1.5 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min and refluxed at 125 °C for 5 h (Scheme 1 ). The resulting brown precipitate was collected, washed with DMF, ethanol and water, and dried under vacuum. The solid was ground into a fine powder and used as such for characterization and catalysis."
4,Catalysis,"2.4 Catalysis In a typical procedure, a certain amount of catalyst, reactant and solvent were added to a round bottom flask (10 mL). Subsequently, the reaction temperature was fixed according to the experiment (25, 40, 60, 80, 90 or 100 °C), and one equivalent of base was used. The reaction begins after the addition of base. Aliquots of the reaction mixture at different times were diluted with solvent and subjected to GC-MS analyses. At the end of reaction, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 15 min and then the product was extracted with ethyl acetate."
5,Hot filtration test and AAS analysis,"2.5 Hot filtration test and AAS analysis A hot filtration test was performed with MIL-88B(Fe2Ni). In a typical reaction, MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) (2 mg, 0.0027 mmol), 2-propanol (3 mL, 39.43 mmol), acetophenone (117 µL, 1 mmol) and NaOH (40 mg, 1 mmol) were taken in a round bottom flask, and the reaction proceeded for 30 min at 90 °C. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged, and the catalyst was separated off. The filtrate was divided into two parts. One part was refluxed at the identical conditions as the former for another 40 min, and the products were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by GC-MS. The other part was used for GC–MS and AAS analyses. GC-MS analysis gave conversion at 30 min. From AAS analysis, the amount of metal leached was found."

The catalyst was washed twice with 3 mL of DMF, ethanol, water, and acetone, dried and activated at 150 °C for 6 h in vacuum and reused."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the MIL-88B catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the MIL-88B catalysts PXRD patterns of the prepared MOFs matched well with the calculated models [23]. Both the catalysts showed signature peaks around 9 and 10°, which corresponded to 110 and 101 planes, respectively (Figs. 1a and S1a). N2 adsorption measurements were carried out for MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalysts, and their specific surface area was found to be 407 and 324 m2g−1, respectively (Figs. 1b and S1b). The shape of hysteresis loop was characteristic of type IV adsorption isotherm (multilayer adsorption) [25], and the catalyst possessed uniform pores. With SEM analysis, the surface morphology was found to be spindle shaped [38] (Figs. 2 and S2). A sharp peak seen around 750 cm-1 in their FT-IR spectra indicated the presence of metal-oxygen bonds (Fe-O/Ni-O). N-H stretching frequency was observed at 3376 cm−1, and N-H bending frequency was found around 1250 cm−1 in the spectrum of NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) [39,40]."
10,CTH effected by the mixed-metal MIL-88B catalysts,"3.2 CTH effected by the mixed-metal MIL-88B catalysts 3.2.1 CTH of acetophenone - optimization of reaction parameters CTH of acetophenone was used as a model reaction to optimize the parameters such as temperature, time, the quantity of base and the amount of solvent required. The effect of temperature on CTH was studied in the temperature range of 25–140 °C (Figure S3). The yield of 1-phenylethanol at 25 °C was minimal (22%). An increase in temperature to 40 and 60 °C increased the yield proportionally to 50 and 73%, respectively. The complete conversion was obtained at 90 °C. Further increase in temperature to 100, 120 and 140 °C did not alter the yield of product. The ideal time for the CTH was obtained by keeping all other parameters constant [2 mg of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni), 3 mL of 2-propanol, 1 mmol of acetophenone and the reaction temperature of 90 °C] as shown in Figure S4. Aliquots were taken at a time interval of 10 min and subjected to GC-MS analysis. To our delight, a maximum yield of 97% was obtained within 60 min. Thus, the optimum temperature and time were found to be 90 °C and 60 min, respectively. Similarly, the amount of catalyst required for the effective conversion was optimized with various MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) loading (1-4 mg) (Figure S5). When the catalyst amount was low (1 mg), the conversion was less (43%). Conversion with the increase in the catalyst [MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)] loading (2, 3 and 4 mg) was studied. Complete conversion of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol was obtained with 2 mg of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni). Further increase in MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) amount (above 4 mg) did not alter the conversion. This confirmed that 2 mg (0.0025 mmol) was the minimum amount of catalyst required for the reaction. Further, the effect of different bases on the CTH of acetophenone was evaluated (Figure S6). Weak bases such as K2CO3 and Et3N were not effective in converting acetophenone, whereas strong bases such as NaOH and KOH showed an excellent conversion (98 and 95%). Thus, the scope of reaction was extended to various substituted carbonyl compounds with NaOH. 3.2.2 CTH of various carbonyl compounds Both the catalysts displayed very good activity towards the conversion of acetophenone and other substituted acetophenones. The effect of substitution was examined with different electron-withdrawing and -donating groups. The substrates with electron-withdrawing group such as phenyl or halogen were converted into their respective alcohols very effectively compared to parent acetophenone (Scheme 2 , 3 a). Benzophenone was converted into diphenyl methanol promptly in 55 min (Scheme 2, 3b). The chlorine or bromine substituted acetophenones were converted into 4‑chloro or4‑bromo-1-phenylethanol, respectively, in 60 min (Scheme 2, 3c and 3d). The substrates containing electron-donating group required a bit longer reaction time relative to those with electron-withdrawing group. Methoxy substituted acetophenone required 80 min for its complete conversion (Scheme 2, 3e). Further, the versatility of the catalysts was explored with various carbonyl substrates. The conversion of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol was quicker (45 min) than that of acetophenone and substituted acetophenone derivatives (Scheme 2, 3f). 2-adamantanone was converted entirely into 2-adamantanol, which established compatibility of the catalysts with bicyclic systems (Scheme 2, 3g). Lastly, the aliphatic carbonyl compound (cinnamaldehyde) was also converted into its alcohol (cinnamyl alcohol) with good conversion of 91% (Scheme 2, 3h). The studies proved the usefulness of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalysts for the TH of various carbonyl compounds including aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic substrates. 3.2.3 CTH of biomass derivatives CTH of biomass derivatives such as furfural and levulinic acid was performed with MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni). Fortunately, excellent conversion (99%) of furfural and levulinic acid to furfuryl alcohol and GVL, respectively, was obtained within 60 min, with excellent selectivity (99%) (Scheme 3, 3i and Scheme 4 , 3j). The TOF values for these conversions were much higher than those exhibited by single metal counterpart MIL-88B(Fe3) (Table 1 ). 3.2.4 Chemoselective reduction of nitro group It was observed that the nitro functional group was preferentially reduced over the carbonyl (C=O) functional group in presence of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) or NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalyst. Both the catalysts exhibited decent selectivity (92%) in the reduction of 3-nitroacetophenone to 3-aminoacetophenone (Scheme 5 , 3k). Interestingly, the position of nitro group has altered the chemoselectivity as the selectivity of reduction of 2-nitroacetophenone was significantly reduced (71%) (Scheme 6 , 3l). 3.2.5 Gram scale synthesis of GVL To understand the catalytic activity of MOFs at higher scale, reaction was performed with 40 mmol of levulinic acid (4.6 g). The quantity of NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and other reagents was increased accordingly. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation, and the crude reaction mixture was passed through a short neutral alumina column, and the product was extracted with an excess of ethyl acetate. A pure product of GVL (3.98 g) was obtained after carefully evaporating the solvent. The activity and selectivity remained the same even in the gram scale; this disclosed the compatibility of NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) in the gram scale process. 3.2.6 Effect of NH2 substitution in the organic linker of MIL-88B on the CTH reaction The TOF values obtained for various substrates concluded that the amino group containing MOF displayed better catalytic activity than its unsubstituted counterpart (Fig. 3 ). This might be because of additional basicity provided by the amino group, which in turn stabilize the isopropoxide intermediate produced during the reaction. 3.2.7 Reusability of the mixed-metal MOF NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) was used to test the reusability and stability of mixed-metal MOFs. The catalyst was reused after solvent washing (3 × 5 mL of 2-propanol and acetone) and activation at 150 °C under vacuum for 2 h. Reusability was studied for the conversion of LA to GVL. The catalyst (recycled) exhibited similar activity in all the five cycles to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 4 ). Though the conversion varied by ±2%, the selectivity remained constant in all the cycles. The crystallinity and stability of the reused catalyst were confirmed by PXRD analysis (Figure S19). All these proved that NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalyst possesses a long catalytic life. 3.2.8 Heterogeneous nature of the mixed-metal MOF Hot filtration test results showed that the conversion of LA to GVL did not happen after the removal of catalyst NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) from the reaction mixture, i.e., the mixed-metal MOF indeed functioned as a heterogeneous catalyst (Fig. 5 ). A part of the reaction mixture (after the removal of catalyst) was subjected to AAS analysis, and the leaching of metal ions was found to be 1.55 ppm of Fe and 0.77 ppm of Ni. The trace leaching of metal ions was the reason for the meager increase in the conversion even in the absence of catalyst. Further, ICP-MS analysis was performed for the fresh and recovered catalysts (Table 2 ), which also confirmed the leaching of metal ions from the catalysts. In the case of MIL-88B(Fe2Ni), the leaching of Fe and Ni was found to be 1.7 and 0.3%, respectively while it was 1.7 (Fe) and 0.5% (Ni) in the case of NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalyst. Moreover, the conversion (96%) remained unaffected in the presence of mercury drops, which confirmed that free metal ions that leached out were not involved in the catalysis. 3.2.9 Kinetics To understand the CTH reaction of LA over NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni), kinetic studies were performed under three different reaction temperatures. In the present system, 2-propanol was used in excess, and therefore, the kinetics of reaction was assumed to be not affected by the concentration of 2-propanol. Thus, the CTH was considered as a pseudo-first order reaction wherein the rate depends only on the LA concentration. Fig. 6 shows the plot of ln Ct/C0 vs time for the conversion of LA over NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni), where C0 is the initial concentration of LA, and Ct represents the concentration of LA at a particular time. As shown in Fig. 6, the reaction followed pseudo-first order kinetics at all the studied temperatures. Rate constant values were determined to be 0.7024, -1.1324, -1.6326 and -3.0108 min−1 at 313, 333, 353 and 363 K, respectively. The variation of rate constant (k) with temperature is shown in the insert of Fig. 6. Based on the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy (Ea) was calculated and found to be 25.22 kJmol−1. The previously reported activation energy for LA to GVL conversion was 86.45 kJmol−1, which was about 3 times higher than ours [41]. Hence, we conclude that NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) mixed-metal catalyst showed exceptional activity in LA to GVL conversion. 3.2.10 Mechanism The mechanism of CTH of carbonyl compounds using MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 7 . Firstly, the deprotonation of 2-propanol is initiated by the base, leading to an active isopropoxide species which interacts with the metal center (Ni) via C-O (Step 1). The Fe center abstracts the hydride, and isopropoxide is given out as acetone followed by the interaction of the substrate with the catalyst via Fe-H (Step 2). Hydride from the Fe is then transferred to the carbonyl carbon, and proton is abstracted again from the system to form an alcohol product (Step 3). 3.2.11 Superiority of the mixed-metal MIL-88B catalytic system The catalytic efficiency of mixed-metal MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) MOFs towards the conversion of LA to GVL was compared with that of the corresponding single metal MOFs (Table S1). It was evident that the mixed-metal MOFs expressed an excellent catalytic activity [TOF = 250 h−1 for benzaldehyde with NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)] compared to the single metal MOFs [TOF = 6 h−1 for benzaldehyde with MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)]. The superior activity of the mixed-metal MOFs can be attributed to their higher surface area. The catalytic performance of the MOFs was also compared with the other reported catalysts in the literature, which used 2-propanol as a hydrogen source (Table 3 ). It was obvious that the mixed-metal MOFs exhibited excellent selectivity compared to the reported catalysts. Most of the catalysts required either harsh conditions for the reaction or a tedious process for catalyst preparation. Thus, from the viewpoint of easy preparation of catalysts, their high surface area and short CTH reaction time, MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) MOFs are the best catalysts for the TH of carbonyl compounds including biomass derived substrates."
11,Conclusions,"Two Fe-Ni MIL-88B MOFs were synthesized and characterized. MOFs exhibited a spindle shaped morphology which was confirmed by SEM analysis. Mixed-metal MOFs presented here displayed 10 times more surface area than single metal MOFsMIL-88B(Fe3). Both the mixed-metal MOFs were successfully applied as catalysts for the CTH of various carbonyl compounds including aromatic, aliphatic, alicyclic and biomass-derived substrates. Also, the catalysts selectively reduced nitro group in the presence of carbonyl moiety. The mixed-metal MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) MOFs exhibited 10-fold higher catalytic activity than single metal MIL-88B(Fe3) MOFs. There are a few reports which highlight the base (NaOH or KOH)-catalyzed TH of carbonyl compounds. These bases are effective only for simple substrates such as acetophenone and benzaldehyde, unlike the present system. Hence, MIL-88B(Fe2Ni) MOFs have many advantages including high surface area, high porosity, excellent activity and very good chemical stability. Also, the TH reaction uses an environmentally benign hydrogen donor/solvent, and it has low activation energy."
