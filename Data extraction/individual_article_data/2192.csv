0,Introduction,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biodegradable polymer with desirable mechanical properties and chemical resistance, which have attracted increasing important attention owing to its potential applications in tissue engineering, wound dressing, thermoelectric devices and food packaging materials [1–6]. However, the melt-processing of PVA is a great challenge due to its melting temperature (Tm) is very close to the initial decomposition temperature (Ti), which is largely associated with the strong hydrogen bonding both inter- and intra-molecularly as well as the semicrystalline nature of PVA [7]. Traditionally, most industrial applications of PVA are based on solution processing, which tends to be complicated with a large consumption of energy and time during post-treatment. Meanwhile, solution-processing technology is limited to yield low-dimensional PVA products like PVA film or fiber [8–12], which significantly restricts the further application and development of PVA. Consequently, it is an attractive and viable option to develop new technology for melt-processing of PVA, where the key point is to expand the melt-processing window (Ti -Tm) through reducing its Tm or increasing its Ti [13]. So far, various strategies have been exploited to improve melt processability of PVA, including solvent plasticization [14,15], blending with thermoplastic polymers [16,17] and modifying chemical structure of PVA via copolymerization or grafting [18–20]. However, most existing works usually result in undesirable influence on chemical or physical performance of PVA and require for complex treatments, which gravely hinder their industrial-scale production. Therefore, large-scale manufacture of PVA composites with highly improved melt processability and mechanical properties still remains a great challenge. Artificial marble is a non-degradable crosslinked polymeric composite composed of calcium carbonate powder and unsaturated polyester. In the past decades, artificial marble is increasingly important in housing decoration as a substitute for natural marble due to its good processability and aesthetical characteristics [21]. However, millions of tons of artificial marble wastes (AMWs) are generated as by-products during sawing or polishing process of their production, which have caused severe environmental pollution. Therefore, it is environmentally and economically desirable to convert AMWs into available resources. During recent years, various strategies have been investigated for recycling AMWs into value-added products, including use in synthetic ornamental marble, subgrade filling and building materials [22–25]. In addition, the high content of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of AMWs makes it possible to construct strong interfacial chemical interaction with polar materials, such as wood plastic composite or macromolecule, for their highly valuable applications [21,26]. Herein, we demonstrate a PVA/AMWs composite with expanded melt-processing window through supramolecular interfacial interaction and plasticization strategy. The strong hydrogen bonding interaction between AMWs and PVA can effectively confine crystallization of PVA and simultaneously improve the melt-processing window as well as the mechanical properties of resulting composites. We promise our work will provide a new insight into realization of industrial-scale melt-processing of PVA combined with high-value utilization of AMWs for both environmental and economic benefits."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Artificial marble wastes were collected from an artificial marble factory (Guangxi Lisheng Stone Co., Ltd., China) during the sawing or polishing process of their production. Poly(vinylalcohol) 1799 (PVA 1799), with a degree of polymerization 1750 ± 50 and an alcoholysis degree of 99%, was provided by SINOPEC Sichuan Vinylon Works (China). Analytical grade formamide was purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Plant (China)."
3,Preparation of melt-processed PVA/AMWs composites,"2.2 Preparation of melt-processed PVA/AMWs composites The PVA/AMWs composites were formulated according to Table 1 . Firstly, the PVA, AMWs and the formamide/water compound consisting of formamide and deionized water (mass ratio, 1:1) were blended in the laboratory mixer. Then, these mixtures were sealed in a container at ambient temperature for seven days to facilitate the process of intermolecular complexation between functional fillers and matrix material [27]. After that, the PVA mixtures were melt-mixed in the HAAKE Polylab QC mixing machine (Germany) at 160 °C for 10 min with a rotating speed of 30 rpm. The homogenized blends were subsequently broken up in to small pieces by a crusher. Finally, the PVA/AMWs composites were molded into three-dimensional samples (75 mm × 4 mm × 2 mm) using a HAAKE Minijet molding machine (Germany) with the injection pressure of 60 MPa, the Minijet barrel temperature of 170 °C, the mold temperature of 70 °C and the holding time of 10 s. The content of AMWs is defined as per hundreds of PVA matrix."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Micromorphology of AMWs powder and PVA/AMWs composites was obtained by using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-5600, JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. All the samples were sputter-coated with gold before the tests. 2.3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectra were recorded by using a NEXUS 670 instrument (Nicolet, USA). The spectra were taken from 4000 to 400 cm−1, taking over 20 scans with a resolution of 2 cm−1. The PVA/AMWs composite samples were mold-pressed to be films under a pressure of 10 MPa at 170 °C and then measured with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) model. 2.3.3 Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) Raman spectra were measured by a LabRAM HR Evolution instrument (HORIBA, France). The diode pumped Nd:YAG laser power is 500 mW and the operating wavelength is 785 nm. All the samples were measured from 100 to 3500 cm−1 with 100 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.3.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD patterns were recorded by using an Ultima IV instrument (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.1540 nm), an acceleration voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The samples were measured from 5 to 50° at 0.02°/s. The Scherrer equation is used to calculate the crystallite sizes of PVA/AMWs composites. D = K λ β 1 / 2 c o s θ where D is the crystallite size, β1/2 is the full peak width at half maximum height (FWHM), and the K is a constant which equals to 0.94. 2.3.5 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC measurements were made using a Q200 DSC instrument (TA, USA) in a nitrogen atmosphere, ranging from 50 to 250 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The tests were made in a sealing crucible in order to avoid the vaporization of plasticizers. The following equation is used to characterize the crystallinity of PVA/AMWs composites. X c = Δ H m w Δ H m o where w is the weight fraction of PVA matrix in PVA/AMWs composites, Δ H m is the heat of fusion and Δ H m o is the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline PVA which equals to 161 J/g [28]. 2.3.6 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA measurements were performed by using a Mettler Toledo TGA instrument (USA) in a nitrogen atmosphere, ranging from ambient temperature to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.3.7 Tensile test The data of tensile strength and elongation at break were obtained employing an INSTRON 5966 testing machine (USA) according to ASTM D 412-80 specification with a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min. At least five measurements of each sample were conducted."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Material design,"3.1 Material design Artificial marble is a non-degradable crosslinked polymeric composite composed of calcium carbonate powder and unsaturated polyester. There are a large number of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of AMWs, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. On the other hand, the strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interaction endows PVA with a regular molecular arrangement and high crystallinity [29,30]. The special structure of multiple hydroxyl groups, strong hydrogen bonding and high crystallinity make its Tm very close to the Ti, which implies that there is almost no melt-processing window for PVA. If the melt-processing can be realized, the applications of PVA will be largely expanded, where the key point is to expand the melt-processing window by lowering its Tm or increasing its Ti. Inspired by chemical modification and plasticization, we develop a PVA/AMWs composite with a new supramolecular hydrogen bonding network (Fig. 1 a) to simultaneously realize the expanded melt-processing window and improved mechanical properties. Briefly, AMWs, which can form intermolecular complexation with PVA through hydrogen bonding interaction, are employed as functional fillers to confine the crystallization of PVA (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, formamide, an amino group containing compound, together with water, are adopted to facilitate the intermolecular complexation between AMWs and PVA molecules. The underlying mechanism is probably that, during the plasticization by formamide/water compound, the strong hydrogen bonded -OH groups of PVA both inter- and intra-molecularly are disassociated into “free ones”. The resulting “free -OH groups” facilitate the intermolecular complexation between PVA and AMWs, thus further improving the mobility of PVA molecular chains and expanding the melt-processing window of PVA/AMWs composites (Fig. 1c)."
7,Formation of new hydrogen bonding,"3.2 Formation of new hydrogen bonding Fig. 2 a reveals the scanning electron micrograph of AMWs powder. The result shows that AMWs have tiny particle size and ideal specific surface area, which are beneficial for their dispersion in matrix materials. As shown in the FTIR spectra of neat CaCO3 and AMWs (Fig. 2b), the intensity of the band at 3433 cm−1 of AMWs attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups [31] is stronger than that of neat CaCO3, which could be ascribed to unsaturated polyester. Moreover, in comparison with neat CaCO3, two new absorption peaks at 1724 and 2927 cm−1 appear on the spectra of AMWs, which are ascribed to the stretching vibration of C=O and -CH2- groups, respectively [32]. These spectral features demonstrate the existence of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of AMWs such as -OH groups and -COOH groups, which are expected to establish hydrogen bonding interaction with hydroxyl groups of PVA. FTIR spectra of neat PVA and PVA/AMWs composites (Fig. 2c) were obtained to characterize the hydrogen bonding interaction between PVA and AMWs. The bands at 3429 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of -OH groups), 2934 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of CH2), 1148 cm−1 (the crystalline domains of PVA) and 1091 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of C-O) are fundamental absorption peaks of neat PVA [33,34]. It can be observed that the -OH related band at 3429 cm−1 shows an obvious shift towards lower wavenumber with the incorporation of formamide/water compound into PVA. This result could attribute to the breakage of hydrogen bonds both inter- and intra-molecularly in PVA molecules, accompanied by the formation of new hydrogen bonding established between -OH groups of PVA and -OH, -NH2 and C=O groups of plasticizers. Furthermore, the band at 1148 cm−1 shows a slight blue shift and the intensity of the band at 1091 cm−1 increases after the addition of AMWs and plasticizers, which indicate the variation of crystalline structure in PVA [13]. The FT-Raman spectra of neat PVA and PVA/AMWs composites were obtained to further reveal the interfacial interaction in the new supramolecular hydrogen bonding network. As shown in Fig. 2d, the bands at 2913, 1366, 1149, 1090, 916, 856 cm−1 belong to the neat PVA [33,35]. Compared with neat PVA, the intensity of bands at 2913 cm−1 and 856 cm−1 becomes weaker with the addition of plasticizers, suggesting the variation of molecular structure of PVA, the strong hydrogen bonded -OH groups of PVA both inter- and intra-molecularly are disassociated into “free ones” through forming hydrogen bonds with formamide and water. Compared with PVA-0 (melt-processed sample without AMWs), the intensity of bands at 2913 and 856 cm−1 further weaken with the incorporation of 10 wt% AMWs, which demonstrate the hydrogen bonding interaction between PVA and AMWs. Specifically, with the addition of AMWs, the “free -OH groups” on PVA molecules are partially combined with AMWs to further restrain the crystallization of PVA. These results are corresponded with the analysis of XRD."
8,Crystalline behavior of PVA/AMWs composites,"3.3 Crystalline behavior of PVA/AMWs composites Based on intermolecular complexation and plasticization, formamide/water compound and AMWs are expected to change the regular molecular arrangement of PVA, thereby, to inhibit the crystallization of PVA (Fig. 3 a) [36]. Fig. 3b shows the XRD pattern of AMWs, which is consistent with the spectra of calcium, with the characteristic peaks at 2θ of 23.1°, 29.6° and 31.1° assigned to 012, 104 and 006 crystal planes of calcium carbonate, respectively [37]. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of PVA/AMWs composites were obtained to characterize the variation of the crystalline structure in PVA. As shown in Fig. 3c, the XRD patterns of PVA/AMWs composites show the crystalline peaks of two components. The crystalline peaks at 2θ of 11.5°, 19.5° and 23.0° are found in the XRD patterns of all the samples, which can be ascribed to 100, 101 and 200 crystal planes of PVA, respectively [38,39]. With the incorporation of plasticizers and the further addition of AMWs while the AMWs content is below 10 wt%, the intensity of the crystalline peaks at 2θ of 11.5°, 19.5° and 22.8° become weaker and narrower, demonstrating that the AMWs and plasticizers could effectively confine the crystallization of PVA owing to the strong interfacial interaction between PVA and AMWs. When the content of AMWs is 15 wt%, the intensity of the crystalline peaks of PVA increases, suggesting the inhibiting effect of AMWs on crystallization of PVA is weakened due to the large agglomerates of AMWs at high filler content. The crystallite sizes of PVA/AMWs composites obtained from XRD are shown in Fig. 3d. The crystallite size of neat PVA is 18.83 nm. After intermolecular complexation using AMWs as functional fillers, the crystallite size gradually decreases to 17.17 nm. This result could be interpreted as the nucleation effect of AMWs, which also contributes to improving the melt processability of PVA since PVA with smaller crystallite size is easier to be melted during melt-processing. However, the crystallite size increases to 18.95 nm when AMWs are further added into PVA. These results are in accordance with the DSC analysis."
9,Melt processability of PVA/AMWs composites,"3.4 Melt processability of PVA/AMWs composites The heating DSC curves (Fig. 4 a) were obtained to investigate the Tm and Xc of neat PVA and PVA/AMWs composites. As shown in Fig. 4a, the peaks around 175 °C are assigned to the crystal melting peak of PVA, while the peaks around 225 °C are attributed to thermal degradation of the composites [40]. In comparison to neat PVA, the melting peaks of PVA/AMWs composites display an evident shift towards lower temperature, which demonstrates the inhibition of AMWs and formamide/water compound on crystallization of PVA. The thermal parameters obtained from analysis are listed in Table 2 . The Tm of PVA reduces sharply from 226.4 to 181.8 °C with the incorporation of formamide/water compound, suggesting that the strong hydrogen bonding both inter- and intra-molecularly in the PVA molecular is partly destroyed through intermolecular complexation by plasticizer. By further adding AMWs into PVA, the Tm of PVA is gradually reduced to as low as 167.1 °C with the incorporation of 10 wt% AMWs. Likewise, the ΔH and Xc of PVA obtained from DSC curves show the same tendency with Tm value, as shown in Table 2. The result could be ascribed to the fact that a new hydrogen boding is established between AMWs and “free -OH groups” in the PVA molecules, thus the crystalline structure of PVA is destroyed and the mobility of PVA molecular chains is further facilitated. Meanwhile, the nucleation effect of AMWs also contributes to this result. It can be also seen that the Tm increases when the content of AMWs is above 10 wt%, which is related to the aggregation of AMWs in PVA at high filler content. The TGA and DTG curves of neat PVA and PVA/AMWs composites are given in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the thermal degradation behavior of PVA/AMWs composites is similar with neat PVA with two main decomposition steps around 260 and 450 °C, respectively, which are attributed to the degradation of PVA [38]. Furthermore, about 20% weight loss of PVA/AMWs composites is observed before PVA degradation compared with neat PVA, which could be ascribed to the evaporation of plasticizers. As confirmed in the DTG curves (Fig. 4c), a new degradation peak around 225 °C appears before the first main weight loss of PVA/AMWs composites. Moreover, the carbon residue of PVA/AMWs composites increases along with the incorporation of AMWs. The initial decomposition temperature (Ti) and maximum decomposition temperature (Tp) obtained from TGA and DTG curves are listed in Table 2. Remarkably, the Ti of PVA increases from 217.7 to 244.0 °C with the addition of 10 wt% AMWs, which can be ascribed to the excellent compatibility between the functional fillers and PVA matrix. Besides, the significantly enhanced thermal stability also contributes to expanding the melt-processing window of PVA. However, The Tp of PVA/AMWs composites is lower than that of neat PVA, which is probably related to the decrease in Xc of PVA/AMWs composites. As shown in Table 2, the Tm value of neat PVA is 226.4 °C while the Ti value is 217.7 °C, which demonstrates that there is almost no melt-processing window for PVA. Benefiting from the plasticizers, the melt-processing window of PVA is preliminarily expanded to 52.3 °C (Fig. 4d). Surprisingly, with the further addition of AMWs as functional fillers, the Ti of PVA/AMWs composites shows an obvious enhancement and, simultaneously, the Tm sharply decreases. As a consequence, the melt-processing window of PVA is further expanded. The melt-processing window of 76.9 °C is realized in this work with the incorporation of 10 wt% AMWs. The improved melt processability of PVA demonstrates the inhibiting effect of AMWs on crystallization of PVA as well as the presence of the strong interfacial interaction between PVA and AMWs."
10,Mechanical properties of PVA/AMWs composites,"3.5 Mechanical properties of PVA/AMWs composites To date, most industrial applications of PVA are usually based on complicated solution processing (Fig. 5 a) due to its inadequate melt-processing window, which is limited to yield low-dimensional PVA products like PVA film or fiber. In this work, the melt-processing of PVA (Fig. 5b) can be realized with the incorporation of AMWs and formamid/water compound, thus various kinds of thermoplastic three-dimensional PVA products could be produced with a low-cost, handy and high-efficiency melt-processing technology. As shown in Fig. 5c, the tensile strength and elongation at break of PVA/AMWs composites were investigated in this work. With plasticization of formamide and water, PVA-0 with a tensile strength of 14.4 MPa was melt processed successfully. The incorporation of AMWs is expected to improve the tensile strength of resulting composites as well. Compared with the tensile strength of PVA-0 (14.4 MPa), that of PVA-10 (melt-processed sample with 10 wt% AMWs, 19.5 MPa) significantly increases by 35.4%. The result further demonstrates the good adhesion between AMWs and PVA matrix and the strong interfacial interaction established between the oxygen-containing groups of AMWs and side hydroxyl groups of PVA. Furthermore, the tensile strength sharply decreases to 13.4 MPa with the addition of 15 wt% AMWs. The result is due to the large agglomerates of AMWs in the PVA matrix at high filler content, where is always the fracture occurs as a result of stress concentration. As known, good dispersion of reinforcing fillers in polymer matrix is a key to improved properties in any composite materials [41]. The SEM micrographs of PVA/AMWs composites are given in Fig. 5d. When the content is below 10 wt%, AMWs show the relatively homogeneous dispersion in the PVA matrix without evident agglomeration owing to the strong interfacial interaction through hydrogen boding. On the other hand, the large agglomerates of AMWs in the PVA matrix at high filler content appear, as shown in PVA-15 (melt-processed sample with 15 wt% AMWs). With comprehensive consideration of melt processability and mechanical properties, the optimum filling content of AMWs is 10 wt% in this work."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, this work prepared a PVA/AMWs composite via melt-processing with improved melt processability and mechanical properties. Strong interfacial interaction is established between AMWs and PVA molecules through hydrogen bonding. The results show that AMWs fillers can effectively confine the crystallization of the PVA molecules. Owing to the nucleation effect of AMWs, the crystallite size of PVA is evidently decreased and a greatly expanded melt-processing window of 76.9 °C of PVA is realized. Beyond that, AMWs also contribute to the improved mechanical properties of the resulting composites due to the strong interfacial interaction between AMWs and PVA molecules as well as the excellent compatibility with PVA matrix. This work aims at enlarging the potential applications of PVA via melt-processing and providing a new insight into the utilization of AMWs in high valuable and high-performance composites."
