0,Introduction,"Alkylation reactions of arenes are vital in the production of active pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals [1,2]. Normally, the alkylation of arenes requires quantities of Lewis or Brønsted acids and alkyl halides (Scheme 1 a) [3,4], which produces a significant waste and byproducts. Additionally, the formation of specific C–C bonds always demands the introduction of activating groups [5]. Therefore, alternative alkylating agents and catalysts need to be developed for direct C–C coupling under mild conditions. The catalytic alkylation of arenes with alcohols as alkyl agents, which produce water as only byproduct, represents an attractive process (Scheme 1b) [6]. However, replacing the alkyl halides with environmentally friendly alcohols in the catalytic alkylation reactions remains a long-standing challenge [7]. Alkylation reactions of the benzylic alcohols catalyzed by Lewis or Brønsted acid have been reported [5,8–11]. Whereas, the industrial alkylation of arenes also accomplished via the transition metal catalysis [12,13], which limited by the reserves of the transition metals. Currently reported transition-metal-free processes are intricate and need harsh reaction conditions [14–16]. It is desirable to develop various green and atom-economic alkylation of arenes for industrial applications. Photocatalytic reaction as an alternative process holds great promise for reducing energy consumption and catalyst cost [17,18]. Recently, the photoredox catalysis was applied to the functionalization of C–H bond through the single-electron transfer pathways [19–22]. Inspired by those studies, we wondered whether it would be possible to accomplish the mild, noble-metal-free photocatalytic alkylation reactions using alcohols as radical precursors. For this purpose, the key point is the selection of a suitable photocatalyst. Firstly, the ideal photocatalyst should own suitable band structure. An efficient photocatalytic process strongly depends on the structure and property of the photocatalyst [23]. The photocatalytic reactions can occur only if the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) of the catalyst match the energy position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic reactants [24]. Secondly, the photocatalyst should utilise sun light as far as possible. Thirdly, the generated charge should readily be transferred to the surface of the catalyst to participate the reaction. Finally, the photocatalyst should own suitable surface adsorption and activation sites [25]. Among various semiconductor or plasmonic metal photocatalysts, the deficient tungsten oxide has aroused great attention because of its unique chemical and physical properties [23,26,27]. It meets the first two requirements according to the previous reports. From the energy level point of view, the HOMO energy level of benzyl alcohol (1.98 V) is more negative than the position of VB of deficient tungsten oxide (2.1 – 3.4 V), indicating that the holes derived from deficient tungsten oxide can directly oxidise benzyl alcohol [24,26]. From the electronic structure aspect, deficient tungsten oxide is the closest to metallic nanoparticles due to its unique localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption and high carrier concentration [28]. Oxygen vacancies in deficient tungsten oxide can effectively promote charge separation and adjust light absorption range of plasmonic deficient tungsten oxide, so that it can efficiently utilise the low energy photons [29–31]. The oxygen vacancies can provide abundant free electrons, which can shift up the Fermi level (E f ) to a position over the CB minimum. Upon resonant illumination, the free electrons in the E f can interact with the photons to generate LSPR. The electrons can be excited to the LSPR states and capable of reducing reactants and the holes in the VB can oxidise the reactants. Till now, it is hard to establish an effective bridge for the electron transfer from reactants to semiconductor through the physical adsorption of reactants on the surface of a semiconductor to meet the last two requirements. Intimating the construction of the suitable surface coordination complex for the high efficiency of the catalytic process in organometallic chemistry [32], we expect that introduction of the oxygen vacancies to tungsten oxide would expose coordinately unsaturated W5+ atoms. Meanwhile, the W site is also the generation site of photoelectron [33–35]. Therefore, in a suitable photocatalytic system, the specific W sites may not only coordinate with the adsorbed organic molecules for the adsorption and activation of the organic molecules but also establish a channel between deficient tungsten oxide and the organic molecules for electron transfer, which are generally considered to be favourable for efficient reaction in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, to check whether the mentioned deficient tungsten oxide functional surface works, the alkylation of arenes with alcohols as alkylation agents over plasmonic WO3– x was investigated. It is inspiring that red light (660 nm) can induce this photocatalytic reaction. On the one hand, bulk and surface oxygen vacancies in WO3– x can synergistically extend the light absorption range and enhance the free electrons densities to support the LSPR with the low energy photons. On the other hand, surface oxygen vacancies can ensure the chemisorption of alcohols on WO3– x surface and promote the activation of alcohols via an efficient delivery of the holes to the chemisorption alcohol species. This study provides a new route access to fulfill the construction of challenging C–C bonds."

The WO3– x was calcinated at 800 °C in air for 10 h and the obtained catalyst was denoted as WO3. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of WO3 was shown in Fig. S1b."
4,Modification of WO3– x,2.3 Modification of WO3– x WO3– x was modified by Ag or 4-aminothiophenol according to the reported method [36].
5,Characterisation,"2.4 Characterisation The XRD patterns, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a MiniFlex II diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), JEM-7100F, and JEM-2100F instruments, respectively. The diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DR UV–vis), steady-state photoluminescence (PL), Raman, transient absorption (TA), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectra of the catalysts were recorded on Hitachi UV-3900, Hitachi F-7000 (equipped with 325 nm excitation light), Jobin Yvon HR-800 (equipped with a 514 nm laser), Edinburgh LP980 (equipped with single-wavelength and broadband capabilities), and Bruker Tensor II spectrometers, respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in surface and in depth direction via argon plasma etching were recorded on ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system with an Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated with the C 1 s peak (284.6 eV). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded using Bruker EMXPLUS10/12 EPR electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms experiments were carried out on the Micromeritics, TriStar II 3020 analyser at 77 K. Specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method."
6,Photocatalytic performance evaluation,"2.5 Photocatalytic performance evaluation 1 mL of benzene, 0.1 mmol of benzyl alcohol and 5 mg of catalyst were added to the reactor and then the reaction was carried out in argon atmosphere (1 atm) at 75 °C for 40 min under red LED (centred at 660 nm) or other single coloured LED light irradiation. Other LED lights contain blue LED (centred at 455 nm), green LED (centred at 525 nm), red LED-625 (centred at 625 nm), and red LED-696 (centred at 696 nm) the light intensity was 0.15 W cm−2. After the reaction, the products were qualitatively analyzed using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra spectrometer and quantitatively analyzed by a Shimadzu 2014C GC with a WondaCap 5 column. The conversion (%), yield (%), and selectivity (%) of the reaction are calculated according to the area normalization method by the following equations: Conversion = (1 - (Ct / C0)) × 100% Yield = (CProduct / C0) × 100% where Ct = concentration of limiting reagent at time t, C0 = initial concentration of limiting reagent and CProduct = concentration of product after reaction. Selectivity = Yield / Conversion × 100% The TOF of the reaction is calculated using the following equation (moles of catalyst is the total moles of catalyst used in the reaction system instead of the moles of catalytic sites): TOF = moles of reagent/(moles of catalyst × time)"
7,Photoelectrochemical test,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical test Transient photocurrent, Mott-Schottky curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D, CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) with a xenon lamp (CEL-HXF 300, Beijing Aulight Co. Ltd., 380 – 700 nm) or a red LED (centered at 660 nm). The three-electrode system contains the work electrode, reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode), and counter electrode (Pt wire). The work electrode was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. The catalyst (5 mg) was dispersed in 1 mL of mixture solution of water and ethanol (water: ethanol = 2:3) and 10 μL Nafion (DuPont, 5 wt%) to form a slurry solution. 20 μL of the slurry was coated on the FTO glass and dried 25 °C for 12 h. The transient photocurrent measurements were conducted under light irradiation in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). Mott-Schottky plots were acquired using the impedance-potential technique in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution. To exclude the influence of surface state chemical and bulk dielectric capacitance, the anodes were scanned at 800 Hz intermediate frequency in −1.0 – 0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl electrode) [37]. The potentials versus RHE were calculated by the Nernst equation:[38] ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + Eo Ag/AgCl where ERHE refers to the converted potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The value of Eo Ag/AgCl is 0.197 V at 25 °C and EAg/AgCl is the obtained potential versus Ag/AgCl electrode."

9,Characterisation of the materials and manipulating surface and bulk oxygen vacancies to control the W5+ exposure and electronic properties,"3.1 Characterisation of the materials and manipulating surface and bulk oxygen vacancies to control the W5+ exposure and electronic properties The WO3– x (WO3– x in this article represents the deficient tungsten oxide synthesised at 180 °C unless otherwise stated) were synthesised by a solvothermal method (Fig. 1 a) [39]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of sample was consistent with the monoclinic WO3– x (Fig. S1) [39], the narrow (010) and (020) peaks and the other broad peaks in Fig. S1a strongly suggest that the growth direction of the sample is [010]. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) exhibited the morphology of WO3– x was flower-like with each petal consisted of nanowires (Fig. S2). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis showed that the lattice fringe spacing is 0.37 nm, attributing to monoclinic WO3– x (010) planes (Fig. S3). Therefore, the WO3– x nanowires are grown along the [010] direction. The diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (DR UV–vis) of WO3– x shows a broad absorption throughout the visible region (Fig. 2 d), which can be assigned to the LSPR arising from the electronic oscillation of WO3– x surface [40]. Introduction of the oxygen vacancies (OVs) as inherent defects of the metal oxide is a promising method for improving the photocatalytic performance [41]. Therefore, we expect to investigate the influence of distribution and concentrations of the OVs of deficient tungsten oxide on the light absorption properties, charge separation, and surface reaction kinetics. The influence of synthetic temperature of the catalyst on the OVs in catalyst was studied. The samples were synthesised at 160 and 200 °C, respectively. The XRD patterns of the samples show an increase of the intensity of (010) peak with increasing synthetic temperature (Fig. S4), indicating that the crystallinity of samples improves with increasing synthetic temperature. The DR UV–vis spectra of the samples exhibit an increase of the absorption in wavelength above 600 nm with increasing synthetic temperature, indicating the increase of OVs amounts in the sample (Fig. S4b). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis also identifies that the amounts of surface OVs of deficient tungsten oxide synthesised at different temperature follows the order of WO3– x (200 °C) > WO3– x (180 °C) > WO3– x (160 °C) (Fig. S4c and 4d, Table S3). The surface OVs and electronic structure of WO3– x can be modulated by modifying Ag or 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) on WO3– x surface (Fig. 1a) [36,42]. The XRD patterns of WO3– x before and after modification are similar and peaks related to Ag nanoparticles are observed in Ag/WO3– x (Fig. S10a) [36]. The W 4f XPS spectra of the modified WO3– x show no significant difference compared with the WO3– x (Fig. S10c). An obvious decrease of the ratio of Oads in O 1 s XPS spectra of the modified WO3– x can also be observed (Fig. S10d), demonstrating that modifying Ag or 4-ATP on WO3– x surface can occupy some OV sites to affect the adsorption of reactants. The DR UV–vis spectra of the modified WO3– x show a decrease of the absorption intensity compared with WO3– x (Fig. S10b), indicating the decrease of the surface free electrons density in Ag/WO3– x or 4-ATP/WO3– x resulted from the charge transfer from WO3– x to Ag or 4-ATP [36]. The tungsten oxide catalysts with different OV amounts and distribution were obtained by calcinating WO3– x at 300 °C in air for different time (Fig. 1a). The WO3– x was calcinated at 300 °C in air for 2, 4, 10, 20 min and the obtained catalysts were denoted as WO3– x -T2, WO3– x -T4, WO3– x -T10, WO3– x -T20, respectively. Various characterisations of the surface and bulk OVs of the catalysts were conducted to identify the vital role of the OVs in the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene. All of the catalysts exhibit similar diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns (Fig. S11), demonstrating the calcination has small effect on the crystal structure. A small decrease (the largest change is 8% between WO3– x and WO3– x -T20, much smaller than the corresponding activity change at 97%) of the specific surface area of the thermal treated catalysts can be observed (Table S4), indicating the change of the specific surface area is not the major reason for the difference of the photocatalytic activity. The XPS analysis can confirm the oxidation state of tungsten and the existence of OVs (Fig. 1b and S12). The W 4f XPS of the catalysts can be fitted to two doublets (Fig. 1b). A doublet at 38.7 (W6+ 4f5/2) and 36.6 eV (W6+ 4f7/2) is observed in the catalyst [43]. The other doublet at 38.1 and 36.0 eV can be ascribed to the W5+ 4f5/2 and W5+ 4f7/2 [44], respectively, revealing the OVs exist in the catalyst [45]. The O 1 s XPS spectra of the catalysts can be divided into two peaks located at 531.1 eV and 532.1 eV, which can be attributed to the lattice oxygen atoms (OL) and adsorbed oxygen species (Oads), respectively (Fig. S12) [29,46]. The Oads observed at 532.1 eV can also confirm the existence of OVs in the catalyst. The atomic ratios and elemental composition of all the catalysts surface as obtained from the XPS analysis are shown in Table S5. The amounts of W5+ on thermal-treated catalysts surface is close to that of original WO3– x , indicating the catalysts have similar amounts of surface OVs. According to above results, there is no significant difference of the adsorption of reactants on coordinately unsaturated W5+ of original and thermal-treated catalysts. Since the similarity of surface OVs concentrations, the XPS analysis in depth direction via the appreciable argon plasma etching to remove the outer surface layer were conducted to measure the bulk OVs in the catalyst [47]. All of the catalysts have a significant amount of W5+ even after the argon plasma etching (Fig. 1c). The ratio of W5+ in the bulk are calculated by the XPS analysis in depth direction (Table S6), WO3– x shows the largest amounts of bulk OVs. The amounts of bulk OVs of the tested catalysts follows the order of WO3– x > WO3– x -T2 > WO3– x -T4 > WO3– x -T10 > WO3– x -T20. Fig. S13 shows the Raman spectra of the catalysts with 514 nm excitation laser line, which can also reflect the bulk information of the catalysts. Raman peaks at around 710 and 800 cm−1 are the W–O–W stretching mode, and Raman shifts at around 270 and 340 cm−1 are the W–O–W bending mode [48]. The FWHM of Raman shifts at around 270 and 800 cm−1 of the catalysts gradually narrows with the increasing of the thermal treated time (Table S7), indicating the decrease of bulk defects in the catalysts and WO3– x possesses the largest amounts of bulk OVs [49]. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can also prove the existence of OVs, all of the catalysts display a symmetrical peak at g = 2.004, which caused by the unpaired electron trapped at the OVs (Fig. S14) [29]. The order of the concentrations of OVs in the catalysts is WO3– x > WO3– x -T2 > WO3– x -T4 > WO3– x -T10 > WO3– x -T20, which is consistent with the XPS and Raman results. The influence of OVs on the light absorption properties, electronic structure, and charge separation of the photocatalysts with different concentrations of OVs are further investigated. The DR UV–vis spectra reveal that the OVs greatly improve the light absorption ability and the absorption intensity decreases with decreasing quantity of the bulk OVs after thermal treating (Fig. 1d (inset)). A distinct upward absorption tail is observed at the visible light region, indicating the presence of the impurity states induced by the OVs. The calculated band gap energy (E g ) value of WO3– x from the intercept of tangents to the plots of (Ahν)2 versus photo energy is around 2.53 eV, whereas the E g of the thermal-treated catalysts gradually increases with thermal-treated time prolonging (Fig. 1d) [50]. WO3– x with the largest amounts of bulk OVs shows the narrowest band gap and strongest light absorption to utilise more photoexcited electrons with low energy. To better understand the electronic properties of the catalysts, Mott–Schottky curves of the catalysts with different OVs concentrations were measured (Fig. 1e), the Mott–Schottky curves of all of the catalysts exhibit a positive slope, revealing the n-type characteristics [38]. Moreover, WO3– x exhibits the smallest slope than those thermal-treated catalysts, indicating WO3– x has the highest charge carrier density [31]. The calculated charge carrier densities of WO3– x , WO3– x -T2, WO3– x -T4, WO3– x -T10, and WO3– x -T20 are 4.43 × 1020, 2.10 × 1020, 1.89 × 1020, 1.44 × 1020, and 1.21 × 1020 cm−3, respectively (Table S8). The charge carrier density of WO3– x is almost four times than that of WO3– x -T20, resulting in better elctron-hole separation properties within the catalyst [51]. Therefore, WO3– x exhibits the highest photocurrent density than that of thermal-treated catalysts (Fig. S15). In additon, the CB positions of WO3– x , WO3– x -T2, WO3– x -T4, WO3– x -T10, and WO3– x -T20, which are calculated by Mott-Schottky curves and Nernst equation, are −0.40, −0.35, −0.34, −0.32, and −0.31 V (versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), respectively (Table S9). WO3– x with the largest amounts of bulk OVs has a much lower CB level compared with any others and the schematic illustration of the band structure for the catalysts are shown in Fig. S18. To investigate the interfacial kinetics and carrier motion situation, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves of WO3– x to WO3– x -T20 were measured at the open circuit potential. The EIS curves of all of the catalysts show one semicircle, demonstrating there is only one time constant (Fig. 1f) [52]. WO3– x shows the minimum arc, which indicates a relatively small impedance and is conducive to the separation and transmission of charge carriers [53]. Fig. 1g shows the photoluminescence emission (PL) spectra of the catalysts using 325 nm excitation light. WO3– x exhibits the lowest PL intensity among the catalysts, which is consistent with the Mott-Schottky, photocurrent and ESI results. Considering all of the catalysts have similar quantity of surface OVs, the enhanced separation efficiency of the charge-carriers is attributed to the largest amounts of bulk OVs on WO3– x . It indicates that the bulk OVs can suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and improve charge separation efficiency in the bulk, for the OV functions as an electron donor can increase the carrier density and provide photoinduced charge traps to promote charge seperation [54,55]."
10,WO3– x specified photocatalytic activity,"3.2 WO3– x specified photocatalytic activity We investigated the photocatalytic activity of WO3– x by the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol under argon atmosphere. Although the TOF of the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene increased from 2 to 8.7 h−1 with the concentration of benzyl alcohol increasing from 0.1 to 0.6 mol L-1, the selectivity decreased from 86% to 64% (Table S1). No significant improvement of the catalytic performance was observed and the TOF decreased with increasing WO3– x amounts (Table S2). With the optimised experimental conditions, >99% of benzyl alcohol was converted in 40 min and the selectivity of diphenylmethane was 89% under red light irradiation (entry 1, Table 1 ). The byproduct was the 1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol (selectivity was 11%). The conversion of benzyl alcohol was 56% with only 45% selectivity of diphenylmethane when the reaction was conducted in the dark. The main product was benzyl ether (selectivity was 55%). The results demonstrate that 660 nm red light can indeed improve the activity and selectivity of the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene. No products were detected under red light irradiation or in the dark when WO3– x (160 °C) was used (entry 2, Table 1). The reaction selectivity decreased to 71% over WO3– x (200 °C) under red light irradiation (entry 3, Table 1). Therefore, WO3– x (180 °C) exhibits the most excellent catalytic performance under 660 nm red light irradiation. These results indicate that OV is vital active site in the reaction and only appropriate amounts of OVs can ensure the high activity and selectivity of the reaction via the above analysis of the catalysts. The as-obtained WO3, commercial WO3 or in the absence of WO3– x did not show catalytic activity (entries 4, 5 and 10, Table 1). We also tested the photocatalytic activity of γ-Al2O3, TiO2 (anatase), and ZrO2 (entries 6–8, Table 1), which showed unsatisfactory photocatalytic activity in identical conditions. AlCl3, which was always applied for the alkylation of arenes, only exhibited 5% conversion of benzyl alcohol (entry 9, Table 1). These results reveal that the photocatalysis of plasmonic WO3– x is the main reason for the generation of diphenylmethane upon 660 nm red light irradiation. No products were detected under red light irradiation or in the dark when Ag/WO3– x or 4-ATP/WO3– x was used. Therefore, it is difficult for WO3– x to adsorb reactants and transfer electrons to them in the presence of Ag or 4-ATP. The yields of diphenylmethane on the samples WO3– x -T2, WO3– x -T4, WO3– x -T10, and WO3– x -T20 gradually decreased to 56%, 40%, 17%, and 3%, respectively (Fig. 1h). According to above analysis of the catalysts, there is no significant difference of the adsorption of reactants on coordinately unsaturated W5+ of original and thermal-treated catalysts. The difference of photocatalytic performance of catalysts before and after thermal treating mainly arises from the bulk OVs. WO3– x possesses the largest amounts of bulk OVs, which shows the narrowest band gap, a much lower CB level compared with any others and strongest light absorption to utilise more photoexcited electrons with low energy. Meanwhile, WO3– x has the highest charge carrier density [31] and separation efficiency of the charge-carriers [53]. Above results can provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate why WO3– x exhibits the excellent photocatalytic performance. We further investigated the reaction kinetics. With the prolonging of reaction time, the yield of diphenylmethane gradually increased and the yield of benzyl ether gradually decreased to zero under red light irradiation (Fig. 2a). Unlike the photocatalytic reaction, when the reaction was conducted in the dark (Fig. 2b), the yield of diphenylmethane was less than that of benzyl ether in the whole process. The reaction kinetic data obtained at different temperatures for the benzylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol over WO3– x under red light irradiation and in the dark are presented in Fig. S6. It exhibits a typical zero-order kinetic reaction character. The reaction rate constant increased gradually when the reaction temperature increased both under light irradiation and in the dark. The reaction rate constant for benzylation of benzene under red light irradiation at 75 °C (1.75 × 10-3 mol L-1 min−1, Fig. S6a) is 4.5 times larger than that conducted in the dark at 75 °C (3.87 × 10-4 mol L-1 min−1, Fig. S6b), indicating the 660 nm red light can accelerate the benzylation of benzene. Meanwhile, the red light irradiation can cause 51% decrease in the activation energy (the apparent activation energy decreased from 155.2 (in the dark) to 75.9 kJ mol−1 (under red light irradiation), Fig. S8 and S9). The reaction kinetic data for the benzylation of benzene with benzyl ether were also obtained to study whether the benzyl ether was an intermediate in benzylation of benzene (Fig. S7). If benzyl ether is an intermediate, the reaction rate of the continuous reaction depends on the rate-determining step of the reaction (see details in reaction kinetics in Supporting Information). According to the kinetic data, the benzylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol (1.75 × 10-3 mol L-1 min−1) was comparable to that for the reaction rate constant for the benzylation of benzene with benzyl ether (1.71 × 10-3 mol L-1 min−1). Therefore, the benzylation of benzene with benzyl ether was the rate-determining step of the continuous reaction (k1 > k2). When k1 > k2, the accumulation of benzyl ether can be observed (Fig. 2a), indicating that benzyl ether is the intermediate of the reaction. Additionally, the reaction rate constant for the benzylation of benzene with benzyl ether under red light irradiation at 75 °C (1.71 × 10-3 mol L-1 min−1, Fig. S7) is 2.7 times larger than that of in the dark at 75 °C (6.41 × 10-4 mol L-1 min−1, Fig. S7), indicating 660 nm red light can also accelerate the conversion of benzyl ether to diphenylmethane to enhance the selectivity of the reaction. In addition, the yield of diphenylmethane and the light contribution gradually increased with increasing light intensity (Fig. 2c), indicating red light is vital for the photocatalytic benzylation and more electrons are excited to promote the photocatalytic activity with increasing light intensity [56]. The plasmonic photocatalyst can transduce light into photothermal and LSPR effects [57]. To explore the influence of LSPR effect of WO3– x on the photocatalytic activity and exclude the photothermal effect, the reactions with different single colored LED lights were conducted. The temperature of the reaction system under 660 nm red light irradiation was maintained at 75 °C, which was tested using a thermocouple. Therefore, the photothermal effect has little influence on the reaction. In addition, the yields under different wavelengths coincide with the DR UV–vis spectrum of WO3– x (Fig. 2d), indicating the reactions are driven by the LSPR of WO3– x via the LSPR excited electrons being transferred to the adsorbed reactants on WO3– x instead of the photothermal effect. As shown in Fig. S5, the product yield increased under light irradiation or in the dark with increasing temperature. And the product yield under light irradiation was obviously higher than that of in the dark, indicating that light can improve the catalytic performance via the excited electron transfer pathway."
11,"Surface adsorption-activation process, intermediate species identification, and reaction mechanism","3.3 Surface adsorption-activation process, intermediate species identification, and reaction mechanism The adsorption of reactants on the surface of the catalyst is vital for the surface reaction kinetics of the heterogeneous catalysis, which can increase the concentration of the reactants on the surface of the catalyst to accelerate the reaction [58,59]. Additionally, the chemisorption of reactants on the catalytic sites of the catalyst can facilitate the activation of the reactants and the transfer of the excited electrons from the catalyst to the reactants [60,61]. Therefore, the adsorption and activation of reactants on WO3– x surface was investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Benzene was firstly adsorbed on WO3– x surface and the physical adsorbed benzene was removed by purging argon for 10 min at 75 °C (Fig. 3 , spectrum a). The bands at 3083 and 3056 cm−1 (C–H stretching vibration, νC–H), 1599 and 1493 cm−1 (C–C stretching vibration of phenyl ring, νC–C) are the typical absorption bands of benzene. Then benzyl alcohol was dropped on WO3– x surface followed by argon purging (Fig. 3, spectrum b). The absorption bands at 3403 cm−1 (O–H stretching vibration (νO–H) of physisorption benzyl alcohol), 2928 and 2872 cm−1 (C–H stretching vibration of CH2, νCH2), and 1095 cm−1 (C–O bending vibration (δC–O) of physisorption benzyl alcohol) indicate the presence of physisorption of benzyl alcohol. With the continuous argon purging for 3, 6, and 9 min, the intensity of the characteristic absorption bands of benzyl alcohol gradually decreased (Fig. 3, spectra c-d); meanwhile, the νO-H moved from 3403 to 3365 cm−1 (νO-H of chemisorption benzyl alcohol) and the δC–O moved from 1095 to 1135 cm−1 (δC–O of chemisorption benzyl alcohol). These results indicate that the benzyl alcohol is chemisorbed on WO3– x surface via the interaction of oxygen atom with the exposed W5+ of WO3– x . The hydrogen of OH interacts with the adjacently oxygen atom of WO3– x via the hydrogen bond (schematic illustration in Fig. 3). The adsorption of benzyl alcohol on the surface of WO3 (no OV sites) were also investigated by in situ DRIFT. As shown in Fig. S16, the characteristic peaks of physisorption benzyl alcohol appeared at 3399 cm−1 (νO-H of physisorption benzyl alcohol), 2927 and 2868 cm−1 (νCH2), 1207 cm−1 (C–H bending vibration of CH2, δC–H), and 1095 cm−1 (δC–O of physisorption benzyl alcohol) when the benzyl alcohol was dropped on WO3 surface. With the continuous argon purging for 3, 6, and 9 min, the intensity of characteristic absorption bands of benzyl alcohol gradually decreased. However, no peak shifts can be observed in the process. Those results indicate the vital role of surface OVs in the chemisorption of benzyl alcohol. The dark reaction was conducted at 75 °C (Fig. 3, spectrum f), no obvious change of the peaks, but the intensity of the bands of chemisorption benzyl alcohol at 3365 cm−1 (νO–H) and 1135 cm−1 (δC–O) decreased, indicating that the vibration of O–H and C–O weaken because of the interaction of benzyl alcohol with the OV of WO3– x . When light was introduced to the system for 5 and 25 min (Fig. 3, spectra g and h), the chemisorption of benzyl alcohol at 3365 cm−1 (νO–H) and 1135 cm−1 (δC–O) disappeared, indicating the consumption of benzyl alcohol. Meanwhile, the band appeared at 1247 cm−1 (C–O–C bending vibration of benzyl ether, δC–O–C) indicates the formation of benzyl ether. The interaction between benzyl alcohol and WO3– x and the reaction process were observed via in situ DRIFT spectra, which verify the role of OVs of WO3– x and provide enough evidence for further illustrating the mechanism. As shown in Fig. S17a, the W 4f XPS spectra of WO3– x adsorbed with benzyl alcohol were similar with that of WO3– x . The ratio of Oads in O 1 s XPS decrease from 18.9% to 13% and the existence of the oxygen of benzyl alcohol (Obenzyl alcohol) after the adsorption of benzyl alcohol on WO3– x surface can illustrate the adsorption of benzyl alcohol on surface OV sites of WO3– x (Fig. S17b). Furthermore, 4-tert-butylcatechol (TBC) were added to prove the existence of carbon radical in the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene [62]. The conversion of benzyl alcohol gradually decreased to 10.5% with increasing amounts of TBC (Fig. S19a). The addition of KI (hole scavenger) and AgNO3 (electron scavenger) led to the decreased conversion of benzyl alcohol (Fig. S19b and S19c), demonstrating the involvement of hole and electron in the process. Meanwhile, the DMPO spin-trapped EPR spectra can also identify the presence of carbon radical (Fig. S20). The characteristic peaks of DMPO-C· and DMPO-H· were observed when WO3– x was dispersed in benzyl alcohol under light irradiation [63]. No corresponding peaks were observed either in the dark or in the absence of WO3– x . These results indicate that the photocatalytic benzylation of benzene over WO3– x is a carbon radical mechanism. Moreover, no such characteristic peaks can be observed when WO3 was dispersed in benzyl alcohol under light irradiation or in the dark, indicating the OVs of WO3– x photocatalyst can facilitate the adsorption of benzyl alcohol and the transfer of excited electron to the adsorbed benzyl alcohol. The radical-based mechanism can also explain why almost 80% of benzyl alcohol was converted in 10 min (Fig. 1a), since the reaction can proceed very fast to form the benzyl ether once the radical intermediates were formed [64]. We investigated the scope of the photocatalytic alkylation of arenes with alcohols under the optimised reaction conditions, such photocatalytic systems can be successfully applied to various substituted arenes and alcohols with good conversion and selectivity (Table 2 ). The benzylation of non-active benzene proceeded smoothly (entry 1, Table 2). A variety of electron-rich arenes, such as toluene, mesitylene, anisole, and p-xylene (entries 2–4 and 6, Table 2) gave the corresponding benzylated arenes in excellent conversion and selectivity. In addition, when benzotrifluoride was used as the solvent and the molar ratio of p-xylene to benzyl alcohol were 5:1, the conversion and selectivity of the reaction were>99% (entry 7, Table 2). The acetyl groups is an electron withdrawing group, which will reduce the electron density of the benzene ring to reduce the reactivity of the benzene ring. Additionally, the acetyl group is also a meta-position directing group, so the electrophilic substitution of benzene ring will occur at the meta-position of the acetyl group [65]. The benzylation of electron-poor acetophenone (entry 5, Table 2) gave corresponding product with>99% conversion and 92% selectivity for the meta-position product. The electron-poor chlorobenzene can also react with benzyl alcohol to afford 1-benzyl-4-chlorobenzene with>99% conversion in 2 h and the selectivity for the para-, meta-, and ortho-position products were 54%, 4%, and 42%, respectively (entry 8, Table 2). The photocatalytic alkylation of p-xylene with various alcohols were also investigated. Electron-rich 4-methyl benzyl alcohol afforded the corresponding benzylated p-xylene product in excellent yield (>99%, entry 9, Table 2). Meanwhile, electron-poor 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol can be successfully converted to corresponding products with>99% yield (entries 10–11, Table 2). Even 1-phenylethanol, with bulky substituents at the benzylic carbon, can react with p-xylene to produce corresponding benzylated arenes with>99% yield (entry 12, Table 2). The 2-buten-1-ol can also react with to afford alkylated arenes with 98% yield (entry 13, Table 2). In addition, the 2-thiophenemethanol can react with p-xylene to construct heteroaromatic with 97% yield (entry 14, Table 2). Unfortunately, it seems difficult for the photocatalytic alkylation of arenes over WO3– x to use strong electron donating 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and alkyl alcohols as the alkyl agents. These results show that WO3– x photocatalyst is efficient for the photocatalytic alkylation of various substituted arenes with alcohols. After reaction, WO3– x can be recycled by facile centrifugation for next use. There was no considerable decrease in the conversion and selectivity after five cycles (Fig. S21a). The XRD patterns, DR UV–vis spectra and XPS analysis of WO3– x recycled after five times are almost overlapped with that of fresh WO3– x (Fig. S21b-e), demonstrating the excellent stability of WO3– x ."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we synthesised a plasmonic WO3– x with multifunctional oxygen vacancies, which were successfully applied to the alkylation of arenes using alcohols as alkylating agents under mild conditions with 660 nm red light irradiation. The usage of alcohols produces water as the only byproduct. The oxygen vacancies are beneficial to extending the light absorption region and enhancing the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the surface oxygen vacancies can ensure the chemisorption of alcohols on the surface of WO3– x and promote the activation of alcohols via an efficient transport of the photogenerated holes to the chemisorption alcohol species. The synergetic enhancement of the surface reaction kinetics and the bulk charge separation efficiency of WO3– x ensures the high activity and selectivity of the photocatalytic alkylation under low energy red light irradiation. This work will not only be helpful in understanding the vital role of oxygen vacancies in the chemisorption of reactant and the charge carrier separation efficiency in solar-driven chemical transformation, but also provide a new insight for such oxygen vacancy-rich tungsten oxide nanostructures being applied to more solar-driven organic synthesis."
