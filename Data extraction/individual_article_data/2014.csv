0,Introduction,"Research on the viable production and application of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels has accelerated in recent years and has been further propelled by various environmental problems associated with fossil fuels, including greenhouse gas emission, global warming and increasing demands amidst unprecedented price hikes with an unstable supply. Furthermore, the sustainability of fossil fuels is limited by dwindling oil reserves [1]. Therefore, an alternative source of energy has to be developed to minimise or even eliminate the dependability on fossil fuels [1]. One potentially advantageous alternative energy form is biohydrogen [2]. As an energy carrier, hydrogen can be used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) where the hydrogen can be converted to electricity at a high level of efficiency [3]. Hydrogen also has the highest energy density among other energy carriers, such as gasoline, diesel and natural gas, which further highlights its potential use as a renewable energy source. In general, there are three methods to produce hydrogen: steam reformation from hydrocarbons, water splitting and biological means [4], which involves microorganisms functioning in bio-photolysis, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation processes [5,6]. Photo and dark fermentation processes have an advantage over photolysis because the hydrogen gas can be generated using agricultural or industrial waste as the raw material [5]. Notably, hydrogen production through dark fermentation processes requires simple technology, is less expensive and achieves higher production rates compared to photo bioprocesses [7]. However, the major drawback for dark fermentation is that it only generates a moderate hydrogen yield compared to conventional reformation techniques [8,9]. There are many ongoing studies worldwide focussing on optimising fermentative hydrogen production with the aim of improving hydrogen production rates and net energy yield. These studies include screening potential lignocellulosic feedstock biomass and wastewater, developing multistep hydrogen biosynthesis methods consisting of dark and photofermentation and isolating novel hydrogen producers from the environment such as from soil, water bodies, industrial sludge and plants [1,3,8,10,11]. Organisms, including insects and animals, may also be a source of novel isolates. The termite is one of the insects with a high potential due to the variety of microflora living symbiotically inside its guts [12]. It is believed that the existence of these microorganisms led to the termite's ability to digest lignocellulosic biomass, such as dried wood, leaves and tree bark [13]. Therefore, research on bacterial isolates from termites with potential lignocellulose-degrading microbes would be highly beneficial in terms of pretreatment costs. In addition, the source of the microorganisms could influence the performance of the fermentation system, including hydrogen yield [14]. Previous studies have reported success in isolating bacteria from the termite gut, such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Clostridium sp., which are known to produce hydrogen through dark fermentation [15,16]. In addition, some of these bacteria are able to hydrolyse lignocelluloses, celluloses and hemicelluloses [15]. In one study, biohydrogen production was reported by a Clostridium termitidis CT1112 culture that originated from termite guts, where cellobiose and α-cellulose were used as the sole carbon source for fermentation [17]. Hydrogen-producing bacteria using dark fermentation can be classified into two main groups, obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, which include enteric bacteria [5]. Fermentative studies using strict anaerobes, particularly those from Clostridium sp., have proven to be very effective at producing hydrogen [7,8]. Furthermore, microbial community analysis of anaerobic sludge that was observed for hydrogen production reported that Clostridium sp. was the dominant microbe [5,18,19]. However, the cultivation of obligate anaerobes has encountered some limitations to the fermentative process because of the inhibition of growth in the culture by low concentrations of oxygen [20]. On the other hand, enteric bacteria can utilise available oxygen and retain their hydrogen-producing ability when the oxygen supply is depleted. E. cloacae DM11, which has been reported to be a good hydrogen producer, achieved 660 ml H2/l/h production at a yield of 3.8 mol H2/mol substrate [11]. This study involves the isolation and characterisation of hydrogen-producing bacteria from the guts of termites and identification of the isolate with the highest biohydrogen production. The selected isolate was used to study environmental effects on hydrogen production, including operating temperature and initial pH. Batch fermentation was employed to analyse metabolite production and the association of hydrogen production with bacterial growth."
1,Materials and method,
2,Collection of termite samples,"2.1 Collection of termite samples The termites were collected in piles of degraded palm fronds and empty fruit bunches at a palm oil plantation in Kampung Batu Laut, Morib, Selangor, Malaysia. During transfer to the laboratory, the termites were stored in a glass bottle with some damp palm fronds for food and water, and the bottle was capped with filter paper to ensure ventilation."
3,Isolation of bacteria,"2.2 Isolation of bacteria Isolation of the bacterial community within the termite gut was performed with the intention to isolate as many bacteria as possible and different types of bacteria available within the termite guts. Isolation included anaerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes as well as hydrogen-producing bacteria that are commonly found in both groups. The isolation method used was a modified method developed by Adams and Boopathy [21]. After selecting approximately 20 worker termites, the termites were surface sterilised with 70% ethanol to ensure the outer surface of the insect was free from other microorganisms. The termites were divided into four groups consisting of five termites in each group. Under sterile conditions, each group was dissected, and the lower gut was cut and suspended into four universal bottles; two bottles contained 10 ml of nutrient broth (NB; Merck, Germany) and two bottles contained 10 ml of reinforced Clostridial medium (RCM; Oxoid Ltd, England). The inoculated NB and RCM media were incubated aerobically at 30 °C and anaerobically at 37 °C. Anaerobic conditions were prepared by sparging the medium with pure nitrogen gas prior to inoculation. After 24 h of cultivation, the cultures were spread onto agar plates (1.5% w/v agar) of the same media. Each of the isolated colonies was further purified by subsequent culturing and plating until pure cultures were obtained."
4,Screening and selection of hydrogen-producing isolates,"2.3 Screening and selection of hydrogen-producing isolates The screening of a hydrogen-producing strain was performed by culturing the pure isolates in serum bottles under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the cultures were observed for biogas production throughout the fermentation period. Once an isolate was observed to produce hydrogen gas, the strain was further examined for bacterial identification. The selection of the best hydrogen-producing isolate was performed by batch-growth experiments in 30 ml serum bottles under anaerobic conditions, which was achieved by sparging the medium with pure nitrogen gas before the isolate was added. The incubation was performed at 37 °C for 24–48 h."
5,Identification of the bacteria,"2.4 Identification of the bacteria Characterisation and morphological determination of relevant isolates were performed according to Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (8th Edition). Colony characterisation was performed under light microscopy while Gram staining was performed to determine the morphological characteristics of the bacterial cells. The biochemical tests were performed to identify the species of selected isolates and using the BIOLOG Identification System (USA) based on the Gram staining results. The cultivation of the isolates on BIOLOG Universal Growth (BUG) agar followed BIOLOG instructions (MicroLog3 4.20.04) that included preparation of a standardised liquid suspension based on turbidity and inoculation into GP2 Microplates at 145 μl/well. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the microplate was analysed using the BIOLOG reader. The 16S rRNA molecular method was used to verify the BIOLOG results. The isolate was cultured in NB at 37 °C for 18 h prior to DNA extraction using a GF-1 bacterial DNA extraction kit (Vivantis, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The extract was suspended in 30 μl of TE buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA. The spacer region of the 16S rRNA genes was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′ [22]. The double-stranded PCR products were sent for DNA sequencing to First BASE Laboratories Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia). A BLAST search of the nucleotide sequences was conducted through the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Prior to phylogenetic analysis, alignments were generated using Clustal X. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method with Mega 5.02, and bootstrapping analysis for 1000 replicates was used to estimate the confidence of the tree topologies."
6,Serum bottle fermentation,"2.5 Serum bottle fermentation A modified malt yeast glucose (MYG) medium [23] was used in the fermentation and consisted of (in g/l): D(+)glucose, 10; yeast extract, 5; and malt extract, 10. The media was dispensed into a set of 30 ml serum bottles, and the headspace was replaced with nitrogen gas, which was purged for 10 min. Each bottle was capped with a rubber stopper and clamped with an aluminium cap before being inoculated with 10% v/v seed cultures. The seed cultures were prepared in MYG medium and serially sub-cultured two times prior to the initiation of the experiments. The cultures were incubated for 24 h at a constant rotational speed of 150 rpm. The initial culture pH was varied from pH 4 to pH 8 at 0.5-unit increments and incubation temperature ranged between 28 and 40 °C with 2 °C increments."
7,Batch fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor,"2.6 Batch fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor A 2 L LiFlus GX (BioTron, Korea) jacketed bioreactor with a 1.5 L working volume was employed for batch fermentation runs. The modified MYG medium was used as the fermentation medium with an initial pH of 6.5. The pH of the culture was not controlled during fermentation; however, pH changes were monitored. The metabolites, such as organic acids and alcohol, were measured during hydrogen evolution. Immediately after inoculation with 1% v/v seed culture of E. cloacae KBH3, the medium was sparged with nitrogen gas for 10 min to ensure anaerobic conditions were achieved. The operating temperature was maintained at 30 °C using a circulating water bath. Liquid and gaseous samples were collected periodically every 3 h for analysis of bacterial growth as well as biohydrogen and metabolite production."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods The bacterial growth was determined by measuring cell turbidity at 600 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601 PC, Japan) and converted to a cell dry-weight concentration using a standard curve. The volume of gas produced was recorded accordingly. For the serum bottle experiments, a syringe was inserted into the rubber cap to collect the gas, whereas in batch fermentation runs, the water displacement method was adopted. The composition of the biogas was analysed using gas chromatography (SRI 8600C, USA) with helium ionisation detector (HID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carrier gas of 99.99% helium (MOX, Malaysia) was fed at a flow rate of 25 ml/min. The pressure for the carrier gas was set to 5 psi, and temperatures for the injection port, detector and oven were maintained at 41 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C, respectively. The concentration of metabolites was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Agilent 1100, USA)."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Sampling of termites and isolation of bacteria,"3.1 Sampling of termites and isolation of bacteria The selection of termites as the source of hydrogen-producing bacteria was because termites have a unique ability to digest lignocellulosic biomass. This is because of the presence of a bacterial community inside the termite gut that is capable of hydrolysing complex lignocellulose components into monomeric sugars [21]. The presence of bacteria with a lignin degrading ability suggests the importance of the need for further research on these gut bacteria. Moreover, many current studies on alternative energy have focused on the utilisation of renewable resources, specifically lignocellulosic biomass [5,24]. Thus, the search for novel hydrogen-producing bacteria is now directed at the unique properties of waste decomposition with higher yields and better production rates [25]. Termites in palm plantation sites are usually found underneath and in piles of degrading palm fronds. In this study, the termites collected and identified belonged to the family of Globitermes sp., which represents one out of 175 species of termites known to exist in Peninsular Malaysia [26]. In this study, attempts to isolate a bacterial community from termite guts were performed by dissecting the termite and culturing the gut microflora in NB and RCM. From a series of sub-cultures and plating of the mixed cultures, six different isolates were successfully obtained. Four isolates were isolated from aerobic cultures (NAAE1, KBH3, NAAE3 and RCMAE1), and two isolates were acquired from anaerobic cultures (NAAN1 and KBH4) as shown in Table 1 . Colony characterisation was performed through physical observation using a light microscope with 4× magnification. This step was to differentiate bacteria according to differences in their colony characteristics on solid media [27]."
11,Screening and identification of hydrogen-producing bacterial isolates,"3.2 Screening and identification of hydrogen-producing bacterial isolates All six of the isolates were screened for hydrogen production through observation of biogas evolution during culture in NB and RCM media. Table 1 shows that of the isolates used for the screening process, only KBH3 and KBH4 showed biogas production. The BIOLOG System was employed for identification of KBH3 and KBH4. This system uses biochemical reactions to test and analyse a microorganism's ability to oxidise 95 different carbon sources [28]. The results represent a unique microorganism profile, which can be compared with known bacterial profiles in the Biolog database. From this study, the isolates KBH3 and KBH4 were successfully identified as E. cloacae and Clavibacter agropyri, respectively. The success of isolating these bacteria shows some similarity with previous studies [16], which worked with the termite Coptotermes curvignathus and isolated three bacteria, E. cloacae, C. agropyri and E. aerogenes, while studies by Adams and Boopathy [21] reported that E. cloacae and E. aerogenes have been successfully isolated from Coptotermes formosanus. The E. cloacae bacteria is Gram negative with a small rod-like shape [29]. A facultative anaerobe, E. cloacae could produce biohydrogen as well as formate, acetate, lactate and ethanol. Other notable hydrogen-producing members of this genus include E. aerogenes and Enterobacter asburiae SNU-1 [30]. However, C. agropyri is Gram positive, rod-shaped and a strict anaerobe [31]. This finding demonstrates the variability of microflora naturally living inside the termite gut. This mixture of facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes is possible because the termite gut is a well-aerated anaerobic gradient system where aerobic bacteria are also present [32]. Biochemical reaction profiles from BIOLOG show that E. cloacae and C. agropyri have demonstrated the ability to utilise different carbon sources. Table 2 listed the isolates' reactions to thirteen highlighted carbon sources which were predominantly produced during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials [33]. As reported by Borji et al. [34] and Deschamps et al. [35], E. cloacae is capable of digesting lignin and hemicellulose monomers, as well as phenolic compounds. This raises a possibility that the presence of this bacterium could assist the termite in breaking down the lignocellulosic materials consumed. To verify the BIOLOG findings, molecular techniques were used to confirm the identity of E. cloacae. These techniques included DNA extraction, amplification of the 16S rRNA gene through PCR, purification of the amplified product and DNA sequencing. The results show that KBH3 is identified as E. cloacae, and the recorded similarity of the 16S rRNA gene was 99% of 1224 bp with the accession number of GU979185.1 at the GenBank and NCBI databases. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and is presented in Fig. 1 . The cultivation profiles of E. cloacae in NB and C. agropyri in RCM for biohydrogen production are shown in Table 1. C. agropyri demonstrated greater biogas production when compared to E. cloacae. Nevertheless, E. cloacae showed a higher percentage of hydrogen in the biogas produced. In addition, E. cloacae KBH3 has a better variability of carbon source utilisation (Table 2), which is important if lignocellulosic biomass is being used as the main feedstock for hydrogen fermentation processes. Therefore, E. cloacae KBH3 was selected for further investigation in experiments where cultivation of the isolate was performed in 30 ml serum bottles to determine the environmental conditions for the best hydrogen yield. To facilitate increased hydrogen production, a modified MYG medium was used. This medium was selected because previous studies have reported that it is the best fermentative medium for hydrogen production by E. cloacae [29]."
12,Effects of temperature and initial pH on the growth of E. cloacae KBH3 and hydrogen production,"3.3 Effects of temperature and initial pH on the growth of E. cloacae KBH3 and hydrogen production To determine the effect of the environmental conditions (operating temperature and initial pH) on cell growth and hydrogen production, the media pH and incubation temperatures were alternately varied. Fig. 2 shows the effects of the culture conditions on growth and biohydrogen production in E. cloacae KBH3 when the bacterium was cultured in the modified MYG medium. The culture temperatures were observed to have an effect on hydrogen production and higher temperatures led to greater hydrogen yields (Fig. 2a). The maximum hydrogen yield of 0.895 mol H2/mol glucose was achieved at 30 °C. However, an increase in temperature beyond 30 °C lowers hydrogen production as only 0.294 mol H2/mol glucose evolved at 40 °C. This is less than half of the maximum yield, which further affirms the effect of operational temperature on hydrogen production. The same trend was observed with cell growth, and more rapid growth was observed at lower temperatures and the lowest cell turbidity was achieved at 40 °C, as opposed to the highest cell turbidity, which was observed at 30 °C. This implies that the temperature of 30 °C was optimal for high bacterial growth and hydrogen yield. This finding differs from previously reported results in the literature. Nath et al. [36] reported that the maximum rate of hydrogen production achieved by E. cloacae DM11 was at 37 °C. However, E. aerogenes HQ-39 and E. aerogenes E-82005 showed the best results at 38 °C and 40.5 °C, respectively [37]. Another study found 36 °C as the optimal temperature for hydrogen evolution by E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 [29]. One possible explanation for the lower optimal temperature is that this strain has adapted to live in the guts of termites; therefore, they have adapted to a temperature that is close to the host organism [13]. As hydrogen evolution by fermentative bacteria involves enzyme-catalysed reactions, increasing the temperature to the threshold value T opt should have a positive kinetic effect on the biocatalytic activity; at higher temperatures, either thermal inactivation of the enzyme controlling a fundamental metabolic pathway would occur or cell dysfunction would prevail, which was evident by the decreased hydrogen yield and growth shown in Fig. 2a [37]. Furthermore, when the temperature was raised over the critical limit, higher maintenance energy is needed to synthesise heat-shock proteins to maintain cell viability and replace deactivated enzymes [38]. Fig. 2b shows that E. cloacae KBH3 is able to grow and produce hydrogen when cultured in medium with an initial pH ranging from 4.5 to 8, although the highest growth was recorded at an initial pH of 6.5. Maximum hydrogen yield was obtained at an initial pH of 7 and produced 0.786 mol H2/mol glucose. The difference in optimal pH for growth and hydrogen production might be because growth of some enteric bacteria favours a slightly acidic environment [39]. However, at pH 4.5 and lower, hydrogen yield and cell growth were greatly affected. At pH 4, minimal growth and an absence of hydrogen production was recorded. In addition, the final pH at the end of fermentation falls within the range of 4.3–4.7, although the initial pH differed (data not shown). This phenomenon suggests that beyond a certain pH threshold, further growth is limited as well as major metabolic activities vital to the cell. It could also be the reason why hydrogen evolution was not possible at pH 4 for this bacterial isolate. The importance of the effects of pH is supported by Fabiano and Perego [37], where they concluded that the pH of the microenvironment could shift the ionisation state of the functional groups of enzymes involved in biocatalysis. For these enzymes, the ionisable groups in the active centre must be available in the proper ionic form to maintain optimum performance of the catalytic reactions [36]. It has also been documented that fatty acids are more toxic to the cell in the protonated form. When volatile fatty acids accumulate, the low pH environment in the medium promotes the protonation of the fatty acids. Hence, the bacteria will switch metabolism from hydrogen production to solventogenesis, which consumes electrons. Generally, the same range of optimal initial pH values was reported for other strains of Enterobacter sp. and other hydrogen-producing bacteria. These include E. asburiae SNU-1, which has a maximum hydrogen productivity at pH 7 [30], E. cloacae DM11 at pH 6.5 [36], Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 at pH 6.25 [24] and at pH 6.2 for a mixed culture [40]. Therefore, the optimal pH for achieving a rate of high hydrogen production is subject to a different variety of microorganisms."
13,Batch fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor,"3.4 Batch fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor The cell concentration and pH changes of E. cloacae KBH3 culture grown in a bioreactor are shown in Fig. 3 a. The pH of the culture was measured every 3 h throughout the 36 h fermentation period. As shown in the growth profile, the cells immediately entered the exponential growth phase and no lag phase was observed, possibly because active bacteria that were sub-cultured two times before inoculation into the bioreactor were used [17]. Another possible reason could be that the choice of medium's initial pH was 6.5, which was previously shown to maximize the growth of E. cloacae KBH3 and hydrogen production [29]. After 21 h of fermentation, the cells enter a stationary growth phase that persisted until the end of the fermentation period. The maximum specific growth rate of the fermentation process was determined to be 0.224 h−1. The pH profile shows a significant drop from 6.5 to 5.36 within the first 3 h. The decrease in pH is caused by organic acids accumulation as metabolic by-products. As the isolate is an enteric bacterium, the culture undergoes mixed-acid fermentation as the primary metabolic pathway (Fig. 4 ). During fermentation, lactate, acetate, ethanol and formate are produced as well as hydrogen and carbon dioxide [2,41]. Over time, the accumulation of acids inhibit bacterial growth [42]. This is due to the inability of the cell to maintain its internal pH, which also affects intracellular ATP levels [36]. As shown in Fig. 3a, the pH value during the stationary growth phase was 4.70, while at the end of batch study, the final pH was 4.66. Hydrogen production of the culture is shown in Fig. 3b. The hydrogen yield profile showed a consistent production with the growth of bacteria. Hydrogen was observed to be a growth-associated product because most of the gases were produced during the exponential phase. However, the gas continued to evolve during the stationary phase. This showed some similarity with previous research involving E. asburiae SNU-1 [30]. It is interesting to note that for other hydrogen-producing bacteria, such as Clostridium butyricum, hydrogen gas was only generated during the exponential phase. As the process enters the stationary growth phase, the metabolic pathway shifts towards solventogenesis, which no longer produces hydrogen [43]. However, in this study, the maximum production rate was achieved during the stationary growth phase of the culture and 180.74 ml H2/l/h (or 7.4 mmol H2/l/h) was evolved. In addition, the best cumulative hydrogen production recorded was 2404 ml H2/l at a hydrogen yield of 1.8 mol/mol glucose. This is significantly higher than the yield achieved during serum bottle experiments. One possible reason is that, in smaller working volumes the rapid pH drop of the culture would inhibits cell growth and hydrogen production more quickly than in bigger working volumes. Comparison of these results with previous findings is summarised in Table 3 . Fig. 3c illustrates the various metabolites produced over the batch fermentation period. At the third hour, only formate and ethanol were produced without any other type of organic acid or alcohol production. This metabolism is typical of mixed-acid fermentation of enteric bacteria where the production of a reduced organic compound (in this case ethanol) reoxidises NADH produced during the glycolytic production of pyruvate [25]. The increasing trend of formate production continued until the ninth hour, where a decrease in formate was observed, which was accompanied by lactic acid generation. Hydrogen production also increased to a rate of 161.48 ml H2/l/h (6.6 mmol H2/l/h). This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that when active metabolism occurs in the cell, it causes the pH to drop, which induced the enzyme formate-hydrogen lyase [25,48]. This enzyme catalysed the conversion of formate to hydrogen and carbon dioxide to lessen the acidification effect, which was indicated by the decreasing formate concentrations. Furthermore, acidic conditions also favour the increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate because only one molecule of acid was formed instead of two (acetate and formate). After 12 h of fermentation, acetate and butyrate were generated. This is surprising because the conventional metabolism of Enterobacter bacteria does not exhibit butyrate biosynthesis characteristics. Nevertheless, previous findings [49,50] have reported butyrate production by E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 and E. aerogenes, respectively. In addition, formate, lactate and ethanol concentrations increased at this point of fermentation. Formate concentrations reached its maximum level after 15 h, and comparing formate production with hydrogen production (Fig. 3b), it can be observed that hydrogen was still being produced. This implies that the formate pathway plays an important role in hydrogen production in E. cloacae KBH3, where a larger quantity of hydrogen was evolved through formate decomposition catalysed by formate hydrogen lyase [30]. Thus, the formate concentration began to reduce until none remained after 30 h. It is generally accepted that members of the Enterobacter genus generate hydrogen production by two routes, the formate and NADH pathways [8,25,29,30]. The latter evolves hydrogen through the reoxidation of NADH, which is catalysed by hydrogenase [51]. This can be observed because hydrogen production persisted after formate depletion. Nevertheless, previous research by Ntaikou et al. [7] and Nath and Das [9] stressed that the production of ethanol, butanediol, lactate and butyrate also involved the oxidation of NADH. Therefore, the production of these metabolites would reduce hydrogen production. However, acetate biosynthesis did not consume NADH cofactors for its regeneration. Furthermore, the acetate pathway is important for the microbial cell because it provides the ATP necessary for the energy requirements of the cell [52]. However, high concentrations of soluble metabolites, including acetate, butyrate and ethanol, would eventually inhibit bacterial growth and fermentative hydrogen production [53]. Therefore, it is interesting to note that the hydrogen production rate reached a maximum value (180.74 ml H2/l/h) at the time when lactate and acetate recorded the highest concentrations, with butyrate also at a similarly high level. Previous findings [54] have shown a positive correlation between butyrate and hydrogen production, which supported our results. The ethanol concentration recorded at this point had slightly decreased compared to earlier measured points, which in theory will increase NADH availability in the medium and more hydrogen will be produced."
14,Conclusion,"Six bacterial isolates were successfully isolated from the guts of termites, and two isolates, E. cloacae KBH3 and C. agropyri KBH4, were shown to produce hydrogen through anaerobic fermentation. Conventional and molecular methods were employed to determine the identities of the hydrogen-producing isolates. E. cloacae appeared to be a potential candidate for hydrogen production due to its capacity to use various types of carbon sources and high hydrogen content. The operating temperature and initial pH played an important role in hydrogen production by E. cloacae KBH3, and the optimal temperature of 30 °C and an initial pH of 7 were recorded. Formate produced by this bacterium is subsequently consumed in the reaction for hydrogen production, while the NADH pathway plays an important role once formate is depleted. Batch fermentation runs at 30 °C, and an initial pH of 6.5 with a substrate concentration of 10 g/l resulted in a maximum hydrogen production of 7.4 mmol H2/l/h."
