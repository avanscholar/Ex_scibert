0,Introduction,"Biofuel production has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a tool to reverse greenhouse gas emissions and address depletion of natural resources (Crocamo et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2020; Ghimire et al., 2015a). Biofuels can be obtained through several biological processes, including anaerobic digestion, dark fermentation, and photofermentation (Ferraro et al., 2018, 2019; Luongo et al., 2019). Among them, photofermentation (PF) is certainly one of the most promising alternatives (Sağır, 2019), due to its potential sustainability, environmentally friendly characteristics, and the high value of the resulting product. PF is a biological process conducted by specific anaerobic facultative species, named purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB). In the presence of light and absence of molecular oxygen and nitrogen, PNSB are able to convert a wide range of organic substrates to hydrogen. In addition, PNSB can store, within their own cytoplasm, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a promising candidate for the production of totally biodegradable plastic materials (Gouda et al., 2001), perfectly fitting the biorefinery concept. The accumulation of PHB and the production of hydrogen are generally competitive metabolic pathways (Kim et al., 2012), although recent studies have shown that, under specific growth conditions, these two pathways can coexist (Ghimire et al., 2016; Hari et al., 2019; Luongo et al., 2017). We currently lack a complete understanding of the complex metabolism of PNSB and the consequent pathways that can be followed during the life of PNSB under different environmental and feed conditions. This aspect is crucial when the bioconversion begins with organic waste and the PNSB consortium is composed of mixed cultures. Most studies on PF, in fact, have been conducted using synthetic substrates and/or pure cultures (Hakobyan et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2012). A few recent studies have described the possibility of using low-cost waste materials for the photofermentation of mixed cultures (Hari et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019). However, many other organic wastes could be considered as valuable sources of feedstock for the process. A significant example is provided by winery wastewater (WWW), which is the major waste stream resulting from wine production. Every year, about 270 million hectoliters (hL) of wine are produced worldwide (Aurand, 2018). The produced effluent contains various by-products, including ethanol, sugars, organic acids, and several phenolic compounds (Ioannou et al., 2015). Due to its high organic content, WWW is a potential source of contamination if not correctly managed (Chatzilazarou et al., 2010). On the other hand, it can be sustainably valorized through PF. Indeed, the organic molecules contained in WWW, such as alcohols and sugars (all rapidly available), represent a suitable source of carbon for PNSB. Nonetheless, PF of WWW presents some challenges due to the presence of toxic compounds, such as phenols, and the dark color of the waste, which negatively affects the penetration of light in the bioreactor (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012; Tawfik et al., 2014). Only a few recent studies have been conducted on WWW conversion to hydrogen via dark fermentation (Buitrón et al., 2019; Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2019). Otherwise, the single-stage photofermentation process using pure or mixed PNSB consortia has never been tested in previous studies. The main objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the applicability of PF to WWW. The aims of the study are to add to our knowledge of the metabolic pathways that PNSB undergo in the presence of non-synthetic substrates and to address the abovementioned challenges (toxicity, color) in order to optimize the production of valuable compounds. The most relevant aspects of the study relate not only to the utilization of a waste material that has not yet been tested through the PF process, but also to the adoption of mixed cultures of PNSB (for scaling-up purposes) and to the analysis of the metabolic pathways that allow for the concomitant production of hydrogen and PHB. The study is performed under various feed conditions and tests different nitrogen sources and feeding chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations. In the case of waste biomass, in fact, one of the most frequent problems is the lack or incorrect distribution of macro- and micronutrients (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012; Ghosh et al., 2017). In particular, the type and concentration of nitrogen in the medium strongly influence the activity of nitrogenase, which is the key enzyme for hydrogen production. Similarly, the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affects the metabolic pathway (Ghimire et al., 2016). High COD values lead to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and to the consequent decrease of pH, which is responsible for process inhibition (Tawfik et al., 2014). All of these aspects affecting hydrogen and PHB generation have been taken into account during the experiments. These observations assume a relative value when real substrates and mixed consortia are used, as the combination of mixed consortia and substrate-related microorganisms may lead to competitive or synergistic behaviors during nutrient conversion. For instance, Luongo et al. (2017) demonstrated that greater hydrogen production can be achieved by mixed PNSB consortia than by a pure Rodobacter sphaeroides culture using the dark fermentation effluent as photofermentation feedstock. Indeed, the present study mainly focuses on the reliability of the photofermentative conversion of WWW instead of the specific metabolic assimilation of each nutrient during the process. The obtained results constitute an important beginning step for real-scale valorization of WWW by PF."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials WWW was obtained from a farm located in San Gregorio Magno (southern Italy) that produces white wine. Immediately after sampling, WWW was carefully characterized (Table 1 ) and stored under dark conditions at −20 °C to maintain its initial unaltered characteristics during the different PF experiments. As suggested by several authors (Eroğlu et al., 2008; Padovani et al., 2013; Seifert et al., 2010), WWW was diluted prior its use so that the feeding load was kept under inhibiting threshold values. WWW was diluted using an organic carbon-free culture medium and a specific trace element solution, prepared according to Ghimire et al. (2015b). In detail, 10 mL volume of trace element solution was added to each L of culture medium. Bi-distilled water was used to prepare both the medium and the trace element solution. Differently from other investigations (Eroğlu et al., 2004; Padovani et al., 2013), no other pretreatment was used to reduce the COD content or to limit the initial total phenolic content. Due to the natural acidity of WWW, the pH of the culture medium was neutralized by fixing the initial pH to 7 with a 1 M KOH solution. PNSB inoculum was sampled from a mixed-culture PF reactor operating at laboratory scale and fed with a synthetic wastewater rich in organic acids. Before use, the inoculum was reactivated using a synthetic glucose-based medium, and 5 mL from the previous reactor was used to inoculate the new one. Due to the high inoculum dilution, each reactor was quite transparent on day 0. During the fermentation time, PNSB growth conferred a bright red color to the reactors, which is typical for the PF process. The chemicals used for all analytical determinations were of high purity. Only bi-distilled water was employed as the reagent water. Before each use, the glassware was soaked overnight in a concentrated nitric acid bath (2% v/v) and rinsed several times with bi-distilled water."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Experiments were conducted at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) and under non-sterile conditions, using 400 mL glass reactors equipped with tubing on the top for sampling and gas extraction. Tubing was also used to flush the headspace with argon gas for 20 min, thereby ensuring anaerobic conditions and completely removing nitrogen gas. The reactors were placed on magnetic mixers, with the rotation speed adjusted to 250 rpm to maintain completely stirred tank conditions. Light was continuously provided by flexible LED strips placed all around the bioreactors (4000 lux). Eight sets of experiments were carried out to evaluate PF process performance with varied initial dilutions (H = high dilution, L = low dilution) and therefore initial COD concentrations (1500 mg L−1 and 3000 mg L−1). Different nitrogen sources were used, i.e., sodium glutamate (organic nitrogen, ON), ammonium chloride (ammonia nitrogen, AN), sodium nitrate (nitric nitrogen, NN), and endogenous nitrogen (EN), as reported in Table 2 . Total nitrogen (TN) concentration was fixed at 2.79 mM of N for all experiments conducted using an external nitrogen source. Because of the adopted dilution, however, the experiments conducted using only the endogenous nitrogen source were characterized by initial TN concentrations of 0.22 mM for the higher dilution case (H-EN) and 0.43 mM for lower dilution case (L-EN). Each set was carried out in triplicate. H experiments lasted 16 days and L experiments lasted 24 days, depending on the feeding conditions. Tests were concluded when no more variations were detected in terms of hydrogen production and organic acids (OAs) concentration. Every two days, liquid and gaseous samples were collected for quantitative and qualitative analysis."
4,Analytical methods and instruments,"2.3 Analytical methods and instruments Gas production was quantified through water displacement. H2 and CO2 contents were determined by gas chromatographic analysis conducted using a Varian Star 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a ShinCarbon ST 80/100 column and a thermal conductivity detector, with argon as the carrier gas. OAs, sugars, and ethanol concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) LC 25 Chromatography Oven equipped with a Metrohom (Herisau, Switzerland) Organic Acids column (Metrosep Organic Acids - 250/7.8). In detail, two different detectors were used: a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) UVD 340U for VFA determination and a Jasco (Cremella, Italy) RI-2031 for ethanol and sugar detection. The eluent (1 mM H2SO4) was pumped at a constant rate of 0.7 mL min−1 using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) GD 500 Gradient Pump. The PHB concentration was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Toward this aim, the samples were preliminarily lyophilized, and the polymers were extracted according to Oehmen et al. (2005). Gas chromatographic analysis and mass spectrometry were conducted using a GC-MS with a ZB SemiVolatiles Zebron column (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas. Biomass growth was quantified by measuring the optical density (OD) at 660 nm referenced to the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration with a standard correlation curve. A WTW photoLab (Wheilheim, Germany) spectrophotometer (6600 UV-VIS) was utilized for the optical density determination. COD concentration was obtained by colorimetric analysis according to standard methods (APHA, 2005). Total phenolic content was measured following the Folin and Ciocalteu Method (Pontoni et al., 2017). N–NH4 + and TKN concentrations were measured by distillation and titration (APHA, 2005). The distillation was performed using a UDK 132 VELP (Usmate Velate, Italy) distiller. H2SO4 was used for titration. NO3 −, PO4 3−, and SO4 2− concentrations were measured by ion chromatography, using a Metrohm 761 Compact Ion Chromatograph (Herisau, Switzerland) equipped with a Dionex IonPac AS12A 4 × 200 mm column (Sunnyvale, USA). Light intensity was checked using a Lutron-LX-107 light meter (Coopersburg, USA), and pH was measured using a Hanna pH meter (Limena, Italy)."
5,Results,
6,Organic nitrogen source,"3.1 Organic nitrogen source Fig. 1 a–f illustrates the time-course profiles of the parameters monitored during the tests conducted in the presence of ON for the two tested dilutions (1500 mg L−1 and 3000 mg L−1). For both experimental conditions (days 0–2), WWW was subject to catabolic and anabolic reactions according to kinetic models describing bacterial degradation of glucose and organics in anaerobic environments (Maharaj et al., 2019, 2018). Indeed, during glucose consumption, the contextual production of acetic acid and hydrogen (catabolic reactions) and the accumulation of the biomass (anabolic reactions) were observed. For the three successive days (days 2–5), no hydrogen production was detected. During this time, ethanol and acetic acid were degraded and used for the biomass growth and the PHB accumulation. Over the fifth day, hydrogen production started once more. In this period, hydrogen was the main fermentation by-product. Moreover, formic acid was produced. For the set H-ON, the concentration of formic acid increased from day 5 to day 12 and then was constant until the end of the process. In contrast, for the set L-ON, the production of formic acid increased until day 21. Moreover, for the L-ON reactors, a relevant amount of acetic acid was produced from day 10 to day 16. Residual amounts of ethanol and acetic acid were detected in the final effluent. No differences between the two tested conditions were observed in terms of biomass growth and PHB accumulation. In both cases, in fact, the biomass reached a concentration of about 1.5 gTSS·L−1, with a slightly increasing trend at the end of the process corresponding to PHB depletion."
7,Ammonia nitrogen source,"3.2 Ammonia nitrogen source Fig. 2 summarizes the results of the tests conducted in the presence of AN. Set H-AN revealed an interesting aspect related to nitrogen assimilation by the PNSB consortium. In fact, the use of AN in the presence of more diluted WWW avoided any formic acid production during the process. Substrate consumption led directly to hydrogen, acetic acid, and PHB production during the first six days. No PHB accumulation was detected from day 6 to day 11, and no hydrogen was produced after day 8. In the presence of the less diluted WWW (set L-AN), the substrate was instead converted to acetic acid, hydrogen, and biomass during the first two days of fermentation (days 0–2). Furthermore, no H2 production was observed from day 2 until day 6, ethanol and acetic acid were depleted, and the carbon was stored in the form of PHB. Past the seventh day, hydrogen, formic acid, and acetic acid were the main fermentation by-products. As observed in the reactors operated with ON (set L-ON), ethanol was not completely depleted in the case of set L-AN. A residual concentration of formic acid and acetic acid was measured in the final effluent. The biomass concentration reached a final value of about 1.5 gTSS·L−1, also in the presence of AN. During the last days of fermentation, the biomass growth was again associated with PHB consumption."
8,Nitric nitrogen source,"3.3 Nitric nitrogen source Fig. 3 summarizes the results of the tests conducted in the presence of NN. According to the obtained results, for both tested conditions during the first days (days 0–2), the substrate was principally converted to acetic, lactic, and formic acids and hydrogen. Acids were successively depleted and converted to hydrogen and PHB. In the presence of higher substrate concentrations (set L-NN), lactic and formic acids were produced again during the process, and ethanol was not completely consumed at the end of the test. Hydrogen production occurred for a much longer time for the L reactors. Biomass growth rates were slower than for the other experimental tests. The TSS value remained quite constant (around 0.5 g L−1) during the whole process for the case of set H-NN. A further increase after day 18 was observed instead for the case of set L-NN corresponding to PHB degradation. The final biomass concentration of 0.9 g L−1 was reached. It is worth noting that the nitrogen source used in the experiment led to the production of 22 ± 4 mL L−1 of N2 for both sets during the first 10 days of fermentation (data not shown)."
9,Endogenous nitrogen source,"3.4 Endogenous nitrogen source Fig. 4 a–c reports the results obtained in the presence of EN. As the endogenous nitrogen content of set H-EN limited the bacterial growth, resulting in low biomass yields, no hydrogen production or PHB accumulation was detected (data not shown). Therefore, Fig. 4a–c refers only to set L-EN. As it can be observed, the ethanol concentration remained constant from days 7–16, while acetic acid was converted to hydrogen and formic acid. During days 16–20, ethanol was depleted and converted to hydrogen, formic acid, and acetic acid. Over successive days until the end of the process, no more hydrogen or acid production was observed. Differently from the other tests, in this case, a very low amount of ethanol was used as a carbon source by microorganisms. A very low TSS value and PHB concentration were observed, suggesting that the substrate was principally used for catabolic reactions."
10,Discussion,
11,Substrate utilization and biomass growth,"4.1 Substrate utilization and biomass growth Substrate consumption was conditioned by the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) phenomenon. CCR takes place when a microbial consortium has access to a mixture of carbon sources, and in such a situation, the consortium may exhibit a selective pattern of substrate utilization. The presence of a preferred substrate prevents the use of other carbon sources, giving rise to CCR (Brückner and Titgemeyer, 2002; Deutscher, 2008; Ghosh et al., 2017; Görke and Stülke, 2008). Glucose, which is the simplest carbohydrate, is the principal carbon catabolite repressor (Görke and Stülke, 2008). The obtained data are in line with the mentioned studies on CCR, and in the presence of WWW, PNSB showed a higher assimilation rate with glucose than with ethanol. Indeed, during all tests, glucose was totally consumed during the first few days of fermentation and was principally converted to hydrogen and acetic acid. Subsequently, the biomass had to adapt to other, more complex, carbon sources. The new situation corresponded to a stress condition for the microorganisms, causing them to shift their metabolism to PHB accumulation. During the last days of fermentation, bacteria depleted the stored PHB and utilized it for their growth. In accordance with the feast-famine theory (Johnson et al., 2009), PNSB used PHB as a carbon reserve for their growth and survival when the substrate and/or the other nutrients became scarce (Ghimire et al., 2016; Luongo et al., 2017). Correspondingly, the lowest tested nitrogen concentration (set L-IN) resulted in the lowest biomass concentration, in agreement with previous findings (Waligórska et al., 2009). The highest TSS content, reached in sets H-ON, L-ON, H-AN, and L-AN, indicated that the most suitable nitrogen sources for biomass growth were organic and ammonia nitrogen, whereas low biomass growth was observed instead when nitrates were used as a nitrogen source. The highest COD removal, obtained for the set H-NN (Table 3 ), was comparable with levels reported in previous PF studies conducted using mixed cultures (Ghimire et al., 2016). At the same time, the removal was generally higher compared to studies conducted using pure cultures (Ghimire et al., 2016; Montiel-Corona et al., 2015). The lower level of COD removal obtained for reactors operating with AN and ON was attributed to the self-shading condition that occurred during the experiments. Indeed, the higher biomass growth observed under these conditions led to a higher TSS concentration, which negatively affected light penetration inside the reactors (Montiel-Corona et al., 2015). In addition, the reduced performance in terms of COD removal associated with L reactors compared to H reactors was likely due to the accumulation of organic acids. This is in agreement with previous studies (Ghimire et al., 2016; Tawfik et al., 2014) that reported a similar behavior in the presence of mixed cultures. More than the other acids, formic acid seemed to be resistant to biotransformation. The concentration of this by-product principally increased when the microorganisms adopted the hydrogen production pathway. Moreover, it was detected in the effluent of the L reactors, although the residual formic acid concentration was lower (about 50%) in the presence of AN and NN (sets L-AN and L-NN) than in the presence of ON or EN (sets L-ON and L-EN). In comparison, the formic acid concentration in the effluent of the H experimental sets was very low in the presence of ON and totally absent in the presence of AN and NN. This result was in agreement with previous studies (Androga et al., 2011), attesting that the higher the ON concentration used for bacteria growth, the greater the production of formic acid during the fermentation process. In addition, the present study revealed that the higher the initial COD concentration used for the fermentation tests, the greater the production of formic acid observed in the effluents. Moreover, inorganic nitrogen compounds act as inhibiting agents in formic acid production."
12,Hydrogen production and PHB accumulation,"4.2 Hydrogen production and PHB accumulation In the present study, the adopted nitrogen source strongly affected hydrogen production and PHB accumulation. In detail, the utilization of ON led to the greatest hydrogen yields, which agrees with the assessment of previous studies that glutamate utilization stimulates hydrogen production (Oh et al., 2004; Reungsang et al., 2018). A slightly lower value was reached in the presence of AN. Nevertheless, the value was still not negligible. In fact, NH4+ is the principal inhibitor of the nitrogenase enzyme (Akköse et al., 2009; Drepper et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2012; Yakunin and Hallenbeck, 1998), which, in the presence of relevant nitrogen concentrations, can act as hydrogen consuming instead of hydrogen producing (Tawfik et al., 2014). Seifert et al. (2010) determined that a NH4 + concentration of 1.7 mM completely inhibits hydrogen generation in the presence of a pure culture of PNSB. Similarly, Özgür et al. (2010) observed the complete inhibition of a pure PNSB culture during hydrogen production from substrates characterized by high AN content (2 mM of NH4 +). In both cases, the NH4 + concentration was lower than those tested in the present study, suggesting that the synergistic behavior of different bacterial species, coexisting in the tested mixed consortium, had a beneficial effect on substrate utilization. This allowed for the bioconversion of a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic compounds (Ghimire et al., 2016). The lowest level of hydrogen production was observed in the presence of NN. In this case, the presence of N2 in the produced gas (data not shown) suggested that the mixed PNSB consortium mainly acted as denitrifying bacteria, converting nitrates to molecular nitrogen. Indeed, several authors (Costa et al., 2017; Cross et al., 2001) showed the possibility of using pure cultures of PNSB for NO3 removal from wastewater. In the presence of N2, the nitrogenase enzyme catalyzes nitrogen fixation, producing an amount of hydrogen that is four times lower than the amount produced under nitrogen-deficient conditions (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010; Rupprecht et al., 2006). Consequently, in the presence of NN, hydrogen production was scarce. The initial COD concentration had a reduced effect on hydrogen production compared to the nitrogen source. As expected (Pattanamanee et al., 2012; Yetis et al., 2000), an increasing C/N ratio enhanced hydrogen production. The only exception occurred in experiments conducted with glutamate as the nitrogen source. This was probably due to the very peculiar metabolic pathway followed by the biomass in this situation, leading to the concurrent production of H2 and PHB, as detailed below. A relevant result was the high hydrogen content (about 90%) in the produced gas obtained for all tested conditions. Very low amounts of CO2 were generated by PF of WWW compared to preliminary investigations carried out on synthetic wastewater with the same PNSB consortium (data not shown). Notably, hydrogen production was not inhibited by the phenolic content of the substrate, even in the less diluted WWW, a countertrend from several previous studies conducted with pure PNSB cultures. For example, Eroğlu et al. (2004) observed that PF of olive mill wastewater performed by Rhodobacter Sphaeroides O.U.001 was completely inhibited by a phenol content of 5.8 mg L−1. The phenol content was lower than the one resulting in the less diluted WWW used in the present study (6.38 mg L−1). The positive obtained result was attributed to the beneficial effect of the mixed PNSB culture. The maximum obtained value of hydrogen production was comparable to the one reported by Kars and Alparslan (2013) during the PF of sugar beet molasses operated by a pure culture of Rhodhobacter sphaeroides O.U.001. On the other hand, the probable absence of specific PHB-accumulating species in the adopted PNSB consortium did not allow a high PHB concentration to be obtained (Montiel-Corona et al., 2015). The highest PHB accumulation values were lower than those found in previous studies using a pure culture of Rodhobacter sphaeroides AV1 but were comparable to those obtained using mixed cultures and synthetic wastewater (Luongo et al., 2017). Lower PHB concentrations were detected in L tests. In particular, the lowest value was obtained in set L-EN, characterized by the minimum nitrogen content. Such a result indicated that the bioconversion was mainly driven to the hydrogen production pathway whenever the C/N ratio was sufficiently high. In this situation, a similar PHB accumulation was detected when changing the nitrogen source. In contrast, when the C/N ratio was low, the use of an ON source considerably enhanced PHB accumulation, in agreement with previous findings (Khatipov et al., 1998). Generally, PHB accumulation occurred together with acetic acid consumption, confirming that the presence of acetic acid stimulated PHB accumulation (Khatipov et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2012; Pattanamanee et al., 2012). As reported by other authors (Wu et al., 2012), the different metabolic routes of substrate assimilation strongly affect PHB formation. The metabolic route of acetate provides accessible ways to generate acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main precursor for PHB synthesis in the majority of PNSB. The maximum PHB accumulation and the maximum hydrogen yield occurred in the same experimental set (H-ON), despite the negative correlation reported in the scientific literature (Hustede et al., 1993; Khatipov et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2012). Indeed, both H2 production and PHB accumulation require a reduction in power. As a consequence, H2 production and PHB synthesis are competitive metabolic pathways. Usually, PHB synthesis occurs when microorganisms are forced to live under starvation. Consequently, when a large amount of the organic substrate is available, the metabolic pathway principally leads to hydrogen production. When the depletion of organic substrate occurs, PNSB store PHB as a carbon reserve. Nonetheless, the result was in agreement with recent findings (Ghimire et al., 2016; Luongo et al., 2017; Montiel-Corona et al., 2015) that PHB accumulation can be induced along with H2 production when complex substrates are utilized. PHB provides different functions for PNSB; one of them is to protect bacteria from stress. A stress condition can be represented not only by carbon source scarcity but also by other nonoptimal environmental conditions (e.g., temperature or pH fluctuation, osmotic shock). In this study, after glucose depletion, the biomass spontaneously adapted to other carbon sources. Under this condition, the PHB synthesis prioritized the reduced power, despite substrate availability. Subsequently, the PHB synthesis prevented bacteria from experiencing the stress condition and retained H2 production. Wu et al. (2012) also reported that, under nonoptimal pH conditions, the PHB synthesis was beneficial to H2 productivity, preventing the species Rhodopseudomonas Palustris WP3-5 from the stress of inappropriate pH and retaining H2 productivity at an optimal pH value. It is worth noting that nitrate resulted in the most effective nitrogen source for PHB accumulation. In fact, considering the maximum PHB accumulation of cells rather than the maximum PHB concentration in the reactors, the highest value was obtained in the presence of nitrate. Indeed, the TSS concentration was about three times lower in the NN set compared to the ON and AN sets. However, further experiments are required to better clarify the relationship between nitric nitrogen and the metabolic pathways leading to PHB accumulation, focusing on the evaluation of the PHB percentage of the dry cell weight. Due to the large amounts of WWW produced worldwide and the possibility of coupling high-purity hydrogen production with PHB accumulation, it is important to conduct both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale experiments for product valorization. Moreover, the description and use of mathematical models that are able to account for all metabolic activities occurring in photobioreactors needs to be further investigated, as this can help in designing and managing operations for real-scale applications (D'Acunto et al., 2018; Frunzo et al., 2019). The optimization of the PF process applied to WWW can lead to a more productive biorefinery system rather than the regular dark fermentation application (Buitrón et al., 2019; Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2019)."
13,Conclusions,"This experimental study demonstrated that winery wastewater can be profitably used for hydrogen and PHB production through the single-stage PF. The utilization of mixed PNSB cultures is beneficial in terms of substrate utilization and hydrogen production yields, even in the presence of inhibiting ammonia and polyphenols concentration in the waste. On the other hand, to reach high COD removal efficiency and correctly manage the waste, it is necessary to use the proper initial dilution. Moreover, the formic acid concentration must be limited, as it has been shown to be resistant to biotransformation. To address this issue, the utilization of inorganic nitrogen compounds is suggested. Finally, glutamate has been revealed to enhance both PHB accumulation and hydrogen production, which means that hydrogen and PHB production are intricately related and do not simply compete for electrons and energy distribution."
