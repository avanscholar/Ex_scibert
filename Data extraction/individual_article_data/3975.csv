0,Introduction,"Binary mixtures of water and ethanol are extensively used in biochemistry [1–4] and display interesting non-ideal properties [5,6]. Biomolecules are often studied in aqueous solutions of alcohols like ethanol [7,8], owing to amphipathic nature of their interactions [6,9]. Ethanol-water mixtures have been utilized in analysis of stability as well as structural and dynamical attributes of several enzymes [10,11], peptides [12] and proteins like lysozyme [13,14], myoglobin [15] and HP-36 [16]. Ethanol-peptide interactions and slower diffusion of solvent, both ethanol and water molecules near the peptide surface have been observed in a combined nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of an octapeptide dissolved in aqueous ethanol solution [17]. It has been suggested in some studies [18,19] that halogenated alcohols have greater potency for affecting secondary protein-structure, than aliphatic alcohols like ethanol. Ethanol is recurrently compared with one of its fluorinated analogues viz. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, which is used as a cosolvent in aqueous solutions of peptides and proteins [20–22] due to its concentration dependent effects like secondary structure stabilization [23,24], helix induction [25,26] and denaturation [27]. Since different force fields have been developed for trifluoroethanol [28–30], Gerig [21] has recently compared some of them to determine which model appropriately describes interactions of TFE with the peptide [val5]angiotensin in its aqueous solution. Water-ethanol [31–36] and water-TFE mixtures [37–41] have been the subject of extensive research in recent years and are often contrasted in terms of hydrogen bonding network [42], solution composition [43,44], thermodynamic [45] and dynamical properties [46]. Clustering tendency of alcohol molecules in their aqueous solution, has been seen to be more pronounced for TFE than ethanol owing to cooperative action of three fluorine atoms [43]. In numerous studies [24,47–50], it has been proposed that trifluoroethanol not only possesses extra acidity and hydrophobicity relative to ethanol, but also has heightened H-bond donor capacity and lower ability of H-bond acceptance. Matsugami and coworkers [42] have also recently compared hydrogen bonding characteristics of aqueous solutions of these two alcohols. Rajan and Balaram [24] have discussed that trifluoroethanol's unequal H-bond donor-acceptor character enables nearly exclusive hydrogen bonding to peptide carbonyl without disrupting intramolecular peptide hydrogen bonds while ethanol may interact with both carbonyl and amide groups interfering with peptide-peptide interaction. Fioroni and coworkers [9] have compared the solvation and dynamic behaviour of a tetrapeptide in water-TFE/ethanol solutions where it is seen that TFE prefers to solvate the peptide at the cost of water-peptide contacts in water-TFE mixtures, whereas, whereas ethanol may or may not affect aqueous solvation of the peptide, depending on its concentration in the solution. Values of transfer free energy of a peptide group from water to aqueous ethanol/TFE solutions have been calculated through different routes by Shimizu et al. [26]. They have proposed that the values are influenced by excluded volume effects in case of aqueous ethanol but depend on concentration as well as solvation of the peptide in presence of TFE-bound side chains in aqueous trifluoroethanol solution. Since N-methylacetamide (NMA) is frequently studied as a model peptide [51,52], it is intriguing to explore variation of its interactions with aqueous ethanol/TFE solutions. In an earlier study of water-NMA-methanol mixture, Chowdhuri et al. [53] have observed higher preference of NMA to interact with water than methanol. Experimentally determined values of excess enthalpy by Pikkarainen [54,55] have been found to be more negative for NMA-TFE binary mixtures than for NMA-ethanol, suggesting predominance of TFE-carbonyl interaction in the former mixture. It has also been proposed that contributions from disruption of hydrogen bonding between similar molecules (amide-amide and ethanol-ethanol) as well as ethanol-carbonyl interactions may counterbalance each other. Ab-initio calculations by Guo and Karplus [56] have revealed that NMA dimer hydrogen bonds are stabilised due to cooperative effects of trifluoroethanol molecules. NMA-ethanol-water ternary mixtures have been experimentally probed by Zielkiewicz [57,58] through measurements of excess volume, total vapour pressure and ternary vapour-liquid equilibrium. IR and NMR techniques employed by Takamuku et al. [59] for scrutiny of solvation properties of NMA in aqueous solutions of ethanol and TFE, point at enhanced hydrophobic solvation of NMA methyl groups by fluoroalkyl groups than ethyl groups. However, the solvation structure and dynamical properties of N-methylacetamide in aqueous solvent environment containing EtOH/TFE have not been studied theoretically in detail. In this work, we have studied the effect of addition of ethanol or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol in aqueous environment of N-methylacetamide (NMA). We have carried out series of molecular dynamics simulations of ∼1.13 m (mol/kg) aqueous NMA solutions with varying concentration of alcohols, ranging from pure water to 14.232 m alcoholic solution. The primary goal is to investigate the effect of two different alcohols (EtOH/TFE) on the hydrogen bonding structure and dynamics of aqueous NMA solution. We have calculated the number and energies of NMA–water, water–water, alcohol–water and NMA–alcohol hydrogen bonds along with their hydrogen-bond lifetime, and structural relaxation times with varying concentrations of alcohols. We have also provided the details of the translational and rotational dynamics of these molecules in these solutions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the models and simulation details. In Section 3.1, we present the solvation structure and hydrogen bond properties of aqueous-NMA-alcohol solution. The lifetime and structural relaxation time of hydrogen bonds are presented in Section 3.2. The self-diffusion coefficients and orientational relaxation times of associated molecules are discussed in Section 3.3, whereas our conclusions are summarized in Section 4."
1,Models and simulation details,"In the present work, NMA, water and alcohol molecules are characterized by the multisite interaction models. In these models, the interaction between atomic sites of two molecules is expressed as (1) u r ij = 4 ε ij σ ij r ij 12 − σ ij r ij 6 + q i q j r ij where, q i is the charge of the i-th atom or ion. The Lennard-Jones parameters σ ij and ε ij are obtained by using the combination rules σ ij = σ i σ j and ε ij = ε i ε j , where σ i and ε i are the Lennard-Jones diameter and well-depth parameter for i-th atom. We have used OPLS potential parameters for NMA [60] and the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) potential [61] for water. The EtOH molecules are modeled by Jorgenson et al. [62] which comprises of two methyl groups, one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group. The bond lengths and bond angles of COH and CCO are kept constant and the trans geometry of ethanol is used for this simulation. For TFE, we have used a seven site interaction model described by Fioroni et al. [29]. The methyl-group in NMA and EtOH, and the –CH2 − group in EtOH and TFE is considered to be a single interaction site and thus the hydrogen atoms in these groups are not considered here explicitly. The rigid geometry and the values of the potential parameters q i , σ i , and ε i for NMA, water and alcohols are taken from the literatures [60–62], and also summarized in Table 1 . The molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in a cubic box with a total of 490 particles of water and alcohol (either EtOH or TFE) along with 10 trans N-methylacetamide molecules. The simulations were performed at 308K with six different concentrations of alcoholic solution, ranging from pure water to 14.232 m (mol/kg) concentrated solution of EtOH or TFE. We have employed the minimum image convention for calculation of the short-range Lennard-Jones interactions. The long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the Ewald method [63] and, for the integration over time; we adapted the leap-frog algorithm with time step of 10−15 s (1fs). In the starting configuration, the NMA and solvent molecules were located on a face-centered-cubic lattice with random orientations of solvent molecules. To find the appropriate box size for a desired pressure at 308K, we first carried out MD runs of 0.8–1ns at a constant pressure of 0.1MPa by employing the weak coupling scheme of Berendsen et al. [64]. During this initial phase of the simulations, the volume of the simulation box was allowed to fluctuate, and the average volume was determined at the end of the simulation. It is observed that the box-length (L) changes from 25.138Å in case of aqueous NMA to 28.174Å and 29.07Å for highly concentrated (14.232 m) solution of ethanol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, respectively. Subsequently, we carried out simulations in microcanonical ensemble keeping the box size fixed at the average value (obtained previously) and each system was equilibrated for 1.6–2.0ns, and for the calculation of the structural and dynamical quantities the simulations were run for another 4–5ns. The average values of pressure of a system during the production phase of each simulation were found to be close to desired pressure P =0.1±0.4MPa. As per the above described models, we have calculated the density of water-TFE as well as water-EtOH binary mixtures up to desired concentration, i.e., Xalcohol =0.2 (mole-fraction of alcohol) and found results at 298K are in good agreement with experimental data [46,65], as shown in Fig. 1 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Solvation structure and hydrogen bond properties,"3.1 Solvation structure and hydrogen bond properties The influence of alcohol (EtOH/TFE) on the local structural properties of aqueous NMA solution are characterized by various NMA-water and NMA-alcohol pair correlation functions. It is observed that concentrated solution of Ethanol/TFE has significant effects on the amide-water interactions as shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). On addition of either ethanol or TFE, shapes of ONMA–HWAT curves remain similar to that observed in case of aqueous NMA [66]. On comparing peak heights of ONMA–HWAT and OWAT–HNMA radial distribution functions (rdfs) at 14.232 m alcohol solution, it is clear that, a more intense peak height arises in case of EtOH than in TFE. Fact implies that, in presence of EtOH, water-NMA interactions are preferred more compared to the system containing TFE. However, the first peak positions at 1.79Å for ONMA–HWAT and 1.92Å for OWAT–HNMA rdfs remain unchanged indicating that addition of either alcohol has no appreciable change in the strength of amide-water hydrogen bond interactions. The second peak in ONMA–HWAT correlation arising in the range 3.23–3.26Å might be due to the other hydrogen of water that hydrogen bonds with ONMA as represented in the first peak [52]. It is seen that with addition of ethanol or TFE this peak height decreases, which indicates tendency of participation in hydrogen-bonding with alcohol. This is also corroborated by a peak at a similar position in HWAT-OEtOH/TFE rdf which shows enhancement with increasing alcohol concentrations, shown in Supporting Information as Fig. S1. The peak around 5–6Å in both ONMA–HWAT and OWAT–HNMA diminishes with increasing alcohol concentrations due to possibility of formation of hydrogen bond of NMA/water with alcohol. The probability of hydrogen bonding between NMA molecules is greater in alcoholic solution of aqueous NMA, as represented by Fig. 2(c). It is observed that the peptide-peptide interactions are significant in concentrated TFE solution than ethanol. This is consonant with previous studies which have demonstrated ability of TFE to promote peptide self-association [56,67]. In Fig. 3 , we have presented ONMA–HEtOH/TFE and HNMA–OEtOH/TFE radial distribution functions. From the rdf shown in Fig. 3(a), it is observed that hydrogen bonding between carbonyl-oxygen of NMA and hydrogen of TFE occurs at 1.69Å with higher peak heights, as compared to the similar interaction with hydrogen of ethanol or water (Fig. 2a) at ~1.79Å, indicating that TFE has more tendency than either ethanol or water, to donate its hydrogen to oxygen of NMA. Comparing Fig. 3(a) and (b), we note that hydrogen bond between ONMA–HEtOH/TFE is stronger than HNMA–OEtOH/TFE, as indicated by peak positions at higher distances (~1.92Å) in the latter. Moreover, it is observed that peak heights for NMA-TFE interaction are considerably greater in hydrogen bonding situations where TFE acts as a hydrogen-bond donor than acceptor to NMA. This is in accordance with earlier experimental studies which have confirmed TFE has better H-bond donor characteristics [24,42,48–50]. The hydrophobic solvation of methyl-groups of NMA is also characterized by the CH3–OWAT radial distribution functions. In Fig. 4 , we have shown the radial distribution functions of both C-methyl and N-methyl of NMA with the oxygen atom of water in presence of ethanol or trifluoroethanol. It is found that the addition of alcohol decreases the number of water molecules near to the hydrophobic methyl surface of NMA, and it is more prominent in case of TFE compared to ethanol solution. The number of water molecules near to the hydrophobic methyl group reduces from approximately 16/17 (in case of pure aqueous NMA solution) to 7 for TFE and 8 for EtOH at highest concentration considered here. The methyl–methyl interaction between NMA and alcohol decreases at higher concentrations and the decrease is more conspicuous in case of TFE solution than in presence of ethanol, as presented in Fig. S2. In Fig. 5 , we observe that the local structure of water is enhanced on addition of alcohol, which is more significant in case of TFE than EtOH. The second peak in case of OWAT–OWAT rdf shows enhancement in presence of alcohol which shows that both EtOH and TFE encourage more ordering of water structure through nearest neighbour tetrahedral coordination. However, this tendency of tetrahedral arrangement of water network is seen to be better facilitated by addition of trifluoroethanol in comparison to ethanol. Water-alcohol and alcohol-alcohol interactions in aqueous ethanol or trifluoroethanol solutions are well explored in literature [35,36,38,40–42] and are illustrated in Fig. S1 as well as Fig. S3 (Supporting Information) for the present study. We have calculated the average interaction energies between NMA-NMA (EPP), NMA-water (EPW), NMA-alcohol (EPA), water-water (EWW), water-alcohol (EWA) and alcohol-alcohol (EAA), and the results are included in Table 2 . The peptide-peptide average interaction energy in water (−0.103kJ/mol) decreases drastically in 14.232 m concentrated EtOH solution (−0.062kJ/mol) but is somewhat maintained (−0.10kJ/mol) in presence of highest TFE concentration considered here. This suggests that presence of TFE does not appreciably interrupt the peptide-peptide hydrogen bonding interaction. Since TFE can mainly donate the hydrogen bond to the carbonyl-oxygen of NMA, it simultaneously allows NMA to hydrogen bond with other NMA molecules. The average interaction between NMA-water decreases from −2.12kJ/mol in aqueous NMA solution to −1.40kJ/mol for EtOH and −1.09kJ/mol for TFE, in 14.232 m concentrated EtOH/TFE solution. With increasing alcohol concentration in the solution, the favorable interaction between NMA and TFE is observed as compared to NMA and EtOH and the values are −1.106kJ/mol and −0.821kJ/mol respectively, for 14.232 m TFE and EtOH solution. The average water-water and water-EtOH/TFE interaction energies show a significant change in the solution, which indicates the modification of hydrogen bond structure in the solution due to formation of stable interspecies hydrogen bonds between water and alcohol. It is observed that in concentrated TFE solution, the interaction between water-alcohol is less preferable but the interaction between water-water, and alcohol-alcohol is more when compared with the same concentrated solution of EtOH. The fact indicates, at higher concentration, more segregates of water and TFE molecules may form as compared to ethanol solution. We have used a set of geometric criteria [66,68–71], to calculate the hydrogen bonds between NMA-water, water-water, NMA- alcohol (EtOH/TFE) and water-alcohol (EtOH/TFE), where it is assumed that a hydrogen bond between two species exists, if the following distance and angular criteria are satisfied, i.e., R(OX) <Rc (OX), R(OH) <Rc (OH), and θ<θc. In case of NMA-water and water-water hydrogen bonds, the distance and angular criteria are taken from previous studies [66,68]. The distance cutoff values can also be obtained from the positions of first minimum of the corresponding radial distribution functions shown in Figs. 2 and 5. For OEtOH/TFE…HNMA hydrogen bond, R(OX) and R(OH) denote the oxygen (EtOH/TFE)−nitrogen (NMA) and oxygen (EtOH/TFE)−hydrogen (NMA) distances, respectively, and angle θ (= θ N NMA O alcohol H NMA )) represents the nitrogen (NMA)−oxygen (alcohol)−hydrogen (NMA) angle. In case of OETOH/TFE…HWAT hydrogen bond, R(OX) and R(OH) denote the oxygen (EtOH/TFE)−oxygen (water) and oxygen (EtOH/TFE)−hydrogen (water) distances, and angle θ (= θ (O water O alcohol H water )) is the oxygen (water)−oxygen (alcohol)−hydrogen (water) angle. The cut-off values for Oalcohol–HNMA and Oalcohol–Hwater distances are determined from the positions of the first minimum of their corresponding rdfs shown in Figs. 3(b) and S1, which are 2.70Å and 2.50Å respectively. Similarly, the cut-off values are also determined for Oalcohol–NNMA in case of NMA-alcohol, and Oalcohol–Owater for alcohol-water hydrogen bonds and the values are 3.40Å in both the cases. We have used the cut-off angle θc =45° for the existence of all types of hydrogen bonds considered here. Generally, the cut-off angle θc =30° is used in geometric criteria but to give more flexibility due to thermal motion sometimes the less strict definition with cut-off angle θc =45° can also be used [71]. We have calculated the probability of finding the different numbers of hydrogen bonds in these alcoholic solutions of NMA. It is observed that in aqueous NMA solution, approximately 54% of the water molecules are four-hydrogen-bonded and 10% are five-hydrogen-bonded whereas the number reduces to ~32% and 3.7% for ethanol, and 35% and 5.4% for TFE, respectively in highest concentrated solution (14.232 m) considered here. On the other hand, the number of two and three-hydrogen-bonded water molecules increases from 7% and 32%, to 20% and 38% for EtOH, and 18% and 34% for TFE, respectively as we move from aqueous NMA to concentrated alcoholic solution (14.232 m) of aqueous NMA. In Fig. 6 , we have shown the probability of finding the different numbers of water-water hydrogen bonds in alcoholic solution of aqueous NMA. It is observed that the tetrahedral network structure of water is mainly affected by ethanol as the loss of four-hydrogen-bonded structure is more when compared with the TFE solution of same concentration. Alternatively, it can be described that, the TFE try to preserve water's four-hydrogen-bonded network structure, hence, less distribution (or gain) on the lower number of hydrogen bonds. The average number and energies of hydrogen-bonds between different species in the solution are shown in Table 3 . It is observed that the average number of NMA-water (ONMA–HWAT and HNMA–OWAT) hydrogen bonds decreases whereas the NMA-alcohol hydrogen bond, increases with increasing EtOH/TFE concentration in the solution. The number of hydrogen bonds between ONMA…HWAT in aqueous NMA solution decreases significantly from 1.80 to 1.23 for EtOH/0.88 for TFE in highly concentrated alcoholic solution (14.232 m) whereas the probability of formation of ONMA…Halcohol hydrogen bond significantly increases with TFE concentration. Here, the ONMA…Halcohol hydrogen bond in fraction (e.g. 0.70) indicates the probability of maximum number of TFE molecules to form a single hydrogen bond with carbonyl-oxygen of NMA. In case of water-alcohol hydrogen bond (given in Table S1, Supporting Info.), it is observed that as we move from 1.156 m to 14.232 m concentrated alcohol solution, the donating ability of alcoholic hydrogen of TFE to water (−27.846kJ/mol) is significantly preferable compared to acceptance ability of hydrogen atom from water (−14.411kJ/mol) whereas the change is negligible in case of OEtOH…Hwater (−18.972kJ/mol) and HEtOH…Owater (−18.873kJ/mol) hydrogen bonds. At highest alcoholic concentrations, it is also observed that hydrogen bonding ability between TFE molecules is comparatively higher than EtOH. Approximately, 35% of ethanol molecules form hydrogen bond with average energy −20.345kJ/mol whereas ~45% of TFE molecules form hydrogen bonds with average energy −24.817kJ/mol. Snapshots of the NMA-water system with EtOH/TFE at 14.232m solution have been shown in Fig. 7 . It is discernible that NMA teams with TFE to separate water molecules which indicates clustering tendency of TFE-water system is higher compared to EtOH in presence of NMA."
4,Hydrogen bond dynamics: lifetime and structural relaxation time,"3.2 Hydrogen bond dynamics: lifetime and structural relaxation time To investigate the dynamics of hydrogen bond between NMA-water and water-water, we consider two hydrogen bond population variables h(t) and H(t), where h(t) is unity when a particular NMA-water and water-water pair is hydrogen bonded at time t according to the adopted definition of hydrogen-bond discussed above, or zero otherwise; whereas, H(t)=1 if the NMA-water and water-water pair remain continuously hydrogen bonded from t =0 to time t, and zero otherwise. To study the breaking dynamics of hydrogen bonds, we calculate the continuous hydrogen-bond time correlation function S HB (t), which is defined as [72–78] (2) S HB t = h 0 H t / h 0 2 , where <⋯·> denotes an average over all NMA-water, water-water pairs. Clearly, S HB (t) describes the probability that an initially hydrogen bonded NMA-water, and water-water pair remain bonded at all times up to t. The associated integrated relaxation time τ HB can be interpreted as the average lifetime of a hydrogen bond. In case of these hydrogen-bonds, the decay of time correlation function is calculated up to 25ps depending on the proper convergence of this function. Unlike the continuous correlation function S HB (t), the intermittent hydrogen-bond correlation function C HB (t) does not depend on the continuous presence of a hydrogen bond. It is defined as [68,72–78], (3) C HB t = h 0 h t / h . The correlation function C HB (t), describes the probability that a hydrogen bond is intact at time t, given it was intact at time zero, independent of possible breaking in the interim time. Thus, the dynamics of C HB (t) describes the structural relaxation of hydrogen bonds, and the associated relaxation times τ R can be interpreted as the time scale of reorganization of NMA-water, water-water bonds. The decay of time correlation function is calculated up to 100ps depending on the smooth convergence of C HB (t). The concentration dependence results of NMA-water, water -water hydrogen bond lifetime and structural relaxation times are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 . In general, it is found that the lifetime and structural relaxation time of all types of hydrogen bonds increases with increasing alcohol (EtOH/TFE) concentration in the solution. The slower hydrogen bond dynamics in these solutions can be explained on the basis of the stability of these hydrogen bonds (Table 3), and also the relative interaction between the species in the solution. It is interesting to note that the lifetime of aqueous NMA hydrogen bond, either ONMA…HWAT/HNMA…OWAT is higher in concentrated ethanol solution compared to TFE, whereas opposite behaviour is observed in case of structural relaxation times. The fact indicates faster dynamics of these hydrogen bonds in TFE solution though it requires more time to reorganize as compared to ethanol solution."
5,Self-diffusion coefficients and orientational relaxation times,"3.3 Self-diffusion coefficients and orientational relaxation times The translational self-diffusion coefficient D i of species i is related to the time integral of the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function (VAF) by (4) D i = k B T m i ∫ o ∞ C v t dt , where k B is the Boltzmann's constant and m i is the mass of species i and C v (t)is the velocity-velocity time correlation function, C v (t), defined by (5) C v t = v i t ⋅ v i 0 v i 0 ⋅ v i 0 , where v i (t) is the velocity of the species i at time t [79] and the average is carried out over all the species in the system and over the initial time. The translational self-diffusion coefficient can also be calculated from the long-time limit of the mean-square displacement (MSD) (6) D i = lim → ∞ r t − r 0 2 6 t , where r(t) is the position of a species i at time t, by a least-square fit of the long-time region of MSD as obtained from simulations. The diffusion coefficients calculated using these two different routes have been found to be quite close to each other and we have taken the average of the values obtained from these two routes for a given type of species. Our calculated self-diffusion coefficient values of NMA, water, EtOH and TFE in the solution are shown in Fig. 10 . It is observed that the diffusion coefficient of NMA is higher in ethanol solution compared to TFE, whereas diffusion coefficient value of water in alcoholic solution does not show appreciable difference in presence of either EtOH/TFE. Experimentally, self-diffusion coefficients of water in its aqueous alcohol mixtures at Xalcohol =0.025, was determined by Harris and Newitt [80] and values are 1.78×10−9 m2 s−1 and 1.91×10−9 m2 s−1 for EtOH and TFE solutions, respectively at 24.95°C and 0.1MPa pressure. We have also included the diffusion coefficient results for alcohol in presence of aqueous NMA and it is found ethanol has higher value compared to TFE. Experimentally at 298K [46], ethanol shows slightly higher diffusion coefficient value than TFE in their aqueous binary mixtures up to Xalcohol =~0.30. Recently, Martins and co-workers [81,82] have calculated diffusion coefficients for TFE in both aqueous and heavy water mixtures through PFG-NMR spin echo technique as well as MD simulations. At 308K, experimentally observed diffusion coefficient value of TFE [82], varies from 1.44×10−9 m2 s−1 to 1.102×10−9 m2 s−1 as mole-fraction (XTFE) changes from 0.0005 to 0.0496, respectively in aqueous binary mixture. Our calculated self-diffusion values of TFE are very close when compared with aqueous binary mixture at 298K and slightly lower than the reported values at 308K. However, the results cannot be compared directly to our calculated values owing to influence of NMA molecules which might evoke further slowdown in motion of TFE in its aqueous solution. The orientational motion of solvent molecules is analyzed by calculating the orientational time correlation function, C l α(t), defined by (7) C l α t = P l e α t ⋅ e α 0 P l e α 0 ⋅ e α 0 , where P l is the Legendre polynomial of rank l and e α is the unit vector which points along the α-axis in the molecular frame. In this work, we have calculated the time dependence of C l α(t) for l =2, and for the three different e α , molecular dipole vector μ, N-H vector of NMA and the O-H vector of water. The orientational correlation timeτ l α , defined as the time integral of the orientational correlation function (8) τ l α = ∫ 0 ∞ dt C l α t , were obtained by explicit integration of the data of C l α (t) from simulations up to 25ps for NMA, EtOH and TFE, whereas for water we have taken t =10–15ps, till the values are properly converged. Experimentally, the rotational diffusion of NMA at varying water content is discussed particularly in studies of Rezus and Bakker [83,84]. The orientational relaxation of the N-H and O-H vector can also be measured by 1H-15N and 17O-1H dipolar relaxation NMR experiments. However, we are not aware of any such experimental measurement of the aqueous NMA system with varying EtOH/TFE concentration. The orientational relaxation times of dipole vector of NMA, water and alcohol along with the orientational relaxation time of N-H vector of NMA and O-H vectors of water are presented in Fig. 11 . The anisotropy decay of O-H vector of water molecules with varying EtOH and TFE concentrations is shown in Fig. 12 . The experimentally observed anisotropy decay is related to the second-order Legendre polynomial time correlation function as 2/5C 2 α (t), where α designates the orientation of the water OH bond [85]. The slowest decay in case of highly concentrated ethanol solution indicates that the water molecules rotate very slowly in ethanol compared to TFE, which can be attributed to the presence of comparatively stable hydrogen bond complexes in the ethanol solution. The standard deviation of the dynamical data presented here is about 2–4% of the average values."
6,Summary and conclusions,"In this paper, we have presented the molecular dynamics simulation results of concentration dependent behaviour of aqueous NMA solution in presence of alcohol, either ethanol (EtOH) or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Six different concentrations of alcoholic solution of aqueous NMA, ranging from 0.0 m to 14.232 m EtOH/TFE have been considered to explore the influence of these two different alcohols on the structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonds in aqueous NMA solution. We have calculated the statistics and energies of solute-solvent (NMA-water and NMA-EtOH/TFE) as well as solvent-solvent (water-water, water-EtOH/TFE) hydrogen bonds along with the solvation structure of NMA in concentrated water-EtOH or water-TFE solution. It is observed that with increasing the alcohol concentration, NMA-water as well as water-water hydrogen bonds decreases whereas the probability of formation of NMA-alcohol hydrogen bond increases which is quite noteworthy at higher concentrations for TFE as well as EtOH. Compared to EtOH solution, TFE preserves hydrogen bonding interaction between the carbonyl-oxygen and amide-hydrogen of NMA (ONMA…HNMA), and also replaces more water molecules from the methyl surface of NMA as indicated by their corresponding radial distribution functions. It is found that TFE prefers to interact with carbonyl-oxygen of NMA through its alcoholic-hydrogen whereas EtOH shows nearly equal tendency to interact with amide-hydrogen as well as carbonyl-oxygen sites of NMA. We have calculated the self-diffusion coefficients and orientational relaxation times of all associated particles present in the solution, which reflects significant slowdown of translational and rotational dynamics of particles with increasing alcohol concentration in the solution. It is believed that the formation of strong inter-species hydrogen bond complexes is mainly responsible for the dynamical slowdown in these solutions. The lifetime and structural relaxation times of some of these hydrogen-bonds are also presented here. It is observed that the lifetime of NMA-water and water-water hydrogen bonds increases significantly with EtOH concentration when compared with TFE solution. On the other hand, the structural-relaxation times of NMA-water hydrogen bonds increase more significantly with increasing TFE concentration in the solution whereas no change in the scenario is observed for water-water structural-relaxation time. The fact indicates slower solvent reorganization, particularly at NMA-water hydrogen bonding sites where population of TFE is significant. The present work is mainly focused on the effects of EtOH/TFE on the hydrogen bonding structure and dynamics of aqueous NMA solution. It is hoped that these findings may further encourage experimental studies in this field. It would be also worthwhile to study the behaviour of aqueous NMA or a small peptide in presence of some other cosolvents mixtures, like TMAO, Urea etc. where hydrogen bond plays an important role. Hope we will address this issue in near future."
