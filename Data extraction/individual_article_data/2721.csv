0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is considered to be a potential source of green renewable energy and alternative to the presently fast depleting fossil fuels, owing to its zero emission properties and high energy density [1]. Microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) is a promising technology for the production of H2 from waste organic biomass [2]. The technology assumes a significantly high importance because it can produce a clean energy and simultaneously remediate wastewater. Electrochemically active bacteria oxidizes organic matter and generates H2 at a lower applied voltage (Vapp) in an MEC than in a water electrolyzer (>1.23 V) [3–5]. The H2 evolution reaction (HER) overpotential in MEC (∼0.2 V) is approximately 10 times smaller than that in water electrolyzer (∼1.8–2.0 V) [6–8]. In the last few years, several studies have been undertaken with a view to developing efficient electrode materials for MEC. An efficient electrode should possess good electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity, biocompatibility, electrochemical stability, large active surface area, and low H2 overpotential [9]. Most of the early studies pertaining to MECs focused on platinum (Pt) as the electrocatalyst because of its low HER overpotential and small free energy difference in the Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction [1,10]. There are, however, economic constraints in the practical use of Pt. The metal is also prone to poisoning by chemicals such as sulphur compounds and phosphate anions that are often present in wastewater [4,8,11,12]. Therefore, current research is geared towards finding the non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts. Among different electrode materials used in MECs, including stainless steel [13–15], carbon [16–22] and molybdenum disulfide [23], nickel (Ni) and Ni-based alloys [4,10,24–28] are preferred because of the smaller HER overpotential measured in the latter electrodes. H2 production and yield in the Ni electrode-based MECs have also been measured to be comparable to those in the Pt-based MECs [25,29]. Kadier et al. [4] have reported the maximum H2 production rate (QH2) of 4.18 m3m−3d−1 using Ni mesh as the cathode. Yet studies are required for modifying these materials to further reduce H2 overpotential and attain a relatively higher QH2. Recently, graphene-based materials have emerged as a high performing energy material, attributed to its high electrical conductivity and large surface area. These materials also possess significant electrocatalytic activity and are used in several applications including oxygen reduction reaction in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and HER in MECs. A good review of the applications of graphene in supercapacitors, solar cells, electronics and electrochemical sensing is available [30]. Lately, the material has also attracted attention in the MEC applications. Dai et al. [1] synthesized the magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) and graphene-based nanocomposite coated on a carbon paper as an efficient electrode for HER and reported 71% H2 recovery (rH2), 83% cathodic H2 recovery (rCAT) and a QH2 of 0.63 m3m−3d−1. Whereas Mg(OH)2 showed catalytic activity towards HER, graphene was included in the composite to make up for the low electrical conductivity of Mg(OH)2. Cai et al. [24] prepared graphene-based electrode by soaking Ni foam in the aqueous graphene oxide (GO) suspension and showed a significant enhancement (∼1.5 folds) in QH2 (1.31 m3m−3d−1) compared to the bare Ni foam. The study also showed that the coating of GO on the Ni foam enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the composite towards HER. The focus of several recent studies is on the preparation of three dimensional (3D) electrode materials for MECs. Salient amongst such studies, a 3D granular activated carbon (GAC) has been used as anode [16]. The high surface area to volume ratio of the material is shown to increase the growth of biofilm, leading to an increased interaction between microbes and anode, compared to that on the flat 2D surface. The 3D structure facilitates electron transfer to anode. The overpotential at anode is also reduced, attributed to the enhanced biofilm formation [31]. Another study has used a Ni foam as the cathode in MEC because of a unique 3D scaffolding structure of the material [24]. The study shows the 3D structure increasing electron transfer and reducing the overpotential barrier in HER. Li et al. [10] have also used a 3D Ni foam at cathode and attributed its superior performance relative to that of a 2D planar structure, to the increased specific surface area and catalytic activity of the material. Lu et al. [25] have shown that the inclusion of a 3D architecture in the electrode system promotes the penetration of the electrolyte ions through the increased electrochemical active surface area. Also, energy loss was reduced, which was measured to be otherwise high in the 2D structure, caused by a small mass transfer rate. The present study describes the synthesis of a carbon film in situ dispersed with Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The laser-ablation technique is used to engrave 3D micropillars in the carbon film. Such technique of creating 3D microstructure in an electrode material has been successfully implemented in a recent study of the MFCs [32]. The 3D structure effectively increased exposure of the in situ dispersed metal NPs and rGO in the material to the surrounding electrolyte. The micropillars-engraved Ni-rGO-carbon film prepared in this study is used as the electrodes of a single chamber microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) for H2 generation. The material is characterized for its physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, and the synergistic roles of the 3D micropillars, Ni NPs and rGO are elucidated via the experimental measurements including H2 production rate and energy efficiency of the cell."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Phenol, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), formaldehyde (HCHO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), triethylamine (TEA), Ni(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) (purity > 98%), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (NaHPO4) were purchased from Merck, Germany. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) (K-12) culture was procured indigenously. Sigma Gases, India supplied nitrogen (N2) and H2 gases (purity > 99%). Sinsil International, India supplied the standard Pt/C electrode (loading of Pt = 0.5 mg/cm2)."
3,Electrode preparation,"2.2 Electrode preparation Fig. 1 schematically describes the synthesis steps. A mixture of phenol monomer, HCHO solvent and TEA catalyst having mole fractions of 0.18, 0.81 and 0.01, respectively was transferred into a round bottom-flask and stirred at 120 rpm for 2 h at room temperature. Mill-Q water (∼80 mL) was mixed into the solution. HMTA (∼2.5 g) (cross-linking agent) was mixed to the solution after ∼30 min and the reaction temperature was gradually increased to ∼65 °C. The PVA binder was mixed into the mixture after ∼45 min of mixing HMTA. Approximately 9 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1 g of GO were mixed into the solution just at the inception of the gel formation. GO was synthesized as per the standard Hummers method. Heating was switched off after ∼30 min and the mixture was cast in a Teflon mould. The prepared (cross-linked phenol-HCHO) polymer dispersed with Ni-salt and GO was dried at 65 °C for 24 h and in an oven at 110 °C for another 12 h. The dried film, termed as Ni-GO-P for the reference purposes in this study, was carbonized at 900 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere at a flowrate of 150 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm). This step resulted in the carbonization of the polymeric mass, conversion of GO into rGO and that of NiNO3 into NiO. The H2-reduction of the carbonized film was carried out at 550 °C for 2 h to convert NiO to Ni NPs, keeping the gas flowrate constant at 150 sccm. The reduction temperature was determined by performing the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis (Fig. S1). The synthesized film is termed as Ni-rGO-PC in this study for the reference purposes. Some electrodes were prepared without rGO for the comparison purposes and are termed as Ni-PC. Some electrodes were prepared without Ni or GO and are termed as PC. The prepared Ni-rGO-PC film was laser-ablated to fabricate micropillars using the Epilog laser (30 W-power, Fiber Mark Fusion, USA) machine. The laser machine was operated in the raster mode at the optimized values of 60% speed, 80% power and 1200 dots per inch. The laser-ablated carbon film sample was termed as Ni-rGO-PC-L. Approximately 900 micropillars of the square dimensions (500 μm × 500 μm) and 100 μm height were fabricated in one sample. The interspacing was set at 500 μm. The average length of the micropillars was equal to the interspacing between the two adjacent micropillars (∼500 μm). Therefore, the micropillars were fabricated at an equidistant spacing both in horizontal as well as vertical directions. The same design was used on both sides of the carbon film. The average height of 3D micropillars was ∼100 μm, and the remaining region which was selectively engraved (excluding micropillars) was on the bottom side. The fiber laser cutting with the solid state pulsed Ytterbium source was used for fabricating the micropillars on the carbon film. The square cross-sectional design was prepared using the CorelDRAW software."
4,"MEC set-up, operation and measurements","2.3 MEC set-up, operation and measurements A single chamber membrane-less MEC was fabricated using a laboratory glass bottle (effective volume = 100 mL, diameter = 4 cm and height = 12 cm). Anode and cathode (3 cm × 3 cm) were separated using a layer of plastic frame (distance between anode and cathode = ∼0.5 cm) to avoid short-circuit. Titanium wires were used for the electrical connections. The electrodes were used in an MFC set-up, and when the open circuit potential reached over 0.5 V at 1000 Ω external resistor, the anode was removed and used in the MEC set-up, along with a fresh cathode. The electrolytic solution for the MEC was prepared by mixing 50 mL of sodium acetate (3 gL-1) in 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 50 mL of E. coli-Luria Bertani broth (pH = 7, 108–109 CFU mL−1). The buffer solution contained 0.24 g of KH2PO4, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4, 0.2 g of KCl and 8.0 g of NaCl. The MEC was connected to a DC power supply and voltage was recorded across the 10 Ω external resistance. An external resistance is used in the MEC circuit to determine the current by recording the corresponding voltage. A relatively smaller resistance results in a higher current density and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Also, increasing loading of the organic substrate results in an increased current only when the external resistance is small [33]. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal is also relatively higher if small external resistance is used in the circuit [34]. Moreover, the introduction of the external resistance results in additional voltage loss in the system. For increasing the efficiency of MEC, the voltage loss should be small. Therefore, a low external resistance is preferred. The cell was purged for 30 min using N2 gas to create an anaerobic environment. Voltage across the MEC was recorded at 1 h interval, using a multimeter (2000, Keithley, USA). The fresh nutrient solution (100 mL) was used after each cycle as the substrate was gradually depleted because of the growth of E. coli. On application of the voltage, electric current was generated through a 10 Ω resistance, attributed to the electron transfer via H2 generation. Current density rapidly increased after the replenishment of the nutrient solution, reaching a stable current value, and thereafter, rapidly decreased because of depletion of the substrate. The currents < 0.10 mA signified the depletion of the substrate. Therefore, when the current value decreased to 0.10 mA, it marked the end of the cycle, and the nutrient solution was replenished. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Total volume of the produced biogas was measured using the downward water displacement method. The MEC was connected to a gas-tight graduated measuring flask via a silicone tube. Biogas was sampled from the head space of the MEC via a septum, using the gas-tight syringe (Hamilton Co., USA). A gas chromatography (GC) (model Trace 1110, Thermo Fisher, USA) attached with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determine the volumetric fractional percentages of H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2). N2 (>99.99%) at 20 sccm was used as the carrier gas. The standard titration method using potassium dichromate was used to determine COD of the electrolytic solution in the MEC before and after the test runs. Electrochemical properties of the electrodes were determined from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis by performing the measurements in the AUTOLAB-PGSTAT302N (Netherlands) workstation. The CV analysis was performed in a 3-electrode assembly cell. The electrode assembly was equipped with a working electrode, counter electrode (Pt rod) and reference electrode (KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl). Tests were performed in the bacterial solution over the potential window of −0.6 to +0.4 V and 1 mVs−1-scan rate. The LSV analysis was conducted over the potential window of −1.8 to +0.2 V and 10 mVs−1-scan rate in 50 mM PBS solution. The EIS analysis was performed at the potential amplitude value of 0.01 V and the frequency ranging from 1,00,000–0.01 Hz. Charge transfer resistance (Rct), solution resistance (Rs), and Warburg diffusion resistance (W) were calculated using the frequency response analyzer (FRA) software. Performance of the MEC was evaluated using various parameters: CE (%), rcat (%), rH2 (%), QH2 (m3m−3d−1), maximum current density (Imax, Am−2), COD removal efficiency (%), volume of H2 produced (VH2, mL), H2 yield (YH2, mol H2 mol substrate−1), energy added by the substrate (Ws, kJ) and that by the power source (WE, kJ), energy recovered as H2 (WH2, kJ), electrical energy efficiency (ηE, %), substrate energy efficiency (ηS, %), overall energy recovery (ηE+S, %), and energy contributed by power source (eE, %) and that by the substrate (eS, %) (refer the supplementary file). The electrochemical characterization and the MEC tests were also performed using the standard Pt/C electrode at a Vapp of 0.8 V for the comparison purposes. The measurements were repeated thrice to check the repeatability."
5,Physico-chemical characterization,"Various analytical and spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the prepared electrodes. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis was performed to measure the Ni metal loading using AA240, Varian (Germany). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed to examine the surface morphology of the materials, using the Zeiss, Supra 40 VP (Germany) instrument. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Oxford Instruments, UK) provided information related to the elemental compositions of the electrode. Crystal planes and crystallite size of the Ni NPs were determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (PANalytical X'Pert-Pro). The XRD analysis was performed using Cu Kα radiation with 2θ angle ranging from 5 to 80° and 3° per min-scan rate. Measurements of BET surface area (SBET) and micro/mesopore volumes and the TPR analysis were carried out using the Autosorb 1C Quantachrome (USA) instrument. Samples were degassed for 12 h at 200 °C prior to the analysis. Relative pressures over 0.05–0.35 were used for the SBET analysis. The amounts of adsorbed N2 at the relative pressure near unity determined the total pore volume (Vtotal). The t-plot method was used to determine the micropore volume. Meso-macro pore volume was determined from the difference between the total pore and micropore volumes. The TPR analysis was performed in a quartz U-tube cell containing ∼100 mg of samples. The TCD detector recorded the signal by determining the amount of H2 consumed over the temperature range used in the analysis. Surface functional groups in the material were determined using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Tensor 27, Bruker, Germany). The analysis was performed over the wave number ranging from 650 to 3250 cm−1. Raman spectroscopy (Alpha, Witec, Germany) was used over 650–3250 cm−1 range to determine the ID/IG ratio in the materials. The Ar laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used for the analysis. Surface topography of the electrode was investigated using the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) instrument (FEI Titan G2 60–300, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"SEM, EDX and TEM analysis","4.1 SEM, EDX and TEM analysis The SEM images of GO showed the presence of an exfoliated sheet-like structure (Fig. 2 a-a'). The SEM images of Ni-rGO-PC showed an interconnected matrix of Ni NPs, carbon and dense rGO layers (Fig. 2b-b'). Fig. 2(c-c') shows the SEM image of the Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode. The carbon micropillars are clearly visible. The dimensions of the micropillars were measured to be approximately 500 μm × 500 μm at the interspacing of 500 μm. Fig. 2d and d' show the SEM images of the Ni-rGO-PC and Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode samples post MEC operation, respectively. A denser and more uniform growth of biofilm occurred at the laser-ablated (3D) electrode than on the unablated (2D) electrode. The 3D micropillars induced roughness at the film surface, which in turn facilitated the biofilm formation resulting in the enhanced performance of the MEC, discussed later. It has also been mentioned that there is a limited bacterial loading or growth of biofilm at the flat 2D surface, as compared to that at the 3D surface [32,35,36]. The SEM image of the rGO-PC (without Ni) electrode post-MEC operation has also been included in the supplementary file (Fig. S2) for the comparison purposes. Fig. S3 shows the EDX and HR-TEM analyses of Ni-rGO-PC-L."
8,Ni loading and SBET analysis,"4.2 Ni loading and SBET analysis Acid digestion was used to determine Ni metal loading in the Ni-rGO-PC-L sample. Approximately 0.1 g of the sample was powdered and mixed with 20 mL of concentrated HNO3. The beads mixed in acid were heated at 60 °C for 48 h. The procedure was repeated three times. Residue in the beaker was mixed with Milli-Q water. The AAS analysis was used to measure the metal content in the solution. The analysis revealed the Ni metal loading of ∼27 mg g−1 in the prepared material. The SBET of the polymeric sample (pre-carbonization) was determined to be negligible. Carbonization of the polymer matrix created porosity in the material. The SBET and pore volumes in the PC electrode (w/o Ni and rGO) were measured to be ∼576 m2g-1 and 0.54 cm3g-1, respectively. The inclusion of Ni and rGO resulted in ∼70% decrease in SBET (∼167 m2g-1) and pore volume (0.16 cm3g-1). The SBET and pore volume of the laser-ablated sample (Ni-rGO-PC-L) were measured to be ∼246 m2g-1 and 0.25 cm3g-1, respectively, which were ∼1.5 folds higher than that of the unablated sample (Ni-rGO-PC). Nevertheless, despite less SBET and pore volume of the Ni-rGO-PC-L as compared to the PC electrode, the Ni-rGO-PC-L-based MEC performed superior, discussed later. The adsorption isotherms indicated the Type-II characteristics of the material (Fig. 3 a). The pore volume analysis showed that Ni-rGO-PC-L contained a hierarchical porosity, i.e., micro- and mesoporosity contents were present in the material. The individual contributions from micro- and mesoporosity were determined to be ∼31 and 69%, respectively in Ni-rGO-PC-L. Studies in literature indicate that such a hierarchical structure facilitates diffusion of electrolyte at the electrode surface, besides enhancing the biofilm formation [37,38]."
9,FTIR analysis,"4.3 FTIR analysis The FT-IR spectra of the pre- and post-carbonized films, namely, Ni-GO-P and Ni-rGO-PC are presented in Fig. 3b. The peak at ∼1600 cm−1 is attributed to the CC groups of the aromatic rings. The stretching vibrations at ∼1380, 1200 and 1080 cm−1 are attributed to the carboxyl OCO, epoxy CO, and alkoxy CO groups in the sample, respectively [39]. However, the peak intensities of the functional groups containing oxygen are suppressed in the spectrum of the carbonized sample, i.e. Ni-rGO-PC, indicating that the carbonization step successfully resulted in the reduction of GO. The spectra of the laser-ablated sample (Ni-rGO-PC-L) did not show any new peaks, indicating that the laser ablation did not chemically modify the surface."
10,XRD analysis,"4.4 XRD analysis Fig. 3c shows the XRD spectra of the Ni-GO-P film (pre-carbonization), and fresh and spent Ni-rGO-PC-L samples. The spectra of Ni-GO-P shows only one distinct peak at ∼10°, which is the characteristic of the (0 0 1) crystallographic plane of GO. This peak is, however, absent in the spectra of the carbonized samples, because of the conversion of GO into rGO. There is one common characteristic peak at ∼24° in the fresh and spent Ni-rGO-PC-L samples, corresponding to the (0 0 2) crystallographic plane of carbon. A relatively narrow and sharp peak corresponding to (0 0 2) plane indicates a well ordered 2D structure of the rGO sheets [40]. The XRD spectra also show three distinct peaks at 2θ of ∼44, 52 and 760, attributed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) crystallographic planes pertaining to Ni, respectively (JCPDS-04e0850). The similar spectra of the spent electrode confirmed that the crystalline structure of the material was not affected during the MEC operation. The crystal sizes of the Ni NPs, calculated using the Scherrer's equation (r = kλ/β cos θ), where λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.154 nm), β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM) in radians), k is the shape factor (0.9) and θ corresponds to Bragg angle, were measured to be between 21.9 and 27.4 nm."
11,Raman analysis,"4.5 Raman analysis Fig. 3d shows the Raman spectra of the rGO containing electrode materials. The spectrum of PC is included in the figure for the comparison purposes. The I D /I G ratio, which denotes the relative degree of disorderness, significantly decreased in the rGO-containing materials, indicating an increase in the graphitic characteristics of the electrode. The intensity in the laser-ablated material further decreased, attributed to the increased exposure of rGO from within the material surface. A vibrational peak at 2750 cm−1 was also observed in the spectra of all materials, attributed to 2D (G′) band. The peak at ∼2679 cm−1 indicated the existence of a single or few layer(s) of graphene in the carbon-based materials. The shifting of this peak may occur towards high wavelengths in the multiple layers of graphene [37]. The spectra of the spent Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode showed the approximately similar I D /I G ratio, indicating that there was no change in the graphitic characteristics of the spent (used) electrode post the MEC operation."
12,"Electrochemical analyses (CV, LSV and EIS)","4.6 Electrochemical analyses (CV, LSV and EIS) The CV tests were performed on the electrodes subjected to the 5-days colonization of biofilm. Fig. 4 a shows the CV data of different electrodes. The PC electrode did not show any significant redox peaks. The Ni-PC showed a minor redox peak. However, the capacitive current significantly increased in the material. Such double layer capacitive characteristics pertains to the storage capacity and ion accumulation in the electrodes [41]. It is mentioned that the capacitive current frequently may mask the Faradaic current in porous electrodes. The redox peaks and the capacitive current were more significant in Ni-rGO-PC as compared to Ni-PC, with the redox peak current density increasing to ∼0.004 A/cm2. The Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode showed even higher capacitive current and prominent reduction and oxidation peaks at ∼0.27 and 0.18 V, with the measured peak current density values of ∼0.006 and 0.011 A/cm2, respectively. The peak current value measured in Ni-rGO-PC-L was approximately twice that in the unablated sample (Ni-rGO-PC), attributed to the 3D micropillars facilitating the biofilm formation which increased the interactions between the microbes and electrode, and also, provided relatively more exposure of the dispersed rGO and Ni NPs within the carbon film to the surrounding electrolyte. This in turn facilitated the electron transfer process. The hierarchical porosity in Ni-rGO-PC-L also favored the biofilm growth, as was corroborated by the SBET analysis discussed earlier. The growth of a dense and uniform biofilm was confirmed earlier by the SEM images (Fig. 2d'). E. coli is not electrochemically conductive or electroactive. However, in the absence of a mediator, transfer of electrons from the E. coli to the anode surface occurs via two ways. (1) The electrochemically active electron shuttling redox compounds excreted by E. coli act as a self-mediator for the extracellular electron transfer [42–45]. (2) The cell appendages such as cytochromes or pili (also known as the electroconductive bacterial nanowire) present at the outer membrane of E. coli facilitate electron transfer directly to the anode [44,46]. Further, carbon nanomaterials or metal NPs can also themselves facilitate transfer of electrons to anode from the c-type cytochrome of E. coli in the mediator-less fuel cells [43,47]. The biofilm adhesion was also enhanced by the secretion of adhesins on pili and fimbriae [46]. Biocompatibility of the prepared electrodes was evaluated by performing antibacterial test on rGO-PC and Ni-rGO-PC-L against E. coli. The standard plate count method was used for the test. The results (presented in Supplementary Fig. S4) clearly show insignificant antibacterial effect of the prepared electrodes on E. coli. In the control experiment performed for 72 h, number of colonies of E. coli was found to be approximately the same (∼108 CFU mL−1) as in the broths containing rGO-PC and Ni-rGO-PC-L, clearly confirming that the prepared electrodes did not show antibacterial effect, or the electrodes were biocompatible. Therefore, the metabolism of E. coli remained unaltered and there was no inhibitory effect on the performance of MEC. It is also worthwhile to mention that Ni or carbon-based materials have been extensively used as electrodes in MFCs/MECs, corroborating the fact that such materials do not show any antibacterial effect on microbes [43,48]. Fig. 4b shows the representative LSV data of the electrodes. The data for the Pt/C electrode are also included in the figure for the comparison purposes. The bare PC electrode showed a negligible cathodic current. Inclusion of Ni in the material significantly increased the current to ∼0.023 A and showed an overpotential of ∼1.1 V for HER. It was earlier mentioned that the Ni-based materials exhibit a good catalytic activity towards HER [4,10,24–27]. The Ni-rGO-PC showed a significant decrease in overpotential (∼0.2 V), along with the higher current density (∼0.029 A/cm2) than in the Ni-PC electrode, attributed to the inclusion of rGO in the material. The LSV data of Pt/C electrode showed the similar magnitude of current but a larger overpotential (∼0.8 V) as that measured in Ni-rGO-PC. The laser-ablated sample (Ni-rGO-PC-L) showed even higher current density (∼0.031 A/cm2) and lower overpotential (∼0.3 V) than those in the material without micropillars (i.e., Ni-rGO-PC), re-corroborating the efficacy of laser ablation in providing relatively more exposure of Ni and rGO to the electrolyte. It can be noted that the trend in the LSV data for the different materials is consistent with that in the CV data. In acidic medium, HER may proceed via three reaction mechanistic steps. Similar reaction behavior have also been observed in PBS solution [49]. The steps are as follows [50,51]: 1) Volmer reaction (primary adsorption/discharge step): Image 2 2) Heyrovsky reaction (desorption step): Image 3 3) Tafel reaction (recombination step): Image 4 H2 evolution occurs either by the Volmer-Heyrovsky (steps 1 and 2) or Volmer-Tafel (steps 1 and 3) mechanism. A comparison between the experimental and calculated Tafel slopes can be used to identify the rate determining step. Tafel plots of different electrodes were constructed and the linear portions of the plots were fitted to the Tafel equation (η = b log j + a, where η is the overpotential (V), j is the current density (Am−2) and b is the Tafel slope) (Fig. S5). The analysis revealed the smallest Tafel slope of ∼49 mVdec−1 measured in the best performing Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode. The measured slope being close to ∼40 mVdec−1 indicates that Heyrovsky reaction (desorption step) is the rate determining step controlling the HER kinetics. Therefore, the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism may be governing HER in neutral medium. The highest limiting current density of ∼1.2 Am−2, measured in the Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode, was calculated from the intercept of the Tafel slope at the X axis. It may be mentioned that the Tafel slopes of the other prepared electrodes varied over a wide range. The Tafel slopes of the electrodes, measured close to 120 mVdec−1 indicates that the Volmer reaction (adsorption step) is the rate determining step. The reason of the higher Tafel slopes measured for the other electrodes is attributed to the deviation of the conventional Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel HER mechanism because of an inherently slow HER kinetics in neutral medium [25]. Further, the Tafel slope may not solely define the HER mechanism, and there may be other factors affecting the catalytic performance of the prepared electrodes [51]. The EIS analysis was performed to determine the different internal resistances associated with the MEC, namely, Rs, Rct and W (Fig. 4c-c'). Table 1 presents the values of resistances calculated from the Nyquist plots. The following decreasing order for the resistances was measured: PC > Ni-PC > Ni-rGO-PC > Ni-rGO-PC-L. The resistance in the standard Pt/C electrode was measured to be smaller than that in Ni-PC, but higher in the rGO containing electrode. A diminution of ∼1.5, 4 and 2.2 folds in the values of Rs, Rct and W, respectively was measured in the unablated electrode material (Ni-rGO-PC) compared to the laser ablated material (Ni-rGO-PC-L). The electrochemical analysis, viz., CV, LSV, Tafel slope analysis and EIS clearly indicate that the Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode showed superior performance as compared to the other electrodes (including Pt/C) in terms of a relatively smaller overall resistance, higher current generation and lower HER overpotential. Therefore, Ni-rGO-PC-L was recommended for the MEC tests discussed in the following section."
13,MEC tests,"4.7 MEC tests The MEC tests were performed using Ni-rGO-PC-L at different values of Vapp, viz., 0.6, 0.8 and 1 V. For the comparison purposes, the MEC test using the standard Pt/C electrode at the cathode was also performed for a Vapp of 0.8 V and the results are included in Fig. 5 and Table 2 . The performance parameters, namely, rCAT, rH2, CE, QH2 and YH2 showed increasing trends with the increase of Vapp from 0.6 to 1 V (Fig. 5). Approximately 1.5, 1.2 and 1.25 folds-increases were measured in QH2, YH2 and VH2, respectively (Table 2). The energy efficiency ηS also increased with the increasing Vapp. However, ηE significantly decreased. Therefore, ηE+S which considers both, the energy provided by the substrate and that supplied from the external electrical source, decreased with increasing Vapp (Table 2). It is important to mention that eS was greater than eE. Specifically, eS was measured to be ∼4.7 (at 0.6 V), 3.3 (at 0.8 V) and 2.4 (at 1.0 V) folds higher than eE, indicating that most of the energy required for the system was derived from the substrate rather than the input energy. Thus, there exists a trade-off between QH2 and ηE+S. Increase in Vapp results in increasing QH2. However, energy recovery decreases. Therefore, an optimum Vapp is required to efficiently operate MEC. The comparative data for Ni-rGO-PC-L and the standard Pt/C at a Vapp of 0.8 V indicate that the prepared electrode performed better than the Pt/C electrode. Increments of ∼1.1, 1.06 and 1.05 folds in the values of QH2, YH2 and ηE+S, respectively, were measured in the laser ablated electrode (Ni-rGO-PC-L) relative to those in the Pt/C electrode. The increase in the value of rcat (∼96–98%) with Vapp indicates that a relatively greater number of electrons generated at anode caused H2 production at cathode. The rH2 performance parameter, which is the measure of the amount of H2 produced relative to the theoretical H2 production based on the substrate COD removal, also showed the increasing trend (∼88–95%). It is thus obvious that with increase in the values of rcat, the other performance indices, namely, rH2, COD and CE, QH2 and YH2 also increased. The increase in the value of QH2 from ∼3.34 to 4.84 m3/m3-d signifies that relatively more volume of H2 was produced per unit volume of the reactor. Similarly, the yield of H2 (YH2) increased from ∼2.57 to 2.96, implying more amount of H2 production relative to that of the organic substrate used in MEC. The CE refers to the efficiency with which the electrons are transferred in MEC to perform the electrochemical reaction. It is the measure of the electrical current recovered relative to the maximum theoretical current that can be recovered from the substrate. The CE is dependent on E. coli which is responsible for the oxidation reaction and the organic substrate from which electrons are generated [52]. The results show that CE increases from ∼91 to ∼97% as Vapp is increased from 0.6 to 1 V. The COD removal also increases from ∼92 to ∼97%. The relatively higher values of both CE and COD removal indicate that E. coli efficiently transfers electrons to anode and is capable of almost completely oxidizing the organic substrate. Thus, minimum energy is lost from the system in the form of incomplete oxidation, thereby yielding high values for CE and the COD removal. The enhanced performance of the prepared electrode (Ni-rGO-PC-L) was attributed to the presence of Ni NPs, rGO and 3D micropillars in the material. The Ni NPs served as the electrocatalyst for the HER reaction, and also enhanced electron transfer to the electrode, thereby decreasing Rct. Presence of rGO in the material enhanced the electroconductivity which increased the charge transfer through the electrode. The 3D micropillars provided an increased exposure to the in situ dispersed Ni NPs and rGO via an increased surface to volume ratio or the surface roughness, thus facilitating the biofilm formation and the oxidation reaction at anode. A comparative evaluation of the performances of Ni-rGO-PC-L and the electrodes discussed in literature [1,4,10,13,14,17–19,24–26,29] for a single chamber MEC is presented in Table 3 . Although various studies have listed the performance at different Vapp, the comparison may still be considered to be appropriate because QH2 increases with increase in Vapp. However, ηE+S decreases simultaneously. Therefore, a good performance of the MEC can be correlated with the reasonable values of both, QH2 and ηE+S. The comparative data clearly indicate that the performance of Ni-rGO-PC-L is superior to the other listed electrodes in Table 2. For instance, Kadier et al. [4] have reported a higher value of rCAT and the comparable values of QH2 and YH2. However, Vapp is higher, and therefore, ηE+S is lower than that in the present study. Su et al. [13], on the other hand, have reported a higher value of CE, but the rCAT, rH2 and QH2 values in the present study are higher at a lower Vapp. A higher value of CE was also reported by Zhang et al. [14]. However, QH2 was higher in the present study at a lower Vapp. The above-discussed data, therefore, clearly indicate a relatively superior performance of Ni-rGO-PC-L for H2 production in MEC."
14,Stability test,"4.8 Stability test Cyclic tests were conducted to determine the stability of Ni-rGO-PC-L in MEC. The MEC was operated for 8 consecutive batch cycles over 216 h or 9 days at a Vapp of 0.8 V and the representative current density profile is shown in Fig. 6 . The average current density was measured to be ∼21.3 Am−2 that was ∼1.2 folds higher than that measured at 0.6 V (∼17.4 Am−2). The current density profile also reveals almost similar peak current density for the first 6 cycles, indicating a good stability of the prepared electrode. Peak current density, however, decreased slightly (<10%) in the last 2 cycles, which may be attributed to the formation of Ni hydride, poisoning of the active surface area or clogging of the pores due to H2 gas bubbles [53,54]. The AAS measurements of the spent nutrient solution were made to determine leaching of the Ni NPs, if any, during the MEC test. The AAS analysis revealed absence of the Ni NPs in the spent solution, which further corroborated the stability of the fabricated electrode."
15,Conclusions,"A novel Ni and rGO containing carbon film, engraved with 3D carbon micropillars, was synthesized and recommended as the MEC electrode. Fabrication of the 3D micropillars in the film helped to expose the in situ dispersed Ni NPs and rGO to the electrolyte, and also, create roughness on the material surface for an increased biofilm adhesion. Besides serving as the electrocatalyst for HER, the Ni NPs facilitated electron transfer. The electrochemical characterization tests viz., LSV, Tafel slope analysis and EIS, and the MEC tests showed the Ni-rGO-PC-L-based MEC to be performing better than the standard Pt/C electrode-based MEC. The Tafel slope of ∼49 mVdec−1 measured in the best performing Ni-rGO-PC-L electrode indicates that Heyrovsky reaction or electrochemical desorption is the rate determining step governing the HER kinetics. The enhanced performance of the prepared electrode was attributed to the synergistic effects of electrocatalytic Ni NPs, electroconductive rGO and 3D micropillars. The comparative evaluation of the various performance parameters also revealed the higher values for the Ni-rGO-PC-L-based MEC than those discussed in literature. It is, therefore, clear that the prepared electrode in this study can possibly provide a substitute to the novel metals-based electrodes for an MEC for H2 production."
