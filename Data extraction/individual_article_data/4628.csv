0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been recognized as an ideal green oxidant and exploited to a variety of sectors including chemical synthesis, environmental protection, and energy storage.[1-6] In synthetic organic chemistry, H2O2 can be applied to epoxidation of substituted alkenes, demonstrating advantages of safety, cost-efficiency, high availability and low waste production over conventional method which employs peracetic acid.[7] In addition, alcohols can be in-situ dehydrogenized using 3–30 wt% H2O2 to carbonyl compounds with a slight excess of H2O2 addition while high yields can be achieved.[8] In environmental protection, H2O2 with different concentrations (1 wt% to 30 wt%) can be used as the oxidants to process exhaust gases e.g. sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NO) with illumination of UV light, showing high removal efficiencies (up to 99% under the best condition).[9] Fenton reagents that consist of ferrous ions (Fe2+) and H2O2 are common chemicals for degradation of various organic pollutants via active radicals in water treatment.[10] In energy applications, H2O2 can be used as both fuel and oxidant in fuel cells where H2O2 is continuously produced by reduction of dioxygen, which enables sustainable energy supply.[11] The H2O2 fuel cell combined with ethylene glycol has proved its high-performance in power output.[12] In general, all these applications of H2O2 are beneficial from the oxidizability attributed to its decomposition. From the perspective of mechanism, oxidizing free radicals produced by decomposition of H2O2 allow the oxidation processes to proceed.[13] Therefore, investigation of H2O2 decomposition is helpful to understand the oxidation process. The mechanisms of H2O2 photolysis and catalytic decomposition have been studied to evaluate oxidation effect of H2O2 in practical applications. For instance, the reaction kinetic model in photolysis of 0.1 wt% H2O2 to generate highly reactive OH* radicals was explored at different light conditions. It was found that the reaction rate constant of photolysis follows the pseudo-first order kinetic model under ultraviolet (UV) excitation.[14] Similarly, a kinetic model was proposed for describing H2O2 photolysis in the presence of organic chemicals indicating a second order reaction with respect to OH*.[15] Besides photolysis, H2O2 decomposition was also frequently studied under metals or metal oxides catalyzing.[16-23] A density functional theory (DFT) simulation was carried out to analyze the microkinetic mechanism of H2O2 decomposition over palladium (Pd) catalyst. It was found that breaking of O-O bond is the crucial process governing H2O2 decomposition activity.[16] A first order reaction kinetic model was proposed to explain the H2O2 decomposition on the surface of zirconia (ZrO2). Furthermore, the dependency of the pseudo-first order rate constant with specific surface area was studied to determine a second order rate constant.[19] The rate of H2O2 decomposition over manganese dioxide (MnO2) has been studied giving a first order rate constant which increases progressively with decreasing molar ratio of H2O2 to MnO2.[21] Although the H2O2 decomposition can facilitate certain processes as a positive effect, the inevitable decomposition reaction can sometimes bring troubles in other processes.[7,24,25] In the view of synthesis of H2O2, undesired decomposition is a more thermodynamically favorable process relative to formation process since catalysts for synthesis of H2O2 are also active to the decomposition, which largely reduces the productivity of H2O2.[24] In the epoxidation process of propene using H2O2, oxygen formation of decomposition reaction prevents the H2O2 from introducing the epoxidation reactor, which delays the subsequent purification step and increases the risk of explosion accident. Moreover, OH* can react with organic compounds of the epoxidation effluent reducing the productivity.[7] Particularly, thermal decomposition during storage and transport and the associated heat generation can potentially accelerate the decomposition. Therefore, a trade-off balance between the benefits and drawbacks of the H2O2 decomposition necessitates more efforts to thoroughly understand the reaction kinetics and explore the possible governing factors. Recently, various analytical methods have been developed to determine the decomposition rate of H2O2.[26-35] In a previous study, H2O2 concentration was determined using spectrophotometry.[26] It was found that Fe3+ concentration can significantly affect the H2O2 decomposition rate in Fenton regent where the maximum rate constant occurs at pH = 3.2. In another work, the effect of species of acid on H2O2 decomposition rate was investigated through monitoring the volume change of oxygen using a gas collector. The anion types of different acids can effectively suppress the H2O2 decomposition activity over catalyst.[27] As an exothermic reaction, H2O2 decomposition could potentially cause temperature rising without appropriate thermal control, which would bring in data inaccuracy or even safety hazards. Due to excellent heat transfer performance, microreactor technology has become a powerful tool to accurately characterize thermal decomposition of liquid–gas reactions such as H2O2 system. A microfluidic method has been developed to study the kinetics of H2O2 decomposition using titration to determine sample concentration. It was found that the decomposition rate is sensitive to materials of microreactors and increases with increasing molar ration of catalyst to H2O2.[30] However, such ex-situ analytical methods, e.g. spectrophotometry and titration require operators to collect effluent samples and conduct subsequent analysis. These invasive operations are relatively time-consuming and lack of accuracy due to the likely disturbance of local equilibrium or kinetics caused by sampling. Microfluidic method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become a mainstream method for efficiently gathering reaction kinetic data.[36-39] The decomposition kinetics of a reactive textile dye was determined and a coupling model of mass transfer-reaction was established.[38] Compared with titration and spectrophotometry, the HPLC analysis can provide a more precise measurement for kinetic data due to high sensitivity for low sample concentration, which strikingly fits the advantage of sample miniaturization of microfluidics. Recently, bright-field microscopy as a non-invasive technique has been extensively applied in characterizing kinetic phenomena.[40-42] This optical method can monitor and investigate dynamic processes of kinetic behaviors in transparent microchip without taking sample for subsequent analysis providing accurate measurement for kinetic data like HPLC method. Hence, an in-situ characterization method using bright-field microscopy and microfluidics was conceived for measuring H2O2 decomposition. In the present work, an established characterizing approach of real-time monitoring bubble growth to express the kinetics or phase behavior was introduced.[40,42,43] Specifically, the rate of H2O2 decomposition was determined by measuring the growing size of oxygen bubble along time. Furthermore, this work systematically investigated the effects of temperature, mass fraction, light intensity, and pH value on H2O2 decomposition. The obtained data on different experimental conditions provide guiding significance to practical operations involving H2O2. It is expected that this in-situ approach can provide more accurate and fast measurement for H2O2 decomposition, which can be extended to characterize the reaction kinetics of such gas–liquid system containing only one gas component. In addition, we performed the reaction density functional theory (RxDFT) to investigate the solvent effect on the decomposition of H2O2."
1,Experimental and computational sections,
2,Microfluidic setup,"2.1 Microfluidic setup The microchip was fabricated by sealing two layers of poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheets using a thermal press and mounted in a customized manifold with fittings to connect external tubing. All the features on PMMA sheet were engraved via micromilling with a CNC machine (Jing Yan Instrument Desktop CNC 3020). Fig. 1 a shows a schematic of the microchip and the profile of cross-section. The microchannel was characterized with optical profiler (Subnano Instruments NanoX-2000) prior to sealing. The channel depth and width were 144.6 μm and 677.8 μm, respectively, with 0.6 μm surface roughness. H2O2 solutions with different concentrations were prepared by mixing 30 wt% H2O2 (Shanghai Titan) with deionized water. As depicted in Fig. 1b, H2O2 solution was loaded and delivered by a plastic injection syringe (EYOUNG 1 mL). The microchannel was thoroughly cleaned by nitrogen before each experiment. Thereafter, the H2O2 solution was injected into the microchip. The injection was stopped until the microchannel was full of H2O2 solution to eliminate the effect of convection on bubble growth. The amount of injected H2O2 is 2.9 μL which is equal to the liquid holdup of microchannel. All the observing and measuring operations were conducted under quasi-static condition. The tubes used to transport H2O2 were made of Teflon instead of metals to diminish the catalysis effect on H2O2 decomposition, which can avoid that oxygen accumulate in tube preventing H2O2 from flowing into microchannel. The temperature control was provided and controlled by a circulator bath. The local temperature fluctuations in channel upon H2O2 entering and decomposing in microchannel were monitored by a temperature sensor. The pressure of reaction system was controlled and recorded by a back pressure regulator (BPR) and a pressure sensor, respectively. A cooling trap was used to collect effluent and immediately quench the decomposition to prohibit oxygen and water vapor flowing into reaction system through tubes."
3,Data obtaining and processing,"2.2 Data obtaining and processing Bubble growth in channel was observed by a bright-field microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-U) equipped with a 4 × objective lens and recorded with a CMOS camera (pco. panda 4.2 M−USB−PCO). The location of bubble was stationary during the process of image acquisition. The wavelength of light resource (Cool LED pE-300) was in the visible region and the light intensity was measured by an optical power meter. The image recording frequency was adapted to each case of rate to cover the entire process of bubble growth, ranging from 40 to 10 frames per second. Obtained raw image sequences were imported to a commercial software (IMAGEJ) for image processing. Fig. 2 a shows typical images of decomposition process in microchannel where the bubble grows gradually with time lapsing. The image sequences represent the processes of bubble growth at the light intensity with 205.0 W/m2 (the left) and 728.5 W/m2 (the right), respectively. The procedure of image processing is shown in Fig. 2 b. Specifically, the contrast of raw images was firstly enhanced to make bubbles more distinguishable (Fig. 2 b, ii). Image binarization processing was then employed by setting a threshold value to split image pixels into two different gray values representing liquid and gas phases, respectively (Fig. 2 b, iii). Only the pixels representing gas bubble were used for dimension conversion and corresponding analysis (Fig. 2 b, iv)."
4,Determining the decomposition kinetics,"2.3 Determining the decomposition kinetics The nucleation and growth of bubbles attributed to H2O2 decomposition can be described as the following equation: (1) H 2 O 2 → H 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 The bubbles observed in microchannel can be recognized as oxygen exclusively since there is no other gas produced. Hence the rate of bubble growth can be used to calculate the rate of H2O2 decomposition. It is noteworthy that we make certain reasonable assumptions here: (i) Oxygen is treated as ideal gas. (ii) The volatility of H2O2 with low concentration is as similar as water which is neglected in the microchannel (iii) The volume of H2O2 is regarded as constant since the yield of oxygen is extremely small (from 1‱ to 1‰) with respect to the amount of H2O2 in the microchannel. (iv) The pressure within the bubbles is considered as equal to the pressure of the quasi-static fluid system. The effect of pressure on the bubble growth is ignored since the pressure fluctuation is only about 5‰ of the system pressure ( Figure S1 ). (v) The influence of heat generated by bubble expansion on gas state is neglected since reaction heat can be fast removed by liquid whose amount is much larger than the gas. (vi) The effect of liquid–vapor surface on reaction rate can be neglected since the generation of oxygen in liquid phase takes much less time to transfer across the liquid–vapor interface into bubble (less than 1 s)[44] than reaction time(~15 s). Based on the assumption (i), the ideal gas law can be applied to express the increasing amount of oxygen along time: (2) p d V O 2 dt = d n O 2 dt R T The reaction can be assumed as zeroth order with respect to oxygen in our experiment when the initial mass fraction of H2O2 is lower than 35.5%.[30,45] Hence, for zeroth order reaction, the reaction kinetics can be described as the following equation: (3) d c O 2 dt = k 0 By dividing the volume of microchannel, Eq. (2) can be transformed into Eq. (4) (4) p d V O 2 Vdt = R T d c O 2 dt where V is the volume of H2O2 solution in microchannel which can be calculated with the profile map (Fig. 1 b), giving a value of 2.9 μL; c O 2 is the concentration of oxygen in a single bubble from H2O2 decomposition; k 0 is the reaction rate based on assumption of zeroth order reaction. H2O term could be neglected as it is used as solvent in this work, amount of which remains constant. Combing Eqs. (3) and (4), k 0 can be expressed as: (5) k 0 = p RT d V O 2 Vdt As p, T, and V are constants on each test, k 0 can be obtained by fitting the variation of volume of bubble versus reaction time. Additionally, the kinetic model of H2O2 decomposition can be considered as first or second order reaction.[14-23] Hence, similarly, for first order reaction, Eq. (5) can be converted into the following equation: (6) k 1 = d ln V O 2 dt where k 1 is the reaction rate based on assumption of first order reaction. The second order reaction was not analyzed further due to a poor performance of fitting result ( Figure S2 ). In other words, the kinetic model of H2O2 decomposition does not obey second order rate law in this work. Therefore, first and zeroth order reaction models were systematically investigated providing accurate reaction rate constants of H2O2 decomposition for different experimental conditions."
5,Theory and computational details,"2.4 Theory and computational details Very recently, we developed the RxDFT for calculating the reaction free energy in liquid solvent. The RxDFT has been constructed by combining quantum DFT for calculating intrinsic free energy with classical DFT for addressing the solvent effect.[46-50] Within the theoretical framework of RxDFT,[48] the reaction free energy in liquid solvent, F R , can be expressed as: (7) F R = E R + Δ F sol where E R denotes the intrinsic reaction free energy in solution, and Δ F sol denotes the difference between the solvation free energy of product and reactant. E R can be computed with quantum DFT, and the computational details are presented in supporting information . Δ F sol can be calculated through the classical DFT: (8) F sol ρ ( x ) = k B T ∫ ρ ( x ) ln ρ ( x ) ρ 0 - ρ ( x ) + ρ 0 d x + ∫ ρ ( x ) V ext ( x ) d x - 1 2 k B T ∬ d x 1 d x 2 Δ ρ x 1 Δ ρ x 2 c ( 2 ) x 1 , x 2 ; ρ 0 where ρ ( x ) denotes the density distribution of solvent molecule near the solute molecule, and here x = (r, Ω) refers to the position and spatial orientation of solvent molecules. V ext ( x ) stands for the external potential that originates from the interaction between the solvent molecule and solute molecule, and it comprises typically the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulomb contributions:[51] (9) V ext ( r , Ω ) = ∑ i a ∑ j b 4 ε ij σ ij r ij 12 - σ ij r ij 6 + q i q j 4 π ε 0 r ij where i and j are the atoms (sites) in solute and water molecule, respectively; r ij represents the interatomic separation; q i and q j are the partial charges carried by both atoms. We adopted the SPC/E model to describe the liquid water molecule,[52] and the optimized potentials for liquid simulation all-atom (OPLS-AA) force field were employed to give the LJ parameters of H2O2 molecule (collected in Table 1 ).[53] The conventional Lorentz-Berthelot combination rule was used to generate the LJ parameters for the crossed pairs, namely ε ij = ε i ε j and σ ij = ( σ i + σ j ) / 2 . The charge distributions on molecules were calculated by fitting the individual (atomic) charges, centered at atomic positions, to the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP), which was computed from the quantum mechanical wave function. The MDFT calculation was performed with the homemade code[51,54] in a cubic box of size L = 100 Å."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of temperature on decomposition kinetics,"3.1 Effect of temperature on decomposition kinetics 30 wt% H2O2 solution was used to study the decomposition kinetics at 25, 30, and 35 ℃. The temperature fluctuation can be ignored (about 8‰ of the setting temperature) beneficial from microscale channel with respect to large thermal load of centimeter-level PMMA chip as well as highly effective heat transfer of microchips ( Figure S3 ). The experimental observation was conducted under the light intensity of 0.9 W/m2 which is the smallest light intensity ensuring a good image quality. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of bubble volume under the three temperature conditions. It should be noted that data points shown in Fig. 3 were extracted from original experimental data with equal intervals in order to prevent overcrowded original data point shown in figure from affecting the display quality. Meanwhile, the values of volume shown in figure are the results of normalized processing by subtracting the initial value of bubble volume. The calculated reaction constants based on Eqs. (5) and (6) display in Table 2. Each value of reaction constant was calculated as the average of three independent experiments with identical condition for repetition purpose and all the calculate kinetic data of each experiment are presented in Tables S1-S7 in supporting information . Determination coefficients (R2) were calculated by fitting the experimental data using different kinetic models to select reasonable reaction order for describing decomposition kinetics under different operation conditions. As shown in Table 2, the values of R2 based on assumption of zeroth order reaction (~0.99) are obviously higher than that of first order reaction (~0.91) in three different temperatures. Hence, it can be concluded that the 30 wt% H2O2 decomposition reaction tends to be zeroth order reaction with respect to oxygen in the temperature ranging from 25 ℃ to 35 ℃ in a low light intensity (0.9 W/m2). The zeroth order reaction rates were studied, displaying an increasing trend with increasing temperature. The Arrhenius equation was used to investigate the effect of temperature on reaction rate: (10) ln k = ln A - E a RT where A and E a are the pre-exponential factor and activation energy, respectively. A linear regression fitting algorithm was applied to determine the relationship between ln k and 1/T, which is shown in Fig. 4 . The activation energy of H2O2 decomposition can be calculated from the slope of fitted curve, giving a value of 71.0 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential factor is 4.4 × 107 mol L-1 s−1."
8,Effect of mass fraction on decomposition kinetics,"3.2 Effect of mass fraction on decomposition kinetics Having investigated the temperature influencing reaction kinetics, the effect of mass fraction was considered by determining the decomposition rate of 10 wt% and 3 wt% H2O2 solution. The mass fractions of diluted H2O2 solutions were calibrated by titrating with cerium sulfate solution. The variations of bubble volume at different temperatures and mass fractions based on assumption of zeroth and first order reaction are presented in Fig. 5 and Figure S4 , respectively. The result shows that the variations of bubble volume in the 10 wt% and 3 wt% H2O2 solutions present a similar ascend trend as that in the 30 wt% H2O2 solution. According to fitting performance, the more appropriate reaction order was determined in this case. The results of R2 shown in Table 2 indicate that zeroth order reaction model remains reasonable under relatively low mass fraction of H2O2 solution. Based on zeroth order model, the reaction rates, k0 , were obtained and displayed in Table 2. The values of k0 both increase as the temperature increases in two different mass fractions. Furthermore, the values of standard deviation (SD) among the different calculated k of each experiment at same mass fraction and temperature are displayed in Table S8 . The temperature effect was investigated using Eq. (10) based on the linear fitted curves shown in Figure S6 . The activation energy values of H2O2 decomposition reaction at 3 wt% and 10 wt% are 233.1 kJ/mol and 148.2 kJ/mol, respectively. Compared with the results of 30 wt% H2O2, the values of activation energy exhibit a significant increasing trend with initial mass fraction decreasing. Activation energy reflects the difficulty of a reaction proceeding. In terms of microscale, higher concentration which indicates more molecules of H2O2 in unit volume enhances the probability of effective collision among molecules. The increasing probability of molecular collision results in that molecules climb over energy barrier faster, making reaction occur more easily. Therefore, H2O2 with high initial mass fraction is prone to decompose. Fig. 6 shows the effect of H2O2 mass fraction on the reaction rate constant. The reaction rate constant increases with mass fraction decreasing under 30 ℃ and 35 ℃ which may result from the step-reactions of H2O2. The following consecutive reaction [55] can be used to understand the H2O2 decomposition mechanism under illumination which may explain the relation between reaction rate and initial mass fraction: (11) H 2 O 2 + h v → 2 O H ∗ (12) H 2 O 2 + O H ∗ → H O O ∗ + H 2 O (13) H 2 O 2 + H O O ∗ → O H ∗ + H 2 O + O 2 (14) 2 H O O ∗ → H 2 O 2 + O 2 At low mass fraction, the photon absorption efficiency of H2O2 is higher due to less amount of molecule in per volume, which speeds up the hydroxyl radical (OH*) formation (Eq. (11)), contributing to H2O2 decomposition in the entire reaction progress. Similar result has been proved through detecting the decomposition of H2O2 in soil, where the efficiency of OH* formation is higher at lower concentration of H2O2. [31] Therefore, the reaction rate constants of H2O2 decomposition are dependent of initial H2O2 mass fraction at relatively higher temperature. In contrast, the reaction rate constant does not present an upward trend with initial mass fraction increasing in 25 ℃ (as shown in Fig. 6). It can be speculated that the efficiency of OH* production dictates the decomposition of H2O2. Under the temperature of 25 ℃, the reaction rate constant changes slightly as mass fraction changes, which can be explained by the quantum yield of H2O2 decomposition which defines the number of moles decomposed by H2O2 at per mole of light photon absorbed.[56] Under relatively low temperature (25 ℃), the quantum yield is so low that the rate of OH* production decreases rapidly, causing that H2O2 decomposition becomes slow and shows a change independent of mass fraction.[55-59] These findings about decomposition kinetics in different H2O2 mass fractions may provide a practical guidance in selecting appropriate concentration of H2O2 in environmental protection fulfilling the process optimization of high pollution removal efficiency. For example, in the process of desulfuration and denitration from industrial exhaust gas, the most suitable concentration of H2O2 is 15 wt% for best absorption efficiency.[9] On one hand, H2O2 with excessive high concentration tends to decompose which is the side reaction of the absorption of NO and SO2, causing the reduction of absorption efficiency. On the other hand, H2O2 with low concentration can be easily consumed within long residence time, reducing the amount of exhaust gas absorption. Therefore, it is important to investigate reaction kinetics at different H2O2 concentrations. Based on assumption of zeroth order reaction model, the kinetic data measured in our work were compared with some other works, as shown in Table 3 . The k0 values determined in our work are significantly smaller than that of Shang et al.[30] This large difference between the k0 is mostly caused by the high reaction temperature (95–105 ℃). Nevertheless, the k0 values of this work approximate that of Lousada et al.[19] when the reaction temperature is 25 ℃, which further reveals the great influence of temperature on reaction rate. Meanwhile, the activation energy values of the other two works are much smaller than that of our work, indicating an essential role of catalyst in H2O2 decomposition."
9,Free energy calculation with RxDFT method,"3.3 Free energy calculation with RxDFT method The H2O2 decomposition mechanism in different mass fractions is collected in previous sections. In this work, the rate of oxygen bubble growth was used to examine the rate of H2O2 decomposition. Hence, we chose the reactions involving the participation and generation of oxygen, i.e., HOO* + HOOH → OH* + H2O + O2, HOO* + OH* →H2O + O2, and HOO* + HOO* →HOOH + O2. The optimized structures of reactant, transition state, and product for these reactions are displayed in Fig. 7 . To study the solvent effect on the decomposition of H2O2, we investigated the above three reactions in the gas phase and aqueous solution. In aqueous solution, we calculated the free energy by using quantum DFT with the SMD solvation model and RxDFT method. The relative free energy profiles are displayed in Fig. 7. Compared with the free energy in the gas phase, the free energy calculated by the SMD model increases the free energy slightly. This is because the SMD model is a polarized continuum model (PCM) and the solute molecules are small molecules or free radical. In addition, RxDFT can capture an complex with lower energy (complex 2 in HOO* + OH* →H2O + O2 reaction) that are not in the quantum DFT with SMD solvation model. As shown in Fig. 7, the relative free energy barriers of HOO* + HOOH → OH* + H2O + O2, HOO* + OH* →H2O + O2, HOO* + HOO* →HOOH + O2 reaction are 43.8, 122.7, and 165.6 kJ/mol, respectively, in aqueous solution. Therefore, the HOO* + HOO* →HOOH + O2 reaction is the rate-determining step (RDS) and the free energy barriers in aqueous solution have a significant enhancement for the H2O2 decomposition. This scenario also appeared in the HOO* + OH* →H2O + O2 reaction. Furthermore, in 3 wt%, 10 wt%, and 30 wt% H2O2 solution, the decomposition activation energies of H2O2 calculated by experiment data are 233.1, 148.2, and 71.0 kJ/mol, respectively. In other words, the presence of water is not conducive to the decomposition of H2O2, which agrees well with the results of RxDFT."
10,Effect of light intensity on decomposition kinetics,"3.4 Effect of light intensity on decomposition kinetics H2O2 widely participates in photochemistry, such as atmospheric and water pollution prevent, energy reservation, and photocatalysis production for H2O2.[60-65] These processes inevitably involve illumination induced H2O2 decomposition. Hence, illumination was introduced as the experimental condition to study effects of light intensity on decomposition rate. The light intensity was directly measured at the focal plane of the incident light, which coincides with the microchannel’s position. The measured light intensity is a result of considering power losses from light source to focal plane of incident light, which is more reasonable to be used as experiment parameter than the electrical power of light intensity. The decomposition reactions were measured at the light intensity of 205.0, 498.5, 728.5 W/m2, respectively. It is noted that light intensity was quantified by controlling the power of light source, resulting in that the value does not increase linearly due to the nonlinear attenuation of light intensity through optical lens of microscope. Meanwhile, the effects of light intensity on activation energy were studied. By fitting the bubble growth curves (Fig. 8 ) at different light intensities and temperatures, we found that the first order reaction model is more applicable to describe the H2O2 decomposition under the relatively stronger light intensity (≥205.0 W/m2) based on the values of R2 (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, the value of first reaction rate constant, k 1 increases gradually with increment of light intensity at the same temperature (Fig. 9 ). This enhancing effect on decomposition may be explained through photolysis mechanism of H2O2 (Eqs. (11)-(14)) that stronger light intensity delivers more energy for the absorption of H2O2, promoting the formation of OH*. As discussed in previous section, the rate of OH* formation can greatly influence the entire decomposition reaction, thus leading to incremental rate constants. The values of SD of the calculate k1 which are less than 15% ( Table S8 ), indicating a good measurement accuracy. Furthermore, a linear fitting method was employed to quantitatively analyze the effect of light intensity on reaction rate constant, which can be described as the following equation: (15) k 1 = η I + b where η is the slope of the fitted curve which represents the degree of influence of light intensity on reaction rate constant; I is the value of light intensity. The specific data are shown in Table 4 . It can be seen that R2 values are larger than 0.99 showing good fitting performance, which indicates the equation can reasonably describe the relationship between rate constant and light intensity in the range of 205.0 to 728.5 W/m2. In addition, the value of η under 35 ℃ is smaller than that under 25℃ and 30 ℃, indicating the less influence of light intensity in relatively higher temperature. The activation energy value was calculated based on linear fitted curve between lnk and 1/T ( Figure S7 ) giving a value of 69.0, 61.4, 18.8 kJ/mol at 205.0, 498.5, 728.5 W/m2, respectively, decreases with light intensity increasing and is much smaller than that of reaction with low light intensity. The result suggests that the light intensity acting as a catalyst plays important role in promoting H2O2 decomposition. In addition, we compared the kinetic data in our work with some other works, as shown in Table 5 . The k1 values in these works vary significantly due to different catalytic methods selected. The values of activation energy under the strong intensity are similar to the cases that catalysts were utilized, which demonstrates a catalysis of strong light intensity for H2O2 decomposition. Moreover, in this case, the values of zeroth order reaction rate constant can be used to describe the decomposition rate due to a good fitting performance (Table 2), so k0 values at stronger light intensities are reasonable to be used to compare with that in low light intensity. The volume change of oxygen bubble versus time based on assumption of zeroth order reaction which is not suitable for describing reaction model under strong light intensity is shown in Figure S5 . In comparison, the amplification of rate constant at relatively stronger light intensity is less notable. Specifically, k0 value is 4.1 × 10-4 mol L-1 s−1 at 205.0 W/m2, which is about 24 times than the value (1.7 × 10-5 mol L-1s−1) at 0.9 W/m2 while k0 is 2.6 × 10-4 mol L-1 s−1 at 728.5 W/m2 which is found to be five times than that in 205.0 W/m2. The larger amplification of light intensity instead weakens the increasing trend of reaction rate, which suggests that the catalysis effect of light on H2O2 decomposition decreases with light intensity increasing. This phenomenon is attributable to the decreasing efficiency of photolysis of H2O2, as presented in Eq. (11). Strong light intensity extremely accelerates the formation of OH*, and the local concentration of OH* reaches to saturation rapidly, resulting in that the reaction of Eq. (11) reaches equilibrium. In a dynamic perspective, the entire decomposition process of H2O2 gradually achieves equilibrium, reducing the rate of growth of reaction rate. In conclusion, strong light can catalyze H2O2 decomposition and the catalytic effect decreases with increasing light intensity. Therefore, it is critical to select an appropriate light intensity in order to reach the best performance of H2O2 in photochemical reaction efficiency achieving process optimization. And meanwhile, the factor of light intensity must be taken into consideration during the preservation of H2O2."
11,Effect of pH on decomposition kinetics,"3.5 Effect of pH on decomposition kinetics During the application of H2O2, the pH values of reaction environment can notably influence the reaction efficiency.[27,66] Hence, the decomposition performance of H2O2 in different pH values was investigated in this section. We can consider H2O2 decomposition has negligible effect on pH since the amount of generated water is much smaller than that of H2O2 solution, which has little influence on hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in bulk solution. In the meantime, the local H+ concentration can be treated as constant due to a dynamic equilibrium between the diffusion of unreacted H2O2 and reaction of consumed H2O2 around the bubble, enabling the local H2O2 concentrations of H2O2 and H+ to keep constant. The effect of pH on decomposition reaction rate is presented in Fig. 10 and the values of SD of the calculate k in this section are shown in Table S9 . The highest reaction rate is obtained at pH = 4, and it is dependent of pH ranging from pH = 1 to pH = 5. At low pH conditions, the H2O2 can combine with H+ to form the oxonium ion (H3O2 +), as shown in Eq. (16), which suppresses the initial decomposition of H2O2 (Eq. (11)) due to the high concentration hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. And meanwhile, the OH* can be scavenged by excess H+, as shown in Eq. (17), impeding the oxidation of H2O2 (Eq. (12)). Thus, the interplay of the two reactions leads a low decomposition rate of H2O2 at highly acidic condition.[66,67] However, the reaction rate has declined at relatively high pH since the reaction between OH* and HO2 - (Eq. (18)) is an unfavorable side reaction of Eq. (12). Furthermore, OH* reacts with HO2 - much faster than it reacts with H2O2 at lowly acidic condition, slowing the decomposition of H2O2 [56]. Therefore, the obtained maximum reaction rate at pH = 4 is a result of synergetic effect of Eqs. (16)-(18). These measured rate constants at different pH may offer a practical guidance in water treatment using H2O2, eg. adjusting wastewater to most suitable pH value for best pollution process efficiency to accomplish process optimization.

12,Conclusions,"This work has demonstrated a microfluidic based in-situ approach to study the decomposition reaction kinetics of H2O2 by associating volume change of oxygen bubble with decomposition of H2O2. A linear fitting method was employed to calculate reaction rate constants and determine the reaction orders based on fitting performance. Four important factors, namely temperature, mass fraction, light intensity and pH which influence the decomposition kinetics of H2O2 were investigated. First with respect to temperature, the reaction rate constant increased with increasing temperature ranging from 25 ℃ to 35 ℃. The mass fraction of H2O2 varied from 3 to 30 wt% and it was found that reaction rate constant varied insignificantly with increasing mass fraction at relatively low temperature (25 ℃). However, at the temperature of 30 ℃ and 35 ℃, reaction rate constant exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing mass fraction. Meanwhile, the activation energy increased with mass fraction decreasing, which was further proved by DFT calculation. In this case, the reaction obeyed zeroth order with respect to oxygen at different mass fractions with a low light intensity (0.9 W/m2). Nevertheless, when the light intensity was elevated to a high level (205.0, 498.5, and 728.5 W/m2), we found that the reaction converted into first order with respect to oxygen. Furthermore, increasing light intensity can dramatically promote the decomposition and reduce the activation energy, suggesting a catalytic effect. Lastly, the decomposition rate was found to be dependent on solution acidity ranging from pH = 1 to 5 and reached maximum at pH = 4. This microfluidic method which successfully characterized the kinetics of H2O2 decomposition is expected to extend for studying other liquid-to-gas reaction systems containing single gas component. Furthermore, the results of kinetics study provide deep insights into the factors influencing H2O2 decomposition, which is beneficial for improving the efficiency of reactions involving H2O2, realizing process optimization, especially in environmental protection and photochemical reaction."
