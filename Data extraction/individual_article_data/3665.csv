0,Introduction,"The conversion of biomass into various value-added biochemical, including biofuel, is generally termed as biomass valorization [1]. This phrase has been widely used in recent research publications, indicating the shift of global research focal point to the alternative sources for producing chemicals and bioenergy, which could be derived from the waste. Annually, hundreds billion tonnes of lignocellulosic biomass waste are produced but they are usually neglected via disposal on landfill or through burning [2]. These practices do not contribute to any economic benefits to the industry and at the same time do not fully utilize the biomass despite its abundance in mass. The availability of lignocellulosic biomass is not limited by geographical distribution, hence making it a promising feedstock for biofuel production and other value-added products [3,4]. Furthermore, the abundance of agricultural residues, which could be acquired at low cost, making it a better and more promising option as a raw feedstock in sugar platform biorefinery [5,6]. To date, more and more research on the valorization of agricultural residual into biofuel has attracted great attention, mainly due to the positive effects from both economic and environmental aspects and long- term energy sustainability with greenhouse gas mitigation [7,8]. Therefore, the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass for the value-added products and biofuel productions could potentially relieve the stresses to the natural resources and shift the dependencies of fossil fuel to sustainable energy sources. Lignocellulosic biomass is a complex structure of carbohydrate polymers which consist of cellulose (38–50%), hemicellulose (23–32%), and aromatic polymer lignin (15–25%) [9]. Cellulose is a strong molecular structure in biomass, which is formed by long chains glucose monomeric units connecting via β-glycosidic linkages with reducing and non-reducing ends [10]. These cellulose microfibrils which possess both amorphous and crystalline properties are then stacked in parallel due to the presence of hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals forces. Thereafter, these microfibrils are interlaced together with hemicellulose and lignin to form macrofibrils [11]. As a result, access to cellulose by chemical or enzymatic means is difficult due to the presence of complex linkages network and hydrogen bonding [12]. Hemicellulose is considered an amorphous polymer, which is a cluster of heterogeneous polysaccharides with a mix of hexose and pentose monosaccharides [13–16]. When chemicals and/or heat are applied, hemicellulose is relatively easier to dissociate as compared to cellulose [17]. Typically, softwood based biomass contains mainly glucomannans and mannans, while xylan (β-(1,4)-linked xylose homopolymer) are usually found in hardwood based biomass [10]. Therefore, both cellulose and hemicellulose contribute to most of the sugar present in the biomass. Lignin is a hydrophobic polymer composed of several cross-linked polymer of phenolic substances [18], bounded to the hemicellulose and cellulose in a complex polymer matrix which acts as a physical barrier against microbial attack as well as provides structural support to the plant cell [14–16,19]. Lignin contains a number of functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and methoxyl in the lignin matrix, which contribute to high polarity of lignin macromolecule [20]. These recalcitrance properties of plant biomass prevent enzymes from accessing the carbohydrate substrate [5]. In general, pretreatments to overcome lignocellulosic recalcitrance are costly and sometimes involve inhibitors to the biofuels conversion [21], hence hindering the development of an economically viable process to convert biomass to biofuels or other valuable products [22]. A lot of research has revealed the negative effect of lignin during enzymatic digestion of biomass. Therefore, an effective lignin extraction or disruption could significantly alter the structural matrix and crystallinity of cellulose and ultimately enhance biomass saccharification in fermentation [14–16,19]. A typical biorefinery processing of lignocellulosic biomass involves pretreatment step, subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis to disintegrate polysaccharides, and fermentation of released sugar solution to produce biofuels and biochemical products [7,8]. In order to facilitate downstream biorefinery of lignocellulosic biomass, a variety of pretreatment stage has been proposed to overcome the recalcitrant structure of biomass by disrupting carbohydrate matrix and disintegrate high molecular structures like lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose into smaller compounds, such as monosaccharides, organic acids, and phenolic compounds [22,23]. A wide range of biomass fractionation approaches have been studied, such as chemical (alkali, dilute acid, organic solvent), physical (grinding, milling, irradiation), physiochemical (wet oxidation, auto-hydrolysis), and biochemical methods [11]. To date, the disruption of the complex polymer matrix to release monosaccharides remained as the main issue for effective utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. Thus, methods that improve the biomass digestibility for subsequent enzymatic or microbial attack have gain greater attention in the recent years [24]. Recent research discovers that alkaline peroxide is widely used in biomass saccharification process due to the effective generation of radicals and its extraordinary performance in delignification in most crop residue with little sugar degradation and furan derivatives production as compared to the other pretreatment approaches [13,15,16,25–28]. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is commonly used in pulping and bleaching industries. By tuning the peroxide solution to alkaline using hydroxide ions (OH−), radical species (e.g., HO and HOO) and molecular oxygen are formed as a result of H2O2 decomposition, which in turn selectively react with lignin in several reaction pathways, resulting in complicated total oxidation reaction mechanism and leading to high delignification [5,29]. A lot of research has confirmed the rate and extent of enzymatic hydrolysis or microbial digestion are inversely proportional to lignin content in the biomass [5,26]. The excellent delignification using alkaline peroxide is not the only reason why researchers are paying more attention in biomass valorization for the past decades. Unlike acid or alkaline pretreatment, alkaline peroxide pretreatment can be performed at relatively milder conditions (concentration, temperature) and at atmospheric pressure, while effectively removing lignin from various agricultural residues [24]. Furthermore, alkaline peroxide is a relatively “green” reagent with low environmental impact as it can be easily decomposed to yield water and oxygen as end products. To the best of our knowledge, although alkaline hydrogen peroxide has received significant attention and been applied in various research field, in-depth literature reviews specifically target on the recent applications of alkaline hydrogen peroxide in biomass valorization are still limited [30,31]. Thus, this review paper serves to compile, highlight, and discuss the vast potential, technoeconomic feasibility and role of alkaline hydrogen peroxide as one of the pretreatment technologies in biomass transformation and processing."
1,Alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) in biomass processing,
2,Background information of AHP,"2.1 Background information of AHP There is often solutions available in the nature to tackle most of the research problem, which offer the potential approaches that mimic the natural processes in the biosphere as effective strategies. According to Li et al. [8], oxidative deconstruction of plant cell wall by aerobic saprophytes is commonly seen in the nature, which is potentially important to offer a direct effective pretreatment method. However, the understanding to the carbon and energy propagation pathways is still incomplete. Particularly, brown rot fungi was proposed to use a non-enzymatic mechanism to selectively alter lignin and cellulose by using hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide through Fenton chemistry [32] as a result of plant cell wall polymer oxidation [8]. Oxidative pretreatment approaches that implement effective trait of biological deconstruction routes of biomass are more likely to induce synergism with biological conversion [8]. Over the past decades, various oxidizing agents used in the pretreatments are developed, such as peracids [33], organic peroxides [34], oxygen [35], ozone [36], and hydrogen peroxide [37] (Table 1 ). Recent research has shown inclination towards the uses of AHP in biomass pretreatments due to its excellent delignification effect in lignocellulosic biomass while retaining carbohydrates that are highly susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation [38]. Under normal circumstances, hydrogen peroxide can only react with aliphatic part of lignin, while no changes and degradation of phenolic compounds are observed [39]. However, hydrogen peroxide is able to attack the phenolic compounds when it is used under alkaline conditions and heated to a relatively high temperature, which will expose the phenolic ring and cause carboxylic groups to be added to the macromolecular structure [5,40]. Such alteration of biomass structure by AHP pretreatment has led to effective lignin and xylan removals, while decreasing cellulose crystallinity as well as swelling of biomass due to the insertion of polar groups into the molecule [41]."
3,Reaction mechanism,"2.2 Reaction mechanism The extent of AHP pretreatments relies on the H2O2 decomposition and its intermediate products which act as an initiator for various oxidative reactions with biomass components. The decompositions of hydrogen peroxide can be further improved with the absence of stabilizer, such as MgSO4 or sodium silicate and the presence of heavy-metal ions [42]. Under alkaline conditions specifically close to pH 11.5, hydrogen peroxide will dissociate to produce hydroperoxyl anion (HOO−), which is responsible for the corresponding carbonyl and ethylene groups’ oxidative reactions and initiator for radicals forming. Thus, AHP pretreatment for delignification is strongly pH-dependent with optimum pH of 11.5–11.6 which is the pKa for the H2O2 decomposition reaction [37]. These HOO− will react with hydrogen peroxide to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO) and superoxide anion radical (O2 − ) [43], which are known to be strong oxidants for promoting lignin oxidization and depolymerizing biomass into low molecular weight fragments [7,42]. According to Cabrera et al. [24], no significant lignin alteration in biomass structure under low alkalinity condition was reported. It was claimed that only aliphatic part of lignin was oxidized in low alkalinity conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness of delignification strongly depends on the pH employed during the reaction in order to promote the H2O2 derived radicals. Fig. 1 shows the reactions illustration of hydrogen peroxide decomposition in alkaline conditions and the generation of highly reactive radicals as described above. These radicals generated from the H2O2 dissociation in alkaline conditions are responsible for depolymerizing lignin through cleaving and fragmenting lignin macrostructure into smaller compounds [7,24,42]. As mentioned by Li et al. [8], such pretreatment was effective in enhancing the dissolution of grass lignins due to the destruction of ester, ether cross-links as well as cleavage of β-O-4 bonds within the lignin. On top of that, AHP pretreatment can also cause a significant amount of hemicellulose solubilization [22]. However, undesired cellulose depolymerization is also present in delignification, depending on the operational variables used. Thus, optimizations of peroxide loading, reaction duration, and temperature are to be carried out for different biomass to achieve efficient biomass fractionation [42]."
4,Recent applications of AHP in biomass processing,"2.3 Recent applications of AHP in biomass processing Generally, one or more pretreatment stages are essential for effective hydrolysis of biomass to overcome the recalcitrance nature of biomass before introducing subsequent fermentation. A past study showed that biomass without undergoing a pretreatment stage would result in a sugar yield of 21% [8]. However, the sugar yield could be increased up to 98% by implementing a pretreatment step prior to hydrolysis [5]. Recent literature has shown an inclined trend of AHP in biomass dissolution application and revealed the potential of AHP as one of the economically viable pretreatment process. An effective pretreatment stage is achieved through the disintegration of lignin in the biomass structure, leading to the increase in accessibility of polysaccharides during hydrolysis. AHP is particularly effective in enhancing the glucose yield in the subsequent hydrolysis due to its ability to solubilize lignin and hemicellulose, which are the two protective barrier to cellulose [8,22]. Table 2 summarizes several available past studies regarding the application of AHP in biomass delignification and sugar recovery. AHP is highly dependent on the operational variables whereby undesired cellulose depolymerization can occur. Therefore, optimizations are carried out to specifically target different biomass for efficient fractionation [42]. Cabrera et al. [24] reported that AHP showed no significant effect in biomass structure alteration under low alkalinity conditions, as only aliphatic part of lignin was oxidized. The efficiency of AHP in delignification was highly dependent on the promotions of H2O2 derived radicals, which could be affected by the reaction conditions. Moreover, Li et al. [21] revealed that AHP caused delignification and increase in cellulose crystallinity in pretreated biomass because AHP was able to selectively target lignin via radical formation under alkaline conditions. These intermediate products formed as a result of decomposition of H2O2 under alkaline condition (pH 11.5), enabling the disruption of complex matrix in lignocellulosic biomass, thereby exposed cellulose and enhanced its dissolution capability. According to da Costa Correia et al. [7], AHP (4.3 vol% H2O2) caused lignin solubilization up to 92.44% when it was used to pretreat cashew apple bagasse for 6 h at 35 °C. When the concentration of H2O2 was increased from 0.645 to 4.3 vol% under similar solid loadings (10%) and conditions (35 °C, 24 h, pH 11.5), the degree of delignification drastically increased from 16.5 to 80.2% [7]. On top of that, da Costa Correia et al. [7] also revealed that when a lower solid loading was employed (5%), the maximum delignification was substantially increased to 96.7% over a duration of 24 h. The delignification efficiency of AHP in the pretreatment of hardwood based biomass is often lower than in softwood pretreatment. Catalyst, which was employed in AHP seemed to play a vital role in hardwood pretreatment in order to achieve subsequent profitable yield. For example, Li et al. [8] reported that Cu(II)(bpy)-catalyzed AHP exhibited an improvement in lignin solubilization from 36.6 (uncatalyzed) to 50.2%, leading to a total material loss of 25.9% for Hybrid poplar pretreatment under similar conditions (48 h, ambient temperature, pH 11.5, 10 g H2O2/L). The highly ordered structure of the cell wall matrix could be limiting oxidative radicals and caused disproportionation reactions. However, the employment of small and diffusible homogenous catalyst such as Cu(II)(bpy) provided an alternative route to improve site-specific reactions with cell wall polymer, thus improving the lignin and xylan solubilization [8]. On top of that, Li et al. [21] explored the efficiency of ultrasonic (40 kHz, 500 W) assisted AHP in delignification of Jerusalem artichoke and was able to improve lignin removal from 37.5 (AHP only) to 40.3%. Despite a minor improvement of delignification via ultrasonication, degree of polymerization by amorphous substances (hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin) removal was significantly reduced, leading to crystallinity index (CrI) of Jerusalem artichoke increased from 45% to 62.5%. Thus, the biomass porosity and accessibility were greatly improved. Nonetheless, it is important to take note that the reaction conditions are dependent on the type of biomass. For example, the optimum conditions for corn stover in delignification were 3 h, 50 °C, and 250 mg H2O2/g dry biomass [42], whereas for Jerusalem artichoke were 2 h, 50 °C, and 5% H2O2 (w/v) [21]. On the contrary, Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang [22] used AHP to pretreat Douglas fir at relatively high temperature of 180 °C, which resulted in delignification of 22% and exceptionally high glucomannan removal (hemicellulose) of 78%, while causing little degradation on cellulose. According to Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang [22], reducing end groups on glucomannan could occur quickly at high temperature, which facilitated organic acids formation through endwise depolymerization, together with termination reactions (formation of non-reducing end groups). These series of reactions provided a potential route to convert hemicellulose to valuable organic acids such as lactic acid, glycodic acid, succinic acid and formic acid, while removing protective barrier from the biomass to enhance cellulosic biofuels or biochemical productions. On the other hand, Morone et al. [44] demonstrated the use of pressurized air (6 bar, 190 °C) oxidation, which was assisted by AHP for reducing the H2O2 dosage in the pretreatment. By employing wet air oxidation on AHP pre-soaked rice straw, the H2O2 concentration could be reduced until 0.5% (w/v) while achieved maximum lignin removal and cellulose recovery of 77.29% and 83.01%, respectively [44]. High temperature treatment could lead to higher cellulose enrichment in the biomass and better solubilization of hemicellulose and lignin. However, high temperature environment also promoted sugar degradation and formation of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid as a result of acetyl groups removal from the hemicellulose. The formation of such acids remarkably change the pH of the reaction content from pH 11.9 to pH 5.63 [44]. Mittal et al. [42] further revealed that the lignin extraction efficiency depended on the peroxide concentration, whereby under mild peroxide concentrations, only side chain structures of lignin were oxidized, while no significant changes on aromatic rings. At 250 mg H2O2/g dry biomass, both side chain structures and aryl-ether bonds were dissociated, suggesting the disruptions of lignin aromatic rings and β-O-4 units. Recent applications of AHP in biomass processing reported excellent delignification and high affinity with enzymatic hydrolysis. It was found that, the AHP pretreated corn stover was able to enhance saccharification to a maximum of 92.5% [47]. On top of that, the application of AHP under mild temperature (<100 °C) was able to achieve significant delignification and high glucan enrichment [48,49]. It is interesting to note that the AHP could be customized and adapted to fractionate different biomass by optimizing the operating conditions to suit different applications. Numerous studies also revealed that, AHP pretreatments were highly compatible with enzymatic hydrolysis to yield high amount of sugars. These unique features allow AHP to potentially become one of the promising pretreatment methods used in a biorefinery. 2.3.1 Morphological alteration High sugar recovery from the biomass was predominately affected by effective removals of lignin and hemicellulose, which ultimately altered the cellulose features. According to Li et al. [21], biomass after undergoing AHP pretreatment showed transparent in colour with a reduction in particle size. Surface morphology analysis displayed disordered fibrils and formation of tiny holes on the pretreated biomass, which was caused by the removal of non-cellulosic polymers. AHP process disrupted polymers matrix and resulted in a serious collapse of supramolecular structure, enabling easier accessibility of enzymes towards the biomass. Ordered and intact structures were observed in an untreated rice straw (Fig. 2 a). However, after undergoing both pressurized air and AHP pretreatments, the pretreated biomass became loosened with a formation of cracks and cavities (Fig. 2b arrows), along with some debris which could be originated from the fragmentation of hemicellulose and lignin [44]. A similar observations (Fig. 3 ) was obtained from the surface morphology analysis done by Mittal et al. [42], whereby the corn stover after undergoing AHP pretreatment resulted in finer particles (Fig. 3d arrow). Transmission electron micrographs of the pretreated corn stover revealed less densely stained (lignin loss) and multiple delaminations (Fig. 3f arrows), plus cell disjoining at the middle lamella with dimmer cell wall (Fig. 3e arrows). The collective structure alteration which was caused by the removals of hemicellulose and lignin subsequently increased the exposing area and accessibility of cellulose. The AHP displayed excellent performance in a pretreatment of corn stover, in which more than 80% delignification could be achieved after 3 h at 50 °C, while retaining more than 90% of carbohydrates initially available in the corn stover [42]. A maximum yield of glucose and xylose at 90% and 80%, respectively were attained when AHP (250 mg H2O2/g dry corn stover) and enzymatic hydrolysis were applied, in which the hydrolysate could be utilized for biofuel production at the later stage in a biorefinery [42]. Analogous observations were reported by Díaz et al. [5], whereby a maximum sugar yields of 98.5% and 81.6% were achieved after AHP-pretreated biomass underwent saccharification at 30 bar and atmospheric pressure, respectively. 2.3.2 Inhibitors AHP pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has been known to generate small amount of acetic acid as a result of hemicellulose acetyl group removal. Most of the lignocellulosic pretreatment methods tend to generate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and furfural as a result of sugar degradation to different extent. Interestingly, Li et al. [21] revealed that no formation of 5-HMF and furfural could be detected using any of the four alkali-based pretreatments, namely dilute sodium hydroxide, alkaline peroxide, ultrasonic assisted dilute sodium hydroxide, and ultrasonic assisted alkaline peroxide. Li et al. [21] found that the concentration of acetic acids was significantly reduced by 38.5% to 1.15 g/L when H2O2 was used in the pretreatment, contrary to the negative results from ultrasonic assisted pretreatment. This result suggested that H2O2 possessed strong hydrolysate detoxification effect. Also, Morone et al. [44] reported a maximum acetic acid concentration of 1.2 g/L with the absence of 5-HMF and furfural productions using pretreated rice straw via AHP. The absence of these inhibitors suggested that no (or very minimum) sugar degradation happened at an elevated temperature because the sugars were mainly preserved in an oligosaccharides form [44]. It is worth noting that, weak acids could reduce the intracellular pH which requires ATP to release protons out of the cell. This phenomena would dissipate the proton-motive force across membrane and enhance ethanol formation. However, high concentrations of acetic, formic, and levulinic acid exceeding 100 mmoL/L would result in depletion of cell energy reserves, acidification of cytoplasm and cell death during fermentation [50]. Furthermore, the total phenolic content produced from the pretreated biomass (using AHP and pressurized air pretreatments) was found to be in the range from 0.29 g/L to 0.36 g/L, which was lower than the inhibitory concentration of most microbes [44]. However, contradicting results were obtained by Banerjee et al. [51], whereby most studies on alkaline peroxide assisted wet air oxidation (APWAO) of different lignocellulosic biomass reported the presence of furfural and HMF, which are the most potent inhibitors for subsequent bioconversion process. According to Larsson et al. [50], furfural and HMF would be consumed by yeast cells to form undesired alcohols, creating a lag phase in ethanol formation. However, the yield of ethanol was not reduced in the presence these inhibitors. Therefore, additional hydrolysate detoxification may be omitted for AHP pretreatment technologies."
5,AHP pretreatment for subsequent biofuel production,"Countless research has been attempted to utilize pretreated lignocellulosic biomass to generate second generation of bioethanol and biogas. Among those proposed methods, AHP-pretreated biomass has gained traction within the scientific community in the production of biofuels (Table 3 ). The effectiveness of AHP process was its ability to remove substantial amount of lignin on the biomass, while retaining most of the polysaccharide in the solid biomass. This is because the presence of lignin in the biomass would prevent effective hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose due to the nonproductive binding of enzymes [52]. In a study conducted by Yuan et al. [60], it was found that the sugar yield from NaOH–AHP pretreated bamboo chips was 87% higher in comparison to raw bamboo chips, this factor enables AHP pretreated bamboo chip to be more readily converted to bioethanol. The use of AHP pretreatment lead to the removal of lignin and silica from the biomass, thus, increasing the accessibility of enzymes to substrates for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Furthermore, the higher ethanol yield could also be explained by the low production of inhibitory products such as furfural and 5-HMF after the AHP pretreatment. In a study conducted by de Fátima Rodrigues de Souza et al. [53], AHP-pretreated sugarcane bagasse was found to have mass loss of 20% and 44% for hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. This high selectivity for lignin increased cellulose content within the biomass by 43%, benefitting a high solid-liquid ratio loading for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to biofuels at the later stage [54]. In a separate study, AHP-pretreated corn stalk was able to produce 22% more biogas, while reducing biogas production by a third of the time required in comparison to untreated corn stalk [55]. However, it was worth noticing that both lignin solubilization and polysaccharide retention were not the only parameters affecting enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation efficiency. de Souza Filho et al. [56] noticed that AHP-pretreated cactus pear had greater water retention ability during enzymatic hydrolysis, which was the main reason of low cellulose conversion into glucose. The same result was also observed by Vu et al. [57], where AHP and alkaline only pretreatment on gooseweed did not show any significant sugar recovery. Therefore, AHP might not be a suitable pretreatment method for certain biomass such as cactus pear and gooseweed. Besides, more attention should be placed on ensuring that every parameter affecting nominal sugar hydrolysis and fermentation was investigated during the application of AHP pretreatment. In addition to the use of AHP in biofuel production, sequential AHP pretreatment was widely applied to various biomass as a novel approach to further improve fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis [58]. The use of sequential AHP pretreatment in combination with other pretreatment is shown in Table 3. Sequential pretreatments were employed to generate less inhibitory byproducts such as acetic acid, furfural and silica, to improve the digestibility of enzymes [59]. For example, alkaline pre-extraction followed by sequential AHP pretreatment showed the benefit of removing silica from the biomass because the residual silica could hinder hydrolysis of substrate as well as prevent an efficient lignin recovery [58]. A mild sodium hydroxide pre-extraction was found to be effective in converting insoluble silica particles into a soluble form, namely sodium silicates. This was demonstrated by Yuan et al. [60], where the complete conversion of glucose and about 95% conversion of xylose into ethanol was achieved in 96 h. Another example was a sequential acid pretreatment followed by AHP pretreatment to reduce the production of acetic acid, which was produced by deacetylation of hemicelluloses under harsh conditions [61]. This sequential method was crucial as AHP pretreatment was highly selective towards lignin, while retaining considerable concentration of hemicellulose within the biomass. Additionally, it was found that lignin could be effectively removed from the olive tree pruning biomass after undergoing both formic acid and AHP pretreatments. With enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, the delignified olive tree pruning biomass could be reused as a feedstock for the production of ethanol up to 46 g/L [62]. Sequential AHP pretreatment was also widely investigated due to the synergetic effects as compared to an individual pretreatment. For example, in a study done by Phan and Tan [63], super critical carbon dioxide pretreatment followed by AHP pretreatment resulted in an excellent glucose recovery up to 97.8%, in comparison to a single stage AHP pretreatment which resulted in recovery of 22.9%. The high fermentable sugar concentration is crucial for later stage ethanol production in a biorefinery [64]. The utilization of AHP for the production of second generation biofuel showed a promising route towards a larger scale commercial production. However, biofuel productions are often not economically feasible without government support in the form of subsidies [69]. Therefore, there is a need to fully exploit the usefulness of biomass to provide a more competitive market for spurring biorefinery sector. In a study done by Yuan et al. [60], the processed liquor obtained from the AHP-pretreated bamboo chips was further processed to recover high-valued silica products and lignin derivatives. The detailed experimental flow is shown in Fig. 4 . The dissolved silica and lignin were precipitated by carbon dioxide treatment and 72% H2SO4 acidification, respectively. In a separate study, wheat straw was pretreated with AHP prior to the production of bioethanol. An integrated biorefinery process to fractionate and fully utilize the biomass was demonstrated through the recovery of silica and lignin (Fig. 5 ). In this study, 10 g of wheat straw underwent alkaline pre-extraction (0.25 moL/L NaOH, 30 °C for 6 h), followed by sequential AHP pretreatment (40 mg H2O2/g biomass, 50 °C for 15 h), achieving a total ethanol production up to 31.1 g/L. Additionally, 0.47 g of silica and 1.04 g of lignin were successfully recovered [58]. This study demonstrated AHP ability in bioethanol production, in parallel to silica and lignin recovery. AHP was found to be suitable for the production of second generation biofuel due to its ability to selectively remove lignin, while enriching cellulose content. Furthermore, the utilization of sequential AHP pretreatment is a novel approach to compensate for an individual pretreatment limitation. This combination of pretreatment methods was also found to promote the extraction of various valuable byproducts, which was expected to improve the economic and cost competitiveness in the biorefinery using AHP as a pretreatment step."
6,Advantages and limitations of AHP,"The use of AHP for biomass pretreatment has its own set of advantages and limitations in comparison to other type of pretreatment methods. Some of the advantages of utilizing AHP pretreatment method include the ability to reduce and even prevent (in some cases) the formation of 5-HMF and furfural throughout the pretreatment process. Both inhibitors are known to be detrimental to the fermentation process in later stages of bioprocessing to produce biofuels. Furthermore, contrary to ultrasound pretreatment, AHP was able to reduce the generation of acetic acid, which showed a positive effect on hydrolysate detoxification [21]. Besides, it was reported that AHP pretreatment showed a low polysaccharide degradation in comparison to other pretreatment method. In two separate studies done by Michalsk and Ledakowicz [23] and da Costa Correia et al. [7], it was found that the cellulose and hemicellulose degradations of biomass were largely unaffected by AHP pretreatment for a range of AHP concentrations. This characteristic was useful in the later stages of bioprocessing where high polysaccharide concentration was crucial in effective fermentation. Utilizing AHP also displayed numerous advantages which would increase the feasibility of large scale production. Firstly, AHP was found to be effective in pretreating biomass even at milder operating condition. For example, Douglas-fir wood was successfully delignified with AHP at temperature of 20 °C [70]. Michalsk and Ledakowicz [23] further supported the finding when it was reported that the biogas production for Sida hermaphrodita was optimized at 25 °C. Besides a lower operating temperature, AHP pretreatment was successfully conducted at atmospheric pressure in an open vessel for the pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunch [71]. The mild pretreatment condition provided an economical advantage as less energy would be utilized during the pretreatment. The mild operating conditions would further reduce the capital cost, as the need of constructing vessels out of expensive and sturdy material was not compulsory [38]. Most conventional pretreatment method would require particle sizes to be screened prior to pretreatment because smaller size particles have larger surface area for efficient pretreatment. However, Rabelo et al. [72] reported that bagasse screening was not necessary for AHP pretreatment because no significant pretreatment advantages were found for both screened and un-screened bagasse. This finding was crucial in reducing operation cost considerably. On an industrial scale, higher solid loadings are desirable since they lead to lower costs with reactors and larger product recovery [73]. Some previous studies showed that the use of AHP led to satisfactory results in improving enzymatic digestibility at high solid loadings [73] but higher solid loadings could also present challenges during AHP pretreatment for effective mixing of H2O2 and base and for pH adjustment in a stirred tank reactor [38]. Although AHP allowed the pretreatment process to be operated at a milder temperature and pressure conditions, a high pH condition (11.5) was required to initiate an effective pretreatment. The high pH condition was needed to deprotonate the H2O2 effectively [74]. This will pose a safety risk to operator and potential environmental hazard in the event of improper handling. Besides, the corrosive nature of AHP pretreatment will impose the need to construct reaction vessel out of exotic material, thus, increasing capital cost. Neutralization should be carried out as a post pretreatment to ensure the biomass was suitable to be used for fermentation process. Consequently, the need for acid in neutralization will increase the chemical costs and safety risk for biorefineries. Moreover, the process of neutralization will generate high amount of salt between acid and AHP. It was found that salt such as NaCl could act as an inhibitor in the fermentation process by disrupting the osmotic pressure of cells and preventing a desired growth condition during the fermentation process. For example, the productions of acetone-butanol-ethanol from the alkaline peroxide wheat straw hydrolysate with and without the removal of salt were 22.17 g/L and less than 2.59 g/L, respectively [75]. In addition to the cost of chemical for neutralization and salt removal, the relatively higher cost of H2O2 posed an economic challenge for the industry. The chemical cost estimation for both alkaline peroxide and NaOH to process one metric ton of biomass was in the range of US$ 138 to 141 at a H2O2 loading of 0.125 g/g biomass [76]. Therefore, the utilization of AHP in an industrial scale would require an effective recycling process and significant yield of value-added products for achieving a feasible process [42]. Also, one drawback from utilizing an ambient operating condition for AHP could be the long residence time required for a successful pretreatment [24]. This could be resolved by implementing various strategies such as sequential or catalyzed pretreatment. AHP presents a unique pretreatment method which promotes polysaccharide yield and lower production of inhibitors. Furthermore, the mild conditions required promote an inherently safer and greener process design through implementation of low operating temperature and ambient pressure. However, the drawback from operating at such mild conditions is the long residence time required for an effective pretreatment. Besides, the high cost of chemical acts as a major obstacle in the economic competitiveness of AHP. Therefore, a comprehensive technoeconomic and cost benefit analysis will need to be conducted to ensure the feasibility of the process."
7,Techno-economic analysis of AHP,"A comprehensive techno–economic analysis (TEA) of AHP pretreatment is needed to provide a bigger picture on the feasibility of employing such technologies in a large scale production of biofuel. In the case study conducted by Stoklosa et al. [77], lignocellulosic biomass was first subjected to alkaline pre-extraction followed by AHP pretreatment. At the end of the pretreatment the biomass was filtered for further hydrolysis into bioethanol, while the liquid stream containing water, alkali and solubilized organic was separated for disposal. Through TEA, it was shown that the utilization of AHP pretreatment would require a high minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) of 2.73 US$/gal. The high MESP was mainly contributed by the large quantity of chemicals used during the pretreatment stages. Hence, justifying the need for an alkali recovery stream to reduce the operational cost for improving the economic viability of AHP pretreatment. In the same TEA, the recovery stream scenario was scrutinized as well. This was achieved through the installation of recovery boiler, re–causticization plant, and multi–effect evaporator. Through the recovery and re–causticizing of Na2CO3 to regenerate NaOH, the MESP was successfully lowered to 2.27 US$/gal. While the MESP obtained after implementing recovery stream to reduce chemical cost was still found to be higher than ammonia fiber explosion, $2.09/gal (Table 4 ). The obtained MESP was found to be comparable to the MESP targeted by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which was found to be at 2.15 US$/gal [78]. Furthermore, AHP pretreatment MESP and capital was among the lowest in comparison to most conventional pretreatment methods (Table 4). While the utilization of recovery stream was able to reduce MESP, this process had its drawbacks. During the causticization process, solubilized sugars would be sent to the boiler instead of being fermented. This would greatly impact bioethanol yield, as removal of the liquid stream resulted in a loss of 26.5% of xylan and 9% of glucan. Furthermore, this setup had a much higher capital cost, at 17.21 million US$, and higher thermal requirement to fully operate the entire system [77]. Therefore, AHP pretreatment has been shown to be both a technologically and economically feasible process. In the case study provided above, the high cost of chemicals could be overcome through implementation of recycle stream. However, the recycle process could be further improved through separation of sugar to increase bio–ethanol yield."
8,Practical implication of this study,"From various literature reviews, it is worth noting that, the application of AHP may not be suitable for all type of biomass. For instance, the effectiveness of AHP in enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis was stifled when cactus pear and gooseweed were pretreated with AHP pretreatment. A lot of past studies indicated that sequential AHP pretreatment had the capability to synergistically enhance both enzymatic hydrolysis as well as fermentation yield. The synergism between pretreatment strategies could potentially provide an opportunity to enhance further the production of biofuels at the later stage and effectively improve process-economic feasibility. In the technoeconomic analysis, it was found that the AHP pretreatment biorefineries would require a recycle stream to be economically sustainable. It is also highly recommended to invest and optimize technology that could separate sugar from the recycle stream for AHP pretreatment biorefineries to increase sugar yield. Therefore, future research on the applications of sequential pretreatment strategies, recyclability and process scale up using AHP are required to release its potential to the fullest as a cost effective pretreatment."
9,Conclusion,"This review highlights the various applications of AHP, particularly for the purpose of lignocellulosic biomass processing to produce biofuels. The advancement of biomass processing technologies is often limited by cost, environmental impact, and toxicity. AHP pretreatment has shown promising potentials in the biomass valorization due to its compatibility with subsequent bioconversion, relatively safe decomposition products, and flexibility in adjusting process conditions to suit different scope of biomass fractionation. Sequential AHP pretreatment is found to be capable of extracting various bio–products such as silica and lignin. The benefit of utilizing AHP pretreatment under a mild operating condition is an inherently safer process, but the drawback is that a longer residence time is required to achieve satisfactory delignification of biomass. Lastly, the installation of recycle stream to recover spent chemical is necessary to reduce the cost of production of bio-ethanol. Therefore, more in-depth studies on the feasibility of sequential pretreatment strategies, recyclability study and process scale up using AHP are required to contribute towards a new chapter in biorefinery using lignocellulosic biomass as a sustainable feedstock."
