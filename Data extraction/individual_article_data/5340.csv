0,Introduction,"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a photosynthetic pigment involved in the production of energy through photosynthesis (Bogorad, 1981). Chl-a discolors due to environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight (Barry, 2009; Hörtensteiner & Kräutler, 2011; Matile, Hörtensteiner, & Thomas, 1999). In particular, the discoloration of Chl-a by sunlight is a serious problem in the food industry. UV light represents about 6–7% of sunlight and causes food deterioration because its energy is considerably higher than that of visible light and infrared rays (Stanzl, 1995). And UV-A accounts for approximately 90% in all UV light included in the sunlight. When foods and drinks contained chlorophyll are stored in a colorless and clear container, the change in color by UV-A is a problem. This discoloration of Chl-a is due to the decomposition into small molecular compounds under the exposure to light (Llewellyn, Mantoura, & Brereton, 1990; Steet & Tong, 1996). In addition, singlet oxygen (1O2) is generated by photosensitive reactions when Chl-a is irradiated with light (Endo, Usuki, & Kaneda, 1984; Wang et al., 2011), and this also causes Chl-a discoloration. In several studies, attempts to prevent Chl-a discoloration by using cyclodextrin (Seto, Nakanishi, Saeki, & Kajita, 1990) or β-carotene (Chen & Huang, 1998) or by substituting Mg in Chl-a with other metal ions (Wang et al., 2011) have been carried out. We have previously reported that Chl-a discoloration was decreased by quenching 1O2 in the presence of catechins and α-tocopherol under light irradiation (Ozaki, Yasuda, Tsuru, & Ohta, 2006). However, the quenching method was not strong enough to suppress the discoloration completely. It is well known that Chl-a in the pigment exists in the form of the self-assembled aggregates (Dijkmans & Aghion, 1973). Aggregation of Chl-a has been reported in various solvents, such as water (Agostiano, Catucci, Cosma, & Fini, 2003), dimethyl sulfoxide (Uehara, Mimuro, & Tanaka, 1991), and tetrahydrofuran (Uehara, Hioki, & Mimuro, 1993), as well as in solvent mixtures, such as methanol-water (Dijkmans & Aghion, 1973), formamide-water (de Paula, Robblee, & Pasternack, 1995), and dioxane-water (Gurinovich, Zenkevich, Chirvony, Gadonas, & Pelakauskas, 1989), and in mixtures of water with other polar solvents (Vladkova, 2000). Therefore, we thought that the formation of the self-assembled aggregates could prevent the discoloration of Chl-a. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Chl-a aggregates formed in alcohol-water solution suppress discoloration by UV-A. Furthermore, we discuss a relationship between the physico-chemical properties of aggregates and discoloration of Chl-a in aqueous alcohol solutions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and sample preparation,"2.1 Chemicals and sample preparation Chl-a (purity > 90% as confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and solvents (methanol and ethanol, HPLC grade) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Chl-a (10−4 M) was dissolved in methanol or ethanol using an ultrasonic wave machine and filtered with a membrane filter (0.80 μm). First, 200 μL of chlorophyll solution was taken into a sample tube, a given amount of methanol or ethanol was added to it, and then water was added to a total volume of 2 mL. The solution was thoroughly shaken and filtered with a membrane filter (0.80 μm). The concentrations of methanol or ethanol in the mixed solvents were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% (v/v), (the unit v/v in volume percentage is omitted in the rest of the text for simplicity). The final concentration of Chl-a was 10−5 M."
3,Color change of Chl-a under UV irradiation,"2.2 Color change of Chl-a under UV irradiation Sample solutions of Chl-a were irradiated by a FUNA UV light (SL-800G, Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 366 nm (UV-A) with an intensity of 0.7–0.8 mW/cm2. The color of the samples after UV irradiation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h was measured by using a CM-5 spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The blank measurement was performed in the dark without UV irradiation. Furthermore, UV–Vis spectra of sample solutions were measured at 300–800 nm using a Ubest-V560 spectrophotometer (Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan)."
4,Chemical species and size of Chl-a aggregates in methanol-water or ethanol-water solutions,"2.3 Chemical species and size of Chl-a aggregates in methanol-water or ethanol-water solutions UV–Vis and fluorescence spectra of Chl-a were measured to determine Chl-a chemical species in methanol-water or ethanol-water solutions. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 300–800 nm under excitation at 430 nm at room temperature (25 °C) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Tokyo, Japan). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured between 600 and 800 nm at 25 °C using a J-820 circular dichroic spectrometer (Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan). Chl-a particle size was measured after filtration of sample solutions with a 0.80-μm filter at 25 °C using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) system (Zetasizer Nano S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). UV–Vis spectra of Chl-a were constant in aqueous alcohol solutions with very high or very low concentrations of alcohol, but the spectra of Chl-a in 70% methanol or 50% ethanol gradually changed with time after the preparation of the solutions and became constant after 2 h. Therefore, these Chl-a solutions were left for 2 h before UV light irradiation and measurement."
5,Measurement of singlet oxygen,"2.4 Measurement of singlet oxygen Singlet oxygen generated after irradiation with UV light was investigated by the fluorescent probe method using Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). SOSG is a detection reagent that is highly selective for singlet oxygen (Rota, Chignell, & Mason, 1999). SOSG was dissolved in methanol or ethanol to generate a 500 μM stock solution. This stock solution was further diluted with methanol or ethanol to generate a 20 μM SOSG solution. Ten μL of the SOSG solution was added to 90 μL of Chl-a solution irradiated with UV light for a given time, and the mixture was placed in a fluorescence microplate. The fluorescence intensity was measured at Ex/Em = 485/525 nm by a microplate reader (Infinite M200 PRO, Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland)."
6,Results,
7,Discoloration of Chl-a under UV light,"3.1 Discoloration of Chl-a under UV light Photos of Chl-a solutions were taken before and after UV light irradiation for 1–6 h (Fig. 1 ). The columns and the rows of the photos indicate the change of Chl-a color in aqueous solutions containing different concentrations of methanol (Fig. 1A) or ethanol (Fig. 1B), which were exposed to different periods of UV irradiation, respectively. Before UV irradiation, the color of Chl-a was green at high alcohol concentrations (≥80% for methanol; ≥60% for ethanol) and at low alcohol concentrations (10% for methanol; ≤30% for ethanol). However, the color disappeared in solutions containing 20–70% methanol or 40–50% ethanol. This phenomenon occurred due to the formation of Chl-a aggregates as will be discussed in detail later. Following UV irradiation, the green color of Chl-a rapidly changed to thin brown at high concentrations of methanol (≥80%) or ethanol (≥60%). However, in the solutions of 10% methanol and 10–30% ethanol, the green color was retained even after 6 h of UV irradiation. The change in Chl-a color after UV irradiation was also measured by a spectrophotometer, and greenness value (–a*) is plotted in Fig. 2 . Before UV irradiation, Chl-a had a high greenness value in 80–100% methanol, but it rapidly discolored after 6 h of UV irradiation (Fig. 2A). The discoloration rate was inversely proportional to the concentration of methanol. Chl-a became colorless in 20–70% methanol, but a weak green color in 10% methanol was gradually discolored by UV irradiation. The –a* value in 10% methanol was the same as that in 80% methanol after 6 h of UV irradiation. Similar results were obtained in ethanol solutions (Fig. 2B). The green color of Chl-a in 60–100% ethanol was rapidly discolored by UV irradiation, and the rate of discoloration was also inversely proportional to ethanol concentration. However, the –a* value in 10% ethanol decreased gradually and was only slightly smaller than that in 100% ethanol and larger than that in 90% ethanol after 6 h of UV irradiation (Fig. 2B). As a result, the discoloration rate of Chl-a was found to be dependent on the solvent composition. Discoloration was minimal in 10% solutions of methanol and ethanol. On the other hand, aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol solutions showed almost no change in –a* values at any alcohol concentration in the dark for 0–6 h. The discoloration rate constants of Chl-a were determined using the green color loss parameter –a* given in Fig. 2 by the reported method (Steet & Tong, 1996). The rate constants for aqueous methanol and aqueous ethanol solutions are summarized in Table 1 . The rate constants for the solutions with a small change in –a* (“–” in Table 1) were not determined because of a large error in calculation due to the small change in color (see Fig. 2). Methanol or ethanol solutions of 10–30% resulted in a lower discoloration rate."
8,Chemical species of Chl-a in methanol-water or ethanol-water solutions,"3.2 Chemical species of Chl-a in methanol-water or ethanol-water solutions 3.2.1 UV–Vis spectra of Chl-a UV–Vis spectra of Chl-a in aqueous mixed solvents with ethanol are given in Fig. 3 A. The spectra changed with solvent composition. A sharp absorption peak at 666 nm indicates that Chl-a was predominantly in the monomeric form (Schmidt, Gottstein, Scheer, & Scherz, 1990) in 100% ethanol solutions, but the peak changed with the decrease in ethanol content. A large decrease in absorption at 666 nm and the appearance of the new peak at 760 nm occurred in 50% ethanol, and a decrease in absorbance at 672 nm occurred in 10–30% ethanol (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for methanol. For methanol solutions of Chl-a, the absorption intensity at 666 nm significantly decreased in 70% methanol, and a new broad peak at 760 nm was observed. The absorbance values decreased further in 30–60% methanol solutions and then increased again in 10 and 20% methanol solutions, revealing a new peak at 672 nm. The difference between the methanol and ethanol solutions was the concentration of alcohol at which the absorption began to decrease rapidly; UV spectra of Chl-a changed with alcohol concentration, suggesting the formation of at least three different species. The decrease in absorbance at 666 nm (Fig. 3A) is ascribed to the change from monomer to aggregates of Chl-a driven by π-π interaction (Iriyama & Yoshiura, 1977). The absorption peak at the longer wavelength of 760 nm indicated the formation of J-aggregates in 70% methanol and 40–50% ethanol (Vladkova, 2000). A new peak at 672 nm suggested the formation of other aggregates in 10% methanol and 10–30% ethanol. The plot of absorbance at 666 nm against the concentration of ethanol is given in the insert in Fig. 3A, and the figure clearly indicates the change of at least three chemical species with the concentration of ethanol. 3.2.2 Fluorescence and CD spectra of Chl-a The fluorescence spectra of Chl-a in various alcohol solutions are shown in Fig. 4 A and B. A large peak was observed at 681 and 673 nm in 80–100% methanol and in 60–100% ethanol. Chl-a fluorescence intensity significantly decreased in 70% methanol and in 50% ethanol. Moreover, no peak was observed in 10–50% methanol and in 10–40% ethanol. Because Chl-a monomer shows high fluorescence intensity, whereas its aggregates show low fluorescence intensity (Schmidt et al., 1990; Shi, Barber, & Zhao, 2013), Chl-a likely existed in the monomeric form in solutions with high alcohol concentrations (≥80% methanol; ≥60% ethanol) and in the aggregate form in solutions with low alcohol concentrations (≤70% methanol; ≤50% ethanol). The abrupt decrease of fluorescence intensity in solutions with low alcohol concentration indicated a large decrease in the amount of Chl-a in the monomeric form and the formation of aggregates. Therefore, the change in the fluorescence spectrum can reliably distinguish between the monomeric and aggregate forms but is not specific enough to distinguish between aggregate types, e.g., between self-assembled J-aggregates and other aggregates in solution. The difference in the aggregate composition was confirmed by CD spectra. Given that the Chl-a molecule has asymmetric carbons, we can observe perturbation of light absorption by Chl-a by using CD spectral measurements (Fig. 4C). CD intensities of Chl-a were very weak in solutions with a methanol concentration higher than 70%, in which Chl-a was predominantly in the monomeric form. However, Chl-a showed high CD intensity in 60–70% methanol with a trough at 708 nm and a peak at 687 nm. The strong CD intensities suggested the formation of J-type aggregates of Chl-a, which is a regularly orientated species with extensive delocalization of the electronic excitation and enhanced chirality (Engelmann et al., 2001; Keller & Bustamante, 1986; Kim, Ulibari, Keller, Maester, & Bustamante, 1986; Oba, Watanabe, Mimuro, Kobayashi, & Yoshida, 1996; Oba et al., 1997; Parkash et al., 1998). However, CD intensity was low in solutions with methanol concentrations below 60%. Therefore, the J-aggregates transformed into some other type of aggregate at those methanol concentrations. The aggregates did not show chirality and fluorescence but gave a new UV–Vis absorption peak at 672 nm. Therefore, that form of Chl-a was deemed to represent a random aggregate. In the case of ethanol, similar CD spectra were observed with a remarkable trough (757 nm) in 50% ethanol with a shoulder at 745 nm (Fig. 4D). The shoulder and the broadened spectra at a lower wavelength (714 nm) indicated a mixture of chiral aggregates. A weak CD spectrum was observed in 20% ethanol, but its origin is not clear at the present stage. This could be a small aggregate. 3.2.3 Size of Chl-a aggregates The measurements of the absorption, fluorescence, and CD spectra revealed that Chl-a formed aggregates in mixed aqueous solvents of methanol or ethanol. The particle size of aggregates was determined using DLS after filtration with an 800-nm filter. The Chl-a particle diameters at the maximum differential intensity are summarized in the Table 1. The size depended on the concentration of the alcohol. Smaller particles formed in solutions with lower alcohol concentrations. Furthermore, the aggregates in ethanol-water solutions were larger than those in methanol-water solutions at the same alcohol concentration. In methanol solutions, Chl-a formed almost identically sized particles in 40–60% methanol. The size, however, decreased significantly in solutions below 40% methanol. The particle size of Chl-a in 10 and 20% methanol was 51 and 85 nm, respectively. In the case of ethanol, the size of Chl-a particles was 2305 nm in 50% ethanol, i.e., larger than that observed in methanol. There were also small but broad peaks at 255 nm in 50% ethanol. The small particles may be the precursors of large J-aggregates. The particle size of Chl-a in 10 and 20% ethanol was 79 and 164 nm, respectively. One of the reasons for the larger aggregates in ethanol-water mixtures is the difference in Chl-a solubility in methanol and ethanol solutions. Although Chl-a is insoluble in water, it is soluble in both methanol and ethanol. However, Chl-a is much more soluble in ethanol because the dielectric constant (εr) of ethanol (24.3) is smaller than that of methanol (32.6). Chl-a solutions were prepared by the addition of a given amount of water to a Chl-a solution dissolved in alcohol. Therefore, methanol quickly caused the appearance of aggregates at lower methanol concentrations, leading to much smaller particles. In contrast, ethanol gradually formed J-aggregates and random aggregates at higher ethanol concentrations, and the size of aggregates was larger than that in methanol. The difference in solubility of Chl-a in alcohol determined the size of the aggregates formed in water-alcohol mixtures. 3.2.4 Change in UV spectra of Chl-a after UV light irradiation As we showed above, Chl-a exists mainly in three different forms in aqueous mixtures with methanol or ethanol: monomer, J-aggregates, and random aggregates. The predominant species depended on alcohol concentration. The discoloration rate of the three species was monitored by UV–Vis spectra after UV irradiation for a given time. The change in UV–Vis absorption spectra of the three species in ethanol is given in Fig. 3B–D. Absorption of Chl-a monomer (λmax, 666 nm) decreased rapidly and monotonously without an isosbestic point in 100% ethanol (Fig. 3B). Absorbance of J-aggregates (λmax, 760 nm) formed in 50% ethanol also decreased after UV irradiation (Fig. 3C), but the decrease in the absorption of Chl-a J-aggregates was different in methanol and ethanol. For Chl-a in methanol, both peaks at 666 nm and 760 nm were decreased monotonously by UV irradiation, but in ethanol, the decrease in absorbance at 760 nm was small, and large absorption remained even after 6 h of UV irradiation (Fig. 3C). The difference between methanol and ethanol was much clearer for Chl-a in 10% alcohol solutions, in which random aggregates were formed (Fig. 3D). Absorption of Chl-a in 10% methanol gradually decreased, but a different absorption spectrum was observed in 10% ethanol after UV light irradiation. The absorbance at 672 nm decreased gradually, but the absorbance at ca. 750 nm increased with UV irradiation time, with a new absorption peak at 745 nm, in 10% ethanol (Fig. 3D). The latter peak was not observed without UV irradiation. Thus, it was likely caused by the aggregates of compounds such as pheophytin, chlorophyllide, and pheophorbide produced by photodecomposition of Chl-a after UV irradiation (Ishitani & Kimura, 1977; Photosynthesis Dictionary, 2015). 3.2.5 Singlet oxygen formation Singlet oxygen in the samples was measured by the SOSG method after UV irradiation at each time point. The change in fluorescence intensities is plotted in Fig. 5 A (methanol) and 5B (ethanol) as the difference between the fluorescence intensity ([Fl]T) with UV irradiation at each time point and the fluorescence intensity before UV irradiation ([Fl]0). The fluorescence intensity ([Fl]T–[Fl]0) increased with UV irradiation time, suggesting an increase in singlet oxygen. A high concentration of alcohol resulted in a clear increase in the fluorescence intensity with UV irradiation time, and the fluorescence intensity was more sensitive to ethanol than methanol. One of the reasons why the fluorescence intensity of SOSG bound to oxygen (Rota et al., 1999) is more sensitive to ethanol is the lower polarity of ethanol (εr = 24.3) compared with that of methanol (εr = 32.6). Furthermore, 10–30% alcohol produced lower fluorescence intensities. There are two reasons for the low fluorescence intensity in 10–30% alcohol solutions. One is the quenching by water molecules, and the other is the lack of generation of 1O2 by random aggregates under UV light irradiation."
9,Discussion,"Exposure of chlorophyll-containing products to light discolors them. Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify the determinants of discoloration and ways to attenuate it. We found that different chemical species of Chl-a discolored at different rates. Moreover, the rate of discoloration depended on the size of Chl-a particles, which, in turn, was defined by the concentration of alcohol in aqueous solutions."
10,"Dependence of Chl-a discoloration under UV light on the molecular species, particle size, and alcohol concentration","4.1 Dependence of Chl-a discoloration under UV light on the molecular species, particle size, and alcohol concentration Chl-a exists in the monomeric form in solutions with high concentrations of alcohols and shows a strong green color (Fig. 1). The intensities in UV–Vis and fluorescence spectra changed slightly in 80–100% methanol and 60–100% ethanol (Fig. 3A; 4A, B). The small difference in these intensities implies that a small amount of aggregates was formed in those solutions. However, the calculated discoloration rate constants of the green color increased 2–4 times with the decrease in alcohol concentration. That finding suggested that Chl-a aggregates discolor more rapidly. Furthermore, the green color disappeared much faster in ethanol-containing than in methanol-containing solutions with low alcohol concentrations. As the alcohol concentrations were further reduced, the rate of discoloration of Chl-a decreased and became minimal in 10% methanol or ethanol, i.e., in the conditions when random Chl-a aggregates formed. The discoloration rate was fast for J-aggregates and slow for random aggregates formed in 10% methanol or 10% ethanol. The discoloration rate of Chl-a also depended on the aggregate size. Particularly, in the conditions when the discoloration constants were lowest (1.6, 1.7, and 1.8), the particle diameter became smaller than 100 nm in 10–20% methanol and 10% ethanol (Table 1). The size of the random aggregates formed in 10% methanol or ethanol was smaller than that of the J-aggregates, and the random aggregates gradually discolored but retained the green color even after 6 h of UV light irradiation (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, the Chl-a green color was maintained in a wider range of ethanol-containing solutions compared to the range of methanol-containing solutions. Ethanol solubilizes Chl-a better, so Chl-a formed aggregates in ethanol solutions below 50%, whereas Chl-a aggregates formed in methanol solutions below 70%."
11,Discoloration mechanism of Chl-a,"4.2 Discoloration mechanism of Chl-a Chl-a is a photosensitive compound and is easily activated to form chlorophyll radicals. The activated electron transfers to oxygen (3O2) dissolved in aqueous solution or to water molecules bound to Mg of Chl-a to form 1O2 or hydroxyl radical ( OH) after exposure to UV light. 1O2 and OH decompose Chl-a. (Endo, et al., 1984; Llewellyn, et al., 1990; Steet & Tong, 1996; Wang et al., 2011). The generation of 1O2 was confirmed by the increased fluorescence intensity of SOSG with time of irradiation with UV light. The photodecomposition depended on chemical species of Chl-a existing in solution. J-aggregates discolored rapidly under UV light (Table 1 and Fig. 1), but the smallest random aggregates were most resistant to UV light. Chl-a consists of a 20-π-chlorophyll moiety and a long alkyl chain of phytol, and the latter group is more hydrophobic (Humphrey, 1980). Therefore, the random aggregates likely formed a condensed micelle through a π-π interaction of Chl-a moieties and hydrophobic interaction of phytol alkyl chains in water. Given that random aggregates quickly form in the solutions with low alcohol concentrations (10% methanol or 10–30% ethanol), this process excludes water molecules from the condensed micelle and protects against UV light. On the contrary, J-aggregates formed gradually in solutions with high alcohol concentrations (70% methanol or 50% ethanol), and their size was large. Consequently, J-aggregates contain many water molecules that connect adjacent Chl-a molecules through hydrogen bonds (Mimuro, Kakitani, & Tamiaki, 2011). Therefore, J-aggregates can easily transfer the excited electron to water molecules, forming hydroxyl radials that quickly decompose Chl-a. Furthermore, ethanol solubilized Chl-a better because of the high affinity of ethanol to Chl-a. This is why large Chl-a J-aggregates formed in ethanol solutions became discolored more easily under UV light irradiation than those in methanol solutions, whereas small random aggregates discolored at comparably slow rates in 10% solutions of both methanol and ethanol."
12,Conclusions,"Chl-a discoloration is a serious problem for the food industry. We studied discoloration of Chl-a under UV light irradiation and determined the identity of chemical species of Chl-a and particle size of aggregates formed in aqueous solutions of methanol or ethanol by using changes in UV–Vis, fluorescence, and CD spectra as well as DLS measurements. The photodecomposition of Chl-a was caused by the generation of 1O2, which was detected by SOSG, and depended on chemical species of Chl-a. Chl-a exists in various forms in solutions: as monomer in 80–100% methanol and 60–100% ethanol, as J-aggregates in 60–70% methanol and 50% ethanol, and as random aggregates in 10–20% methanol and 10–30% ethanol. The size of the aggregates was directly proportional to relative methanol and ethanol concentrations: the lower the concentration of methanol or ethanol, the smaller the size of Chl-a particles. Although monomers and J-aggregates of Chl-a were easily susceptible to discoloration by UV light irradiation, the discoloration of Chl-a was significantly suppressed in 10% methanol or 10% ethanol. The particle sizes were 51 and 79 nm in diameter in 10% solutions of methanol and ethanol, respectively. The protective effect against UV light was likely due to the formation of small-size aggregates through strong π-π and hydrophobic interaction between Chl-a molecules that excluded water molecules. Our study shows, for the first time, that preparations containing small-size random aggregates of Chl-a maximally resist Chl-a discoloration caused by UV light. This result can be applied to Chl-a-containing alcohol solutions, e.g., liqueur of green tea, to prevent photodecomposition. Based on the present study, a promising method of controlling the size of aggregates in water is the use of emulsifier without alcohol."
