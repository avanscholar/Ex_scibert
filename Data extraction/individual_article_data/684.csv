0,Introduction,"Hydrogen can be an alternative renewable energy source to address such global energy and environmental issues owing to the features of zero greenhouse gas emission and high energy density when using as the energy carrier. Among various approaches for hydrogen production, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is a promising process that directly splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable solar energy (Gratzel, 2001; Osterloh, 2007; Abe, 2010; Choudhary et al., 2012; Chiu et al., 2019; Zhang and Sun, 2019; Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2016a; Tang et al., 2015). In the meantime, the strong electrochemical oxidation reaction, induced from the PEC system, can also play a role in degrading organic substances in the electrolyte, indicating a bifunctionality of PEC system enabling electrochemical wastewater treatment as the advanced oxidation process (AOP) as well as hydrogen production (Wang et al., 2017; Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2016b). Therefore, PEC system may hold a role of addressing both renewable energy and environmental issues under the single unit system. Nevertheless, limited studies have reported the bifunctional PEC concept, driven by simultaneously processing hydrogen production and organic pollutant degradation in wastewater. Most of reports have revealed the application of bifunctional PEC system in a presence of hole scavengers such as alcohols and organic substances (Antoniadou et al., 2008; Das et al., 2011; Alenzi et al., 2010; Dotan et al., 2011; Rengaraj and Li, 2007; Ng et al., 2018). Among the great concern on organic substances as the pollutant in wastewater, humic acid is one of significant natural organic matters (NOM) in ground and surface water. Potentially, NOM can be transformed into new compounds by combining with free chlorines (Cl2, HOCl, and ClO−) provided from drinking water treatment process. The possible candidates of the transformed complex will be disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as dihaloacetonitriles, haloacetic acids, and trihalomethanes, which are carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans (Oliver, 1983; Peters et al., 1990). Due to the expected safety and health risk of NOM, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promoted the regulation to reduce aqueous NOM, causing the formation of DBPs during chlorine disinfection of drinking water. Moreover, humic acid is composed of complex functional groups such as carboxylic and phenolic substituents, inducing a bonding with pesticide and heavy metals to form aqueous toxic substances (National Cancer Institute, 1978). In fact, NOM is difficult to be controlled by biodegradation or conventional water treatment methods, thereby becoming one of the challenging issues raised from the current water industry (Singer, 1999). Therefore, it is significantly important to establish suitable and effective degradation techniques for humic acid, the representative NOM, in raw water. Usually, the removal of humic acid in wastewater is processed by physical separation such as precipitation (Bourbonniere and van Halderen, 1989) and coagulation-flocculation (Greenland, 1971; Matilainen et al., 2010), ion exchange (Brattebø et al., 1987; Nie et al., 2010) and adsorption using activated carbon (Aeschbacher et al., 2012; Maghsoodloo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013). However, these techniques still have some disadvantages such as a large amount of sludge production, high energy consumption, various problems associated with fouling, and hazardous by-product formation. On the other hand, photocatalytic (Kim et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2013; Uyguner and Bekbolet, 2005) and photoelectrocatalytic processes (Zhou et al., 2014; Li et al., 2002; Koo et al., 2017) have attracted a great attention on degradation of humic acid-contained pollutants due to its complete mineralization mechanism despite a simple and cost-effective process. In addition, such photocatalytic/photoelectrocatalytic processes and electrochemical system enable hydrogen production by a counterpart-reaction (Uyguner and Bekbolet, 2005; Zhou et al., 2014; Li et al., 2002; Bekbolet et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2017). In this work, we demonstrate a new bifunctional PEC system which can successfully degrade aqueous humic acid as the target organic waste, and simultaneously generate hydrogen even under the self-bias condition. The device performance of the bifunctional PEC system was evaluated by comprehensive photo-induced electrochemical characterisations. The excellent performance of bifunctional PEC system was discovered to be mainly associated with efficient light-harvesting and charge transporting features of the plasmonic Au@TiO2 and p-type Cu2O incorporated multi-layered photocathodes."

2,Preparation of TiO2-1wt%Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes,"2.1 Preparation of TiO2-1wt%Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes As previous report (Personick et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014), Au nanoparticles were prepared by controlling amount of HAuCl4, AgNO3, HCl, ascorbic acid and NaBH4 in cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) solution. Then, Au aqueous solution containing 120 nm size Au nanoparticles was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min and redispersion in 50 mL of Milli-Q water. Afterward, TiO2 shell layer was formed onto the Au nanoparticles by adjusting pH of a mixture of the Au solution and 0.5 M TiCl3. The prepared Au@TiO2 core-shell nanoparticles were re-dispersed in Milli-Q water using a centrifuge before drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Afterward, the preparation of TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2 paste, 10 mg of Au@TiO2 nanoparticles was mixed with 1 g of TiO2-P25 Degussa powder, ethanol, acetic acid, and Milli-Q water. Then, Terpineol and 10 wt % ethyl-cellulose (pre-dissolved in ethanol) were mixed and evaporated under rotary-evaporator. TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes were prepared according to previous study (Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2015). A bottom layer of TiO2-1 wt%Au@TiO2 was prepared on the FTO glass by a doctor-blade method and calcined at 450 °C for 15 min in air atmosphere. Al2O3 ultra-thin layer was attached using spin-coating technique and dried at 110 °C for 10 min. The solution for Al2O3 layer was consisted of 0.1 M C9H21O3Al in isopropanol and 2 mL of nitric acid. The electrolyte solution for Cu2O layer deposition was mixed using 0.4 M cupric sulfate and 3 M lactic acid (LA) as described the previous report (Jiang et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2011). Finally, the as-prepared electrodes were electrodeposited Cu2O thin films with an applied potential of -0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl at 50 °C of electrolyte bath temperature for 15 min and calcined 500 °C for 30 min under nitrogen gas atmosphere."
3,Materials characterizations and PEC measurement procedure,"2.2 Materials characterizations and PEC measurement procedure The physical and chemical properties of the samples with variety of advanced characterization techniques have been investigated. The cross-section of the multi-layered thin films was studied by taking Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL 7100). The structure of Au@TiO2 nanoparticles was characterized using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM, JEOL 1010). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were measured by a Kratos Axis ULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The bifunctional PEC measurements were carried in a H-cell type reactor on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments). The prepared TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes, Pt plate, and Ag/AgCl were served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The illumination area was set by an aperture to 0.785 cm2. The PEC behaviour of the electrodes was characterised with degradation of 100 mL of 30 mg/L of humic acid with contained 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. All solutions were prepared from Milli-Q water and performed at room temperature and purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. A 150 W Xe lamp light source with an AM 1.5 filter was used, and the intensity of the illumination at the sample position was determined to be the simulated 1-Sun solar illumination condition (100 mW cm−2). To evaluate the degradation of humic acid, 5 mL of the treated solution was sampled every 60 min and analysed by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450). After that, the analysed sample was taken back into the PEC reactor. The concentration of the degraded humic acid was measured by observing the peak UV–vis absorption intensity at 296 nm wavelength. Total organic carbon (TOC) also was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-V CPN Total Organic Carbon Analyser. The photocatalytic degradation rate was examined from the relationship between ln(C0/C) and times, which is in accordance with first order reaction, as shown in Eq. (1) below, (1) I n C 0 C t = k t where C0 and Ct are the initial concentration and the concentration at time (t), respectively, t is an irradiation time and k is the first-order rate constant. Moreover, the observation of the stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution was investigated to confirm the react catalytic reaction. The concentration can be determined with the Faraday’s law by measuring the charge (Q) generated, assuming the organics are completely oxidized as shown in the following Eq. (2) (Zhao et al., 2004), (2) Q = ∫ I n e t d t = n F V C where Q is the direct measure of net charge of the organics, Inet the net photocurrent generated from the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organics, t the time elapsed upon illumination, N the number of transferred electrons that result from the complete degradation, F the Faraday constant (9.64853399 × 104 C mol−1), V the volume of solution, C the concentration of organics. According to the redox reaction of water splitting, one oxygen molecule is equivalent to 4 transferred electrons. We can calculate chemical oxygen demand (COD) by converting the measured Qnet value as presented in the following Eq. (3) (Zhao et al., 2004), (3) C O D = n C 4 × 32,000 = Q 4 F V × 32,000"
4,Results and discussion,"Previously, we successfully demonstrated water splitting performance of the hybrid photoelectrodes with size-controllable plasmonic Au@TiO2 nanoparticles (Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2015). The hybrid photoelectrodes are used for the main compartment cell of the bifunctional PEC system that is composed of two separated compartment cells via nafion membrane in a H-cell type reactor as seen in Fig. 1 . Then, two separated compartment cells are filled with different electrolytes. In Fig. 1, H2 is produced through reduction reaction by electrons generated from TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O hybrid photoelectrodes in Na2SO4 electrolyte, while humic acid is degraded through oxidation reaction by holes generated from a Pt electrode in humic acid electrolyte. The cross-sectional SEM image and the inset photo image of the fabricated TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O hybrid photoelectrodes were presented in Fig. S1a (see Supporting Information). It is apparent that the hybrid photoelectrodes were divided into three-layered structure with individual nanoparticulate thin films. In addition, TEM image in Fig. S1b shows the as-synthesized concave Au@TiO2 with Au metal core nanoparticles with size of 120 nm, which was selected to investigate the plasmonic effect in this study. Fig. S1c shows that UV–vis absorbance spectra of Cu2O film, TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2 film, and TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O multi-layered film. TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2 film reveals the absorption edge of typical P25 TiO2 at around 380 nm and the broad absorption band at the range of 500−700 nm with a characteristic absorbance signal at 530 nm, indicating the presence of Au metal phase embedded in the TiO2 shells (Wang et al., 2014; Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2012; Du et al., 2019). Meanwhile, the multi-layered TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes exhibit a significant increase in the visible light region at wavelengths longer than 400 nm, which could be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance absorbance of the Au metal core and absorption band edge of Cu2O at 620 nm (Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2015; Du et al., 2019; Pougin et al., 2018). The enhanced light absorption in the visible light region should be beneficial for interfacial charge transfer process and increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes that participate in photoelectrochemical reactions. The surface element composition and chemical state of a TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrode were confirmed by high-resolution XPS spectra as shown in Fig. 2 . Cu 2p3/2 peaks with a binding energy of 932.6 eV indicate Cu+ in Cu2O. In addition, the deconvoluted fitting of O1 s peaks at 530.4 eV is consistent with oxygen-state in Cu2O. The characteristic of the TiO2 phase was confirmed by two major peaks with binding energies at 464.9 eV and 459.1 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. The Al 2p peak is assigned to pure Al2O3 with the binding energy of 73 eV. Meanwhile, XPS spectrum of Au@TiO2 does not show clearly Au 4f core region at 84.01, which is assigned to Au°, due to the complete coverage of TiO2 shell structure onto the whole surfaces of Au metal cores, as seen in TEM image of Au@TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S1b). However, the plasmonic effect of Au metal core, surrounded by higher dielectric TiO2 shell, was obviously demonstrated through the significant light absorption enhancement in visible light region (Fig. S1c) and PEC performance (Fig. 3 ). In order to investigate humic acid degradation performance of the TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O in the bifunctional PEC system, UV–vis absorbance of humic acid electrolyte was monitored every 30 min at 0 VRHE in a three-electrode system. As seen in Fig. 3a, the main peaks were observed at 296 nm wavelength, which were gradually decreased with an increase in PEC reaction time. As the magnitude of the 296 nm band is associated with the electronic transition of carboxylic groups, the decrease in UV–vis absorbance at 296 nm indicates the humic acid degradation efficiency of the photoelectrode through decomposition of the carboxylic species (Kim et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014). The inset Fig. 3a illustrates the colour of the humic acid solution changes from brown to colourless in 120 min, which indicates degradation of humic acid in the presence of TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes. The PEC degradation of humic acid and its first order reaction rates of TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes were calculated as shown in Fig. 3 b and c, respectively. Humic acid concentration was decreased as a function of irradiation time. The rates of photocatalytic degradation became constant within 2 h. TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrode with the 120 nm Au metal core enhanced the degradation efficiency up to 87 %, whereas the humic acid degradation efficiency of TiO2-P25/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrode was only 20 %. The calculated kinetic constants of TiO2-P25/Al2O3/Cu2O and TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes exhibited 0.0015 and 0.0250 min−1, respectively. In Fig. 3d, the removal efficiencies of TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes were investigated with respect to COD and TOC. The Itotal was generated from the oxidation of water and humic organic compounds, while Iblank was resulted from the oxidation of water only. Typically, the total amount of transferred electrons from the complete decomposition of organic compounds can be determined by a net photocurrent (Inet) value, and then Inet can be obtained by subtracting Iblank from Itotal, indicating the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of humic organic compounds. The calculated COD values were 48.5 mg O2·L−1 in the linear range with COD removal of 89 % at 120 min. Meanwhile, TOC was used to examine oxidation-reduction reactions or mineralization of humic acid by calculating the amount of carbon in an organic compound. The TOC removal efficiency of humic acid over TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes increased with the increase in irradiation time, and reached about 85 % at 120 min, indicating the applied photoelectrodes were well-fitted to the mineralization of humic acid. For H2 production performance with humic acid electrolyte in the bifunctional PEC system, the photocurrent responses of TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes were investigated in the presence (Itotal) and absence of 30 mg L−1 humic acid (Iblank) in electrolyte. When the solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as a background electrolyte. Fig. 4 a shows I-t curves measured in a three-electrode system at 0 VRHE under AM 1.5 illumination. Under three-electrode system, the performance of photoelectrodes is only measured with respect to a reference electrode in order to maintain the potential of the photoelectrode at a well-defined value, regardless of any polarization effect at a counter electrode (Esposito et al. (2009)). The Itotal increased up to -6.32 mA cm-2, which was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of Iblank. As considering the standard evaluation of PEC devices for bias-free artificial photosynthesis system, the PEC performance should be characterized under two-electrode system to avoid an internal bias effect by a reference electrode. In Fig. 4b, Itotal was -0.45 mA cm-2 that was around 4 times higher than Iblank. The STH efficiency was calculated to be 0.5 %, which is comparable to other studies (Coridan et al., 2013; Siripala et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2012; Mor et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2015). For instance, Gopal et al. presented a self-biased p-n junction tandem PEC system using p-type Cu-Ti-O nanotube array films in combination with n-type TiO2 nanotube. This tandem cell configuration reveals a photocurrent density of approximately 0.25 mAcm-2 and STH efficiency of 0.3 % (Mor et al., 2008). Meanwhile, Lin et al. have showed a photocurrent density of -33 μAcm-2 and STH value of 0.11 % in the absence of an external bias potential using a Cu|Cu2O|NiOx photocathode in combination with WO3 photoanode (Lin et al., 2012). Moreover, Lai et al. have demonstrated an unbiased photocurrent of 45 μA cm−2 corresponding to a STH of 0.05 % using p‐Si|TiNi–nanoBiVO4|TiCo photoelectrode (Lai et al., 2015). Despite their small photocurrent densities and STH efficiencies, tandem systems composed of Cu2O based photocathode have the potential to drive unassisted PEC water-splitting system. The evolved gases from this multi-layered photoelectrodes were collected every 30 min in three electrode system at 0 V RHE and in a two-electrode system without an external bias as presented in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. H2 and O2 gases evolved from both three-electrode and two electrode systems had a good agreement in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. The direct H2 and O2 evolutions as a function of the irradiation time were 294 and 145 μmol cm−2 at 120 min, respectively in three electrode system, while two electrode system under bias-free condition exhibited H2 and O2 evolutions of 36 and 17 μmol cm−2 at 120 min, respectively, indicating 8 times lower than those of three electrode system. As discussed above, TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes revealed not only enhanced photocurrent density but also high mineralization performance of humic acid substance. Therefore, it is important to further understand working mechanism under bifunctional PEC system as seen in Fig. 5 . In the absence of humic acid, TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes improved the PEC process through the following strategies: 1) Wide-range photon absorption can be achieved in this multi-layered photoelectrodes; ultraviolet and visible photons in the solar spectrum can be effectively absorbed by TiO2 and Cu2O due to the appropriate bandgap energies of these two metal oxide semiconductors. 2) Strong inherent electric fields at the interfaces by introducing of extremely thin Al2O3 film suppress recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The absorption of incident photons by Au@TiO2 plasmonic nanoparticles and Cu2O films accelerates photogenerated electron −hole pairs. 3) Holes at the valence band are accumulated to oxidize water at the Cu2O for oxygen evolution, and the electrons migrate to the counter electrode to reduce water, thereby forming hydrogen. Additionally, by 1 wt% Au@TiO2 nanoparticles embedded into TiO2 films, incident light absorption and charge separation rate can be further improved due to near-field effect and light scattering induced by the plasmonic effect of Au core metals (Peerakiatkhajohn et al., 2015; Giri et al., 2011; Chen and Wang, 2014; Tahir et al., 2015). In the presence of humic acid, more importantly, photocurrent density of bifunctional PEC system can further be improved. Then, humic acid serves as an electron donor to scavenge holes with functional groups containing carboxyl radical (COOH ) and hydroxyl radical (OH ), suppressing charge recombination by trapping remaining holes. Subsequently, such charge transport property is responsible for degrading humic acid in PEC system. This enhanced PEC performance behaviour is corresponding to previous works, addressing the suppression of charge recombination by hole-scavenging effect (Alenzi et al., 2010; Rengaraj and Li, 2007; Zhou et al., 2014; Li et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010). As organic substances as an electron donor in PEC system are consumed to facilitate charge separation, they are oxidised by itself as a counterpart reaction, indicating direct photoelectrocatalytic degradation. In this regard, PEC system in the presence of humic acid promotes hydrogen production, simultaneously enabling the breakdown of humic organic compounds."
5,Conclusions,"A bifunctional PEC system with the function of simultaneous hydrogen production and humic degradation was demonstrated through a cost-efficient single unit system using multi-layered TiO2-1 wt% Au@TiO2/Al2O3/Cu2O photoelectrodes. The PEC system demonstrated high degradation efficiency of 87 % on humic acid during 2 h reaction time. Simultaneously, humic acid acted as a hole scavenger role so that photocurrent density increased up to -6.32 mA cm−2, which was 1.5 times higher than that of the reference condition without humic acid. Under the bias-free condition of two-electrode system, furthermore, the proposed PEC system demonstrated a short circuit photocurrent density of -0.45 mA cm−2 and solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) of 0.5 % in the presence of humic acid. The bias-free condition in this bifunctional PEC system may pave a promising way towards artificial photosynthesis system."
