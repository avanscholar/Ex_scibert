0,Introduction,"Global warming and global energy problems caused by greenhouse gas emission and shortage of fossil fuels are worldwide focused by many researchers as these carbon-based greenhouse gases, especially CO2, can be potentially converted to value-added chemicals and alternative energy sources. Accordingly, CO2 hydrogenation has received much interest as a promising alternative technology for the future energy [1–5]. Previous research works in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation were mainly focused on effects of catalysts and supports [6–9], promoters [10–12], and operating conditions [13–15] on the catalytic activity and desired product selectivity. By means of green and sustainable production concepts [16–18], catalytic processes with higher reactant conversions to desired products using a lesser amount of energy consumption is of great interest both economically and ecologically. Therefore, in this work the magnetic field-assisted packed-bed reactor has been employed to promote the catalytic CO2 conversion and enhance alcohol product selectivity as well. The external magnetic field was applied mainly in fluidized-bed reactors with the purpose of promoting the movement of magnetic particles, avoiding and eliminating particles aggregation, slugging and channeling [19,20]. However, less available information on magnetic field-assisted catalytic reactions in a fixed bed reactor has been reported. Up to the present, magnetic field has been used in CO oxidation [21], photocatalytic reaction [22], hydrogen production [23], and self-assembled magnetic materials preparation [24]. Recently, our research group has reported the utilization of a magnetic field-assisted reactor system in CO2 hydrogenation over the catalysts with hierarchical mesoporous structures [25,26], the outstanding selectivities to alcohols and C2+ hydrocarbons were observed. As the Cu and Fe loaded on ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited significant hydrogenation activity [27,28] and selectively promoted the formation of alcohols and C2+ hydrocarbons [29–31], we therefore focused in CO2 hydrogenation over Cu and Fe loaded on ZSM-5 zeolite with microporous aluminosilicate structure, and explored factors affecting the selective methanol syntheses. In this work, an external magnetic field has been combined to a conventional packed bed reactor to promote CO2 hydrogenation reaction over a magnetized 10 wt.% Cu and 10 wt.% Fe catalysts loaded on microporous ZSM-5 zeolite support (10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst). The effects of reaction temperatures (180–260 °C) and molar ratio of CO2/H2 (1:1–1:4) on catalytic CO2 conversion and methanol production were examined at a magnetic flux intensity of 27.7 mT in the orientation of north-to-south (N–S) direction and compared to those obtained without the use of a magnetic field. It was found that a magnetic field could not only significantly enhance the activity of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst with intrinsic magnetic properties, but also promote the energy saving by means of lowering the operating temperature during the reaction—generate less environmental impact than the conventional reactor by means of CO2 emissions, facilitating development of a carbon-neutral CO2 conversion process."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The ZSM-5 zeolite synthesis procedure was modified from the synthesis process reported by Chareonpanich et al. [32] using sodium silicate solution (Na2Si3O7: 4 wt.% NaOH; 27 wt.% SiO2) as a silica source, aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O: 98% purity, UNILAB) as an alumina source and tetrapropyl ammonium bromide (C12H28NBr or TPABr: 98% purity, Fluka Chemicals) as a structure-directing agent. Regarding the synthesis process, sodium silicate solution was primarily added into the mixture of TPABr and aluminium nitrate solution, while pH of the mixture was maintained at 10.5 throughout the mixing process. The mixture was kept stirring for 3 h and the obtained gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and hydrothermally heated at 240 °C for 24 h. The solid product was filtered and washed with deionized water, dried at 120 °C for 24 h, and calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h using a heating rate of 2 °C/min to remove TPABr and other volatile contaminants. In this study, 10 wt.% copper (Cu) and 10 wt.% iron (Fe) were loaded onto ZSM-5 zeolite support using copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O: 99.95%, Univar) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·6H2O: 98%, Univar) as metal precursors via incipient wetness impregnation method. The obtained mixture was dried using microwave irradiation at 800 W for 3 min, and consecutively calcined in air at 500 °C for 5 h."
3,"Characterization of textural, chemical, and magnetic properties of catalysts","2.2 Characterization of textural, chemical, and magnetic properties of catalysts The textural properties of ZSM-5 zeolite support and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were examined by using N2 physisorption technique with a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument at −196 °C. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were obtained by using Brunauer–Emmert–Teller (BET) analysis and t-plot method, and the pore volume was measured at a relative pressure of 0.995. The crystallographic structures of xCu–yFe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD: Philips X-Pert) operated with monochromated Cu Kα radiation at high angle in the 2θ range of 5–60°. The morphology and structure of ZSM-5 zeolite support and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were analyzed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM: JEOL, JSM-7600F) operated at 15 keV with Pt-coated on the samples and transmission electron microscopy (TEM: JEOL JEM-2010) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Cu and Fe elements on the catalyst surface were mapped by using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS: OXFORD, X-MaxN). The reducing temperatures of Cu and Fe catalysts and their interaction on the ZSM-5 zeolite support were examined by using H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). This measurement was carried out in a continuous-flow Inconel tube reactor. During the analysis process, H2/Ar mixture gas (10% H2) was introduced into the catalyst bed using a total flow rate of 30 ml/min at room temperature; then the temperature was increased to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The H2 consumption was continuously monitored by using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In order to examine Cu and Fe species, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed using Time resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) at Beamline 2.2 of the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand. The beamline employs an energy-dispersive monochromator equipped with a Si (111) single crystal. Magnetic properties of unreduced and reduced catalysts were analyzed by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM: Lakeshore model 7404) under applied magnetic field of 10 kOe at room temperature. The desorption behavior of CO2 gas over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was examined under magnetic field using CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) technique. The measurement was carried out in a continuous-flow tube reactor. Prior to the measurement, the 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was reduced at 480 °C for 3 h in H2 gas and followed by flushing with argon gas for 1 h, after that the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. The CO2/Ar gas mixture was introduced into the catalyst bed at 50 °C for 1 h, and followed by flushed the catalyst with argon gas. In the CO2 desorption process, the 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was heated with a heating rate of 5 °C/min to 500 °C under argon flow, and the desorbed CO2 was monitored by using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The similar operating condition was also applied without an external magnetic field, except that the temperature in CO2 desorption process was increased up to 1000 °C."
4,CO2 hydrogenation over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in a magnetic field-assisted packed bed reactor,"2.3 CO2 hydrogenation over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in a magnetic field-assisted packed bed reactor The performances of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation in a magnetic field were examined using a packed-bed reactor (SUS-316, O.D. 3/8”) assembled with a magnet system (a ring cast Alnico permanent magnet: Bunting Magnetics Co., Ltd.; O.D., 1”; I.D., 0.75”; thickness, 0.5”; grade 5) with a curie temperature of 840 °C and a maximum operating temperature of 538 °C. Prior to each experiment, 1.0 g catalyst was packed in the reactor at a position centered between the magnet pairs and was reduced in situ at 480 °C for 3 h at atmospheric pressure and a H2 flow rate of 60 ml/min. Then reactant gases (CO2 and H2) were fed into the catalyst bed with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 12,000 ml h−1 g cat−1 at a total pressure of 10 bar. The effects of CO2/H2 molar ratios (1:1–1:4) and reaction temperatures (180–260 °C) on catalytic CO2 conversion and product selectivity were investigated under the magnetic field orientation of north-to-south (N–S) direction and flux intensity at the catalyst bed of 27.7 mT, following the optimum magnetic field condition to produce small alcohols as was reported by Kiatphuengporn et al. [25]. Effluent gases including H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 were analyzed by using Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Unibead-C packed column, while C1–C4 hydrocarbons were quantified by using Shimadzu GC-8A with flame ionization detector (FID) and a Porapak-Q packed column. For the latter, helium (99.995% purity) was used as a carrier gas while H2 and air were used as combustion gases. The performances of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst without an external magnetic field were also examined in comparison and the energy savings were calculated by means of lowering the reaction temperature at each reaction rate."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of ZSM-5 zeolite and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst,"3.1 Characteristics of ZSM-5 zeolite and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst 3.1.1 Textural and chemical characteristics of ZSM-5 and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst The adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of ZSM-5 zeolite and 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts used in this study are shown in Fig. 1 A and B, respectively. All catalysts and support show Type II isotherm, indicating the existence of micropore structure. As shown in Fig. 1B, ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a monomodal pore of approximately 0.24 nm, while a wider pore was observed with 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite (0.32 nm) (Table 1 ). It was found that after copper and iron loadings onto the support, the fraction of micropore volume of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 approximately reduced from 84% to 58%, compared to that of the ZSM-5 support due to the partial blockages of metal clusters. This also led to the lower specific surface area and larger mean pore size of the 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst. Consequently, the mean pore size of the Cu-Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst was relatively increased compared to that of ZSM-5 zeolite support due to the lesser number of micropores [33,34]. The crystalline sizes and distribution of CuO and Fe2O3 over ZSM-5 zeolite support are confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the crystallinity of ZSM-5 zeolite was 2.64 times decreased after metal loading. Similar to the N2 sorption result, metal nanoclusters could possibly penetrate in between ZSM-5 zeolite crystalline particles, leading to a formation of smaller zeolite crystals with CuO and Fe2O3 nanoclusters finely dispersed on the surface, and partially agglomerated and blocked pores of zeolite support, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. Moreover, the EDS result evidently confirmed a uniform distribution of CuO and Fe2O3 nanoclusters over the surface of ZSM-5 zeolite. Similar result was also observed from TEM photo (Fig. 3f), the cluster sizes of CuO and Fe2O3 are approximately 29.7 and 30.5 nm, respectively. 3.1.2 Reduction behavior of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst The reduction behavior and interaction between active metals and ZSM-5 zeolite support were examined by using TPR measurement, as shown in Fig. 4 . It was found that the oxides of copper and iron on ZSM-5 zeolite could be reduced by H2 gas at 3 reduction temperatures. The first peak temperature at 296 °C was attributed to the simultaneous reduction of CuO to Cu metal [35,36] and Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, while the reduction peaks at 515 and 593 °C confirmed the transformation of Fe3O4 to FeO, and FeO to Fe metal, respectively (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe) [26,37,38]. In addition, the distribution of copper oxide clusters on the surface of catalyst also influences the reduction phenomena of iron oxides. The existence of copper oxide helps promote H2 spillover mechanism over bimetallic catalyst system [39,40], and therefore lowering the reduction temperatures of iron oxides compared to that without CuO. The transformation of Cu and Fe oxide species in 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was confirmed by XANES technique. The catalyst was in-situ reduced in the temperature range of 50–480 °C with 180 min holding time. The obtained normalized Cu and Fe K-edge absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 5 . For comparison, the spectra of Cu and Fe oxides together with Cu and Fe foil standards are shown in the insets of this figure. The pure phase of Cu metal was observed in the temperature range of 150–200 °C (Fig. 5a), as was confirmed by the H2-TPR technique (Fig. 4). For iron oxides (Fig. 5b), Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases were detected in the reduction temperature range of 50–340 °C, while those of Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and FeO phases, and Fe and FeO phases, were detected throughout the reduction temperature range of 340–480 °C and at the final temperature of 480 °C. These results confirmed that the active forms of iron oxides on 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were mainly the mixed phases of Fe3O4 and FeO. 3.1.3 Magnetic properties of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst The magnetic properties of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were examined using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) before and after the reduction process. The magnetic hysteresis loops exhibited saturation magnetization (Ms), remanence magnetization (Mr), and coercivity field (Hc), as shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that the hysteresis loop was very close to the zero field for the catalyst before the reduction process (Fig. 6a), indicating that the unreduced catalysts were soft magnetic materials. After the reduction process (Fig. 6b), the saturation magnetization, remanence, and coercivity field evidently increased. These results showed that the magnetic properties of the reduced 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were significantly enhanced as the bimetallic Fe and Cu exhibit excellent magnetization with superparamagnetism [26,41]. 3.1.4 CO2 desorption characteristic of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst The adsorption capacities of CO2 gas on 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were examined in temperature ranges of 30–1000 °C under the condition without an external magnetic field, and 30–500 °C (due to a limit in the maximum operating temperature of Alnico magnet) with a magnetic field (Fig. 7 ). Within the temperature range of 30–500 °C, two CO2 desorption peaks were observed on both without and with the magnetic field conditions. It should be noted that the positions of these desorption peaks were not significantly different, indicating that there was no change in the property of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst. Moreover, it implied that the magnetic field did not affect the property of this catalyst. However, the amount of CO2 desorbed under the condition with a magnetic field was approximately 1.22 times lower than that without the use of a magnetic field (Fig. 7 (inset)). This result implied that the adsorption of CO2 on the magnetized 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst surface under the magnetic field was stronger than that without the magnetic field. This phenomenon could be explained that the active sites of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst with superparamagnetic property might act as stronger active sites for CO2 adsorption under the magnetic field condition, resulting in the lower amount of CO2 desorbed from this magnetized catalyst. Regarding the XANES result (Fig. 5), the active forms of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst prior to CO2 adsorption process were the mixed phases of metallic Cu, Fe3O4, and FeO. The d orbital of these transition metals could strongly interact with oxygen molecule existing in CO2 molecule. This interaction then has profound effect on the active surface of magnetized catalyst [42,43]. Accordingly, this result clearly confirmed that an external magnetic field could facilitate and promote the adsorption of CO2 molecules over the surface of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 magnetized catalyst, resulting in the significant increase in the catalyst performance during CO2 hydrogenation."
7,Effect of magnetic field on CO2 hydrogenation over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst,"3.2 Effect of magnetic field on CO2 hydrogenation over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst The performances of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation reaction were tested in magnetic field-assisted fixed bed reactor compared to the conventional fixed bed reactor. The reaction temperature and CO2/H2 molar ratio were varied in the ranges of 180–260 °C, and 1:1–1:4, respectively, at the total flow rate of 40 ml/min under a total pressure of 10 bar. The catalytic performances in terms of CO2 conversion as a function of reaction temperature for different CO2/H2 molar ratios are shown in Fig. 8 . It was found that CO2 conversions of all CO2/H2 molar ratios increased with increasing the reaction temperature, due to the endothermic nature of CO2 hydrogenation reaction [44]. As a result, the higher temperature therefore led to the higher CO2 conversion [13,14]. At reaction temperature of 260 °C under the condition without an external magnetic field, the maximum CO2 conversions at CO2/H2 molar ratios of 1:1–1:4 were 4.88, 5.64, 5.78, and 4.23%, respectively. The CO2 conversions were increased by 1.24, 1.50, and 1.34 times when external magnetic field was applied for CO2/H2 molar ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:4, respectively. Moreover, the highest CO2 conversions were obtained at the molar ratio of 1:3 for all reaction temperatures (the highest CO2 conversion is 8.45% at 260 °C)—this molar ratio was also a suitable stoichiometric molar ratio for methanol production [45]. This result indicated that the external magnetic field could improve the activity of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst through increasing the adsorption capacity of reactant molecules and its surface reaction on the magnetized catalyst. This result was confirmed by the significant enhancement in magnetic property and the adsorption of CO2 molecules over the surface of 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 magnetized catalyst as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Fig. 9 showed the product distribution obtained from CO2 hydrogenation over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst at various CO2/H2 molar ratios without (first column) and with a magnetic field (second column). The main products from both cases were methane (CH4), dimethyl ether (DME), methanol (CH3OH), and carbon monoxide (CO). Considering the product distribution based on CO2 conversion, CH3OH yield significantly increased under an external magnetic field, and was the highest at CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1:3. Under this condition, CH3OH yield increased 3.9 times compared to the condition without a magnetic field. At molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:4 under the condition without a magnetic field, CH4, C2H6, and DME were selectively produced at the temperature lower 220 °C. When the reaction temperature higher than 220 °C, CO was the main product because reversed water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) favored a higher reaction temperature [9,14]. When an external magnetic field was applied at 220 °C, CO could not be produced. The main product was methanol and it can be produced with the amounts of 25 and 10 times higher than those without a magnetic field for CO2/H2 molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:4, respectively. The external magnetic field could promote the methanol formation, and simultaneously retard CO formation. In addition, this result implied that the different CO2/H2 molar ratios directly affected the formation of different products over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst surface during CO2 hydrogenation [12]."
8,Energy conservation by the application of an external magnetic field,"3.3 Energy conservation by the application of an external magnetic field In order to clearly observe the energy saving in a magnetic field-assisted packed bed reactor, the rates of CO2 conversion reaction over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst at different CO2/H2 molar ratios operated at each reaction temperature were calculated, as shown in Fig. 10 and Table 2 . With a magnetic field, the highest rate of reaction was 0.899 gCO2/gCat-h at the CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1:3 and the reaction temperature of 260 °C. At this molar ratio, in order to obtain the reaction rates of 0.496 and 0.602 gCO2/gCat-h, the applied operating temperatures should be 187 and 200 °C, and 240 and 260 °C for the conditions with and without the use of an external magnetic field, respectively. The energy savings by the application of an external magnetic field were as high as 53 and 60 °C (savings relative to no use of a magnetic field), respectively. In order to compare the energy saving between the conventional process and the magnetic field-assisted process, the energy consumption to generate the magnetic field has to be taken into account. However, as the permanent magnet (Alnico magnet) was applied throughout the study with the estimated life time of approximately 10 years, the calculation of each process based on the monetary unit and payback period was then applied. Accordingly, the electric energy consumption was calculated from the total heat required to convert 100 kg/h of CO2. The calculation was based on the Alnico magnet price of 16.20 $/kg (December 2017: Alibaba group holding limited), and the reactor diameter of 0.67 m with the catalyst bed length of 1.67 m. The result of calculation is reported in Table 2. At the similar range of rates of reaction, the higher temperature savings then led to the higher saving cost per year and the shorter payback period. It is noteworthy that the payback periods are quite short as 0.14–0.75 year, indicating an economical potential of this process. In the meantime, the ecological perspective could also be successfully achieved as the reaction temperature saving in ease operating condition directly led to lowering the energy consumption, and therefore reduces the CO2 emission to the atmosphere as well. The application of the magnetic field therefore helps promote CO2 adsorption ability and methanol production. It facilitated a catalyzed reaction through magnetizing catalyst with intrinsic magnetic property, promoting the physicsorption and chemisorption of CO2 reactant molecules over the magnetized catalyst, and leading to the enhancement of catalyst performance in the reaction. Accordingly, an application of an external magnetic field in CO2 hydrogenation could not only enhance the reactant conversion, but also minimize waste production through selective production of methanol and DME, while improving the process energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emission to the atmosphere."
9,Conclusion,"In this work, the magnetic field-assisted packed bed reactor was successfully applied to improve the activity and selectivity of microporous Cu-Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite with intrinsic magnetic properties in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The CO2 conversion, as well as methanol production, was outstandingly improved. Under a magnetic field, the maximum CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity obtained were 1.7 and 2.24 times greater than those obtained without magnetic field at the temperature of 220 °C, respectively. CH3OH yield significantly increased under an external magnetic field, and was the highest at CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1:3. Under this condition, CH3OH yield increased by factors of 3.9 compared to the condition without a magnetic field. In addition, it should be noted that, at the same reaction rate under magnetic field the operating temperatures were significantly reduced compared to base cases without use of a magnetic field—by 31–33 °C, 53–60 °C, and 16–52 °C, over 10Cu-10Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst operated at CO2/H2 molar ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:4, respectively. The application of a magnetic field not only facilitates CO2 adsorption and methanol production over the magnetized catalysts, but also significantly reduces the operating temperature and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, the use of magnetic field-assisted reactor system should be considered as a sustainable innovation process for catalytic fuel productions from CO2 in terms of attaining a carbon-neutral process."
