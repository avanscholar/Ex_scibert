0,Introduction,"The requirement for new energy carrier is well established and the world's current use of hydrocarbons as a primary energy source is not sustainable [1]. As an energy carrier, hydrogen is the most attractive option with many ways to produce and utilize it [2]. Water electrolysis represents the most important process to produce hydrogen without evolution of CO2. Moreover, the process offers the way to covert electrical energy to chemical energy as hydrogen and oxygen production (Eq. (1)), which can further be converted back to electrical energy when needed. (1) 2 H 2 O → O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e - At the same time, O2 evolution is the most common anodic reaction coupled with most of the cathodic processes occurring in aqueous solutions (water electrolysis and metal electrowinning), which is an unavoidable side reaction in many anodic processes [3]. The major problems in hydrogen and oxygen production from water electrolysis are high energy consumption, mainly due to the high production and investment cost. In recent days, researchers are considered the following things during preparation of electrocatalysts: the minimization of the platinum metal loading; alloying of platinum with transition metals to improve catalytic activity (Pt–Co, Pt–Ni, Pt–Fe, Pt–Ru, Pt–Pd, Pt–Rh and Pt–Sn catalysts) [4,5]; using of comparatively stable mixed oxides to increase the long time stability of electrode, to improve product selectivity and/or to minimize overpotentials. Now-a-days, electrode based on dispersed precious metal on an inert high area substrate (most commonly, formulated from carbon powder) is one of the workhorses of electrochemical technology [6]; as on the longer timescale of pilot plant operation, precious metals like platinum is often found to corrode significantly [7]. During the selection of suitable electrocatalysts, the support material always takes an important role. Besides the enhancement of real surface area, in a supported catalyst system one may still find benefit, is so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) [8]. This interaction can improve the effectiveness of catalytically active metal. In various literatures it has been reported that, the metals supported by reducible VIII group metal oxides, primarily by TiO2 can enhance the activity of the active metal [9,10]. TiO2 has been widely studied previously as one of the semi conductive oxides for its special photoelectric properties [11–14]. In addition, it is very stable in acidic solution and TiO2 electrode has been reported in the literature as the support of platinum [6,15]. Now-a-days, titania hollow spheres have received enormous attention due to their excellent properties as a photocatalyst and wide ranges of applications [16,17]. The submicrometer-sized titania hollow spheres with tunable shell thickness, large surface area, and void volume by employing sulfonated polystyrene (PS) latex particles as a template, can enhance electrocatalytic property in great extent when they would be doped by suitable metals. Thus, TiO2 hollow micro-spheres have been chosen as the supporting material in the present study. For O2 evolution reaction, IrO x is the most widely investigated electrocatalyst which has proved to be ∼20 times longer service life than that of the equivalent RuO2 [18]. Otherwise, IrO x is much more expensive than RuO2, and its activity is slightly lower [19]. An extensive search therefore has been carried out in the laboratory for addition of suitable combination of O2 evolution electrocatalysts to save the cost and/or to improve the coating property. It was found that IrO x –Ta2O5 was the best pair among various combinations. Other O2 evolution electrocatalysts of interest include IrO x –TiO2–CeO2 [20] and SnO2–CuCo2O4 [21]. In the literature, SnO2 has been used mostly in O2 evolution electrocatalysts to increase the electrochemical stability of the catalyst and as a dispersing material. But actually SnO2 is a semiconductor by itself, which can enhance the conductivity at the surface of the catalyst to a great extent. More importantly, there is similar physicochemical property between TiO2 and SnO2, and both have wide band gaps (TiO2 ∼3.05eV; SnO2 ∼3.5eV) [19]; therefore the combination is expected to show enhanced electrochemical stability in acidic solution during electrolysis process. At the same time, SnO2–TiO2 hollow sphere combination can reduce the cost of electrocatalyst for the whole system as SnO2 is cheaper than the other popular hydrogen and oxygen evolution oxide electrocatalysts. The major objectives of the present studies are to investigate the possibility of using Sn doped TiO2 hollow spheres prepared at different compositions (20, 40, and 60wt% of Sn) and at various calcination temperatures (200, 250, and 300°C) by using PSA latex as a template material; and to examine the electrocatalytic properties of the hollow spheres in the acidic solution and evaluate their electrochemical stability for long time."
1,Experiment,
2,Preparation of hollow spheres,"2.1 Preparation of hollow spheres In the preparation of TiO2 hollow spheres, poly(styrene-methacrylic acid) latex particles have been used as a template, of which surface of the core particle contained carboxylic groups. The PSA latex spheres are prepared using the following method: 0.2g of potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) was dissolved in 160ml of deionized (DI) water and heated to 80°C under nitrogen atmosphere with stirring at 300rpm. Fifty-four milliliter of styrene was added to this solution, followed by the addition of 2ml of methacrylic acid after 20min, and it was maintained for 24h. The obtained particles were cooled down to ambient temperature, filtered, and dried in oven [22]. The diameter of PSA latex spheres were about 450–550nm. In the preparation process of titania hollow spheres, Ti(SO4)2 and CTACl (cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) have been used as precursor of titania and surfactant, respectively. Requisite amount of Ti(SO4)2 was added into 32ml of DI water under vigorous stirring followed by an addition of PSA latex particles, 0.8ml of HCl, and 1.98ml of CTACl. The mixture was then kept for ageing at 70°C for 12h, cooled to ambient temperature, centrifuged, washed with DI water and ethanol (1:1, v/v), and dried at 60°C for 12h. The synthesis method of titania hollow spheres has also been described in detail in our previous work [23,24]. After the synthesis of pure TiO2 hollow spheres particles, 20, 40, and 60wt% of tin was loaded over spheres by using SnCl2·2H2O solution in HCl as precursor. The Sn doped TiO2 hollow sphere particles have been prepared as follows: appropriate amount of pure TiO2 was added into 32ml of DI water under vigorous stirring followed by the addition of 0.8ml of HCl, 1.98ml of CTACl, and requisite amount of SnCl2·2H2O solution in HCl. The mixture was then aged at 70°C for 12 h; then cooled, centrifuged, and washed with DI water, same as during the preparation of pure TiO2 particles. The obtained particles were treated at various calcination temperatures of 200, 250, and 300°C at a rate of 1°Cmin−1 in air and kept for 4h."
3,Surface and thermal characterizations of hollow spheres,"2.2 Surface and thermal characterizations of hollow spheres The Sn doped TiO2 hollow sphere catalysts have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology on a D/MAX-3C equipment of Rigaku Denki Co. Ltd. by using Cu Kα radiation and a fixed powder source (30kV, 15mA) were used; applied scan rate was 2° (2θ)/min. Specific surface areas of the catalysts was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms using Micromeritics ASAP equipment, model 2010 at 77.35K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the hollow spheres have been performed in Shimadzu TGA-50H apparatus by heating up to 700°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 under air atmosphere (30mlmin−1). The morphologies of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. SEM and TEM have been performed in JSM-6400 and JEM-2010, respectively."
4,Preparation of cell and electrochemical characteristics of catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of cell and electrochemical characteristics of catalysts The catalyst powder was mixed with Nafion solution (Dupont, 5% solution, equivalent 110g/mol) and solvent (mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol) under sonicating water bath for 20min for catalyst ink preparation. The catalyst ink was casted onto water-proofed carbon-cloth (1cm×1cm), and dried at 70°C in air to remove solvent (water and alcohol). The casting process was followed repeatedly to load approximately 2mg of catalyst onto the carbon cloth. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell with Potentiostat/Galvanostat (WonATech, WPG100) by using Ag/AgCl in 3M KCl solution as reference and Pt plate (1cm×1cm) as counter electrode in a 0.1N H2SO4 solution. The cyclic voltammetry data were recorded in the potential range of −1.2 to 2.0V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode with a scan rate of 40, 80, and 100mVs−1. The anodic polarization curves were recorded with a potential scan rate of 0.5mVs−1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural and thermal properties of hollow spheres,"3.1 Structural and thermal properties of hollow spheres Fig. 1 represents the XRD patterns of various Sn doped TiO2 catalysts with different compositions after calcination of the samples at 300°C. The results illustrate the presence of rutile TiO2 crystal phase in prepared hollow spheres, which is known as a stable matter in strong acidic or basic solution, without showing any crystalline peak such as anatase phase. The diffraction peaks around 27°, 34°, 38°, and 52° were found, which are ascribed to (111), (101), (200) and (211) planes of tetragonal rutile structures of SnO2, respectively [19,25,26]; whereas, the rutile structure of TiO2 has been described by the peaks around 28° (110), 36° (101), 41° (111) and 55° (211). From the XRD patterns it can be concluded that, the intensity of the peaks for SnO2 have diminished with decrease in the amount of loading of Sn on the hollow spheres. XRD patterns of 20 and 40wt% Sn/TiO2 have shown that, the intensity of SnO2 peaks are considerably low; only the rutile TiO2 peaks are prominent. It indicates the possibility of incorporation of SnO2 particles into the hollow spheres, resulting in the scarcity of SnO2 phase on the surface of the hollow spheres. Fig. 2 shows the XRD curves of 40wt% Sn/TiO2 samples calcined at various temperatures (200, 250, and 300°C). The peak intensity for SnO2 phase increased with rise in the calcination temperature indicating the critical growth of tin on the surface of the catalysts. Thermal analysis of 40% Sn/TiO2 hollow spheres without heat treatment was carried out from 25 to 700°C by the TGA method. In Fig. 3 it has been shown that, a weight loss between 210 and 344.4°C can be assigned to evaporation of the water from the sample. In the region between 350 and 500°C, the weight loss phenomenon was related to the burning out of the organic residues such as PSA latex and surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTACl). It was also found that in the 40wt% Sn/TiO2 hollow sphere sample, the total mass percentage of removed matter is about 68%. BET surface area analysis has been carried out for the 40wt% Sn doped TiO2 hollow sphere samples calcined at different temperatures. The results have shown the surface area values of 20.821, 52.412 and 113.335m2 g−1 for the samples with 200, 250, and 300°C calcination temperatures, respectively; which indicate the inclining surface area values with increase in the calcination temperature. Actually, water has removed from the catalysts at this temperature range, and the surface of spheres has started cracking slowly with increase in the calcination temperature, resulted in the higher surface area value in the catalyst calcined at comparative higher temperature. The SEM images of 20, 40, and 60wt% Sn doped TiO2 hollow spheres calcined at 300°C have been shown in Fig. 4 (A)–(C), respectively. Similarly, Fig. 5 (A) represents the TEM image of uncalcined TiO2 hollow sphere sample; whereas Fig. 5(B) and (C) represent the TEM images of 40wt% Sn doped TiO2 sample calcined at 300°C. Diameter of pure TiO2 hollow spheres and Sn doped samples were found in the range of 1–1.2 and 0.4–0.6μm, respectively. It is seen that, the size of the tin doped titania sample has been shrunk to some extent during heat treatment, and shown smaller size than that of pure TiO2 sample. It is also observed from the TEM images that the SnO2 has formed almost uniform layer over TiO2 spheres; but the bare TiO2 surface is also present somewhere on the hollow spheres. SEM pictures of 70 and 80wt% Sn loaded TiO2 samples calcined at 300°C have also been taken, which reveal the absence of hollow spheres in the catalysts. It means that, titania cannot sustain their hollow sphere structures with loading of tin over 60wt%. But SEM images of tin doped titania samples calcined over 300°C have not been taken in the present study."
7,Electrochemical properties of hollow spheres,"3.2 Electrochemical properties of hollow spheres 3.2.1 Cyclic voltammetry The electrochemical characteristics of Sn/TiO2 hollow spheres of different compositions and calcination temperatures were first determined by cyclic voltammetry, and typical recorded voltammograms with scan rate of 100mVs−1 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . In the CVs of Sn/TiO2 hollow sphere catalysts, three anodic peaks (a 1, a 2, and b 1) and three cathodic peaks (b 2, a 3, and a 4) can be distinguished. The anodic peak current density value (approx. 7mAcm−2) is almost same for all the hollow sphere samples. The large void space of sub-micrometer hollow sphere particles has enhanced the adsorption of oxygen over the catalyst surface, and resulted in the high anodic current density at around 2.0V. Here, peak b 1 has been considered as oxygen evolution, whereas a 3 and a 4 are attributed to hydrogen evolution. The peaks a 1, a 2, a 3, and a 4 have been interpreted in the literature as weakly and strongly bonded hydrogen adatoms on the catalyst surface [4,27–29]. In the hydrogen desorption region (anodic), a 1 and a 2 are considered as the hydrogen desorption from the bulk of the metal together with desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the metal surface [4]. Similarly, a 3 and a 4 are considered as the molecular hydrogen evolution during cathodic sweep. Our results show that (CVs shown in Fig. 6), hydrogen desorption peaks a 1 and a 2 are most intense for 60wt% Sn/TiO2 catalyst and peaks became less intense with decrease in the loading of tin; although the positions of peaks were almost same (a 1 ∼−0.3V; a 2 ∼0.15V) for every catalysts. On the other hand, cathodic peaks (a 3 and a 4) for hydrogen production are largest for 20wt% Sn-doped TiO2 sample, and the lesser intense peaks appear in the catalysts with greater tin loading on the titania hollow spheres; at the same time the peaks change their positions and trends. Similarly, a single peak (b 2) during cathodic sweep attributed to the oxygen reduction (at 1.21V) is also observed most prominently in 20wt% Sn/TiO2 sample; which is faded away consecutively with increase in the tin loading. In the case of 40wt% Sn/TiO2 samples with different calcination temperatures (200, 250, and 300°C) (CVs shown in Fig. 7), hydrogen desorption peaks are more prominent for the samples with less calcination temperatures; whereas the cathodic peaks (a 3 and a 4) for molecular hydrogen production became less intense with decrease in the calcination temperature. The electrochemical activity regarding hydrogen production has clearly been increased with higher calcinations temperatures; resulting from the intense growth of both TiO2 and SnO2 phase on the surface of the hollow spheres at higher calcinations temperature. On the other hand, cyclic voltammogram of pure TiO2 hollow sphere has shown quite lower electrocatalytic activity in hydrogen and oxygen production. The peaks for hydrogen desorption (a 1) and production (a 3) are very less intense in comparison to those of tin-doped titania samples. Similarly, the value of anodic peak current density (b 1) (regarding to oxygen production) was also quite lesser than that of tin doped catalysts; at the same time pure titania hollow sphere has not shown any activity in oxygen reduction (peak b 2) process. It means that, the doping of tin over titania hollow spheres has enhanced the electrocatalytic activity considerably in hydrogen and oxygen production during electrolysis. Fig. 8 represents the typical voltammograms of 40wt% Sn doped TiO2 sample (calcined at 300°C), which were recorded as a function of sweep rate (40, 80, and 100mVs−1). Although the anodic and cathodic peak positions were almost symmetrical, but the peak current density difference between anodic and cathodic peaks increased with rise in the sweep rate value. Fig. 9 (A) and (B) show the relationship between the anodic and cathodic peak currents (i p) and the square root of the scan rate (v 0.5) at low and high potential region, respectively. It is seen that, the peak current (i p) has satisfactory linear relationship with v 0.5, which means cathodic and anodic peak current is proportional to the square root value of potential scan rate. Kodintsev and Trasatti [30] have been proposed the following reaction mechanism for hydrogen production on oxide electrodes due to the fact that the surface on these types of electrodes is hydrated to a certain extent: (2) M - OH + H + + e - = M - OH 2 * (3) M - OH 2 * = M - OH 2 (4) M - OH 2 + H + + e - = M - H + H 2 O (5) M - H + H 2 O = M - OH + H 2 The mechanism has suggested that hydroxyl species participates in the overall reaction adsorbed on the surface, and the reaction step for the formation of surface compounds must be included into the overall mechanism. It is known from the literature that Eq. (3) will be the rate determining step for overall reaction, if hydrogen is strongly bonded with the metal surface [3]. In our case, both tin oxide and titania show strong adsorption property for hydrogen [31,32]; thus the rate determining step for overall reaction is Eq. (3) in the present experiment, the step for a spillover effect of adsorbed hydrogen. On the basis of existing knowledge, as well as on the basis of the experimental results in this study, hydrogen and oxygen production can be explained as follows: According to surface studies and voltammograms, the samples with more intense rutile TiO2 phase and less intense SnO2 are better in their hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction; on the other hand desorption reactions of adsorbed hydrogen (anodic sweep) have taken place more prominently in the samples with greater loading of tin, and calcined at lower temperatures (200 and 250°C). It means the contribution of both SnO2 and TiO2 made the catalysts good in electrochemical process. As we know from the literature that both the oxides are oxygen deficient in nature, thus both could create oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, especially on the (110) phase of SnO2 and TiO2 [31,32]. Similarly, they both show strong adsorption property for hydrogen. Thus, oxygen and hydrogen are adsorbed in great extent on the large surface of the hollow sphere and also may adsorb into the void sphere of the catalysts; as we have already seen from surface studies that, in the case of 20 and 40wt% Sn loaded TiO2 sample, the SnO2 phase is not so prominent on the surface and which might have incorporated into the sphere structure of TiO2 through the hollows and resulting in the high oxygen and hydrogen evolution for the 20 and 40wt% Sn/TiO2 samples. Generally, on a metal oxides/aqueous solution interface, surface species are either H+, adsorbed on O2− ions, or OH− adsorbed on metal ions. In the acidic solutions, H+ species are present mostly. But at the cathodic potential sweep, reduced species, Sn2+ and Ti3+ ions, are produced on the surface of hollow spheres, which manifest itself in cyclovoltammetry by symmetric CVs with respect to potential axis, characteristic otherwise of the surface processes [33,34]. Generally, the adsorption and diffusion processes of oxygen on semiconductor oxides are mainly ascribed to the oxygen vacancies of the oxides. The adsorption of oxygen at vacancies is resulting in the charge shifting and leading to an alteration of the local electronic structure on the semiconductor surface. At the same time, the reductions of oxides create more oxygen vacancies on the surface [35]. For reduction of oxygen one of the dioxygen bonds needs to be opened. In this case, during cathodic sweep partial O2 reduction proceeds through the interaction of oxygen with reduced Ti3+ and Sn2+ ions; which generate more at a sufficiently large cathodic potential. Actually on catalyst surface mainly consisting of Ti4+ and Sn4+ matrix, thus rare reduced ions act as electron excess sites. Therefore, oxygen molecules always compete for reduced metal ion sites, and the molecules may be unsymmetrically, with only one oxygen atom bonded to the surface, resulting in the reduction of oxygen. This oxygen reduction phenomenon therefore precedes the hydrogen evolution during the process. 3.2.2 Anodic polarization After the cyclic voltammetry measurements, anodic polarization curves were recorded for 40wt% Sn doped TiO2 calcined at different temperatures, by stepping up the potential anodically with a scan rate of 0.5mVs−1 to establish the electrocatalytic performance of the hollow spheres towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Fig. 10 shows the performance of the hollow sphere samples was evaluated up to current densities of 50mAcm−2. The potential at 1mAcm−2 is used to exhibit the performance of the electrocatalysts without the influence of ohmic resistivity and high bubble formation, therefore the majority of the overpotential will be due to anode reaction at this current density. Contrastingly, the potential at higher current densities will be affected by ohmic resistivity and bubble formation, and thus show the performance under real operating conditions [2]. It is evident from the results that the low current cell voltage value is almost same in all the hollow sphere samples; whereas the catalyst calcined at higher temperatures (300°C) has shown comparatively lower overpotential value at high current densities (around 40–50mAcm−2). Thus it is clear from the results that, the tin-doped titania hollow sphere electrocatalysts with higher calcination temperatures have shown comparatively lower overpotential value in oxygen evolution process. 3.2.3 Tafel slope Tafel slope is 135mV in the present case for the catalysts with 40wt% of tin loading over titania hollow sphere. Generally, water molecules are behaving as reacting particles in oxygen evolution from acid solution. Therefore, the primary discharge would form an unstable intermediate OH* which changes to a more stable OH: (6) H 2 O → OH ad * + H + + e - (7) OH ad * → OH ad Usually, Tafel slopes of 60 and 120mV predict the reaction (7) and (6) as rate determining step, respectively. Another possibility for which a Tafel slope 60mV predicted, could be reaction (6) followed by a second electron transfer with adsorption of intermediate [36]. But the high value of observed Tafel slope might be attributed to transition of r.d.s. from reaction (7) to reaction (6). This value is actually very close to that of pure SnO2 reported by Pauli and Trasatti [37]. 3.2.4 Stability test Twenty wt% Sn doped TiO2 hollow sphere sample (calcined at 300°C) was subjected for long time tests to evaluate the electrochemical stability of the electrocatalysts at potentiostatic condition. Cyclic voltammograms have been performed after every 1 for 72h, and the peak current density has been plotted with the time in Fig. 11 . The results show the stable peak current density value after long time test also, which reveals the electrochemical stability of the Sn doped TiO2 hollow spheres in acidic media. There are many factors which can affect the stability of the electrodes and electrocatalysts. Firstly, in the present case, hollow sphere structure of the catalysts enhances the adhesion quality towards carbon cloth. Thus, the catalysts ink was stuck with the substrate for long time and has shown stable electrochemical activity. Secondly, the stable nature of SnO2 and TiO2 in acid solution has also activated the stability of the overall catalyst structures."
8,Conclusions,"Sn doped TiO2 hollow spheres of different compositions (20, 40, and 60wt%) and calcinations temperatures (200, 250, and 300°C) were synthesized by using PSA latex as template material and examined as electrocatalysts in acid solution. The presence of rutile SnO2 and TiO2 phases have been confirmed using XRD studies; whereas SEM and TEM analysis have confirmed the hollow sphere structures of the samples. In cyclic voltammetry studies, all the catalysts have shown peaks for hydrogen and oxygen production. The peak for hydrogen evolution is intense in 20 and 40wt% Sn doped TiO2 samples calcined at 300°C. At the same time, anodic and cathodic peak current (i p) has shown linear relationship with the square root of potential scan rate value (v 0.5) during CV analysis. The performances of the hollow sphere catalysts were evaluated up to current densities of 50mAcm−2 in anodic polarization measurement. It is evident from the polarization curves that the tin-doped titania hollow sphere electrocatalysts with higher calcination temperatures have shown comparatively lower overpotential value oxygen evolution process. Sn/TiO2 hollow sphere electrocatalysts have also shown long time electrochemical stability in acidic media."
