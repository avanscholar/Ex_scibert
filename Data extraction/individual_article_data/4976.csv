0,Introduction,"The fabrication ofelectrochemical energy storage devices is pivotal for harvesting green energy from the discontinuous energy resources. The ions hybrid supercapacitors are assembled by ion adsorption/desorption as a power source and metal ions oxidation/reduction or insertion/desertion process as an energy source [1–4]. Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, consisting of a redox-type Zn foil with Zn2+ deposition/Zn stripping and a capacitive carbon materials cathode with reversible electrolyte ion adsorption/desorption, are considered as one of the most attractive storage candidates due to the high theoretical capacity of 820 mAh/g (Zn/Zn2+). However, restricted by insufficient adsorption sites of activated carbon cathodes, the energy capacities of Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors are inferior to the expectation, especially at high power output [5]. To match high energy density of zinc anodes, different carbon materials as cathodes were intensively investigated including carbon nanotubes[6], hierarchically porous carbon [7,8], and carbon nanosheets [9,10] to enhance the electrochemical capacity of Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. For example, hollow carbon microspheres acted as the cathode to assemble the Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, which exhibited a high energy density of 129.3 Wh/kg at 266.4 W/kg [11]. Phosphorus dopant in honeycomb-like carbon could enhance pseudo-capacitance by improving the reaction of the –OH and Zn ions [12]. However, the effective applications of these carbon-based materials in large scale are greatly hindered by tedious preparation process and the high manufacturing cost [13,14]. Therefore, the green and sustainable biomass-based carbon materials have the potential as cathodes material for hybrid supercapacitors [15]. The major advantages of using biomass as a green precursor of carbon material are due to its low-cost, rich natural resources, and environment friendliness [16–18]. To improve charge/ion transfer capability, biomass-based carbon materials with regular morphologies such as carbon nanosheets [19] honeycomb-like carbon [20] carbon nanofibers [21] and carbon microtubes [22] have received considerable attention. Depending on their structural and surface characteristics, these carbon materials exhibit decent electrochemical performances. For example, Wang et al. converted peanut skin into nanometer-scale sheet-like carbon materials with hierarchically porous structure and high surface area [23]. However, the features of biomass-based carbon materials are usually subject to the morphology and the structure parameters of the parent biomass, making the control of the thickness/size of carbon in the form of nanosheets, nanofiber or nanotube difficult. In addition, to enrich adsorption sites of the biomass-derived carbon cathodes, an activation process is generally necessary. However, the activation process with the involvement of the toxic or strongly corrosive chemical reagents (KOH, ZnCl2, H3PO4 etc.) include tedious steps and are not eco-friendly [24]. Moreover, the etching reagents usually feature with rich microporosity with rudimentary meso/macropore structure, resulting in high capacitance but low rate capability [25]. The design of the structures of the carbon materials from plastic biomass via a “bottom-up” approach could be a potential solution to solve such issues. Bio-oil contains the derivatives of sugars such as acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols, furans and the lignin derived phenols as well as water (15–30 wt%) [26]. Although bio-oil is widely regarded as the feedstock for the production of biofuels via hydrotreatment, the effective deoxygenation of the organic components in bio-oil, especially the heavy ones, is rather difficult, due to their complicated composition, high viscosity and high molecular mass [27,28]. Nevertheless, the heavy fraction of bio-oil has the high carbon content, little to nil ash content, good plasticity and very high tendency towards polymerization, which thus could serve as a structurally designable precursor to produce carbon cathodes for ions supercapacitors [29]. In addition, it needs to note that the polymerization of the heavy fraction of bio-oil is disarranged, and the use of structure-directing agent could induce the polymerization with designated sequence and form the carbon materials with the anticipative porous structures. Hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HOFs) are frameworks structure assembled from the organic units through hydrogen bonding interactions during the crystallization [30]. The building-up processes of HOFs are much gentler, quicker and could be better adjusted by different crystallization conditions than other frameworks [31]. Nevertheless, the application of HOFs is heavily limited by their poor stability from the rather weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which make the HOFs framework easy to decompose. In view of the regular crystallization morphology and porous characteristic of HOFs, they were applied as a morphology-directing and pore-tailoring agent to assist the formation of anticipated carbon materials. HOFs crystals were directly removed on account of these poor thermostability during carbonization. Herein, the poor stability, regular crystallization morphology and porous characteristic of HOFs were excavated to assist the polymerization of the heavy fraction of bio-oil for the formation of carbon cathodes with the tailored structures and pore distributions. A HOFs reconstructed with melamine and cyanuric acid was selected, which can be rapidly synthesized by recrystallization at room temperature. The heavy fraction of bio-oil was coated on the HOFs to obtain bio-oil@HOFs composites, which was carbonized to prepare the carbon materials without post-processing. Our results demonstrated that the polymerization of the heavy fraction of bio-oil duplicated the crystallization morphology of HOFs that played the roles of templating while was further removed on account of its poor stability. In addition, the pyrolysis gases served as the agents for activation to enrich the active sites for avoiding the use of corrosive chemical reagents. The degree of graphitization and the contents of pyridine nitrogen for carbon materials could be flexibly adjusted with the contents of HOFs. The obtained carbon material as cathode for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor exhibited an energy density up to 117.5 Wh/kg at 890 W/kg and maintained 60.7 Wh/kg even at 16.2 kW/kg, due to the high utilization rate of active sites, desirable pore distribution and flower-like morphology for enhancing the transfer of electrolyte ions and electron."

3,Synthesis of the HOFs,"2.2 Synthesis of the HOFs 0.01 mol of melamine and 0.01 mol of cyanuric acid were dissolved with stirring in 50 mL and 25 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, respectively. After dissolution, both were mixed together for 1 min at room temperature to generate white precipitates. Subsequently, the precipitates were gathered by filtered. The solvent dimethylsulfoxide was circularly utilized."
4,Synthesis of the carbon materials,"2.3 Synthesis of the carbon materials The bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of wheat straw at 500 °C in a moving bed reactor was used. The bio-oil after the collection was naturally separated into an aqueous phase and a bottom phase that was termed as the heavy fraction of bio-oil. The route for the synthesis of the flower-like carbon material with the heavy fraction of bio-oil and the HOFs was illustrated in Fig. 1 and Flowchart 1 . Firstly, the HOFs in the form of flower-like microspheres were prepared by mixing melamine and cyanuric acid at room temperature. Secondly, the heavy fraction of bio-oil was coated on the HOFs by grinding both in an agate mortar for 20 min to obtain bio-oil@HOFs composites. Finally, the obtained bio-oil@HOFs were carbonized at 800 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min to obtain BH-x (x = 1, 4, 8 representing the mass ratios of HOFs to bio-oil). The heavy fraction of bio-oil was carbonized and activated with potassium oxalate at 800 °C for 1 h, which was termed as BO."
5,Morphological and structural characterization,"2.4 Morphological and structural characterization The structures of the samples were tested with a Regulus 8100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) manipulated at 5 kV (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) and transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100 plus, JEOL) under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV) coupled with Cu-K ∝ radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a scanning rate at 10 ˚/min and step size of 0.02˚. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption data were record in an ASAP 2020 instrument at 77 K. Raman measurements were performed on a LabRAM HR Evolution (France) with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. Thermogravimetric (TG) behavior of sample was carried out under N2 flow from 20 to 800 °C with a 10 °C /min heating rate by a thermogravimetric analyzer (Rigaku, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure characterizations,"3.1 Morphology and structure characterizations The morphology of the HOFs were analysed by SEM and TEM. Figure S1a showed that the as-prepared HOFs material exhibited a spherical morphology with a diameter of 3–5 µm. The TEM images in Figure S1b and S1d showed that the HOFs microsphere owned a well stack structure constructed by petals-like nanosheets. In addition, these interlaced HOFs nanosheets can produce large amounts of voids (Figure S1c), which were vital for homogeneously impregnating and coating bio-oil onto the nanosheets of HOFs. Figure S2a showed an X-ray diffraction pattern of HOFs, which was different from those of melamine and cyanuric acid, implying the formation of new crystals. The three peaks, 11.16, 18.78, and 21.68°, can be indexed as (100), (110), and (200) plane of HOFs, respectively [32]. An intense peak at 27.9° was attributed to (002) plane of HOFs, which showed that the HOFs owned graphite-like stacking of individual 2D sheets with a d-spacing of 0.320 nm [32]. The results for the TG-MS characterization in Figure S3 suggested that the HOFs began to decompose from 350 ℃ and could be gasified almost completely at approximately 500 ℃ with the release of significant amount of CO2. In view of these thermal behaviors, the sphere-like HOFs thus was confirmed to have the potential for the application as a self-decomposed template during the carbonization and the released CO2 can be used as agent to etch the carbonaceous materials. The morphologies of theobtained BH-xcarbon materials were shown in Fig. 2 . The SEM images (Fig. 2a-c) indicated that the BH-x carbon materials owned a typical flower-like structure, which was consisted of interconnecting carbon nanosheets. As shown in Figure S4, the SEM of BO revealed the morphology of carbon materials from polymerization of the heavy fractions of bio-oil without the auxiliary of HOFs templates was irregular particle, which was different from those of BH-x. Fig. 2d showed that the cracked mesopores distributed relatively evenly across the petal-like carbon surface of BH-1 (as marked in red arrow). With the increase of HOFs contents, the cracked mesopores evolved into the macroporous holes in the carbon nanosheets for BH-4 and BH-8. The penetrable meso/macropores ensured that the transport of electrolyte ions across the petal-like carbon nanosheets [33]. Thus, the expanding of the pores size was probably attributed to the increase of HOFs templates and the self-released CO2 activating agent from the pyrolysis of HOFs. As shown in Fig. 2g, 2 h and 2i, BH-x displayed carbon networks morphology consisting of the interconnected nanosheets. The thickness of nanosheets decreased with increasing mass ratios of HOFs to bio-oil from 1 to 8. BH-1 exhibited the compact flake morphology, which has the striking contrast to the loose networks of BH-8. The HRTEM images of BH-1 (Fig. 2j) showed no lattice fringes, implying irregular arrangement of the carbon atoms. The HRTEM images of BH-4 and BH-8 (Fig. 2k and 2 l) contained lattice fringes of short-range graphite-like nanocrystallites (as marked in red cycle). The lattice texture of BH-8 was more orderly distributed than that of BH-4. Contrast HRTEM images of Fig. 2k, 2j and 2 l indicated that the sheets HOFs crystals can induce carbon atoms to orderly arrange into lattice. The microcosmic morphology of the BH-x demonstrated that the as obtained HOFs crystals could be applied as morphology-directing agents to form the flower-like nanostructure. Meanwhile, the HOFs templates simultaneously played the role for the activation to produce the penetrating meso/macropores. The crystal structure and degree of graphitization of BO, BH-1, BH-4 and BH-8 samples were determined by XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the XRD patterns showed two distinct diffraction peaks, which are corresponded to the (002) and (100) crystal planes of graphitic carbon, respectively [34]. BO samples showed a (002) diffraction peak at around 2θ of 20.0°, which suggests the presence of amorphous carbon. Obviously, the (002) peak for BH-x carbon materials shifted to the high angle direction from 21.9° to 25.0° with the increase of HOFs crystal templates, indicating more regular (002) crystal planes tend to that of graphite [28]. Evidently, the HOFs crystal as the induction agent was conducive to the formation of the graphitic-like structure carbon during the carbonization, as also evidenced by TEM results. The Raman spectra of four samples were shown in Fig. 3b. Two obvious bands could be observed at ca. 1335 and 1584 cm−1, representing the defects/disordered sp3 carbon (D band) and ordered sp2 graphitic carbons (G band), respectively. The intensity ratios of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) were correlated with the degree oforder of graphite-like crystallite [35], and theID/IG ratios of BO, BH-1, BH-4 and BH-8 are 1.04, 1.01, 0.98 and 0.93, respectively.The ID/IG ratio of BO was higher than those of BH-x samples, indicating that BH-x possessed a higher degree of graphitization caused by the induction of HOFs crystal templates, which was in good agreement with the XRD results. In addition, the ratios diminished gradually with the increased proportion of HOFs crystal templates, which again illustrated the degree of graphitization of the graphitic-like structure carbon could be adjusted by sheets HOFs templates, as also evidenced by the XRD and TEM results. The conclusions of TEM, XRD and Raman characterization showed that the degree of graphitization of BH-x could be adjusted by the contents of HOFs. The porous structures of the samples were investigated by measuring their N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. 3c. It was clear that the isotherms of BH-x owned the combined characteristics of I/IV type with increasing nitrogen adsorption amount at P/P0 < 0.01 and hysteresis loop at 0.45 < P/P 0 < 0.95, which demonstrated the co-existence of numerous micropores and meso/macropores. The BO exhibited type I isotherm shape, indicating that it mainly contained micropores. The contrast showed that the pyrolysis and occupancy of the organic HOFs crystal generated abundant meso/macropores. The adsorption volume of N2 showed a sharp rise from BH-1 to BH-8, which confirmed that the BH-8 exhibited the maximal pore volume. The meso/macroporous structure could be beneficial for exposing more electrochemical-active sites and for enhancing the diffusion of electrolytes. The detailed data of textural characteristics of BO and BH-x were listed in Table 1 . Notably, BH-4 showed an hierarchical porous structure with a high specific surface area (1076.3 m2/g), a large micropore volume (0.45 cm3/g) and meso/macroporous volume (2.14 cm3/g). The specific surface area and microporous volume of BH-4 were larger than those of BH-1, which was caused by the presence of more HOFs. However, the excessive HOFs activation resulted in the reduction of specific surface area and microporous volume of BH-8. Due to the presence of the most abundant HOFs crystal in the precursors of BH-8, it owned the biggest meso/macroporous volume (2.95 cm3/g). As shown in Fig. 2d, the pore size distribution exhibited that the pore size of BH-1 concentrated in the mesoporous range. While, the pore size of BH-4 and BH-8 centered in the macroporous range. These results were consisted with the observation with SEM (Fig. 1d, 1e and 1f). The conclusions of SEM and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms showed the pore types and pore volume could be regulated by the ratio of HOFs. The chemical states of the atoms were analyzed via XPS analysis, as shown in Figure S5 and Table S2. The XPS survey spectrum of BH-x showed the signals of 284.6 eV, 399.7 eV and 532.2 eV, which were assigned to C1s, N1s and O1s, respectively. This confirmed the successful co-doping of N and O on surface of BH-x with the individual contents of 1.85–2.51 wt% and 12.50–14.82 wt%, respectively [36,37]. While, the N signal peak was not observed in the XPS survey spectrum of BO, implying that no N existed in BO. The doped nitrogen of BH-x were originated from the HOFs crystals. As shown in Figure S6, the energy-dispersive spectrometer mapping images of BH-x samples also showed that O and N species are homogeneous distributed on C frameworks. The high-resolution spectrum of O 1 s of BH-x (Fig. 4 a) could be divided into three component peaks at 531.1 eV, 532.4 eV and 533.5 eV, representing CO, CO and COC oxygen-containing functional groups, respectively [8]. The contents of CO and COC functional groups for BH-x obviously were more abundant with the introduction of HOFs than those in BO. The CO groups could enhance the dual cation (H+ and Zn2+) chemical absorption for additional capacity to better match Zn anode for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors [7,8]. N 1 s spectra of BH-x (Fig. 4b) showed that the BH-x exhibited four nitrogen functional groups of pyridinic N (N-6), pyrrolic N (N-5), graphitic N (N-Q) and N-oxide (N-X), centered at 398.2 eV, 400.1 eV, 401.1 eV and 403.0 eV, respectively [38]. As shown in Table S2, the content of pyridinic nitrogen for BH-1 was 11%, which increased gradually to 18% (BH-4) and 30% (BH-8) with the addition of more HOFs to bio-oil. This might be attributed to the retention of nitrogen in triazine ring of HOFs during the pyrolysis. Pyridinic nitrogen was electroactive and prone to providing pseudo-capacitance as electron donor [39,40]. In addition, the pyridinic N possessed higher binding energy to chemically coordinate with Zn2+ than other N species for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors [41]. The contents of graphitic nitrogen showed the little change (42–44%) for BH-x. The existence of graphitic nitrogen can not only enhance the electronic conductivity but also offer additional defects for interacting with the electrolyte or improving the formation of the electrical double layer [40]. The content of pyridinic N could be adjusted by changing the HOFs proportion in the feedstock for preparation of the carbon materials."
8,Electrochemical properties of aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors,"3.2 Electrochemical properties of aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors The above characterizations showed that the as-obtained BH-x possessed flower-like structure, penetrable meso/macropores, high degree of graphitization and abundant pyridine nitrogen, CO groups, which enabled high approachability of electrolyte ions, short diffusion distances for ions and electrons as well as strong chemical absorption for Zn2+. Owing to the above unique characteristics, BH-x could be a potential candidate as cathode material for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of BO and BH-x were tested as cathodes with Zn foam as anodes. Due to the combination of adsorption/desorption cathode and redox anode, the assembled Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (denoted Zn//BH-x) could store charge in virtue of anion adsorption/desorption in BH-x cathode and conduct reversibly via Zn/Zn2+ stripping/deposition in Zn anode [42,43]. Thus, an outstanding energy and power density could be achieved for the assembled Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, confirmed by electrochemical data (Fig. 4). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of four devices in 20 mV/s was shown in Fig. 5 a. The overflows of oxygen and hydrogen evolution were not observed, implying that Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors could work well between 0.1 and 1.8 V. Among the four Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, the enclosed area of Zn//BH-4 curve was much larger than those of Zn//BO, Zn//BH-1 and Zn//BH-8, confirming the highest capacity for Zn//BH-4. Fig. 5b, S7a, 4c and S7b presented the CV curves of Zn//BO, Zn//BH-1, Zn//BH-4 and Zn//BH-8 devices at different scan rates (2 mV/s-100 mV/s) ranging from 0.1 V to 1.8 V. It can be observed that the CV curves for Zn//BH-4 and Zn//BH-8 remained roughly in rectangular shape even at the high scan rate of 100 mV/s. While, the CV curves of Zn//BO and Zn//BH-1 exhibited a spindle shape at 100 mV/s. This indicated that the flower-like carbon networks of BH-4 and BH-8 with penetrable macropores facilitated faster transfer of the ions and showed smaller resistance within the electrode than that of BO and BH-1. This obvious contrast meant that the high pore volume for accommodating electrolyte were conductive to accelerate electrochemical reaction rates. The electrochemical tests of the four Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors were further studied by galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) curves from 1 to 20 A/g (Fig. 5d, S7c, 5e and S7b presenting Zn//BO, Zn//BH-1, Zn//BH-4 and Zn//BH-8). The specific capacity was calculated and shown in Fig. 5f, according to GCD curves. By computation, a Zn-ion storage capacity of 132 mAh/g was observed for BH-4 based Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors at a current density of 1 A/g, which was superior to those of BO, BH-1 or BH-8 based supercapacitors as well as other recently reported typical carbon-based Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (Table 2 ). BH-4 and BO possessed similar specific surface area and microporous volume, but the specific capacitance of Zn//BO was lower than that of Zn//BH-4. At lower current density, the specific capacities are closely correlated to specific surface areas and pore volumes [38]. This implied that the doped N of BH-4 enhanced ion adsorption, consequently improving the specific capacitance. At a high current density of 20 A/g, the capacitance retention rate of Zn//BO was only 28.5% (38 mAh/g), while almost twice of the capacitance retention (56.8%, 75 mAh/g) can be achieved for Zn//BH-4. This was attributed to the higher degree of graphitization, larger pore volume and penetrable macropores, ensuring the rapid electron transfer in the inner porous network and the fast electrolyte ion diffusion in the interface of cathode. The specific capacities at a low current density of BH-8 was lower than those of BH-4 because of its lower specific surface area and microporous volume. However, at a high current density of 20 A/g, they both showed the close specific capacitance. This was probably attributed to the larger pore volume of BH-8 for accommodating enough electrolyte ion. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a significant electrochemical means to analyze electron and ion transfer characteristic over the charging-discharging process. Nyquist plots of four Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors in Fig. 5g revealed the rapid ion and electron transport of the flower-like carbon cathodes. Four Nyquist curves possessed a semicircle peculiarity at relatively high frequencies and an approximate straight line at relatively low frequencies. The diameters of the semicircles meant the charge-transfer resistance in the carbon cathode (Rct), relating with adsorption kinetics of electrolyte ions [44]. The Rct values of Zn//BH-1, BH-4, and BH-8 Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors were about 26.8, 18.2, and 14.1 Ω, which were superior to that of Zn//BO (44.3 Ω) implying faster charge transfer in the flower-like carbon cathodes as compared to BO carbon cathode [8]. The straight-line slope was related to the Zn2+ and SO4 2- diffusion rates into the electrolyte at the low frequency regions. The relative steeper slopes of the Zn//BH-x than that of the Zn//BO were probably attributed to the N-doping and large pore volume, which improves the wettability and accommodating capacity of electrolyte into carbon cathodes [45]. Benefit from the prominent specific capacity and wide work voltage window, Zn//BH-4 owned the optimization energy density among the assembled devices, which achieved a high energy density of 117.5 Wh/kg at 890 W/kg and maintained 60.7 Wh/kg even 16.2 kW/kg (Fig. 5h). The decent energy-power output matched or even surpassed most of recent reported Zn ion supercapacitor devices (Table 2). This remarkable performance could be attributed to the abundant active sites from the removal of HOFs templates, the high electrolyte ion diffusion across the penetrable macropores into the carbon cathode as well as the improved adsorption capacity of Zn ion from pyridine N doping. In addition, the Zn//BH-4 exhibited decent cycling stability with a 90% retention as compared to the original capacity and high coulombic efficiency after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at 5 A/g (Fig. 5i), implying the superb electrochemistry stability of BH-4 cathode materials in the assembled device. Fig. 6 a exhibited the linear curves of the charging current and the corresponding scan rates of BO, BH-1, BH-4 and BH-8 at 0.15 V, in which the slope represents the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) [49]. Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) were calculated by the normalization of the double layer capacitance value of a smooth surface electrode (60 µF/cm2) [7]. BH-4 possessed similar specific surface area and microporous volume to those of BO, but owned more than three times ECSA (2083 cm2/g) than that of BO (580 cm2/g). The remarkable ECSA demonstrated that enough macropore enabled the internal sites of BH-4 accessibility to electrolyte ions. Meanwhile, the N dopants enriched the electrochemically active sites. The two energy storage patterns of capacitive-controlled and diffusion-controlled were quantitatively calculated according to the following equations [1,11]: (1) i V = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2 (2) i V / v 1 / 2 = k 1 v 1 / 2 + k 2 The capacitance contribution of storage capacity for Zn//BO and Zn//BH-4 gradually increased from 49% and 43% at 1 mV/s to 63% and 58% at 10 mV/s with increasing scan rates, respectively (Fig. 6b). The capacitance-dominated ratios for BO based Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor were higher to those of BH-4 based Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor. The higher diffusion contributions for the latter derived from the more pseudo-capacitance of N-doped carbon cathode."
9,Electrochemical properties of quasi-solid-state devices,"3.3 Electrochemical properties of quasi-solid-state devices To verify the practical energy storage application of the flower-like carbon electrodes, the quasi-solid-state supercapacitor was assembled by employing Zn foil as anode, BH-4 as cathode and ZnSO4/gelatin gel as electrolyte. Fig. 7 a showed CV curves of the device, which showed the energy storage mechanism of the quasi-solid-state Zn//BH-4 was similar to that of the aqueous device, indicating the well operation of the device in the ZnSO4/gelatin gel electrolyte. As shown Fig. 7b, the quasi-solid-state Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor possessed a maximum capacity of 77 mAh/g at 1 A/g (41 mAh/g still maintained when the current density was 10 A/g). From the capacity data of quasi-solid-state Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor, energy and power densities were recorded (Fig. 7c). The energy density achieved 65.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 850 W/kg. Besides, an energy density of 29.7 Wh/kg could be retained at a maximum power density of 7.3 kW/kg. The energy storage performance was remarkably superior to those reported for several supercapacitors, listed in Fig. 7c [11,50–54]. Herein, three Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor devices linked in series powered ten yellow LEDs in Fig. 7d. Therefore, the assembled quasi-solid Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors devices possessed a prominent potential in renewable energy storage."
10,Conclusion,"In this paper, the flower-like carbon materials from heavy fraction of bio-oil were synthesized with the assistance of hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HOFs) crystals and were applied as cathodes in Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. During the process of carbonization, HOFs crystals templates were directly removed on account of these poor thermostability, avoiding the tedious removal of templates. The degree of graphitization, pore volume and pyridine nitrogen content of flower-like carbon materials could be flexibly adjusted with the contents of HOFs. The penetrable meso/macropores across petal-like carbon were also generated, which were beneficial for electrolyte ion penetration and exchange to improve the electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the flower-like morphology, large pore volume and doping N heteroatom, BH-4 based aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor delivered a prominent capacity of 132 mAh/g at 1 A/g with a high maintance of 75 mA h/g at 20 A/g. The quasi-solid-state Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor achieved an energy density achieved of 65.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 850 W/kg and retained an energy density of 29.7 Wh/kg at 7.3 kW/kg. The work broadens a new horizon in exploring the application of the heavy fraction of bio-oil, which was difficult to upgrade quality by hydrogenation. Bio-oil, as a liquid with plasticity, is a promising candidate for the preparation of carbon materials with controllable structure and porosity for energy storage devices."
