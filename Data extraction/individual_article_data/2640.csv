0,Introduction,"Surface control of nanocrystals is one of the most extensively used methods to improve the catalytic performance of nanocrystals.[1–3,66] As an early example, manipulation of nanocrystal surfaces for shape control (e.g., cubic for (100) facets and octahedron for (111) facets) greatly affects the catalytic performance of a material.[4–10,68,69] Furthermore, higher indexes such as (310), (104), (553), and (410) are capable of providing unexpected outstanding catalytic performances in various fields.[11–14] In this regard, anisotropic growth of nanocrystal surfaces can provide a way to enhance catalytic activity, because it creates high-index facets with an abundance of highly active sites, such as undercoordinated atoms, steps, edges, and kinks.[3,15–18] However, for superior catalytic performance, not only the activation of reactants but also the selective activation for target reaction must be considered. Since the high-index facets generally facilitate the activation of molecules either we want or not, it remains a challenge to provide a selective activity toward the target reaction via the anisotropic growth of nanocrystals. As a green and mild production for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (DSHP) from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) would enable on-site production reducing the cost of the overall production procedure.[19–23,67] Moreover, the reaction is a typical example of a situation where the selective activation is essential for the catalytic performance. Since water (H2O) is thermodynamically more stable than H2O2, the chemical reaction between H2 and O2 usually leads preferential formation of H2O over H2O2,[24,25] indicating that both dissociation (activation) of H2 and un-dissociation of O2 are simultaneously necessary to improve the total yield of H2O2. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study reporting the effect of the anisotropic growth of nanocrystals in bimetallic systems on the catalytic performances for H2O2 direct synthesis; however, there are several studies reporting that high-index facets on nanocrystals accelerate H2O production in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),[26–28] which implies that the anisotropic growth generating the high-index facets may not have a beneficial effect in terms of the selectivity for H2O2 direct synthesis because of the accelerated H2O formation. In this perspective, the H2O2 direct synthesis is an interesting reaction to verify whether the anisotropic growth of nanocrystals can enhance the activity without a significant sacrifice of the selectivity. We got a hint of applying the anisotropic growth from our previous study of Pd-Pt nano-octahedron that reported an ideal improvement; simultaneous increase in H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity.[29] In addition, Pd is known as a prototypical catalyst for H2O2 direct synthesis,[30–32] and platinum (Pt) has electronegativity and lattice parameters similar to those of Pd.[33–35] Thus, the Pd@Pt structure is expected to be a good candidate to investigate the anisotropic growth effects by minimizing several factors, such as charge transfer and strain and to obtain better catalytic performance. Hence, we employed high-index Pt facets with Pd to give a positive effect on DSHP and this strategy successfully showed higher yield of H2O2 compared to Pd and Pt nanocrystals. Herein, we report the synthesis of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals via a simple route based on reduction in an aqueous solution in which Pt layers anisotropically grow on Pd nanocrystals and we first elucidate the growth mechanism by a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. A catalytic evaluation of the H2O2 direct synthesis with the Pd@Pt nanoscrystals reveals that they have better activity than pure Pd and Pt nanocubes (NCs), nevertheless, H2O2 selectivity of Pd@Pt is higher than that of Pd, in which Pd generally has a higher H2O2 selectivity than Pt. Furthermore, our joint theory–experiment study shows that anisotropic surface manipulation can utilize the hydride mediated reaction pathway for the catalytic reactions that are difficult on regular Pt surfaces."
1,Theoretical and experimental details,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW 55,000), L-ascorbic acid (AA), potassium bromide (KBr), disodium tetrachloropalladate (Na2PdCl4), citric acid (CA), potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K2PtCl4), sodium hexachloroplatinate hexahydrate (Na2PtCl6·6H2O), and ethylene glycol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used to synthesize the nanocrystals. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ•cm), ethanol (C2H6O, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), and phosphoric acid (85 wt% in H2O, 99.99%) were used as reaction medium from Sigma Aldrich. Potassium iodide (KI, Samchun Chemicals, 0.1 N), sulfuric acid concentrate (H2SO4, 0.2 N, Sigma Aldrich), sodium thiosulfate solution (Na2S2O3, 0.1 N, Merck), starch indicator solution (1% w/v, Alfa Aesar), and ammonium molybdate ((NH4)2MoO4, 99.98%, Merck) were purchased to measure the concentration of H2O2 after reaction tests by iodometric titration."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis PVP (36.93 mg), AA (50 mg), and KBr (300 mg) were dissolved in 8 mL of deionized (DI) water and heated at 80 ℃ for 20 min with the magnetic stirring (800 rpm). A 3 mL aqueous solution containing 57 mg of Na2PdCl4 was slowly added and heated at the same temperature for 3 h. The product (Pd NCs) was washed three times with a mixture solution of deionized water and acetone and was redispersed in 8 mL of DI water for a further step. For the synthesis of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanoparticles, 1 mL of the Pd NCs suspension was mixed with 6 mL deionized water, and 1 mL of aqueous K2PtCl4 solution was added into the solution with several Pt precursor concentrations (0.80 mg/mL for Pd@Pt0.04, 12.06 mg/mL for Pd@Pt0.3, and 24.12 mg/mL for Pd@Pt1). After heating to 95 °C, 3 mL of CA (10 mg/mL) solution was injected and the final solution was heated at the same temperature for 3 h. The products were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with a mixture solution of DI water and acetone. To obtain Pt NCs, 40 mg of PVP and 95.9 mg of KBr were dissolved in 9 mL ethylene glycol and heated to 198 ℃ for 20 min. And then, 2 mL ethylene glycol solution including 27.85 mg of Na2PtCl6·6H2O was injected to the reacting solution. After 20 min, the products were separated and washed by acetone and dispersed in DI water."
4,Density functional theory calculations,"2.3 Density functional theory calculations All the calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)[36] with the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE)[37] functional as the exchange and correlation functional with Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction.[38] The projector-augmented-wave method was adopted to describe the potential from the ionic core.[39] An energy cutoff of 480 eV was used. Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling with k-point spacing less than 0.03 Å was used for all systems. A large vacuum spacing, >15 Å, was used to prevent inter–slab interactions. For slab geometries, every layer excluding the bottom two layers, and the reactant molecules were fully relaxed until the maximum Hellmann–Feynman forces were less than 0.02 eV Å−1. For the transition state (TS) calculations, the TS for each reaction was found using the climbing–image nudged elastic band (CI–NEB) method.[40]"
5,Catalyst performance measurements,"2.4 Catalyst performance measurements Direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 was performed in a double-jacketed glass reactor with a reaction medium of 150 mL DI water containing 3.0 × 10-2 M phosphoric acid and 20 vol% of ethyl alcohol. The total volumetric flow rate of the reactant gas was 22 mL/min and volume ratio of H2:O2 is 1:10. The gas reactants fed to the reactor before the reaction (for saturation) and during the reaction (continuous semi-batch reaction). After the saturation, 0.2 mg of catalysts were added into the reactor in the slurry phase (herein colloidal phase). Because of the safety issue of H2 and O2 explosion, directly contact between dry powder and gas should be avoided. The reaction took place under ambient conditions (283 K, 1 atm) for 30 min up to 4 h. After the reaction, the H2O2 concentration was measured by iodometric titration. The H2 conversion was calculated using the H2 concentration data measured by an on-line connected gas chromatography (Carboxen 1000 packed column, SUPELCO). H2 conversion, H2O2 selectivity, and H2O2 production rate were defined as below equations. The production rate of H2O2 (mmol/g-metal•h) is defined as the amount of produced H2O2 (mmol) per gram of metal (g-metal) per hour (h).

6,Temperature programmed reduction,"2.5 Temperature programmed reduction Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was performed with an Autochem II 2920 instrument (Micromeritics, USA). One hundred milligrams of Pd@Pt0.04, Pd@Pt0.3, Pd@Pt1, Pd cube, and Pt cube was used. Before H2-TPR, the catalysts were thermally treated at 383 K under a pure Ar atmosphere (50 mL/min) for 1 h and then cooled to 273 K. After changing the valve to 10% H2/Ar gas, H2-TPR analysis was started from 273 K to 573 K at a ramping rate of 5 K/min using H2/Ar gas (10% volume of H2, 50 mL/min)."
7,Transmission electron microscopy,"2.6 Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps were acquired with an FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV equipped with a Bruker Super-X EDS system. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging and in situ gas experiments were conducted with an FEI Titan 80–300 microscope operating at 300 kV. Lastly, the Protochips Atmosphere system was employed for the in-situ gas experiment, which enabled the observation of samples at gas pressures up to 760 Torr inside a TEM. A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Pd@Pt0.3 nanocrystals under hydrogen atmosphere was taken 10 min after exchanging the air with pure hydrogen gas with a pressure of 500 Torr to ensure hydride formation of Pd@Pt0.3 nanocrystals which was enclosed by high-index Pt facets."
8,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,2.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement were performed with an AXIS-NOVA from Kratos Inc. by using the monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV). Samples were prepared by drying a nanoparticle contained colloidal suspension on silicon wafer under room temperature with vacuum to maintain their original states. The energy reference was calibrated with respect to the binding energy of the internal carbon spectral line (284.6 eV).
9,Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy,"2.8 Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) was performed by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) instrument from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Nicolet iS 50) and in-situ reaction cell from PIKE Technologies (DiffusIRTM). After using 8 mol.% CO/N2 gas for CO adsorption, the cell was purged by pure N2 for 30 min which is followed by spectra record by the FT-IR instrument at 298.15 K with a resolution of 4 cm−1."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Synthesis and growth mechanism of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals,"3.1 Synthesis and growth mechanism of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals To fabricate the anisotropic growth of nanocrystals, we first synthesized Pd NCs with diameters of ~ 13 nm and then grew Pt on the NCs. Fig. 1 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals with different amounts of Pt, and the samples are denominated as Pd@Pt0.04, Pd@Pt0.3, and Pd@Pt1 based on the Pt/Pd mole ratio analyzed from the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results (Table S1). EDS mapping images of the nanocrystals show that cubic shape of red Pd is well maintained, and cyan Pt atoms surround the Pd NCs. Notably, as shown in Fig. 1 b, Pt atoms preferentially grow on the corner of the Pd NCs, which leads to the evolution of concave surfaces and then anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals. According to the high-resolution STEM (HR-STEM) image of the concave Pd@Pt0.04 nanocrystal (Fig. 1 c), the angle between the (100) facets of the Pd NC and the newly grown Pt facets is 26.6°, which is in agreement with (210) facets. As the loading of the Pt increases, the surfaces of the synthesized Pd@Pt nanocrystals become rougher and the thickness of the Pt layers also increases (Fig. 1 e and h). In addition, a meticulous investigation of the HR-STEM images reveals that a few atomic layers of Pt (indistinct gray atoms between high-index facets) are grown near the concave Pt facets in Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 (Fig. 1 f and i), which implies that the Pd NCs are fully covered by the Pt layers. In terms of the theoretical number of Pt shells grew on the Pd NC, the average number of atomic layers deduced from the molar ratio of Pd and Pt and assuming a uniform distribution of the Pt layer is 1, 7, 16 for Pd@Pt0.04, Pd@Pt0.3, and Pd@Pt1, respectively. From the HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 1 c, 1f, and 1i), 2-D projected images show the observed numbers of Pt layers are in the range of 3–8, 5–12, and 5–22 for Pd@Pt0.04, Pd@Pt0.3, and Pd@Pt1, respectively. Comparing each number of the layers between the theoretical- and real-value, following surface structures can be demonstrated: Pd@Pt0.04 exposes Pd sites with concave Pt facets while Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 are covered by Pt facets by both thick layers and thin layers that the thickness go as low as three Pt layers (V-shaped area in Fig. 1 f and i). According to the aforementioned objective of the Pd-Pt bimetallic system, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis was implemented to investigate the negligible strain effect over Pt layers (major active sites on the surfaces). In Figure S1 , the EXAFS spectra show that the Pt layers on the Pd@Pt nanocrystals indeed have a very low strain of less than 1% compared to the pure Pt NCs and Pt foil, which is good agreement to the similar d-spacings of Pd and Pt lattices. It also can be expected that a few electron transfer from core Pd to adjacent Pt atoms certainly occurs, which facilitates O-O bond dissociation through electron back-donation and then causes low H2O2 selectivity.[41] However, we concluded this was not a predominant factor for determining the catalytic activity of the Pd-Pt nanocrystals by using DFT calculation below. Prior to the activity tests, the origin of the high-index facets will be demonstrated. To gain insight into the anisotropic growth mechanism, we performed DFT calculations with a Pd/Pt slab structure to model the Pd@Pt core@shell structure, where we considered 6 layers Pd to mimic the core part and increased the number of Pt shell layers from 1 to 4 (Fig. 2 a and S2). To investigate the preferred facet when the Pt shell grows on the Pd core, we compared the (100), (110), (111), and (210) facets for the slab structures, where the (210) facet was considered as the high-index facet generated during the anisotropic growth of the Pt shell, which was indeed experimentally observed in Fig. 1. Then, we defined the “core–shell formation energy (FCS )” of each slab model as follows: (1) F CS = E tot P d @ P t s l a b - E tot P d b u l k - E tot P t b u l k - F P d - F P t where Etot is the total energy of the given system and F[M] is the surface energy of the slab model of the given metal M defined as: F M = E tot M s l a b - E tot M b u l k 2 ( 2 ) By definition, a negative FCS means that two different metals prefer to form a core@shell structure rather existing in separate bulk phases. In Fig. 2, compared with other facets, the (210) facet has the lowest FCS irrespective of the number of Pt layers, which indicates that when Pt layers grow on Pd layers, the (210) facet is preferred to be formed. For low-index facets, the FCS for one Pt layer shows the trend of (111) < (100) ≈ (110), implying a higher preference for the (111) facet than (100) or (110). As the number of Pt layers increases, the higher preference for the (111) facet is basically maintained, although the (110) facet shows a slightly lower FCS than (111) for two Pt layers. From three Pt layers, it follows the trend of (111) < (110) < (100). Based on these results, we present a schematic diagram of the anisotropic growth mechanism of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals in Fig. 3 . Assuming that the Pd NC is exposed with low-index facets, (100) for terrace, (110) for edge, and (111) for corner, as previously reported in several experiments.[42,43] First, Pt preferentially grows on the corner (111) facets. When the number of Pt layers approaches two, they can start to grow on the (110) facet. As the Pt layers further increase, the Pd@Pt nanocrystals have the highest preference for (111), followed by (110) and (100). The difference in preference of growth facets leads to different growth rates of the facets, which eventually induces anisotropic growth of Pt. During the anisotropic growth, high-index surfaces such as (210) are generated in the vicinity of the inter-regions between the low-index facets, providing concave surfaces on the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, as shown in Fig. 1 c. As the FCS of (210) is lower than that of the low-index facets, the Pt layer now rapidly grows in the high-index directions, while it is saturated within a few atomic layers in the low-index directions, which leads to the rough surface of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, as observed in the Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 samples (Fig. 1 e and h)."
12,Catalytic performance of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanoscrystals for H2O2 synthesis,"3.2 Catalytic performance of anisotropic Pd@Pt nanoscrystals for H2O2 synthesis As shown in Fig. 4 a, the Pd@Pt0.04 not only shows the highest H2O2 productivity (1994 mmolH2O2/gcat·hr) among the Pd@Pt samples, but the productivity is also even higher than that of the Pd and Pt NCs (1041 and 503 mmolH2O2/gcat·hr, respectively). It is well-known that the catalytic performances depends on the size of particles, especially over DSHP reaction.[43–46] The average diameters of the Pd NCs and Pd@Pt nanocrystals (13 ~ 16 nm) are larger than that of the Pt NCs (~7 nm). In addition, the atomic weight of Pt is near twice as Pd, thus a reasonable comparison is necessary that doesn’t depend on the weight of the catalyst but depend on the number of active sites. Generally, the TOF of the catalyst is calculated by using the exact number of exposed active sites obtained from chemisorption analysis such as CO pulse chemisorption. However, PVP molecules surrounding the nanocrystals strongly hinder the mass transfer of CO, resulting in incorrect information. Thus, we evaluated the turnover frequency (TOF) of H2O2 production and H2 conversion for each nanocatalyst using the calculated number of active sites in regard of the size of the nanoparticles ( Figure S3 ), as shown in Fig. 4 b. The details on the TOF evaluation are described in the SI. In terms of the H2O2 production TOF, Pd@Pt0.04 achieves the outstanding value. The H2O2 production TOF of Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 are comparable to that of Pd NCs and higher than that of Pt NCs, despite both having lower H2O2 productivity per weight of the catalyst than the Pd NCs. In addition, a long-term stability test also demonstrates that the Pd@Pt0.04 catalyst still shows a superior H2O2 production to pure Pd even after 4 h ( Figure S5 ). This clearly shows that the anisotropic growth of Pd@Pt nanocrystals can promote H2O2 production in comparison with conventional catalyst. In detail, two interesting results from the test; the highest H2O2 productivity of Pd@Pt0.04 based on both high H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity, and higher H2O2 selectivity and H2 conversions of Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 compared to Pt NCs, will be mainly investigated in this study. First, to address the higher H2O2 selectivity of the Pd@Pt nano-concaves than that of the Pt NC, we performed DFT simulations for the O2 dissociation reaction on (100) and (210) surfaces of Pt (Table S2). O2 undergoes a barrier-less dissociative adsorption on the Pt(100) surface which is in good agreement with a previous report.[47] In contrast, the O2 dissociation reaction on the Pt(210) surface has a barrier of 0.1 eV, which still small but higher than on the Pt(100) surface, explaining the higher H2O2 selectivity for the Pd@Pt nano-concaves than the Pt NC. For Pd@Pt0.04, although most of the surface of Pd@Pt0.04 seems to be enclosed by Pt facets in Fig. 1 b, Pd@Pt0.04 exhibited the highest H2O2 selectivity with twice as high as H2 conversion compared to Pd NCs. From our previous reports, it was found that small amount of Pt dopant in Pd withdrew electrons from Pd, resulting in electron deficient Pd species which are more favorable for selective H2O2 synthesis compared to pure Pd species.[29,48] Hence, it can be assumed from the catalytic activity that broad terrace region predominantly exposes Pt doped Pd sites adjacent to the concave Pt facets at the corners. In Figure S7, XPS spectra of Pd 3d and Pt 4f regions support the assumption. As the content of Pt increased, electronic states of Pd shift to high binding energies, meaning that Pd atoms lose their electron to neighboring Pt atoms. Correspondingly, small amounts of Pt content (Pd@Pt0.04) showed peak at lower binding energy than larger contents of Pt contents, which indicates more electrons were withdrawn from neighboring Pd atoms per Pt atoms. Additionally, DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption was obtained to investigate the surface atomic structures. In Figure S8, two distinct peaks are observed, where the left peak (in the range of 2050–2075 cm−1) corresponds to CO adsorption on less coordinated metal sites (e.g., linear adsorption on edge or corner) and the right peak (in the range of 1900–1950 cm−1) corresponds to more coordinated metal sites (e.g., bridge or three-fold hollow).[49,50] In the case of less coordinated adsorption of CO, intensities of peak gradually increase and positions of the peak gradually shift to higher wave number. The former indicates larger amount of less-coordinated sites on the catalyst surface, which is in good agreement with the formation of high-index facets as demonstrated by HAADF-STEM images and DFT calculations. Moreover, gradual blue shift of CO adsorption peak is likely to be attributed from the electronic state of the Pt which gained less electrons from Pd.[51] As the thickness of Pt layer increases, charge transfer to outmost Pt surface from inner Pd core becomes weak, leading to the weaker bonding strength (peak position at higher wave number). Contrary to the linear bond of CO, bridge or three-fold hollow adsorption of CO gradually decreases as the Pt content increases. Especially, Pd@Pt0.04 shows strong peak intensity at low wave number region, indicating that Pd@Pt0.04 still exposes more coordinated terrace plane (100) Pd sites as assumed above. Considering both analysis results, it can be notably demonstrated that the amount of high-index facets evidently increases over Pd@Pt nano-concaves, and Pd@Pt0.04 has electron-deficient Pd species on the surface, which prefers H2O2 synthesis than the side reaction. In addition to this explanation, hydride formation over high-index faceted nanoparticles can be another reason for the higher H2O2 selectivity of ‘Pd@Pt0.04 compared to Pd cubes’ and of ‘Pd@Pt0.3-1 compared to Pt cubes’, which will be addressed in section 3.3. Only with the selectivity, it is difficult to understand the highest productivity of the Pd@Pt0.04 nanocrystal, which requires a deep understanding of the H2 conversion properties. Similar to the H2O2 productivity, we also evaluated the H2 conversion TOFs for Pd@Pt, Pd NCs, and Pt NCs, as shown in Fig. 4 b. The H2 conversion TOF of Pt NCs is higher than that of Pd NCs, which is consistent with the previous reports.[52–56] Interestingly, all of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals shows higher H2 conversion TOFs (15 ~ 17 s−1) than the Pt NCs (10 s−1). According to our DFT calculation on H2 dissociation on Pt(100) and Pt(210) surfaces, the dissociation behavior is thermodynamically more favorable by 0.6 eV on the (100) surface than on the (210) surface. Because the surfaces of the Pd@Pt0.3 and Pd@Pt1 nanocrystals are fully covered with Pt surfaces, mostly (210) and (100), while the Pt nanocube has mostly exposed with (100) surfaces, it is difficult to determine why the Pd@Pt nanocrystals have a H2 conversion TOF up to 70% higher than the Pt NCs. Moreover, even the Pd@Pt0.04 nanocrystals partially expose Pd sites, which have poorer H2 dissociation behavior than Pt. We rule out strain and charge transfer effects by DFT calculations: The difference in O2 dissociation barrier and reaction enthalpy on Pd@Pt (001) slabs (with 1% compression on the Pt layer compared to pristine Pt) are less than 0.02 eV compared to pristine Pt (100) slabs (Table S2), indicating an existence of another crucial factor that governs the catalytic activities. These points motivate us to find the answer, and it is expected that the answer can be the key to understanding the enhanced H2O2 productivity observed in the anisotropically grown Pd@Pt nanocrystals."
13,H2O2 synthesis mechanism on anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals,"3.3 H2O2 synthesis mechanism on anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals Recently, Selinsek et al.[23] reported with operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy that hydrogen dissolved in a Pd lattice can readily react with O2 chemisorbed over the Pd surface and lead to H2O2 formation. This result provides us with an inspiration to unravel the reason that the Pd@Pt nanocrystals have higher H2 conversion than the Pt cubes. In other words, it can be inferred that the enhanced H2 conversion of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals results from a combination of the hydrogen dissociation over the Pt surfaces and the hydrogen storage ability of Pd core, which is schematically represented in Figure S4 . To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis for the Pd@Pt nanocrystals and then compared them with the Pd and Pt NCs (Fig. 5 a), and the details on the H2-TPR analysis are explained in the Methods section. The Pd NCs show a H2 desorption peak at approximately 50 ~ 100 °C, which is known to correspond to H2 desorption during the decomposition of bulk Pd hydride phase (PdHx).[57,58] In all the three Pd@Pt nanocrystals, peaks at approximately 50 ~ 75 °C are observed, which may indicate that the PdHx can be formed even in the Pd@Pt. Moreover, the Pd@Pt samples show another peak at a higher temperature around 100 °C. Considering the H2-TPR profile of the Pt NCs, the peak at higher temperature is likely the H2 evolution peak originated from hydrogen adsorbed over the Pt shell surfaces. However, the peaks at low temperature over Pd@Pt0.03 and Pd@Pt1 have to be determined directly since Pt layers enclosing the Pd NCs are unfavorable for dissolving hydrogen. Thus, to visually support the real formation of PdHx in the Pd@Pt nanocrystals, we investigated the lattice expansion of the Pd@Pt0.3 sample by an in situ TEM apparatus while injecting gases (e.g., air and H2) into the sample (Fig. 5 b). The interplanar distances of the Pd@Pt0.3 nanocrystals increase by up to 3% under a hydrogen atmosphere of 500 Torr relative to the case in which the particles are exposed to air. These expanded d-spacing values well correspond to those of face-centered cubic PdH0.58.[59] As a result, it is found that hydrogen atoms can be dissolved into the core Pd to form hydride phase even the core is surrounded by several Pt layers which is unfavorable for hydride formation. A recent DFT study revealed an evident advantage of Pd hydride phase for DSHP reaction,[60] demonstrating that the palladium hydride phase can act as a powerful active site for the selective synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. From their results, a high-index facet of Pd hydride, namely the (211) facet adjacent between (111) and (100), appears to be the most favorable surface for selective H2O2 synthesis. Over the hydride Pd (211) facet, not only the reaction barriers toward H2O2 synthesis, but also the relative reaction barriers of H2O2 synthesis vs. side reactions are lowered, implying that hydride high-index facets can improve both production rate and selectivity. This could also be the case for Pt hydride high-index facets, which is subject to further investigation. According to the hydride mediated H2O2 synthesis mechanism, we can assume that the bulk Pd hydrides in the Pd@Pt nanocrystals can readily facilitate the H2O2 synthesis which were shown as high H2O2 production TOF and H2 conversion TOF. Despite such systematic characterizations (H2-TPR and in situ TEM), another issue remains to be addressed in our mechanism: how hydrogen penetration through Pt layers is available in spite of a very low hydrogen solubility of the bulk Pt lattice.[61] To further support the experiments, we investigated the reaction pathways for hydrogen penetration of the surface of the Pd@Pt slabs into the bulk lattice by DFT calculations (Fig. 5 c and d), in which the reaction pathways were represented based on the binding energies of a hydrogen atom at each state. The surface effect on the hydrogen penetration behavior was explored by considering the (100) and (210) surfaces for the Pd@Pt slabs. In the DFT calculations, the Pd layers in the Pd@Pt slab models were aligned along the 〈100〉 direction irrespective of the type of Pt surfaces used to more realistically reproduce the synthesized Pd@Pt nanocrystals (see Fig. 1). The Pd(100) shows a low energy barrier for hydrogen penetration of the surface (A in Fig. 5 c) into the subsurface (B) (0.28 eV), and the energy change in hydrogen between the surface state (A) and the bulk interior (H) is marginal, revealing the possibility that hydrogen can be dissolved in the bulk lattice. However, both of the Pd@Pt(100) and Pt(100) slabs show much higher energy barriers for hydrogen penetration (Pd@Pt(100): 1.06 eV, Pt(100): 0.94 eV) than Pd, and both of them show thermodynamically unfavorable reactions, i.e., by 0.60 eV for Pd@Pt(100) and 1.13 eV for Pt(100). This result clearly indicates that it is unlikely for the surface activated hydrogen atom to migrate into the bulk lattices through the low-index facets of Pt, such as (100), even for very thin Pt layers. Remarkably, one can find a very different phenomenon for the anisotropic Pd@Pt model with the (210) high-index surface. In the model, the energy difference between the surface state (A) and the state dissolved in the lattice (H) is almost zero. Although we neglected transition state calculations to find the energy barriers for the Pd@Pt(210) model because of a computation limit (system size of 165 atoms), we can reasonably infer that hydrogen penetration of the Pt(210) surface is likely easier than that of Pt(100) because the (210) surface has a wider entrance (less closely packed structure) than the (100), as shown in Figure S6 . Noticeably, the overall diffusion pathway for Pd(100) is still energetically preferential compared to Pd@Pt(210) and H2-TPR profile of Pd@Pt0.04 shows the largest peak area for H2 desorption, which explains that Pd@Pt0.04 including both Pd(100) and high-index Pt facets is multi-faceted to utilize large amounts of hydrogen to produce H2O2. In detail, the former mainly plays role for active sites and hydrogen absorption, and the latter mainly activates and spillover the hydrogen into the bulk Pd. As a result, Pd@Pt0.04 obtained the best catalytic performance. From the combination of the experimental and theoretical results explained so far, the high-index facets of the Pd@Pt nanocrystals induced by anisotropic growth of Pt on Pd NCs indeed promote catalytic reactions not only by exposing a large number of highly active sites but also by providing another reaction pathway that is inoperative on the low-index Pt surfaces. Additionally, it also notable to be suggested that a mechanism mediated by palladium hydride phase is energetically preferential for such hydrogenation reactions, which can be a powerful way to improve catalytic activities."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of anisotropic Pd@Pt core@shell nanostructures enclosed by high-index facets such as (210) by using a simple route based on reduction in an aqueous solution. Using DFT calculation, the anisotropic growth mechanism has been thoroughly investigated with the core–shell formation energies defined in this work. In addition, the anisotropic growth of Pt layers on Pd nanocubes (NCs) greatly promotes H2O2 direct synthesis in comparison to that with Pd or Pt NCs, and the H2O2 selectivity of the Pd@Pt nanostructure is higher than that of Pd. And, it is very interesting that TOFs for H2 conversion of Pd@Pt are higher than that of Pt NCs. It was revealed that the evolution of the high-index facets in the anisotropic Pd@Pt nanocrystals enabled a utilization of H2 by hydrogen dissolution into the Pd lattices as well as employed hydride phase mediated reaction pathways, and the latter effect does not operate on the low-index facets. Thus far, to improve the catalytic performance of core@shell nanocrystals, the strain and charge-transfer effects between the core and shell materials have been mostly considered.[62–65] In this regard, this work provides another option to improve the catalytic properties of core@shell nanocrystals via an anisotropic growth. In addition, a worthy approach for unveiling synthesis mechanism of nanocrystals was explored by DFT calculations, providing an insight into deposition behaviors and surface properties. We confidently expect that our results could be extended to other catalytic reactions."
