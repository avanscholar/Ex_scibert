0,Introduction,"Due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and depleted fossil fuels worldwide, renewable bio-alcohols are of interest to relieve the dependence on conventional petroleum fuels [1]. In recent decades global crude oil prices have been fluctuating, affected by environmental, economical, and geopolitical factors. More stringent fuel economy regulations and emission regulations of automobiles have also been made. Driven by current energy and environmental issues, the USA, Europe, and China are pursuing green energy directives. Alcohols can be used as an additive to gasoline or diesel fuels. Owing to the hydroxyl (OH) group in the molecule, the oxidation of the substituted fossil fuels can be more efficient and clean, and less soot is formed. For the shorter-chain (C1C2) alcohols, methanol is the simplest alcohol, and it can realize near-zero soot combustion since it has no carbon-carbon bonds. However, the extensive use of methanol is limited by safety concerns. Nowadays, ethanol is the most prominent alcohol used as additive to gasoline. It was reported in 2011 that the ethanol production of USA (13.9 billon gallon) and Brazil (5.6 billon gallon) accounted for more than 87% of the ethanol production in the world. Both methanol and ethanol can be used as anti-knocking additives to gasoline instead of methyl tertiary butyl ether, which has been discarded. However, the shorter-chain alcohols are miscible with water and are easy to vaporize, and their miscibility with gasoline or diesel, and their viscosity, and lower heating values are lower compared with longer-chain (C3C5) alcohols, as seen in Table 1 [2,3]. As revealed by Lapuerta et al. [2], when blended with diesel, longer-chain alcohols are more preferable over shorter-chain alcohols, considering their lubricity, viscosity, surface stability, and energy density. With the development of massive production techniques using non-food materials as feedstock for longer-chain alcohols [4–6], longer-chain alcohols are promising future fuels for the transportation sector. For practical applications, C1C5 alcohols can be used directly at low fractions in both spark ignition (SI) engines and compression ignition (CI) engines without modifications. In SI engines gasoline/alcohol blends are frequently used [7], while in CI engines alcohols can be used by direct diesel/alcohol blending, emulsion, fumigation, or double injection methods [8–11]. Methanol, ethanol, and the butanols (n-butanol, s-butanol, i-butanol, and t-butanol) have been investigated extensively [5,7,8]. However, investigations related to the propanols (n-propanol and i-propanol) are rare and have been mainly restricted to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion and SI engines [12,13]. For n-pentanol, due to its preferable physical and chemical qualities, it can be used as an additive to diesel, or together with biodiesel, and recently, n-pentanol/diesel blends were investigated in CI engines with fractions of up to 25% [8]. This investigation indicated that, without further modifications to the engine, the addition of n-pentanol to diesel can improve brake thermal efficiency, however, a slight decrease of power output was also observed. Li et al. [14] reported experiments on a single-cylinder engine and found that n-pentanol reduced the NOx and soot emissions while still maintaining similar brake thermal efficiencies compared to diesel. Wei et al. [15] also pointed out that the addition of n-pentanol to diesel reduced soot emission in CI engines. Gautam et al. [3] conducted an experimental investigation to explore the combustion characteristics of longer-chain normal alcohols (n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol)/gasoline blends on a single-cylinder SI engine. The research revealed that faster flame speeds and higher knock resistance was obtained with longer-chain alcohols. Gravalos et al. [16] also conducted an experimental investigation to explore the emission characteristics of pure and high alcohol blended gasoline fuels on a single-cylinder SI engine. They revealed that blended alcohol/gasoline fuels tended to achieve lower hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon oxide (CO) emissions compared with gasoline. However, no comparisons among the combustion characteristics of C1C5 alcohols or their blends with gasoline or diesel have been performed. Therefore, more experimental and modeling investigations to compare the combustion characteristics of the C1C5 alcohols and their blends with gasoline and diesel fuels in internal combustion engines (ICEs), especially in CI engines, are still needed. Diesel and gasoline are composed of complex multi-components, including alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics [17,18]. However, it is not practical to include all the individual components to describe the fuel combustion chemistry of diesel and gasoline. Due to the similar combustion characteristics, typically n-heptane and iso-octane (PRF fuels) or their blends are used to model the combustion chemistry of diesel and gasoline. PRF combustion chemistry has been investigated extensively in both experimental and modeling studies [19]. The combustion chemistry of hydrogen (H2), CO, and methanol (CH3OH) is very important and serves as the basis for constructing oxidation mechanisms of large hydrocarbons and alcohols. Metcalfe et al. [20] developed a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism (AramcoMech 1.3) for the combustion of small hydrocarbon species and oxygenated species, including H2, CO, methane (CH4), CH3OH, formaldehyde (CH2O), ethane (C2H6), ethanol (C2H5OH), and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). This mechanism has been extensively validated against experimental ignition delays, species mole fraction profiles, and laminar flame speeds. In recent years, with the development of more advanced computational and diagnostic technique, the combustion chemistry of longer-chain alcohols have been investigated, and combustion kinetic models of n-propanol [21–24], i-propanol [21–23,25], butanols [26–30], and n-pentanol [31–33] have been proposed. For practical applications combustion kinetic mechanisms have been coupled with three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software to investigate fuel combustion and emission characteristics on SI and CI engines for combustion optimization and emission reduction strategies. However, detailed combustion kinetic mechanism typically consist of hundreds and thousands of species and reactions, respectively, and direct coupling of a CFD code with detailed mechanisms requires computational resources beyond current capabilities. Thus, reduced kinetic mechanisms by using different reduction methods have been proposed [34–36] to reduce computation cost. In this work a reduced PRF-alcohols (methanol/ethanol/propanols/butanols/n-pentanol) combustion kinetic mechanism is proposed. First, reduced combustion kinetic mechanisms of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol were constructed. Further optimizations to the mechanism were also conducted by adopting the methodology proposed by Ra and Reitz [37,38]. The formulated reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism was validated against ignition delays, laminar flame speeds, and species mole fraction profiles from literature measurements. New HCCI combustion experiments were performed and collected, and the experimental combustion characteristics were used to validate the proposed reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. In addition, 3-D engine modeling studies were conducted to investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of the C1C5 alcohol blends with diesel in the direct injection (DI) CI combustion. 0-D modeling studies were also performed to further elucidate the differences of the soot tendency for the pure alcohols and their blends with n-heptane."
1,Mechanism development,"In our previous study [39] a reduced PRF-butanols (n-butanol, s-butanol, i-butanol, and t-butanol) combustion kinetic mechanism was developed, including 108 species and 435 reactions for engine applications, by using a hierarchical structure with the core H2 CO and C1C2 sub-mechanisms from AramcoMech 1.3 [20], the butanols sub-mechanism from Sarathy et al. [29], and the PRF sub-mechanism from Mehl et al. [19]. In this work, the reduced PRF-butanols mechanism was used as the basis for the development of the reduced PRF-alcohols (methanol/ethanol/propanols/butanols/n-pentanol) mechanism. The methanol and ethanol sub-mechanisms are already included in the core H2 CO and C1C2 sub-mechanisms, and have been extensively validated against experimental results [20,39]. The reduced n-propanol and i-propanol sub-mechanisms were derived from the detailed mechanism developed by Man et al. [23], and the reduced n-pentanol sub-mechanism was derived from the detailed mechanism developed by Heufer et al. [32]. Both detailed mechanisms have been extensively validated against experimental ignition delays [23,40], species mole fraction profiles [24,25,31] and laminar flame speeds [24,25,31]. In the mechanism reduction and validation sections, the SENKIN code of the CHEMKIN package [41] was used to simulate the ignition delays and conduct the rate of production (ROP) analysis and sensitivity analysis of ignition delay. The ignition delay was defined as the time interval when the 400 K temperature rise was achieved. The PREMIX code was used to simulate the laminar flame speeds and conduct the sensitivity analysis of laminar flame speed. The AURORA code was used to simulate species mole fraction profiles in the jet stirred reactor (JSR). For the mechanism reduction automatic and manual reduction methods were adopted. First, the detailed n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol mechanisms were reduced by using the Directed Relation Graph with Error Propagation (DRGEP) method [34,35], which has been adopted in many other investigations [42,43]. Briefly, this method eliminates the decoupled species and irrelevant reactions within a specified error [34,35]. In the DRGEP reduction process representative operating conditions were considered, covering equivalence ratios (ϕ) of 0.25–4.0, temperatures of 700–1600 K, and pressures of 1–80 atm. Different error values were tested so that the detailed mechanisms were reduced to a compact size which could still predict the ignition delays well. After the automatic reduction the reduced n-propanol mechanism composed of 57 species and 267 reactions, i-propanol mechanism composed of 55 species and 249 reactions, n-pentanol mechanism composed of 161 species and 622 reactions were obtained. Comparisons of the ignition delays simulated by the reduced mechanisms and the corresponding detailed mechanisms for n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol are shown in Fig. 1 . As seen in the figure, the reduced mechanisms had the quite similar predictive performance with the corresponding detailed mechanisms, which means that the main combustion characteristics of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol were well retained after the automatic reduction process. Then the manual reduction methods of ROP analysis, and sensitivity analyses of ignition delay, and laminar flame speed were adopted to further downsize the obtained reduced mechanisms of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol. The ROP analysis was used to identify the insignificant species and reactions, which were considered removable. However, the sensitivity analyses of ignition delay and laminar flame speed were used to identify the significant reactions that were important for the prediction of ignition delay and laminar flame speed, and these reactions were remained. It should be noted that the manual reduction process only analyzed the longer carbon species (longer than C2 species), given that the C0C2 sub-mechanism has been well retained in the base PRF mechanism. The manual reduction method can be well explained by Figs. 2–4 . In the figures, the ROP was calculated on the whole time range (1s), with the positive value representing the consumption fraction of the considered species. The sensitivity coefficient of ignition delay was defined as (1) S = τ 2.0 τ 1.0 − 1 where S, sensitivity coefficient. τ 2.0, ignition delay with the reaction rate constant multiplied by 2 τ 1.0, the original ignition delay The positive value of S indicates that the reaction reduces the ignition delay. The first order sensitivity coefficient of the mass flow rate to the A-factor of each rate constant was calculated by the PREMIX code, with the positive value indicating that the reaction increases the laminar flame speed [44]. It can be observed in Fig. 2 that n-propanol was mainly consumed by the H-abstraction reactions by H, hydroxyl (OH), and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals, and the direct decomposition reactions to form ethyl radical (C2H5) and methyl radical (CH3). Thus, the reactions R1-R9 should be taken as the important reactions in the consumption of n-propanol and should be retained. Figs. 3 and 4 show the most sensitive reactions to the ignition delays and laminar flame speed. By compared with Fig. 2, it can be observed that there are some reactions (R13, R21, R22, and R23) that should be removed according to Fig. 2 but should be retained according to Figs. 3 and 4. These reactions were retained to better predict the ignition delay and laminar flame speed. Notably, after every elimination of the unimportant species and reactions, the reduced mechanism was validated against the predicted ignition delays, species mole fraction profiles, and laminar flame speeds of the base mechanism to ensure its predictive performance. By using this method, the unimportant species and reactions were identified and the reduced n-propanol mechanism was more downsized. The manual reduction process for the reduced i-propanol mechanism also followed the upper mentioned method. However, that of the reduced n-pentanol mechanism was different. Given the longer chain chemical structure, the initial H-abstraction of n-pentanol formed six isomers (C5H10OH11, C5H10OH12, C5H10OH13, C5H10OH14, C5H10OH15, and C5H11O), as seen in Fig. 5 . The isomers should be lumped to further downsize the reduced mechanism as did in the reduction of the detailed n-heptane mechanism [38,45,46]. According to the ROP analyses, in the n-pentanol consumption C5H10OH11 is the most important species while C5H11O is the least important species, and the sum of the C5H10OH13 and C5H10OH15 formation were higher than those of C5H10OH12 and C5H10OH14. Besides, the removal of C5H10OH13 and C5H10OH15 could significantly affect the predictive ignition delay especially in the low temperature region. Therefore, C5H10OH11, C5H10OH13, and C5H10OH15 were remained in the reduced n-pentanol mechanism so that the main consumption pathways of n-pentanol were reasonably maintained. After lumping of the C5H11O isomers, the similar manual reduction process as that of n-propanol was adopted. As previously discussed, a hierarchical structure was adopted for the formulation of the combined reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism, taking the core C0C2 sub-mechanism from AramcoMech 1.3 [20] as the basis. Therefore, after the reduction process only the main fuel consumption reactions of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol were retained and combined with the base reduced PRF-butanols mechanism. Finally, the combined reduced mechanism comprised of 161 species and 622 reactions. Given that the reduction process of this work could well retained the main combustion characteristics of the propanols sub-mechanisms, no more adjustment was performed. However, due to the lumping of the C5H11O isomers, the system reactivity of n-pentanol combustion was decreased. To ensure the predictive performance of the reduced n-pentanol sub-mechanism, an optimization process proposed by Ra and Reitz [37,38] was performed, which was implemented via the perturbation of the reaction rate constants based on the sensitivity analysis of ignition delay. Figs. S1 and S2 show the sensitivity analyses of ignition delays for n-pentanol at the initial ϕ = 1.0, temperatures of 800 K and 1300 K, and pressure of 80 atm. At lower temperature (800 K), R56 (NC5H11OH + OH = C5H10OH11 + H2O) exhibited the largest positive sensitivity due to the OH consumption. However, R58 (NC5H11OH + OH = C5H10OH13 + H2O) and R59 (NC5H11OH + OH = C5H10OH15 + H2O) exhibited the largest negative sensitivity, given that these two reactions were important for the low temperature combustion. While at the higher temperature (1300 K), R60 (NC5H11OH + HO2 = C5H10OH11 + H2O2) exhibited the largest negative sensitivity due to the hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. In this work, to enhance the system reactivity of the n-pentanol combustion, reactions R58 and R60 were adjusted. Detailed adjustments to the Arrhenius reaction rate constants of the reduced n-pentanol sub-mechanism is given in Table 2 . The reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism in CHEMKIN format is included in the Supplemental material. The main reaction pathways of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol are depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 . N-propanol and i-propanol are mainly consumed by initial H abstraction reactions by the OH radical, and then by the following dissociation reactions. No obvious low-temperature reactions occur due to the shorter-chain chemical structure [21]. Similar with the propanols at high temperature (1300 K), n-pentanol is also mainly consumed by H abstraction and the following dissociation reactions. However, at low temperature (700 K), the fuel radicals formed by H abstraction from n-pentanol can also be consumed by combination with oxygen (O2), showing the typical low temperature characteristics. By isomerization, enol-keto tautomerization, and the subsequent decomposition reactions, many aldehydes can be formed."
2,Mechanism validations,"In this section experimental results of ignition delays in shock tubes (ST) and rapid compression machines (RCM), laminar flame speeds, and species mole fraction profiles in JSR were used to validate the combined reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism proposed in this work. In addition, for engine application, new HCCI combustion experiments were performed, and the experimental in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates were used for further validations."
3,Ignition delays,"3.1 Ignition delays In our previous works [39,47,48] the reduced PRF, methanol, ethanol, and butanols sub-mechanisms have been extensively validated. To show the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure adopted in this work, and the influence of the addition of the propanols and n-pentanol sub-mechanisms, experimental ignition delays of methanol [49], ethanol [50], and butanols [30] were also used for further validations. As illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9 , in general, the experimental ignition delays of ethanol and the butanols are reasonably well predicted by the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. However, the ignition delays of methanol are over-predicted, especially in the lower temperature region (<900 K), which is attributed to the neglect of heat loss and facility effects for the modeling. It can also be observed that the modeled ignition delays of methanol and ethanol predicted by the detailed AramcoMech 1.3 mechanism and the present reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism are quite similar. The results indicate that the combustion chemistry of methanol, ethanol, and butanols have been well retained in the current reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. Man et al. [23] measured ignition delays of n-propanol and i-propanol in argon diluted O2 in a reflected ST, at ϕ = 0.5–2.0, temperatures of 1100–1500 K, and pressures of 1.2–16 atm. Comparisons between experimental and modeled ignition delays of n-propanol and i-propanol are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 . Overall, for both fuels the experimental ignition delays are well predicted by the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism, especially at higher pressures (>1 atm). However, at a pressure of 1 atm, the ignition delays are generally over-predicted, and errors can be as high as 85%. But, given that the typical operating conditions in engine applications are above 40 atm, the agreement can be regarded as reasonable. Heufer et al. [40] measured ignition delays of n-pentanol in a reflected ST and a RCM at ϕ = 1.0, pressures of 9–30 bar, and temperatures of 640–1200 K. Comparisons between experimental and modeled ignition delays of n-pentanol are shown in Fig. 12 . Generally, the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism predicts the experimental ignition delays of n-pentanol well. However, discrepancies are observed at lower temperatures (<800 K), which are mainly due to the neglects of heat loss and facility effects in the RCM modeling setup for long ignition delay [32]."
4,Laminar flame speed,"3.2 Laminar flame speed The laminar flame speed is another important parameter for the validation of kinetic mechanisms. Comparisons between the experimental [24,25,31,51–53] and modeled laminar flame speeds of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, butanols, and n-pentanol have been performed, as seen in Figs. 13 and 14 . Overall, the experimental laminar flame speeds are well predicted by the present reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. Moreover, as seen in Fig. 13, the present reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism is able to provide better predictions of laminar flame speeds compared to those of the detailed AramcoMech 1.3 mechanism. Therefore, the generally reasonable predictive performance in terms of laminar flame speeds indicates that the shorter-carbon combustion chemistry has been well represented by the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism."
5,JSR species mole fraction profiles,"3.3 JSR species mole fraction profiles Figs. 15–17 and S3–S5 show comparisons between the modeled and experimental species mole fraction profiles in a JSR for n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol at ϕ = 1.0 and ϕ = 0.35, respectively [24,25,31]. Major species such as the fuel molecules, CO, carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and some important intermediate combustion species, including CH4, acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), and propene (C3H6) are considered in the current validations. It can be seen that the fuel consumption and intermediates formation processes are well reproduced by the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. However, there are some discrepancies for the predictions of C2H2, and the errors can be as high as about 2.0–2.5 at higher temperatures, which were also observed with the detailed mechanisms [24,25,31]. Thus, more investigations and refinements of the C2H2 formation pathways in n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol mechanisms should be performed in the future. Overall, the good predictions of experimental ignition delays, laminar flame speeds, and JSR species mole fraction profiles for methanol, ethanol, propanols, butanols, and n-pentanol indicate that the present reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism can provide reliable predictive performance for alcohol oxidation."
6,HCCI combustion,"3.4 HCCI combustion HCCI combustion experiments were conducted on a modified single-cylinder CI engine. The engine specifications are listed in Table 3 . The experimental conditions together with the experimental uncertainties are listed in Table 4 . In the experiment, blends of n-propanol/n-heptane, i-propanol/n-heptane, and n-pentanol/n-heptane (purities >99%) with the same blending ratio 75%/25% (mol.) were injected into the intake-port for each case. To ensure stable combustion the intake temperature was maintained at 373 K and the intake pressure was maintained at 1.55 bar. An air compressor was used to enhance the intake pressure, and a throttle in the exhaust pipe was used to regulate the exhaust back pressure to achieve exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The EGR ratios were swept from 0% to 30%, and ϕ was maintained at 0.3 by varying the injected fuel mass. The in-cylinder pressure was measured with a Kistler piezoelectric pressure transducer and was then averaged for 50 consecutive cycles. The fuel flow rate was measured by a fuel consumption meter (AVL 733S). The EGR was measured by a Horiba emission analyzer. Detailed information about the engine and the related measurement equipment can be found in Refs. [54,55]. The KIVA3V code [56] coupled with the CHEMKIN package was used for the 3D HCCI combustion simulations. The reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism developed in this work was coupled with the KIVA3V code to predict the HCCI combustion processes [57]. The renormalized k-ε model [58] was used to describe the turbulence, and an updated heat transfer model [59] was used to describe heat transfer. For HCCI modeling, the spray [60], atomization [61], and spray-wall interaction modules [62] were deactivated. However, due to the 8-hole structure of the stock in-cylinder high pressure injector, a 45°-sector mesh (9560 grid points) was adopted to improve the computational efficiency, as illustrated in Fig. 18 . The modeling started from intake valve close timing (−133 CA ATDC) and ended at exhaust valve opening timing (125 CA ATDC). The initial gas distribution was assumed to be homogeneous. Fig. 19 shows comparisons between the modeled and experimental in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates for the mixtures. As can be seen, the reactivity of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol in HCCI combustion can be sequenced as n-pentanol > i-propanol > n-propanol. As expected, in all cases the combustion phasing retards with increase of EGR, together with a reduced heat release rate. Generally, the reduced PRF/alcohols mechanism adequately predicts the in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates for all cases. The auto-ignition and combustion processes are deemed to be well reproduced with the current mechanism. However, some of the peak cylinder pressures were slightly over-predicted, and this can be attributed to uncertainties in the heat transfer model or the assumption that the initial gas and temperature distributions were homogeneous."
7,DICI combustion,"In this work DICI experiments fueled with pure diesel were conducted, and the experimental results were served as the basis for the 3-D CFD modeling investigations. In the modeling, to compare the different combustion and emission characteristics of the normal C1C5 alcohols, the alcohols were blended with diesel at the 5% fuel oxygen content (O5 cases). For the O5 cases, the injected fuel mass per cycle was adjusted to make sure that they have the equivalent heat value of diesel. The blending ratios in volume fraction (vol.) for the O5 cases were listed in Table 5 . The experimental conditions were listed in Table 3. The start of injection (SOI) time was fixed at −8 crank angle (CA) ATDC. The engine speed was fixed at 1500 rpm. The intake temperature was fixed at 308 K, the intake pressure was maintained at 1.8 bar, and the EGR ratios were swept from 0% to 52%. The NOx emission was measured with a FTIR emission analyzer, and the soot emission was measured with an AVL 415S smoke meter. The KIVA3V code coupled with CHEMKIN was used for the 3-D CFD modeling studies, with the spray [60], atomization [61], and spray-wall interaction modules [62] activated. The n-heptane sub-mechanism was used to model the diesel combustion chemistry, and the n-tetradecane physical properties was used to model the diesel physical properties. Methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol were modeled with their respective combustion chemistry and physical property. The NOx emission was predicted by the reduced NOx chemistry in the previous work [42]. Given that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the most important precursors of soot, to describe and clarify the soot formation process, the reduced toluene-PAHs sub-mechanism based on our previous work [42] was incorporated with the reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism, and the multi-step phenomenological soot model with A4 (pyrene) as the precursor [63] was used to predict the soot formation and oxidation processes. The modeling mesh grid and the duration time were the same as in the HCCI combustion modeling setup."
8,Modeling validation,"4.1 Modeling validation Given that only the diesel DICI experiments have been conducted, modeling studies fueled with pure diesel were performed firstly to validate against the experimental results. In the modeling, the corresponding experimental control parameters were taken as the inputs. After the validations, the same control parameters were adopted for the O5 cases. Figs. 20 and 21 show the comparisons between the modeled and experimental results. Overall, the experimental in-cylinder pressures, heat release rates, NOx emissions, and soot emissions were well captured. As the EGR ratio was higher, the ignition was postponed and the premixed combustion was enhanced. Due to the lower mean combustion temperature in the cylinder, the NOx emission was lower. However, the soot emission was higher because of the O2 insufficiency."
9,O5 cases,"4.2 O5 cases After the validation, 3-D modeling investigations of the combustion and emission characteristics for the O5 cases were performed. The same control parameters of the pure diesel cases were adopted. Fig. 22 shows the simulated in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates for the O5 cases. It can be observed that the combustion performance of the different alcohol blends showed less discrepancies until at the higher EGR ratios (≥40%). This was attributed to the quite similar C/H/O mass ratio. The propanol blend fuel exhibited the lowest reactivity, thus the ignition was more retarded and the premixed combustion was more severe, despite the fact that the propanol blend had the higher diesel volume fraction compared with the n-butanol and n-pentanol blends. Fig. 23 shows the simulated NOx and soot emissions. It can be observed that the NOx emissions for the different alcohol blend cases were similar. The EGR ratio should be at least 45% to meet the Europe VI emission regulation (≤0.4 g/kWh). While at the higher EGR ratios (≥45%), the soot emissions rose rapidly. However, the soot emissions were still lower than those of the pure diesel cases, indicating the potential more clean combustion of alcohol blends. The soot emissions can be sequenced by methanol > ethanol > n-butanol > n-pentanol > n-propanol. These revealed that in the DICI combustion, the alcohols with the same C/H/O mass ratio but the different carbon chain length could have different combustion and emission characteristics due to the different reactivity. Fig. 24 shows the 3-D contours of temperature, equivalence ratio, and soot distributions at the 52% EGR ratio. The combustion of the methanol and ethanol blends were earlier than those of the n-butanol and n-pentanol blends, while that of the n-propanol blend was the latest. It can be observed that the mixture strength was much leaner with the longer ignition delay, thus the soot emission was lower. However, as seen in Fig. 23, even fueled with the n-propanol blend with higher EGR ratios (≥45%), it failed to meet the Europe VI emission regulation (≤0.01 g/kWh). Fig. 25 shows the time evolutions of C2H2, A4, and soot emission integrated over the whole computational domain at the 52% EGR ratio. It can be observed that the C2H2 was consumed off in the main combustion region. While the A4 and soot formation exhibited the similar trend, indicating that the selection of A4 as the initial soot precursor instead of C2H2 was more appropriate."
10,0-D combustion,"4.3 0-D combustion There are many factors affecting the fuel combustion and emission performance in the DICI combustion, including the initial boundary and flow conditions, injection and spray processes, and the fuel properties et al. To eliminate the physical effects and further investigate the soot tendency of the normal C1C5 alcohols and their blends with n-heptane, 0-D modeling investigations were performed based on the SENKIN code. Given that A4 is an important initial precursor of soot, the A4 formation can be used to indicate the soot tendency for different fuels [64]. In the 0-D modeling investigations, two cases were considered, i.e. the pure alcohols cases, and the alcohols blended with n-heptane at the 5% fuel oxygen content (O5 cases). The initial conditions were ranging from equivalence ratio (ϕ) of 1–6, temperature of 1000–3000 K, and pressure of 10 MPa. The calculations were conducted at the constant pressure and temperature condition, and the residence time was 1.5 ms. The maximum mole fraction of OH and C2H2, and the final A4 formation were used for further analysis. In the post-process, the results were normalized by the peak value in each case for comparisons. The ϕ−T maps of OH, C2H2, and A4 formation region for the pure alcohols, and the O5 cases are shown in Figs. 26 and 27 . It can be seen from Fig. 26 that methanol produced the least C2H2 and almost no A4 (<10−10). Methanol also produced the highest OH, indicating its highest oxidation ability. This is not surprising since the methanol molecule is composed of a CH3 radical and an OH radical. Thus, it is difficult to form the C2 and higher carbon chain chemical structures. As the carbon chain was longer, the C2H2 and A4 formation were higher. This exhibits that at the same ϕ the O atom in the molecule is more efficient than that in the O2 molecule in the oxidation of C2H2 and A4. For the O5 cases, as seen in Fig. 27, due to the quite similar C/H/O of the alcohol blends, the OH, C2H2, and A4 formation were close for each alcohol blend despite of the different carbon chain chemical structures. This conclusion is in agreement with the previous experimental investigation taken by Miyamoto et al. [65] and the computational investigation taken by Westbrook et al. [64]. Therefore, by comparison with the 3-D modeling results, it can be inferred that in the DICI combustion of the O5 cases, it was the different physical mixing qualities incurred by the different fuel reactivity dominated the soot formation but not the different carbon chain chemical structures."
11,Conclusions,"A combined reduced PRF-alcohols combustion kinetic mechanism composed of 161 species and 622 reactions was developed for engine combustion simulations. The reduced mechanism is based on our previous works on shorter carbon number alcohols [39,47,48], and on detailed mechanisms for n-propanol [23], i-propanol [23], and n-pentanol [32]. The reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism has been extensively validated against experimental ignition delays, laminar flame speeds, and species mole fraction profiles. New HCCI experiments were conducted, and the experimentally measured in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates were used to further validate the present reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism. 3-D DICI and 0-D modeling studies were also performed to investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of the normal C1C5 alcohols. The conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) A combined reduced PRF-alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanols, butanols, and n-pentanol) mechanism composed of 161 species and 622 reactions was developed. The reduced mechanism was extensively validated against experimental ignition delays, laminar flame speeds, and species mole fraction profiles. The overall results indicate that the mechanism provides reliable predictive performance for alcohol oxidation. (2) New HCCI combustion experiments fueled with 75% (mol.) n-propanol/25% n-heptane, 75% i-propanol/25% n-heptane, and 75% n-pentanol/25% n-heptane blends were conducted. The reduced PRF-alcohols mechanism can predicts the in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates, plus start of combustion timing adequately. The results show that the reactivity of n-propanol, i-propanol, and n-pentanol in HCCI combustion can be ranged by n-pentanol > i-propanol > n-propanol. (3) For the O5 cases in the 3-D DICI modeling investigations, the combustion performance of the different alcohol blends showed less discrepancies until at the higher EGR ratios (≥40%). These were attributed to the quite similar C/H/O mass ratio. The soot emissions were sequenced by methanol > ethanol > n-butanol > n-pentanol > n-propanol, due to the different reactivity of the alcohol blends. With the lower reactivity, the mixture was much leaner and less soot was formed. (4) In the 0-D modeling investigations, for the pure alcohol cases, methanol produced the least C2H2, almost no A4, and the highest OH. The C2H2 and A4 formation were sequenced by methanol < ethanol < n-propanol < n-butanol < n-pentanol. This reveals that at the same ϕ the O atom of the fuel molecule was more efficient than the O2 molecule for the oxidation of C2H2 and A4. For the O5 cases, due to the quite similar C/H/O mass ratio and the same O content, the OH, C2H2, and A4 formation for each alcohol blend were close. (5) Overall in the DICI combustion of the O5 cases, it was the different physical mixing qualities incurred by the different fuel reactivity dominated the soot formation but not the different carbon chain chemical structures."
