0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a mild and clean reagent has many applications. At present, most of H2O2 on an industrial scale is produced through Riedl−Pfleiderer process, in which O2 is reduced to H2O2 by anthraquinol, and H2 is oxidized to H2O2 by anthraquinone. Then H2O2 is separated, purified, and distilled to 30–70 wt% for transportation [1,2]. However, this indirect synthesis route is costly, involving the use of explosive H2, noble metal catalysts and toxic organic solvents. Recently, the production of H2O2 by using O2, water, and light as inputs has attracted an increasing attention.[3] A semiconductor absorbs light, and generates electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. Then the charge carriers migrate onto the surface to initiate redox reactions. Many semiconducting photocatalysts have been investigated, including TiO2, BiVO4, MoS2, g-C3N4, WO3, and metal-organic frameworks [4–8]. However, H2O2 concentration obtained in aqueous solution is too low to be useful in industry, mainly due to three problems. First, the charge carriers for any semiconductor quickly recombine, without net chemical reactions with sorbates. Second, O2 reduction and H2O oxidation may proceed through a four-electron pathway, with formation of H2O as the final product. Third, H2O2 once formed also decompose in situ through a reductive or oxidative pathway. The selective production of H2O2 from O2 and H2O via a semiconductor photocatalysis is facing a huge challenge. In semiconductor photocatalysis, the electrons and holes are photogenerated and consumed in pairs. Any action that accelerates hole transfer should promote the counterpart electron transfer, and vice versa. Bloh and co-workers studied alcohols as hole scavengers of TiO2, due to alcohol oxidation being easier than water oxidation, and they observed that methanol was more efficient than ethanol, propanol, and butanol, respectively [9,10]. Several groups examined different metal nanoparticles (NPs) as electron traps of BiVO4 or WO3, and observed that Au or Pd was the most effective for selective reduction of O2 into H2O2.[5,8,11] An increased H2O2 production by Au NPs was also reported for TiO2 and ZnO under UV light [4,12], and for MoS2 and C3N4 under visible light [6,13] For H2O2 production on TiO2 under UV light, Cai and co-workers showed a positive effect of CuCl2, due to Cu2+ reduction into Cu+, reducing O2 [14], while Maurino and co-workers reported a positive effect of NaF, due to F− ions replacing the OH− groups of TiO2, and inhibiting H2O2 adsorption and decomposition [15]. An increased production of H2O2 by other anions was also observed for Au/TiO2 and Pd/BiVO4, due to carbonate and phosphate anions suppressing H2O2 adsorption on one hand [11,16], and due to phosphate anions promoting hole transfer from TiO2 to methanol on the other hand [17]. Furthermore, the rate of H2O2 production is determined by several factors, including the solid parameters, light intensity, solution pH, temperature, sacrifice concentration, Au content and size [4,8,11]. In this work, the effect of several inorganic ions on the selective reduction of O2 has been examined. Transition metal ions and simple anions are widely present in aquatic environment. They play an important role in organic oxidation by O2 on various photocatalysts [18–23]. However, the counterpart reduction of O2 have been little studied, except those mentioned above. Reaction was carried out under visible light by using Au/WO3 as photocatalyst and methanol as sacrificial reagent. To avoid the effect of counter ions, all metal ions (Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) were in the form of perchlorate, while all anions (F−, Cl−, NO3 −, CO3 2−, SO4 2−, and PO4 3−) were in the form of sodium. Results showed that these ions had greatly different influences on H2O2 production. To understand the role of these ions, several experiments were conducted, including the effect of ion concentration and solution pH, the catalyst characterization before and after photoreaction, and electrochemical measurement for the average number of electrons used for O2 reduction, and the hole oxidation of water and methanol. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for different ion effects is discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials WO3 was purchased from Aladdin, and others from Shanghai Chemicals. All metal salts were in the forms of perchlorate, while all anions were in the forms of sodium. Au/WO3 was prepared as previously reported.[8] The solid characterization showed that as compared to WO3, Au/WO3 had similar monoclinic WO3 phase (unit cell, 0.4233 nm3; crystallite size, 36 nm; indirect band gap energy, 2.71 eV), but a slightly decreased surface area and an increased pore volume. This is indicative of WO3 pores being blocked by Au (Fig. S1–S3). In Au/WO3, Au was spherical crystals (10–50 nm in diameter), nearby sheet-like WO3 (100–500 nm in length), while the amount of Au was 0.34 wt%, measured on a Varian-730ES inductively coupled plasma. Moreover, the element binding energies, measured by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi, and calibrated with C 1 s at 284.8 eV, were similar to those reported for W6+, O2− and Au0, respectively."
3,Photocatalysis and analysis,"2.2 Photocatalysis and analysis Light source was a 400 W metal halide lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The light intensity reaching the reactor external surface was 4.0 mW/cm2. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were performed at 25 °C under fixed condition (50 mL suspension, 50 mg catalyst, and 4% CH3OH in volume). Before light irradiation, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min. At given intervals, 4.0 mL of the suspension was withdrawn, and filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane·H2O2 was measured at 553 nm through N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine oxidation catalyzed by horseradish peroxide.[24] Nickle ions were analyzed at 550 nm through a complex with dimethylglyoxime.[25] Solution spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV–visible spectrophotometer. Anions were analyzed by ion chromatography on a Dionex ICS90 (AS14 column, Na2CO3/NaHCO3 mobile phase, and 1.2 mL/min flow rate)."
4,Electrochemical measurement,"2.3 Electrochemical measurement Experiment was conducted on a CHI660E electrochemical station (Chenhua, Shanghai), where counter electrode was a platinum gauze, and reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl. Electrolyte was 0.5 M NaClO4 and scan rate was set at 10 mV/s. A working electrode was fabricated by doctor blade method. A fluorinated tin oxide substrate was coated with a gel containing catalysts and polyvinylalcohol, followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. Kinetics of O2 reduction was conducted on a glassy carbon rotating-disc-electrode (RDE), equipped with a modulated speed rotator (Keruite, Taizhou). RDE was coated with a slurry composed of nafion, N,N-dimethylformamide, and Au/WO3, followed by dryness at 60 °C overnight."
5,Results,
6,Effect of metal ions,"3.1 Effect of metal ions Fig. 1A shows the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3 in aqueous solution, measured in the absence and presence of 1 mM metal ions. In the dark, no H2O2 was observed. Under visible light, H2O2 was notably produced. However, the concentration of H2O2 in aqueous phase was not in a linear proportion to time. Since the rate of H2O2 formation is zero-order in constant O2 [10], this is indicative of H2O2 decomposition occurring at the same time. To evaluate the relative effect of these metal ions, H2O2 concentration produced at 5 h ([H2O2]5 h) was selected as a measure. Without addition of metal ions, [H2O2]5 h was 314 μM. In the presence of Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+, however, [H2O2]5 h changed to 451, 151, 10.5, and 0 μM, respectively. Obviously, the production of H2O2 is promoted by Ni2+, but it is more or less inhibited by other transition metal ions. To confirm the positive effect of Ni2 +, the reaction was carried out in the presence of Ni(ClO4)2 and NaClO4 at different concentrations, respectively (Fig. S4). As [Ni2+] increased, [H2O2]5 h increased initially, and then decreased (Fig. 1B). A maximum [H2O2]5 h of 457 μM was observed for 1.0 mM Ni(ClO4)2, and it was 1.52 times higher than that measured in the presence of 3.0 mM NaClO4. After a maximum, the decreased [H2O2]5 h with [Ni2+] is probably due to several factors. First, Ni2+ in aqueous solution absorbs visible light (Fig. S4), reducing the number of photons reaching Au/WO3. Second, Ni2+ in aqueous solution adsorbs onto Au/WO3 (Fig. S5), reducing the amount of O2 adsorption. Third, the particle aggregation of Au/WO3 in aqueous solution may change with the electrolyte concentration[26], influencing the solid properties for light absorption and O2 adsorption. At similar ionic strength, however, Ni(ClO4)2 had a [H2O2]5 h value larger than that of NaClO4. The salt effect exists, but it is not the main factor responsible for the observed change of [H2O2]5 h with Ni(ClO4)2 concentration."
7,Effect of anions and pH,"3.2 Effect of anions and pH Fig. 2A shows the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3, measured in the absence and presence of 10 mM different anions. Again, the concentration of H2O2 observed in aqueous phase did not linearly increase with time, especially in the case of carbonate. At given time, H2O2 concentration was greatly dependent of the anion added. To ensure the anion effect, experiment was conducted with 0–25 mM anions (Fig. S5). For chloride, nitrate, and sulfonate, [H2O2]5 h slightly increased with the anion concentration (Fig. 2B) For fluoride, carbonate, and phosphate, however, [H2O2]5 h greatly increased with the anion concentration, and then decreased after reaching a maximum. The maximum [H2O2]5 h, obtained for 10 mM fluoride, 4 mM carbonate, and 4 mM phosphate, were larger than those measured without anion addition, by factors of 1.45, 1.36, and 1.34, respectively. These observations indicate that all anions at an appropriate concentration are beneficial to H2O2 production via Au/WO3 photocatalysis. In aqueous solution, the above ions may undergo hydrolysis, changing the solution pH, and then influencing the rate of H2O2 production. With this concern in mind, the solution pH was monitored during the reaction process. As the irradiation time increased from 0 to 5 h, the solution pH decreased from 5.0 to 4.3–4.8, dependent of the ions used (Fig. S6A). Such the pH change was small, mainly due to proton release from WO3·H2O. Then experiment was carried out with Au/WO3 at initial pHs 3.0–7.0 in the absence and presence of 0.5 mM Ni(ClO4)2 or 10 mM NaF. However, [H2O2]5 h obtained at given pH always varied as NaF > Ni(ClO4)2 > no additives (Fig. S6B and S6C). Without doubt, H2O2 production on Au/WO3 is enhanced by either Ni2+ or F−. Moreover, during the reaction process, the suspension temperature increased from 25.0 °C to 30.2 °C, due to the reaction chamber warming. Such the temperature change is inevitable, and may disfavor H2O2 production, as observed for Au/TiO2 in the presence of ethanol[4], and for TiO2 in the presence of 2-propanol and phosphate [10]."
8,Co-effect of Ni2+ and F−,"3.3 Co-effect of Ni2+ and F− Since Ni2+ and F− are superior to other ions, they may cooperate each other, further increasing the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3. In practice, however, this is not the case (Fig. S7). In the presence of 1 mM Ni(ClO4)2, [H2O2]5 h decreased, as NaF concentration was increased from 0 to10 mM ( Fig. 3 A). In the presence of 10 mM NaF, [H2O2]5 h also decreased with the increase of Ni(ClO4)2 concentration (0–5 mM). These observations indicate that Ni2+ and F− need to be separately used as promotors for H2O2 production. It is worth noting that Ni2+ and F− have a positive effect only in the presence of methanol. Without addition of methanol, H2O2 production was inhibited by Ni2+ and F−, respectively (Fig. 3B). Probably, these ions in aqueous solution adsorb on Au/WO3 inhibiting O2 adsorption and reduction, and/or they promote formation of an additional species, which are reactive for methanol oxidation, but not for water oxidation. On the other hand, the ion-inhibited production of H2O2 in the absence of methanol is due to the ion-promoted H2O2 decomposition. But the rates of H2O2 decomposition measured in the absence and presence of methanol were similar (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that the ion-promoted production of H2O2 in the presence of methanol is due to Ni2+ and F− promoting formation of a reactive species for methanol oxidation, while the ion-inhibited production of H2O2 in the absence of methanol is due to Ni2+ and F− not only inhibiting O2 reduction but also promoting H2O2 decomposition. Note that Ni2+ and F− adsorption on WO3 in aqueous solution were confirmed, and their maximum amounts were approximately 26.6, and 1.40 μmol/g, respectively (Fig. S8)."
9,Catalyst stability,"3.4 Catalyst stability The chemical states of elements for the samples before and after photoreaction were examined by XPS. A suspension containing Au/WO3 and Ni2+ or F− was stirred, and irradiated with visible light for 2 h. Then the solid was collected, dried, and analyzed by XPS. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra for Ni 2p and F 1 s. The binding energies at 856.6 and 684.5 eV were similar to those reported for Ni2+ and F−, respectively [27,28]. In the absence or presence of methanol, the irradiated sample had no spectral change for F 1 s. In the presence of methanol, the irradiated sample also had no spectral change for Ni 2p. In the absence of methanol, however, the irradiated sample had a new signal at 858.3 eV, characteristics of Ni3+ species. This means that on Au/WO3 under visible light, Ni2+ is oxidized into Ni3+, which is reactive to methanol, but not reactive to water, as observed previously for TiO2 under UV in the presence of Ni(ClO4)2 [21]. Furthermore, the catalyst stability was also examined by another experiments. Fig. 5 A shows a four-repeat production of H2O2 on Au/WO3, measured in aqueous solution containing 4% CH3OH, and 1 mM Ni2+ or 10 mM F−. For each run, the irradiation time was fixed at 5 h. After each run, the catalyst was collected, and re-dispersed into a new solution. In all cases, [H2O2]5 h decreased with the number of runs. From the first run to the fourth, however, [H2O2]5 h, obtained for solid, solid plus Ni2+, and solid plus F−, decreased only by factors of 1.22, 1.17, and 1.16, respectively. The slightly decreased [H2O2]5 h from one run to another is due to the gradual loss of Au/WO3 on one hand, and due to the instability of Au/WO3 on the other hand (see details below). Fig. 5B shows a five-repeat test for methanol oxidation on an Au/WO3 electrode in 0.5 M NaClO4 under N2. The electrode current was recorded at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. After each test, the electrode was rinsed with water, and then re-used for another ion effect. When light turned on, the anode current raised up, and then reached a steady value. The increased current is due to methanol oxidation by the holes of Au/WO3. When light turned off, the anode current dropped down, and then reached a steady value. This is due to charge recombination. Again, the steady photocurrent slowly decreased with the number of cycles. From the first light-on to the fifth, the steady photocurrents obtained for Au/WO3, and for Au/WO3 in presence of Ni2+, CO3 2−, PO4 3−, and F−, decreased by factors of 1.19, 1.03, 1.01, 1.05, and 1.17, respectively. It has been reported that the photocurrent for a WO3 anode in acetate solution slowly decays with time, due to accumulation of a peroxo species, produced from the incomplete hole oxidation of water [29]. Then it is highly possible that the instability of Au/WO3 in the presence of methanol is also due to formation of a peroxo species, which is inhibited more or less by the adsorbed inorganic ions on the electrode. These observations indicate that Au/WO3 slowly deactivates, for O2 reduction into H2O2 in the presence of methanol under visible light."
10,Discussion,
11,Principles,"4.1 Principles On the band gap excitation, WO3 generates pairs of electrons and holes, followed by electron transfer to O2 and hole transfer to methanol at the same time. In aqueous solution at pH 0, the conduction band edge potential (E cb) and valence band edge potential (E vb) for thermally growth WO3 are approximately 0.3 and 3.0 V, respectively, versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)[31,32]. According to the standard redox potentials for different oxygen species ( Table 1), the electrons of WO3 are not reactive enough to enable O2 reduction into HO2, while the counterpart holes are capable of reducing CH3OH into CH2OH (1.40 V, NHE)[33]. In fact, the production of H2O2 on WO3 under UV/visible light was little [23], even in the presence of CH3OH [8]. After Au loading, the production of H2O2 on WO3 is increased, due to Au NPs not only capturing the electrons of WO3 and retarding recombination with holes, but also selectively catalyzing the two-electron reduction of O2. Since methanol oxidation is easier than water oxidation (1.40 vs. 2.81 V, NHE), the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3 is increased on the addition of methanol [8]. Note that water oxidation on a WO3 photoanode is efficient, because of the electron flow into a counter electrode increasing the efficiency of charge separation [34]. In the present work, the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3 under visible light in the presence of methanol is greatly influenced by different ions in aqueous solutions. However, understanding those ion effect is complicated, because different pathways are involved in the reaction process."
12,Effect of metal ions,"4.2 Effect of metal ions In aqueous solution, Cu2+ is positive not only to phenol oxidation on TiO2 and WO3 [23], but also to H2O2 production on TiO2 [14]. In those studies, similar pathway is proposed (Cu2+ + e− = Cu+, and 2Cu+ + O2 + 2 H+ = 2Cu2+ + H2O2), which facilitates the charge separation of a semiconductor, and hence speeds up the surface reactions. In the present case, however, H2O2 production on Au/WO3 is nearly inhibited by Cu+. Probably, Cu2+ is not capable of competing with Au for the electrons of WO3. Instead, it catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2, originally produced from Au sites. The Fermi level for Au is 0.48 eV lower that for WO3 [35,36], while the E cb value for WO3 is close to the potential for the Cu2+/Cu+ couple (Table 1). This means that Cu2+ reduction into Cu+ by the trapped electrons on Au sites is also impossible. In the presence of Fe3+, the production of H2O2 on Au/WO3 is completely inhibited. This is also ascribed to Fe3+ not only failing to compete with Au for the electrons of WO3, but also catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 via a Fenton-like reaction [37]. It is known that Fe3+ reduction into Fe2+ by the electrons of WO3 is fast, but the re-oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ by O2 is very slow, so that phenol oxidation on WO3 stops once Fe3+ is used up [23]. Different from Cu2+ and Fe3+, both Co2+ and Ni2+ are not reducible by the electrons of WO3 (Table 1). Instead, they are oxidized by the holes of WO3 to form a high valence metal species, as in the case of anatase TiO2 [22,38,39]. The holes of WO3 and TiO2 are highly reactive (3.0 vs. 3.1 V, NHE) [40]. In the present case, H2O2 production on Au/WO3 shows a 1.44-fold increase by Ni2+, but a 2.08-fold decrease by Co2+. The negative effect of Co2+ for O2 reduction on Au/WO3 matches that for phenol oxidation on TiO2 [41], which is ascribed to Co3+ ions being partially reduced back to Co2+, consuming photons, and hence slowing down surface reactions. However, Ni3+ is stable in an organics-free aqueous solution, as indicated by methanol effect and XPS analysis (Figs. 3A and 4A). This species is then reduced back to Ni2+ by methanol. Such a recycle between Ni2+ and Ni3+ greatly promotes the two-electron reduction of O2 on Au sites. To further understand the role of Ni2+, the electron reduction of O2 and the hole oxidation of methanol on an Au/WO3 film electrode were independently examined. Fig. 6 shows the effect of 1 mM Ni(ClO4)2 in 0.5 M NaClO4. As the potential swept negatively, the cathode current increased. At given potential, the dark current obtained under air was much larger than that measured under N2, indicative of O2 reduction being dominant. On addition of Ni2+, the cathode current decreased, together with a negatively shifted onset potential by 21 mV. The inhibited reduction of O2 by Ni2+ is probably indicative of Ni2+ competing with O2 for the surface sites of Au/WO3. As the potential swept positively, the photocurrent for water oxidation increased, due to the increased charge separation. At given potential, the photocurrent obtained in the presence of methanol was much larger than that measured in the absence of methanol. On the addition of Ni2+, the photocurrent remained unchanged, but it increased in the presence of methanol. These observations coincide with the XPS result that Ni2+ is oxidized to Ni3+, which is reactive to methanol, but not reactive to water. Because O2 adsorption on Au/WO3 is inhibited by Ni2+, the increased production of H2O2 by Ni2+ is surely due to the enhanced hole transfer to methanol, and hence the promoted electron transfer to O2."
13,Effect of anions,"4.3 Effect of anions These experiments were also conducted with an Au/WO3 electrode in the presence of 10 mM different anions (Fig. S9). For O2 reduction, the current decreased by PO4 3−, F−, and Cl−, respectively, while the current increased by SO4 2−, CO3 2−, and NO3 −, respectively. The corresponding onset potential shifts were − 109, − 2, 0, 21, 41, and 41 mV, respectively. These anions seem to have different interaction with Au/WO3 and O2. Then the increased production of H2O2 by PO4 3− and F− is only due to the anions improving the hole transfer to methanol and hence increasing the electron transfer to O2. For water oxidation under visible light, all anions had little influences, except that carbonate was positive. The latter is due to the improved efficiency of charge separation, through CO3 2− oxidation into CO3 −•, as in the case of Pt/TiO2 (CO3 2− + h+ = CO3 −•, 2CO3 −• = C2O6 2−, C2O6 2− + 4 h+ = CO2 + O2) [42]. For methanol oxidation, the anode photocurrent largely increased by F−, PO4 3−, and CO3 2−, respectively, but it slightly increased by SO4 2−, remained nearly unchanged by NO3 −, and decreased by Cl−. It has been reported that Cl− in aqueous solution is oxidized into Cl2 on a WO3 photoanode [29,43]. In the present case, methanol oxidation by Cl2 is probably unfavorable or slow (1.40 vs. 1.36 V, NHE), so that the anode photocurrent is decreased by Cl−. For an illuminated WO3 in aqueous solution, the hole oxidation of PO4 3−, CO3 2−, F−, SO4 2−, NO3 −, Cl−, and ClO4 − into the corresponding anion radicals are all favorable in thermodynamics (Table 1). The formation of Cl•, SO4 −•, ClO4 •, and PO4 2−• radicals on a WO3 photoanode[29,43], and the involvement of Cl•, SO4 −•, PO4 2−•, NO3 •, and CO3 −• radicals in TiO2 photocatalysis[19,20,44–46] have been proposed by many research groups. These radicals are highly reactive to methanol (1.52–2.75 vs. 1.40 V, NHE), but not reactive to water (1.52–2.75 vs. 2.81 V, NHE). However, some of the radicals recombine to less reactive products such as S2O8 2−, and C2O6 2−. At a result, PO4 3− and CO3 2− at a high concentration favoring their radical recombination have a reduced positive effect, either to phenol oxidation by O2 on TiO2 and Bi2WO6 [29,46,47], or to O2 reduction by methanol on Au/WO3 (Fig. 2B). In presence of ClO4 −, the increased production of H2O2 on Au/WO3 (Fig. 1B) is due to involvement of ClO4 • radicals. In presence of SO4 2−, the increased H2O2 production on Au/WO3 (Fig. 2), and the increased phenol oxidation on TiO2 are due to SO4 −• oxidizing methanol and phenol, respectively. In presence of NO3 − and Cl−, a little increased production of H2O2 (Fig. 2B) is probably due to the anions in aqueous solution poorly adsorbing onto Au/WO3, as compared to other anions (Fig. S9). However, the notably increased production of H2O2 by F− is difficultly understood. First, the hole oxidation of F− into F• is thermodynamically unfavorable (Table 1). Second, NaF is positive to methanol oxidation on Au/WO3 photoanode (Fig. 5B), and to phenol oxidation on TiO2 photocatalyst [18]. The latter is mainly due to F− ions replacing the linear OH− groups of TiO2 [48], and hence enhancing H2O oxidation into free •OH radicals in aqueous solution. Third, the hole oxidation of OH−/H2O into •OH on TiO2 is questionable [49]. The observed oxidation of water into O2 is proposed to occur through the hole attack to bridging OH−/O2− sites to generate bridging •OH/O−• radicals, followed by further hole attack and water dissociative adsorption [50]. If •OH radicals exist, they are quenched by anions to form less reactive anion radicals (Table 1). This results in a decreased phenol oxidation, which is not the case in practice. Then it is proposed that the bridging •OH/O−• radicals are stabilized by neighborly substituted F− ions via a hydrogen bond, which inhibits recombination with electrons, promotes O2 reduction, improves charge separation, and hence increases phenol oxidation on TiO2 [21]. Such the reaction pathway is also possible for the observed positive effect of F− in WO3 photocatalysis. Thus O2 reduction on Au, and CH3OH oxidation by •OH/O−• are both increased. Note that in the Salvador model[50], five steps are involved for H2O oxidation, which is kinetically slow, as compared to methanol oxidation [9]. Because of that, F− ions on Au/WO3 have little influence on the photocurrent of water oxidation (Fig. S9C), but they decrease H2O2 production in absence of methanol (Fig. 3B). The latter is due to surface F− species inhibiting O2 adsorption and reduction (Fig. S9A). After a maximum, the decreased [H2O2]5 h by NaF (Fig. 2B) is due to the salt increasing particle aggregation, and decreasing light absorption, as in the case of TiO2 [18]. All anions in aqueous solution have little influence on the pathway of O2 reduction on Au/WO3. Experiment was conducted on a rotating dish electrode in 0.5 M NaClO4 under air, and the current−voltages curves were measured at different rotating speeds. Then the cathode current at − 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl was chosen to estimate the average number of electrons (n) used for O2 reduction through Koutecky−Levich plot (see details in Fig. S10). For WO3, and Au/WO3, the n values were 2.2 and 2.1, respectively. For Au/WO3 in presence of F−, PO4 3−, CO3 2−, SO4 2−, Cl−, and NO3 −, the n values were 2.3, 2.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1, and 2.1, respectively. For all samples, the average n was 2.1 ± 0.1. These observations coincide with the fact that (1) the electrons of WO3 are not reactive enough to enable one-electron reduction of O2, (2) Au NPs are co-catalysts for selective reduction of O2 into H2O2, and (3) all anions take part in WO3 photocatalysis only through a hole transfer channel."
14,Possible mechanism,"4.4 Possible mechanism A possible mechanism for the ion effect is shown in Fig. 7. Note that under visible light and in presence of methanol, the production of H2O2 due to the electron transfer from Au into WO3 (Au surface plasmon resonance) was observed, but the reaction was much slower than that due to the electron transfer from WO3 into Au (WO3 photocatalysis)[8]. Therefore, the former is not considered in the present work. Last but not least, the positive effect of F− on H2O2 production is weaken by Ni2+, and vice versa (Fig. 3 A). Probably, this is due to formation of a complex between them, decreasing the neat concentration of Ni2+ and F−, respectively. When two solutions were mixed together, however, no spectral change was observed (Fig. S11A−C), indicative of no complex formation (Ni2+ + 4F− = NiF4 2−). Then to understand the combined effect of Ni2+ and F−, the electrochemical oxidation of Ni2+ on an Au/WO3 film electrode in 0.5 M NaClO4 was conducted (Fig. S11 D−F). Without addition of NaF or Ni(ClO4)2, the onset potential (E on) was 1.19 ± 0.02 vs. Ag/AgCl, due to water oxidation. In the presence of 10 mM NaF and 3 mM Ni(ClO4)2, E on were 1.18 and 1.00 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. This means that NaF has little influence on water oxidation, while Ni2+ is oxidized into Ni3+ [22]. In presence of both NaF and Ni(ClO4)2, however, E on changed to 0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 50 mV more negative than that in presence of Ni(ClO4)2. This is due to formation of a new complex (Ni3+ + 4 F− = NiF4 −), which is more stable than NiF4 2−, and has an oxidizing ability weaker than that of Ni(H2O)4 3+. Assuming that new Ni species are not reactive toward methanol oxidation, then the positive effect of Ni2+ for H2O2 reduction is decreased by F−. Similarly, F− ions have a reduced concentration by Ni2+, and hence show a decreased positive effect on H2O2 production, as compared to that in absence of Ni2+. Because NiF4 − has a small formation constant, it easily transforms into a more stable complex if a stronger ligand or metal ion is present. We speculate that as a hole catalyst in WO3 photocatalysis, F− anions in the absence of transition metal ions, and Ni2+ ions in the absence of a strong complex ligand should be used, respectively."
15,Conclusion,"This work has shown that Ni2+, and all anions in aqueous solution can promote the photocatalytic reduction of O2 into H2O2 on Au/WO3 under visible light and in the presence of methanol. The enhanced production of H2O2 is due to those ions taking part in the hole reaction of WO3. The resulting Ni3+ and anion radicals oxidize methanol, respectively, promoting the counterpart reduction of O2 on Au sites. The proposal is supported by electrochemical measurement. However, the positive effect of Ni2+ was weaken by F−, and vice versa. This is due to formation of a NiF4 − species, which is less reactive than Ni(H2O)4 3+ on one hand, and decreases the neat concentration of free F− on the other hand. Therefore, the counter ions for Ni2+ and F− should be inert to a complex formation, respectively. Different from the above ions, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Co2+ in aqueous solution are all detrimental to H2O2 production. In those cases, Co2+ ions partially act as a recombination center of Au/WO3, while both Fe3+ and Cu2+ efficiently catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 on Au sites via a Fenton-like reaction. This work highlights that inorganic ions in aqueous solution are important not only to organic pollutant treatment via semiconductor photocatalysis (TiO2 and WO3), but also to the corresponding selective reduction of O2."
