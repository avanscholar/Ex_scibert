0,Introduction,"As the depletion of fossil resource and growing environmental deterioration, biomass resource has received increased attentions in various industries. The productions of bio-fuels or added-value chemicals obtained from sustainable biomass resources are a promising pathway to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and decrease the emission of greenhouse gas [1–3]. In particular, furfuryl alcohol (FFA) has been the primarily chemical intermediate as the starting for the production of chemical products, such as vitamin C, lysine, plasticizer, dispersing agent, lubricant, resins etc. [1,4–6]. The annual production of FFA exceeds 2.8 × 105 t/Y, and approximately 60% of FFA are produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural (FFR), which is one of the main products derived from lignocellulosic biomass [7,8]. However, the hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA is a complex chemical reaction with lots of undesirable products. The potential reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of FFR [9,10] are displayed in Fig. 1 . FFA produced by the hydrogenation of CO is in competition with tetrahydrofurfural (THFR) obtained by the hydrogenation of ring. The other by-products accompanied by the hydrogenation of FFR are 2-methylfuran (2-MF, hydrogenolysis of CO), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF, hydrogenolysis followed by hydrogenation). Additionally, the formation of furan and butanol are produced by the decarbonylation reaction under the same conditions of the hydrogenation of FFR. Therefore, a variety of undesired substances could be produced via the saturation of different functional groups, and all these competing reactions make it difficult to enhance the selectivity of the target product (FFA). Therefore, the core challenge of hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA is to avoid the side reactions and control the hydrogenation extent. Industrially, there are two strategies to produce FFA via the hydrogenation of FFR [5,11,12]: gas-phase hydrogenation and liquid-phase hydrogenation. Considering gas-phase hydrogenation, the energy consumption of FFR evaporation is high, and the selectivity or conversion of FFA are low [13,14]. Compared with gas-phase hydrogenation, liquid-phase hydrogenation is an effective technology with preferable selectivity [15–17], and molecular hydrogen gas is regarded as one of the most popular raw materials in conventional liquid-phase hydrogenation. However, the application of expensive external hydrogen gas presents several issues, such as the potential safety issues regarding hydrogen transportation, storage, and handling [5,9]. Furthermore, the conventional liquid-phase hydrogenation would accompany by the huge energy consumption with high temperature and pressure, and the catalysts (such as Cr-species) are high toxicity and unfriendly to environment. In order to realize the green hydrogenation, the technique for FFR hydrogenation to FFA using environment friendly catalysts and solvents without external hydrogen gas at mild conditions is required. In recent years, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), referring to the addition of hydrogen to a molecule from a non-H2 hydrogen donor, has been proposed as an attractive way to hydrogenate organic molecules including biomass-derived compounds [18–20]. In-situ hydrogenation, one of the catalytic transfer hydrogenation, is a novel method to upgrade the complex chemicals [16,21]. The literatures release that conversion efficiency of in-situ hydrogenation using activity hydrogen from aqueous-phase reforming (APR) is higher than the conventional liquid-phase hydrogenation using external hydrogen gas as the hydrogen donors [21,22]. This method does not employ the hazardous pressurized hydrogen gas, catalysts and solvents, and it could reduce the cost of expensive transportation and storage of external gaseous hydrogen at mild conditions. In the reaction, catalysts, hydrogen donors, and solvents would affect the efficiency of upgrading and the product distributions. Several researches reporting the hydrogenation in organic components (alcohols or formic acid) have been published, while the hydrogenation proceed in water is still quite challenging. The researches about the catalysts about aqueous-phase reforming are noble metal loaded materials and non-noble materials, including Au, Pt, Pd, Ni, Mo, Ce, Mg etc. [23,24], and the support materials are usually activated carbon, metallic oxide, alloy, polyethersulfone (PES) and perovskite type materials etc. [23,25,26]. While the research about the coupling of APR and hydrogenation is less in publication and need further investigation. In this paper, we investigated the in-situ hydrogenation of furfural conversion to furfuryl alcohol via aqueous phase reforming of alcohols using homemade MgTiO3 support material with noble metals loading at mild conditions. The alcohols contained methanol, ethylenglycol, and glycerol, and the noble metals were Au, Pt, and Pd. Effect of the other parameters on the hydrogenation process was also investigated to optimize the experimental conditions, including reaction temperature, reaction time, reaction pressure, and component proportion. Additionally, the commercial Pd/C catalyst and recyclability of the excellently catalyst were also performed. Moreover, in order to better understanding the mechanism of the in-situ hydrogenation catalysis, the aqueous-phase reforming of methanol and water to produce hydrogen gas and the hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA with external hydrogen gas were also investigated. The morphology properties were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The structures and chemical states of the catalyst were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DSC), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), O2-temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD), H2-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Furfural (C5H4O2, GC: 99.5%) and furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2, GC: 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd. Methanol (CH4O, HPLC: 99.9%), ethyl alcohol (C2H5O, GC: 99.9%), ethylenglycol (C2H6O2, GC: 99.9%) and glycerol (C3H8O3, GC: 99.9%) were purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti, AR: 99.9%) and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (AR: 99.9%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Commercial catalyst (Pd/C, Pd: 1.0 wt%) was purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd. HAuCl4·6H2O, H2PtCl6·6H2O and Na2PdCl4 were all analytically pure and purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The water used for all the experiments was deionized water with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation 2.2.1 MgTiO3 support The details of the MgTiO3 support materials preparation were as follows. Solution-A: 0.01 mol·L−1 of C16H36O4Ti was dissolved in the absolute ethyl alcohol with vigorously stirring. Solution-B: 0.01 mol·L−1 of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 100 mL of ethyl alcohol aqueous solution (V ethyl alcohol:V water = 1:1). Then the isopyknic Solution-B was injected in Solution-A dropwise (5 mL·min−1) with vigorously stirring for 4 h. Next, the suspension was crystallized under vacuum condition at 318 K for 12 h, then it was filtrated, washed and dried at 393 K for 12 h. Finally, the powder was calcination in muffle at 723 K, 823 K and 923 K for 3 h respectively, denoted as MgTiO3-450, MgTiO3-550 and MgTiO3-650. So the MgTiO3 support materials were obtained. 2.2.2 Noble metal loading An appropriate amounts of HAuCl4·4H2O, H2PtCl6·6H2O and Na2PdCl4 were loaded onto the homemade MgTiO3 support materials surfaces respectively, using the wetness impregnation method [16,27]. Firstly, the MgTiO3 support materials were added into the aqueous solution of H2AuCl6·6H2O, H2PtCl6·6H2O or H2PdCl6·6H2O. Secondly, the mixture was adjusted to pH = 9.5 using 30% ammonium hydroxide. Thirdly, the suspensions were ultrasonic dispersion vigorously for 4 h, dried under vacuum condition at 353 K for 12 h (denoted as Au/Pt/Pd powders), and the Au/Pt/Pd powders were calcination at 623 K, denoted as Calcination sample. Lastly, the Calcination samples were reduced with Ar/H2 (VAr:VH2 = 90:10), which the reduction temperature program heated the sample to 623 K at a rate of 5 K·min−1 and held it for 1 h. The catalyst samples were denoted as Au/Pt/Pd@MT-450, Au/Pt/Pd@MT-550 and Au/Pt/Pd@MT-650. Hence, the noble metal (0.5 wt%) loaded catalysts were prepared."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure 2.3.1 In-situ hydrogenation The in-situ hydrogenation catalysis experiments were carried out via the aqueous-phase reforming of alcohols for hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA. Deionized water, alcohols, furfural and catalyst were added into a 10 mL autoclave, which the proportions (mass ratio) of water, alcohols, and FFR were 1:49:1, 10:40:1, 20:30:1, 25:25:1, 30:20:1, 40:10:1, and 49:1:1 with the fixed volume of 6 mL. The ratios of furfural/catalyst mass proportion were also tested. The alcohols contained methanol, ethylenglycol and glycerol, and the air in the autoclave was removed with N2 flow before heating. Then the autoclave was heated at a rate of 3 K·min−1 with a stirring rate of 500 rpm. The desired reaction temperature was between 373 K and 453 K (20 K interval), and remained for a set time period. The effect of initial pressure also performed with argon gas (0–5 MPa, 1 MPa interval). In addition, 0 MPa referred to the approximate 0 MPa, which the autoclave was purged by extremely low N2 gas flow for 5 min, and then closed the air inlet valve and the air outlet valve. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled rapidly in a water bath to room temperature. The mixture was removed from the autoclave and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter. Then the products were obtained in high purity by distillation of the filtrate under vacuum at 333 K to recover the alcohols and water. The recovered alcohols and water could be used in subsequently hydrogenation tests. Furthermore, the tests without catalysts were also executed at the same conditions. The hydrogenation products were analyzed by Shimadzu GC-14A gas chromatography equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector and a capillary column (CP-Wax 52CB). 2.3.2 Controlled experiment The controlled experiments were carried out to investigate the mechanism of the in-situ hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA. The test was broken into two parts. The first part was to execute the aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH and H2O using the Pt@MT-450 catalyst at the same conditions of the in-situ hydrogenation test. The sealed autoclave was purged using N2 (10 vol% Ar, internal standard) three times. After the reactions, the gas phase was analyzed using Agilent 7820 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The second part was to set up the traditional hydrogenation of FFR to FFA with external hydrogen gas. The reaction step was the same as the Section 2.3.1 without methanol."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Parameters affecting,"3.1 Parameters affecting Fig. 2 a & Fig. S1(a–c) show the conversion and selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA using different solvents and catalysts. As shown in the results, MgTiO3-450 support material exhibits the higher catalytic activity than the other support materials, and Pt loaded MgTiO3-450 (Pt@MT-450) releases the best catalytic activity than Ag or Pd loaded MgTiO3 materials in different solvents system. Pt@MT-450 also shows the higher catalytic activity than the commercial catalyst (Pd/C). While the hydrogenation of FFR to FFA without catalyst is approximately equal to zero, and the conversion and selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA are lowest using water as the single solvent. Methanol with water displays the better catalytic efficiency than ethylenglycol or glycerol with water, indicating that the more complex structures of alcohols lead to the lower catalytic activity. Hence, the suitable solvent is methanol with water. Fig. 2 b shows the effect of the components proportion on the hydrogenation of FFR. It is evident that the suitable components proportion is 30:20:1 for water:methanol:FFR. Fig. S1 (d–e) show the conversion and selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA at different reaction temperature and reaction time. As shown in Fig. S1d, the conversion of FFR increases with the reaction temperature increasing, while the selectivity of the target product increases before 393 K and then decreases. Fig. S1e shows that the conversion of FFR increases before 1.0 h and then it remains a constant, while the selectivity increases before 1.0 h and then decreases obviously. The decreased selectivity could be caused by the condensation reaction or the depth hydrogenation. Hence, the suitable reaction temperature is 393 K and the suitable reaction time is 1.0 h. The effect of the initial pressure is shown in Fig. 2 c. From the results, it indicates that the initial pressure could affect the conversion and the selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA distinctly. With the initial pressure increasing, both the conversion and the selectivity increase. The suitable initial pressure is 0.5 MPa, and the conversion of FFR is about 88% and the selectivity is near 95%. In order to further enhance the conversion of FFR, the catalyst dosage was also investigated (Fig. S1f). As shown in the figure, it could be known that the higher catalyst dosage, the higher conversion of FFR. The suitable dosage was 10:1 for furfural:catalyst mass ratio with the conversion of 97.1% and the selectivity of 96.3%. The recyclability of the Pt@MT-450 catalyst is shown in Fig. 2 d. From the results, it is evident that the conversion and selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA also maintain the high level after six times recycled. Compared to the published articles [9,28], the catalytic activity of aqueous-phase reforming of methanol technology using Pt@MT-450 catalyst is superior than the other technologies and catalysts. (a: Conversion and selectivity of the FFR hydrogenation to FFA using different catalysts and solvents, Condition: 393 K, 1 h, 0 MPa, 10:40:1:0.02 (water:alcohols:FFR:catalyst); b: effect of the components proportion, Condition: 393 K, 1 h, 0 MPa, CH3OH+H2O, Pt@MT-450; c: effect of the initial pressure, Condition: 393 K, 2 h, 30:20:1:0.02 (water:alcohols:FFR:catalyst), CH3OH+H2O, Pt@MT-450; d: recyclability of the catalyst, Condition: 393 K, 1 h, 0.5 MPa, 30:20:1:0.1 (water:alcohols:FFR:catalyst), CH3OH+H2O, Pt@MT-450)"
7,Contrast test,"3.2 Contrast test The results of the aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH to produce molecular hydrogen gas are listed in Table 1 . From the results, the hydrogen gas could be produced via methanol reforming over the Pt loaded MgTiO3-450 catalyst. While the hydrogen gas could not be detected by MgTiO3-450 support material without Pt loading, indicating that Pt element performed the important role in hydrogen gas production. On the other hand, the production amount of hydrogen gas by Pt@MT-450 increases with the initial pressures increase. Considering the TOF value, the Pt@MT-450 value increased with initial pressures, and the TOF value under 1.0 MPa is about 1085. In addition, the other gases has been listed in Table S1. According to the results, it could be observed that there is a slight amounts of CO production. The results of GC-MS analysis via the traditional hydrogenation of FFR with external hydrogen gas are listed in Table 2 . The conversion using traditional hydrogenation with external hydrogen gas performs an obviously decrease than that using the in-situ hydrogenation method at the same conditions. The conversion increases with the initial pressure increase, and the conversion is only 81.38% under the initial pressure of 1.0 MPa, and there is also a significant reduction on the selectivity of FFR hydrogenation to FFA. The results of GC-MS indicate that the products contain the furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, furan, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and even 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Therefore, the efficiency of the traditional hydrogenation with external hydrogen using the Pt@MT-450 as the catalyst is lower than that of the in-situ hydrogenation at the same conditions."
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization 3.3.1 Morphology properties 3.3.1.1 SEM & EDX analysis Fig. S2 shows the SEM images and EDX spectra of Pt@MT-450 catalyst. As shown in Fig. S2a & S2b, the results release that there is no specific morphology and particle size, and it could be observed as the nearly spherical structure with nanoscale particles size. The elemental mapping results of the catalyst (Fig. S2c & Fig. S2d) show a homogeneous distribution of Mg element, Ti element, and Pt element on the Pt@MT-450 surface. 3.3.1.2 TEM analysis The morphology and the particles size distribution of Pt nanoparticles on the Pt@MT-450 catalyst are characterized and examined by TEM. From Fig. 3 a, the MgTiO3-450 support material has the polygonal crystalline shape which is consistent with the results of SEM, and the average particles size of the support material is about 20–40 nm. As shown in Fig. 3 b & c, it shows that the high dispersion Pt nanoparticles could be easily obtained via incipient wetness impregnation method. Moreover, the average size of the Pt nanoparticles is about 2.2 nm in the visible range. The HAADF-TEM images (Fig. 3 d & e) indicate that the brighter particles could be the Pt nanoparticles and homogeneous dispersion on the MgTiO3-450 support material. Fig. 3 f displays the particles distribution of the Pt nanoparticles, indicating that the Pt nanoparticles in mean size of about 2–3 nm. 3.3.2 Physicochemical properties The physicochemical properties of the Calcination sample, Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst, TH catalyst (Pt@MT-450-450 used in traditional hydrogenation with external hydrogen gas), and Support material are summarized in Table S2. The presence of Pt, Ti and Mg elements in all the catalysts are determined by ICP-AES. The Pt and Mg mass ratios in Support material are 0% and 20.62%, closed to theoretical content of MgTiO3. Compared to the Support material, the Recycled catalyst has the lowest Mg content which may be dissolved in the solvent, and it has no significantly change in the other catalysts. The Pt element also has no significantly change except for the Recycled catalyst, which could be related to the separation of small amount of Pt nanoparticles from the support material surface after reaction. The surface specific areas (SSA) of the support material is 132.73 m2 g−1, while after loading the Pt nanoparticles, the SSA of the Fresh catalyst increases to 144.15 m2 g−1. As depicted in Fig. S3, the catalyst performs the isotherms with characteristics of type III patterns, and the H4 type isotherm of the catalyst reflects the slot hole, which might be resulted from the plate particle accumulation. After hydrogenation reaction, the SSA of the Recycled catalyst is lower than the Fresh catalyst. 3.3.2.1 DSC-TG analysis As shown in Fig. S4, it reveals the weight loss of the Pt powder during the measurement under air flow condition. The material is stable, and the maximum weight loss is only 0.7960% at approximately 653 K which may be mainly caused by the dissociation of chloroplatinic acid. Then it increase about 0.1592% from 653 K to 923 K may be caused by the oxidation of Pt element. Hence this Pt powder is suitable for calcination at 673 K and the dissociation of chloroplatinic acid is conducive to the reduction of the oxidation platinum. 3.3.2.2 FT-IR analysis Fig. S5 shows the FT-IR spectra of the Support material, Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst, and TH catalyst. It shows that the bands near 570 and 445 cm−1 are attributed to the characteristic peak of the MgTiO3 support material (Ti − O stretching and Ti − O–Ti bridge stretching modes) [29]. As compared to the Fresh catalyst, the characteristic peaks of the other catalysts barely change. However, the other new bands on the Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst and TH catalyst may be assigned to the characteristic peaks of FFR or FFA. 3.3.2.3 XRD analysis Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst and Support material. It reveals that the MgTiO3-450 support material is matched well with the pattern of standard diffraction peaks of geikielite (pdf = No. 06-0494). Compared to the Support material, the Fresh catalyst also is matched well with the pattern of platinum (pdf = No. 04-0802, 2θ = 39.5, 46.6 and 67.3 represent the {1,1,0}, {2,0,0} and {2,2,0}). Moreover, it also shows that the peak intensity of the Recycled catalyst releases an obviously decrease, indicating that the crystallinity of the MgTiO3-450 support changed during the catalysis recycled. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of Pt are barely to find in the Recycled catalyst, and it indicates that the Pt particle reacted in the hydrogenation process or separated from the catalyst surface, resulting a low activity. 3.3.2.4 H2-TPR analysis The H2-TPR profiles of the Calcination sample, Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst, TH catalyst, and Support material are plotted in Fig. S6. All the materials show two or three reduction peaks except for Fresh catalyst (only one peak). Regarding the Fresh catalyst, the only reduction peak could be attributed to the partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ [30,31]. There is no other reduction peak because that the sample has been reduced under H2 flow under 623 K. For the rest of samples, the peak at about 607 K could be assigned to the reduction of high valence Pt to zero valence Pt. The normal Pt reduction temperature is more than 623 K, while the lower reduction temperature of the catalyst implies that a smaller size and higher dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the MgTiO3-450 support material [32]. The reduction peak at about 473 K could be attributed to reduction of removing physically adsorbed oxygen and/or the ordinarily chemically oxygen on the sample surfaces [33]. Table 3 shows the H2 consumption calculated through quantitative integration of the corresponding TPR peaks. There is on obviously change of the consumption of Ti4+ reduction peak for all samples, and the H2 consumption amount of Ti4+ reduction to Ti3+ for each sample is about 0.35 mmol·g−1. Moreover, the consumptions of Pt reduction peaks for Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst, and TH catalyst show a significantly decrease than the Calcination sample (the order: Calcination sample > Recycled catalyst > TH catalyst > APR catalyst). The H2 consumption amount of the Pt reduction peak on Support material sample was not detected, indicating that no other elements on the sample could be reduced at the same temperature. 3.3.2.5 O2-TPD analysis As shown in Fig. S7, the oxygen desorption profiles exhibit three regions from 373 to 600 K (Region I), from 673 to 900 K (Region II), and from 900 to 1123 K (Region III), respectively. The desorbed oxygen in Region I could be ascribed to the surface adsorbed molecular oxygen and/or oxygen species migrating via surface oxygen vacancies [22]. For the Region II, it could be ascribed to the oxygen species migrating from the subsurface of Pt particles or the interface between the Pt particles and the support material [34,35]. Peaks at about 1023 K in the Region III for all the catalysts could be linked to lattice oxygen, whose migration and desorption should be achieved at even high temperature [35]. Table 3 also summarizes the desorbed oxygen amounts based on the quantitative integration of O2-TPD profiles. The lowest desorption amount of Support material and Calcination sample in Region I was detected, which could be associated to the lowest oxygen mobility or the minimum amount of surface oxygen species. The phenomenon could be related to lack of surface oxygen vacancies. While the desorption amount of Fresh catalyst in Region I is higher than Recycled, APR, and TH catalyst samples, indicating that the oxygen vacancies decrease on the catalysts after reaction and lead to a decrease in catalysis hydrogenation. For the Region II, there was no signal on Support sample surface, while it was detected the highest amount on the Fresh catalyst surface. For the Region III, it should be noted that all the catalysts exhibited the high amount of desorbed oxygen (centered at 1023 K), indicating that the lattice oxygen over MgTiO3 could be released. According to the literatures [36], the higher content of oxygen vacancies and oxygen species on the catalyst surface, the higher catalytic activity. 3.3.2.6 NH3-TPD analysis NH3 is often selected as the probe molecule to test the acidity of the catalyst, which could influence the catalytic activity for hydrogenation. NH3-TPD is measured to determine acid strength and amounts of acid sites. According to the results (Fig. S7 and Table 3), the NH3-TPD profiles could be divided into three regions: i) the low temperature region from 373 to 573 K corresponds to weak-strength acid sites, ii) the middle temperature region from 573 to 773 K corresponds to moderate acid sites iii) the peak appearing at temperatures higher than 923 K assigns to the strong acid sites [22,37]. All the samples present the Region I, and Region II do not appear in Calcination sample and Support material. For Region III, the Fresh catalyst is observed the highest intensity. After the reaction, both the intensities of moderate and strong acid sites decrease. The strong acid sites are benefit for the C = O adsorption on the catalyst, leading to the high selectivity [38]. 3.3.2.7 XPS analysis XPS measurement is carried out to evaluate the composition and valence states of Ti element, Mg element, and Pt element on the catalyst surface. As illustrated in Fig. S8a, two intensive photoelectron peaks appearing in 458.4 eV and 464.2 eV are attribution to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 [9,29], and the bending energies of Ti elements on the Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst and TH catalyst surfaces demonstrate that there are no significant change. Hence, it is evident that Ti element may be not involved in the hydrogenation reaction. Fig. S8b shows that the bending energy of Mg 2p on the Fresh catalysis surface is 1303.5 eV, while it shifts to 1304.8 eV on the Recycled catalysis surface and 1305.4 eV on the TH catalysis surface, indicating that the Mg element may take participation in the in-situ hydrogenation catalysis and the traditional hydrogenation catalysis. The changed bending energy of Mg elements may provide energy for the hydrogenation catalysis [9]. However, the bending energy of Mg 2p on the APR catalyst surface is unchanged, indicating that the Mg element may not serve the aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH reaction. As indicated in Fig. 5 , the bending energy of Pt 4f performs the change on the Fresh catalyst, Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst and TH catalyst surfaces. In Fig. 5a, the Pt element on the Fresh catalyst reveals that there is only the single valence (metallic Pt0, Pt 4f 7/2: 70.2 eV; Pt 4f 5/2: 73.8 eV), which is consistent with the result of H2-TPR. [39,40]. However, Pt element on the Recycled catalyst surface (Fig. 5b) shows a positive shift and a new Pt valence compared to the Fresh catalyst (Pt2+, Pt 4f 7/2: 71.4 eV; Pt 4f 5/2: 75.6 eV) [40,41], indicating that Pt elements are involved in the in-situ hydrogenation catalysis reaction. Moreover, the Pt element on the APR catalyst surface and the TH catalyst surface (Fig. 5 c & d) also performs the similar positive shift and the new Pt valence peaks. The Pt2+ species may originate from surface layer formation of Pt-O bonds [41]. The atom ratio of Pt2+ calculated by the XPS results is about 38.73%, 15.62% and 29.78% in the total Pt atoms on the surfaces of Recycled catalyst, APR catalyst and TH catalyst respectively. It is speculated that the Pt element is involved in the aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH reaction and the hydrogenation catalysis of FFR to FFA. In summary, the Pt2+content on the Recycled catalyst surface is higher than that on the APR catalyst surface or TH catalyst surface, while it is lower than the sum of Pt2+content on the APR catalyst and TH catalyst, indicating that the Pt2+ may be reduced by the high activity hydrogen obtained by the aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH. During the in-situ hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA via aqueous-phase reforming of CH3OH, the proposed catalysis model is illustrated in Fig. 6 . According to the morphology properties tests (TEM and SEM), Pt nanoparticles are high dispersion on the MgTiO3-450 support nanoparticles. As the nanomaterial offers the large specific surface area, both the reactant and products could be accelerated. According to the results of contrast test, CH3OH and H2O could be reformed on the catalyst surface and H2, CO2, CO and trace CH4 are produced. Based on XPS analysis, Pt element performs the main role of the active site. Then the hydrogenation of FFR conversion to FFA would be occurred on the catalyst surface. During the reaction, the CO bands are selectively hydrogenation to the COH bands from by the attack of the activity hydrogen gas on the surface of the catalyst with the strong acid sites. Once FFA is formed on the Pt@MT-450 surface, it leaves quickly and then the new FFR molecule replaces the FFA molecule. CO is toxic to Pt active site, while the yield of CO is few. The presence of methanol and low reaction temperature could reduce the production of carbon deposition. According to the XPS analysis and H2-TPR, we speculated that a part of active hydrogen may be involved in the process of Pt2+ reduction to Pt0 [42]. All of the reasons result in the perfect recyclability of this catalyst. Furthermore, the better dispersibility of nanomaterial in water favored for the hydrogenation reaction. These properties are all contributed to the significant improvement of catalytic activity of Pt@MT-450 nanoparticles catalyst."
9,Conclusion,"A novel method for the hydrogenation catalysis of FFR to FFA was proposed using Pt@MT-450 as the catalyst via in-situ hydrogenation method. Methanol and water could be reformed on the catalyst surface by the action of the Pt nanoparticles. The hydrogenation of FFR was occurred on the catalyst surface with the synergistic effect of Pt nanoparticles and Mg elements. The hydrogen gas obtained by the methanol reforming could not only hydrogenate the FFR conversion to FFA but also reduce the oxidation Pt to Pt0 which could improve the recyclability of the Pt@MT-450 catalyst. The results revealed that the conversion was about 97% and the selectivity was about 96% at the mild conditions (393 K, 0.5 MPa)."
