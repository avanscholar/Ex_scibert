0,Introduction,"The global community has acknowledged biofuel for providing sustainable energy, thereby reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. Bio-ethanol refinery is thus conceived to develop new economic strategies for upgrading the fuel properties of this bio-derived platform chemical into species with higher energy density and greater miscibility with conventional fuel [1–6]. In terms of energy density, linear alcohols are very close to gasoline and can be employed in fuel blends for diesel engines (with a formulation of up to 30% of alcohols in diesel fuel) [7]. However, drawbacks can arise due to their poor lubricant properties that can negatively influence an engine’s durability [8]. To overcome this problem, mixtures also containing branched alcohols are already used as lubricants (in particular 2-alkyl alcohols, also known as Guerbet alcohols) [9]. An industrial scale-up of second-generation biofuels-production processes from waste-derived feedstocks is, however, still hampered by several critical technological issues and bottleneck steps. An attractive route for the catalytic conversion of bio-ethanol into butanol and higher alcohols (both linear and branched) is the Guerbet reaction, which in theory furnishes an ideal mechanism for alcohol homologation [1–6]. While simple in principle, this is difficult in application due to several concerns encountered in increasing selectivity and conversion. One of the main troubles of this process resides in the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde, which is catalyzed by a base. This reaction can, in fact, further evolve towards the formation of undesired insoluble invaluable polymers [10–16]. Looking for a route to solve these drawbacks, in 2016, after their pioneering work with ruthenium phosphine catalysts,[17] Wass et al. coined the idea of “Guerbet renewed” from a new perspective: homogeneous catalysis [18]. Indeed, homogeneous approaches for ethanol homologation to 1-butanol and higher alcohols employ iridium, ruthenium and manganese bifunctional catalysts which require milder reaction conditions and showed a larger control on yields and selectivity in comparison to heterogeneous catalysis [19–23]. First drawbacks for the still most efficient ruthenium complexes were highlighted by Wass et al. in 2013[17] and confirmed by Szymczak group [24] as the inverse correlation between butanol yield and selectivity. With a tandem catalytic approach involving iridium, copper or nickel complexes, Jones and co-workers were later able to keep a 99% butanol selectivity up to 37% yield [25]. At the same time, by employing a ruthenium catalyst with a tridentate ligand, Milstein group extended the homogeneous Guerbet reaction concept to the co-valorization of higher alcohols, such as hexanol C6 and octanol C8 [26].The current interest in this reaction and its drawbacks have also been nicely documented by Liauw and co-workers, who deeply analyzed the reason for the failure in alcohol homologation of a good candidate such as the bifunctional catalyst Ru-MACHO-BH [27]. Exploring real matrix derived feedstocks, Wass and co-workers lately demonstrated some water tolerance in a nice transformation of fermentation broths (first-generation biomass) into iso-butanol [28]. Furthermore, we recently reported a phosphine-free ionic ruthenium cyclopentadienone complex for the production of second-generation biofuels from wine waste derived bio-ethanol [29]. Although the reaction would well fit in a contest of circular economy in the wine production chain, LCA (life cycle assessment) and engineering assessments suggested that the process needs to be improved in terms of efficiency to become suitable for industrial application. With this aim in mind, our focus is here devoted to deepen the reactivity of anionic ruthenium complexes by changing the counterion, thus investigating the role of the imidazolium salts. While trying to solve this latter problem by implementing the catalytic system with a benzoquinone as a co-catalyst, an impressive boost in conversion and alcohol yields was obtained. The new system reaches the most promising performances in terms of EtOH conversion and alcohols yield reported so far."

7,General procedure for upgrading of EtOH with co-catalyst,"2.6 General procedure for upgrading of EtOH with co-catalyst Each catalytic run was carried out in an oven-dried 6 mL Schlenk bomb fitted with a Teflon plug valve. The reactor was loaded with the ruthenium catalyst 3a (0.0172 mmol), the base (NaOEt or NaOMe or NaOH, 1.72 mmol) and the co-catalyst (BQ-OMe or BQ). Finally, ethanol (0.500 mL, 8.60 mmol) was added under inert atmosphere. The Schlenk bomb was sealed under inert atmosphere and heated at 150 °C, unless otherwise specified, under magnetic stirring for the suitable reaction time. After cooling with an ice-water bath, the microreactor was opened and the reaction mixture was diluted by 4.5 mL of Et2O. THF (150 uL) was added as internal standard. Ethanol conversion and product yields were determined by injecting the resulting solution (0.5 uL) into an Agilent Technologies 7890A GC system using a HP-5 capillary column Agilent 190915–413 (30 m × 0.35 mm, thickness 0.25 μm). Helium was used as carrier gas with a column flow of 0.909 mL/min; the injector was kept at a temperature of 230 °C in split mode (40:1); total flow was 40.25 mL/min. The method used was: starting oven temperature 30 °C (hold for 11 min), ramp to 270 at 30 °C/min (hold for 5 min). All products were calibrated. THF (150 μL) was added to different solutions of alcohols at increasing concentration and the ratio Aa/As vs mola was plotted (mols = constant). This way the measure of the total reaction volume can be avoided. Compounds were also identified by GC–MS, using an Agilent Technologies 6890 GC coupled with a mass spectrometer Agilent Technologies 5973 equipped with a non-polar column (5% Phenyl − 95% methylsiloxane), 30 m × 250 μm × 1.05 μm. The volume of solution injected was 0.5 μL. Helium was used as carrier gas with a column flow rate of 1 mL/min; the injector was maintained at a temperature of 250 °C in split mode (50:1); total flow was 23.9 mL/min. The temperature program was the following: isothermal step at 40 °C for 7 min, then ramp to 250 °C at 10 °C/min, final isothermal step for 5 min. Light compounds were studied by sampling the headspace of the reactor at room temperature. A portion of gas phase (0.5 mL) was injected into the aforementioned GC–MS system and analyzed using the following temperature program: isothermal step at 40 °C (hold for 10 min), then ramp to 220 °C at 10 °C/min, final isothermal step for 2 min. Hydrogen was detected by means of an Agilent Technologies 7890A GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a HP-molesieve column (30 m × 0,53 mm × 50 μm). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 3 mL/min; the injector was maintained in split mode 5:1 at a temperature of 150 °C and the TCD at 150 °C. The volume of gas injected was 0.04 mL and the standard temperature program was a single isothermal step at 50 °C for 5 min. The injection of pure reference standards allowed the comparison of retention times in the GC and GC–MS columns. 2.6.1 Recycle experiment An oven-dried 6 mL Schlenk bomb fitted with a Teflon plug valve was loaded with the ruthenium catalyst 3a (0.0172 mmol), NaOEt (1.72 mmol) and BQ (0.129 mmol). Ethanol (0.500 mL, 8.60 mmol) was added under inert atmosphere and the reactor was sealed. The resulting reaction mixture was heated, under stirring, at 150 °C for 4 h. After cooling at room temperature, the alcohol mixture was removed under vacuum. Finally, new aliquots of EtOH (0.500 mL, 8.60 mmol), NaOEt (1.72 mmol) and BQ (0.129 mmol) where appropriate were added under inert atmosphere to the solid residue and the following cycle was carried out as previously outlined."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Screening of ruthenium-based ionic pre-catalysts,"3.1 Screening of ruthenium-based ionic pre-catalysts A small library of pre-catalysts was prepared by exploiting the reactivity of variously functionalized imidazolium salts (1b,c) with the dinuclear complex (η4-3,4-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,5-diphenylcyclopenta-2,4-dienone) (2) previously reported by the group (Scheme 1 ),[29,31] with the principal aim to assess a possible role of the imidazolium cation in the catalytic reaction for 3a-3c (vide infra). Furthermore, 2 was reacted with tetraethylammonium (TEA) iodide leading to the quantitative formation of 3d. The synthesis of 3b–d can be easily monitored by IR spectroscopy, observing in all the cases a lowering in the CO stretching frequencies (e.g. 3b: ν(CO) = 2000, 1940 cm−1 vs. 2: 2018, 1967 cm−1) with respect to 2. IR spectra of ion pairs 3c and 3d are very similar to that of complex 3b. The lower stretching frequency suggests the negative charge is more localized on the metal center rather than on the cyclopentadienone ligand carbonyl group. DFT analysis based on natural atomic charges [32] supports this picture, showing a larger increase of negative charge on Ru than on the cyclopentadienone oxygen when comparing 3a (considering both the isolated anion species and the tight ion pair) with the neutral dimer 2 (see Table S1). The ƞ4coordination of the cyclopentadienone ring is thus reasonable, and the negative charge on the metal ion together with the ϭ-donor nature of the halogen ion allow more back-bonding toward the CO ligands. This observation is confirmed by the C = O distance in the X-ray diffraction of single crystals obtained for the complex 3a (1.242(7) Å). Despite the 3a negative charge not being largely accumulated on the cyclopentadienone, the solid state structure of 3a (Fig. 1 ) comprising [{2,5-Ph2-3,4-(p-MeO-C6H4)2(η4-C4C = O)}Ru(CO)2I]– complex anions and imidazolium [1,3-Me2-C3N2H3]+ cations, shows an inter-molecular C41-H1···O3 (C41-H41 0.93 Å, H41···O3 2.16 Å, C41···O3 2.958(10) Å, <C41H41O3 143.1°) hydrogen bond. The molecular structures of the cation and anion closely resemble those previously reported for related salts [31]. The presence of the same inter-molecular C41-H1···O3 interaction also in ethanol solution is supported by DFT computations, with even stronger hydrogen bond (C41-H41 1.09 Å, H41···O3 1.86 Å, C41···O3 2.85 Å and < C41H41O3 147.3°) and with the imidazolium and the coordinated iodide lying closer than in the crystal (see Figure. S1). The ƞ4 coordination of the cyclopentadienone ligand is corroborated by the fact that the Ru1-C3 distance [2.499(7) Å] is sensibly longer than in Ru1-C4 [2.245(7) Å], Ru1-C5 [2.201(7) Å], Ru1-C6 [2.202(6) Å] and Ru1-C7 [2.250(6) Å], with similar differences obtained by DFT computations (ca. 0.26 Å, in average), confirming the same (ƞ4) coordination in ethanol solution. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra show the typical pattern of the starting reagents moved to different chemical shifts. A more significant indication of the structure reported in Scheme 1 is given by ESI-MS analyses, which show the molecular anion [Ru(CO)2{C5(C6H4OMe)2(Ph)2 = O}(X)]- and the corresponding molecular cation. (See experimental). Pre-catalysts 3b-d have been tested in the Guerbet reaction (Table 1 ) under the best performing conditions previously optimized for 3a (entry 1) [29]. Pre-catalyst 3b, bearing a methyl group on the –NCN- carbon of the imidazolium ring, leads to a ca. 19% decrease in ethanol conversion (27%, 3b, entry 2 vs 46%, 3a, entry 1) with a concomitant decline in alcohols’ selectivity (3b, 70%, vs 3a, 91%). Regarding 3c, it is noticeable how the presence of bulky substituents on the heteroatoms affects the catalytic activity. In particular, a high drop in conversion is observed (entry 3: from 46% for 3a to 17% for 3c). Analogously, by replacing the imidazolium salt with a non-protic counterion such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) 3d (entry 4), an impressive drop in alcohols yield together with a substantial increase in the carbon loss are observed. This overall evidence preliminarily suggest a role of the imidazolium salt. It is important to underline that the role of basic media in the Guerbet reaction is likely to prevent the formation of the mononuclear active species [Ru(CO)2{C5(C6H4OMe)2(Ph)2-OH}(H)] responsible for the H-transfer mechanism in several reactions where Shvo type pre-catalysts are employed [33–40]. Indeed, by refluxing the Shvo complex 4(H) with EtONa in EtOH for 1 h (Scheme 2 ), the dimeric complex 4(Na) is quantitatively formed, in which the acidic hydrogen is replaced by a sodium cation. In fact, the IR spectrum of 4(Na) shows three bands in the CO region which are shifted to lower frequencies compared to 4(H) (4(Na): ν(CO) = 2021, 1991, 1951 cm−1 vs. 4(H): 2036, 2005, 1977 cm−1) suggesting a similar molecular symmetry. Notably, DFT geometry optimization confirmed the structural stability of 4(Na) and the corresponding simulated IR spectra reproduced the red shifts of CO vibrations with respect to 4(H) (see Table S2 in the SI). Furthermore, 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of a bridging hydride at δ −16,1 ppm and ESI-MS shows the molecular ion at m/z = 1229 [M + H+] (see experimental and SI for further characterization). As recently reported by our group, Shvo pre-catalyst 4(H), which is likely to convert on the pre-catalyst 4(Na) under Guerbet conditions, works by far worse (Shvo – conv EtOH: 17%; C loss: 10%) than 3a (entry 1, table 1) [29] further suggesting a possible role of the imidazolium salt in the catalytic cycle. Great research effort has been devoted to the rationalization of the pKa of imidazolium salts vs substituents, both from an experimental [41] and a theoretical point of view [42,43]. In general, most values are available in DMSO or water solution and define that imidazolium salts with aromatic substituents have lower pKa than alkyl substituted ones. Furthermore, it is generally recognized that counterions do not affect the acidity of the –NCHN- proton. Thus, we can expect that the imidazolium salt in precursor 3c will be more acidic than in precursor 3a. On the other hand, pKa values of imidazolium salts (pKa ∼ 20–23) are generally higher than that of EtOH (pKa ∼ 16). On these premises, it is reasonable to affirm that in EtOH solution NaOEt would form a buffer system with the solvent rather than deprotonating the heterocyclic compound. By excluding the classic Shvo complex as a precursor and considering a possible role of the imidazolium salt, which is likely to remain protonated, a simplified catalytic cycle can be drawn as in scheme 3 (path A). Imidazolium salts are particularly prone to form hydrogen bonding with polar solvents, especially when containing an acidic proton on the –NCN- carbon as in 3a and 3c [44–46]. Although we could speculate about several interactions between the cation, the anion or the ionic couple in the reaction mixture, a complete interpretation of the effect of any possible interaction on the catalytic system’ behavior is not trivial due to the intrinsic complexity. Still, DFT computations provided information on the structural stability of the tight ion pairs of 3a and 3c in solution, along with their corresponding hydride species, 3a-H and 3c-H (Fig. 2 ). In fact, as described above for 3a, the anionic species interact closely with the imidazolium proton in a H-bond fashion, and this happens also if the cation comprises encumbered aromatic N-substituents, as in 3c. Notably, this interaction also exists (and it is even stronger) in the optimized geometries of the hydride species 3a-H and 3c-H, suggesting that formation of tight ion-pairs is promoted not only by electrostatics but also by specific H-bond interactions, overcoming steric hindrances of imidazolium cations. Although a hydride species was detected via 1H NMR (δ = -9.86 ppm) and IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a new set of IR bands in the CO region (υ(CO) = 1984, 1916 cm−1) when employing 3a as catalyst, the resting state was difficult to completely characterize experimentally due to the complexity and instability of the reaction mixture. To further confirm the structure of the hypothesized intermediate 3a-H, a stable hydride ionic couple 3c-H was isolated by reacting the corresponding carbene in EtOH with the ruthenium dimer 2 (Scheme 4 ). 1H NMR experiments revealed both the –NCHN– proton (δ 8.78 ppm corresponding to the –NCHN– signal at δ 135 ppm in 13C NMR) [29,31] of the imidazolium salt and the terminal Ru-hydride (δ (CDCl3) = -9,94 ppm) at typical chemical shifts (see also experimental and SI). Once again, the two CO stretches were found at lower frequencies in comparison to 3c (3c-H: υ(CO) = 1976, 1909 cm−1 vs 3c: υ(CO) = 2000, 1937 cm−1). DFT simulated IR spectra confirmed these red-shifts associated with hydrides formation as shown in Table S3 in the SI. Such evidence agrees with the higher σ-donor ability of the hydride ion compared to the chloride ligand. ESI-MS confirmed the presence of both the anionic molecular ion at 603 m/z and the molecular cation at 389 m/z. In addition, by performing the Guerbet reaction with complex 3c-H (cat 0.2 mol%, 150 °C, NaOEt = 20 mol%, 4 h), the detrimental effect of the encumbered N-substituted imidazolium salt is confirmed [conv EtOH = 16%, yield BuOH = 8%, alcohol yield = 12%, carbon loss = 5%]. Having all the above described information in our hands, we can preliminarily draft a role of hydrogen bond on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity of 3a-H and 3c-H. From an electronic point of view, the stronger the hydrogen bond (3aH 1.90 Å vs 3cH 2.03 Å, Fig. 2), the higher the CO stretching (3a-H = 1984, 1916 cm−1 and 3c-H = 1976, 1909 cm−1) which decreases increasing backbonding. In line with this notion 3a-H shows an higher hydride donor ability (see Table S1), which should accelerate reduction [34] and conversely decelerate the dehydrogenation step. This behaviour may affect the production rate of acetaldehyde, likely favouring the equilibria between dehydrogenation, aldol condensation and hydrogenation in the Guerbet reaction (assuming that the faster is the dehydrogenation, the higher should be the acetaldehyde which converts to C-loss before condensation). Noteworthy, GC analyses provided evidence for a significant content of molecular hydrogen in the final headspace of the reaction vessel (Fig. 3 ). This suggests an important contribution of the parallel hydrogen evolution reaction (Scheme 1, path B). Except for 3c, which is poorly active in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, hydrogen evolution is likely similar for all the other counter-cations. As previously reported,[29] acetaldehyde is also identified in the gas phase in traces. Concerning the H2 evolution, it is important to underline that if it derived from the dehydrogenation of the only ethanol, the H2 percentage should be lower than C-loss in Table 1. This incongruence can be explained taking into consideration hydrogen that could come from the co-catalyst NaOEt in the presence of water from condensation. This can be accounted separately by the ethanol carbon balance, in a parasite reaction that consumes the base co-catalyst, namely NaOEt + H2O that leads to NaOAc + 2H2. This appears to be also promoted by 3a-3d (dehydrogenation catalysts) as reported by Beller and co-workers for ruthenium pincer catalysts exploited for H2 production from EtOH in water under basic (OH–) conditions [47]."
10,Boosting the Guerbet reaction with benzoquinone as co-catalyst,"3.2 Boosting the Guerbet reaction with benzoquinone as co-catalyst Taking inspiration from the biomimetic aerobic alcohol oxidations developed by Backvall and co-workers with a coupled Shvo/Co-salen catalytic system[48,49] and with the principal aim to gain better control on the hydrogen evolution step, we decided to augment our catalytic system by adding an electron transfer mediator, such as 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (BQ-OMe), as a co-catalyst (1.5 mol%). To our delight, no H2 release was observed at the end of the reaction. Furthermore, a significant boost in the overall reaction efficiency was registered (Table 2 ). For 3a (entry 1 in Table 1 vs entry 2 in Table 2) a gain of 19% in alcohols yield is observed. Selectivity in butanol shows a slight decline (70% for 3a, vs 52% for 3a/BQ-OMe), but the decrease in total higher alcohols selectivity is less pronounced (91% for 3a vs 85% for 3a/BQ-OMe), suggesting that the co-catalyst favors the production of higher alcohols rather than butanol, as expected at higher conversion. Although a carbon loss of 7–13% is affecting the final mixtures, the efficiency of the catalytic system is overall enlarged and dehydrogenation toward H2 production (path B in Scheme 3) is completely avoided. Increasing the reaction time (Table 2, entry 3) did not lead to any improvement. 3.2.1 Screening of the reaction conditions Screening of the reaction temperatures confirmed the behavior observed in the absence of a co-catalyst [29]. Lowering the temperature (entry 1 in Table 3 ) to 80 °C led to a turn-off of the Guerbet process, with almost all converted ethanol contributing to the carbon loss. At an intermediate temperature of 110 °C (entry 2), the overall conversion is still low and the carbon loss is around half of the conversion. In the same way, an increase in the operative temperature (180 °C, entry 4) revealed a detrimental effect, thus prompting us to choose 150 °C (entry 3) as the temperature for the new catalytic system as well. Other pre catalysts such as 3b showed a very limited improvement of the conversion and alcohol yield (Table 4 , entry 1 vs Table 1, entry 2) along with a furtherly increased carbon loss. On the other hand, the behavior of the Shvo catalyst 4(H) seems to be completely unaffected by the co-catalyst (Table 4, entry 2) Analyzing the data in Fig. 4 , the upgrade in conversion and alcohol yields upon BQ-OMe addition (ruthenium catalyst 3a) can be transferred to other bases such as NaOMe and NaOH (conversion: +26% with NaOEt, +18% with NaOMe, +36% with NaOH) (C4-C10 yields: +19% with NaOEt, +12% with NaOMe, +27% with NaOH). NaOMe, as expected, entered the reaction favoring the production of odd alcohols, and in general this species negatively affects the carbon balance favoring the production of heavy species. [29] Nevertheless NaOH improves the conversion, leading to a concurrent increase of the carbon loss. In order to further comment on this latter data, it has to be firstly stated that the primary side process that affects the homogeneous Guerbet process is the Cannizzaro reaction, which turns off the reaction by converting the co-catalytic base NaOEt in sodium acetate. This is also the case for 3a/BQ-OMe system. Indeed, by collecting, weighting and analyzing by 1H NMR the water soluble fraction of the solid at the end of the catalytic run (reaction conditions: 3a: 0.2 mol%; NaOEt: 20 mol%; BQ-OMe: 1.5 mol%; T: 150 °C; t: 4 h, Table 2, entry 2), the only presence of sodium acetate and sodium butanoate in a 1:10 ratio was detected (see figure S22 in the SI). Being the weight of the solid 0.144 g (corresponding to 1.70 mmol in acetates) and the amount of NaOEt employed 1.72 mmol, it is reasonable to state that the base is quantitatively converted into acetates. This is consistent with the Cannizzaro reaction that affects the Guerbet process, leading to the base co-catalyst consumption. Thus, this part of the solid, which represents the quantitative transformation of the base co-catalyst, can be considered apart from the ethanol carbon balance, namely from the C-loss reported in Tables, which refers independently to the starting material ethanol (8.3 mmol). This assumption has been followed in all the literature available for homogeneous Guerbet catalytic reactions where this aspect is discussed.[24–29] Finally, the carbon loss attributable to ethanol conversion could be ascribable to oligomerization of aldehydes to heavy insoluble products and to unsaturated intermediates hardly detectable from the GC and GC–MS analyses. On the other hand, NaOH under the conditions in Fig. 4 converts the 20% of the feedstock (8.3 mmol of EtOH) into NaOEt and water in order to have the substrate available for the Cannizzaro reaction. This behavior is finally affecting the conversion and carbon loss from ethanol which increase by 20%. However, taking into account that NaOH has some advantages respect to NaOEt, the overall efficiency of this base in the presence of BQ-OMe is anyway remarkable. Quite surprisingly, GC–MS analyses of the final reaction mixture revealed the presence of odd alcohols even when bases different from NaOMe were employed (Figure S23). Actually, BQ-OMe under the reaction condition can be expected to lose -OMe moieties,[50] which later enter themselves in the catalytic cycle. To avoid this co-catalyst reactivity and to check the influence of electron-withdrawal on the co-catalyst, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) and 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) were subsequently tested. As expected, no trace of odd-alcohol was detected. While electron-withdrawing groups negatively affect the conversion, (Table 5 , entry 2), nice performances were registered when using unsubstituted benzoquinone (Table 5, entry 1). Table 6 displays screenings of 3a/BQ system at different reaction times. By comparing Table 2 with Table 6, although at a first sight BQ (Table 6, entry 2, C-loss 16%) has a detrimental effect on the reaction selectivity with respect to BQ-OMe (Table 2, entry 2, C-loss 11%), increasing the reaction time reduces the carbon loss (Table 6, entry 3, selectivity in C4-C10 = 96%). This is likely to be attributed to the presence of unreacted intermediates after 4 h with 1.5% of BQ, requiring a longer reaction time to be completely converted into valuable alcohols. This latter behavior is not registered for BQ-OMe (Table 2) which decreased in performance over time, actually making BQ an even better candidate for our purposes. Noteworthy, the latter data makes 3a/BQ system the best result ever reported for the Guerbet reaction. [26,51] Screenings on the loading of BQ unveil that increasing the amount (Table 7 , entry 3 and 4) does not improve the overall efficiency. On the contrary although leading to a lower conversion (68%), decreasing the BQ loading to 0.5% (Table 7, entry 1) leads to a negligible carbon loss after 4 h. (Table 7, entry 2). Halving the loading of the catalyst 3a to 0.1 mol% does not affect the catalytic activity (Table 8 ). However, a lower efficiency is obtained with 0.02 mol% of 3a. The best TON of 670 is reached with 3a (0.1 mol%) / BQ (0.5 mol%) (entry 1). Even more outstanding results were finally obtained by changing the base loading. Since doubling the base percentage without the use of an additive represented a detriment in selectivity (conv. 75%, carbon loss 21%),[29] 3a/BQ system was tested with 40% of NaOEt (Fig. 5 ). This time, the overall conversion shows a further 5% increase and selectivity is almost completely directed toward butanol and higher alcohols already after 4 h (Fig. 5, b). Increasing the reaction time up to 8 h (Fig. 5, c) improves the conversion to 88%, with an overall selectivity in higher alcohols (C4-C10) of 97% (Fig. 5, c), the highest obtained up to date. 3.2.2 Reactivity of 3a/BQ system toward real matrixes The negative effect of water on selectivity with 3a alone [29] is also prevented in the presence of the additive BQ. By diluting EtOH with 30% of H2O under the conditions of Table 7 (entry 2) led to a conversion of 59% associated to yield in C4-C10 alcohols of 58% (yield 1-BuOH = 38%). Eventually, the behavior of the optimized catalytic system 3a/BQ was studied towards real matrixes, more specifically two waste mixtures containing EtOH and by-products (Table 9 ). The first one, being absolute alcohol (entry 2), showed yield in alcohols comparable to pure EtOH supplied by Merck, while the use of EtOH CAVIRO 95% (entry 3), a waste sample deriving from heads and tails of ethanol distillation, provided a satisfactory behavior, in line with the experiment above described with EtOH/H2O. Noteworthy, the presence of several by-products in the CAVIRO 95% sample (see Table 9 and S4 for mixture composition) makes it useless for any other purposes but incineration. Noticeably, not only do such by-products not largely affect the catalytic system activity toward the bio-refinery process, but indeed, as in the case of aldehydes, they take part in mixture valorization being themselves intermediates in the Guerbet reaction. 3.2.3 Proposed catalytic cycle Summarizing the information obtained from the screening of 3a/BQ system, a synergic role of 3a and BQ in the process can be depicted. A possible role of BQ as a catalytic “hydrogen storage” agent is also likely. Furthermore, the acidity of hydroquinone is higher than that of EtOH, thus we can expect at least a partial deprotonation toward its basic form. From this information, we can draw a plausible simplified catalytic cycle as reported in Scheme 5 . Benzoquinone is likely to enter the catalytic cycle in the oxidation of 3a-H assisted by a molecule of EtOH. Later on, hydroquinone (in equilibrium with its deprotonated counterpart) would be prone to undergo re-oxidation by the 16 electrons intermediate represented with a vacant site and by the base (EtO-). At this point, 3a-H is restored and available for the hydrogenation of aldehydes after aldol condensation, thus closing the catalytic cycle. 3.2.4 Catalytic system 3a/BQ recycling Two recycle experiments were performed: the first one (light blue bar in Fig. 6 ) was carried out by removing the alcohol mixture under vacuum at the end of the first cycle, re-loading a new portion of EtOH and NaOEt to the reaction vessel and then reacting again at 150 °C for 4 h. This way, the catalytic system 3a/BQ can be recycled with good efficiency. Contrarily, the re-addition of fresh BQ to the dry mixture negatively affects the recycle (orange bar in Fig. 6). This latter behavior agrees with results obtained from the screening of the BQ loading (Table 7). The conversion of the catalytic system is indeed negatively affected by the increase of the BQ percentage, further confirming that BQ (1.5 % mol) is not deactivated under the reaction conditions employed. The catalytic system 3a/BQ does not deactivate with the reaction: working with a TON of 315 (under conditions of Fig. 6) within the first cycle, it maintains a TON of 265 when reused. This behavior further confirms the base responsibility in the reaction switch off by means of the Cannizzaro reaction as reported for complex 3a.[29]"
11,Conclusions,"Reactivity, supported by DFT calculations, of ionic ruthenium catalysts 3a-3d and dimeric complexes 4(H) and 4(Na) highlights a participation of the imidazolium counterion, 1,3-dimethylimidazolium giving the best performance, in the Guerbet reaction efficiency. Furthermore DFT computations provide information on the formation of tight ion-pairs for 3a and 3c promoted not only by electrostatics but also by specific H-bond interactions in solution. Interactions that become even stronger for their corresponding hydride species 3a-H and 3c-H. The screening of different counterions also sheds light on the parallel hydrogen evolution which subtracts substrate from the Guerbet reaction mechanism. The reaction scheme includes the dehydrogenation of ethanol into acetaldehyde (the only reaction occurring on ethanol with our catalytic system, neither ethylene nor diethylether were detected), and the transformation of the aldehyde into either 1-butanol or higher saturated alcohols, with consumption of the hydrogen generated in the first step. The C-loss and the positive hydrogen yield, found especially in the absence of the benzoquinone co-catalyst, were mainly due to side reactions occurring on acetaldehyde, such as the Cannizzaro and oligomerization. The addition of a catalytic amount of a benzoquinone derivative (1,4-benzoquinone being the most efficient) to the reaction mixture (catalytic system 3a/BQ) gives an impressive boost to the reaction, solving several drawbacks. The first and most important one is to delete hydrogen evolution, which is completely avoided. The hydrogen cost thus becomes null as in an ideal Guerbet reaction. In fact, all the hydrogen coming from ethanol dehydrogenation is restored in the last step, hydrogenation of aldehydes, likely passing through the benzoquinone/hydroquinone as a “storage” system during aldol condensation. The reaction occurs without additional solvent (another good deal for atom economy) in the presence of an inorganic base as a condensation co-catalyst leading to unprecedented conversions and yields with very high selectivity: maximum conversion of 88% associated to alcohols yield of 85% and an overall selectivity in higher alcohols of 97%. The reaction is barely affected by the presence of water and 3a/BQ system shows a greater water tolerance if compared with 3a. From an industrial application perspective, the cooperative 3a/BQ catalytic process can be transferred to a real matrix. In fact, when employing heads and tails from ethanol distillation (supplier: CAVIRO distillery) no significant change in the composition of the final reaction mixture is observed. Employing bio-ethanol from waste in the process would represent a closing step in the circular economy of wine and distillates production chain. Apart from few drawbacks in the recycling phase which are currently under investigation, 3a/BQ catalytic system paves the way for the development of a sustainable process answering to the current topic of second-generation biofuel production."
