0,Introduction,"With the alarming rise in global energy consumption, there is an urgent need to replace fossil fuels with renewable and sustainable energy sources [1]. Therefore, the attention of the research community has centered on the abundant reserve of clean and renewable biomass [2]. As a raw source, biomass is subjected to the biomass-to-liquid process for conversion into liquid fuels known as bio-oils [3]. The setback with bio-oils, however, is that they contain high amounts of water and oxygen element, highly viscous and corrosive, and have low calorific value. Thus, they require upgrading to overcome such disadvantages and make them applicable as a fuel of existing engines. One effective and widely employed method for improving the quality and stability of bio-oils is hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading technology [4]. High-purity hydrogen has been often used as the hydrogen source for the HDO of bio-oil or various simulated compounds [5,6]. Nonetheless, the high combustion risk and the costly hydrogen production, makes hydrogen unconducive as a source for large-scale application of the HDO technology [7]. A strategy of adding an organic solvent to the bio-oil during the HDO reaction has been introduced in previous research [8,9]. Especially, a series of hydrogen-donating reactions have been investigated to determine the role of hydrogen donors (tetralin, isopropanol, glycerol, and formic acid) in lignin/microalgae, concluding that hydrogen donors have a significant effect on product distribution [10,11]. Zhang et al. studied the transfer hydrogenation of phenol over supported Pd catalysts with formic acid as the hydrogen donor. They obtained the highest phenol conversion of 65.6%, with almost all the converted phenol being turned into cyclohexanone [12]. Xiang et al. achieved 18.1%–53.1% conversion of phenol and up to 96.1% selectivity of cyclohexanone through the hydrogenation of phenol with methanol or ethanol, over Raney Ni or Pd/Al2O3 catalyst [13]. In certain conditions, the solvent can react as a co-reactant of bio-oil [14]. These studies provide another route for hydrogen donors for catalytic HDO of bio-oils. However, a large number of studies on hydrogen donors mainly use a one-pot method, which is difficult to achieve continuous production. Studies on gas phase hydrodeoxygenation of hydrogen donors have rarely been found. And little is known about the interaction between the reactants and the hydrogen donor. The continuous HDO reactor under gas-phase conditions is more in line with industrial production requirements. Isopropanol is selected as a hydrogen donor for HDO of guaiacol under the gas phase, and isopropanol has been proven to have excellent hydrogen supply capacity [15]. In industrial applications, the transport and safety performance of isopropanol is higher than pure hydrogen. At present, biomass pyrolysis oil is treated as dangerous waste materials. It costs $600/t to treated it and there are serious environmental problems. However, biomass pyrolysis oil is a raw material with a high C，H content, which can be used as a raw material to be converted into a chemical. The current international cost of benzene, toluene, and xylene raw materials is $615/t, $645/t and $670/t, respectively. Therefore, BTX prepared by continuous HDO of biomass pyrolysis oil under hydrogen donor conditions has high economic and environmental benefits. Phenols are the main oxygenates in biomass pyrolysis oils and also one of the main causes of bio-oil instability [16]. Due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups, phenols are most difficult to convert in the biohydrogenation process. In the biohydrogen hydrodeoxygenation process, the conversion of phenolic hydroxyl groups is critical. Therefore, guaiacol was selected as a model compound in this manuscript. The in-situ continue HDO of real bio-oil into a BTX and hydrocarbon is promising, compared with the one-pot method. Especially, studies on gas phase hydrodeoxygenation of hydrogen donors have rarely been found, and little literature is known to the interaction between the reaction of the substrate with the hydrogen donor. The effect of dual carriers on in situ HDO of guaiacol was discussed in this manuscript. And isopropanol was selected as a hydrogen donor, and a series of catalysts were prepared to study the mechanism of guaiacol HDO. The hydrodeoxygenation reaction characteristics of real bio-oil under the condition of hydrogen donor were described, which can provide scientific basis for high-quality utilization of bio-oil. Effect of hydrogen donor isopropanol on guaiacol HDO was discussed. Furthermore, the physicochemical characteristics of the liquid-phase products of the catalyst and hydrogen donor were compared and analyzed, the role of hydrogen donors in the HDO of guaiacol was investigated, and the possible reaction mechanisms were discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental materials,"2.1 Experimental materials Lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (AR, 99.0%), isopropanol(AR,≥99.5%), and guaiacol(GC,＞99.0%) utilized in the experiments were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (AR, 98.0%) and copper (II) nitrate hydrate(AR) compounds were purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory. HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 54) and SBA-15 were bought from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts Firstly, the zeolite carriers were calcined at 550 °C for 180 min, using a blank HZSM-5 for comparison. The active metals were loaded onto zeolites through step-by-step wet impregnation. Next, HZSM-5 was dipped in nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate aqueous solution, stirred for 0.5 h at 60 °C. Subsequently, the mixture stood for 24 h. The mixed solution was dried at 100 °C for 24 h, before calcination at 550 °C for 300 min. The Ni/HZSM-5 precursors were obtained. Accordingly, HZSM-5 was dipped in lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate aqueous solution, standing for 24 h. The mixture was then dried at 100 °C for 24 h and roasted at 550 °C for 300 min. Subsequently, HSZM-5&La was loaded with reactive metal nickel, and calcined at 550 °C for 300 min. The Ni/HZSM-5&La precursors were obtained. The Ni/HZSM-5&La precursor was dipped in copper (II) nitrate hydrate aqueous solution. With the same procedure as above, the Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La precursors were obtained. During the process, Ni, Cu, and La content should be ensured at 15%, 5%, and 6%, respectively [17,18], based on the mass of support. They were reduced at 500 °C for 2 h in the 90%N2/10%H2. The mixed carrier catalyst was prepared in the same method as described, but with 80%SBA-15/20%HZSM-5 replaced over HZSM-5. Consequently, Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 and Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&SBA-15 catalysts were obtained."
4,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the catalysts The specific surface area and pore structure of the catalyst were determined by Micromeritics' ASAP 2460 physical adsorption instrument. The sample was degassed at 250 °C for 8 h before the test. After the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the sample was obtained, the specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) formula, and the pore size and pore volume were calculated using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. The phase structure of the fresh catalysts was measured by Rigaku-Ultima IV 40 KV 40-mA X-ray diffractometer of Nippon Ryokan Co., Ltd. The test conditions were as follows: Cu target Kα ray (λ = 0.154 nm); tube flow, 30 mA; tube pressure, 40 kV. The data acquisition step was 0.02°, the scanning speed was 4°/min, and the scanning range was 5.00°–80.00°. The liquid-phase product obtained by the reaction was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using a 7890B-5977A gas chromatography-mass spectrometer manufactured (GC-MS) from American Agilent. Ether was used as the diluent solvent. H2-TPR patterns were performed on the Chembet 3000 chemical adsorption instrument (Quantachrome Corporation). Before the TPR test, the catalyst was pretreated by the flowing high-purity N2 stream at 150 °C for 60 min, given the heating rate of 10 °C/min. After pretreatment of the catalyst, it was adsorbed at flowing (25 ml/min) 5% H2 and 95% N2 mixed gas for 2 h. TPR analysis was performed within 30 °C–800 °C under the 10 °C/min heating rate. NH3-TPD test equipment was the same as for H2-TPR. Before the NH3-TPD test, the catalyst was pretreated by flowing high-purity He streams at 150 °C for 60 min under the same heating rate of 10 °C/min. After pretreatment of the catalyst, it was adsorbed at 10% anhydrous NH3 and N2 mixed gas at 30 °C with the flowing (50 ml/min) for 2 h and then switched at N2 at 30 °C for 1 h for removal of the NH3 of physical absorption. TPD analysis was from 30 °C to 750 °C under the heating rate of 10 °C/min. XPS analysis was performed on Thermo Scientific's Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer. The atomic percentage and chemical state of the elements on the surface of the catalyst samples were determined. The radiation source was AlKalph source with test energy of 1486.8 eV, test spot area of 500 μm, tube flow of 10 mA, and test tube pressure of 15 kV. Infrared spectroscopy was performed on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR Fourier transform infrared spectrometer from Thermo Scientific, USA. The surface morphology of the catalyst was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi-S4800 FESEM). The working voltage and resolution of the scanning electron microscope were 20 kV and 1.5 nm."
5,Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity analysis,"2.4 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity analysis A simplified diagram and introduction of the reactor has been shown in previous studies [19]. The experimental apparatus consisted of a fixed bed tube furnace and a stainless steel tube 10 mm in internal diameter. The pressure in the reaction tube was adjusted to 2 MPa. Guaiacol was continuously delivered to the reaction tube through a peristaltic pump. The mixture of guaiacol and the hydrogen donor (guaiacol: isopropanol = 1:30 M ratio) was vaporized in the vaporization chamber before placed into contact with a 4 g catalyst. The temperature of the gasifier was 220 °C. Feed rate was set to 0.064 g/min via adjustment of the peristaltic pump. The carrier gas (99.99% N2) flow rate was 350 ml/min. The temperature of the fixed bed was set to 350 °C. All reactions were carried out for 50 min，the weight hourly space velocity was 0.96 h−1. The product was cooled and collected under −10 °C. Studies on the optimal molar ratio of guaiacol to isopropanol have been added to support information. The distilled product was diluted according to a volume ratio of dichloromethane to a product of 10:1 and then detected by GC-MS [19]. Finally, the content of the liquid product was calculated based on the peak areas of GC-MS [20]."
6,Calculation formula,"2.5 Calculation formula The calculation formula of each parameter was as follows [21]: (1) Y i e l d ( % ) = m p m f × 100 % where m p is the quality of the product being collected, and m f represents the quality of pumped guaiacol. (2) Conversion% = ( 1 − n 0 ) × 100 % where n 0 represents the relative content of untransformed guaiacol in the product. (3) Selectivity% = R ( s p ) ∑ R ( t p ) − n 0 × 100 % where R ( s p ) is the relative content of target products in liquid phase product, and ∑ R ( t p ) is the total content of collected liquid products. (4) X H D O % = ( 1 − 2 n 0 + ∑ n R j 200 ) × 100 % where R i is the relative content of unreacted guaiacol in the product, R j is the content of certain oxygenated compounds in the product, and n is the number of oxygen atoms in the corresponding oxygen compound. The catalysts for the guaiacol HDO experiment primarily produced H2 and CH4, so the gases were normalized. The gas relative content calculation formula was as follows (5) ∅ f ( % ) = n C H 4 n C H 4 + n H 2 × 100 % where n C H 4 is the relative content of CH4 in the gas phase product, and n H 2 is the relative content of H2 in the gas phase product."
7,Result and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The N2 adsorption-desorption curve of the catalyst samples were shown in Fig. 1 , while the specific pore structure parameters for the different catalysts were listed in Table 1 . Two different types of isotherm features could be seen from Fig. 1. The specific surface area of the HZSM-5 carrier was 374.17 m2/g and had discernible type-II isotherm characteristics. Deviation from the Y-axis of the adsorption potential curve in the micropore indicated that the force against N2 was weak [22]. The appearance of the H4-type hysteresis loop indicated that the catalysts were dominated by a layered structure. Although the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 showed the same curve type as the original carrier, the specific surface area of the catalyst decreased by 24.13%, which means that Ni addition did not change the basic distribution of the carrier channels, but may block these channels. When the metal La was used as an additive, the adsorption isotherm of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&La was rosed to the high-pressure region, along with the hysteresis loop changing from H4 to H3, which indicated that a new pore structure may appear. However, the new pore structure did not increase the specific surface area of the catalyst but decreased by 28.14%, which implied that the microporous structure inside the catalyst may be partially blocked due to accumulation of particles. Moreover, the addition of metal Cu weakens the influence caused by La, the specific surface area of Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La increases to 305.56 m2/g. It still showed type-II isotherms and H3 type hysteresis loops. Presumably, Cu promotes the dispersion of other metals and reduces the phenomenon of micropore clogging caused by particle packing [23]. When mesoporous zeolite SBA-15 was used as a co-carrier, the adsorption isotherm of Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 changed to type-V. Simultaneously, the hysteresis loop changed from type H4 to H1. Fundamentally, such a pattern was due to SBA-15 exhibiting stronger N2 adsorption capacity. Besides, the structural characteristics of the catalysts were consistent with previous reports of SBA-15 zeolite [22]. Further loading of Cu did not affect the catalyst structure significantly, but slightly reduced the specific surface area of the catalyst Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&SBA-15 to 366.04 m2/g, which may be due to blockage in some portions of the pore structure by the supported metal. In general, the effect of La on HZSM-5 zeolite was mainly due to the change of pore structure on the surface of the catalysts [24]. Additionally, the added Cu could promote metal dispersion and reduce the clogging of micropores by the metal particles [23]. When HZSM-5 was mixed with SBA-15, the specific surface area of the support was significantly increased [25]. The effect of SBA-15 was main reflected in the conversion of catalyst structure from micropores to mesopores with the specific surface area of the catalyst increasing. XRD patterns of the different catalysts before the reaction were displayed in Fig. 2 , and the grain sizes of the active metal Ni calculated by the Scherrer formula were specified in Table 1 [26]. The diffraction peak of elemental Ni (pdf card number 04-0850) occurred at 44.50° (111), 51.85° (200), and 76.37° (220). The bimetallic catalysts exhibited a diffraction peak of elemental Cu (pdf card number 04-0836) at 43.29° (111), 50.43° (200), and 74.13° (220). Indicatively, after the reduction stage, the active substances supported on the catalysts were all reduced to elemental metals. The diffraction peak of the zeolite HZSM-5 was also identified, which indicated that the structure of the zeolite had not been changed after the catalysts was prepared by impregnation, calcination and other preparation methods. However, it was worth noting that when SBA-15 was used as a co-support, the grain size of Ni was significantly reduced, which indicated that the abundant pore structure of SBA-15 was beneficial for the dispersion of active metal Ni [27]. The grain size of Ni was not directly affected by the addition of the co-carrier La. Nonetheless, the grain size of Ni was decrease from 44.5 nm to 23.1 nm after Cu added. This result also indicated that the loading of Cu exhibited a significant effect of promoting dispersion [28]. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks associated with the La species were not detected in the catalysts, which indicated that the La species may be well dispersed [29]. Fig. 3 shows the results of the characterization of the catalysts as observed via SEM. The blank HZSM-5 carrier behaves as a block particle with an edge size of approximately 510 nm. After the blank HZSM-5 was loaded with metal Ni, Ni was distributed on the surface of the catalyst in the size of 28.5–59.5 nm with no obvious aggregation phenomenon. The spherical particles on the surface of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&La were gradually enriched and appeared as a flat granular structure, which indicated that La promoted the aggregation of metal particles [30]. Although Cu addition did not change the shape of the metal, it promoted the dispersion of the surface-active metal of the catalyst Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La and reduced the possibility of pore blockage. When the mesoporous zeolite SBA-15 was used as a co-support, the main structure of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 exhibited a kind of strip structure, and the metal support was excellently dispersed on the surface of the carrier. Due to the rich pore structure of SBA-15, the metal could enter the mesoporous channel and attached to the active site inside the pore. Therefore, only a small amount of metal particles were distributed on the catalyst surface of Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 and Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&SBA-15. In the field of catalysis, TPR technology is mainly used for analyzing the interaction between metal oxides or between a metal oxide and a carrier during the reduction process of supported metal catalysts. Five catalysts, as described above, were characterized and analyzed with the obtained curve as shown in Fig. 4 . The differences in bonding strength between the metal oxide and the carrier were corresponded by different reduction temperatures of the metal oxide [31]. The precursor Ni/HZSM-5 exhibited two reduction peaks at 325.2 °C and 487.67 °C, respectively, which corresponded to the NiO bonding states on the carrier surface. The dispersed state of NiO exhibited lower reduction temperature, and the free state of NiO demonstrated the opposite case [23]. When La was used as a catalytic aid, the reduction peak of the precursor Ni/HZSM-5&La was concentrated at 405 °C, and a shoulder peak appeared at 429 °C, which indicated that La enhanced the binding of the active metals to the carrier [32]. After the addition of Cu, the reduction temperature of the NiO supported on the precursor Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La was concentrated at about 390 °C. This was because Cu caused the Ni species on the support to be converted into a free state, which reduced the reduction temperature of the nickel oxide. Meanwhile, the shoulder peak appeared at 285 °C was attributed to the reduction of Cu species, indicated that Cu weakened the bonding strength of Ni to the carrier [33]. When SBA-15 was added, the reduction peak of the nickel oxide of the precursor Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 was divided into two parts. After the addition of Cu, the reduction temperature of the precursor Ni–Cu/HZSM-5 & SBA-15 supported NiO was concentrated around 363 °C, which might be due to the fact that NiO was uniformly dispersed in the carrier, reducing the reduction temperature of nickel oxide. Moreover, it could be found by H2-TPR that the La-based dual-supported catalyst exhibited a stronger binding ability to the active metal. The SBA-15-based dual-supported catalyst exhibited better distribution, although the binding intensity between the carrier to the active metal may be weakened. The NH3-temperature-programmed desorption method (NH3-TPD) is widely used to determine the acid content and strength of solid catalysts [34]. Generally, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts can be obtained from the position and area of the desorption peak, respectively. The acidic site distribution of zeolite has been confirmed by Hari et al. [35]. The desorption peak of weak acid sites occurred in the low-temperature region (100°C–250 °C) and the medium-strong acid sites are in the medium-temperature region (250°C–450 °C). Moreover, the high-temperature region (450°C–600 °C) was attributed to the desorption of strongly acidic sites. The NH3-TPD curves for the five catalysts and the blank HZSM-5 zeolite support were shown in Fig. 5 , and Table 2 showd the corresponding acid amount ratios of the other catalysts relative to the blank HZSM-5. It was observed that the acidic sites of most of the catalysts were mainly medium-strong acid sites. Moreover, a typical characteristic desorption peak appeared on the blank HZSM-5 [36]. When the active metal Ni was supported, the total acid content of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 decreased sharply to 0.44, indicated that the acidic sites of the zeolite were covered by the supported elemental nickel. After La was loaded, the coverage of the acidic sites was alleviated, and the total acid content of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&La increased to 0.78, which might be a more uniform distribution of active metal nickel. The addition of Cu caused the medium-strong acid sites of the catalyst Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La to migrate to the low-temperature section. The addition of the co-supported SBA-15 resulted in the disappearance of the weakly acidic sites of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 & SBA-15 as they have increased from 385.4 °C (Ni/HZSM-5) to 452.53 °C. For the six samples, the acid ratio was ranked in the order HZSM-5>Ni/HZSM-5&La > Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&SBA-15 > Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 > Ni/HZSM-5>Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La. Therefore, acidity had a large effect on the activity of catalysts. Accordingly, XPS technology was employed for the study of the properties of catalyst surface species [37]. Fig. 6 showd the diffraction peak regions and positions of the different catalysts surface element Ni, while the diffraction peak positions of the metal promoters La and Cu were given in Table 3 . Moreover, diffraction peaks with electron binding energies of 852.0 and 870.0 eV could be assigned to Ni2P3/2 and Ni2P1/2 respectively, which were generated by Ni0 on the catalyst surface [38]. On the other hand, diffraction peaks around 855.0 and 872.0 eV could be attributed to NI2+ produced by NiO. The electron binding energy of the diffraction peak of the 2P3/2 region of Ni on different catalyst surfaces was greatly different, which was induced by the transfer of electrons from Ni and NiO. For the single-metal catalysts, Ni/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15, the electron binding energy shifted phenomenon caused by electron transfer was not discernible. More specifically, the diffraction peaks of elemental nickel 2P3/2 were 852.60 and 852.63 eV, respectively, which were identical from that obtained in a previous study for Ni0 (852.6 eV). After the addition of the additive La, the elemental Ni was shifted at a diffraction peak of 2P3/2, yielded an offset of −0.89 eV. Presumably, the electron offset phenomenon of elemental Ni intensified due to the La was added [39]. Similarly, the addition of Cu also caused the electron binding energy of the elemental Ni to shift by −0.73 eV. The adsorption capacity of the catalyst for hydrogen and the reactants was largely affected by the electron energy effect produced by the electron transfer so that the activity of the catalyst and the selectivity of HDO were changed [40]."
9,Product distribution and catalytic performance,"3.2 Product distribution and catalytic performance Results of guaiacol HDO investigation under hydrogen donor conditions by five different catalysts were shown in Table 4 and Fig. 7 . With the HDO and transalkylation of guaiacol, the hydrodeoxygenated liquid-phase product can be divided into BTX, phenol, other hydrocarbons, and other oxygenates. The other hydrocarbons were mainly classified into benzene hydrocarbon derivatives and a small portion of long-chain alkanes. The different catalysts exhibited substantial differences in the HDO rate of guaiacol. According to the functional group classification, liquid-phase organic products could be classified as hydrocarbons, phenols, acids, ketones, ethers, esters, aldehydes, and alcohols. When the blank HZSM-5 carrier was used as catalyst, the conversion rate of guaiacol reached 92.76%, with the other hydrocarbons formed up to 55.09%. Ketones were produced as the keto group formed by the cleavage of isopropanol was transferred to the benzene ring. The relative content of other oxygenates was 22.97%. It also showed a higher hydrocarbon selectivity rate of 78.46%. When the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 was used, the HDO rate of guaiacol was only 54.68%, and the hydrocarbon selectivity decreased to 32.54%, with significant increase in ketones and phenolics. Lewis acidic sites on the surface of the support favoring hydrogenation of the phenolic hydroxyl group were largely replaced by metal acidic sites, resulting in a decrease in the total acid content of the catalyst, which might be the main reason for the significant decrease in the catalytic activity [41]. For the La-modified catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&La, the conversion of guaiacol reached 97.79%, and the HDO rate increased to 95.93%, with 34.25% BTX products and 61.75% other hydrocarbons. And the whole hydrocarbon content reached 96.31%. In addition, it is easy to find the addition of Cu did not improve the HDO activity of the catalyst [42]. The catalyst Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La showed 12.37% guaiacol conversion rate and the 5.08% HDO rate. It worth to note that phenols were the main product, which indicated that the catalyst did not show high-breaking ability to the phenolic hydroxyl group. The guaiacol conversion rate of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&SBA-15 was only 63.22%, which was lower than that of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5, and the HDO rate was likewise reduced to 31.21%. In this case, the selectivity of oxygenates reached 98.74%. Phenols, ketones, and acids were the main components of the liquid products, and their selectivity were 48.83%, 26.84%, and 20.40%, respectively. Although the addition of the support SBA-15 increased the pore structure of the catalyst, a large number of Lewis acidic sites were covered by metal sites, which leaded to a significant increase in the selectivity of the catalyst for the phenolic product [43]. Catalyst Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&SBA-15 showed 90.95% guaiacol conversion rate, while its HDO rate dropped to 60.27%. The selectivity of acids and hydrocarbons was 54.06% and 34.50%, respectively, which could be due to the excellent pore structure reducing the coverage of the active metal nickel sites caused by the loading of Cu. The active metal Ni supported on the surface of the carrier demonstrated good hydrogenation ability, which was beneficial for the formation of the target product BTX. However, excessive loading might reduce the selectivity of the target product [43]. In general, the coverage of the acidic sites of the carrier caused by the loading of nickel was inhibited by La. The active metal Cu significantly reduced the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, and part of the metal nickel active center was covered by excess Cu, resulting in the reducing of catalytic activity. Moreover, the double carrier was not suitable for guaiacol HDO."
10,Real bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation experiment,"3.3 Real bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation experiment Camellia shell pyrolysis volatile multi-stage condensed product oil pre-prepared at 500 °C was used for the experiment [44]. The Ni/HZSM-5&La catalyst with a better effect on guaiacol HDO was selected. Isopropanol was used as hydrogen donor. Light and heavy bio-oil and isopropanol were uniformly mixed separately, and then the mixture was pumped into the reaction tube, while the reaction conditions were unchanged. Only guaiacol was replaced with real bio-oil. Table 5 gave the relative content of the real bio-oil raw material and the components in the liquid-phase product after the reaction. Note from Table 4 that the light oil used in the experiment mainly contained ketones and acid compounds, which were 27.90% and 36.61%, respectively. And phenolic compounds content reached 14.5%. There were also a small number of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and so on. In the liquid-phase product of the light oil component after the reaction, the total content of the hydrocarbon compound reached 97.44%. The ketone and the acid compound were all converted, and the other components were less than 1%. For heavy bio-oil, 44.73% of the hydrocarbons was in the heavy oil before the reaction, while the phenols and ketones reached 29.92% and 12.86%, respectively. The total hydrocarbon content in the liquid-phase product of the heavy oil after the reaction reached 99.24%. Comparison of the content of the components before and after the HDO of light and heavy oil reaction, the contents of ketones, acids, phenols, and alcohols were significantly reduced, and the acid components were completely converted. The acids were not detected in the liquid-phase product. Accordingly, light and heavy oils HDO under hydrogen donors displayed high selectivity for hydrocarbon products. The hydrogen bond between isopropanol and bio-oil accelerated the further decomposition of organic compounds. In addition, a decrease in the polarity of isopropanol caused by hydrodeoxygenation and an increase in the oil affinity of the polar organic compound (water-soluble compound) was observed [45]."
11,Change of guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation product and mechanism analysis,"3.4 Change of guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation product and mechanism analysis Fig. 8 showed the types and relative contents of organic substances with a large concentration in the liquid-phase product. The main products produced by different catalysts were quite different. Moreover, there was a significant difference in the relative amounts of hydrodeoxygenation products via different catalysts. The blank HZSM-5 yielded the highest selectivity for toluene and xylene, probably due to the Lewis acidic site distribution on the surface [46]. The selectivity of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 to the BTX decreased significantly, whereas that of phenolic products such as phenol, 3-(1-methyl ethyl)- increased. After adding the catalytic additive La, the selectivity of the BTX increased significantly, reaching 14.94% and 18.54%, respectively. For Ni–Cu/HZSM-5&La, the selectivity of each product significantly reduced owing to the very low guaiacol conversion. Meanwhile, the addition of the co-supported SBA-15 significantly improved the selectivity of the phenolic product, while it considerably reduced the selectivity of the hydrocarbon product. Based on the existing research results, there was a requirement for the alcoholic hydroxyl group to interact with the catalyst surface sites to successfully dehydrogenate [47]. When alcohol was used as the hydrogen donor, the hydrogen of the alcoholic hydroxyl species would interact with the Bronsted base site (Os) in the SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst, with the surface O atoms approaching the Al vacancies (Lewis acid sites). An H–Os bond (a bond of alcohol-OH hydrogen to a Bronsted base Os) was formed at these adsorption sites. In addition to the H–Os interaction, secondary interaction of the alcoholic hydroxyl group with the adjacent acid sites would help break the C–Oad bond [48]. Therefore, the addition of hydrogen donor isopropanol could promote the conversion of guaiacol. Furthermore, the above results indicated that the HDO activity of the hydroxy compound as a hydrogen donor can be selectively improved. Fig. 9 showed the reaction mechanism of guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation, based on the products distribution. When isopropanol was used as a hydrogen donor, it was thermally cracked under heating to form H• and acetone, which were further thermally cracked into propylene, H•, and a small amount of CO [49]. In the HDO process of guaiacol, H• and propylene were further involved. Fig. 10 showed the variation process of the main products of different catalysts. The main reaction was the direct demethoxylation (DMO) of guaiacol to produce phenol [23]. Methylphenol was obtained via transmethylation (ME) of phenol, while toluene could be obtained via direct deoxygenation (DDO) of methyl phenol [50]. Further ME gave xylene, and guaiacol could undergo DDO to obtain methoxybenzene [51]. In addition, benzene could be obtained by further deoxidation [52]. Subsequently, the guaiacol HDO product was further condensed with propylene to form various by-products, including phenol, 3-(1-methyl ethyl)- and phenol, 4-(1-methyl ethyl). Moreover, benzene, 1-ethyl-2-methyl-, benzene, 1-ethyl-3-methyl-, and benzene, 1-ethyl-4-methyl- could be obtained by condensation of toluene with propylene. Combined with the product distribution of HDO via different catalysts, it can be seen that the blank carrier HZSM-5 could promote the conversion of phenol to methyl phenol, further convert to toluene and xylene, while part of toluene and xylene participated in the side reaction with propylene. After the addition of the active metal Ni, the activity of the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 on methyl phenol DDO was weakened, which enriched the phenol. The excess phenol was converted to 3-(1-methyl ethyl)-phenol and 4-(1-methyl ethyl)-phenol, and so on,which was the raw material for side reactions. The addition of catalytic auxiliary La not only promoted the conversion of phenol ME to methyl phenol and subsequent reactions but also enhanced the occurrence of the side reactions. Further, after the Cu was loaded, the DMO of guaiacol was suppressed. Therefore, the conversion rate was lowered, and only a small amount of phenol was obtained. For the dual-supported catalysts, the addition of the co-supported SBA-15 had slight effect on phenol ME. Similarly, the phenol was converted to 3-(1-methyl ethyl)-phenol and 4-(1-methyl ethyl)-phenol by a side reaction. The enrichment and conversion of phenol slowed down after the addition of Cu, meanwhile, toluene participated in the side reaction. The reaction pathways that may occur in the system were expressed as follows: (Ipo： isopropanol； Act: acetone; Pro: propylene, GUA: guaiacol, Ph: phenol, Cre: Cresol, An: anisole; Ben: benzene, Tol: toluene, Xyl: xylene). (1) Thermal cracking of isopropanol: Acetone：Ipo→ Act + H• Propylene：Act →Pro + H• (2) Primary reaction Phenol： GUA + H•→Ph+•CH3+H2O Cresol： Ph +•CH3→ Cre Toluene： Cre + H•→Tol + H2O Xylene： Tol+•CH3→Xyl Anisole： GUA + H•→An + H2O Benzene： Ph + H•→Ben + H2O An + H•→Ben + CH4+H2O (3) Side reaction C3H7-Ph：Ph + H• + •C3H5→C3H7-Ph C3H5-Tol：Tol + •C3H5→ C3H5-Tol Guaiacol HDO reaction under hydrogen donor was more complicated. There was not only a series of reactions of hydrogen donor thermal cracking and guaiacol HDO but also side reactions between the products of the above two reactions. Moreover, the preparation route of the catalyst had a great influence on the catalytic activity. This effect was manifested by factors such as the distribution and the content of acidic sites, active site distribution, metal grain size, and BET surface properties. Dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, methyl transfer, ethyl transfer, and dehydration condensation of by-products were considered as the major reflections in the overall reaction system."
12,Conclusion,"A series of nickel-based zeolite supported catalysts were prepared for the in-situ HDO of bio-oil. The addition of La changed the pore structure distribution on the surface of the catalyst, and improved the dispersion of the active metal Ni. The highest HDO rate(97.79%) and BTX selectivity(34.25%) were obtained via the catalyst Ni/HZSM-5&La due to the combined role of the strong acid site and better metal dispersion. When the real bio-oil was introduced, the main products form the light oil and heavy oil HDO was BTX, which reached 27.72% and 32.56%, respectively. Moreover, the total content of hydrocarbons was above 95%, which showed the strongest HDO activity. Furthermore, product distribution proved that selective catalytic HDO of guaiacol could be divided into two ways DDO and DMO. Benzene can be obtained by DDO of phenol and anisole, while the toluene or xylene can be obtained via transmethylase. Hydrogenation of guaiacol produced free radicals such as •CH3, •OCH3 and benzene rings, and •C3H5，H• produced by pyrolysis of isopropanol. The interaction between free radicals played an important role in the guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation. This work provides an effective way to convert biomass pyrolysis bio-oil into high value-added green chemicals BTX."
