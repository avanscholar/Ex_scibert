0,Introduction,"Nowadays renewable energy source has been a high interested research area due to the worldwide increasing energy consumption combined with the environmental concerns. Among all the fuels, hydrogen is the cleanest energy in the world as its combustion production does not contain any pollutants (i.e. greenhouse gases) but water only [1]. In addition, hydrogen is an energy-efficient fuel, which has a much higher mass energy density than any other fuels. The mass energy content of hydrogen is 33.3kWhkg−1, indicating that 1kg of hydrogen can effectively replace almost 3kg of gasoline (11.1kWhkg−1) [2,3]. Even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it cannot be found in its pure state in the nature [4]. Until recently, hydrogen is produced mainly from natural gas reforming and coal gasification. However, fossil fuel based hydrogen evolution is non-renewable, and its by-products are environmentally hazardous [5–7]. Besides the above two industrialized ways, fermentation and photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes are potential approaches [8]. However, considering the low productivity and instability of hydrogen production for fermentation and PEC process, both of them are difficult to be industrialized [9]. Microorganisms in the microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can make use of different substrates, such as alcohols and organic acids; thus, the process of electrohydrogenesis applying MECs is an alternative method for hydrogen production [10]. But the limited lifetime of the microorganisms and the slow rate of the fermentation of the microorganisms make the MEC technology for hydrogen production from biomass ineffective and costly [11,12]. Proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC) is another common electrolysis method for water electrolysis to produce pure hydrogen evolution. [13] Even with noble metal in both cathode and anode, overvoltage of whole electrolysis cell is typically on the order of 300–400mV and a high energy consumption for water electrolysis was observed [14,15]. Uhm et al. [16] and Chen et al. [17] reported high faraday efficiency electrolysis system using nano-scale noble metal catalysts on anode and cathode. However, the high price of the anodic noble metal catalysts restricts the development and large-scale industrialization. Also, PEMEC cannot directly utilize the macromolecular native biomass because the noble metal catalysts are difficult to catalyze the oxidation of polymeric biomass molecules at low temperature [2]. Consequently, it is urgent to find a new method that is eco-friendly, durable and cost-effective. Nevertheless, in view of the characteristics of easily obtained and economy of biomass, the novel methods using biomass as fuel for sustainable hydrogen evolution is cost-efficient and energy-saving [16,17]. Some advanced research studies have already reported the polyoxometalates (POMs) involved in fuel cell and hydrogen evolution play a role as the electron-coupled-proton buffer in Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and PEMEC [2,18–20]. However, the molecular weight of POMs are too large, which makes both the reaction rate and mass transport rate POMs in solution slow. Furthermore, due to the large molecular weight, it is very difficult to prepare high mole concentration solution to achieve a high efficient electrolysis in hydrogen production. Although POMs are considered as inexpensive catalyst, the cost in large manufacturing applications is still a concern. In contrast, Fe3+ has a low molecular weight, suitable electrical potential (standard electrostatic potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair is 0.77V) and high solubility in water. It is known that Fe3+ can be reduced to Fe2+ by interacting with biomass such as starch, cellulose and lignin. The reduced Fe2+ can also be easily oxidized to Fe3+ under electric field greater than 0.7V. Because of this unique property, Fe3+ ion has been used as the oxidation agent in electrolysis cell to accelerate the oxidation of coal [21,22]. However, there is limited work in literature using polymeric biomasses as hydrogen sources and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution [23,24]. In this study, we report that Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple can be used as oxidation and charge transfer agent to convert natural biomass to hydrogen through electrolysis method. And glucose was used as model compound of biomass for further detail study because of its simple structure. Through this study, the approach with the characteristics of fast-speed and efficient hydrogen evolution has been obtained."
1,Experiment,
2,Experimental Setup,"2.1 Experimental Setup The experiments were carried out in a bench-scale continuous PEMEC as showed in Fig. 1 a. A piece of pretreated Nafion 115 membrane was sandwiched between two graphite plates; graphite felt was embedded in the anode graphite plate, and a 5-layer gas diffusion electrode (FuelcellsEtc, USA) was used as the cathode. The detailed construction of the electrolysis cell was shown in Fig. 1b. Biomass and Ferric chloride (FeCl3) (Alfa Aesar) mixed solutions were pre-heated for several hours and then were pumped into carbon anode of the electrolysis cell as the anolyte under heating. 1M H3PO4 solution was pumped through cathode cell. Along with the preheating, biomass was oxidized by Fe3+ and degraded into small molecular, and Fe3+ was reduced into Fe2+ simultaneously. When an electric field is applied, the Fe2+ can be oxidized into Fe3+ on the carbon anode, and H+ can be reduced into H2 on the cathode. In the electrolysis process, the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple plays two important roles: Fe3+ functions as an oxidation agent to degrade biomass, and Fe2+ functions as an electron carrier to transfer the electrons to electrolysis cell anode. Fe3+/Fe2+ ions are fully regenerable during the electrolysis process, so they actually function as electrochemical catalyst. All chemical equations can be showed in Eqs. (1)–(5): In the anode tank: (1) B i o m a s s + H 2 O + F e 3 + → o x i d i z e d p r o d u c t s + F e 2 + + C O 2 + H + On the anode: (2) F e 2 + − e − → F e 3 + On the cathode: (3) H + + e − → 1 2 H 2 The total chemical equation: (4) Biomass + H 2 O → o x i d i z e d p r o d u c t s + C O 2 + H 2 If the glucose could be completely oxidized, the only oxidized product is CO2. (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 C O 2 + 12 H 2"
3,Materials and Preparations,"2.2 Materials and Preparations The biomasses, including potato starch (Gain Processing Corporation), cellulose (Alfa Aesar) and glucose (Alfa Aesar), were used in the degradation experiment, respectively. HCl (Aldrich, 36.5–38.0%), H2SO4 (Aldrich, 95–98%), HNO3 (Aldrich, assay≥69%), H3PO4 (Alfa Aesar, 85%), H2O2 (Aldrich, 30%), Nafion 115 membrane (127 micrometers thick, purchased from DuPon ™), 5-layer gas diffusion electrode (FuelcellsEtc, US), acetic acid (ALDRICH, 36–38%), sodium acetate (EM SCIENCE, Germany), 1, 10-phenanthroline (AMRESCO, USA). The bipolar plates of the electrolysis cell were made of two high-density graphite plates. For each graphite plate, a serpentine flow channel 2mm wide, 10mm deep, and 5cm long (total geometry projected area was 1cm2) was carved. The graphite felt was immerged into the mixed solution of H2SO4 and HNO3 concentrated in a 3:1 volumetric ratio at 60°C for half hour. Then, the graphite felt was washed with DI water until pH of the wash water became neutral, dried at 90°C and cut to pieces with 2mm width and 10mm thick. After that, one of the graphite plates was filled with pretreated graphite felt and used as anode for the electrolysis cell. A piece of Nafion 115 membrane was pre-treated with the mixed solution of 1M H2SO4 and 3% wt H2O2 under 100°C for 30min and then was washed and soaked in DI water. Subsequently, the pre-treated membrane was sandwiched between two graphite plates; the graphite felt was used as the anode, and a 5-layer gas diffusion electrode was used as the cathode. There were two acrylic plastic plates surrounding the anode and cathode graphite plates. In order to prevent any leakage, two pieces of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) were used between anode and cathode and separated by the Nafion membrane. The anolyte, the pre-obtained biomass-Fe ion solution, was stored in an anode tank, and the 1M H3PO4 solution was in the cathode tank. Both of the two electrolytes were kept at 90°C, which were then pumped into and out of the electrode cell through 4 PTFE tubes with the flow rate of 35mLmin−1. Hydrogen was evolved from cathode. The hydrogen bubbles underwent a cooling system (25°C) to exclude the water vapor, and finally was collected at standard condition. The rate of hydrogen production was calculated from gas volume measurements, and the gas production from anode was analyzed by gas chromatograph."
4,Degradation of Biomass with Fe3+/Fe2+ Redox Couple at Elevated Temperature,"2.3 Degradation of Biomass with Fe3+/Fe2+ Redox Couple at Elevated Temperature The degradation of biomass was performed in aqueous solution with stirring by simple heating. Take glucose for example, calculated amount of glucose was added into FeCl3 solution with magnetic stirring until dissolved. HCl was added into the above solution to control the pH of reaction solution. Then, 50mL of the freshly prepared glucose-FeCl3 solution was transferred to the glassy conical flask and refluxed at 90°C for 4hours with stirring. Oxygen bubbling was performed using the glass filter below the regeneration reactor. With several hours heating, the yellow biomass-ferric ion solution gradually turned into red brown. After it was cooled to room temperature, desired amount of DI water was added to maintain the total volume of 50mL. Very small amount of solution was taken out as a sample then diluted 50,000 times for analysis of the reduction rate of Fe3+ by spectrophotometry."
5,Analysis of Reduction Rate of Fe3+,"2.4 Analysis of Reduction Rate of Fe3+ The reduction rate of Fe3+ ion can be obtained by measuring the concentration of Fe2+ ion by spectrophotometry analysis. With an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer, Fe2+ ion reacts with 1, 10-phenanthroline (pH=3 to 9) and produces stable jacinth complex. The relationship of the light absorbance (at 510nm) and concentration of the complex is consistent with Lambert-Beer Law [25,26]. In order to obtain the calibration curve, standard solutions with different concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate, were prepared. Acetic acid − sodium acetate buffer solution (NaAc − HAc buffer solution) and 1, 10-phenanthroline were added into standard solution for absorbance determination at 510nm. Therefore, the calibration curve of 2μM Fe2+ ions at different reduction degrees was obtained. The mixed solution containing 1M Fe3+ and 1M glucose was pre-heated with different times (0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0h), and then the different reduction rates of Fe3+ in glucose solutions were obtained. 1mL of the reduced Fe2+ ion solution was taken out as a sample then diluted to 2μM Fe2+ ions. NaAc − HAc buffer solution and required 1, 10-phenanthroline were added into diluted solution for absorbance determination at 510nm. Herein, the reduction rate of Fe3+ for different reaction time could be obtained. Because Fe2+ in the solution may be re-oxidized by oxygen in air, the DI water used to dilute the samples was deoxygenated by N2 purging."
6,Chemical analysis of the pre-heated biomass-Fe ion solution,"2.5 Chemical analysis of the pre-heated biomass-Fe ion solution The 4hours pre-heated solution was adjusted to pH 10 using NaOH. The solid–liquid mixture was centrifuged with 6000rpm for 15min with a 5804R Centrifuge. The obtained supernatant was used in the subsequent chemical analysis. GC–MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer) analysis was performed with a Hewlett–Packard 6890/5973 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, which was equipped with a capillary column and a quadrupole analyzer with the operation condition of electron impact (70eV) mode. The obtained data was processed with Chemstation software. 1H NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance/DMX 400MHz NMR spectrometer. Supernatant was extracted with CDCl3 and then used for NMR analysis. TOC (Total Organic Carbon) analysis was conducted with a carbon analyzer (model 1555B, Ionics, Incorporated)."
7,Results and Discussion,
8,Electron and Proton Transfer under Heating,"3.1 Electron and Proton Transfer under Heating At first, the biomass powders were added in the solution: starch and glucose were dissolved, and cellulose was suspended in the solution. But with the processing of the reaction, most cellulose gradually dissolved in the ferric chloride solution after heating at 90°C for 8hours, indicating that the cellulose can be directly oxidized by Fe3+ under experiment condition. The detail reactions between biomass and FeCl3 will to be discussed later. As the reaction went on, the appearance of Fe2+ was found and the concentration of obtained Fe2+ in the solution was detected by UV–vis spectrum at 510nm after adding 1, 10-phenanthroline to form stable jacinth complex. The calibration curve for Fe2+ solution was showed in Fig. 2 a. The concentrations of the obtained Fe2+ in the reaction of 1M glucose and 1M Fe3+ solution were measured under different reaction times (Fig. 2b). The concentration of Fe2+ increased along with the increased heating reaction time, demonstrating that glucose could be oxidized by Fe3+ under the temperature of 90°C, and Fe3+ was reduced into Fe2+. Rising up the reaction time, the conversion rate of Fe3+ was also increased. At 6hour reaction time, the conversion rate of Fe3+ ( α F e 3 + ) was calculated from Eq. (6): α F e 3 + = n F e 2 + ( n F e 2 + + n F e 3 + ) = 88.9 % n is the molar numbers of Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions. After 6hours heating, most of Fe3+ was reduced into Fe2+. A linear relationship between the concentration of obtained Fe2+ and heating reaction time was found showed in Eq. (7): (7) c Fe 2 + = 0.157 t − 0.0268 ( R 2 = 0.994 ) cFe 2+ is the concentration of Fe2+ at reaction time t. The slope of the linear relationship between Fe2+ concentration and heating reaction time is 0.157, indicating that the reaction rate of glucose with Fe3+ is 0.157moll−1 h−1 in our experiment condition. It also suggested that the number of electron transfers from glucose to Fe3+ ions linearly increased with the reaction time under the temperature of 90°C, and the redox reaction was a zero order reaction with respect to the reaction time. In the case cellulose and starch, similar results were obtained (Fig. 2b) that the concentration of Fe2+ increased with the reaction time. According to the Faraday’s laws, if all the obtained Fe2+ ions were re-oxidized on the electrolysis cell anode during the electrolysis process, 1liter glucose-FeCl3 solution (containing 1M FeCl3 and 1M glucose) could provide total charge of Q after one hour heating showed in Eq. (8): (8) Q = n * Z * F = 15,148.145 C n is the number of moles of obtained Fe2+ for 1liter glucose- FeCl3 solution hearted for 1hour, which is 0.157mol in our experiments. Z is the valence number of ions of the substance (electrons transferred per ion), and for this reaction the value of Z is 1; F is the Faraday constant of which the value is 96,485Cmol−1. If all the obtained electrons were converted into current, the obtained current (I) could be calculated in Eq. (9): (9) I= Q/t =4.208A When 50mL preheated glucose-FeCl3 solution was pumped through the anode, the largest value of electric current provided by the glucose-FeCl3reaction could be 210.4mA."
9,Electrolysis of Glucose-Fe ions system in a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell,"3.2 Electrolysis of Glucose-Fe ions system in a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell 3.2.1 Determination of the Electrical Characteristics of the Electrolysis A series of tests was performed to confirm the biomass-FeCl3 solution electrolysis process. Increased potentials were applied to the PEMEC. Phosphoric acid (1M) was pumped through the cathode. Different solutions were fed to the carbon anode, and the obtained currents were recorded as a function of applied potential (Fig. 3 a). First, pure hydrochloric acid solution (1M) was used as control solution in anode. Then, the mixture solution (1M glucose and 1M HCl mixed solution without any Fe2+ or Fe3+) was pumped through the anode, and other experimental conditions were the same with the control test. As excepted and showed in Fig. 3a, even when the applied potential raised up to 1.2V which was very close to the standard potential of water electrolysis (1.23V) [27], there was no obvious current increasing. Next, when fresh prepared glucose-Fe ion solutions (50mL of different concentration of Fe3+ and 1M glucose mixed solution with 4hours pre-heating) were pumped into the anode, a notable increase of the electrolysis current was noted. For all the fresh prepared glucose-Fe ion solutions, when the applied potential was around 0.7V, the value of the current had a strongly positive correlation to the concentration of Fe3+ in Fig. 3a. These results suggested that the preheated biomass solution with Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple could make a difference on the electrolysis current. The comparison among the three experiments indicated that H2O, glucose and Cl− could not be oxidized on the carbon anode without loading any noble metal catalyst at out experimental condition, but the pre-heated glucose with Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple was much easier to be oxidized at lower applied potential. In this study, the pre-heated glucose-Fe ion solutions containing different Fe2+ ion concentration were pumped though the carbon anode, respectively. At the same time, increased potentials were applied on the PEMEC. For each pre-heated solution, the electrolysis current was increased sharply when the applied cell potential was increasing around 0.7V. Meanwhile hydrogen bubbles began to grow on the cathode. When the applied potential reached 1.0V, the electrolysis current density was up to 0.266Acm−2 for the pre-heated solution (50mL 1M Fe ions, 1M glucose and 6mL HCl heating for 4hours). Even through there was no noble-metal catalyst coating on the anode, the electrolysis current density was much higher than the literature reported value of electrochemical conversion of ethanol alcohol with platinum anode (0.2Acm−2 at applied potential 1.0V) [28]. In addition, along with the increasing concentration of Fe3+, the value of the onset point (the point at which electrolysis current suddenly increases) decreased and the value of the slope of the polarization curves increased. The sudden increasing in the electrolysis current density suggests the electro-oxidation started on the anode. The polarization effect of glucose with different concentrations (0.05M to 1M) under fixed concentration of Fe3+ (1M) on increased potentials was also investigated (Fig. 3b). As the concentration of glucose increasing, the current was raised up under the same applied potential. If more glucose was presented in the solution, glucose and Fe3+ had more chance for effective collision leading to a higher reaction rate. The results suggest that the high concentration of glucose could enhance the current density when increased potentials were applied to the electrolysis system, and both the concentration of glucose and Fe ions are key factors of the research. Not only glucose, but also other biomass, wheat straw, was reported that can be oxidized by Fe3+ [29]. In this study, potato starch and cellulose were also pre-heated with Fe3+ and reacted for 8hours. When electric field was applied, the current densities of starch-Fe ions and cellulose-Fe ion system were recorded (Fig. 3c). When the applied potential reached 1.0V, the current densities were 0.239Acm−2 and 0.158Acm−2 for starch and cellulose systems, respectively. The slope of polarization curve of starch-Fe ion system was very close to the glucose-Fe ion system, because starch, similar to glucose, could also been oxidized under 90°C. However, when cellulose-Fe ion systems were tested under the same condition, the current is little smaller than that of glucose-Fe ion systems, indicating slower oxidation rate of cellulose by Fe3+ when their mixture was pre-heated. There are several possible reasons that can lead to the result. For example, the rigid crystalline structure, the large physical size and small solubility of the cellulose in water compared to glucose and starch. [30–32] However, it was noted that the slope of polarization curve is directly related to the amount of oxidizable substances rather than the chemical property of the biomass because the real electric oxidation component on the anode are reduced substances but not the native biomasses. Consequently, although the chemical property of biomass can directly influence the kinetics of biomass-Fe ion reaction, current density of the electrolysis cell is main relevant to the Fe2+ concentration. 3.2.2 CV Curve of Different Solutions A 3-electrode system was applied to investigate the reason for the sudden increasing of electrolysis current when the cell potential was around 0.7V. The curves of cyclic voltammetry of a 12% v/v HCl solution and a mixed solution (12% v/v HCl and 1M glucose) were recorded under glassy carbon working electrode, Pt counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode. The value of current showed in CV curve was rather small, and no clear oxidation peak could be observed by adding HCl alone. Even though glucose, the electron donor, was introduced into the HCl solution, no obvious current could be observed (Fig. 4 a). However, an obvious oxidation peak at around 0.7V vs Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) was noted for the pre-heated solution (a mixture of 1M Fe ions and 1M glucose with 4hours pre-heating) (Fig. 4b). Compared to the HCl solution and the HCl-glucose solution, the redox peaks of the pre-heated solution demonstrated that neither glucose nor Cl− in the pre-heated solution could be directly oxidized on graphite electrode. The oxidation starts at ca. 0.7V vs. RHE on glassy carbon. Compared to the standard electrical potential of water electrolysis (1.23V), our approach requires much smaller onset potential (around 0.7V). Moreover, even when compared to ethanol electrolysis with Pt anode, cell voltage of biomass-Fe ion system is much smaller. For example, the cell potential for electrolyzing ethanol is over 1.0V at 100mAcm−2 [33]; while the electrolysis potential in our glucose-Fe ion system is around 0.7V at 100mAcm−2 for continue hydrogen generation. Thus our method has a significant advancement of energy conservation. The oxidation of biomass by Fe3+ was further studied using glucose as the model compound. In the first test, the 4hour pre-heated glucose-Fe3+ solution (50mL mixed solution of 1M Fe3+ and 1M glucose) and 1M H3PO4 solution were pumped into carbon anode and cathode, respectively. The current density was controlled to be a constant number (50mAcm−2), and the electrolysis potential was recorded in Fig. 4c. Without any subsequent heating after pre-heating process, the electrolysis potential was almost unchanged at first. However, after a while, the electrolysis potential gradually increased to maintain the same current density (50mAcm−2), demonstrating that a higher electrolysis potential was needed to maintain the same rate of hydrogen production because the decrease of Fe2+ concentration in the solution without subsequent heating (the Fe3+ is hard to oxidize glucose at room temperature). When continue heating was applied in the electrolysis process, both the electrolysis potential and the current density were remained the same as it was applied at the beginning for all tests, as showed in Fig. 5 a. However, with continue heating, Fe3+ ions were reduced into Fe2+ ions and biomasses were degraded to low molecular weight products and protons. Combined with electrolysis, the obtained protons would cross Nafion membrane and were reduced into H2, and the reduced Fe2+ was oxidized into Fe3+. As a result, the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple is regenerable: Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions were continuously provided and consumed, which keeps the electrolysis potential almost a constant numbers."
10,Hydrogen Evolution Rate,"3.3 Hydrogen Evolution Rate To evaluate the reliability of biomass-Fe based hydrogen evolution system, cell potential curves under 3 different fixed currents (50, 100, 200mAcm−2) were investigated. Taking glucose for example, three constant cell potentials were monitored, as showed in Fig. 5a. Similar curves were obtained when glucose was replaced by starch and cellulose, respectively (Fig. 5b, c). All the tests were conducted in the condition of temperature 90°C for the anode tank, so that Fe3+ can continuously oxide biomass into small molecules. At the same time, hydrogen was produced at the cathode and collected. It was confirmed by GC that the only hydrogen was found in the gas collected from cathode, indicating the hydrogen gas is very pure for all biomass-Fe electrolysis systems. It is clearly seen from Fig. 5a that when the current densities increased from 50 to 100 and 200mAcm−2, the electrolysis potentials of glucose-Fe ion system raised up from ca. 0.7V to ca. 0.9V. And all the cell potentials of the above experiments were almost constant at same current density. The reliable hydrogen evolution reflected on the constant applied potential lies on a steady electron transfer between glucose and Fe ions, which means the reaction rate of biomass-Fe ion solution is enough to provide protons and electrons for electrolysis and hydrogen evolution. The rate of hydrogen evolution was monitored by measuring the volume of evolved hydrogen as a function of time for different constant current densities (j=50, 100 and 200mAcm−2) as shown in Fig. 5d. In all experiments (different biomass-Fe ion systems), 24mL of hydrogen have been collected (Fig. 5d–f) with condensation unit under different electrolysis time. For different biomass-Fe ion systems (at different current densities j=50, 100, 200mAcm−2), the volumes of produced hydrogen does not depend on the types of biomass, but on the current density. For different biomass, at same current density, the rates of hydrogen evolution are similar. For example at 100mAcm−2, the reaction rates of hydrogen evolution were 0.0109, 0.0108 and 0.0108mL/s for glucose, starch and cellulose-Fe ion systems, respectively. The results mentioned above prove that the process follows the Faraday’s law according to the following Eqs. (10) and (11) [13]: (10) d V H 2 / d t = V m d N H 2 / d t = V m ( I / n F ) (11) d V H 2 / d t = V m ( I / 2 F ) × 60 = 7.62 I ( i n c m 3 m i n − 1 ) Here, the Vm is the specific molar volume of hydrogen at a given pressure and temperature (Vm =24.5×10−3 m3 mol−1 at 100kPa and 25°C), I is the current density expressed in Ampere and n (n=2) is the number of Faraday per molecule of hydrogen produced in the oxidation reaction of a glucose molecule. The hydrogen evolution rates with different current densities were showed in Table 1 . These experimental results for glucose-Fe ion systems were compared to the calculation values at different current densities (50, 100 and 200mAcm−2) (Fig. 5b). All experiments reached high Faraday efficiency: experimental results were slight lower than the calculated values, and the average Faraday’s efficiency for glucose-Fe ion system was 90.63%. The small loss in the Faraday’s efficiency might be attributed to the impedance of the glucose-Fe ion solution and some gas leakage at the collection section."
11,Products Analysis,"3.4 Products Analysis Eq. (5) shows the complete oxidation of glucose by Fe3+ ions, but practically, multiple parallel reactions are actually involved. The specific redox reaction in biomass-Fe ion system can be speculated by the final products and the quantity of released hydrogen from biomass. However, the final products varied from different reaction conditions, such as the reaction time, the temperature, the concentration of iron ions and the types of biomass. Although there were several complicated redox reactions happened in the system, it was verified that the large polymeric biomass could be oxidized to smaller molecular weight derivatives under our experimental conditions. The oxidized organic chemical substances in the anode electrolyte solution were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS and TOC (Fig. 6 ). Even though the type of biomass used in this study was different, including potato starch, cellulose and glucose, the final products including formic acid and acetic acid were found for all biomass reaction systems. As to the gas products, they were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). CO2 was verified to be the only gas produced from the anode solution, and H2 was the only product from the cathode. For the starch-Fe ion system and cellulose-Fe ion system, CO2 also was the only product in emission gas. As the heating and electrolysis time increased, the quantity of formic acid and acetic acid also increased, suggesting the decomposition of the native biomasses. According to the TOC analysis, 43% of organic carbon in glucose-Fe ion system was converted into CO2 after 10 repeated oxidation and electrolysis cycles."
12,Thermodynamic Analysis,"3.5 Thermodynamic Analysis Based on the chemical analyses and electrical characterization, the principle of electrochemical decomposition of biomass (starch and glucose) in a PEMEC is demonstrated below. Fe3+ ions oxidized biomass under heating and obtained pre-heated biomass-Fe ion system which contained oxidized products, Fe2+ ions and residual Fe3+ ions. When an electric field is applied to the pre-heated biomass-Fe ion system, the reduced Fe2+ ions provides electron for anode electro-oxidation reaction. Because the charge transfers from Fe2+ ions to anode, as showed in Eq. (2), does not need noble metal catalyst, a significant cost reduction can be realized. Furthermore, both Fe2+ ions and carbon electrode are chemically stable, the anode contamination that is commonly seen in noble metal catalyst anode is not a problem with our new electrolysis design. Protons that are released from biomass reached the cathode compartment after crossing-over the Nafion 115 membrane and were reduced into hydrogen on the cathode. Consequently, compared with normal PEM, our biomass-Fe ion electrolyzer is able to convert biomass to hydrogen at a low potential without noble metal catalyst on the graphite felt anode. Glucose, which acted as the electron and proton donor, could be directly hydrolyzed into small oligomer by Fe3+ under heating. With continue heating, the final products of degradation of glucose were lower molecular derivatives such as formic acid, acetic acid and CO2. Potato starch and cellulose play the same role as glucose, and after long enough reaction time, their final gas phase product is CO2, too. In all experiments for glucose-Fe ion system, the electrolysis energy used for evolution of 1Nm3 hydrogen is directly proportional to the cell voltage, according to Eq. (12). The theoretical value of the consumed electrical energy (We) together with the obtained cell potential (Ucell(j)) at given current density for producing hydrogen is showed in Table 1. (12) W e = U c e l l ( j ) · I · t When the current densities of electrolysis are 50, 100 and 200mAcm−2, the values of We are 1.710, 1.845 and 2.288kWhNm−3 H2, respectively. In a continuous experiment, the fuels (i.e., glucose, starch and cellulose) were continuously fed into the electrolysis system and converted into the hydrogen and COx under applied electric field. Taking glucose for example, the total energy balance for this steady flow system can be expressed as Eq. (13) (13) Q + W = ∂ ( m U ) c v ∂ t + Δ H f s + Δ [ ( 1 2 u 2 + z g ) m ] f s Q is the heat exchange rate between electrolysis system and surroundings. W is the rate of the shaft work, which contains the consumed electrical energy and the pump work. Because the pump work in a commercial reactor is much smaller than electrolysis work, it was ignored in our calculation. Therefore, W can be approximated as the consumed electrical energy. U is the internal energy of the system, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the flow streams (glucose, water, CO2 and hydrogen) that flow into and out of the system, 1 2 m u 2 is rate of the kinetic energy change of the flow streams, zmg is the rate of the potential energy change of the flow streams. For a continuous flow electrolysis operation as described in this study, the steady-state flow is applied, meaning that ∂ ( m U ) c v ∂ t = 0 , and the kinetic and potential energy change can be ignored, Δ ( 1 2 u 2 + z g ) , m =0. Therefore, Eq. (13) can be simplified as follows Eq. (14): (14) Q + W = Δ ( H m ) f s If the glucose could be oxidized completely, according to Eq. (5): to produce 1Nm3 H2 (40.82mol), 3.40mol glucose and 20.41mol H2O are needed in our system. For an insolated reactor, the heat loss can be ignored. Therefore, the total consumed heat energy Q can be calculated as follows Eq. (15): (15) Q = ∫ 298.15 K 363.15 K ( n C 6 H 12 O 6 · C p , C 6 H 12 O 6 + n H 2 O · C p , H 2 O ) d T = 0.0412 kW · h N m − 3 H 2 Glucose and water are fed at 25°C, and are heated from 25 to 90°C. All the heat capacity (Cp) and enthalpies of formation (ΔHf) at 25°C were produced at Table 2 . The reaction performs at 90°C (363.15K), so the following two reactions need to be considered as Eqs. (16) and (17): (16) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( s , 298.15 K ) + 6 H 2 O ( l , 298.15 K ) → 12 H 2 ( g , 298.15 K ) + 6 C O 2 ( g , 298.15 K ) Δ H 298.15 K (17) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( s , 298.15 K ) + 6 H 2 O ( l , 298.15 K ) → 12 H 2 ( g , 363.15 K ) + 6 C O 2 ( g , 363.15 K ) Δ H According to Kirchhoff’s law, ΔH 298.15K can be calculated via Eq. (18) (18) Δ H 298.15 K = n H 2 Δ H f θ ( H 2 ) + n C O 2 Δ H f θ ( C O 2 ) − n g l u c o s e Δ H f θ ( g l u c o s e ) − n H 2 O Δ H f θ ( H 2 O ) = 624.8 k J · m o l − 1 According to Hess’s law, ΔH can be calculated via Eq. (19) (19) Δ H = Δ H 298.15 K + ∫ 298.15 K 363.15 K ( n H 2 * C p , H 2 + n C O 2 * C p , C O 2 ) d T = 624.8 + 36.9 k J ⋅ m o l − 1 = 0.1838 kW ⋅ h ⋅ m o l − 1 Because to produce 1Nm3 H2, 3.40mol glucose is needed. Therefore, the total reaction enthalpy ΔH =3.40*0.1838=0.6249kW h. By knowing the heat Q and reaction enthalpy ΔH, the ideal electric work (assuming Faraday efficient of 100%) of W = Δ ( H m ) f s − Q = 0.5837 kW · h N m − 3 H 2 is found. Based on above consideration, the theoretical energy consumption (the summation of W and Q) is 0.5837kWh Nm−3 H2 the electrolysis system. Experimentally, the electrolysis work actually measured using our small electrolysis cell, which are 1.75, 1.89 and 2.32kWh/Nm3 H2 for 50, 100 and 200mAcm−2, respectively. Clearly, the experimental energy consumption is higher than theoretical energy, which may be resulted from the internal resistance, mass transfer and heat loss of the electrolysis because uninsulated system was used in our experiment. We believe that the actual energy consumption can be significantly reduced by optimizing the experimental conditions. To compare the energy consumption of our process with literature reported values, three electrolysis methods (alkaline water electrolysis, alcohol based PEM electrolysis, microbial electrolysis cells) reported in literature for hydrogen evolution are showed in Table 3 . It can be seen that although alcohol based PEM electrolysis process shows a similar power consumption as our system, noble metal catalyst was required on the anode [33–37]. Even though MECs is able to produce hydrogen without noble metal catalyst or other complex solid catalyst, the conversion rate is extremely lower than our system [38–41]. For alkaline water split, the energy consumption is 4.7 kWh(Nm−3)−1 as reported in most literature, [42,43] which is much higher than our process. Table 3 shows that our approach has lower energy consumption and higher hydrogen production rate over other electrolysis methods."
13,Conclusion,"It has been demonstrated that not only glucose but most native biomasses could be used as hydrogen resources for hydrogen evolution. In this paper, we reported a new route for low-cost hydrogen evolution from biomass by using Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell. With this new approach, the biomasses were directly oxidized by Fe3+ ion in the liquid solution rather than on the anode surface so noble-metal catalyst is not needed on the anode. Furthermore, utilizing Fe3+ as liquid catalyst but not solid catalyst, the overvoltage of hydrogen evolution was low, leading to a high efficient and low energy consumption electrolysis process. When biomass reacted with Fe3+ ions, the biomass started to be degraded, and different low molecular weight derivatives from biomasses were detected in the solution. These low molecular weight biomass molecules can eventually be oxidized to CO2, which was confirmed by GC measurements. It was found that CO2 was the only product found in the gas phase. The Fe ions play a role as electron carrier that captures electron from biomass, and releases the electrons on the anode surface. The protons that generated from biomass-Fe3+ reaction across the PEM and were reduced to hydrogen. The novel electrolysis cell reported in this study is the first one using iron ion liquid catalyst to enhance the for hydrogen evolution without noble metal catalyst anode, which is a low electric energy consumption process."
