0,Introduction,"Selective catalytic oxidation is a very important process in the production of organic compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and acids [1]. In particular, benzaldehyde (BH), the simplest aromatic aldehyde with a formyl substituent, has a broad range of applications in many industries nowadays [2]. However, the traditional synthesis of BH by oxidation of liquid toluene or hydrolysis of benzal chloride has the drawbacks of formation of a co-product, stringent reaction conditions [3,4], and use of expensive reactants such as noble metals, that limit the production on a large scale [5,6]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a highly efficient, environment-friendly catalytic route for the production of BH. Moreover, reducing the usage of noble metals is presently a major challenge for future technologies. The widely-applied TiO2 [7] photocatalyst shows only up to 60% selectivity under UV light in water suspensions [8]. Many strategies were proposed to improve the photocatalytic performance, such as high surface-to-volume ratio in TiO2 nanorods [9], use of different metal ions loaded on the TiO2 surface [10–12], and synthesis of TiO2-based mixed composites [13]. Other photocatalysts such as Nb2O5 [14], Pt-modified Bi2WO6 [15], bimetallic Au–Ni alloy nanoparticles [16], ZnO nanorods [17], bismuth oxyhalides [18,19], and CdS-based materials of different shapes and morphology [20–22] were extensively studied. However, the achievement of high efficiency and selectivity of the product is difficult and further comprehensive exploration of new catalysts and synthetic routes is required. Moreover, the catalysts must be environment-friendly using green energy sources and sunlight efficiently. Recently, the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to BH on defective graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets with molecular oxygen has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications [23]. It was reported that by introducing nitrogen-vacancy defects into the g-C3N4 framework, a conversion of 68.3% and almost 100% selectivity were attained. g-C3N4 is a two-dimensional material with many unique properties such as robust chemical stability under ambient conditions, non-toxicity, low-cost production, simple synthetic route, and an easily tunable band gap [24,25]. Therefore, this novel layered material has many potential applications, the most important of which is owing to its excellent photocatalytic properties [24–28]. However, the main drawback of the g-C3N4 bulk is the considerably fast migration and surface recombination of the photo-induced charge carriers [29] and the slightly enlarged band gap combined with low specific surface area [25]. An improvement in the photocatalytic properties involves an alteration from the bulk form to two-dimensional nanosheets, which significantly prevent the migration and recombination of photo-generated carriers. Nowadays, many structural modifications are introduced in g-C3N4 to enhance its photocatalytic performance such as doping [30,31], introduction of defects [23,32–34], decoration with functional groups/molecules [35–37], combination with other catalysts [38,39], and formation of different heterojunctions [40–44]. Among the above modifications, introduction of structural defects in g-C3N4 nanosheets is relatively easy and an adequate amount of defects is extremely beneficial in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The latest investigations demonstrate that nitrogen vacancies introduced in g-C3N4 nanosheets can effectively modify its electronic structure by narrowing the band gap to increase the intake of visible light and suppress the electron-hole recombination as well as improve its photocatalytic efficiency significantly [23,34,45–48]. Thus, the activity and selectivity of a catalyst are strictly related to the concentration of the vacancy, which is an effective way to optimise the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Various vacancy-engineering strategies are commonly used to tune the performances in different systems and types of reactions. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the role of nitrogen vacancies in the g-C3N4 photocatalyst at the atomistic scale. These defects act as trapping sites for photo-induced charge carriers and reduce the energy barriers considerably for different catalytic processes. Therefore, it is of great importance to perform a computational study to determine the influence of nitrogen vacancies on the selective oxidation of BA to BH using molecular oxygen [23], from the energetic point of view. A complete understanding of all the details of the reaction may lead to further improvement in this and similar photocatalysts as well. Until now, a number of theoretical studies focussed on different aspects of modification of g-C3N4 to improve its photocatalytic properties. Most of these were concerned with the influence of metal doping on the electronic structure and its impact on the catalytic properties [49], especially noble metals such as palladium (Pd) [50–52], platinum (Pt) [50,52], and gold (Au) [52]. However, in our previous study [53] using periodic density functional theory (DFT), we showed that carbon vacancies introduced into g-C3N4 followed by saturation with hydrogen (forming amino groups) could effectively reduce O2 to H2O2. We also established that the oxygen reduction process proceeds via two different mechanisms on bare and defective g-C3N4, which was in perfect agreement with the experimental results [32]. The recently published theoretical studies by Ren et al. [54] clearly show that different structures of nitrogen vacancy-modified g-C3N4 (planar and corrugated) exhibit different electronic properties and catalytic behaviour. The corrugated structure strongly modifies the optical properties as well as enhances the nitrogen reduction reaction performance, as compared to the planar structure. The focus of this study is the theoretical explanation of the influence of nitrogen vacancies on selective oxidation of BA to BH using molecular oxygen, based on the experimental results reported by Ding et al. [23]. As the details of the mechanism are not easily accessible by experiment, we adopted the DFT method to understand the nature of the active sites and structures of the intermediates and transition states. Various adsorption configurations related to the individual steps of the process on the bare and defective g-C3N4 were studied systematically to obtain an accurate mechanism profile for both the cases. Most importantly, the finding of the transition state (TS) for the postulated rate-limiting step was essential for explaining the experimental data. The observed differences in the reactivity of two additional benzyl alcohols, with electron-donating (OCH3) and electron-withdrawing (NO2) groups, could then be understood. Finally, the characteristic features of the electronic properties of both the g-C3N4 systems were discussed. In this study, we have accurately described, for the first time, the selective oxidation process of aromatic alcohol on bare and nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 and identified the most reactive sites. Our theoretical work, therefore, provides a good understanding of the details of the mechanism and may lead to further improvement in the efficiency of the photocatalytic process."
1,Computational details,
2,Method,"2.1 Method All the calculations were performed using the PWSCF [55] program with a plane-wave basis set. We employed the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [56] to accurately describe the long-range forces between atoms. In the vdW-DF, the exchange–correlation energy ( E xc vdW ) can be calculated by (1) E xc vdW = E x revPBE + E c LDA + E c nl , where E x revPBE is the revPBE exchange energy [57], E x LDA is the LDA correlation energy and E c nl is a nonlocal (long-range) correlation term that approximates the vdW interactions. The interaction between the valence and core electrons was described by Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials [58]. The energy cut-off of the plane wave was set to 30 Ry. The total energy was minimised by using the Hellman–Feynman forces. All the examined systems were fully relaxed until the interatomic forces were reduced to less than 2 × 10−2 eV/Å. Periodic boundary conditions and a supercell approximation were applied. Two initial supercells (3 × 3) with 252 and 251 atoms representing the defect-free and nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4, respectively, were used. Both contained two layers of atoms, whose positions were allowed to change freely during optimisation. The region of vacuum above the surface was set to ca. 23.0 Å to be large enough to avoid interactions between periodic slabs. All the supercells with the adsorbed molecules were fully optimised using a 4 × 4 ×1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh [59] for integration in the first Brillouin zone. To calculate the total and projected density of states (DOS) linear tetrahedron smearing was used. The peak width for broadening was set to 0.05 eV for better visualisation of the plot of the DOS. The adsorption energy (E ads) per molecule was calculated from the relation (2) E ads = E g - C 3 N 4 − N vac + molecule − ( E g - C 3 N 4 − N vac + E molecule ) , where E g - C 3 N 4 − N vac + molecule is the total energy of the defective g-C3N4 supercell with the adsorbed molecule, E g - C 3 N 4 − N vac is the total energy of the surface supercell with the nitrogen vacancy, and E molecule is the energy of the isolated molecule. The molecular reference energies were obtained by optimising each molecule in a cubic box with dimensions of ca. 15 Å, sampling only the Γ-point of the first Brillouin zone. Within this definition, a negative adsorption energy (E ads) indicates an energetically favourable process. The same formula was used for adsorption on the defect-free system. All the calculations were spin polarised. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [60,61] with 14 and 15 intermediate images constructed for the rate-limiting step of the selective oxidation process on defective and bare g-C3N4 surfaces, respectively, was used to find the TS. This method allows the calculation of an energy barrier by using a set of linearly extrapolated configurations (images) linking the initial and final images. The forces acting on each image are transformed until the perpendicular component of the force between the images is zero. The simulations ended when the norm of the force orthogonal to the path was less than 0.05 eV/Å. The Bader charges [62] were calculated using the bader program [63] for the single point self-consistent-field calculations of the previously optimised structures using the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [64] with 80 and 800 Ry kinetic energy cut-off for the wave-functions and charge densities, respectively. All the figures were prepared by using the visualisation programs VESTA [65] and XcrySDen [66]."
3,The g-C3N4 bulk,"2.2 The g-C3N4 bulk g-C3N4 is a layer-type material and crystallises in different structures [67,68]. It can be viewed as a stacking of weakly interacting layers composed of sp2-bonded carbon and nitrogen atoms. In general, there are two main phases, namely, one built with triazine (C3N3) rings and the other with heptazine (C6N7) units, which consist of three fused s-triazine rings connected by nitrogen atoms. As reported by Ding et al. [23], the X-ray diffraction pattern reveals the existence of an in-planar tris-s-triazine structural packing, therefore, we performed all the calculations based on this type of lattice structure. However, the heptazine-based g-C3N4 can co-exist in a few phases [67], hence, for simplicity, we concentrated on the hexagonal crystal structure with ABAB-stacking, see Fig. 1 a. The primitive unit cell consists of 28 atoms (two stoichiometric C6N7 units with two linking N atoms) as shown in Fig. 1b. The optimised equilibrium lattice constants are a = 7.17 Å and c = 6.69 Å. These values are higher than the experimental data presented by Ding et al. [23] but are similar to those reported by Bojdys et al. [69] (a = 7.3 Å and c = 6.8 Å) based on the powder XRD pattern. The optimisation of the geometry was carried out for the model of a flat-layered structure whereas in the experiment a corrugated-layered (also called buckled) crystal structure was observed. In addition, some theoretical calculations clearly confirmed that such a corrugated structure is more stable than the planar one [53,54,70,71]. This geometric effect was taken into consideration in the construction of the supercell representing the slab by using a large supercell."

5,The g-C3N4 slab,"3.1 The g-C3N4 slab In this subsection, we present the structure models used for the description of the bare and defective g-C3N4 surfaces. All the supercells are shown in Fig. 2 . Owing to the weak van der Waals interlayer interactions in the g-C3N4 bulk, the surface is sufficiently well described by only one layer. The surface relaxations are very small and the atomic positions differ only slightly from their bulk positions. Therefore, such a one-layered model is usually assumed for the modelling of adsorbate-surface interactions. However, the aim of our study is to investigate the catalytic process on the bare as well as nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 surfaces; therefore, we included also a second layer in our slab models. The three unsaturated carbon atoms created after the formation of the nitrogen vacancy on the top layer were expected to interact with the layer below. Both the surfaces were thus modelled by using the (3 × 3) two-layer supercell, see Fig. 2a. The flat bare surface exhibits three different types of nitrogen atoms (see Fig. 2a): a twofold-coordinated nitrogen atom located at the edge of the cavity linked to two carbon atoms (N e ), and two three-fold-coordinated nitrogen atoms, one linking three heptazine units (N l ) and the other remaining at the middle of the heptazine unit (N m ). Both the types of carbon atoms are three-fold-coordinated, the one coordinated with two N e and N l is denoted by C l and the other coordinated with two N e and N m is denoted by C m . As a result, five distinct active sites can be distinguished on the flat surface, which exhibit different chemical properties and catalytic activities. The CN distances within the heptazine unit are 1.33, 1.34, and 1.40 Å for the N e C m , N e C l and N m C m bonds, respectively, whereas the N l C l bond is slightly longer and equal to 1.49 Å. These bond lengths are basically the same as in the bulk with an accuracy of a few thousandth of Angstrom. After the geometry relaxation of the slab system, the inter-layer distance increased by 0.07 Å. A corrugated g-C3N4 system is known to be more stable energetically than the flat one and exhibits slightly different electronic and optical properties [53,54,71]. Wu et al. [71] reported that such a corrugated structure for the heptazine-based sheet is energetically favourable by about 0.59 eV per unit; therefore, we examined this structure in our study. The forced geometry relaxation leads to a strong lowering of the total energy by about 0.99 eV. Moreover, the relaxation pattern is very similar to that previously presented for the triazine-based system [53]. Similarly, a significant rotation of the C6N7 units around the axis of the N l C l bond combined with an asymmetric distortion of the heptazine rings is also observed, see Fig. 2b. As a result, many new types of active sites, both in the C6N7 ring and at the edge of the cavity are observed, all of which are located at different heights along the z-axis with the maximum distance between the upper and lower atoms being 1.56 Å. The corresponding N e C m , N e C l , N m C m , and N l C l distances are slightly more differentiated and equal to 1.34–1.35, 1.34–1.35, 1.40–1.42, and 1.49–1.52 Å, respectively."
6,The g-C3N4-N vac slab,"3.2 The g-C3N4-N vac slab The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the experimental systems [23] indicates that nitrogen vacancies are mainly generated in g-C3N4 due to the deficiency of terminal amino groups (NH x ) with a different degree of polymerisation, in accordance with other results reported earlier [72]. Therefore, in our slab models, this type of vacancy was created by the removal of the N l atom (N vac ). In the experiment, the authors used for their catalytic studies the sample that represents rather moderate concentration of vacancies (CNNA(0.9)) that was included in the supercell construction. The formation of N vac on the surface of g-C3N4 requires the breaking of three N l C l bonds; hence, the geometry relaxation around the defect is large, see Fig. 2c. In the supercell representing this defective system, only one surface nitrogen vacancy was always created, thus, the minimal distance between the N vac vacancy and its periodically repeated image is 21.51 Å (3 × a). The relaxation leads to a lowering of the z-position of three unsaturated carbon atoms (to be denoted hereafter as C l vac ) together with increasing the van der Waals interaction strength with the conjugated π-system from the heptazine unit in the layer below. Moreover, the relaxation pattern shows that two of the C6N7 units come closer at the shortest C l vac ⋯ C l vac distance of 2.39 Å with a simultaneous increase in the distance of C l vac from the third unit (3.59 Å). The last heptazine unit shifted inwards the most and formed via the C l vac atom the shortest distance of 2.95 Å with the bottom layer, see Fig. 2c. Among all the bond lengths, the maximum changes around a vacancy site are observed for those linking the unsaturated C l vac and N e atoms, which are shortened to 1.31 and 1.34 Å, as compared to 1.34–1.35 Å on the corrugated bare surface. By contrast, the N e C m bonds are elongated almost by 0.04 Å whereas the N m C m bond lengths are within the range of 1.40–1.42 Å, which are the same as on the bare surface. The formation of the vacancy also causes the reduction of some N l C l distances (to 1.46 Å) of all the three heptazine units involved in its formation. Owing to the layer-type character of g-C3N4 some changes in bond lengths also appear in the second layer, but they do not exceed 0.02 Å and the relaxation is less pronounced in this case. The formation of the nitrogen vacancy and relaxation influence the oxidation state of the carbon atoms. The formal oxidation state of carbon is three in the bulk as well as at the stoichiometric surface; however, the creation of a neutral vacancy changes this state to two. Hence, the geometry relaxation leads to a distribution of the excess charge created by N vac over the neighbouring atoms. Further, the introduction of defects into the stoichiometric surface results in a decrease in the width of the band gap [54,73]. Fig. 3 shows the electronic band structures and the corresponding DOS plots of the bare and nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 surfaces (double-layer). The Fermi energy was set to 0 eV. Our calculated band gap for a defect-free g-C3N4 at the DFT(vdW-DF) level is smaller than the experimental value of 2.70 eV by about 0.90 eV in Ref. [23]. However, it is well known that the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) functionals underestimate the fundamental band gap energy [74]. As seen in Fig. 3, the introduction of N vac into the surface alters the band structure slightly and narrows the band gap of g-C3N4 by 0.20 eV. There is also a distinct reorganisation of bands due to the formation of the vacancy defect in the vicinity of the Fermi level (between −0.5 and 0 eV) in the DOS plot. Our results agree with the experimental trend showing that the systematic reduction of g-C3N4 via the introduction of nitrogen vacancies leads to a lowering of the band gap energy [23]."
7,PhCH2OH and O2 adsorption,"3.3 PhCH2OH and O2 adsorption A series of experiments conducted by Ding et al. [23] with different radical scavengers explicitly demonstrated that the photocatalytic selective oxidation of BA to BH with molecular O2 on a defective catalyst is primarily triggered by the holes and superoxide radicals. The conversion of the alcohol on g-C3N4-N vac is about 1.3% without light assistance at temperature 308 K [23]. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, both electrons (e −) and holes (h +) are generated in the sample. The photo-generated h + in the valence band activates the adsorbed alcohol; simultaneously, the photo-generated e − from the conduction band reduces O2 to O 2 − which then produces the OOH radical. The obtained OOH interacts with the alcohol radical leading to the formation of an aldehyde. However, the proposed mechanism is rather general and needs more details. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information about other products than BH during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, based on our calculations, we propose to show that the process of selective oxidation of alcohol on g-C3N4-N vac is more complex and different from that on defect-free g-C3N4. In the experiment, the formation of the alcohol and O 2 − radicals involves two steps, namely, the adsorption of alcohol/O2 on the surface in the dark and the oxidation/reduction of the adsorbates upon irradiation with light. To investigate the differences in the behaviour of PhCH2OH/O2 adsorption on the defective and defect-free g-C3N4 in detail, we considered different adsorption patterns. Along with the most energetically stable structure of the adsorbed alcohol, we developed the modelling of the oxygen interaction and identified the most stable structures corresponding to the individual steps of the purposed mechanism for both the catalysts. It is worth to mention here that the entire reaction was carried out in an acetonitrile environment [23], and the solvent was not included in our study. 3.3.1 PhCH2OH on g-C3N4-N vac In this section, we present the results of the investigation of different adsorption patterns of the PhCH2OH molecule on the defective surface, which include two main cases: (i) physisorption state via electrostatic forces, and (ii) dissociative chemisorption with the creation of two new bonds between the H and PhCH2O radicals and unsaturated C l vac sites Fig. 4 shows the most stable and characteristic configurations with the given E ads values. All physisorption states are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Materials (SM) (S1) for transparency. According to the proposed mechanism [23] the photo-generated h + activates the alcohol molecule leading to the creation of the alkoxy radical and a proton. Then both can interact with the C l vac sites by forming covalent bonds. Such a dissociative adsorption is hindered by an energy barrier, however, under the photocatalytic conditions this process can proceed without any barrier. In our previous work [53], we determined the energy of 1.79 eV needed for the decomposition of one H2O molecule with the resulting hydroxyl and hydrogen fragments being adsorbed on the neighbouring carbon and nitrogen sites on the defect-free g-C3N4 surface. Taking into account that the OH bond in a water molecule is stronger than that in BA and including the existence of the very reactive unsaturated carbon sites on the defective system one can expect here the much lower barrier. Based on this rationale, we considered the configuration (I vac−diss ) with two additional covalent bonds, namely, C l vac OCH2Ph (1.35 Å) and C l vac H (1.08 Å), denoted hereafter as PhCH2O* and H*, respectively, see Fig. 4. The obtained E ads of −5.79 eV, which is lower by 3.78 eV than that of the most stable physisorption state (V vac ), clearly indicates the dominant role of this structure at the beginning of the reaction path. The Ph group is oriented almost parallel to the surface combined with the formation of a weak hydrogen bond between the H atom from the Ph ring and the π-system of the heptazine unit (with a distance of about 3.7 Å). For comparison, we analysed the second dissociative structure (II vac−diss ), where the H* atom was moved to the neighbouring N e site in the same heptazine unit. However, such a configuration is less stable than I vac−diss by 2.45 eV, which confirms the high tendency of two-coordinate surface carbon atoms for maximum saturation. 3.3.2 O2 adsorption and OOH formation on g-C3N4-N vac Next, we established the most stable configuration of O2 in the close vicinity of PhCH2O* (I vac−diss ). This aspect is pivotal for a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism and the behaviour of the O 2 − species on the defective surface, in particular. We examined three different sites, namely, in the cavity (I vac−diss -I), above the heptazine unit (I vac−diss -II), and close to the unsaturated carbon site (I vac−diss -III), to determine the most stable adsorption configuration of the O2 molecule. After the geometry optimisation, O2 interacts with the surface only via electrostatic forces in the first two cases whereas in the third case, a covalent bond is formed between the unsaturated C l vac and O atom, see Fig. 5 a. The E ads are computed to be −0.55, −0.09, and −1.48 eV, respectively. In the first two cases, the calculated shortest O⋯N and O⋯C distances are within the range of 3.44–3.72 Å and the obtained OO bond distance of 1.24 Å is almost the same as for the gas-phase molecule (with an accuracy of a few thousandths of an Angstrom). In the third case, a significant elongation of the OO bond (1.37 Å) is combined with a strong reduction of the molecule. This is accompanied by electron transfer between the unsaturated carbon site and the attached O2 (denoted by O2*). The Bader charge analysis indicates that about −1.08e electrons are transferred from the C l vac site to O2*. We utilised the charge density difference, (Δρ(r)), to indicate the nature of this bonding as shown in Fig. 5b, where the yellow (blue) colour represents excess (deficient) regions of electron charge. The strong intensity of the yellow lobe on the oxygen atoms as well as the blue lobe in the midst of the C l vac O bond clearly reveal the covalent character of the new bond. In addition, the plot of the projected density of states (PDOS) was analysed to understand the electron transfer from the defective g-C3N4 to oxygen. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, the calculated PDOS shows clear evidence of the electron transfer effect where the antibonding 2π* O2 orbitals are partially occupied (spin-up) below the Fermi level. Consequently, the newly created C l vac O bond of 1.40 Å indicates that the most reactive sites on the defective g-C3N4 are unsaturated carbon atoms that have a very strong tendency to fill their coordination sphere. Based on our DFT calculations, the next step in the mechanism of the selective oxidation of alcohol on the nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 is the detachment of the H atom from the adsorbed BA resulting in the formation of BH. In the original studies of Ding et al. [23], there is a lack of information about the productivity and selectivity of other products (i.e. H2O2 or H2O) during the photocatalytic cycle; hence, in our comparison we refer only to the yield of PhCHO. Furthermore, it is very likely that this step determines the rate of its formation. It can proceed via either thermal assistance or can be supported by light, depending on the barrier height, see Section 4.3.2. In I vac−diss -III, the attached O2 with a partial negative charge is very reactive and expected to easily divert the H atom from PhCH2O*. The shortest calculated distance between the O and H atoms is 2.74 Å that should allow for hydrogen migration (path a). Such a process is energetically favourable with an energy gain of 0.42 eV. Thus, a BH was obtained as the final product combined with the formation of the OOH surface group, see Fig. 5c. The dihedral angle of the C l vac OOH link is approximately 11° with the H atom pointing towards the N e atom and forming a weak OH⋯N e hydrogen bond of 1.82 Å. The corresponding OO and OH distances are 1.49 and 1.00 Å, respectively. Both the bonds between the C l vac and O are equal to 1.36 Å. There is another possible path of migration (path b) of the H atom between the C l vac H and OOC l vac groups, as shown in Fig. 5c. However, this is less likely due to the energetically unfavourable creation of the unsaturated carbon site (0.70 eV relative to I vac−diss -III). Photocatalytic reactions are usually driven by oxidative intermediates, such as superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical or hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, Ding et al. [23] showed that the reaction did not proceed via hydroxyl radicals formation on the defective system. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of other products than BH during the catalytic route. Therefore, we are going to shed some light on this issue. For this purpose, we considered the formation of different products at the individual steps of the purposed mechanism and compared their relative energies. A similar modelling was carried out by Larijani and Khorshidian [75] for a series of nitrogen and boron co-doped graphene monolayers as electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction. The authors established a few pathways with H2O or H2O2 as the final product both originated from the attached OOH group. Consequently, the hydrogen atom from the C l vac H was moved close to the distal and proximal oxygen in the HOO link. In the first case, we observe the spontaneous formation of two hydroxyl groups attached to the two unsaturated carbon sites after the geometry optimisation (I vac−diss -IIIa-2OH*), see Fig. 5d. The energy gain of this step is 3.18 eV. Whereas in the second case, the water molecule was created as is presented in Fig. 5d. This configuration (I vac−diss -IIIa-O⋯H2O) with H2O located close to the centre of the cavity is less stable than that with the attached hydroxyl groups by 2.14 eV. The left O atom attached to the C l vac site may further abstract the H atom from the next chemisorbed BA molecule, and leaves the catalyst as a water molecule. However, the calculated energy indicates that this scenario is less likely to occur. Finally, the formation of the structure (I vac -2OH*⋯PhCHO) where PhCHO interacts electrostatically with the defective surface needs an additional energy of 0.76 eV. 3.3.3 O2 activation on g-C3N4-N vac and a competitive pathway for aldehyde formation In the last subsection, we determined the most stable configuration of O2 in the close vicinity of the chemisorbed alcohol molecule. On the other hand, the initial adsorption of oxygen molecule and its activation may lead to a competitive photocatalytic pathway. The reaction-promoting effect is induced by an electron excitation from the surface to the 2π* O2 orbitals upon light irradiation which facilitates the activation of the OO bond. As found previously, the most stable configuration with an E ads of −2.66 eV is the one in which O2 forms a covalent bond with the unsaturated C l vac site, denoted as N vac -O2* in Fig. 6 a. Due to the stronger relaxation around the nitrogen vacancy the obtained value is lower than that for an oxygen adsorption close to the chemisorbed PhCH2OH molecule by 1.18 eV. The calculated distance between the two oxygen atoms and the oxygen and C l vac site are 1.37 and 1.43 Å, respectively. Since the activation of oxygen molecule on the surface is a light-initiated process, the dissociative step should easily proceed. The final state was studied by consideration of two oxygen atoms attached to the two C l vac sites. The E ads of −8.46 eV was calculated with respect to the energy of the relaxed defective surface plus the energy of the oxygen molecule in the gas phase. This huge energy gain is connected with the formation of the C l vac O link C l vac link with the carbon–oxygen bond length of 1.41 Å (see structure N vac O link O* in Fig. 6a). The unsaturated oxygen site (denoted by O*) with an extra negative charge of −1.80e is very reactive; the O* bands are present at the Fermi level in the plot of the DOS. The first reaction pathway for the selective oxidation of BA proceeds according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism in which both the alcohol and oxygen molecules interact on the surface. Alternatively, the reaction may proceed through the Eley–Rideal mechanism where one of the reactants coming from the gas phase binds. Therefore, on the current stage of our modelling it seems reasonable to consider such possibility. The PhCH2OH molecule was originally placed above the surface at a distance of 1.5–2.2 Å with the OH group pointing towards the O* site, and then has been optimised. However, no activation of the OH bond was observed, instead, a stable physisorption state (N vac O link O*⋯PhCH2OH) with an E ads of −0.68 eV was appeared. In this configuration, the plane of the Ph ring is located above the heptazine unit, while the H atom from the hydroxyl group is placed directly above the O link site at distance of 2.40 Å, see Fig. 6b. According to the mechanism [23], the alcohol is activated by the photo-generated h + in the valence band of the catalyst through the OH bond breakage to form alkoxy and H radicals. The surface O* can interact with the H radical while the alkoxy radical can form a bond with the surface carbon site. The most stable site was found for the carbon atom (denotes as C s ) close to the O link site, while the other locations of the PhCH2O* group were either less stable or unstable. The energy difference between the dissociative (N vac O link OH*OCH2Ph*) and the nondissociative state is only 0.04 eV. Attachment of PhCH2O alters the hybridisation of the carbon site from sp2 to sp3. Hence, the bond lengths between the C s atom and the two nearest C and O atoms are 1.41 and 1.45 Å and 1.40 and 1.62 Å, respectively. The last value corresponds to the C s O link bond distance, whereas the second CO link bond is 1.35 Å. The key issue in the aldehyde synthesis via this pathway is to break the C s O link bond with a simultaneous detachment of the H from the PhCH2O* group by the O link atom. This transformation leads to the very stable I vac−diss -IIIa-2OH* structure with two hydroxyl groups (Section 3.3.2) with the energy gain of 1.77 eV. The above results show that there also exists a competitive pathway for the aldehyde formation via the initial activation of oxygen. 3.3.4 PhCH2OH on g-C3N4 The adsorption of PhCH2OH on the surface of the catalyst is a pivotal step of the oxidation process, therefore, analogous to the defective case, we conducted similar studies for the bare surface. Contrary to the defective case, the oxygen dissociative state on this surface was energetically unstable. In the first set of calculations, we studied the adsorption of the BA molecule on g-C3N4, including the physisorption as well as dissociative states. There were found ten different final structures which are shown in Fig. 7 . In four structures (I-IV) the plane of the Ph ring is oriented parallel to the surface, in two structures (V–VI) the PhCH2OH molecule is bound via the hydroxymethyl group to the surface, and the last four configurations (VII diss -X diss ) exhibit the dissociative adsorption pattern. All physisorption states are discussed in detail in the SM (S2). We analysed the dissociated chemisorbed states (VII diss -X diss ) to examine other possible adsorption patterns of PhCH2OH. In the next two structures, the PhCH2O group is bound to the carbon site (denoted hereafter as PhCH2O*) via C m in VII diss and C l in VIII diss , while the remaining H atom is attached to the neighbouring N e site (H*). These newly created C m O and C l O bond lengths are equal to 1.45 and 1.43 Å, respectively, whereas that of N e H is 1.03 Å. Both the dissociated configurations (E ads of −0.64 and −0.78 eV, respectively) are less favourable than the undissociated I (−1.01 eV). As the BA molecule interacts with the surface via the formation of the C l vac OCH2Ph and C l vac H links for g-C3N4-N vac , we also considered a similar case of adsorption where the H atom binds to the N l site (see Fig. 7). Such a structure (IX diss ) is apparently the most favourable one energetically among all those considered, with an E ads of −1.66 eV, which is lower than the most stable undissociated molecular state by 0.65 eV. In addition, we moved the H* atom from the N l to the neighbouring N e site (X diss ) for comparison, to check the stability of its structure. The unsaturated N l atom creates then a double bond with the C l atom slightly distorting the π-conjugated heptazine unit. However, such a configuration is less favourable than the previous one, only by 0.08 eV. The created C l O bond is equal to 1.33 and 1.34 Å whereas the N e H distance is 1.02 and 1.03 Å in the structures IX diss and X diss , respectively. Thus, we determined the most favourable configuration to be IX diss for PhCH2OH adsorption and used it as the initial state for further simulation of the catalytic cycle on the defect-free g-C3N4. 3.3.5 O2 adsorption and OOH formation on g-C3N4 As in the case of the defective surface, we analysed the adsorption behaviour of O2 on the stoichiometric surface in the close vicinity of PhCH2O* (IX diss ). We examined two adsorption configurations for the initial position of oxygen, namely, close to the Ph ring (IX diss -I) and close to the CH2O group (IX diss -II), see Fig. 8 a. The first configuration is energetically unfavourable with an E ads of 0.09 eV as compared to the second with an E ads of −0.31 eV, due to the relatively strong repulsive interactions between the conjugated π-electrons from the Ph ring and the antibonding 2π* O2 states. We also calculated the O2 adsorption on the bare surface and obtained an E ads of −0.34 eV with the oxygen molecule located at the edge of the cavity pointing to the N e site, which was almost the same as that for IX diss -II. This clearly indicates a weak interaction of O2 with PhCH2O*. It is to be noted here that the E ads was obtained for a highly corrugated surface, therefore, our finding is different from that reported by Aspera et al. [76] which was approximately −0.6 eV for the most stable configurations using the PBE functional; however, they used the planar structure as a reference to calculate the adsorption energy. The equilibrium distance between the O atom from the adsorbed O2 and the H atom from the CH2O group is 2.74 Å. In the next step of the oxidation process, the H atom is detached by O2 from PhCH2O*, leaving a PhCHO* molecule behind. Such a structure, denoted by IX diss -IIa, is less stable by 0.83 eV than before. Simultaneously, we examined the other path of formation of OOH, namely, by the N l H cleavage, denoted by IX diss -IIb, see Fig. 8b. However, such a possibility is even more unsuitable (1.92 eV relative to IX diss -II) as an unsaturated nitrogen site consequently was left. We thus showed that this reaction step is difficult to carry out in the absence of light. In the structure IX diss -IIa, two new hydrogen bonds were formed, one between the H from the aldehyde group and O from the radical, and the other between the H from OOH and the N e site. The corresponding H⋯acceptor(O, N e ) distances are 2.29 and 1.81 Å. Finally, we determined the structure with the PhCHO and H2O2 physisorbed, leading to an energy gain of 1.02 eV, in which the previously cleaved N l C l bond is restored."
8,Explanation of mechanism,"3.4 Explanation of mechanism The selective oxidation of PhCH2OH to PhCHO by using O2 as the oxidant and acetonitrile as the solvent on g-C3N4-N vac proceeds with a different efficiency as compared to that on g-C3N4 [23]. It was reported that a significant improvement in the yield of BH was strongly dependent on the number of nitrogen vacancies in the sample. For the optimal photocatalyst, the conversion of BA was 68.3% with almost 100% selectivity as compared to 36.3% (∼100%) for the defect-free system. The overall reaction of PhCH2OH oxidation on the bare and defective g-C3N4 catalyst is expressed as follows: (3) PhCH 2 OH + O 2 ⟶ PhCHO + H 2 O 2 As shown above, the process of formation of BH is different on both the systems. To illustrate this, we constructed the corresponding reaction pathways where each elementary step was selected based on the configuration with the lowest energy (the most stable one). As the photocatalytic reaction takes place in an acetonitrile environment we can exclude the solvent involvement in the process, as is the case of water [50,53,51]. The activation energy barrier for each elementary step must be known for the construction of a comprehensive energy profile. However, considering the relatively large size of both the systems, we used the CI-NEB method only for the postulated rate-limiting step. In addition, we estimated the energy barriers of the two BAs, with electron-donating (OCH3) and electron-withdrawing (NO2) groups, to confirm its dominant influence on the whole process rate and found the correlation with the reported aldehyde efficiencies [23]. The process is activated by light and the next steps can also proceed with light assistance (i.e. via heat transfer after the electron-hole recombination or a direct electron transfer). Therefore, for this step, we discussed the effect of photon excitation versus thermal activation to overcome the energy barrier. This section is presented as follows: First, we compare the two reaction pathways for g-C3N4-N vac and g-C3N4; next, an analysis of the activation energy barrier for the rate-limiting step is provided; and finally, a short discussion on the influence of activation energy on the catalytic performance is presented. 3.4.1 Energy profiles for the selective oxidation of PhCH2OH on g-C3N4-N vac and g-C3N4 The reaction pathways on both the catalysts are presented in Fig. 9 . The reference energy (the total energy of the catalyst, gas phase PhCH2OH and O2 molecules) is set to zero. In the discussion of the overall mechanism, we omitted the indication of the most stable configurations for transparency. The physisorption of PhCH2OH on the surface is considered to be the first step in the production of PhCHO. According to our calculations, the dissociative stage is energetically the most favourable in both the cases. Our findings showed that the adsorption energy for the defective surface is extremely favourable (−5.79 eV), however, the alcohol molecule was adsorbed on the surface of g-C3N4 with an energy gain of −1.66 eV. In the former case, the existence of a vacancy strongly increases the binding energy owing to the natural tendency of C l vac atoms to saturate dangling bonds by forming two additional links, C l vac OCH2Ph and C l vac H. According to the photocatalytic studies on this system [25], the dissociation of alcohol is a light-initiated process due to the generation of h + in the valence band of g-C3N4 that leads to alcohol activation followed by a breaking of the OH bond. Simultaneously, the O2 molecule captures the photo-generated e − from the conduction band and rapidly produces a superoxide radical. Therefore, the next step of the reaction involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on the surface in the close vicinity of PhCH2O*. On the defective system, O2 forms a covalent bond with the C l vac site, further lowering the total energy (−7.27 eV). Thus, all the dangling bonds after the formation of the N vac vacancy are saturated whereas on g-C3N4, the oxygen molecule is van der Waals bound to the surface (−1.97 eV). When both PhCH2O* and O2(*) are close to each other, the CH bond must be broken to form PhCHO and OOH. This is postulated to be the rate-limiting step of the BH production (discussed in the next subsection). For g-C3N4-N vac , the formation of aldehyde proceeds with a further energy gain (−7.69 eV), contrary to g-C3N4, where the total energy difference reduces to −1.14 eV, see Fig. 9. Further transformation of the defective structure leads to the very stable intermediate configuration with two hydroxyl groups (−10.87 eV). In our modelling, we also presented the second reaction pathway for the aldehyde formation leading to this structure via the initial activation of oxygen. After O2 adsorption (−2.66 eV) and dissociation, the structure with one oxygen (O link ) atom linking two C l vac carbon sites (−8.46 eV) is formed. The next step of this catalytic route involves the activation of the physisorbed alcohol (−9.14 eV) by the photo-generated h + in the valence band of the defective catalyst. This results in the dissociative adsorption pattern (−9.10 eV). Further reaction proceeds through the abstraction of the H atom from the PhCH2O* group by the O link atom. This leads to the previously discussed structure with two hydroxyl groups with the energy gain of 1.77 eV. In this pathway, this is the postulated rate-limiting step of the BH production. In Ref. [23], only the productivity and selectivity of BH were analysed, therefore, in our study, we refer only to the PhCHO efficiency. For the bare surface, the aldehyde adsorption combined with the formation of H2O2 (to rebuild the N l C l bond) was calculated to be −2.16 eV; the physisorbed state of PhCHO on the defective surface needs an additional energy due to the breaking of the C l vac O bond (−10.11 eV). Both PhCHO and H2O2 must be then desorbed from the surface to complete the catalytic cycle. Our profile of the reaction energy indicates that H2O2 cannot be easily removed from the nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 surface as two bonds created during the catalytic reaction must be broken to restore the initial catalyst. However, the total energy gain of the PhCHO formation (van der Waals state) is higher by at least 8 eV for this catalyst, see Fig. 9. 3.4.2 Energy barrier of PhCH2O* + O2 ⟶ PhCHO* + OOH step The calculation of the energy barrier for the postulated rate-limiting step allows for a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic process on both the catalysts. The aim of this subsection is to show the correlation between the height of the energy barrier for the detachment of the H atom from PhCH2O* with the reported yield of BH at temperature 308 K [23]. For the defective catalyst, we identified two competitive catalytic routes, both proceeding through this step. In one case (via the initial activation of BA) the H atom is abstracted by the oxygen atom form the attached O2, while in the second case (via the initial activation of oxygen) by the O link atom from the surface. Since one should expect very similar values of the barrier height of the transition state (TS) for both cases, therefore, we chose the first case. Our preliminary calculations using constrained optimisation confirmed it. As the energy barrier is very sensitive to the initial and final configurations of the simulated path, the most stable structures were used (see Fig. 9). The reaction barrier is reported with respect to the total energy of the initial structure and set to 0 eV. For g-C3N4-N vac , we considered the structure I vac−diss -III to be the initial configuration, the corresponding final state was the structure I vac−diss -IIIa, and the optimisation of the energetic pathway was then conducted (see Fig. 10 a). During the reaction path, the CH bond is weakened and a new OH bond begins to form that corresponds to the TS. Then, the H atom migrates to the oxygen atom leading to the formation of the surface OOH group. After the formation of the aldehyde, the total energy decreases by 0.42 eV. The smooth character of the obtained energy barrier of 0.67 eV implies a simple process. Contrary to the defective system, on g-C3N4, this step leads to an increase in the total energy by 0.83 eV, where the created OOH radical is van der Waals bound to the surface. The calculated energy barrier for the TS (1.65 eV) is about 1 eV higher than that for g-C3N4-N vac , which clearly indicates that the formation of PhCHO* is much more difficult in this case. Significantly, the weak interaction between the O2 and g-C3N4 surface yields a larger barrier for the formation of OOH as compared to the covalently bound oxygen on the nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4. More importantly, these results are in agreement with the reported BH efficiency, namely, 68.3% and 36.3% (∼100% selectivity for both) for the defective and defect-free catalyst, respectively. Our calculated TS energies are well below the threshold value of 2.7 eV (band gap of g-C3N4) required for the initiation of the process. Further, the activation energy barrier for the defective system can be partially overcome thermally without the need for photons. Finally, we calculated the corresponding energy barrier for a para-substituted BA by electron-donating (CH3O) and electron-withdrawing (NO2) groups on the defective surface. Both the initial and final structures corresponded to those for the unsubstituted alcohol. For p-CH3O-PhCH2OH, the energy barrier was calculated to be 0.33 eV whereas for p-NO2-PhCH2OH it was equal to 0.75 eV. We compared these values with the reported efficiencies [23], namely, 85.7% and 57.5%, respectively, to find the correlation between the BH yield and energy barrier for the TS. It is obvious that a lower barrier would correspond to a higher efficiency in the formation of BH (relative to 68.3%). This is related to the fact that the electron-donating (CH3O) group in the Ph ring results in the release of the H atom from the CH2O group more easily forming a more stable intermediate, thus accelerating the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde. The opposite relation refers to the case of the electron-withdrawing (NO2) group that leads to a decrease in the reaction rate. In the previous case, the CH breakage does not require photons as the activation barrier of 0.33 eV can be easily overcome with thermal assistance at temperature 308 K, whereas in the latter case, photons must participate in the progress of the reaction (most probably via heat transfer after the electron-hole recombination). To conclude, we point out that besides the energetic parameters, the electronic modification of the surface may significantly affect the observed reactivity. 3.4.3 Electronic factors Our results clearly indicate that the formation of BH is highly dependent on the structure of the surface and is facilitated by the presence of a nitrogen vacancy. The introduction of the N vac defect not only decreases the energy barrier thus increasing the reaction rate but also modifies the electronic properties resulting in a strong enhancement of the photocatalytic activity [23]. It is seen from Fig. 3 that the vacancy narrows the band gap of g-C3N4 by 0.20 eV and thus extends the range of visible light absorption. Consequently, the ability of optimal use of light is enhanced by the production of more photoelectrons to reduce the oxygen molecules as compared to the defect-free g-C3N4. Moreover, the existence of vacancies plays an important role in the trapping of photo-induced carriers, thereby suppressing their recombination. The recorded photoluminescence emission spectra [23] indicate that the samples with the defective system display the lowest probability of recombination of photo-generated charge carriers and longer intensity-average lifetimes."
9,Conclusions,"We performed DFT calculations to determine the role of nitrogen vacancies in the process of selective oxidation of BA to BH with molecular O2 on g-C3N4. Our results showed that the existence of vacancies strongly influenced the initial interaction of alcohol and oxygen molecules with the surface by formation of covalent bonds with the unsaturated carbon sites. We calculated two competitive catalytic routes on the defective surface. Moreover, in the case of the defect-free system, the dissociative adsorption pattern of BA was also more stable than the physisorption state. The main quantitative difference in the proposed mechanism of the alcohol oxidation was related to the interaction of O2 and OOH with the surface. In the nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4, both the species were bound to the surface through covalent bonds whereas in g-C3N4 they interacted via van der Waals forces. In general, these two interaction patterns determined the overall reaction energy profiles. We found that the formation of BH was energetically much more favourable on the defective than on the defect-free surface. We calculated the energy barriers for the postulated rate-limiting step, additionally included two para-substituted BA by electron-donating (CH3O) and electron-withdrawing (NO2) groups. The obtained values agreed very well with the reported trend of productivity of aldehydes [23]. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the nitrogen vacancies narrowed the band gap of C3N4 and thereby enhanced the production of photo-generated charge carriers. Therefore, one can further modify the structure of g-C3N4 to obtain commercial catalysts for the photo-degradation of common organic pollutants."
