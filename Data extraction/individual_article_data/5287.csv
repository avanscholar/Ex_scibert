0,Introduction,"The catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (syngas, CO/H2) derived from coal, natural gas, or biomass into ethanol and higher alcohols (C2+OH) has attracted great attention in the field of C1 chemistry [1–3]. Currently, several catalytic systems have been developed for the conversion of syngas to ethanol and C2+OH. Among these, supported noble Rh-based catalyst exhibit the best catalytic performance for the synthesis of ethanol but Rh metal is very expensive. As an alternative, much less expensive Cu-modified Co and Fe Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis catalysts as well as alkalis-modified methanol synthesis catalyst are considered as the most promising catalysts [4,5]. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, the Cu-modified F-T synthesis catalyst is not available due to the low total alcohols selectivity and the poor stability with long-term run for large scale industrial application [6–8]. Furthermore, methanol is still the dominant product over alkalis-modified Cu/ZnO methanol synthesis catalysts [9,10]. As well known, CuZnAl catalysts are usually employed for the synthesis of methanol from CO or CO2 hydrogenation [11–13]. Nonetheless, it is rarely reported that the syngas could be directly catalyzed to ethanol and C2+OH over CuZnAl catalyst without alkalis or Fischer-Tropsch elements (including Fe, Co and Ni). However, in our previous studies, it is found that the syngas could be directly catalyzed to ethanol over CuZnAl catalysts without promoters by a complete liquid-phase method in a slurry bed reactor [14,15]. This reactor has advantages of simple construction and lower capital requirement for a large-scale, excellent heat transfer performance, good temperature control, online catalyst replacement and withdrawal [16]. Unfortunately, it could not be clarified for this novel phenomenon of ethanol formation over the catalysts. Recently, our group found that Al species played an important role in the formation of higher alcohols [17,18]. Meantime, we also found that the acidity/basicity of the solution had a significant effect on the hydrolysis of aluminum isopropylate (AIP) in catalysts preparation, which would further affect the formation of higher alcohols. In addition, Heracleous et al. [9,19] reported that the reduced acidity was needed for the aldol-type condensation reactions and thus would promote the higher alcohols formation. It was also found that acid site was necessary for CO activation and concluded that optimum higher alcohols synthesis catalysts should have a balanced amount of acid sites. Zhu et al. [20] reported that the moderate basic sites favored the formation of higher alcohols. However, Zhu et al. [21] thought that metal-acid bifunctional could be balanced to catalyze the hydrogenolysis of CO bonds, and thus promoted the ethanol formation from the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO). Obviously, the acidity/basicity on catalysts surface has significant effect in the formation of ethanol and C2+OH. Thus, it is necessary to study the influence of acidity/basicity of catalyst surface on the synthesis of C2+OH over our novel CuZnAl liquid phase catalysts. Therefore, in the present work, non-metal promoted Cu-based catalysts were prepared with three kinds of non-metal promoters including alkaline triethanolamine (TEA), edetic acid (EDTA) and acidic tartaric acid (TA) by a complete liquid-phase method, respectively. The physicochemical property and catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Cu-based catalysts (atom ratio: Cu/Zn/Al = 2/1/0.8) with different non-metal promoters (equal to that of Cu molar content) were prepared by a complete liquid-phase method. The main innovation of this method lied in preparing catalysts directly from solution to the slurry without the traditional drying and calcination process. Typically, a certain amount of aluminum isopropoxide [(C3H7O)3Al] was added to distilled water with dissolved 6.4 g of citric acid to hydrolyze at 323 K for 3 h, then the solution of promoters was slowly added to the Al solution. After 30 min, the bath temperature was raised to 368 K and kept for 1 h. Next, solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in glycol was slowly added to the mixture. At last, the resulting CuZnAl solution was stirred at 368 K until a homogeneous sol was obtained. The sol was aged at room temperature for 10 d, then dispersed in liquid paraffin and heated under N2 atmosphere from 333 to 573 K with a heating rate of 5 K/min and maintained at 573 K for 8 h. As a result, a slurry catalyst was subsequently obtained. For convenience, the catalysts were abbreviated as C-X (X = TEA, EDTA, or TA). The CuZnAl catalyst without the addition of promoter was named as C-0."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Prior to characterization, the slurry catalysts were centrifuged, extracted by petroleum ether for 48 h to eliminate the effect of paraffin, and then dried at room temperature for 24 h to obtain the solid samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer in a 2θ range of 5–85° using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 100 mA) with a scanning rate of 8°min−1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (27Al-MAS-NMR) patterns were recorded on a Bruker Avance DSX 500 spectrometer with a 27Al frequency of 130.4 MHz. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) tests were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. The samples (50 mg) were purged with He (30 mL/min) at 423 K to remove physically adsorbed water, it was then reduced in a flow of 5 vol% H2+N2 (30 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 K/min up to 773 K. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the consumption of H2. The acidity and basicity of the samples were measured by temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD-MS and CO2-TPD-MS). First, the samples were reduced at 553 K in a flow of 5 vol % H2+N2 (30 mL/min) at 553 K for 30 min. After cooling to 323 K, the samples were saturated with pure NH3 for 30 min and then flushed with He flow to remove all physically adsorbed molecules. At last, the TPD experiments were conducted with a heating rate of 10 K/min under He flow (30 mL/min), and the desorbed NH3 molecules were detected and recorded as a function of temperature on a mass spectrometer. CO2-TPD-MS was carried out by the same procedure. Thermal decomposition of the catalysts was analyzed by Thermogravimetric (TG) method using a Setaram SETSYS TGA coupled with a hiden HPR20 QIC R&D mass spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., UK) equipped with Al Kα radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (10−7 Pa). The binding energies were calibrated internally by an adventitious carbon deposit C (1s)."
4,Catalytic activity tests,"2.3 Catalytic activity tests The synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas was carried out in a continuous-flow, high-pressure, slurry bed reactor. Prior to reaction, about 20 g catalysts were reduced in 20% H2/N2 at a flow rate of 75 mL/min under atmospheric pressure for 8 h at 553 K. After reduction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, then the reactant gas mixture composed of H2 and CO was introduced into the reactor under the reaction conditions of 523 K, 4.5 MPa and H2/CO = 2/1 with a flow rate of 150 mL/min. The steady-state activity measurements were taken after at least 24 h on the stream. The gaseous products were analyzed on-line with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using GDX-502 and TDX-01 columns, respectively. The liquid products were collected daily and analyzed offline using the gas chromatograph."
5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction,"3.1 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of catalysts with different promoters were presented in Fig. 1 . As seen in Fig. 1, all catalysts exhibited similar diffraction peaks of Cu0 and poor ZnO, revealing that the addition of promoters had little influence on the existing form of metallic phase structures in catalysts. The existence of Cu0 in the fresh catalysts was due to the partial decomposition of liquid paraffin causing the reduction of CuO, which had been reported previously by our group [15,22]. In addition, no oxidation state of copper was observed, but the following TPR characterization showed reduction peak. This was mainly due to that most of CuO had been reduced to Cu0, which led oxidation state of copper was below the detection limit of XRD. Moreover, it could be found that the intensity of diffraction peaks of Cu0 had little difference, which illustrated that promoters had little influence on Cu0 crystallite size. However, there were no peaks corresponding to Al species, this was probably due to that Al species were below the detection limit of XRD."
7,Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis,"3.2 Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Since the phase structure of Al species could not been detected using XRD, the 27Al-MAS-NMR experiments were conducted to further confirm the phase of the Al species of the four catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 , the 27Al-MAS-NMR spectra of the C-0 catalyst contained resonances at 8 ppm, corresponding to octahedral AlO6 site, which was consistent with AlOOH [23,24]. After the addition of non-metal promoters, the AlO6 resonance remained dominant, whereas the relative intensity of the C-TEA catalyst was stronger than that of others, which illustrated that the promoters could not change the phase of Al species, but only adjusted the degree of polymerization during the hydrolysis process of AIP."
8,H2 temperature-programmed reduction,"3.3 H2 temperature-programmed reduction H2-TPR profiles of different non-metal promoted catalysts were presented in Fig. 3 . It could be seen that there were two reduction peaks for the C-0 catalyst, which was similar to our previous study. The first peak was assigned to the reduction of surface highly dispersed Cu2O, and the second peak was attributed to Cu2O species which had strong interactions with Zn or Al oxide [14]. However, only a single reduction peak was detected after the addition of promoters, indicating that there was only one kind of reduction species. In addition, it could be seen that the reduction peaks of Cu2O species obviously shifted to lower temperature, which indicated that the Cu2O could be reduced more easily to Cu0 after the addition of promoters. Moreover, the peak area of the C-0 catalyst was greater than that of others, with H2 consumption increased in the order: C-EDTA < C-TEA < C-TA < C-0 (see Table 1 ), illustrating that C-0 catalyst possessed the maximum amount of reducible Cu2O. The results suggested that some Cu2O might be reduced to Cu0 when the promoters were added to the catalysts."
9,The acidity and basicity of catalysts,"3.4 The acidity and basicity of catalysts The acidity of catalysts was detected via NH3-TPD-MS and shown in Fig. 4 . One could see that only one peak at around 400 K (weak acid sites) was observed in all catalysts, which was assigned to the desorbed NH3 that adsorbing weakly on the surface of Al [25]. However, it was obviously seen that the peak area differed greatly after the addition of promoters. The peak area increased markedly after the addition of acidic TA, while it decreased greatly after alkaline TEA added. In order to confirm the effect of promoters on the acid of different catalysts, the number of acid sites was calculated and displayed in Table 1, it was found that the amount of weak acid decreased as pH value of non-metal promoters increasing. This implied that the amount of weak acid on Cu-based catalyst surface could be adjusted by the non-metal promoters. Heracleous et al. [9,19] found that the higher alcohols selectivity had inverse correlation with the amount of weak acid and speculated that the reduced acidity was needed for the aldol-type condensation reactions, and thus promoted the synthesis of the desired higher alcohol products, which was consistent with our activity performance and NH3-TPD characterization results. These results indicated that a suitable amount of weak acid favored the formation of higher alcohols, an excess of acid would promote methanol synthesis. CO2-TPD-MS profiles of different Cu-based catalysts were shown in Fig. 5 . As seen in Fig. 5, all catalysts had only one peak at about 680 K, which could be assigned to moderately basic sites and was ascribed to metal-oxygen pairs (such as ZnO or AlO) [26]. After the addition of promoters, it was obviously seen that the peak area of catalysts decreased, especially for the C-TEA catalyst, which suggested that the addition of promoters decreased the amount of basicity of catalysts surface. Zhu et al. [20] reported that the moderate basic sites favored the formation of higher alcohols. Tokunaga et al. [27] found that the addition of Na enhanced the basicity of the catalyst surface, and thus enabled the production of higher alcohols with high selectivity. But in our study, the amount of moderate basic obeyed the order: C-0 > C-EDTA > C-TA > C-TEA, whereas the selectivity of higher alcohols decreased in the series: C-TEA > C-0 > C-EDTA > C-TA, which suggested that there was no correlation between the amount of moderate basic and the selectivity of higher alcohols. The TPD characterization results illustrated the amount of weak acid rather than moderate basic played a key role in higher alcohols synthesis."
10,TG-DTG characterization,"3.5 TG-DTG characterization The TG and DTG curves of non-metal promoted Cu-based catalysts were presented in Fig. 6 . The thermal decomposition (weight loss) of the catalysts consisted of four steps. The first step at 353 K could be assigned to the elimination of physically adsorbed water. The weight loss for the second step at about 563 K was ascribed to the loss of layered structure water of catalysts. The strong step at about 710 K was responsible for the removal of both the hydroxyl groups from AlOOH to Al2O3 [28,29]. The last step at about 1073 K was considered to be the decomposition of Cu oxocarbonates [30,31]. The weight losses for the third and the last step were summarized in Table 1. It could be seen that after the addition of promoters, both the weight losses of the two steps increased. This was probably due to that the introduction of promoters during the catalyst preparation might adjust the acidity and basicity of the solution, which would affect the hydrolysis of AIP and the interactions among Cu and Al species."
11,XPS investigations,"3.6 XPS investigations Fig. 7 showed the typical Cu-2p XPS spectrum of the fresh catalysts. As observed, all spectra consisted of a principal peak at around 932.0 eV, which was the characteristic peak of Cu+/Cu0 species [32,33]. In addition, no obvious satellite peaks were observed at 940–945 eV, indicating the absence of Cu2+ in the four catalysts, which was in agreement with the XRD results. Surface composition of the fresh catalysts with different promoters was summarized in Table 1. It could be seen that the Cu concentration decreased after the addition of non-metal promoters, this might probably due to that the promoters covered the Cu sites on the catalysts surface. Combined with the following activity performance results, the variation trend of CO conversion was consistent to the Cu concentration on catalysts surface, illustrating that Cu species mainly acted as hydrogenation in the higher alcohols synthesis."
12,Catalytic activity,"3.7 Catalytic activity The catalytic performance of the non-metal promoted Cu-based catalysts towards CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols was summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . As seen in Table 2, the C-0 catalyst exhibited relatively high selectivity of C2+OH (36.0%), illustrating that the syngas could be directly catalyzed to higher alcohols over CuZnAl catalyst without promoters. After the addition of non-metal promoters, the CO conversion decreased, whereas the selectivity of total alcohols (ROH) increased. Notably, compared with the C-0 catalyst, the catalyst with alkaline TEA added exhibited higher selectivity of C2+OH (48.0%), while TA-promoted catalyst showed lower C2+OH selectivity (12.7%), and the C2+OH selectivity (30.1%) of C-EDTA catalyst was closer to that of C-0 catalyst. These results indicated that the alkaline TEA favored the formation of higher alcohols, whereas the acidic TA promoted the formation of methanol. Combined with the aforementioned of TPD results, the main difference of the four catalysts was the amount of weak acid on the catalysts surface, which illustrated that a suitable amount of weak acid might beneficial to the formation of higher alcohols. Meanwhile, combined with the above XPS characterization, it was speculated that a relatively higher Cu content was beneficial to hydrogenation in the higher alcohols formation. Product distributions of different Cu-based catalysts were compared in Table 3, it could be seen that the selectivity of PrOH, BuOH and PeOH were decreased after the addition of acidic TA, whereas the selectivity of PrOH, BuOH and PeOH all increased after alkaline TEA added. This might probably be due to that the promoters modulated the acidity/basicity of the catalyst preparation during the process of AIP hydrolysis, and then influenced the CC chain propagation, which further affected the formation of higher alcohols. Obviously, it could be concluded that these non-metal promoters with different pH values had significantly different effects on the formation of C2+OH. Therefore, how to adjust the acidity-basicity on the catalyst surface to obtain high selectivity of C2+OH and then clarify the catalytic mechanism required to be researched deeply in the future."
13,Conclusions,"The non-metal promoters had a significant influence on the catalytic performance of Cu-based catalyst for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. Based on the characterization results, it was concluded that the addition of non-metal promoters could made the catalysts easier to reduce, modulated the acidity/basicity and the Cu content on catalysts surface to change the activity and selectivity to C2+OH. Activity evaluation indicated that the syngas could be directly catalyzed to higher alcohols over CuZnAl catalysts without promoters. TEA favored the formation of C2+OH, whereas TA promoted the formation of methanol. It was speculated that a suitable amount of weak acid and relative higher Cu content on catalysts surface was beneficial to the formation of C2+OH."
