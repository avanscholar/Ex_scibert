0,Introduction,"Catalytic oxidation is a reactive pathway of utmost importance for the manufacturing of several starting materials employed industrially. More specifically, oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols into aldehydes and ketones, respectively, is a highly in-demand process in organic synthesis to obtain compounds of widespread interest for the pharmaceutical and food segments [1–5]. The efficiency problems associated with this oxidative process, both in an accessible and ecofriendly manner, are linked with: (i) the use of environmentally unfriendly oxidants in stoichiometric proportion; (ii) the employment of expensive noble metal-derived materials as catalysts; and (iii) the cleavage of C–H bonds of methylene/methine alcoholic groups in harsh and dangerous reactive conditions [6,7]. Thus, the development of new efficient catalysts based on abundant and non-toxic metals is one of the targets of synthetic inorganic chemistry, ensuring a vast research area for several oxidative processes that need to conciliate reactivity advancements and environmental improvements through catalysis [1–4]. Coordination polymers (CPs) are versatile materials with interesting structures and properties, which enables their use in different fields, such as, bioinorganic, analytical chemistry and catalysis [8,9]. CPs prepared with transition metals and hydrazone ligands, especially the ones based on isoniazid, have been attracting interest in recent years due their applications [10–14]. For example, hydrazone-transition metal CPs have shown cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines [15], catalytic activity in oxidation reactions [16] and sensor properties for the detection of metal ions and nitroaromatic compounds [17]. Copper is an essential metal, displaying important roles in reversable redox, electron transfer and oxygen transport processes. Due to the intermediate Pearson acidity of Cu2+ and Cu+, these ions can coordinate to ligands through soft or hard binding sites, forming mono- and polynuclear complexes with coordination numbers between 4 and 6 [18,19]. Thus, the diversity of copper chemistry, in conjunction with its abundance and low cost, has stimulated researchers to use copper-based compounds in different types of catalytic processes [20–23]. Even more, the study of hydrazone-copper complexes in oxidation processes still has room for contributions [23,24] and copper CPs can be used as more efficient and selective catalysts. Indeed, as demonstrated recently, systems based on aroylhydrazone ligands showed catalytic activity in the O-functionalization of aromatic hydrocarbons [25,26] and the oxidation of cyclohexane [26,27]. In this sense, this work reports the synthesis of a new coordination polymer based on an isoniazid Schiff base ligand and its characterization by elemental analysis, spectroscopic and thermal techniques. Also, the crystal structure of the coordination polymer was elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction and analyzed by Hirshfeld surface. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the material was evaluated in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to produce benzaldehyde (BzD), an important and expensive fine chemical used in food and pharmaceutical industrial sectors [28]."

3,Synthesis of HL,"2.2 Synthesis of HL The hydrazone ligand (HL) was synthesized according to conventional methodology [29,30]. The reactant 2-acetylfuran (2 mmol, 0.2 mL) was added to 20 mL of an ethanolic solution of isoniazid (2 mmol, 274.5 mg). The mixture was heated at reflux for 3 h. A crystalline product was obtained with the evaporation of the mother liquor at room temperature after a few days. Yield: 83.6 % (383.5 mg). Melting point: 196 °C.

4,Synthesis of [Cu(L)2]n,"2.3 Synthesis of [Cu(L)2]n Copper(II) acetylacetonate [Cu(acac)2] (0.05 mmol, 13.2 mg) was solubilized in 5 mL of methanol and added to 5 mL of methanolic solution of HL (0.1 mmol, 23 mg). The mixture was heated at reflux for 3 h, forming a green solid that was filtered and dried at room conditions. The product formed was recrystallized in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and green crystals were obtained after a few weeks. Yield: 54.6 % (14.2 mg). Melting point: 218 °C.

5,Crystal structure determination,"2.4 Crystal structure determination The data collection from the X-ray diffraction analysis of the complex [Cu(L)2]n was carried out on a Bruker CCD SMART APEX II single crystal diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The collected data were processed with SAINT program [31] and the absorption correction was performed with SADABS [32]. The structure was solved by Intrinsic Phasing using ShelXT program [33] and the non-hydrogen atoms had their positions determined with subsequent Fourier-difference map analysis. The refinement was performed with Least Squares minimization using ShelXL [34]. The material for publication was prepared using Olex2 [35], which was also used to solve and refine the crystal structure of [Cu(L)2]n. Table 1 presents the results of data collection and refinement obtained in the X-ray analysis."
6,Hirshfeld surface analysis,"2.5 Hirshfeld surface analysis The Hirshfeld surface (HS) and the 2-D fingerprint plots (FP) of [Cu(L)2]n were obtained from CrystalExplorer 17.5 program [36] using the crystallographic information file (CIF) of the complex. The dnorm surface was obtained through the normalized di and de surfaces, being mapped in the scale of -0.4814 (red) and 1.6872 (blue). The FP were generated in the scale of 0.8–3.0 Å with the combination of di and de surfaces, summarizing the contacts present in the crystal lattice of the complex."
7,Catalytic tests,"2.6 Catalytic tests Catalytic tests were performed in the liquid-phase oxidation of BzOH. In a typical assay, the desired amount of catalyst (1.05, 2.10, or 3.15 mol% with respect to BzOH) was transferred to a 10 mL glass reactor. Then, 48 μL (0.462 mmol) of BzOH and the required amount of oxidant (aqueous 30 wt.% hydrogen peroxide, H2O2; aqueous 70 wt.% tert-butyl hydroperoxide, TBHP; or di-tert-butyl peroxide, DTBP) were added. The glass reactor was closed and subjected to magnetic stirring and heating at the desired temperature (60, 70 or 80 °C) for 3 h in an aluminum dry bath block. After the assay, the liquid reaction was cooled at room temperature and exposed to MnO2 for quenching any residual peroxide not consumed. Details about the design of the catalytic experiments were given elsewhere [37]. Afterwards, the liquid-phase was centrifuged and an aliquot was taken for quantification by 1H NMR. Acetonitrile (CH3CN), acetone, dicloromethane (CH2Cl2) and DMF were tested as solvents. Also, kinetic experiments were performed during 6 h in order to optimize the time of benzaldehyde production. For the optimized reaction condition, a mechanistic assay was performed using ascorbic acid as inhibitor (1 mol% with respect to BzOH) to access the contributions of homolytic (or radical) pathways. As for the contribution of heterolytic (or peroxo) pathways, titration experiments were performed by UV–vis spectroscopy employing a 45 wt.% of TBHP solution as titrant and 5 mL of a 2·10−5 mol L−1 DMF solution of the coordination polymer as analyte. The catalytic assays were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy on a Bruker Magneto Oxford YH300 using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard (δ =0.00 ppm). 1H NMR spectra (300.072 MHz) were acquired with a spinning rate at 20 Hz, pulse length of 4.90 μs (π/4), 32 scans, and a delay recycle of 1.00 s. The determination of BzOH conversion (%C), product selectivity (%S), BzD yield (%Y) and turnover number (TON) was performed according to the normalization of areas method and equations described by Aiube et al. [37]."
8,Results and discussion,"The condensation reaction between 2-acetylfuran and isoniazid produced the HL ligand. The new coordination polymer, [Cu(L)2]n, was obtained from the reaction between HL and Cu(acac)2. The HL and [Cu(L)2]n were synthesized as indicated in Scheme 1 ."
9,Spectroscopic analysis,"3.1 Spectroscopic analysis The FT-IR spectra of HL and [Cu(L)2]n where obtained from solid samples of each compound and where compared with each other to verify changes in the vibrational modes associated to the coordination sites of the organic moiety. The infrared spectrum of HL (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material) exhibited bands at 3244 and 1667 cm−1, attributed to ν(NH) and ν(CO) vibrational modes, respectively. These bands were not observed in the spectrum of [Cu(L)2]n (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material), but the presence of a ν(CO) band at 1374 cm−1 suggests the coordination of HL to the copper(II) center in the enol tautomer form. The displacement of the ν(CN) band from 1602 cm−1, in the spectrum of HL, to 1581 cm−1, in the spectrum of [Cu(L)2]n, indicates the coordination of ligand to copper(II) through the N-iminic atom. Both spectroscopic features are indications that HL coordinates in a bidentated and monoanionic form. The in-plan deformation of the pyridyl ring portion appears as a sole signal at 756 cm−1 for HL, while such vibrational mode appears as two bands centered at 770 and 753 cm−1 in the spectrum of [Cu(L)2]n. The latter suggests the coexistence of this organic group in two different forms on the structure of the complex, i.e., coordinated and uncoordinated to copper(II) through the N-pyridyl atom. These results indicate the possibility of HL coordination as a bridged ligand, which were observed to similar complexes previously reported [38–40]. The electronic spectra of [Cu(L)2]n and HL (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material) were recorded from an ethanolic solution. The spectrum of HL presents a band at 311 nm with a shoulder at 266 nm, corresponding to n→π* and π→π* transitions, respectively. The hypsochromic shift of these transitions to 270 (n→π*) and 220 nm (π→π*) in the spectrum of [Cu(L)2]n, along with the appearance of a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition at 349 nm, further corroborates the coordination of HL to copper(II) ion, according with previous works [39,41,42]."
10,Crystal structure,"3.2 Crystal structure The coordination polymer [Cu(L)2]n crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system with the Pbca space group. The asymmetric unit of [Cu(L)2]n is composed by one copper(II) cation and two anionic ligands, as showed in Fig. 1 A. Selected bond lengths and angles were summarized in Table S1 (see Supplementary Material). The copper(II) atom is pentacoordinated in a distorted polyhedron and Addison’s parameter (τ) can be used to predict its geometrical environment [43]. This parameter is formally defined by the expression |β–α|/60°, where β and α are the biggest angles of the coordination polyhedron. A square pyramid geometry is indicated by a τ value closer to 0, while a τ value closer to 1 indicates a trigonal bipyramid geometry. The τ value for [Cu(L)2]n was calculated using the N1–Cu1–N4 angle of 166.42(10)º and the O2–Cu1–O4 angle of 155.62(10)º, showing a value of 0.18, i.e., a distorted square pyramid geometry (as showed in Fig. 1B). The basal positions are occupied by the N-iminic and O-carbonyl atoms from the hydrazone ligands, with distances of 2.029(3) Å (Cu1–N1), 1.955(2) Å (Cu1–O2), 2.034(3) Å (Cu1–N4) and 1.913(2) Å (Cu1–O4). The apical position of the pyramid is occupied by the N3′ atom of the pyridyl moiety from one HL molecule of another asymmetric unit, acting as ditopic ligand (corroborating FT-IR data) with Cu1–N3′ distance of 2.233(3) Å and accompanied with the symmetry operator (‘) 3/2+x,1/2+y,z used to generate equivalent atoms. Also, the Cu1–N3′ bond enables the formation of a one-dimensional polymeric chain (Fig. 1C). The hydrazone ligand is bonded to copper(II) through the Z-isomer mode in relation to the C5–N1 and C17–N4 bonds, acting as bidentated ligand. In addition, the enolic tautomer of the hydrazone was evidenced by: (i) the absence of a hydrogen atom bonded to the N2 and N5 atoms; (ii) the CO single bond character given by the values of 1.284(4) Å for C7–O2 and 1.285(4) Å for C19–O4; and (iii) the CN double bond character given by the values of 1.306(4) Å for C7–N2 and 1.304(4) Å for C19–N5, as described in literature [44,45] and in conjunction with the spectroscopic analysis presented previously (Subsection 3.1)."
11,Hirshfeld surface,"3.3 Hirshfeld surface The Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis is a popular approach used to investigate the intermolecular interactions in crystalline solids. It’s possible to map the HS using the distances between the surface and the nearest atom inside the surface (di) or outside the surface (de). A 2-D fingerprint plot (FP) can be generated combining di and de values to illustrate the interactions present in the crystal structure and their respective contributions [46]. The di and de surfaces can be normalized by the van der Waals radius and combined to generate the dnorm HS. Once there are few literature reports accounting this analysis for hydrazone-derivatives of isoniazid, we have performed both HS and FP to further understand the crystal packing of [Cu(L)2]n. Thus, the dnorm HS for the asymmetric unit of [Cu(L)2]n is represented in Fig. 2 , while the FP of the complex and its decompositions are showed in Fig. 3 . The red, white and blue areas in the dnorm HS correspond to interactions with shorter, closer and longer distance than the van der Waals limit of the atoms, respectively [46,47]. The red spots on the HS of [Cu(L)2]n (Fig. 2) shows the presence of C–H⋯C close contacts and of Cu–N bonds, which are the main responsible for constructing the one-dimensional architecture in the crystal structure of the coordination polymer. The FP of the complex and its decompositions in Fig. 3 indicated the contributions of other contacts for the crystal structure of [Cu(L)2]n. The decompositions revealed that H⋯H and C⋯H/H⋯C contacts are responsible for 38.8 and 27.1 % of the intermolecular contacts, respectively, being the ones with major contribution. On the other hand, the Cu⋯N/N⋯Cu contacts contribute to solely 1.7 %, even though the Cu-N bonds are responsible for the replication of the asymmetric unit throughout the 1-D polymeric chain."
12,Thermal analysis,"3.4 Thermal analysis The thermogravimetric curves (TG/DTG/DTA) of HL and [Cu(L)2]n are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. The information about all thermal decomposition steps for both compounds was listed in Table S2 (see Supplementary Material). For HL, the DTA curve in Fig. 4B evidences the existence of three endothermic events: (i) one peak at 201 °C, with no significant mass loss, attributed to the ligand melting point (196 °C with the melting point analyzer); and (ii) three peaks centered at 280, 353 and 610 °C related to HL decomposition in several organic moieties. TG/DTG curves (Fig. 4A), in alliance with the DTA curve, exhibited HL decomposition in two steps: (i) between 150 and 340 °C, with a mass loss of 87.6 % centered at 276 °C, attributed to the major moiety breakdown of the ligand, as described for certain isoniazid Schiff bases [48]; and (ii) between 340 and 1000 °C, with mass loss attributed to the steady evaporation of nitrogenous content in the residue of the previous step. For the latter, the broad peak at 610 °C in the DTA curve could be associated with the evaporation of simpler molecules at high temperatures, as described for condensation reactions in inorganic solids such as MCM-41 [37]. At the end of the thermogravimetric analysis, the alumina crucible contained a black solid that was attributed to residual coke. For the coordination polymer, the DTA curve displayed in Fig. 5B evidences a similar endothermic profile in terms of the identity of the already mentioned HL decomposition, i.e., [Cu(L)2]n melting point at 224 °C and ligand decomposition above 228 °C. Additionally, an exothermic peak centered at 228 °C was observed and attributed to the decomposition of residual solvent molecules (namely methanol) coordinated to the metallic center [49,50]. The TG/DTG curves (Fig. 5A) for this compound indicated that the thermal decomposition kinetics of the moieties in the ligand structure changed with complexation. As a result, [Cu(L)2]n decomposition showed four steps: (i) between 213 and 231 °C with a mass loss of 4.4 % centered at 227 °C, attributed to the evolution of solvent molecules; (ii) between 231 and 300 °C with a mass loss of 34.1 % centered at 267 °C, attributed to the loss of the 2-acetylfuran portion of both ligand molecules bonded to copper(II); (iii) between 300 and 367 °C with a mass loss of 25.5 % centered at 335 °C, estimated to be the loss of iminic and hydrazide functional groups; and (iv) between 367 and 1000 °C with a mass loss of 17.2 %, attributed to the breaking of the pyridinic moiety. This last decomposition step occurs at higher temperature because the aromatic ring is responsible for establishing the polymeric chain throughout the crystal structure, being the most thermally resistant moiety of the ligand. The total decomposition profile resembles the one reported by Alghool et al. [49] for an octahedral molybdenum complex with the ligand (E)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)isonicotinohydrazide. At the end of the thermogravimetric analysis, the alumina crucible contained a mixture of black and bronze solids, attributed as residual coke and metallic copper. Since the first mass loss attributed to ligand decomposition occurs above 231 °C with two peaks centered at 267 and 335 °C, the coordination polymer prepared in this work presents a higher thermal stability when compared to the free ligand."
13,Catalytic activity,"3.5 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of [Cu(L)2]n was studied in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH), an ecofriendly reaction with great potential to substitute the known processes for benzaldehyde (BzD) production [28,37]. Over-oxidation of BzD can occur in the process (Scheme 2 ), producing benzoic acid (BenzH) and benzyl benzoate (BenzBz), where the latter can occur by two common side pathways: (i) the oxidation of a hemicetal intermediate; or (ii) the esterification between BzOH and BenzH. To attain optimal selectivity towards BzD, achieving the best reaction conditions is of utmost importance, as demonstrated by other works in the field of coordination chemistry [51–53]. Thus, the following reactive parameters were tested and optimized towards conditions with highest BzD yield (%Y): oxidant type, solvent, alcohol-to-oxidant molar ratio, temperature, catalyst amount and time. The type of oxidant was the first parameter to be studied in solvent-free conditions: aqueous 30.0 wt.% H2O2, aqueous 70.0 wt.% TBHP and DTBP. The results are displayed in Fig. 6 A and, in all cases, only BzD and BenzH were observed as products. As one can see, TBHP was the oxidant with the best reaction results: 57.7 % of conversion (%C), 34.9 % of selectivity towards BzD (%SBzD), 25.9 % of BzD yield (%Y) and turnover number (TON) of 27.7 mol molcat −1. The lower performance observed with H2O2 (%C = 7.74 %; %SBzD = 43.6 %; %Y = 3.37 %) can be due to an exacerbated decomposition of the oxidant by the metallic center that could be noticeable from the evolution of bubbles in the liquid phase (i.e. formation of O2), turning the use of this peroxide less efficient for the desired process. On the other hand, DTBP did not demonstrate any appreciable conversion of the substrate. Even though it is known that the OO bond of DTBP is one of the most stable ones among organic peroxides [54], the assay may indicate that the best performance of TBHP in our experimental conditions can be due to: (i) the different formation of t-BuO and t-BuOO radicals from each oxidant [26,55]; or (ii) the lesser steric hindrance of the single tert-butyl moiety of TBHP upon the OO bond when compared to DTBP, allowing easier activation of the oxidant [54]. Even though it is desirable to perform catalytic processes without the aid of solvents, their role goes beyond being simple spectators, having importance in the adjustment of the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the medium [56,57] and in the generation of certain reactive intermediates [58]. Therefore, once established the best oxidant in solvent-free conditions (TBHP), the effect of four solvents on the generation of BzD was evaluated: CH3CN, acetone, DMF and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), see Fig. 6B. As shown in the latter, BzOH conversion and TON values were lower when compared to the solvent-free condition, which was attributed to a dilution effect of the components in the solvents tested. It is worth of mention that the coordination polymer is insoluble in water and in a variety of organic solvents, but it's partially soluble in ethanol, CH3CN and BzOH; and highly soluble in DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The only medium where dissolution of [Cu(L)2]n was not total by the end of the reaction test was in CH2Cl2, explaining the low BzD yield (11.0 %). On the other hand, even though DMF enables total dissolution of [Cu(L)2]n prior to the essay, its catalytic performance was the poorest (9.35 % yield). This result could be attributed to an exacerbated consumption of TBHP by the catalyst before the assay. A different behavior was observed in CH3CN and acetone, where [Cu(L)2]n only dissolved prominently after 2 h of reaction and showed the best BzD yields among the solvents tested. From the two solvents, CH3CN provided a condition with better %Y (36.9 %) than a solvent-free reactive medium (25.9 %), being a plausible choice in further optimization of the system. It can be perceived from the aforementioned that solvents with intermediate affinity with [Cu(L)2]n offered a gradual dissolution of the catalyst and an efficient production of BzD, whilst solvents with high or low affinity with [Cu(L)2]n adversely affected its catalytic performance. Indeed, Figure S4A (see Supplementary Material) shows that [Cu(L)2]n partially dissolves before the catalytic process, forming a biphasic system with the reaction mixture (BzOH, TBHP and CH3CN). At the end of the catalytic essay, the medium transformed into a light green monophasic system and the catalyst was completely dissolved (Figure S4B in Supplementary Material). In addition, a solubility test of [Cu(L)2]n in BzD revealed the same light green solution observed after the reaction test, indicating a high affinity between the coordination polymer and the organic compound. Thus, a better catalytic performance of [Cu(L)2]n can be achieved by tuning its gradual dissolution in the reactive medium with measures that includes the use of an appropriate solvent and the formation of BzD. Such effect due to the use of solvents is uncommon in literature, making this aspect unique in the catalytic behavior of [Cu(L)2]n. Before proceeding with the optimization of other reactive parameters, additional catalytic runs were performed with the four solvents already mentioned to assure that any catalytic enhancements can happen for the use of H2O2 as an oxidant due to the described solvent effect. The results are presented in Figure S5 (see Supplementary Material). As one can see, there was an enhancement in BzD yield in all cases (up to 6.41 % in DMF) with little effect of dilution in BzOH conversion (the only exception to both aspects was in CH2Cl2), but none of the figures were comparable to the ones observed for TBHP. Since dissolution of the complex was barely noticeable but the emergence of O2 was, once again, clearly visualized in each of the four assays, one can assume that the decomposition of H2O2 was the main reason for the persistence of low catalytic outputs with the latter. Thus, the use of H2O2 was discarded from the following experiments. After choosing the best solvent (CH3CN) and oxidant (TBHP), other reactive parameters were modified to evaluate the catalyst efficiency, such as BzOH:TBHP molar ratio, temperature and catalyst amount. The results of these assays are displayed in Table 2 . A graphic display of product distribution of each assay is available in Figure S6 (see Supplementary Material). Chemical equilibrium can impose effects towards the oxidant efficiency, being the first parameter optimized in this study. An excess of alcohol (2:1 molar ratio, run 2) resulted in a slight decrease on %C (35.5 %), TON (17.4 mol molcat-1) and Y% (23.2 %) when compared to the stoichiometric reaction (41.0 %, 19.7 mol molcat −1 and 36.9 %, respectively; run 1), making this condition less efficient towards BzD. When an excess of TBHP (1:2 molar ratio, run 3) was tested, a drastic increase of activity was observed (%C = 58.9 %, TON = 27.8 mol molcat −1), but BzD selectivity decreased considerably (54.1 %) due to over-oxidation of BzD, see Figure S6. Thus, the following essays were performed in a 1:1 BzOH:TBHP molar ratio. The next parameter studied was temperature, where its effect was visualized by varying its original value of 70 °C in ±10 °C (60 °C, run 4 and 80 °C, run 5). By decreasing to 60 °C, the catalytic outcome was less pronounced, as can be observed in the lower values of %C, TON and %Y (22.4 %, 16.7 mol molcat −1 and 11.0 %, respectively). Surprisingly, increasing temperature to 80 °C did not reflect enhancements in %C (40.9 %), but rather contributed to loss in %SBzD (70.7 %). The latter was attributed due to an over-oxidation at a higher temperature, as can be also noticed in the appearance of the ester BenzBz for the first time in this study (%SBenzBz = 8.10), see Figure S6. Hence, the optimization was continued with a temperature of 70 °C. The catalyst amount was also evaluated, where the initial quantity of 2.10 mol% (or 10.0 wt.% with respect to BzOH) was varied to 1.05 (5.00 wt.%, run 6) and 3.15 mol% (15.0 wt.%, run 7), see Table 2. Employing less catalyst resulted in a small diminishment of conversion (36.8 %) and an enhancement of active site usage (TON = 34.6 mol molcat −1). However, a decrease in BzD selectivity (81.6 %) and, consequently, yield (30.0 %), does not allow the use of 1.05 mol% as an optimal catalyst amount. The use of 3.15 mol% of catalyst offered a positive effect in BzOH conversion (42.7 %), but a negative one in BzD selectivity (77.2 %), once more with appearance of BenzBz (%SBenzBz = 3.50), see Figure S6. Therefore, the catalyst amount was fixed at 2.10 mol% where optimal BzOH conversion and BzD selectivity were found. To further study the catalytic system obtained in this work, kinetic analysis was performed to understand the evolution of the reaction process by monitoring BzOH conversion, product distribution, BzD yield and catalytic activity throughout 6 h, see Fig. 7 . The evolution of BzOH conversion (Fig. 7A) proceeds continuously up to the fifth hour (%C = 45.5 %), after which the alcohol consumption stops increasing significantly (%C = 46.1 % at sixth hour), indicating that the reaction attained equilibrium or that TBHP was completely consumed. In the same interval, BzD selectivity decreased from 100.0–70.2% (Fig. 7A), consequently over-oxidation by-products emerged. BenzH appeared at the end of the first hour (%SBenzH = 1.50 %) and increased up to the fifth hour (%SBenzH = 19.6 %), meanwhile BenzBz emerged discretely at the fourth hour (%SBenzBz = 2.80 %) and increased until the end of the kinetic study (%SBenzBz = 8.67 % after 6 h). Hence, reaction times lower than 4 h are important in avoiding the emergence of more by-products in the reactive medium. The progress of BzD yield depicted in Fig. 7B further corroborates and complements the aforementioned observations. The maximum yield of BzD was obtained at the third hour of reaction (%Y = 36.9 %), decreasing to 31.9 % in the fifth hour. Therefore, the ideal reaction time in which BzD production was accompanied by efficient TBHP harnessing was 3 h. Also, TON values (Fig. 7B) accompanies BzOH conversion, making the change in both parameters identical throughout time. The kinetic results for the catalytic performance of [Cu(L)2]n revealed an exceptional selectivity towards BzD (higher than 90.0 %) in moderate reactive times (up to 3 h) for BzOH oxidation under conventional heating at lower temperatures than 100 °C. Such characteristic is not often highlighted in literature when catalytic assays are performed with copper-based catalysts in the presence of peroxides. In fact, there are works that deals with catalysts based on copper(II) coordination polymers or copper(II) compounds based on hydrazone ligands that reported appreciable BzD yields [24,59–61], but usually under more elaborate conditions than in the one of this study either to achieve praiseworthy catalytic outputs or to attain selectivity towards a certain product. Thus, noteworthy examples in literature that are near our system in terms of reactive parameters and/or type of coordination compound are displayed alongside our optimized catalytic conditions in Table S3 (see Supplementary Material) so that a comprehensible comparison can be made to illustrate the range of elaboration and difficulty usually necessary to achieve selective oxidation conditions to BzD. In the case of hydrazone-derived copper(II) coordination compounds, it is common the use of additives in the presence of mild oxidants like atmospheric air and TBHP to allow both better oxidant activation and ignition of reactive pathways [24,59,60]. Since it is known that the oxidation of BzOH must undergo steps of H-elimination [62], employing radical initiators, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO), and basic additives, such as K2CO3 or KF, can assist in the catalytic process, and sometimes are necessary. In the case of the hydrazone coordination compounds synthesized by del Mar Conejo et al. [24] and Mahmudov et al. [59] (first and second entries, Table S3), the use of TEMPO is mandatory to observe any catalytic output for homogeneous aerobic BzOH oxidation. For the former work, just 14.0 % of BzD yield is observed after 6 h in toluene at 60 °C, while the latter account can only achieve quantitative conversion of the alcohol after 22 h in a 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of K2CO3 at 50 °C. Even with positive results such as in reference [59], our copper hydrazone-derived catalyst can attain selective oxidation conditions without the aid of such additives (%Y = 36.9 % in 3 h at 70 °C), a scarce result reported so far for hydrazone-derived coordination compounds regardless BzD yields. The use of microwave-assisted heating is also a common choice to improve results, such as has been demonstrated by Sutradhar et al. [60] for their mononuclear aroylhydrazone copper complex (third and fourth entries, Table S3). Nonetheless, an initial BzD yield of 19.5 % at conventional heating can only improve to 41.2 % (slightly above our optimized result) with microwave irradiation by additionally employing TEMPO at 120 °C and an excess of TBHP. In our case, elaborate heating methods, high temperatures and excess of oxidant are avoided to attain similar yields for BzD. Also, sometimes it can be difficult to achieve selectivity to the most valuable product in this process, BzD, with mild conditions, as exemplified for the copper coordination polymer prepared by Asgharnejad et al. [61] (fifth and sixth entries, Table S3). At room temperature, the maximum aldehyde yield achieved in their case was 28.0 % in CH2Cl2(%SBzD = 100.0 %); by heating the system at 40 °C, the favoring of BenzH increases significantly (%SBenzH = 73.0 %), dropping the yield of BzD to 18.4 % and making their described catalyst selective towards the less value-added product (BenzH). Thus, it is clear from these reports that conciliating selective conditions and praiseworthy catalytic outputs are a challenge in the area of oxidation reactions for fine chemistry purposes, and the hydrazone-derived coordination polymer here studied has offered remarkable results within simpler reactive interfaces than it is usually necessary for this type of catalyst, making it a promising compound for future studies in our research group. To unravel a possible mechanism for the BzOH liquid-phase oxidation, further experiments were performed in order to establish reactive pathways. A new assay was carried out in the presence of a small amount (1 mol% with respect to BzOH) of ascorbic acid, a radical/oxygen species scavenger (Table 2, run 8) [63–65]. As one can perceive, both alcohol conversion (20.7 %) and aldehyde yield (15.8 %) were considerably lower when compared to the optimized condition (%C = 41.0 % and %Y = 36.9 %). This result indicated the involvement of radical species in the reaction propagation and, consequently, that homolytic pathways are plausible routes for initiating the oxidation process [66]. In addition, the contribution of heterolytic pathways must be ensured as well. Thus, the possibility of formation of peroxo-copper intermediates, due to the reactivity of TBHP with [Cu(L)2]n, was studied by UV–vis spectroscopy [67]. The electronic spectra were acquired by registering spectral changes in [Cu(L)2]n solutions after adding consecutive amounts of a 45 wt.% DMF solution of TBHP, and they are displayed in Fig. 8 . In order to clarify and discuss the data, the following observations must be made for the UV–vis experiments: (i) aqueous 70 wt.% TBHP was diluted in DMF to 45 wt.%, so that the water present does not affect the solubility of the [Cu(L)2]n during the experiments; and (ii) a 2·10−5 mol L−1 solution of [Cu(L)2]n in DMF was the best concentration to visualize the LMCT transition around 349 nm. In Fig. 8, the first addition of 50 μL of TBHP solution increased the intensity of the LMCT band, which continued during successive additions of the oxidant. This effect can account to the formation of new Cu-O bonds after reaction between TBHP and the coordination compound, evidencing the catalyst’s reactivity with the oxidant. This evidence opens the possibility of the formation of peroxo-copper intermediates during the reaction, affirming the change of identity of [Cu(L)2]n in the catalytic processes [67–70]. The identity of these species has been debated in literature once the higher CuIII and lower CuI oxidation states becomes thermodynamically available in the reactive conditions [71,72], enabling a wide and complex range of redox pathways for the transition metal. Nonetheless, at least three of these species have been proposed in oxidative processes, like side-on CuIII-(μ-η2-peroxo)-CuIII, bis(μ-oxo-CuIII) and CuIII-O-O-H intermediates [71]. Since their detection and chemical identity are not easy tasks to perform with available analytical methods [68,71], the following mechanistic discussion will be made by representing these peroxo-copper intermediates in the generic form [Cu3+], with no intention to definitely attribute the involvement of any particular species whatsoever. From the evidence described previously and revising literature accounts [69,72,73], the mechanism for the liquid-phase BzOH oxidation studied in this work would involve the formation of t-BuOO and t-BuO radicals from TBHP catalytic decomposition. The latter would react with dissolved molecules of the catalyst to afford the proposed reaction pathway described throughout Eq.s 1–7. Initially, the coordination polymer dissolves slightly in the medium due to BzOH, described here as [Cu2+](solv) (Eq. 1). Then, [Cu2+](solv) would react with molecules of TBHP (or t-BuOOH) to afford t-BuOO and t-BuO radicals (Eq.s 2 and 3). Since the coordination polymer was not reactive with DTBP (or t-BuOOBu-t) as oxidant (see Fig. 6A), it is more plausible that there is a major contribution from t-BuOO than t-BuO in the beginning of the process [26]. Thus, Eq. 2 would be the most plausible reaction to propitiate the oxidation of BzOH, with t-BuOO being the main intermediate to generate carbon-centered hydroxo radicals (Ph-HC -OH, Eq. 4). Meanwhile, t-BuO radicals would be formed as secondary active species from the oxidation of [Cu+] with TBHP (Eq. 3), propitiating re-oxidation of the metal center. (1) [Cu(L)2]n ⇌ [Cu2+](solv) (2) [Cu2+](solv) + t-BuOOH → [Cu+] + t-BuOO + H+ (3) [Cu+] + t-BuOOH → [Cu2+](solv) + OH− + t-BuO (4) t-BuOO + Ph-CH2-OH → t-BuOOH + Ph-HC -OH (5) t-BuO + Ph-CH2-OH → t-BuOH + Ph-HC -OH (6) 2[Cu2+](solv) + t-BuOOH + 2H+ → 2[Cu3+] + t-BuOH + H2O (7) [Cu3+] + Ph-HC -OH + OH- → [Cu2+](solv) + Ph-HC=O + H2O The formation of peroxo-copper intermediates ([Cu3+], Eq. 6) would be responsible for the oxidation of Ph-HC -OH radicals to BzD (or Ph-HC=O, Eq. 7). The generated aldehyde would shift the solubility equilibrium in Eq. 1 towards the dissolution of the coordination polymer, which would enhance the concentration of [Cu2+](solv), reinitiating the whole mechanism and attaining high selectivity for BzD. The by-products BenzH and BenzBz would be formed by collateral reactions of t-BuOO and t-BuO radicals with the aldehyde through similar reactions as the ones described earlier."
14,Conclusions,"A novel copper(II) coordination polymer ([Cu(L)2]n) was synthesized with the ligand 2-acetylpyridineisonicotinichydrazone (HL), assembling in the crystal structure as one-dimensional chains. The spectroscopic and structural analyses showed that copper(II) ion was inserted in a pentacoordinated environment, with two hydrazone ligands coordinated to the metal center in bidentate and anionic modes through the N,O chelating system. One of the hydrazone molecules acts as a ditopic ligand, being coordinated to another copper(II) atom through the N-pyridyl atom, enabling the emergence of the crystal packing aforementioned. The thermal analysis for both HL and [Cu(L)2]n revealed that the biding of copper to the ligand alters the thermal behavior of the latter, whereas the metallic ion enhances resistance towards decomposition and fractionates the breaking of the chemical bonds of HL in definite steps. The catalytic activity of [Cu(L)2]n towards liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also evaluated, where it was evidenced high benzaldehyde selectivity (90.1 %) and considerable yield of the latter (36.9 %) in the presence of TBHP as oxidant and CH3CN as solvent. The catalytic behavior observed was attributed to the slow dissolution of the complex in the reactive medium as benzaldehyde was being generated, avoiding over-oxidation of the substrate and exacerbated decomposition of the oxidant as limiting shortcomings. Additional experiments suggested involvement of radical and peroxo-copper species in the oxidative process, being proposed a mechanism to explain the progress of the reaction in our experimental conditions. Overall, the optimized reactive parameters and catalytic output are consistent with milder and accessible conditions for performing ecofriendly oxidation of alcohols when compared with literature accounts, evidencing the importance of synthetic inorganic chemistry as an indispensable resource for achieving the improvement of important industrial processes in fine chemistry. Since the exploration of the coordination polymer’s catalytic potential has been done through homogeneous catalysis, the next step would be the immobilization of the compound on supports for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts."
