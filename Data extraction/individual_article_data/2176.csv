0,Introduction,"Conventional biogas processes have long been focusing on methane production. However, a two-stage anaerobic process producing both hydrogen and methane from organic waste material has been proposed (Benemann, 1996). In this two-stage process, acidogenic bacteria in the first stage convert substrates such as carbohydrates to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and fatty acids. The gaseous products exit the reactor and the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) enter the second stage where they are further converted to methane and carbon dioxide by methanogens. The overall products of the process are hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. The fundamental difference between the conventional methane fermentation (it may also adopt two-stage process) and the two-stage process of hydrogen and methane co-production is that the latter has a specific stage which is optimized for hydrogen production while the former is not. Hydrogen gas is generally more valuable than methane because it contains a higher gravimetric heating value and results in a cleaner combustion. It has been noted that combustion of a mixture of hydrogen and methane can reduce nitrogen oxides emissions when compared to the combustion of methane alone (Benemann et al., 2004). Fermentative hydrogen production has been reported intensively from a variety of substrates such as glucose (Nakamura et al., 1993; Logan et al., 2002), sucrose (Chang and Lin, 2004; Lin and Jo, 2003), starch (Zhang et al., 2003; Hussy et al., 2003), cellulose (Taguchi et al., 1995; Ueno et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2003), municipal solid waste (Lay et al., 1999), and wastewater (Roychowdhury et al., 1988; Yu et al., 2002). Typical conditions for continuous hydrogen production are a pH between 5.0 and 6.5 and a hydraulic retention time between 2 and 10h, depending on the characteristics and concentration of substrates and the reactor type used. A variety of organic materials have been studied and documented for methane production. The conditions for methane production are typically a pH ranging between 6.8 and 7.5 and a SRT ranging from several days to several weeks. Although the study and practice of individual hydrogen and methane production are widespread, there were only a few reports on the two-stage process of their co-production. A two-stage process consisting of a leaching bed reactor and an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to produce hydrogen and methane from dining hall food wastes was reported by Han and Shin (2004), and the hydrogen and methane yields of 0.31 and 0.21m3/kgVSadded were recorded. Kraemer and Bagley (2005) reported a two-phase process composed of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for hydrogen production and a UASB for methane production using a glucose-containing medium, this research was concentrated on recovering alkalinity in the effluent of the UASB by recycling this effluent to the hydrogen reactor. More recently, Ueno et al. (2007a) reported a two-stage thermophilic fermentation process for municipal garbage and paper waste digestion, the hydrogen and methane production rates were 5.4 and 6.1m3/m3/d. Cooney et al. (2007) reported that methane production in the two-phase anaerobic digestion process is more stable and effective than one phase process. It is obvious that more data related to the operating conditions and energy production potential for the two-stage co-production process has to be collected before it can be practically applied. According to the statistics of Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nation, world potato production reached 330million tones in 2004 (FAO Statistic Yearbook, 2004). A large amount of potato waste is produced each year from farming and food manufacturing processes. In this study, hydrogen and methane co-production from potato waste was investigated by using a bench scale model operated in continuous or semi-continuous flows."
1,Methods,
2,Preparation of the feedstock,"2.1 Preparation of the feedstock A simulated potato waste made from commercialized potato was used as the feedstock in this research. The potatoes (without washing and peeling) were homogenized using a Waring blender for 2min with proper addition of water. The resulting liquid mixture was then screened through a No. 40 mesh sieve to remove large debris. The solution obtained from the screen was heated at 70°C for several minutes in a water bath to further reduce and soften any remaining particles. Finally, the solution was diluted to a total solid (TS) concentration of approximately 10g/l."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Two anaerobic CSTR reactors (Bioflo 110, Brunswick Scientific, USA) were connected in series for the experiment. The first bioreactor had a working volume of 1l and was used for hydrogen production. The second bioreactor had a working volume of 5l and was used for methane production. The bioreactors were controlled separately for pH, temperature and agitation. The feedstock was stored in a tank placed in a refrigerator to maintain the temperature at 4°C. The feedstock was continuously agitated with a magnetic stirrer. Acid and base solutions of 2M HCl and 2M NaOH were used for pH adjustment. A MasterFlex multi-head precise peristaltic pump was used to feed and drain the hydrogen reactor. The effluent of the hydrogen reactor was directly pumped into the methane reactor. A three-way valve was installed in the tubing connecting the pump and the methane reactor. When methane reactor was operated in semi-continuous flow, the effluent of hydrogen reactor was wasted through the three-way valve without entering into the methane reactor during night. A second peristaltic pump was used to drain the methane reactor. The biogas produced from each reactor was collected separately in two cylinders using the water displacement method. The gas accumulated in the cylinders was sampled through a septum 4–7 times a day and analyzed by gas chromatograph."
4,Reactor start-up and operations,"2.3 Reactor start-up and operations Digested sludge taken from a local wastewater treatment plant was used as seed for both reactors. The hydrogen reactor was started up by pre-cultivating 200ml of seed sludge with 800ml of a sucrose medium in a batch reaction (Zhu and Béland, 2006). The composition of the sucrose medium was 10g/l sucrose, 1.5g/l KH2PO4, 3.2g/l Na2HPO4 ·7H2O, 0.5g/l NH4Cl, 0.18g/l MgCl2 ·6H2O, 1.0g/l yeast extract, 0.5g/l meat extract and 0.5g/l peptone. Prior to cultivation, the reactor was flushed with argon gas for 10min to ensure anaerobic conditions. The pre-cultivation was prolonged overnight to initiate the hydrogen producing activity. Once hydrogen was actively produced, the reactor operation was switched to continuous flow. In the first several days, the reactor was fed with a mixture of the sucrose medium and the potato feedstock for the bacteria to be acclimated for the new substrate. The ratio of potato feedstock in the mixture was gradually increased from 20% to 100% over the course of acclimation cultivation. Starting from the day the reactor was fed with 100% potato feedstock, the operation of this reactor was continued for 120 days except for a feed failure on Days 75 and 76. The methane reactor began operation on Day 16. No pre-cultivation was conducted for the start-up of methane reactor. Five liters of digested sludge were added to the reactor and flushed with argon gas for 10min. The reactor was then connected to the outlet of the hydrogen reactor. Two different operating phases were tested for methane production. In Phase I (from Day 16 to Day 90), the reactor was operated in a semi-continuous flow model. In this phase, the reactor was only fed and drained continuously from 9:00am to 5:00pm with the same flow rate as used for hydrogen reactor. In Phase II (from Day 97 to Day 120), the reactor was operated in continuous flow with the same feeding rate as the hydrogen reactor. The operation parameters for both reactors are outlined in Table 1 ."
5,Chemical analysis,"2.4 Chemical analysis A micro gas chromatograph (Agilent 3000, Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to measure the gaseous composition and concentration, including hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in the biogas produced. The GC was equipped with two columns (MolSieve 5A and PLOT U). The two columns were installed in two separate modules allowing temperature, carrier gas type and flow rate to be controlled separately. Module A equipped with MolSieve 5A was used for the measurement of hydrogen and methane. This module was operated with an injector temperature of 95°C, a column temperature of 100°C, and argon as the carrier gas at a pressure of 30psi in the column. Module B was equipped with PLOT U and used to measure carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Module B was operated with an injector temperature of 70°C, a column temperature of 70°C, and helium as the carrier gas at a pressure of 15psi in column. Both modules adopted thermal conductivity detector. The detection limits were 0.89% and 0.69% for hydrogen and methane, respectively. The carbohydrates in the culture liquid were examined using the anthrone method (Gaudy, 1962). A spectrophotometer (DR/2000, HACH) was used to determine the absorbance at 620nm. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and phosphorus in the form of phosphate (PO4-P) were measured using standard methods (Standard Methods for Water and Wastewater, 1998). Alcohols and VFAs in the liquid sample were analyzed in a second GC (5890 Series II Plus, Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE). The column used was a Restek, Stabilwax-DA column (30m×0.25mm with an inner diameter of 0.25μm). The carrier gas was helium and the flow rate was 1.2ml/minute at 0.77kg/cm2. A flame ionization detector was used as detector."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characteristics of the potato feedstock,"3.1 Characteristics of the potato feedstock The characteristics of the potato feedstock are presented in Table 2 . The values were the average of six measurements carried out during the experiment and corresponding standard deviation. The VS values (10.3g/l) were close to the TS values, indicating that organic matter composed the majority of the total solids in the feedstock. The relatively low soluble COD concentration indicated that most of the organic material was contained in the particles in the feedstock. The concentration of alcohols and VFAs was insignificant in the feedstock, less than 6.5mg/l (data not shown)."
8,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production The gas production rate observed from the hydrogen reactor once the feed was 100% potato feedstock is shown in Fig. 1 . The recorded rate was an average of several measurements (3–5 times) taken during the day. The maximum gas production rate recorded from this reactor was 270ml/h, which was observed on Day 17. The rate over the entire experiment was oscillatory with an average of 119ml/h. The hydrogen concentration in the biogas was 36–58% with an average of 45%. Overall, high hydrogen concentrations corresponded to high gas production rates. The methane concentration (not shown) observed in the biogas ranged from 0.1% to 1.4% with an average of 0.6%, indicating that a minor methanogenic activity existed in the hydrogen reactor. This amount of methane did not significantly affect hydrogen production. No hydrogen sulfide was detected. The average and maximum hydrogen yields from the TS added were calculated to be 30l/kg and 68l/kg, respectively. The maximum yield was similar to observations by Zhang et al. (2003) and Ueno et al. (2007a). The characteristics of the effluent of hydrogen reactor are presented in Table 3 . On average, VS was 5.0g/l with a removal rate of 52%, indicating that approximately half of the raw organic material was converted or stabilized during hydrogen fermentation. Total COD remaining was 10,250mg/l on average, resulting in a removal rate of 19%. The hydrogen produced from each liter of the feedstock (321ml) was equivalent to a COD of 230mg (Table 4 ), which represented approximately 2% of the total COD contained in the feedstock or 10% of the COD removed. The majority of the COD removed in this stage was not balanced by the hydrogen produced. Similar COD discrepancy was observed by other researchers (Van Ginkel et al., 2005; Ueno et al., 2007b). The exact cause of the discrepancy was not clear and probably multifold. There was hydrogen loss in the effluent. Although the hydrogen solubility is low, because the hydrogen reactor was stirred, many small hydrogen bubbles stayed in the liquid phase without being released and left the reactor with the effluent. Some volatile organic matters such as VFAs, alcohols and organic sulfurs might be lost in the gaseous stream. Some oxidants such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate entering the system with feedstock might oxidize certain amount of reductive substrates. The methanogenic bacteria residing in the reactor could consume certain amount of hydrogen. Those factors, as individual, may not be significant for COD removal, but by adding up a significant over all COD removal could be caused. Soluble COD in the effluent (7036mg/l) was higher than that in the feedstock, indicating that the suspended biomass material in the feedstock was largely hydrolyzed and solubilized during hydrogen production. On average, 75% of the soluble carbohydrate was removed resulting in a remaining carbohydrate of 144mg/l. The average concentrations of total alcohols and VFAs were 589 and 3619mg/l, indicating that VFAs made up the majority of the soluble products. Acetic acid and butyric acid were the dominant constituents of the VFAs, averaging 51% and 38%, respectively. Propionic and valeric acids made up the remaining 11%. The concentrations of the specific VFAs observed in this research were quite similar to those observed by Zhang et al. (2003) when a starch was used as substrate. The molar concentration and equivalent COD of these soluble products are tabulated in Table 4. The moles and the equivalent COD of hydrogen produced from each liter of feedstock are also displayed in this table. The molar ratio of acetic acid and butyric acid was approximately 2, indicating that the dominant metabolic pathway of the hydrogen fermentation was an acetic–butyric type which can be expressed as (1) C6H12O6 +H2O→CH3COOH+1/2CH3(CH2)2COOH+3H2 +2CO2 It should be noted that the average hydrogen produced from each liter of the feedstock was only 14.3mmol, much less than that predicted by Eq. (1). The maximum hydrogen yield observed in this research was 2.27 times of the average value, equivalent to one third of that predicted by Eq. (1). The observation of relatively low average hydrogen yield was consistent with the COD balance analysis result and could be explained by the reasons such as hydrogen loss in the reactor effluent or hydrogen consumption by other bacteria (e.g. methanogenic bacteria) residing in the reactor. The total COD equivalent of these liquid products was 6491mg/l, a fraction of 63.3% of total COD. The rest of the total COD could be balanced by the COD contained in suspended solids and other liquid products. It is important to note that hydrogen production strongly relied on the addition of fresh substrate. Hydrogen production slowed down immediately after the feed was stopped on Day 75 and stopped completely within 1h. Moreover, hydrogen production did not recover immediately after the feeding was resumed. Significant hydrogen production was observed on Day 80, three days after the feeding was resumed. This performance was quite different from the methane reactor, as discussed below. Similar oscillation of hydrogen production rate was recorded by other researchers as well (Hussy et al., 2003). It was possible that because hydrogen production is a quick reaction, small disturbances in feeding or operating conditions may cause a significant change on its production rate. This speculation was supported by the observation that the interruption in feed immediately slowed the hydrogen production. It could be another reason why the average hydrogen production rate observed was relatively low compared to the expectation by stoichiometry."
9,Methane production,"3.3 Methane production The gas production rate observed from the methane reactor is shown in Fig. 2 . As with hydrogen production, the rates were an average of several measurements (4–5 times) conducted during the day. During Phase I operated in semi-continuous flow, methane was produced continuously. There was no delay of methane production observed in the reactor start-up stage, demonstrating that the effluent of hydrogen reactor was readily usable for methanogenesis. The methane production declined until Day 45 and then stabilized at a lower rate. The average methane production rate observed in the steady state of Phase I was 141ml/h with a maximum rate of 187ml/h. The methane concentration in the gas produced was 69–81% (v/v) with an average of 76%. Gas production continued during the entire period of feed interruption (Days 75 and 76) without a significant decrease in production rate. The specific volumetric methane production rate was calculated to be 21.4ml/(hl) on average and 28.4ml/(hl) on maximum. The methane yield based on VS added in the reactor was 387ml/g on average and 513ml/g on maximum. This methane yield was higher than 0.32lCH4/gVSdegraded observed by Parawira et al. (2004) in a single fermentation process when a mixture of potato and sugar beet leaves was used as substrates. It was also higher than 0.388l/gCODloaded (maximum) observed by Ueno et al. (2007a) and 0.21l/gVSadded observed by Han and Shin (2004) in two-stage processes. The characteristics of the steady state effluent of the methane reactor are presented in Table 3. In the semi-continuous flow operation, the VS in the effluent was 3.1g/l with a removal rate of 38% in the reactor. The total COD remained was 4475mg/l on average with a removal rate of 62% in the reactor. The removed COD was balanced by the equivalent COD contained in the methane produced (7042mg/l as shown in Table 4), indicating that the methane production was the main cause for the COD reduction in the methane reactor. The soluble COD was 3325mg/l in the effluent and the corresponding removal rate was 51%, indicating that the hydrolytic products formed in hydrogen reactor were largely consumed in the methane production stage. The concentration of carbohydrates was reduced to 13mg/l. As shown in Table 3, the concentrations of the alcohol and total VFAs were 137 and 1017mg/l, much lower than what observed in effluent of the hydrogen reactor. Propanol was the most abundant alcohol, while acetic and propionic acids were the main constituents of the VFAs, at 41% and 48%, respectively. It is important to note that the dominant species were changed significantly compared with the hydrogen reactor. Propionate was largely detected while the butyrate was no longer significant in the methane reactor. The COD equivalent of the liquid products was 1692mg/l, composing a fraction of 38% in the total COD of the methane reactor effluent (Table 4). In Phase II (Day 98 to Day 119) operating in continuous flow, the maximum gas production rate was 146ml/h and the average rate was 79ml/h. These rates were much lower than those observed in Phase I. Adding the fact that the feed added in the reactor per day in Phase II was three times of what was added in Phase I, the methane yield in Phase II was much lower than that in Phase I. In the effluent, total amount of VFAs was as high as 5670mg/l, indicating that only small portion of the acids was converted to methane. Acetic acid was the most prevalent VFA, at 70%. It was obvious that the aceticlastic methanogens were washed out in this operation condition and caused the acetic acid to be significantly accumulated. The observation that the total VFAs in this reactor was higher than that in the hydrogen reactor effluent indicates that the hydrolysis in the hydrogen reactor was not completed and was extended to the methane reactor. Further optimization of operation condition of hydrogen reactor is required in a perspective of hydrolysis. The two-stage process during Phase I had an overall SRT of 96h, much shorter than that used in the operation of conventional methane reactor. In this condition, the hydrogen and methane co-production was achieved continuously with a high efficiency compared with the previous work. Overall 70% of VS and 64% total COD was removed in this process. Although a relative low average hydrogen yield in hydrogen reactor and relative high VFA remainder in the effluent of methane reactor indicated that further optimization for both reactors was needed, this process was demonstrated to be efficient and sound for biogas energy production and solid waste stabilization. A significant amount of base was required to control the pH in the hydrogen reactor, which would result in additional operating costs. These costs could be reduced by the use of tail water from the methane reactor as a replacement for the base. The high quantity of alkalinity in the tail water was reported to have sufficient capacity to reduce the base required for pH control by 34–45% (Kraemer and Bagley, 2005), although this operation would require further investigation to ensure that the conditions for hydrogen production are not compromised. The base consumption for pH control in the methane reactor would not be a significant problem if the HRT is long enough. In this research, pH control was once turned off for several days without causing significant deviation from the target pH. The pH in the reactor oscillated between 6.6 at the end of the feeding period and 7.2 at the end of the non-feeding period."
10,Energy yield from the potato waste,"3.4 Energy yield from the potato waste Based on the hydrogen and methane yields observed in this research (methane yield from Phase I operation), the average energy yield and corresponding maximum value (in parenthesis) obtained from each kilogram of TS (potato wastes) was calculated and tabulated in Table 5 . The densities of hydrogen and methane gas used for the calculation were 0.09mg/ml and 0.72mg/ml. The heating values of the hydrogen and methane used were 142kJ/g and 55.6kJ/g. The energy obtained from each kilogram of TS added was 7709kJ (on average) and 9874kJ (maximum), ca. 2.14kWh and 2.78kWh, respectively. Of the total energy produced, only approximately 5% of the energy was from hydrogen production. If the hydrogen production efficiency can be further increased to a level as observed as maximum rate in this study, the hydrogen energy could be 10% of the total energy produced from this co-production process. In the perspective of the energy yield, the hydrogen fermentation was not competitive with methane production. However, hydrogen is a more ideal energy source than methane, and the hydrogen production reaction is faster. More importantly, as demonstrated in this research, the hydrogen production could improve the methane production and overall digestion efficiency. This could be an important advantage of this novel two-stage co-production process and should be evaluated further."
