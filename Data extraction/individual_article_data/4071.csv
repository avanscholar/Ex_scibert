0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting by renewable energy has been regarded as an efficient and environmentally friendly method for sustainable production of clean fuels in a long time [1,2]. The large-scale application of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been limited due to the relatively high costs and low reserves of the noble metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt). Transition metals and their compounds (nitrides, sulfides, phosphides, selenides and hydroxides) have been extensively studied as cathodic hydrogen evolution catalysts [3–8], of which transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have drawn tremendous attention for the unique conductivity and high electrocatalytic performance [9–11]. For instance, the Co0.8Fe0.2P nanosheets reported by Wang’s group exhibited the good OER performance with a small overpotential of 270 mV versus a rotating hydrogen electrode at a current density of 10 mA•cm−2 and low Tafel slope of 50 mV•dec−1 in the alkaline electrolyte [10]. On the other hand, a larger active surface can be exposed and more facile HER kinetics can be realized by optimizing the morphology, composition and crystal phase, consequently the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution catalyst will be improved [12–15]. Doping different elements (including metals or non-metals) into catalysts is one of the effective methods to change the electronic properties and improve the catalytic performance. For example, Xue et al. successfully synthesized N-doped CoP2 for efficient HER in an alkaline electrolyte [11], and first-principle calculation revealed that the partial replacement of P with N not only facilitates electron transfer but also optimizes the Gibbs free energies of H* , H2O, and OH* adsorption on the active sites, thus facilitating the HER process. Liu et al. developed porous transition metal doped tungsten phosphide (M-WP, M = Mo, Co) catalysts as enhanced HER electrocatalysts in comparison with pristine WP [16]. Owing to the incorporated transition metals, the as-prepared M-WP nanomaterials exhibit porous nanostructures, abundant active sites and reduced charge transfer resistances. First-principle calculation further demonstrated that the Co dopant simultaneously facilitates the Tafel-Heyrovsky hydrogen evolution process and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption free energy during the entire HER [16]. Due to the unique properties of 4 f orbital electrons, rare earth elements have been widely studied not only in optics, electricity and aeronautical engineering [17], but also in electrochemical catalysis applications. Recent advances in the successful alloying of rare earth elements (such as Ce, Pr, Gd) and their oxides with other metals and their combination with other transition metal compounds showed that rare earth elements can significantly improve the HER, oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) properties of corresponding materials [18–24]. For example, Wang et al. found that the coupling between Ni/CeO2 interface and carbon nanotubes can improve the HER performance [19]. By DFT calculation, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption can be ajusted approach zero eV and the decomposition of water can be accelerated by the coupling between Ni/CeO2 interface and carbon nanotubes. Shao et al. first found that perovskite oxides can be used as the HER catalyst [24]. Compared with pure δ-phase Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ, the catalytic performance and stability of A-site doped (ABO3-type) perovskite oxides Pr0.5(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ have been significantly enhanced. This work proved that the addition of Pr ions can create more HER active sites, which boosts the overall catalytic activity. These studies showed that the introduction of rare earth elements into the lattice can effectively adjust the electronic structure and lattice structure, improve the catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts, thus open up a new way to achieve efficient electrochemical energy conversion and improve the catalytic performance of the electrodes. In addition, before electrochemical testing, polymer binders (such as Nafion, PTFE) were used to make the powder catalyst firmly loaded on current collector in most reported electrocatalysts, but their low conductivity usually increases the resistance of composite catalysts [25], blocking the active sites and inhibiting the diffusion of H+, thus reducing the effective catalytic activity [26]. However, if electrocatalysts are grown directly on current collector to form a three-dimensional self-supporting electrode, the polymer binder can be avoided [27]. The direct growth without polymer binder has many obvious advantages, including reducing the series resistance and improving the mechanical adhesion between catalyst and substrate. Carbon cloth, nickel foam (NF), etc. are commonly used as the growth substrates that need to meet the following requirements: well compatibility with catalytic materials, great stability and high electrical conductivity. Among transition metal phosphides, NiCoP has desirable catalytic activity but its low electrical conductivity increases the overpotential of HER [28–34]. Inspired by the fact that rare earth elements can effectively regulate the electronic and lattice structures of materials, doping Pr into NiCoP is expected to manipulate the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption via redistributing charge. Herein, a novel Pr-doped NiCoP nanowire arrays grown on NF was successfully designed and fabricated through a facile hydrothermal reaction and low temperature phosphating process. The morphology characterization and electrochemical performance tests were used to analyze the effect of Pr doping and confirmed that the introduction of Pr actually enhanced the exposure of the active surface and improved the electrical conductivity. Besides, the influence of different Pr additive molar amount (0, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) on morphology and HER performance was studied. When the additive molar amount of Pr is 10%, the Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF could drive the current 10 mA•cm-2 in 0.5 mol•L-1 H2SO4 and 1 mol•L-1 KOH electrolyte only require overpotential of 91 and 88 mV, and the corresponding Tafel slope were 45.5 and 69.2 mV•dec-1, respectively. Therefore, such Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF electrode materials hold considerable potential for using as the high-performance hydrogen production devices."
1,Experimental section,
2,Samples preparation,"2.1 Samples preparation 2.1.1 Materials and reagents Commercial nickel foam (NF) was purchased from Cyber electrochemical materials Co., Ltd. All the applied chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Among them, cobalt acetate (C4H6CoO4, 99.5+%), praseodymium nitrate (PrN3O9, 99.0 +%), urea (CH4N2O 99.0+%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 96.0+%), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, 99.0+%), commercial Pt/C were bought from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd, China. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.0～38.0%), sulphuric acid (H2SO4, 95.0～98.0%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96.0+%) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF Firstly, 10% diluted HCl was used to remove the oxide layer on the surface of NF (3.1*3.0 cm2), then NF was ultrasonic cleaned for 30 min with deionized water and alcohol respectively, and dried in about 60 min at 30 ℃. PrN3O9 with different amount, C4H6CoO4 (Co+Pr atomic concentration is 50 mmol•L−1, additive amount of Pr˭Pr/50), 300 mg CH4N2O and 50 mmol•L−1 NH4F were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water to obtain pink solution. Then the water solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the NF was placed vertically in the solution. The autoclave was then sealed and heated to 120 ℃ for 15 h. After cooling to room temperature, the NF after hydrothermal reaction was collected and calcined at 300 ℃ for 2 h. Finally, Pr-doped NiCoO nanowire arrays grown on NF were obtained (Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF). 2.1.3 Synthesis of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF The prepared Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF precursor was placed in the ceramic boat, and the ceramic boat with NaH2PO2 (the molar ratio of total metal to P is 1:5) was placed on the upstream side of the airflow, 2 cm away from the Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF precursor. Then the tube furnace was cleaned with argon (Ar, 99.99%) to remove impurities. The precursor was heated at a heating rate of 5 ℃•min−1 to 300 ℃ and holding for 1 h under the protection of Ar gas flow (15 sccm). After cooling to room temperature, Pr-doped Ni-Co-P nanowire arrays grown on NF (Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF) were obtained. For the samples doped with 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% additive amount of Pr, they are named 5% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, 15% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF and 20% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, respectively. 2.1.4 Synthesis of NiCoP NWAs/NF As a contrast, NiCoP NWAs/NF (NiCoP NWAs/NF) were prepared in the same way as Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF but only stop using PrN3O9 during the hydrothermal synthesis process of Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The phase composition of the samples was identified by X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD, D/max-RB, Japan; Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 10–80° under a continuous scanning mode with a scanning rate of 6°/min at an incidence angle of 1° of the X-ray. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN Compact, America), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 UTWIN, America) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB MKII, Thermo VG Scientific Ltd., America) was employed to investigate the chemical state of the elements, in which the results were calibrated by the binding energy of C 1 s line (284.8 eV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a typical three-electrode system by employing CHI660E electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China). When the electrolyte was 1 mol•L−1 KOH, graphite electrode (99.995%, Tianjin Ida Hengsheng Technology Development Co., Ltd.), mercuric oxide electrode (Hg/HgO) and the as-prepared sample were used as the counter, reference, and working electrode, respectively. The potentials were corrected to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with correction via the following equation: ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 *pH – iRs, and therein Rs is contact resistance. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode and the potentials were corrected by the equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.241 + 0.059 *pH – iRs when the electrolyte was 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4 and 1 mol•L−1 PBS. The geometric area of the sample measured in the electrochemical tests was 1 cm2 (1 cm*1 cm). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a sweep rate of 2 mV•s−1 after initial stabilization of the polarization curves. For comparisons, the catalytic performances of the pristine bare NF, NiCoP NWAs/NF and Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, Pt/C (loaded on CC, load mass 2.7 mg•cm−2) were also studied. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was perfomed at different scan rates, i.e., 10, 20, 40, 60, 80,100, 120, 140, 160 mV•s−1 between the potential window from 0.1 to 0.3 V (vs. RHE). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with a 5 mV AC potential perturbation, recording under the potentiostatic control of 348 mV, which is the potential of the 10% Pr doped NiCoP at the current density of 10 mA*cm−2. The stability test was performed by a repetitive LSV at 50 mV•s−1 for 1000 cycles and also evaluated by a chronopotentiometry measurement (E vs t) at 10 mA•cm−2 for 24 h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra and the corresponding lattice constants of NiCoP NWAs/NF and Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF. In Fig. 1a, the diffraction peak at 44.5°, 51.7° and 76.3° corresponds to the phase of metal Ni (JCPDS No. 04–0850), which is due to the existence of nickel foam substrate. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the corresponding XRD spectra of both Pr-NiCoP NWAs and undoped NiCoP NWAs coincide with those of hexagonal NiCoP (JCPDS No. 71–2336). The diffraction peaks of 40.8°, 47.5°, 54.3° and 55.1° correspond to the (111), (210), (300) and (211) planes of NiCoP, respectively. With the variation of additive amount of Pr, the diffraction peaks of NiCoP phase shift slightly. To further analyze the influence of the introduction of Pr on the lattice, the lattice constants a and c of Pr-NiCoP with different additive amount of Pr are shown in Fig. 1b. When Pr enters the lattice of NiCoP, the lattice distortion occurs. Whereas the lattice constants change little, which is consistent to the XRD patterns. The XRD results supports the assertion that the doping of Pr doesn’t change the phase of NiCoP of the as-prepared samples. Fig. S1 shows typical undoped high magnification SEM images of NiCoO NWAs/NF and Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF with different additive amounts. The nanowires in serried rank can be seen obviously from the Fig. S1. It can be found that both NiCoO NWAs/NF and Pr-NiCoO NWAs/NF (see Fig. S1) have the morphology of nanorods, however, the Pr-NiCoO NWAs were more slender and denser. It indicates that the morphology of as-prepared samples can be regulated by the doping of Pr. The typical low and high magnification SEM images of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF were depicted in Fig. 2a-b. It can be seen that the Pr-NiCoP NWAs distributed uniformly on the surface of NF from Fig. 2a. Contrasting the SEM images of NiCoO with NiCoP (see Fig. S1 and Fig. 2b), it can be found that the morphology of samples changed from nanorods to nanowires after the phosphating process, which interweave with each other to form the nanowire arrays and present the porous spongy-like structure. By comparing the SEM images in Fig. S2, various Pr additive amount of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF exhibits different loose degree of spongy-like structure. Among them, the nanowires of 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF were thinner and denser, which effectively increased the exposed surface area. The Pr-NiCoP nanowires can be separated by ultrasonic treatment on Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, as shown in Fig. 2c. The diameter of the NiCoP nanowires is about 70 nm, and the surface of the nanowires is rough. The clear and interlaced lattice fringes can be seen in HRTEM (see Fig. 2d). It is found that the interplanar spacing of these crystal faces is 0.173, 0.280 and 0.221 nm, which is consistent with the (300), (101) and (111) planes of NiCoP, respectively. In order to further explore the distribution of elements on the Pr-NiCoP nanowires, element mapping is demonstrated in Fig. 2e-f. It can be seen that Ni, Co, P and Pr elements are uniformly distributed in nanowires, which indicates the Pr has been successfully doped in NiCoP NWAs/NF. The elemental composition of 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF was further analyzed by XPS. Fig. S3 presents the XPS survey spectrum of the 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF. The characteristic peaks of praseodymium, nickel, cobalt, carbon, phosphorus and oxygen could be clearly identified from this figure, indicating that the sample is composed of them, therein carbon might be originated from the vacuum chamber of the testing equipment. The atomic proportion of P, C, O, Co, Ni, Pr elements is shown in Table S1. In the high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p (see Fig. 3a), the peaks of 853.2 and 856.4 eV correspond to Ni 2p3/2, while the peaks of 861.2 eV can be attributed to the satellite peaks of Ni 2p3/2. Two peaks of 870.4 and 874.2 eV belong to Ni 2p1/2. The binding energy of 879.8 eV is the satellite peak of Ni 2p1/2. The peaks at 856.4 and 874.2 eV correspond to Niδ+ (0 <δ < 2), and the peaks at 853.2 and 870.4 eV can be ascribed to Ni3+ [34–36]. Among them, the formation of Ni3+ can be caused by partial oxidation of samples, while Niδ+ can be attributed to NiCoP. Similar to the Ni element, the Co element (see Fig. 3b) can also be divided into two valence states: Coδ+ (784.4 and 799.8 eV) and Co3+ (781.8 and 797.7 eV), 786.7 and 802.9 eV corresponding to the satellite peaks of Co element [35–37]. In addition, the peak of 130.0 eV in the P 2p region (see Fig. 3c) was observed to be the binding bond between P and metal in NiCoP. The peak at 133.8 eV originates from the phosphorus oxides produced on the surface. In the Pr 3d region (see Fig. 3d), it is obvious that the peak at 931.0 eV belongs to Pr 3d5/2, and the binding energy of 954.0 eV is consistent with Pr 3d3/2 [24]. From the above data, it can be seen that Pr elements were successfully doped into NiCoP nanowires."
7,Electrocatalytic performance,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance Here, the Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF was used as the working electrode directly, and the HER performance was tested in the 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte. Meanwhile, the NiCoP NWAs/NF and pure NF were compared. Moreover, iRs compensation was used to eliminate the influence of ohmic resistance on the catalytic performance, so as to obtain the intrinsic catalytic activity. Fig. 4 a shows the polarization curve of the corresponding catalysts. It can be seen that the pure NF exhibits poor HER performance. And the undoped NiCoP NWAs/NF reaches 10 mA•cm−2 in acid condition with the overpotential of 123 mV while Tafel slope is 64.0 mV•dec−1. It is noteworthy that the hydrogen evolution performance of the electrodes is further improved after Pr doping into NiCoP. The electrocatalytic performance was greatly influenced by the additive amount of Pr and reaches the best when the additive amount of Pr is 10% [38,39]. The overpotentials corresponding to the current densities of 10 and 100 mA•cm−2 are 91 and 142 mV in the 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4, respectively. The Tafel slope of 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF is 45.5 mV•dec−1, suggesting the HER process belongs to Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Therefore, the doping of Pr can effectively improve the HER performance of NiCoP NWAs/NF. In order to further reveal the reason why Pr doping improves the hydrogen evolution performance of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, EIS analysis was carried out for Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF with 5%, 10%. 15%, and 20% addictive amount of Pr to explore their electrochemical kinetics. Pure NF and NiCoP NWAs/NF were also studied for comparison. From the Nyquist curve shown in Fig. 4c, it can be seen that all the electrodes present small and similar series resistance (Rs, high frequency intercept of X-axis). The series resistance of each electrode is about 1.26 Ω (approximate to the model value 1.292 Ω). This resistance mainly comes from uncompensated electrolyte resistance. The similar resistance value shows that our experimental settings and conditions are consistent. The electrocatalytic kinetics of different electrodes can be reflected by their charge transfer resistance (Rct, curvature of capacitor semicircle) and lower Rct corresponding to faster reaction rate [40]. From Fig. 4c, it can be seen that the radius of the semicircle of 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF is smaller than that of others, indicating that 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF has the minimum Rct and quickest charge transfer kinetics. Also, moderate introduction of Pr to NiCoP NWAs/NF can enhance the electrochemical kinetics at the surface of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, which is conductive to the occurrence of HER process and consistent with the results of the electrocatalytic performance test in 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4. To further analyze the experimental data, the electrical equivalent circuit model “R(QR)(CR)” has been applied to model the experimental results (see Fig. 4c). The experimental data were represented by points and the model results were exhibited in solid lines on the same graph to prove their consistency. The model results revealed that there were two interfaces existed in the transmission of protons, including the interface between the solvent and the catalyst and the interface between the catalyst and the Ni foam substrate. Due to the porous surface of the samples, “QR” is used instead of “CR” to model the double layer capacitance of charge transfer process. The charge transfer resistances and capacitive parameters of the 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF were 2.375 Ω and 0.02794 F, respectively. In addition, the exposure of more catalytic sites may be another reason for the improvement of HER performance of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF. According to the previous studies, the number of catalytic active sites can be roughly corresponding to the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) [41]. In order to measure the ECSA value of the Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF, the cyclic voltammetric curves (CV) were scanned at different scanning rates to calculate the double-layer capacitance (Cdl). At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that there is only Faraday process in the tested voltage range. Because of the proportional relation between ECSA and Cdl, the corresponding ECSA value can be compared by Cdl. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Cdl of pure NF, NiCoP NWAs/NF and Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF with 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% additive amount of Pr are 19.3, 34.0, 71.7, 82.0, 52.4 and 33.4 mF•cm−2, respectively. The higher Cdl revealed the larger ECSA, representing the more active sites exposed by 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF compared with other prepared samples. This can be attributed to its porous sponge-like nanowire arrays structure. In addition, the larger specific surface area is also conducive to the rapid transport of ions and electrons in the electrolyte, resulting in the faster reaction kinetics [42], and ultimately a better HER performance. It is noteworthy that the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction is far more difficult than that of hydrogen evolution reaction, and alkaline electrolyte environment which is more favorable to the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction is usually used in the actual process of decomposition of aquatic hydrogen production [43]. For some microorganisms and enzymes, the neutral environment can guarantee the stability of the catalyst [43]. Therefore, the development of hydrogen evolution catalysts for full pH has become a new research hotspot. In order to investigate the electrocatalytic HER performance of Pr-doped NiCoP NWAs/NF in full-pH electrolyte, 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF were used to test the hydrogen evolution performance in 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4, 1 mol•L−1 KOH and 1 mol•L−1 PBS electrolytes, respectively. Fig. S4 shows that 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF exhibits good hydrogen evolution performance both in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The overpotential corresponding to current density of 10 mA•cm−2 are 91 and 88 mV and the corresponding Tafel slope is 45.5 and 69.2 mV•dec−1 in the 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4 and 1 mol•L−1 KOH, respectively. Because the poor kinetic process in the neutral electrolyte, 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF has almost no catalytic capacity for hydrogen evolution. In addition to catalytic activity, electrocatalytic stability is also an important indicator of catalyst performance. The long-term stability of 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF catalyst was determined by continuous scanning 1000 cycles and Chronopotentiometry in 0.5 mol•L−1 H2SO4 and 1 mol•L−1 KOH, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4e, the change of overpotential in acidic electrolyte or alkaline electrolyte at the same current density after 1000 cycles is negligible compared with the initial scanning. From Fig. 4f, it can be seen that in alkaline electrolyte, the overpotential at current density of 10 mA•cm−2 remains stable after 24 h of long reaction. While in acidic electrolyte, the obvious decrease of overpotential occurs in the first hour, which may be caused by the activation of the surface of the electrode in the early stage. Overall, the 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF catalyst maintained stable overpotential after continuous cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometric measurements, indicating that the 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF catalyst had good catalytic stability."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF were prepared via a facile two-step strategy: hydrothermal reaction and low temperature phosphating process. The porous spongy-like structure of Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF facilitated the exposure of active surface, provided a high-speed channel for the transport of H* , H2O, and OH* during electrocatalysis and promoted the release of gases generated from the surface of catalysts. The doping of Pr element effectively modulated the morphology on the surface and enhanced the electrical conductivity to realize the fast reaction kinetics and high electrochemical activity. To catalyze the HER under acidic and alkaline conditions, the 10% Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF achieved 10 mA•cm−2 at the overpotential of 91 and 88 mV, and the corresponding Tafel slope were 45.5 and 69.2 mV•dec−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the Pr-NiCoP NWAs/NF exhibited excellent long-term stability and durability both in acid and alkaline media. This study provides a promising avenue for designing and utilizing efficient and stable HER electrocatalysts."
