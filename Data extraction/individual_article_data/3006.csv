0,Introduction,"The fuel cell vehicles present several advantages compared with the internal combustion engine vehicles including less CO2 emission and less energy cost [1]. Also, the hydrogen energy adopted in the fuel cell vehicles has high energy density and little impact on surroundings, while the fossil fuel destroys environment and will exhaust in the near future [2]. However, a major challenge for the commercialization of the fuel cell vehicles is the hydrogen supply. An available approach [3] to overcome this challenge is developing a compact fuel processor to produce hydrogen on board by reforming reactions, such as methanol [7], alcohol [4–6] and so on. Among these methods for hydrogen production, on-board methanol steam reforming has attracted significant interest because of its low reaction temperature, good miscibility with water, high hydrogen concentration and lower carbon monoxide concentration in the reformate gas [8]. To obtain high-performance on-board methanol steam reforming system, several types of reactors have been proposed and studied in recent years. Kolb et al. [9] have revealed that the plate reactors have better performance than the cylindrical reactors due to the intensification of the heat and mass transfer. Among all kinds of plate reactors for hydrogen production, the micro-channel reactors provide higher specific surface area, heat and mass transfer rate and controllability [10]. Therefore, the micro-channel reactors for hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming have received increasing attentions from the academic community all over the world. Park et al. [11] have developed a micro-channel methanol steam reformer with the dimension of about 70 mm×40 mm×30mm, which could generate adequate hydrogen for a 15W fuel cell. Kunda et al. [12] have proposed a MEMS-based micro-fuel processor, and found that the serpentine channeled micro-reformer has better performance than the parallel channeled one for hydrogen production. Zhou et al. [13] have fabricated a novel micro-channel reactor using porous copper fiber sintered felt as the catalyst support. The new catalyst support used in their micro-channel reactor enhanced the adhesion of catalyst, improved the catalyst life and increased the methanol conversion. For thoroughly examining the performances of the reactor, many experiments need to be carried out, which are very time-consuming. Consequently, modeling and numerical studies are usually adopted to get a deep understanding of the heat and mass transfer in a micro-channel reactor for hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming. During the past decades, many numerical models have been used in the analysis, including one-dimensional models [14–16], two-dimensional models [17–21] and three-dimensional models [22,23]. The mass and heat balance equations have been adopted by Kawamura et al. [14] to design a micro-channel reactor and successfully simulate the methanol conversion and the species concentration in the reformate gas. Suh et al. [19] have proposed a two-dimensional model to analyze the transport phenomena in a methanol steam reformer. The simulated results based on this model were found to agree well with the experimental results. They also found that higher methanol conversion and carbon monoxide concentration can be obtained with internal heating. Hsueh et al. [22] have used a three-dimensional model to study the effect of the geometrical structure and the thermo-fluid parameters on the methanol conversion and the efficiency of the micro-channel reformers. Their simulated results revealed that a low aspect-ratio micro-channel and a reasonable operation situation can enhance the performances of the micro-reformer. Hsueh et al. [23] have studied the performance of a plate methanol steam micro-reformer with serpentine flow field design using a three-dimension model. They found that the conduction through the wall has a crucial effect on the temperature distribution and needs to be considered in the analysis. They also found that the methanol conversion is higher with top plate heating than with base plate heating. Although the structural designs and the models of the micro-channel reactors for hydrogen production have been widely studied, the high fabrication cost and the relatively low performance are still challenges regarding the commercialization of this technique. In this study, a micro-reactor with micro-pin-fin arrays (MPFAR) was designed to increase the energy density. The catalyst support of the micro-reactor was fabricated based on micro thixo-forming technology, which could significantly reduce the fabrication cost for mass production. To quantitatively analyze the catalytic performance of the micro-reactor for hydrogen production, the numerical studies were carried out for the heat and mass transfer through the micro-pin-fin arrays in the micro-reactor. In addition, experiments were conducted to test the performance of the micro-reactor and validate the accuracy of the numerical model."
1,Design and fabrication of the MPFAR,
2,Design of the MPFAR,"2.1 Design of the MPFAR A novel MPFAR was proposed to enhance the compactness of the reactors, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 1 . The larger surface area of the MPFAR than the plate-typed micro-channel reactor benefits the methanol steam reforming (SMR) reaction for hydrogen production. The micro-reactor is composed of a catalyst support, a chamber, a cover plate to connect with the inlet and outlet tubes and a heated plate. The catalyst support is a metal plate with cylindrical micro-pin-fin arrays, and the heights of the micro-pin-fins are uniform as well as the center-to-center distance between each two micro-pin-fins. The catalyst used for methanol steam reforming is coated on the catalyst support. The chamber is a metal plate with a rectangular groove for mounting the catalyst support and two right triangle flow manifolds for homogenizing the flow field. The heated plate is used to install the cartridge heaters for heating the micro-reactor, and the material of the heated plate is A356 to ensure that the material of the wall contacted with reagent is identical. The cover plate with a material of stainless steel is used to connect with inlet and outlet steel tubes, and the sealing method between them adopts the argon arc welding. The chamber with the catalyst support, the heated plate and the cover plate were stacked to compound the reactor. Graphite was used as the sealing material to seal the MPFAR attributed to its better heat resistant and ductility than the metal gaskets. The micro-reactor is heated by cartridge heaters inserted in the heated plate and the chamber. The reaction gas mixture goes into the MPFAR from the inlet and goes out from the outlet."
3,Fabrication of the catalyst support,"2.2 Fabrication of the catalyst support Conventional machining was adopted to fabricate the reaction chamber. The manufacture of the catalyst support, which is the key portion of the micro-reactor, is difficult because of its size and complex topology structure. The conventional methods to fabricate the catalyst support are silicon bulk fabrication [24], ultra-precision machining [25], and LIGA process. However, the low productivity, high-cost and high energy consumption have hindered their wide application in micro-reactor fabrication. To overcome these obstacles, the semi-solid micro thixo-forming processing, which was proposed by Steinhoff et al. [26] and developed by Kim et al. [27,28], provided a low-cost and high-efficiency approach for the micro-reaction support with micro-pin-fin arrays. In this study, the semi-solid micro thixo-forming processing was adopted to fabricate the catalyst support with micro-pin-fin arrays, and its specific manufacture procedures were as follows. Aluminum alloy A356 is used to fabricate the catalyst support attributed to its low density and good performance in semisolid forming. The fabrication apparatus and procedure of the MPFAR are shown in Fig. 2 . Firstly, based on the material characteristic and the feature of the micro thixo-forming technology, the cylindrical workpiece was heated by the induction heating instrument. In order to obtain uniform temperature distribution in the workpiece in this study, by controlling the induction heating instrument, the workpiece was heated quickly at the beginning of the heating process, then heated slowly when the temperature of the workpiece approached to 853K approximately, which is at the semi-solid range of A356 alloy as shown in Fig. 2(a). The detail introduction about the optimization of the heating process is addressed in the previous publication [29]. Then, the heated workpiece was moved quickly into the dies mounted on 100kN mechanical press as shown in Fig. 2(b). The punch with micro-hole arrays machined by micro-milling was used to fabricate the micro-pin-fin arrays. The lower mould of the die has a chamber to place the heated workpiece. The dies were preheated to Ca. 500K to improve the process characteristic of the workpiece. Finally, the mechanical press moved down quickly to press the heated workpiece, and the catalyst support with micro-pin-fin arrays used in the micro-reactor for hydrogen production was well fabricated based on the micro thixo-forming technology as shown in Fig. 2(c)."
4,Model development,"In order to analyze the mass and heat transfer and the reaction performance in the MPFAR developed in this study, a three-dimensional simulation model was established. By adopting this three-dimensional simulation model, the performance of the MPFAR was analyzed in comparison with a micro-channel reactor. The results demonstrate that the MPFAR has better performance in producing hydrogen via SMR for fuel cell."
5,Model description,"3.1 Model description The structure diagram and the calculation domain of the MPFAR are shown in Figs. 1 and 3 . The model consists of two sections: catalyst layer and flow channel. The catalyst layer is coated on catalyst support, and the flow channel is the rest except the catalyst layer. The detail structure parameters of the MPFAR are listed in Table 1 . For comparison, a micro-channel reactor of 12 micro-channels was also analyzed as shown in Fig. 4(a). The geometrical structures of the inlet and outlet tubes and the flow manifolds are the same as those of the MPFAR. Only the structure of the micro-channels with catalyst coated on is different with the MPFAR. To reduce the computing time, one micro-channel of the micro-channel reactor is selected as the simulation domain in this study. The schematic diagram of the micro-channel is shown in Fig. 4(b). The channel width, length, fin thickness and height are 800μm, 18mm, 1mm, and 1.2mm, respectively, which are similar with those of the MPFAR, and the micro-channel also includes the catalyst layer and flow channel for comparisons."
6,Scale analysis,"3.2 Scale analysis Considering the heat and mass transfer of gaseous reactants in the micro-reactor, the micro flow modeling should be checked whether the continuum model or the rarefied model is to be used. This depends on the value of Knudsen number K n = λ/D c [30], where λ and D c are the mean free path for a gas molecule and the characteristic length, respectively. If K n <10−3, the continuum model is suitable. K n can be calculated as follows: Assuming all the fluid is steam in the micro-reactor, and the minimum values of D c in this study is 0.855mm, then the maximum mean free path is λ = f 2 π ρ g d g 2 = 1.58 × 10 − 7 ( m ) The maximum value of K n is K n = λ D c = 1.85 × 10 − 4 < 10 − 3 On the other hand, assuming all the fluid is methanol gas in the micro-reactor, thus, the maximum mean free path is λ = f 2 π ρ g d g 2 = 1.39 × 10 − 7 ( m ) The maximum value of K n is K n = λ D c = 1.62 × 10 − 4 < 10 − 3 Because all the values of K n are less than 10−3, indicating that the N–S equations is suitable to analyze the heat and mass transfer in the MPFAR and the micro-channel reactor."
7,Modeling description,"3.3 Modeling description The reaction schemes for methanol steam reforming with the catalyst of Cu/Zn2O3/AL2O3 used in this study are as follows [31]: (1) CH3OH+H2O=3H2 +CO2 (2) H2 +CO2 =CO+H2O Its species equation can be expressed as: (3) ρ u ∂ Y s ∂ x + v ∂ Y s ∂ y + w ∂ Y s ∂ z = D e f f ρ ∂ 2 Y s ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 Y s ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 Y s ∂ z 2 + R s where ρ is the density of fluid; u, v, w are velocity components in the x, y and z direction, respectively; x, y, z are Cartesian coordinates; Y s is the mass fraction of the sth species, including CH3OH, H2O, H2, CO and CO2; D eff is the mass diffusion coefficient, which can be expressed as D eff = ɛ γ D [20], where ɛ is the porosity. The values of D eff are 0.38 and 1 in the flow channel and the catalyst layer, respectively; γ is set as 1 in this study; R s is the species source term for the reforming reaction. For the flow channel, R s is zero as no reaction occurs, while for the catalyst layer, R s can be expressed as (4) R s = M w s ( R SR + R r WGS ) ( λ ″ − λ ′ ) where M ws is the molecular weight of the species s, R SR is the reaction rate of the steam reforming reaction, R rWGS is the reaction rate of the reverse water-gas shift reaction (rWGS). Based on reaction schemes mentioned above, the reaction rate equations are [32] (5) R SR = k 1 P CH 3 OH m P H 2 O n , m = 0.6 , n = 0.4 (6) R r WGS = k 2 P CO 2 P H 2 − k − 2 P CO P H 2 O where P s is the partial pressure of species s; k 1 is the rate constant of the steam reforming reaction, k 2 and k −2 is the forward and backward rate of the reversal water-gas shift reaction. The cross-section area of the reactor and the gas velocity analyzed in this study is small, so the value of the Reynolds number is small and the Mach number is less than 0.4. Consequently, the flow can be supposed as laminar and incompressible. Considering the steady state, the three-dimensional continuity equation is [23] (7) ρ ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ y + ∂ w ∂ z = 0 The momentum equations of the fluid in the micro-reactor are as follows [23]: X-momentum equation, (8) ρ u ∂ u ∂ x + v ∂ u ∂ y + w ∂ u ∂ z = − ∂ p ∂ x + μ ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ z 2 + S u Y-momentum equation, (9) ρ u ∂ v ∂ x + v ∂ v ∂ y + w ∂ v ∂ z = − ∂ p ∂ x + μ ∂ 2 v ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ z 2 + S v Z-momentum equation, (10) ρ u ∂ w ∂ x + v ∂ w ∂ y + w ∂ w ∂ z = − ∂ p ∂ x + μ ∂ 2 w ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ z 2 + S w where p is the pressure of fluid; μ is the dynamical viscosity of fluid; S u , S v , S w are the sources terms produced by the porous structure of catalyst, therefore, in flow channel S u , S v , S w are all zero, while in the catalyst layer, their representations are depicted in Ref. [33]. Because the reaction temperature of SMR is relatively low (less than 553K), the thermal radiation and conduction in the gas phase can be negligible in the calculation, so the energy equation is (11) ρ u ∂ T ∂ x + v ∂ T ∂ y + w ∂ T ∂ z = κ C p ∂ 2 T ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 T ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 T ∂ z 2 + R r + φ where C p is the specific heat in a constant pressure; T is the fluid temperature; κ is the fluid heat conductivity; R r is the energy source term for reforming reaction; φ is the fluid viscous dissipation term and it can be expressed as (12) φ = μ 2 ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ y + ∂ w ∂ z 2 + ∂ u ∂ y + ∂ v ∂ z + ∂ w ∂ x 2 The boundary conditions of the micro-reactor and the micro-channel need to be specified. For comparison, the boundary conditions of the two reactors keep consistent. The boundary conditions used in this study are similar to Ref. [22], including those at the inlet, outlet, wall and the interfaces between the flow channel and the catalyst layer. The detailed boundary conditions are as follows: (1) The boundary conditions for the inlets at the flow channel and the catalyst layer: The inlet flow velocity, the inlet gas composition and the inlet temperature are constant. (2) The boundary conditions for outlets at the flow channel and the catalyst layer: There is fully developed flow; the gauge pressure at outlet is zero. (3) The boundary conditions for the interface between the heated wall and the catalyst layers: The velocities and the concentration gradient are assumed to be zero, and the temperature is assumed to be equal to the constant wall temperature. (4) The boundary conditions for the interface between the flow channel and the catalyst layer: The temperature, velocities, species concentration and species flux are continuous. (5) The boundary conditions for the walls except heated wall: The walls are assumed to be adiabatic."
8,Numerical studies and discussion,"The equations mentioned above in the study were solved by employing a finite volume scheme with the simulation domain divided into a lot of cells, which were used as control volumes. The equations are numerically integrated over each control volumes. All equations were numerically solved by using the commercial fluid dynamics program, ANSYS FLUENT 12.1.2 (2009, ANSYS, Inc.). The SIMPLE algorithm was used to solve the conversion-diffusion equations. The five species including CO2, CO, H2, H2O and CH3OH are considered as ideal gas. Their thermo-physical parameters are shown in Table 2 . The density of gas mixture is assumed as non-compressive ideal gas. The corresponding thermo-physical parameters obey the mass-weight mixing law. To analyze the performance of the micro-reactor, the temperature and velocity distribution in the micro-reactor are investigated firstly in this study. For calculation, the inlet temperature of reagents keeps constant to 473K. Due to the continuum model used in the simulation, the distance between the two adjacent micro-pin-fins cannot be smaller than several tens of micrometers. Also for the laminar assumption, the occurrence of the turbulence should be avoided in the flow when the parameter Re is several hundred, so the maximum inlet velocity calculated by the parameter Re in this calculation should be lower than 3.367ms−1 for the accuracy of the simulation. Therefore, the effect of the SC−1 molar ratios (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6), reaction temperatures (493.15K, 523.15K, 553.15K, 593.15K) and contact times (0.031s, 0.0413s, 0.062s, 0.0815s, 0.12s, 0.16s, 0.2s, 0.24s) on the methanol conversion and the species molar fraction are also investigated. The contact time can be defined as τ = V cat/V r , where V cat, V r are the volume of the catalyst layer and the volumetric flow rate of gaseous methanol and water, respectively. The methanol conversion can be calculated as η M(%)=(C i − C out)/C i ×100, where C i and C out are the inlet and outlet CH3OH molar concentration, respectively. In addition, the methanol conversion in the MPFAR is compared with a micro-channel reactor under the same operation condition. To investigate the effect of the grids density on the simulated results, the grids independence was examined at the beginning of the simulation. Three grid configurations were evaluated for the micro-reactor and the micro-channel. The numbers of the grids are 149,270, 592,706, and 1,178,480, and the numbers of the grids of the micro-channel are 8,640, 38,880, and 69,120. The influence of the grids on the methanol conversion is shown in Table 3 . From Table 3, it can be found that the both three values of methanol conversion for the two reactors are almost consistent, so the grid number of 149,270 and 8,640 are chosen for the MPFAR and the micro-channel in this study to reduce the computation time, respectively. The normalized residuals of the variable were calculated and the convergence criterions for the normalized residuals for each variable were restricted to less than 5×10−6. From calculation results, the minimum value among the calculated methanol and CO molar fraction is larger than 10−3, therefore, the error ranges of each variable is within ±1%, whose influence on the results is very small and can be neglected."
9,"Distribution of the temperature, velocity and M i in the MPFAR","4.1 Distribution of the temperature, velocity and M i in the MPFAR Fig. 5 shows the temperature distribution in the micro-reactor at the plane of z =0.5mm when the reaction temperature is 553.15K. From the reactor inlet to outlet, the temperature increases from 552K to 553.15K. The temperature keeps constant in the inlet flow manifold since there is no catalyst in that region. Because of the endothermic characteristic of the steam reforming reaction, the temperature in the inlet portion of micro-pin-fin arrays is lower than the wall temperature. But from Fig. 5, it can be found that the temperature gradient is only about 1K in the reaction region. The lower temperature gradient can avoid the appearance of “cool point” [35] and will provide a great reaction environment for catalyst. Fig. 6 shows the velocity distribution under the same condition as Fig. 5. From Fig. 6, it can be found that the velocity distribution is uniform along the flow direction of reagents in micro-pin-fin arrays, which can enhance the reaction performance of SMR effectively. The velocity around the micro-pin-fins is small, meaning that the mass diffusion is the key factor in transporting reagents to catalyst. The fluid velocity at the outlet of the MPFAR is about two times than that at the inlet which agrees well with the reaction scheme of SMR. The velocity distribution in other planes of direction z is also uniform as shown in Fig. 6, though the velocity is different. Fig. 7 depicts the molar fraction distribution of the different species in the MPFAR. Along the x direction (flow direction) of the reagents, the CH3OH and H2O molar fractions decrease, while the H2, CO2, and CO molar fractions increase. As it is known that the ratio of the molar fraction between H2 and CO2 is equal to 3 if the steam reforming reaction occurs only, but the ratio is not exactly equal to 3 due to the rWGS in SMR. From Fig. 7, the ratio of the molar fraction between H2 and CO2 is approximately equal to 3, which means that the steam reforming reaction is dominating in the MPFAR. In addition, it is also found that the CH3OH molar fraction decreases more steeply at the inlet, owing to a bigger reaction rate in the inlet region. The thermodynamic equilibrium compositions of H2 and CO2 are also depicted in Fig. 7. It can be found that H2 molar fraction under equilibrium condition is 68.72, which is higher than the H2 molar fraction at outlet. This result indicates that the methanol steam reforming is not under thermodynamic equilibrium condition."
10,"The effect of Tr, τ, SC−1 molar ratio on η M and M CO","4.2 The effect of Tr, τ, SC−1 molar ratio on η M and M CO Fig. 8(a) shows the methanol conversion at different reaction temperatures and contact times when the SC−1 molar ratio is 1.2. From Fig. 8(a), it can be found that the methanol conversion increases with the increase of the reaction temperature and the contact time. However, a careful analysis of Fig. 8 reveals that the reaction temperature plays a key role on SMR reaction. When the temperature is 493.15K, the methanol conversion is still less than 60% even the contact time is as long as 0.24s, while when the temperature is 593.15K, the methanol conversion in the MPFAR is more than 80% at any contact time. Furthermore, the methanol conversion under thermodynamic equilibrium condition when the reaction temperature is 593.15K is also depicted in Fig. 8. It can be found that the methanol steam reforming reaction approaches to thermodynamic equilibrium when the methanol conversion approaches to 100%. The CO molar fraction in the reformate gas at the outlet of the micro-reactor under different reaction temperatures and contact times is shown in Fig. 8(b). The CO molar fraction increases more quickly at a higher reaction temperature with the increase of the contact time. This means that the effect of the contact time on the CO molar fraction is large at a higher reaction temperature. Fig. 9 depicts the effect of the SC−1 molar ratio on the methanol conversion and the CO molar fraction at different reaction temperatures when the contact time is 0.041s. From Fig. 9(a), it can be found that though the temperature plays a key role on the methanol conversion, the influence of the SC−1 molar ratio on the methanol conversion is similar at various reaction temperatures. This means that the SC−1 molar ratio and the reaction temperature independently influence the methanol conversion. However, the change rates of the CO molar fraction at low and high temperature are small and large, respectively. Also, with the increase of the SC−1 molar ratio, the methanol conversion increases, while the CO molar fraction decreases. This can be easily explained by Le Chatelier's principle. Excess steam in the reagents enhances the SMR and inhibits the rWGS. However, the increase of the SC−1 molar ratio needs the SMR system to supply more energy for gasifying the reagents, making the system less efficient."
11,Comparison with a micro-channel reactor,"4.3 Comparison with a micro-channel reactor Based on the model presented in Section 3.3, the performance comparison with a micro-channel reactor is conducted. For comparison, the flow rates at the inlet tubes of the two reactors are consistent, so the inlet velocities of the two simulation domains are different due to their different inlet dimensions. Fig. 10 shows the methanol conversion at different inlet flow rates and reaction temperatures when the SC−1 molar ratio is 1.2. Fig. 10 reveals that with the increase of the inlet flow rate and the reaction temperature, the methanol conversion in the micro-channel reactor increases. The comparisons between the MPFAR and the micro-channel reactor at the same catalyst thickness (100μm) are made in Fig. 10. It is found that under the same reactor temperature and the inlet flow rate, the methanol conversion in the MPFAR is much higher than that in the micro-channel reactor. This is because the specific surface area of the MPFAR (Ca. 2634.9m2 m−3) is larger than the micro-channel reactor (Ca. 1320.6m2 m−3), which makes more catalyst mounted on the catalyst support. When the catalyst thickness is 418.7μm in the micro-channel reactor and 100μm in the MPFAR, the catalyst weight in the two micro-reactors is equal. In this case, it is found from Fig. 10 that the methanol conversion in the former is higher than that in the latter. This result demonstrates that micro-pin-fin arrays can enhance the heat and mass transfer. The higher contact area of the MPFAR reduces the thickness of catalyst layer, making the preparation easy."
12,Experimental validation,"For evaluating the performance of the MPFAR, optimizing operation conditions and verifying the reliability of the numerical simulation, a series of experiments were conducted. The contact time, the reaction temperature and the SC−1 molar ratio were varying in the range of 0.031-0.12s (in the room temperature), 493-553K, and 1.0-1.5, respectively. The experimental results were compared with the simulated ones obtained in Section 4, and the detail processes are as follows."
13,The reaction system and experimental setup,"5.1 The reaction system and experimental setup Fig. 11 denotes the schematic diagram of the reaction system for hydrogen production via SMR. The reaction system consisted of three subsystems including a reagent feeding unit, a MPFAR, a reformate gas treatment and analysis unit. In the reagent feeding unit, a flask was used to store the mixture of methanol and water, a steel cylinder was employed to contain the gas mixture of H2 and N2 with 5vol.% H2, and an evaporator was used to generate gaseous reactant for the MPFAR. As for the MPFAR, it is composed of four cartridge heaters with small diameter, two J-type thermocouples for the temperature control. In the reformate gas treatment and analysis unit, a condenser, a gas–water separator and a dryer were used to treat the reformate gas. The gas chromatographer (Agilent 7890A) with a TCD detector and a flow meter were used to analyze the product gases."
14,Experimental procedures,"5.2 Experimental procedures The experimental procedures for the performance testing of the fabricated MPFAR for hydrogen production are sketched in Fig. 11. In this study, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was used for hydrogen production. The catalyst was reduced in the N2/H2 gas mixture with 5vol.% H2 under the flow rate of 100sccm at 523K for 6h. The flow rate was controlled by a mass flow meter in conjunction with LABVIEW software. After reduction, N2 was fed into the reactor for about 10min at a flow rate of 50sccm to remove the residual gases. Then, the reagents were fed into the evaporator and the micro-reactor with a specified flow rate controlled by a spring pump. A thermocouple was mounted at the outlet of the evaporator, controlling the inlet temperature of the micro-reactor. For consequent analysis of the reformate gas, the residual methanol and water were removed by a condenser, a gas-liquid separator and a dryer. Following the treatment of the reformate gas, the volumetric flow rate of the outlet gases was detected by a flow meter with the unit of sccm. The volumetric fraction of the different gas species was detected by a gas chromatographer with a TCD detector. According to the research work of Choi et al. [36], when the feed contains 43mol. % water or greater, no by-products such as methane and methyl are detected in the temperature range of 473–573K. Therefore, the by-products were neglected in this study due to the similar reaction conditions. In order to ensure the experimental quality, the gas chromatographer was calibrated by the standard gas. The thermocouples and the flow meter were also calibrated accurately before experiments. In addition, the reaction system was leak tested by sending N2 with a fixed volumetric flow rate into the reaction system for the SMR reaction followed by measuring the flow rate at the outlet of the dryer."
15,Experimental results and discussion,"5.3 Experimental results and discussion In this study, different contact times are selected for comparing the experimental results with the simulated ones. Fig. 12 shows the methanol conversion, the CO molar fraction at the outlet under various contact times and reaction temperatures when the SC−1 molar ratio is 1.2. It can be found that with the increase of the contact time, the methanol conversion increases, but the inlet flow decreases because of the fixed volume of the micro-reactor. Therefore, the hydrogen yields of the MPFAR decreases from 0.00498mols−1 to 0.00180mols−1 with the reaction temperature of 553.15K when the contact time increases from 0.031s to 0.12s. As the contact time is 0.12s, the methanol conversion reaches to 87.5%. Fig. 12 also depicts the CO molar fraction under various contact times when the reaction temperature is 523K. The contact time changes from 0.031s to 0.12s, the CO molar fraction in the reformate gas increases from 0.13 to 0.26. This result shows that CO is the consecutive product in the SMR process and this also agrees well with the research work performed by Men et al. [8]. Fig. 13 depicts the methanol conversion and the species fraction at different temperatures when the contact time and the SC−1 molar ratio are 0.031s and 1.2, respectively. With the increase of the reaction temperature, the methanol conversion and the CO molar fraction in the reformate gas increase. The CO molar fraction demonstrated from Fig. 13 is less than 1% in the reformate gas. Simulated results of the methanol conversion are also indicated in Fig. 13, and the reasonable agreement with each other can be found. Fig. 14 depicts the methanol conversion and the species molar fraction in the reformate gas at various SC−1 molar ratios when the reaction temperature and the contact time are 523K and 0.031s, respectively. From Fig. 14(a), it can be found that with the increase of the SC−1 molar ratio, the methanol conversion increases, but the increase of the H2 yields is not consistent with the methanol conversion. This is because the increase of the SC−1 molar ratio results in the decrease of the methanol molar flow rate with the same volumetric flow rate. The simulated results about the methanol conversion and the species fraction are also depicted in Fig. 14. It can be found that the maximum error of the methanol conversion between the experimental results and the simulated ones is less than 6%, and the small discrepancy shows that the simulated results about the methanol conversion are reasonably consistent with the experimental ones. It is also found that for H2 and CO2, the calculated results agree well with the experimental measurements."
16,Conclusions,"A novel MPFAR is developed and fabricated using micro thixo-forming technology in this study to enhance the performance of the micro-reactor for hydrogen production and reduce the fabrication cost of the catalyst support. A three-dimensional model in the numerical analysis is adopted to investigate the heat and mass transfer in the MPFAR. Results demonstrate that the temperature and velocity distribution in the MPFAR developed in this study are uniform, which is beneficial for the SMR process. The methanol conversion as well as the CO molar fraction in the reformate gas at the outlet increases with the increase of the reaction temperature and the contact time. With the increase of the SC−1 molar ratio, the methanol conversion increases, while the CO molar fraction decreases. The comparisons between the MPFAR and the micro-channel reactor demonstrate that the former has better performance for hydrogen production. Series of experiments are also conducted to test the fabricated micro-reactor and it is found that the simulated results agree well with the experimental ones. Based on the experimental results, the methanol conversion in the MPFAR can reach to 87.5% with the H2 molar fraction of about 75% which could provide enough hydrogen for fuel cell when the reaction temperature, the SC−1 molar ratio and the contact time are 553K, 1.2 and 0.12s, respectively. The research works in this study would provide the theoretical basis for the continuum design, manufacture and optimization of the laminar MPFAR for hydrogen production by steam reforming of alcohol."
