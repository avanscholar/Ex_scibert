0,Introduction,"Palm oil is a major commodity for developing countries in Southeast Asia, specially Indonesia and Malaysia, which are responsible for 86% of the global production [1]. While global demand increases, Thailand, Colombia and, more recently, Brazil are also beginning to emerge as key players of that market [2,3]. The main reasons why palm oil consumption has been on the rise in the last years are their multiple uses (e.g., food industry, biofuels, cosmetics) and lower cost when compared to other oils [4]. The global palm oil market was valued at USD 62 million in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 88 million by 2022, with a production of 128.20 million tons of oil/year, of which approximately 11.5% will be palm kernel oil [5]. In order to supply world demand for palm oil, its producers are augmenting the total production, also elevating the amount of residues generated in the process. The oil extraction generates a highly polluting residue, Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), which cannot be spilled directly into water bodies [6]. POME is a complex effluent, which is not toxic, but due to its elevated organic content, is considered extremely polluting [7]. Its characterization might vary according to the production process and raw material utilized [8–10]. While technologically advanced mills could process up to 150 MT of fresh fruit branches (FFB) per hour and generate POME with Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as low as 16 g O2/mL, more primitive ones are able to process up to 2.5 MT of FFB and can originate POME with a COD as high as 100 O2/mL [8,11]. There are several steps in the Palm oil production process, but POME is produced mainly during three of them: the sterilization of bunches, after kernel separation from the shells (in a hydrocyclone) and after oil clarification [12]. As observed, it is a complex material, containing high concentrations of organic material, oil and greases and suspended solids. Therefore, adequate treatment or usage is necessary before discharging it into rivers or seas [13–15]. Usually, treatment stations are considered non-profitable investments, leading to insufficient treatment of the effluent and, therefore, contamination of the surrounding area and water bodies. POME is usually treated by non-biological treatments as coagulation–flocculation, adsorption or membrane filtration [16–19]. Neither of those methods were able to treat POME adequately, while generating income to the industry [13]. A more economically, viable and environment friendly alternative is to use POME as raw material to biological processes [20], such as polymers production, methane and biohydrogen production and also for biodiesel synthesis [21–23]. As for hydrogen, this gas is very interesting since it could be used as feedstock in various processes, such as petrochemical, food, microelectronics, ferrous and non-ferrous metal processing, chemical and polymer synthesis, and metallurgical process industries [24] or as combustible in fuel cells [25]. Several researches have focused on the fuel application of hydrogen due to its clean combustion, high specific energy and non-toxicity; associated with the current scenario of depreciation of petroleum price and increment on sustainable development [23,25,26]. Although most hydrogen is produced by chemical routes from fossil sources [27], development of a biotechnological process to produce hydrogen is very attractive from a sustainable development perspective, since it applies renewable resources and requires low energy inputs as compared to chemical processes. As for methane, it is a gas, whose world reserves have been dwindling quickly, as it is widely used. In addition to its elevated calorific power, the main reason for its fast depletion is its simple extraction process, as it is generally found in abundance in petrol wells [28]. It is widely used in industries or domestic houses to generate power [29]but more noble uses are being applied to it, such as methanol synthesis [30,31] or converting CH4 and CO2, two greenhouse gases, into synthesis gas [32]. Literature is extensive in what regards CH4 production from biomass via chemical or biochemical processes. Amongst the biochemical processes, which can be carried under atmospheric pressures and room temperatures, anaerobic digestion is a traditional and well known technology, allowing high yields of CH4. [33,34]. Furthermore, anaerobic digestion is an alternative solution for providing energy for remote areas, which is still an issue for the major producers of POME, such as Indonesia and Malaysia [35]. In addition to the fact that this energy can be used locally, it is also possible to supply the country’s electrical system with the exceeding power generated by H2 and CH4 combustion. This review approaches the employment of POME as raw material for hydrogen and methane production via a dark fermentation process, as well as a sequential production of hydrogen and methane, providing an interesting alternative that meets environmental conservation and energy production in a sustainable model, which could benefit local communities in remote areas."
1,The dark fermentation process,
2,General aspects of dark fermentation,"2.1 General aspects of dark fermentation A Dark fermentation process consists in the application of strict or facultative anaerobic organisms for converting substrates, such as simple sugars, glycerol, fatty acids and carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids, alcohols, solvents, CO2, H2 and CH4 [36,37]. The main advantages of dark fermentation as compared to other biological processes for hydrogen production lie in its light-independence and consequently low energy input requirement, the possibility of employing renewable biomasses as feedstock and faster H2 production rates [37–39]. On the other hand, the bottlenecks of this process are low yields of H2 and large quantities of by-products in the final medium [40]. However, most of these by-products are value-added, like organic acids, 1,3-propanediol and ethanol [34], which might be recovered from the medium. Moreover, hydrogen production liquid waste (HPLW) might be applied as raw material for production of methane, lipid, bioplastic and electricity [34]. Also, HPLW could be utilized in a photofermentation system in order to provide electron donors, generating more H2 in a hybrid process [41]. Dark fermentation of agro industrial wastes associated with the utilization of HPLW either for bioproducts recovery or as raw material in other processes represents a promising alternative to hydrogen production from a biorefinery perspective."
3,POME to H2 via dark fermentation,"2.2 POME to H2 via dark fermentation As discussed in Section 1, POME is a complex material and its composition varies depending on palm oil processing. Generally, POME contains high concentrations of organic molecules such as fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates, nitrogenous compounds, lipids (including triacylglycerol); and minerals [42]. This organic matter could be metabolized during dark fermentation processes either by pure culture or bacterial consortia. Bacterial consortia, such as anaerobic sludge, are mainly used when complex materials are applied as feedstock, due to the presence of assorted organisms that could act synergistically, enhancing the degradation and consumption of these materials [43–45]. When a consortium of bacteria is used as inoculum, degradation of complex material occurs in four phases: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis [43,46,47], in which different organisms act concurrently, as represented in Fig. 1. Firstly, complex substrates, such as long chain fatty acids and triacylglycerols are hydrolyzed into simpler molecules, such as oleic acid, palmitic acid and glycerol by hydrolytic bacteria. In the second phase, acidogenic bacteria promote the conversion of those molecules into volatile fatty acids, typically acetic and butyric acids; and eventually alcohols, like 1,3-propanediol (formed by glycerol metabolism) and ethanol. In the sequence, the metabolism of organic acids generates acetate and butyrate and also cogenerates H2 during acetogenesis. Finally, generated H2 might be reduced to methane by methanogenic microflora [48]. However, since POME is a complex material, the substrates could not be easily available for bacterial cells, resulting in long adaptive phases and/or low conversion rates [49].( Fig. 2) In order to produce hydrogen, it is mandatory to eliminate H2-consuming bacteria from the medium, avoiding methanogenesis [38]. Since most of H2-producing organisms are able to sporulate, it is relatively simple to eliminate H2-consuming microorganisms when using mixed cultures [50]. The basis of pretreatment is to stimulate the sporulation of H2-producing bacteria and to eliminate non-spore forming bacteria, typically H2-consumers, by establishing a hostile environment. There are several types of pretreatment that can be chosen considering the microflora in the seed sludge [43,51]. An alternative source of hydrogen consumption is the sulfate reducing bacteria metabolism. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are able to capture hydrogen produced in dark fermentation in concentrations as low as 0.02 ppm and convert it into sulfidric acid (H2S) when sulfate is present in the medium [52]. Previous studies determine that SRB have a thermodynamic advantage over homoacetogenic and methanogenic bacteria, as its reaction releases 165 kJ per mol of hydrogen [53]. In order to minimize the effect of SRB in sulfate rich mediums, enhancing the hydrogen content, pH values around 5.5 are reported to present the highest yield of hydrogen [52]. Another approach towards bacterial culture for hydrogen production is the isolation of some species from anaerobic sludge and their application as pure or co-culture [54–57], suspended or immobilized [58,59]. There are miscellaneous bacteria in the anaerobic sludge, as presented in Table 1 that might be isolated and applied as pure inocula. In this universe, Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp. are mainly studied, due to their endogenous capability of generating higher H2 yields [38,45,60]. Hiligsmann et al. [55] compare H2 production by several species of Clostridium sp. isolated from anaerobic sludge. No significant improvement was observed, which indicates that anaerobic sludges are more profitable for H2 production than pure cultures, especially when a complex material is used as substrate due to the mechanism of action on synergism of seed sludge microflora. Additionally, Mishra et al. [57] tested a pure culture of Klebsiella pneumonia, a co-culture of K. pneumonia and Clostridium freundii, and an acidogenic mixed consortium in order to produce hydrogen from distillery effluent. Once more, mixed consortium showed the best result. They also pointed Clostridium sp. as the major contributing species in the mixed culture applied in that study. According to Hung et al. [45], other organisms rather than Clostridium sp. present in anaerobic sludge have significant roles in H2 production. For instance, Enterobacter aerogenes and Bacillus sp. could contribute to the dark fermentation process by supporting the anaerobic environment maintenance; Streptococcus sp. could interact with Clostridium sp. forming a granular structure that increases hydrogen production; and Bifidobacterium sp., Bacillus sp. and Megasphaera sp. might assist hydrogen production by breaking down complex materials. In the literature, a wide variety of mesophilic hydrogen producing bacteria has been reported, such as Clostridia (C. butyricum, C. pasteurianum, C. saccharobutylicum) and Enterobacter (E. aerogenes). Termophilic hydrogen producing bacteria as T. thermosaccharolyticum, C. thermocellum and B. thermozeamaize have also been reported. However, its optimum hydrogen production, even though higher than mesophilic bacteria, requires considerable energy input [61–63] Table 2 shows results reported in the literature involving the application of POME as a substrate source for hydrogen production through the use of a mixed culture. Both thermophile and mesophile sludges were successfully employed in different researches. Some authors submit POME to pretreatment in order to enhance substrate bioavailability. Leaño et al. [65] employed ultrasonication of POME aiming to improve substrate surface area; as a result, productivity increased by 38%. A 49% increment was achieved by Pisutpaisal et al. [15] when an ozonated POME was used for hydrogen production. According to the authors, ozonation pretreatment could break down complex molecule into simpler molecules that might be easily converted into hydrogen. Nevertheless, the pretreatment of POME in order to raise the bioavailability of its substrates is still an incipient approach towards biohydrogen production enhancement. Research should be developed as an effort to evaluate different types of pretreatment and to elucidate its mechanisms to turn substrates more accessible for bacterial cells. Valladão et al. [70] used an enzyme pool to hydrolyze poultry slaughterhouse effluent, rich in fats and proteins, into free acids that could be metabolized by microorganisms. Additionally, Serri et al. [71] demonstrated a satisfactory enzymatic hydrolysis of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, feasible molecules for dark fermentation. It is known that POME holds palm oil traces, triglycerides, carbohydrates and proteins; hence, enzymatic hydrolysis could be an interesting alternative in that it applies hydrolases for enhancing bioavailability of POME. In this sense, Garritano et al, [49] showed that previous POME hydrolysis by plant enzyme preparation improved H2 productivity by 102%. The hydrogen produced by dark fermentation of POME might be used in fuel cells for electricity generation. Lin et al. [72] used the hydrogen purified from H2-rich gas produced by dark fermentation into a proton-exchange-membrane fuel-cell (PEMFC) system to generate electricity. An analogous system was used by Campo et al. [73] without any hydrogen purification step. An Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell was chosen by Martínez et al. [74] to convert fermentative hydrogen without further purification into electricity. This electricity could feed the palm oil production plant or even supply the local energy demand [75]. The aforementioned studies confirm the high potential for using biohydrogen in fuel cells. However, there are some challenges related to such use. The possible presence of H2S in the biogas could be a barrier to this application, since this compound severely poisons the fuel cell catalyst [76]; hence, in that case a separation system is needed. In addition, the H2 volume and yield determine the feasibility regarding commercial implementation [77]. According to Rahman et al. [77], the integration between biological hydrogen production and fuel cell electricity generation would be possible in the future, as long as high yield and production rates are achieved, as well as efficient separation systems."
4,General aspects of methane production and usage,"Worldwide consumption of methane is projected to increase from 120 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in 2012–203 tcf by 2040 (International Energy Outlook report, 2016). Regarding all the energies sources being used nowadays, natural gas has seen the largest increase amongst them all. This is not only due to its calorific power of approximately 55 MJ/kg, which turns the gas into an interesting combustible to generate power, but also the fact that it is often found in the same drill well as petrol places methane in a competitive position amongst other possible combustible resources. The relatively easy extraction process of CH4 has contributed to popularize the use of this gas in several sectors of industry. In order to accompany the rise of natural gas demand projected in the International Energy Outlook (IEO, 2016) the biggest producers of methane will need to increase their supplies by almost 69% until 2040, which would represent a big impact in natural CH4 reserves. Furthermore, in a six-year window, 12 countries became natural gas importers, among which three of the biggest palm oil producers – Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. In this sense, as methane obtained from drill wells is not a renewable resource, researches are being developed in order to verify the feasibility of producing it through different ways and one of the most interesting ones is via anaerobic digestion. It is known that POME is a suitable effluent not only for hydrogen, but also for CH4 production via anaerobic digestion. Due to the recently developed necessity for methane in major palm oil producer’s countries, publications in this area have become more abundant."
5,Pome to CH4 via anaerobic digestion,"3.1 Pome to CH4 via anaerobic digestion Methane production via anaerobic digestion occurs by two different metabolic pathways: acetic acid dismutation into CH4 and CO2; and H2 reduction performed by anaerobic methanogenic archaea [78]. If the reactor is operated under mesophilic conditions, most of CH4 production will occur via the first pathway, while under thermophilic conditions, the second pathway is favored [28]. The main difference between dark fermentation aiming H2 production and anaerobic digestion aiming CH4 production is the action of methanogenic archaea. Although the majority of CH4 production in a methanogenic system derives from CO2 reduction (CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O) process by methanogens, a small amount is derived from acetate fermentation [79]. In this metabolic pathway, acetic acid undergoes a dismutation reaction, catalyzed by an enzyme, to produce CH4 and CO2. In the reaction, an electron is transferred from the carbonyl function to the methyl group of acetic acid, producing CH4 and CO2 [80]. Table 3 shows results reported in the literature for methane production using POME as raw material and whether or not it was submitted to a pretreatment. Similarly, for hydrogen producing processes, some authors submit POME to different pretreatments aiming higher methane yields. The highest yields were obtained by using pretreated POME. Ozonation pretreatment performed by Chaiprapat and Laklam [81] was capable of augmenting CH4 yield by seven times when compared to control conditions. Similar yield results were obtained by Azhari and Abdurahmana [82] through the use of ultrasonicated POME. As discussed in Section 2.2, POME pretreatment aims to increase nutrients bioavailability to fermentative microorganisms. In this manner, not only H2 yields are increased, but POME pretreatments also play a major role regarding methane production improvement. Different strategies have been tested with a view to enhancing methane production. According to M. Y. Nurliyana et al. [86], the addition of Empty Fruit Branches (EFB) modifies the C/N ratio, increasing the availability of nitrogen in the medium. Nitrogen is an essential element for aminoacids and nucleic acids synthesis and its depletion may incur in slower growth. In this manner, the provision of adequate quantities of this element augments final methane yield by 11, 9 times as compared to the control experiment. In order to avoid hydrogen consumption, it is recommended to carry CH4 production as a sequential process to hydrogen production."
6,Sequential production of H2 and CH4,"3.2 Sequential production of H2 and CH4 While the vast majority of H2 and CH4 generation are being held separately, an integrated system is being successfully reported in the recent literature [88]. In this integrated approach, H2 and volatile fatty acids (VFA) are generated simultaneously in a first step and the residual fermentative media, after H2 recovery, is used for methane production [89,90]. In this context, Lin et al. [91] connected an UASB reactor in series with a CSTR and would submit POME to dark fermentation in the system. In UASB, H2 was generated alongside with dark fermentation byproducts, such as VFAs and small chain alcohols; then HPLW was conducted to the CSTR. Approximately 75% of the total CSTR volume was filled with HPLW, while 15% was made up of untreated sewage sludge (rich in methanogenic microflora). The study reported an energy yield of 15.43 MJgCOD -1, one of the highest energy yields in the literature obtained by using POME as raw material, due to the combination of hydrogen and methane generation system. It was shown in Section 2.1 that dark fermentation alters the fermentation media composition, as fermentative bacteria are able to metabolize complex molecules into simpler ones, while producing a mixture of biogas. As H2 production via dark fermentation advances, HPLW will require adequate treatment. Interrupting the fermentative process in acidogenesis (in which H2 is produced and recovered) will generate an effluent rich in organic matter [92]. An economically feasible way to solve this problem would be to carry out the dark fermentation process until its last step – methanogenesis [93]. Methanogenic metabolism is capable of catalyzing the generation of CH4 while consuming the acetic acid present in HPLW, drastically reducing COD contents, as under anaerobic conditions, the mineralization of organic matters is incomplete unless methane is produced [94]. In this sense, some articles [95-97] have demonstrated that a process in which a second reactor ( Fig. 3) would capture the HPLW generated in the first step of the process could be coupled in the system line by using the effluent of H2 producing process for generating CH4, augmenting overall gas production. As shown in Table 4, the sequential process has been more widely studied in the last few years and provides interesting results. A 94% COD removal was achieved by Krishnan et al. [96]. The same author also managed to obtain the highest hydrogen yield and productivity and the second highest methane yield by using POME as raw material and by making use of a continuous process. Nualsri et al. [88], obtained the highest methane yield and productivity. This is not only due to a continuous process, but also by the raw material used, which was sugarcane juice. Sugarcane juice is a simple raw material that is made up mainly of carbohydrates, molecules easily assimilated by bacteria during dark fermentation. Taking into account that palm oil industries are located in developing countries, the sequential production of H2 and CH4 is attractive since it is a simple process derived from a traditional technology, that could treat an effluent while generating energy and fuels. These products might be used in the industry itself, adding value to the global process and reducing costs with energy consumption and effluent treatment, or generating energy locally to the neighborhood, diminishing logistics issues related to gas transportation. In addition, the sequential process does not require complex reactors or light source. Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of energy generation in a palm oil plant integrated with hydrogen and methane production. A generation of 5 L of POME was considered for each 1 L of palm oil produced with a COD of 56,000 mgO2/L and a 30% loss in energy conversion. It would be possible to produce 3.3 MJ/LPalmOil and reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the effluent by 94%."
7,Other applications of POME,"POME is a versatile raw material, which can be used not only for producing biogas via dark fermentation but in a series of other processes [34,87]. It was successfully reported to be an adequate component of microalgae growth medium mainly because of its organic content, but also due to the presence of nitrate and orthophosphate in its composition [99,100]. Those organisms consume POME for biodiesel production [101] and consequently reduce the chemical oxigen demand from effluent. This represents both an increase in the economic potential of the industry and also an advance in the environmental question regarding final POME disposal. POME has also been added as an ingredient to growth media for a variety of bacteria. As it constitutes a rich medium, without inhibitors, a satisfactory microorganism growth is observed [102]. In the case of a submerged fermentation process, the microorganism inoculated will produce a secondary metabolite that has aggregated value. The organic material present in POME is consumed while the bacterial population grows, and, along with bacterial growth, the concentration of secondary metabolites also increases [103,104]. It can also be used for producing hydrogen in a photofermentative system, in which Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) acts to produce H2. During the growth phase, these bacteria use organic compounds, such as small organic acids, as electron donors to form ATP for their metabolic processes [105]. Electrons obtained in the oxidation of those acids travel through a variety of electron carrier proteins and are delivered to ferredoxin, which delivers them to nitrogenase. In the presence of molecular nitrogen, nitrogenase catalyzes the formation of ammonia, while under anaerobic conditions the enzyme acts as a hydrogenase dependent of ATP, using electrons generated during organic acids oxidation for reducing protons and forming molecular hydrogen [106,107]. Also, a sequential process combining both dark fermentation and photofermentation has been studied and promising results have been reported [79,89,108]. Photofermentative organisms use dark fermentation secondary metabolites as substrate to H2 production, increasing biogas yield. While some of the secondary metabolites produced do not impair cell growth, acetate concentration is critical in the fermentation media, and can reduce H2 production [96]. The increase in the acid concentration in the medium will lower its pH, altering the optimal condition for H2 production [109]. Photofermentative organisms are able to oxidize organic acids generated in dark fermentation and generate ATP in the process. The oxidation of those molecules generates hydrogen in the process and maintains an optimal environment for H2 production, while diminishing COD contents and making the residual fluid more environmentally friendly."
8,Final remarks,"Nowadays, sustainable development is a huge concern around the world. In this context, the palm oil industry is in keeping with this trend, since it encourages family farming, which fosters development of poor areas. For instance, in Malaysia, 30% of palm oil is produced by small farmers [100]. In the Brazilian county Moju, in Pará state, human development Index (HDI) increased 90% from 1991 until 2010 due to a policy that stimulated palm cultivation (Brazilian Senate, 2015). Furthermore, palm could be cultivated in degraded lands, making feasible industry expansion while avoiding greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. In ethanol producing countries, where the soil is progressively degraded by sugarcane monoculture, a viable option is to alternate between palm and sugarcane crops, combining soil recovery and ethanol and palm oil production [110]. As the palm oil industry will continue to grow in the near future so will the yearly production of its effluent. Therefore, it is mandatory to find an economically viable use for POME. A noble and interesting use for POME would be to convert it into a biogas, which could be used for generating power locally. Biological processes provide an interesting approach towards biogas generation through effluents. Of all biological processes, dark fermentation has the highest H2 yields and produces both CH4 and H2. The integration between palm oil industry and biogas (H2 + CH4) production represents an interesting approach in keeping with green chemistry principles, since almost all of them might be achieved in this global process, in particular the use of renewable feedstock, design for energy efficiency and design for degradation."
