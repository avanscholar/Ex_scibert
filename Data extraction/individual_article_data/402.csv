0,Introduction,"Presently, the global energy needs depend chiefly on fossil fuels, which are rapidly being exhausted in the near future [1]. With economic globalization and explosive growth of human population, the entire world will need more and more energy in the future. More importantly, it is well known that excessive consumption of fossil fuels will give rise to the release of harmful substances, which are detrimental to the environment and human beings [2,3]. To address the severe environmental issues and energy demands, it is of extraordinary importance to develop clean and renewable energy [4–6]. In 1972, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation by water splitting using TiO2 as the electrode was first reported by Fujishima and Honda [7]. From then on, photocatalytic water splitting, in which one of the most important energy, solar energy, can be converted into clean hydrogen energy. There are many merits about the hydrogen energy, such as low-cost, high efficient and eco-friendly. Therefore, hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting has gained more and more intensive attention from researchers all over the world in energy and environmental fields [8–10]. Over the past dozen years, remarkable achievements have been made in the fields of photocatalysts. Nevertheless, there are plenty of head-scratching problems including photocorrosion, high cost, and low photocatalytic activity in the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production [11–13]. Hence, to realize the practical application of photocatalytic hydrogen production, it is particularly necessary and urgent to develop excellent photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production photocatalysts with superior stability. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating conjugated polymer, has recently become a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis research [14–16]. On account of intrinsic property, such as abundant sources, proper band gap, excellent stability, g-C3N4 has a wide potential application prospect act as non-metallic and visible-light responsive photocatalyst in the field of water splitting [17–19]. The milestone of photocatalytic hydrogen production by water splitting using g-C3N4 as photocatalyst was ignited by Wang et al. in 2009 [20]. However, the production rate of hydrogen for pristine g-C3N4 is relatively low, which can be ascribed to small specific surface area, low electrical conductivity, and severe electron-hole recombination. So, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 for hydrogen production by water splitting, substantial efforts have been undertaken to improve its photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, in most of the cases, rare and costly Pt is often acted as the cocatalyst to boost the photocatalytic activity, which severely restricts the adhibition of g-C3N4 in the hydrogen production by water splitting. Hence, it is significantly meaningful to explore Pt-free and inexpensive cocatalyst [21]. In the past couple of decades, considerable efforts have been done in the field of replacing Pt with other low-cost cocatalysts and great achievements have been made [22–24]. More recently, to make further improvement in the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production, many investigations have been carried out using Ag metal to modify the photocatalyst. The main reason is that Ag is a relatively inexpensive noble metal. Moreover, metal Ag can improves the electron conductivity. Above all, the reported result indicated that improvement of local electromagnetic fields could be facilitated by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metal Ag. Consequently, electron and hole carriers could be generated promptly within photocatalysts. Apart from the SPR effect, a Schottky barrier can be formed by depositing the metal Ag on the g-C3N4, which scavenge swiftly the generated electrons and restrain the recombinaton of electron and hole charge carriers [25–27]. Up to now, heating method and photoreduction of AgNO3 are the most popular methods to deposit Ag on other photocatalysts, however, these methods often need harsh conditions [28,29]. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the applicatons of Ag-g-C3N4 composites are mainly concentrated in degradation of organic pollutants and other fields [30,31]. Herein, in this study, highly effective Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were prepared by depositing Ag on g-C3N4 using silver mirror reaction. The as-prepared photocatalyst were characterized systematically by XRD, FT-IR, UV–vis, XPS, SEM, TEM, PL etc. The photocatalytic performance of Ag-g-C3N4 photocatalysts were evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen production. The rseults indicated that the 5% Ag-g-C3N4 displayed the best hydrogen production rate of 568.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 39 times as high as that of bulk g-C3N4."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine and AgNO3 were purchased from Adamas (China) and Sinopharm (China), respectively, and these chemicals were used directly without further purification. In the whole experiment, deionized water were used to prepare all the solutions."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis Synthesis of g-C3N4: The preparation of g-C3N4 are as follows: 10 g of melamine was added in a closed quartz boat with a cover. The quartz boat was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h with heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and cooled to ambient conditions by naturally cooling. The yellow product was collected for further use. Synthesis of Ag-g-C3N4: 190 mg of aforementioned bulk g-C3N4 was dispersed in 20 mL deionized water in a 100 mL round-bottom flask then sonicated for 0.5 h to obtain a suspension. In addition, 16 mg AgNO3 was dissolved in 0.8 mL deionized water and 24 μL NH3·H2O was dissolved in 2.4 mL deionized water, respectively. Then, the AgNO3 solution was added dropwise to NH3·H2O solution to prepare the silver ammonia solution. Next, when the temperature in the flask reaches 40 °C, the silver ammonia solution was added slowly to the preceding suspension and stirred for 5 min at this temperature. And then, 8 μL formaldehyde was diluted by 8 mL deionized water and added to the flask. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 40 °C then cooled to room temperature. The resultant sample was washed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol three times, respectively. Then, the product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the 5% sample and named as A5-CN. The same method was used to prepared Ax-CN(x = 1, 3, 7, 9) by changing the quantity of g-C3N4 and AgNO3."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The phase structure was measured by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Dmax/Ultima IV diffractometer), employing Cu ka radiation (k = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 5–80° (2θ). The characteristic peaks of molecular functional groups were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra using Perkin-Elmar model 2000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Carl Zess, Gemini 500), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL JEM-2100F) were used to explore the morphology and microstructure. The optical absorption were examined by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Shimazu UV-3600 spectrophotometer) equipped with diffuse reflectance accessories, using BaSO4 as the reference sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded by a F-4600 FL Spectrophotometer fluorescence spectrometer (emission wavelength 378 nm). N2 adsorption experiments (Micromeritics 3020 instrument) were performed to explore the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution at 77.3 K."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production test,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production test An online photocatalytic test system (CEL-SPH2N system, CEAULIGHT) was used to perform the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments at room temperature. In detail, 20 mg of photocatalyst was added in 20 mL aqueous solution under continuously vigorous stirring. 2 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) acted as the sacrifical reagent to quench photogenerated holes. The photocatalytic reaction system was thoroughly evacuated prior to irradiation, then the system was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300). The evolved H2 was in situ analyzed periodically by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-7920)."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The preparation of the working electrode are as follows: 1 mL of ethanol and water mixed solvent (ethanol:water = 1:3 v/v) were mixed with 60 μL of Nafion (5 wt%). Then, 5 mg of photocatalys were mixed homogeneously with the mixed solution. Subsequently, 100 μL of the suspension was dropwise added onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode with a cover area of ~1 cm2. Transient photocurrent measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai). Typical three-electrode setup was used in the experiments, in which Pt foil act as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and the modified ITO glass as the working electrode, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte solution [32]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts As can be seen from Fig. 1 , the bulk g-C3N4 and all Ag-g-C3N4 composites present two distinct peaks at 13.4° and 27.5°. The weak peak at 13.4° could be indexed as (1 0 0) crystal plane for the in-plane structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine units, while the strong peak at 27.5° could be indexed as (0 0 2) plane for the stacking of conjugated aromatic systems [33,34]. Apart from the characteristic peak of g-C3N4, the Ag-g-C3N4 composites demonstrate peaks at 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.4° and 77.4° at the same time, which could be indexed as the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) crystal plane of Ag, respectively [35,36]. Obviously, there are no other diffraction peaks can be found in the composites, which demonstrate that the crystal structure of g-C3N4 is not affected by introducting the metal Ag. Moreover, as far as the A1-CN sample is concerned, diffraction peaks belonging to Ag are not observed because of the low content of Ag species and high dispersion in the composites. Meanwhile, it should be noted that with the increase of Ag contents, the diffraction intensities of the peak at 27.5° become weaker, while the diffraction intensities of the peak of Ag species become stronger. These observations indicate that the Ag species is actually loaded on the surface of g-C3N4. FT-IR results are presented in Fig. 2 . The strong and broad absorption peaks between 3000 and 3580 cm−1 are related to representative surface un-condensed amino groups. The peaks at 1200–1650 cm−1 correspond to the typical stretching vibration tri-s-trizaine hetercycle. Meanwhile, the characteristic peak at 810 cm−1 is attributed to the bending vibration of triazine units [37]. All these peaks are typically characteristic IR peaks of g-C3N4. Further, there are no distinct difference between g-C3N4 and Ag-g-C3N4 composites IR spectra, which from another angle indicate that the introduction of Ag cocatalyst onto the surface of g-C3N4 does not affect the structure of g-C3N4. Moreover, representative peak of Ag in Ag-g-C3N4 composites is not detected, which can be ascribed to the low amount of Ag species. SEM, TEM and HRTEM were used to explore the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 3 a shows the SEM image of bulk g-C3N4. It is obvious that bulk g-C3N4 displays relatively large and aggregated morphologies and layer structure with sizes of around hundreds of micrometers, which is the typical structure of bulk g-C3N4. The morphology of A5-CN samples are similar with that of bulk g-C3N4 (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c displays the TEM image of A5-CN. As can be seen clearly from Fig. 3c, the dispersed Ag particles on the surface of g-C3N4 are darker and about dozens of nanometers in diameter. The lattice fringes with d = 0.24 nm can be ascribed to the (1 1 1) crystallographic plane of cubic Ag by carefully measureing the lattice parameters in HRTEM (Fig. 3d) and prudently comparing with the JCPDS data. This result indicates that the Ag-g-C3N4 composites are indeed formed. Moreover, the HRTEM further implying that two materials contact very tightly. Formation of Ag-g-C3N4 composites and contact of two materials will definitely facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. The EDS element mapping analysis in Fig S1 also certifies the presence of C, N and Ag elements. The overall XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 4 a) of the A5-CN sample apparently indicates the existence of C, N, Ag and O elements, which is well accordance with the results of the EDS mapping analysis. The presence of O element can be ascribed to the surface absorption of oxygen-containing compounds such as H2O. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s is exhibited in Fig. 4b. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the C 1s XPS spectrum can be divided into three characteristic peaks located at 284.6 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.0 eV of binding energy. The peak at 284.6 eV is associated with the CC bonding in the triazine ring of g-C3N4. The peak at 286.2 eV corresponds to the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in the triazine rings bonded to the NH2 group (CNH2). Whereas the peak at 288.0 eV is attributed to the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms bonded with neighboring N atoms (NCN) of g-C3N4 [38,39]. The N 1s spectrum is demonstrated in Fig. 4c. The peaks located at 398.4 and 399.6 eV are identified as the sp2 hybridized nitrogen atoms in the triazine rings (CNC) and N-(C)3 groups, whereas the peaks centered at 400.9 and 404.4 eV can be attributed to the amino fuctional group (C-NH2) and the charging effects heterocycles, respectively [40,41]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the peaks at 367.9 and 374.0 eV is exclusively assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. The characteristic Ag3d5 peak that has a 6.0 eV splitting binding energy indicates the existence of metallic Ag0 species. This results further suggest that metallic Ag0 was successfully deposited on the surface of g-C3N4 [42,43]. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was carried out to explore the optical absorption of the as-prepared photocatalysts. As depicted in Fig. 5 , the bulk g-C3N4 and Ag-g-C3N4 photocatalysts demonstrated the semblable absorption spectra. Further, all catalysts without exception have light absorption from the ultraviolet region to the visible region, and the absorption band edges are about 460 nm. Compared with the bulk g-C3N4, the absorption band edges of Ag-g-C3N4 composites are found to be red-shifted. Moreover, the light harvesting in the visible light region is dramatically improved, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect of Ag. Consequently, the enhanced visible light absorption of Ag-g-C3N4 composites can definitely facilicate the production of more photogenerated charge carriers in the photocatalysis process, which is beneficial to enhancing the photocatalytic activities of the Ag-g-C3N4 composites [44,45]. In addition, through the Kubelka-Munk function, the band gap of g-C3N4, A1-CN, A3-CN, A5-CN, A7-CN, A9-CN composites are estimated to be 2.71 eV, 2.70 eV, 2.70 eV, 2.56 eV, 2.52 eV and 2.42 eV, respectively (Fig. 5b). This results indicate that with the increase of Ag contents, the band gaps become narrower and the visible light harvesting are improved markedly. To further explore the properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts, BET was carried out to study the pore sturcture and pore-size distribution adopting the Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments. Fig. S2 presents the the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the CN and A5-CN catalysts. The results indicated that both the catalysts demonstrate obvious type IV isotherms with distinct type IV isotherms. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are mesopores in the photocatalysts. Further, the specific surface area of A5-CN (13.38 m2•g−1) is slightly higher than that of CN (12.69 m2•g−1), which is corresponds to the results of SEM. Fig. S3 shows the pore-size distribution curves of CN and A5-CN catalysts. Apparently, both photocatalysts contain a lot of mesopores. Consequently, it can be concluded that specific surface area might not be the decisive or sole factor for speculating the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production To evaluate the photocatalyatic activities of the as-prepared photocatalysts, hydrogen production from water splitting was performed with triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor. As can be seen from Fig. 6 , the hydrogen production rate of bulk g-C3N4 is relatively low, which can be ascribed to the severe recombination of charge carriers. After loading 1% Ag on the surface of g-C3N4, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced prominently and the hydrogen production rate reachs 269.6. μmol·g−1·h−1. Further increasing the loading amount of Ag, the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysts are further enhanced. The hydrogen production rate for A3-CN、A5-CN、A7-CN and A9-CN are 330.6 μmol·g−1·h−1, 568.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, 491.1 μmol·g−1·h−1 and 369.8 μmol·g−1·h−1, respectively. This results indicate that the loading content of Ag exerts an important impact on the photocatalytic activities. Obviously, the 5% Ag composite exhibits the optimal hydrogen production rate, which is 39 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. Noteworthily, When the loading content of Ag exceeds 5%, a further increase in Ag content cause a rapid decrease in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. So, it can be concluded that when the loading content of Ag is optimal, the Ag can disperse well on the surface of g-C3N4, just as shown in Fig. 3c, which facilitates the separation and tranfer of the photogenerated charge carriers. However, excessive Ag amount may causes severe accumulation, which will leading to the decrease of the active sites and results in recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. To evalute the stability of A5-CN composite, recycling experiments were carried out under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 , during in three consecutive hydrogen production cycles with a total of 9 h reaction times, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of A5-CN composite experience tiny decrease, which indicates that Ag-g-C3N4 photocatalyst is stable and with excellent photocatalytic activities during the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production."
10,Photocatalytic mechanisms,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanisms Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is usually applied to explores transfer and recombination process of the photogenerated electron and holes. Generally speaking, the higher PL intensity of a photocatalyst states that the catalyst suffers from severe recombination of electron-hole pairs, while the lower PL intensity of a photocatalyst means higher charge separation efficiency [46]. Fig. 8 demonstrates the PL spectra of as-prepared g-C3N4 and Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocayalysts with different Ag contents. As shown in Fig. 8, compared with bulk g-C3N4, the PL peaks of the Ag-g-C3N4 composites are much lower, which indicates that the introduction of Ag species actually facilitates charge transfer and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, among all the Ag-g-C3N4 composites, the A5-CN photocatalyst presents the lowest intensity of the PL spectrum peak, suggesting a highest charge carriers separation efficiency and a lowest charge recombination rate, which is in accordance with the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Further, the transient photocurrent responses and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to explore the charge transfer dynamics in the interface of composite photocatalyst [47,48]. As can be seen from Fig. 9 a, the photocurrent densities of all samples are almost negligible under dark condiations, while the photocurrents increase dramatically under visile light irradiation. Meanwhile, the photocurrent response of A5-CN composite is higher than that of other photocatalysts, which indiates that A5-CN composite has the most efficient separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers. This photocurrent intensity is also consistent with performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The Nyquist imedance plots of EIS of the as-preapared samples are presented in Fig. 9b. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the radii of the Ag-g-C3N4 composites are significanly smaller. Moreover, among the Ag-g-C3N4 composites, the radius of the A5-CN composite is the smallest, indicating that the A5-CN composite possesses a highest charge charge separation and transfer efficiency, which also corresponds to the results of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the above results, a photocatalytic mechanism is tentatively proposed to explain the excellent charge separation and transfer efficiency of Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts and illustrated in Fig. 10 . When the Ag particles is deposited on the surface of g-C3N4, the visible light harvesting ability of Ag-g-C3N4 composites are markedly enhanced due to the SPR effect of Ag. Further, enhancement of local electromagnetic field can be induced due to the SPR effect of Ag particles, which will accelerate the generation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, when the Ag particles contact closely with the g-C3N4, a Schottky barriier are created at the interface of Ag and g-C3N4, due to the different and matched work functions and Fermi level of Ag and g-C3N4. Consequently, after visible light irradiating, a lower Fermi level of Ag nanoparticles compared to the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 rapidly speeds the scavenge and storge of photogenerated electrons from the g-C3N4 to suppress the recombination of charge cariers, which is corresponds to the results of PL, transient photocurrent responses and EIS. Subsequently, the photoinduced electrons transfer to the Ag particles react with H2O to produce hydrogen. Meanwhile, the holes at the valence band (VB) of g-C3N4 will react with TEOA as a sacrifical regent."
11,Conclusion,"To sum up, Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were successfully prepared by a sample polymerization and silver mirror reaction route for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The amount of Ag plays the crucial role in the photocatalytic activities. The optimal 5% Ag-g-C3N4 composite has the optimum hydrogen production activity, the hydrogen production rate was 568.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 39 times as high as that that of bulk g-C3N4. The possible photcatalytic mechanism is tentatively proposed on the basis of the PL, transient photocurrent response and EIS. The superior photocatalytic performance of the Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts can be ascribed to the SPR effect and Schottky barriers, which could rapidly generate electrons and holes within g-C3N4, accelerate transportation and separation of charge carriers and inhibit the charge recombination process. This work presents a novel and facile method to deposit Ag nanoparticles on the surface to prepare Ag-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the field of environment and energy."
