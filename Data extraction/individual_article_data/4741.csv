0,Introduction,"It is estimated that approximately 60% of the crude oil in reservoirs remains available for further use after conventional primary and secondary oil recovery. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is playing an increasingly significant role in the improvement of oil production [1]. Several EOR methods have already been employed to extract residual oil, and surfactant flooding is a commonly used technique [2–10]. Surfactants can increase oil recovery by reducing the oil/water interfacial tension (IFT) or modifying the wettability [2–7]. It is well known that the application of surfactants can effectively increase oil recovery and add huge economic benefits. However, there are a few essential problems that must be addressed immediately, such as the environmental effects and the ability to reduce IFT [11]. Several groups have paid more attention to investigating environmentally friendly and efficient surfactants for chemical EOR since the topic of “green” chemistry and chemical engineering was first proposed [12–23]. Li et al. reported the adsorption kinetics of phospholipid biosurfactants at the oil/water interface [13]. Then, they further investigated the effects of protein on the phospholipid biosurfactant monolayer at the air/water or oil/water interface [14–17]. Recently, Ahmadi et al. studied the ability of a natural surfactant with micro-sized particles of mulberry leaf to reduce the IFT between kerosene and water and found that the sweep efficiency can be increased from 49% to 66.8% of Original Oil In Place (OOIP) with the assistance of surfactant flooding [22]. In most of the above reports, the surfactants were directly extracted from the leaves or flowers of natural plants and were not further purified. The impure surfactants are not beneficial for studies of the action mechanism, which can influence their applications in development. To avoid this vital problem, we attempt to employ the typical nonionic biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterols (BPS-n) in chemical EOR. The BPS-n is produced by the physical pressing of corn or soybeans. Due to their remarkable nutritional and medicinal value, BPS-n has been referred to as “the key of life”. Moreover, the defined molecular structures of BPS-n aid in the intensive investigation of their action mechanism. A large number of reports have demonstrated that the IFT reduction of oil/water systems is the basic mechanism of surfactant flooding and that reducing IFT by two or more orders of magnitude can improve the oil recovery efficiency by tens of percent [4]. Thus, the IFT is generally desired to be lower than 10−2 mN/m in the practical applications. Due to the molecular structure of natural surfactants, the IFTs in the previous literature rarely achieved such a low value [18–23]. The addition of cosurfactant may be an effective way to further decrease the IFT, and alcohols with short chains are the most common cosurfactants [24–29]. The structure of the cosurfactant is similar to that of the surfactant. However, the cosurfactant cannot form micelles because of either poor water solubility or weak hydrophobic interaction. The introduction of cosurfactant to the surfactant and aqueous solution/oil system can increase the interfacial fluidity and molecular disorder, leading to a further reduction of the IFT. Iglauer et al. found that alkyl polyglycoside microemulsion consisting of an alcohol cosurfactant could decrease the IFT values of a water/oil system to 0.01mN/m or less. The oil recovery was as high as 85% of OOIP by the coreflood test [25]. Then, Jeirani et al. decreased the IFT values to 0.0001mN/m and increased the total oil recovery to 87% with the assistance of triglyceride-cosurfactant combinations [26]. Herein, we introduced the novel nonionic biosurfactant BPS-n to the new field of chemical EOR, which has rarely been reported. Then, we systematically investigated the effects of several factors (BPS-n concentration, salinity and temperature) on the IFT between BPS-n aqueous solutions and model oil (n-octane). Moreover, the cosurfactant alcohols with different chain lengths were added to further decrease the IFT."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterol (>98%, BPS-n, n=10, 20, or 30, where n is the number of oxyethylene units, Fig. 1 ) was a kind gift from Nikkol, Japan. Sodium chloride, n-octane, ethyl alcohol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and n-octanol were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company. All chemicals were analytical grade and used as received."
3,Measurement of interfacial tension,"2.2 Measurement of interfacial tension The interfacial tension between the model oil and water were directly measured via the spinning drop method on a TX-500C spinning drop interfacial tension apparatus (American CNG Company) as previously described [2]. The aqueous solution was primarily filled in the glass tube. Then, a droplet model oil was injected into the centre of the water phase. Finally, the interfacial tension was measured at the fixed rotating velocity (5000rpm) at the given temperature."
4,Results and discussion,"In the present study, n-octane was selected to replace the typical mixture of crude oil to eliminate the effects of asphaltene and other impurities."
5,The effects of biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterols (BPS-n) on the interfacial tension (IFT) of water/n-octane,"3.1 The effects of biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterols (BPS-n) on the interfacial tension (IFT) of water/n-octane As shown in Fig. 2 , there is a distinctly decreasing tendency for the three IFT curves with increased concentrations of the BPS-n aqueous solutions. Further, the IFT curves for BPS-20 and BPS-30 are almost coincident. This result suggests that the reduced level of the IFT is well below the BPS-n concentration of 1000mg/L, whereas the reduced level is moderate above that concentration. The three types of biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterols, BPS-10, 20, and 30, can effectively reduce the IFT of water/n-octane from 25.56mN/m to 8.01mN/m, 2.56mN/m, and 2.76mN/m, respectively. The main difference among the three biosurfactants is the length of the hydrophilic ethoxylated chain, which greatly affects the interfacial activity of the surfactant. This requires the hydrophilic property to be roughly equal to the hydrophobic property for the surfactant to best reduce the IFT. For BPS-10, the short hydrophilic ethoxylated chain is not beneficial to the interfacial absorption, which leads to a higher IFT value. Increasing the hydrophilic chain length (BPS-20, 30) can further enhance the interfacial activity, resulting in a lower IFT value. It is obvious that the IFT reduction is slight with the introduction of NaCl to our system (Fig. 3 ), even at a high concentration (100000mg/L). In general, inorganic salts can increase the effective surfactant concentration and largely decrease the IFT by neutralizing the charges in quantity at the interface [2,5]. In contrast, BPS-n is a typical nonionic surfactant, and there is an interaction between the ethoxylated chains and water molecules via hydrogen bonding. The repulsive force of the nonionic surfactant molecules adsorbing at the interface is much weaker than that of the charged ionic surfactant molecules. Thus, the nonionic surfactant molecules can arrange more closely at the interface, and the effects of the inorganic salts are actually weakened, resulting in the slight IFT reduction. It has been reported that temperature and salinity are the two most crucial factors for the interfacial activity of the surfactants. In the present study, a higher temperature can further reduce the IFT, and the tendencies of the IFT changes are similar for all three biosurfactants (Fig. 4 ). For example, the IFT at 80°C for the BPS-20 system is reduced to half that at 40°C, decreasing from 2.56mN/m to 1.31mN/m. Based on the phase inversion temperature (PIT) theory, Ye et al. systematically researched the effects of temperature on the IFT between crude oil and a nonionic surfactant aqueous solution [29]. We think that the PIT theory is also appropriate for our study. It is well known that the IFT reduction is determined by the surfactant adsorption at the interface and that the surfactant adsorption is closely related to the surfactant hydrophilic-lipophilic property. Thus, there is an optimal surfactant hydrophilic-lipophilic balance at which a reduced IFT can be achieved. A high temperature is not beneficial for hydrogen bonding because it decreases the surfactant hydrophilicity. Weaker hydrophilicity may be beneficial to the surfactant adsorption at the interface, leading to the lower IFT value. With the continuous increase in eco-awareness, many groups have paid more attention to the applications of biodegradable or natural surfactants in diverse fields, including chemical EOR [12–23]. However, the effectiveness of the biodegradable or natural surfactant to reduce the IFT was far from desirable, and the lowest IFT was still higher than 10mN/m [19,22,23]. The insufficient reduction of the IFT may greatly restrict the future applications. Based on the above results (Figs. 2–4), the IFT between the BPS-n aqueous solution and n-octane can achieve approximately 1mN/m. However, there is a significant gap between the present result and the practical application threshold (0.01mN/m or less). Thus, we attempt to introduce a cosurfactant to further reduce the IFT value."
6,The effects of cosurfactant alcohols on the IFT of BPS-30 aqueous solution/n-octane,"3.2 The effects of cosurfactant alcohols on the IFT of BPS-30 aqueous solution/n-octane The alcohols with short chains are considered to be ideal efficient cosurfactants with low toxicity in chemical EOR [24–28]. In our system, most alcohols showed favourable synergistic effects to reduce the IFT with BPS-30, and ultralow IFT (2.8×10−3 mN/m) is achieved with the addition of n-pentanol (Fig. 5 ). How can the addition of the alcohol in small quantities (2.0wt%) bring about such a dramatic IFT reduction? We think that the special molecular structure of the alcohol is the key factor. The amphipathic structure enables the surfactant BPS-30 to absorb at the interface. It is notable that the hydrophobic portion (the steroid ring and hydrocarbon chain) is much larger than the hydrophilic portion (the ethoxylated chain) (Fig. 1). Due to the stereo-hindrance effect of the steroid ring, the BPS-30 molecules have difficulty arranging closely at the interface, leading to moderate IFT reduction (Figs. 2–4). The amphipathic nature of the alcohol with the short chain is similar to but weaker than that of the surfactant. Thus, the alcohol can also enter the interface. The small size makes it easier for the alcohol molecules to insert into gaps among the BPS-30 molecules. The hydroxyl group of the alcohol can interact with the BPS-30 ethoxylated chain via hydrogen bonding, and there is hydrophobic interaction between the short chain of the alcohol and the hydrophobic portion of BPS-30. The alcohol plays important roles in at least two respects. On the one hand, the alcohol decreases the bending modulus and increases the fluidity of the interface. On the other hand, the alcohol increases the surfactant molecular arrangement at the interface [24]. Based on the above two effects, the IFT should be largely decreased with the addition of the alcohol. Interestingly, the ability to reduce the IFT seems to be closely related to the hydrophobic chain length of the alcohol (Fig. 5). A tentative explanation may be as follows. For ethyl alcohol or n-butanol, the hydrocarbon chain is too short, which can considerably weaken the amphipathic nature of the cosurfactant. The weaker amphipathic character is detrimental to the adsorption of the alcohols on the interface. Moreover, the alcohol molecules are induced to a uniform distribution in the whole solution under the Brownian motion. Thereby, the small adsorption quantity of the alcohol with too short of a chain severely affects the cosurfactant properties (Fig. 5b, c). If the hydrocarbon chain of the alcohol is too long (n-hexanol or n-octanol), a large number of cosurfactant molecules can easily enter the interface and insert into the gaps among the BPS-30 molecules. Meanwhile, the longer hydrocarbon chain may be more flexible and randomly bend [30]. The stereo-hindrance effect of the long hydrocarbon chain could slow the adsorption rate and decrease the adsorption of subsequent cosurfactant molecules. The reduction of the IFT with the addition of the long chain alcohol is much larger than that with the short chain alcohol (Fig. 5e, f), but it is still not the largest. A delicate equilibrium between the hydrocarbon chain length and the stereo-hindrance effect plays a key role in the distribution of the cosurfactant molecules at the interface. The optimal chain length of the n-pentanol with a smaller stereo-hindrance effect aids in the adsorption and the ordered arrangement of the cosurfactant molecules at the interface, resulting in an ultralow IFT value (Fig. 5d). n-pentanol was demonstrated to be the most effective cosurfactant for the BPS-30 system in the control experiments. Several significant factors were further investigated to confirm the effects of n-pentanol (Figs. 6–8 ). When the n-pentanol concentration was decreased to 1.0wt%, the IFT still reached 0.01mN/m, which also satisfied the practical application requirement (Fig. 6). If the n-pentanol concentration remained unchanged and we drastically decreased the BPS-30 concentration from 5000mg/L to 1000mg/L, the IFT was also lower than 0.01mN/m (Fig. 7). Then, the cost could be greatly reduced, which is the most vital factor for practical application. The temperature effect is similar in the presence or absence of cosurfactant (Fig. 8). As mentioned above, the temperature affected the IFT value by modifying the surfactant hydrophilic-lipophilic properties. The introduction of cosurfactant cannot change the surfactant property. It is reasonable to obtain a similar IFT change tendency under different temperatures (Figs. 4, 8)."
7,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we introduced the novel nonionic biosurfactant ethoxylated phytosterols (BPS-n) to the chemical EOR and evaluated their interfacial activities. Several key factors (BPS-n concentration, salinity and temperature) were investigated to demonstrate that the BPS-n could effectively reduce the IFT between water and model oil (n-octane). The cosurfactant alcohols showed excellent synergistic effects with BPS-30 to further reduce the IFT to satisfy practical application requirements. We have demonstrated that it is difficult for alcohols with shorter or longer chains to promote further IFT reduction. Surprisingly, the IFT can be decreased to an ultralow value (2.8×10−3 mN/m) by the addition of n-pentanol with an optimal chain length. The present study may broaden the use of biosurfactants and has greatly contributed to a deeper understanding of the roles of cosurfactants in IFT reduction."
