0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an absolute clean energy just because the unique product of its combustion is water. One of the main sources of hydrogen is from the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process based on petroleum refineries, another main source of it is from the steam reforming of methane based on natural gas route [1,2]. The both hydrogen production routes require large amount of external energy supply, which is determined by their thermodynamic feature of high endothermicity. Moreover, the energy is presently obtained by the combustion of fossil fuels accompanying with the emission of carbon dioxides. Obviously, it brings the environmental concerns from the initial exploitation to the end use of fossil resources. Water electrolysis could also produce high purity hydrogen, while the cost is quite expensive which mainly originated from the electricity, and the sustainability of this process is also determined by the way of electricity generation [3]. Biomass conversion for the hydrogen production seems to supply an alternative method that could minimize the impact on environment by closing the cycle of carbon footprint. Hydrogen is usually produced through the reforming reaction of the bio-liquid including ethanol, glycerol, sugar or bio-oils [4–7]. Glycerol is considered to be a potential candidate as hydrogen source because it is a by-product from bio-diesel industry with constant concentration of 10 wt.%, the hydrogen production from it was first realized through the aqueous phase reforming (APR) technology which is usually operated with pressure and catalyzed by noble metal based catalysts [1,8–10]. However, the steam reforming (SR) of glycerol for the production of hydrogen attracts larger attention as it allows the reaction to be performed under the atmospheric pressure although it overall behaves an endothermic reaction which consists of the consecutive cracking reaction (endothermic) and the water gas shift reaction (WGSR, exothermic). The noble metal catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 [11], Pt/La2O3/Al2O3 [12], Pt/SiO2 [13], Ru/MgAl2O4@Al [14], Ru/Al2O3 [15], Ir/La2O2CO3 [16] and RhCeZrCoOx [17] were widely investigated as the noble metals perform very well in both the activation of C-H and C-C bonds determining the catalytic activity, and the suppression of coke deposition determining the catalytic stability. Nevertheless, the use of the noble metal in catalysts means the increase in catalyst cost, and may requires a complex preparation procedure to obtain the highly dispersed and uniform particle size. In such context, the transition metal with abundant reservoir and low cost like Ni supplies a good option as it has excellent performances in breaking the CH and CC bonds, it is therefore widely used to catalyze the dry reforming [18–20] and steam reforming reactions [21–23]. Concerning the steam reforming of glycerol, the global reaction was usually considered to involve the consecutive glycerol decomposition and water gas shift reactions as follow: Global reaction: (1) C3H8O3 + 3H2O ⇋ 3CO + 7H2, ΔH 0 = 128 kJ/mol Glycerol decomposition: (2) C3H8O3 ⇋ 3CO + 4H2, ΔH 0 = 251 kJ/mol Water gas shift reaction: (3) CO + H2O ⇋ CO2 + H2, ΔH 0 = −41 kJ/mol The main side reactions include the methanation of CO and CO2, which would reduce the quantity of hydrogen in products: (4) CO + 3H2 ⇋ CH4 + H2O, ΔH 0 = −206 kJ/mol (5) CO2 + 4H2 ⇋ CH4 + 2H2O, ΔH 0 = −165 kJ/mol The coke formation could happen under the reaction conditions by: (6) CH4 ⇋ C + 2H2, ΔH0 = 75 kJ/mol (7) 2CO ⇋ C + CO2, ΔH 0 = −172 kJ/mol The presence of water in this system would favorer to the gasification of carbon, preventing it from depositing on catalyst surface: (8) C + H2O ⇋ CO + H2, ΔH0 = 131 kJ/mol As far as the catalyst is concerned, various catalytic systems including Ni/Al2O3 [24,25], Metal oxide (MgO [26], CeO2 [27] and La2O3 [28] etc.) modified Ni/Al2O3, Ni supported on porous silica materials [29,30], Ni/ZrO2(CeO2) [31,32], and Ni/ hydroxyapatite [33] were studied. In our previous work, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported Ni catalysts were developed and the prepared samples showed attractive catalytic performances in steam reforming of glycerol for the production of hydrogen [34]. It should be noted that the reaction over Ni/CNTs catalysts exhibited good low temperature activity between 350 to 450 °C, whereas it still had the room to improve the hydrogen selectivity particularly in the lower temperature range (≤375 °C). The endeavors were further paid to improve the hydrogen productivity in present work through introducing the secondary metal cations, leading to a bimetallics supported catalytic system MNi/CNTs. As aforementioned that the steam reforming of glycerol to produce hydrogen usually undergoes the consecutive cracking and water gas shift reaction, the latter one plays an important role in hydrogen generation by driving the reaction equilibrium move towards positive direction. Therefore, the metal Cu, Co and Fe were selected and added into the catalyst formula just because they are the classic components for water gas shift reaction [35–37]."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The multiwall carbon nanotubes purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemical Co. (COCC) were functionalized by refluxing in concentrated nitric acid prior to use as support, the details were described as in Ref. [34]. The bimetallics supported catalysts MNi/CNTs were prepared by a 2-step strategy, the Ni species was first loaded by impregnation method, the Ni/CNTs was formed after drying and calcination (450 °C, 4 h in N2 atmosphere). The appropriate amount of as-prepared Ni/CNTs was added into dimethylbenzene (1:15 in mass), the aqueous of metal salt nitrates (0.2 M) was then introduced under vigorous stirring, the homogeneous solution containing ammonium hydroxide and ammonium carbonate was afterwards added. The water was removed by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure after mechanic stirring for 3 h and ultrasonic treatment for another 3 h, the resultant was dried in a 100 °C oven for 12 h and finally calcined at 450 °C (ramp 5 °C/min) for 4 h in nitrogen flow. The catalyst was denoted as MNi/CNTs (MCo, Cu and Fe) where contents of M and Ni were 5 wt.%, respectively. Ni/CNTs with 10 wt.% was also prepares as comparison by 1-step impregnation."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization A Quantachrome Nova 1000e apparatus was employed to measure the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, pore volume and average pore diameter were calculated by Barrer–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The samples were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h prior to analysis. The crystalline phases of the catalysts were checked on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (CuKα, 40 kV, 35 mA, λ = 1.5406 Å). The patterns were collected in the range from 10° to 80° with steps of 0.026°/s and an acquisition time of 17 s. Surface chemical state and the composition were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which was carried out on a XSAM 800 spectrometer using Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The C1s peak of adventitious carbon was fixed to 284.5 eV as a reference. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was applied to analyze the reducibility on Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 system equipped with an U-type reactor and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical H2-TPR test, 25 mg sample was loaded in reactor and pretreated in N2 flow (30 mL/min) at 200 °C for 3 h to remove the impurity. The reduction process was performed from 100 °C to 700 °C in diluted hydrogen flow (10 mol.% H2 in Ar, 30 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. High-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode was measured on FEI Titan G2 60-300 (AC-TEM) apparatus combined with Super X detector, operating at 300 kV accelerating voltage. The deposited coke was quantified by running a TG (TA Instrument, model Q600, SDT V20.9) test on spent catalyst surface, the sample was heated from 50 to 800 °C in the O2/N2 (10/90 vol.) mixture with a ramp of 10 °C/min."
4,Catalytic glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production,"2.3 Catalytic glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production The gas-solid phase catalytic steam reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production was carried out in a conventional fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel, i.d.: 10 mm, length: 200 mm) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical test, 200 mg catalyst diluted with 1.8 g quartz sand (ϕ =0.30 mm) were loaded into isothermal zone of reactor, and then pre-reduced at 525 °C in H2/N2 mixture (1:1 in vol., 60 mL/min) for 2 h prior to introducing the glycerol. Once the catalyst bed was cooled down to the reaction temperature, the glycerol aqueous (10 wt.% in water) was pumped into a 250 °C chamber with a flow rate of 6.0 mL/h to generate the vapor which was finally transported into the reactor by N2 flow (60 mL/min). An online GC-TCD equipped with two packed columns (Porapak N: 4 mm o.d., 2 m length, Molecular sieves 13X: 4 mm o.d., 2 m length) was used to analyze the gaseous products including H2, CH4, CO and CO2 etc. An offline GC-FID equipped with a capillary column (KB InnoWAX: 0.35 mm i.d., 30 m length) was applied to analyze the liquid products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Porosity of the prepared catalysts,"3.1 Porosity of the prepared catalysts The textural properties were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption technique, the isotherms and pore size distribution were depicted on Fig. 1 a and b, respectively. The type IV isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop could be found for the all catalysts according to the IUPAC classification [38], suggesting the mesoporous feature of the materials. The capillary condensation for MNi/CNTs samples took place at lower relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.4) compared with that for Ni/CNTs (P/P0 = 0.8). Concerning the pore size distribution, the MNi/CNTs catalysts showed the similar distributions involving two regions from ca. 2.5 to 7 nm and from 7 to 70 nm. Be different from the MNi/CNTs samples, the Ni/CNTs showed three distribution regions from 2 to 3 nm, from 3 to 7 nm and from 7 to 70 nm. In addition, it was worth noting that the corresponding pore volume of Ni/CNTs was evidently different especially in higher pore size range, meaning that considerable amount of macropores existed. The textural properties including specific surface area, pore volume and the average pore diameter were reported in Table 1 , the CoNi/CNTs, CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs had higher values of 275.2, 282.4 and 269.6 m2/g in specific surface area, respectively, compared with Ni/CNTs (194.9 m2/g), but lower values in pore volume and average pore size since the same quantity of metals was loaded. Such results demonstrated that the preparation protocol has a profound influence on textural properties. MNi/CNTs prepared by a 2-step strategy could efficiently control the location of metal phases, having the Ni species located in the cave of CNTs and having the Co/Cu/Fe species located on the exterior. Ni/CNTs prepared by 1-step impregnation method made the most Ni species distributed in CNTs, probably leading to the pore filling particularly for the smaller size pore. As a result, large amount of macropores remains, that was the reason why the smaller surface area but larger pore volume and pore size were gain on Ni/CNTs. Obviously, the metal species could be more uniformly dispersed through the 2-step assembly of bimetallic catalysts."
7,Crystalline phase analysis by XRD,"3.2 Crystalline phase analysis by XRD The crystalline phases of the catalysts were checked by XRD, and the patterns for the calcined samples were depicted in Fig. 2 . The characteristic diffractions from the support CNTs located at 25.9° (not shown here) and 42.6°, the presence of the diffraction peaks at 36.9°, 43.6° and 62.9° confirmed that the Ni species existed mainly as NiO in calcined catalysts for the all samples. Besides these, the FeO (35.6 and 37.5°) and CuO (35.5, 38.6, and 43.2°) phases were detected for the CuNi/CNTs catalyst and FeNi/CNTs, respectively, despite the intensity of which were quite weak. Whereas no evident diffraction assigned to Co oxides was found from the corresponding patterns of CoNi/CNTs, but the existence of CoO and/or CoNiO2 could not be excluded as their diffractions maybe overlapped by those NiO phases. The weak diffraction at around 35.0° may indicate the existence of FeO for FeNi/CNTs sample. After reduction, the diffractions from NiO disappeared and the ones from metallic Ni appeared instead for Ni/CNTs, which could be clearly seen from Fig. 3 . While for the bimetallic catalysts MNi/CNTs, only a weak shoulder at ca. 44.6° from metallic Ni could be observed, and the NiO phase was still detected, indicating that the NiO phase was just partially reduced. Furthermore, the absence of the diffraction peaks at 52.0° indicated that the reduced metallic Ni may dispersed well on catalyst surface. The CuO was reduced to metallic Cu for CuNi/CNTs as the presence of the diffractions at 43.3 and 50.4°. The FeO phases may still exist in sample FeNi/CNTs as the broad and weak diffraction between 35 and 38° were detected. The pattern for CoNi/CNTs kept almost unchanged which suggested that no oxides were reduced in the hydrogen pretreatment. The crystalline phases analysis for the spent catalysts were reported in Fig. 4 , no obvious difference could be found for the spent Ni/CNTs, CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs samples when comparing diffractions with those for the reduced ones, the Ni species showed its mixed chemical states of Ni2+ and Ni0 for each. Besides these, the Cu species and the Fe species seemed no change after the reaction as the quite analogous diffraction patterns were obtained. The significant changes were from the sample CoNi/CNTs, the diffraction peak at ca. 43° split into two overlapped ones, resulting in the formation of isolated diffraction of metallic Ni. On the other hand, the diminish even disappear of the diffraction peaks assigned to Co oxides implied that the Co species could be reduced under the reaction conditions and thus formed a highly dispersed Co species with lower valent (probably metallic Co), which could supply a reasonable explanation on the absence of the diffractions from Co species for the spent sample."
8,Surface chemical state and composition determined by XPS,"3.3 Surface chemical state and composition determined by XPS XPS measurements offers a powerful solution to analyze the surface species of the catalysts, the Ni2p3/2 spectra were collected in Fig. 5 , showing two overlapped peaks in the binding energy (BE) range from 850 to 870 eV. The one centered at ca. 855.8 eV was assigned to Ni2+, which could be confirmed by the satellite peak appearing at around 5.8 eV higher BE side [39,40]. It was further deconvoluted into two peaks, suggesting the existence of two types of chemical state of Ni2+ species: free NiO at about 853.9 eV (I) and Ni(OH)2 (II) at about 856.0 eV which was generated by the strong interaction between NiO and the CNTs support [41]. The details on the peak information and their proportion were reported in Table 2 . Comparing with the bare catalyst Ni/CNTs, CuNi/CNTs sample showed a little bit lower proportion of free NiO (34.7% for Ni/CNTs vs 33.5% for CuNi/CNTs). On the contrary, the introduction of Co and Fe was able to enhance the formation of NiO, increasing by 33.7% to 46.4% and by 21.6% to 42.2%, respectively. The chemical state of the promotors in the calcined samples was checked and the spectra were shown in Fig. 6 . The surface cobalt species existed in Co2+ as the main peak located at 780.8 eV together with the shoulder peak at 786.5 eV [42]. For the Cu-promoted catalyst CuNi/CNTs the surface copper species existed in Cu2+ form which could be further confirmed by the strong satellite peak appearing at ca. 943 eV [37]. These results were good agreement with XRD measurements. The Fe2p3/2 spectra between 708 and 720 eV presented a main peak centered at 711.9 eV and a satellite peak at 718.6 eV which were assigned to the Fe3+ species [37]. Furthermore, the peaks at ca. 726 eV and ca. 734 eV in Fe2p1/2 spectra supplied another evidence for the presence of Fe3+. In addition, the peak at 710.3 eV together with its satellite locating at 714.0 suggested that Fe2+ species simultaneously existed on catalyst surface, although it was the minor part, taking up around 17.0% in Fe species according to the quantification results. Obviously, the mixed Fe oxides existed on FeNi/CNTs surface while only weak diffractions of FeO were detected by XRD. In order to explore the possible changes during the reaction, the XPS measurements were also carried out on the spent catalysts, the Ni2p3/2 spectra were shown in Fig. 7 and the quantified results were listed in Table 3 . The Ni2+ species were reduced for the all samples except CoNi/CNTs, leading to the formation of metallic Ni, the peak at ca. 852.8 eV was therefore detected. While not the all Ni species were reduced during the reaction, no metallic Ni0 was detected in CoNi/CNTs sample at all, and the partial reduction was found for the rests. As far as the chemical state of the promotors were concerned, the Co2+ species were partially reduced (atomic ratio: Co2+/Co0 = 66.4/33.6) under the reaction conditions as the peak at BE of 779.3 eV in Fig. 8 a originated from Co0 presented for the sample CoNi/CNTs. Similarly, the Cu2+ species and the Fe3+ was partially reduced to lower valents, corresponding to the metallic Cu0 (Fig. 8b) and Fe2+ (Fig. 8c), resulting a hybrid state for the promotors with different reduction degree (atomic ratio: Cu2+/Cu0 = 33.6/66.4 for CuNi/CNTs and Fe3+/Fe2+ = 57.1/42.9 for FeNi/CNTs)."
9,Reducibility determined by TPR,"3.4 Reducibility determined by TPR The hydrogen temperature programed reduction tests were performed to investigate the effects of promotors on catalysts reducibility, and the collected profiles were depicted in Fig. 9 . The bare catalyst Ni/CNTs consumed the hydrogen in a wide range from ca. 200 to 800 °C which was split into two isolated peaks at ca. 450 °C, corresponding to two reduction processes of Ni2+. The reduction peak below 450 °C (centered at ca. 389 °C) was usually due to the reduction of NiO which weakly interacted with the support, and the one at high temperature side (centered at ca. 550 °C) was probably related to the reduction of Ni2+ species which strongly interacted with the support like Ni(OH)2 [34]. The latter one could be observed for the all samples. The catalyst FeNi/CNTs exhibited a similar profile to Ni/CNTs, consisting of two overlapped reduction peaks centered at ca. 412 °C and 550 °C, respectively. The first one showed an obviously higher hydrogen consumption which should be the combined reductions of Ni2+ to Ni0 and of Fe3+ to Fe2+ [43]. Besides the main reduction peak centered at 550 °C, two another reduction processes could be seen for CuNi/CNTs sample from the TPR profile, locating the temperature range from 106 and 305 °C, and from 305 to 436 °C. The former one was ascribed to the consecutive reduction of Cu2+ → Cu+ → Cu0 [44], while the latter one corresponded the reduction of NiO like in the bare Ni/CNTs sample. Be different from the other samples, Co promoted CoNi/CNTs showed two main reduction process with the absence of the reduction of NiO, the reduction of CoO → Co0 was detected in the temperature range between 246 and 375 °C (centered at ca. 305 °C) [45,42]. As far as the consumed hydrogen was concerned, the quantified results in Table 4 showed the high temperature reduction (>525 °C) dominated the hydrogen consumption as more than 50% of which was obtained. Even less amount of hydrogen was consumed for the promoted samples, meaning that the reduction of catalysts was restricted. Nevertheless, it was not the truth since the reactions were pre-reduced at 525 °C. When the hydrogen consumption occurring below 525 °C was calculated, it was clear that the introduction of secondary metal into Ni/CNTs enhanced evidently the hydrogen consumption, and the reduction of corresponding metal oxides also contributed by extent. On recalling the findings from XPS, one can easily conclude that the reduction behavior of different catalysts kept consistent with them."
10,Morphology,"3.5 Morphology The HAADF-STEM combined with the EDS element mapping measurements were carried out on the selected sample CuNi/CNTs to check the distribution of metal cations and the results were depicted in Fig. 10 . It was clear from Fig. 10a and b that the metal cations distributed on both in the cave and on the external surface of CNTs. Precisely speaking, the Ni species were mainly located along with the cave although minor particles could be also found on the external wall from Fig. 10f. The Cu cations exhibited a full and uniform distribution on the whole CNTs by comparing the Fig. 10c, d and e, such a distribution feature indicated that the majority Cu cations were located on the external wall of CNTs. The results suggested that the locations of the metal cations were successfully controlled by the aforementioned preparation strategy. The TEM images and the corresponding particle size distribution over the calcined and spent MNi/CNTs (MCo, Cu and Fe) were gathered in Fig. 11 , the metal cations located internal and external the CNTs could be observed for the all catalysts. The calcined CoNi/CNTs showed a particle distribution from 5.0 to 9.5 nm with the mean size of 6.91 nm (Fig. 11a). The particle size distribution shifted to higher side between 5.5 to 12.0 nm with the mean size of 8.27 nm (Fig. 11b), which implied that the sintering of metal cations took place under the reaction conditions, resulting in the particle size increased by 19.7% and therefore showed a broad distribution after reaction. Similar results were also obtained for the samples CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs, the differences were from the influences of the secondary metal on the particle size which increased by 54.3% from 5.78 to 8.92 nm for former one and by 37.8% from 6.53 to 9.00 nm for the later one. Obviously, the introduction of the secondary metal cations could efficiently improve the ability of anti-sintering as the particle size increased by 66.8% for Ni/CNTs sample [34]. Furthermore, it seemed that the type of the secondary metal had an important effect on the sintering according to the variation of particle size. The agglomeration of metal cations was much graver than the other two samples, which was probably related to the sintering of metallic copper as it was quite easy to reduce at low temperature from TPR results."
11,Coke deposition determined by TG analysis,"3.6 Coke deposition determined by TG analysis Coke deposition is usually linked to the catalytic deactivation, and is quite often to occur for the dehydration reactions [46,47] and alcohol reforming reactions [48,49]. Therefore, it was investigated by running the TG analysis in diluted oxygen (10 vol.% in N2), the resulting weight loss was assigned to the combustion of deposited coke as the pretreatment of catalyst to remove the adsorbed water was done prior to the TG process. On the other hand, the TG behavior of the support CNTs was also studied as itself could burn in the oxidative atmosphere. The deposited coke was finally normalized by deducting the part from the support CNTs. The collected TG curves were illustrated in Fig. 12 , and the quantified results were listed in Table 5 . The support CNTs was burnt in the temperature range from ca. 500 to ca. 750 °C, leading to a continuous weight loss of 82.1%. The weight loss processes became much wider when the metal cations were loaded, which was strongly affected by the catalyst composition. It was obvious from the heat flow curves in Fig. 12 that the sample Ni/CNTs involved two main coke combustion processes centered at 375 °C and 467 °C, probably corresponding to the burn of amorphous carbon and graphite carbon, respectively, due to the latter one usually required higher temperature. The addition of Co into the Ni/CNTs sample resulted in the enhancement of the low temperature combustion process centering at 361 °C, in the bating of the high temperature one, and consequently in being overlapped. This result may imply that the introduction of Co may favor the formation of amorphous carbon during the reaction, which was quite different from the Cu- and Fe-promoted samples as higher combustion temperatures (485 °C for CuNi/CNTs and 540 °C for FeNi/CNTs) even higher than that of Ni/CNTs were required to remove the deposited coke. As far as the quantity of coke was concerned, FeNi/CNTs gave a maximum value of 0.43 mgC/mgcat., indicating that the coke was much easier to deposit over it among the catalysts, and the coke was hard to remove. Ni/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs showed comparable values (0.25 mgC/mgcat. for Ni/CNTs vs 0.23 mgC/mgcat. for FeNi/CNTs), but the coke formed on the latter one was more difficult to burn. CoNi/CNTs exhibited the best performance in coke resistance as the minimum value of deposited coke (0.05 mgC/mgcat.) was achieved, and the formed coke was easier to remove compared with the rest."
12,Catalytic evaluation,"3.7 Catalytic evaluation The steam reforming of glycerol for the hydrogen production was carried out at 375 °C under atmospheric pressure, the catalytic performances over the various samples were gather in Table 6 . Obviously, the introduction of Co, Cu and Fe could efficiently improve the global conversion of glycerol and the conversion to gaseous products. CoNi/CNTs showed the maximum conversion of glycerol (91%) but a minimum conversion to gas (58%) compared to those for the CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs samples, meaning that Co performed the weakest in promoting the generation of gaseous products. Nevertheless, the maximum hydrogen selectivity of 57% was gained over the CoNi/CNTs catalysts, and the maximum selectivity of CO2 (44%), the minimum selectivities of CO (12%) and CH4 (2%) were simultaneously obtained. Such a products distribution suggested that the addition of Co element could enhance the production of hydrogen under the combination effects of promoting the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O <=> H2 + CO2) and restricting the methanation reaction of CO/CO2. According to the XPS and TPR results, only Co species rather than Ni species in the sample CoNi/CNTs were reduced via the pre-reduction at 525 °C, the absence of metallic Ni sites was responsible for the low selectivity of CH4 as Ni-based catalysts were quite famous for methanation reaction [50–52]. Both CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs catalysts exhibited comparable hydrogen selectivity to the bare Ni/CNTs, but lower hydrogen selectivity than that of CoNi/CNTs, and CO was the majority part. The results suggested that the active sites for water gas shift reaction may be absent due to (i) the sintering of metallic copper after the pre-reduction for CuNi/CNTs and (ii) the absence of Fe composite oxides though part Fe3+ was able to be reduce to Fe2+ for FeNi/CNTs [53]. On the other hand, the metallic Ni sites through the partial reduction of Ni species in catalysts favored the methanation reaction, causing higher CH4 selectivity was obtained (6% for both CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs)."
13,Conclusions,"The bimetallic catalysts MNi/CNTs (MCo, Cu and Fe) with controlled metal location were successfully synthesized by a 2-step preparation strategy, having the Ni species locate in the cave and the secondary metal locate on the external surface of CNTs, the distribution could be clearly confirmed by HAADF-STEM images. The prepared catalysts offered the opportunity to make the metal species homogeneously disperse, therefore porosity of catalysts was improved compared with the bare catalyst Ni/CNTs which had the same content of metal from the N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. At the same time, the sintering of metal particles was also restricted according to the TEM results. The introduction of the secondary metal had profound influences on reducibility based on the XPS and TPR analysis, the Ni oxides was only partially reduced to metallic Ni0 under the reaction conditions for CuNi/CNTs and FeNi/CNTs with the exceptional of CoNi/CNTs where only Co species were reduced to metallic state. CuO was easy to reduce to metallic Cu0 which seemed much easier to agglomerate. The Fe3+ was reduced to a mediate state of Fe2+ rather than the metallic state. These features from the different samples further dominated the catalytic performances including the glycerol conversion and the products distribution just because they played different role in promoting the water gas shift reaction and the side methanation reaction. The coke deposition determined by TG, together with the sintering of active metal sites were still the two important factors in affecting the catalytic performances. As a result, the best performances for glycerol reforming for the production of hydrogen were achieved over CoNi/CNTs."
