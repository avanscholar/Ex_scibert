0,Introduction,"The design and construction of metal organic coordination compounds are of current interest in the fields of inorganic chemistry and crystal engineering. Metal complexes have found several applications in many areas of science, including catalysis [1], medicine [2], design of high value materials [3], analytical chemistry [4] and as model compounds with the structure and function of metalloproteins [5]. The metal oxidation state, the type and number of donor atoms, as well as their relative disposition within the ligand, are major factors determining the structure-activity relationships of the metal complexes [6]. Metal complexes with different oxidation states have a strong role in bioinorganic chemistry and redox enzyme systems [7,8], and may provide the basis of models for active sites of biological systems [9] or act as catalysts [10]. Nickel compounds also have useful applications such as ceramics [11], paints [12] and dyes [13], electroplating [14] and a mordant in the textile industry [15]. Dicyandiamide or cyanoguanidine contains an active nitrile group and has two tautomeric forms: NC–NC(NH2)2 and NC–NHC(NH)NH2. It is used in the production of a wide variety of organic compounds including slow and continuous nitrogen release fertilizers [16], fire proofing agents [17], epoxy laminates for circuit boards [18], powder coatings [19] and adhesives [20], water treatment chemicals [21], dye fixing [22], leather and rubber chemicals [23], explosives [24], pharmaceuticals [25]. The dicyandiamide and its derivatives have been used as ligands for the preparation of coordination metal complexes. In the presence of transition metals, dicyandiamide usually undergoes nucleophilic addition reactions with water, alcohols and amines resulting in the guanylurea, 1-amidino-O-alkylureas, and biguanides, respectively [26–33]. Notably, no reaction occurs between alcohols and dicyandiamide in the absence of metal ions. In a typical reaction, alcohol addition to dicyandiamide in presence of Cu(II) with reflux results in high yields [34]. However, in the presence of Ni(II) the same reaction requires longer reaction times and a base and yields in these reactions are low [35]. Recently, we reported the synthesis, photophysical properties and biological activities of bidentate ligands and their metal complexes [36–39]. In continuation of our work, we described the preparation and structural characterization of the square-planar nickel(II) complexes [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 (1), [Ni(L-Et)2](ClO4)2 (2), [Ni(L- n Pr-)2](ClO4)2 (3) and [Ni(L- n Bu)2](ClO4)2 (4)] (Fig. 1 ). The antimicrobial activities of the Ni(II) chelates were also examined by disk diffusion and spectrophotometric methods."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dicyandiamide (dcda) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and Ni(ClO4)2·6H2O from Strem Chemical Company, USA. All other materials used in the present work were reagent grade quality provided from Merck or Aldrich and used as received. Caution: Salts of perchlorate and their metal complexes are potentially explosive and should be handled with great care and in small quantities."
3,Physical measurements,"2.2 Physical measurements Microanalytical (carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen) data were obtained with a model CE-440 elemental analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Exactive+Triversa Nanomate mass spectrometer. The IR spectra were obtained (4000–400cm−1) using a Perkin Elmer spectrum 100 FTIR spectrophotometer. X-ray crystallographic data for the complexes were collected at 150(2)K on a Bruker Apex(II) CCD diffractometer using Mo-Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å) [40]. Data reduction was performed using Bruker SAINT [40]. SHELXS97 was used to solved and SHELXL2014/6 to refine the structure [41]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 using all the reflections [41]. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined using anisotropic atomic displacement parameters and hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were inserted at calculated positions using a riding model. Hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms were located from difference maps and refined with temperature factors riding on the carrier atom. In the structure of [Ni(L-Et)2](ClO4)2, the perchlorate anion is disordered and was modelled with 50% occupancy of two overlapping sites. Details of the crystal data and refinement are given Table 1 . Hydrogen bond parameters for the complexes are given in the Supplementary material."
4,Synthesis of the complexes,"2.3 Synthesis of the complexes The complexes were prepared by the reaction of two equivalents of dicyandiamide with one equivalent of Ni(ClO4)2·6H2O in presence of a base (NaOH) in the corresponding alcohol [31]. A typical preparation is described in the Section 2.3.1. 2.3.1 [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 (1) Ni(ClO4)2·6H2O (2.18g, 5.95mmol) dissolved in 20mL of methanol was added to dicyandiamide (1g, 12mmol) in methanol (15mL). To this solution, NaOH (0.08g, 2mmol) dissolved in 10mL of hot MeOH was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was refluxed for two days and then left to cool. The precipitated product was filtered off, washed several times with MeOH and diethyl ether and left to dry in air.

Lactis strain IL1403 [42]. Streptococcus thermophilus (NCFB2993) and Escherichia coli strain EC1000 [43] were used to determine if the synthesized nickel(II) metal complexes affect bacterial growth. IL1403 strain was grown at 30°C without aeration in 10mL GM17 medium. Streptococcus thermophilus (NCFB2993) strain was grown in SM17 at 42°C and Escherichia coli (EC1000) strain was grown in LB medium at 37°C with aeration in 10mL LB medium. The synthesized metal complexes were dissolved in DMSO in various (25, 50, 75, 150 and 250mg/mL) concentration and added 10mL growth media in different concentration. All bacterial growths were replicated three times and at the end of the 24th hour growths were measured at OD600 using spectrophotometer (Spectramax Plus 384, California, US)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis,"3.1 Synthesis In this study, four new Ni(II) complexes [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 (1), [Ni(L-Et)2](ClO4)2 (2), [Ni(L- n Pr)2](ClO4)2 (3) and [Ni(L- n Bu)2](ClO4)2 (4) were prepared from dicyandiamide (dcda) and Ni(ClO4)2·6H2O in presence of a base (NaOH) in the corresponding alcohol; methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol, respectively. The general preparation procedure for the complexes is shown in Fig. 1. The isolated yields of the complexes are low (10.5–35%) and the purity of the complexes was confirmed by elemental analyses. No further attempts to improve the yields were not carried out. The pure products were then used in the biological activity studies. All the nickel(II) chelates, [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 (1), [Ni(L-Et)2](ClO4)2 (2), [Ni(L- n Pr)2](ClO4)2 (3), and [Ni(L- n Bu)2](ClO4)2 (4) are orange, non-hygroscopic, stable at room temperature, and slightly soluble in most common organic solvent such as methanol and ethanol, but soluble in coordinating solvents as DMF and DMSO. As the length of the alkyl chain of the ligand increases, the solubility of the complexes in organic solvents increases."
7,Vibrational spectra,"3.2 Vibrational spectra IR spectra of the nickel(II) metal complexes were recorded in the range of 4000–400cm−1 and the bands of diagnostic importance are presented in experimental section. The sharp bands in the ranges 3456–3441cm−1 and 3366–3343cm−1 are due to NH2 asymmetric and symmetric stretches [44]. The spectra of the complexes showed strong and sharp bands at 3229–3248cm−1 which were attributed to ν(N–H) [45]. The bands due to ν(aliphatic C–H) groups were observed around 2993–2941cm−1 [46]. The IR spectra of the complexes show absence of a band at ca. 2157cm−1 due to nitrile group stretch ν(CN) indicating that nitrile group was completely absent in the complexes and new bands at ca. 970 and 1240cm−1 characteristic of ν s(C–O–C) and ν a(C–O–C) were observed [47]. The absence of the band due to nitrile group confirms the nucleophilic addition of an alcohol molecule to the nitrile group. This was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Conclusive evidence of the bonding is also shown by the observation of those new bands which appear at 564–553 assigned to (Ni–N) stretching vibrations. In the complexes, the presence of the ν(1071–1051cm−1) and ν(620–618cm−1) bands indicates that the Td symmetry of ClO4 − is maintained in the complex. It suggests that perchlorate ions are outside the coordination sphere [48]. In the spectrum of dcda, the band attributed to ν(CNH) occurs at 1625cm−1; in spectra of all the complexes, these bands appear in 1662–1655cm−1 region indicating the involvement of N-atom of the azomethine group in coordination. The increase in frequency of this band in the spectra of complexes is due to the increase in bond strength, again confirming the coordination via the –CNH nitrogen. The overall infrared spectral evidence suggests that the dcda ligand containing an OR group acts as bidentate ligand and coordinates through azomethine nitrogen atoms forming a five-membered chelate ring."
8,Mass spectra,"3.3 Mass spectra The ESI mass spectral studies for the Ni(II) complexes were performed and obtained data are given in the experimental section. ESI mass spectra of the complexes are shown in Fig. 2 . In the mass spectra of the complexes, single charged complex cation peaks {[Ni(L-R)2]ClO4}+ were observed. The mass spectra of the complexes showed single charged signals at m/z 289.07(100%), 317.10(100%), 345.13(100%) and 373.16(100%) assigned to {[Ni(L-Me)2]ClO4}+, {[Ni(L-Et)2]ClO4}+, {[Ni(L- n Pr-)2]ClO4}+ and {[Ni(L- n Bu)2]ClO4}+, respectively."
9,Crystal structures of the complexes (2–4),"3.4 Crystal structures of the complexes (2–4) Single crystals for complexes (2–4) were obtained by slow diffusion of diethylether into a DMF solution of the complex and the complexes (2–4) were found to crystallise as [Ni(L-R)2](ClO4)2 2DMF. Single crystals of complex (4) were also obtained from methanol-diethylether diffusion and the structure of the complex contains two methanol solvates per complex molecule (4).2MeOH. Bond lengths within the common [Ni(L-R)2]2+ core are listed in Table 2 , and these are very similar across the set of complexes. The local bonding around Ni(II) ion is very similar in each case; a perspective view of the complex cations are given in Fig. 3 . The Ni(II) ion in each complex sits on an inversion centre and has square planar geometry, coordinated to the imine nitrogen atoms with no significant interactions above or below the plane. As is the case for all the complexes, the coordinated nitrogen donors show convincing imine character while the short bond lengths across the ligand core provide evidence for π electron delocalisation. Although the local bonding around Ni(II) centers and bond lengths and angles are very similar in all complexes, crystal packing of the complexes are different in each complex due to different hydrogen bonding interactions. In all structures, the complex cations are linked by perchlorate anions via strong hydrogen bonding interactions [(NH(terminal)⋯OClO3]. The hydrogen bond parameters for all structures are given in the Supplementary file. DMF solvates in the complexes make bifurcated hydrogen bonding (as acceptor) with the terminal NH2 group and non-coordinated NH group producing a R1 2(6) hydrogen bonding motif. Additionally, in all three structures (2).2DMF, (3).2DMF and (4).2DMF, an oxygen atom of perchlorate oxygens involve in bifurcated hydrogen bonding with a pair of coordinated NH groups forming a pseudo-macrocycle and R1 2(6) motif. The hydrogen bond motifs in (2).2DMF is shown in Fig. 4 . In the structure of (2).2DMF, one of the hydrogen atoms of the terminal nitrogen atom (N1-H1A) makes bifurcated hydrogen bonding with two perchlorate ions linking complex cations. Packing diagram of (2).2DMF show that the cations are stitched together into a 3D network through hydrogen bonding to the perchlorate anion. In the structure of (3).2DMF, the cations are linked by two pairs of hydrogen bonds NH(terminal)⋯OClO3 resulting in a R4 4(10) hydrogen bond motif. These hydrogen bonding interactions further extended to the other symmetry related molecules to form planar 1D ribbons and the hydrogen bonding does not extend above or below the plane. The ribbons lie on the 2, −1, 1 set of planes. The hydrogen bonds are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Similar hydrogen bonded 1D ribbons are formed in the case of (4) 2DMF, but one of the perchlorate oxygen atoms makes bifurcated hydrogen bond with NH2 groups resulting in a R2 2(4) motif (Fig. 6 ). In the structure of (4).2MeOH, asymmetric unit contains two independent half cations in each of which the Ni(II) ion is located on an inversion centre. The structures of two independent complex molecules are almost identical differing only about the conformation of the butyl groups. The structure of the complex contains two methanol solvates per complex cations. As mentioned earlier, in the structure of the (4).2DMF, the complex cations are linked by NH⋯OClO3 hydrogen bond contacts forming 1D sheets and DMF solvates in the structures only involved in hydrogen bonding with NH group of each separate complex cations. However, replacement of DMF with MeOH solvates resulted in different packing topology in the structure. Each methanol solvate makes two hydrogen bonds with non-coordinated NH group (as acceptor) and perchlorate ion (as donor). The perchlorate anions link the cations into zigzag chains running parallel to the b axis. The hydrogen bonds are shown in the Fig. 7 . There are also perchlorate-mediated hydrogen bonds linking the chains together (see packing diagram in the Supplementary file) but no other notable interactions. Several dicyandiamide based Cu(II) complexes and their H-bond extended supramolecular structures have been reported in literature [33,36], however, there are only a few reports on the Ni(II) complexes of dicyandiamide derivatives [35]. The structural analogue [Ni(L-Me)2](sac)2 of the [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 was reported earlier with saccharinate(sac) counter ions. The crystal structure of the complex [Ni(L-Me)2](sac)2 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The local bonding around Ni(II) centre in [Ni(L-Me)2](sac)2 are very similar to the complexes reported in this work."
10,Microbial inhibition of the dcda and Ni(II) complexes,"3.5 Microbial inhibition of the dcda and Ni(II) complexes Three different reference strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the nickel(II) complexes. It is known that lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus) more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than gram negative bacteria and Escherichia coli. Various amounts of dcda and metal complexes containing (25, 50, 75, 150 and 250µg/mL) 10mL bacterial media were made and bacterial growth were measured at end of the 24th. EC1022 was more resistant to the complexes than the IL1403 or NCFB2993 strains. Especially IL1403 strain showed clear susceptibility to the dcda and Ni(II) complexes (Fig. 8 ). The nickel(II) chelate containing OCH2CH2CH3 group, [Ni(L- n Pr)2](ClO4)2 (3) is very inhibitive even 25µg/mL diluted concentration in IL1403 strain and bacterial growth was stopped after 50µg/mL concentration. [Ni(L-Me)2](ClO4)2 (1), [Ni(L-Et)2](ClO4)2 (2), and [Ni(L- n Bu)2](ClO4)2 (4) chelates were stopped IL1403 bacterial growth in 75µg/mL and higher concentration. Streptococcus thermophilus (NCFB2993) strain was more resistant than IL1403 and bacterial growth were affected after 50µg/mL concentration (Fig. 9 ). The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds in EC1022 were seen only in 250µg/mL concentration (Fig. 10 ). Also microbial activities of complexes were confirmed by the disk diffusion method in IL1403 due to strain susceptibility and results are shown in Fig. 11 . It was seen that the nickel(II) complexes displayed higher activity than the corresponding free ligand (dcda) against the same microorganism under identical experimental conditions. The possible cause of the increased toxicity of the metal chelates compared to that of the free dicyandiamide compound may be explained in terms of Tweedy’s chelation theory [49]. Chelation reduces the polarity of the central metal atom [Ni(II)] mainly because of partial sharing of its positive charge with the donor groups and possible п-electron delocalization within the whole chelate ring. Also, chelation increases the lipophilic nature of the central metal atom, which subsequently favours its permeation through the lipid layer of the cell membrane [50,51]. There are other factors which also increase activity such as solubility, conductivity and bond length between the nickel(II) ion and dicyandiamide ligand [52]. The structures of the complexes prepared in this work are very similar with different alkyl chains (methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl) and the antimicrobial activity results showed that the change in the alkyl chain does not have an effect in the activity of the complexes."
11,Conclusion,"The present work reports on the synthesis and structural characterization of nickel(II) complexes derived from dicyandiamide. Nucleophilic alcohol addition to the nitrile (–CN) group of the dcda were observed for all three complexes. X-ray structures of complexes (2–4) show that a pseudo-macrocycle formed via a bifurcated hydrogen bonding between an perchlorate oxygen and a pair of coordinated NH groups. Their activity against bacterial species Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Escherichia coli showed higher activity than free dcda against the same microorganism under identical experimental conditions."
