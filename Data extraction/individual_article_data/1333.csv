0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic polymer obtained from polyvinyl acetate during the complete or partial hydroxylation. About 650,000 tons of PVA are produced annually. PVA is used as a binder, shaping agent, raw material in some industries, including paper, textile, pharmaceutical, PVC and membrane industries (Thong et al., 2016). The excellent physical properties and chemical resistance of PVA have led to the widespread use of this resin in industry. Wastewater treatment of various industries, including petrochemical industries, is necessary due to their direct and indirect adverse effects on the environment and people's lives. Large amounts of PVA enter the environment from industrial effluents, which are harmful to the environment and human life. The remediation of PVA like other polymers in wastewater is challenging (Hamad et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2014). PVA is water-soluble, not biodegradable and emulsified properties in the environment. It can increase the discharge of heavy metals from sediments into water (Lin and Hsu, 2018). The release of PVA into the aqueous environment can lead to pollution problems if it is not treated correctly. It has white wastewater with COD content and in the environment can increase the viscosity of water. So, it is essential to remove the PVA or degrade their long chains in the wastewater before additional treatment (Ye et al., 2021). The PVA can be removed by the coagulation method, but still, a lot of PVA remained in the wastewater. As an instance, Solaro et al., realized that about 100% of PVA was destroyed after 70 days of cultivation (Solaro et al., 2000). Biological processes cannot remove these pollutants, and conventional treatment processes such as coagulation, flocculation, and adsorption are not effective because classical methods generate solid wastes and transfer contaminants from one phase to another. They cause environmental pollution, so the use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) will be necessary. In these processes, active free radicals such as hydroxyl are produced, which have high oxidizing power for the decomposition of organic contaminants based on their high oxidation potential (EOH• = 2.80 eV) (Lin and Hsu, 2018). These radicals have sufficient ability to react non-selectively with organic matter to obtain dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives until they are fully mineralized to CO2, water and mineral ions (Ilcin et al., 2010). To degrade PVA to safe products, including carbon dioxide and water, many approaches including biodegradation, electrocoagulation, adsorption, and chemical oxidation, have been developed. Biological and chemical processes have restrictions, such as needing extensive reaction times and high initial investment costs. Some branches of AOPs have been described on PVA degradation including photocatalytic (Lin and Hsu, 2013), ionizing radiation (Zimin et al., 2018), Fenton (Pan et al., 2020; Zhu and Ge, 2021), and peroxone systems (Zimin et al., 2018). Lately, the nanoparticles of NiFe2O4 (nickel ferrite) have involved much attention based on photocatalytic applications. It is a soft magnetic substantial with low electrical resistance. The bandgap and morphology have a significant role in photocatalytic applications (Lassoued et al., 2018). Some procedures have been employed to synthesize of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, including co-precipitation, combustion, sol-gel, microwave, sol-gel auto-combustion, and hydrothermal method (He et al., 2018). In this study, the co-precipitation technique was used because it is environmentally kindly, a simple process, and has fewer reaction times. Based on the previous works, it can be seen that the NiFe2O4 had a significant role in photocatalytic and magnetic requests. The spinel NiFe2O4 ferrite was synthesized through the sol-gel method by Li et al. (2014). The nano photocatalyst of NiFe2O4 was synthesized by chemical co-precipitation technique for degradation of methyl orange by Hirthna et al., and about 72% of dye was removed after 5 h of reaction (Hirthna et al., 2018). But, Sutka et al. (2015) found that 96% of methyl orange was degraded after 3 h of reaction by the anatase-NiFe2O4 nano catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method. One of the sub-branches of AOPs is photocatalysts, which have wide applications in removing pollutants from wastewater. The main weakness of photocatalytic process is that their efficiency is low specially for high concentration of pollutant and real wastewater treatment. Degradation of PVA as a resistant pollutant and describing the photocatalytic degradation mechanism in detail, are the novelty aspect of this work. In this study, the nanoparticles of NiFe2O4 were synthesized by the co-precipitation method and characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM approach. The degradation of synthetic effluents containing definite concentration of PVA by UV/NiFe2O4 process has been studied and important operational variables, including initial PVA concentration, catalyst amount and pH catalyst at a constant temperature of 25 °C have been optimized."
1,Experimental,
2,Material and apparatus,"2.1 Material and apparatus PVA with a molecular weight of 80,000 g/mol was purchased from Shuai Japan and the synthetic effluent was made from it in specific concentrations. The rest of the materials used were Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, FeCl2, Fe(NO3)2.9H2O, H2SO4, HCl and NaOH made by Merck Company. Throughout the study, distilled water was used. The XRD pattern of the NiFe2O4 nano photocatalyst was logged by XRD 6000 (Schimadzu model with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154 nm)) at a diffraction angle from 20° to 80°. The FTIR device was IFS 66 W Spectrometer model from Bruker. The SEM investigations were performed by JEOL, JSM- 67,001."
3,Preparation of NiFe2O4 catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of NiFe2O4 catalyst To prepare the NiFe2O4 nano photocatalyst by co-precipitation technique, a saturated solution of nickel nitrate [Ni(NO3)2•6H2O] was mixed with Ferrous nitrate [Fe(NO3)2.9H2O], then NaOH (0.1 M) was added to the mixture dropwise. A definite quantity of surfactant such as oleic acid was added to the solution. The mixtures were stirred steadily by a magnetic stirrer until the pH value reached up to 12. The resulting mixture was precipitated in alkaline condition and it was refluxed for 30 min. The product was cleaned with ethanol and distilled water to remove undesirable impurities and residual surfactants. Then, the mixture was filtered and the precipitate was placed in the oven for 2 h to be dried. Then the sample was placed in a muffle furnace for 5 h at 700 °C and the calcined precipitate was sieved with 100 mesh."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup As shown in Fig. 1 , the reactor used a UV lamp mounted horizontally on the reactor. The reactor volume was 2 L, which was placed in a heat bath to control the temperature. At first, the oxygen in a capsule has entered the reactor through a flowmeter with a specific flow rate over the bottom distributor of the reactor. The ultraviolet light source was a UV lamp made by the German company Philips with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of 43 cm with 15 W. The beams of this lamp shine horizontally on the surface of the solution."
5,Procedure,"2.4 Procedure To perform the photocatalytic process, specific solutions of PVA and catalyst were prepared. It was positioned in the reactor without light for 30 min until an equilibrium for the adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol molecules on the catalyst surface was established. The PVA molecules were adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface and the concentration of contaminant molecules decreased. Based on the experimental results, a significant decrease in the concentration of the PVA occurred after 30 min which the lamp was off; in other words, if 0.3 g /L of the catalyst was used, 41% of the initial concentration of PVA (25 mg/L) was adsorbed on the catalyst surface in neutral medium. Then the lamp was turned on and the reaction began. The temperature was set at 25 °C by the thermostat. Oxygen was also injected into the solution through a diffuser at the bottom of the reactor. The solution inside the reactor was mixed with oxygen through a stirrer to prevent any dead space and remain the mixture homogeneous. The sulfuric acid solution (0.1 M) was used to adjust the pH. Sampling was performed at 20 min intervals and centrifuged to separate the catalyst particles. Through a single-beam spectrophotometer model Agilent 5443, the maximum absorption wavelength at 690 nm was determined via the reaction of PVA with boric acid and iodine (Finley, 1961). The calibration diagram was plotted using the Beer-lambert equation and at different pHs, the relationship between adsorption and concentration was investigated (Eq. (1)). (1) A = ε . b . c The term A is absorbance, b is cell length(cm), and C is concentration(g/l). The solution was exposed to UV light for 140 min. In addition, the COD test was used according to the relevant standard. Influential factors in photocatalytic analysis (pH, photocatalyst concentration, PVA concentration) were investigated. The removal rate of PVA was given as a function of time with the following relation (Eq. (2)): (2) T h e R e m o v a l o f P V A ( % ) = ( [ P V A ] 0 − [ P V A ] t [ P V A ] 0 ) × 100 ( % ) Where [ P V A ] 0 and [ P V A ] t are the initial concentration of PVA at time of 0 and t, respectively."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results 3.1.1 XRD spectra The XRD pattern of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles was presented in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the single phase of cubic spinal crystal construction was formed. Within the perimeter of X-ray recognition, the NiFe2O4 had no contamination peaks. Through the broad peaks in XRD patterns, it can be concluded that the synthesized particles are in nanometer range. The crystal planes of spinel NiFe2O4 can be indexed by the peaks at the 2θ values of 32.1°, 36.5°, 44.0°, 53.0°, 57°, and 64° Additionally, sharp peaks were achieved and no significant shifts happened at the peak position. However, a drop in the peak intensity is originated from the promising creation of some amorphous construction. It should be noted that the average crystallite sizes of the NiFe2O4 catalyst can be estimated employing the Debye–Scherer (Eq. (3)) from the prominent diffraction peaks (Shokri, 2020). (3) d = K λ β C o s θ Where K is equal to 0.9 and β is the Perfect Width at Half- Maximum of the peak (FWHM), λ is the wavelength of the used X-ray and θ is the Bragg angle. Through Scherrer equation and the X-ray line broadening, the average crystalline size was calculated to be about 36 nm. 3.1.2 FT-IR spectra The FT-IR absorption spectrum of as-prepared NiFe2O4 nano-particles in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 is illustrated in Fig. 3 . It was employed to specify the chemical structure of the pollutant. In the range of 400–590 cm−1, the two kinds of metal-oxide absorption bands (M-O) are identified approving the production of spinel NiFe2O4. Usually, the IR bands of solid samples are related to the vibration of ions in the catalyst structure. The first and second absorption bands round 450 cm−1 and 582 cm−1 (Moradmard et al., 2015; Dumitrescu et al., 2015) are related to Fe–O and Ni–O metal oxide stretching vibrations at Fe–O stretching vibrations at tetrahedral A-site and octahedral B-site, respectively (Sattara et al., 2015). The bending vibrations of O–H at 1364 cm−1 are related to the absorbed OH− by ferrites (Dumitrescu et al., 2015). The absorption bands at 2849 and 2925 cm−1 are originated from intra-molecular stretching modes that stand up from various scopes of hydrogen bonding within the framework of tetrahedral bonded construction (Li et al., 2014). The distinguished bands at 3432 and 1628 cm−1 are related to bending vibrations of absorbed H2O molecules on nano-ferrites and O–H stretching, respectively (Sattara et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2013). 3.1.3 SEM images The SEM system was employed to specify the size distribution and morphology of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. Characteristic SEM images of synthesized NiFe2O4 are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The SEM micrograph shows that the catalyst holds micrometrical collection of small particles. The presence of free pore crystallite on the surface of catalyst can be indicated by a high dense agglomeration. The agglomerated form of NiFe2O4 was shown by SEM images. The nanoparticles clustered and grow into more immense assemblages, when they have high surface energies. According to the SEM image, the type and size of NiFe2O4 particles have been determined and it has good compatibility with the dimensions expected to perform the process. Based on the specified scale, the average particle size of the catalyst was 36 nm. 3.1.4 Method for determining the zero-point charge of NiFe2O4 catalyst The zero-charge point (ZPC) of catalyst was obtained through the following methos that, about 0.05 g of catalyst was added into eight Erlenmeyer flasks (100 mL) holding NaNO3 solution (0.1 M). The pH of the eight containers was controlled at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 by HNO3 and NaOH (0.01 mol L−1). Then, the solution blends were placed in an isothermal shaker at 25 °C for 24 h to be equilibrated. Then, after 24 h of equilibrating the final pH was measured and the pH of each container where its initial pH was equal to its final pH, introduced as ZPC. In this study, the ZPC of NiFe2O4 was achieved at pH of 7 (Hoseinzadeh et al., 2012)."
8,Effect of pH on the removal of PVA,"3.2 Effect of pH on the removal of PVA The pH has complicated influence on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency. Still generally, it depends on the pollutant type and the ZPC of photo catalyst, because the pH affects the electrostatic force between the catalyst and pollutant. The amount of the adsorbed pollutant on the catalyst surface and also its decomposition rate is supreme near the catalyst ZPC. The optimal pH for each type of pollutant varies based on its nature, therefore in general, the effect of pH cannot be expressed and should be determined for each type of pollutant in the laboratory individualistically (Arefieva et al., 2021). At determined pH, the charge of pollutant and catalyst surface, therefore the attraction and repulsion forces between them should be noted. The photocatalytic degradation of PVA is investigated at pH between 4 and 10, as shown in Fig. 5 . The best pH for degradation of pollutants is near the ZPC of the NiFe2O4 catalyst. The ZPC of the catalyst was measured at an approximate pH of 7, so the catalyst surface at pHs higher and lower than 7 was negative and positive, respectively. The interaction between the catalyst surface and PVA was different with pH changes. The catalyst surface was positive at 6, so the attraction between the catalyst and PVA with a negative charge was maximum and about 80.5% of it was removed under experimental conditions. In alkaline condition, hydroxide ions are plentiful and these ions inactivate the hydroxyl radicals produced by the photocatalytic process (Kiwaan et al., 2020). In addition, at alkaline pH the radical scavenging happened because of more hydroxyl radicals originated from hydroxide ions (Fig. 8) (Zyoud et al., 2019). Therefore, at a pH of 10 and under experimental conditions, the amount of PVA degradation decreased to 59.6%. In all tests, the pH was reduced slightly during the progress of the reaction due to the production of mineral acids. For example, the initial pH was adjusted at 10 at the start of treatment and reduced to 8 at the end of the treatment process."
9,Effect of photocatalyst concentration on degradation of PVA,"3.3 Effect of photocatalyst concentration on degradation of PVA As can be seen from Fig. 6 , to optimize the catalyst concentration in this study, experiments were performed by changing the catalyst concentration from 0.2 g/l to 0.5 g/l. The results displayed that by increasing the amount of NiFe2O4 from 0.2 g/l to 0.3 g/l, the degradation of PVA after 140 min increased from 87.2% to 94.3% and then by increasing the concentration of catalyst from 0.4 g/l to 0.5 g/l it was decreased to 88.5% and 83.6%, respectively. This finding can be clarified by the fact that increasing the concentration of catalyst will lead to an increase in the active surface of the catalyst, the number of electron pairs and positive holes, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals (Hanafi and Sapawe, 2020). In the first 30 min of the reaction, when the UV lamp was off in all experiments and only the process of adsorption of contaminants on the catalyst was performed, with a further increase in the amount of catalyst from 0.2 g/l to 0.3 g/l, the amount of contaminant removal increased from 36.5% to 53%, still, a further increase in the amount of catalyst from 0.3 g/l to 0.5 g/l, the pollutant removal not only did not increase, but it also decreased slightly. The reasons is that increasing the concentration of catalyst can cause light scattering in solution and excess amounts of solid catalyst prevent the penetration of light photons into solution and thus reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals (Qourzal et al., 2012). Catalyst particles at high concentrations become aggregated and agglomerated, so the number of active catalyst centers is reduced (Rostami et al., 2021). Therefore, 0.3 g/l of catalyst was determined as the optimal concentration of NiFe2O4. The catalyst must be used in the optimal amount. If the catalyst concentration is high, the radiant energy efficiency decreases due to ambient turbidity. However, the optimal amount of catalyst used intensely depends on the type and initial concentration of the pollutant and the rate of free radical production. The required amount of catalyst should be obtained first on a laboratory scale and under the desired conditions, and then its amount should be determined for a larger scale (Rostami et al., 2019; Alharbi et al., 2020). The content of reactor should be irradiated uniformly, and this subject is one of the significant problems in the industrialization of photocatalytic process (Gusain et al., 2019)."
10,Effect of initial PVA concentration on removal efficiency,"3.4 Effect of initial PVA concentration on removal efficiency The influence of initial concentrations of PVA from 25 to 70 mg/l was investigated on the photocatalytic efficiency and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . With increasing the initial concentration of polyvinyl alcohol, the rate of pollutant degradation decreased. At high initial PVA concentration (70 mg/l), the number of active centers and produced hydroxyl radicals were reduced because the PVA molecules also competed with the catalyst particles to absorb light and after 140 min, only 50.6% of the pollutant was destroyed. In addition, with increasing the initial concentration of PVA, they will react with more hydroxyl radicals, so the number of radicals and consequently the removal efficiency decreased (Zhang et al., 2020). Also, at high concentration of PVA molecules, many photons were absorbed by the them, subsequently the PVA degradation efficiency was decreased. High concentrations of contaminants can also act as catalyst toxins (Nezamzadeh-Ejhieh and Amiri, 2013). Oxidation of highly concentrated wastewaters does not occur by photo catalysts and they should be diluted. By reducing the PVA concentration from 55 to 25 mg/l and at optimum experimental conditions, the percentage of PVA removal increased from 55.5 to 94.3%. In addition, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model can be used to relate the reaction rate to the initial concentration of PVA, but the parameters of this model are highly dependent on the effluent structure and operating conditions (Pourfalatoon et al., 2021)."
11,The role of oxygen in the UV/NiFe2O4 process,"3.5 The role of oxygen in the UV/NiFe2O4 process The photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds is significantly increased in the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing species. The conduction band of NiFe2O4 has a potential equivalent to oxygen reduction potential Fig. 8 ). In many photocatalytic processes, the light-generated electrons in the conduction band of catalyst surface can react with the adsorbed oxygen and superoxide radicals ( O 2 − • ) were produced. Therefore, undesirable recombination of electron and hole were prevented (Eq. (10)) (Hekmatshoar et al., 2020). The superoxide radicals decompose the pollutants into carbon dioxide and water by reacting with building atoms and organic compounds. Since in the photocatalytic reaction, the transfer of an electron to oxygen is the rate-limiting step. Therefore, in this study through stirring, supplying oxygen by the capsule and shallow selection of the solution inside the reactors, the effect of oxygen concentration in the determining speed step was removed. The holes in the valence band oxidize the water molecules and the hydroxide ions adsorbed on the catalyst surface and produce hydroxyl radicals. The oxidation of pollutant molecules may happen either indirectly, through hydroxyl radicals attached to the surface, or directly through the positive cavities of the valence band before it is trapped inside or at the particle surface (Eqs. (7) and ((8)). The superoxide radicals formed from Eq. (10) may form hydrogen peroxide (Eq. (11)) and, by ultraviolet light, separate oxygenated water to form a hydroxyl radical that reacts with the intermediate compounds to form final products (Eq. (9)) (Xia et al., 2020). (4) NiF e 2 O 4 + hv → h vb + + e CB − (5) h vb + + e CB − → heat (6) h vb + + PVA → intermediates → C O 2 + H 2 O (7) h vb + + H 2 O ( ads ) → OH ads • + H + (8) h v b + + OH ads − → OH ads • (9) OH ads • + PVA ( ads ) → intermediates + OH ads • → CO 2 + H 2 O (10) e CB − + O 2 → O 2 − • (11) O 2 − • + O H • + H + → 1 2 O 2 + H 2 O 2"
12,COD removal efficiency,"3.6 COD removal efficiency As shown in Fig. 9 , about 18% and 22.5% of the COD was removed after 20 and 40 min from the beginning of the process when the UV lamp was off, based on the adsorption of pollutant molecules on the catalyst surface. With the onset of light irradiation and starting the reaction, the reduction of COD decreased because the molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface also began to break down and produce intermediate compounds that contained COD. Over time, these intermediate compounds were again attacked by hydroxyl radicals. Eventually, they became mineral compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. The COD amount originated from 25 mg/l of PVA at optimum conditions was 100 mg/l. Under optimal conditions in the PVA degradation process, although 94.3% of the contaminant was removed, only 41.3% of the COD removed, which indicates the production of intermediate compounds and the incompleteness of the PVA mineralization process (Ye et al., 2017)."
13,Investigation of photocatalytic degradation reaction kinetic,"3.7 Investigation of photocatalytic degradation reaction kinetic The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was used to describe the kinetic of the photocatalytic degradation reaction in aqueous environment. This model depends on the PVA degradation rate ( R P V A ), and PVA concentration ( C P V A ) as shown in the following equation (Eq. (12)): (12) R P V A = k r K a d C P V A 1 + K a d C P V A So, in Eq. (12), kr is the reaction rate constant and Kad is the absorption equilibrium constant on the photocatalyst surface. In this study, the adsorption of PVA on the catalyst surface was poor and also, in optimal conditions a lower concentration of PVA (25 mg/l) was used, so Eq. (11) was simplified and converted to a pseudo-first-order kinetic equation below with an apparent kapp rate constant. (13) R P V A = k r K a d C P V A = k a p p C P V A Using the test results, reaction rate constants were obtained using laboratory data and pseudo-first-order reaction rate equations, and these findings were consistent with the results of many researchers (Mirzaei et al., 2018; Zamri and Sapawe, 2019). After integrating from Eq. (13), the Eq. (14), is obtained. (14) l n ( [ P V A ] 0 [ P V A ] t ) = K a p p × t Where [ P V A ] 0 and [ P V A ] t are the concentration of PVA at the beginning of the reaction and time t, respectively. To evaluate these rate constants, the expression ln ( l n ( [ P V A ] 0 [ P V A ] t ) ) was plotted according to the reaction time (Fig. 10 ), and after analyzing the linear regression, the pseudo-first degree rate constant ( K a p p = 2.06 × 10 − 2 mi n − 1 ) and also the half-life of the reaction ( t 1 / 2 = 33.6 min ) were obtained."
14,Conclusion,"The catalyst nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation procedure and characterized by XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, and SEM techniques. The nano catalyst had the cubic spinal structure which was recognized by FTIR and XRD spectrum. The average particle size of catalyst was 36 nm. The UV/NiFe2O4 process was used to degrade PVA in batch reactors and it depend on catalyst dosage, initial PVA concentration and pH. Optimal conditions in degradation of PVA were obtained at 0.3 g/l of catalyst, 25 mg/l of PVA and pH at 6. About 94.3% of PVA and 41.3% of COD were removed, indicating the production of intermediate-resistant compounds and the incomplete mineralization of PVA. The reason for the formation of active radicals in photocatalytic methods is the electron-hole mechanism. With increasing the concentration of photocatalyst more than a certain amount, the photocatalytic efficiency was reduced due to the reduction of the number of received photons on the catalyst surface and the light scattering phenomenon. The kinetics of the PVA degradation process explained based on the Langmuir model and the apparent rate of the quasi-first-degree reaction ( K a p p = 2.06 × 10 − 2 mi n − 1 ) and the half-life of the reaction ( t 1 / 2 = 33.6 min ) was obtained."
