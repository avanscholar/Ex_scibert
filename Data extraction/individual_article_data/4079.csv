0,Introduction,"Chlorination entailing free radical halogenation (or substitution) reactions between organic compounds and either chlorine (Cl2) or chlorine-containing substances (e.g., ClO2 and OCl−) in the presence of ultraviolet light has been adopted widely for water disinfection, particularly in drinking water [1,2]. The chlorination process is characterized by its low cost, low power consumption, and potentially high capacity operation compared to other disinfection methods with ozone, ultraviolet (UV) light, or a combination. On the other hand, there are several drawbacks associated with the chlorination process, such as the occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are formed by interactions with natural organic matter (NOM) [3–7], and their health impacts from the bioaccumulation of toxic and carcinogenic hazards [8–11]. Processes capable of removing DBPs, such as chloroform, include aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities [12,13], as well as the Fenton [14] and photocatalytic reactions [15–18]. These processes, however, still suffer from long treatment times, low degradation performance, large-scale plants, and high maintenance costs, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and cost-effective treatment methods that can meet those challenges. Liquid phase plasma (LPP) forms a gas-phase plasma field with a high energy density from an electric discharge in water and aqueous solutions [19]. Chemical reactions occur in the presence of free radicals, ultraviolet (UV) light, and shock waves, which are generated under a gas-phase plasma field [20–26]. In particular, chemically activated species, such as hydroxyl radicals, as well as excited oxygen and hydrogen atoms are produced from dissociation, dissociative excitation, and ionization processes of molecules in the given plasma. Application studies of the LPP process reported a wide scope ranging from the synthesis of nanomaterials through surface modification to water and wastewater treatment [19,25,27–31]. Of these, the water treatment process was designed specifically to utilize the strong oxidizing power of chemically activated species, which played a key role in destroying complex organic compounds [32–34]. In addition, the LPP system has a simpler process compared to the traditional water treatment process, does not generate secondary waste, and has low process operation costs. In addition, the device has the advantage of being simple to implement and easy to maintain. In the previous studies, we performed decomposition experiments by LPP system using dyes that are easy to analyze, and examined the effect of each process variable [35–37]. On the other hand, few studies have been conducted to remove chloroform, which adversely affects the water quality, using plasma. Liu et al. conducted a decomposition experiment of chloroform in aqueous solution using glow discharge plasma and reported that it had superior energy efficiency and performance compared to other competitive treatment processes [38]. However, no study of plasma operating conditions and combination of additives has been conducted to improve the decomposition efficiency. In this study, the effects of plasma operation conditions (i.e., the applied voltage, frequency, and pulse width) on the production of chemical activated species were investigated, and the optimal operation conditions for chloroform degradation were derived. In addition, additives such as TiO2 and hydrogen peroxide were added to the LPP system to evaluate the effect on the chloroform degradation reaction. By comparing and evaluating the decomposition reaction rate constants according to the combination of LPP system and additives, an optimal combination method for efficient decomposition of chloroform was proposed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials and system design,"2.1 Materials and system design The target compound, chloroform, which was purchased from Wako Com., was used as received for the degradation experiments in the LPP process. The reactant solution containing chloroform was prepared using methyl alcohol (99.8 %, Daejung Chemicals and Metal Co., Ltd.) and deionized water (conductivity ≤ 2 μS/cm, Daejung Chemicals and Metal Co., Ltd.). Commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P-25, 80 % anatase and 20 % rutile) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, assay 35 %, Daejung Chemicals and Metal Co. Ltd.) were loaded at different concentrations to facilitate the destruction of chloroform during the LPP reaction. Fig. 1 presents a brief overview of the LPP system used in the degradation of chloroform. The system is divided into three main sections: 1) power supply (NTI-P1000WS, Nano Tech. Inc.); 2) reactor, in which the photocatalytic reaction took place; and 3) a solution tank used for circulation purposes. Note that the power supply was designed to regulate the applied voltage, frequency, and pulse width required for the LPP process in the reactor. The reactor in which the LPP reaction is formed has a cylindrical structure of 40 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length and is made of Pyrex. Tungsten electrodes (φ 2 mm, 99.95 % purity) wrapped with an insulator were arranged in parallel at the middle of the reactor. A plasma reaction occurred through breakdown by applying a voltage from the power supply to the electrodes. Two electrodes were placed 1 mm apart in space. The solution tank (ID 86 mm, OD 120 mm, H 160 mm) with a total capacity of 500 mL was double walled, and cooling water was circulated between the inside and outside walls to reduce the temperature in the solution tank, which had been increased during the LPP process. The solution tank was connected to the reactor using a tygon tube. The reactant solution traveled between the reactor and solution rank at a constant flow rate through a roller pump."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure A 1000 ppm stock solution of chloroform was diluted to 50 ppm for the experiments examining the degradation of chloroform by the LPP process. As chloroform is not readily soluble in water, it was added to a mixture of methyl alcohol and distilled water at a ratio of 1:9 to produce the 1000 ppm stock solution. A 500 mL stock solution diluted 20 fold was placed in the solution tank, and was circulated through the reactor at a flow rate of 400 mL/min. The photocatalytic experiments adopting the LPP process were performed at different applied voltages, frequencies, and pulse widths in the power supply. The rate of chloroform decomposition was evaluated by applying pseudo first order kinetics to samples obtained at different times between 0 and 240 min. As discussed briefly in the previous section, TiO2 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 g/L and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations ranging from 10−3 to 100 M were added to the stock solution to compare their degradation performance against the reference condition, i.e., without their loading. The chloroform decomposition experiments were performed three times for each experimental condition (power supply operation condition, TiO2, and H2O2 concentration), and the degradation rate was compared and evaluated using the average value. The intensities of the hydroxyl radicals, as well as excited hydrogen and oxygen, produced during the LPP reaction were examined by optical emission spectrometry (OES, AvaSpec-3648, Avantes Com.). The concentrations of chloroform in the reactant solution were quantified by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS, QP-2010 Ultra, Shimadzu Co. Ltd.). The samples collected at different time intervals were extracted with n-hexane (C6H14), and a drying agent, anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), was added to remove the moisture remaining in the extracts. An Rtx-624 capillary column (60 m ×0.25 mm ×1.40 μm) was adopted in the GC/MS system using ultra-high purity helium (as a carrier gas) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. An oven temperature of 40 °C was initially kept for 2 min, which was increased to 210 °C at a rate of 17 °C/min and then held at that temperature for 20 min. The GC/MS system was operated in dual mode, electron ionization (EI) and selected ion monitoring, with an electron beam energy of 70 eV."
4,Results and discussion,"A previous study reported that chemically activated species produced in the LPP reaction, such as hydroxyl radicals, as well as excited atomic hydrogen and oxygen, are quite sensitive to the experimental conditions, including the characteristics of the power supply, types of electrodes, and physical properties of aqueous solution [39]. Accordingly, this study initially assessed how the power supply in the LPP system modulated the occurrence of chemically activated species and the destruction of the target compound, chloroform. Note that the amounts of chemically activated species formed during the LPP reaction were detected by OES (see Fig. 1). Fig. 2 a presents the change in the amount of hydroxyl radicals and atomic oxygen, which varied according to the applied voltage (220–250 V) to the LPP system while maintaining a constant pulse width and frequency at 40 kHz and 5 μs, respectively. From the figure, the quantity of hydroxyl radicals and atomic oxygen generated by the LPP reaction increased with increasing applied voltage, specifically an abrupt increase in the concentration of hydroxyl radicals at 230 V. This suggests that the plasma field (in the gas phase) formed in the aqueous solution increased with increasing energy supplied to the tungsten electrodes, resulting in an increase in the concentration of chemically activated species available [40,41]. Fig. 2b shows the destruction of chloroform with different applied voltages. As shown in the figure, the rate of chloroform decomposition was accelerated progressively according to the increase in applied voltage. The degradation rate constant, k, (calculated from the pseudo first order rate law) were 5.43 × 10−3 min-1 (for 220 V), 8.20 × 10−3 min-1 (for 230 V), 9.71 × 10−3 min-1 (for 240 V), and 10.93 × 10−3 min-1 (for 250 V). The decomposition rate of chloroform at 230 V was about 1.5 fold higher than that at 220 V. Approximately 93 % of the chloroform had decomposed within 240 min at 250 V. As the electrical energy supplied to the LPP reactor increased, the amount of chemical activated species generated by the plasma reaction also increased, and thus the decomposition reaction rate of chloroform in the aqueous solution was affected. Among the chemical activated species generated by the LPP reaction, chloroform is decomposed by hydroxyl radicals and oxygen atom radicals and proceeds as follows. First, hydroxyl radicals generated in the LPP system react with chloroform to form trichloromethyl radical and H2O (Eq. (1)). Trichloromethyl radicals are strongly oxidized through reaction with O2 by the combination of oxygen atoms to change into trichloromethyl peroxyl radicals (Eq. (2)), and finally decompose into CO2 and chlorine ion (Cl-) (Eq. (3)) [18,42]. Oxygen atom radicals generated with hydroxy radicals react with chloroform to produce carbonyl dichloride and hydrogen chloride (Eq. (4)), and carbonyl dichloride is finally decomposed into CO2 and Cl2 [43] (1) CHCl3 + HO → CCl3 + H2O (2) CCl3 + O2 → OOCCl3 (3) O2CCl3 → CO2 + 3 Cl− (4) CHCl3 + O → COCl2 + HCl (5) COCl2 + O• → CO2 + Cl2 Similarly, this study investigated the relationship between the applied frequency in the LPP system and both the production of chemically activated species and the destruction of chloroform (see Fig. 3 a and b). In these experiments, the LPP reaction occurred as the applied frequency was varied from 20 to 40 kHz at regular intervals of 5 kHz. On the other hand, the applied voltage and pulse width were kept constant at 250 V and 5 μs, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the variation in the amount of hydroxyl radicals and excited oxygen as a function of the applied frequency. The quantity of hydroxyl radicals and atomic oxygen generated in the plasma field increased with increasing applied frequency. In particular, a significant increase in atomic oxygen was observed at 30 kHz. Note that the period (i.e., the duration of time for one cycle) was 50 μs and 25 μs at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. Mathematically, a reciprocal relationship was observed between the frequency and time period (in electrical waveforms). In addition, the pulse duration (i.e., pulse ""ON"" time) in a second increased with increasing applied frequency because the LPP system operates in a bipolar switching scheme with a leading positive pulse of 5 μs followed by a negative pulse of 5 μs for one full cycle (i.e., period). As a result, the production of chemically activated species under a high frequency of the LPP system was expected to be larger than that under a low frequency mode [41,44]. Fig. 3b shows the decomposition of chloroform measured at various times under different frequencies. Using the pseudo first order rate law, the rate of chloroform decomposition was 2.92 × 10−3 min-1 (for 20 kHz), 4.79 × 10−3 min-1 (for 25 kHz), 7.52 × 10−3 min-1 (for 30 kHz), 9.12 × 10−3 min-1 (for 35 kHz), and 10.93 × 10−3 min-1 (for 40 kHz). The degradation rate at 40 kHz was approximately 3.7 times faster than that at 20 kHz. Fig. 4 a and b shows the effects of the pulse width on the destruction of chloroform. A series of experiments was performed by varying the pulse width of the LPP system between 3 and 5 μs at a fixed applied voltage and frequency of 40 kHz and 5 μs, respectively. Degradation with a pulse width of less than 2 μs was excluded because of the extremely poor performance caused by instability of the plasma in an aqueous solution. From Fig. 4a, the increased pulse width resulted in the much more rapid destruction of chloroform; 68, 85, and 93 % of chloroform disappeared at 3, 4, and 5 μs, respectively. The target compound decomposed 2.4 times faster at 5 μs than at 3 μs. Under these conditions, the decay rate at 3, 4, and 5 μs was estimated to be 4.60 × 10−3 min-1, 8.15 × 10−3 min-1, and 10.93 × 10−3 min-1, respectively. Fig. 4b presents two example (digital) signals with different pulse widths, 3 and 5 μs, which were applied to the degradation of chloroform [45]. As discussed previously, a bipolar switching scheme, which produces an alternating rectangular wave between the positive and negative directions across the horizontal axis to minimize the electrical energy, was adopted in this LPP system. When the applied frequency of the LPP system was maintained at 40 kHz, the pulse repetition period, which is the time from the start of a pulse to the start of the next pulse, was 25 μs for both signals with different pulse widths. On the other hand, the duty cycles of the two waves representing the ratio of the pulse duration (i.e., pulse ""ON"" time) to the pulse interval (i.e., pulse ""OFF"" time) were significantly different. For example, when a wave had a pulse width of 3 μs with pulse duration of 6 μs (3 μs each in both positive and negative directions) and a pulse interval of 19 μs, the corresponding pulse duration and interval for the 5 μs pulse width were 10 and 15 μs, respectively. Therefore, a long pulse width was expected to increase the amount of energy transferred to the tungsten electrodes, which subsequently encouraged the generation of chemically activated species as well as the decomposition of chloroform. Fig. 5 presents the destruction of chloroform as a function of the amount of TiO2 powder added to the reactant solution. Degradation was performed independently with TiO2 at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g/L under the optimal operating conditions of the LPP system: applied voltage of 250 V, frequency of 40 kHz, and pulse width of 5 μs, as shown in Figs. 2–4. The level of degradation increased gradually with increasing TiO2 concentration from 0 to 0.2 g/L and then decreased significantly at 0.3 g/L. The decomposition of chloroform followed pseudo first order kinetics with rate constants of 13.07 × 10−3 min-1 (for 0.1 g/L TiO2) and 14.41 × 10−3 min-1 (for 0.2 g/L). This suggests that the decomposition rates at 0.1 and 0.2 g/L were approximately 19.5 % and 31.7 % higher than those at 0 g/L. The improvement in the decomposition rate from 0 to 0.2 g/L was attributed mainly to the increased production of powerful oxidizing species (such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxidants). The LPP process allowed the TiO2 surface to be activated at a wavelength of 300 nm, which helped generate and separate the electron-hole pairs. As the amount of TiO2 nanoparticles exposed to light at 300 nm increased, more activated species became available in the aqueous solution. On the other hand, degradation with a 0.3 g/L TiO2 loading was similar to that without a TiO2 loading (i.e., 0 g/L). This is because degradation by the LPP process is also modulated by the properties of the solution, such as conductivity. Through a series of trial and error to determine the optimal range, a conductivity ranging from 500 to 1500 μS/cm was found to yield the best degradation performance of chloroform. An overdose of TiO2 made the solution conductivity deviate from the most suitable range for degradation. Overall, the best degradation was achieved with a 0.2 g/L TiO2 loading under the ideal operating conditions. Fig. 6 presents the rate of chloroform decomposition according to the hydrogen peroxide concentration between 10−4 and 100 M. Note that the optimal operating conditions of the LPP system derived from Fig. 4 were adopted in these experiments. The degradation performance improved steadily from 0 to 10-1 M, but decreased drastically above this limit. Typically, degradation was found to be proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide added to the plasma-assisted reactions because hydrogen peroxide played a role in promoting the occurrence of oxidizing species, which efficiently destroyed complex molecules. On the other hand, excess hydrogen peroxide, such as 100 M, reduced the decomposition rate because of the formation of oxygen gas bubbles blocking the surface area of TiO2 available for degradation as well as its contribution as a scavenger of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals [46]. The degradation efficiency achieved for hydrogen peroxide at 100 M (k = 10.47 × 10-3 min-1) was 77.8 % of that observed at 10-1 M of hydrogen peroxide (k = 13.46 × 10-3 min-1). Fig. 7 shows the difference in the destruction of chloroform between with and without controlling the key experimental parameters (i.e., TiO2 and hydrogen peroxide loading) on top of the ideal operating conditions of the LPP system. That is, the basic degradation process (referred as LPP in the figure) occurred at an applied voltage of 250 V, frequency of 40 kHz, and pulse width of 5 μs. Single (containing either 0.2 g/L TiO2, referred as LPP-T, or 10−1 M hydrogen peroxide, referred as LPP-H) and dual parameters (containing a combination of both, referred as LPP-TH) were also adjusted under those reference conditions to compare the degradation performance. The target compound chloroform was increasingly destroyed in ascending order: LPP (k = 10.93 × 10-3 min−1), LPP-H (k = 13.46 × 10-3 min−1), LPP-T (k = 14.41 × 10-3 min−1), and LPP-TH (k = 18.63 × 10-3 min−1). These results showed that 1) the TiO2 loading had a larger impact on the destruction of chloroform than that of hydrogen peroxide, and 2) there was clear evidence of the synergistic effects of the dual parameters on the degradation of chloroform. Indeed, LPP-TH destroyed 98 % of chloroform at the end of the experiments (i.e., 240 min)."
5,Conclusions,"In this study, the LPP system was applied for the efficient removal of chloroform (DBP) generated by disinfection of drinking water and the effects of power operating conditions and additives on the decomposition behavior of chloroform were evaluated. The power operating conditions of the LPP system influenced the generation of chemical activated species, and the degradation reaction rate of chloroform was also affected. As the applied voltage, frequency, and pulse width were increased, plasma formation in the aqueous solution was increased, thereby improving the decomposition reaction rate of chloroform. The additives (TiO2 or hydrogen peroxide) added under the Optimal operating condition of LPP system showed the effect of improving the chloroform decomposition reaction rate, but the negative effect was shown to decrease the decomposition reaction rate of chloroform when excessively added. The addition of TiO2 and hydrogen peroxide to LPP system showed the best chloroform decomposition reaction rate and the reaction rate enhancement effect through the combination. The results of this study suggest the possibility of new advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) because water pollutants such as DBPs can be treated with high decomposition efficiency and fast decomposition rate."
