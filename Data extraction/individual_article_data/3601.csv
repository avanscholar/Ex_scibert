0,Introduction,"Current trends in the beverage industry show consumers’ shift towards more health-conscious products (Liguori et al., 2018; Blanco et al., 2016). Therefore, there is an incentive to create alternative alcohol-free options, which preserve the high quality of the original beverage. A sensory imbalance often observed in alcohol-free beers (AFBs) is the over-perception of wort flavors (Liguori et al., 2018; Blanco et al., 2016; Brányik et al., 2012; Mangindaan et al., 2018). These off-flavors are caused by so-called Strecker aldehydes, which are formed by a heat-induced reaction between a reducing sugar and an amino acid (Schonberg and Moubacher, 1952). In particular, 2-methylbutanal (2-MB), 3-methylbutanal (3-MB) and methional (MT) (Beal and Mottram, 1994; Perpète and Collin, 1999a) have been found responsible for the wort flavor, but also 2-methylpropanal (2-MP) is relevant at the concentration range in AFBs (Meilgaard, 1975). Due to the changed composition of AFB, flavor detection thresholds are significantly lower than in regular beer (Meilgaard, 1975; Piornos et al., 2019; Saison et al., 2009; Gernat et al., 2019). For instance, the odor of 3-MB is detected at 56μg/L in regular beer, while the threshold in AFB is with 0.44–0.61μg/L more than 91 times lower (Piornos et al., 2019; Saison et al., 2009). Their formation may also be caused by other reactive carbonyls, such as lipid derived carbonyls or quinones from polyphenol oxidation (Rizzi, 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2013; Hidalgo and Zamora, 2004; Delgado et al., 2015). As a result of the complexity of involved reaction pathways, it is difficult to prevent Strecker aldehyde formation (Saison et al., 2009; Baert et al., 2012). Therefore, new process designs are required to engineer the desired flavor profile and fine-tune the aroma concentration to the respective product (Gernat et al., 2019). For this study, 2-MB, 3-MB, Met, 2-MP and furfural (FF) were taken into account, where FF was regarded as a general indicator for flavor instability in beer (Andrés-Iglesias et al., 2016). Their structures and flavor descriptors are outlined in Fig. 1 . In brewing literature, studies have been performed on reducing Strecker aldehydes in alcohol-free beer by restricted or continuous fermentation (biological removal) (Van Iersel et al., 2000; Lehnert et al., 2008; Perpète and Collin, 1999b) or by addition of certain beer constituents, such as amino acids, wort proteins or polyphenols that bind or mask aldehydes (Perpète and Collin, 1999b, 2000a; Loredana et al., 2018). The drawbacks of these approaches are that the concentration of the target compounds is not sufficiently reduced and that ethanol is often a side product. Newer developments include membrane-based separation of flavors (Catarino et al., 2009; Catarino and Mendes, 2011) or adsorptive removal with activated carbon or resins (Shimizu and Takashio, 2003; Takura et al., 2012), but the selectivity for a targeted removal is still insufficient. Other approaches, as for instance extraction or reactive removal, have been restricted to an application in organic chemistry, food packaging or bulk chemical production (Gernat et al., 2019; Drese et al., 2011; Jeřábek et al., 1994; Suloff, 2002; DelNobile et al., 2002). Currently, there are no downstream unit operations available to selectively remove wort off-flavors without impacting the overall taste and nutritional quality of the product. The process requires a technology that combines a high selectivity at mild operation conditions with low capital investment and operational cost. A suitable choice for this challenging task is adsorption (Knaebel, 2008), which enables the separation of compounds present at low concentrations with a low heat impact on the product (Brauer, 1985). An application for the brewing industry was for instance demonstrated by Saffarionpour et al., who captured flavors on polymeric resins (Saffarionpour et al., 2016; Ottens et al., 2016). The goal of this article is to investigate the feasibility of a selective (off-)flavor removal step for the case of non-alcoholic beer by identifying a adsorbent material that can facilitate this specific separation under mild conditions. Therefore, batch uptake experiments with 21 adsorbents were performed in a hopped wort base to screen for the most promising separation medium. Three types of adsorbent were considered, i.e. hydrophobic resins (HR), amine-functionalized polymeric resins (AFP) and microporous silica-based materials (zeolites). The selection for further process development was then made based on a Pugh decision-matrix (Pugh, 1991). Subsequently, multicomponent isotherm data was determined by a mixture-amount design (Cornell, 2002), and a suitable model to describe the thermodynamic data was applied. Furthermore, the impact of the product constituents on the model parameters was measured to identify potential process bottlenecks. Finally, the best performing adsorbent was applied at pilot scale and the effect on the chemical composition of the product quality was assessed to provide a proof of principle."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals For the preparation of solutions, Milli-Q grade water (Merck Millipore, United States) or absolute ethanol (VWR International BV, The Netherlands) of analytic grade was used. The test kit 984345 for the enzymatic analysis of ethanol and free amino nitrogen (FAN) were purchased from Thermo Scientific (United States) and FoodLab (Italy), respectively. Iso-α-acids were acquired from Barth Haas Ltd (United Kingdom). All other chemicals were purchased in analytical grade from Sigma Aldrich."
3,Feedstocks,"2.2 Feedstocks Wort and alcohol- and hop-free beer produced by restricted fermentation were obtained from a local brewery. Original extract, alcohol content and the concentration of iso-α-acids are specified in Table 1 ."
4,Adsorbents,"2.3 Adsorbents Polymeric resins, listed in Table 2 , were investigated, differing in pore and particle size, surface area, and polymer type. Furthermore, amine-functionalized polymers and hydrophobic resins were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The AFPs were chosen based on their functional group as depicted in Table 3 . The presence of pores was not specified by the supplier and not visible by microscopic analysis (Supplementary material). A total of nine silica-based materials was selected to study different zeolite types and a range of the molar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (15–360) of different suppliers as specified in Table 4 . The specifications are as provided by the supplier, if not mentioned otherwise."
5,Experimental design,"2.4 Experimental design The experimental strategy for the adsorbent selection pursued in this work is outlined in Fig. 2 . In the first step, the adsorptive aldehyde removal of 21 resins was investigated by batch uptake experiments in the hopped wort base. This base was chosen, as it is the most concentrated base during the brewing process (16.7°P) with the highest concentration of aldehydes, but also sugars and hop acids, hence effects of competing constituents are expected to be most pre-dominant in this base. The phase ratios used in this experiment are 50g/gwet and 100g/gdry for polymeric resins and molecular sieves, respectively. Since the wet/dry-resin ratios are between 0.32–0.64gdry/gwet, these phase ratios are in a similar range. Preliminary experiments with varying phase ratios showed that the adsorption was linear in this range. In order to compare the capacity of all adsorbents with each other, the aldehyde loadings at 50g/gwet for all resins and 100g/gdry for silica-based materials were calculated. The obtained samples were additionally analyzed for change in pH and fading in color as well as the adsorbent’s reusability. For selected batches, the uptake of iso-α-acids, originating from hops, was measured. In the second step, the three most promising adsorbents were selected, and batch uptake experiments based on a five-component mixture-amount design without center points were performed with a fixed phase ratio of 1000gCCB/gdry (Cornell, 2002). Here, the base chosen was an AFB produced by cold contact fermentation. Cold contact fermented beer (CCB) is made by contacting wort at low temperatures of 0–1°C with yeast, so that the metabolism of the microorganism is restricted and ethanol production is minimal (Brányik et al., 2012). The concentration of aldehydes is reduced by the yeast to a certain extent (Perpète and Collin, 2000a), while the concentration of other compounds, such as sugars, stays nearly the same, meaning that wort and CCB mainly differ in their aldehyde concentration. However, in order to be able to study the impact of different beer constituents, the base in this stage of the study was brewed hop-free. An overview of the concentration levels (amounts) of all components at the low (−), and high (+) sub-level are given in Table 5 , where the ratio of the aldehydes to each other was fixed for each level. Thereby, chosen boundary conditions of the design are based on historic data for wort and CCB. The selected amounts of added aldehydes, caldehydes, added, are 0 (base), 850, 2700, and 3500μg/kg, respectively. These amounts were spiked to the hop-free CCB, resulting in the total aldehyde concentration, caldehydes, total, of the spiked base beer. Due to the bias related to determining volatile multicomponent samples, there are deviations between the targeted and actually measured concentration. In the third step, using the same CCB as above, model robustness studies were performed by spiking possibly-interfering molecules to batch uptake tests. The aim was to determine the impact of matrix constituents, polyphenols (represented by addition of 15mg/kg catechin), diketones (represented by addition of 50μg/kg 2,3-pentanedion), and sulphur compounds (represented by spiking with 40μg/kg of dimethyl sulphide (DMS)) on the adsorption efficiency at the upper end of the design space. Furthermore, the hop-originating molecules were assessed by spiking with 36.8mg/kg iso-α-acids (level of wort from screening experiment) and the influence of the pH variation (adjustment to wort pH 5.0 with 3M NaOH). The conditions tested in triplicate are shown in Fig. 3 . Finally, the ZSM-5 G-360 was tested at pilot scale at a phase ratio of 0.15 Ll/gdry to give a proof of concept and show the relevance of the results for the commercial scale."
6,Batch uptake experiments,"2.5 Batch uptake experiments Prior to each batch uptake experiment, adsorbents were washed in five consecutive steps with two volumes of 70vol.% of ethanol and three volumes of Milli-Q water, allowing the adsorbent to equilibrate 30min in the second and fourth washing step. Zeolites were dried at 220°C until they reached a stable weight to remove any residual liquid. The required amount of wet or dry resin was then added to a 40mL screw-top vial (Supelco). Next, 35g of wort or non-alcoholic beer were poured to the vial and spiked where applicable; the batch was stirred overnight with the screw top closed in a water bath at 15°C to reach equilibrium. Subsequently, the liquid was separated from the adsorbent by centrifugation and transferred into a fresh glass vial for analysis. By forming the mass balance, the loading of the adsorbent qi [μg/gads] was calculated according to Eq. (1), where cini,i and ce,i [μg/L] are the initial and equilibrium concentration of the aldehyde, respectively, mads [g] is the mass of added adsorbent, ml [g] is the mass of added wort or beer and ρl is the density of the wort or the beer. (1) q i = c i n i , i − c e , i m a d s m l ρ l"
7,Pilot scale test,"2.6 Pilot scale test For the pilot scale, a batch of hopped wort was fermented at 2–4°C to produce a CBB meeting similar specifications as the base used during laboratory scale tests. The temperature was chosen slightly higher than the recommended 1°C in order to avoid local freezing of the wort. The batch was then split into two vessels of 1.5hL, of which one was filled with 1.0kg of zeolite granules (ZSM-5 G-360) and stirred overnight. Both batches were subsequently standardized to 5.2°P and filtered over Kieselguhr, pasteurized and bottled."
8,Adsorbent regeneration,"2.7 Adsorbent regeneration In order to assess the reusability of the tested adsorbents, they were regenerated by the same procedure as described above and in the case of amine-functionalized resins, they were incubated overnight at room temperature in a 35mL of a 0.03647wt. % HCl solution. After neutralization with 2M NaOH solution, the materials were rinsed with Milli-Q water, filtered and used for the batch uptake procedure described in previous section."
9,Analysis of volatile aldehydes,"2.8 Analysis of volatile aldehydes Strecker aldehydes were analyzed by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) using a method adapted from Vesely et al. (2003), in a GC-MS (Agilent 7890A and 5975C MSD) and a 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm VF17MS column. The derivatization reaction was carried out with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1mL/min. The calibration was carried out for each medium so that matrix effects on the measurement were accounted for (Skoog et al., 1998)."
10,Analysis of iso-α-acids,"2.9 Analysis of iso-α-acids Iso-α-acids were analyzed by reversed phase UPLC (Waters Acquity, Milford, United States) equipped with a PDA detector and a BEH C18 1.7μm column (I.D. 2.1×150mm) according to the EBC method 7.8 “Iso-alpha-, alpha- and beta-acids in Hop and Isomerized Hop Extracts by HPLC” (Analytica, 2005)."
11,"Analysis of pH, color and original extract","2.10 Analysis of pH, color and original extract The determination of the specific gravity at 20°C/20°C and thus extract content of wort was obtained by digital density meters of the oscillation type (Xample 510, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria). For a quantitative measurement of changes in the beverage, the change in pH was measured with a pH-meter (Accumet Basics AB15, Fisher Scientific, Landsmeer, The Netherlands). The color was determined according to the EBC method 9.6 (White, 1995) with a Spectrostar Nano spectrophotometer supplied by BMG Labtech (Ortenberg, Germany). The color value was then calculated with the empirical formula (2), where A430nm is the absorption at 430nm and d the dilution factor. (2) c o l o u r E B C = A 430 n m ⋅ 25 ⋅ d"
12,Determination of leaching,"2.11 Determination of leaching A ligand leaching test for the amine-functionalized resins was performed using the LCK138 cuvette test kit for total N-content with a measuring range of 1–16mg/L (Hach, Tiel, The Netherlands). The resins were washed as described and incubated in an HCl solution at pH 5.1. Hereafter, the resins were separated from the liquid, which was analyzed for total N-content with a Hach DR3900 VIS spectrophotometer according to the method described by the manufacturer."
13,Analysis of ethanol,"2.12 Analysis of ethanol The ethanol concentration was measured with an enzymatic test kit available from Thermo Fisher Scientific (United States) as recommended in EBC method 9.3.1 (Analytica, 2013). The alcohol is enzymatically oxidized to acetaldehyde under alkaline conditions, which in turn is converted to acetate producing two moles of NADH per mole ethanol. The produced amount of NADH was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 340nm and 37°C with Thermo Fisher Scientific Gallary™ Plus Beermaster."
14,"Analysis of DMS, esters and higher alcohols","2.13 Analysis of DMS, esters and higher alcohols The concentration of volatile compounds other than aldehydes was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography (7820A, Agilent Technologies, The Netherlands) equipped with a flame ionization detector (7890B, Agilent Technologies, The Netherlands) as described in EBC method 9.39 (Analytica, 2000). The compounds were separated on a polar capillary narrow bore column (DBWaxETR, 60m×0.32mm ID, 1μm fused silica). 4-heptanon and 1-butanol were used as internal standard to increase the accuracy."
15,"Determination of foam stability, turbidity and FAN","2.14 Determination of foam stability, turbidity and FAN The foam stability was measured according to EBC method 9.42.1 with a NIBEM-T meter (Pentair Haffmans, The Netherlands) at room temperature (Analytica, 2004). The turbidity was analysed according to MEBAK method 2.14.1.2 “Haze formation: Optical Method” (MEBAK, 2013). FAN was determined with the CDR Beerlab FAN test kit with the procedure described by the manufacturer."
16,Calculations,
17,Pugh evaluation matrix,"3.1 Pugh evaluation matrix In order to identify the most promising adsorbents, a Pugh evaluation matrix was employed as a tool to rank tested materials based on their capacity, selectivity, costs and simplicity to industrialization according to Eq. (3), weighted 30%, 40%, 10% and 20%, respectively. The score of each category was assigned based on Table 6 . (3) Score = 0.3 ⋅ Scor e capacity + 0.4 ⋅ Scor e selectivity + 0.1 ⋅ Scor e costs + 0.2 ⋅ Scor e industrialization"
18,Isotherm model,"3.2 Isotherm model Due to the low concentration of investigated components, a linear adsorption isotherm model was used to describe the thermodynamic equilibrium as depicted in Eq. (4), where ki [L/gads] is the affinity constant characteristic for each component and adsorbent (Guiochon, 2006). (4) q i = k i c e , i"
19,Error analysis and regression,"3.3 Error analysis and regression The reported uncertainties were calculated, considering the statistical error resulting from random variation of measured values and the systematic error. The sample standard deviation and error propagation was calculated as described elsewhere (Young, 1962). For the systematic error only the uncertainty associated with the parameter regression of the calibration was taken into account, since other equipment errors were comparably negligible. To obtain the error of regressed isotherm parameters, the variance-covariance matrix M, calculated by multiplying the variance of the residuals of the best fit with the Jacobian J of the fitting function was used as described in Eq. (5). (5) M = J T J − 1 ∑ i = 1 n r e s i 2 n − p where n is the number of data points and p the number of regressed parameters. The diagonal of the covariance matrix contains the variances of each parameter (Tellinghuisen, 2001)."
20,Determination of logD and solubility,"3.4 Determination of logD and solubility The logD value was estimated with Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc. (ACD/Labs) (Advanced Chemistry Development, 2019). The experimental solubility at 25°C was taken from EPISuites™ (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2019) when available or estimated from logP with the same program."
21,Results & discussion,
22,Adsorbent screening,"4.1 Adsorbent screening In order to choose the most suitable separation medium, three different adsorbent types, i.e. hydrophobic resins, amine-functionalized resins, and zeolites, making up to 21 adsorbents, were selected for a screening experiment. Their performance with respect to capacity and selectivity are depicted in Tables 7 and 8 . In order to estimate and compare the capacity of the tested adsorbents, the adsorbent loading was calculated for 2-MB, 3-MB and Met, respectively. From the data presented, it is observed that the capacity of the hydrophobic resins is mainly related to the available surface area, rather than to the pore size or volume. Generally, the performance of poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) based resins is superior. From Table 7, it is conspicuous that amongst tested AFPs, only ethylenediamine (EthD)- and diethylenetriamine (DETA)-functionalized divinylpolystyrenes are comparable in capacity with the conventional hydrophobic resins. This might be due to the fact that the reaction of the primary amine group with the aldehyde to form an imine is not favorable enough to ensure selectivity over organic acids, ketones and other reactive compounds contained in the wort. EthD and DETA are able to form imidazoline rings with aldehydes, which is a more specific reaction mechanism. The hypothesis is that this mechanism causes the observed higher reduction in aldehydes for EthD and DETA. Having a denser loading of functional groups, EthD thereby achieves a higher degree of aldehyde removal than DETA. When considering product integrity and process variables such as throughput and capital investment costs, factors other than the capacity of reduction are highly important for selecting an optimal adsorbent. Therefore, the resulting wort-flavor reduced product was tested and evaluated for selected parameters, i.e. change in pH and color, and adsorption of iso-α-acids (hop constituents), as well as reusability. It is clear that the tested hydrophobic resins generally perform better with respect to the capacity, but more poorly in selectivity than most AFPs. This is because of the fact that all hydrophobic molecules in the feedstock interact with the solid surface, without any selectivity for functional groups or size. Nonetheless, these resins are tested in the food industry and FDA approved, enabling the fast scale-up and commercialization of this process. The theoretical loading of the AFPs depends on the number of moles of nitrogen attached to the resin. It can be easily determined by a stoichiometric relation, neglecting impact factors such as steric hindrance. For most resins, the theoretical capacity is by a factor of 104–105 higher than the achieved loading in competitive batch uptake experiments, i.e. other beer constituents react with the scavenger groups or the equilibrium is not favorable. There are two other disadvantages, which make AFPs unattractive to optimize flavor in food products. First, the kinetics of the reaction are observed to be very slow and temperature-dependent (data provided in Supplementary material), which may cause practical complications in food processing. Second, leaching of the functional group was measured (data not shown), which is an undesired effect and might lower the food safety and product quality. When regarding the tested molecular sieves in comparison, both – high reduction and selectivity – is achieved. The drawbacks of the (functionalized) resins are overcome by their 2-dimensional separation mechanism, which selects on hydrophobicity as well as size. The choice of a small and defined pore-size (<0.7nm) and a high SiO2/Al2O3-ratio are of uttermost importance for the efficiency of the removal step. For instance, if the performance of ZSM-5 P-360 is compared to ZSM-5 P-25, the zeolite with the lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio depicts a lower capacity for the flavor molecules, while a significant change in pH is observed. This indicates that ZSM-5 P-25 is also adsorbing small (organic) acids, despite the fact the pore size is the same. Similarly, a larger pore size of the beta- and Y-zeolites, lead to an increased uptake of larger molecules, such as iso-α-acids, potentially distorting the taste of the AFB. This in turn also reduces the affinity and hence the capacity of the adsorbent such as HiSiv1000. Interestingly, CP811C-300 and the β-zeolite from ACS Materials, show a different adsorption of iso-α-acids, despite the fact that their pore size and ring structure should be similar. Since CP811C-300 also exhibits a slightly higher surface area and the two-fold SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, it is also unexpected that it adsorbs less hop acids. Consequently, a Pugh evaluation matrix (Pugh, 1991) was used as a decision tool to select the three most promising out of 21 materials as depicted in Table 9 . Thereby, capacity, selectivity, costs and the ease of industrialization were taken into account, weighing the selectivity with 0.4 the most important category. Out of the tested adsorbents, molecular sieves generally show the highest score due to their superior selectivity and high capacity at acceptable material cost. However, one drawback considered for molecular sieves, is the not-established food-grade. Another difficulty is that they are often only available in powder or larger pellet form, both of which are not advantageous for the scale-up to an adsorption column. The highest rated zeolites CBV28014, ZSM-5 P-360 and HiSiv3000 are selected for further study. Ti-Silicalite is ruled out, since it was observed that the sample turned hazy after the treatment, most likely due to the catalytic activity of Ti. The β-zeolite slightly adsorbs iso-α-acids, which in turn makes them a less attractive option. In the next step, the selected zeolites are studied in more detail, to obtain their isotherm data in the complex food matrix as well as the effects of other beer constituents on the regressed adsorption parameter."
23,Isotherm determination,"4.2 Isotherm determination To determine the thermodynamic equilibrium data for the process design and to understand the multicomponent adsorption behavior, batch uptake experiments were performed in unhopped CCB. The adsorbent loading at the final equilibrium concentration was calculated, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4 . When considering the isotherm correlations in CCB, a clear linear relationship of the load and equilibrium concentration is found, indicating linear, non-competitive adsorption amongst aldehydes. Interestingly, the affinity constant ki (see Eq. (4)) of a compound is similar for all tested zeolites, with CBV28014 exhibiting slightly higher capacities for all aldehydes. This is due to the fact that these adsorbents all exhibit a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (>280), a similar surface area (∼380–400m2/g) and are of the same type (ZSM-5), ergo the micropore size is the same. Another observation made is that the value of the affinity constant is correlated to the aldehyde’s hydrophobicity. In the case of the studied aldehydes, the hydrophobic compounds 2- and 3-methylbutanal exhibit the highest affinity for the zeolites, while the affinity constants of methional, 2-methylpropanal and furfural are between factors of 6.2–33 smaller. The relation of the compound’s solubility and logD value to the regressed isotherm affinity constant is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. Here, the logarithmized isotherm affinity constant can be written as a linear function of the solubility in water or the logD value at pH 5.5, where the logD value is the octanol-water partition coefficient corrected for pH effects (ionization) (Xing and Glen, 2002). It should be noted that the goodness of the fit strongly depends on the available experimental data and predictive model values for the solubility and the logD and as such are susceptible to the algorithm employed. Since beer is a very complex matrix, such a correlation is useful to estimate and predict the adsorption of other molecules to the adsorbent and hence assess, whether or not these could compete for vacant space on the adsorbent. However, because this correlation is only based on five molecules of the same chemical group, this should only be seen as an indication and not to precisely predict the impact of each molecule on the adsorption equilibrium. Thus, the approach followed in this work is not to define a universal model, taking into account every unique constituent of the beer, but rather to group beer constituents and assess their impact on the adsorption of aldehydes. This is to estimate, whether or not a compound group could affect the measured adsorption parameters within defined variations in the process stream."
24,Identification of competing compounds,"4.3 Identification of competing compounds Table 10 lists important beer constituents and and their relevance for the regarded process. To indicate the significance for the adsorption process, ki is estimated based on the correlation in Figs. 5 and 6. It is obvious that many molecule groups can be excluded as competing molecules during the adsorption process. For instance, proteins are large molecules, which are not able to enter the small micropores of zeolites and hence are not directly impacting the adsorption equilibrium. Nonetheless, an indirect impact such as fouling or complexing with flavor compounds could be possible. Several hydrophilic compounds are small enough to diffuse into the pores, however, are expected to have a very low affinity for the adsorbent due to their hydrophilicity. Even so, if present in high concentrations, hydrophilic compounds could have an effect on the thermodynamic equilibrium. For instance, sugars are present at g/L level, which according to literature causes a “salting out” effect (Perpète and Collin, 2000b). This could lead to a higher affinity of hydrophobic molecules to the adsorbent. But since the sugar concentration is very well controllable during the brewing process, it is assumed to be a constant input parameter for the process and is not further studied. Most likely, small volatile molecules that resemble the studied aldehydes in size and hydrophobicity will compete for vacant space on the adsorbent. Although they occur with a defined concentration range, small deviations could impact the process robustness. For instance, components with a very high affinity to the adsorbent may take up more surface area and hence block vacant sites for aldehydes to attach. Furthermore, a change in the relative concentration ratios in the multicomponent system may influence the regressed affinity constants. Another aspect important for the process robustness are controlled changes in the input streams such as bitterness (related to hop acids) and pH. Esters and higher alcohols are expected to adsorb to the zeolite surface, however were not considered, since their concentration in alcohol-free beer is considerably low. Consequently, the previously studied CCB is spiked with selected competing beer constituents to show the effect on the regressed affinity constants within a realistic deviation in the feed stream. Changes considered were an increase of the pH from 4.4 (beer) to 5.0 (wort), the addition of 36.8mg/kg iso-alpha-acids (isohumulones) and a mix of other beer constituents. Based on Table 10, 2,3-pentanedione (50μg/kg), DMS (40μg/kg) and catechin (15mg/kg) were selected to investigate the effect of matrix compounds on the regressed adsorption model parameters, since they all exhibited relevant estimations of ki. The resulting regressed affinity constants are depicted in Fig. 7 . When comparing the affinity constants of the different bases with each other, it is conspicuous that there is a relatively high spread around the reference value of the affinity constant. For 2-MB for instance, k2-MB is around a third higher than the reference. Also, methional’s affinity towards HiSiv3000 and P-360 seems to increase slightly, but significantly, when the base composition is changed. Some explanation could be hypothesized such as that at the lower pH, an ion exchange could take place, where the ammonium is replaced with a proton. This exchange could lead to a reduced pore size and hence to a decreased affinity. However, since the variation in the affinity constant is not observed for all aldehydes and there is no systematic phenomenon to be established, a more likely explanation is that the variation is based on the limited number of measurements. This is expected, since the affinity constants, regressed in Fig. 7, are based on three measurements and not on a complete experimental design as shown in the previous section (isotherm determination). Nonetheless, there is no clear trend visible leading to the conclusion that ki is not affected by the changes in the beer base and that the regressed affinity constants of the isotherm model are robust within the standard deviations for the studied case of CBV28014, HiSiv 3000 and ZSM-5 P-360 and could be used to design a pilot or industrial scale process. For the pilot scale studies, the granular form of ZSM-5 P360 (G-360) was selected as it was readily available."
25,Proof of principle at pilot scale,"4.4 Proof of principle at pilot scale To demonstrate the applicability of the principle at industrial scale, a test was performed at pilot scale of 1.5hL using the same recipe as for the base beer as in previous section. Since it was shown that hop compounds do not interfere with the adsorption process, the base was also hopped. Both, the reference and the treated CCB were analyzed for their aldehyde concentration and general quality traits. The results are summarized in Fig. 8 and Table 11 , respectively. The aldehyde concentrations measured in the final product are generally significantly lower than the reference sample. In the case of furfural, a decrease of 70.2% is measured, while compounds present in lower concentrations are reduced by 43.7 (MT)–55.2 (2-MB) %. Since the concentration range is close, but well above the flavor detection threshold (Piornos et al. (2019)), it is expected that the reduction is also detectable by a sensory panel. However, based on the previously calculated affinity constants, the expected reduction was anticipated to be in the range of 90.5–99.6%. This difference could be explained by insufficient contact time and mixing during the tests. The granules exhibited a diameter of 2–3mm, which is disadvantageous for the mass transfer in particular in the liquid systems, since the ratio of particle surface area to volume is significantly lower and the diffusion path much longer than for the powdered material. Hence, in order to utilize the whole intracrystalline surface area for adsorption and thus capacity of the adsorbent, the molecules have to diffuse through the stagnant layer of the particles as well as the macro- and micropores. At less optimal mixing conditions, film mass transfer is affected causing a significant increase in equilibrium time. Due to their weight, a portion of the granules was not suspended in the beer during the test. Another explanation is that part of the granules might not at all be accessible for the liquid, since the zeolite crystals are shaped into a densely pressed material. Thus, only a fraction of the theoretical capacity is utilized. Overall, this could have let to the point that the measured system was not yet in its equilibrium state and the observed non-optimal performance. When comparing other quality parameters of the reference beer with the treated one, similar results were obtained for the color, ethanol and FAN concentration, original extract, pH and turbidity as depicted in Table 11. Small differences are found in the concentration of iso-α-acids, which is slightly increased and a decrease in foam stability of 7.8%. The latter might be due to the uptake of foam stabilizing components in the beer, while former is more difficult to explain. The concentration of alpha-acids was unchanged, indicating that no isomerization during the adsorption process could have occurred. Besides aldehydes, amyl alcohols, originally contained at 11.7mg/L, were also removed from the product, so that their final concentration is below the detection limit (<1.1mg/L). On the contrary, the amount of acetaldehyde was only slightly affected (decrease of 10%, from 1.9 to 1.7mg/L). The concentrations of DMS and esters were below the detection limit and hence adsorption could not be observed. These findings correlate well with the results from the screening test and it is hence concluded that with some optimization of the mixing tank and zeolite granules, the process is scalable to industrial capacity."
26,Conclusion,"This study successfully identified an adsorbent that can selectively remove wort flavor from complex food streams, such as alcohol-free beers. Out of the tested adsorbent, i.e. amine-functionalized polymers, hydrophobic resins and zeolites, the latter scored highest in their potential for selective wort flavor removal. Although zeolites have been used before to remove undesirable molecules from foodstuffs, the technology was applied to wort flavor removal from alcohol-free beers and a more fundamental approach was taken to systematically analyze the constituents of the complex mixture and to gain insight into their impact on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the involved adsorption mechanism. The experimental effort was reduced by combining a comprehensive screening experiment with a mixture-amount experimental design. In doing so, we showed that the suitability of the adsorbent is related to the matrix composition and that a careful selection of pore diameter and SiO2/Al2O3-ratio is required to achieve the desirable selectivity. Hydrophobic ZSM-5 type zeolites achieved the best performance. Their adsorption equilibrium could be described with a linear isotherm in the AFB matrix, indicating a non-competitive adsorption step in this given matrix. The regressed affinity constants were directly related to the hydrophobicity of the flavor compounds. Consequently, it was shown that small changes in the matrix do not affect the regressed affinity constants. It is hence possible to design a new processing operation based on this data that facilitates a controlled off-flavor capture. Furthermore, a pilot scale test showed promising results with regard to the reduction in wort flavor. In the next step, it is aimed to prove the impact on the sensory perception with a trained panel. Moreover, this technology is transferrable to other food systems and not restricted to a capturing step only. By extending the isotherm database to more flavors, a chromatographic separation and fractionation step could be introduced to fine-tune or control the aroma profile of foodstuffs. Future work should consequently also focus on the correlation of the measured flavor profile and the actual aroma and taste as evaluated by a sensory panel."
