0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is an accepted clean and sustainable energy carrier as it can generate highly efficient electricity using fuel cells [1–4]. However, fossil fuels are used as feedstock for most of hydrogen production processes such as gasification, steam reforming and autothermal reforming [5–12]. Undoubtedly, the dependence on fossil fuels will lead to depletion of finite energy resources and serious environmental problems [12,13]. Therefore, the development of cleaner, safer and more efficient technologies for hydrogen production is required [14–17]. In this context, hydrogen production from renewable biomass (non-food-related biomass) is highly desired. Biomass is naturally derived from solar energy, water and carbon dioxide through photosynthesis [18–21]. Thus, the conversion of biomass to hydrogen at low temperature is close to a CO2-neutral emission process, which can contribute to the mitigation of global warming and resource depletion [12]. So far, thermal (e.g. gasification and pyrolysis) and biological (e.g. biophotolysis, biological water–gas shift reaction and fermentation) processes dominate the hydrogen production field from biomass [12,15]. However, many bottlenecks such as harsh conditions, high cost, low heat efficiency, low hydrogen conversion and purification downstream process required for removing fuel cell inhibitors significantly limit their commercialization [22,23]. Thus, the development of methods for more ecofriendly and economical hydrogen processes from biomass is urgently needed. Formic acid has been considered as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) for improvement in safety and storage issues of hydrogen owing to its high chemical stability, and high hydrogen capacity (4.4 wt%) [24–29]. The current commercial formic acid production is mainly based on fossil fuel, an energy-intensive, and high-pressure process(>4.0 MPa) [30,31]. In addition, the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 can convert CO2 to formic acid, but such a process still stays on the laboratory scale because the combination of the process with carbon capture storage (CCS) processes remains a challenge [32,33]. In contrast, inspired by the fact that formic acid and can be produced as intermediate of biomass hydrothermal process [34,35], Zhang et al. [12] reported a sustainable biomass-formic acid-hydrogen (BFH) conversion process, comprised of the hydrolysis-oxidation step of biomass in the presence of diluted mineral acid (0.7 wt%)/higher pressure oxygen gas (3.0 MPa), and formic acid dehydrogenation step using homogeneous catalyst. However, several drawbacks, such as a safety issue of higher pressure oxygen gas, and difficulty in a recovery problem of homogeneous catalysts in the dehydrogenation step [36] should be improved for commercialization of the BFH process. In addition, it is necessary to replace toxic mineral acids by more eco-friendly ones, while the formic acid yield from biomass should be improved at the same time. In this study, we proposed the BFH conversion process to improve sustainability, comprised of mechanocatalytic depolymerization step using citric acid as cheaper, sustainable and eco-friendly organic acid catalysts, hydrolysis-oxidation step with hydrogen peroxide as lower pressure oxidant and DMSO as co-solvent, and formic acid dehydrogenation step using heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalyst. The mechanocatalytic depolymerization process as a pretreatment process, which decrease the average molecular weight of the biomass, could promote the conversion of biomass by facilitating the contact between the substrate and catalysts during the hydrolysis/oxidation step in comparison to using the raw biomass without the mechanocatalytic depolymerization process as a pretreatment process. As a second strategy to achieve further improvement in formic acid yield, we increased the amount of oxidizing agent and introduced of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent. As a result, we achieved 50.03% of formic acid yield using organic acid as a catalyst. Subsequently, after eliminating byproducts by filter paper or distillation (third step), hydrogen was produced by the formic acid dehydrogenation step with heterogeneous catalysts (Pd catalysts supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6, Pd/NH2-OH-KIE-6) at room temperature (final step). The lignin-free crude formic acid (LCF) solution and distilled formic acid (DF) solution with similar formic acid concentrations showed 66.21 and 279.24 mol H2 mol catalyst-1h−1 turnover frequency (TOF) at 10 min, respectively. CO and CH4 gas, as an inhibitor for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), were not observed."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental material,"2.1 Experimental material Red pine powder (G-BIOTECH CO., LTD, Korea, 600 um under size) was used for the conversion to formic acid in this study. The components of the biomass was shown in Table 1 . The citric acid (Sigma Aldrich) was employed as acid catalysts for hydrolysis of biomass. Hydrogen peroxide (34.5%, Samchun) was applied as oxidizing agents. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 98%, Samchun) was utilized as an organic solvent to promote the conversion to formic acid. To prepare the formic acid dehydrogenation catalyst, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol (EtOH), ammonia (NH3), glycerol, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS), palladium nitrate hydrate, and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sodium formate (Sigma Aldrich) was used as an additive for the dehydrogenation."
3,Conversion from raw biomass to the crude formic acid (CF) solution,"2.2 Conversion from raw biomass to the crude formic acid (CF) solution All hydrothermal treatment experiments for conversion from biomass to the crude formic acid (CF) solution were conducted in an autoclave reactor made of SUS 304 with an internal volume of 500 mL. Raw biomass, DI water, citric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and DMSO were put into the autoclave reactor, and was mixed vigorously and sealed. The mixing ratio of the liquid is shown in detail in Table 2 and Table S1. After the loading procedure, the autoclave reactor was heated to the target temperature via an oil bath. After the reaction, the autoclave reactor was immediately drenched in a cooling water bath."
4,Impregnation of raw biomass with citric acid as a catalyst,"2.3 Impregnation of raw biomass with citric acid as a catalyst The citric acid (10.5, 21.0, and 31.5 g) was added into ethanol (450 mL) and stirred for 30 min, followed by addition of biomass (30 g) into the solution. After the solvent was removed at 50 °C, citric acid-impregnated biomass (CIB) was obtained as a powder."
5,Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of citric-acid-impregnated biomass,"2.4 Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of citric-acid-impregnated biomass The mechanocatalytic depolymerization process was carried out using a blender. CIB was pulverized in a blender at 15,000 rpm (Braun, Tribute Collection blender, 1.75 L) and room temperature for 10 min. The temperature inside the blender was not higher than 40 °C during the mechanocatalytic depolymerization process. Mechanocatalytically depolymerized CIB (MD-CIB) was obtained as a powder and used directly in the hydrothermal treatment experiments."
6,Conversion from MD-CIB to the crude formic acid (CF) solution,"2.5 Conversion from MD-CIB to the crude formic acid (CF) solution MD-CIB, DI water, hydrogen peroxide, and DMSO were put into the autoclave reactor, and was mixed vigorously and sealed. The mixing ratio of the liquid is shown in detail in Table 2 and Table S1. After the loading procedure, the autoclave reactor was heated to the target temperature via an oil bath. After the reaction, the autoclave reactor was immediately drenched in a cooling water bath. The results of all hydrolysis-oxidation experiments are summarized in the Table 2 and Table S1."
7,Preparation of formic acid dehydrogenation catalysts,"2.6 Preparation of formic acid dehydrogenation catalysts The synthesis method of heterogeneous catalysts for the formic acid dehydrogenation has been described in previous publications of our group [37–41]. For preparation of the mesoporous silica support KIE-6, silica sol (5 nm of silica particle size) was synthesized via a base-catalyzed reaction. A mixed solution of NH3 and H2O and a mixed solution of TEOS and EtOH were mixed and vigorously stirred. This mixed solution (TEOS, EtOH, NH3 and H2O) was refluxed under agitation at 50 °C for 3 h. In order to obtain mesoporous silica, glycerol (4 g) and sulfuric acid (10 wt% of glycerol) were added into the silica sol (30 mL), and was dried at 150 °C for 24 h in air for elimination of the solvent and pre-carbonization of the glycerol. Thereafter, it was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in air. Before the amine functionalization of the KIE-6 surface, we carried out the hydroxylation of the KIE-6 surface for maximization of the amine functionalization on the support surface (KIE-6). The 1 g of KIE-6 and 67 mL of 17.7 wt% HCl were stirred for 12 h. After washing three times using DI water and drying at room temperature, we obtained hydroxylated mesoporous silica (OH-KIE-6). For the amine functionalization, OH-KIE-6 (1.5 g) and APTMS (3.75 mL) were added into toluene (150 mL). The mixture solution was refluxed at 110 °C for 3 h without stirring. Subsequently, the unreacted APTMS was removed using DI water through washing and filtration. After drying at room temperature for 24 h, the hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica (NH2-OH-KIE-6) was collected. Next, in order to prepare 9 wt% Pd catalysts supported on NH2-OH-KIE-6, palladium nitrate hydrate (0.0392 g) was added into the DI water (10 mL) and stirred, and then the support (NH2-OH-KIE-6, 0.18 g) was added and the mixture was stirred again. Afterward, 0.85 M NaBH4 (2 mL) was added into the solution under stirring for 1 h, and then centrifuged and washed. After drying, we obtained 9 wt% Pd/NH2-OH-KIE-6 catalysts."
8,Formic acid dehydrogenation using catalyst at room temperature,"2.7 Formic acid dehydrogenation using catalyst at room temperature Before the dehydrogenation test, the diluted lignin-free crude formic acid (LCF, 15 mL) solution or diluted distilled formic acid (DF, 15 mL) solution and the additive (sodium formate, 0.68 g) were mixed. The water-filled gas burette system was connected to the outlet of the a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor to determine the volume of produced gas by formic acid dehydrogenation. The formic acid dehydrogenation catalyst (Pd/NH2-OH-KIE-6, 0.055 g) was put into the reactor and purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. After then, the dehydrogenation reaction started when LCF or DF solution with additive was injected into the reactor via a rubber septum [37,38]."
9,Analytical methods,"2.8 Analytical methods Raw red pine of components (carbohydrates and lignin) was analyzed following the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Laboratory Analysis Procedure (LAP) [42,43]. Raw red pine of moisture and ash contents were measured using a TGA-701 thermogravimeter (LECO Co., St. Joseph, MI, USA). The Gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) analysis was performed for comparing the crystallinity of raw biomass and MD-CIB. Each sample was suspended in DI-water without derivatization. The water-soluble products (the flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) were analyzed by GPC (Tosoh EcoSEC HLC-8320 GPC) with columns (Tskgel guard PWxl + 2 × TSKgel GMPWxl + TSKgel G2500PWxl (7.8 × 300 mm)) at 40 °C. A refractive index (RI) detector was used. All of liquid samples (CF, LCF, and DF solutions) were also analyzed following the NREL-LAP [42–46]. approach by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC 1200 infinity series, Agilent Technologies, USA) using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H organic acid column (300*7.8 mm, USA) with a refractive index detector (mobile phase: 5.0 mM sulfuric acid, the flow rate: 0.5 mL/min, and the column temperature: 60 °C) The formic acid yield from biomass was calculated by Eq.

10,Characterization of the catalyst,"2.9 Characterization of the catalyst For the characterization of the 9 wt% Pd catalysts supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired using a Kratos 165XP and a FEI/TECNAI G5 instrument. Elemental analysis (EA, Thermo Finnigan Flash 1112 series Elemental Analyzer) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TGA Q5000, TA Instruments, 10 °C/min heating rate, 100 mL/min air flow rate) were performed to understand the characteristics of the used catalyst."
11,Results and discussion,"To overcome the bottlenecks of the previously reported [12] biomass-formic acid-hydrogen conversion (BFH) process, we proposed the BFH process with improved sustainability and formic acid yield comprising 4 steps of processes such as mechanocatalytic depolymerization of biomass with citric acid as a catalyst (first step), conversion of biomass to formic acid through citric-acid-based hydrolysis-oxidation (second step), elimination of byproducts such as saccharides, acetic acid, levulinic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), furfural, and lignin (third step), and hydrogen production through room-temperature formic acid dehydration using a heterogeneous catalyst (final step) (see the Fig. 1 )."
12,Crude formic acid (CF) solution production from red pine via citric-acid-based hydrolysis-oxidation with mechanocatalytic depolymerization in the presence of DMSO and H2O2,"3.1 Crude formic acid (CF) solution production from red pine via citric-acid-based hydrolysis-oxidation with mechanocatalytic depolymerization in the presence of DMSO and H2O2 To increase the efficiency of the hydrogen production process, much higher formic acid yield is greatly desirable. It is well-known that the traditional acid-catalyzed hydrothermal method was not suitable for achieving high formic acid yield [46]. Fig. S1 shows the overall pathway for production of formic acid from biomass (cellulose and hemi-cellulose) by hydrolysis-oxidation combined treatment. Achieving higher formic acid yield from raw biomass could be difficult because cellulose and hemi-cellulose disintegration to a monomer are very difficult and slow in aqueous reaction media owing to their crystalline structure with intense intermolecular, intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces. In order to achieve high yield formic acid, the cellulose and hemi-cellulose as a component of biomass should be depolymerized into monomers or oligomers as much as possible before formic acid produces via oxidation of monomers. Therefore, we introduced a pretreatment step for mechanocatalytic depolymerization of biomass before the hydrolysis-oxidation step [47–50]. In addition, we substituted toxic mineral acids used in the previous publication [12] with citric acid as sustainable organic acid catalysts. When the hydrolysis-oxidation step of raw red pine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (11 wt%) and citric acid (5 wt%) solution was performed at 170 °C for 3 h (Table 2, entry 2), 15.04% formic acid yield was obtained. The formic acid yield of entry 2 was very low in comparison with using sulfuric acid (Table 2, entry 1, 36.73% formic acid yield) due to higher pH of citric acid. We applied several strategies to obtain high formic acid yield using a weak acid catalyst. First, mechanocatalytic depolymerization process of citric-acid-impregnated biomass was introduced before the hydrolysis-oxidation step (entry 3). To compare the weight average molecular weight of the raw biomass with that of the mechanocatalytically depolymerized biomass (MD-CIB), each sample was analyzed by gel permeation chromatograph (GPC). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the weight average molecular weight curve for the raw biomass and MD-CIB. The raw biomass was not detected a peak, which means that raw biomass is insoluble due to high molecular weight. In contrast, MD-CIB showed a 2,043 wt average molecular weight and monosaccharide peaks. The mechanocatalytic depolymerization process induced both the depolymerization of biomass and the non-stereospecific recombination of the oligosaccharides as the 1,4-β-glycosidic bond is broken. The mechanocatalytic depolymerization process improves the accessibility of the reactants into the biomass structure and enhances the reactivity of biomass [47–50] due to a decrease in crystallinity and degree of polymerization of the biomass, which increased the yield of formic acid (17.50%). In addition, by applying only DMSO as co-solvent during the hydrothermal treatment step (entry 4), the yield of formic acid (18.04%) increased slightly in comparison with the entry 2, indicating that the addition of DMSO as co-solvent improved the yields of formic acid. When the addition amount of oxidizing agent increased, much higher yield of formic acid (entry 5, 25.05%) was obtained in comparison with entry 2–4. Among the independent influential variables (entry 3–5) on formic acid yield of the citric-acid-based biomass hydrolysis-oxidation process such as oxidizing agent, DMSO, mechanocatalytic depolymerization process of citric-acid-impregnated biomass, the addition amount of the oxidizing agent directly affects the yield of formic acid than the DMSO addition and mechanocatalytic depolymerization process with citric acid. Although it has been demonstrated that several factors can enhance formic acid production from biomass, formic acid yields are still low. Thus we combined the influential factors and investigated the effect of the combined process on formic acid yield improvement. We found that the combination of DMSO (5 wt%) and hydrogen peroxide (22 wt%) enhanced the yields of formic acid to 34.12% (entry 6). When DMSO and mechanocatalytic depolymerization process in the presence of 11 wt% hydrogen peroxide solution were combined (entry 7), the yield of formic acid (23.10%) was slightly improved compared to entry 3 (17.50%) and 4 (18.04%). Likewise, the combined process of mechanocatalytic depolymerization and 22 wt% of oxidizing agent without DMSO (entry 8) resulted in a slightly higher yield of formic acid (28.16%) compared to entry 5 (23.01%). Interestingly, the combined process of three independent variables (entry 9) remarkably increased the formic acid yield up to 43.53%. Biomass with a mechanocatalytically depolymerized structure facilitates the conversion to formic acid in the presence of excess H2O2 and DMSO. To optimize the hydrolysis-oxidation process of entry 9, we observed the formic acid yield with changing reaction temperature and residence time as shown in Table 2 (entry 10–14). The reaction temperature and time also considerably affected the formic acid yield and the hydrolysis-oxidation process of entry 9 gave higher formic acid yield (43.53%) than the others (entry 10–14). In addition, entry 9, 15, and 16 in Table 2 demonstrated that the mechanocatalytic depolymerization time is an important parameter for the efficient production of formic acid from biomass, and the highest results were obtained by the mechanocatalytic depolymerization for 10 min. Finally, we investigated the effect of the amount of acid catalyst on the formation of formic acid (Table 2 entry 7, 17, and 18). Compared to entry 9, the yield of formic acid increased up to 50.03% at 10 wt% of citric acid (Table 2 entry 17). However, the formic acid yield was decreased to 46.75%, when biomass was impregnated with 15 wt% of citric acid. This indicates that excess milling time and amount of acid catalyst could lead to excess decomposition of biomass to molecules with lower molecule weight than formic acid. The proposed strategies successfully converted biomass to formic acid even with weak acids, which makes the hydrolysis-oxidation process of biomass more sustainable than traditional one."
13,Dehydrogenation of lignin-free crude formic acid (LCF) solution using a Pd catalyst supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6,"3.2 Dehydrogenation of lignin-free crude formic acid (LCF) solution using a Pd catalyst supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6 We conducted the dehydrogenation of formic acid produced from biomass (Table 2, entry 17 solution) at room temperature using a Pd catalyst supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6 (Pd/NH2-OH-KIE-6), the properties of the catalyst are shown in Figs. S2 and S3 [40,41]. Before the dehydrogenation reaction, we prepared the lignin-free crude formic acid (LCF) solution by filtration of the crude formic acid (CF) solution with a filter paper (Advantec, 5C, 1 ㎛) to remove lignin particles (Fig. S4). Moreover, the LCF solution was diluted to 13.92 g/L of formic acid, because the higher formic acid concentration affected the activity of dehydrogenation catalyst (Fig. S5) [2]. The information of diluted LCF solution was shown in Table 3 . In the case of dehydrogenation of the diluted LCF solution (13.92 g/L, 15 mL, 4.53 mmol) with sodium formate additives, the gas production volume at 200 min and turnover frequency (TOF) at 10 min were measured to be 125 mL and 66.21 mol H2 mol catalyst-1h−1 (Fig. 3 , black line). As illustrated in Fig. 4 , formic acid molecules turn palladium formates in company with −+HNH2 groups via O–H bonding cleavage by basic − NH2 groups. And then, CO2 and a palladium hydride species are fabricated owing to β-hydride removing of the palladium formate species. Finally, hydrogen gas is emitted by the reaction of the hydride species with −+HNH2 groups [51–54]. The catalytic activity for the diluted LCF solution was very low. It was considered that the low catalytic activity originated from byproducts in the LCF solution such as saccharides, 5-HMF, furfural, and unconfirmed organic matters [37]."
14,Dehydrogenation of distilled formic acid (DF) solution using a Pd catalyst supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6,"3.3 Dehydrogenation of distilled formic acid (DF) solution using a Pd catalyst supported on hydroxylated and amine-functionalized mesoporous silica KIE-6 In order to enhance the catalytic activity for formic acid dehydration, transparent distilled formic acid (DF) solution with only organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and levulinic acid was prepared by distillation of the CF solution at 110 °C using fractional distillation equipment for removing the byproducts. As a result, the byproducts such as lignin, saccharides, 5-HMF, and furfural were not detected in transparent DF solution (Table 3 and Fig. S4). The DF solution was diluted to 12.81 and 19.03 g/L of formic acid in the same manner as the diluted LCF solution (Table 3, sample code: Diluted DF solution-1 and Diluted DF solution-2). At low formic acid concentrations (the diluted DF solution-2, 12.81 g/L, 15 mL, 4.18 mmol), the catalyst activity increased significantly in comparison with the diluted DF solution-1 (19.03 g/L, 15 mL, 6.20 mmol) (Fig. 3). The catalytic activity depended on the formic acid concentration of the diluted DF solution. In addition, the catalytic activity of the diluted DF solution with byproduct removed was much higher than the LCF solution with the same concentration of formic acid. The different catalytic activity was ascribed to the byproducts adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst, thus interrupting the dehydrogenation reaction. This opinion can be confirmed by contrasting EA and TGA results of catalysts before and after dehydrogenation reaction of diluted LCF and diluted DF solution. After the dehydrogenation of diluted LCF solution, the contents of C, H, O, and S increased as compared with the initial catalysts (Table 4 ). Moreover, a peak appeared at 200–500 °C, ascribed to volatilization and thermal decomposition of organic matters (Fig. 5 ). These results show that byproducts such as monosaccharides, and furan compounds were adsorbed on the catalyst after dehydrogenation of the LCF solution. On the other hand, after the dehydrogenation of the diluted DF solution, the EA and TGA results of catalysts were similar to the initial catalyst. When the formic acid concentration was diluted to 12.81 g/L, gas production volume at 200 min and TOF at 10 min remarkably increased up to 240 mL and 279.24 mol H2 mol catalyst-1h−1, respectively (Fig. 3, red and blue line). The gas production volume and TOF increased up to 92% and 321.75% compared to the LCF solution. We successfully enhanced the catalytic activity of the DF solution by distillation of the LCF solution. Theoretically, only 204.6 mL of gas (conversion 100%) should be produced from the diluted DF solution-2 (12.81 g/L, 15 mL, 4.18 mmol). However, we found that the amount of gas produced in the experiment exceeded the theoretical amount of gas. This results predicted that additional formic acid and sodium acetate or sodium levulinate was formed by the ion exchange between sodium formate and acetic acid or levulinic acid, and hydrogen was produced from dehydrogenation of additionally formed formic acid over catalysts [37]."
15,Dehydrogenation test of organic acids,"3.4 Dehydrogenation test of organic acids We conducted further dehydrogenation experiments to confirm this hypothesis (Fig. 6 ). The catalytic performances of the dehydrogenation catalysts were investigated using different model solutions of acetic acid (15 g/L, 15 mL, 5 mmol), levulinic acid (29 g/L, 15 mL, 5 mmol), acetic acid (15 g/L, 15 mL, 5 mmol)/sodium formate (0.68 g) and levulinic acid (29 g/L, 15 mL, 5 mmol)/sodium formate (0.68 g). We found that hydrogen gas was not produced from the aqueous solutions of acetic acid, and levulinic acid. By contrast, when acetic acid or levulinic acid was mixed the sodium formate, large quantity of hydrogen gas was produced. To demonstrate the hypothesis, we conducted LC analysis for each solution before and after the dehydrogenation. Table 5 showed the LC analysis results of each solution before and after dehydrogenation reaction. As shown in Table 5 entries 1 and 3, formic acid and acetic acid (or levulinic acid) were detected before dehydrogenation reaction, however formic acid was not detected after the dehydrogenation reaction and concentration of acetic acid (or levulinic acid) after the dehydrogenation reaction was almost the same as that before the dehydrogenation reaction (Table 5 entries 2 and 4). Thus, it was confirmed that hydrogen of acetic acid (or levulinic acid) and sodium ion of sodium formate were exchanged to form additional formic acid. However, in the case of a continuous system, acetic acid or levulinic acid will not contribute to the additional production of hydrogen because of the exhaustion of sodium formate, and continuous addition of sodium formate will be required. Thus, elimination of acetic acid and levulinic acid from DF solution should be needed. Solvent and reactive extraction, membrane filtration, electrodialysis, crystallization, ion exchange, and adsorption can be applied as an alternative [55,56]. Liu et al. [57] reported the separation method of levulinic acid and formic acid using granular activated carbon by the difference of adsorption velocity. Brouwer et al. [58] observed that 1-octanol was suitable extractants for the selective extraction of formic acid. Nam et al. [59] estimated a continuous chromatographic process for effective separation of acetic acid and formic acid using Amberchrom-CG300C resin. Regarding the formic acid recovery topic, it is necessary to develop more efficient formic acid purification methods for biomass-formic acid-hydrogen conversion process. In addition, the by-products of proposed process such as lignin [60], saccharides [61], furfural and 5-HMF [62,63] can be converted into high value-added materials. Lignin can be utilized as a fine chemical, polymer industry, fuel, and carbon material [60,64]. Biomass-derived saccharides can be used as materials to prepare carbon materials and bioethanol [65]. Furfural, which is an important renewable, non-petroleum based, and chemical feedstock, can be converted into solvents, polymers, fuels, and other chemicals. Especially, furfuryl alcohol is the most important furfural-derived product, and its production takes up approximately 65% from the overall furfural produced. Furfuryl alcohol is mainly used as a feedstock to produce foundry resins, fiber-reinforced plastics, pharmaceuticals, phenolic resins, and adhesive agent. Furfuryl alcohol is produced by selective hydrogenation of furfural in gas or liquid phase using Cu-Cr catalysts being the most widely used to date [66,67]. 5-HMF can be utilized as monomers, pharmaceutical intermediates, and fuels. In particular, 5-HMF can be converted to five-carbon liquid alkane, which is the main component of transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, through aldol condensation, hydroxyalkylation, and self-coupling [68,69]."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, we proposed a low-temperature hydrogen production process from lignocellulosic biomass passing through formic acid (the biomass-formic acid-hydrogen conversion process) with improved sustainability and formic acid yield (Fig. 7 ). In the first step, biomass was mechanocatalytically depolymerized with citric acid (MD-CIB). In the second step, the hydrothermal treatment with hydrogen peroxide and DMSO converts MD-CIB to the CF solution with high formic acid yield. When the molecular weight of the biomass decreased by mechanocatalytic depolymerization in the first step, the hydrolysis-oxidation reaction was promoted for formic acid production. In the third step, the solid–liquid separation process produces the LCF solution by removing lignin particles or distillation process produces the DF solution by removing lignin and other organic matters from the CF solution. And then, all solutions are diluted before the dehydrogenation reaction. In the final step, hydrogen gas is generated from the LCF solution or DF solution through the room-temperature dehydrogenation process over Pd/NH2-OH-KIE-6 catalysts. The produced gas from formic acid includes only H2 and CO2 without CO, which can be used as a fuel for the Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) (Fig. S6). The biomass-formic acid-hydrogen conversion process is economical and effective because it can produce hydrogen from biomass through very simple and low-temperature process. In particular, hydrogen can be stored as formic acid in the form of a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), so that hydrogen can be economically dispensed to the customers who needs it. The proposed technology could open up new horizons in the hydrogen production field."
