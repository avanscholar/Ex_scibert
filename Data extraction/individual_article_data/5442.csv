0,Introduction,"The liver is not only the vital organ responsible for metabolizing alcohol, but also the main target organ for alcoholic toxicity [1,2]. Excess alcohol consumption becomes the major etiologic factor in the development of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL), which is characterized by accumulation of large lipid droplets and mitochondrial enlargement in hepatocytes [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent AFL as early as possible, and it's likely to block or delay the development of steatosis to more severe forms, such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [4,5]. Thus, it is important to study the pathogenesis of AFL, and discover efficacious pharmacological agents to treat steatosis. Most evidences suggest that oxidative stress contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury [6]. Excess alcohol is oxidized to acetaldehyde through three metabolic pathways, and then to acetic acid, which leads to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [7]. Accumulation of ROS reduces cellular antioxidant abilities, and enhances oxidative stress in liver [7]. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of alcohol metabolism and excess ROS induce death of hepatocytes, as evidenced by apoptosis in AFL [7,8]. Ingested alcohol contributes to oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis, using the intragastric infusion model of alcohol administration and human normal liver cell line LO2 cultured with suitable ethanol [8–10]. We can mimic the change to investigate the potential mechanisms of AFL and evaluate the effects of novel therapeutic agents in cellular and rat models. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) is an active constituent isolated from the vegetable of garlic, a Chinese herbal medicine, which has been clinically used in the treatment of bacterial infections, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases for many years [11,12]. Investigation has demonstrated that DATS reduced alcohol-induced liver injury and fat deposition, which was associated with attenuation of hepatic oxidative stress [13]. However, the exact mechanisms of how DATS affects AFL are not fully understood. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as the third gasotransmitter, which is synthesized from l-cysteine by enzymes such as cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST), along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), is thought to play an important role in diseases [14]. Moreover, drugs that are capable of producing safe levels H2S or target H2S signaling pathway in vivo may have potential biological and clinical significances for chronic liver diseases [15]. Considering the fact that DATS, which has the highest content accounting for 41.5% among the organosulfur compounds in garlic and been found to be the most effective compound, serves as an exogenous H2S donor, and the liver has a high ability to produce and clear H2S [16–18], we speculated that DATS attenuated oxidative stress induced-apoptosis through generation of H2S in AFL. The current study was designed to validate the hypothesis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and antibodies,"2.1 Reagents and antibodies The following compounds were used in this study: DATS (purity >97%; Shenzhen Minn Bolin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China, iodoacetamide (IAM; Nanjing Dingguo Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), they were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for in vitro experiments and kept at −20°C if necessary. The vehicle (DMSO) was used as a control throughout the experiments and the final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.02% (w/v), which had no cytotoxicity in this study (data not shown). DATS (purity >80%) was purchased from Cheng Du Micxy Chemical Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China) and was dissolved in olive oil for in vivo experiments. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: catalase(CAT), superoxide dismutase(SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); CSE and CBS (Epitomics, San Francisco, CA, USA); Bcl-2, Bax, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, pro-caspase-8, cleaved-caspase-8, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, full-length PARP-1, cleaved-PARP-1, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)."
3,Animals and experimental procedures,"2.2 Animals and experimental procedures Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220g body weight) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). All these rats grew in the specific pathogen free clean room with the condition of 21 to 25°C as well as a 12-h dark/light cycle, and had free access to laboratory chow and tap water. The experimental was approved by the institutional and local committee on the care and use of animals of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China). All animals were cared for in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (USA) guidelines. After adaptive feed for a week, fifty rats were randomly divided into five groups with 10 rats in each group. Group1 was the vehicle control in which rats were not given ethanol or DATS but received equal volume solvent. Group 2 was ALD model group in which rats were gavaged with ethanol (56%, v/v, 10mL/kg) without DATS. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were treatment groups in which rats were orally given ethanol and DATS at 25, 50, and 100mg/kg, respectively. Rats in groups 2–5 were orally given ethanol every day for 8weeks. DATS was dissolved in olive oil and given once daily by gavage during weeks 5–8. At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed after being anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) pentobarbital (50mg/kg). Livers were isolated and weighted quickly and stored at −80°C until analysis."
4,Cell culture,"2.3 Cell culture Human LO2 hepatocyte cells were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sijiqing Biological Engineering Materials Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China), 100U/mL penicillin, and 100μg/mL streptomycin. The cells were grown in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C. The cells were exposed to 100mM ethanol in the absence/presence of DATS or IAM for 24h, and were harvested in accordance with the applied technique. LO2 hepatocytes were then treated with DATS at 1, 2.5, and 5μM and/or IAM at 50μM, respectively. Cell morphology was assessed under an inverted microscope (Leica, Germany)."
5,Analyses of apoptosis,"2.4 Analyses of apoptosis LO2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 12h. LO2 hepatocytes were then treated with various reagents at the indicated concentrations for 24h. Morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were detected by Hoechst staining kits and TUNEL staining kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) according to the protocol. The cells were observed and photographed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). In certain experiments, cells were treated as indicated, collected, and stained with Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay kits (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the extent of apoptosis was calculated with FlowJo software (FACSCalibur; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Moreover, liver tissue samples embedded in paraffin were prepared, and used for TUNEL assay. Results were from triplicate experiments."
6,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA),"2.5 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) The levels of H2S in liver tissues and LO2 were determined with an ELISA kit (Beijing equations biological Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the protocol. Results were from triplicate experiments."
7,Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS),"2.6 Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) The content of intracellular ROS was detected by DCFH-DA staining (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The intensity of cellular fluorescence intensity was determined by an MRC 1024 laser confocal microscope (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Results were from triplicate experiments."
8,"Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and SOD","2.7 Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and SOD Levels of intracellular MDA, GSH and SOD were determined using kits purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). LO2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 12h. LO2 were then treated with various reagents at the indicated concentrations for 24h, and were lysated with RIPA buffer. The lysates were collected and deproteinated using the reagents in the kits. The levels of MDA, GSH and SOD were determined according to the instructions. Experiments were performed in triplicate."
9,Western blot analyses,"2.8 Western blot analyses LO2 cells were treated with various reagents at indicated concentrations for 24h. Liver samples and LO2 cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) containing protease inhibitors and/or phosphatase inhibitors. The protein levels were detected using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Proteins (50μg/well) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).The membrane were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The blots were incubated overnight with the corresponding primary antibodies in TBST at 4°C and subsequently by horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equivalent loading was confirmed using an antibody against β-actin. The levels of target protein bands were densitometrically determined using Quantity One 4.4.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA). The variation in the density of bands was expressed as fold changes compared to the control in the blot after being normalized to β-actin. Representative blots were from three independent experiments."
10,Statistical analyses,"2.9 Statistical analyses Data were presented as mean±SD, and the results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The significance of difference was determined by one-way ANOVA with the post hoc Dunnett's test. p-Values<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant."
11,Results,
12,DATS alleviated ethanol-induced oxidative stress,"3.1 DATS alleviated ethanol-induced oxidative stress DATS has many pharmaceutical applications due to its effective antioxidant property. Firstly, the typical animal and cell culture models were established to evaluate the modulation of DATS on antioxidant system. According to our knowledge, the main features of ethanol-induced oxidative stress are the high level of ROS and low activity of antioxidant enzymes [19]. Herein, ethanol treatment remarkably decreased the activities of SOD, CAT and GR, which were reversed by DATS in rats (Fig. 1A). We thus investigated the effects of DATS at non-toxic doses in vitro subsequently. In our experiment, ethanol at 100mM concentration was used to mimic the cell models of hepatic steatosis [20]. Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that ethanol-induced LO2 had high intracellular levels of ROS, but DATS treatment resulted in a significant reduction in ROS generation dose-dependently (Fig. 1B). In addition, DATS had a similar effect on the activities of SOD, CAT and GR in ethanol-induced LO2 (Fig. 1C). In summary, the liver may be protected by DATS treatment after ethanol exposure due to suppressed oxidative stress."
13,DATS suppressed ethanol-induced apoptosis,"3.2 DATS suppressed ethanol-induced apoptosis Intermediate products for ethanol-induced liver damage, such as toxic oxygen species, acetaldehyde adducts mediated destruction, can induce hepatocyte apoptosis [21]. Therefore, apoptosis could be a final common mechanism mediating hepatocyte injury by ethanol. Apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation [22]. Compared to the control group, the number of apoptotic cells stained by TUNEL in model group was elevated markedly, demonstrating an increase in apoptotic degeneration of cells as a result from ethanol metabolism (Fig. 2A). Receiving DATS treatment, there was a significant decrease in TUNEL-positive cells in the ethanol-feeding rats (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the Bcl-2 family proteins act as sensors to integrate death and survival signals [23]. Western blot demonstrated that the protein expression of Bcl-2 was reduced, and that pro-apoptotic molecule Bax was increased by ethanol (Fig. 2B). Decreased ratio of bcl-2/Bax expression is a pivotal determinant, and its reduction finally triggers activation of caspase cascades [24]. As shown in Fig. 2C, ethanol enhanced the caspase cascade in model group evidenced by the reduced abundance of pro-caspase-9, -8 and -3, and the full-length poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1, and by the increased abundance of their cleaved forms. However, the expression of aforementioned proteins was dose-dependently reversed by the administration of DATS in rats. We next detected the effects of DATS on apoptosis of ethanol-induced LO2. Ethanol-treated LO2 cells were subjected to dramatic morphological changes, manifested as shrinkage, semi-suspension and spherical shape (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, TUNEL staining revealed that LO2 treated with ethanol exhibited the increased TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2E). However, DATS apparently altered the events. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that DATS inhibits apoptosis, and the protection should be, at least partially, associated with activation of caspase cascades."
14,DATS enhanced H2S generation in ethanol-induced fatty liver models,"3.3 DATS enhanced H2S generation in ethanol-induced fatty liver models As reported, H2S played an important role in the regulation of hepatic physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and its deficiency could result in liver cirrhosis [14]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the beneficial effects of garlic extracts on AFL could in part be mediated by the molecule. Consistent, with this view, we observed that ethanol exposure for 8weeks led to reduced hepatic H2S content in rats (Fig. 3A). Endogenous H2S production is primarily the result of two enzymes: CBS and CSE, and both of them can be expressed in the liver tissue [25]. Under the conditions of chronic ethanol feeding, we observed the expression of CBS and CSE proteins in model group changed compared with the control group, but the difference of CSE expression was more obvious than CBS expression (Fig. 3B). Treatment with DATS dramatically rescued the ethanol-induced reduction in H2S levels in tissue homogenates (Fig. 3A). DATS also increased CBS and CSE protein in ethanol-induced rats (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the results, we next detected H2S levels, CBS and CSE protein in ethanol-induced LO2 cells. As expected, the suppressed levels of intracellular H2S and expression of CSE and CBS protein induced by ethanol were significantly up-regulated by DATS in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 1C and D). Taken together, these results indicated that H2S may play an important role in the liver-protective effect of DATS."
15,DATS alleviated ethanol-induced oxidative stress associated with H2S,"3.4 DATS alleviated ethanol-induced oxidative stress associated with H2S Studies have demonstrated that DATS could be converted into H2S via glucose-supported and thiol-dependent cellular as well as GSH-dependent acellular reactions [26]. To further clarify the mechanism, we chose IAM at 50μM as a blocker of DATS to inhibit GSH-dependent acellular reaction to produce H2S [26]. To investigate whether elevated cellular H2S is responsible for the protection of DATS against ethanol, cells were treated with DATS and or IAM. Flow cytometry assessments demonstrated that ethanol-induced LO2 had high intracellular levels of ROS, and as expected, DATS treatment resulted in a significant reduction in ROS generation (Fig. 4A). However, IAM dramatically rescued the DATS-caused reduction in ROS levels in ethanol-induced LO2 (Fig. 4A). Ethanol-induced ROS production can result in lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidant defenses [27]. Subsequent analysis confirmed that the DATS decreased the expression of MDA, and increased the expression of GSH and SOD in ethanol-induced LO2 (Fig. 4B and C). However, as expected, IAM significantly compensated the DATS inhibition of MDA and elevation of GSH and SOD in ethanol-induced LO2 (Fig. 4B and C). These findings collectively suggested that DATS attenuated oxidative stress in ethanol-induced LO2, which was relevant to H2S."
16,DATS reduced ethanol-induced apoptosis associated with H2S,"3.5 DATS reduced ethanol-induced apoptosis associated with H2S Next, the role of H2S in the DATS modulation of the apoptosis was established. Hoechst staining indicated that DNA condensation and fragmentation with brilliant blue staining were markedly enhanced after stimulation with ethanol, which was reversed by the administration of DATS (Fig. 5A). However, the effect of DATS was abolished by IAM (Fig. 5A). Additional evidence was provided by FITC labeled Annexin V/PI staining showing that the apoptotic rates were significantly inhibited by DATS in ethanol-induced LO2, while IAM attenuated the anti-apoptotic effects of DATS (Fig. 5B). We also analyzed the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and key caspase proteins in the regulation of apoptosis. As expected, DATS effects on these molecules were abrogated by IAM (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, these findings strongly indicated that enhanced intracellular H2S level likely contributed to the protective effect of DATS against apoptosis induced by ethanol."
17,Discussion,"A single intragastric dose of ethanol given to rats is used extensively in the field of AFL research and is especially useful for studying the mechanisms governing ethanol-induced liver damage and steatosis [28]. LO2 cells are also widely used in studies on the pathophysiology of hepatocytes such as hepatotoxicity [28]. Previous study exhibited that garlic extracts restored liver histology to normal and regulated lipid metabolism, resulting in regression of fatty liver in ethanol-fed rats and LO2 [10,29]. In the present study, we found that treatment with different concentrations of DATS suppressed ethanol-induced oxidative stress both in vivo and vitro. We also observed that DATS administration suppressed the apoptosis after ethanol exposure. To explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for protective effects of DATS, we focused on the potential biotransformation of DATS. In 2007, Benavides' group first delineated that DATS could be converted into H2S, which depended on thiol-dependent cellular as well as GSH-dependent acellular reactions, suggesting that the major beneficial effects of garlic compounds was synchronous with H2S production [26]. Thereafter, increasing evidence revealed that the benefits of garlic consumption were mediated by the biological production of H2S [30,31]. DATS protected against high glucose-induced cardiac apoptosis by stimulating the production of H2S [32–35]. We thus strongly speculated that H2S contributed to DATS inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptotic. To better understand the role that H2S plays in the protective effect on AFL of DATS, we measured the levels of H2S in DATS-treated liver tissue and cells. Ethanol-induced rats generally exhibited low levels of H2S in tissue, which was in agreement with intracellular H2S. As expected, DATS treatment resulted in increasing levels of H2S, which implied that DATS induced H2S production. Additionally, livers from model group had very low levels of CSE and CBS expression and that treatment with DATS restored them to normal levels also implied that H2S may play an important role in the protective effect on AFL of DATS. Actually, H2S has been identified as an important biological mediator [16]. This gasotransmitter is generated in mammalian cells and quickly permeates cell membranes without using specific transporters [16]. The deficiency of H2S could result in various pathological alterations, such as arterial and pulmonary hypertension and liver cirrhosis [14]. Indeed, the effect of H2S in hepatology has been studied extensively during recent years [14,36]. Malfunction of hepatic H2S metabolism may be involved in many chronic liver diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis [36,37]. However, exogenous H2S attenuated hepatotoxicity, liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension by its multiple functions including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and cytoprotection [37,38], indicating that targeting H2S might present a promising approach against liver diseases. We postulated that DATS was able to release H2S that mediated the potent hepatoprotective and anti-fatty liver effects. Therefore, our current data provided molecular evidence for the role of DATS observed in our previous experiments. A role for H2S in regulation of oxidative stress was an important issue that needed to be addressed. Scientific investigation over the years has demonstrated that H2S could increase intracellular GSH concentrations and suppress oxidative stress in mitochondria under pathological conditions [39]. H2S also protected the rat against streptozotocin-induced diabetic through upregulation of intracellular antioxidant pathways [40]. In this article, the DATS attenuation of oxidative stress was associated with releasing of H2S in ethanol-induced models. The antioxidant activity of H2S may explain a number of the reported biological effects of this gasotransmitter. However, whether H2S exerts its antioxidant effects by virtue of its undoubted reducing activity or by its activation of endogenous defense systems was worth further investigation. In summary, these findings clearly demonstrated that DATS inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis in ethanol-induced model. On the other hand, these effects were associated with biotransformation of DATS to be H2S within cells. Pharmacological agents like DATS, which is capable of producing H2S, maintains antioxidant homeostasis and thereby protects hepatocyte against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, may provide useful therapeutic potentials for the prevention or treatment for the ethanol-induced fatty liver."
