0,Introduction,"Regarding the shortage of fossil fuels, it is imperative that our society should search for new renewable sources of energy and chemicals. The electrochemical conversion of hydrogen to power via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology may alleviate global dependence on fossil fuels, as well as decrease emissions of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants [1]. Hydrogen production from various hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels has been a focus of investigation recently, especially the development of biomass-derived fuels as a hydrogen source attracted much attention [2–4]. In the short term, hydrogen generation from existing non-renewable resources such as natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel is an available alternative, but the reforming of it does not contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. The use of renewable fuels for the production of hydrogen also provides significant environmental benefits, because the produced CO2 is consumed for biomass growth thus offering a carbon dioxide neutral energy supply. It is known that a large amount of glycerol is produced as a byproduct during biodiesel production by transesterification of vegetable oils, which is available at low cost in large supply from renewable raw materials. Therefore, it is essential to find economical applications for glycerol byproduct to expand biodiesel production. Several alternatives are being explored to utilize glycerol by-product from biodiesel plants. The recent reviews of Johnson and Taconi [5] and Behr et al. [6] provide excellent overviews of the chemistry of glycerol, and its possible utilization as renewable not only for the production of various chemicals but also for the production of syngas and hydrogen. In comparison with ethanol, glycerol has more number of moles of H in its chemical structure and would be a logical substrate to produce H2. The production of hydrogen from biomass derived oxygenated hydrocarbons including glycerol in an aqueous phase reforming process [7,8] and steam reforming [9–25] has been investigated recently. The steam reforming of glycerol is highly endothermic and the low pressure favors the selectivity of hydrogen. The main reactions can be represented in Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O ↔ 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 (2) C 3 H 8 ↔ 3 CO + 4 H 2 (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 . Eq. (1) represents the overall steam reforming reaction, which is due to the contribution of two reactions i.e. glycerol decomposition (Eq. (2)) and water gas shift (WGS, Eq. (3)). The reaction pathway is quite complex and many other reactions can take place, in particular CO and CO2 hydrogenation, which leads to the formation of methane, and side reactions e.g. dehydration, dehydrogenation, cyclization and polymerization, that can lead to coke deposition [24]. Ni is the most investigated active metal in the glycerol reforming, because it has good activity for CC, OH and CH bond cleavage and it also catalyzes the water–gas-shift reaction [13–30], it is cheaper and more available than noble metals. However, how to suppress coke deposition to enhance the catalytic stability still remains a major challenge. In Ni-based catalysts, CeO2 has been used as either an effective promoter or support because of its characteristic oxygen storage capacity, which allows it to store and release oxygen, leading to the presence of highly active oxygen. This makes the catalyst more active in many carbon formation-related reactions of hydrocarbons, such as steam reforming, dry reforming, and oxidation. Previous studies have shown that the addition of ZrO2 into CeO2 improves the redox properties and oxygen storage capacity, which promotes water–gas shift and steam reforming in the SR (steam reforming) and OSR (oxidative steam reforming) of ethanol [31–35]. In methane reforming reaction, it has been reported that the Ce–ZrO2 solid solution has a higher concentration of mobile oxygen, which can facilitate coke removal and improve catalyst stability [36,37]. Hence, in the present work, Ni catalysts supported on the CeZrO supports were prepared. The aim is to find catalysts with high H2 selectivity and good stability for the glycerol steam reforming process. Furthermore, the effects of reaction temperature, water to glycerol molar ratio, and the feed flow rate were also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zr(NO3)4·5H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and glycerol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (NH4)2CO3 and NH3·H2O were purchased from Xi'an Chemical Reagent Plant. All other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used directly without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The CeZrO supports were prepared by the co-precipitation method using the corresponding nitrates: Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O, which were dissolved in distilled water. The ratio between the metal salts was altered depending on the desired solid solution concentration of CeZrO. The precipitation was carried out by adding ammonium carbonate and ammonium hydroxide mixed solution (1:1 volume ratio) to the nitrate solution at 30°C under rigorous stirring until the pH of the mixture reaches 10. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110°C overnight. Then, the oxide materials were carefully ground in a mortar and subsequently calcined at 700°C in air for 4h. The Ni/CeZrO catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method by using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as a precursor. The Ni loading on the catalysts is 10wt.%. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 110°C overnight and calcined at 550°C for 4h in air."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The relative contents of Ni, Ce and Zr in the catalysts were determined by a Shimadzu XRF-1800 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The BET surface areas of the samples were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M system, using N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to measurement, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 300°C for 4h in order to remove any volatile adsorbents on the surface. A sample loading of ~0.2g was used in each trial. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a Rigaku D/MAX-III diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40kV and 40mA. The diffraction patterns were taken from 10° to 80° at a scan rate of 8°/min. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment was carried out in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument. In each trial, about 50mg of sample was loaded into a quartz reactor. Before the TPR measurement, the sample was purged for 30min at 300°C in flowing Ar of 30ml·min−1 and then cooled to 100°C. The TPR measurement was performed using 10% hydrogen in argon, 30ml·min−1, with a heating rate of 10°C·min−1, from 100 to 900°C. The hydrogen consumption was monitored online by a thermal conductivity detector. H2 pulse chemisorption was performed in the AutoChem 2920 instrument to determine the active metal area and Ni dispersion. About 200mg of catalyst was placed in a quartz reactor. Before pulse chemisorption, the sample was reduced in 10% H2/Ar at 650°C for 2h. Then, the sample was purged at 670°C for 1h and cooled to 50°C in flowing Ar. Hydrogen pulse chemisorption was started at 50°C using 5% H2/Ar and repeated at 7min intervals until the hydrogen peaks on the detector became identical. The calculation methods of metal dispersion and surface area are the same as those in reference [38] on assuming the adsorption stoichiometry of one hydrogen atom per nickel surface atom (H/Nis =1). Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of the used Ni/CeZrO was performed in the same apparatus for TPR experiments. Typically, 50mg sample was heated from room temperature to 1000°C in flowing 3% O2/Ar at a heating rate of 10°C·min−1. The products were monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS)."
5,Catalyst performance testing,"2.4 Catalyst performance testing The catalytic activities of Ni/CeZrO were tested in a tubular steel microreactor (i.d. 8mm, 300mm length) operated isothermally at atmospheric pressure. 100mg catalyst was loaded in the reactor. The aqueous solution of glycerol (H2O/glycerol molar ratio of 24) was injected to the reactor by a HPLC pump with a feed flow rate (FFR) of 0.06ml·min−1. The nitrogen was used as carrier gas (33ml·min−1). The reaction temperature was measured and controlled by a thermocouple inserted directly into the catalyst bed. The catalytic reactions were carried out at different temperatures, the molar ratios of water to glycerol, and liquid feed rate. Prior to reaction tests, all the catalysts were reduced in 5% H2 in N2 at 650°C for 2h. At the reactor outlet a glass condenser with vapor–liquid separating funnel was installed to condense and separate unconverted glycerol–water from product gases. The composition of gas products that contained mainly H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2 at the outlet of the vapor–liquid separator was analyzed on-line with a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6820, TCD detector) equipped with 5A molecular sieves and Porapak Q columns. Unconverted glycerol in liquid product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector using a HP-FFAP column (300cm×0.32mm×0.25μm)."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The conversion of glycerol was calculated based on the following equation [16,24,39,40]: Glycerol conversion , % = Glycerol in − Glycerol out Glycerol in × 100 . The selectivities of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 were calculated based on the following equation: H 2 selectivity , % = H 2 moles produced C atoms in gas products × 1 RR × 100 where RR is the reforming ratio (7/3), defined as the ratio of moles of H2 to CO2 formed. Selectivity of i , % = C atoms in species i C atoms in gas products × 100 where species i =CO, CO2, and CH4."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 shows the compositions, BET surface areas, and H2 pulse chemisorption results for Ni/CeZrO. It can be found that the BET surface areas of the samples increase with increasing the ceria content in the supports. When the ceria content in the catalyst is 77.3%, metal Ni dispersion and the active metal surface area show a maximum value. As shown in Fig. 1 , the XRD pattern of pure CeO2 shows a number of diffraction peaks at 28.6°, 33.2°, 47.6, and 56.4° corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) crystal planes, which can be assigned to a typical cubic fluorite structure. For Ni/CeZrO, no diffraction peaks from ZrO2 were observed. With increasing ZrO2 content, the diffraction peaks from the supports broaden and shift to higher theta values, suggesting that the incorporation of ZrO2 into CeO2 lattice form a solid solution owing to the shrinkage of lattice structure with the replacement of cerium cation by zirconium cation [41–43]. Besides the diffraction peaks from the supports in Ni/CeZrO some weak diffraction from NiO was also observed in these catalysts, suggesting high dispersion of NiO. As shown in Fig. 2 , the TPR curve of Ni/CeZrO-1 reveals two hydrogen consumption peaks; the sharp peak at ca. 330°C was attributed to the reduction of free NiO, whereas, the small peak at ca. 500°C was assigned to the reduction of the surface shell of the CeZrO-1 solid solution [43]. For Ni/CeZrO-2 the peak assigned to the reduction of the surface shell of CeZrO-2 solid solution shifts downward to ca. 430°C. H2 pulse chemisorption confirms that Ni/CeZrO-2 has higher Ni dispersion degree than Ni/CeZrO-1, which could facilitate the reduction of the support because more hydrogen may spillover on the surface of the support during reduction [44,45]. Ni/CeZrO-3 exhibits four reduction peaks at ca. 270, 320, 370, and 740°C, respectively. The peak at ca. 270°C could be attributed to the reduction of adsorbed oxygen [46]. Shan et al. proposed that the Ni2+ could incorporate into the lattice of CeO2 to replace some Ce(IV) cations and to form a solid solution, which causes a charge imbalance and lattice distortion which happen within the CeO2 structure, leading to the generation of oxygen vacancies which adsorb oxygen easily [46]. Hence, reactive oxygen species were formed, which were reduced easily by H2 at low temperature. The peak at ca. 320°C was assigned to the reduction of free NiO; whereas, the peak at 370°C could be assigned to the reduction of NiO which has a strong interaction with CeZrO-3, probably, NiO incorporated in the CeZrO-3 solid solution, together with the reduction of the surface shell of CeZrO-3. This indicates that a strong interaction between Ni and CeZrO-3 or Ni incorporation into CeZrO-3 makes ceria more reducible, which probably helps to produce mobile oxygen during the reforming reaction [36,37]. The peak at ca. 740°C could be ascribed to the reduction of the bulk CeZrO-3 solid solution. Ni/CeZrO-4 also exhibits four reduction peaks at ca. 280, 320, 390, and 740°C, respectively. For this sample, the peaks attributed to the reduction of adsorbed oxygen, NiO incorporated in CeZrO-4 together with the surface shell of CeZrO-4 shift to high temperature, as compared with Ni/CeZrO-3. The results suggest that the generation of mobile oxygen in Ni/CeZrO-3 is easier than that in Ni/CeZrO-4. Previously, Ozawa et al. [47] have found that the oxygen vacancy increases when the content of ZrO2 in Ce1− x Zr x O2/Al2O3 increases in the range of x =0–0.5, which suggests that the ZrO2 addition is able to increase the oxygen mobility in the ceria lattice and increase the process of vacancy formation, making the material more reducible."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 The steam reforming of glycerol over various Ni/CeZrO catalysts The steam reforming of glycerol was carried out over Ni/CeZrO at 600°C, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 2 . The experimental results indicate that the composition of supports plays an important role in the reforming reactions. As shown in Table 2, both the conversion of glycerol and selectivity of H2 increase with increasing the cerium content in Ni/CeZrO up to 77.3%, and above this level the conversion of glycerol and selectivity of H2 decrease slightly. The activity change over these catalysts with various cerium contents is in good agreement with that of the surface area and dispersion of nickel. Indeed the catalytic activity of glycerol steam reforming is highly affected by the amount of Ni sites. Ni/CeZrO-3 with higher nickel dispersion could provide more active Ni sites, and hence delivers higher efficiency for H2 production [27]. The selectivity of CO decreases with increasing the cerium content in Ni/CeZrO, whereas, the selectivity of CO2 increases. The results suggest that the addition of cerium promotes the water–gas shift reaction because cerium oxide can enhance the dissociation of H2O and accelerate the reaction of steam with adsorbed species on the nickel [22,48]. As shown in Fig. 3, the catalytic activities in terms of the conversion of glycerol for Ni/CeZrO decrease gradually during the reaction process, whereas, the conversion of glycerol on Ni/CeZrO-3 remains stable. Among the Ni/CeZrO catalysts, Ni/CeZrO-3 reveals the best stability followed by Ni/CeZrO-4, Ni/CeZrO-2, and Ni/CeZrO-1. It has been known that carbon deposition on the surface of active metal is widely deemed as one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation in glycerol steam reforming [26–30]. Coke deposition in glycerol steam reforming could be caused by the Boudouard reaction, as well as the polymerization of olefin species derived from dehydration, dehydrogenation and cyclisation of glycerol [27,29,30]. TPO experiments of the used catalysts after reaction for 12h were carried out to study the nature of the carbonaceous species deposited on the surface of the catalysts. The concentration of CO2 was detected by MS and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . TPO curve of the used Ni/CeZrO-1 shows a huge CO2 desorption peak centered at 700°C followed by a hump at about 900°C. With increasing the cerium content in Ni/CeZrO the peak area of CO2 desorption decreases, and the peak temperature of CO2 desorption shifts down to lower temperatures, indicating that Ni/CeZrO with higher cerium content contains less amount of carbon species, and these carbon species are easily removed. Among the catalysts, Ni/CeZrO-3 has the least amount of carbon deposition followed by Ni/CeZrO-4, Ni/CeZrO-2, and Ni/CeZrO-1, confirming that Ni/CeZrO-3 can effectively suppress the deposition of carbon on the surface of the catalyst, which is probably due to the fact that this catalyst can generate the most mobile oxygen species during reaction. Hence, decoking activity will likely be enhanced through the participation of the lattice oxygen, which subsequently is supplemented with the oxygen from water molecules via enhancing the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, leading to the highest stability in glycerol steam reforming reaction [37,48]. On the other hand, the nickel particle size is closely related to coking, since large nickel particle size is highly favored by coking and dehydration reaction pathway [27]. Ni/CeZrO-3 with the highest nickel dispersion could effectively prevent or minimize the formation of coke on the surface of nickel. Hence, the catalyst has the least amount of carbon deposition and the best stability during the reaction. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature on the catalyst performance The foregoing results indicate that Ni/CeZrO-3 exhibits the best catalytic activity and stability at 600°C. In this section, the steam reforming of glycerol was carried out at 500 and 700°C, respectively, to explore the effect of reaction temperature on the glycerol conversion, H2 selectivity, and stability of Ni/CeZrO-3. As shown in Fig. 5 , at 500°C the conversion of glycerol after 2h-on-stream is 93.8%, the selectivity of H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 is 77.8, 71.2, 25.4, and 3.4%, respectively. At 600°C the conversion of glycerol after 2h-on-stream increases to 97.8%, the selectivities of H2 and CO2 decrease to 69.9 and 62.8%, whereas CO selectivity increases to 33.8%, and CH4 selectivity remains 3.3% (see Fig. 3c). At 700°C the conversion of glycerol is almost completed. The results indicate that high temperature favors the conversion of glycerol, meanwhile promotes the reverse water–gas shift reaction. During the test of 12h the catalyst exhibits a good stability in all investigated temperatures. In addition, the selectivity of the gaseous products remains relatively stable over Ni/CeZrO-3 during the whole test at 500 and 600°C. However, at 700°C the selectivity of H2 and CO2 decreases continuously, whereas CO selectivity increases. The H2/CO ratio decreases from 3 after 2h-on-stream to 0.56 after 12h-on-stream. This CO enrichment in the gas effluent may be reasonably explained by the reverse water–gas shift reaction, which takes places simultaneously in the reactor. This reverse water–gas shift reaction is exothermic, and the equilibrium shifts to the left at high temperature, promoting the formation of CO [49]. 3.2.3 Effect of H2O/glycerol molar ratio Fig. 6 depicts the glycerol conversion, gaseous product selectivity as functions of time-on-stream on Ni/CeZrO-3 with different molar ratios of H2O to glycerol (W/G) i.e. 6, 12, 18 at 600°C while keeping other conditions identical. It can be observed that with increasing W/G ratio the conversion of glycerol increases, which is due to the decrease of the feeding amount of glycerol, while the feed flow rate of liquids remains constant. Moreover, the selectivity of H2 and CO2 increases, whereas, the selectivity of CO decreases, indicating that higher W/G ratios favor the water–gas-shift reaction. When the molar ratio of H2O to glycerol is 6, the catalyst still exhibits a comparative stability with that at a higher W/G ratio of 18, suggesting that Ni/CeZrO-3 has a good stability to resist carbon deposition. The present results may be beneficial to developing highly stable steam reforming catalysts of glycerol. 3.2.4 Effect of the feed flow rate As shown in Fig. 7 , with increasing the feed flow rate from 0.09 to 0.12ml·min−1, the glycerol conversion after 2h-on-stream decreases from 88.9% to 84.2%. This is due to the fact that with increasing the feed flow rate, the contact time of reactants with the catalyst is shortened. The corresponding selectivity of H2 decreases from 66.2% to 65.8% with increasing the feed flow rate from 0.06 to 0.09ml·min−1, and remains relatively stable during the test of 12h. Under the feed flow rate of 0.09ml·min−1 the selectivity of CO2 decreases from 77.3% after 2h-on-stream to 67.2% after 12h-on-stream; whereas, the corresponding selectivity of CO increases from 20.8% to 34.9%, and the selectivity of CH4 increases from 1.9% to 4.0%. Under the feed flow rate of 0.12ml·min−1 the selectivity of CO2 decreases from 73.4% after 2h-on-stream to 53.7% after 12h-on-stream; whereas, the corresponding selectivity of CO increases from 24.3% to 42.3%, and the selectivity of CH4 increases from 2.4% to 3.9%. The results suggest that during reaction the WGS reaction was suppressed with prolonging reaction time. Furthermore, the catalyst activity decreases continuously during the test of 12h at both feed flow rates. We suppose that the deactivation could be due to that more carbon was formed and deposited on the surface of the catalyst at higher feed flow rate."
10,Conclusions,"Four Ni/CeZrO catalysts with different ceria contents were prepared. The BET surface areas of the catalysts increase with increasing the ceria content in the supports. While, metal Ni dispersion and the active metal surface area show a maximum when ceria content in the catalyst is 77.3%. Both the conversion of glycerol and selectivity of H2 increase with increasing the cerium content in Ni/CeZrO up to 77.3%, and afterwards the conversion of glycerol and selectivity of H2 decrease slightly. Among the Ni/CeZrO catalysts, Ni/CeZrO-3 reveals the best stability. This could be due to meanwhile that Ni/CeZrO-3 has the highest metal dispersion and the largest amount of mobile oxygen species, which could prevent carbon formation and promote the gasification of carbon on the surface of the catalyst. For Ni/CeZrO-3 higher temperature favors the conversion of glycerol, meanwhile promotes the reverse water–gas shift reaction, and results in lower H2 selectivity. Increasing molar ratio of H2O to glycerol enhances glycerol conversion. Higher feed flow rate of liquid reactant accelerates the deactivation of the catalyst due to more carbon deposition."
