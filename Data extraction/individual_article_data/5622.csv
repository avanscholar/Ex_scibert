0,Introduction,"The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a host system that is becoming increasingly employed both in academic and industrial biotechnology for the production of a wide variety of heterologous proteins. This system has many of the advantages of eukaryotic expression such as proteolytic processing, folding, disulphide bond formation, and glycosylation. P. pastoris combines the unique ability to grow on minimal media at very high cell densities with the availability of the tightly controlled (methanol-inducible) alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1) [1]. Furthermore, the system allows efficient protein secretion which, combined with the very low secretion levels of endogenous proteins, is a major advantage in their purification. Since protein production from P. pastoris occurs in simple minimal media with defined nitrogen and carbon sources, this system is also attractive for high-throughput production of 2H/13C/15N-labeled protein samples for NMR analyses of the structure and interactions of proteins [2,3]. The PAOX1 is tightly repressed during growth of the yeast on most common carbon sources such as glucose, glycerol or ethanol, but is highly induced during growth on methanol. Feeding methanol at growth-limiting rates in bioreactor cultures allows higher (3–5-fold) transcription initiation rates from PAOX1 [1]. Typically, cultivation modes using P. pastoris PAOX1-based systems are achieved in two phases [4]: a first batch growth phase on glycerol followed by a second phase (fed-batch), where methanol or a mixture of glycerol plus methanol is fed to the culture. During the second phase, production of the recombinant protein takes place. In contrast to the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, where high yields of a recombinant product expressed from a methanol pathway promoter can be achieved with glycerol or glucose in appropriate amounts (i.e. limited feeding of a culture with glucose) and without the addition of methanol [5,6], cultivation modes for P. pastoris based on the PAOX1 system depend strictly on methanol for induction [7]. Growth conditions and fermentation process parameters, particularly the feed-induction strategy have shown to have a dramatic impact in the overall process productivity [8], requiring a tight control of the methanol concentration in the reactor. Thus, although a wide variety of proteins have been produced successfully using the PAOX1, this promoter may not be appropriate or convenient in some situations [9]. For instance, in small and micro scale cultures (e.g. shake flasks and micro plates), methanol rapidly evaporates and it is inconvenient to on-line monitor and control methanol concentrations within an optimal range. Also, methanol metabolism utilises oxygen at high rates, and expression of foreign proteins is negatively affected by oxygen limitation, which may take place under these cultivation conditions. The constitutive strong promoter from the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (PGAP) is readily available for heterologous expression of proteins in P. pastoris [10]. However, strong constitutive promoters are not a good choice for the over expression of proteins showing cell toxicity. One strategy to simplify the control strategies for methanol concentration (and, therefore, specific growth rate) is the use of P. pastoris strains with limited methanol assimilation capacity: There are three types of P. pastoris host strains available that vary with regard to their ability to utilise methanol: the wild type or methanol utilisation plus phenotype [Mut+], and those resulting from deletions in the AOX1 gene (methanol utilisation slow [Muts]) or both AOX1 & AOX2 genes (methanol utilisation minus [Mut−]) [11]. An advantage of Muts strains is that the culture is not as sensitive to residual methanol in the fermentation media relative to Mut+ strains and hence the process of scale-up can be easier [4]. The specific growth rate is a critical parameter in the optimisation of product formation [12,13]. There is an optimum growth rate for optimum product formation, which is protein specific. In this context, the use of Muts strains offers a straightforward strategy for the biological control of the specific growth rate of the cells. A second strategy could be the use of methanol-free, regulated, promoter systems such as the recently characterised P. pastoris FLD1 promoter [9]. The gene encodes a formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FLD), a key enzyme required for the catabolism of methanol as carbon source and certain primary amines, such as methylamine as nitrogen source in methylotrophic yeasts [14]. The activity of this enzyme is increased drastically in cells grown under ammonium or amine limitation or, under carbon limitation, in the presence of amines as sole source of nitrogen [15]. The PFLD1 has been shown to be strongly and independently induced by either methanol as sole carbon source or methylamine as sole nitrogen source. Moreover, the PFLD1 has shown similar transcriptional efficiency and tight regulation when compared to PAOX1 in shake flask cultures, thus providing a potentially attractive alternative for regulated, strong, methanol-independent expression of foreign genes in P. pastoris [9]. Recently, the PFLD1 from P. pastoris [9] has been used for the heterologous expression of the lipase gene (GeneBank accession no. AF229435) from Rhizopus oryzae [16,17] in P. pastoris [18]. Also, in previous studies, this lipase has been successfully over expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the PAOX1 [18]. Furthermore, expression of ROL under the constitutive PGAP promoter resulted in extremely low extra cellular lipase levels in high cell density fed-batch cultivations [19]. This could be related to the observation that direct synthesis of the mature form of ROL in E. coli cells had toxic consequences [20]. In this study, we report the first approach towards the design of methanol-free high cell density fed-batch cultivation strategies for controlled heterologous protein production with PFLD1-based systems in P. pastoris. Further, this has allowed us to carry out the first comparative study of the heterologous expression of ROL in batch and high cell density fed-batch bioreactor cultivation processes using two different regulated promoters, i.e. PAOX1 and PFLD1."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains,2.1 Strains The wild type P. pastoris X-33 strain containing the vector pPICZαAROL [8] was used for heterologous expression of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) under the control of the AOX1 promoter. P. pastoris X-33 containing the vector pPICZFLDαROL [18] was selected for the expression of ROL controlled by the FLD1 promoter.
3,Culture maintenance,"2.2 Culture maintenance P. pastoris strains were grown on YPD plates containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose, 2% (w/v) agar and stored at 4°C. Long term stocks were prepared as recommended by invitrogen and stored frozen at −80°C."
4,Inoculum preparation,"2.3 Inoculum preparation Pre-inoculums for bioreactor cultures were grown for 24h in baffled shake flasks at 30°C, 250rpm, in BMGY (buffered glycerol-complex medium) containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 4×10−5% (w/v) biotin, 1% (w/v) glycerol in 50ml of final volume. The 50ml culture was used to inoculate a 500ml (final working volume) of BMGY in a 1l top-bench bioreactor (Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany). The culture was grown overnight at 30°C and subsequently centrifuged at 5000rpm. Harvested cells were resuspended in bioreactor culture medium and used to inoculate a 5l Biostat ED bioreactor (Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany)."
5,Batch fermentation culture medium for PFLD1,"2.4 Batch fermentation culture medium for PFLD1 Bioreactor batch cultivations were carried out using a mineral medium (MM) having the following composition per liter: KH2PO4 4.8g, MgSO4·7H2O 1.88g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.144g, sorbitol 20g and methylamine chloride 8g, 0.1ml of antifoam Mazu DF 7960 – a polyoxyalkylene glycol- (Mazer Chemicals, PPG Industries Inc., USA), 1ml of a biotin solution (400mg/l), and 1ml of trace salts solution [21]. The biotin and trace salts components were sterilised separately by micro filtration."
6,Batch fermentation culture medium for PAOX1,"2.5 Batch fermentation culture medium for PAOX1 The complex medium have the following composition per litre: (NH4)2SO4 5g, YNB (Yeast Nitrogen Base without aminoacids and ammonium sulphate, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) 1.7g, methanol 10g, 0.1ml of antifoam Mazu DF 7960 and 4.35ml of PTM1. The PTM1 solution contained per litre: CuSO4·5H2O 6.0g, NaI 0.08g, MnSO4·H2O 3.0g, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.2g, H3BO3 0.02g, CoCl2 0.5g, ZnCl2 20.0g, FeSO4·7H2O 65.0g, biotin 0.3g, H2SO4 (concentrated, 5ml). The pH was controlled using KOH 1M. The ammonium sulphate was autoclaved in situ in the bioreactor, the YNB was autoclaved separately and the PTM1 solution was sterile filtered. Both solutions were added to the bioreactor at room temperature together with the single carbon source, methanol."
7,Fed-batch fermentation medium under the control of PFLD1,"2.6 Fed-batch fermentation medium under the control of PFLD1 Bioreactor fed-batch cultivations were carried out using a mineral media with the following composition per litre: for the batch phase, KH2PO4 13.20g, MgSO4·7H2O 4.70g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.36g, glycerol 40g and ammonium chloride 6.76g, EDTA 0.08g, 0.1ml of antifoam Mazu DF 7960, 1ml of a biotin solution (400mg/l), and 1ml of trace salts solution [21]. After the batch phase a pulse of sorbitol and methylamine was added to achieve a concentration of 10g/l of sorbitol and 3g/l of methylamine chloride into the bioreactor. For the induction phase a 300g/l of sorbitol, 30g/l of methylamine chloride and 7.5ml of trace salts solution feeding medium was used in a pre-programmed exponential feeding rate strategy."
8,Fed-batch fermentation medium under the control of PAOX1,"2.7 Fed-batch fermentation medium under the control of PAOX1 The basal salt synthetic medium for fed-batch cultivations contained per litre of distilled water: H3PO4 (85%) 26.7ml, CaSO4 0.93g, K2SO4 18.2g, MgSO4·7H2O 14.9g, KOH 4.13g, glycerol 40g, and 4.35ml of PTM1 solution (the same from batch medium). The basal salt medium was autoclaved in situ except for the PTM1 solution, which was sterile filtered, and added after the medium had cooled to room temperature. 0.1ml of antifoam Mazu DF 7960 was added when necessary at a maximal final concentration of 10mg/l. The fermentation started with a batch phase with 40g/l of glycerol. After that, a transition phase for 5h followed. During the first 2h, the glycerol feeding rate was 300μl/min, it then decreased to 160μl/min in the third hour, to 100μl/min in the fourth hour, and finally to 65μl/min during the final hour. The methanol feeding was started at the third hour and was kept constant at 100μl/min until the end of this phase. Finally, the induction phase was carried out; the methanol addition rate in the culture was manually modified to maintain less than 5g/l. In these last phases, 12ml of PTM1 were added to 1l of glycerol (50% (v/v)) and 1l of pure methanol, respectively."
9,Fermentation conditions,"2.8 Fermentation conditions Cells were cultured in a 5l Braun Biostat ED fermenter (Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany). The fermentation conditions were: stirring rate 800rpm, temperature 30°C, pH controlled at 5.5 by adding NH4OH 30% (v/v) for PAOX1 and 5M KOH for PFLD1, dissolved oxygen controlled above 30% with an air flow rate between 1.5 and 20l/min. The carbon sources, glycerol, methanol, sorbitol and methylamine were either added in the transition and production phases by an automatic microburette MicroBU-2031 from Crison Instruments (Alella, Barcelona, Spain). The initial working volume in the batch phase was 3.5l."
10,Biomass analysis,2.9 Biomass analysis Biomass was expressed as dry cell weight as reported elsewhere [22].
11,"Glycerol, sorbitol, methanol, ammonium and methylamine determination","2.10 Glycerol, sorbitol, methanol, ammonium and methylamine determination Glycerol and sorbitol was determined by a HP 1050 liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using an Aminex HPX-87H ion-exchange column from Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The mobile phase was 15mM sulphuric acid. Data was quantified by the Millenium 2.15.10 software (Waters Corporation, Mildford, MA, USA) being 3% the R.S.D. obtained. Methanol was analysed by a HP 5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using a capillary column Tracsil TR-FFAP 25m×0.53mm×1μm (Tracer-Teknokroma, St. Cugat del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain) and equipped with an automatic injector (HP 7376) and a FID detector. Operating conditions were 200 and 280°C for injector and detector, respectively, oven-temperature profile 40°C (2min), 20°C/min to 200°C, 200°C (5min) giving a total analysis time of about 15min. Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 9ml/min. The selected fuel gas was hydrogen. Internal standard was isopropanol (4g/l) mixed at 50% (v/v) with samples. Data was quantified by Millenium 32 software (Waters Corporation, Mildford, MA, USA). The estimated R.S.D. was about 2%. Methylamine was analysed by HPLC (Hewlett Packard 1090) with UV–vis diode array detector using a Hypersil AA-ODS column (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a Hypersil ODS Guard precolumn. Solvent A: 20mM sodium acetate, 0.3% (v/v) tetrahydrofurane (THF), 0.018% (v/v) Triethilamine (TEA); Solvent B: 100mM sodium acetate, 40% (v/v) methanol, 40% (v/v) acetonitrile. Ammonium was determined with the ammonium–nitrogen assay kits LCK-302 and LCK-305 from Dr. Lange (Dr. Lange, Düsseldorf, Germany) following the manufacturer instructions."
12,Lipolytic activity determination,"2.11 Lipolytic activity determination Lipolytic activity determination was carried out using a lipase colorimetric assay (kit 1821792; Roche diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) [18]."
13,Protease activity assay,2.12 Protease activity assay Protease activity was determined using the substrate azocasein. The analysis was carried out as described elsewhere [8].
14,Results and discussion,
15,Bioreactor batch cultivations,"3.1 Bioreactor batch cultivations Previous studies in shake flask and bioreactor batch cultures have demonstrated that ROL expression under the control of PFLD1 using sorbitol and methylamine as carbon and nitrogen sources is at least as efficient as the PAOX1 system [18]. Sorbitol was used as carbon source because it has been shown that PFLD1 controlled heterologous gene expression is strongly repressed by excess or either glycerol or glucose, but not sorbitol, during growth using methylamine both as sole nitrogen source and inducing substrate [18]. With the aim of exploring the potentiality of PFLD1-based system for high cell density fed-batch cultivation and its comparison with using PAOX1-based system, batch bioreactor cultivations on methanol as a sole carbon source and ammonium sulphate as a N-source were performed. In this system higher reproducibility than in shake flask cultures can be achieved because of controlled operational conditions (DO, pH, agitation). Due to the intrinsic characteristics of Muts phenotype, i.e. its very low specific growth rate on methanol, batch fermentations were only performed with Mut+ and PFLD1 strains. The results obtained are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 and the values of the main fermentation parameters in Table 1 . PFLD1 culture showed a lower μmax, probably due to nitrogen limitation that cells experiment when growing on methylamine as single nitrogen source [15]. However the Y X/S was 1.6-fold higher than PAOX1. While lipolytic activity was only detected when methanol concentration was practically exhausted from the culture broth, probably due to the fact that PAOX1 transcription efficiency is higher under methanol-limiting concentrations [1]. Significant levels of lipolytic activity (5U/ml) were detected in the presence of an excess of carbon source (sorbitol 7g/l) with PFLD1. The specific productivity (units per lipase per gram of biomass per hour) and the productivity were 3.4- and 1.4-fold higher for the PAOX1-based system. Nevertheless, these values are magnified due to the high lag period observed in the PFLD1-based culture (55h versus 8h when PAOX1 was used). It seems that P. pastoris needs more time to adapt its metabolism machinery to the assimilation of sorbitol-methylamine than for methanol–ammonium. When the lag time was not included in the determination of the productivity both values were similar, i.e. about 300U lipase/(lh). However, in terms of specific activity, it was 2.2-fold higher for PAOX1. From these values it can be concluded that PFLD1 could be a valid alternative to avoid the use of methanol for the heterologous protein production in P. pastoris. The next step consisted in the evaluation of the performance of PFLD1and PAOX1 in high cell density fed-batch cultures."
16,Bioreactor fed-batch cultivations with the PAOX1-based system,"3.2 Bioreactor fed-batch cultivations with the PAOX1-based system The selected fed-batch strategy was identical for both Mut + and Muts phenotypes. Once glycerol used as carbon source in the batch phase was consumed (indicated by a sharp increase of the dissolved oxygen levels), a transition phase with simultaneous feeding of glycerol and methanol was performed according to a modified scheme proposed by [23]. In the transition phase high specific growth rates and methanol assimilation rates were observed. This allowed to reduce the overall cultivation time and to increase process productivity [8,24]. After the transition, the induction phase was started feeding methanol as the sole carbon source. The feeding rate was modified through the induction phase according to the methanol consumption rate of the culture. This rate was estimated considering the off-line measurements of the residual methanol. In this way, methanol concentration was kept below 5g/l, thus preventing the build up of the methanol concentration up to growth rate-inhibitory (toxic) levels. Fermentation data from fed-batch cultivations using Muts and Mut+ strains is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . As expected, all strains behave identically when growing on glycerol as the sole carbon source during the initial batch phase. The observed Y X/S was about 0.5 (g biomass/g glycerol) and the estimated μ max about 0.18(1/h) for both strains. For the transition phase, glycerol was always at limiting concentrations, below detection limits. This allowed derepression of methanol assimilation pathway enzymes, as revealed by the observation that methanol was consumed and low lipolytic activity levels were detected in the extracellular media during this phase. The effect of Mut phenotype on ROL production can be assessed when comparing the major parameters calculated for fed-batch cultivations with Mut+ and Muts strains (Table 2 ). In the Mut+ strain cultivation, a maximum of extracellular lipolytic activity of 150U/ml was achieved after 50h of cultivation at a biomass of about 60g/l. After this point, lipolytic activity slightly decreased. In the Muts strain cultivation, equivalent lipolytic activity levels were also reached after 70h of cultivation but at a lower biomass (ca. 32g/l). Moreover, extracellular lipase levels steadily increased up to about 205U/ml after 90h of cultivation, with biomass levels around 35g/l. Overall, the maximum lipolytic activity achieved, the specific productivity, and the Y P/X obtained with the Muts were 1.4-, 1.4- and 2.4-fold higher, respectively, than with the Mut+ strain, indicating that the Muts was more efficient for ROL production. However, in terms of productivity, the Mut+ strain reached a higher value (2879UA/(lh)) than the Muts strain (2246UA/(lh)), thus compensating the lower production levels achieved with the Mut+ strain (150U/ml versus 205U/ml) with its shorter induction fermentation time (30h versus 65h). A higher lipase production rate for Muts cultivations could indicate that lipase synthesis and secretion is favoured in this strain. Growth and, consequently, consumption rates in the Mut+ strain cultivation were higher than with the Muts strain, which is consistent with the fact that Muts strains must rely exclusively on the AOX2 gene for alcohol oxidase synthesis. The cultivation with the Mut+ strain revealed some operational problems: First, the product degradation (shown by a decrease in extracellular lipolytic activity) was observed when biomass levels of 50g/l (dry cell weight) or higher were reached, as observed in Fig. 4. Proteolytic degradation of ROL occurred in spite that pH of the cultivation medium, pH 5.5, was below the optimum reported for endogenous P. pastoris proteases [25]. Further, once product degradation was detected, addition of casaminoacids did not stop the process. Some authors detected an increase of proteolytic activity when the ammonium levels in the cultivation medium decreased below 0.3mg/l, thus suggesting that the protease activity may be induced by nitrogen starvation [26]. Analysis of ammonium throughout the production phase of fed-batch cultivations confirmed that ammonium became limiting above biomass levels of about 50g/l, and it was indicated as a possible cause of protease production. Second, with and agitation of 1000rpm and 20l/min air flow rate it was not possible to maintain the dissolved oxygen in the bioreactor above 20% for biomass concentration higher than 65g/l in the cultivation with the Mut+ phenotype. Third, the need of an effective on-line methanol control system to avoid abrupt fluctuations in the residual methanol concentration is concluded from this study, being essential for the development of a robust and reproducible production process. This control is more necessary for Mut+ phenotype because of its higher consumption rate of methanol. In this respect, the Muts fermentation was more easily conducted. Hence, it was possible to maintain the residual methanol concentration within a narrow range to maximize the productivity of the process."
17,Bioreactor fed-batch cultivation under PFLD1,"3.3 Bioreactor fed-batch cultivation under PFLD1 Based on previous batch cultivation studies [18], a new methanol-free strategy for high cell density fed-batch cultures and regulated heterologous protein production using PFLD1-system is proposed. In those studies, it was observed that high expression levels under FLD1 with methylamine also requires the use of a non-repressing carbon source. Hence, the growth batch phase was similar to PAOX1, but the medium composition had only the stoichiometric quantity of ammonium chloride necessary for the total exhaustion of both carbon and nitrogen sources. The stoichiometric ratio was 0.16g NH4Cl/g glycerol calculated from P. pastoris elemental composition and the YX/S growing on glycerol-ammonium. So, ammonium concentration at the end of the batch was practically zero. Previous to the induction phase, a transition phase to allow adaptation of P. pastoris metabolic pathways to the assimilation of new carbon and nitrogen sources, i.e. sorbitol and methylamine, was designed. It consisted of a batch of 10g/l of sorbitol and 3g/l of methylamine. Once the microorganism was consuming both substrates, the induction fed-batch phase was started. Due to the lack of a specific on-line sensor for sorbitol concentration, a pre-programmed exponential feeding rate strategy with the objective to control the specific growth rate during the fed-batch induction phase was selected and implemented. The selected specific growth rate was 0.015 (1/h), i.e. 50% the maximum specific growth rate determined in batch culture, to avoid a possible inhibitory effect of sorbitol accumulation during the fed-batch cultivation. If a quasi-steady state is assumed for the residual substrate concentration, the specific growth rate of the culture at time (t) can be obtained from fed-batch substrate balance (Eq. (1)) (1) μ ( t ) = Y X / S F ( t ) ( S 0 − S ) V ( t ) X ( t ) On the other hand, integrating fed-batch biomass balance (Eq. (2)) (2) X ( t ) V ( t ) = X ( t 0 ) V ( t 0 ) exp ( μ ( t − t 0 ) ) and combining these equations, the feeding rate (F) can be expressed by Eq. (3) (3) F = μ [ X ( t 0 ) V ( t 0 ) ] Y X / S ( S 0 − S ) exp [ μ ( t − t 0 ) ] This feeding rate can be applied if initial volume (V(t 0)), biomass (X(t 0)) and Y X/S are known and the latter is assumed to be constant during the fermentation. The Y X/S used was 0.43g biomass/g sorbitol, as determined from batch cultures. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . As expected, PFLD1-based strain behave identically to PAOX1 when growing on glycerol-ammonium during the batch-phase with similar Y X/S and μ max values. Shortly after medium switch, sorbitol-methylamine were consumed in the transition phase and heterologous ROL was detected in the culture broth at the end of this stage, previous to the induction phase. Thus, during the transition phase a quick derepression of methylamine assimilation pathway enzymes was observed. The induction phase started at 28h. Sorbitol accumulation was not observed throughout the fermentation and analysis of methylamine showed concentrations above 1g/l, confirming than sorbitol was the limiting substrate. The specific growth rate of the microorganisms during the induction phase was quite constant. However, its mean value was 0.01(1/h), lower than the pre-programmed specific growth rate value (0.0151/h). In this phase, the actual YX/S was 0.3g biomass/g sorbitol, lower than the obtained from batch cultures and used in the Eq. (3). The Y X/S obtained in fed-batch fermentations may depend on the specific growth rate. For instance, at lower specific growth rate, lower the Y X/S have been observed for fed-batch cultivations with yeast [27]. This fact could justify the lower specific growth rate reached during the induction phase. The use of a pre-programmed exponential feeding rate strategy has the drawback that any possible perturbation, that may affect the system, is not compensated. In that case, the microorganism could growth out of the pre-programmed specific growth rate with a negative effect on the optimal protein production. After 40h of sorbitol/methylamine feeding the maximum lipolytic activity reached was 170UA/ml and protease activity was not detected."
18,Fed-batch cultivations comparison,"3.4 Fed-batch cultivations comparison In Table 2 fermentation parameters of both strains expressing ROL under the control of PAOX1 (Mut+ and Muts) and the strain expressing ROL under the PFLD1 control are shown. The maximum lipolytic activity, Y P/X and specific productivity were 1.4, 2.4 and 1.4-fold higher for Muts strain compared to Mut+ strain, and 1.2-, 1.4- and 1.1-fold higher compared to PFLD1-based system. This strain was more efficient than the PAOX-based Mut+ strain, having similar yields and specific productivities to PAOX1-based Muts strain. Nevertheless, the analysis of the productivity showed similar values. PAOX1-based Mut+ strain was 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than PFLD1-based and PAOX1-based Muts strains. The PAOX1-based Mut+ strain compensates its lower specific protein production rate with its higher growth rate. From these results it can be concluded that the PFLD1-based system is, at least, as efficient as PAOX1 for ROL production."
19,Conclusions,"The performance of P. pastoris-based systems for the heterologous ROL production in high cell density cultivations using the control of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1) and the new formaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 promoter (PFLD1) has been evaluated. A new fed-batch strategy has been proposed for the production of heterologous protein under the transcriptional control of the PFLD1. The PFLD1 system has demonstrated to be a promising alternative to the PAOX1 system, regardless the Mut phenotype used in high cell fed-batch cultures. The comparison of PFLD1- and PAOX1-based systems demonstrates that PFLD1 is, at least, as efficient as PAOX1 in terms of productivity and specific productivity. However, fed-batch strategy for PFLD1-based systems must be improved; for instance, by implementing on-line monitoring strategies for sorbitol concentration and specific growth rate to avoid the use of pre-programmed feeding strategies, which could not adapt to possible perturbations of the system. On the other hand, on-line monitoring schemes would allow implementing control strategies to assure the specific growth rate or sorbitol concentration within their optimal values to optimise the productivity of the system. Also, from the industrial point of view, it would help to get a robust process, because inducer substrates feeding strategy is the key factor that controls not only recombinant protein induction but also protease production [28]. From the operation point of view, PAOX-based Muts and PFLD1-based strains are better than PAOX-based Mut+ strain. Due to the high specific growth rate on methanol, and consequently methanol consumption rate, Mut+ strains need more effective on-line methanol control systems to maintain the methanol concentration within its optimal range than those required for Muts strain. On the other hand, the presence of proteolytic activity detected at high cell densities using Mut+ strain has not been observed with the other strains. The high oxygen demand of P. pastoris growing on methanol normally requires supplementation of pure oxygen to achieve highest cell densities, due to higher specific growth rates of this strain on methanol. Because of cost and safety considerations, the application of pure oxygen, especially in combination with the highly flammable substrate methanol might be a drawback in industrial large-scale fermentation [29]. Thus, the expression of heterologous ROL using methanol-free culture strategies with PFLD1 strains could be more attractive from an industrial point of view, because first, the oxygen demand of the system growing in sorbitol/methylamine is lower than for a Mut+ strain growing on methanol, and second, methylamine is a less volatile and flammable inducer than methanol."
