0,Introduction,"Facing the excessive use of fossil energy and the increasingly serious environmental pollution problem, the use of infinite solar energy is a possible and promising solution [1,2]. Since Fujishima and Honda's research on the photoelectrochemical hydrogen production of titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoanode in 1972, semiconductor-based photocatalysts have received widespread attention worldwide [3]. And many photocatalysts have been developed, such as TiO2 [4], CdS [5,6], Zn0.5Cd0.5S [7,8], BiVO4 [9], g-C3N4 [10,11], MOFs and their derivatives [12,13]. However, the light conversion efficiency and photocatalytic performance have not improved significantly. In order to synthesize advanced high-efficiency photocatalytic materials, the research interest of semiconductor materials based on MOFs and its derivatives is increasing. As an kind of emerging material, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are important and potential materials in heterogeneous catalytic reactions due to its rich pore structure, large specific surface, high structural diversity, adjustable chemical properties, and highly dispersed metal sites [14,15]. MOFs are used as precursors for the synthesis of MOF-based hybrid structures, which will provide more opportunities for the comprehensive conversion and application of MOFs and develop more unique potentials about MOFs. Low-temperature phosphating of different kinds of MOFs can lead to excellent performance of transition metal phosphides, such as Ni2P [16,17], CoP [18–21], FeP [22,23], Cu3P [24,25], Rh2P [26]and NiCoP [27]. These phosphides, as n-type semiconductors, are favorable for accepting photo-generated electrons. In previous research reports, transition metal phosphides were mainly used as co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H2 release to improve the separation and transport efficiency of electron-hole pairs [28–30]. In fact, the transition metal phosphide alone exhibits better photocatalytic performance under dye sensitization conditions, mainly due to its narrow band gap structure and strong light absorption capacity [31,32]. A promising approach to enhance the catalytic performance of MOFs and their derivatives is to change MOFs into a core-shell structure [33]. Here, we developed a novel in-situ growth scheme that combined the advantages of ZIF-9 and Cu3(BTC)2, and used Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell material as a precursor to derive Cu3P@CoP composite catalyst. Since Cu3P is a p-type semiconductor and CoP is a n-type semiconductor, the Cu3P@CoP composite catalyst obtained from Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell material not only has a layered structure, but also builds a p-n heterogeneity at the interface. In order to understand this phosphation more deeply, we control the degree of phosphation of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) material on the one hand, and adjust the ratio of Cu to Co by changing the content of Cu-MOFs to explore its reasons and rules for the formation of photocatalytic activity. The unique structure and composition of Cu3P@CoP can promote charge separation and migration, provide large surface area and rich active sites to drive water photolysis. The results show that the optimized Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst exhibits generation activity of 469.95 μmol H2 and has high stability. Our work will provide a new strategy for the rational design of efficient catalysts of MOFs derivatives."
1,Experimental,
2,Cu-MOFs (Cu3BTC2) and ZIF-9(Co) preparation,"2.1 Cu-MOFs (Cu3BTC2) and ZIF-9(Co) preparation In a typical synthesis process, 0.01 mmol Cu (NO3)2·3H2O and 0.03 mmol 1,3,5 pyromellitic acid were firstly weighed and dissolved in 50 mL ethanol,then the mixture was stirred for 1 h and transferred to an oven at 140 °C for 24 h. After being washed and dried, blue Cu-MOFs powder was obtained. The synthesis of pure ZIF-9 was carried out in aqueous solution at room temperature. 0.23 g benzimidazole and 0.28 g Co (NO3)3·6H2O were weighand dissolved in 40 mL of water. After the mixture was stirred for 15 min, 5 mL of ammonia was added into the mixture and then stirred for 45 min. Finally, it was kept in the dark for 8 h and dried by centrifuge to obtain the product."
3,Preparation of composite sample,"2.2 Preparation of composite sample In the process of synthesizing ZIF-9, a certain amount of pre-synthesized Cu-MOFs was added during the aging process under dark conditions. Cu-Co-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4. x refers to the changed Cu-MOFs mass) was obtained by adjusting the precursor of ZIF-9 synthesized by benzimidazole and Co(NO)3·6H2O Cu-Co-xP-2 (x = 1, 2, 3, 4; x is the mass ratio of precursor to sodium hypophosphite) composite catalyst was obtained by phosphating different Cu-Co-2 (Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9) with a 0.125 g Cu-MOFs. Phosphating experiments of the catalyst were carried out under the conditions of nitrogen protection by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h. In addition, Cu-Co-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4.) was subjected to phosphatization experiments of the same degree (sodium hypophosphite has twice the mass of Cu-Co-x) to obtain Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4.) composite catalyst. The phosphorylated products of pure Cu-MOFs and ZIF-9 are referred to as Cu-P and Co-P. The specific catalyst synthesis diagram is shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray Diffraction measurement of the obtained samples was carried out by an advanced diffractometer operating (HORIBA Scientific, France; 40 kV and 30 mA). SEM (Zeiss evo10) were used to obtain the morphology information of the samples. TEM: FEI Tecnai TF20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. XPS testing was performed on an energy dispersive X-ray instrument (ESCALAB 250Xi) using energy dispersive X-ray analysis. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were tested on a PerkinElmer Lambda-750 UV–vis-near-IRvia spectrometer using BaSO4 the reference for baseline correction. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the sample were obtained at 77 K using ASAP2020M. The PL spectra were acquired by a FLUOROMAX-4 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Na2SO4 (0.2 M) aqueous solution was used as supporting electrolyte. In a standard three-electrode cell, the photoelectrochemical measurement was performed on an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat4-400, Advanced measurement Technology, Inc)."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements In a standard three-electrode cell, the photoelectrochemical measurement was performed on an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat4-400, Advanced measurement Technology, Inc). Mott-Schottky’s test frequency was 1000 Hz. LSV were measured at room temperature with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Transient photocurrent measurements at open circuit potential were recorded under visible light illumination. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source, and a 420 nm cut filter filters the ultraviolet light. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) pattern was acquired at an open circuit potential with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz and a modulation amplitude of 5 mV. Na2SO4 (0.2 M) aqueous solution was used as supporting electrolyte."
6,Hydrogen production experiments,"2.5 Hydrogen production experiments The tests of photocatalytic H2 evolution performance were carried out in a 62 mL quartz reaction flask with a flat window. Specific steps were as follows: TEOA was used as the electron donor, photocatalyst powder and EY was added into TEOA aqueous solution (15%). Before light source irradiation, ultrasonic dispersion was used and lasted to form homogeneous solution, and nitrogen was used to remove air in the system to form anaerobic environment. The photocatalyst in suspension was evenly dispersed with a magnetic stirrer. A 5 W LED white-light multi-channel was used as simulated solar light source in the photocatalytic reaction system. Each time 0.5 mL of evolved gas was extracted from the reaction flask to analyze the produced hydrogen amount by taking gas chromatography (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13Xcolumn, N2 as carrier)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"1 Morphology, structure and compositions analysis","3.1 1 Morphology, structure and compositions analysis The XRD patterns of the synthesized Cu-MOFs and ZIF-9(Co) are shown in Fig. S1(a), which are consistent with the results reported in the literature [34–36]. After Cu-MOF and Co-MOFs are respectively phosphated, Cu-P and Co-P samples can be obtained. After fully phosphating ZIF-9, there exist typical diffraction peaks in 2θ = 31.60°, 35.18°, 36.34°, 46.19°, 48.18°, and 56.27°, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The analysis can be indexed to the JCPDS#65-1474 standard card of CoP. The corresponding crystal planes are (0 1 1), (2 0 0), (1 1 1), (1 1 2), (2 1 1), and (2 0 2). The weakening in the intensity of all the peaks of CoP indicates relatively low degree crystallization [37]. In the XRD pattern of Cu-P (Fig. 2(b)), the corresponding characteristic peaks of Cu3P (JCPDS#74-1067) and Cu element (JCPDS#70-3038) can be observed. The characteristic peaks of Cu3P appear at 28.43°, 35.86°, 38.90°, 41.38°, 44.91°, 46.02°, 47.08°, 53.30°, 56.74°, 58.14°, 66.34° and 73.01°, corresponding to (1 1 1), (1 1 2), (0 2 2), (2 1 1), (3 0 0), (1 1 3), (1 2 2), (1 0 4), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (2 2 3), and (3 2 2) crystal planes. The obvious diffraction peaks of (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) plane diffraction of elemental Cu are located at 43.17° and 50.29°. Fig. 2(c) shows the results of Cu-Co-xP-2 (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) composite catalysts obtained by phosphating at different degrees. The outer layer of ZIF-9 was gradually phosphorylated to produce diffraction peaks related to CoP. With the increasing of phosphating degree in the composite samples, the content of phosphide (Cu3P, CoP) gradually increases, and the intensity of the related diffraction peaks gradually increases. Because the crystallinity of the outer phosphide is relatively low, the related diffraction peaks of the internal unphosphorized Cu-MOFs is enhanced. The spectra of Cu-Co-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) obtained by adjusting the mass of nucleated Cu-MOFs and maintaining the quality of the outer layer ZIF-9 are shown in Fig. S1(b). There are both Cu-MOFs and ZIF-9 peaks, and the diffraction peaks related to Cu-MOFs increase as the mass of Cu-MOFs increases. Cu-Co-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) was phosphorylated to obtain Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4 composite catalyst (Fig. 2(d)). With the increasing of the mass of Cu-MOFs under the same phosphatization degree, the diffraction peaks related to Cu-MOFs gradually decrease. Therefore, the Cu-Co-2P-4 sample only contains the diffraction peaks of Cu3P, Cu and CoP, and there are no peaks of MOFs. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 3 , displaying the characteristics morphology of Cu-MOFs, ZIF-9(Co) and Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Cu-Co-2) as well as the samples after phosphating. In Fig. 3(a), the sample of Cu-MOFs exists as a regular octahedron, and the surface is relatively smooth. ZIF-9(Co) displays the morphology of the 2D nanosheet which is well-shaped and has averaged size (Fig. 3(b)). When ZIF-9(Co) grows on the surface of Cu-MOFs, the growth of 2D nanosheets is suppressed to a certain degree. Therefore, ZIF-9(Co) on the surface of Cu-MOFs in the Cu-Co-2 composite sample shown in Fig. 3(c) exists in the form of fibrous rods or small pieces. Cu-P, Co-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 composite samples were obtained by phosphating Cu-MOFs, ZIF-9(Co) and Cu-Co-2 samples, as shown in Fig. 3(d-f). Cu-P samples almost do not have regular geometric shapes, showing larger particles and more denser. The SEM image of Co-P obtained from the phosphorization of Co-MOFs of 2D nanosheets is shown in Fig. 3(e). In Fig. 3(e), Co-P shows a very uniform and fine flaky structure. The SEM image of Cu-Co-2P-2 sample obtained by phosphating the Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Cu-Co-2) sample is shown in Fig. 3(f). In the composite sample, the surface of Co-MOFs is almost completely phosphatized, showing a small plate shape, and Cu-MOFs inside still have a small number of regular three-dimensional structures. Combined with XRD analysis, it can be seen that the phosphorization of Cu-MOFs is not complete, so there will be a small number of regular octahedral structures in Fig. 3(f). Cu-Co-2P-2 composite photocatalyst was tested by TEM characterization to further understand the morphology and microstructure of the catalyst. Figs. 4 (a) and S2(a, b) show the TEM images of Cu-Co-2P-2 composites at different magnifications, respectively. The results showed that Cu-P-2 and broken Cu-MOFs skeletons existed in the Cu-Co-2P-2 sample when Cu-MOFs was phosphated incompletely, and obvious transparent sheet-like Co-P appeared on the edges [37]. In addition, the HRTEM image of the Cu-Co-2P-2 composite is shown in Fig. 4(b). Cu-MOFs is perfectly combined with Co-MOFs phosphatium phospholipids, and the lattice fringes of Cu3P and CoP can be observed. The lattice spacings of 0.25 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the (1 1 2) and (1 1 1) crystal planes of Cu3P and CoP, respectively [38,39]. The existence of Cu (2 0 0) crystal plane can be also observed, and its lattice spacing is 0.18 nm. EDX results show that Cu-Co-2P-2 composites contain Cu, Co and P elements (Fig. 4(c)). According to XRD analysis, it can be seen that Cu-Co-2P-2 composites obtained after phosphating of Cu-Co-2 samples mainly exist in the form of Cu3P and CoP. At the same time, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Cu-Co-2P-2 (Fig. 4(d)) shows the relatively high crystalline characteristics of the composite sample. Fig. 4(e) is the map of Cu-Co-2P-2, in which the elements of Cu, Co, and P are evenly distributed. This shows that the phosphating of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) was successful. Fig. 5 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Co-P, Cu-P and Cu-Co-2P-2. The XPS measurement spectra of Co-P, Cu-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 and corresponding XPS spectra of various elements are shown in Fig. 5(a). It can be easily seen from Fig. 5(a) that MOFs derived Co-P and Cu-P photocatalysts contain Na, C, N and O. And Cu-Co-2P-2 composite photocatalysts have both Cu and Co signals. Fig. 5(b, c and d) are high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p, Cu 2p, and P 2p respectively. Fig. 5(b) shows the Co 2p peaks of Co-P and Cu-Co-2P-2, respectively. In the Co-P sample, the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are 778.1 eV and 793.1 eV respectively, while the binding energies of 777.9 eV and 800.1 eV corresponding to the satellite peak. In addition, the diffraction peaks of Cu-Co-2P-2 at 777.9 eV and 793.1 eV belong to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, and the corresponding satellite peaks are 779.9 eV and 799.9 eV respectively [39]. From pure CoP to Cu-Co-2P-2 composites, the binding energy of Co 2p3/2 is reduced. The test results of the Cu-P photocatalyst obtained by fully phosphating Cu-MOFs are shown in Fig. 5(c). In the Cu-Co-2P-2 sample, since the Cu-MOFs inside are only partially phosphorylated, the binding energy of the Cu 2p orbital is different from that of the Cu 2p orbital in the Cu-P sample. By analyzing the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2, it can be seen that in the Cu-Co-2P-2 sample, the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 is divided into 932.5 eV, while the binding energy of Cu-P sample is 932.6 eV [40]. These observations indicate that there is a strong electronic interaction between CoP and Cu3P in Cu-Co-2P-2, which is of great significance for promoting photocatalytic hydrogen production activity [41,42]. The XPS spectrum of the P 2p energy level is shown in Fig. 5(d). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the element P of Cu-P, Co-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 samples can be divided into two peaks. The three signals with binding energies of 133.7 eV (Cu-Co-2P-2), 133.5 eV (Cu-P) and 133.4 eV (Co-P) are resulted from the surface oxidation of the sample when it contacts with air, which is an oxidized P species [41,43]. The three peaks at 129.5 eV (Cu-Co-2P-2), 129.1 eV (Cu-P) and 129.4 eV (Co-P) correspond to the binding energy of the M-P (M = Cu, Co) bond, indicating the formation of metal phosphides. It is impressive that the peaks of Cu-Co-2P-2 both shift to a high binding energy compared with Co-P and Cu-P. These results further indicate that there is a strong electronic interaction between Cu3P and CoP in Cu-Co-2P-2, which is beneficial for improving the catalytic performance of the composite photocatalyst [40]. In addition, the results of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) tests can also prove the effect of incompletely phosphated Cu-MOFs on composites. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were tested at 77 K obtain pore volume, pore size as presented in Table S1 and Fig. S3. The isotherms of Co-P, Cu-P and partially phosphatized Cu-Co-2P-2 materials produced by fully phosphating belong to the IV isotherm [44]. With a H3 type hysteresis loop under relatively high pressure, which means that the mesoporous material has a multi-layer adsorption process due to capillary condensation. It is worth noting that Cu-Co-2P-2 material has the highest specific surface area, largest pore volume and average pore diameter. The excellent light absorption performance of the photocatalyst is a sufficient condition to ensure efficient photocatalytic activity. The photocatalysts were tested in the UV–Vis-NIR DRS (200–800 nm) before and after phosphating. The diffuse reflection spectra of ZIF-9(Co), Cu-MOFs and Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) samples before phosphating are shown in Fig. S4(a). Unphosphorylated pure ZIF-9 (Co) has strong absorption in 400–650 nm, while pure Cu-MOF is a blue powder and therefore also has strong absorption in the range of 500–800 nm. The Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) sample has strong absorption in the visible near-infrared region. This also provide an evidence from other side that Cu-MOFs and ZIF-9 are successfully assembled. Fig. S4(b) shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the Co-P, Cu-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 samples obtained from phosphating. The samples all show strong optical absorption density. Absorption in the ultraviolet and near infrared regions means that the catalyst can achieve electronic transitions at higher or lower energies. The stronger light absorption capacity of photocatalyst means the stronger probability of electron transfer under light, which is more favorable for H2 evolution [45,46]. Co-P, Cu-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 samples continue to maintain high levels of absorbance with increasing wavelength, which means that light energy is more utilized [47]. This is the important reason why both Co-P and Cu-P show a certain photocatalytic activity. The Cu-Co-2P-2 sample has the highest optical absorption density, which indicates that the strong light absorption performance of the black sample may be the main reason for its enhanced hydrogen evolution activity."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst The photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction of the catalyst was performed in a reaction system of 15 vt% triethanolamine as a sacrificial reagent. The use of EY sensitizer enhances the catalyst’s ability to absorb light. There is no hydrogen was generated in all samples under the dark state (without light). The activity ratio experiments of composite photocatalysts with different ratios and degrees of phosphatization were performed in TEOA solution at pH = 10. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 6 (a) that Cu-P and Co-P produced by complete phosphation of Cu-MOFs and ZIF-9(Co) show a certain photocatalytic hydrogen release activity, and the activity of Co-P is better than that of Cu-P. The photocatalytic activity of Cu-Co-xP-2 (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) composite photocatalysts was obtained from Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) composites with different degrees of phosphating treatment, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Under EY sensitized conditions, the in-situ phosphation was used to control the phosphorization of the Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell structure. The results show that the photocatalytic activity of the composite catalyst constructed by introducing a certain amount of P on the surface of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) has been significantly improved. The activity of Cu-Co-1P-2 and Cu-Co-2P-2 samples was significantly improved during slight phosphating. However, after further phosphating, the activity of Cu-Co-3P-2 and Cu-Co-4P-2 composite photocatalysts began to decrease. Combined with XRD (Fig. 2(c)), it can be seen that the production of CoP on the surface of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) and the exposure of unphosphorylated Cu-MOFs on the inner layer are the main reasons for the change in the activity of the composite photocatalyst. In order to adjust the internal and external phosphating ratio of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell structure, Cu-Co-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) materials with different Cu-Co ratios were constructed by adjusting the amount of Cu-MOFs. Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) photocatalyst was obtained under the same phosphating treatment. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the hydrogen-producing activity of Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) composite catalysts with different contents of Cu-MOFs was explored. The highest hydrogen-producing activity is the Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst. With the increase of Cu-MOFs content, the phosphatization degree of the whole sample also increased, so there is almost no Cu-MOFs peak in Cu-Co-2P-4. It can be seen that the excellent photocatalytic activity of Cu-Co-2P-2 composite catalyst can be derived from two aspects, on the one hand, the synergistic effect of CoP and Cu3P, which were derived from MOFs phosphation, play an important role. On the other hand, because the nucleated Cu-MOFs is not completely phosphated, it retains the three-dimensional structure as a reaction carrier. Table 1 shows the hydrogen production performance of Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst and other materials. From the comparison results in Table 1, it can be seen that the catalytic activity of Cu-Co-2P-2 catalysts has certain advantages. We further explored the effect of pH of system on the catalytic activity of Cu-Co-2P-2 composite photocatalyst. It can be seen from Fig. 6(d) that the Cu-Co-2P-2 composite photocatalyst exhibits different selectivity to the reaction environment and has the best activity at pH = 10. This shows that a mild alkaline environment is the most favorable factor for a hydrogen production system [36]. The system with extra acid orbase is not conducive to the process of the hydrogen precipitation reaction [37]. This is because the neutral solution contains a large amount of H+, which may cause the protonation of the triethanolamine solution and serious decrease of the electron donor effectiveness [46,47]. When the reaction conditions become strongly alkaline, the thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen evolution is obviously insufficient due to the lack of H+ [48]. In addition, the adsorption of EY molecules on the photocatalyst is also affected by the pH of solution in the reaction system. The cyclic stability of photocatalysts is very important for their applications. As shown in Fig. 7 , it is the photocatalytic activity test comparison for four cycles in consecutive 20 h. The catalyst and sacrificial reagent were not re-added during the entire experiment. 10 mg of EY was added to the reaction flask again at each regassing. Stability tests show that the total amount of produced hydrogen is only slightly reduced at the end of each cycle. This is mainly because the adsorbed EY dye is easily desorbed and diffused into the solution, and the catalyst has slight photo-induced corrosion [46,48,49]. SEM images of Cu-Co-2P-2 after the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction are obtained as presented in Fig. S2. It can seen that the surface of Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst after H2 production turns to be smooth, and the composite suffers from severe aggregation. Compared with the first cycle, the fourth cycle is only down by 13.7%, which indicates that the Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst has excellent cycle stability and certain application prospects."
10,Photoluminescence analysis,"3.3 Photoluminescence analysis The steady-state fluorescence spectrum was used to explored the fluorescence performance of the catalyst in EY solution. In addition to this, the electron transfer and excited state interactions between EY and photocatalyst were also discussed. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the pure EY solution produces the strongest fluorescence under the excitation light with wavelength of 480 nm. Different fluorescence intensity indicates different degrees of electron-hole recombination. When the fluorescence intensity is higher, the peak value is higher, showing that the number of excited electrons returned to the ground state by radiation decay transition is higher, which leads to higher recombination rate of electrons [53,54]. With the addition of photocatalyst materials, the signal decreases, indicating that the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs is reduced [55], and it is also shown that the electron-hole pair recombination of the catalyst is suppressed [56,57]. Fig. S5(a) shows the steady-state fluorescence curves of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9 catalysts with different degrees of phosphatization. The Cu-Co-2P-2 photocatalyst has the lowest fluorescence peak intensity, indicating that the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in Cu-Co-2P-2 is most significantly reduced. After adjusting the amount of internal Cu-MOFs, the fluorescence pattern of Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) prepared under the same phosphating conditions is shown in Fig. S5(b). With the increase of the mass of Cu-MOFs, the intensity of the fluorescence peak decreases at first and then increases indicating that thereexists a good ratio of Cu-MOFs to ZIF-9(Co) and good phosphation degree while preparing the composite photocatalyst. At the same time, in order to further test the fluorescence performance of Cu-Co-2P-2 catalyst, it was also compared with Cu-P and Co-P derived from pure Cu-MOFs and Co-MOFs. The results are shown in Fig. 8(a). In Cu-Co-2P-2 composite samples, the presence of Cu3P@CoP p-n type heterojunctions greatly promotes electron transport and improves charge separation efficiency, so the fluorescence peak intensity is the lowest . The dynamic conditions of photogenic carriers were detected by transient fluorescence, as shown in Figs. 8(b) and S5(c, d). The corresponding time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was fitted by using the three-exponential attenuation model. (1) I t = B + ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i e - t / τ i ; τ i s e m i s s i o n l i f e t i m e s ; A i s t h e c o r r e s p o n d i n g a m p l i t u d e . The transient fluorescence lifetimes of Cu-P, Co-P and Cu-Co-P semiconductor catalysts are shown in Table 2 . It can be clearly seen that due to the interaction between the dye molecule EY and the photocatalyst, the formed composites has weak fluorescence. At the same time, in order to obtained deeper insights for different phosphatization degrees and the difference in hydrogen production activity of various precursor ratios, instantaneous fluorescence test of Cu-Co-xP-2 and Cu-Co-2P-x (x = 1, 3, 4) composite catalyst have been alsodone, were correlated analysis results are shown in Table S2. The average life (τave) can be calculated by formula (2): (2) τ ave = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i τ i 2 ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i τ i ; τ i s e m i s s i o n l i f e t i m e s ; A i s t h e c o r r e s p o n d i n g a m p l i t u d e . It is clear from Table 2 and Table S2 that the average lifespan of all samples varies differently. The lifetime of pure EY was calculated to be 0.3579 ns, and the average life has been greatly improved after adding the photocatalyst material. The average lifetimes of Cu-P and Co-P were 0.2831 ns and 0.2884 ns, respectively. In particular, Cu-Co-2P-2 composites have the lowest average lifetime of 0.1325 ns, which indicated that the exist of Cu3P@CoP p-n type heterojunction can not only enhanced electron transfer but also significantly reduced the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [57]. The electron transfer rate constant is calculated by formula (3). (3) k et = 1 / τ F , s - 1 / τ F , l . k e t i s e l e c t r o n t r a n s f e r r a t e c o n s t a n t s ; τ F , s i s s h o r t l i f e t i m e s ; τ F , l i s l o n g l i f e t i m e s . Based on the difference between the long life and short life of the carriers in the sample, the specific charge transfer rate constants (ket) of all the catalyst samples were calculated in Table 2 and Table S2. The ket of Cu-Co-2P-2 is 1.198 × 1010, which is the largest among all catalysts. The maximum transfer rate means the fastest photo-generated charge transfer, the lowest recombination efficiency of photo-generated carriers, and the highest photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution. This is consistent with the results of the hydrogen evolution kinetics."
11,Photoelectrochemical characterization test,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical characterization test Generally, the photocurrent response is used to reveal the photoelectrochemical properties that occur on the photocatalyst surface [58,59]. Fig. 9 (a) shows the photocurrent response curves of Cu-P, Co-P and Cu-Co-2P-2. Under discontinuous intermittent irradiation, all the catalysts shows different photocurrent responses. The photocurrent intensity of all photocatalysts increases significantly under the irradiation. Afterwards, the intensity of photocurrent dropped slightly due to the accumulation of holes [60]. Compared with Cu-P and Co-P samples, Cu-Co-2P-2 showed the highest photocurrent density. This high photocurrent density further indicates that the photogenerated carriers in the partially phosphated Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9 composite catalyst with a special structure have a more effective separation efficiency and a lower recombination rate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic H2 Production activity. The polarization curves was used to explore the changes in the current density of Cu-P, Co-P, and Cu-Co-2P-2 as a function of voltage and the level of hydrogen production overpotential. The LSV curves of Cu-P, Co-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 9(b). Unsurprisingly, Cu-Co-2P-2 showed the fastest increase in current density, indicating that Cu-Co-2P-2 has a lower overpotential. The decrease of the hydrogen-producing overpotential was mainly due to the rapid electron transfer at the layered Cu-P@Co-P interface, which indicates that Cu-Co-2P-2 composite catalyst has strong HER activity [61]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were collected at open circuit potentials in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. As shown in Fig. 9(c), the size of the curvature radius of the curve reflects the size of the charge transfer resistance. The relatively small circular orphan indicates that the charge transfer is faster [58]. Cu-Co-2P-2 has the smallest radius of curvature, indicating its excellent electrical conductivity. The combination of Co-P and Cu-P constitutes a rapid transfer channel. Therefore, the Nyquist curve of Cu-Co-2P-2 composite shows a significantly reduced semicircle, which indicates that the charge transfer rate of Cu-Co-2P-2 composites is significantly enhanced. The Mott-Schottky tests of Co-P, Cu-P and Cu-Co-2P-2 are shown in Fig. 9(d-f). The positive and negative slope of the curve in the figure can be used as a basis for judging the type of semiconductors. The positive slope is a regular description of an n-type semiconductor, otherwise it is a p-type semiconductor. Pure Co-P in Fig. 9(d) has a positive slope, which is typical n-type semiconductor behavior. The slope of pure Cu-P is negative, indicating that Cu3P is a p-type semiconductor. The flat band potentials (Efb ) for Cu-P and Co-P are estimated at 1.21 V and −0.45 V, respectively, which are relative to SCE. According to the meaning of the flat band potential, the Fermi level (Ef ) position of pure CoP and pure Cu3P samples can also be roughly estimated. Generally, the conduction band potential (ECB ) of an n-type semiconductor is more negative −0.1 or −0.2 V than its flat band potential [58,62], while the valence band potential of a p-type semiconductor is corrected by 0.1 or 0.2 V. Therefore, the conduction band of Co-P is roughly estimated to be −0.65 V, and the valence band of Cu-P is roughly estimated to be 1.41 V relative to SCE. For the Cu-Co-2P-2 composite catalyst, there are two linear regions in the Mott-Schottky diagram, which can be attributed to the flat band potentials of the recombined CoP and Cu3P. This is due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction after the coupling of n-type CoP and p-type Cu3P, which results in a Fermi level shift, that is a shift in the flat band potential."
12,Proposed photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Proposed photocatalytic mechanism Based on Mott-Schottky’s test results, the band structure of CoP and Cu3P can be further analyzed. The band gap energies of pure CoP and Cu3P can be obtained from the literature [31,63,64], which are 1.74 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. The valence band of CoP and theconduction band of Cu3P can be obtained through the formula of EVB = ECB + Eg , whose values are 1.09 V and −0.14 V, respectively. Therefore, before and after the contact, the band positions of p-Cu3P and n-CoP are shown in Fig. 10 . Because the Fermi levels of p-type semiconductors are close to the VB, and that of n-type semiconductors are close to the CB [65]. After the contact between p-Cu3P and n-CoP, due to the existence of the potential difference, an electric field was built in the semiconductor to promote charge transfer. During the formation of the p-n heterojunction, when the Fermi levels of CoP and Cu3P reached equilibrium, the direction of this internal electric field was directed from CoP to Cu3P [66]. At the same time, the conduction band of Cu3P will increase, and the conduction band of CoP will decrease with the action of Fermi leverage until the Fermi energy levels of CoP and Cu3P reach the equilibrium [67,68], which is also confirmed from two linear regions in the Mott-Schottky of Cu-Co-2P-2 composite catalyst. Under visible light, CoP and Cu3P semiconductors absorb enough energy to generate electron-hole pairs under the action of EY sensitization. The EY molecule as a sensitizer is adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst to form a single excited state EY1* under visible light irradiation, and then undergoes a band gap conversion to form a more stable triple excited state EY3*. With TEOA as the electron donor, EY3* is reduced and quenched to form EY− with strong reducing ability. The electrons of EY− are transferred to the surface of the composite photocatalyst and participate in the reduction reaction to produce H2. At the same time, the dye molecules return to the ground state. The incompletely phosphatized MOFs framework provides a support for CoP and Cu3P produced by Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) phosphating, making dye molecules more easily adsorbed on the semiconductor surface. An interfacial electric field is formed in a p-n junction composite catalyst constructed by Cu3P and CoP, and the direction is from n-type CoP to p-type Cu3P [68]. CoP and Cu3P are excited by visible light, and electrons and holes are generated. The electrons transition from the valence band (VB) of the photocatalyst to the conduction band (CB). Then, under the action of the interface electric field, the electrons on the CB of Cu3P quickly migrate to the CB of CoP, and then participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction of reduced water. At the same time, the holes migrate from the VB of CoP, to the VB of Cu3P, and are finally consumed by TEOA molecules. It is worth mentioning that the generated EY− fluorene molecules with strong reducing ability during EY sensitization can transfer electrons to the conduction band of CoP and Cu3P, providing a rich electron source to the reaction system. In the process of photocatalytic water splitting, the pn heterojunction formed by the combination of CoP and Cu3P effectively promotes the transfer of electrons and greatly inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs, thereby significantly improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity."
13,Conclusion,"In this work, we developed a novel in-situ growth scheme to construct the Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell precursor material. The Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) core-shell precursor was treated by low-temperature phosphorization to obtain a Cu3P@CoP composite catalyst with a self-supporting structure. The composite Cu-Co-2P-2 was obtained by controlling the phosphation degree of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) precursor and adjust the ratio of Cu and Co, and Cu-Co-2P-2 composite had the highest hydrogen production activity reaching 469.95 μmol within 5 h. Experiments to control the degree of phosphation of Cu-MOFs@ZIF-9(Co) precursor material and adjust the ratio of Cu to Co showed that the photocatalyst labelled as Cu-Co-2P-2 has the highest hydrogen production activity, reaching 469.95 μmol in 5 h. The unique structure and composition of Cu3P@CoP can promote charge migration, provide large surface area and rich active sites to drive water photolysis. Cu3P@CoP composite catalyst not only had a layered structure, but also built a p-n heterojunction at the interface of Cu3P and CoP. The results of photoelectrochemical and fluorescence tests showed that the proper conduction and valence band positions of Cu3P and CoP formed a more effective path way for the thermodynamic charge transfer. The results further emphasized the importance of material design based on proper energy level locations. This work will promote the design of transition metal phosphide semiconductor devices and further development of heterojunction photocatalysts."
