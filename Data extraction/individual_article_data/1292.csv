0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels still remain as the main source of energy and have a great negative impact on health and the environment. From the energy and environmental point of view, hydrogen is the ideal source of energy because it can be transformed into heat and mechanical or electrical energy [1,2]. Currently, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, n-buthanol, etc. [3], have been considered as the main hydrogen carriers. Among them, methanol has been widely studied in recent years due to the following advantages: it is liquid at room temperature, has a high H/C ratio and low propensity for soot [4] formation, so it can be used in fuel cells for stationary and transport applications [5,6]. Steam reforming of methanol (SRM) is emerging as a promising alternative for H2 production due to its mostly positive effects on the environment. Thus, a great variety of studies about catalysts improvement have been carried out [7–12]. Several authors have found that each step in the catalyst synthesis process can affect the catalytic properties, that is, similar catalysts prepared by different synthesis methods have different physical-chemical and catalytic properties, being the copper-based catalysts and those of the groups 8–10 (Pd, Pt and Ni) that present the best performance [13]. In addition to this, different supports have been used, amidst which: Al3O2, ZnO, ZrO2 TiO2 and CeO2 stand out [14–17]. Among them, the ceria support (CeO2) has attracted attention because it has the capacity to store and release oxygen and decrease the activation energy, which makes it very attractive in hydrogen production processes [18]. Ciambelli et al. [19], evaluated the effect of the support on the activity and stability of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in ethanol reforming. They found that when the Pt is supported in ceria, the catalyst showed a better performance in the reaction and a decreased deactivation degree. This behavior was related to formation of Ce-PtOx species during the calcination step, which cause a lower degree of sintering by a strong metal-support interaction, in contrast with alumina (Al2O3) that does not present this phenomenon. In addition, the higher performance of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst in this study was associated with the its ability to release and store oxygen in the support, which prevented the formation of coke, contrary to that observed with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst where a greater degree of deactivation was observed. Besides, different studies show that cerium oxide nanostructures improve methanol conversion to H2 due to their high reactivity. According with this result, the different planes that the nanostructures (particles, cubes, octahedral, bars and wires) displayed have different reactivity, highlighting the one-dimensional structures (1D), which reveals planes that are more reactive and selective for CO oxidation and methanol conversion [20–25]. Guan et al. [26], evaluated the effect of Au nanoparticles supported on cerium oxide nanorods and nanocubes in the CO oxidation reaction. They concluded that there is a strong dependence of the catalytic activity with the planes comprising the ceria surface, and identified that nanorods exhibited the highest catalytic activity during CO oxidation associated with the {110} and {100} planes. Similar results were reported by Si et al. [25], which observed that the nanorods were better for anchoring and dispersing very fine gold clusters. Araiza et al. [27], studied methanol oxidation with Cu nanoparticles supported on nanostructured ceria with different morphologies for hydrogen production. It was observed that at constant temperature, the Cu nanocatalysts supported on ceria in the form of polyhedron and rods showed similar conversion activity, however, a lower amount of CO was produced in the first catalyst. Pérez-Hernández R. et al. [28], observed a significant catalytic activity of Ni nanoparticles supported on CeO2-NR in the oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM), with an optimum Ni content of 36 wt% supported on CeO2-NR the methanol conversion and hydrogen production increased until reaching the maximum due to the synergistic effect between the ceria nanorods and Ni particles. Finally, few studies focused on evaluating the properties of the catalysts synthesized from different precursors, however, few works concluded that the precursor salt used in the synthesis can also affect the catalytic performance [29–31]. Silvestre et al. [32], studied the effect of the chloride species in Pt-Zn/CeO2 catalysts from two Pt precursor salts: hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tetraaminplatinum nitrate (Pt (NH3)4(NO3)2), for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde in vapor phase. The presence of chloride ions improves the reducing capacity of ceria, but diminishes its effect as oxygen donor due to the possible formation of Ce-O-Cl species so that, the chlorine-free nanocatalyst (Pt (NH3)4(NO3) 2) was more active for this reaction since the release of oxygen from the surface of the support was promoted to a greater extent. Guimarães et al. [33], studied the effect of the precursor salt in Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts for propane oxidation, they used PdCl2 and Pd(acac) as Pd precursors. They concluded, that the redox processes on the surface of the support and the oxygen storage in the network depend on the precursor salt, being the precursor of acetylacetonate that markedly favored the oxygen supply provided by the ceria for the propane oxidation, because no chlorinated species were formed as in the case of the PdCl2 precursor. In this case, the chloride-containing precursor again inhibited this promotion, which was associated with the formation of PdxOyClz species, which decreases the oxygen atoms exchange capacity of the ceria network. The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of Pt precursor on CeO2-NR in the steam reforming of methanol reaction. The catalysts were studied in the steam reforming of methanol reaction to produce H2. Catalysts were characterized by BET (N2 adsorption–desorption), EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray Diffraction), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), HAADF-STEM (High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy) and TPR (Temperature- Programmed Reduction)."
1,Experimental,"The hydrothermal method [16,34,35] was used to synthesize CeO2 nanorods (NR) and the incipient impregnation procedure to deposit the Pt. Briefly, 80 mL of a 0.5 M Ce(NO3)3*6H2O (Aldrich) aqueous solution were mixed and stirred for 0.5 h with 120 mL of 10 M NaOH aqueous solution. The resulting mixture was added to a 250 mL stainless steel reactor coated with Teflon. Then, the reactor was introduced in an oven, where after reaching 100 °C was isothermally treated for 24 h. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the resulting CeO2-NR powder was separated by decantation. The powder was washed several times with distilled water until reaching pH 7, and then washed twice with ethanol. The final powder was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and subsequently calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. The CeO2-NR support was used to deposit Pt nanoparticles from three precursor salts by incipient impregnation method. Solution of tetraaminplatinum nitrate (Pt (NH3)4(NO3)2) (Aldrich) in distilled water (Type II) at pH 10, Platinum (II) acetylacetonate ((CH3-COCHCO-CH3)2Pt) (Merck) was dissolved in acetone (reactive grade) and hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6⋅6H2O) (Aldrich) was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (HPLC grade); all were used as precursors of the active phase, which added in appropriate amounts led to obtain a 0.5% (w/w) Pt concentration of each catalyst. In order to study the effect of the presence of chloride ions on the prepared sample with hexachloroplatinic acid, an aliquot of the impregnated material was washed and termed (Cl-C/L) while the unwashed one was named (Cl-S/L), respectively. All samples were dried at 160 °C for 3 h and calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. The obtained Pt/CeO2-NR catalysts were identified in terms of the precursor salt as Pt/CeO2-NR (X), where X represents an abbreviation of the precursor, being as follows: Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit), Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac), Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-C/L) and Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-S/L). It is important to mention that before characterization, all samples had a reduction treatment at 250 °C for 1 h using a flow of H2 5% in Ar (40 mL min−1), except for the TPR analyzes. The XRD patterns were acquired in a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA. The SEM images were recorded on a FESEM/JEOL JSM7800FEG. The samples were attached to a double-sided carbon conductive tape on an aluminum holder and coated with gold. For the HAADF- STEM observations were conducted in a TEM JEOL JEM-2010 FEG microscope operated at 200 kV. High-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF) is an STEM technique which produces an annular dark field image formed by very high angle of scattered electrons with the nucleus of the atoms (Rutherford scattered). This technique is very sensitive to variations in the atomic number of atoms in the sample and the image so taken is called Z-contrast image. The Pt/CeO2-NR (X) samples were dispersed in ethanol, dropped onto a carbon-film-coated copper grid, and dried in air. The Brunnauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET) was used to determine the specific surface area of the support and all the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts, by adsorption/desorption of N2 at 77 K, using a Bel-Sorp mini II, Bel Japan. The programmed temperature reduction (TPR) analysis were performed using a chemisorption equipment Belcat-B from Bel Japan equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The catalytic performance of the Pt/CeO2-NR (X) catalysts were evaluated in the steam reforming of methanol (SRM) reaction, using a commercial RIG-100-ISRI system in a temperature range from 200 to 450 °C at atmospheric pressure. 0.1 g of catalyst was placed in the fixed-bed quartz reactor and a thermocouple was inserted to control the temperature inside it. Before the catalytic test, the catalyst was activated in 5%H2/He (60 mL min−1) from room temperature to 250 °C for 1 h. The reaction products were analyzed using a Gow-Mac 580 gas chromatograph equipment equipped with a dual-column system (5 Å molecular sieve and Porapak Q), double injector controlled by Clarity software V.7.2.0.73 and a TCD. The first column was used to separate products such as H2, O2, CH4 and CO, while the second column allowed the separation of H2O, CH3OH and CO2. The resulting data were collected during 7 h at each temperature in order to elucidate a reaction steady state. Also, the products from the reactor (RIG-100) of the SRM reaction, were monitored on the real-time from 200 to 450 °C by MS using a BELMass benchtop type quadrupole mass spectrometer. The following equations were used to determine the methanol conversion (X) and selectivity (SH2).

2,Results and discussion,"The textural properties of raw CeO2-NR and Pt/CeO2-NR(X) catalysts are presented in Table 1 . It is seen that the CeO2-NR and Pt/CeO2-NR(X) catalysts show a high surface area ca. 90 m2 g−1 as reported previously [36]. These values were superior to that reported by some authors such as Zhou et al. [21], and Wattanathana et al. [37], reported surface areas near 50 m2 g−1. After the impregnation of the active phase, a slight increase in surface area was observed that was associated to the rupture of the nanorods, except for the Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-S/L) sample, in which a decrease in the surface area was observed, caused by the presence of chlorinated species of platinum (PtxClyOz) [38]. Fig. 1 shows all diffraction patterns of the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts and CeO2-NR support. All the prepared samples showed a cubic structure of the fluorite phase of the CeO2 (PDF 01-081-0792). The diffraction peaks centered on 28.5, 33.12, 47.48, 56.32, 59.16, 69.37, 76.85, 79.06 and 88.50°, 2θ are associated with the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 0) and (4 2 2) planes of the CeO2 respectively [22,39,40]. In Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts, no diffraction peaks associated with the presence of Pt or PtOx were observed, this finding was associated with low Pt concentrations on all catalysts. Some authors associate the absence of these peaks to a small particle size (less than 5 nm) and consequently a high platinum dispersion on the support, suggesting a strong interaction between the metal and the support, which helps to avoid metal sintering [19,41]. After catalytic test, no changes were observed in the XRD patterns of the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts. This finding evidences that the active phase is very stable on these catalysts and it was not modified by the stream of the reaction. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of the raw CeO2-NR and the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts. The raw CeO2-NR showed a reduction peak in the range of 250–500 °C, attributed to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ species [15,28,42,43]. The hydrogen consumption on the Pt/CeO2-NR(Acac) catalyst, showed a single reduction peak centered at 151 °C, which could be associated with the reduction of the PtOx to Pt0, indicating that Pt-oxide is reduced in a single step. However, the partial reduction of the support from Ce4+ to Ce3+, cannot be ruled out due to presence of the noble metal on the surface of the support. TPR profile of the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) sample, showed two reduction peaks at 152 °C and a shoulder at 166 °C respectively; the first one is associated with the reduction of the PtOx to Pt0 species, while the shoulder is associated with the reduction of Ce-PtOx species, which have an intimate interaction between the Pt and the CeO2-NR producing the known spillover effect linked to an increase in H2 consumption, which reflects that the nitrate salt of tetraaminplatinum promoted the formation of Ce-Ptx species [44,45]. The TPR profiles of the catalysts synthesized with hexachloroplatinic acid (Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-C/L) and Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-S/L)), show a shift in the reduction peaks to higher temperatures compared with other catalysts. This finding indicates that the interaction of the Pt oxide phase on the support is different at the others Pt-precursors used in this work and, probably linked to the nature of the surface platinum oxides (chloride-containing and chloride-free) generated from the calcination of the chloroplatinic precursor adsorbed on the support, which causes an increase in the reduction temperature of the Pt [32,46,47]. In the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-C/L) catalyst, two reduction peaks were observed at 168 °C and 203 °C respectively. The first one can be associated with the reduction of PtOx species to Pt0, and the second H2 consumption peak could be associated with the reduction of the metal through a strong interaction with the support forming the Ce-PtOx species [19,48]. The TPR profile of the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-S/L) catalyst, showed three reduction peaks at 156, 186 and 204 °C respectively. The peaks centered at 156 and 204 °C are comparable to those obtained for the Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-C/L) catalyst. While the reduction peak centered at 186 °C, was associated with the reduction of some PtxClyOz species [29]. Jeong et al. [48] observed that the calcination temperature had a significant effect in the PtOx to Ce-PtOx species conversion percentage on the surface of the catalysts between 400 and 500 °C. The same phenomenon could take place in our catalysts, because the calcination temperature in this work was 500 °C. The morphology of the CeO2-NR support, before the impregnation of the active phase, is shown in Fig. 3 . The cerium oxide has needlelike morphology with 100–200 nm length and approximately 10 nm width. Fig. 4 a) shows the HAADF-STEM image of the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) and Fig. 4b) Pt/CeO2-NR(Acac) catalysts, respectively. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), depends on the atomic numbers of the elements (Z contrast), in many cases, the stronger signal is observed for the heavier element [49]. The difference between the atomic number of Pt (78) and Ce (58) makes it possible to observe nanoparticles of Pt of 1 nm in size on the CeO2 surface with a notable differences in the contrast of the dark field image and indicated by arrows on the Fig. 4. The HAADF technique is more suitable than conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to detect metal nanoparticles with atomic number high and high dispersion. Nanoparticles of 1 nm or less in diameter supported on crystalline oxides [50]. On both samples, the platinum was found on the CeO2-NR surface in the form of nanoparticles with a size of about 1 nm. In the Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) nanocatalyst (Fig. 4a), the Pt nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the matrix than Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac) (Fig. 4b). This homogeneous Pt distribution on the surface of this catalyst can be explained based on the properties of the solvent used (water) for the Pt impregnation. Conversely, in the Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac) nanocatalyst (Fig. 4b), the distribution was not uniform, that is, the Pt nanoparticles are in a small region of the support. This distribution is because acetone was used to deposit the Pt-Acac on the support, solvent that evaporated quicker than the water; as a result of this, the Pt dispersed more homogeneously over CeO2-NR in the first sample (Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit)). A DRIFTS investigation was carried out to observe the CO adsorbed on the Pt-supported catalysts (Fig. 5 ). The DRIFT spectrum of the CeO2-NR was included for comparison, this sample, showed bands at lower frequency in the range of 1700-1000 cm−1 attributed with formation of a carbonate species over CeO2-NR surface. For the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) catalysts, the DRIFT spectra exhibited bands at lower frequency, like in CeO2-NR. In addition, new bands at 2070, 2083 and shoulder at 2103 cm−1 emerged. It is clear that the band ca. 2103 cm−1 vanished for the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) and it is very low for the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-L), on the other samples it remained. This new bands are associated with the CO adsorption on Pt. The linearly adsorbed CO was reported at 2076 over Pt on the Pt/CeO2 [51]. Olsen and Masel [52], observed that the linear CO band adsorbed on Pt shifted from 2084 to 2094 cm−1 respectively with increasing coverage. A broad tail towards lower wave numbers contains different components, near 2010 and 1960 cm−1 characterized by different Pt surface coordination [53]. On Pt/Zr(rich)TiOx catalyst a broad band was reported, with a maximum at 2065 cm−1, plus two shoulders ca. 2080 cm−1 and 2020 cm−1 frequency respectively. The maximum at 2065 cm−1 was assigned to the CO linearly bonded to metallic platinum atoms located on high-index crystal faces, the others at high and low frequency shoulders were associated with adsorption on metallic sites with high or low unsaturated coordination, respectively [52]. The above-mentioned results clearly indicate that the top surface of the Pt preferably adsorbs the linear CO band. Temperature dependences of methanol conversion of the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . The catalytic behavior of CeO2-NR support was included for comparison. Clearly, it can be observed that the raw CeO2-NR had low methanol conversion at all reaction temperatures, reaching a maximum of 20% at 450 °C. When Pt was deposited on the CeO2-NR, the catalytic activity increased significantly. The methanol conversion at 200 °C on Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-C/L) and Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) samples is slightly higher than other samples synthesized in this study. When the reaction temperature was increased at 300 °C, the methanol conversion was 79% on the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) catalyst, while for the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-S/L), Pt/CeO2-NR(Acac) and Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-C/L) samples, conversions were 71%, 67% and 61%, respectively. The complete conversion is reached at about 350 °C and it remain constant up to 450 °C. In this study, the catalytic behavior of the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) nanocatalysts as a function of the precursor salt, showed that the catalytic materials synthesized from the chlorine-containing salt are less active than the chlorine-free catalysts. This behavior suggests that the sample with chlorine on the surface of the catalyst inhibit the adsorption of the reactants to carry out the catalytic reaction, indicating that the redox mechanism in the nanocatalyst is also inhibited in the reaction. These results are in agreement with that reported in the literature by Silvestre et al. [32], and Guimarães et al. [33], that is, a slightly higher methanol conversion was observed using the chlorine-free nanocatalysts. This indicates, that the redox process is carried out efficiently on the surface of the Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac) and Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) nanocatalysts, with respect to the catalytic materials prepared with the chlorine-containing precursor salt. This result was corroborated with the TPR results, in which a high reduction degree in the nanocatalysts was observed, when they were synthesized from the precursor salt that does not contain chlorine. Additionally, a better Pt dispersion on the Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) nanocatalyst observed by the HAADF-STEM technique, could be favored the redox process during the catalytic reaction improving the methanol conversion. During the methanol reforming reaction, the main products observed in this study were: hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane traces. Fig. 7 , shows the H2 yield (calculated according with Eq. 2) of Pt/CeO2-NR(X) catalysts. H2 distribution of Pt catalysts are slightly similar at the methanol conversion. At the beginning of the reaction, the hydrogen production on the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-S/L) sample was 19% and 13% for Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) catalyst. At 300 °C, the last sample reached 63% of H2 yield while the only 50% was for the Pt/CeO2-NR(Cl-S/L) catalyst. When the temperature reached 350 °C, the slightly highest yield was obtained for the Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) catalyst. At the maximum reaction temperature all the catalysts presented the same H2 production. Fig. 8 shows the CO and CO2 selectivity on the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) samples as a function of the precursor salt and the reaction temperature. It is observed that the selectivity towards CO2 increases considerably after 300 °C while, the CO decrease proportionally. In the range of 350 and 400 °C, in which 100% of methanol conversion is obtained. The CO selectivity was less than 2% for all catalysts. The WGS (Eq. 4) reaction can be responsible for the low CO selectivity. In addition, in the Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) nanocatalyst in the tetraaminplatinum nitrate salt the redox process could favored, releasing oxygen from the support to oxidize CO [13]. (4) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Barrios et al. [50], found that at temperatures above 400 °C the RWGS reaction can be carried out on the surface of the ceria, suggesting that the CeO2-NR support can effectively modulate the selectivity towards CO2 under reaction conditions. Fig. 9 shows the time on stream of methanol reforming in order to estimate the stability of the Pt/CeO2-NR(X) catalysts at 350 °C for 24 h. It can be seen that all the catalytic materials were very stable in their catalytic properties. No significant deactivation was observed in the period of time evaluated. The selectivity towards H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 was practically similar for all the catalysts. It should be noted that the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) catalyst showed a greater selectivity to the CO2 production reaction, compared with the other three catalysts tested. This behavior could be associated again with the greater oxygen contribution of the support improving the redox process due to the absence of chlorinated compounds, as well as the more homogeneous dispersion of Pt particles due to the solvent used during the impregnation process. A similar result was obtained by Ciambelli et al. [19] which compared the catalytic stability of the Pt/Al3O2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts, respectively, in the ethanol reforming, since they also observed a high stability over time for the Pt/CeO2 sample. This result was associated it with a high selectivity towards the WGS reaction and the great ability of the ceria to oxidize the coke on the catalyst surface. Based on all results and on the literature, we conclude that the Cl-free catalysts, favor the redox process and improve the platinum dispersion on the ceria nanorods. The Steam Reforming of Methanol reaction was followed by mass spectrometry (MS). The sample was taken immediately at the reactor outlet as a means of enabling real-time analysis of catalytic reaction. Fig. 10 shows the CH3OH, H2, CO2, CO and CH4 signals monitored by MS of the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) catalyst. The outlet methanol signal profile showed a decrease and raise in other gases as a function of the reaction temperature. This behavior is in agreement with the methanol conversion and selectivity as was reported above, suggesting that the catalyst is stable during the reaction, because no further changes in the outlet signals on the real-time monitoring analysis by MS was observed. So, if there were any intermediates during the reaction, they could be released to the effluent and it could be determined by MS, these species can furnish valuable insights into a catalytic process."
3,Conclusions,"In this study it was shown the effect of the Pt precursor salt in the catalytic properties of the Pt/CeO2-NR nanocatalysts on the steam reforming of methanol reaction for hydrogen production. The Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) nanocatalyst synthesized from the tetraaminplatinum nitrate salt (Pt (NH3)4(NO3)2) presented a higher yield towards the H2 and a higher methanol conversion than other Pt-precursor salt catalysts. The order of activity for the steam reforming of methanol reaction was: Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit)> Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac)> Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-S/L)> Pt/CeO2-NR (Cl-C/L). The best performance of the Pt/CeO2-NR(Nit) nanocatalyst with respect to the other samples studied in this work, can be associated with a better redox process, a better Pt dispersion on the surface of CeO2-NR, which promote the WGS reaction at moderate temperatures. Pt nanoparticles were identified by using the HAADF-STEM mode, on both Pt/CeO2-NR (Nit) and Pt/CeO2-NR (Acac) samples respectively. This technique, confirms the dispersion of the active phase on the matrix with Pt particle size ca. 1 nm. Moreover, the lower performance of the catalysts synthesized from the salt containing chlorine, is associated with electronic effects, because chlorine delays and hinders the electronic exchange between the metal and the support. In addition, the formation of oxy-chlorinated species PtxOyClz inhibited the ceria promoting effect, restricting the CO oxidation. Based on the above, the catalytic and surface properties of the catalysts are influenced by the precursor salt used as source of active phase, increasing or decreasing the exposed surface area and modifying the properties of the support, by inhibiting or increasing its oxygen release and storage property. High stability of the catalysts during the reaction was observed in all samples and confirmed by MS technique, because no further changes in the outlet signals on the real-time monitoring analysis by MS was observed."
