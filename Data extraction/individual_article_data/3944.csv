0,Introduction,"Biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is produced mainly from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Although bio-oil is one of the most promising clean and renewable energy resources as a replacement for fossil fuel, it has undesirable properties such as high moisture content, high oxygen content, high acid value, low heating value, and high reactivity caused by the presence of oxygenated and unsaturated compounds [1,2]. Aldehydes and phenolic species tend to polymerize easily and increase oil viscosity. The high moisture content and oxygenated compounds result in low heating values and immiscibility with conventional fossil fuels. The highly acidic compounds result in thermally unstable and highly corrosive oil [3]. Therefore, the upgrading of bio-oil to oil with lower oxygen content and acidic species is required in order to improve its storage stability and, thus, suitability as a viable fossil-fuel replacement. Bio-oil upgrading techniques such as emulsification, catalytic cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, steam reforming, and catalytic deoxygenation have been reported [2,4]. Catalytic deoxygenation can upgrade bio-oil by reducing oxygen content via several chemical reactions including decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and hydrodeoxygenation. Nickel catalysts usually have been adopted to upgrade bio-oil but can be eroded with decreased catalytic activity in the presence of acetic acids. Alternatively, some noble metal catalysts with good acid resistance have been screened for upgrading of bio-oil, but carry the disadvantage of high price. For improved catalytic performance of nickel catalysts, specifically their dispersion and basicity, the addition of alkali earth metal has been studied. Additionally, activated charcoal has been employed as a supporting material to prevent pore blockage by coke formation or bio-oil macromolecules [2,5]. Another route for bio-oil upgrading is removal of organic acids by esterification with alcohol and an acid catalyst. Decreased acidity and viscosity can enhance bio-oil quality. Recently, esterification under supercritical fluids such as water, methanol or ethanol for removal of organic acids in bio-oil with or without catalysts has been intensively researched due to the supercritical fluid system’s unique properties including faster rates of mass and heat transfer, liquid-like density and dissolving power, and gas-like diffusivity and viscosity [5–8]. In supercritical ethanol, ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids in bio-oil and produces the corresponding esters by esterification, even without catalysts. Supercritical ethanol acts as an effective reactant medium by reducing the viscosity of bio-oil. Ethanol also can produce hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals for reaction with bio-oil in the supercritical state [2,9,10]. In addition to alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, other solvents such as ketones, aldehydes, and acids can be used as supercritical fluids for bio-oil upgrading. However, such studies are rare. In the present study, the reaction behaviors of several solvents (alcohols and acid) under supercritical conditions were investigated with and without a MgNiMo/AC catalyst. Also, the properties of bio-oil after supercritical fluid reactions with catalysts were analyzed. The changes in the compositions, hydrogen production and oxygen contents of the bio-oils according to the solvents used were investigated."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Bio-oil obtained from fast wood pyrolysis at 460 °C was used as the reaction feedstock. Alcohols (methanol, 99.8%; ethanol, 99.9%; butanol, 99.5%; hexane, 99.0%) and formic acid (99%) for use as supercritical solvents were supplied by OCI. Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.999%), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·5H2O, 81.0–83.0%), and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Activated charcoal (AC; SBET = 687.9 m2/g, Vp = 0.56 cm3/g, dp = 3.25 nm) also was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. The AC was washed several times with distilled water to remove contaminants; after cleaning, was dried and sieved to between 0.50 and 0.85 mm."
3,Preparation and characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of catalysts Activated charcoal (AC)-supported catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method, 25 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Mo, and 2 wt% Mg having been impregnated on AC in consecutive order. The AC-supported catalysts were dried at 100 °C for 12 h, calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in N2 flow of 100 cm3/min, and reduced at 400 °C for 8 h in H2 flow of 100 cm3/min [5]. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to clarify the crystalline phase formation of catalysts on a DMAX-2500 spectrometer (Rigaku), equipped with a monochromator using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.1542 nm) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The analysis was conducted between 10 and 90° in 2 θ ranges with a scanning rate of 5 °/min. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface area and porosity of catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at -196 °C in ASAP 2420 (Micromeritics Ltd.). The SEM images were acquired with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4700, Hitachi) at 20 kV."
4,Supercritical reaction procedure,"2.3 Supercritical reaction procedure An autoclave reactor of 200 mL capacity was used for the reactions. The reactor was heated with an electric heating system, and the temperature was measured with a thermocouple. A total amount of 100 g of solvent or bio-oil/solvent mixture was fed into the reactor. As a single solvent, ethanol, methanol, butanol, hexanol or formic acid was used to observe hydrogen production and composition changes. As mixtures, the ratios of ethanol to formic acid and ethanol to methanol were 7:3 (w/w). The conditions chosen for the reactions in this study were based on previous experiments performed under various conditions of ratio of bio-oil to solvent, reaction temperature, and reaction time [5]. In the bio-oil upgrading, the ratio of bio-oil to solvent was 2:8 (w/w). The reaction was performed at 340 °C under an initial nitrogen gas pressure of 30 bar, the mixture being stirred at a rate of 500 rpm for 1 or 2 h and then cooled to room temperature by water circulation. Inactive nitrogen gas was initially injected to the reactor to increase the solubility of the hydrogen gas produced from the solvents and then to enhance the mass transfer among liquid bio-oil, solid catalyst, and hydrogen gas. To enhance the efficiency of deoxygenation, a catalyst, MgNiMo/AC (SBET = 518.4 m2/g) of 1, 2, or 4 wt% of total supercritical fluid was used. All gas, liquid, and solid products were collected from the reactor for analysis."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The analyses of bio-oil and all liquid products after supercritical reaction were performed on an Agilent GC 7890A gas chromatograph (HP-5 column, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.2 um) equipped with a mass spectrometer (5975C). The carrier gas was He of 99.999% purity. The oven temperature was ramped from 45 to 250 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. The compounds were identified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NITS) Mass Spectral Library. The analyses of gas products were performed by Agilent GC, with a TCD (Carboxen 1000 column) for H2, CO, CO2, and CH4, and with a FID (Carboxen 1000 column) for C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8. The acid values of the bio-oil and liquid products were measured with a TL 7000 (SI Analytics). The moisture contents of the bio-oil and liquid products were determined by a Karl Fischer titration method using a V20 Volumetric KF Titrator (Mettler Toledo). The elemental analyses were performed with a FLASH 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen contents were determined from the combustion products (carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, and oxides of nitrogen) of samples. The higher heating value (HHV) was calculated according to the DIN 51900 standard. An HPLC system (Shimadzu), incorporating a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H analytical column (300 mm × 7.8 mm) and a Cation H microguard cartridge (30 mm × 4.6 mm) (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used for acetic acid and formic acid measurement. The column was maintained at 60 °C with 5 mmol/L H2SO4 eluent (0.6 mL/min), and the peaks were detected by a RI detector (Shimadzu)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of bio-oil,"3.1 Characterization of bio-oil After the fast wood pyrolysis process, bio-oil was naturally separated into two phases: upper (light oil) and lower (heavy oil). The properties of the two phases are summarized in Table 1 . The upper phase showed a very high moisture content of 63.3 wt%, and the lower phase also showed a high moisture content, 14.3 wt%. The acid values of the two phases were both very high. The oxygen content of the upper phase was 62.5 wt% because of the high moisture content, effected by oxygen-containing water molecules. As a result, the HHV of the upper phase was very low. The compositions of the two bio-oil phases are summarized in Table 2 . Heavy oil (the lower phase) contained high amounts of phenolic species originated from lignin. Light oil (the upper phase) contained 24.3 area% of levoglucosan as a sugar among 48.1 area% of the others. In chemical industries, levoglucosan is an attractive chemical that can be used for synthesis of pesticides, growth regulators, macrolide antibiotics, and others [11]. Wang [11] obtained the optimal pyrolysis conditions to maximize the levoglucosan yield from cotton straw. Because bio-oil contains high amounts of water, vacuum evaporation to remove oxygen was conducted, and the condensate and distillate properties were analyzed (Table 3 ). After evaporation of the two bio-oil phases, there were decreases in oxygen content because of the decrease in moisture content and in acid value because of the removal of acetic acid and formic acid. Also, the HHV increased because of the removal of water. The concentrations of acetic acid and formic acid in the distillate were 3.0 and 2.2 wt%, respectively, in light oil and 0.16 and 0.15 wt%, respectively, in heavy oil. Acetic acid and formic acid can be used as base materials for synthesis of other chemicals. After oxygen-content reduction and HHV increase via evaporation, additional bio-oil-property improvement is required for biofuel viability."
8,Behavior of ethanol by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions,"3.2 Behavior of ethanol by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions The MgNiMo/AC catalyst was employed in the experiments because it has shown good performance in deoxygenation of bio-tar [5]. Ni and bimetallic NiMo have been widely used for upgrading of bio-oil, particularly by hydrodeoxygenation chemistry. The addition of Mo as a promoter benefits Ni species uniformity [12,13]. Ni can be also used for hydrogen production by alcohol dry reforming [14]. When Mg was additionally impregnated on NiMo/AC, coke formation during the upgrading reaction decreased. Because organic acids such as acetic acid in bio-oil enhance the formation of coke, the alkalinity of Mg helped to lower the acidity of bio-oil and then suppressed coke formation. The enhancement of metal dispersion was also observed, in comparison with NiMo/AC without Mg [5]. Fig. 1 shows the structure of activated charcoal, Ni/AC, NiMo/AC, and MgNiMo/AC. BET surface area gradually decreased when Ni and NiMo were impregnated on AC; but the BET surface area increased with additional impregnation of Mg [5]. The prepared catalyst had a BET surface area of 518.4 m2/g, a total pore volume of 0.45 cm3/g, and an average pore diameter of 3.51 nm. Ethanol is a representative solvent for supercritical upgrading of bio-oil, and the behavior of supercritical ethanol under the MgNiMo/AC catalyst was examined. Liquid, gas, and a few solids were produced by the reaction. Gases such as hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide were mainly produced by ethanol decomposition under the supercritical conditions (Fig. 2 ) [14–17]. (1) C 2 H 5 OH → CO + CH 4 + H 2 (2) C 2 H 5 OH → CO 2 + CH 4 In the supercritical ethanol with catalyst, the order of gases in terms of amount produced was H2 > CH4 > CO > CO2 > C2H6 > C3H8 (Fig. 2). When the dosage of the catalyst was increased to 2 and 4 wt%, the production of hydrogen was increased 2.5 and 3.6 times, respectively. Pressure increases in the reaction, specifically because of gas production, were 0.1, 19.0, and 32.3 bar for the 0, 2, and 4 wt% catalysts, respectively. Produced hydrogen is expected to be utilized for hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. Liquid compositions (area%) were plotted with corresponding catalyst dosages (Fig. 3 ) and 20 area% of ester (ethyl propanoate and propyl acetate) was produced without any catalyst. When the MgNiMO/AC catalyst was used, alcohols with an even carbon number such as butanol, hexanol, and octanol were produced with greater production of hexanol than butanol or octanol. Additionally, aldehyde, ether, and ketone were produced. Tsuchida [18] and Tseng [19] produced butanol from ethanol through catalytic reactions. During this process, other chemicals such as aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, and ether also were produced by various reaction mechanisms [18,19]. (3) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 CHO + H 2 (4) C 2 H 5 OH + CH 3 CHO → CH 3 COOC 2 H 5 + H 2 (5) 2 C 2 H 5 OH → C 2 H 5 OC 2 H 5 + H 2 O (6) 2 C 2 H 5 OH → C 4 H 9 OH + H 2 O (7) C 2 H 5 OH + C 4 H 9 OH → C 6 H 13 OH + H 2 O (8) C 2 H 4 + CO + H 2 O → C 2 H 5 COOH"
9,Behavior of alcohols by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions,"3.3 Behavior of alcohols by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions Alcohols with carbon numbers of 1, 2, 4, and 6 were each used as supercritical solvents with the MgNiMo/AC catalyst, and their behaviors were examined. Liquid, gas, and a few solids were produced by the reaction. Alcohol decomposition under the supercritical conditions mainly produced gases such as hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (Fig. 4 ) [20–23]. For ethanol, methane was the major component except for hydrogen. For the other alcohols, carbon monoxide was the major component except for hydrogen. The pressure increases by the reaction were 56.0, 32.3, 24.5, and 20.8 bar, respectively, for the alcohols with carbon numbers of 1, 2, 4, and 6. (9) CH 3 OH → CO + 2 H 2 (10) C 2 H 5 OH → CO + CH 4 + H 2 (11) C 4 H 9 OH → CO + C 3 H 8 + H 2 Butanol showed the lowest hydrogen production and also the highest C3H8 production, as determined by Eq. (11). Teply [24] compared hydrogen formations from methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, and hexanol by radiolysis of alcohols and determined that the order of hydrogen yield was pentanol > ethanol > methanol > propanol > hexanol > butanol. This study also showed that the hydrogen production yield of butanol was lower than that of hexanol (Fig. 4). The liquid compositions (area%) with alcohols were plotted (Fig. 5 ). Methanol disappeared completely, having been converted to mainly ester (ethyl propanoate and propyl acetate) and ethanol under the MgNiMo/AC catalyst (Fig. 5(a)). Ethanol, in turn, was converted to mainly hexanol, butanol, and octanol (Fig. 5(b)). From butanol, some hexanol was produced (Fig. 5(c)). Hexanol was more stable than the lower-carbon-number alcohols with 67 area% remaining after the reaction (Fig. 5(d)). For both butanol and hexanol, small amounts of hydrocarbon were produced: 3-methyl-heptane and 3-methyl-3-heptene (C8), and 5-methyl-undecane and 5-methyl-5-undecene (C12), respectively."
10,Behavior of methanol and formic acid by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions,"3.4 Behavior of methanol and formic acid by MgNiMo/AC catalyst under supercritical conditions Among the alcohols, the short-chain alcohol methanol showed good reactivity, producing hydrogen under the supercritical conditions. Formic acid, a short-chain carboxylic acid, is known to easily produce hydrogen, even at low temperature; and, as such, it is considered to offer a promising route to hydrogen production [25]. (12) HCOOH → CO 2 + 2 H 2 However, when methanol and formic acid were used as supercritical solvents at 340 °C, the pressure increased very rapidly to over 300 bar before the temperature reached 340 °C. Because the use of methanol or formic acid as a single solvent was not suitable for a batch reactor with a maximum pressure limit of 350 bar, these solvents were mixed with stable ethanol at the ratio of 3:7 (w/w) to enable the supercritical reaction at 340 °C. The pressures of ethanol, methanol, and formic acid at 340 °C with MgNiMo/Ac catalyst increased to 203.5, 345.5, and 330.0 bar, respectively. The pressure ranges of mixtures of the solvents with ethanol were within 200 ∼ 300 bar. Next, hydrogen production from mixtures of ethanol-formic acid (9:1, 8:2, and 7:3; w/w) under the 1 wt% MgNiMo/AC catalyst was examined. When the amount of formic acid was increased, hydrogen production also increased (Fig. 6 (a)). In the supercritical reaction of ethanol, 0.10, 0.26, and 0.37*10−5 mol of hydrogen was produced with 0, 2, and 4 wt% of catalyst, respectively. In supercritical ethanol-formic acid at various ratios (9:1, 8:2, and 7:3; w/w), 0.32, 0.44, and 0.47*10−5 mol of hydrogen, respectively, was produced with 1 wt% catalyst. Hydrogen production at the 8:2 and 7:3 (w/w) ratios of ethanol-formic acid mixtures with the 1 wt% catalyst concentration was higher than that at the 4 wt% catalyst concentration with ethanol. The carbon dioxide content also increased with the formic acid dosage because hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced during the decomposition of formic acid. Among the three formic acid ratios, the liquid compositions were similar because the decomposition of formic acid was a unique major reaction (Fig. 7 (a)). In the supercritical ethanol-methanol reaction (7:3, w/w), an increase of hydrogen was observed when the temperature was increased from 300 to 340 °C and the catalyst dosage was increased from 1 to 2 wt% (Fig. 6(b)). In the supercritical ethanol-methanol (7:3, w/w) conditions, 0.35 and 0.41*10−5 mol of hydrogen was produced with 1 and 2 wt% of catalyst at 340 °C, respectively. At the 2 wt% catalyst concentration with an ethanol-methanol mixture (7:3, w/w), the amount of produced hydrogen was similar to that for ethanol with the 4 wt% catalyst. The mixtures of methanol and formic acid with ethanol showed high hydrogen production at low catalyst dosage. The dehydrogenation of methanol and formic acid with one carbon was better facilitated than that of ethanol with 2 carbons. During methanol decomposition, mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced, and during ethanol decomposition, mainly hydrogen and methane are produced; accordingly, production of those gases was observed in the present experimentation. At 300 °C, production of long-chain alcohol with carbon numbers over 3 was not observed; however, at 340 °C, production of long-chain alcohol with carbon numbers over 3 including propanol, butanol, pentanol, and hexanol from mixtures of ethanol-methanol was initiated, and the amounts increased with the catalyst dosage (Fig. 7(b))."
11,Catalytic upgrading of bio-oil under supercritical ethanol-formic acid and ethanol-methanol,"3.5 Catalytic upgrading of bio-oil under supercritical ethanol-formic acid and ethanol-methanol During the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil, various oxygen-removal reactions occur: cracking, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrocracking, hydrodeoxygenation, and hydrogenation [26]. In the present study, supercritical ethanol, methanol, and formic acid were used to facilitate deoxygenation of bio-oil without any additional hydrogen supply. The hydrogen amount after the supercritical upgrading process under the ratio of bio-oil (heavy oil) to solvent of 2:8 (w/w) at 340 °C for 1 h was investigated (Fig. 8 (a)). During the supercritical reaction, hydrogen was produced from solvents and simultaneously consumed through reaction with the bio-oil. The residual hydrogen with the 2 wt% catalyst decreased because of its use in upgrading of the bio-oil. For the 4 wt% catalyst, the residual hydrogen content was higher because its initial hydrogen production was greater at the higher catalyst amount. The oxygen content of the bio-oils decreased from the initial 33.9 wt% after 1 h by the supercritical reaction (Fig. 8(b)) with the oxygen content gradually decreasing in accordance with catalyst dosage. Although the addition of formic acid and methanol enhanced hydrogen production, the oxygen content after the supercritical reaction for the three cases was not notably different. Therefore, additional development of deoxygenation catalysts and new reactor designs are needed for more efficient interaction of bio-oil and hydrogen. The properties of upgraded bio-oil after running the experiments for 2 h at 340 °C are shown in Table 4 . The moisture content of bio-oil decreased from 14.3 to 2.0 ∼ 2.6 wt% after the supercritical reaction. During the reaction, water was produced through ethanol decomposition and hydrodeoxygenation, but it was also consumed by steam reforming and the water–gas shift reaction. It was reported that Ni catalyst can perform steam reforming and water–gas shift reaction in the low temperature range [27,28]. Through the production and consumption of water during the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil, the water content of upgraded bio-oil eventually decreased to 2.0 ∼ 2.6%. When the reaction time was increased from 1 to 2 h, the oxygen content decreased from 17.3 to 14.6% in ethanol, 18.4 to 16.0% in ethanol-formic acid, and 17.7 to 14.7% in ethanol-methanol. Also, the HHV was further increased to 35.3 MJ/kg in ethanol, to 34.4 MJ/kg in ethanol-formic acid, and to 35.3 MJ/kg in ethanol-methanol. The yields of the upgraded bio-oils were 87.6, 72.0, and 78.4 wt%, respectively. As indicated here, the bio-oil yield in ethanol was the highest. The yields of solid species including coke were 4.5, 6.5, and 2.6 wt%, respectively. After the supercritical reaction, both ether and ketone were increased in each of the ethanol and ethanol-methanol cases. With ethanol-formic acid, phenolic species increased (Fig. 9 ). The reaction mechanisms of bio-oil with solvents were found to be very complicated. Ketone can be produced by ketonization of carboxylic acid and ether can be produced by dehydration of alcohol [29–31]. As a result of the bio-oil upgrading with the decrease in oxygen content, phenol with an alkoxy group containing additional oxygen decreased while phenol with an alkyl group increased; however, the hydrogen amount produced by the supercritical reaction from solvents on MgNiMo/AC was not sufficient to remove the OH group from phenol. Through additional injection of hydrogen gas, phenolic species can be converted to benzene, alkyl benzene, or cyclohexane [32]. The main mechanism of catalytic upgrading of bio-oil in the present study was that alkoxy phenol was converted to alkyl phenol by hydrodeoxygenation with hydrogen produced from solvent on MgNiMo/AC and the oxygen content being decreased. Additionally a different mechanism was also observed. Ethyl group originated from ethanol was attached on the ring of alkoxy phenol. This reaction also decreased the oxygen content by increasing the entire molecular weight. For formic acid, the main occurrence was the production of alkyl phenol by hydrodeoxygenation of alkoxy phenol with hydrogen produced from formic acid. XRD spectra of catalysts before and after supercritical reaction (Fig. 10 ) show that the Ni peak was similar in both fresh and spent catalysts, but the intensity slightly decreased after the reaction. Graphite may form by the reaction of Ni and amorphous carbon [33], but this was not observed in the present study. The broad peak of 2 θ = 15–30° observed in fresh activated charcoal was also observed in the spent catalyst, which means that the carbon produced from the catalytic reaction of bio-oil was partially covered on the MgNiMo/AC catalyst. Therefore, as shown by other studies of catalytic upgrading of bio-oil, catalytic activity is expected to decrease through catalytic deactivation such as coking, sintering, poisoning, and metal deposition [34]."
12,Conclusions,"Biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) of high oxygen content, high acid value, high moisture content, and low heating value was upgraded by means of a catalytic supercritical fluid reaction. With an MgNiMo/AC catalyst, methanol and formic acid showed high hydrogen production. When the catalyst dosage and temperature were increased, the production of hydrogen increased. Through catalytic upgrading of bio-oil under supercritical conditions, the oxygen and water content were decreased and the HHV was increased. During the supercritical ethanol reaction at 340 °C under an initial 30 bar of N2 gas for 2 h, the oxygen content was decreased from 33.9 to 14.6 wt% and the HHV was increased from 25.2 to 35.3 MJ/kg. For potential use of upgraded bio-oil as a biofuel, the oxygen content needs to be lowered further. Therefore, the development of novel deoxygenation catalysts and reactor designs are required for more efficient interaction of bio-oil and hydrogen and, thereby, further minimization of oxygen content."
