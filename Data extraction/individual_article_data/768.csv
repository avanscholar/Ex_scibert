0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas, and petrol are required for various operations in chemical industries, transportation, and energy sector [1]. Day-by-day these non-renewable sources are depleting and creating serious environmental concerns such as pollution and high carbon emission. Hence, a bio-based safe alternative is needed to fulfill the demand of the fuel sector, which can be sustainable, low cost, and environmentally friendly alternative. 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) is an excellent choice of fuel as it has a very high octane number (RON 119), high energy content (30 kJ cm−3) than ethanol (23 kJ cm−3) [2,3], it can be easily blended with gasoline [4], and has unique properties including high boiling point and water insolubility [5]. Most importantly, DMF is easily prepared by hydrogenation of bio-based feedstock, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [6]. In recent years, several groups have reported synthesis of value-added products using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock; for instance, Wu et al. reported excellent review on different MOF-derived catalysts and their use for valorization of sugars into furans and alcohols and hydrogenation of furans into different fine chemicals [7]. Similarly cellulose based materials showed major use in energy storage, which are used in electrode materials [8]. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) was produced from HMF with 95% yield over Au-Pd alloy nanoparticle encapsulated in metal organic framework (MOF) [9]. Majorly, 5‑Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered to be a platform molecule, which is a renewable and sustainable building block for a variety of fuel compounds. For instance, 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), [10] 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), [11,12] 5-methylfurfural (MFF),[13] 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA), 2,5-dimethyl tetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), 2,5-dihydroxy methyl tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF), 1,2,6-hexanetriol (HTO), 1,6-hexanediol (HDO), and 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD) [13] all are value-added products of HMF. Considering all these value added products and their extensive importance as a feedstock, HMF hydrogenation has been studied extensively in recent years by various research groups. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation was studied using NiCo/C in combination with formic acid as a hydrogen donor to obtain 90% yield of DMF at 210 °C [14]. Various mono- and bi-metallic combinations were used in previous work; for instance, Zu et al. used Ru/Co3O4 catalyst and reported 93.4% yield of DMF at 130 °C and 7 atm H2 pressure in 24 h [6]. Pd/Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF)-sulfonated graphene oxide catalyst was used at 10 atm H2 pressure and 160 °C, which resulted in DMF yield of 70.5% [15]. Some reactions involved use of either harsh reactants or reaction conditions; for instance, bimetallic Pd-Au catalyst was used in the presence of corrosive hydrochloric acid to convert HMF to DMF [16]. About 98.7% yield of DMF was reported using Ni-Cu3NC catalyst at 33 atm and 180 °C [17]. Raney Ni catalyst was used for HMF hydrogenation, which gave complete conversion of HMF with 88.5% yield of DMF at 180 °C and 15 atm H2 in 15 h [18]. Similarly, operating conditions of 180 °C, 15 atm H2 pressure and 15 h reaction time were reported by Kong et al. to obtain 93.6% yield of DMF using NiZnAl hydrotalcite [19]. Use of Pd improved the yield of DMF in some cases; for example, hydrogenation in continuous flow reactor was done using 10Cu-1Pd/RGO (reduced graphene oxide) resulted in 96% conversion of HMF and 95% yield of DMF [20]. Recently, a magnetically separable bimetallic Fe-Pd/C catalyst was developed for HMF hydrogenation, which reported complete conversion with 85% yield of DMF [21]. Cu-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles in carbon matrix catalyst reported 96.5% yield using THF at 15 atm H2 and 120 °C in 7 h [22]. Low cost Co-based catalyst was also reported largely for its activity and stability; for example, a Co-based catalysts, 11.8%Co-(ZnO-ZnAl2O4) [23] was used to report 74.2% yield of DMF in 24 h at 130 °C. Similarly, Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst, used at high temperature and pressure of 220 °C and 30 atm, respectively, resulted in 76% yield of DMF in 8 h [24]. DMF yield of 99% was reported at 20 atm and 170 °C in 4 h over 3%Pd/C [25]. It was also reported that a catalyst with higher acidity resulted in high yield of DMF; for instance, a highly acidic Pd based catalyst resulted in 98% conversion of HMF with 81% yield at 10 atm [26]. Therefore, it apprears that most of the processes discussed above, used harsh reaction conditions and were time consuming. Hence, to obtain high yield of DMF at mild reaction condition remained a challenging task and was highly desirable. There is scope for studying combination of bimetallic Pd and Co catalysts for their activity in HMF hydrogenation to DMF. One of the most essential and extensively used categories of heterogeneous catalysts is mixed metal oxides. To increase the surface area and acidity, usually, heteropolyacids are supported on activated carbon matrix or silica support; conversely, this limits the efficiency and accessibility of the catalyst due to the use of such support [27]. Whereas mixed oxide catalysts have many advantages such as activity and stability over a wide range of temperatures, being reusable and inexpensive, etc. [28]. Mixed oxide catalysts containing two or more metals were prepared by various techniques such as sol–gel [29,30] co-precipitation method [28], impregnation [31], physical mixing [32], solution combustion method [33], etc. Different methods result in variation in structure, morphology, and hence the activity of the catalyst. Among reported oxides, Al2O3-ZrO2 mixed oxide possesses tunable acidity and basicity, and because of this characteristic property, it was explored to use as a catalyst or as support in various reactions such as oxidation [34], hydrotreatment, hydrogenation [35], dehydrogenation [36], and transfer hydrogenation, etc. [37]. Reports are available on the selective hydrogenation of –C=O group using a combination of bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Pd and Fe-Pd [38,21]. The metal catalysts containing a combination of noble metal and non-noble metal are favored due to economic as well as engineering aspects, and it also such a catalyst effectively carries out selective hydrogenation. Co-based and Pd-based catalysts were also reported for –C=O hydrogenation reactions, which resulted in higher yield [39,40]. Therefore, design and synthesis of a suitable catalyst with eco-friendly methodologies has become a prime requirement in HMF hydrogenation. Mixed oxide support Al-Zr with higher acidity and surface area in combination with bimetallic catalysts was chosen in this work for a single-step hydrogenation reaction at mild conditions. In the present investigation, we have prepared a series of Al-Zr mixed oxides (AZMO) by co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods. All the prepared catalysts were characterized in detail for comprehending the relation for choosing the best catalyst for hydrogenation of HMF. A novel catalyst is thus proposed for the selective hydrogenation of HMF in one-pot, to get the liquid biofuel DMF at mild reaction conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Following chemicals were procured from reputed vendors: HMF (SRL Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India); Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and urea (S. D. Fine Chemicals, Mumbai); Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (AVRA synthesis Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad); NaOH (Thomas Baker, Mumbai); zirconyl nitrate (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai); methanol, Pd(NO3)·3H2O, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Merck, Mumbai)."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1 Co-precipitation method At first, zirconyl nitrate hydrate and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al/Zr mole ratio of 1:1) were dissolved separately in two separate beakers containing 50 mL distilled water (DW). Next, a solution of 35 mmol of sodium hydroxide was prepared and added dropwise along with aluminum nitrate solution into the zirconium nitrate solution. The addition was done simultaneously with constant stirring at 40 °C. The rate of addition was adjusted in such a way that the pH of the solution was maintained between 9 and 10. After completion of the addition, the slurry was stirred for 3 h, followed by aging at 70 °C for 12 h. The obtained precipitate was filtered, washed several times with DW to achieve neutral pH, dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. This was labeled as AZMOCP. Similarly, AZMOCP2, AZMOCP3 (Al/Zr mole ratio of 2:1 and 3:1, respectively), Al2O3, and ZrO2 were prepared. Various metals (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Pd, etc.) were impregnated, dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h to obtain respective x wt.%M/AZMOCP catalyst (where x = 1, 2, 3, and 5). 2.2.2 Hydrothermal method Zirconyl nitrate hydrate and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al/Zr mole ratio of 1:1) solutions were prepared separately in 50 mL DW and mixed with stirring for 30 min. The precipitating agent urea (0.09 mol) was dissolved in 20 mL DW and added dropwise followed by stirring for another 30 min. This solution was put into a Teflon lined bomb reactor and kept at 150 °C for 24 h. The obtained mass was filtered, washed several times until pH 7, and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The calcination was done at 600 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalyst was labeled as AZMOHT."
4,Hydrogenation reaction setup and products analysis,"2.3 Hydrogenation reaction setup and products analysis All HMF hydrogenation reactions were investigated in a 50 mL high-pressure standard batch reactor (Autoclave Engineers, USA). At first, a specific amount of catalyst was charged in the autoclave and was reduced by H2 pressure of 30 atm, at 200 °C for 2 h. After cooling the reactor, a known amount of HMF and solvent THF were taken into the reactor. The reactor was flushed three times with hydrogen, and after reaching the desired temperature, it was pressurized with hydrogen to perform the reactions. The collected samples were analyzed by GC-FID (TRACE 1110, Thermo Scientific) equipped with TG-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm diameter and 30 m length) and FID, as well as by using HPLC (Agilent 1260 infinity) equipped with CHEMSIL C18 column (4.6 mm I.D × 250 mm length × 5 µm) and UV detector (260 nm). Acetonitrile and DI water (60:40) were employed with 1 mL/min flow rate as the mobile phase. The products were identified through HR-MS (SI, Figs. S1–S3) and NMR study (SI, Figs. S4 and S5)."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of catalyst 3.1.1 BET According to IUPAC classification, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm obtained with a typical hysteresis loop belongs to type IV being mesoporous in nature [41]. Fig. 1 shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of different catalysts, all of them are mesoporous, and relative pressure (P/P0) are in the range of 0 to 1. The relative pressure (P/P0) of enunciation points was related to the pore diameter of the mesoporous material and sharpness at the end of the loops is attributed to the uniformity in pore size distribution (Fig. 1c-h). ZrO2 showed surface area (117.2) comparatively lesser than Al2O3 (207) probably because of large size of zirconia. AZMOHT has the lowest surface area, 90 m2/g, which was in direct proportion to the narrowing of the hysteresis loop (Fig. 1a). As the Al content increased (Table 1 , entries 3–5), the surface area increased significantly. The surface area of different catalysts was found in the order of: AZMOCP3 (max) > AZMOCP2 > Al2O3 > AZMOCP > fresh 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP > reused 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP > ZrO2 > AZMOHT. The trivial change in the surface area and pore volume of reused 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP when compared with that of fresh 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP, represents structural integrity of the catalyst. 3.1.2 NH3-TPD The acidity of all the catalysts was measured by using the NH3-TPD technique. For comparison, the total acidity of Al2O3 and ZrO2 was measured (Table 2 and Fig. 2 ). The measured peak intensities for various catalysts, which were divided based on the peak obtained at a particular temperature and represent corresponding acidic sites; namely, weak, moderate, and strong, respectively. As compared to ZrO2, Al2O3 showed a wide and intense peak showing the presence of a higher amount of weak, moderate as well as strong acidic sites. The total acidity of ZrO2 was found to be 0.56 mmol/gc at and that of Al2O3 as 0.73 mmol/gcat. However, both Al and Zr gave a synergistic effect to boost the total acidity of AZMOCP to be the highest among all other catalysts, i.e., 3.61 mmol/gcat, which was also confirmed by sharp signals at 150 and 350 °C (Fig. 2e). There was no noteworthy difference in the total acidity of AZMOCP2 and AZMOCP3; however, AZMOHT showed a much lesser value of total acidity than that of AZMOCP. In the case of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP, after doping of Co and Pd, the total acidity was reduced to 0.52 mmol/gcat, and a marginal change in the total acidity of reused 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP showing that the active sites were intact even after reuse, and catalyst remained active. 3.1.3 XRD The XRD patterns of Al2O3, ZrO2, AZMOCP, AZMOHT, fresh 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP, and reused 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP are shown in Fig. 3 . All AZMO catalysts except AZMOHT showed the presence of both Al2O3 and ZrO2 oxides. In the case of AZMOHT, due to the hydrothermal techniques of preparation, alumina and zirconia oxide existed in amorphous form, and hence, only two broad peaks were observed at 2θ of 32.6° and 40-65°. Both Al2O3 and ZrO2 prepared by co-precipitation techniques were as per JCPDS # 01–086-1410 (I) and 01–072-2742 (A), respectively. The peaks of ZrO2 were found at 2θ value of 30.21 (111), 35.46 (200), 50.55 (220), and 60.3 (311). Similarly, for Al2O3 values of 2θ were at 14.7(001), 20.32 (20-1), 38.5(111), 40.09 (31–1), and 66.7 (512). The palladium oxide and cobalt oxide peaks were observed for both fresh and reused 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalysts, which were a perfect match for JCPDS # 01–075-0200 (I) and 01–074-2120 (A), respectively. The PdO peaks correspond to 2θ of 31.1 (002), 33.2 (101), and 54.2 (112). Similarly, CoO peaks were found at 37.6 (10–1), 58.2 (2–1-1), and 64.75 (20–2). It is worth noting that due to the formation of Al-Zr mixed oxide, all the peaks in Fig. 3 (c-f) were found either overlapped or had smaller shifts in the 2θ values. For instance, PdO peak found at 46° (Fig. 3d and e) was found to be overlapped with that of Al2O3 peak at ~ 46.1° (Fig. 3c), which might have resulted due to wide dispersion of PdO over the surface of AZMO. The crystallite size of Al2O3, ZrO2, AZMOCP and 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalysts was calculated using Scherrer equation as 9.2, 8.8, 7.5, and 5.5 nm, respectively. It is worth noting that AZMOCP catalyst showed crystallite size smaller (7.5 nm) than that of individual oxides Al2O3 and ZrO2. Moreover, the crystallite size of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst further decreased to 5.5 nm because of the impregnation of Pd and Co and filling of the pores of AZMOCP. 3.1.4 ATR-FTIR The comprehensive study of stretching and bending vibrations of various functional groups present in the catalysts was done by ATR-FTIR. All samples showed the presence of Al-O and Zr-O bands. The broad absorption band obtained between 700 and 950 cm−1 corresponds to stretching of Zr–O–Zr bond [31] and Al–O tetrahedral co-ordination [42]. The vibration band due to Al–O was seen at 648 cm−1. The stretching and bending vibration due to the –OH group [31] attached to ZrO2 were present at 1631 cm−1. The broadband around 3373 cm−1 was most likely due to the stretching vibration of –OH group of physically adsorbed water molecules [43], which was present in all the catalysts (Fig. 4). 3.1.5 TPR Fig. 5 depicts the metal-support interaction of various mixed oxide catalysts performed using H2-TPR techniques. For this analysis, samples were freshly calcined and used immediately. The peak for chemisorbed H2 was seen in both samples. Impregnation of Pd and Co gave short peaks at ~ 100 and 200 °C representing a reduction of these metals, and the broad peak at 545 °C attributed to the strong interaction of Pd-Co with that of AZMO (Fig. 5a and b). The small peak at 73 °C resulted because of metallic Pd, which adsorbs H2 at room temperature and forms β-PdHx species, and decomposition of this releases H2 on elevating the temperature [44]. 3.1.6 FESEM, EDS, elemental mapping, and HRTEM The detailed knowledge of the surface morphology was obtained through FESEM and HRTEM techniques. As indicated in Fig. 6 , AZMOCP and 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP both represented highly porous and globule-type surface morphology due to the densely formed aggregates. The doping of Co and Pd leads to the uniform dispersion of these metals on the surface of AZMO (Fig. 6C and D). The focused surface of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP was further analyzed for elemental mapping, and the images for the various elements were discussed in Fig. 7 . As per the expectation, the concentration of Al, Zr, and O was very high than that of Co and Pd. The values for the percentage concentration of various metals were shown in Table S1 (SI). The results of the HRTEM analysis were discussed in Fig. 8 . Consistency to that of FESEM analysis, the aggregated particles of mixed oxide with impregnated Pd and Co metals were spread uniformly throughout the sample as seen in dark spots in Fig. 8A and B. The magnified area of Fig. 8C reveals the co-existence of aggregates of spherical shaped Al-Zr mixed oxides with that of Pd and Co, and it appears to be a composite material than a single species. Furthermore, the presence of crystal fringes and SAED patterns (Fig. 8D) reveals that the sample is highly crystalline. 3.1.7 TGA-DSC The catalyst thermal stability is an important parameter as it reveals the changes in the catalyst with temperature and therefore, exposes the robustness. Hence, TGA was performed (Fig. 9 ). There was a slight weight loss of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst (~5%) up to 120 °C, which was because of adsorbed water molecules. The catalyst remained stable from 120 until 600 °C, indicating stability at a wide temperature range, which was confirmed through a straight line of TGA. 3.1.8 XPS The composition and oxidation state of different metals in 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP were explored by XPS studies. XPS spectra of Pd 3d, Co 2p, Zr 3d, and O1s are shown (Fig. 10 ). Due to the strong interaction of Zr 3d with Pd 3d, there was a shift in the binding energy to a lower value than normal (~0.1 to 0.3 eV). The clear doublet at 333.9 and 339.4 eV was observed in the spectra (Fig. 10A) corresponding to Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, which were in accordance with the literature [45,46]. The binding energy (B.E) of 335.7 eV was assigned to Pd0 species of metallic Pd [47]. A smaller shoulder peak was observed at 338.6 eV associated with Pd4+ form [48]. Al 2p peak at 71.5 eV attributed to oxide form [45], and it was shifted to a lower B.E, which might be due to the co-existence with ZrO2. The peak at 181.3 eV corresponds to the 3d5/2 and ZrO2 [49]. The binding energy of the lattice oxygen was located in the region of 527–530 eV as confirmed from the literature [45], and the peak observed at 528.4 eV might be due to the Al2O3-ZrO2 mixed oxide (Fig. 10C). Two peaks of Co 2p1/2 and Co metallic form were seen at 792 and 777 eV, respectively [50]. It was worth noting that the intensity of Co was suppressed, which might be due to the mobility of oxygen or a composite formation with Pd, Al, and Zr."
7,Comprehensive study of HMF hydrogenation,"3.2 Comprehensive study of HMF hydrogenation 3.2.1 Reaction scheme Scheme 1 illustrates the hydrogenation pathways of HMF, which were reported by various groups [2,25]. As shown in Scheme 1, there are mainly two pathways reported by various groups for the production of DMF from sequential hydrogenation of HMF: (a) Path 1: Hydrogenation of HMF via MFF (preferentially hydrogenation of –CH2OH group of HMF to –CH3) followed by hydrogenation to MFA (a stable product) and then finally to DMF, and (b) Path 2: Hydrogenation of HMF (preferential hydrogenation of –C=O group of HMF to –CH2OH) to BHMF followed by subsequent hydrogenation to MFA and finally to DMF. It was reported by various groups that, when noble metals such as Pd or Ru based catalysts were used for HMF hydrogenation, it was found to follow path 1 (via MFF) predominantly and not path 2 [51,52]. This alteration might have occurred due to the different properties of the different catalysts; however, specific factors are not clear yet [1]. It is well-known that it is a sequential hydrogenation reaction and hence, hydrogenation of HMF in present work proceeds via MFF path, where HMF was first hydrogenated over 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst (discussed in section 3.2.2) to give short-lived species MFF which was not detected in GC; however, seen in HRMS spectra (SI, Fig. S1) which was immediately hydrogenated to MFA. In the next hydrogenation step MFA was hydrogenated to DMF. Based on these experimental findings, we propose the hydrogenation of HMF via MFF path (Scheme 1). The detail depiction is presented in Scheme 2 . HRMS was done for the confirmation of the products and included in the SI (Figs. S1–S3). 3.2.2 Catalytic performance In order to choose the best suitable catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of HMF, screening of different catalysts was done (Fig. 11 ). As per the literature both Co and Pd were used for –CHO group hydrogenation [15,39] and hence, 3%Co/AZMOCP, 5%Co/AZMOCP, and 1% Pd/AZMOCP catalysts were screened for their activity. It was found that both the conversion of HMF and selectivity of DMF were improved with an increase in Co loading. In the case of 1%Pd/AZMOCP, both values of conversion of HMF and selectivity of DMF were further improved to 86 and 89%, respectively. Bimetallic 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP resulted in a complete conversion of HMF, giving 97% yield of DMF. It is worth noting that 5%Ni-5%Co/AZMOCP and 5%Cu-5%Co/AZMOCP were used to substitute Pd; however, it did not improve the yield of DMF. Although 5%Ni-5%Co/AZMOCP successfully gave complete conversion, the selectivity of DMF was only ~ 70%. Any additional increase in Pd loading beyond 2% did not significantly improve selectivity (entry 3, Table S2, SI). The catalytic activity was found in the order of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP > 1%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP > 2%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP > 1%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP > 5%Ni-5%Co/AZMOCP > 1%Pd/AZMOCP > 5%Co/AZMOCP > 5%Cu-5%Co/AZMOCP > 3%Co/AZMOCP. As explained in Table 3 , the results of the present work were compared with the prior literature for comprehensive understanding. Many efforts were made by various groups using different catalysts for producing high yield of DMF (Table 3). Almost all the reported work (Table 3, entry 1–8) showed complete conversion of HMF; however, the process parameters and selectivity of DMF were different. The selectivity of DMF was strongly dependent on the choice of the catalyst. Mostly, bimetallic combination gave higher yield of DMF. Moreover, use of Pd (Table 3, entry 3, 4, 7, and 8) resulted in high selectivity of DMF. The present work (Table 3, entry 9) showed that our work on developing bimetallic 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst and optimizing the reaction parameters gives 97% yield of DMF, which ultimately should make the process the economical. 3.2.3 Effect of speed of agitation For studying the absence of external mass transfer resistance, the reaction was carried out varying the speed of agitation at 800, 900, and 1000 rpm (Fig. 12 ). It was observed that there was only a marginal change in the conversion until 900 rpm, after that any additional increase in the speed of agitation did not increase the conversion of HMF. Therefore, all the experiments were performed at 900 rpm. 3.2.4 Influence of catalyst loading The effect of catalyst loading on the progress of HMF hydrogenation was studied over 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst (Fig. 13 ). As the catalyst amount altered from 0.005 to 0.01 g/cm3 there was a proportional increase in the conversion of HMF from 70 to 99.5%. The higher concentration of catalyst, therefore, gave higher conversion of HMF. However, at 0.008 and 0.01 g/cm3, there was no further rise in the conversion, indicating that the number of active site was just enough to give maximum conversion, and any additional increase in the catalyst loading was not required. Hence 0.008 g/cm3 loading was finalized for further study. 3.2.5 Effect of the initial concentration of HMF The initial concentration of HMF was varied to understand its effect on both conversion and selectivity of the products. Fig. 14 depicts the change in the behavior of the selectivity of DMF and MFA. There was a subsequent decrease in both conversion and selectivity of DMF with the increase in concentration of HMF. At 1 mmol concentration of HMF, there was a complete conversion of HMF to DMF. Furthermore, an increase in the HMF concentration to 3 mmol reduced the rate of hydrogenation. Hence, both conversion of HMF and selectivity of DMF were found to decrease to 88 and 85%, respectively. Therefore, 2 mmol was chosen to be the optimized concentration of HMF. 3.2.6 Effect of H2 pressure on hydrogenation of HMF For studying the effect of H2 pressure, experiments were carried out between 5 and 15 atm (Fig. 15). It was observed that with the increase in the H2 pressure the conversion was also increased. At 5 atm H2 pressure, the conversion was 63%, and as the pressure was increased to 10 atm, the conversion of HMF reached 97%. Any additional increase in H2 pressure neither changed conversion nor selectivity (Fig S6, SI). Hence, 10 atm was chosen to be the optimum for further experiments. 3.2.7 Effect of temperature Further study was performed by varying temperature between 80 and 110 °C to comprehend its effect on the rate of hydrogenation. Fig. 16 illustrates the proportional increase in the rate of conversion of HMF. Both conversion and selectivity were dependent on the temperature. With an increase in temperature from 80 to 110 °C, the conversion of HMF was increased from 60 to 99.5%, correspondingly. At temperature 100 °C, all the HMF was consumed and hydrogenated to DMF. Further increase in temperature did not change this value of conversion, and hence 100 °C was chosen as the optimum value. Fig. 17 demonstrates the change in the temperature on the concentration of reactants and products. At lower temperature (Fig. 17 A and B), MFA and DMF were formed in equal amounts. Furthermore, the increase in the temperature significantly improved the DMF yield as more MFA was converted to DMF because of increase in the rate of reaction (Fig. 17C and D). Hence, for the high yield of DMF, the temperature was optimized based on the concentration profile."
8,Possible reaction mechanism and kinetic model,"3.3 Possible reaction mechanism and kinetic model The mechanism of hydrogenation of HMF follows dual-site Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) model, which was consistent with the experimental findings. Initially, HMF (A) was adsorbed on the acidic site (Sa), and hydrogen was dissociatively adsorbed on metallic site (Sm). In the case of surface reaction, –CH2OH group of (A) hydrogenates to –CH3 group through a short-lived MFF (B) followed to generate stable species MFA (D) through hydrogenation of –CHO group of MFF (B). Lastly, the second hydrogenation stage occurs where –CH2OH group of D gets converted to –CH3 group to form DMF (E). At desorption stage product E is desorbed and both sites Sa and Sm become vacant for the next catalytic cycle (Scheme 2). Detail elucidation is discussed in SI, since a similar kinetic study is already performed in our lab [53]. The rate of consumption of HMF (A): (1) r 1 = - d C A dt = k 1 K A C A K H p H 2 . w 1 + K A C A + K D C D + K E C E 1 + K H p H 2 Rate of formation of intermediate MFA (D): (2) r 2 = d C D dt = k 2 - k 1 K D C D K H p H 2 . w 1 + K A C A + K D C D + K E C E 1 + K H p H 2 Rate of formation of DMF (E): (3) r 3 = d C E dt = k 2 K D C D K H p H 2 . w 1 + K A C A + K D C D + K E C E 1 + K H p H 2 where, w is catalyst loading (g/cm3). The various terms in equations 1–3 are defined in the nomenclature section. By solving Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) the different adsorption constants (KA, KD, KE and KH) were calculated using Polymath 6.0 (Table 4 ). The Arrhenius plot was used to calculate activation energies for both steps, i.e., formation of MFA and DMF as 37.2 and 29.9 kJ/mol, respectively (Fig. 18 ). Reports are available for the kinetics of hydrogenation of HMF. Activation energies of 61.5 and 36.8 kJ/mol were reported for two steps hydrogenation of HMF to DMF, where it is stated that lower activation energy indicates the lower temperature required for the reaction [26]. Similarly, apparent activation energy of 48.5 kJ/mol was reported for DMF production indicating a kinetically controlled reaction [21]. The kinetics is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions, reaction mechanism and catalyst activity. It is worth noting that above reported reactions followed BHMF path (Path 2) and present work followed MFF path (Path 1) (see Scheme 1). The activation energies obtained in the present work also suggest that it is a kinetically controlled reaction."
9,Reusability tests and catalyst stability,"3.4 Reusability tests and catalyst stability The catalyst stability was studied by means of reusability tests (Fig. 19 ). For this, the catalyst was recovered after each cycle and treated with methanol for three times to remove the adsorbed species, followed by drying. The lost quantity in this process (~3–5%) was adjusted by adding fresh catalyst. With each reusability cycle, there was a minor decrease in the conversion; overall, there was about ~ 7% decrease in conversion after fourth reuse. It is probably because of the loss of active sites from the catalyst surface. All the catalyst samples used in the experiments were used after they were freshly calcined. The catalyst stability was analyzed by characterization technique TGA-DSC (section 3.1.7, Fig. 9). In the case of 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP, there was only 5% weight loss due to loss of moisture and the catalyst remained stable from 120 until 600 °C, indicating its stability over a wide temperature range. The reusability study of the catalyst demonstrated only about ~ 7% decrease in conversion after fourth reuse, which is good considering the loss during filtration. NH3-TPD and BET surface area studies after the first reuse cycle denoted a marginal change when compared with the fresh catalyst (Tables 1 and 2). Hence, it confirmed that the catalyst is robust supporting its integrity of morphology and active sites."
10,Conclusion,"Biofules are in great demand in the view of their excellent properties among which 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) stands out due to its desirable characteristics, and it can be synthesized by selective hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a platform molecule. We evaluated a series of Al-Zr mixed oxide catalysts (AZMO), prepared by co-precipitation and hydrothermal techniques. AZMO prepared by the co-precipitation method gave higher acidity and surface area for supporting both mono- and bimetals. 2%Pd5%Co/AZMOCP showed higher surface area and acidity, which was used successfully for hydrogenation of bio-based HMF to get liquid biofuel DMF. At 100 °C and 10 atm H2, there was 97% yield of DMF with > 99.5% conversion of HMF. The catalyst showed high stability and reusability upto the fourth cycle. The activation energies were found to be 37.2 and 29.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Additionally, the effects of various promoters and reaction parameters, including full characterization of the catalysts were exclusively investigated. 2%Pd5%Co/AZMOCP has proven stable activity as well as selectivity upto five cycles including the fresh use. This work may benefit upgrading some other value-added chemicals in biomass-based fuels and has potential for commercialization."
