0,Introduction,"The conversion of syngas from natural gas, coal, or biomass into C2+ alcohols has attracted increasing attention due to the potential use of these oxygenates as neat fuels or fuel additives [1–3]. Additionally, these oxygenate compounds can be transported as liquids and reformed into a hydrogen-rich syngas for use in solid oxide fuel cells [4–7]. The stoichiometry of the higher alcohol synthesis reaction by CO hydrogenation can be expressed as: nCO+2nH2 →C n H2n +1OH+(n −1)H2O;ΔH <0and n =2–8 The major byproducts are C1 compounds, including methanol, and the thermodynamically favored products CO2 and methane [1,8]. Therefore, the major challenge for higher alcohol synthesis by CO hydrogenation is to develop a catalyst with high kinetic selectivity towards higher alcohols, specifically catalysts that drive the reaction toward the formation of the C–C bond. Rh-based catalysts have been extensively studied for their ability to produce C2+ alcohols via hydrogenation of CO [9–11], CO2 [1,12,13], or both [2,14,15]. These catalysts have been shown to be the most active and selective for higher alcohol synthesis compared to alternatives based on modified copper, cobalt–molybdenum, or promoted Fischer–Tropsch catalysts [16–21]. Literature shows that the activity and selectivity of Rh-based catalysts are increased by promoter(s) [22–24], choice of support [9,25–27], synthesis method [28,29], and Rh precursors [30]. Optimum higher alcohol formation requires a balance among the rates of CO dissociation, hydrogenation, and CO insertion [31–33]. For example, promoters such as rare earth metals [33,34], alkali metals [20,35], and other transition metals [33,36,37] play an important role in these elementary steps. Usually, these promoters are used to activate the oxygen atom of the absorbed CO molecule and hence weaken the CO bond, leading to CO dissociation followed by a hydrogenation step to form CH x species. The mechanism for CC bond formation leading to higher alcohols also requires the atomic proximity of an activated, associatively adsorbed CO that can react with the CH x species. Subsequent hydrogenation of this initial C2 intermediate leads to the final higher alcohol products. These two sites—one forming CH x and the other an activated CO—are catalytically distinct, but need to be atomically adjacent. In addition to promoters, optimizing the chemical and the electronic nature of Rh species on the surface could improve the activity and selectivity to higher oxygenates. However, there are contradictory results on the electronic state of active Rh sites in the literature. While Watson and Somorjai [38] claimed that oxidized Rh species in perovskite (LaRhO3) correlate with ethanol selectivity and are associated with the stabilization of Rhn+ on the surface, Gysling et al. [39] showed that oxygenate formation occurs on metallic Rh sites in LaRhO3. Recently, the presence of an atomically adjacent ionic and metallic Rh species (Rh0–Rh n+) has been reported [30,40,41] to enhance the coupling between undissociated CO and CH x and the selective formation of ethanol via ketene [42,43] (H2CCO) or acetyl [42,44] (H3CCO) intermediates. For example, Du et al. [34] show that a surface complex such as Fig. 1 a enhances higher oxygenate selectivity via the formation of a “tilted” CO species in which both the carbon and oxygen atoms are bound to the surface (P could be a promoter cation or an oxygen vacancy). A similar Rh0–Rh n+ pair has been postulated by Wang et al. [44]. They also suggest that a metal promoter (Mn in their case) is in atomic proximity to the Rh n+ atom, forming a “tilted” CO, such as the one postulated by Du et al. [34] in Fig. 1a. They show that ethanol is formed by insertion of a carbene from the Rh0 site, as shown in the second step of the mechanism (Fig. 1b). Based on FTIR results, another type of site, shown in Fig. 1c, has been proposed by Kiennemann et al. to account for the formation of higher oxygenates [45]. This site consists of a RhCe site which also binds CO through both the oxygen and carbon atoms. This is postulated to lead to the formation of a formyl intermediate by hydrogenation of the activated CO (presumably through H2 dissociation on the Rh site), which they show to be a key intermediate in the formation of higher oxygenates. However, Kiennemann et al. [45] also note that this is not the only possible consequence of CO activation on this type of site, which may either favor CO dissociation (by weakening the carbon–oxygen bond), or promote CO insertion (by modifying the electron density of the carbon atom). It is not clear whether this sort of site would uniquely favor one or the other of these options. One way in which the type of site needed to produce higher oxygenates can be prepared is to use crystalline oxides into which an active metal such as rhodium can be isomorphically substituted. In this case, the rhodium coordination at the surface could be tailored based on the level of substitution. Another option for producing this type of site is to support rhodium clusters on an oxide to produce these sites by interaction with the oxide surface, in which case the rhodium atoms closest to the surface would be more oxidized while those farther away would be more metallic. Among the class of crystalline oxides materials which might be used to produce these sites are the pyrochlores (A2B2O7) [46–51], where A is a rare earth trivalent element and B is a tetravalent transition element. Although their use as an active support in heterogeneous catalysis is rare [52,53], rhodium can be either substituted into the structure, or supported on the surface of these oxides. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature investigating this class of material specifically in CO hydrogenation reactions. Of specific interest here are lanthanum zirconate pyrochlores, which have been studied for reactions such as fuel reforming [52–54], but not for CO hydrogenation. Here, we report the preparation and characterization of three pyrochlore catalysts for CO hydrogenation: (a) Rh substituted into the zirconate site (LRZ), with Rh atomically bound to oxygen and lanthanum at the surface; (b) Rh supported on the pyrochlore (R/LZ), with no covalent bond between the Rh atoms and the pyrochlore; and (c) Lanthanum zirconate (LZ) as a baseline catalyst. LRZ and R/LZ are intended to have different types of Rh–pyrochlore interaction; specifically, in LRZ all rhodium catalysts are closely associated with the pyrochlore lattice, while on R/LZ, at least some rhodium is presumably more metallic since it is not in the pyrochlore lattice. The goal is to investigate systematically the role of these Rh species on the synthesis of higher oxygenates."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis 2.1.1 Materials Zirconium oxynitrate (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O), anhydrous citric acid (C6H8O7), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), rhodium chloride (RhCl3), rhodium nitrate (Rh(NO3)3·xH2O), hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4·H2O), and analytical grade ethanol (EtOH) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were used without any further purification. 2.1.2 Rh-substituted pyrochlores (LRZ) Pyrochlores of lanthanum zirconate (LZ) and 2wt% Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate (LRZ) catalyst materials were prepared using a modified Pechini method [55,56]. Typically, citric acid (CA), a metal complexing agent, was added to a mixed aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate, zirconium oxynitrate, and rhodium chloride to form a clear solution. The molar ratio between CA and total metal ions was kept at 1.2. The clear solution was heated to 70°C on a stirred hot plate before ethylene glycol (EG) was added such as the molar ratio of EG to CA is unity. The solution was kept under stirring at this temperature for several hours to evaporate water and accelerate polymerization between metal-chelated citric acid and ethylene glycol. A clear viscous gel was obtained, which was further heated at 130°C in a heating mantle until an amorphous polyester-type resin was obtained. The solid material was collected and calcined at 1000°C for 8h to breakdown the organic polymer and burns the carbon off leading to a highly crystalline clean mixed metal oxide. 2.1.3 Rh-deposited pyrochlores (R/LZ) Microwave-assisted chemical reduction method was used to deposit 2wt% Rh on the surfaces of pure un-substituted (LZ)-pyrochlore catalysts (prepared by modified Pechini method mentioned in Section 2.1.2). In a typical procedure, rhodium nitrate was dissolved in a 100ml of a H2O:EtOH (1:2) mixture such as the Rh metal content is equivalent to 2wt% Rh. The LZ powder was dispersed in the above-mentioned solution for 3h then hydrazine monohydrate (500μl) was added quickly at room temperature under vigorous stirring. No color change was observed to the dispersion indicating that the Rh ions did not reduce under room temperature conditions. The solution was kept under stirring for another hour before being transferred into a sealed Teflon vessel and placed on a turntable tray of an Anton Paar microwave reaction system (Synthos 3000) equipped with pressure and temperature sensors. The dispersion was microwaved for 5min under continuous stirring and 800W of microwave power. After cooling the dispersion, the particles were separated by centrifuge, washed with ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 10−3 Torr for 48h. After drying, the R/LZ catalyst was calcined at 500°C in air for 3h before being characterized or tested. Microwave-assisted chemical reduction method, which is very different from conventional impregnation methods, offers fast and size-controlled particle nucleation and deposition on catalytic supports. Microwave irradiation (MWI) provides a fast dielectric heating to the reaction mixture, due to the difference in the reactant and solvent dielectric constants, leading to enhancement in the reduction rate of Rh nitrate by hydrazine hydrate [57–59]. A microwave-induced homogeneous nucleation of metal clusters is intended to produce a narrow size distribution of Rh on the catalyst support."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a Panalytical X’pert Pro (PW3040) X-ray diffraction system utilizing Cu Kαradiation. Samples were placed on a zero diffraction Si holder and were scanned from 10° to 90° (2θ). Analysis was carried with Highscore Plus Analysis software equipped with a standard ICDD X-ray diffraction database supplied by Panalytical. Average crystallite size was calculated from the diffraction pattern using Scherrer equation [60] (d = kλ/(B cos θ) where d is the average crystallite size, k is a constant that depend on crystallite shape, λ is the X-ray wavelength, θ is the diffraction angle, and B is the FWHM (full width at half max) of the diffraction peak. 2.2.2 Surface area and ICP analysis The BET surface area was calculated from the N2 isotherm data using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model (P/P o =0.1–0.3). The data were collected using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 unit. Prior to analysis, the samples were first degassed at 300°C for 3h before being cooled to room temperature for analysis. Each catalyst was measured at least three times and the average values along with the standard deviation (95% confidence limits) were reported. The Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) model was used to estimate the pore size of the catalysts [61]. The bulk concentrations of La, Zr, and Rh were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) manufactured by PerkinElmer (Optima 7300). Acid-digestion techniques were used to dissolve the catalysts prior to the ICP analysis. 2.2.3 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 pulse chemisorption TPR and H2 pulse chemisorption experiments were carried out using a flow system with a thermal conductivity detector (Micromeritics Autochem 2910). Prior to each TPR run, the catalysts (∼0.2g) were heated to 950°C under 5% O2/He (50ml/min, ramp 5°C/min). After the catalyst cools down to 50°C, the TPR analysis was then carried out by ramping the temperature to 950°C (5°C/min) under 5.0% H2/Ar (30ml/min). H2 pulse chemisorption was used to determine the percentage of Rh metal dispersed on the surface of reduced catalyst at 50°C. First the catalyst was purged with Ar gas (50ml/min) at 50°C after being reduced in H2/Ar at 950°C then 5.0% H2/Ar gas pulses each of 0.5377ml was introduced to the sample until hydrogen saturate the catalyst surface. The Rh metal dispersion was calculated using the actual ICP concentration of Rh. 2.2.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The elemental electronic states of the catalyst surface were investigated using XPS. The measurements were carried out on a Physical Electronics (PHI) spectrometer model 590. The photoelectron kinetic energy was measured by OmniFocus III spherical capacitance analyzer (SCA). Magnesium anode was used as the source of X-ray radiation (MgKα: 1253.6eV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained between 10−8 and 10−9 Torr during measurements. The binding energies were corrected utilizing the reference binding energy (BE) of adventitious carbon C1s at 284.8eV. The spectra from the regions related to Zr3d, La3d, Rh3d, C1s, and O1s core levels were recorded and analyzed using “Auger-Scan” analysis software developed by RBD Instruments. 2.2.5 Electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on JEOL JEM-2100 operated at accelerating voltages of 200kV and equipped with a high resolution CCD camera. Samples were prepared by placing a droplet of ethanol-dispersed particles on a Formvar carbon-coated, 300-mesh copper grid (Ted Pella) and allow it to evaporate in air at room temperature. Energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analysis was obtained utilizing a JEOL FE-7600 scanning electron microscope (SEM) interfaced to a Thermo-Electron Noran System Seven (NSS) X-ray microanalysis system. The EDS detector utilized in the X-ray microanalysis was a Thermo-Electron Ultradry Energy dispersive spectrometer, which was calibrated utilizing the Cu Kα line at 8.041kV."
4,Catalyst activity measurements,"2.3 Catalyst activity measurements 2.3.1 Experimental setup and reaction conditions A continuous fixed-bed flow reactor was used to measure the catalytic performance of the catalysts (Fig. 2 ). Table 1 shows the reaction conditions used in the CO hydrogenation reaction over Rh-based pyrochlore catalysts. In a typical run, the catalyst (1g) was first ground, then diluted with sand (5g) and then placed in the reactor before being in situ reduced under 10% H2/N2 flow (500sccm) at 500°C for 2h at atmospheric pressure. Once the reactor was cooled down to the desired reaction temperature (280°C), the pressure was adjusted to 2.9MPa and the syngas mixture (H2/CO=2) was introduced. 2.3.2 Product analysis Oxygenates in the product gas steam (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde) were analyzed in Hewlett Packard 5890 Gas Chromatograph (GC) equipped with FID detector and Restek-StabilwaxDA column (60m, 0.32mm ID). The GC data were processed using TotalChrom Workstation software. Hydrocarbons and other outlet gases (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) were analyzed by a ThermoONIX model Prima δB Mass Spectrometer (MS) equipped with an electron impact ionization source. The MS analysis of the products was conducted after condensing out any oxygenates in the gas stream using a sample conditioner connected in series with the MS as shown in Fig. 2. The MS and GC were calibrated with the appropriate standard gas mixtures before each run. The CO conversion, in all reactions studied, was kept intentionally under 1% to avoid any possible oxygenate condensation before analysis and to ensure that the produced oxygenates remain in the vapor phase prior to GC injection port. The GC column (polar polyethylene glycol columns) used in the study is not designed to handle high concentrations of water, one of the CO hydrogenation side products. The product selectivity was calculated based on carbon efficiency and is defined as: S ( % ) = 100 × n i C i ∑ ( n i C i ) where n i and C i is the number of carbon atoms and molar concentration of the ith product, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis The powder X-ray diffraction patterns for fresh-calcined LZ, R/LZ, and LRZ catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 a-c. Only a single crystalline phase, identified as La2Zr2O7 (JCPDS:17-0450) was observed in LZ catalyst. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ =28.63, 33.15, 47.61, and 56.45° correspond to diffraction from [222], [400], [440], and [622] crystal planes respectively, with a face centered cubic unit cell structure [50,49]. When 1.7wt% Rh was substituted in the catalyst material, new diffraction peaks at 2θ=31.88 and 45.71° corresponding to LaRhO3 perovskite (JCPDS:10-0305) were observed in addition to the main pyrochlore peaks (Fig. 3c). The formation of perovskite phase could be due to the presence of Rh in excess of an amount that can be isomorphically substituted in the B-site of pyrochlore [48,49] possibly due to the mismatch between the ionic radii of Rh and Zr cations [r(Rh3+, 0.805Å)< r(Zr4+, 0.860Å)]. This perovskite phase could also form during the calcination process [62,63]. The catalysts were calcined for 8h at 1000°C in air which could lead to the formation of LaRhO3 [62,63]. No other La, Zr, or Rh crystalline metal oxides were observed in the XRD patterns indicating that the Pechini method produces a homogeneous mixed metal oxide phases with no single metal oxide segregations. The average pyrochlore crystal sizes in LZ and LRZ were determined from the XRD patterns parameters according to Scherrer equation to be very similar (30±3nm), while the perovskite crystal size was smaller (19±2nm). The XRD pattern for the R/LZ (calcined in air at 500°C) is shown in Fig. 3b. No size change in the pyrochlore particles was observed before and after Rh deposition with no diffraction peaks corresponding to Rh metal or its oxide being observed. This could be due to several factors, such as size, concentration and dispersion of Rh metal particles. This catalyst has only 1.7wt% Rh which forms no crystalline phase detectable by XRD, which has a detectable limits of ∼3nm. Fig. 3d and e shows the XRD patterns for LRZ catalysts collected after CO hydrogenation reaction and temperature programmed reduction (TPR), respectively. No change in the diffraction peaks of pyrochlore phase was observed after being subjected to these conditions. However, the perovskite diffraction peaks completely disappeared due to reduction of LaRhO3 into Rh and La2O3 at high temperature by H2 or CO/H2 [39]. It is not clear whether the Rh produced during perovskite reduction are incorporated into the pyrochlore bulk structure or remained on its surface. In both cases, the XRD could not detect any crystalline Rh peaks. On the other hand the diffraction patterns corresponds to R/LZ after CO hydrogenation reaction and TPR are shown in Fig. 3 f and g, respectively, show a metallic Rh peak at 2θ =41.06°. The broadening of the Rh peak (FWHM) and hence its particle size varies after CO hydrogenation reaction, where the catalyst was reduced at 500°C compared to after reduction at 950°C by TPR. The higher the reduction temperature, the larger the Rh particles formed on the LZ surface due to aggregation and growth. 3.1.2 Surface area and Rh metal dispersion The BET surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter are reported in Table 2 for freshly calcined materials. Depositing Rh on LZ (R/LZ) increased the BET surface area slightly, from 5.31±0.03m2/g to 6.26±0.01m2/g. This is possibly due to the formation of Rh nanocrystals on the surface leading to a higher total surface area per unit weight compared to pure LZ catalyst. However, for LRZ, the surface area was essentially the same as for LZ, as expected if rhodium is isomorphically substituted into the LZ lattice. The average pore diameter of the R/LZ was slightly lower than that of the LZ or LRZ catalysts, which is consistent with the formation of rhodium clusters in the pores of the R/LZ. The bulk Rh content and dispersion are displayed in Table 2. The ICP analysis showed that both LRZ and R/LZ catalysts had a similar bulk concentration of Rh at 1.7 and 1.8wt%, respectively. After both LRZ and R/LZ were subjected to TPR at 950°C, the Rh substituted pyrochlore catalyst (LRZ) shows a higher Rh dispersion (10.3%) than R/LZ (6.0%). Using the following empirical relationship between percent dispersion (%D) and cluster diameter (d, nm) [64]: d = 108 ( % D ) The mean cluster size for rhodium is ∼18nm for R/LZ and ∼10.5nm for LRZ. The higher Rh dispersion for LRZ than for R/LZ is likely due to the reduction of the perovskite phase in as-prepared LRZ during the reductive pretreatment (to 950°C) before the dispersion was measured. This pretreatment apparently produces a metallic (and presumably well dispersed) surface rhodium species. 3.1.3 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) Fig. 4 shows the TPR results for the as-prepared pyrochlore catalysts. Reduction of LZ is negligible when plotted on the same scale as for LRZ and R/LZ, as reported by others for this same pyrochlore [52,65]. This indicates that the La and Zr mixed oxide species are very stable under reduction conditions and high temperatures. A weak reduction peak appeared at 253°C for R/LZ, which can be assigned to reduction of Rh species on the LZ surface. This reduction peak temperature is much higher than that observed for Rh supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 catalysts (70–136°C) [33,52,66], suggesting a strong Rh–pyrochlore interaction, even though rhodium is not in the pyrochlore structure. The small Rh clusters on the surface are unexpectedly stable to reduction on the pyrochlore surface, consistent with the dispersion results (Table 2) showing significantly more surface reducible rhodium in the LRZ than that in the R/LZ. Fig. 4 shows a major reduction peak at 429°C for LRZ, suggesting that rhodium is part of lattice and it is not simply supported on the surface. This broad peak had two components, a lower temperature shoulder at around 380°C followed by a higher temperature peak at around 429°C. This indicates two different forms of rhodium on the surface each with different coordination environment. This may be due to Rh being substituted in both the pyrochlore and perovskite crystal structures (Fig. 3). This would explain both the presence of two overlapping reduction peaks in the TPR profile, and the fact that they are close to one another, as would be expected for a pyrochlore and perovskite. Table 3 shows that the total H2 uptake is far greater for LRZ (0.28mg H2/gcat) than for R/LZ (0.07mg H2/gcat) likely due to reduction of both the perovskite phase, which completely disappear upon reduction (Fig. 3), and some reducible surface rhodium that remains in or closely associated with the pyrochlore structure. Assuming all rhodium in these catalysts was fully oxidized (e.g. present as RhO2), Table 3 shows the maximum calculated H2 uptake is to be 0.66mg H2/gcat for LRZ and 0.70mg H2/gcat for R/LZ using the ICP composition of Rh (Table 2). The reducible fraction of Rh can then be calculated to be 42 and 10% for LRZ and R/LZ, respectively. 3.1.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS spectra for as prepared (calcined) catalysts and for spent (after CO hydrogenation reaction) catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 . The catalysts were reduced at 500°C under 10% H2/N2 before CO hydrogenation reaction took place at 280°C. The intensity of the Rh3d XPS spectra for R/LZ is much greater than that observed for LRZ due to the nature, location and concentration of Rh species on the surfaces found in these catalysts. This observation also agrees with the preparation method adopted to introduce Rh species to the catalyst. In LRZ, the rhodium is atomically distributed in the LZ structure; bulk and surface, while in R/LZ, the rhodium particles are intentionally deposited on the LZ surface. Peaks at binding energies (BE) between 308.17–309.43eV and between 312.92–314.52eV are assigned to Rh 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 regions, respectively [67,68]. The 3d5/2 binding energy of metallic Rh0 is 307.0–307.4eV [69–72], oxidized Rh+ is 307.6–309.6eV [68,73,74], Rh2+ is 308.4–309.3eV [73], Rh3+ is 308.8–311.3eV [71,73–75] and Rh4+ is 309.3–309.6eV [54,68,72] varies according to the Rh binding environment. The spectra (Fig. 5) show that the Rh 3d peaks are shifted to lower binding energies after CO hydrogenation due to the reduction of the Rh species on the surface. The difference in Rh 3d5/2 binding energy (Δ≡E) before and after CO hydrogenation reaction is reported in Table 4 . The Δ≡E significantly increased from R/LZ to LRZ: R/LZ (0.33eV)<LRZ (2.06eV). This indicates that Rh in LRZ is more reducible than Rh in R/LZ, consistent with the TPR results (Fig. 4 and Table 3). This could also imply that the interaction between surface Rh and lanthanum zirconate is higher for R/LZ than for LRZ, possibly due to perovskite reduction in LRZ into metallic Rh and La2O3 [39]. The broadening of the Rh 3d peaks observed in LRZ indicates the higher metal dispersion on the surface [73] compared to a less broad peaks for R/LZ catalyst consistent with the H2 pulse chemisorption results reported in Table 2. Table 4 shows that the Rh 3d5/2 binding energy for freshly calcined catalysts are assigned to nonstoichiometric Rh oxide species (Rh3+ and Rh4+) [73–75] with more ionic nature for LRZ with a difference of binding energy of 0.29eV between fresh R/LZ and LRZ catalysts. On the other hand, after reaction the binding energies of Rh 3d5/2 show that the LRZ has more metallic nature while those for R/LZ still show some ionic nature. For example, spent R/LZ catalyst has a peak at 307.84eV which is assigned to a nonequimolar mixture of Rh0 and Rh+ [38,39,73,74]. These results indicate that La and Zr ions in the pyrochlore lattice play a significant role in stabilizing Rh0–Rh+ species at the Rh–pyrochlore interface. 3.1.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM was used to gain direct information about the size and structure of the pyrochlore catalysts. Fig. 6 a shows the TEM image for the fresh calcined LZ catalyst. The average particle size is between 25 and 40nm, which agrees well with the estimated values from the XRD analysis. Particles were found to be highly agglomerated with a secondary particle size in the micrometer scale range. These observations were also found with field emission scanning electron microscopy (not shown here). After Rh (1.8wt%) was deposited on the LZ surfaces, the particle surface morphology of calcined R/LZ changed (Fig. 6b). Disperse Rh nanoparticles of less than 2nm were observed covering LZ catalyst. The TEM results confirm the presence of dispersed Rh nanocrystals on the LZ surface which could explain the absence of Rh peaks in the XRD patterns due to their small size, dispersion and concentration. The results also indicate that the MWI method employed to deposit Rh nanoparticles on the catalyst surface produces small Rh nanocrystals with narrow particle size distribution. The larger rhodium cluster size after TPR to 950°C (∼18nm for R/LZ; see discussion of Table 2 dispersion results above and Fig. 3 XRD discussion) suggests significant sintering of the clusters as a result of this treatment. 3.1.6 Bulk and surface composition The compositional difference between substituted and deposited Rh-pyrochlore catalysts is shown in Table 5 . The ICP analysis showed that the atomic ratios for La/Zr and Rh/La are very similar for these two catalysts, with 1.1 and 0.049 for LRZ, and 1.0 and 0.053 for R/LZ, respectively. However, at the surface, EDX and XPS analysis show different atomic ratios with more La and Rh on the surface than in the bulk especially for R/LZ catalyst. The XPS Rh/La ratio for R/LZ catalyst compared to that obtained by EDX shows much more Rh on the surface which is expected due to the penetration depth difference associated with these two techniques [76–78]. XPS has a shorter penetrating depth (∼5 to 10nm) while EDX has a longer one (1–10μm) [76–78]."
7,Catalytic activity measurements,"3.2 Catalytic activity measurements Selectivities for CO hydrogenation for LZ, R/LZ, and LRZ catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The main products are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and methane. Only trace amounts of other oxygenates such as butanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde were detected, and collectively account for less than 1% selectivity. For LZ, the results show no selectivity for alcohols. Methane and CO2 were the major products observed with LZ catalyst. The absence of oxygenate formation on LZ confirms the essential role that Rh plays as an active catalyst for CO catalytic hydrogenation into alcohols and other oxygenates [1,79]. For LRZ and R/LZ, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol were observed. The turnover frequencies (TOF) for LRZ and R/LZ, calculated based on the Rh dispersion (Table 2), suggest a slightly higher inherent activity for the R/LZ, in addition to its higher selectivity to higher oxygenates. For R/LZ, the TOF was 10.9s−1 (molecules of CO reacted/Rh site) compared to 8.5s−1 for LRZ. Fig. 7 shows that R/LZ has the highest selectivity towards ethanol and the lowest selectivity towards methanol and CO2. On the other hand, LRZ has approximately four times higher methanol selectivity with lower ethanol selectivity. The more metallic Rh nature on the surface of the LRZ (Rh0 ≫Rh+) correlates with its high methanol selectivity as observed by Gysing et al. [39], while R/LZ, with more ionic Rh nature on the surface (Rh+ ≫Rh0) has the highest ethanol selectivity. These results suggest that the electronic state of Rh catalyst on the surface and the relative ratio between Rh+/Rh0 species is a determining factor in the product selectivity and the CC coupling mechanism. For these two catalysts, the Rh0/Rh+ ratio in the R/LZ leads to greater rates of CC bond formation and higher ethanol selectivity. This is consistent with the XPS results shown above, and with literature showing stabilized ionic Rh+ decreases the rate of hydrocarbon formation while increasing that of oxygenate formation [67]. The methanol to ethanol ratio observed for LRZ and R/LZ is very similar to what has been reported for LaRhO3 and Rh/La2O3 [34,38]. The variation in product selectivity are due to competing processes of hydrogenation and carbonylation corresponding to varying concentrations of molecular and dissociated CO and hydrogen on the surface [1,36,79]. At the metal–support interface region of reduced R/LZ, the XPS results show that Rh binding energy (307.84eV) is between Rh0 at about 307eV and Rh3+ at about 311eV. This suggests the presence of Rh in two oxidation states: Rh0 and Rh n+. The proximity of these types of Rh atoms at the metal–support interface region enhances the selectivity of C2 and higher oxygenates, consistent with earlier studies [44,45]. The high ethanol to methanol ratio observed with R/LZ is consistent with XPS and TPR results which suggest a strong metal–support interaction between deposited Rh and LZ support. The interface between Rh and LZ appears to play an important role in balancing the rates of CO dissociation and CO insertion under hydrogenation conditions to favor the formation of higher alcohols [10,44,80]. The XPS results in Table 4 show that the surface Rh is in a non-stoichiometric oxidation state, implying the presence of Rh+/Rh0 pairs at the interface of the Rh clusters with LZ. The coupling between ionic and atomic Rh in presence of La and Zr ions found in the LZ crystal lattice structure may act as promoters for CC coupling and subsequently for the formation of higher alcohols [10,44,80,81]. The LZ support appears to have two important roles in the reaction process: (a) it provides centers for the Rh catalyst through its basic La component on the surface, and (b) the interface between Rh and LZ helps in decreasing the reducibility of Rh on the surface, apparently producing the sort of Rh+/Rh0 sites needed for higher oxygenate formation. The selectivities shown in Fig. 7 suggest that the reaction mechanism on LRZ and on R/LZ catalysts maybe different. The oxygenate product distribution on LRZ catalyst follows Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) chain growth mechanism with no apparent parallel path for the formation of C2+ oxygenates (see Fig. 8 ) [39]. On the other hand, for R/LZ the Rh oxidation state on the catalyst surface is more ionic, and the rate of formation of ethanol exceeds what would be predicted from an ASF mechanism based on the selectivity to methanol and propanol. This suggests that either some methanol condenses to form ethanol, or the rate of CO–CH x coupling (leading ultimately to ethanol and propanol) exceeds that of CO hydrogenation (which forms methanol). In the latter case, the oxygenates are formed by parallel paths—one leading directly from CO to methanol and one leading to higher alcohols. The observed selectivity difference between LRZ and R/LZ is the result of competition between the two. Interestingly, the reaction mechanism for methane formation appears to be independent from alcohol formation for these two catalyst types since the selectivity remained constant. However, Gysling et al. [39] showed that the mechanism of methanol formation is different from ethanol and acetaldehyde (an intermediate in the formation of ethanol) on LaRhO3. At high reaction temperature (>300°C) the LaRhO3 activity favors C2 oxygenates while at low reaction temperatures (<300°C) methanol selectivity increases. A similar result was observed on LRZ in the present work. LRZ has a minor secondary LaRhO3 phase present which seems to play an important role in catalyst selectivity. At 280°C, LRZ favors methanol formation over higher alcohols. Gysling et al. also show that the Rh in LaRhO3 can be reduced to form Rh0, which they claim as the active Rh species. Additionally, their measured difference in activation energy between methanol (28±2kcal/mole) and higher oxygenates 16±3kcal/mol [38] implies that higher oxygenates originated from the common CH x unit formed by hydrogenation of dissociatively adsorbed CO while methanol is formed by hydrogenation of associatively adsorbed CO. The selectivity difference between LRZ and R/LZ (Fig. 7) is the result of difference in the rates of CO insertion and hydrogenation of CH x species on the surface."
8,Conclusion,"Lanthanum zirconate pyrochlores with rhodium either substituted within the lattice (LRZ) or supported on a pure lanthanum zirconate (R/LZ) were prepared using a modified Pechini method. The catalytic selectivity of these materials for CO hydrogenation into alcohols shows that the Rh oxidation state on the catalyst surface plays an essential role in determining the product selectivity. Atomically adjacent metallic and oxidized rhodium sites and their relative proportion determine the selectivity to ethanol. TPR, H2 pulse chemisorption and XPS analysis show that surface rhodium in the pyrochlore structure (LRZ) is significantly more reducible than rhodium supported on an LZ pyrochlore support (R/LZ) due to instability of secondary perovskite phase (LaRhO3) prepared along with the main pyrochlore phase under reduced atmosphere and high temperature conditions. The more metallic Rh sites in LRZ favor the methanol formation compared to higher alcohols, with the alcohol product distribution following the ASF chain growth mechanism. However, R/LZ has mainly ionic Rh+ surface species and shows far greater ethanol selectivity."
