0,Introduction,"Nowadays, one of the main worldwide environmental challenges is devoted to the search for clean energy sources. Reducing the content of gas emissions that contributes to the global warming and greenhouse effect is imperative, and fuel cells are one of the most promising attractive options to solve this problem. As only heat and water are released hydrogen fuel cells can be used as a producer of clean electrical power [1–4]. In general, to generate electrical power, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) need hydrogen as fuel. However, direct consumption of hydrogen in the PEMFC presents transport and storage problems make happen by its low density of energy. Therefore, hydrogen production in situ from hydrocarbon or alcohol feedstocks can be considered as a reasonable procedure to overcome this problem [5–7]. On the other hand, in this case, methanol indicates several benefits compared to other hydrocarbon fuels (liquid fuels at atmospheric conditions), its reforming temperature is relatively low (473–573 K) and has high hydrogen/carbon ratio [8–10]. Moreover, regarding to the methanol production, it can be obtained from a various source types such as coal, natural gas, and biomass. By the way, to steam reforming (SR) process, methanol can be fed directly to a fuel cell to produce electrical power. However, these systems propose lower power density, lower efficiency and higher catalyst usage over to the PEMFC, which present higher costs [11]. By taking all into account, MSR process is indicated as an acceptable source of hydrogen for PEMFC applications. As stated by literature [12,13], three chemical reactions can be considered in the MSR reaction: one main reaction; namely, the steam reforming itself (SR, Eq. (1)), and two side reactions methanol decomposition (MD, Eq. (2)) and water gas shift (WGS, Eq. (3)): (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ 3 H 2 + CO 2 Δ H ° = 49.4 kJ . mol - 1 (2) CH 3 OH ↔ 2 H 2 + CO Δ H ° = 90.5 kJ . mol - 1 (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ H 2 + CO 2 Δ H ° = - 41.1 kJ . mol - 1 It should be noted that besides of the reaction products, namely hydrogen (desired product), carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (undesired products), the non-reacted methanol and water can be observed. Whereas to feed a PEMFC, the high purity of hydrogen stream is needed, mostly because carbon monoxide poisons the platinum catalyst of the PEMFC and its concentration should be lower than 15 ppm [14]. This low content of carbon monoxide could be carried out by several strategies, namely using a permselective membrane. Combining in the same system both operations, separation and reaction, MRs present several advantages over TRs. Besides decreasing the number of chemical process units, at the same operating conditions, a MR could also attains higher performance than the ones obtained in a TR [15]. However, regarding the membrane kind to be housed in a MR, both MR cost and performance need to be taken into account. In general, several research works have presented on the Pd-based MRs application [16–28,10,29–33]. These membranes are highly selective to hydrogen permeation and allow reaching a high purity hydrogen stream. However, cracking problem during thermal cycling process and readily evidence surface pollution by carbon monoxide can reduce performance of the Pd-based membranes [32]. Moreover, Pd-based membranes are actual expensive and their applications are restricted due to low hydrogen permeance [34,35]. Therefore, a cheaper and usable alternative is strongly needed. On this route, as author’s best knowledge, ceramic membranes such as microporous silica membranes are cheaper and indicate higher hydrogen flux, but, in contrast, they show lower hydrogen selectivity with respect to the Pd-based membranes. However, silica membranes, used for carrying out MSR reaction, have not been comprehensively studied [36–44]. Their promising results have justified the need of a detailed analysis of the potential advantages achievable by using silica MR. On the other hand, theoretical modeling indicates an effective possibility to design and optimization chemical/separation processes and, especially, silica MR aimed at performing MSR reaction. Various methods can be applied to develop valid models aimed for evaluation MRs can change under the effect of operating conditions. Some modeling studies about MSR reaction in the silica MR are currently presented in the particular literatures [42–45]. In fact, all of them 1D models based on mass balance rule or CFD models have been suggested to evaluate the performance of MSR reaction in the silica MRs. Regarding to the complex structure of silica MRs, describing their performances by transport equations is difficult. According to other modeling approaches, a model based on ANNs strategy does not apply any transport equation, which could help to indicate, based on the fundamental principles, the reciprocal relationships existing between the outputs and the inputs. This aspect makes ANNs method as useful tool to model phenomena difficult to be presented by an equation-based approach, since no an initial information about the system under evaluation is essentially required [46]. According to the author’s knowledge, the ANNs analysis has been not yet used for modeling MR performance, especially in the silica MRs, during MSR reaction. Therefore, the main purpose of this research work is the development of an ANN model able to forecast the behavior of MSR reaction carried out in a silica MR by varying the operating conditions, subsequently by validation with experimental data."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental set up,"2.1 Experimental set up The simplified experimental set up is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the same set up, the TR performance was compared with the silica MR. The present setup of the silica MR consists of tubular module from stainless steel material (I.D. 24 mm, length 260 mm) homemade and a microporous silica membrane with tubular configuration (O.D. 10 mm, total length 65 mm and active length 50 mm). Indeed, in the silica MR system, two zones can be identified: one zone is corresponding to the annulus configuration of the silica MR (shell side), where the reaction is take placed and another one is inside the silica membrane (lumen side), where permeate flow (mostly hydrogen) is collected. A module schematic of silica membrane is presented in Fig. 2 . For both cases of the silica MR and TR during experimental tests for carrying out MSR reaction, 1 g of commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst (ICI 83-3, furnished by Synetix), was filled into the shell side and more details was presented in our previous work [37]."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure In the experimental study, before carrying out the MSR reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with hydrogen/nitrogen flow, for 3 h, at an atmospheric pressure and temperature of 593 K to reduce CuO to Cu. During the MSR process, the steam/methanol mixture was evaporated in a preheating line, and simultaneously, diluted by argon as carrier gas, in which argon gas was traced with flow rate of 25 mL/min. On the other hand, the gas compositions in permeate and retentate streams were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a packed Porapak Q column. It should be mentioned that each experimental point represents an average value of seven experimental points taken in 3 h at steady-state conditions. In the other hand, concerning the silica membrane structure, permeating flux through the silica membrane for each gas can be calculated by the following correlation: (4) J i = Pe ∗ i (p i,retentate - p i,permeate ) where Pe∗i (= Pei/δ) is the permeance for gas i, pi, retentate and pi, permeate the partial pressure for gas i in the retentate and permeate streams, respectively. Pe∗i can be defined by using the following correlation: (5) Pe ∗ i = Pe ∗ 0 ,i exp - E a, i RT where Pe∗0,i is a permeance coefficient and Ea,i the transport activation energy for each gas. Indeed, values of Pe∗i and Ea,i for each gas i, reported in Table 1 , were attained from our previous experimental tests [37]. Moreover, the following definitions were applied for describing the silica MR/TR performances: (6) Methanol - Conversion ( % ) = MeOH out - MeOH in MeOH in × 100 (7) Total hydrogen yield ( % ) = (H 2 - permeate + H 2 - retentate ) 3 . MeOH in × 100 (8) Hydrogen recovery ( % ) = H 2 - permeate H 2 - permeate + H 2 - retentate × 100 (9) CO - Selectivity ( % ) = CO out Total products × 100 where MeOHin is the methanol molar rate in the feed inlet and MeOHout is the methanol molar rate in the MR outlet. On the other hand, H2-permeate is the hydrogen molar flow rate that permeates through the silica membrane, H2-retentate is the hydrogen molar flow rate in retentate side. Among the mentioned definitions, Eq. (8) was only considered for the silica MR. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been done for studying the effects of most significant operating parameters on silica MR performance with respect to TR, in terms of feed conversion, hydrogen recovery, total hydrogen yield, CO selectivity and hydrogen and carbon monoxide molar fractions in permeate stream. In particular, effects of the transmembrane pressure, reaction temperature, feed molar ratio and GHSV value were investigated for both cases of the silica MR and TR. However, more details already were descripted elsewhere [37]."
4,Development of the ANNs model,
5,Model principle,"3.1 Model principle ANN model consist of artificial neurons. Neurons grouped into layers and parallel connections made the relation of them. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the simplest type neuron is identified by a scalar kind input (M), in reality multiplied by a scalar weight (W); a second scalar type input is summed to the weighted input (M.W) well-known as the bias (B). Then, the result of this pathway (neurons input of P = M.W + B) will be sent to a transfer function. Finally, this process leads to a scalar output (O). It should be noted that training step can adjust the W and B values. Adjusting the scalar weight and bias leads to accomplish a particular task of network or exhibiting a suitable behavior. Indeed, strength of network interconnections is presented by the connected weight function with them. In general, for a multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN, the first layer involves the input layer (independent variables) and last one includes the output/target layer (dependent variables). However, one or several neuron layers called hidden layers, like feature detectors, can be located between output and input layers [46]. Indeed, the last hidden layer generates the final output(s) of network. This value will be compared with target. Usually, target values will be supplied by a data set of experimental studies. The variance between the desired target and network output is applied for updating the weight fraction and biases pending ANN training by means of an appropriate learning algorithm with the goal of improving (minimizing) the error [47]. In fact, selection of latest architecture involves the description of the number of layers witch compose the network, the number of neurons and transfer function kinds in layers, the resulted connection among each layers, neurons and inputs of network. The ANN architecture indicates the prediction reliability and consequently the computational effort seems necessary to appropriately train the network using a data package that achieved by experimental study. Generally, amount of neurons is effective on ANN accuracy. Increasing the neurons in hidden layers can make the ANN more efficient, but the computational effort will be higher. However, in this study, the experimental data for two cases of silica MR and TR categorized based on the above-explained method were used to expand an ANN model intended to identify the existing nonlinear relations between the different parameters of process performance such as methanol conversion, CO selectivity, hydrogen recovery, total hydrogen yield, and composition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in permeate stream; as the output of ANN, and the process variables, like the transmembrane pressure, GHSV, temperature of reaction and molar ratio of Steam/MeOH; as the ANN inputs. Hence as, illustrated in Fig. 4 , the formulation of neural model corresponds to four steps. In the first step (a), data normalization was used. A preprocessing procedure was utilized for the ANN capacity improving of better approximating the mechanical correction concerning the outputs and inputs. Weight functions are specified with a right value. The secondary stage (b) is a correlation for next steps (c and d). Indeed, considering of final ANN architecture can be obtained when the post-training and post-processing analyses present a convergence criterion. Normally, this correlation will be done by maximum deference calculation of ANN predictions and experimental data [46]. Regarding to the ANN architecture development, presented case study fixes the number of output and input layers belonged neurons. In the other hand, number of neurons in the middle layer(s) can’t be indicated. A trial and error method is used in this study for “optimum” ANN architecture selection. Experimental data package (related to 10 experiments) is obtained by TR and silica MR cases. It should be mentioned that each experimental data was replicated seven times. A randomly data dividing into three groups allocating 70% of the data is used to perform the ANNs training and 15% of the data to test the predictions of ANN. 15% remaining of data was considered for validation of ANN models and calculated predictions. This process is considered in conditions set neither during training, nor during test. Inputs and targets were scaled before ANN training (to achieving in range [0.1, 0.9]). Ultimately, MATLAB ANN toolbox identified a MLP feed-forward architecture. Developed ANN for MR exhibits several results includes: I) 4 neurons as input layer, II) 12 neurons as first hidden layer, III) an output layer with 6 neurons (see Fig. 5 .). Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 6 , the similar ANN mode structure for case of TR during MSR reaction is presented. However, in this case, hidden layer and output layer include 12 and 5 neurons, respectively. In details, Table 2 reports the characteristics of input and output variables and ranges of these variables for MSR reaction in both cases of TR and silica MR."
6,Optimization model formulation,"3.2 Optimization model formulation Five concepts for optimization of considered cases are: (1) theoretical model for process behavior description; (2) recognizing the adjustment needed operating variables; (3) objective function definition; (4) satisfying of the constraints or restrictions; (5) applying an efficient optimization technique. Based on above-explained ANN model, principle of silica MR performance with respect to TR prediction by different process operating conditions is indicated in the following section. In the next step, after verifying the predictions with mathematical model, optimization process can be done. The optimization model formulation was done to identify that operating conditions can be selected for obtaining favorable aims. Indeed, it is adaptability permitted defining various objective functions, thus several condition behavior describing. Nevertheless, desirable conditions was considered for maximizing the hydrogen recovery and minimizing of CO selectivity for silica MR. Concerning, using the ANN estimations for extrapolation is not acceptable [47]. As a suitable decide, the best set of operation conditions in same exploited range was fined to obtain ANNs development. A damped least-squares (DLS) method, called Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA), was selected as the optimization algorithm [48]. A coupling of LMA algorithms and neural model were utilized for calculation of operation conditions values, which were exploited to attain the minimization/maximization of the considered objective functions, subject to the above-explained set of constraints. Hence, in Table 3 , characteristics of optimum ANN model for cases of silica MR and TR are reported. It should be noted that, regarding to the ANN model structure, single object function method was applied. Moreover, to reach the optimum number of hidden nodes, a series of topologies is applied, in which the number of nodes is varied, for example, from 2 to 20. Indeed, a mathematic function, namely, the mean square error (MSE) is used as the error function. In fact, MSE indicates the performance of the ANN according to the following equation [49]: (10) MSE = ∑ i = 1 i = N ( y i,pred - y i,exp ) 2 N where N is the number of data points, yi,pred is the network prediction, yi,exp the experimental response and i an index of data. On the other hand, the relative importance of the input variables on the output was determined using weights functions of ANN model regarding to Eq. (11) [50]. (11) I j = ∑ m = 1 m = N h W jm ih / ∑ k = 1 N i W km ih × W mn ho ∑ k = 1 k = N i ∑ m = 1 m = N h W km ih / ∑ k = 1 N i W km ih × W mn ho where Ij is the relative importance of the jth input variable on the output variable, Ni and Nh the numbers of input and hidden neurons, respectively, Ws connection weights, the superscripts ‘i’, ‘h’ and ‘o’ refer to input, hidden and output layers, respectively, and also subscripts ‘k’, ‘m’ and ‘n’ refer to input, hidden and output neurons, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"As mentioned before, a feed-forward network is used for ANN model simulation. In this system, back-operation algorithm is considered. The ANN model includes three layers of neurons, the first of which receives the operating conditions (input data); the hidden layer for case of silica MR, consists of 15 neurons, with the transfer function of sigmoid, while the number of neurons in the output-layer is corresponds to the number of target values (for both cases of the silica MR and TR), with a sigmoid transfer function for silica MR and a linear transfer function for TR."
8,Accuracy evaluation of ANN model,"4.1 Accuracy evaluation of ANN model In order to indicate the ANN model, the predicted ANN results for both silica MR and TR models have been compared with the experimental data. Experimental results and ANN model predictions for MSR reaction in both silica MR and TR is shown in Fig. 7 . Hydrogen composition in the permeate side from experimental data and ANN model are reported. However, this figure shows the good accuracy of ANN model and suitable agreement between model results and experimental data is seen. This agreement can show high accuracy of the ANN model. Moreover, in Tables 4 and 5 , regression coefficients for all target variables in both cases of silica MR and TR are shown. These results can be considered as another certificate for high validation of ANN model results."
9,Evaluation of operating parameter effects,"4.2 Evaluation of operating parameter effects Using the presented ANN model, a parametric evaluation of MSR reaction is done for comparison the silica MR and TR. However, effect of silica MR on hydrogen recovery, conversion of methanol and CO selectivity. In particular, the influence of transmembrane pressure, reaction temperature, feed molar ratio and GHSV was investigated during MSR reaction. 4.2.1 Evaluation of transmembrane pressure effect In order to show the effects of transmembrane pressure on silica MR performance in terms of methanol conversion (Eq. (6)) and hydrogen recovery (Eq. (8)), the experimental tests were carried out at steam/MeOH = 3, 573 K and GHSV = 6000 h−1, by varying the transmembrane pressure between 0.5 and 1.5 bar. As a general consideration, an increase of transmembrane pressure in the membrane module can result in competitive effects on methanol conversion in the silica MR; o A positive effect, well known as shift effect, owing to the selective removal of the reaction products by the silica membrane. In this case, the MSR reaction is shifted towards more products formation and consequently, feed conversion is improved. o A negative consequence due to the thermodynamic limitation of the MSR reaction, which proceeds with an enhancement of the mole number, so the reaction is not favored by high pressures. o Another negative effect can be observed by reactants loss owing to the permeation through the silica membrane. Fig. 8 illustrates the transmembrane pressure effect on conversion of methanol and hydrogen recovery for the silica MR and methanol conversion for the TR. Indeed, for methanol conversion term, a different trend can be observed for cases of silica MR and TR. In particular, the methanol conversion is decreased by increasing the transmembrane pressure for case of TR due to the equilibrium limitation, while the positive effect of shift effect is prevalent and, consequently, methanol conversion is improved for case silica MR. Furthermore, by considering the pressure gradient effect on hydrogen recovery in the same figure, it should be noted that hydrogen permeation is enhanced through the silica MR by increasing of the transmembrane pressure. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 9 , the CO selectivity is reduced by enhancement of transmembrane pressure for both cases of silica MR and TR. In fact, this tendency can conclude a lower conversion of methanol decomposition reaction (Eq. (2)) in the higher transmembrane pressure. In addition, silica can play an extractor role for hydrogen. Therefore, reaction will be pushed to higher hydrogen production and so on lower CO values will be achieved. In the Figs. 8 and 9, also the data obtained by ANN analysis (conversion of methanol, CO selectivity and hydrogen recovery) has good agreement with the experimental data and matched with a deviation of about 1% for the silica MR and TR during MSR reaction. However, deviation for CO selectivity at higher transmembrane pressure equal 1.5 bar was achieved 4%. 4.2.2 Evaluation reaction temperature effect Temperature is an effective parameter that can change the silica MR performances in terms of methanol conversion (based on Eq. (6)) and hydrogen recovery (based on Eq. (8)). In this case, by maintaining the transmembrane pressure equals to 1.5 bar, Steam/MeOH = 3 and GHSV = 6000 h−1, and temperature was considered in a range of 513 and 573 K. Hence, Fig. 10 indicates methanol conversion and hydrogen recovery versus reaction temperature for the silica MR. Generally, increasing the temperature is a positive change for endothermic processes. In this case, increasing the temperature enhanced the methanol conversion because of MSR endothermic properties. In addition, silica MR showed higher methanol conversion compared with TR. However, membrane reactors can extract the product (hydrogen in this case) and overall conversion will be increased. In the same figure, the hydrogen recovery against reaction temperature shows that hydrogen permeation through the silica membrane is increased by increasing the reaction temperature. It is related to the activated transfer mechanism in silica membranes [35]. In particular, a 93.2% methanol conversion and a 44.6% hydrogen recovery was achieved at 573 K with respect to 75.2% of TR. Fig. 11 shows future comparison results of silica MR and TR. CO selectivity of two types of rectors (TR and silica MR) has been compared based on different temperature. This figure shows that CO selectivity of silica MR is lower than TR in all tested range of temperature (Steam/MeOH = 3, GHSV = 6000 h−1 and transmembrane pressure of 1.5 bar). WGS is a probable cause for CO selectivity changes. Product elimination (Hydrogen) leads to forward WGS reaction enhancement and reduction in CO production. In addition, CO selectivity increasing in higher temperature is obvious for both of silica MR and TR. Methanol is decomposable in high temperatures. Therefore, likely methanol decomposition (MD) was increased in higher temperature. In this case, the ANN model was able to simulate experimental data of methanol conversion and hydrogen recovery with an error below 1%, while for CO selectivity, the ANN predictions exhibited a deviation from the experimental data around 1% except the case at reaction temperature 573 K, in which the deviation achieved around 5%. 4.2.3 Evaluation feed molar ratio effect A further parameter that can strongly affect the silica MR performance is the feed molar ratio (Steam/MeOH). According to the MSR reaction, an increase of feed molar ratio can shift reaction towards the products. Therefore, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, both methanol conversion and hydrogen production can be increased by enhancement the ratio of steam/MeOH. For this case, the operating conditions were adjusted at 573 K, 1.5 bar and GHSV = 6000 h−1 by varying the feed molar ratio (Steam/MeOH) between 1 and 3. Fig. 12 illustrates that the methanol conversion is slightly increased by enhancement of feed molar ratio. In particular, at feed molar ratio of 3, the methanol conversion was achieved 93.2% for silica MR, versus 75.2% for TR. Furthermore, increasing the Steam/MeOH ratio from 1 up to 3 can increase hydrogen production and consequently higher hydrogen partial pressures can improve hydrogen recovery. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 12, the hydrogen recovery is decreased by increasing the feed molar ratio from 1 to 3. According to the products compositions reported in our previous work [37], the trend observed in Fig. 12 is probably due to the different distribution of hydrogen permeation driving force realized inside the silica MR by varying the feed molar ratio. Indeed, by considering the hydrogen composition distribution in both permeate and retentate sides, the hydrogen permeation driving force is decreased by increasing the feed molar ratio from 1 to 3. Meanwhile, another comparison analysis between the silica MR and TR is shown in Fig. 13 , where the CO selectivity values are reported as function of feed molar ratio; in which the CO selectivity is decreased by increasing the steam ratio for both cases of silica MR and TR. In particular, Fig. 13 indicates the lower CO selectivity in the silica MR with respect to the TR outlet composition at reaction temperature of 573 K, GHSV equal to 6000 h−1 and transmembrane pressure of 1.5 bar. This result can be devoted to the “shift effect” that induces to the shift of the WGS reaction towards the products which allows a greater CO consumption. Furthermore, ANN model was also used for the tests discussed above with predictions showing deviations not higher than 0.5% and 3% from the experimental data related to methanol conversion, hydrogen recovery and CO selectivity, respectively (Figs. 12 and 13). 4.2.4 Evaluation of GHSV effect As another significant parameter that can strongly affect the silica MR and TR performance is the GHSV value. In this evaluation, the experiments were carried out at 573 K, transmembrane pressure of 1.5 bar and Steam/MeOH = 3 by varying the GHSV value between 3300 h−1 and 10000 h−1. As presented in Fig. 14 , the methanol conversion is reduced by increasing the GHSV for both cases of the silica MR and TR. By decreasing the GHSV value, a higher residence or contact time in reaction zone is provided, and consequently, the lower values of GHSV can favor to hydrogen formation. Hence, a higher methanol conversion and hydrogen recovery can be achieved by decreasing the GHSV value. Indeed, this effect presents a higher retentate hydrogen partial pressure that improves the hydrogen permeation driving forces with a consequent more effective shifting of the MSR reaction towards the products. Therefore, this effect causes more methanol consumption and a greater hydrogen production as well as a higher hydrogen stream permeating through the silica membrane. Hence, in terms of hydrogen recovery and methanol conversion, the better performance of silica MR over to TR can be released. Indeed, higher retentate hydrogen partial pressure owing to more hydrogen production rate in lower GHSV values is the main reason of hydrogen recovery improvement. Moreover, Fig. 15 specifies the trend of CO selectivity versus GHSV values. It is found that the CO selectivity is increased by enhancement of GHSV. In fact, this trend can conclude a lower conversion of WGS reaction in the higher GHSV values. On the other hand, the lower CO values in silica MR compared with TR can be related to the extractor role of hydrogen through the silica membrane. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 14, methanol conversion and hydrogen recovery were also investigated with ANN simulations exhibiting maximum deviations not higher than 0.5%. On the contrary, as shown in Fig. 15, for case of CO selectivity, the ANN predictions indicate a deviation around 2% at GHSV = 6000 h−1. A further analysis was carried out for evaluation of the operating parameter roles during MSR reaction in silica MR over to TR. As depicted in Fig. 16 , regarding to the effects of transmembrane pressure, reaction temperature, GHSV and feed molar ratio parameter values on silica membrane reactors in terms of methanol conversion, CO selectivity and H2 recovery, it can be concluded that reaction temperature is the most effectiveness parameter among other operating parameters for both silica MR and TR. Moreover, this figure indicates that reaction temperature and GHSV have higher impact on the silica MR with respect to the TR, while transmembrane pressure value and feed molar ratio have lower effect on the silica MR over to other once. Having proved that the developed neural model is capable of providing very accurate predictions of silica MR performance, we look for the set of operating conditions in two cases, in which operating parameters are to be chosen so as to maximize H2 recovery and to minimize CO selectivity. In particular, on the basis of the optimization model described in the previous section, it was found that a maximum H2 recovery, equal to 70.86%, could be achieved if the operating parameters are equal to the values reported in Table 6 . The silica MR performance indexes obtained from the optimization were verified experimentally under the same operating conditions. The results are reported in same Table, in which it is possible to observe that the maximum deviation is reached for the prediction of the hydrogen recovery (>7%). Using ANN model, similar optimization procedure is performed for minimizing the CO selectivity values in the silica MR. In details, on the basis of the optimization model, it was found that a minimize CO selectivity, equal to 0.11%, could be obtained if the operating parameters are equal to the values reported in Table 7 . Moreover, the experimental validation is presented for target variables (CO selectivity, hydrogen recovery and methanol conversion) in the same table."
10,Conclusion,"The main purpose of this study was simulation of MSR reaction in silica MR and TR by using a novel ANN model, formerly trained by experimental data to present an optimized relationship between the best performance indexes in the framework of the training experimental operations and the most convenient experimental conditions. Therefore, a Cu/Zn/Al2O3 catalyst was filled in the silica MR and the MSR reaction was done in a temperature range between 513 and 573 K, transmembrane pressure from 0.5 to 1.5 bar, GHSV around 3300 and 10000 h−1 and Steam/MeOH molar ratio from 1 to 3. In the above-mentioned, the ANN model was validated and, then, by means of an optimization algorithm, it was used to forecast the optimum operating conditions to maximize target parameter. Moreover, regarding to optimization results of artificial neural networks model, reaction temperature was selected as the most effective operating parameter on the silica membrane reactor and traditional reactor during methanol steam reforming. During training step of the ANN model, the error values of theoretical predictions with respect to the experimental data were achieved between 0.2 and 2%. However, a part from some random conditions, the error value was higher than 4%. As a particular consequence, for maximizing target parameters, the model predicted the performance of silica MR with an error on hydrogen recovery lower than 8%, around 5% for CO selectivity and lower than 1.5% for methanol conversion over the experimental data not used for the model training. On the contrary, by focusing on minimization of CO selectivity as an object function, the model predicted the experimental performance of the silica MR with an error on hydrogen recovery about 5%, around 9% for CO selectivity and lower than 0.5% for methanol conversion. Therefore, as this work represented, a black-box theoretical method of MSR reaction in the silica MR compared to TR via ANN modeling, in future studies, the model predictions can be improved by using a hybrid ANN model (including both transport equations and experimental tests) and resulting in an optimization of the performance indexes, by lowering the deviations within the experimental data and the simulations results."
