0,Introduction,"Before the discovery of fossil based fuels, the energy demands in the society were met by waste biomass from trees [1]. With the crude oil discovery in 19th century, global energy demand due to industrialization, transportation, and domestic use was solved by these inexpensive petroleum resources. However, the rapid industrialization and ever-increasing population resulted in high demand of fossil-based petroleum resources leading to their rapid depletion and high cost [2]. The worldwide energy requirement is expected to increase by around 28% in 2040 [3]. The historical statistics of energy consumption by non-OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries or non-OECD parts of OECD countries and its projection for future prediction is shown in Fig. 1 . The largest increase in the energy consumption by 2040 is projected by Asia [4]. Around 60% of total oil reserves are controlled by the Middle-East countries resulting in economic instability, long distance transportation, and political and security issues around the world [5]. Therefore, it has become crucial to develop alternate eco-friendly, economical, and efficient processes to meet the energy demands and mitigate the environmental pollutants. Alternate renewable resources like waste biomass, solar, wind, water or geothermal resources need to be utilized for the production of power and heat. Among these renewable resources, waste biomass is the only one to produce substantial liquid fuels and chemicals [6,7]. Lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose are the three major components of biomass. Small amount of other components (~5–10%) like extractives and ash are also present [8–10]. Lignin constitutes ~15–25% and composed of majorly non-carbohydrate, polyphenolic, complex aromatic structures [11]. Cellulose constitutes ~40–50% and is the most abundant form of carbon in biosphere [12]. Hemicellulose constitutes ~25–30% of the biomass and is a highly branched heteropolymer of six-carbon sugars (d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose), five-carbon sugars (l-arabinose, d-xylose), and uronic acid. The biomass conversion technology generally involves three routes, i.e. thermochemical, biochemical, and chemical routes [13,14]. The thermochemical conversion is executed either by combustion of biomass into electricity and heat, gasification into synthesis gas (syngas: CO + H2), liquefaction into aqueous sugar, or pyrolysis that gives bio-oils [13]. Pyrolysis is an environment-friendly, efficient and cost-effective process of biomass waste conversion into energy-rich fuel and chemicals. This process also has high efficiency in phase transformation, distributed production, and low capital investment due to their compatibility with the existing petroleum refinery infrastructure and engine structures. Pyrolysis of biomass occurs at high temperature without air and leads to the production of liquid bio-oil (~80% yield), solid char, and pyrolytic gases [15]. The bio-oil contains phenolic compounds (~30%), sugars, furfurals, and ~5–15% of carbon fractions in the form of light oxygenates (C1–C4). The presence of high oxygen functionalities (~35–40%) in bio-oil renders some undesirable properties like chemical instability, corrosiveness, low heating value (~17–19 MJ kg−1) as compared to fossil-based fuel (~42 MJ kg−1), low carbon and hydrogen content, high viscosity, and incompatibility with crude petroleum, which limits its storage and direct application as drop-in fuel [16]. An upgradation is necessary by removing this oxygen functionality in order to lift the bio-oil quality [17]. Bio-oil upgrading can proceed through several processes like emulsion, catalytic pyrolysis, zeolite cracking, hydrotreatment, steam reforming, esterification, etc as shown in Fig. 2 . Among these processes, hydrotreatment (e.g. hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, hydrogenation) is a well-established process in oil refineries [16]. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an enthralling process operated at high pressure in hydrogen atmosphere to remove bio-oil's oxygen content for a high grade oil product. Unfortunately, this HDO process operates at high pressure and temperature, which causes the loss of C1–C4 light oxygenate fractions in the form of non-condensable gases that could have otherwise contributed in increasing the heating value of the biofuel and chemicals. Techniques need to be developed to retain these oxygenates in the final upgraded products."
1,Valorization of pyrolysis bio-oil by C–C coupling,"1.1 Valorization of pyrolysis bio-oil by C–C coupling Extensive research on the rational design and development of effective catalytic systems for the production of upgraded biofuel from biomass pyrolysis is reported in recent years [18–20]. The hydrotreating temperature for phenolics and aromatic ethers is > 300 °C while for small aliphatic ethers, alcohols, and carboxylic groups it is < 300 °C. Thus, hydrogenation of these small compounds is quite difficult. The loss of light oxygenates during HDO can be suppressed by valorization of lignin-derived phenolic compounds via C–C coupling with light oxygenates to produce high energy density (~46–50 MJ kg−1) C10–C13 fuel range alkylphenols, prior to HDO. Alkylation is one such reaction to form C–C coupling in the presence of acidic catalysts. These alkylphenols have the potential to retain the C1–C4 fraction during the further bio-oil upgrading. The schematics of the existing upgrading route and the proposed alkylation step is represented in Fig. 3 ."
2,Alkylation of m-cresol (phenolics derivative) with iso-propanol (light oxygenate),"1.2 Alkylation of m-cresol (phenolics derivative) with iso-propanol (light oxygenate) The complex bio-oil structure urges for initial research on the constituent model compounds to extract the necessary information for catalyst development and overall process design for upgradation of the bio-oil to cost-effective renewable fuel precursors and fuels. An important model reaction is C–C coupling through alkylation reaction between m-cresol (model for phenolics) and iso-propanol (a light oxygenate) forming thymol, an efficient fuel precursor. Besides being a biofuel precursor, thymol is a value added chemical, which finds application as precursor in the antioxidant, fragrance, agrochemicals, cosmetics, lubricant, medical disinfectant, insecticide, and fuel additives industries [21,22]. It is also an effective antibacterial agent against Escherichia coli, a common food-poisoning bacteria [23]. Moreover, another valuable product called menthol is formed from thymol hydrogenation. Menthol has peppermint-like odour and used in anaesthesia, antiseptic and antimicrobial agent, and fragrance [24]."
3,Literature review,"In 1935, Calloway reported that Friedel-Crafts reactions are the most widely lab demonstrated, researched and industrially applied organic chemistry reactions for the formation of various industrially useful compounds [25]. Alkylation of phenolic compounds with alcohol/olefins by C–C coupling is one such acid catalyzed, electrophilic substitution, Friedel-Crafts reaction. To improve the carbon efficiency of the final valorized product, the multifunctional phenols present in a pyrolysis bio-oil can be subjected to selective C–C bond formation over acidic catalysts to yield useful chemical intermediates, C7–C14 range alkylphenols, which could undergo further deoxygenation to form liquid fuel [26]. Another advantage of such a strategy is that alkyphenols find applications as very important chemicals in several industries as antioxidants, fragrances, cosmetics, agrochemicals, fuel additives [27–29]. For example, ethylbenzene is an intermediate in styrene production and used as a paint solvent [30]. Alkylation of iso-butane by olefins forms high-octane gasoline [31]. Tert-butyl-iso-octyl and tert-butyl-iso-decyl phenols find applications as drilling oil additives, polymer stabilizers, and antioxidants in chemical industries [32]. Alkylation between phenol and methanol forms 2,6-xylenol, which is a monomer unit of thermoresistant poly-(2,6-dimethyl)-phenyleneoxide resin [33]. A review of reported literature is discussed based on thermodynamic, catalytic activity, mechanistic, and kinetic analyses. In each category, the catalytic development of several alkylation reactions of phenolic compounds with alcohol/olefins is discussed. This discussion is followed by special emphasis on the m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol/propene."
4,Thermodynamic analysis,"2.1 Thermodynamic analysis Very few investigations on the thermodynamics of alkylation reactions are reported till date. Kukui et al. developed a procedure for thermodynamic analysis of alkylation of phenol with 1-butene in which they calculated the reaction heats for o- and p-sec-monoalkyl phenols formation and established that monoalkyl phenol formation at temperatures of 180–200 °C in the liquid phase is irreversible. The reaction enthalpy calculated in this temperature range was 20–23 kcal mol−1 [34]. Khlebnikova et al. investigated the thermodynamics of benzene alkylation by ethylene to form ethylbenzene over alumina catalyst [30]. They have used the Neglecting of Diatomic Overlap (NDDO) based semi-empirical method to calculate the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. The competing alkylation and transalkylation reactions were compared and the activation energy of benzene alkylation (37 kcal mol−1) was found to be lower than the transalkylation of diethylbenzene (41 kcal mol−1). This suggests that the formation of ethylbenzene is more favored in this case, however, reaction on AlCl3 was limited by its activation energy [35]. Khamzin et al. reported iso-butane alkylation with C4 olefin to form C8 isomers through multiple steps of carbenium ion formation, isomerization and hydride anion transfer from an iso-paraffin to carbenium ion [31]. Along with this, they also considered several side reactions such as olefin polymerization leading to coke formation and dealkylation and cracking of the products. They elucidated the dependence of temperature and pressure on the change in standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of the reaction. They concluded that ΔG° for iso-alkanes formation reactions decreased with rise in temperature from 40 to 120 °C. Further, ΔG° becomes almost constant at pressures above 1000 kPa with minimum change in alkylate yield. Dong et al. applied Benson group contribution method to calculate the thermodynamic properties of components for selective formation of toluene and p-xylene in benzene/methanol alkylation reaction, while minimizing the by-products, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, and tri-methylbenzene [36]. They considered the main alkylation reaction, methanol self-reaction, other alkylation reactions, and coking reactions and optimized the temperature for enhancing the main alkylation reaction. Our group also, has earlier, reported a thermodynamic analysis to understand the thermodynamic limits of the m-cresol alkylation reaction with iso-propanol alongwith all the possible side-reactions [37]. The effect of important process parameters like reactant molar ratio and temperature on the equilibrium conversion of reactants and selectivity to the desired and also the side products was investigated to assess which reactions are thermodynamically controlled and which are kinetically controlled. UNIFAC property method of the pure components was the closest, validated by experimental values of VLE data. From thermodynamic simulations, the reaction temperature of 250–275 °C and iso-propanol/m-cresol mole ratio of 2–5/1 was found to be optimum for selective thymol formation. The kinetically controlled product was found to be iso-propyl-3-methylphenyl ether (IPMCE) while the thermodynamically stable product was found to be thymol and its isomers."
5,Catalytic activity analysis,"2.2 Catalytic activity analysis Several catalytic activity literature report the alkylation of phenol and substituted phenols with C1–C4 alcohols/olefins as alkylating agents as shown in Tables 1 and 2 . The use of alcohols has a special advantage of easy transportation and also, these components are found in the pyrolysis bio-oil itself. 2.2.1 Alkylation of phenol and substituted phenols with C1–C4 alcohols/olefins The alkylation of phenol and substituted phenols with various alkylating agents reported in literature is summarized in Table 1. Sartori et al. explained the regio-selective alkylation by treating a mixture of phenol and linear alkenes (1:1 mol ratio) with AlCl3 in chloroform at room temperature that resulted in 48–60% yield of ortho-selective sec-alkylphenols. While using branched alkenes, a yield of 80–85% para-tert-alkylphenols was observed by them. They showed that ortho-selective tert-alkylation was promoted by adding potassium phenolate that reduced the protic acidity by replacing HCl with phenol [38]. Sato et al. claimed non-catalytic phenol alkylation with iso-propanol in supercritical water at 400 °C, which favored C–C bond formation to form ortho-substituted alkylphenols [39]. They explained that high water density forms a single homogeneous phase with reactants and the water molecules surround the phenol hydroxy groups by forming a ring structure with them at supercritical conditions. Favorable dissociation of local hydroxyl group causes the reaction field around it, which leads to ortho-position being alkylated. Zhang et al. explained the alkylation of phenol with tert-butanol over large pore HY zeolite. The catalytic activity was found to be independent of crystallite diameter [40]. The lower reactant mole ratio (<1.5) preferentially formed 2-tert-butylphenol and 4-tert-butylphenol, while the higher ratios (>1.5) gave dialkylated products. They also claimed that lower WHSV (<1.66 h−1) was favorable for 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol formation. Grabowska et al. conducted gas-phase alkylation between phenol and methanol over ZnAl2O4 spinels with ZnO:Al2O3 molar ratio of 1:1 prepared by using precursors, aluminium iso-propoxide and basic aluminium nitrate which resulted in the formation of ZnAl2O4 +/− traces of γ-Al2O3, respectively [41]. They obtained high o-cresol selectivity over pure ZnAl2O4 and low o-cresol selectivity over ZnAl2O4+γAl2O3, which behaved like acid-base bifunctional system. Lazar et al. studied the gas phase phenol methylation over Cu1-x Co x Fe2O4 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) ferrospinel catalysts with a high target high yield of 2,6-dimethylphenol [33], at 97% phenol conversion at x = 0.5 and 350 °C. Gonzales-Pena et al. screened several catalysts like zeolite Na–Y and Zn2+ or H+ exchanged Na–Y in the gas phase phenol methylation with methanol [42]. They showed that addition of Zn2+ increased the Lewis acidity of Na–Y, whereas, addition of H+ generated Brønsted acidity and decreased Lewis acidic sites. The catalytic activity of the ion-exchanged catalysts was found to be higher than Na–Y. The Zn–NaY increased the selectivity to C-alkylated cresols. Song et al. explored the role of varying Si/Al ratio in ZSM-5 zeolites in liquid phase tert-butylation of phenol to form 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol [43]. They observed the maximum conversion of phenol (36.6%) at Si/Al ratio of 30 due to better meso-structure formation, but 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol was observed to be most selective (81.9%) at Si/Al ratio of 100 due to increased acid strength. Xu et al. reported the gas phase alkylation of phenol with propene at 350 °C temperature and 8.0 h−1 WHSV to investigate the effect of zeolite topologies on product selectivity [44]. They reported that the maximum selectivity of the desired 2-iso-propylphenol is obtained by the conversion reactions on the exterior surface predominantly than the pores. Among the several zeolites like FAU, BEA, MFI, MOR, MWW, MTT, etc; large pore BEA zeolite showed maximum selectivity to 2-iso-propylphenol due to balance of diffusion and steric hindrance of secondary reactions. Whereas, 4-iso-propylphenol was mostly observed in medium pore 10 membered ring zeolites with average pore dimension range of 5.25–5.75 Å. The amount of di-alkylated products increased with increasing pore size. Xu et al. also reported the effect of water content on the gas phase alkylation of phenol with propene over BEA zeolite under analogous reaction conditions [45]. They considered the conversion of phenol in three situations: with propene alone, co-feeding water with propene, and co-generated water from iso-propanol as alkylating agent. They observed that the use of iso-propanol significantly enhance the phenol conversion (11%) as compared to propene (6%) and propene with water (7.5%). The presence of water converts some Lewis acid sites on zeolites to Brønsted acid sites that increased the alkylation rate. The generation of oxonium ions might further improve the phenol conversion in case of iso-propanol. Bhadra and Yadav also investigated the phenol methylation and tuned the acidic and basic active sites of zirconium, tungsten and silicon oxide (xZrO2-yWO3-SiO2) catalysts to control the O- and C- alkylated product selectivity [46]. It was witnessed that o-cresol was predominantly formed over 20%WO3–ZrO2 and 40%WO3–ZrO2 in the absence of silica. On the other hand, combinations like 10%ZrO2–30%WO3–SiO2 was favorable for anisole synthesis. Kunjachan and Kurian reported phenol methylation over Fe, V and Zr doped Ce nano-oxides catalyst (0.5 g) at 1:3 phenol to methanol mole ratio, 1.4 h−1 WHSV, 300 °C temperature, and 2 h TOS to achieve ~80–90% conversion and ~50–60% selectivity to o-cresol [47]. Rajaram Bal and Sivasanker investigated the alkylation of cresols (o-, m-, p-cresol) over alkali metal loaded silica catalysts to form O-alkylated products [48]. They observed the reactant conversion order to be o-cresol < m-cresol < p-cresol with the increase in basicity of group I-A metals (Li<Na<K<Cs). The mechanism involves an easy and stable (with least steric hindrance transient) phenolate species formation in case of p-cresol. Lee et al. who used alkali metal loaded X zeolite to catalyze phenolics alkylation with excess methanol have observed similar results [49]. They described that O-alkylation increased with increased basicity which is the synergy of the cesium oxide in zeolite cavity plus the ion-exchanged cesium cations. Yadav and Pathre investigated m-cresol alkylation with tert-butanol in liquid phase over three superacid modified zirconia catalysts, named UDCaT-4, 5 and 6, based on difference in the sulfating agents [50]. Amongst these catalysts, UDCaT-5 with 9% sulfate and higher acidity as compared to the other two catalysts was found to be the more efficient. Acevedo et al. screened Al-MCM-41, HBEA, HZSM5, ZnY, and HMCM22 molecular sieves as catalysts for methylation of m-cresol at 250 °C [51]. They observed that O-alkylation was dominant initially due to the moderate strength of acid sites (Al-MCM-41). However, frequency of C-alkylation was more on Lewis (ZnY) or both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites (H-MCM-22). HBEA catalyst having acidic sites of considerable strengthshowed high activity but was non-selective to O- and C-alkylated products. Selvaraj et al. analyzed the effect of replacing Al with Zn in mesoporous Zn–Al-MCM-41(Si/(Zn+Al) = 75, 151, 228, 304, 380) and compared with Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al = 21, 42, 62, 83, 104) [52]. The number of active sites increased in Zn–Al-MCM-41 by the replacement of tetrahedral aluminium ion with zinc ions creating two negative charges. Its’ catalytic activity was investigated in alkylation of toluene with iso-propanol to form 1-methyl-4-iso-propylbenzene. Zn–Al-MCM-41(75) with high Brønsted acidity produced the highest amount of 1-methyl-4-iso-propylbenzene (84.8%). Guo et al. prepared C8–C15 range aromatics from benzene alkylation with mixed ethene and propene over nanosized ZSM-5 catalyst [53]. They mentioned that the yield of desired carbon range products can be improved by decreasing catalyst particle size for improved mass transfer as well as by decreasing Si/Al ratio for high acid strength. Some developments of homogeneous phase alkylation of phenolic compounds with alcohols/olefins are made by using ionic liquids (ILs) as both catalysts and solvents. Liu et al. employed alkylamine-based SO3H-functionalized IL for m-cresol alkylation with tert-butanol [54]. Gunaratne et al. used chloroindate (III) ionic liquids (ILs) to catalyze phenol and cresols alkylation with alkenes like propene and iso-butene [55]. They explained that as compared to conventional aluminum(III)-based ILs, this IL had higher hydrolytic stability and lower oxophilicity. Elavarasan et al. investigated p-cresol alkylation with tert-butanol initially in a homogeneous phase alkylation in triethylamine based IL and later conducted this alkylation over heterogenized imidazole based SO3H-functionalized IL over a thiol functionalized SBA-15 support and reported 82% and 65% reactant conversion respectively [56,57]. 2.2.2 Industrial process for thymol production The process for thymol production using m-cresol and propene over metal oxides was first reported and patented in 1932 by Rheinische Kampfer Fabrik GmbH, Germany [58]. In 1976, Koppers Company Inc., Pittsburgh, patented the process of m-cresol alkylation with propene over silica alumina clays [59]. Bayer AG, Germany, patented and runs their industrial process for thymol production by m-cresol alkylation with propene over activated alumina [60]. The reactants (m-cresol and propene) in liquid phase are pumped through a pressure tubular reactor packed with the catalyst and 350–360 °C temperature, 5000 kPa pressure, 1:1 m-cresol to propene mole ratio, and 0.25 h−1 LHSV are maintained during the optimum process operation for a 70% m-cresol conversion and 55% thymol selectivity as shown in Table 2. However, the problem of handling and transportation of gaseous propene can be overcome by using liquid iso-propanol instead of propene as their alkylating agent. Further, the risks associated with such high pressures, as in this process, demands the development of a catalyst and reaction system that give higher desired product yields at reasonable pressures. 2.2.3 Alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol/propene The reported literature on m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol/propene is listed in Table 2. Velu and Sivasanker reported the m-cresol/iso-propanol alkylation over Mg–Al hydrotalcites in a packed bed reactor and a temperature range of 250–450 °C [61]. They explained that these hydrotalcites are efficient catalysts as they generate acid-base sites due to defects generated from dissolution of some Al3+ in MgO lattice. Grabowska et al. investigated the gas phase m-cresol/iso-propanol alkylation over Fe loaded with Cr, Si, K oxides [62]. They suggested that the basic sites of iron enables the adsorption of m-cresol ring vertically and favors the ortho-substitution of hydroxyl group. Grabowska et al. also conducted the same reaction over ZnAl2O4 spinels with ZnO:Al2O3 molar ratio 1:1 prepared by using different precursors, basic aluminium chloride and aluminium hydroxide [27]. Lower reaction temperature was found to be non-selective for thymol formation, when compared to higher reaction temperature. A more efficient catalyst is the one that was prepared from basic aluminium chloride precursor which gives Lewis acid sites alongwith some weak basic sites. Thymol was produced efficiently with selectivity of 88.4% from iso-propanol-free m-cresol conversion of ~78%. Umamaheshwari et al. reported gas-phase iso-propylation of m-cresol over Al–MCM-41 (Si/Al = 59, 103, 202) [28]. Their highest m-cresol conversion was achieved at 300 °C (55%) but the catalytic activity was better in case of Al-MCM-41 (59) because of more number of acidic sites than Al-MCM-41 (103) and Al-MCM-41 (202). Time-on-stream study showed a 55% conversion in the 1st hour that decreased to ~10% conversion in 3 h until 10 h at a 1:4 reactant mole ratio. Shanmugapriya et al. explained that the iso-propanol used as alkylating agent by Umamaheshwari et al. poses a problem of clustering around the acidic sites without getting easily dissociated into iso-propyl cation [28,63]. To avoid this, they suggested replacing iso-propanol with iso-propyl acetate, which could make its adsorption via unhindered carbonyl group followed by release of iso-propyl cation and thus performed m-cresol alkylation over Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al = 55, 104) catalysts to produce thymol. Yadav and Pathre reported m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol over superacidic UDCaT-4, UDCaT-5, and UDCaT-6 catalysts [64]. They found highest reactant conversion over UDCaT-5 followed by UDCaT-6, UDCaT-4, and least over sulfated zirconia. They attributed this higher catalytic performance of UDCaT-5 to its high sulfur content (9% S) as well as its tertragonal phase as opposed to sulfated zirconia (4% S). They used iso-propanol as the limiting reactant and calculated its conversion to be 92% with thymol selectivity to be 79% over UDCat-5. Amandi et al. performed continuous flow alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol and propene in a supercritical CO2 reaction medium over Lewis acidic γ-Al2O3 and Brønsted acidic Nafion SAC-13 catalysts to synthesize thymol [65]. They claimed that the supercritical CO2 has the following advantages over commonly used organic solvents: increase in reaction rate, better diffusion of mass and heat, and increased catalyst lifetime by extraction of coke precursors. They suggested that the reaction proceeded by direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation over Brønsted acidic Nafion SAC-13 which gives lower thymol selectivity (61.2%), whereas, the reaction occurred through Fries-like rearrangement in the presence of Lewis acidic γ-Al2O3 with thymol selectivity (78.6%) as shown in Fig. 4 . Vinu et al. used mesoporous SBA-15 loaded with Al (Si/Al = 45, 136, 215) in the vapour-phase m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol [66]. They observed maximum m-cresol conversion (~73%) over large pored Al-SBA-15 (45), and optimized the reaction parameters for the maximum yield of thymol over this catalyst. They compared the catalytic activity with Al-MCM-41 (25), and observed that despite being more acidic than Al-SBA-15 (45) (0.36 mmol g−1), Al-MCM-41 (25) (0.69 mmol g−1) gave lower reactant conversion (59.6%) which they attributed to the hydrophobic property the catalyst. Al-SBA-15 (45) being more hydrophobic, attracted and chemisorbed the partly hydrophobic iso-propyl cation better, thus, improving the reactant conversion. Ali and Gaikar reported results of thymol synthesis over carbonized sulfonic acid catalysts using microwave irradiation [67], wherein, almost 100% m-cresol conversion was reached in 180 s contact time with the radiation asthe catalysts achieved very fast activation by the microwave radiation, which affected the reaction rate. They could also suppress the undesired side reactions by monitoring the reactants flow rate during the reaction. Nie and Resasco investigated the m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol, propene, and n-propanol over H-Beta [68]. They observed that in all the experiments, propene was the actual alkylating agent as dehydration of alcohol was found to be faster than the alkylation. They used a two-staged reactor, in which the first bed was used to hydrogenate aldehydes and ketones into alcohol over metal catalysts while the second bed was used for alkylation over H-Beta. The H-Beta was deactivated at temperature 200 °C. The iso-propanol gave the better activity (60% conversion) owing to its faster dehydration as compared to n-propanol (35% conversion). Zapata et al. prepared organosilane functionalized HY zeolites to increase their hydrophobicity and stability in hot water [69]. The functionalization stabilized the oil and water phase emulsions and enabled the catalyst to alkylate m-cresol with iso-propanol at higher temperatures in liquid phase without altering their structure as compared to HY. The hydrophobic functionality at the outer surface restricts the zeolite to come in contact with bulk water, thereby, averting the framework collapse during the reaction. Malkar and Yadav further modified the sulfated zirconia by adding titania and preparing zirconia-titania mixed sulfated oxides and used it in the continuous phase m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol [70]. They explained that sulfated zirconia produces SOx and H2S in reduced environment and deactivates at high temperature. Hence, they prepared sulfated ZrO2–TiO2 (1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 mol ratio with acid densities of 0.26, 0.21, and 0.48 mmol g−1, respectively). The higher catalytic activity was observed in case of 2:1 sulfated ZrO2–TiO2, owing to its higher acid site density. Teodorescu et al. reported solvent-free m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol over highly acidic resins under microwave irradiation and also with furnace heating [71]. The comparison shows that 2-iso-propyl-3-methylphenol (least stable compound) was observed in microwave heating which indicates that microwave heating prevents the decomposition of thermally unstable compounds. A temperature of 180 °C, 5:1 reactant mole ratio, and 0.05 g cm−3 catalyst loading gave thymol selectivity as 34.3% (microwave) and 57.8% (conventional). Some reports on the homogeneous phase alkylations using ionic liquids (IL) as catalysts have been reported in m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol. Gunaratne et al. used chloroindate(III) IL to catalyze m-cresol alkylation with propene which resulted in a thymol yield of 12% [55]. Liu et al. reported this reaction over amine-based SO3H-functionalized ILs to achieve higher catalytic activity. Trimethyl base IL gave high m-cresol conversion (77.7%) and selectivity to (48.7%) [72]. Patra et al. reported several amine-based and imidazole-based SO3H-functionalized ILs containing different metal salt ions as anionic moiety and concluded that triethyl amine-based IL with ZnCl3 anion was highly efficient in this reaction [73]. They proposed the reaction scheme as shown in Fig. 5 . We have earlier reported the selective thymol synthesis by gas-phase m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol using metal loaded zeolite catalysts [74,75]. Zinc loaded HY showed excellent catalytic performance as compared to other zinc loaded zeolites like Zn loaded H-ZSM5, H-BEA, H-MCM-22, etc. and also several I and II groups metal loaded HY. The Lewis and Brønsted acidity as well as pore dimensions of HY were tuned by loading different amounts of zinc to attain m-cresol conversion close to equilibrium conversion (~96%) and selective formation of thymol. The optimum zinc loading for maximum catalytic activity was observed to be 0.99 mmol g−1. The important reaction parameters such as temperature, space velocity, etc. were optimized and their individual and interactive effects on the catalytic activity was also investigated. A 92% m-cresol conversion alongwith 71% thymol selectivity was achieved at optimized reaction conditions of 250 °C, 2.8 h−1 space velocity, and 2/1 reactant molar ratio when 0.99 mmol g−1 Zn2+ were loaded on HY."
6,Mechanistic analysis,"2.3 Mechanistic analysis Mechanistic studies of the alkylation reactions are reported using quantum chemical calculations and/or in situ 13C NMR techniques. Jansang et al. reported the phenol methylation over HY zeolite using our-own-N-layered-integrated molecular orbital (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) plus molecular mechanics (UFF) approach as shown in Fig. 6 [76]. They proposed two pathways: multi-step stepwise and single-step concerted, and elucidated that the methylation preferentially occurs through concerted pathway where adsorbed phenol and methanol reacts directly to give anisole or o-cresol. The transition state energies were estimated to be 28.3 kcal mol−1 for anisole and 32.6 kcal mol−1 for o-cresol formation, making anisole as kinetically favored while o-cresol as thermodynamically stable products. The rate limiting step was found to be the surface methoxide formation with an activation enthalpy of 39.6 kcal mol−1. Ma et al. reported the molecular level mechanistic investigation of phenol alkylation with iso-propene and tri-butene over benzene sulfonic acid to mimic as Amberlyst-15, a cation-exchange resin with the help of an ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory [32]. A combination of two reaction steps was established: first, a neutral-pathway mechanism, where, a sulfonic ester complex directly alkylate phenol to form an early-stage ether and second, an intramolecular alkyl ion rearrangement mechanism from ether to ortho- or para-alkylated products (Fig. 7 ). They calculated ether formation to be energetically favorable with a transition energy of 30 kcal mol−1 in case of iso-propene. Further, they concluded that the alkyl species travels through an array of 1, 2 shifts between substitutive sites on phenol where the ratio of ortho to para products was determined by the acidity i.e. H+ concentration. Hansen et al. investigatedthe alkylation reaction of benzene with ethene over HZSM-5 using DFT at B3LYP/TZVP level of theory [77]. Three cluster models of 3T, 5T and 33 T HZSM-5 framework were analyzed in three reaction mechanisms: two single-step schemes (simultaneous olefin protonation and C–C coupling) differing only by the position of acidic proton pre- and post-reaction, and one two-step scheme (ethoxide intermediate generation which further reacts with benzene giving ethylbenzene). The largest cluster (33T atoms) with smaller reaction barrier showed significant stabilization of the reaction intermediate, beneficial for such reaction investigations. Further, both they concluded reaction pathways contributed well in the overall product formation owing to their similar activation energy values (~20 kcal mol−1). Lei et al. investigated the mechanism of benzene/propene alkylation to form cumene over 5T cluster model of H-beta using DFT simulations approach at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level [78]. In addition, they analyzed the charge transfer by Mulliken population method. Similar to the procedure reported by Jansang et al., they proposed stepwise and one-step reaction mechanisms, and found that the cumene is favourably formed by one-step mechanism (activation energy: 25.4 kcal mol−1) than by stepwise mechanism (activation energy: 70.5 kcal mol−1). The Mulliken charge transfer data revealed that the proton relocated to the zeolite belonged to benzene ring rather than its original Brønsted proton. Similar reports of cumene formation over H-mordenite, Faujasite zeolite, and zeolite cluster AlSi2O4H9 are reported by Rozanska et al., Namuangruk et al., and Vos et al. [79–81]. Patra et al. reported a mechanism of solvent induced p-cresol alkylation with tert-butanol by taking triethylammonium based Brønsted acidic ILs as catalysts using DFT and ab initio methods [82]. They initially described a solvent-free neutral pathway, which led to kinetically controlled O-alkylated product (Fig. 8 ) and later described an ionic pathway with IL and by-product water as solvents, which predominantly formed the thermodynamically favored 2-tert-butyl-p-cresol. The increase in dielectric constant of the reaction media due to presence of water resulted in the rearranged carbocations of ether towards the ortho-position of the cresol ring. Our group has reported a mechanistic investigation of m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol over zinc loaded and unloaded Faujasite frameworks using DFT calculations to examine the role of catalyst on the mechanism of this reaction [83]. The modified catalyst was compared with the parent catalyst on the basis of differences in energetics obtained when the reaction followed a single-step concerted pathway as well as multi-step pathways. Stepwise mechanism was directed towards the generation of iso-propoxide cations whereas, concerted mechanism formed iso-propoxonium species. Both the ionic species proceeded with the C- and O- iso-propylation to form thymol and IPMCE, respectively. Taking adsorption complex as the reference, the transition energy (40 kcal mol−1 for HY and 41 kcal mol−1 for Zn-HY) for iso-propoxide was the limiting step in multi-step route. The activation energies for the next alkylation step were 12 and 13 kcal mol−1 for HY and 9 and 10 kcal mol−1 for Zn-HY during IPMCE and thymol synthesis, respectively. The IPMCE and thymol formed with activation energies of 14.4 and 18.3 kcal mol−1 over HY whereas, 13.6 and 17.7 kcal mol−1, respectively, over Zn-HY by concerted route. These values indicates that the O- and C- alkylation are competitive in nature where thymol is a stable product. Lower activation energy barrier as well as increased heats of the desired reaction is attributed to higher acidity of Zn-HY. Some of the literature reported the dehydration mechanism of alcohol/olefin over different catalysts via the alkoxide formation. In this context, Bhan et al. showed covalent alkoxide species formation by protonation of adsorbed alkylating agent like propene and isomers of hexene over HZSM-5 with the help of DFT (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) [84]. They analyzed the influence of olefin conformation, carbon numbers, cluster size, and alkoxide bonding arrangements and concluded that the protonation energy of olefin was independent of carbon number, site geometry, and bonding location, but is dependent on the location of olefin protonation. They reported a unique path of covalent bonding of alkoxide species with the oxygen supplying Brønsted acid proton rather than with the neighbouring oxygen of the catalytic active sites. Another study reported by Prestianni et al. explains the dehydration of iso-propanol inside 48T HY and 22T H-ZSM-5 cavities and on 26T H-ZSM-5 surface by DFT simulations at B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p) level of theory [85]. They described a similar mechanism of iso-propanol adsorption and protonation on active site of the zeolite and explained that it proceeded by a β-elimination to produce propene and water. Adsorption was found to occur preferentially in the larger HY cavity (−30.1 kcal mol−1) first, then at H-ZSM-5 surface (−18.1 kcal mol−1), and lastly in smaller H-ZSM-5 cavity (−15.1 kcal mol−1). They enumerated the influence of zeolite configuration on the adsorption energy, stability, and transition energies of the species. Further, HY was found to be a suitable catalyst with lower activation energy (47.4 kcal mol−1) as opposed to 22T H-ZSM-5 (49.2 kcal mol−1) and 26T H-ZSM-5 (58.1 kcal mol−1). In another report, Larmier et al. focussed on determining the active site locations on γ-alumina and δ-alumina for propene/di-iso-propyl ether (DIIPE) selectivity in the iso-propanol dehydration step a by combined experimental and DFT protocol [86] Their results showed that the presence of penta-coordinated Al as Lewis acid and a nearby basic site is needed to catalyze the iso-propanol dehydration directly into propene and DIIPE, and the conversion of this ether to propene and iso-propanol, which was efficiently found to be occur on (100) facets. The lower activation energies for the propene formation by E2 mechanism (35.2 kcal mol−1) and DIIPE formation by SN2 mechanism (31.5 kcal mol−1) were due to Lewis acid sites on (100) facet (Fig. 9 ). The higher selectivity to propene was achieved by suitable tuning the temperature, as it is entropically favored (ΔS = −1.9 × 10−3 kcal mol−1 K−1) over DIIPE (ΔS = −8.6 × 10−3 kcal mol−1 K−1). In another set of investigations, in situ NMR spectroscopy technique was used for mechanistic studies of phenolics alkylation reactions. Wang et al. described phenol methylation mechanism over HY zeolite by in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy in a flow reactor [87]. Initially, both anisole and cresols were formed with a similar rate, however, anisole was transformed into cresols at 140 °C, indicating its unstable nature. Polymethylated cresols were formed as secondary products at temperatures higher than 160 °C. The report by Zhao et al. well-described the mechanism involved in the phenol alkylation with cyclohexene and cyclohexanol over H-BEA [88]. They reported an electrophilic substitution of cyclohexyl carbenium species on the phenol's OH group or π electrons in the ring, and negated the occurrence of alkoxonium species. The carbenium ion was generated by olefin via (re)adsorption and protonation irrespective of alkylating species. They have also negated any significant possibility of intramolecular displacement of cyclohexyl phenyl ether leading to formation of C-alkylated compounds."
7,Reaction kinetics analysis,"2.4 Reaction kinetics analysis Several researchers reported the reaction mechanisms of alkylations by performing detailed kinetic investigations and subsequent modeling the experimental data as shown in Table 3 . Yadav and Thorat performed p-cresol alkylation with iso-butene over sulfated zirconia to produce 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, commonly termed as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [89]. They demonstrated Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and Eley-Rideal (ER) based kinetic models in a mass transfer free regime. Their reaction data was found to fit well in the ER model with surface reactions being kinetically controlled. Ojha et al. performed the kinetic rate analysis and modeled phenol alkylation with tert-butanol in a batch reactor over a zeolite catalyst synthesized from fly ash [90]. They observed the reaction to be surface reaction controlled and estimated the kinetic parameters using LHHW kinetic model. Yadav and Pathre evaluated the m-cresol alkylation with tert-butanol over patented UDCat-5 using a second order rate equation model [50]. They also developed a second order kinetic model for the heterogeneous phase m-cresol/iso-propanol alkylation in a batch reactor using the same UDCAT-5 catalyst [64]. Yadav's research group also studied phenol/cyclohexene alkylation reaction over several acidic catalysts like sulfated zirconia, hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), K-10 clay supported dodeca-tungstophospheric acid (DTP), K-10 clay supported DTP with cesium salt, and DTP/HMS [91]. Among these catalysts, 20% DTP/K-10 clay showed better catalytic performance giving high yield of cyclohexyl phenyl ether owing to its narrow pore size. A kinetic model using this catalyst was built to interpret the reaction mechanism and estimate important kinetic parameters. Ali and Malkar developed a kinetic model using LHHW mechanism for the m-cresol iso-propylation over carbonized sulfonic acid resin under microwave irradiation, considering thymol as main product and lumping all the thymol isomers into a set of side products [67]. Borja et al. reported the LHHW and ER kinetics of m-cresol iso-propylation by mixing the reactants with HY zeolite in an organic solvent and performing the reaction in a batch reactor at 200 °C. They lumped the products based on the number of iso-propyl groups on the m-cresol's hydroxyl and/or ring [92]. Malkar et al. investigated the same reaction in a packed bed reactor over sulfated ZrO2–TiO2. They interpreted it as a pseudo-first order reaction by overlooking the limiting alkylating agent in their model [70]. Patra et al. reported a homogeneous phase kinetics for alkylation reaction using a catalyst, triethylamine based [ZnCl3]‒ IL, and estimated the kinetic parameters in the reaction steps [73]. our group has also reported mass transfer resistances free kinetics of m-cresol alkylation reaction over zinc loaded HY [93]. Based on the product distribution in a time-on-stream (TOS) experimental run, LHHW kinetic model was established, which could explain the trend in the experimental data taken in the temperature range of 200, 250, and 300 °C. The catalyst deactivation due to active site and pore blocking by coke, occurred in our experimental investigation of this reaction. However, the catalyst still retained its activity even after 11 h TOS at 250 °C. Whereas, simply the large pore HY was found to be rapidly deactivating by about 4 h TOS at 250 °C."
8,Outlook and conclusions,"Bio-oil produced from lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis contains light oxygenates (C1 to C4) which need to be upgraded by C–C coupling reactions for maximum utilization of carbon molecules to form fuel range (C10–C13) hydrocarbons. In this review, the C–C coupling reactions were chosen as the well researched alkylation reactions and these are discussed, in this article, with a focus on of the model phenolic compounds found in bio-oil with the light oxygenates C1–C4 alcohols and olefins also found in the same oil, so that this article can pave a way for efficiently valorizing this bio-oil to renewable products. These alkylations review is categorized into thermodynamic, catalytic activity, mechanistic and kinetic analyses to get a clear picture of the work progressed in this area till date. Several investigators have explained that the alcohol, as alkylating agent, first undergoes dehydration to form olefins, and these olefins are the actual alkylating agents. However, the difficulty in handling gaseous phase olefins and their troublesome transport can be avoided by using alcohols. The literature reports have missed detailed analysis of thermodynamic equilibria of various reaction steps in alkylations. This information gap is a significant hurdle in process design and detailed engineering for scale-up and commercialization of bio-oil upgradation technology. Detailed structure-activity relationships of promising catalysts including in-situ operando investigations for a rational catalyst design and its large scale synthesis is yet needed for these important reactions. Further, detailed deactivation kinetics of such reactions are which are essential for the process scale-up also needs to be taken-up in future seriously so that a comprehensive investigation and process analysis of this C–C coupling reaction will aid in the development of an integrated process design for an efficient large scale valorization of second generation biomass-derived pyrolysis bio-oil to produce liquid biofuel and value-added chemicals."
