0,Introduction,"To solve energy crisis in the future, hydrogen production via photocatalysis is viewed as an ideal fuel source among several sustainable hydrogen production techniques [1–3]. In photocatalytic reaction, cocatalyst plays a critical role in obtaining hydrogen efficiently, because cocatalyst can not only separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also provide active sites for H2 evolution [4,5]. Noble metals such as Pt and Au are usually used as cocatalysts for conventional photocatalysis [6–8]. However, as a the high-cost and scarce resource, noble metal is not a good choice for commercial development and large-scale applications of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Hence, exploring low-cost and earth-abundant alternative materials is still a challenging research. MoS2, a non-noble-metal cocatalyst, has been widely investigated as a promising substitute of Pt for photocatalytic HER [9,10]. However, fewer reports focus on MoSe2 cocatalyst for photocatalytic HER because of the low utilization of active sites [11]. In fact, MoSe2 has some intriguing characteristics, that are propitious to many energy applications. For instance, compared with MoS2, MoSe2 has more metallic nature which results in the higher electrical conductivity [12,13]. Taking full advantage of the active sites (basal plane and the edge sites) of MoSe2 is the key to improve its catalytic activity. MoSe2 exhibits two phases: 2H phase of semiconductor properties and 1T phase of metallic properties. Both theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed that both the basal plane and the edge of 1T-MoSe2 have high catalytic activity, while the 2H-MoSe2 is catalytically active in edges [14–16]. However, the studies about the active sites of the mixed phase (1T/2H) MoSe2 are still indistinct. It is widely acknowledged that CdS with band gap of 2.4 eV has been proven to be a potential semiconductor for visible-light-driven photocatalysis [17–19]. Semiconductor heterostructures such as CdS-CdSe are the powerful mean for efficient charge separation because the holes are confined to CdSe [20,21]. Inspired by this design, MoSe2 cocatalyst loaded on CdS-CdSe has been designed, that helps to separate and trap the photo-generated charge carriers, meanwhile, the MoSe2 can also provide the highly active sites for hydrogen evolution. However, exploring simple and effective methods for large-scale preparation of 1T phase MoSe2 is still a challenge. Very recently, Yin et al reported a phase engineering method of MoSe2 utilizing NaBH4 as reductant, which lead to the transition of 2H-1T phase of the MoSe2 [22]. It is believed that hydrothermal synthesis using reductant is a simple and promising method for preparing MoSe2 with high content of 1T phase [23]. In this work, the motivation is to figure out the best HER active sites of mixed phase MoSe2, which should have more active sites than 2H-MoSe2 and 1T-MoSe2. The research method is to firstly identify the highly active sites of mixed phase MoSe2 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and then design the corresponding materials for photocatalytic HER experimental verification [24]. Hence, the structure regulation of MoSe2/CdS-CdSe composite photocatalyst and phase modulation of MoSe2 were achieved successfully through a hydrothermal method using the different amounts of hydrazine monohydrate. The prepared (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe catalyst with active sites in basal plane and edge (100 facet) exhibited the distinguished photocatalytic H2 evolution and photoelectric performance [25]. The transfer of photo-generated charge carriers and photocatalytic mechanism was also investigated. And the HER volcano plot for various kinds of sites of 1T-MoSe2, 2H-MoSe2 and mixed phase MoSe2 was ascertained for the first time."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of samples,"2.1 Preparation of samples 2.1.1 Preparation of CdS NRs CdS NRs were prepared by hydrothermal method in previous research [26]. 4.5 g of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 4.5 g of NH2CSNH2 were added into 60 ml of ethylenediamine with magnetic stirring for 1 h in 100 ml Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out in an oven at 160 °C for 24 h. The resultant samples were collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water and ethanol before dried at 60 °C for 12 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe 100 mg of CdS NRs powder, 61 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O and 40 mg of Se powder were put into 60 ml of mixed aqueous solution of DI water and hydrazine monohydrate with strong agitation for 1 h. The above solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-linked steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 8 h. The obtained samples were washed with deionized water for several times. After drying for 12 h, the (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe samples were obtained. The usage amounts of hydrazine monohydrate were V = 5, 10, 15 and 20 ml, and the resulting samples were labeled as MCCS-5, MCCS-10, MCCS-15 and MCCS-20, respectively. 2.1.3 Preparation of CdS-CdSe and MoSe2 CdS-CdSe was prepared similar to that of (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe without adding Na2MoO4·2H2O and MoSe2 was also prepared without adding CdS NRs powder."
3,Material characterizations,"2.2 Material characterizations The morphologies and microstructures of the photocatalyst were acquired by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Philips FEI Quanta 200 FEG) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on Thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al Kα X-ray, using to investigate the phase content, the surface properties and to discuss the density of the state distribution (DOS) in the valence band. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed by a Hitachi U3010. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) with the excitation wavelength of 380 nm were collected on Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The actual chemical compositions were tested by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS, Z-2000, Hitachi). 1 mg of sample was thoroughly dissolved in 3 ml of aqua regia, after cooling to the room temperature, the above solution was diluted with deionized water to 10 ml in a volumetric flask. This solution was used for AAS."
4,Photoelectrochemical property measurements,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical property measurements Photoelectrochemical measurements were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760) with a three-electrode system. The reference electrode, counter electrode and electrolyte were using Ag/AgCl, platinum foil and 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. All the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed under the continuous illumination of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE) with 420 nm cut off filter. A typical preparation for the working electrodes is as follows: 1 mg photocatalyst and 20 μL of naphthol were dispersed in 200 μL of absolute ethyl alcohol, followed by sonicating for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then 25 μL of solution was dispersed onto the conductive FTO glass with an effective area of 3 cm2. Finally, the FTO glass was heated under a constant temperature of 80 °C for 3 h. Transient photocurrent responses were under 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz–10 kHz with 10 mV oscillation amplitude. The Mott–Schottky plots were acquired at 1000 Hz."
5,Photocatalytic activity evaluations,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity evaluations The photocatalytic H2 evolution tests were carried out in a closed gas-circulating CEL-SPH2N photocatalytic H2 evolution system (Au-Light, China). 5 mg of as-prepared sample was added to 80 ml of 10% lactic acid aqueous solution, followed by sonicating for 10 min. The light source was 300 W Xe lamp equipped with optical 420 nm cut off filter. Photocatalytic reaction was carried out under vacuum environment of less than −0.09 Mpa with magnetic stirring. Fuli GC-9790 on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector was used to analyze the photocatalytic H2 production. The AQE (apparent quantum yield) was calculated according to the following equation: AQE \% = Number of reacted electrons Number of incident photons × 100 = Number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 Number of incident photons × 100"
6,Computational methods,"2.5 Computational methods Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed with DMol3 package [27] to evaluate the hydrogen adsorption activities on different molybdenum selenide configurations. The exchange-correlation was PBE and the basis set was DNP. DSPPs was chosen as the core treatment. The correction based on Grimme’s method [28] was adopted for the dispersion interaction. The atomic cutoff was set to 5.0 Å for all elements. The k-point was 8 × 8 × 1. Also, the water solvent effect was considered by COSMO solvation model [29] with a dielectric constant of 78.54. The electron in all calculations was spin-polarized. Both the self-consistent field calculation and the geometry optimization were tightly converged. The unit cells of 2H-MoSe2 and 1T-MoSe2 were constructed according to the analogous 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2 cells. The S atoms were replaced by Se atoms, followed by the cell optimization. The mixed phase MoSe2 (Mixed-MoSe2) was constructed by the combination of two cells with a ratio of 1:1. The optimized structures and parameters were shown in Fig. S1. The unit cells were enlarged to a (3 × 3 × 2) supercell for 1T-MoSe2, a (3 × 3 × 1) supercell for 2H-MoSe2 and a (3 × 3 × 1) supercell for mixed-MoSe2, and all supercells were introduced with a vacuum layer of 25 Å along c-axis. Thus, the aforementioned pure phase MoSe2 structures consist of two layers, while the mixed-MoSe2 structure includes three layers, as shown in Fig. S2. The structures mentioned above were used as the basal plane models for H-adsorption on MoSe2. Accordingly, the edge sites exist based on the (1 0 0) facet. Similar operations were applied to the MoSe2 configurations to obtain the edge models, where four layers were reserved, as shown in Fig. S3. During the hydrogen adsorption optimization, the bottom one layer in basal planes models were fixed and the bottom two layers in edge models were constrained. The optimized hydrogen adsorption configurations on various MoSe2 are shown in Fig. S4."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Computational results,"3.1 Computational results To illuminate the effect of structures of MoSe2 on photocatalytic activity, the Gibbs free energy changes of elemental steps for HER on edge and basal plane of 1T-MoSe2, 2H-MoSe2 and mixed phase MoSe2 are summarized in Fig. 1 a. The optimized configurations are shown in Figs. S1–S4, involving 2H, 1T, and mixed phase MoSe2 structures and the corresponding hydrogen adsorption structures. The relative Gibbs free energy Δ G H 0 of the adsorption of atomic hydrogen is critical to estimate the HER activity, where the Δ G H 0 of the optimal catalyst for HER should be close to 0 [30]. The DFT calculations clearly display that the basal plane of 2H-MoSe2 is relatively difficult for atomic hydrogen adsorption, and meanwhile, the 1T-MoSe2 basal plane strongly adsorbs the atomic hydrogen, both of which are not favorable for HER. For the basal plane of mixed phase MoSe2 (2H:1T = 1:1), the hydrogen adsorption energy is compromised, suggesting an enhanced catalytic activity than 1T and 2H MoSe2 basal planes. For the edge in mixed phase MoSe2, both 2H and 1T sites are involved into hydrogen adsorption. The 1T edge in mixed phase provides a higher activity compared to the pure 1T phase, which may be caused by the synergistic interaction with 2H layer. It is worth noting that the edge of 2H-MoSe2 shows the highest HER activity among all the structures. Overall, a volcano-like correlation quantitatively illustrates the potential catalytic activity relationship of those active sites in MoSe2, as shown in Fig. 1b. The mixed phase MoSe2 denotes the excellent HER performance both in the basal plane and the edge, which can provide more active sites and rational overpotential for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Moreover, the catalytic activity of mixed phase MoSe2 is close to Pt (by Jin et al) [31]."
9,Structure characterizations,"3.2 Structure characterizations Based on the above analysis, the 1T/2H MoSe2/CdS-CdSe (MCCS-x for short, x represented the volume of hydrazine monohydrate) with active sites in both the basal plane and the edge was prepared using hydrazine monohydrate as reductant, this innovative preparation process is shown in Fig. 2 a. Hydrazine monohydrate is decomposed to N2, NH3 and H2 under high pressure and temperature in hydrothermal process. Then, the CdS is slightly reduced by the right amount of H2, which is resulted in the S vacancies. And the S vacancies is crucial to the generation of CdSe [32]. In the meantime, the hydrazine monohydrate as reductant is help to prepare the mixed phase MoSe2. As shown in Fig. 2b, the XRD pattern of CdS NRs indicates the pure hexagonal phase of CdS (JCPDS card no. 41-1049) [33]. The characteristic diffraction peaks of CdSe are also found (JCPDS card no. 08-0459) in all the MCCS samples. The MCCS-10 shows a strongest characteristic peak of CdSe among all the samples. The content of Mo increases when the usage of hydrazine monohydrate increases, as shown in Table 1 . Furthermore, in contrast to the CdS NRs, the diffraction peaks of all the MCCS samples move toward higher angles of CdS, due to the apparent interfacial interaction resulting from the MoSe2 deposition in different concentrations of hydrazine hydrate [20,34], as shown in Fig. 2b (inset). However, there are no diffraction peaks of MoSe2 in the XRD patterns of MCCS, which are possibly caused by low diffraction intensity of MoSe2 due to its low crystallinity compared with CdS [35,36]. The morphology information of as-samples is revealed by SEM and TEM. Figs. S5a and b show that the CdS is synthesized in the form of nanorod. The MoSe2 exhibits the morphology of the graphene-like and layered nanosheets, which are loaded on the surface of CdS NRs (Fig. 1c). The lattice spacings of 0.65 nm and 0.316 nm are assigned to (0 0 2) facet of MoSe2 and (1 0 1) facet of CdS, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2d [11,14]. The nanolayer of CdSe covered on the surface of CdS NRs is observed, where the red line designates the CdSe nanolayer (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the (1 0 0) facet with highly active edges for catalytic activity and the (0 0 2) facet with basal phase of MoSe2 are observed, as shown in Fig. 2f. The EDX element mappings in Fig. 2g are used to confirm that the Se element are distributed within the CdS, indicating the existence of CdSe. These results indicate that the MoSe2/CdS-CdSe structure with (1 0 0) facet of edge sites and (0 0 2) facet [37,38] of basal phase of MoSe2 are successfully synthesized by using hydrazine monohydrate as precursor. Fig. S5c indicates that the crystal lattice of CdS have not changed after treated by hydrazine monohydrate. Fig. S5d further illustrates that the compact interface between CdS and MoSe2 is formed, which is beneficial for the electrons transfer from CdS to MoSe2. XPS spectra of Cd 3d, S 2p and Se 3d for MCCS-10 are presented in Fig. S6. The Cd 3d XPS spectrum with two doublets is shown in Fig. S6a, the binding energies at 412.1 eV and 405.4 eV correspond to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 of Cd2+. In Fig. S6b, the binding energies of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 correspond to 163.2 eV and 161.8 eV respectively. And a pair of peaks at 165.9 eV and 160.4 eV correspond to Se 3p1/2 and Se 3p3/2 of Se2- [39,40], respectively, which demonstrates the existence of CdSe [41]. As shown in Fig. 3 , for all the MCCS samples, a peak attributing to Mo6+ at 235.7 eV for Mo 3d is found, which comes from the excess Na2MoO4. A clear S 2 s peak at 226.1 eV from CdS is observed in both the pure CdS and MCCS samples [42], as shown in Fig. S6c and Fig. 3. The peaks of 1T and 2H phase of MoSe2 are obtained after the deconvolution of Mo 3d peaks, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1. The binding energies at 228.3 eV for Mo 3d5/2 and 231.4 eV for Mo 3d3/2 are attributed to 1T-MoSe2, and the binding energies at 229.3 eV for Mo 3d5/2 and 232.7 eV for Mo 3d3/2 are attributed to 2H-MoSe2 [11,22]. Similarly, for the Se 3d spectrum after deconvolution (Fig. S6d), the binding energies at 55.5 eV and 53.4 eV for Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 correspond to 2H-MoSe2, and the binding energies at 54.7 eV and 53.6 eV for Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 correspond to 1T-MoSe2 [42]. It can be concluded that the (1T/2H) MoSe2 can be successfully synthesized under the hydrazine monohydrate. Furthermore, the XPS and Raman spectra of pure (1T/2H) MoSe2 without CdS are shown in Fig. S7. The Mo 3d peaks of 1T and 2H phase of MoSe2 are found in pure MoSe2, indicating the hydrazine monohydrate plays an important role in forming the mixed phase MoSe2. Raman peaks at 195 cm−1 (J1), 350 cm−1 (J2) for 1T phase MoSe2 and 283 cm−1 (E1 2g) for 2H phase MoSe2 are observed, which also suggests the existence of 1T phase in MoSe2. XPS is not only recorded to confirm the mixed phase composition of MoSe2, but also used to quantify the content of the 1T phase, as shown in Table 1. With the amounts of hydrazine monohydrate increasing, the content of the 1T phase decreases from a maximum of 66.50% for MCCS-10 to a minimum of 49.75% for MCCS-20. AAS is carried out to further understand the actual chemical compositions of MCCS samples (Table 1)."
10,Optical property and photocatalytic performances,"3.3 Optical property and photocatalytic performances The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S8a) prove that CdS NRs exhibit an absorption edge at about 516 nm, and the Tauc plots (Fig. S8b) indicate a band gap of 2.41 eV. The as-prepared samples show good absorption in the 520–800 nm region [43]. It is because that the black MoSe2 loading can lead to a large increase in the absorption in the range of 520–800 nm. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity over all the samples under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) was carried out, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The pure CdS displays a poor photocatalytic performance, due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [44]. After the hydrothermal treatment using hydrazine monohydrate as reductant, the photocatalytic activity of MCCS samples significantly enhanced. The amounts of reductant have a conspicuous impact on the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of MCCS samples. The MCCS-5 has the fast photocatalytic H2 evolution rate in the first two hours, however, the rate slows down in the next three hours due to its instability, as shown in Fig. S9a. It is because of the low loading amount of CdSe (Table 1, Se amount is only 7.09%). The MCCS-10 sample has the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, reaching a maximum value of 24.34 mmol h−1 g−1, which is a very efficient photocatalyst compared with the other similar composites (Table S2). The enhanced photocatalytic activity is caused by the following three factors: (i) the highest content of 1T phase MoSe2 (66.50%) as electron traps and active sites, (ii) the abundant highly active site in both basal plane and the edge of MoSe2 and (iii) the formation of more CdSe as hole traps. For the MCCS-15 and MCCS-20, a decrease in the photocatalytic performance is observed. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of MCCS-20 decreases to 15.17 mmol h−1 g−1. It is reasonable because the decrease of the CdSe and 1T phase MoSe2 in MCCS-15 and MCCS-20 compared with MCCS-10. MoSe2 itself is not active for photocatalytic H2 evolution (Fig. S9b), which indicates that the improvement of photocatalytic performance is due to synergy between the MoSe2, CdS and CdSe. Additionally, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates and the AQE based on different wavelengths (500, 520, 550 and 600 nm) was carried out, and the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.10 mmol h−1 g−1 and the impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 28.5% are obtained at 500 nm (close to absorption edge), as shown in Fig. 4b. This AQE is excellent in noble metal-free photocatalyst systems. The recycling test for MCCS-10 sample shows a small photoactivity loss (decreased by after four cycles lasting for 20 h, as shown in Fig. 4c. The used MCCS-10 after recycling test was analyzed by XPS, as shown in Figs. S10a–c. After the photocatalytic H2 evolution for 20 h, the content of the 1T phase MoSe2 of MCCS-10 decreases from 66.5% to 57.5% (Fig. S10a), which may lead to the decrease of HER performance. While, the Cd 3d and S 2p XPS remain basically unchanged. Furthermore, XRD patterns of MCCS-10 are almost the same before and after recycling test (Fig. S10d), indicating the unchanged basic structure of CdS. However, the AAS analysis of MCCS-10 after recycling test shows that the contents of Mo, Se, Cd and S are 3.92, 4.02, 10.27, 42.01, and 43.70%, respectively. The content of S decreases from 48.26% to 43.70% (Table 1). The decrease of S is caused by the partial photo-corrosion, which would lead to performance degradation. To further validate the experimental trend in hydrogen evolution, the corresponding configurations of mixed phase MoSe2 with hydrogen adsorbed and the theoretical overpotentials for HER at different ratios of 2H to 1T based on DFT calculations are as shown in Fig. 4d. The calculated intrinsic catalytic activity reaches the peak when the ratio of 2H to 1T is 1:2 (i.e. 66% of 1T in mixed phase). Although the intrinsic activity is inferred to increase at a low content of 1T, the apparent catalytic performance is still inhibited because the number of active sites also contributes to the total catalytic activity. The transient photocurrent response and EIS under visible light illumination were used to explore reasons for the significant improvement of the photocatalytic activity for MCCS samples. As shown in Fig. 5 a, MCCS-10 displays the highest current density under visible-light illumination, corresponding to the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate [45]. The MCCS-10 is more resistant to the charge recombination, that is because the holes are confined to CdSe while the electrons are confined to MoSe2. Similarly, MCCS-10 exhibits the smallest hemicycle and lowest interfacial charge-transfer resistance in the EIS Nyquist plot (Fig. 5b) among all the samples, demonstrating the lowest charge transfer resistance. The resistance is significantly lower under illumination than in the dark (Fig. S11), indicating that the interface resistance decreases due to the accumulation of photoelectrons at the interface between MoSe2 and CdS [46]. These results show that the loading of MoSe2 and CdSe can accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges."
11,Photocatalytic reaction and electron transfer mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic reaction and electron transfer mechanism To probe the photocatalytic reaction and electron transfer mechanism, the contrast sample CdS-CdSe is synthesized. The XRD pattern of CdS-CdSe indicates the existence of CdSe (Fig. S12), which is proved by XPS (Fig. S13). The excess elemental Se in CdS-CdSe is confirmed by XRD and XPS. The light absorption intensity of CdS-CdSe rapidly increases at 740 nm (Fig. S14a). And this phenomenon is also found in MCCS-10, which is caused by the CdSe. The valence-band XPS spectrum was applied to measure the density of states of valence band (VB) of the samples [47], as shown in Fig. 6 a. The CdS displays the edge of the VB at about 0.99 eV. And the band gap of CdS is 2.41 eV from the Tauc plots (Fig. S14b) [48], hence, the conduction band (CB) minimum of CdS occur at −1.42 eV under the vacuum level. For the CdS-CdSe, the VB is at about 0.76 eV while the CB is at −1.31 eV, which are caused by the narrow bandgap of CdSe. Therefore, it can be derived that the CBs of CdS and CdSe are relatively similar (their energy difference of CBs is 120 meV). Fig. S15 shows the band structure of MCCS, the electron of CB of CdSe is expected to be transferrable to that of CdS due to the small energy difference [49]. The flat band energies versus Ag/AgCl obtained from the Mott-Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 6b. Fermi levels vs. NHE (Ag/AgCl is about 0.197 eV vs. NHE) of CdS, MCCS-10 and CdS-CdSe are −0.484 eV, −0.321ev and −0.332 eV, respectively (compensation potential about 0.025 eV under room temperature). Compared with CdS, the Fermi level changes of MCCS-10 and CdS-CdSe are caused by the CdSe, and the MoSe2 hardly changes the Fermi level. The PL spectra in Fig. 6c show that MCCS-10 have the lower emission intensity, implying that MoSe2 and CdSe effectively facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the CdS. Fig. 6d shows that CdS-CdSe has low activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution, compared with MCCS-10, although the photocurrent of CdS-CdSe is not very low (Fig. 6c inset). It is because of the absence of active sites for hydrogen evolution in CdS-CdSe. The MCCS-10 is highly active for photocatalytic H2 evolution because that the photo-generated electrons transfer to MoSe2 cocatalyst and both the basal plane and the edge of (1T/2H) MoSe2 are the favorable sites for photocatalytic H2 evolution. In our latest work [50], we have proven that the photogenerated electron would transfer to mixed phase MoS2 from TiO2. Perdew-Burke-Enzerh (PBE) exchange-correlation functional is used to figure out that the band structure of 1T-MoSe2 and 2H-MoSe2, as shown in Fig. 6e and 6f. The 1T-MoSe2 represents a conductor, of which Fermi level is calculated to be −4.838 eV. The 2H-MoSe2 represents a semiconductor, of which CB and VB are −4.233 eV and −5.419 eV, respectively. Hence, the photogenerated electrons from CdS prefer to be transferrable to 1T-MoSe2, because of the more negative Fermi level. Furthermore, compared with the CB of 2H-MoSe2 which is occupied by photogenerated electron, the unoccupied 1T-MoSe2 is more likely to accept the photogenerated electron. The whole band structure of MoSe2/CdS-CdSe is shown in Fig. S15. An illustration concerning the band structures and the electron-hole transport processes is presented in Fig. 6g. The photogenerated electrons which excited from the VB to the CB of the CdS and CdSe transfer to the mixed phase MoSe2. And the 1T phase in mixed phase MoSe2 provides the highly active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in both the basal plane and the edge. The photogenerated holes are confined in CdSe, where the oxidation reaction takes place. This MoSe2/CdS-CdSe structure can not only facilitate charge separation and efficient electron transfer, but also provide the abundant active sites for H2 evolution."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, DFT calculations indicated that both the basal plane and the edge of mixed phase MoSe2 provide the highly catalytic activity for HER. A volcano-like correlation has presented for the first time to illustrate the effect of structures of MoSe2 on photocatalytic activity for HER. Therefore, the mixed phase MoSe2 was designed as an excellent cocatalyst because of superior ability to receive electrons and optimal active sites for HER. Based on this, the (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe photocatalyst was successfully designed and synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method using the hydrazine monohydrate as reductant. The phase modulation of 1T in MoSe2 was also achieved by adjusting usage amount of the hydrazine monohydrate, which is in favor of increasing the 1T phase content and electric conductivity. The results showed that the H2 evolution rate of the MCCS-10 is 24.34 mmol h−1 g−1 and a high quantum efficiency of 28.5% at 500 nm. This work not only confirms the photogenerated electron-hole transfer mechanism, but also provides simple method to prepare ternary (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe structure for efficient photocatalytic H2 production."
