0,Introduction,"With the growth of world population, the impact of global warming and the depletion of petroleum fuels, people are facing threats from food, energy and environment. In recent years, microalgae which were widely distributed in aquatic environment have attracted attention because of their ability as cell factories for various natural products (Manirafasha et al., 2018). Euglena gracilis is a common freshwater microalga, and viable with both phagotrophic and phototrophic modes. E. gracilis can produce a large number of products with high nutritional value or economic benefits, such as β-1,3-glucan, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, α-tocopherols, chlorophylls, carotenoids and wax esters, etc., used as a promising feedstock in many fields such as food, pharmaceuticals, supplements, animal feed, and cosmetics (Chae et al., 2006; Priyadarshani and Rath, 2012). In addition, its potential as biodiesel or aviation biofuel has also been greatly exploited to increase the lipid content by changing the culture modes (Yamada et al., 2016). However, a number of technical challenges remained before it can be fully applied in the highly competitive biofuel market, including optimization and improvement of culture conditions, complete understanding of the biofuel production mechanisms, and effective techniques for large-scale cultivation of microalgae (Likozar and Levec, 2014; Rodionova et al., 2017; Song and Pei, 2018). Generally, due to the restriction of illumination, conventional autotrophic cultivation has being suffering from the low biomass density, which resulted in the great increase in the cost of microalgae cultivation, and impeded the large-scale commercial algal production (Leite et al., 2015). In face of the increasing market demand for E. gracilis, cost-effective, environment-friendly and practical solution to enhance biomass yield of E. gracilis are expected. Improving the microalgal growth and beneficial metabolites accumulation by additives derived from abandoned biomass was recognized as a cheap and effective strategy (Pittman et al., 2011). It was reported that, 5 g·L−1 steelmaking slag, the industrial by-product, could increase the growth and lipid production of Botryococcus braunii by 1.74 and 2.16 times, respectively, and found that the elusion of iron from the slag played a key role (Nogami et al., 2017). In addition, ferulic acid and phytic acid from agro-waste rice bran were also reported to promote the growth of E. gracilis at most 1.6 and 3.6 times, respectively (Zhu and Wakisaka, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). The former might serve as the available phosphorus source for the growth of E. gracilis, while the latter might play a role similar to phytohormones. Generally, supplementing carbon sources in the microalgal cultivation has been proven to be the most effective method to promote the microalgal growth and increase the final productivity of metabolites, since the algal cells under the mixotrophic culture can yield more ATP and biomass than that under the autotrophic cultivation (Song and Pei, 2018). However, the addition of organic carbon to the microalgae cultures could significantly increase the operational cost. Therefore, exploitation of cheap organic carbon sources from waste biomass is essential. Lignocellulosic biomass widely distributed in land plants is one of the most abundant and renewable carbon resources in nature (Miazek et al., 2014). However, the vast majority of these carbon resources are abandoned. It is a novel and promising method to culture microalgae by using carbon sources derived from lignocellulose materials. The potential of hydrolysates from rice straw and sweet sorghum as cheap carbon sources for microalgae growth have already been explored and the result showed that biomass and lipid production of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella vulgaris were greatly improved under mixotrophic culture with the hydrolysates (Li et al., 2011; Sibi, 2015). Although the glucose in these lignocellulosic hydrolysates can be easily used by microalgae, other pentoses and hexoses are not all fully utilized by microalgae. For example, xylose was reported as a difficult substrate for microalgae growth, and only few species of wild-type microalgae were able to utilize xylose naturally (Yang et al., 2014; Leite et al., 2016). In some cases, toxicity of xylose to some microalgae was even observed, including inhibition of photosynthesis (Hassall, 1958), inactivation of hexokinase inhibiting of glycolysis (Fernandez et al., 1985), and substantial pigment loss (Leite et al., 2016), etc. Hence, screening microalgae strains containing multiple organic carbon metabolism pathways was essential for the production of microalgal biomass using lignocellulosic materials. In this study, two hemicellulose hydrolysate related sugar alcohols, mannitol and xylitol, were selected as the carbon sources for the growth of E. gracilis. Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, which could be produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, macroalgae (especially brown algae), lichens, and many other plants (Ghoreishi and Shahrestani, 2009). It is also the major component of hemicellulose in soft wood (Miazek et al., 2014). However, there have been no reports of utilizing mannitol as the carbon source for the growth of E. gracilis cells (Osafune et al., 1990). The metabolic pathway of mannitol in yeast has been identified, and it is very likely that similar pathways also exist in E. gracilis cells (Ghoreishi and Shahrestani, 2009). In addition, xylitol is a hydrogenated product of xylose, which also has a wide range of sources. In most xylose assimilating microorganisms, xylose was first reduced to xylitol and finally oxidized to xylulose in cells (Yang et al., 2014). However, some microalgae that lack xylose reductase were unable to assimilate xylose, usage of xylitol as the carbon source for microalgae can avoid this disadvantage. Aim of this study is to investigate the availability of mannitol and xylitol to E. gracilis cells and their effects on the metabolites biosynthesis. To better understand the cellular status and physiology in response to different sugar alcohols, cell growth, photosynthetic pigments content and cell morphology were evaluated under mixotrophic cultures with mannitol and xylitol. Furthermore, high-throughput Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) combined with multivariate analysis was used to analyze the changes in the intracellular macromolecular pool, so as to determine the effect of different sugar alcohols on the product biosynthesis of E. gracilis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microalga and culture conditions,"2.1 Microalga and culture conditions Freshwater microalga E. gracilis Klebs (NIES-48) was purchased from National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan. Algal cells were pre-cultured in Cramer–Myers (CM) medium with the following composition (mg·L−1): (NH4)2HPO4, 1000; KH2PO4, 1000; MgSO4·7H2O, 200; CaCl2·2H2O, 20; FeSO4·7H2O, 3; MnCl2·4H2O, 1.8; CoSO4·7H2O, 1.5; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.4; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.2; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.02; Vitamin B12, 0.0005; Thiamine HCl, 0.1. Mannitol and xylitol stock solutions were pre-configured and sterilized by filtering using vaccum filters (Nalgene, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Different concentrations of sugar alcohol solutions were obtained by diluting the pre-configured stock solution with fresh CM medium. When the algal cells entered the exponential growth phase, 10 mL of cell suspension were inoculated to a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and different concentrations of mannitol and xylitol solution and CM medium were added, with a final culture volume of 100 mL. The final concentrations of mannitol and xylitol treatment groups were 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2 and 4 g·L−1. All groups were cultured at 25 ± 1 °C and illuminated by the cool white fluorescent lamps at the light intensity of 5000 lx with a 12–12 h light and dark cycle. To avoid cell aggregation and ensure uniform light exposure, flasks were manually shaken three times per day."
3,Growth parameters,"2.2 Growth parameters Cell density was measured periodically using a hemocytometer (Thoma, Hirschmann, Germany). Aliquot 300 μL of cell suspension from the cultures was picked and 200 μL of ethanol was added to fix the cells. The cell density was counted under the light microscope (Motic, BA210, Japan). Specific growth rate μ (d−1) and doubling time (DT, d) were also calculated according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) (Damiani et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011). (1) μ = ln D 2 - ln D 1 t 2 - t 1 (2) DT = l n 2 / μ where t1 and t2 are the beginning and end times of the log growth phase, and D1 and D2 are the cell density at the time of t1 and t2, respectively. The pH of culture filtrate was regularly determined by pH meter (LAQUA-2103AL, Horiba, Japan). At the end of cultivation, cell dry weight of each group was also measured. Algal cells were harvested by filtering 5 mL of cell suspension through filter paper of which the pore size was smaller than 0.45 μm (GC-50, Advantec, Japan). The deposited cells were rinsed with deionized water twice to remove the remained salts, and then were dried in the oven (AVO-250 N, As one, Japan) at 80 °C overnight. After being transferred to the desiccator and cooled to room temperature, cell dry weight was obtained by calculating the difference between the final and initial weight of the filter papers. In addition to the algal biomass, chlorophyll content and ratio of carotenoids to total chlorophyll were also determined according to modified Lichtenthaler’s method (Lichtenthaler and Wellburn, 1983). Five milliliter of algal suspension was collected by the filtration and harvested cells were washed with deionized water. Hereafter, cells were ground with glass sand and 80% acetone solution was added to extract the pigments. Until the cell debris was colorless, the homogenate of extract was filtered and the filtrate was collected in the volumetric flask and made up to 10 mL with 80% acetone. Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids content (mg·L−1) were determined by the spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV–Vis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at the wavelength of 663 nm, 645 nm and 470 nm, respectively. Their specific content was calculated via Eq. (3), Eq. (4) and Eq. (5). (3) Chl a = 12.21 Abs 663 - 2.81 Abs 646 (4) Chl b = 20.13 Abs 646 - 5.03 Abs 663 (5) C x + c = 1000 Abs 470 - 3.27 Chl a - 104 Chl b / 229 Where Chla , Chlb , and Cx+c denote the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids content, and Abs470 , Abs646 , and Abs663 are the absorbance of extract at the wavelength of 470 nm, 646 nm, and 663 nm, respectively."
4,Quantification of cell morphological changes,"2.3 Quantification of cell morphological changes E. gracilis cells exhibit changes in cell morphologies (such as spindled, spherical, and elongated shapes) in different physiological states, so it is considered as an important indicator to evaluate growth (Li et al., 2017). Cell morphologies of more than 100 cells were observed and recorded by light microscope (BA210, Motic, Japan) and the corresponding software (Motic Image Plus 2.2S). Micrographs were then imported into image processing software ImageJ (open source) and analysis of particle size was carried out. Feret’s diameter (the longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary) denote the cell length, and MinFeret (the minimum caliper diameter) denote the cell width. The ratio of Feret’s diameter to MinFeret is approximated as the cell aspect ratio."
5,Cellular component analysis by FT-IR,"2.4 Cellular component analysis by FT-IR FT-IR spectroscopy analysis was carried out to analyze the changes in intracellular macromolecule pools. As a sensitive and high-throughput technology, FT-IR spectra could reflect the changes in carbon allocation of E. gracilis in response to different external environments and nutrition modes. To better analyze the product biosynthesis in different treatment groups, FT-IR spectroscopy analysis was performed following the method of Meng et al. (2014). Cell samples were collected by centrifuging aliquot 10 mL of cell suspension at 6000 rpm and then rinsed with deionized water for five times to eliminate the interference of mineral salts to the spectra. The washed cells were pre-frozen with liquid nitrogen and then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer (FDU-1200, EYELA, Japan) at −50 °C overnight. Freeze-dried cells were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) powder at a weight ratio of 1:200, and the mixture was ground until the samples were evenly dispersed in KBr. After the mixture powder was pressed into thin sheet by a hand press, the samples were analyzed by the FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet iZ10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The absorbance spectra of samples were acquired in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with 32 scans, and the spectra were narrowed to 1800–1000 cm−1 and then analyzed by the corresponding spectrum software (OMINIC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Spectrum of KBr thin sheet was acquired as the background. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the analysis was repeated three times (n = 9). After the baseline correction and atmospheric correction according to the automatic correction algorithms, the collected spectra were normalized to the amide I band at 1655 cm−1 to eliminate the difference in the deposit thickness (Dean et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2014). Relative lipid and carbohydrate content was accessed by calculating lipid/amide I peak height ratios and carbohydrate/amide I peak height ratios (Driver et al., 2015)."
6,Multivariate statistical analysis,"2.5 Multivariate statistical analysis Myriad changes in product biosynthesis would be caused by different culture modes (such as autotroph, heterotroph and mixotroph) and conditions (such as pH, temperature, light intensity, nutrient concentrations, and air conditions, etc.) (Piligaev et al., 2018). To provide important biochemical information and find further biological evidence, FT-IR spectra combined with multivariate data analysis were performed by SIMCA-P version 13.0 (Umetrics, Sweden). Non-supervised principal components analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed to rapidly compare metabolic fingerprints and observe the discrete trend in metabolites from different culture conditions"
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis All groups were cultured in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Significance was analyzed by the statistical software SPSS version 16.0 (IBM, USA) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the statistical difference in the growth and metabolic parameters at different treatment groups. For pairwise comparisons, post hoc Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test and Tamhane T2 test were used under equal variance and unequal variance conditions, respectively. The significant level was set at P < 0.05."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Growth profiles of E. gracilis with two sugar alcohol treatment,"3.1 Growth profiles of E. gracilis with two sugar alcohol treatment Significant promotion effects on E. gracilis were observed with both mannitol and xylitol as shown in Fig. 1 , but the specific changes in cell density and pH caused by various sugar alcohols were different. Mannitol showed a significant growth promotion effect for E. gracilis at different concentrations (P < 0.05), and it was in a dose-dependent manner. On day 6, the cell density of 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group was 9.05 times higher than that of the control group. Although the promotion effect of 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group decreased somewhat at day 16, which was due to depletion of nutrients in the medium, it was still 4.17 times that of the control group, showing an extremely superior growth promotion. The specific growth rate as shown in Table 1 increased to double while cell doubling time reduced to half at 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group compared to control. However, there was no significant difference in the growth of 2 g·L−1 and 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group (P > 0.05). Both of these two groups reached the end of exponential growth on the 9th day of culture, after which the cell density began to decline. Results of specific growth rate, doubling time and biomass yield were consistent. It indicated that although mannitol could promote the growth of E. gracilis, the amounts of other nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and mineral salts, etc. were limited, therefore the difference of cell density between 2 g·L−1 and 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment groups was not significant. In addition, the pH of the medium (Fig. 1b) was found declined sharply at higher concentrations of mannitol. In the 16-day-culture period, the pH of the 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group decreased from 6.9 to 3.4. Generally, optimal pH for E. gracilis is around 7, and remain stable (or slight decrease) during the growth process as shown in the control group. It was reported that pH of the cultures depended on the culture modes and nutrient concentration (Song and Pei, 2018). Here the metabolic process of the autotrophic cells was different from that of mixotrophic growth by mannitol. The decrease in pH was mainly attributed to the rapid consumption of ammonium salts and increase of carbon dioxide. Due to the decrease in pH, the cultivation with mannitol was considered more suitable for open culture systems since normal bacterial contamination would be suppressed under such an acidic pH (Yamane et al., 2001). Effect of xylitol differed from that of mannitol. On day 2, xylitol showed a concentration-dependent stimulating effect (Fig. 1c), with the highest cell density at 4 g·L−1. The subsequent cell growth showed a lag for about 4 days, suggesting that the E. gracilis cells need an adaption process to xylitol exposure. Similar adaptation phenomenon was reported to occur when cells were exposed to environment changes such as culture medium, pH, temperature, light, etc. (Hurlbert and Bates, 1971; Atta et al., 2013). However, the addition of xylitol significantly extended the lag phase of cells, indicating that E. gracilis need to adjust their physiological state and metabolic mode to adapt to the xylitol environment. After the lag phase, xylitol also showed an excellent promotion effect on E. gracilis growth, but not significant at lower concentrations (P > 0.05). When xylitol concentration increased to 4 g·L−1, cell specific growth rate and dry biomass yield showed the maximum of 0.23 d−1 and 0.70 g·L−1, respectively. The change of pH in xylitol treatment group was much smaller than that of mannitol. The pH remained almost stable under lower concentrations of xylitol treatment, which was similar to the control group, but then slightly decreased to 5.8 in the 4 g·L−1 xylitol group. This is the first report that both mannitol and xylitol serve as carbon sources for promoting growth of E. gracilis, which indicated that the metabolic pathways for both mannitol and xylitol exist in E. gracilis. A metabolic pathway of mannitol to fructose which eventually involved glycolysis has been discovered in some species of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii, and C. continua) (Karsten et al., 1997; Iwamoto et al., 2003) and brown algae (Eisenia bicyclis, and Ectocarpus siliculosus) (Yamaguchi et al., 1969; Michel et al., 2010). Mannitol cycle was known in fungi, and it is highly possible that other microorganisms (such as E. gracilis) also employ similar pathways (Ghoreishi and Shahrestani, 2009). On the other hand, many microalgae species were unable to assimilate xylose, and even photosynthesis was inhibited (Hassall, 1958; Yang et al., 2014). In this study, xylitol serving as the organic carbon source for mixotrophic growth of E. gracilis was observed for the first time. Although E. gracilis showed a long lag phase on xylitol, the final biomass yield was greatly improved (as shown in Table 1). The extension of the lag phase caused by xylitol might be due to the metabolic energy required for E. gracilis cells when xylitol was used as the single substrate to induce the xylitol pathway (Yang et al., 2014)."
10,Analysis of photosynthetic pigments,"3.2 Analysis of photosynthetic pigments The total chlorophyll content and chlorophyll to carotenoids ratio in E. gracilis cells were summarized in Table 2 . The total chlorophyll content increased with the mannitol, which supported the growth promotion effect of mannitol. In addition, the ratio of total chlorophyll to carotenoids was negatively correlated with mannitol concentrations, and decreased from 5.36 in the control group to 3.94 in the 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group. Generally, decrease in chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio is the indicator of senescence, stress or damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Brito et al., 2011). On the one hand, as the chlorophyll structure was sensitive, it would be damaged under pH or osmotic stresses. When the pH was low, the magnesium ions in the porphyrin ring of the chlorophyll molecules would be replaced by hydrogen ions, and the chlorophyll content would decrease (Koca et al., 2007). In addition, mannitol increased osmotic pressure in the medium, which might also decrease the chlorophyll content (Fazeli et al., 2006). On the other hand, carotenoids, as an auxiliary pigment, were able to achieve energy dissipation and chlorophyll protection through non-photochemical quenching. The increase in carotenoids content was the stress response which could help to protect the photosynthesis under pH and osmotic stress (Fazeli et al., 2006; Kepekçi and Saygideger, 2012). Although high concentrations of mannitol treatment lowered the pH and created osmotic stress in the medium led to a decline in chlorophyll to carotenoids ratio, the total production of chlorophyll and biomass content were significantly increased. Thus, mannitol was still considered as an effective growth promotor for E. gracilis cells. For xylitol, the total chlorophyll yield has also been improved, but no significant difference was found in the ratio of chlorophyll to carotenoids, which might be due to the relatively stable pH and osmotic environment in the xylitol treatment group."
11,Quantification of cell morphology,"3.3 Quantification of cell morphology Cell morphology is an important biological indicator of E. gracilis, as it can exhibit different cell aspect ratios in response to physical or chemical perturbations, such as light, temperature, pH, and nutrient concentrations (Li et al., 2017). Physiological response of E. gracilis cells to mannitol and xylitol was different. The median cell aspect ratio at different concentrations of mannitol and xylitol was shown in Fig. 2 . In case of mannitol, the cell aspect ratio increased significantly from 1.37 in the control group to 3.08 in the 2 g·L−1 treatment group. Cell morphology also changed from spindled to elongated shapes. However, under the exposure of xylitol, cell aspect ratio did not change so much even when xylitol concentration increased to 4 g·L−1. The changes in cell morphology might be mainly attributed to the pH decrease during culture with mannitol. E. gracilis is known as an acid-tolerant species, with a viable pH range of 2 to 8 (Danilov and Ekelund, 2001; Yamane et al., 2001). In our previous study, the cell aspect ratio was found increased from 2.42 to 2.96 when the external pH was adjusted from 6.5 to 3.8 using dilute hydrochloric acid, which confirmed the above hypothesis. The external pH of the cultures under xylitol treatment was more stable than that under mannitol treatment, and thereby no special changes in cell morphology were observed with xylitol."
12,Detection of cellular components in E. gracilis by FT-IR,"3.4 Detection of cellular components in E. gracilis by FT-IR The FT-IR spectra of the freeze-dried E. gracilis cells of the control group, 4 g·L−1 mannitol treatment group and 4 g·L−1 xylitol treatment group were analyzed, and major metabolites such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates were well identified. FT-IR spectra in the regions of 1800–1000 cm−1 (biomolecular fingerprint region) with high signal-to-noise were normalized, and bands of functional groups from macromolecules including proteins, lipids and carbohydrates were assigned according to Dean et al. (2010), Driver et al (2015) and Nzayisenga et al. (2018). The bands at 1655 and 1540 cm−1 were assigned to νCO stretching of amide I and δN-H stretching of amide II, respectively, which are both related to proteins. The bands at 1736 cm−1 and 1078 cm−1 ranges were assigned to νCO stretching of lipids and νCOC stretching vibration of carbohydrates, respectively. The main difference between control and sugar alcohols treatment groups was determined in the range of lipids and carbohydrates. Compared with the control group, the spectra bands denoting lipids in both mannitol and xylitol treatment group became more visible at 1736 cm−1, while the peak height of bands denoting carbohydrates at 1078 cm−1 decreased. In Fig. 3 , relative lipid and carbohydrate content were calculated from the ratio of the lipid (1736 cm−1) and carbohydrate band (1078 cm−1) to the amide I band (1655 cm−1), respectively. To our surprise, a significant increase in relative lipid content was observed with both mannitol and xylitol. Compared with the control, the lipid content in algal cells under 4 g·L−1 mannitol and xylitol treatment increased by 1.82 times and 1.49 times, respectively. It might be due these two sugar alcohols provided additional energy and material for biosynthesis of Acetyl-CoA and NADPH, which were important for lipid accumulation in algal cells (Wan et al., 2011). However, the trend of carbohydrate was reversed from that of lipid. Carbohydrate content with mannitol and xylitol treatment groups decreased by 32.30% and 22.67%, respectively compared to control group. The promotion effect of mannitol for lipid production was larger than that of xylitol, but the accumulation of carbohydrates was lower accordingly, which was related to the intracellular carbon balance (Singh et al., 2011). Carbohydrates and lipid triglycerides are energy stores in microalgae and share a common precursor for synthesis, and therefore they can be converted into each other under different conditions. In general, lipids can be accumulated at nutritional deficiencies such as nitrogen (Wang et al., 2013) or phosphorus deficiency (Zhu and Wakisaka, 2019), but at the cost of a reduction in the growth and available biomass. Although different from common approach, these two sugar alcohols were favorable to enhance the lipid yield of E. gracilis without diminishing biomass growth."
13,Differential identification of characteristic metabolites,"3.5 Differential identification of characteristic metabolites Many specific bands in the FT-IR spectra are associated with specific metabolites, especially macromolecules. However, evaluating the changes in metabolites based on band intensity or average absorbance could not reflect the complete available information (Dao et al., 2017). Therefore, multivariate analysis was used to further compare metabolic fingerprints and observe the discrete trend in metabolites from different culture conditions. The effect of mannitol to E. gracilis metabolism was analyzed by non-supervised PCA as shown in Fig. 4 (a). The data were resolved into four major components and the cumulative contribution rate R2X was 0.945. Among them, PC1 accounted for 49.7% of the total variation and PC2 accounted for 35.5%, by which the major of variability was explained. To achieve better visualization of the discriminated sample groups from PCA and further maximize the group separation, the supervised OPLS-DA model was established after orthogonality correction to evaluate the metabolic patterns of E. gracilis with or without mannitol treatment. As seen from Fig. 4(b), the parallelism between the control group (solid black circles) and mannitol treatment group (green triangles) was very good and stable, and a sharp separation between these two groups was observed, which revealed that mannitol induced significant biochemical changes in E. gracilis cells. OPLS-DA gave a good model (1 predictive + 4 orthogonal) with the cumulative contribution rate R2X = 0.981, R2Y = 0.995 and Q2 = 0.983. The predictive variation explained 45.9% of all variation in the data. To avoid the overfitting of the model, a permutation test with 40 permutations (Fig. 4c) was carried out. Generally, the predictive ability of the model would be good when the slope of the two regression lines (R2 and Q2) was big and the intercept was small, which suggested that the model was interpreted by more data (Szymańska et al., 2012). In addition, the difference between R2 and Q2 in this model was small, reflecting the difference between the data explained by the model and the predicted data was also small, demonstrating that the OPLS-DA model was reliable and predictive (Bylesjö et al., 2006). OPLS-DA loading plot as shown in Fig. 4(d) was adopted to find the potential biomarkers (potentially different metabolites) between control group and mannitol treatment group by looking at the most positive and negative loadings in the S-line plot. The positive and negative direction of the loading plot denote the variables that are more prominent in the groups located in the positive and negative direction of the scores plot, respectively (Sitole et al., 2014). As seen from the loading plot of Fig. 4(d), compared with the control group, E. gracilis cells from the mannitol treatment group contained more prominent spectral absorbance in spectral regions of fatty acids (C = O ester functional groups at 1739 cm−1, and CH3 and CH2 bending at 1460 cm−1), amides (N–H bending and C-N stretching vibration from amide II at 1537 cm−1), aromatic compounds (C-N stretching from aromatic amine at 1300 cm−1, and vibrations of aromatic ring at 1180 cm−1), while less prominent spectral absorbance in the regions of carbohydrates (C-O-C stretching at 1155 cm−1, C-O stretching and C-C stretching vibrations at 1111, 1078, and 1045 cm−1, and CH2 bending at 1363 cm−1), ethers (C-O stretching at 1254 cm−1), carboxylates (COO− symmetric stretching at 1410 cm−1, and COO− antisymmetric stretching at 1614 cm−1), as well as the alkene region (C = C stretching at 1672 cm−1). This was consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, which lipids content increased while carbohydrates content decreased under mannitol treatment, but the changes in some other small molecules could also be unveiled. PCA analysis between control and xylitol treatment group was also carried out and the results were shown in Fig. 5 (a). The data were clearly resolved into 3 major components, and PC1 explained 48.3% of all variation and PC2 explained 41.1%. The cumulative contribution rate R2X = 0.948, and Q2 = 0.903, indicating that the established PCA model was of good quality. In order to identify the metabolites responsible for the discrimination of control group and xylitol treatment group, OPLS-DA model was carried out to further maximize the group separation. The model (1 predictive + 2 orthogonal) was good with R2X = 0.97, R2Y = 0.985 and Q2 = 0.977, and permutation test demonstrated its goodness of fit and high predictive capability. As shown in Fig. 5(b), mannitol treatment samples clustered with positive scores and control samples clustered with negative scores. Information from other bands was combined to interpret the most positive and negative bands (Dao et al., 2017). The loading plot revealed the similar result as mannitol treatment, i.e., xylitol treatment resulted in higher levels of lipids, amides and aromatic compounds than that of the control group, while decreased the content of carbohydrates, ethers, carboxylates and alkenes. In addition to that, slight differences at 1390 cm−1 (positive loadings) and 1200 cm−1 (negative) were observed, most probably assigned to S = O stretching from sulfates and C-O stretching from phenols or ethers, respectively. The characteristic metabolites between mannitol and xylitol treatment groups were further investigated and compared by multivariate analysis. The obtained unsupervised PCA (Fig. 6 a) and supervised OPLS-DA (Fig. 6b) models were both of good quality. For OPLS-DA, the predictive variation plus two orthogonal explained 86.2% of all variation in the data, and the permutation test (Fig. 6c) confirmed that the model was not overfitting. The corresponding loading plot showed this separation between mannitol and xylitol treatment samples was caused by bands indicative of carbohydrates (1157, 1107, 1072 and 1051 cm−1), sulfides (1433, 1394 and 1342 cm−1) and amides (1687 and 1660 cm−1) on the positive side (more intense towards xylitol treatment group),and bands indicative of lipids (1728 cm−1) and aromatic ethers and esters (1292, 1263 and 1182 cm−1) on the negative side (more intense towards mannitol treatment group). As a sensitive and high-throughput method, FT-IR combined with multivariate analysis could well reflect the potential differences in metabolites of microalgae cells under different culture conditions and reveal the prominent variables among the metabolites. Both mannitol and xylitol affected the metabolic profiles of E. gracilis especially increased the lipid accumulation in the cells. The differences in metabolites treated with mannitol or xylitol were mainly found in the regions of lipids, carbohydrates, sulfides, and aromatic compounds. To determine the specific changes in these metabolites composition and content, analytical techniques that are more precise are still required, but this experiment provides a preliminary understanding on the effect of different sugar alcohols to the metabolite pool of E. gracilis cells, which will help further improve the biomass yield and specific metabolites accumulation for industrial application."
14,Conclusions,"Positive effects on the growth and metabolites biosynthesis of freshwater microalga E. gracilis by lignocellulose related sugar alcohols mannitol and xylitol were exhibited in this study. At the optimal dosage of 4 g·L−1, mannitol and xylitol increased the biomass yield of algal cells by up to 4.64 and 3.18 times. Increased cell aspect ratio was only observed with mannitol, indicating that the E. gracilis had different physiological responses to mannitol and xylitol. Lipid accumulation was promoted by both mannitol and xylitol, revealing that these sugar alcohols from renewable resources have the potential to improve biofuel production by E. gracilis."
