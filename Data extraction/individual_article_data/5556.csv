0,Introduction,"Selective catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons and their derivatives with molecular oxygen is of great current interest for numerous industrial applications. The four-component crystalline MoVTeNb oxide system developed by Mitsubishi Chemicals [1] is a unique versatile vanadium catalyst powerful in many important gas phase reactions, such as oxidation and ammoxidation of propane to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile [2–8], oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene [9–11] and selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [12]. In addition, this catalyst is extraordinary efficient in ethanol selective oxidation to acetic acid, as well as in ethanol oxidative esterification to ethyl acetate [13,14]. The catalytic properties of MoVTeNb oxide are related to the presence of two crystalline phases: orthorhombic M1 and pseudo-hexagonal M2, which act as a bifunctional catalyst [2–11,15] although the M1 phase represents the most active and selective component [16]. In particular, it was shown recently that the phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts are efficient both in the gas-phase propane oxidation (at 380–400 °C) and in the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (120 °C, 2 atm O2) [17]. Notably, the extensive mechanistic studies of the reactions catalyzed by MoVTeNb oxides were focused mainly on the initial oxidation stages (including electron and hydrogen atom transfers), while further reaction steps and concurrent processes have in general received less attention. Thus, classical nucleophile-electrophile interactions were not duly considered as a potential mechanistic factor, which is perhaps surprising given the co-presence of typical nucleophiles such as water, alcohols and ammonia both in the liquid and gas phase reactions mediated by MoVTeNb oxides. However, we have shown recently that one and the same MoVTeNb oxide catalyst enables successful oxidation, oxidative esterification and ammoxidation of acrolein, and it has been suggested a common mechanism for these reactions [18]. It was proposed intermediate formation of a transient acryl-vanadia/molybdenum surface complex of electrophilic nature, which can react readily with water, methanol and ammonia to yield acrylic acid, methyl acrylate and acrylonitrile, respectively. In continuation of our interest to the role of nucleophile-electrophile interactions in the oxidation reactions on the MoVTeNb oxide and other metal oxide systems [18,19], in this paper we present the evidence of successful use of nucleophilic co-catalyst, such as DMAP, in the liquid phase oxidation of neat benzyl alcohol catalyzed by MoVTeNb oxide."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A submicrocrystalline quinary sample denoted as MoVTeNbO was prepared using ammonium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24 × 4H2O (NevaReactiv, Russia), ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3 (Reakhim, Russia) and telluric acid H6TeO6 (Alfa Aesar, Germany); the purity of each reagent was 99% or higher. Niobium oxalate was prepared by hydrolysis of niobium pentachloride (NbCl5, Acros Organics, 99.8%) followed by reaction with aqueous ammonia. White precipitate was filtered off, washed with water and dissolved in a solution of oxalic acid (C2O4 2−/Nb = 3.0). The catalyst was synthesized according to the patented procedure [20,21]. First, the aqueous solution of molybdenum, vanadium and tellurium compounds was prepared. Then, niobium oxalate was added to the ternary solution, which led to the formation of the catalyst slurry of pH = 2.9. The slurry of nominal composition Mo1.0V0.3Te0.23Nb0.12OX was spray-dried using laboratory spray-dryer Buchi-290, the inlet temperature was 220 °C and the outlet temperature was 110 °C. The resulting powder was calcined for a short period in air at 310 °C and in a He flow at 600 °C for 2 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area was calculated applying the BET analysis based on the nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using an automatic ASAP-2400 apparatus. The chemical composition was determined using a Perkin Elmer ISP Optima 4300DV atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The phase composition was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer using CuKα irradiation and LynxEye detector. Scanning was performed by the method of point by point in the region of angles 2θ = 5°–65° with a step of 0.05° and an accumulation time of 3 s. Quantitative Rietveld phase analysis was performed using the TOPAS 4.2 program (Bruker AXS) and structural parameters taken from [22] and Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Electron microscopic images of the catalyst powders were obtained by transmission electron microscopy with a JEM-2010 device (accelerating voltage 200 kV, grid resolution 1.4 Е). The sample suspended in ethanol was supported on a copper perforated support using an ultrasound disperser."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests In a typical run, a 20 mL Schlenk tube was charged with MoVTeNbO catalyst (55 mg), DMAP (21 mg, 0.172 mmol) and benzyl alcohol (3.3 g, 30.6 mmol). The Schlenk tube was evacuated, refilled with 1 bar O2, and connected with a balloon filled with oxygen. The reaction mixture was heated at 150 °C (the oil bath temperature) with magnetic stirring. At appropriate time intervals, stirring was stopped and, after catalyst settling, aliquots (0.05 mL) were taken, dissolved in CDCl3 (0.5 mL) and analyzed by 1H NMR on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz. The chemical shifts were measured relative to the residual proton signals of CDCl3 (δH 7.26 ppm). The chosen reference signals for the 1H NMR monitoring are listed in Table S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Structural characterization of the catalyst After calcination, specific surface area of the sample was 6.2 m2 g−1; the final chemical composition was Мо1V0.28Te0.13Nb0.11OX (ESI). The decrease in the tellurium content in the annealed sample is a result of its partial sublimation at high temperature [23]. XRD pattern for the calcined catalyst is shown in Fig. 1 . The main phase which is present in the catalyst is the orthorhombic phase M1 (92.8%) (2θ = 6.6, 7.9, 9.0, 22.1, 27.2o) [22]; the minor phases are pseudo-hexagonal М2 (3.9%) (2θ = 22.1, 28.2, 36.1, 45.1, 50.0o) [24] and binary laminar compound V0.95Mo0.97O5 (3.3%) (2θ = 14.63, 21.98, 24.99, 26.59, 29.55, 33.54o) [25]. Fig. 2 shows typical morphology of the MoVTeNbO sample. In general, the catalyst particles range in size from about 100 nm down to about 30 nm. Particles are well crystallized with well-defined facets in the main crystallographic directions of the orthorhombic phase M1. HRTEM image on Fig. 2 is related to the M1 phase of MoVTeNbO (ICSD №157,165 and [16])."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance According to the XRD analysis, the fraction of the orthorhombic phase M1 in MoVTeNbO catalyst is about 93%. In order to define activity of the catalyst in terms of turnover frequency (TOF), the relative amount of surface vanadium atoms (considered as active species [17]) has to be evaluated. The unit cell of M1 is known to be Pba2 with a = 21.134(2) Å, b = 26.658(2) Å, c = 4.0146(3) Å and Z = 4; the formula unit is Mo7.8V1.2NbTe0.937O28.9 [22]. Given the specific surface area of MoVTeNbO catalyst (6.2 m2 g−1) and neglecting by somewhat different content of V in the minor phases, the amount of surface V atoms can roughly be estimated as 1.2 × 4 × 6.2 × 1020/(21.1 × 26.7) per 1 g or ~2.86 × 1017 (0.476 × 10−3 mmol) in a 55 mg sample. The catalytic activity of MoVTeNbO was tested in the oxidation of neat benzyl alcohol with 1 atm O2. The catalyst demonstrated considerable performance at 150 °C, especially in the presence of an auxiliary base, such as DMAP (Table 1 ). The reaction resulted in the exclusive formation of three products: benzaldehyde (1), benzyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (3). Only trace amounts of benzaldehyde dibenzyl acetal (4) have been detected in some cases at the initial course of the reaction (ESI). In contrast to the literary data [17], no detectable amount of toluene is produced. To demonstrate the stability and reusability of MoVTeNbO, one more recycle was conducted, and it was shown, that both catalytic activity and selectivity persisted well (Table 1, run 7). This is in line with the highly stable catalytic performance of the M1 phase [17]. Also, XRD measurements (not shown) clearly demonstrated the maintained crystalline structure of the catalyst after recycling. The ratio of products 1–3 depends on the reaction time and DMAP loading. Dependence of TOFs on DMAP content is shown in Fig. 3 where the promoting effect of DMAP is clearly seen. The effect does not directly proportional to the DMAP concentration, probably due to concurrent coordination of DMAP to vanadium oxide species which are acidic in nature. It is noteworthy that the increase in the DMAP content influences the production of 1–3 with different extent, in favour of selectivity to 1. Such a difference may be explained by preliminary dissociative chemisorption of benzyl alcohol on the metal oxide to give benzyl alcoholate before oxidation [17]. This could decrease a competition between DMAP and benzyl alcohol for the catalyst surface. In contrast, the similar chemical binding to the catalyst cannot be realized for subsequent oxidation of 1. As a result, after initial promotion effect (Fig. 4 ), further increase in the DMAP loading suppresses oxidation of 1 to 2 and 3 (Fig. 5 )."
8,The role of DMAP and the reaction mechanism proposed,"3.3 The role of DMAP and the reaction mechanism proposed To the best of our knowledge, the co-catalytic role of bases is generally unknown for the oxidation reactions catalyzed by solid metal oxides. On the other hand, a few reports have suggested that bases, such as triethylamine, pyridine and its more basic derivatives can promote homogeneous vanadium-mediated alcohol oxidations [26,27]. The role of these bases was attributed to the intermolecular deprotonation at the benzylic position of benzyl alcoholate ligand in the intermediate vanadium(V) complexes [27]. Also, the promoting effect of mineral bases, such as NaOH and others is known for aerobic oxidation of alcohols over supported metal nanoparticles [28]. However, in that case more than a stoichiometric amount of base is typically required, which is in contrast to the catalytic effect of DMAP (Table 1). It is important to note in this connection that DMAP is a well known and commonly used nucleophilic catalyst, which is able to transfer electrophilic intermediates in a variety of reactions [29]. Hence, the catalytic effect of DMAP in the benzyl alcohol oxidation over MoVTeNbO seems in the line with the hypothesis that nucleophiles can participate intrinsically in selective oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes over metal oxides [18,19]. The preliminary outline presenting such consideration for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is shown at Schemes S1-S2 (ESI). An extensive validation study regarding this conception is currently underway and will be published elsewhere."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, benzyl alcohol undergoes liquid phase oxidation with 1 atm molecular oxygen over MoVTeNb mixed oxides to afford exclusively compounds 1–3. Addition of DMAP not only accelerates the catalytic rate but also influences the ratio of the reaction products. We suggest that reaction of DMAP (powerful nucleophilic mediator) with intermediate oxygenates formed on the catalyst surface can explain the results obtained, in accord with previous observations [18]."
