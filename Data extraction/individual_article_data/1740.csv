0,Introduction,"Sustainable agriculture attempts to secure consistent food production in order to fulfill the increasing population needs [1] while preserving natural resources and protecting environment and global climate [2,3]. Agricultural production is strongly dependent on fertilizers for high crop yields, namely for plant essential nutrients supply (phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium) [4]. However, these macronutrients are reported by low utilization efficiency due to the high solubility of fertilizers [5,6]. Therefore, finding efficient way to maintain the nutrients availability is essential for better plants nutrition. Slow-release fertilizers (SRF) have emerged as a promising category of ecofriendly fertilizers with improved agronomic efficiency [7]. In fact, SRF are designed for sustained nutrients supply through releasing their components gradually at a rate to coincide with plants requirements [8], thus reducing any possible nutrients losses (leaching, runoff, volatilization) threatening the environment [9]. In addition, the use of SRF can reduce fertilization frequency, save labor and energy as well as minimize concerns associated with fertilizers overdosage [10]. Among the slow release fertilizers, those with physical barrier are largely produced by coating technology using different processes such as immersion or dip coating [11], rotating drum spraying [12], fluidized-bed [13] or spouted bed coating [14]. A variety of materials have been applied for coating of fertilizers, but the recent trend shows that polymers, including copolymers and grafted polymers are the most promising coating materials [9,15]. Despite the fact that these petroleum-based polymers showed better control of nutrients release [16,17], they are expensive [18], and they require usually toxic organic solvents for dissolution [19]. Moreover, the accumulation of synthetic residues in the field and the possible generation of toxic by-products [20] are their main drawbacks. As a result, the recent tendency toward the use of biodegradable polymers, mainly natural biobased ones, is still increasing [21] owing to their abundancy, low cost, renewability, non-toxicity and modifiability [22]. Among these biopolymers, starch, cellulose, chitosan, sodium alginate, lignin and their derivates were well documented in literature for eco-friendly fertilizers production [23–26]. In many studies, synthetic polymers are combined with biomass directly or with natural polymers derived from biomass in order to favor the properties of the final material such as its degradability process [27], mechanical performance, absorption capacity as well as for reducing cost [28–30]. In addition to efficient nutrients supply, efficient use of water resources is of great importance mainly in drought conditions [8]. Besides, the soil water content is an essential factor in the nutrition process of plants [31]. Therefore, the use of water absorbent polymers, mainly hydrogels as coating materials of fertilizers can impart them with the water retention property for both sustained water and nutrients supply [32]. For this purpose, different superabsorbent polymers mostly composed of poly (acrylic acid) or poly(acrylamide), were developed for coating fertilizer in order to enhance the water holding capacity of the soil [33]. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biodegradable water-soluble polymer that can swell by absorbing water due to its hydrophilicity [34]. Being eco-friendly, excellent for gels preparing and films forming with good flexibility [35], PVA was largely used for various applications, e.g., drug delivery systems, textile, adhesives, coatings, film packaging [36–38], etc. To date, limited publications have worked with PVA for slow/controlled release fertilizers using coating technology and the studies published in this regard did not use PVA as the main film former but combined with other compounds [39]. However, instead of coating technology, PVA was often used with other components in the preparation of SRF embedded in polymeric matrices through grafting, copolymerization or interpenetrating network technology [40,41]. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) is a highly crystalline form of cellulose at nanoscale [42], CNC gained large attention due to its interesting strength-reinforcing impact, good effect in barrier packaging [43], large surface area and utility to improve surface properties [44]. Moreover, CNC can be chemically functionalized thanks to the plentiful hydroxyl groups on its surface [45]. Therefore, CNC find enormous application in nanocomposites, packaging, cosmetics and coatings etc. [44]. Up to now, CNC has not been explored in the production of coated fertilizers, in contrast to cellulose nanofibers that was widely used in the synthesis of hydrogel nanocomposites with the presence of fertilizer solution for controlled nutrients release [46,47]. Furthermore, to our knowledge, CNC-filled PVA nanocomposites has not been used as fertilizer coating yet. Therefore, in the present paper, we targeted to prepare novel biodegradable formulations based on PVA filled with CNC as a waterborne coating of water-soluble NPK fertilizer using fluidized bed technique. Various PVA-based coating compositions were developed by varying the CNC content in order to evaluate their effect on the release rate of N-P-K nutrients in water and soil media. The choice of the coating material is related to the above background, besides, we aimed to extract the maximum value from CNC for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of CNC into PVA polymer can form a dense network that can improve the mechanical strength and the release properties of the coated products as well as the water holding capacity of the soil."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 47,000 MW, 98.0–98.8 mol% hydrolysis) and all the analytical grade chemicals used for extraction of CNC from Hemp stalks (obtained from Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Region, Morocco) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. NPK fertilizer granules were obtained from OCP group (Office Chérifien des Phosphates - Morocco)."
3,"Preparation of CNC, PVA@CNC nanocomposite formulations","2.2 Preparation of CNC, PVA@CNC nanocomposite formulations CNC were extracted by subjecting cellulose microfibers extracted from raw hemp stalks to sulfuric acid hydrolysis as described in our previous works [48,49]. The CNC extraction process as well as their morphological and structural characteristics were detailed in Supporting Information (SI) (Figs. S1 and S2). To prepare the PVA@CNC nanocomposite formulations, 3 g of PVA powder was dissolved in 250 mL of distilled water for 1 h at 90 °C under stirring, and then cooled to room temperature. At the same time, 50 mL of aqueous suspensions containing 6, 10 and 14.5 wt% of CNC (with respect to the total weight of the dried nanocomposite) were prepared and ultrasonicated for 10 min. Afterward, the CNC suspensions were slowly added to the PVA solutions under stirring and then the obtained mixtures (concentrated at 1 g/100 mL) were mechanically stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The PVA@CNC mixtures were sonicated for 30 min and then subjected to magnetic stirring (200 rpm) for another 5 h to obtain homogeneous nanocomposites (Fig. 1 ). The prepared nanocomposites formulations were referred as follows: PVA100%, PVA@CNC6%, PVA@CNC10%, and PVA@CNC14.5% for neat PVA and PVA@CNC nanocomposite formulations containing 6, 10 and 14.5 wt% CNC, respectively. Nanocomposite solid films were obtained by solvent-casting method (Fig. 1). Briefly, the obtained PVA@CNC viscous nanocomposite formulations were poured into petri dishes and air-dried in fume hood at room temperature for 2 days to evaporate water, resulting in the production of films with high quality, smooth surface and good flexibility (Fig. 1). The same method was used to prepare the neat PVA film. The thickness of the as-prepared films was determined as 43.75 ± 2.62, 43.25 ± 1.50, 42.25 ± 0.95 and 43.75 ± 2.62 μm for PVA100%, PVA@CNC6%, PVA@CNC10% and PVA@CNC14.5%, respectively."
4,Characterization of PVA@CNC nanocomposites,"2.3 Characterization of PVA@CNC nanocomposites 2.3.1 Viscosity measurement of PVA@CNC formulations The viscosity of the PVA@CNC formulations (1 g/100 mL) was measured using a hybrid rheometer (Discovery HR-2, TA instrument, USA) equipped with a temperature control unit (Peltier Plate) that was calibrated to give the required temperature. The geometry used was a parallel plate, with a diameter of 40 mm and a gap of 1000 μm. The viscosity was measured as a function of shear rate (0.1 to 200 s−1). 2.3.2 Structural analysis of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The crystalline structure of PVA@CNC nanocomposite solid films was performed via X-ray diffraction analysis using Bruker D2 PHASER diffractometer (CuK [Kα = 1.54056 Ǻ]) with a slit of 0.1 mm. The diffractograms were recorded in the range 2θ = 5–80° with a step size of 0.02°. The chemical structure of PVA@CNC nanocomposite solid films was analyzed using Fourier Transform-infrared spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 2000 FTIR) equipped with attenuated total reflection accessory (ATR), operated at 4 cm−1 over a range of 4000–600 cm−1. 2.3.3 Thermal degradation of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The thermal degradation profile of the elaborated films was examined using thermogravimetric analysis (Discovery TGA, TA instruments, USA). The thermal stability of the samples (5–7 mg) was evaluated under nitrogen flow, from 25 °C to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.3.4 Water contact angle of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films Contact angle of PVA@CNC nanocomposites films was measured using a Krüss DSA1 tensiometer. Each film was glued to the sample holder so that the surface is as flat as possible. A 5 μl volume of each probe was deposited on the surface using a microsyringe. Then the image of the drop was acquired by the camera and processed by the instrument software to determine the value of the contact angle. At least three replicates were tested for each sample film. 2.3.5 Swelling behaviors of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The swelling ratio of the as-prepared PVA@CNC films was measured by immersion method. For that, dried samples (1 × 1 cm2) were initially weighted (W 0 ) and soaked in a beaker containing 50 mL of distilled water at room temperature. The swollen films were removed from water at certain time intervals and weighted (W t ) after blotting gently the surface by a filter paper, the procedure continue until each sample reached an equilibrium swelling weight. The swelling ratio (S r ) was calculated based on the following equation: S r % = W t − W 0 W 0 × 100"
5,Preparation of PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer,"2.4 Preparation of PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer was produced at the laboratory scale using fluidized bed machine (DIOSNA MiniLab RC, Germany) (Fig. S4). An amount of NPK fertilizer granules (W 0 = 60 g) was put into the fluid bed reactor and preheated at 80 °C for 20 min. After the preheating stage, a specific amount of PVA@CNC viscous formulations (1 g/100 mL) were sprayed through a peristaltic pump on the granules (Fig. 1). The bottom spray coating mode was applied, and the process parameters were set as follows: inlet temperature of 80 °C, air flow of 50%, nozzle pressure of 0.4 bar and pump speed of 20 rpm. The coating process was only started when steady state temperature conditions were achieved. For the drying of coated NPK granules, the fluidizing air flow was carried on for 25 min after every coating session while keeping the spray input off. After drying, the coated NPK granules were removed from the bed reactor and weighted (W 1 ). The coating rate (CR) was calculated according to the following equation: CR % = W 1 − W 0 W 1 × 100"
6,Characterization of PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer,"2.5 Characterization of PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer 2.5.1 Morphology, thickness and elemental composition measurement Surface and cross-section morphologies of NPK fertilizers granules before and after coating were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN-VEGA3) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Before SEM analysis, the samples were attached to SEM specimen holder with double-sided carbon tape and coated with carbon. From SEM analysis, the coating thickness was observed and determined. An energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer coupled with SEM was employed to identify the specific elemental composition of the surface of coated and uncoated NPK granules. 2.5.2 Mechanical crushing strength The crushing strength of uncoated and coated NPK granules was examined by compression test using Shimadzu's EZ Test EZ-X Series compact tabletop. The crushing strength was measured by applying a force to individual granules with an average diameter between 2.6 and 3.3 mm. Twenty analysis were carried out to obtain the averaged values with standard deviation."
7,N-P-K nutrients release behavior of coated NPK fertilizer in water,"2.6 N-P-K nutrients release behavior of coated NPK fertilizer in water The phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient release behaviors of the coated and uncoated NPK fertilizer granules were firstly evaluated in distilled water medium. For that, 100 mg of each dried fertilizer sample was placed in a 250 mL beaker containing 200 mL of distilled water. The experiment was made under continuous mild stirring at room temperature (23 °C). At regular time intervals, 100 μL were sampled and diluted 100 time for nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients determination, then an additional 100 μL of distilled water was added to the beaker to maintain the total volume. The collected samples were analyzed by UV–Vis Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 1050) to determine the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus according to Ammonium-molybdate Colorimetric Method (AFNOR-T90-023) and phenol Colorimetric Methods (AFNOR-T90-015), respectively. Meanwhile, the potassium amount was determined using potentiometry using an Orion 9512 ion selective electrode (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The release period is set to the time that K, N and P release rate reached between 90 and 100%. All the tests were carried out in duplicate, and the average values were taken as the results."
8,N-P-K nutrients release behavior of coated NPK fertilizer in soil,"2.7 N-P-K nutrients release behavior of coated NPK fertilizer in soil The N-P-K nutrients release behaviors of uncoated and coated NPK fertilizer granules were also studied in soil. For that, 0.5 g of uncoated and coated NPK fertilizer granules were enclosed in filter paper bags and then buried 4 cm beneath the surface of the soil in plastic cups filled with 50 g of soil. Further, water-holding ratio of the soil was maintained between 30 and 35% by weighing and adding distilled water periodically when necessary. The cups were stored under controlled temperature at 25 ± 1 °C. After different incubation times, the bags were retrieved and air dried, then fertilizer granules were removed from the bags and dissolved in water for determining N, P and K contents using colorimetric and ion selective electrode methods, as previously described. The properties of the soil used in this work were measured and presented in Table S1."
9,Water holding and water retention capacity of the soil containing coated NPK fertilizer,"2.8 Water holding and water retention capacity of the soil containing coated NPK fertilizer The water-holding capacity and water retention of the soil containing PVA@CNC coated NPK were determined according to the procedures reported elsewhere [50]. First, mixtures of 0.5 g of coated fertilizer granules with 50 g of soil were carefully placed into PVC tubes (20 × 4 cm). The bottom of each PVC tube was sealed with nylon mesh, then the tube is weighed (total weight was marked as W 0 ) and was hung on an iron support stand vertically. Water was slowly added to the mixture from the top of the PVC tube until water seeped out from the bottom. The tube was weighed again (marked as W 1 ) when no more water seeping from the bottom. On the basis of w1 and w0 values, the largest water-holding capacity (W H %) of the soil containing coated NPK fertilizer is calculated using the following equation: W H % = W 1 − W 0 50 × 100 For the water retention capacity measurements, 0.5 g of each dry coated fertilizer was buried in 50 g of dry soil. The mixtures were placed into plastic cups and then each cup was saturated by adding 50 mL of distilled water. The plastic cups were incubated at ambient temperature and weighed daily until constant mass. The water retention (W R %) was calculated using the following equation: W R % = m i − m m 0 − m × 100 where m is the total weight of the cup containing dry soil and coated granules mixture before adding water, m 0 is the weight of the mixture soil/coated granules and the cups after adding water, and m i is the weight of the incubated cups recorded daily. In both experiments (W H and W R), a control test without adding coated granules was carried out as well."
10,Results and discussions,
11,Viscosity of PVA@CNC coating formulations,"3.1 Viscosity of PVA@CNC coating formulations The shear viscosity of the as-prepared neat PVA and PVA@CNC coating formulations was measured at room temperature before coating process in order to evaluate the effect of adding CNC on the viscosity of PVA solution and to study the suitability of the prepared formulations for the coating process, which was based on the spraying concept. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from this figure that all the studied coating formulations exhibited a shear-thinning behavior indicating that as shear rate increases, the intermolecular junctions are disrupted at a rate faster than their rate of reformation, resulting in a decrease in the junction density and hence a drop in the viscosity [51]. In addition, regarding the viscosity of neat PVA solution, the presence of CNC slightly increased the viscosity of the resulted PVA@CNC mixtures, which is due to the flow-impeding effect induced by the presence of CNC. Indeed, the presence of CNC restrained the shear flow of the PVA macromolecules, because the CNC's average size is larger than that of the chain segments of the PVA, leading to in an increase of shear viscosity. This finding indicates that a network structure is formed by CNC within the PVA@CNC viscous mixtures, which is constructed by strong hydrogen interactions and consequently, causes the viscosity to increase. Regarding the coating process, which was performed in Wurster chamber of a fluidized bed dryer, the optimization of suitable coating conditions, mainly temperature, was essential during the spraying process. For this purpose, two temperatures (50 and 80 °C) were chosen for performing the coating tests. It was found that at 50 °C, several agglomerates of fertilizer granules were formed during the coating process, which were visually observed as shown in Fig. 2b. However, when the temperature of the coating process is set at 80 °C, no granules agglomeration was found after spraying/drying tests, and a good homogenous coating was obtained (Fig. 2b). This finding indicates that at lower temperature (50 °C), the drying efficiency was insufficient, resulting in slow evaporation rate of the water contained in the PVA@CNC coating formulations, that were concentrated at 1 g/100 mL. This slow drying rate caused agglomeration of coated granules (4 to 5 granules) [52]. Consequently, the spraying at 50 °C with the as-prepared PVA@CNC formulations of such obtained viscosity was inappropriate condition for the coating process. Therefore, it was necessary to increase the coating temperature to 80 °C for accelerating the water evaporation rate from the viscous mixtures during the coating. This experimental condition was optimal for obtaining final coated products without agglomeration and with good coating homogeneity."
12,Structural and thermal characteristics of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films,"3.2 Structural and thermal characteristics of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The PVA is a water-soluble polymer and its processing in water can easily be performed due to its hydrophilic nature. On the other hand, sulfuric acid hydrolyzed CNC exhibit free hydroxyl groups and anionic sulfate groups inserted on their surfaces, which make them highly water dispersible nanomaterials. Accordingly, the mixture of PVA and CNC in water can be easily carried out, enabling the formation of a homogeneous and stable PVA@CNC mixtures. By casting these latter on petri dishes and evaporating water, films with high quality, smooth surface and good flexibility were produced, example of these films are presented in Fig. 1. Herein, both PVA and CNC contain hydroxyl groups, which can be involved in the formation of the hydrogen bonds between them, creating a compact polymeric network, as confirmed by FTIR and XRD analyses (Fig. S2). In the same line, the thermal degradation behavior of the as-prepared PVA@CNC nanocomposite films confirmed the successful formation of compact structures with largely sufficient thermal stability to resist the heating during coating process (Fig. S3)."
13,Hydrophilicity investigation of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films,"3.3 Hydrophilicity investigation of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The water contact angle measurement gives an estimation about wetting and hydrophilicity behavior of the surface of coating materials [53,54]. In general, smaller contact angle implies greater hydrophilicity of films due to the attraction of water molecules toward the films by forming a hydrogen bond with the film-based materials [55]. Therefore, the contact angle tests were carried out to confirm the changes at the water - PVA@CNC films interface and to prove the surface modification after adding CNC to PVA matrix. The obtained contact angle results are shown in Fig. 3 . The high hydrophilicity and wettability of neat PVA film was confirmed with a contact angle value of 29.3° ± 2, which is due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the PVA backbone, that are the most sites having high affinity for water. The incorporation of CNC into PVA matrix increased significantly the water contact angle from 29.3° ± 2 to 36° ± 3, 41.2° ± 5 and 69.7° ± 5 when CNC content is 6, 10 and 14.5 wt%, respectively. This can be explained by specific interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PVA macromolecular chains and those present in the surface of CNC, resulting in the formation of new established hydrogen bonding, which has reduced the interaction of PVA@CNC films with water, thus, improving their hydrophobicity, especially at high CNC content (14.5 wt%). For fertilizer granules coating, the hydrophilicity of coating film is important for water absorption as well as for fertilizer dissolution and nutrients diffusion. However, the hydrophobic character is also required for preventing the possible disruption of the coating membrane caused by the hydrolytic degradation phenomenon [56]. Herein, it was found that the hydrophilicity level of the as-prepared PVA@CNC films is suitable for forming a stable coating layer on the surface of fertilizer granules, with good water retention capacity."
14,Swelling behavior of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films,"3.4 Swelling behavior of PVA@CNC nanocomposite films The swelling profiles of the as-prepared PVA-based nanocomposites with different CNC contents are represented in Fig. 4 . The swelling ratio of all the films has gradually increased over time until the equilibrium state was achieved. It can be clearly seen that the water absorbency of the films is affected by the presence of CNC nanofillers as the swelling ability decreased significantly with increasing CNC content. The highest swelling capacity of 1233% reached within 15 min is attributed to the neat PVA film, while the PVA@CNC14.5% exhibited the lowest swelling ratio of 495% gained within 40 min. Similarly, it was found that the swelling ratio of chemically crosslinked PVA by glutaraldehyde decreased with increasing of CNC weight fraction [57], as well as in the case of CNC filled starch/PVA nanocomposites [58]. It is believed that the rapid and large water uptake of neat PVA film is due to its hydrophilic nature [59], whereas the incorporation of CNC not only reduces the hydrophilicity of PVA as revealed by contact angle results, but also it leads to a compact structure where strong hydrogen bonds are established between PVA and CNC rather than water molecules [60], resulting in a reduced swelling and prolonged equilibrium time. Generally, the swelling ratio is related to the voids volume present in the polymeric network, a less compact structure results in larger voids volume to accommodate water molecules, leading to higher swelling ratio [61]. It can be also argued that the diminished swelling ratio is due to the crystallinity of CNC acting as reinforcing agents which restricts the PVA chains mobility and water penetration route. These results are in agreement with previous studies where declined swelling degree of PVA-based nanocomposites was due to higher proportion of CNC [62]."
15,"Morphological, coating thickness and mechanical strength of coated NPK fertilizer","3.5 Morphological, coating thickness and mechanical strength of coated NPK fertilizer Fig. 5 represents the surface SEM micrographs with three magnification levels of four samples including uncoated and coated NPK fertilizer with neat PVA and PVA@CNC nanocomposites containing 6 and 14.5% CNC loadings. The surface of uncoated NPK fertilizer was very coarse with irregular distribution of pointy crystal particles, characteristics of NPK structure, as shown in images (Fig. 5a). In addition, the amplified images revealed the existence of small holes and gaps in the NPK structure. Besides, it can be clearly observed from Fig. 5b that the application of neat PVA coating reduced remarkably the surface irregularities indicating that the polymer filled the structure gaps. Furthermore, smoothest and more uniform surface with no more visible crystals, cracks or apertures was obtained when CNC is added to the PVA-based coating, indicating that CNC matched well with PVA since both polymers are hydrophilic resulting in a compact and dense coating material (Fig. 5c, d). The observed small particles distributed on the coating surface are just related to the dust formation during coating process resulted from collision of fertilizer granules during their movement. It can be concluded that the application of PVA@CNC coating material has improved the surface morphology of the fertilizer, which is very important for the physical barrier property as well as for preventing dust formation or moisture penetration into the fertilizer core [15,17]. In fact, the more the surface is non-homogenous, the more water can diffuse through defects and dissolve the fertilizer [63], thus covering the former with a smooth coating layer can reduce water penetration rate inside the fertilizer and slow the nutrients diffusion outside the granules [64]. Furthermore, burst release will occur if fissures or cracks are present in the coating layer leading to immediate availability of nutrients reflecting the inefficiency of the coating [65]. Cross-sectional SEM images of the four samples presented in Fig. 6 indicate the presence of a distinct coating layer at the boundary of the fertilizer granules in a well adhered core-shell structure. From the amplified images, the thicknesses of neat PVA, PVA@CNC6% and PVA-CNC14.5% coated NPK fertilizer granules were estimated to be 28, 33 and 38 μm, corresponding to a coating rate of 6.73, 5.89 and 5.78 wt%, respectively. The EDX analysis of NPK fertilizer before and after coating was carried out in order to investigate the elements distribution in the prepared materials. The results presented in Fig. 7A demonstrate that the uncoated fertilizer is made of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients with slight existence of carbon originated from carbon coating of the samples during their preparation for SEM analysis. Regarding the coated fertilizer granules, only carbon and oxygen that are characteristics of the chemical structure of the coating material (PVA or PVA@CNC) were present in high percentages. This indicates that the coating has been successfully deposited on the fertilizer surface (Fig. 7B–D). Besides, traces of chloride, phosphorus, sulfur and potassium were detected at some surface points in the coating resulted from the dust particles formed during the coating process. These results are consistent with magnified SEM images showing the presence of small particles on the coating surface (Fig. 5). The EDX mapping (Fig. 8 ) reveals that the oxygen area involves both the fertilizer core and the coating layer which is consistent with their chemical composition as both contains oxygen element. However, high carbon concentration was found in the coating material without being detected in the fertilizer core except one small spot. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium elements were largely spread through the fertilizer core with significantly lower concentrations in the coating layer. The presence of traces of carbon in the fertilizer core as well as nutritive elements in the coating material might be due to their diffusion while cutting and polishing the granules before SEM and mapping investigations. The mechanical strength of the fertilizer granules is worth investigation to ensure good physical properties during their handling, storage or transportation [66]. It is important to evaluate the coating effect on hardness of fertilizer granules in order to avoid any possible alteration of the physical performances of the granules after coating. The crushing strength of uncoated and PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer granules are shown in Fig. 9 . For uncoated granules, the resistance toward the compression force was about 50 N, corresponding to 5 kg/granule, which is significantly higher than reported values from literature for NPK compound: 21 N (2.1 kg/granule) [4], 43 N (4.3 kg/grain) [64]. In comparison to the uncoated granules, the maximal required force for breaking the coated granules was improved slightly after the coating by increasing from 50 N (uncoated granules) to 58 N (neat PVA coated granules) and 59 N (PVA@CNC6% coated granules). A significant increase in the crushing strength of 70 N was observed for PVA@CNC10% coated granules. This enhanced mechanical strength can be explained by the fact that the coating material can cover the surface nonuniformities of the granules (defects, edges and porosity) by forming a dense polymeric layer on the outside of the granules, as confirmed by SEM images (Figs. 5 and 6). Generally, the presence of surface irregularities in uncoated granules can initiate the fracture of the granules during compression leading to a lower resistance to crushing [4,67]. Moreover, CNC with high crystallinity (83%) can act as reinforcing agents in the polymeric network resulting in an enhanced mechanical performance. However, further increase in CNC content from 10 to 14.5% reduced slightly the strength from 70 N to 64 N which can be explained by the beginning of CNC aggregates formation acting as weakening zones in the structure. Despite of this slight decrease, the strength was still higher than uncoated fertilizer mechanical resistance."
16,N-P-K release behaviors of coated NPK fertilizer in water,"3.6 N-P-K release behaviors of coated NPK fertilizer in water The release behaviors of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from uncoated and coated NPK fertilizer was investigated in water in order to evaluate the physical barrier property of the coating materials. Fig. 10 show that the complete release of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen from uncoated NPK was reached rapidly after 1 to 2 h. Similar result was reported for phosphate nutrient release from NPK fertilizer granules in water medium (55–60 min) [4], while other studies reported an almost complete release of nutrients from uncoated NPK fertilizer reached within 4 [68] and 6 h [69]. This release time difference depends on the fertilizer structure, its initial content and manufacturing process. Generally, water soluble NPK fertilizer is well known to easily dissolve in water [70]. Importantly, the release profiles of the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from PVA@CNC coated NPK fertilizer exhibited clearly retardant release behavior as compared to uncoated NPK, with significant difference in their individual retardant performance (Fig. 10a–c). Indeed, it was found that the percentages of released nutrients from PVA-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK and PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated products were 86, 65, 54 and 37% for potassium, 99, 85, 81 and 68% for phosphorus and 99, 81, 74 and 67% for nitrogen within 5 h of soaking in water, respectively. Therefore, the release rate of potassium decreased considerably by 63% and by about 33% for both phosphorus and nitrogen in the case of PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated product. The obtained release results are interestingly higher than some literature findings. For example, 100% of phosphorus and 100% of nitrogen were released after 4 h from NPK fertilizer coated with 13.5% of polysulfone using phase inversion method while, 56.3% of potassium was released within the same duration [64]. In the same study, the increase of polymer concentration up to 18% decreased the nutrients release rate by 50–60% [64]. However, Noppakundilograt et al. reported excellent release results of N, P and K from trilayered coated NPK fertilizer using PVA, crosslinked chitosan and Poly (acrylic acid-co-acrylamid) by dipping and polymerization techniques [71]. After 24 h immersion in water, the released amounts of N, P and K were about 22%, 18% and 8% [71]. It can be said that the release performances of coated fertilizer depend upon the fertilizer structure, the nature of coating material, the number of coating layers or the thickness, the coating molar ratio as well as the coating process. In this current investigation, an amount of 90% of potassium was released after 5, 6, 8 and 11 h for PVA-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK and PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated products, respectively. By analogy, 90% of phosphorus and nitrogen were released after 3, 6, 8 and 9–10 h for PVA-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK and PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated products, respectively. These results show that the coated NPK with PVA@CNC14.5% material represents the best slow-release property with a maximum release duration in water of 11, 9 and 10 h for 90% release of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. In fact, the more compact structure with less hydrophilic character of coating films incorporated with high CNC content might be the reason of the slowest nutrients release. By comparing these results, the fertilizer nutrients were released at different rates as well as at different release durations. Particularly, the potassium was released in a slower rate than phosphorus and nitrogen, which are showing both approximately similar release patterns. Generally, there is no consensus regarding the release order of nutrients from coated fertilizers, a series of reported studies found that the lowest release percentage is attributed to potassium as compared to phosphorus and nitrogen [71], others found that nitrogen was released the slowest [70,72]. Whereas it is believed in several studies that the release rate of phosphorus from coated fertilizer is the lowest than potassium and nitrogen [4,73]. This phenomenon can be explained by the difference in the solubility rate of nutrients depending on the chemical affinity to water of each ion [67]. Moreover, the slowest release behavior of an element in comparison to others can result from its possible ionic interactions with the polymeric network depending on the ionic mobility, electronic and steric effects of the nutritive elements [71]. In this context, the smaller size of potassium in comparison to nitrogen and phosphorus results in higher charged surface area to interact with negatively charged sulfate groups of CNC, thus decreasing its release rate significantly from the as-prepared PVA@CNC coated NPK. Furthermore, the release is considerably affected by the structure of the polymer coating which hinders the diffusion of each nutrient depending on its compactness as well as the different nutrient's interactions inside the fertilizer granule [64]. It can be concluded from these findings that the PVA@CNC coating can successfully extend the release time of nutrients in comparison to uncoated NPK fertilizer. Moreover, the release became much slower with the addition of CNC up to 14.5% indicating the interesting role of CNC, as sustainable nanomaterials, in the obtention of a dense physical barrier with tuned hydrophilicity and slow release behavior."
17,N-P-K release behaviors of coated NPK fertilizer in soil,"3.7 N-P-K release behaviors of coated NPK fertilizer in soil The release characteristics of uncoated and coated NPK fertilizer granules were monitored in the soil medium and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 11 . It seems from the obtained results that the release profiles of all samples follow the same behavior as obtained in water. The uncoated NPK fertilizer released its total potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen content within 3 to 4 days. In agreement with literature findings where NPK fertilizer completely released its nutrients within 2 to 5 days [74]. For coated NPK products, despite the exception observed for nitrogen as slightly slower release was obtained with PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK coated product in comparison to PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK during some incubation times, it can be clearly seen by comparing the total release durations that the slower nutrients release behavior was attributed to PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated product, which is consistent with water release experiment. In fact, PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK and PVA-c-NPK coated products released 90% of their nutrients after 22, 18, 10 and 7 days for potassium, 24, 16, 14, 6 days for phosphorus and 20, 19, 11, 9 days for nitrogen. Interestingly, PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated product released 96.23%, 95.48% and 96.31% of K, P and N, respectively after one-month incubation in soil medium. With these results, the PVA@CNC coating material exhibit comparable slow-release property with some reported studies. For example, 93.3% of P and 94.2% of K were released within 30 days from NPK fertilizer entrapped in attapulgite and coated with guar gum single coating, while 88.2% and 92.4% were released when another layer of guar gum grafted poly(itaconic acid-co -acrylamide)/humic acid was added, respectively [66]. Generally, preferable slow release properties are obtained when synthetic polymers are used for coating. For instance, poly (acrylic acid) grafted natural rubber coated NPK fertilizer released 54.35% of N, 51.18% of P and 44.37% of K in 30 days [74], whereas within the same period, 28.60%, 40.64%, and 83.47% of N, P and K were released in soil from NPK fertilizer coated with poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/kaolin [72]. Additionally, it was reported that NPK fertilizer coated with chitosan/poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) double layer released 79%, 62%, 69% of N, P and K nutrients in one-month [73]. It is noteworthy to mention that the release in the soil is different from the release in water, since soil conditions vary largely including the soil nature or texture, moisture, microorganisms, acidity and temperature [41,72,75]. Nevertheless, the obtained results confirmed that the release behaviors of coated NPK in the soil can be predicted from water release measurements in terms of best release retardant behavior and not release duration. This indicates the importance of water standard release method being a rapid technique in predicting the soil release, which generally require long incubation period."
18,Water holding capacity of the soil containing coated NPK fertilizer,"3.8 Water holding capacity of the soil containing coated NPK fertilizer In addition to their essential function of nutrients slow release as discussed above, coated fertilizers can preserve the soil moisture if the coating material is a good water absorbent. It is believed that the retained water by the superabsorbent coating, during rainfall and irrigation, can be released gradually to the soil to satisfy the plant needs and facilitate the nutrients diffusion in dry times [41]. This is especially important in drought-prone areas where the availability of water is insufficient. Considering the preliminary swelling study carried out for the as-prepared PVA-based solid films, it was found that they can swell significantly when soaked in water (Fig. 4). In fact, such PVA-based films can be swollen in the same way after immersion in tap water when they are applied as coating materials. Digital images of the dry coated products and the ones swollen in tap water are presented in Fig. 12 . From this result, it can be seen that the coated NPK granules are capable of taking up water, which indicates that they could effectively store rain or irrigation water and improve the use of water resources for the soil and the plants. However, burying such coated fertilizers in a wetted soil system is different from water immersion. The soil particles surrounding the coated fertilizer product with the presence of various ions in the soil solution may hinder its water absorbency [66]. In this investigation, the largest water holding capacity (W H ) of the soil mixed with uncoated and PVA@CNC-coated NPK granules was evaluated in controlled conditions and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 13a. It was found that no significant difference was observed when only soil is applied and when uncoated fertilizer is added to the soil, since W H was about 46% in both cases. However, when soil is mixed with PVA-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK and PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated products, the WH increased to 49.86%, 50.61%, 51.41% and 51.58%, respectively. It can be remarked that the slight increase in CNC content from one coating to the other have a slight effect on W H . Nevertheless, as compared to uncoated fertilizer, these results indicate that the coating material used can improve the soil quality by increasing its water holding ability by more than 5%. Compared with other studies on soil water holding ability, the here reported PVA@CNC-c-NPK coated products exhibit good water holding property taking into account that the coating layers were formed by simple CNC and PVA blending, and no chemical crosslinking or grafting of synthetic super-absorbents such as acrylamide or acrylic acid were used. This finding indicates that the chosen coating material (CNC-filled PVA) exhibited a good intrinsic water retention capacity. Furthermore, one single coating layer was used in this work and could improve the water holding, while comparable results with ours were obtained using multicoated NPK fertilizers. For instance, the W H of soil was 45.2%, 49.4% for neat soil and soil mixed with double coated NPK fertilizer using guar gum as inner coating and guar gum-g -poly(itaconic acid-co -acrylamide)/humic acid as outer coating [66]. Furthermore, another study reported that an increase of W H from 43.5% to 47.5% when double coated NPK fertilizer was added to the soil with sodium alginate and sodium alginate-g-poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/humic acid were used as inner and outer coatings, respectively [76]. Other studies show better improvement of soil W H with application of double coated NPK fertilizers using mainly synthetic polymers [72,73,77]. The water retention property (W R ) of soil without and with coated NPK products was evaluated against time and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 13b. The soil mixed with uncoated fertilizer was excluded from this measurement since uncoated fertilizer did not affect the soil water holding capacity (Fig. 13a). The presence of coated fertilizers has slight positive effect on the W R during the first 5 days. The W R capacity of the soil without coated fertilizers was about 40% on the 10th day and 20% on the 15th days, whereas this latter level was reached within 18-20th days for soil mixed with PVA@CNC-c-NPK coated products. After 26 days, total water content of the neat soil was approximately evaporated (0.13% remained), while soil mixed with PVA-c-NPK, PVA@CNC6%-c-NPK, PVA@CNC10%-c-NPK and PVA@CNC14.5%-c-NPK coated products still retained 3.85%, 5.29%, 5.45% and 5.77%, water, respectively. It can be obviously observed that the presence of coated NPK fertilizers in the soil increased its water retention performances. In comparison to PVA-c-NPK, good water retention was obtained with PVA@CNC-c-NPK coated products with slight effect of CNC content on water retention even if the former coating material showed excellent swelling capacity in water as discussed in Section 3.5. It can be argued that the compactness of the coating films influences the water evaporation rate, the less compact the film is, the fastest is the water diffusion into the film and the fastest is its evaporation as well. In the case of neat PVA film, the high-water diffusion rate was proved by its equilibrium swelling state (15 min) since it was reached the fastest. It can be concluded from these results that coated NPK fertilizer with PVA@CNC nanocomposites can effectively slow the water evaporation and improve the water retention capacity of soil."
19,Conclusion,"In this investigation, an ecofriendly slow-release NPK fertilizer was designed and produced by coating technology using fluidized bed technique. The coating materials were biodegradable formulations fabricated from cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) filled poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposites at different CNC loadings (6, 10 and 14.5 wt%). CNC with high suspension stability and large aspect ratio were extracted from hemp stalks and used for developing nanostructured CNC-filled PVA coating materials. The structural and rheological characterizations showed a good compatibility between CNC and PVA resulting in stable nanocomposite formulations with moderated viscosity, which was suitable for coating process. All coated NPK fertilizer products were obtained under optimum conditions with drying temperature of 80 °C, air flow of 50% and nozzle pressure of 0.4 bar. Considerable retardant release behavior in both water and soil media was observed after coating the NPK fertilizer with PVA/CNC, with preferable release durations attributed to high CNC content formulations. Indeed, the release longevity of N, P, K in soil increased from 3 to 5 days into 30 days after coating, which is generally in the norm of typical longevities of coated fertilizers with bio-based materials. The improved water holding, and retention capacities of the soil amended with the prepared PVA/CNC coated NPK fertilizer indicated the intrinsic water-saving property of the coating films. Furthermore, the crushing strength of NPK fertilizer was increased after the applied coating, indicating the good effect of the coating films in covering the surface irregularities of the studied NPK fertilizer. All these investigated characteristics reveal that the addition of CNC, as sustainable naturally derived nanomaterials into PVA polymer was a successful choice due to its remarkable positive effect at several levels for slow release fertilizer development. This study shows that facile preparation of waterborne coating formulation brought physical and chemical advantages to conventional NPK fertilizer in terms of structural stability, good nutrients release and water management."
