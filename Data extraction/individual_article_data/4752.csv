0,Introduction,"Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based elastomers cured by Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation chemistry have been widely used for micro-structure molding and patterning for the past 20 years and has been applied to various applications such as microfluidic chips, bioMEMS, and other micro-/nano-sized structures [1]. PDMS is known as a chemically stable material, however, some surface treatments can change the surface characteristics of PDMS significantly [2,3]. The basic principle of reproducing microfeatures with PDMS is to pour the crosslinkable PDMS solution into the inverted shape of the desired shape to solidify it. This requires that the inverted material does not adhere to PDMS. A commonly used soft lithography method utilizes materials such as SU-8 or AZ2014 that satisfy this condition [4]. This soft lithography method has been widely used since it is very useful for users to transfer and pattern microfeatures onto PDMS. It should be noted that designers must implement inverse-shaped microfeatures as the master mold to be patterned with PDMS. However, if the target microfeatures are to be replicated from a pre-existing or naturally-occurring object, then the problem is different since the fabricated PDMS will produce the inverted shape of the desired microfeature. Thus, an additional step is required to gain the original target microfeatures on PDMS by patterning the inversely inscribed microfeatures onto PDMS again. In this process, it is necessary to use the first PDMS casting as the master mold for a second PDMS casting. This process is often referred to as ‘double casting’. The problem here is that the pre-cured liquid state PDMS components of the final elastomer are thermodynamically compatible (miscible) and co-reactive with the first crosslinked inverted master mold. There is a general agreement that uncrosslinked low molecular weight siloxane species, which may be present in most common grades of PDMS elastomers, can migrate from the bulk to the surface [5]. Many of these species bear residual reactive groups, such as SiH and vinyl functionality, and can therefore react with complementary functional groups presented by the liquid state infusion of the pre-cured second PDMS elastomer formulation. Therefore, the two elastomers have a tendency for self-adhesion, and a method of avoiding this bonding mechanism is required. In order to prevent the PDMS master mold and PDMS casting from adhering, a remedy is to apply a thin (may be monomolecular) surface barrier coating. Monomolecular solid surface coatings have been actively studied for about 80 years [6]. In particular, the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) method has been widely used for surface coating of polymers since it enables relatively easy production of nm-thick coatings of molecules. This coating method has also been applied to PDMS to enable double casting [7]. One of the methods is to treat the surface of PDMS with plasma to selectively oxidize the surface with hydroxyl functional groups (OH groups) and other polar groups, which then can be chemically bonded with other molecules. Depending on the exposed material and conditions of exposure, different types of monolayers can be formed on the surface, and physical effects such as surface hardening through plasma-induced crosslinking often are observed. The chemicals used in plasma assisted surface coatings are very diverse; examples include perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) [8], hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) [9], polyethyleneglycol (PEG) [10], and mixed solutions (e.g. a mixture of 94% v/v isopropanol, 1% acetic acid, 1% Fluorolink S10, and 4% deionized water) [11]. Coating methods that chemically bond a monolayer to the surface using plasma treatment ensure high bonding strength and stability. However, most surface treatment materials require special handling and care. On the other hand, there are known methods of coating without plasma treatment, for which the materials used are trimethyl chlorosilane (TMSCI) [12], dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane [13], parylene C [14], polydopamine [15], and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) [16]. However, these plasma-free coatings also require special handling and may add multilayers to the surface of the PDMS. This means that the coating material can be transferred onto the surface of the PDMS cast during double casting. It is therefore not preferred for a double casting method that simply replicates the geometry with high fidelity. It is not easy to carry out the above-mentioned double casting methods in general laboratories because special materials or complicated handling processes are needed. Therefore, it seems beneficial to investigate simpler, cost- and time-efficient double casting methods. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient double casting method using plasma treatment and methanol/ethanol to overcome the limitations of the above-mentioned double casting methods (Fig. 1 A). The hypothesis is that the oxidized surface that results from plasma treatment can be treated by the alcohol to passivate the polar, potentially reactive groups present on the surface of the solidified PDMS (PDMS master mold) to prevent bonding with the added PDMS solution (PDMS casting). The remaining uncrosslinked molecules and polar oxygenated species can then be either coordinated or leached by exposure to methanol (or ethanol), which are both inexpensive and commonly found materials in most laboratories) without swelling or otherwise deforming the features of the mold. We have shown that by using the double casting method, microstructures can be successfully produced with high aspect ratios of 100 or more. Further, various surfaces existing in nature can be duplicated, and complex three-dimensional (3D) microstructures can be produced (Fig. 1B). The double casting method proposed in this study, which is named the ‘plasma-assisted double casting method (PDC method)’ for convenience, is relatively safe and time- and cost-effective for manufacturing microstructure patterns easily on PDMS. This cost-effective methodology can be applied to a variety of applications, such as replicating a single-use mold, and a variety of three-dimensional patterns existing in nature. It is expected that the PDC method could be applied to various sensor or chip manufacturing technologies and to microtechnology-based applications in chemistry, biology, medicine, and materials science."
1,Materials and methods,
2,PDMS double casting process using methanol/ethanol,"2.1 PDMS double casting process using methanol/ethanol The PDMS master mold and PDMS casting (Sylgard® 184, Dow, US) used in the double casting process were prepared using conventional manufacturing methods [17]. The prepolymer and curing agent were mixed at a ratio of 10:1 and baked at 80 °C for 2 h to solidify. After curing, the Young's modulus of PDMS was ∼2 MPa and the ultimate tensile strength was 6.25 MPa [18]. The material exhibited a tendency to tear when subjected to a higher force than the ultimate tensile strength. The first step for double casting is the process of making a master mold. Uncured PDMS solution is poured onto the object to be replicated and solidified by heat treatment. An air plasma treatment (PDC-32 G, Harrick Plasma, US) using atmospheric oxygen was performed for 30 s to convert the solidified PDMS surface to oxygenated groups, such as OH-groups. The alcohol exposure process was then performed using methanol (or ethanol). This PDMS was used as a master mold, and the PDMS solution for casting (10:1 prepolymer and curing agent) was poured into this master mold. Thereafter, the same heat treatment as in the case of the casting preparation (at 80 °C for 2 h) was performed to solidify the PDMS casting, and then the PDMS master mold and PDMS casting were separated. The pre-coated monolayer on the master mold interferes with the bonding of the PDMS master mold with the additionally poured PDMS and allows them to separate from each other after solidification. The whole double casting process is divided into six steps as follows: Step 1. Prepare PDMS master mold. Step 2. Plasma treatment for 30 s. Step 3. Expose PDMS to methanol (or ethanol) under vacuum for 30 min. Step 4. Remove and dry methanol (or ethanol) for 30 min in an 80 °C heating chamber. Step 5. Pour PDMS solution over the pre-treated PDMS under vacuum for 30 min. Step 6. Bake for 2 h and separate the pre-treated mold and solidified PDMS. By using this PDC method, hair, an ant’s head, and a lotus leaf were double-casted (Fig. 1)."
3,PDMS surface chemical analysis,"2.2 PDMS surface chemical analysis Three different types of surface treated PDMS and untreated PDMS (control) were compared. The surface treatments are listed in Table 1 ; the alcohol-treated samples were measured after 1 h of drying, and the plasma-treated samples were measured immediately after the plasma treatment. Alcohol-treated samples were measured after drying for 1 h, and plasma-treated samples were measured immediately after the plasma treatment. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of treated PDMS surfaces were recorded with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc., US). The FTIR spectra were recorded between 4000 and 400 cm−1 at 2 cm−1 intervals. Each spectrum resulted from 128 scans to obtain an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Each spectrum of the treated PDMS was corrected with a linear baseline using OMNIC software (v. 8.2, Thermo Scientific Inc.). The PDMS samples were also analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific Inc.) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV). The energy scale was adjusted based on the graphite peak in the C 1s spectrum at 284.8 eV. The analysis area was 400 μm in diameter and the pass energy was 40 eV. The O 1s, C 1s and Si 2p peaks were measured in non-scanned mode using 0.1 eV energy step."
4,Statistical analysis,"2.3 Statistical analysis To verify the data from the three regions, one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test was applied. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically meaningful difference."
5,Preparation of double casting samples,"2.4 Preparation of double casting samples To evaluate the PDC method, three different types of samples were tested. First, hair and toothbrush strands for high aspect ratio samples; second, a lotus leaf for micropatterned surface samples; and third, an ant head for complex 3D microstructures. A human hair (diameter 100 μm and length 20 mm) was used as a high aspect ratio sample for PDC (Fig. 1B). This hair was immersed in the PDMS solution to a depth of 1 cm and vacuumed with a vacuum pump to remove air bubbles. Then, the PDMS solution was solidified through heat treatment at 80 °C and the hair embedded in PDMS was pulled out with forceps. This PDMS with a negative hair shape was used as a master mold, and then a PDMS casting with a positive hair shape was obtained through the PDC steps as mentioned in section 2.1. In addition, PDC was also performed with toothbrush strands (High-elasticity ultra-fine classic, Oral-B, Procter and Gamble Korea, Republic of Korea) to verify whether a bundle of high aspect ratio objects can also be duplicated. There are several strand bundles in the toothbrush head, but for ease of observation, we removed most strand bundles and performed PDC using a single bundle. As a representative example of a hydrophobic surface with microstructures in nature, the lotus leaf surface was duplicated using PDC to show its ability to replicate the microstructure pattern and thus its hydrophobic characteristics (Fig. 1B). The solidification of the liquid PDMS proceeded at room temperature for more than 1 d to avoid damage to the lotus leaf from the heat treatment process required for curing of PDMS. In this process, the degassing and heating processes performed in the conventional soft lithography method were omitted in order to preserve the shape of the microstructures of the lotus leaf. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope, S-4300 N model, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan) images were used to compare the actual leaf surface with the PDMS lotus leaf surface. To confirm the reproducibility of the hydrophobic characteristics of the microstructure patterns on the lotus leaf by the double casted PDMS surface, the contact angles of water droplets (5 μL volume) on the surfaces both flat PDMS and PDMS lotus leaf were measured by taking pictures (Cannon's EOS M2 model, Canon Inc., Japan). The contact angles were then measured using the DropSnake plugin in ImageJ 1.46 (National Institutes of Health, US) An ant head is a good example of a three-dimensional microstructure (Fig. 1B). An ant was placed in a Petri dish and liquid PDMS was poured over it. To preserve the shape of the ant head, the solidification process of the liquid PDMS also proceeded at room temperature for more than 1 d, and the degassing and heating processes were omitted. Then, the solid-state PDMS containing the ant was cut at the border of the head and thorax of the ant, and the ant head was separated from the PDMS to make a master mold with the negative shape of an ant head. SEM images were taken for the ant head, the master mold of the ant head, and the PDMS ant head to analyze the replication quality by PDC."

7,PDMS surface characterization by ATR-IR and XPS,"3.1 PDMS surface characterization by ATR-IR and XPS The PDMS elastomer used in this study is cured by a Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction between the Si-vinyl groups of the prepolymer and Si-H-groups of the crosslinker to form a network of polymeric chains, which usually takes about 2 h when baking at 80 °C. However, it is inevitable that some uncrosslinked low-molecular-weight siloxane polymer chains remain, which can gradually diffuse from the bulk to the surface [5], and may crosslink with the second PDMS to form an integrally bonded lump. If the same procedure is followed after the PDC process on the cured PDMS (mold PDMS), the uncured PDMS solution (casting PDMS), which is poured onto the PDMS master mold and then cured, is very easily separated from the mold PDMS. This is because the PDC process leads to a chemical change on the mold PDMS surface. The two main steps in the PDC process for the mold PDMS are an air plasma treatment and washing by methanol (or ethanol). The plasma treatment oxidizes the surface to form a variety of polar species including OH groups on the PDMS surface by reacting with various H-containing species, such as methyl (CH3), CH2=CH (from prepolymer), and Si-H (from crosslinker) groups. However, this treatment alone does not inhibit bonding between the mold and casting PDMS; in fact, the oxygenated species will contribute higher surface energy groups that tend to promote wetting and adhesion of the casting. The plasma treatment alone also does not remove any of the aforementioned reactive uncrosslinked species that may be present at the surface that could participate in chemical reactions or favorable physical interactions across the interface with the casting layer [5]. The additional alcohol treatment (exposing the PDMS surface to methanol or ethanol) is therefore introduced to try to passivate any high energy oxygenated species and remove any remaining uncrosslinked prepolymer molecules from the surface without swelling and deformation of the elastomer. For example, the alcohols may passivate the surface polar species such as the −OH groups through hydrogen bonding, or drawing them away through a simple surface washing mechanism. Although the details of the mechanism are currently not fully understood, its resulting semi-permanent effect is clearly observed. This simple two-step treatment (oxidization by plasma treatment and passivation treatment by alcohol) effectively renders the PDMS mold non-adherent, while preserving the fidelity of the pattern transfer in the casting PDMS (Supplementary movie 2). To clarify the effect of the alcohol treatment, we exposed the PDMS to deionized water in separate tests using both room temperature and boiling water instead of alcohol. Neither the ambient nor hot water treatments produced a high quality double casting, suggesting that the alcohol is necessary to prevent self-adhesion of the casting PDMS to the plasma-treated cured PDMS master. ATR-IR was used to determine what chemical changes occurred on the surface of the PDMS when these two processes were carried out. Since ATR-IR probes 1–2 microns deep and plasma surface treatment effects may only penetrate a few nm [2], the changes in the IR spectrum due to surface modification are very small. However, the reproducibility of this IR spectrum was verified by repeating the test with multiple samples. Compared to the standard PDMS samples, the PDC samples showed a small difference near 3400 cm−1 (Fig. 2 A) corresponding to the broad OH region. When this region is magnified, it becomes clear that methanol and ethanol treatments decrease the absorbance intensity around 3400 cm−1 (Fig. 2B) relative to the plasma-treated sample. For the IR data of each sample, we set 3612 cm−1 as the baseline point and compared the difference between the value at 3612 cm−1 and the value near 3400 cm−1 (3398, 3400, and 3402 cm−1). This process can more quantitatively confirm the intensity increase due to the influence of the OH group, and enables comparison and analysis of the IR data measured from the prepared samples. The mean values of the differences were −5.73 × 10-4, −4.26 × 10-5, −1.01 × 10−4, and 4.46 × 10−5 for pure PDMS, methanol-treated PDMS, ethanol-treated PDMS and plasma-treated PDMS, respectively, showing a statistically significant reduction (p-value < 0.05, n = 45) (Fig. 2C) from the initial plasma-treated surface −OH region after alcohol treatment. This result suggests that when the OH group is activated by the plasma treatment and then exposed to methanol or ethanol, an interaction, either chemical or physical, occurs on the surface and persists through the processing. While it is known that plasma-treated PDMS surfaces can exhibit a post-treatment time dependent loss of oxidized species from the surface arising from rearrangements and diffusional effects, this passivation effect on the surface of the PDMS is maintained even after the casting process is repeated (more than 5 times in our experiments). The exact nature of the interactions that give rise to the surface passivation effect in the PDC process is unclear from our characterization, and further studies with more surface sensitive techniques would be needed to elucidate. Additionally, XPS measurements were conducted to detect changes in surface composition after the various treatments. The samples were tested immediately after treatment, and after aging for two weeks in ambient conditions (the corresponding XPS data are shown in Fig. S1). As shown in Table 2 , the elemental survey spectral summary confirms that plasma treatment alone induces oxidation of the surface, as signified by the large increase in average atomic oxygen content of the PDMS surface from 28 to 43 at.% (atomic percent), with a commensurate increase in O:Si ratio from the expected value of ∼1.0 for PDMS to 1.6. After aging in ambient conditions for two weeks, this level of oxygen does not significantly decrease in the plasma treated control sample, decreasing only slightly to 41 at.% with a 7.6% reduction in the O:Si ratio. However, the plasma treated samples that were exposed to methanol and ethanol treatments show surface oxygen concentrations that dropped from 46 to 37 at.% and 47 to 39 at.%, respectively, with respective reductions in the O:Si ratio of 20 and 18%, which is far more than those of the plasma or untreated control samples. Moreover, the C:Si and C:O ratios increased by 32 and 66%, respectively, for the aged methanol treated sample, and 34 and 63% for the respective ethanol treated samples. This is further evidence that alcohol treatments effectively reduce the concentration of oxygen rich (polar) groups at the surface, which act to raise the thermodynamic work of adhesion as well as provide potential covalent grafting sites for the wet PDMS. Several mechanisms are plausible for this effect, including: rinsing or leaching of uncrosslinked oxidized material; mobilization of surface rearrangements that help promote diffusion of the polar groups away from the free surface where they would be enthalpically disfavored because of their higher surface free energy; chemical reactions such as alkoxylation of carboxylic acid or Si−OH groups; non-covalent association such as hydrogen bonding with such groups to passivate them; or by some combination thereof. Regardless of the mechanism(s), the large reduction in oxygen content at the surface as a function of aging provides direct spectroscopic evidence that correlates to the high-fidelity mold release properties demonstrated in the following sections."
8,PDMS double casting process of high-aspect-ratio micro objects (hair and bristles),"3.2 PDMS double casting process of high-aspect-ratio micro objects (hair and bristles) The PDC process performed for hair replication follows the six steps mentioned above (Fig. 1). The PDMS master mold of step 1 was obtained by solidification after inserting the hair into the PDMS. The hair had a thin, long cylindrical shape with a thickness of 100 μm and a length of 10 mm. After the solidification of the PDMS, the hair was pulled out with forceps to complete the master mold (Fig. 3 A, i). In step 2, the surface of the master mold was oxidized by plasma treatment. The plasma treatment used in this experiment has the advantage that it does not require an additional oxygen supply because it uses the 21% (v/v) native oxygen present in the atmosphere. The plasma treated PDMS surface is oxidized to form an OH group, which can either chemical react or form a hydrogen bonded physical association with methanol to form a molecular layer on the surface (step 3). After immersing the PDMS in methanol, a vacuum was applied for 30 min to prevent the formation of air bubbles between the microstructures. Step 4 is the process of removing methanol/ethanol. The PDMS is removed from methanol/ethanol and dried in a heating chamber at 80 °C for 30 min. This process leaves only the reacted monolayer on the surface of the PDMS. Step 5 is the same as the conventional PDMS casting process and includes a vacuum process for removing bubbles and a heat treatment process for solidification. In step 6, a small amount of methanol was used to smoothly separate the surface-treated master mold and PDMS casting. The PDMS-PDMS separation using methanol is the same as the process for easily separating the PDMS and silicon wafer performed in the conventional lithography method. Through this process, we succeeded in copying the hair shape to the PDMS (Fig. 3A). Its structural form and micropatterns are found to be identical to actual hair (Fig. 3A, ii – SEM image of real hair, and iii – SEM image of PDMS-duplicated hair). The thickness of the PDMS hair as determined by SEM is 100 μm and the total length is 10 mm. This has a high aspect ratio that has not been introduced in previous double casting studies. Additionally, PDC of toothbrush bristles confirmed the capabilities of PDC even when an object with a high aspect ratio exists in a bundle form (about 50 strands) (Fig. 3B). The bristles were immersed in uncured PDMS, the PDMS was solidified and the toothbrush was removed to form a negative mold (Fig. 3B, i - iii). After the PDC process was performed on the prepared negative mold, we proceeded in the same way as we did with the hair to obtain large aspect ratio PDMS strands. The thickness of the middle portion of the bristles is about 100 μm and is less than 10 μm at the ends. Through this PDC process, bristles less than 10 μm thick could be duplicated (Fig. 3B). At this time, small aspect ratio PDMS structures are easily separated even without using methanol, but large aspect ratio structures such as hair and bristles can be separated by lowering the surface energy by using methanol (Supplementary movie 1)."
9,Duplication of microstructure patterned surface (lotus leaf),"3.3 Duplication of microstructure patterned surface (lotus leaf) The lotus leaf is famous for its striking hydrophobic nature and self-cleaning ability, thanks to the microstructures on its surface. The diameter of microstructures patterned on the actual lotus leaf used in our study was approximately 5–7 μm (Fig. 4 A). Submicron structures were also observed covering the whole surface of the microstructures (Fig. 4B); this hierarchical structure on both micron and submicron scales observed in the actual lotus leaf is the source of its superhydrophobicity, known as the lotus effect [19]. On the surface of the PDMS lotus leaf fabricated by the PDC method, there are the papillae of approximately 5–7 μm diameter, which is the same size as those on the lotus leaf. The difference, however, is that no submicron structures were found on the surface of the PDMS replica of the lotus leaf (Fig. 4C and D), implying that the resolution of our PDC method is ∼1 μm. We, therefore, tested how much the hydrophobicity effect relies on the submicron structures. Water droplets formed more spherically on the surface of the PDMS lotus leaf with double casted microstructures compared with a flat PDMS surface (Fig. 4E and F). The water contact angle on an untreated PDMS surface was approximately 108° (standard deviation = 3.84, and n = 36 on a flat PDMS surface) (Fig. 4G). The water contact angle on the actual lotus leaf surface is reported to be about 152° [20], which is very close to the water contact angle we measured on the surface of the PDMS lotus leaf of 151.97° (standard deviation = 8.21, and n = 14 on the PDMS lotus leaf surface). This close agreement in water contact angles between the actual lotus leaf and the PDMS replica compared to the flat, unpatterned PDMS surface indicate that the hydrophobicity of the PDMS was enhanced by the microstructures fabricated using PDC. Through the SEM image, the resolution limitation (∼1 μm) of the PDC method by the double casting of the microstructure of the lotus leaf surface was confirmed. This resulted in no significant difference between the contact angle of the actual lotus leaf and PDMS lotus leaf. Through contact angle measurement, it is confirmed that the PDC method can be used to replicate surfaces with various functional microstructures present in nature (like the drag force reduction of shark skin [21], the dry adhesion mechanism in gecko lizards [22], and the self-cleaning of lotus leaf [23]). As the wetting property of PDMS is determined by the casting material, the resolution of the pattern will also be different for each material. However, due to the virtually universal PDMS wetting property, the resolution of the pattern is already determined in the PDMS master fabrication step, before the double casting treatment. Apart from the analysis regarding the duplication of the lotus leaf surface characteristics, the contact angle of the surface treated PDMS with the plasma treatment, plasma treatment + ethanol, and plasma treatment + methanol was measured, and the measured contact angles were 43.5° ± 5.62 (n = 11), 39.8° ± 5.29 (n = 10), 38.6° ± 3.30 (n = 10), respectively, however, the difference is not statistically significant (see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Materials)."
10,Duplication of three-dimensional microstructure (ant head),"3.4 Duplication of three-dimensional microstructure (ant head) The PDMS ant head, which was fabricated with the PDC method using methanol, demonstrates the capability of the method to cast complicated three-dimensional shapes on a microscale. The shape of the entire head (Fig. 5 A) with compound eyes (Fig. 5B), and hairs (Fig. 5C) were clearly observed on an actual ant head. At a higher magnification, the measured hair diameter was ∼3.5 μm (Fig. 5D). The three-dimensional shape, skin pattern, and compound eyes of an ant were successfully reproduced by PDC. For the PDMS ant head replica, not only the whole ant-head shape (Fig. 5E), but also the compound eyes (Fig. 5F) and skin pattern (Fig. 5G) were successfully replicated. The mechanical vulnerability of the ant head tissue caused destruction of the high aspect ratio hairs and antennae on the ant head during preparation of the PDMS master before the double casting treatment; there were therefore no intact hairs or antennae to replicate on the PDMS ant head (Figs. 5E and 5 H). On the other hand, despite the high aspect ratio, the shapes of the bristles and human hair were maintained during the fabrication of the master mold by their mechanical rigidity, and these were completely replicated in the PDMS (Fig. 3)."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, a simple double casting method that utilizes plasma treatment followed by alcohol exposure was introduced. Methanol- (or ethanol-) based treatment subsequent to plasma treatment results in passivation or removal of oxygen-rich adhesion-promoting species present in the oxidized PDMS master mold to effectively prevent adhesion to a PDMS casting. Through this surface treatment, it is possible to double cast not only single-micron-scale patterns but also high aspect ratio structures such as hair. It is thus possible to replicate most microstructures in nature such as soft petals, as well as replicate micropatterned PDMS devices. Since various microstructures can be fabricated easily at low cost using this PDC method, it can be used in various microengineering fields including bioMEMS, 3D microfluidic systems, and hydro-phobic/philic topology techniques. This surface treatment technique can be achieved using plasma equipment and ethanol (which are widely used in many laboratories), and the process is very simple and time-effective (total 1 h: 30 s of plasma, 30 min of alcohol exposure, and 30 min of dry). These results motivate future study of the characteristics of various surfaces in nature by using the double casting method introduced in this paper. The efficacy of this technique and the surface analysis performed in this study suggest that further investigation of its mechanism through a variety of complementary surface characterization techniques would also be worthwhile."
