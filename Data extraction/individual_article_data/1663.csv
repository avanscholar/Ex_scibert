0,Introduction,"Alcohol oxidase (AOx; EC. 1.1.3.13) catalyzes the oxidation of alcohols into the corresponding carbonyl compound and hydrogen peroxide. It is an octamer of approximately 600 kDa and each subunit has a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor [1]. It can be categorized into four groups based on the substrate specificity, including short-chain alcohol oxidase, long-chain alcohol oxidase, aromatic alcohol oxidase, and secondary alcohol oxidase [2]. Most of the AOxs are from yeasts such as Pichia pastoris, Pichia angusta, Candida boidinii and filamentous fungi including Penicillium chrysogenum and Cladosporium fulvum. The genes encoding the AOx protein were summarized by Ozimek, Veenhuis and van der Klei [1]. Alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris is encoded by two different genes, AOx1 and AOx2 [3]. Two fractions in AOx from Pichia pastoris were labeled as labile (L) and resistant (R) according to their thermal stability and presumably correspond to each of the two isozymes. The R fraction only accounted for approximately one-third of the total activity of the L + R mixture [4]. Alcohol oxidase is used to detect and quantify alcohols. It is important in clinical and forensic analyses of human fluids such as blood, urine, and serum. It can be used for quality control in the food, beverage, and pulp industries, and to monitor the progress of alcoholic fermentations [5]. Alcohol oxidase-based electrochemical biosensors have been developed to shorten the assay time required by other chemical methods, such as those that use chromatographic separations before colorimetric, electrochemical, or spectroscopic detection [6]. Alcohol oxidase can also be used to synthesize carbonyl compounds that are important to produce solvents, pharmaceuticals, or in fragrances and flavors. For example, AOx catalyzes the synthesis of n-heptanal, the starting material of important aroma and flavor compounds [7]. This AOx-catalyzed reaction is important because it does not produce undesirable or harmful by-products. However, the development of practical AOx-based biosensors and AOx-based industrial bioconversions is hampered by the low activity, the poor stability, and the high cost of the enzyme [2,8,9]. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) has been used in the food industry to extend the shelf life of products by killing microbes and inactivating enzymes. However, pressures below 300 MPa have activated and stabilized some enzymes. The enhancing effects of HHP on various enzymes and enzymatic hydrolysis of food proteins were well summarized by Eisenmenger and Reyes-De-Corcuera [10] and Marciniak, Suwal, Naderi, Pouliot and Doyen [11]. We have reported the stabilizing effect of HHP on glucose oxidase (GOx) [12], AOx [4], xanthine oxidase (XOx) [13], pyruvate oxidase (POx) [14], and a GOx biosensor [15]. The stability of the L fraction AOx was 14 times greater at 49.4 °C and 160 MPa than at the same temperature at 0.1 MPa [4]. The stabilizing effect of HHP resulted in a faster reaction rate by enabling enzymes to work at high temperatures under which they would normally be inactivated [16]. Furthermore, HHP alone can increase the catalytic activity of some enzymes. For example, we reported that HHP increased the catalytic activity of native, aniline-modified, or benzoate-modified GOx at temperatures ranging from 25 to 69.1 °C, and reached the maximum activity at around 180 MPa. The combined effects of temperature and HHP increased the activity of aniline-modified GOx 11.3-fold [17]. The optimal pressure of 180 MPa for GOx activity was also the optimal pressure for its stability [12]. The activity of lipase from Candida rugosa increased by 4.8-fold at 200 MPa and 45 °C [18]. The activity of polyphenol oxidase from peach or blueberry increased by 66.5 % at 200 MPa and 45 °C [19] or 6.1-fold at 500 MPa and 30 °C [20], respectively. The activity of fructotransferase from Arthrobacter aurescens increased by 33.8 % at 200 MPa and 60 °C [21]. Therefore, the increase in the activity of some enzymes at high pressures and relatively high temperatures can be attributed to both the stabilizing effect and activating effect of HHP. Possible mechanisms of how the HHP affects the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions were summarized by Eisenmenger and Reyes-De-Corcuera [10] and include changing the protein conformation, changing the rate-limiting step, or changing the property of the substrate or solvent such as the density. One can hypothesize that there is an equilibrium between conformational states of the enzyme and that a given conformation is more stable than another one. Therefore, when pressure is applied, following Le Chatelier’s principle, the equilibrium will shift towards the condition in which equilibrium is regained that favors the conformation with the smallest molar volume. However, one cannot extrapolate Le Chatelier’s principle to the analysis of the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction because the reactants and products of the reaction are not in equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of high pressure on the activity of AOx have not been studied. We hypothesized that similar to GOx, the activity of AOx would be higher at HHP than at ambient pressure. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the activity of AOx at selected pressures near the optimal pressure for maximal stability and at temperatures that do not cause enzyme inactivation."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials and equipment,"2.1 Materials and equipment Alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris was purchased from MP Biochemicals (Solon, OH, USA). Peroxidase (POD) from horseradish was purchased from the MilliporeSigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol (99.9 %), hydrogen peroxide (30 %), and potassium phosphate monobasic were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, USA). 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, 98 %) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). All chemicals were reagent grade. The high-pressure system used in this report was previously described by Halalipour, Duff, Howell and Reyes-De-Corcuera [17]. The high-pressure cell was connected to a spectrometer (model SD2000) and a light source (model DH-2000-BAL) with optic fibers (core diameter 400 μm) from Ocean Optics (Dunedin, FL, USA). A type K thermocouple was inserted into the high-pressure reactor to measure the temperature. The schematic of the HHP system is shown in Fig. 1 . Cylindrical quartz cuvettes were selected to snugly fit in the high-pressure optical cell. The cuvettes were made of a quartz tubing (inside diameter 7.4 mm, outside diameter 9.6 mm, length 20.8 mm) enclosed with two polytetrafluoroethylene caps with O-rings. The volume of the cuvettes with caps on and with two small magnetic beads in (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) was approximately 340 μL. Silicone oil (Sil 180 Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL) was used as the pressurization fluid. OceanView 1.5.0 software from Ocean Optics was used to collect data. A microplate reader (model SynergyTM HTX, BioTek, Winooski, VT) was used to determine the activity of AOx at atmospheric pressure to prepare the enzyme stock solutions and ensure similar initial activity for all the samples."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Enzyme activity assay at atmospheric pressure The enzyme activity assay was modified from the method used by Buchholz-Afari, Halalipour, Yang and Reyes-De-Corcuera [4]. The change in absorbance at 405 nm at 25 °C was recorded for 5 min after mixing 10 μL of an AOx aliquot (approximate concentration 0.074 U mL−1) with other reagents to a final concentration of 3.0 mU mL−1 AOx, 10.0 U mL−1 POD, 1.6 % (v/v) methanol, and 2.0 mM ABTS. All solutions were prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The absorbance was measured with the microplate reader with ABTS and methanol added with automatic injectors. The AOx sample and POD were put on ice when not in use. One unit of AOx was defined as oxidizing one micromole of methanol to formaldehyde per minute at 25 °C at pH 7.5. The AOx enzyme activity was calculated using Eq. 1, modified from the enzyme activity methods by Keesey [22] and Janssen and Ruelius [23], referenced by MilliporeSigma. (1) E Acty U mL -1 = d A 405 dt × V T V E × ε p,T Where A405 is the absorbance at 405 nm, t is the time in minutes, VT is the total volume of the reaction solution, VE is the volume of enzyme stock solution, and ε p,T is the extinction coefficient of oxidized ABTS at the selected temperature and pressure. 2.2.2 Determination of two enzyme fractions and the difference in their thermal stability The commercial AOx formulation used in our previous study was from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company. We reported that the enzyme contained a labile (L) fraction and a resistant (R) fraction [4]. To verify that the enzyme formulation from MP Biochemicals used in this research contained the two fractions, AOx aliquots were diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and heated in a water bath at 50 °C for up to 240 min. The enzyme activity was determined after each heating time as described in section 2.2.1. The residual activity was calculated as the ratio of the activity after each heating treatment time over the activity at time 0. Two linear regions on the plots of the logarithm of residual activity vs. heating time were used to determine the two enzyme fractions [4]. The R fraction was obtained by heating the AOx sample in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 50 °C for 15 min and then immediately cooled in ice. After heating for 15 min, the residual activity of the L fraction was negligible as calculated by extrapolation of the linear regression, while over 95 % of the activity of the R fraction was retained. The residual activity of the L fraction in the L + R fraction was calculated by subtracting the residual activity of the R fraction. The difference in the thermal stability of the L + R fractions (no heat treatment) and the R fraction was determined by heating each of the two fractions in a water bath at 50 °C for up to 3 min and calculating the pseudo-first-order rate constant of inactivation. 2.2.3 Determination of the extinction coefficient (εp,T) of oxidized ABTS To account for the effect of temperature and pressure on the extinction coefficient (ε p,T) of oxidized ABTS, the ε p,T at all the temperature-pressure combinations used for enzyme activity measurements were determined. A volume of 12 mL of 3.125 mM ABTS was oxidized by 100 μL of approximately 30 mM H2O2 and 3 mL of 62.5 U mL−1 POD. The final concentration of the solution was 2.5 mM ABTS, 0.2 mM H2O2, and 12.4 U mL−1 POD. As the blank, a solution without H2O2 but with the same concentrations of POD and ABTS was used. The H2O2 was not in excess and was assumed to be fully consumed when the absorbance of diluted oxidized ABTS at 405 nm at 25 °C remained constant for 30 min. The effective path length of cylindrical quartz cuvettes was determined by comparing the absorbance of the oxidized ABTS with the standard 1 cm quartz cuvettes. The ABTS and the blank solutions were diluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to ensure the absorbance signal was within the detecting limit. Because the exact concentration of H2O2 was not known due to the instability of H2O2 solutions, the concentration of the diluted oxidized ABTS was calculated according to Beer’s Law using the extinction coefficient of oxidized ABTS (ε = 36.8 mM−1 cm−1) at 25 °C. The diluted oxidized ABTS was used as the stock solution with a concentration of 0.024 mM. The concentration changes induced by pressure were corrected by using the volume ratio V 0.1 MPa, 25 °C / Vp , T of water. A volume of 340 μL of the diluted oxidized ABTS was pipetted into the cylindrical quartz cuvette to put into the high-pressure system each time. The absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at temperature-pressure combinations of 30 °C, 35 °C, 40 °C, 45 °C, or 50 °C and 0.1 MPa, 40 MPa, 80 MPa, 120 MPa, 160 MPa, or 200 MPa. The εp, T was calculated using Beer’s Law. 2.2.4 In-situ enzyme activity determination The in-situ enzyme activity was determined by measuring the rate of change of absorbance at 405 nm in the cylindrical quartz cuvette at selected temperatures and pressures. Two miniature magnetic bars were placed in the cuvette and the reagents were sequentially pipetted to final concentrations of 3.0 mU mL−1 AOx, 10.0 U mL−1 POD, 1.6 % (v/v) methanol, and 2.0 mM ABTS in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The total volume of the reaction mixture was 340 μL. Then the quartz cuvette was closed with the Teflon cap avoiding the inclusion of air bubbles. As the blank, a solution without AOx but with the same concentrations of all the reagents was used. The solutions were mixed by flipping the cuvette 5 times before inserting it into the high-pressure reactor. The absorbance was then measured by the spectrometer connected to the high-pressure optical cell. Instead of using arbitrary units, AOx activity was calculated as the reaction rate: (2) Reaction rate μM min -1 = d A 405 dt × 1000 L × ε p,T Where 1000 is the conversion factor from mM to μM, L is the pathlength of the cuvette, and all other symbols are as in Eq. 1 2.2.5 Effect of HHP on the activity of AOx Enzyme solutions were prepared fresh by diluting AOx with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to a concentration of 0.074 ± 0.005 U mL−1, verified as described in section 2.2.1. The in-situ activities of the combined L + R fractions and of the R fraction AOx were measured as described in section 2.2.4 at the temperature-pressure combinations of 30 °C, 40 °C, or 50 °C and at 0.1 MPa, 80 MPa, or 160 MPa. The high-pressure reactor filled with silicone oil was kept at 10 °C when the cuvette was placed in. The selected pressure was applied before the temperature was raised by switching the valves that connect the reactor jacket to the water baths (Fig. 1). The recording of the absorbance started when the temperature of the HHP system reached 95 % of the set temperature and lasted for at least 3 min and at a rate of at least one measurement per second. Because when the HHP reactor is pressurized, the temperature is measured outside the quartz cuvette, a temperature correction was determined to ensure the correct temperature transient inside the cuvette. A thermocouple was placed at the center inside the quartz cuvette filled with water. At atmospheric pressure, the temperature transients inside and outside the cuvette were recorded simultaneously by both the thermocouples when the system was set to 30 °C, 40 °C, or 50 °C. The temperature difference tests were done in triplicate at each temperature. An example of the difference of the temperatures inside and outside the cuvette at 30 °C can be found in the supplemental material Fig. S1. Because the temperature inside the cuvette increased slowly during the entire experiment, the changes of absorbance were recorded at temperatures inside the cuvette within -2 °C to 2 °C of the set point of temperatures."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis A randomized complete block design with temperatures as blocks was used. Each temperature was used as a block because it was time-consuming for the HHP system to switch to different temperatures due to the slow heating or cooling speed of the water baths. All treatments were done in triplicate. Statistical analyses (ANOVA and general linear model) were conducted using Minitab 16 software (State College, PA, USA) or JMP Pro 14 software (Cary, NC, USA). Tukey’s method was used for multiple comparisons. To quantify the effect of temperature on the kinetics of AOx catalyzed at different pressures, the activation energy was calculated using the linearized form of Arrhenius equation (Eq. 3). (3) ln k T = - E a R × 1 T + ln k 0 Where kT is the rate constant of reaction at the temperature T, k0 is the rate constant at a reference temperature, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1). Similarly, to determine the effect of HHP on the reaction rate, the activation volume was calculated using the linearized form of Eyring’s equation based on the transition-state theory (Eq. 5). (4) Ln k p = - Δ V ≠ RT + Ln k 0 Where ΔV≠ is the activation volume, kp is the rate constant of reaction at a pressure p, and k0 is the rate constant of at a reference pressure."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Enzyme fractions and their difference on stability,"3.1 Enzyme fractions and their difference on stability To confirm the existence of the two fractions with different thermal stability of AOx purchased from MP Biochemicals used in this research, aliquots of the diluted enzyme solution were heated at 50 °C for up to 240 min. The changes in the logarithm of residual activity of the AOx vs. heating time when heated at 50 °C for up to 60 min is shown in Fig. 2 A. The thermal inactivation of AOx did not follow the first-order kinetics and the curve started to level off after heating for 2 min. There are two linear regions in Fig. 2A. The first linear region (heating time 0.75–2 min) is enlarged as Fig. 2B. The second linear region is shown in Fig. 2C. These two regions are consistent with Buchholz-Afari, Halalipour, Yang and Reyes-De-Corcuera [4]. In P. pastoris, of two genes that code for two proteins, AOx1 accounts for the majority of the activity while AOx2 accounts for approximately one-third of the total activity [3]. As discussed in our previous report [4], because similar thermal inactivation behavior has been observed in other systems containing isozymes, it was reasonable to assume that each of the two fractions with different thermal stability identified in the two linear regions on the curve (Fig. 2B and C) correspond to the two isozymes of AOx. As in our previous report, we designated the first linear region as the labile (L) fraction and the second region as the resistant (R) fraction. The kinetics of the L + R fractions and the R fraction were studied separately because of their different thermal stability. We were unable to physically separate the L fraction from the mixture because of the very small difference in the molecular weight of the two isozymes [4]. Therefore, the activity of the R fraction was determined by inactivating the L fraction through heating the combined L + R fractions at 50 °C for 15 min, as described in section 2.2.2. The calculated residual activity of the labile fraction after 15 min at 50 °C was 0.06 % as calculated from extrapolation of the logarithm of the residual activity for the labile fraction (derived from the linear regression from Fig. 2B, ln(residual activity) = −0.519 t + 4.9807 where t is incubation time and the residual activity is expressed in percent relative to the activity of the fresh enzyme). . The activity of the L + R fractions was also characterized and the effect of HHP on the L fraction was determined by difference. After heating for 15 min at 50 °C, the residual activity corresponding to the R fraction was ∼35 % of the L + R (total) fresh activity. Also, the activity of the L fraction decreased during frozen storage. The residual activity of the R fraction AOx after heating was approximately 25 % about one year before this study was done indicating that the L fraction was more abundant. Therefore, unless a fresh batch of the enzyme is obtained, it is difficult to obtain the same ratio of the two fractions. The pseudo-first-order rate constant of inactivation (kinact) calculated from the linear region in Fig. 2B and corresponding to the L + R fractions was 0.53 ± 0.05 min−1 or 156 times greater than the kinact (3.4 ± 0.1 × 10-3 min−1) of the R fraction calculated from the linear region in Fig. 2C. The kinact of the L + R fractions was comparable to 0.66 min−1 reported by Buchholz-Afari, Halalipour, Yang and Reyes-De-Corcuera [4] using the AOx purchased from a different supplier, suggesting the similarity of the AOx from the two suppliers. In contrast, the kinact of the R fraction was much lower than the 0.19 min−1 previously reported by Buchholz-Afari, Halalipour, Yang and Reyes-De-Corcuera [4] who used the R fraction where the L fraction might not have been completely inactivated by only heating 4 min at 50 °C. We cannot explain such difference without a detailed structural analysis of the enzymes from the two batches, which is beyond the scope of this study. This difference in stability and the conditions under which either the L + R or the R fractions cause enzyme inactivation were critical in the design of enzyme activity determinations at HHP of this study."
7,"Effect of HHP and temperature on the εp,T of oxidized ABTS","3.2 Effect of HHP and temperature on the εp,T of oxidized ABTS To adjust the effects of pressure and temperature on the extinction coefficient of oxidized ABTS, the εp,T of the oxidized ABTS at each pressure-temperature treatment was tested and reported in Table 1 . The values in the parentheses are the ratio of Vp, T / V0.1 MPa, 25 °C of water (from NIST Chemistry WebBook, SRD 69). The concentration of the oxidized ABTS was multiplied by the ratio to correct the effect of pressure and temperature on the volume of the solution. The values of ε increased as the pressure or the temperature increased. The effect of temperature on ε was significant (p < 0.05) using the general linear model (GLM). This was in accordance with Mukerji, Bhattacharji and Dhar [24] who reported the increase of the extinction coefficient of chromic acid, iodine, and potassium oxalate with the increase of temperature. However, it was different from o-dianisidine reported by Halalipour, Duff, Howell and Reyes-De-Corcuera [17], where the ε p,T decreased when temperatures increased. The importance of correcting the effect of temperature on the ε p,T to get accurate results was emphasized by Kim and Liu [25] through estimating the errors when calculating the concentrations of hemoglobin without considering the variation of the ε p,T. The effect of pressure on ε p,T was not significant (p < 0.05) using the GLM. Only at 30 °C, pressure had a significant influence (p < 0.05) on the ε p,T using one-way ANOVA. It was not significant (p < 0.05) at other temperatures. Differently, the ε p,T of o-dianisidine reported by Halalipour, Duff, Howell and Reyes-De-Corcuera [17] was higher at high pressures above 0.1 MPa. These differences may be from the different interactions of the sulfonate groups on ABTS and the methoxy or amine groups on o-dianisidine at different temperatures and pressures, and thereby affecting the way these compounds interact with light. For the ε p,T of oxidized ABTS in all the temperature-pressure conditions, the lowest ε was 32.9 ± 0.5 mM−1 cm−1 at 0.1 MPa and 30 °C and the highest ε p,T was 38.5 ± 5.4 mM−1 cm−1 at 200 MPa and 50 °C. The determined ε p,T of oxidized ABTS at each temperature-pressure treatment was used to calculate the enzyme activity determined in the corresponding conditions."
8,Effect of HHP on the activity of AOx,"3.3 Effect of HHP on the activity of AOx To assess the effect of HHP on the activity of AOx at different temperatures, the reaction rates of the L + R fractions and of the R fraction AOx were determined at 30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C, and at 0.1–160 MPa. The lowest temperature of 30 °C was selected because, at atmospheric pressure, the rate of inactivation of both the L and the R fraction is negligible within the timeframe of the experiment. The highest temperature was selected to assess the combined effects of enzyme stabilization and potential enzyme activation by HHP. The upper limit of the pressure range was selected based on our previous study in which the optimal pressure for stability was 160−200 MPa [4] and because preliminary experiments showed that at 200 MPa AOx activity of the L + R fractions was smaller than at 160 MPa. The freshly prepared enzyme stock solution was diluted to 0.078 ± 0.005 U mL−1 or 3.2 ± 0.2 μM min−1 at 25 °C and 0.1 MPa. To minimize the error associated with the preparation of the enzyme stock solution, all the enzyme activity tests of the R fraction at three different temperature blocks were performed on the same day that the solution was prepared. The reaction rates of the L + R fractions at all the experimental conditions are listed in Table 2 . At 30 °C, the rate of reaction increased with pressure as revealed by one-way ANOVA. At that temperature for the duration of the experiment, the enzyme did not inactivate as indicated by the linear increase in absorbance vs. time (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, we can attribute the increase in the rate of reaction to pressure alone, like in the case of GOx [17]. In contrast, for enzyme activity measurements at 50 °C and 0.1 MPa, the increase in absorbance with respect to time started to level off by the time the sample reached 95 % of the setpoint temperature, as shown in Fig. 3B. Therefore, in Table 2, the increase in the rate of the AOx-catalyzed oxidation of methanol with pressure at 40 °C and at 50 °C is a combination of increased enzyme stability and catalytic activity. At atmospheric pressure, the rate of reaction decreased with temperature due to the overwhelming effect of heat inactivation of the enzyme. At 40 °C and atmospheric pressure, the activity reported in Table 2 is lower than what can be calculated for the R fraction alone from Table 3 . But it is in fact an artifact of not having initial rates and a linear rage during the activity measurement. Thus, the inactivation of the labile fraction greatly biases this estimate. At the intermediate pressures, the absence of an increase in the reaction rate is most likely the result of the antagonistic effects of pressure stabilization and activation of the enzyme and the thermal inactivation. However, at 160 MPa the rate of inactivation of the L fraction of AOx at 50 °C is very small [4]; therefore, the rate of reaction represents the enzyme activity under these conditions. At 160 MPa, there were no significant differences in activity among temperatures. This contrasts to our [17,26] and others’ findings [21] that by virtue of the stabilizing effect of pressure, one can increase the enzyme activity by increasing temperature without thermally inactivating other enzymes. A maximal activity for AOx regardless of whether it is pressure or temperature that raises its catalytic efficiency was around 16-18 μM min−1. Since there were no significant differences in activity between treatments at 0.1 MPa and 80 MPa or between treatments at 120 MPa and 160 MPa, for the remainder of the study, i.e. experiment with the R fraction, we only used 0.1, 80, and 160 MPa. To study the R fraction, after inactivating the L fraction at 50 °C, the enzyme stock solution as diluted to a lesser extent to obtain an initial activity similar to what we obtained for the combined L + R fractions. The pressure did not have a significant effect on the activity of the R fraction at any of the studied temperatures as shown in Table 3. Although at 50 °C activity at 80 MPa was greater than at 0.1 MPa, such an increase resulted from the stabilizing effect of pressure and not by a pressure-induced activation. Indeed, at 0.1 MPa the R fraction is thermally inactivated as we reported earlier [4] and as indicated by the deviations from linearity of absorbance vs. time. The activities of the R fraction at 80 or 160 MPa and 50 °C were not significantly different (17.9 ± 3.6 and 17.7 ± 0.8 μM min−1, respectively) but they were ∼3 times greater than activity at 30 °C. However, the stabilizing effect of HHP enabled the R fraction AOx to work at higher temperatures without detectable denaturation within the duration of our experiments and resulted in a higher reaction rate than at lower temperatures. At 160 MPa and 50 °C, the enzyme activity of the L + R fractions was 18.4 ± 2.7 μM min−1, similar to the activity of the R fraction in the same conditions, 17.7 ± 0.8 μM min−1. Relative to ambient conditions (25 °C and 0.1 MPa) this represents a ∼6-fold increase in enzyme activity. The stabilizing effect of HHP contributed to the increase in the enzyme activity of both AOx fractions at high temperatures by protecting the enzymes from thermal inactivation. Although during the assay time, the loss of activity of the L + R fraction was negligible, the rate of inactivation of the L + R fraction at 50 °C and 160 MPa is still much greater than that of the R fraction. Therefore, for practical applications, at atmospheric pressure, the often neglected R fraction should be considered. For example, using the R fraction may reduce the rapid decrease in the operational life of AOx-based alcohol biosensors which is a major hurdle in the successful development of commercial devices [9]. At 160 MPa and 30 °C, the L + R fractions are almost as catalytically active as the R fraction alone at 160 MPa and 50 °C. However, at 160 MPa and 30 °C both fractions are very stable. Extrapolation of the rate constants of inactivation from our previous study [4] lead to an anomaly in which the rate of inactivation of the R fraction is greater than the rate of inactivation of the L fraction. This is not surprising because extrapolations of logarithmic plots are prone to such errors and should be interpreted carefully. A very conservative estimate of the rate constant of inactivation for the two fractions would be to multiply by one order of magnitude the largest of the two. That rate of inactivation would be 5.5 ☓10-3 min−1 or almost three times greater than the rate of inactivation of the R fraction at 50 °C. Therefore, for a practical approach, using both factions and increasing the pressure to 160 MPa makes sense from a stability and activity perspective. In contrast, and against our original hypothesis, increasing the temperature beyond 30 °C and use the R fraction alone, would not provide any practical advantage. The dependence of the R fraction activity on the temperature was further characterized by calculating the apparent activation energy (Ea) shown in Table 3. The Ea at 80 MPa, 41.4 ± 10.5 kJ mol−1, was not significantly different from Ea at 160 MPa, 43.8 ± 7.8 kJ mol−1 confirming that, under the conditions of this study, pressure does not have a direct effect on the R fraction of AOx. Because at 0.1 MPa only treatments at 30 or 40 °C did not inactivate AOx, Ea at that pressure was not determined at that pressure. This inactivation at 50 °C observed during the short duration of the activity assay appears to contradict the very small inactivation, only 5% that we estimated after 15 min at the same temperatures. However, Lopez-Gallego et al. (2007) [27] reported that enzyme concentration had a large effect in the rate of inactivation of AOx from Hansenula sp and from P. pastoris. Their study used protein concentrations of 0.1 mg mL−1 and 0.01 mg mL-1 while in our study the stock solution used to inactivate the L fraction had a concentration between 0.05 mg mL-1 and 0.12 mg mL-1 and the in-situ activity measurements were done with an AOx concentration of ∼1.9 × 10-4 mg mL-1 (3 mU mL−1) including the inactive L fraction that might have contributed to the crowding effect. Arrhenius plots are in Fig S2 of supplementary materials. In the absence of experimental data on protein structural changes with pressure and temperature, it is not possible to explain the difference in behavior between the L and the R fractions of AOx. However, the differences in stability and activity suggest that they are structurally different. In fact, the mechanisms of enzyme stabilization and activation at HHP remain unclear. For example, a study on high-pressure crystallography of the L99A T4 lysozyme mutant reported that its large cavity is indifferent to high pressure but produced the rearrangement of subdomains. The largest change was the bending of the C-helix towards the cavity [28]. In contrast, a recent NMR study indicates that the size of unfilled hydrophobic cavities had a destabilizing effect on the same lysozyme mutant as the volume of the cavity actually decreased when a surface aromatic group flipped [29]. Similarly, high-pressure NMR has revealed that the main effect of pressure on a staphylococcal nuclease is the collapse of cavities [30]. In contrast, at moderate pressures, the compressed cavities resulted in an increase in the Van der Waals forces which stabilizes the proteins [31]. Pressure and temperature are reported to have an antagonistic effect on the enzymes which can be described with elliptical shaped contour plots where the native state of enzymes is retained at high temperatures and moderately high pressures [9,32,33]. High pressures, typically below 300 MPa, counteract the unfolding of proteins caused by high temperatures through 1) strengthening the hydration of charge and non-polar groups to prevent the water loss [34], 2) strengthening the hydrogen bonds to maintain the intermolecular oxygen-hydrogen interactions [35], and 3) strengthening the ion pairs [10]. The crystalline structure of AOx2, which we presume corresponds to the R fraction in our study, has not been experimentally determined but the enzyme was reported to have over 90 % homology with AOx1 [3]. Koutz et al. (1989) reported a 97 % homology in the predicted sequence of amino acids [36]. However, the differences in thermostability and thermophilicity of the two fractions are not surprising since such differences have also been reported for example for variants with single-site mutations of aminoglycoside o-nucleotidyltransferase(4′) [37]. Visualization of a model (F2R038) for AOx2 available from SWISS-MODEL was done. Although the location and size of some of the cavities calculated using DeepView (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) coincide with the cavities of AOx1 (F2Qy27), AOx2 shows additional and larger cavities. This appears to contradict the observations for lysozyme. However, in the absence of empirical data it is not possible to ascertain the role of cavities in the differences in activity and stability of AOx isozymes. One can hypothesize that there are temperature-pressure thresholds beyond which the presence of these larger cavities result in an increased rate of denaturation. From transition-state theory, the overall effect of HHP on the reaction rate can be described using the Eyring’s equation (Eq. 6). When the reaction rate is increased by HHP, the energy barrier for the reaction is lowered and the activation volume is negative [21]. We and other groups have reported the effect of HHP on the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions. Examples of the negative activation volumes with increased enzyme activities by HHP include GOX [17] α-chymotrypsin [34,38,39]. and α-l-rhamnosidase and naringinase [40]. The negative activation volume may result from the destruction of the electrostatic interactions when forming the transition state, which strengthens the hydration caused by the interaction of water with charged and polar amino acids exposed by HHP [34,38], In contrast, when the enzymatic reaction is suppressed by HHP, the activation volume is positive [41]. The volume changes induced by HHP can be attributed to the reactants themselves or the result of the interactions between the reactants and the solvents [31]. To assess the dependence of the enzyme activity on pressure, the activation volumes were calculated. However, for the R fraction, the activation volumes were statistically null. The changes in enzyme activity is reported to be related to the conformation changes of proteins at high pressures [42]. For example, the molecular dynamics simulation of lipase activated at high pressure (> 100 MPa) revealed that the channel access to the active site was opened through a conformation change induced by HHP [43]. To better understand the possibly different protein conformation changes enzymes at HHP, the protein structure is needed to be studied by high-pressure NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography now possible [44]. However, these studies are well beyond the scope of this study and not amenable yet to large proteins like AOx."
