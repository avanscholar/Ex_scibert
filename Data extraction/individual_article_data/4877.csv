0,Introduction,"As a significant steroid intermediate with high additional value, androstenedione (AD, C19H26O2, molar mass: 286.41gmol−1, CAS Registry 63-05-8, Fig. 1 ) is used for the production of various steroid derivatives, such as testosterone, progesterone, and prednisolone [1]. In addition, AD possesses many essential androgen properties, such as binding of the androgen receptor to the ligand-binding domain, induction of its nuclear translocation and promotion of myogenic differentiation; AD has also been the starting material for androgen and anabolic drug preparations for quite some time [2,3]. AD is produced by microbial side-chain cleavage of phytosterol or multistep chemical synthesis [4]. Afterward, AD goes through several concentration and purification processes with alcohols. Solution crystallization is a key step for industrial purification process, which controls product quality attributes, such as purity, yield, and crystal size distribution. To select the proper solvent and to design an optimized crystallization process, systematically determining complete physicochemical data such as solubility and dissolving enthalpy in different alcohols are important. Moreover, the solubility of solid compounds in solvents is one of the most important process parameters that is of scientific interest for the development of the solution theory [5]. Solubility temperature dependence enables the conduct of a thermodynamic analysis that permits insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the solution processes [6,7]. Another way to obtain such insights is to calculate the solvation of the solute by the solvents based on the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), which is a well-established solvation model that can yield important information on molecular solute–solvent interactions [8]. The accuracy of this prediction method can be validated by a comparison of the predicted and experimental solubilities. However, no literature regarding AD solubility in lower alcohols has been reported. In addition, lack of the physicochemical information about AD solubility exists, and knowledge on the solution and mixing behavior between AD and lower alcohols is of great practical relevance for potential use in future chemical processes. In this study, AD solubility measurement in different lower alcohols from 277.65K to 319.45K was performed with medium-throughput experiments. The experimental data are correlated by six thermodynamic models. The thermodynamic functions (i.e., Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of solution and mixture) are calculated using the van’t Hoff, Gibbs, and NRTL equations. Solubility predictions of AD in different alcohols are performed using the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) as a thermodynamic model. Further molecular interaction energies between AD and alcohols are calculated by COSMO-RS to investigate the effects of temperature and solvent polarity on AD solubility."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials AD, supplied by Shandong Dongyao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China, was prepared by recrystallization from ethanol three times. Its mass fraction purity was better than 99.0%, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies, USA). Methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and 1-butanol used in the experiments were of analytical reagent (AR) grade (purchased from Tianjin Kewei Chemical Co., China) with a mass fraction purity of higher than 99.5% without further purification. The details of the materials used in this work were listed in Tables 1 and 2 ."
3,Melting properties measurements.,"2.2 Melting properties measurements. The melting temperature T m 1 and enthalpy of fusion Δ fus H 1 of AD were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC 1/500, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) under protection of nitrogen atmosphere. The size of samples were 5–10mg, and the heating rate was 2K/min. Uncertainties of the measurements were ±0.3K for the temperature and no more than 3% for the enthalpy of fusion."
4,X-ray diffraction analysis,"2.3 X-ray diffraction analysis Powder XRD pattern (Fig. 2 ) of AD sample was used to identify its crystallinity, and the samples did not show any polymorphism throughout the experiments. The patterns were obtained by using Cu Kα (1.54) radiation on a D/MAX 2500 X-ray diffractometer. Crystal samples were gently ground and analyzed over a diffraction-angle (2θ) range of 2–50°, at a step size of 0.02°, a dwell time of 1s, a voltage of 40kV, and a current of 100mA."
5,Solubility determinations,"2.4 Solubility determinations The measurement of AD solubility in different alcohols was performed as a function of temperature by a dynamic method, using a medium-throughput multiple reactor (Crystalline, Avantium, Amsterdam) with the similar method as the Crystal16 [10,11]. However, Crystalline has more accuracy and precision in the determination of mole fraction solubility, especially in determining the solubility of the scarcely soluble substances, for which much more solute could be added. The setup consists of 8 wells designed to hold 8 glass vials (5.0mL) and records the variations on the transmissions of light through the solution in the vials. Slurries of AD with different concentrations were prepared by adding the predetermined amounts of crystalline material and approximately 3mL of solvent in the vials, which were then placed in the setup at a stirring speed of 1200rpm. The heating and cooling rates employed were 0.05K/min and 0.5K/min, respectively. Upon heating a vial in the setup, the light transmission through the sample reaches its maximum value at a certain temperature (clear point). The clear point was the temperature at which the suspension becomes a clear liquid, and it was taken as the saturation temperature of the sample. To have a better determination of the solubility, the saturation temperature was measured at least 4 times per sample by cycles of cooling and reheating, and the average values were utilized. In all cases, the chemical stability of AD in the studied solvent was verified at the measurement temperature, and no degradation was found throughout the experiments. The variation of system temperature for all the measurements was estimated to be within ±0.05K. Concentrations were determined by using a balance (type AB204, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) with ±0.0001g accuracy. The estimated uncertainty of the experimental solubility values was less than 2%. The mole fraction solubility (x 1) of AD in the solvent could be adopted by Eq. (1): (1) x 1 = m 1 / M 1 m 1 / M 1 + m 2 / M 2 where m 1 and m 2 separately represent the mass of AD (1) and alcohol (2=methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or 1-butanol), while M 1 and M 2 are the respective molecular weights. To validate the accuracy of solubility data measured by the Crystalline multiple reactor set up, the solubility of piracetam (Form III) in ethanol was measured at the temperature range from 278K to 323K and compared with literature values [12]. As presented in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , the solubilities obtained in this work are in good agreement with literature ones, and the average relative deviation of the experimental results from those in literature was lower than 2%. The relative deviations of solubility data were 0.3%, 1.3%, 2.5%, 2.0%, 2.4%, 2.5%, 0.9%, 1.1%, 0.07%, and 1.5% at increments of 5K, over the range of (278–323)K, respectively. So it has been proven that solubility data measured by this technique are repeatable and credible."
6,The COSMO-RS computational method,"2.5 The COSMO-RS computational method COSMO-RS is a novel and fast methodology for predicting thermodynamic equilibria of fluids and liquid mixture based on unimolecular quantum chemical calculations. The theory of COSMO-RS has been described by Klamt and Eckert [13], only a short introduction of the basic features are presented to understand this article. COSMO-RS is a two-step procedure. In the first step, quantum chemical calculations have to be performed for all molecules of interest. In these calculations, the continuum solvation model COSMO is applied to simulate a virtual conductor environment for the molecule. A screening charge density σ on the nearby conductor is ultimately induced and obtained through the standard quantum chemical computation (usually DFT method) [8]. In the second step of COSMO-RS, the statistical thermodynamics of the molecular interactions, the screening charge density is used for the quantification of the interaction energy of pair-wise interacting surface segments with regard to the most important molecular interaction modes, i.e. electrostatics and hydrogen bonding [13]. The less specific van der Waals (vdW) interactions or dispersive interactions are taken into account in a more approximate way by element specific dispersion coefficients. Then, the chemical potential of a surface segment with SCD (screening charge density) σ in an ensemble can be described by the normalized distribution function p S ( σ ′ ) given by Eq. (2) (2) μ S ( σ ) = − R T ln ∫ p S ( σ ′ ) exp 1 R T ( μ S ( σ ′ ) − E MF ( σ , σ ′ ) − E HB ( σ , σ ′ ) − E vdW ( σ , σ ′ ) ) where μ S ( σ ) the so-called σ-potential, is the chemical potential of an average molecular contact area of size a eff in the ensemble S at temperature T; E MF, E HB and E vdw represents the electrostatic contact interaction energy, hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction energy and vdW interaction energy, respectively. The chemical potential of a compound is available from the integration of the σ-potential over the surface of the molecule. The capability of COSMO-RS to calculate the chemical potential μ S X of an arbitrary solute X in any pure or mixed solvent S at variable temperature enables the prediction of thermodynamic properties such as the solubility. In this work, all solubility predictions were performed using COSMOthermX_3.0 program (COSMOlogic GmbH & Co KG, Leverkusen, Germany). The COSMO input files for alcohols were taken from the COSMO database. The input files of AD not stored in this database were obtained from quantum chemical calculations performed on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level using the DMOL3 module within Materials Studio (v 6.0) package (Accelrys), utilizing the functional of PBE and basis set of DNP [14]. To ensure an efficient computation, all the stable conformations were considered and weighted according to the Boltzmann distribution function, and all the calculated solubility data were obtained using the iterative algorithm. But for a better comparison of AD solubilities in different alcohols under the same conditions, a non-iterative mode was utilized."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physical properties of pure materials,"3.1 Physical properties of pure materials As shown in Fig. 4 , the melting temperature T m 1 and the enthalpy of fusion Δ fus H 1 of AD were determined to be 444.54K and 25.70kJ/mol, respectively, using differential scanning calorimetry. The entropy of fusion Δ fus S 1 of AD was calculated by (3) Δ fus S 1 = Δ fus H 1 T m 1 and Δ fus S 1 was 57.81J/(molK). The AD liquid mole volume was determined by measuring AD density, that is, 1.11g/cm3, with a pycnometer method [15]. The solvent mole volumes were obtained from the literature data [9]. All of the physical properties of these pure materials were listed in Table 4 ."
9,Solubility data and correlation,"3.2 Solubility data and correlation Experimentally measured temperature-dependent AD mole fraction solubility data (x 1) in lower alcohols are available in Table 5 and plotted in Fig. 5 . AD solubility was found to increase with temperature for each solvent studied. At a given temperature, AD solubility increased along with solvent polarity. Polarity [16,17]: methanol (76.2)>ethanol (65.4)>1-butanol (60.2)>2-propanol (54.6). Solubility: methanol>ethanol>1-butanol>2-propanol. Many thermodynamic approximation methods were employed to describe the dependence of solid compound solubility in monosolvents on temperature. In this study, modified Apelblat equation, λh equation, Margules equation, Wilson model, NRTL model, and UNIQUAC model were tested to correlate the experimental data based on the pure component physical properties. All of these equations were shown in Appendix A. To evaluate the applicability and accuracy of these models used in this paper, mean percentage relative deviation (MPRD) was used to check the correlation results. MPRD is defined as follows: (4) M P R D = 100 N ∑ k = 1 N | x 1 , k exp . − x 1 , k calc. x 1 , k exp . | where N is the number of experimental data points; x 1 , k exp . and x 1 ,k calc. are the experimental and calculated solubilities of solute, respectively. The adjustable parameters of each model were obtained by fitting the experimental solubility data with lsqnonlin function, which is a nonlinear regression method in MATLAB™ software. The optimization procedure was based on MPRD minimization between the calculated and the experimental values of solubility. The optimized parameters and deviations of each model are presented in Table 6 . The overall MPRD of the six models are 1.99% (modified Apelblat), 2.01% ( λ h ), 2.90% (Margules), 1.77% (Wilson), 1.68% (NRTL), and 6.26% (UNIQUAC), respectively. The NRTL model produced the best correlation for the solubility data, with overall MPRD of 1.68% for all the solvents studied. Notably, the optimized value of α 12 in the NRTL equation ranges from 0.0027 to 0.70; this value generally varies between 0.20 and 0.47 for vapor–liquid equilibrium [22]. Ambiguity may sometimes exist in choosing the proper α 12 value [28]. Some previous studies [5,18,28] have reported that better correlation results can be obtained when α 12 is searched within a wider range. The α 12 value represents the non-randomness of the mixture, and the relatively high values for this parameter show that the mixtures are non-ideal solutions. From the optimized α 12 values in different lower alcohols, the non-ideal behaviors of the mixtures were concluded to diminish as the solvent polarities increase. This conclusion is consistent with that observed in the variations of activity coefficient ln γ 1 values (Table 5). These results may be attributed to the variations of the intermolecular interactions, sizes, and shapes in lower alcohols with different chain lengths."
10,Thermodynamic functions of solution,"3.3 Thermodynamic functions of solution Based from the above observations, we concluded that AD solubility is the function of both temperature and solvent polarity. In addition, these solubility data provide the basis for the thermodynamic analysis of the solution process. According to the van’t Hoff analysis, the apparent standard enthalpy change of solution is obtained from Eq. (5) using the mean harmonic temperature ( T hm ) [calculated as: T hm = n / ∑ i = 1 n 1 / T ], where n is the number of temperatures studied [29] (5) ∂ ln x 1 ∂ ( 1 / T − 1 / T hm ) p = − Δ soln H ° R Fig. 6 shows the plots for AD in different alcohols. Linear trends with well determined Δ soln H ° were obtained in all cases studied. Considering the approach proposed by Krug et al. [30], the apparent standard Gibbs energy change in the solution process ( Δ soln G ° ) is calculated at T hm by: (6) Δ soln G ° = − R × T hm × intercept where the intercept used is obtained in plots of ln x 1 as a ( 1 / T − 1 / T hm ) function (Fig. 6). This intercept corresponds to the value of ln x 1 obtained from the respective regression model at T hm , and thus, Eq. (6) is almost coincident with the classical equation Δ soln G ° = − R × T × ln K ° at mean harmonic temperature, where K ° is the equilibrium-constant of non-electrolyte solution. Finally, the standard apparent entropic change for the solution process ( Δ soln S ° ) is obtained from the respective Δ soln H ° and Δ soln G ° values at T hm using the Gibbs equation: (7) Δ soln S ° = Δ soln H ° − Δ soln G ° T hm The relative contributions of enthalpy % ζ H and entropy % ζ T S toward the solution process are calculated by Eqs. (8) and (9) [31] (8) % ζ H = 100 × | Δ soln H ° | | Δ soln H ° | + | T Δ soln S ° | (9) % ζ T S = 100 × | T Δ soln S ° | | Δ soln H ° | + | T Δ soln S ° | The standard thermodynamic functions, the relative contributions of the enthalpy % ζ H , and the entropy % ζ T S for the AD solution process in all pure solvents are summarized in Table 7 . The standard Gibbs energy of the solution was found to be positive in every case, and therefore, the solution process apparently is not spontaneous, which is similar to that reported elsewhere [29,32–34]. This result may be explained by the concentration scale used (mole fraction), where the reference state is the solid pure solute having the unit as concentration of solute, but the mole fraction solubility for most non-electrolyte compound is always lower than the unit and thus, its logarithmic term is negative, and hence, Δ soln G ° obtains a positive quantity. Moreover, in all cases AD solubility apparently increases with decreasing standard Gibbs energy of solution, and [35] reported that a linear correlation exists between Δ soln G ° and ln x 1 . Obviously, these results are consistent with Eq. (6), which indicates that the lower the value of Δ soln G ° , and the larger the solubility of AD. The result is in line with the fact that the low Δ soln G ° values are more favorable for dissolution. The apparent enthalpy and entropy of solution are also positive in all cases. Therefore, the solution process is always endothermic and entropy driven, which explains the increasing AD solubility with increasing temperature. In all cases, the main contributor to the positive standard molar Gibbs energy of AD solution is the positive enthalpy ( % ζ H > 61 .69 ), which indicates energetic predominance on the dissolution processes."
11,Thermodynamic functions of mixing,"3.4 Thermodynamic functions of mixing In order to investigate the contribution of the mixing process toward the overall dissolution, two hypothetical stages were applied to simulate the solution process (Fig. 7 ). The first step, called pure component properties, consists of heating solid solute up to the melting point T m , solute fusion at T m , and cooling the liquid solute to the process temperature T. The second step of solution process, called mixture property, is the description of the mixing of a hypothetical supercooled liquid solute with the solvent at process temperature T. This allows the calculation of the thermodynamic functions of mixture contributions to the overall solution process by NRTL equations, which is the best correlation of the solubility data. For real solutions, the thermodynamic properties of mixing are calculated by (10) Δ M = M E + Δ M id for M = H mix , S mix and G mix where M E and Δ M id represent the excess property and the mixing property in ideal solutions, respectively. In a binary ideal mixture, these mixing properties can be expressed by (11) Δ H id = 0 (12) Δ S id = − R ( x 1 ln x 1 + x 2 ln x 2 ) (13) Δ G id = R T ( x 1 ln x 1 + x 2 ln x 2 ) Based on the NRTL model, the excess Gibbs free energy in the pure solvent can be denoted by (14) G E = R T ( x 1 ln γ 1 + x 2 ln γ 2 ) Other excess functions, such as excess enthalpy and entropy, can be derived from G E : (15) H E = − T 2 ∂ ( G E / T ) ∂ T = − R T 2 x 1 ∂ ln γ 1 ∂ T + x 2 ∂ ln γ 2 ∂ T (16) S E = H E − G E T Using the experimental solubility data and the NRTL model parameters, Δ G mix , Δ H mix and Δ S mix values of AD are calculated. The relative contributions of enthalpy % ζ H and entropy % ζ T S can also be calculated using equations analogous to (8) and (9), respectively. These results are reported in Table 8 . Gibbs energy of mixing Δ G mix is negative and decreases with increasing temperature in all cases; however, solubility increases with increasing temperature. Thus, lower Δ G mix values correspond to higher solubility and more favorable dissolution. The mixing enthalpy Δ H mix and mixing entropy Δ S mix are positive in all systems; therefore, the mixing process is always endothermic and enthalpy driven. The variation in Δ H mix values results from the contribution of several kinds of interactions [29,34]. The enthalpy of cavity formation, which is required for solute accommodation, is endothermic because considerable energy expenditure must be supplied for cavity formation to accommodate the solute and protect against the cohesive forces of the solvent. This process decreases solubility. On the negative side, the enthalpy of solute–solvent interactions is exothermic and is mainly due to Lewis acid–base interactions and van der Waals. The endothermic enthalpy of mixing, which is similar to that exhibited by ibuprofen [32] and naproxen [33] in pure solvents, indicates that solute–solvent interactions are smaller than the unfavorable cavity term. The production of endothermic heat also suggests that mixing at increased temperature is favorable. Thus, this conclusion is consistent with the experimental result that solubility increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the entropy change of mixing was also observed to have an important influence on solubility behavior. On one hand, entropy increases, which results in low degree of order and is beneficial to the mixing process. On the other hand, because of the solvent function, solvent molecules arrange regularly around the solute molecules, which decreases the entropy. Δ S mix values always increase as temperature and solvent polarity increase, which is conducive to mixing, and thus, solubility increases. The effect of solvent polarity on the Δ S mix values is probably because of the different sizes, shapes and charge of alcohol molecules under different chain lengths. Therefore, the influence of both enthalpy and entropy should be considered for solute dissolution."
12,Solvation characteristics: an insight into solubility behavior,"3.5 Solvation characteristics: an insight into solubility behavior To understand the intrinsic solubility behavior in detail, a well-founded solvation model, COSMO-RS, was selected to simulate molecular solute–solvent interactions. Based on this model, the interaction parameters between the molecules were considered and classified in three, namely, misfit energy, HB energy, and vdW energy, which quantify the electrostatic interactions, the hydrogen bonding interactions, and the dispersive or van der Waals interactions, respectively [8,13]. Furthermore, the statistical thermodynamics was used to determine the link between the microscopic surface interaction energies and the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of a liquid [14]. Thus, the statistical averaging of interacting surface pieces in the ensemble can be done to calculate the macroscopic thermodynamic properties, such as chemical potential and solubility. Predicted solubilities of AD in different alcohols were validated by experimental results with a good agreement. Based on the sound physical basis of COSMO-RS, the solubility changes of AD under different temperatures and solvents were quantitatively associated with solvation interactions. The influences of temperature and solvent polarity on AD solubility were studied in this work. 3.5.1 Solubility predictions and validation Solubility predictions of AD were performed in each solvent at different temperature, and plotted in Fig. 8A. The results suggested that AD solubilities in different alcohols mainly depend on temperature and solvent polarity, and solubility increased with increasing temperature and solvent polarity, which is consistent with the experimental results. To examine the accuracy of COSMO-RS predictions of AD solubilities, all of the experimentally determined values were used for evaluation. As shown in Fig. 8B, AD solubilities in different lower alcohols predicted by COSMO-RS are in good agreement with the experimental results despite some reasonable deviations. Moreover, the literature [8,36–38] has already validated COSMO-RS, with reliable and satisfactory quantitative solubility predictions. Therefore, COSMO-RS is a suitable tool for qualitatively ranking AD solubility in methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and 1-butanol. 3.5.2 Multiple molecular interactions Macroscopic thermodynamic properties depend on the microscopic interactions between molecules, so we can attribute macroscopic thermodynamic properties to the most important molecular interaction forces through determination and comparison of different types of interaction energies based on COSMO-RS computation. As presented in Fig. 9 , the three interaction energies (i.e., misfit, HB, and vdW energies) in methanol were observed to be around 18.7, −20.7, and −56.0kJ/mol, respectively. All of them show very small variations as the temperature increases. Similar results have been found in other solvents. These results indicate that temperature has only a small effect on interactions between the molecules, but AD solubility significantly increases with temperature. Therefore, the enthalpy of cavity formation can be concluded to be the determinant for AD solubility in monosolvents at different temperatures. In addition, creating a cavity with an increment in temperature is beneficial, and thus solubility increases, which is in agreement with the Δ H mix discussion presented previously. Furthermore, the HB and vdW energy diminish slightly as the temperature increases in all solvents studied, which suggest that it is unfavorable in initiating dissolution. Thus, mixing entropy Δ S mix increases with temperature, as discussed in Section 3.5. In addition, for a given temperature of 298.15K, among the three interaction energies, vdW energy is around −56.5kJ/mol, with very small variations changing the number of carbon in lower alcohols. However, HB and misfit energy significantly vary from −13.76kJ/mol to −20.62kJ/mol and from 15.47kJ/mol to 18.80kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between AD and alcohols can be concluded to be the determinants for AD solubility in lower alcohols, especially the former. Generally, the stronger the hydrogen bonding and the electrostatic interactions between the AD and the solvent molecule are, the higher the HB and misfit energies gained, and consequently, the higher the AD solubility values. This result explains that solubility increases along with the solvent polarities."
13,Conclusion,"AD solubilities in methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and 1-butanol were measured using a dynamic method at temperatures ranging from 277.65K to 319.45K. AD solubility increases with increasing temperature and solvent polarity, which provides the basic data for AD purification and crystallization. The experimental data are well correlated using the modified Apelblat equation, λh equation, Margules equation, Wilson model, NRTL model, and UNIQUAC model, and the NRTL model provides the best fitting results. Further Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy of solution and mixing are then calculated in different alcohols. The positive enthalpy and entropy of solution indicates that the solution process is always endothermic and entropy driven. Moreover, the endothermic heat of mixing suggests that solute–solvent interactions are smaller than those of the unfavorable cavity actions. Finally, the fundamental mechanisms of temperature and solvent polarity influences on AD solubility are studied and explained from microscopic intermolecular interactions based on COSMO-RS computation. The results confirm that all kinds of interaction energies between AD and alcohol molecules, as a function of temperature, are nearly unchanged, while HB and misfit energy significantly vary with solvent polarity. Therefore, the enthalpy of cavity formation has the dominant influence on AD solubility at different temperatures, whereas hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between AD and alcohol molecules play a key role in solvent polarity effect on AD solubility."
