0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is expected to be cleanest energy source of the future, since its sole product is water, and it does not release CO2 and other harmful gases into the natural environment when it is used for energy production. Recently, great progress has been achieved in the technological development of fuel cells [1] and in the storage and transportation of hydrogen [2]. Now, a breakthrough in technology to produce hydrogen efficiently will be the key landmark to decide if and when hydrogen will be used as one of the most important renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels. Dark- and photo-fermentation of organic compounds are promising methods of producing hydrogen through biological processes [3]. This is not only because of their high efficiency, but also because of their potential to use renewable sources of biomass for hydrogen production. Sucrose is becoming an attractive renewable biomass for energy conversion, and sugarcane and beets are considered important energy crops in many countries [4]. Heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria can convert sucrose directly to hydrogen via fermentative butyrate or acetate metabolism and the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is 2 or 4-mol/mol hexose [5]. Several studies have been undertaken to increase the hydrogen yield from sucrose [4–6] and to obtain the optimal parameters for continuous dark-fermentation using heterotrophic anaerobic microflora [4–7]. Under optimal conditions, the hydrogen yield from sucrose ranged from 1.25 to 2.4-mol/mol hexose for different bacterial species [4–7]. The hydrogen yield from sucrose by dark-fermentation could be difficult to increase above 2.5-mol/mol hexose, owing to the formation of fatty acids during the fermentation process [5]. Also, the by-products of fatty acids, which contribute to the high COD and low pH value in fermentation effluents and bring bad smell to the air, carry a potential threat to the environment [8]. To develop an applicable technology to produce hydrogen from sucrose, further efforts are needed to decompose the fatty acids in the effluent and convert them to hydrogen. Many studies have demonstrated that photo-fermentation by anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen and carbon dioxide with high efficiency [9–11]. Most of these studies were conducted using photosynthetic bacteria independently [10–12]. A few researchers have tried to co-culture photosynthetic bacteria with heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria in the same fermentation cylinder [13]. However, because the two types of bacteria need different environments, it is difficult to set up suitable fermentation conditions that are favorable to both. Several studies combined the two fermentation processes using a two-step method to convert glucose or starch to hydrogen [9,14,15]. Anaerobic bacteria decompose glucose or starch via acetate fermentative metabolism as the first step, and photosynthetic bacteria convert the resultant acetate to hydrogen in another reactor as the second stage. The hydrogen yield is increased twofold in comparison to that using only dark-fermentation [14,15]. Recently, heterotrophic anaerobic microflora, after inactivating hydrogenotrophic methanogens, have been frequently employed in hydrogen production [4,7,16,17] because of their high hydrogen production rate, technical feasibility, and promise of practical application. Fermentation processes using microflora may involve different metabolic pathways; therefore, fatty acid composition in the effluent is expected to be more complex than that using a pure culture. This study analyzed the feasibility and efficiency of phototrophic hydrogen conversion from fatty acids produced by heterotrophic anaerobic microflora. The hydrogen yield of dark-fermentation was evaluated by using microflora with different durations of heat treatment. The effects of the initial pH, the C/N ratio, and sucrose concentration on dark-fermentation hydrogen yield were also examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial inocula for dark- and photo-fermentation,"2.1 Microbial inocula for dark- and photo-fermentation For dark-fermentation, cattle dung and sludge from a biogas reactor pretreated at 112°C for 0, 2, 3, 5, or 7h were used as inocula. R. sphaeroides SH2C, which was isolated from wastewater in our laboratory (unpublished data), was used as the inoculum for photo-fermentation. SH2C cells were pre-cultured aerobically in RCVB medium [18] in a shaker at 200rpm at 30 ± 1 ∘ C ."
3,Hydrogen production in dark-fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen production in dark-fermentation Dark-fermentation was performed in 250 mL serum vials in batch tests. Five grams of pretreated dung or sludge were added to serum vials mixed with 150 mL modified dark-fermentation medium [19], 1L of which contained 1.5 g KH 2 PO 4 ; 4.2 g Na 2 HPO 4 · 12 H 2 O ; 0.18 g MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O ; 2 g yeast extract; 0.1 g FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O ; and a nitrogen source corresponding to 6, 12, 18, and 24 g sucrose at a C/N ratio of 50, or to a C/N ratio of 30, 50, 70, or 100 at a sucrose concentration of 12g/L. The dark-fermentation media were adjusted to pH 6 or other tested pH values. Vials were kept at 38°C in a dark room and sealed with rubber stoppers, into which 60 mL syringes were inserted to collect and measure biogas production. To check whether the compositions in inocula or yeast extract would serve as carbon source for hydrogen production, two series of controls were carried out: Control A, without yeast extract and sucrose; Control B, without sucrose but adding the same amount of yeast extract as used in the dark-fermentation medium. All the batch tests under different conditions were repeated in triplication."
4,Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation,"2.3 Hydrogen production in photo-fermentation To optimize the condition of hydrogen production from acetate and butyrate by R . sphaeroides SH2C, photo-fermentations were tested in modified RCVB medium in which DL-malic acid was replaced by acetate or butyrate at different concentrations. The fermentations with 35 mL media and 1 mL pre-cultured SH2C cells were performed in 38 mL anaerobic tubes at 30°C under the illumination of 4000lux. Dark-fermentation effluent (150mL) in a batch test was centrifuged at 8000rpm (6100g). Chemical analysis was performed on 5 mL samples of supernatant. The remnant supernatant was diluted based on the optimal concentration of butyrate or acetate, and then adjusted to pH 7. Or the remnant supernatant was directly adjusted to pH 7 if the concentration of butyrate or acetate was less than the optimal ones. The adjusted supernatant was separately transferred to different 38 mL anaerobic tubes at a volume of 32mL and then mixed with 3.6mL of 10 × modified RCVB medium (in which malic acid was eliminated) and then autoclaved. Pre-cultured SH2C cells (1mL) were added to each tube and mixed with the effluents. Photo-fermentation was conducted with illumination of 4000lux at 30°C. Tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and 60 mL syringes were used to collect and measure gas production."
5,Chemical analysis,"2.4 Chemical analysis Gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph GC7900 (Techcomp, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. A 5-m stainless column was packed with AE (transformer oil analysis column) with nitrogen as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 20mL/min. The temperature of the injector, column, and detector were kept at 80, 80, and 130°C, respectively. Volatile fatty acids were quantified by gas chromatography (Shimadzu 17A, Japan) using a flame ionization detector and a 30-m FFAP capillary column. The temperature of the injector and detector were 250 and 260°C, while the column was held at 80°C for 2min, heated to 200°C at 5°C/min and maintained at 200°C for 1min. The carrier gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of 70mL/min."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The yield of gas produced in all of the batch fermentations was corrected under normal conditions. The cumulative hydrogen production was calculated according to the biogas yield evolved from 150 mL fermentation medium in each batch test and hydrogen composition in collected gas. Hydrogen yield is measured as the ratio of actual moles of hydrogen produced to the moles of sucrose or fatty acid used (the amount of sucrose or fatty acid added in the medium). All the data shown (including hydrogen yield, concentration of fatty acids and cumulative hydrogen production) are the average results from triplicate experiments."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of different origin heterotrophic anaerobic microflora on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effects of different origin heterotrophic anaerobic microflora on hydrogen production Four microflora inocula originating from cattle dung and biogas reactor sludge were available for hydrogen production after inactivating hydrogenotrophic methanogens by heat-treating for 4.5h. The hydrogen productions from sucrose by the four inocula were compared (Fig. 1 ). The microflora from sludge, cattle dung A, cattle dung A and B mixture, and cattle dung B, converted 1.8 g sucrose (12 g sucrose/L in fermentation medium) into 382 ± 20 , 402 ± 30 , 427 ± 25 , and 487 ± 24 mL hydrogen, respectively, and their conversion efficiencies were estimated as 2.87, 3.00, 3.19, and 3.65 mol H 2 / mol sucrose. Pretreated microflora from cattle dung, compost, soil, cereals, and sludge have been used to produce hydrogen from sucrose or other biomass [4,17,20,21], with a reported conversion efficiency of 1.5 to 4.8 mol H 2 / mol sucrose [4,5,7,22]. Our study showed that microflora from cattle dung B was also a high-efficiency hydrogen producer. No sterilization or anaerobic culture condition was required for our dark-fermentation process, thereby simplifying the technique and saving costs. The microflora from cattle dung B was used in the following tests."
9,Effects of heat treatment on hydrogen production by microflora from cattle dung B,"3.2 Effects of heat treatment on hydrogen production by microflora from cattle dung B Heat treatment is a means of inactivating non-spore-forming hydrogen consumers such as methanogens [4,7,20]. The treatment duration may be a key factor in determining microflora composition, and therefore, hydrogen production and fermentation metabolism. Fig. 2 shows that hydrogen production from cattle dung B was greatly affected by heat treatment duration. Microflora from cattle dung B heat-treated for 5h produced much more hydrogen than those heated for 2, 3, or 7h and those that were not heat-treated. As treatment time increased, more hydrogen consumers were inactivated, which increased output of hydrogen (Fig. 2). However, hydrogen production decreased when the heating time was extended to 7h. This may have been because some of the hydrogen-producing microorganisms were also inactivated when treatment time was extended too long. The microflora from cattle dung B heat-treated for 5h were used in further tests. No methane was detected in any of the batch tests, even in the test using the microflora from untreated cattle dung, although its hydrogen production was much lower. This suggests that there may be other hydrogen consumers besides methanogens in these dung samples."
10,Effects of initial pH on hydrogen production of dark-fermentation,"3.3 Effects of initial pH on hydrogen production of dark-fermentation Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of initial pH on hydrogen production. At pH 5, 6, and 7, the maximum hydrogen production rate was 195, 368, and 170 mL H 2 / L h , and the cumulative hydrogen production was 190 ± 31 , 487 ± 35 and 338 ± 35 mL , respectively. The result indicates that hydrogen yield and maximum hydrogen production rates were sensitive to initial pH. Hydrogen concentration of the produced biogas was also found to be affected greatly by initial pH, ranging from 42% at pH 4 to 64% at pH 5.5 [23]. Fang and Liu found changes in initial pH of medium caused the composition variation of microbial communities and thus affected hydrogen production [23]. Initial pH values of 5 to 7 were used in hydrogen fermentation by microflora [4], which are believed to be suitable against methanogens in various fermentation systems. In our hydrogen fermentation system, the highest hydrogen concentration (65%) was observed at initial pH of 6.0."
11,Effects of C/N ratio on hydrogen production of dark-fermentation,"3.4 Effects of C/N ratio on hydrogen production of dark-fermentation The C/N ratio in the fermentation medium is another important factor affecting hydrogen production. When sucrose concentration was fixed at 12g/L, the cumulative hydrogen production at a C/N ratio of 30, 50, 70, or 100 was 381 ± 25 , 493 ± 38 , 480 ± 20 , or 446 ± 40 mL , respectively (Fig. 4 ). Hydrogen production was observed to reach a maximum at a C/N ratio of 50, and drastically decreased at a C/N ratio of 30, but decreased only slightly at ratios of 70 and 100. It may be that a deficiency or excess of carbon has an adverse effect on bacterial growth and hydrogen production. Similar results were found by Lin and Lay [5]. A C/N ratio of 50 in the dark-fermentation medium was used in the following experiment."
12,"Effects of sucrose concentration on the yield and rate of hydrogen production, and composition of fatty acids","3.5 Effects of sucrose concentration on the yield and rate of hydrogen production, and composition of fatty acids The yield and rate of hydrogen production and composition of the formed fatty acids were compared at sucrose concentrations of 6, 12, 18, or 24g/L as well as Control A (no sucrose and yeast extract) and Control B (no sucrose but with yeast extract) under the above optimal fermentation conditions (Fig. 5 , Tables 1 and 2 ). Only 3 and 5mL of hydrogen were produced in Controls A and B, respectively, in which sucrose was eliminated from the fermentation medium. It indicated that the compositions in inocula or yeast extract contribute little to hydrogen production from the dark-fermentation. Cumulative hydrogen production increased directly with sucrose concentration. However, a shorter lag time and higher hydrogen conversion efficiency were observed with lower sucrose concentrations (Fig. 5), with a lag time of 7, 8, 10, and 15h and a hydrogen yield of 3.41, 3.67, 2.57, and 2.32mol H 2 / mol sucrose at sucrose concentrations of 6, 12, 18, and 24g/L, respectively. Chen et al. found that longer lag time also existed at higher sucrose concentrations during fermentative hydrogen production using a pure culture and indicated that sucrose > 25 g / L might inhibit cell growth rate [24]. The distribution of fatty acids formed during fermentation at the four sucrose concentrations (6, 12, 18 and 24g/L) were similar. Among the detected fatty acids, butyrate was the most abundant (75.4–91.9%), followed by acetate (6.3–19.6%). The effluents were also composed of small amounts of propionate, valerate, n-butyl alcohol, and caproate (most < 1 % ). The concentrations of acetate were found to be 12.6 and 14.6mM in Controls A and B, respectively, indicating that 70–100% acetate in effluents of the four sucrose concentration might come from fermentation of carbon sources in inocula and yeast extract, so did propionate in the effluents. On the other hand, butyrate in effluents might come from fermentation of sucrose since a much smaller amount of butyrate ( < 2 mM ) was found in Controls A and B in comparison to that (48–143mM) in effluents from the four sucrose concentrations. Cumulative butyrate production increased directly with sucrose concentration. These results suggest that the microflora used in this experiment and a higher sucrose concentration favor fermentative butyrate metabolism during hydrogen conversion. Similar results have been observed in other studies [24]. The final pH value in fermentation effluent decreased from the initial pH value of 6.0 to a range from pH 4.8 to 3.7 with sucrose concentration increasing, which is inversely corresponded with the increase of resultant total fatty acid in fermentation effluents with the sucrose concentration. Hydrogen conversion efficiency at 12 g/L sucrose was higher than that at other concentrations; however, fermentation at 18 and 24 g/L sucrose produced much more fatty acid (mostly butyrate) than at 12 g/L sucrose, which may produce more hydrogen during further photo-fermentation. To determine which sucrose concentration will give the highest hydrogen yield, it is necessary to consider the total conversion efficiency in the overall combined process of dark- and photo-fermentation."
13,Hydrogen production from dark-fermentation effluents and reduction of fatty acids in photo-fermentation,"3.6 Hydrogen production from dark-fermentation effluents and reduction of fatty acids in photo-fermentation The photosynthetic bacterium, R . sphaeroides SH2C was found to convert acetate and butyrate into hydrogen with relatively high efficiency (Table 3 ). Based on hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate from photo-fermentation at different acetate concentration, 35mM of acetate might be the optimal concentration for hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield is 2.6 mol H 2 / mol acetate, similar to the value of 2.5 mol H 2 / mol acetate converted by a phototrophic microflora [25]. The optimal concentration of butyrate might be 50mM with a hydrogen yield of 6.9 mol H 2 / mol butyrate, which was much higher than 3.7 mol H 2 / mol in Fang et al.'s work [25]. Since butyrate was the most abundant organic acid and acetate concentration was < 35 mM in all the dark-fermentation effluents, the effluents from 18 and 24g/L of sucrose were diluted based on a butyrate concentration of 50mM. The effluents from 6 and 12g/L of sucrose were used directly in photo-fermentation. Cumulative hydrogen production in photo-fermentation was 114 ± 13 , 351 ± 54 , 787 ± 18 and 1017 ± 62 mL from 150mL dark-fermentation effluents at a sucrose concentration of 6, 12, 18, and 24g/L, respectively (Fig. 6 ). No hydrogen was produced from dark-fermentation effluents of Control A or B although there was 12.6- or 14.6 mM acetate in its. Such phenomenon was also found when 10 mM acetate was used as sole carbon source (Table 3). It seemed that the quantity of acetate less than 15mM might mainly contribute to cell growth rather than hydrogen production. If the hypothesis was right, the phototrophic hydrogen production came mainly from butyrate in the fermentation effluents. However, the hydrogen yield of the resultant butyrate in fermentation effluent ( < 4.6 mol H 2 / mol butyrate) was lower than that in modified RCVB media using the same butyrate concentration (6.8 mol H 2 / mol butyrate), and also lower than that in modified RCVB media using a mixture of acetate (20mM) and butyrate (50mM) as carbon source ( > 6.4 mol H 2 / mol butyrate). This may have been caused by some unknown inhibitor in dark-fermentation effluent. Further effort is necessary to improve phototrophic hydrogen yield from dark-fermentation effluent. Until now, many studies have reported a hydrogen yield from sucrose to be less than 4mol H 2 / mol sucrose [4,7,22]. In the present study, by combining dark- and photo-fermentation, total hydrogen production was 342 ± 31 , 841 ± 72 , 1303 ± 43 , and 1637 ± 93 mL in batch tests (150mL) and total hydrogen yield from sucrose was 5.17, 6.38, 6.63, and 6.25 mol H 2 / mol sucrose at a concentration of 6, 12, 18, and 24g/L, respectively (Table 2). The total hydrogen yields achieved in this study are higher than the value of 4.8 mol H 2 / mol sucrose reported by Lin and Lay [5]. Production of hydrogen in dark-fermentation is accompanied by formation of fatty acids. As demonstrated in this and other studies [4,5,7,8,22], dark-fermentation effluent is usually composed of butyrate, acetate, propionate, valerate, and caproate. The presence of these fatty acids in effluent may cause environmental problems [8]. However, after photo-fermentation by SH2C, no butyrate, acetate, propionate, or valerate was detected in the final effluent, in which only caproate was detected at an unchanged concentration. However, because the quantity of caproate in the fermentation effluent is very low, usually < 2 mM , its presence will not cause serious environmental problems."
14,Conclusions,"Using hydrogen yield from sucrose in dark-fermentation as an indicator, the microflora from cattle dung B after heat treatment for 5h is suggested to be a suitable inoculum, and an initial pH value of 6 and a C/N ratio of 50 the optimal fermentation conditions. Using the total hydrogen yield from sucrose in the two-step process combining dark- and photo-fermentation, 18g/L is suggested to be the most suitable sucrose concentration. Employment of photo-fermentation in a two-step process, not only increases the total hydrogen yield from 3.6- to 6.63 mol H 2 / mol sucrose, but also uses up most of the fatty acids in the dark-fermentation effluent except of a small amount of caproate and thus reduces the environmental threat. The above results demonstrate that combining dark- and photo-fermentation is a promising method for converting sucrose into hydrogen. Before the two-step approach turns to be a practical technology for hydrogen production, further efforts are necessary to improve the substrate conversion efficiency (hydrogen yield) in both of dark- and photo-fermentation process. Besides substrate concentration, C/N ratio and initial pH value, more factors which may take effect on hydrogen production need to be taken into consideration for optimizing the fermentation process. For example, quick removal of CO 2 in the headspace of bioreactor could increase hydrogen conversion efficiency from 1.4- to 2.0 mol H 2 / mol glucose [26] in dark-fermentation. The design of effective bioreactor for hydrogen production especially for photo-fermentation is also the key point to improve hydrogen yield. It is also necessary to compare its advantage and limitation to another approach which was recently reported to increase the substrate conversion efficiency by generating hydrogen from acetate in microbial fuel cell [27]."
