0,Introduction,"N-Methyl tertiary amines represent a class of important nitrogen-containing compounds that present as key scaffolds in many tropane alkaloids, such as Morphine (A), Codeine (B), Thebaine (C) and Noscapine (D) [1], and display a wide spectrum of biologically activity [2]. For example, they are used as leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor (SC-57461A) (E) [2a], R2-antagonist/5-HT uptake inhibitor (F) [2b], mutant superoxide dismutase 1 inhibitor (G) [2c] and σ1 and/or σ2 receptors (H) [2d] (Scheme 1 ). Such compounds were traditionally synthesized by the N-methylation of corresponding secondary amines with dimethyl sulphate, methyl iodide or diazomethane as methylating agents in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of base [3]. However, these procedures suffer from the use of hazardous or highly toxic methylating reagents, low selectivity and the formation of a large amount of unavoidable waste. Moreover, most secondary amines are not commercialized and were generally synthesized by the condensation between amines and aldehydes followed by the reduction of the resulting imines using metal hydrides such as NaBH4, NaBH3CN, NaBH(OAc)3 or LiAlH4 [4], or by transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation or hydrosilylations [5]. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to the N-methylation of amines with methanol as a methylating agent based on hydrogen autotransfer process or hydrogen-borrowing strategy [6], using Ir [7], Ru [8], Co [9], Fe [10], Mn [11], Re [12] and Pd complexes [13]. This strategy is highly attractive due to the use of renewable and abundant C1 source [14] and high atom efficiency. However, these systems usually require high temperature, long reaction time, strong base (KOtBu, LiOtBu, NaOH, etc) due to a relatively high energy for the dehydrogenation of methanol compared with long-chain alcohols, such as ethanol (ΔH = +84 vs + 68 kJ mol−1, respectively) [15]. Recently, Fujita and co-workers synthesized a series of Cp*Ir complexes bearing an α-hydroxybipyridine or a bipyridonate ligand, exhibiting highly catalytic activity for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols and N-heterocycles [16], and hydrogen production from an alcohol-water solution under basic conditions [17] based on the concept of ligand-promoted dehydrogenation. We have demonstrated that such complexes are highly effective metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen autotransfer process [18] and acceptorless dehydrogenative cyclization [19]. Meanwhile, we designed and synthesized a Cp*Ir complex bearing a functional 2,2′-bibenzimidazole ligand that contains protic hydrogens and a tautomerism structure like α-hydroxypyridine, exhibiting the unique catalytic activity for the N-methylation of amines with methanol in the presence of Cs2CO3 [20]. Inspired by these promising results and as a continuing effort in this field [18–21], we herein wish to describe the design and synthesis of a Cp*Ir complex bearing a flexible bridging and functional 2,2′-methylenebibenzimidazole ligand [Cp*Ir(2,2′-CH2BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] (Scheme 2 ). Deffer from rigid 2,2′-bibenzimidazole, the ligand bearing a flexible bridge could bend and rotate freely to adopt the coordination geometries of metal centers, and it may be helpful to improve catalytic activity. Furthermore, this complex is found be a general and efficient autotandem catalyst for the synthesis of N-methyl tertiary amines from imines via transfer hydrogenation/N-methylation with methanol."
1,Result and discussion,"The synthetic route for the designed Cp*Ir complex [Cp*Ir(2,2′-CH2BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] was also shown in Scheme 3 . The reaction of [Cp*IrCl2]2 with 2,2′-methylenebibenzimidazole (2.2 equiv) was carried out in a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (v/v = 1/1) at 90 °C for 12 h and was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The yellow solid is stable to air and moisture, and its crystal structure was confirmed by a X-ray crystallography with pertinent bond lengths and angles (Fig. 1 ). 2,2′-Methylenebibenzimidazole ligand is bonded to iridium center with two nitrogen atoms with a bond angle of 82.60(8) in a chelating fashion. Bond lengths of Ir-N1 and Ir-N3 are 2.044 (2) Å and 2.121 (2) Å, respectively. With the synthesized [Cp*Ir(2,2′-CH2BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] (cat. 1) in hand, we investigated its ability as an auto-tandem catalyst for the synthesis of N-methyl tertiary amine from imine via transfer hydrogenation/N-methylation with methanol (Table 1 ). In the presence of cat. 1 (1 mol %) and Cs2CO3 (0.3 equiv), the reaction of (E)-N-benzylidene(phenyl)methanamine (1a) with methanol (2a) proceeded at 125 °C for 12 h to give the desired product 4aa in > 95% yield (Table 1, entry 1). When its analog [Cp*Ir(CH2BiBzImMe2)Cl][Cl] (cat. 2) was used as an alternative catalyst, the product 4aa was obtained in only 20% yield (Table 1, entry 2). Obviously, the NH units in the ligand are crucially important for the activity of iridium catalyst. In the case of other metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts, such as [Cp*Ir(2,2′-BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] (cat. 3), [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 4) and [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OH)2bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 5), the product 4aa was obtained in 80–88% yields (Table 1, entries 3–5). Using other Cp*Ir complexes (cat. 6–12) as a catalyst, reactions afforded the product 4aa ≤ 25% yields (Table 1, entries 6–12). Furthermore, cat. 1 was chosen as a catalyst for further research. Attempt to use Na2CO3 or K2CO3 as an alternative base, to reduce the amount of Cs2CO3, and to decrease reaction temperature resulted in relatively low yields (Table 1, entries 13–16). We evaluated the scope of reaction with a range of imines under established conditions (Table 1, entry 1) and these results are presented in Table 2 . Transformations of N-benzylidenebenzylamine bearing one or two electron-rich substituents, such as methoxy, dimethoxy, methyl and tert-butyl groups, gave corresponding products 4ba-4ga in 80–85% yields. Similarly, halogenated N-benzylidenebenzylamine proceeded smoothly to afford desired products 4ha-4oa in 79–85% yields. Furthermore, substrates bearing a severely electron-deficient substituent, such as trifluoromethoxy and trifluoromethyl groups, were also proven to be suitable and reactions gave corresponding products 4pa and 4qa in 79% and 83% yields, respectively. Readily reducible substituents, such as ester and cyano groups, could also well tolerated, and desired products 4ra and 4sa were isolated in 81% and 80% yields, respectively. When imines derived from 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-thenaldehyde were utilized, corresponding products 4ta and 4ua were obtained in high yields. The catalytic system is also compatible with imines derived from 1-phenylethanamine, 1-butanamine and cyclohexanamine, affording N-methylated products 4va-4xa in 77–84% yields. Interestingly, cyclic imines, such as 6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline and 1-phenyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline, could be converted to desired products 4ya and 4za in 88% and 90% yields, respectively. When imines bearing two aliphatic subsitutents, such as (E)-N-butylidene-2-methylpropan-2-amine and (E)-N-(cyclohexylmethylene)-2-methylpropan-2-amine were utilized, reactions afforded unrecognizable mixtures due to that starting materials are very unstable under reaction conditions. Based on experimental results, a plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the present auto-tandem catalysis (Scheme 4 ). The reaction includes two cycles, e.g. transfer hydrogenation (cycle I)[22] and hydrogen autotrasfer process (cycle II). The initial step of reaction involves the formation of an unsaturated species A by the reaction cat. 1 with Cs2CO3. In cycle I, the ligand of species A accepts a proton from methanol to give methoxy iridium species B, which undergoes β-hydrogen elimination to afford iridium hydride species C and formaldehyde [23]. Ligand-promoted simultaneous hydrogen transfer from the proton on the 2,2′-methylenebibenzimidazole ligand and the hydride on the iridium of species C to CN bond of imines results in the liberation of secondary amines and the regeneration of catalytic species A. In cycle II, the condensation between formaldehyde from dehydrogenation of methanol and resulting secondary amines in cycle I affords iminium ions. Accompanied by the simultaneous hydrogen transfer from the proton on the 2,2′-methylenebibenzimidazole ligand and the hydride on the iridium of species C to N+=CH2 bond of resulting iminium ions, N-methyl tertiary amines are released as desired products and catalytic species A is regenerated. A similar mechanism for the simultaneous delivery of hydride and proton to ketones or imines was proposed for metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts, such as Shvo’s catalyst and Noyori-Ikariya catalysts [24]. Dub and Gordon have recently proposed a revised mechanism on the basis of DFT computations and experimental observations [25]. To gain further the information about reaction mechanism, the kinetic study was undertaken. Under standard reaction conditions, two parallel N-methylations of 1a with CH3OH and CD3OD proceeded and a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) (K H/K D = 3.11) was found (Scheme 5 , Eq. (1)). In addition, a peak (δ −11.57) was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction of cat. 1 with methanol (0.2 mL) in DMSO‑d 6 (1 mL) at 100 °C for 1 h (Scheme 5, Eq. (2)). It was speculated to be a characteristic signal of [Ir-H] (species C). These experimental results supported the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 4. As shown in Scheme 6 , the gram-scale synthesis of a biologically active molecular butenafine (an antimycotic agent) was conducted to demonstrate the practical potential of this methodology. Under standard conditions (Table 1, entry 1), the reaction of 6 (20 mmol) with 2a (10 mL) was carried out for 12 h to afford the desired product 7 in 80% yield. Furthermore, the present auto-tandem catalysis was also expanded to other alcohols (Table 3 ). Reactions of 1a with ethanol, 1-butanoland 1-hexanol afforded corresponding products 4ab-4ad in 83–85% yields. Similarly, benzyl alcohol and it derivates bearing an electron-rich or electron-deficient substituent were converted to desired products 4ae-4ag in 80–89% yields."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a Cp*Ir complex bearing a flexible bridging and functional 2,2′-methylenebibenzimidazole ligand, and developed it as a general and efficient auto-tandem catalyst for the synthesis of N-methyl tertiary amines from imines via transfer hydrogenation/N-methylation with methanol as both hydrogen source and methylating reagent. The reaction is highly attractive due to highly atom economy, and minimal consumption of chemicals and energy. Notably, this research exhibits new potential of metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts for the activation of methanol as C1 source for organic synthesis."
