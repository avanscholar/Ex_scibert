0,Introduction,"As a water-soluble polymer, polyvinyl alcohol membrane is widely used in biomedical, packaging because of its outstanding biocompatibility and biodegradability, good mechanical properties and excellent barrier property to oil. However, PVA is flammable with a relatively low Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) (only 20%). For the membrane products with small thickness, their flammability is much higher than those three dimensional products with thicker wall. Therefore, flame retardancy for PVA membranes is correspondingly more difficult. At present, adding flame retardants into PVA solution system to prepare its flame retardant membrane through flow casting is a conventional method. A variety of flame retardants such as phosphorus compounds [1–6], layered inorganics [7–15] and hydroxides [16–21] are reported to be applied in PVA membranes. Although some of these flame retardants can achieve ideal flame retardant effect by single component or multi component synergy, it is difficult for most flame retardant fillers to be uniformly dispersed in the membrane due to the inncompatibility with PVA solution that lead to agglomeration or precipitation behavior, especially inorganic fillers with high added amount (15 wt%~30 wt%). Poor dispersion will not only decreases the flame retardant efficiency and mechanical property, but also further reduces the transparence of PVA membranes. High transparency performance is crucial for wider applications of PVA membranes. However, maintaining good transparency is difficult for flame retardant membranes. Generally, there are two methods to enhance the transparency of the membranes. For physical addition mode, it should decease the size of the added flame retardant particle to nano scale, and moreover achieve even dispersion in the polymer membrane [6,19,22]. Reactively grafting flame retardant molecules on polymer chains is another method to improve the transparence of the membrane [23]. In fact, both the above methods are incontrollable, complicated and costly. Up to now, it is still a challenge to manufacture PVA membranes both with good flame retardancy and high transparency by a simple and economic technology. In this research, a preparation method of flame-retarding and transparent PVA membranes is established based on hydrogen bonding complexation. Guanidine phosphate is a P–N compound proved to be efficient for flame retardant macromolecules with polyhydroxy such as cotton, wood, and natural fibers [24,25]. Theoretically, GP should be effective on PVA. Additionally, both PVA and GP are water-soluble, which can realize the homogeneous blending of flame retardant/polymer in a water solution. In this way, the polar groups of GP molecule including NH and PO, can interact with the hydroxyl groups of PVA chains to form a great number of the hydrogen bonds during evaporation of water. Therefore, the molecular-scale dispersion and hydrogen bonding combination between them can be achieved. Such hydrogen bond complexation compounding method is different from conventional physical blending (no or very weak intermolecular combination between flame retardant and polymer), and also from chemical modification (covalent bonds combination between them) [26,27]. It provides a convenient and low-cost method to prepare flame retardance of PVA membrane with high transparence."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA, with a polymerization degree of 1700 and an alcoholysis degree of 99%, is supplied by Sichuan Vinylon Corporation Co. China. GP (PubChem CID: 6452957) is purchased by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Company (Shanghai, China). Al(OH)3 powder purchased from Tianjin Bodi Chemical Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of the flame retardant PVA membranes,"2.2 Preparation of the flame retardant PVA membranes The membranes are prepared by solution casting method and their preparation process is shown in Scheme 1. A calculated amount of PVA and GP are dissolved in deionized water at 90 °C with a stir. Then the GP/PVA solution is cast onto a glass dish, dried naturally for 12h. Finally, the GP/PVA membrane is dried at 60 °C for 6 h in a oven to remove the residual moisture. The thickness of the flame retardant PVA membrane is controlled at 0.15 mm. According to the weight percentage of GP, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, the flame retardant PVA membranes are named PVA-GP-5, PVA-GP-10, PVA-GP-15 and PVA-GP-20, respectively. As a contrast sample through conventional physical blending, 15 wt% Al(OH)3/PVA membrane is also prepared according to the above process."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The limit oxygen index (LOI) of the flame retardant membranes is measured with a Dynisco LOI instrument according to ASTM D2863-00. The size of the test samples is 140 × 52 × 0.15 mm. The vertical combustion tests (UL94) are measured using a vertical flame tester (Zhuhai HuaKe Testing Equipment Co. Ltd) according to the ASTM D4804-14 standard. The sample dimensions is 200 × 50 × 0.15 mm. The dispersion state and compatibility of the flame retardant in PVA membrane is observed and evaluated by a polarizing microscope (Linkam scientific instruments, Itd CSS450, English). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are performed to analyze the compositions of membranes and residual carbon on a Nicolet 20SXB Infrared spectrometer. Charring samples are taken from the residual carbon which are treated at 550 °C for 5 min in muffle furnace. The tensile property test is carried out by universal material testing machine (Instron 5567) in accordance with ASTM D368-14. The speed of testing is 25 mm/min. There are five parallel samples for each material, and the average value of the test results is taken. The thermal stability is analyzed on a TGA Q-50 (TA Instruments Co. Ltd, New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate 10 °C/min from room temperature to 700 °C under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The mass of samples is about 6~8 mg. The micro-scale combustion calorimeter (MCC) (Fire Testing Technology Ltd, UK) is employed to research combustion behavior by heating 5 mg of sample at a heating rate of 1 °C/s from indoor temperature to 750 °C according to ASTM D7309-2007. The surface morphology of charring layer is characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-5900LV, JEOLLtd, Tokyo, Japan) with a conductive gold coating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) (INCA, Oxford Instrument) is carried out to analyze the surface elemental compositions. The samples are taken from the membranes which are treated at 550 °C for 5 min in muffle furnace."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The characterization of hydrogen bond complexation and transparency of GP/PVA membranes,"3.1 The characterization of hydrogen bond complexation and transparency of GP/PVA membranes In general, the characterization for intermolecular action is difficult. As the result of no formation of new chemical bonds, no new absorption peaks appear in the FT-IR spectra of GP/PVA membranes compared with pure PVA and GP (Fig. 1 ). Yet, the evidence reflecting the interaction can be found through the shift of the wavenumbers of the characteristic peaks [28,29]. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding generates between GP and PVA due to the presence of amino and hydroxyl groups, which results in obvious red shift (from 3340 to 3241 cm−1) of the stretching vibration absorption peak of the hydroxyl group (υO-H). The increased red shift indicate more intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the increasing content of GP. But with higher GP content, red shift degree is reduced (the wavenumber shift is only 4 cm−1 from 15% GP to 20% GP), which can be explained as the saturability of the formed hydrogen bonds. When almost all the hydroxyl groups of PVA form inter or intra molecular hydrogen bonds, the number of the hydrogen bonds is no more increased even further increasing GP content. Accordingly, the red shift degree is slowed down. The possible hydrogen bonds between PVA and GP are marked by red dashed line in Scheme 1 . Through microscope observation, the dispersion and combination of the flame retardant in PVA matrix can be evaluated. In order to testify the contribution of hydrogen bond complexation to homogenous dispersion, here we used Al(OH)3 flame retardant PVA membrane as a contrast sample. It can be seen that from Fig. 2 (PVA-GP-15) and (PVA- Al(OH)3-15), there is obvious difference in micro dispersion state and the transparence for the two membranes with the same flame retardant content. Al(OH)3 is insoluble in water and the flame retardant particles are dispersed as their original form in PVA membrane, therefore, the opaque dispersion phase size is big enough to block light, the obtained PVA membrane becomes non-transparent. By contrast, the soluble GP can homogenously mix with PVA chains in molecular scale in solution. During removal of water through casting method, GP and PVA can form hydrogen bonds as mentioned above, thus keeping such molecular scale dispersion and combination. Without dispersion phase of big size, the membrane can maintain high light transmission. As we can see, GP flame retardant PVA membranes show similar transparence compared with pure PVA membrane at a relatively low GP content. With further increasing content of GP, excessive GP molecules can't be combined with PVA due to the saturability of the hydrogen bonds. They crystallize during evaporation of the water. GP crystals in PVA membrane (PVA-GP-20) can be clearly seen through the polar microscope. As the formed big crystals in the membrane block the light, the transparence is obviously decreased. According to the above experiments, it demonstrates that an appropriate GP content is important to keep the transparence of PVA membrane."
7,Mechanical property,"3.2 Mechanical property The tensile properties are tested to investigate the effect of GP on the mechanical performances of PVA membranes, with detailed results shown in Fig. 3 . Overall, when the GP content is not more than 15 wt%, the tensile strength, yield strength and elastic modulus of PVA membranes are improved without compromising the ductility. In comparison, adding 20 wt% GP leads to different degrees of reduction in the tensile strength, elastic modulus and ductility. Specific analysis, the PVA matrix displays a tensile strength of 49 MPa, a high breaking elongation of 200%, a yield strength of 36 MPa and an elastic modulus of 2.1 GPa. When the loading level of GP is 5 wt%, the yield strength and elastic modulus reach their maximum values, which is 57 MPa (by 58%) and 3.4 GPa (by 62%), respectively. The maximum tensile strength and elongation at break belong to PVA-GP-10, which increase by 51% (74 MPa) and 90% (380%) respectively. Furthermore, adding 15 wt% GP enhances the tensile strength, breaking elongation, yield strength and elastic modulus up to 72 MPa (by 47%),361%(by 81%), 36 MPa (by 28%) and 2.7 GPa (by 29%), respectively. This indicates that GP has a strong enhancement effect on PVA membrane. The enhancement mechanism can be attributed to the good compatibility and the multiple hydrogen bond interactions between GP and PVA, which form the GP-centric hydrogen bond cross-linking (Scheme 1) to enhance the density of the dynamic physical cross-linking network between PVA molecular chains. When the content of GP is too high, such as 20 wt%, the crystallization and precipitation of GP increases the defect of the material that bring about the deterioration of the mechanical properties."
8,Flame retardancy,"3.3 Flame retardancy Vertical combustion and LOI tests are commonly used methods for evaluating the combustion properties of polymer materials. The two test results of the PVA membranes are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4 . Pure PVA membrane shows intense combustion and serious dripping once ignited (no rating), and its LOI is only 20.2%. For GP flame retardant PVA membranes, the flame retardance is improved with increasing content of GP. With 15 wt% loading level, the flame membrane sample immediately self-extinguishes after two ignitions (VTM-0 rating). Also, Its LOI is as high as 31.2%. The result is exciting because this GP content can endow PVA membrane with desired flame retardance, and meanwhile still keep satisfactory transparence according to the above experimental results. In addition, it is found that the LOI value of PVA-GP-20 shows only a little increase than that of PVA-GP-15. As mentioned above, substantive crystals have been separated from PVA matrix in such excessive GP content due to the saturated hydrogen bonds. It reflects that the GP crystals dispersed in PVA membranes has less contribution to improvement of the flame retardance because of their much bigger dispersion phase size compared with molecular-scale complexation dispersion. Based on the results, PVA-GP-15 formulation is optimum to obtain satisfactory flame retarding and transparent PVA membrane. Additionally, MCC is also used to further evaluate the flammability of GP flame PVA membranes. The related results are shown in Fig. 5 . Firstly, with the increase of GP content, heat release rate (HRR) decreases significantly. When the GP content is 15 wt%, its PHRR falls from 872 W/g of pure PVA to 236 W/g, THR debased from 33 kJ/g of pure PVA to 24 kJ/g, and the decreases reached 73% and 27% respectively, reflecting that GP has a high flame retardant effect on PVA. Secondly, all PVA membranes mainly undergo heat release in two stages, but the first HRR peak of PVA-GP membranes are greatly decreased and shifted to high temperature region than that of pure PVA. In addition, the PHRR of pure PVA appears in the first heat release stage, while PVA-GP in the second stage. In fact, the heat release behaviors are relative to the degradation mode of the material. From the thermogravimetric results of PVA membranes (Fig. 6 and Table 2 ), it can be seen that the pyrolysis process of all PVA membranes is also divided into two stages. For pure PVA, the majority of the weight loss appears between 220 °C and 320 °C, corresponding maximum heat release. In this stage, the main degradation process is the elimination of side groups, resulting in the formation of large quantities of water and small flammable molecules such as aldehydes, ketones and benzene, while the residual part generates conjugated structures with higher thermal stability and further cross-linking and cyclization structure [30,31]. The second degradation occurs between 350 °C and 500 °C, which corresponds to the breakdown of PVA backbone and cyclization reactions. Obviously, the release amount of the decomposed small molecules in the second stage is much less than that of the first one. By contrast, PVA-GP membranes have better thermal stability. Take PVA-GP-15 as an example, its initial decomposition temperature raised from 228 °C to 238 °C, and T1max increased from 248 °C to 288 °C. This can be attributed to the hydrogen bond crosslinking between GP and PVA. The elimination rate of hydroxyl groups on PVA is effectively reduced because of the hydrogen bond interaction between GP and PVA molecules, so the degradation of PVA is delayed and the first HRR peak of PVA-GP membrane shift to higher temperature [32,33]. On the other hand, with the increase of temperature, the hydrogen bond is destroyed completely and the catalytic dehydration of PVA by phosphoric acid appears, resulting in water as the main product of first stage, cutting down the production of small molecule combustibles, and promoting the cross-linking and cyclization of more residues [34,35]. Therefore, the HRR of PVA-GP membrane is greatly reduced and the residual mass is higher than that of pure PVA. In addition, the carbon residue rate of the materials at 650°Cincreased from 8% of pure PVA to 15% of PVA-GP-15, indicating that GP has a certain role in promoting carbon formation. In summary, GP effectively retards the degradation and improves the thermal stability of PVA through hydrogen bonding between GP and PVA molecules. At the same time, the HRR of PVA is greatly reduced and the flame retardancy is improved by catalytic dehydration and carbon formation based on GP."
9,Flame retardant mechanisms analysis,"3.4 Flame retardant mechanisms analysis To analyze the role that GP play on the flame retardancy during combustion, SEM combined with EDS is employed to investigate the morphology and surface elemental constitution of the carbonized PVA membranes as shown in Fig. 7 . The difference in the residues surface morphologies between pure PVA and PVA-GP-15 is obvious. The surface of the pure PVA residues is very rough, and covered with cracks, while that of PVA-GP-15 is smoother, condensed and covered with many bubbles. From the EDS results, a relative high content of P but no N are detected in the residues of PVA-GP-15 membrane. It demonstrates that P plays the flame retardant role (P-containing acids catalyze the resin into chars)in the condensed phase, hence P element mainly remains in the chars. In contrast, the majority of N is converted to the volatilized N-containing gases into the gaseous phase. The quick release of the inert gases at high temperature results in the formation of the bubbles on the surface of GP/PVA residues. As shown in Fig. 8 , the existing structure of phosphorus in the chars is analyzed by FT-IR. Compared with pure PVA, the characteristic stretching vibration peaks of PO at 1263 cm−1, P–O–C at 1092 cm−1 and P–O–P at 906 cm−1 are observed in the spectrum of carbonized PVA-GP-15. The appearance of P–O–C and P–O–P indicates that phosphoric acid condense to polyphosphoric acid and cross-link with residual PVA chains to form char layer. The above mechanisms based on P–N synergism can be described as follows: GP is first decomposed into phosphoric acid and guanidine at high temperature. Guanidine is further converted to the gases such as N2 and CO2 [25]. The volatilized inert gases can effectively dilute the concentration of oxygen and fuel, as well as take heat away. Besides, the generated volatile phosphorus compounds can release phosphorus-containing active radicals to capture H· and OH· free radicals in combustion reactions [36], then slow down the combustion reaction. On the other side, the produced acids can promote dehydration, crosslinking and cyclization of PVA, thus constructing continuous and condensed charring structure. Possible flame retardancy mechanisms of GP flame retardant PVA are described in Scheme 2 according to our experimental results and related references [37–40]."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, a flame retardant and transparent PVA membrane is successfully prepared by a simple and economic hydrogen bond complexation, which is different from conventional physical blending and chemical modification. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between GP molecules and PVA chains can achieve micro phase dispersion and good combination of the flame retardant in PVA membrane. It shows that 15 wt% GP not only improve the tensile strength by 47%, but also endow PVA membrane (thickness of 0.15 mm) with VTM-0 rating and LOI of 31.2%. The complexation of GP obviously retards the degradation course of PVA in the main stage, leading to shift of the DTG peak to high temperature region. Hence, the PHRR of the flame retardant PVA in this degradation stage is decreased by 73% compared with pure PVA. The remarkably improved flame retardance is ascribed to formation of the continuous and dense char layer containing phosphides that effectively separate the inner polymers from fire. The evolution results from a series of complicated chemical reactions between the decomposition products of GP and PVA."
