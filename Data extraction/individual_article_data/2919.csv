0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) economy is a sensational arena in energy research platform, finding its candidature as an alternative fuel to meet the global demand (Boboescu et al., 2016; Kruger, 2006). Being the lightest gas of existence in the earth, hydrogen has a higher specific energy (120–142 MJ/kg) than the conventional petroleum based fuels such as methane (50 MJ/kg), ethanol (26.8 MJ/kg) etc. (Acar and Dincer, 2014; Liu et al., 2010). Other advantages of H2 are that, clean fuel with non-polluting nature and environmental benefits, an important feedstock for the chemical industry. Currently, advanced techniques are acclaimed in hydrogen production with more interest towards biological route of production when compared to the intricate industrial production (Dincer, 2012; Ding et al., 2016). Large-scale production methods are very high energy intensive processes which involves high temperature and has a large impact on the environment. Application of biotechnology and microbiology in the discipline of engineering of certain process have encouraged bioprocess technology as fruitful one in advancement towards sustainability (Manish and Banerjee, 2008). Various biological methods including dark fermentation, photo-fermentation, biophotolysis etc., involve in processes with aid of enzymes and particular microorganisms are responsible for biohydrogen production. Each of these methods have pros and cons depending upon the selectivity of enzymes / microorganisms (Manish and Banerjee, 2008). Another route of investigation apart from these methods with help of bioresources and waste-to-wealth technology has evolved as a cutting edge technique based on bioelectrochemical synthesis of hydrogen in either pure form or combined with methane / other gases termed as Microbial Electrolysis cell (MEC) (Butti et al., 2016). MEC is a bioelectrochemical system in which specific group of microorganisms called as exoelectrogens (eg. Pseudomonas, E.coli, B. subtilis etc.) are capable of degrading the organic matter present in the waste/wastewater into hydrogen generation with the supply of small energy input (less than water electrolysis <1.23 V) to overcome the thermodynamic barriers for favourable reactions (Lu and Ren, 2016). There are various factors which directly influence the performance of the MEC system and several researches are being explored in all aspects of these systems (Kadier et al., 2016; Sleutels et al., 2012). The prime factor of consideration in influencing the MEC performance is the reactor configuration based on mainly capacity along with presence of membrane (Kitching et al., 2017). Other operational parameters such as pH, wastewater concentration, temperature, applied voltage etc. directly impact the performance along with the components of the system such as anode, cathode, catalysts, microorganisms and substrates (Kumar et al., 2013; Kundu et al., 2013; Pandey et al., 2016; Shrestha et al., 2018). The overwhelming challenge in this field is the suitable material development with less cost and energy efficiency. The choice of anode is very simple because various carbon-based materials fulfil the characteristics of anode material along with economic considerations (Tang et al., 2011). But, in the place of cathode material, precious metals have been employed fully, or atleast used in appropriate proportion as a cathode catalyst, thus increasing the cost of the overall process (Pant et al., 2012). Over the past two decades, there is a favourable advancement in the cathode material with a faster shift from platinum (Pt) to other low cost alternatives (Rozendal et al., 2008). Recently, Nickel has been prominently employed in the development of cathode material due to its cost, availability and high performance in MEC (Jinlong et al., 2016; Mustakeem, 2015). Nickel foam (NF) is one form of metallic Nickel which has excelled in performance in many studies of MEC and comparable with the performance of Pt/C (Jeremiasse et al., 2010; Ribot-Llobet et al., 2013; Siwek et al., 2019). Even oxides of Nickel and other nickel based materials have also been used as catalyst (Lu et al., 2016; Selembo et al., 2010; 2009). But, application of these catalysts on the cathode influence the economy of operation (Kundu et al., 2013). From the electrochemical prospective, Nickel based materials have lower hydrogen over potential in the range from −140 mV to −270 mV (vs SHE) and relatively lesser onset potential of −84 mV with higher current density of 10–20 mA cm−2 and very low charge transfer resistance especially for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (Vij et al., 2017). In the recent investigation, Ni2P nanoparticle catalyst (Ni2P/C) was employed as cathode catalyst in a neutral pH electrolyte against fermentation effluent in MEC and maximum hydrogen production of 0.29 ± 0.04 L-H2/L-reactor as compared to Pt/C and Ni/C (Kim et al., 2019). So, these types of novel catalysts have to be expedited in order to achieve economy benefits and energy efficiency. The application of catalysts on biohydrogen production using real time wastewater has added the significant value to this technology. Sugar industry effluents possess organic matter that has been explored with various cathodes and catalyst coatings in previous studies (Jayabalan et al., 2020b, 2019; 2020a). Meanwhile the Molybdenum catalysts have been experimented in various MEC studies and have advantages to improve the HER with fast reaction kinetics (Jinlong et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2014). The NiMo has shown improved hydrogen production than that of NiCo and NiFe (Hu et al., 2010; Mitov et al., 2017). In the previous work, Nickel cobaltite nanoparticles applications for hydrogen production was demonstrated with higher hydrogen production than the basic transition metal oxides catalysts (Jayabalan et al., 2020a). With consideration of the benefits of molybdenum, cobaltite could be replaced with molybdate in formulation of Nickel Molybdate (NiMoO4) nanocatalyst, which has to be investigated for better hydrogen production through this microbial electrolysis route. Hence, in the current investigation, sugar industrial wastewater (SWW) was used as a substrate against neutral pH electrolyte (50 mM Phosphate buffer catholyte) in a dual chamber MEC. As reported in previous study, the evaluation of novel cathode catalysts against realistic substrate (industrial wastewater) is necessary for enhancing the electrochemical activity by facilitating the faster electron transport and HER activity (Jayabalan et al., 2019). The catalyst was formulated and synthesised as crystalline nanoparticles and coated in the Nickel foam to study its performance in MEC. In this work, the biohydrogen production in MEC with sugar wastewater using the synthesized catalysts on the NF was practically validated with parameters namely, hydrogen production rate (HPR), coloumbic efficiency (CE), cathodic hydrogen recovery (CHR) and overall hydrogen recovery (OHR)."
1,Materials and Methodology:,
2,Sugar wastewater characteristics,"2.1 Sugar wastewater characteristics Sugar industry wastewater was collected from a sugar processing unit located nearby Tiruchirappalli, India. It was stored in the deep freezer to avoid self-deterioration of the contents available in the effluent. The important characteristics of the sugar industry wastewater were pH: 4.5 ± 0.1, COD: 4200 ± 20 mg/L, TDS: 2890 ± 10 mg/L, estimated glucose content: 2240 ± 20 mg/L, salinity: 2450 ± 10 mg/L, conductivity: 5.8 ± 0.05 mS/cm, yellowish brown colour with foul odour and less turbidity respectively. All the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and directly used without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of NiMoO4 nanocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of NiMoO4 nanocatalysts Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and Sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) were used as the precursors of Ni and Mo sources respectively. In this typical synthesis of sonochemical precipitation method, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.526 g) and Na2MoO4·2H2O (1.270 g) were made to 60 mL solution with the help of distilled water individually to obtain a molar ratio of 1:1. Further steps were carried out based on previously described synthesis procedure (Alborzi and Khademolhoseini, 2016). Initially Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution was heated at 50 °C for 10 min and then Na2MoO4·2H2O solution was added drop wise to it. Further the solution temperature was raised to 80 °C and kept under constant stirring and followed by ultra-sonication (50 W) for 1 h. Finally, a green precipitate obtained was filtered, washed several times with ethanol and distilled water. The final product obtained was dried in a vacuum oven at 90 °C for 2 h. The synthesized NiMoO4 nanoparticles were to be confirmed using various characterisation techniques. For the fabrication of modified electrodes, a known amount of synthesized nanoparticles were added into deionized (DI) water and kept in sonication bath for 30 min to get uniform dispersion. Then, Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) binder was added into the suspension in ratio of 1:10 (wt/wt %) and heated at 60 °C for 3 h and then kept under sonication for 1 h. This uniform dispersion was coated on NF to obtain 10 mg/cm2 of nanocomposite coated electrode, which was further kept in a vacuum dryer at 60 °C for 12 h and designated as NM-NF."
4,Physicochemical and electrochemical analysis,"2.3 Physicochemical and electrochemical analysis X-Ray diffraction patterns were recorded with help of diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) operated with Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54178 Å) in the range of 2ϴ between 10° and 90° with step size 2°. Scanning Electron Microscope images were observed in VEGA3 SCAN SEM instrument to illustrate the size of the catalyst. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images were obtained from High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL-2100 + ) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The electrochemical station (Amtek si, USA) was used for performing electrochemical characterization. Three-electrode system was used in the electrochemical analysis with the fabricated electrode as working electrode, Platinum mesh as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode in the 50 mM phosphate buffer (PB) solution as electrolyte. Linear sweep Voltammetry (CV) were conducted for both fabricated and control electrode in the potential range of −1.0 V and + 1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Additionally, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were performed for both electrodes in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 kHz at 10 mV amplitude. Amtek si supported Versa software was used for the electrochemical analysis."
5,MEC construction and operation,"2.4 MEC construction and operation Three identical dual chamber MEC were designed and fabricated as previously described by Jayabalan et al. (2019). The anode and cathode chamber were separated by proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117). Anode and cathode chamber had a working volume of 250 mL out of empty volume of 280 mL each respectively. An external DC power supply (Bestmach Make, Chennai, India) was used to supply additional voltage to the reactor. A 10 Ω resistor was connected across the circuit for the current measurement which was recorded continuously using Data acquisition system (LTDAQ, Labtech instruments, Chennai, India). In the anode compartment, sugar industry wastewater without any further dilution was used as a substrate and 50 mM phosphate buffer (PB) solution was used as catholyte. The graphite electrode was used as the anode while NF decorated with various materials was used as the cathode in individual reactors respectively. The plain NF was used as a cathode for control experiment. Before every start of MEC experimentation, substrate and catholyte were filled into their respective compartment using peristaltic pumps, Nitrogen gas was purged into the anode and cathode side and then completely sealed to maintain anaerobic environment. A graduated water displacement unit was specially fabricated for hydrogen gas collection and was connected to the cathode side. The quality of the produced gas was tested intermittently using Gas Chromatography (Thermofisher, USA)."
6,Analysis and Calculations:,"2.5 Analysis and Calculations: The cell voltage was recorded using data acquisition system (LTDAQ-1052, Labtech Electronics Pvt Ltd, Chennai). The current (mA) was calculated from the observed potential using ohms’ law equation. The MEC performance in terms of hydrogen production rate, coloumbic efficiency, COD removal efficiency, cathodic and overall hydrogen recovery were calculated as described previously by Jayabalan et al. (2019). The important parameters such as pH, conductivity, Total dissolved solids (TDS), Salinity were measured using multi-parameter analysis kit (PCD650, Eutech). The wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured using standard potassium dichromate (closed reflux) method. The hydrogen gas was analyzed using Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis performed with Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) using nitrogen as carrier gas."
7,Result and discussion:,
8,Characterisation of NiMoO4 and NM/NF cathode,"3.1 Characterisation of NiMoO4 and NM/NF cathode The crystallinity and the structural characterization of the synthesised nanoparticles were determined by XRD patterns shown in the supporting information. The main characteristic diffraction peaks were obtained at 14.4°, 25.7°, 26.9°, 29.1°, 32.7°, 43.9°, 47.5° and 62.1° were consigned to (110), (021), (112), (220), (310), (330), (204) and (103) planes of NiMoO4, respectively. This diffraction pattern results were in good agreement with monoclinic α-NiMoO4 nanoparticles (PDF# 31-0902) and thus, indicated the successful formation of NiMoO4 without any oxide or other impurities (Oudghiri-Hassani and Wadaani, 2018). The morphological studies of the cathode catalyst were investigated with help of TEM images that showed filamentous rod like shape crystals found as more agglomerated nanoparticles with polymeric binder."
9,Electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization Before venturing into experimental studies, the cathode catalyst performance was evaluated along with control cathode in electrochemical tests such as Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). It was clearly evident from the Fig. 1 A that the electrochemical property of the catalyst loaded cathode had exhibited an improved performance favorable for HER kinetics as compared to the control electrode. Comparatively, the onset potential of NM-NF with sharp increase and higher current densities were observed, thus validating better performance of material loading. The value of overpotential for NF was −750 mV while NM-NF was −650 mV under testing conditions with scan rate of 50 mV/s. This can be directly ascribed to their realistic performance in experimentation by the significance of the catalyst loaded into the Nickel foam and paving way for faster HER kinetics. At the potential of 1.0 V, the maximum current densities achieved by NF and NM-NF were 5.21 mA/cm2 and 8.1 mA/cm2 respectively. This was implication of improvement in electrons transfer by the NiMoO4 catalyst almost 1.6 times higher than the uncoated cathode. In overall, the overpotential of the nickel foam was considerably reduced due to addition of suitable catalysts (Li et al., 2017). From the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 1B, it was clearly visible that NM-NF revealed a lower ohmic resistance than NF. The initial region in Nyquist plots was accounted for promoting the ions movement between the interfacial and inner active sites and the subsequent second semicircle was responsible for the charge transfer resistance (Wang et al., 2015). The inset of Fig. 1B illustrates the equivalent circuit of NM-NF electrode. The overall resistance was considerably lesser than NF because of the catalyst loading into the scaffold structure (Fan et al., 2008; Oh and Logan, 2006). The charge transfer resistance significantly decreased in NM-NF which represented fast HER kinetics than NF (Hou et al., 2014a, 2014b)."
10,Current density profile,"3.3 Current density profile The current density profile for the control and NM-NF cathodes are shown in Fig. 2 . The average current densities during initial startup was observed to be slightly slower in NF when compared to NM-NF operated MEC over the first twelve hours of operation. Importantly, after stabilization (after twenty hours of operation) there was a drastic improvement in current densities between NF and NM-NF, which could be related to MEC hydrogen production performance on second day. The lower current density was achieved by uncoated NF with value of 1.26 A/m2 while the NM-NF excelled with 17% higher current density indicating higher HER activity. From Fig. 2, it was also inferred that the current densities of both electrodes were stable on third day and begun to decrease on the fourth and the consecutive day in parallel to the hydrogen production rate in the MEC. These current densities of NF and NM-NF were coherent with results of electrochemical characterization studies."
11,Hydrogen production rate and hydrogen recoveries,"3.4 Hydrogen production rate and hydrogen recoveries The NM-NF attained higher HPR in the electrolyte of phosphate buffer (neutral pH) when compared with control experiments in the MEC. As aforementioned earlier, the results of hydrogen production rate obtained were analogous to the profile of LSV and current densities of the two cathodes. At an applied voltage of 1.0 V, the HPR was 4.28 ± 0.13 mmol/L/D which is equal to 0.12 ± 0.003 L/L/D in the MEC using NM-NF. The cumulative hydrogen production rate with respect to each reactor (250 mL capacity) is shown the Fig. 3 . The day wise hydrogen production was illustrated as inset of the Fig. 3, which described that the hydrogen production on 2nd and 3rd day were maximum as compared to other days. These results were comparable to the nickel cobaltite-graphene nanocomposites (0.14 ± 0.003 L/L/D i.e. 6.08 mmol/L/D) operated with same wastewater and operating conditions (Jayabalan et al., 2020a). When compared to nickel cobaltite in the previous study, this value of HPR demonstrated that performance of NM-NF excelled nearly 1.4 folds higher than cobaltite operated MEC. Significantly, the HPR in the MEC using NM-NF cathode was 2.63 folds higher than bare NF using neutral pH PB buffer against SWW substrate. In a previous study, Ni2P on carbon black used as cathode catalyst in dual chamber MEC using fermentation effluent produced slightly higher HPR (0.29 L/ L substrate/D) but it is practically difficult to compare these rates owing to different configurations and substrates (Kim et al., 2019). Apart from HPR, the hydrogen and energy recoveries also followed the same trends signifying the effect of low cost catalyst alternative to conventional catalysts in hydrogen production through MEC technology. The MEC performance was assessed through current measurement, COD removal and realistic gas collection based on various expressions. Based on the current measured over time and COD removal, coulombic efficiency (CE) of the two MECs were calculated as 49.11%, anf 58.72% for NF and NM-NF respectively represented in Fig. 4 . The current data recorded was accounted for the better CE of the catalyst-loaded cathode. Based on the number of moles from hydrogen gas collected against the measured current, CHR was found to be 20.36% for NM-NF while it was 16.36% for the control experiment. In addition, OHR had increased from 9.3% of NF to 11.96% of NM-NF. Both MECs exhibited higher than 100% energy efficiencies (EE) relative to the electrical input based on the recovery of hydrogen gas over the batch operation."
12,Substrate degradation,"3.5 Substrate degradation The treatment efficiency of the MEC system is another measure of evaluation of overall performance in terms of the extent of degradation of organics of the substrate. SWW was low organic wastewater with initial COD of 4200 ± 20 mg/L and almost half of the COD had been removed in these MEC studies. These percentage removals were mainly credited to the inherent microorganisms available in the natural substrate and effective transportation of protons through the Nafion membrane and electrons across the circuit reaching cathode for hydrogen formation. In-situ microorganisms present in the collected sugar industry effluent were responsible for the oxidation of the organics (mostly the reducing sugars) to mimic the natural environment. With reference to 5 days’ batch operations, the COD removal efficiency were 54.8% for NM-NF and 46.87% for NF shown in Fig. 5 . Moreover, probably 8.0% variation in COD might be accountable for high current density and high HPR in NM-NF. There are similar rate of substrate degradation reported in many studies of natural industrial effluents and even a lesser rate of COD removal (12–32%) had been attained in acetate substrate (Wang et al., 2017)."
13,Conclusion,"The crystalline NiMoO4 nanoparticles were synthesized, coated on Ni-foam, and evaluated as an alternative cathode catalyst in the phosphate buffer electrolyte against sugar industry wastewater in the MEC. Based on 5 days’ batch cycle, the MEC with the NiMoO4/NF cathode had an average hydrogen production rate (0.12 ± 0.01 L.H2/L/D), 58.23% coloumbic efficiency, 20.36% cathodic hydrogen recovery, 11.96% overall hydrogen recovery and 54.8% treatment efficiency respectively. The feasibility of NiMoO4 nanoparticles as an alternative catalyst in MECs was demonstrated and further material development have to be investigated in order to achieve better hydrogen evolution comparable to conventional catalysts."
