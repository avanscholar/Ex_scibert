0,Introduction,"Scandium is one of the most valuable metals. Amongst many applications, it is used in the production of high strength and lightweight Al alloys and in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) [1–6]. The estimated cost of Sc metal ingots in 2019 was approximately 134 USD per gram [7]. Some scandium containing ores (50–100 ppm) have been discovered and exploited mainly in Asia [8–10]. Currently, there is no industrial scale production of Sc in Europe and USA, and there is a scarcity of exploitable Sc ores. It is thus desirable to implement a process for the recovery of Sc from waste streams of other mineral processing industries. Some waste streams that could be valorized include red mud (60–120 ppm Sc) generated by the alumina industry, acid waste from the TiO2 industry and lateritic Ni-Co processing waste streams [8,11–14]. The techniques by which Sc can be recovered from waste streams include, but are not limited to, leaching, solvent extraction, crystallization and metallothermic reduction of ScF3. In the solvent extraction stage, NH4F solutions allow effective stripping of Sc from the organic phase [15]. The resulting strip liquor can be subjected to anti-solvent crystallization using alcohol solvents to recover Sc as (NH4)3ScF6 with yields and purities greater than 98% and 98.3 wt%, respectively [15–17]. For successful design of a robust anti-solvent crystallization process, accurate solubility data in a range of compositions of the chosen solvent/anti-solvent system are indispensable. The present study focuses on the solubility of solid ammonium scandium fluoride phases, chiefly (NH4)3ScF6, in NH4F-alcohol mixtures, given the importance of such systems for the recovery of (NH4)3ScF6 from ammonium fluoride strip liquors by anti-solvent crystallization using alcohol as anti-solvent. The supersaturation (ΔC) achieved upon adding a known quantity of anti-solvent to the aqueous solution, which determines the theoretical yield of the recovered (NH4)3ScF6, can be estimated if the initial scandium concentration in the strip liquor and the solubility of the (NH4)3ScF6 phase under the operational conditions are known, taking into account the volume change that occurs upon adding alcohol to the aqueous solution. Here, we report the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in NH4F solutions of concentrations in the range 1–12.2 mol/L and in various NH4F-alcohol mixtures over the NH4F concentration range of 2–5 mol/L at alcohol molar concentrations of 0.5–9 mol/L for methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1,3-propane-diol. To our knowledge, no such data have been published to date. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in about 3 mol/L HF solution at 25 °C was estimated through extrapolation of published data as about 3.6 g Sc/L [18]. (NH4)3ScF6 was observed to transform to NH4ScF4 in pure water and the solubility of the new phase in pure water at 25 °C is reported as 1.13 g Sc/L [18], 0.91 g Sc/L [19] and 1.29 g Sc/L [20]. The values in [18] were obtained after 3.5–4 h of equilibration in closed vessels and the Sc concentration was determined using a modified titration method based on the formation of a coloured complex. The dissolution mechanism of (NH4)3ScF6 can be represented by the reaction below: (NH4)3ScF6 ⇔ 3NH4 + + ScF6 3− ⇔ 3NH4 + + µnScFn (3−n) + βF− where µ is the stoichiometric co-efficient of species n, for n = 0 to 6 and β is the stoichiometric co-efficient of free fluoride ions (F−). However, this speciation equilibrium reaction is simplified and does not take into account scandium hydroxide complexes and some polynuclear complexes such as Sc2F3 3+. The dominant ScFn (3−n) species or complexes in solution are governed by the stability or formation constants of the species whose values at zero ionic strength and 25 °C, are documented in the literature [15,21,22]. An increase in the fluoride ion concentration favours the formation of higher order ScFn (3−n) complexes. Thermodynamic modelling of a Sc-F aqueous system containing 67 mmol/L total Sc has shown the predominance of the ScF6 3− complex at total fluoride concentrations above 0.5 mol/L [15]. Likewise, the predominance of the ScF6 3− complex will favour the precipitation of (NH4)3ScF6 beyond its solubility limit provided there is an abundance of NH4 + ions in solution. This implies that the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 would decrease with increased fluoride ion concentration in an NH4F system due to the common ion effect [23,24] caused by the presence of both NH4 + and F− ions. The solubility of both (NH4)3ScF6 and ScF3 has been reported to increase with increased HF concentration up to 5 mol/L and to slightly decrease in the HF concentration range of 5–24 mol/L. This decrement has been attributed to the common ion effect and dominance of higher order ScFn (3−n) complexes in solution [18]. It has been reported in previous research that (NH4)3ScF6 transforms to NH4ScF4 when contacted with pure water and dilute NH4F solutions [18–20,25]. The decomposition reactions in water and HF acid have been reported in the literature [18]. The phase equilibrium of (NH4)3ScF6 has also been investigated in NH4HF2 solutions of concentration 0.05–3.5 mol/L, corresponding to F− concentrations of 0.1–7 mol/L at 18 °C and 90 °C [26]. It was observed that at 18 °C and total F− concentration ≤ 1.06 mol/L and at 90 °C and total F− concentrations in the range 2.92–3.01 mol/L, formation of the phase (NH4)5Sc3F14 occurred. The NH4ScF4 phase was detected at 90 °C and total F− ion concentration < 2 mol/L as well as at 18 °C and total F− concentration ≥ 1.92 mol/L, while the (NH4)3ScF6 phase was dominant at higher total fluoride concentration > ca. 2 mol/L for both temperatures. In most cases, the solids were mixtures of two or all three of the phases. The transformation of the hexafluoride to the tetrafluoride phase was also reported to occur at fluoride ion concentration of 1.8 mol/L [19,20]. Other possible phases include NH4Sc3F10 and (NH4)2Sc3F11 [26–28]. The solubility of salts in aqueous systems can be reduced by addition of solvents in which the desired salt has limited solubility. Of particular interest in this study are aliphatic alcohols, which consist of a hydrophobic alkyl chain and a hydrophilic OH group. The latter allows hydrogen bond formation with water molecules, leading to a high aqueous solubility of smaller alcohol molecules [29,30]. Small-chain aliphatic alcohols up to propanol are completely miscible in water at 25 °C, whilst longer chain alcohols are partially miscible. When a second solvent is introduced to a near-saturated aqueous salt solution, the solvent-solvent attractive forces that occur must be stronger than the solute-solvent attractive forces in order to de-solubilize the salt [31]. These forces are related to the dielectric constant of the solvent medium, which is a measure of its ability to keep charges or ions separated. Solvents of high dielectric constants have high polarity and allow solute molecules to undergo complete dissociation, by reducing the attractive force between ions of opposite charges in solution, hence increased solubilization [32,33]. On the other hand, solvents of low dielectric constants promote ion pairing [34]. Consequently, ions in solution can exist as contacted ion pairs or separated charges depending on the dielectric constant of the solvent [35]. The standard dielectric constants reported in the literature are the static zero-frequency values since the dielectric constant decreases with increasing frequency of the electrical field applied during measurement [36]. Table 1 shows the dielectric constants of alcohols and water. Almost similar values have been reported in other sources [34,36,39–43]. The dielectric constant of 1,3-propane-diol is higher than that of monohydric alcohols due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups which increases the polarity. Experimentally determined effective dielectric constants of alcohol-water mixtures have been observed to decrease with increased alcohol content [39,44]."
1,Methodology,
2,Synthesis of (NH4)3ScF6 (s),"2.1 Synthesis of (NH4)3ScF6 (s) Crystalline (NH4)3ScF6 was synthesized by anti-solvent crystallization from a synthetic 3 mol/L NH4F strip liquor containing about 2000 mg/L Sc. The strip liquor was generated by MEAB Chemie Technik GmbH, Germany, through solvent extraction of a scandium sulphate solution followed by stripping of the organic phase using an aqueous 3 mol/L NH4F solution. 99.95 v/v% ethanol was used as the anti-solvent and added to the strip liquor at a volumetric ratio of 1:1. Another method employed was precipitation by reacting near-saturated solutions of Sc2(SO4)3 and NH4F. These solutions were prepared using scandium sulphate (purchased from Richest Group, China) of purity > 99.9 wt% and NH4F of purity > 98 wt%. In both cases, a white crystalline precipitate was obtained, washed with ethanol and dried under ambient conditions. Powder XRD (SIEMENS™ D5000) was used to identify the solid phase obtained. ICP-OES (ThermoScientific iCAP™ 7400) was used to determine the purity of the solid by dissolving it in distilled water and further diluting with a 3.45 v/v% HNO3 solution prior to analysis. A Philips/FEI-XL™ 30 series environmental scanning electron microscope was used to determine the product crystal size."
3,Measurement of solubility,"2.2 Measurement of solubility NH4F solutions were prepared in concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12.2 mol/L using deionized water of resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm. The alcohols used include 99.9 v/v% methanol, 99.95 v/v% ethanol, 99.9 v/v% 2-propanol and 99.9 v/v% 1,3-propane-diol. The NH4F-alcohol mixtures were prepared by adding the respective alcohol to NH4F solutions of known concentration to attain specific alcohol molar concentrations between 0.5 and 9 mol/L. Tables A.1–A.3 in the Appendices show the mixture quantities and the representation of the alcohol concentrations as alcohol to aqueous volumetric ratios. About 0.4 g of (NH4)3ScF6 was added to each NH4F-alcohol mixture (maximum 60 g) and immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 °C. The water bath was equipped with a PT100 temperature sensor with an accuracy of ±0.01 °C for temperature control. The temperature variation amongst the experimental containers was determined by a Traceable® digital thermometer to be about ±0.06 °C. The suspensions were agitated by magnetic stirring bars at 250 rpm over night for about 24 h, which was the pre-determined time for attainment of equilibrium as shown in Fig. B.1 in the Appendices. This procedure was also employed in the determination of (NH4)3ScF6 solubility in pure NH4F solutions, pure water and pure alcohols. At equilibrium, the solutions were visually checked to verify that complete dissolution of all solids had not occurred, and a supernatant sample was withdrawn from each container using a syringe fitted with a 0.22 µm PVDF membrane filter. ICP-OES was used to measure the total concentration of Sc from which the solubility was computed in units of g (NH4)3ScF6/kg solution. However, in pure water where the solid was observed to transform to NH4ScF4, the solubility is expressed as g NH4ScF4/kg solution. Powder XRD was employed to identify the phase of the dried residual solids after filtration and drying to establish whether any phase transformation had occurred during equilibration. The surface elemental composition of the residual solids that exhibited phase transformation after equilibration was also determined by SEM EDS in an attempt to verify the new solid phases. A series of experiments to determine the effect of temperature on the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 3 mol/L NH4F dosed with different ethanol concentrations were conducted at temperatures of 10.3 ± 0.1 °C and 34.6 ± 0.2 °C. Some experiments were also conducted to determine the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in pure water and pure alcohols by adding about 1 g of the solid sample to about 10 g of the solvent and conducting sampling and analyses as outlined above. All experiments were conducted in polypropylene containers which were tightly sealed, and losses of alcohol by evaporation were expected to be negligible."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of solids,"3.1 Characterization of solids Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns obtained for the synthesized solids and for the residual solids after the solubility experiments. The XRD patterns of the synthesized precipitate matched that of (NH4)3ScF6 (PDF card – 00-040-0595) with a monoclinic structure [26]. The precipitate consisted of crystals that were regular-shaped with sizes in the range 1–2 µm. The purity of the solid as determined by ICP-OES after dissolving the solids in water and diluting the resulting solution to concentrations suitable for ICP-OES analysis was determined to be >99.96 wt%. The XRD patterns of the dry residual solids after the solubility experiments indicate that solid phase transformations had occurred in pure water and NH4F solutions of concentration <0.8 mol/L. However, no phase transformation was observed for experiments conducted in 1–12.2 mol/L NH4F solutions (without alcohol) and for the experiments conducted in mixtures of 3 mol/L NH4F and 0.5 mol/L alcohol (for all alcohols). More experiments were conducted in NH4F solutions of concentration <0.8 mol/L in an attempt to establish the concentration threshold for this transformation under the investigated conditions. XRD patterns of solids obtained at ≤0.5 mol/L NH4F do not match that of (NH4)3ScF6 obtained at 0.8 mol/L NH4F, showing that the onset of this transformation lies in the NH4F concentration range of 0.5–0.8 mol/L. The XRD pattern of the solids obtained in pure water closely matches to a great extent the reference pattern of NH4ScF4 obtained from the Crystallography Open Database (COD) [45], and the patterns for solids obtained at 0.1 and 0.5 mol/L NH4F do not entirely match the reference patterns of either NH4ScF4, (NH4)3ScF6, NH4Sc3F10, (NH4)2Sc3F11 or (NH4)5Sc3F14 (cf. Fig. C.1 in the Appendices for the profile peak matching). However, the XRD patterns obtained at ≥0.8 mol/L NH4F resemble more closely that of the synthesized (NH4)3ScF6 product. The XRD reference patterns of NH4Sc3F10, (NH4)2Sc3F11 and (NH4)5Sc3F14 were obtained from the Pauling File Database [46–48]. As the fluoride concentration is increased to 0.8 mol/L (see Fig. 1B–E, respectively), there are notable changes to the XRD patterns in each case. At 0.8 and 1 mol/L NH4F, the XRD patterns are quite similar to that of the (NH4)3ScF6 product. This also holds for experiments conducted in mixtures of 3 mol/L NH4F and 0.5 mol/L of the respective alcohol (Fig. 1G–J). The phase transformation of (NH4)3ScF6 at NH4F concentrations below 0.8 mol/L can be attributed to dominance of lower order ScFn (3−n) species in low fluoride media as shown by thermodynamic modelling in previous research [15]. Consequently, this could result in a product mixture of the hexafluoride and the tetrafluoride phases and/or other undetermined phases in different proportions since the XRD patterns were different in each case at NH4F concentrations <0.8 mol/L. It is notable that the XRD pattern for residual solids obtained from 0.1 mol/L NH4F features some peaks that match those of NH4ScF4, and the XRD pattern of solids obtained from 0.5 mol/L NH4F has some peaks that match those of (NH4)3ScF6, while the additional peaks indicate the presence of other phases. For this reason, EDS analyses was conducted for the residual solids obtained after 24 h in water and NH4F solutions of concentrations 0.1 and 0.5 mol/L to determine their surface elemental composition shown in Table 2 . The computed elemental weight compositions for known ammonium scandium fluoride phases are also presented for comparison purposes. The concentration of elements in the residual solid that was in contact with water closely matches that of NH4ScF4. The elemental weight composition of the residual solid obtained from 0.1 mol/L NH4F solution has almost similar N content to the tetrafluoride phase, but lower Sc content which is almost comparable to that of (NH4)5Sc3F14. The residual solid from the 0.5 mol/L NH4F solution has an elemental composition that is comparable to that of the (NH4)5Sc3F14 phase. On the basis of EDS and XRD analyses, the residual solid from the 0.1 mol/L NH4F solution could be a mixture of NH4ScF4 and an undetermined phase while the residual solid from 0.5 mol/L NH4F solution could be a mixture of (NH4)3ScF6 and (NH4)5Sc3F14 since the XRD pattern of the solid has reflections from both phases. As reported in the literature, the (NH4)5Sc3F14 phase was also obtained at total fluoride concentration ≤1.06 mol/L at 18 °C and higher total fluoride concentration between 2.92 and 3.01 mol/L at an elevated temperature of 90 °C [26]. Fig. 2 shows the micrographs of the residual solids obtained by SEM analyses. The residual solids obtained from pure water (Fig. 2A) have a high population of needle-shaped crystals characteristic of the tetrafluoride phase as reported in the literature [19]. The morphology of crystals observed for the residual solids that were suspended in 1 mol/L NH4F, is octahedral prismatic (Fig. 2D). The crystals for the residual solids obtained from 0.1 mol/L NH4F (Fig. 2B) are characterized by a high proportion of slightly elongated small crystals and some large crystals that have moderately elongated columnar shapes and very few octahedral shapes. Finally, the residual solids from 0.5 mol/L NH4F (Fig. 2C) are characterized mainly by rather spherical or elliptical agglomerates. Overall, the change in morphology observed supports the phase transformation. The phase transformation could occur through dissolution of the hexafluoride product accompanied by recrystallization into the tetrafluoride product in pure water, due to dominance of ScF4 − species at low fluoride concentration. Similarly, recrystallization into other phases, particularly (NH4)5Sc3F14, in low fluoride media could occur. In the presence of alcohols, the transformation was not observed even though it is expected that the fluoride concentration would be lower taking into account the increased solution quantity. This could point to a completely different speciation which could not be verified thermodynamically. It may be hypothesized that alcohol molecules, through hydrogen bonding with water molecules reduce the water activity, depleting the solution of free water molecules available for solubilizing, and thereby actually resulting in an increase in the concentration of fluoride ions. Following these observations, the solubility data are plotted herein as g (NH4)3ScF6 per kg total solution for NH4F concentrations ≥1 mol/L (without alcohol) and for all alcohol-containing systems, while it is reported as g NH4ScF4 per kg total solution for the pure water system."
6,Solubility,"3.2 Solubility The solubility values under each set of conditions are tabulated, in the majority of cases as averages over 2–5 repeat experiments, with associated standard deviations in Table 4. The data are also presented in Figs. 3–6 . Fig. 3 shows the variation of the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in aqueous NH4F solutions with increased molar concentration of NH4F from 1 mol/L up to 12.2 mol/L solution. The highest concentration corresponds to 45.1 wt% – an almost saturated solution, given that the saturation concentration of NH4F aqueous solution is about 45.5 wt% [49]. The NH4F concentration on the x-axis refers to the concentration before dissolution of the scandium phase. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 decreases practically exponentially with increasing NH4F concentration as shown in Fig. 3. This was attributed to the increase in the concentration of both NH4 + and F− ions and predominance of the ScF6 3− (aq) complex at high F− ion concentration, favouring the solid phase (NH4)3ScF6. The common ion effect in this case is more pronounced due to the increase in the concentration of two common ions contributing to the formation of one solid phase. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in NH4F solutions of initial fluoride concentration ≤ca. 13 mol/L has been reported in the literature to follow a similar trend, but with values that are higher (of the order of 10%) than the values obtained in this study [19]. The reason for this discrepancy is not immediately clear, but could partly be due to the different analytical methods employed. The phase transformation of (NH4)3ScF6 to NH4ScF4 is also reported to start at fluoride concentrations of ca. 2 mol/L as the fluoride concentration decreases [19] whereas in this study the transformation was observed to occur at fluoride concentrations <0.8 mol/L. It should be noted that if HF solutions were used, the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 would have been expected to increase up to a certain HF concentration, after which it would decrease as reported in the literature [18]. The difference in the trend is due to the absence of NH4 + ions. Fig. 4 shows the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in NH4F solutions of different concentrations (2–5 mol/L solution) dosed with different molar concentrations of ethanol in the range 0.5–9 mol per litre. The alcohol concentration, in this and subsequent figures, is given on total solvent basis, i.e. per litre of the prepared NH4F aqueous-ethanol mixture before dissolution of the solid. Tables A.1–A.3 in the Appendices show the quantities of the NH4F aqueous solutions and ethanol that were mixed to form the desired solvent mixture. The NH4F concentration is given in units of mol NH4F per litre aqueous solution before adding ethanol. This clarification also applies to subsequent figures. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 2–5 mol/L NH4F solutions decreases with increasing ethanol concentration, and like the data in Fig. 3, the solubility decreases with increasing ammonium fluoride concentration. The decrease in solubility with increased ethanol concentration is correlated with a reduction in the effective dielectric constant of the solvent mixture, which promotes ion pairing in solution and salting out of the solute. In other words, the polarity of the solvent mixtures decreases with increasing ethanol concentration resulting in lower solubility of polar or inorganic solutes in the solvent mixtures. The solubility values for different NH4F concentrations converge beyond an ethanol concentration of 3 mol/L. Fig. 5 shows the effect of temperature on the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 3 mol/L NH4F solutions dosed with 0.5–6 mol/L ethanol. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 increases with increasing temperature between 10 and 35 °C for all ethanol concentrations. The dissolution of (NH4)3ScF6 in these solution mixtures is therefore endothermic. Fig. 6 compares the solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 3 mol/L NH4F solutions dosed with different molar concentrations of alcohols (0.5–9 mol/L) for 3 alcohols namely methanol, ethanol and 1,3-propane-diol and 0.5–3 mol/L 2-propanol. The maximum concentration of 2-propanol is limited due to the incomplete dissolution of 2-propanol in the 3 mol/L NH4F solution as its concentration increases. It was observed that at 2-propanol concentrations ≥4 mol/L, the liquid mixture has 2 liquid phases, verified by density measurement of each layer. Analyses of the separate liquid samples withdrawn from each liquid layer for the experiment conducted with 8 mol/L 2-propanol revealed that the concentration of scandium in the bottom aqueous phase was much higher than that in the top 2-propanol layer as shown in Fig. D.1 in the Appendices. Experiments were also conducted with 1,3-propane-diol and no phase separation was observed by the naked eye even at the highest concentration of 8 mol/L. The densities of liquid samples withdrawn from the top and bottom of the mixture were also similar. The phase separation observed with 2-propanol is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the molecule in comparison to methanol and ethanol, while for 1,3-propane-diol, this effect is circumvented by the increased polarity of the molecule due to its 2 hydroxyl groups. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 3 mol/L NH4F decreases with increased concentration of the alcohols investigated. It is noted that the de-solubilizing effect of the 4 alcohols generally increases with increasing molecular chain length, that is, in the order methanol; ethanol; 1,3-propane-diol and 2-propanol. For the monohydric alcohols, the trend of decreasing solubility with increasing alkyl chain length is correlated to the decrease in the dielectric constant with increasing alkyl chain, as shown in Table 1. The dihydric alcohol 1,3-propane-diol deviates from this correlation, with a dielectric constant higher than those of the monohydric alcohols, yet having a de-solubilizing capacity that is approximately intermediate between ethanol and 2-propanol. This apparent discrepancy is explained by comparing the effective dielectric constants of the solvent media, which can be computed from the pure component dielectric constants [50] using the simplified equation for an additive property: (1) ε e = ϕ a ε a + ϕ w ε w where ϕ is the volumetric fraction, ε is the dielectric constant and subscripts 'a' and 'w' represent pure alcohol and pure water, respectively [33,51,52]. Table 3 shows the computed effective dielectric constants (εe) of the solvent media for the case of 3 mol/L alcohol. Eq. (1) is only used to obtain approximate values, as it does not take into account several factors, such as the volume contraction in water-alcohol mixtures [52], that can result in deviation from the true values. More complex thermodynamic equations exist for prediction of the effective dielectric constants of solvent mixtures [33]. In the calculations, the volume fraction was used in accordance with standard procedure [51–55]. For comparison, values obtained by interpolation from published data of binary water-alcohol mixtures [44] are presented in Table 3, showing at least a qualitative similarity with estimations obtained using Eq. (1). The effective dielectric constants of electrolyte solutions generally tend to be lower than for the pure solvent mixtures, due to the decrease of the dielectric constant with increasing ionic strength [56,57] caused by the reduction in the available solvent volume fraction as the volume occupied by ions increases. It can be seen in Table 3 that, whilst the pure dihydric alcohol has a higher dielectric constant than pure monohydric alcohols, the effective dielectric constant of the 3 mol/L NH4F – 3 mol/L 1,3-propane-diol mixture is much higher than that of the solvent mixture formed with 2-propanol, and almost comparable to that of the solvent mixture formed by ethanol. This is due to a higher density of the dihydric alcohol (ca. 1.06 g/cm3) compared to the density of monohydric alcohols investigated, which are approximately 0.79 g/cm3. A higher dielectric constant promotes charge separation between the cations and anions in solution, thereby favouring the dissolution of (NH4)3ScF6 in the resulting solvent mixture. As the effective dielectric constant of the alcohol-NH4F mixture decreases, so does the solubilizing effect of the solvent mixture on (NH4)3ScF6. This is mirrored in the trend observed experimentally, and shows the importance of the dielectric constant of a solvent medium in estimating its ability to solubilize a specific solute. It can be noted in Fig. 6 that in most cases for alcohol concentrations below 4 mol/L, ethanol gives slightly higher solubility values than the dihydric alcohol except for an alcohol concentration of 0.5 mol/L. Further elaborating on this phenomenon, Fig. 7 shows the variation of the computed effective dielectric constants of the 3 mol/L NH4F-alcohol mixtures for alcohol concentrations in the range 0.5–9 mol/L. It can be noted that the effective dielectric constant of NH4F-ethanol and NH4F-1,3-propane-diol mixtures are comparable, hence almost similar solubilizing effect on (NH4)3ScF6 as shown in Fig. 6. If weight fractions are employed in these calculations, the effective dielectric constants of the solvent mixtures formed by 1,3-propane-diol would become slightly lower than the corresponding values for solution mixtures formed by ethanol (see Fig. E.1 in the Appendices). Experiments were also conducted at 25 °C to quantify the dissolution of (NH4)3ScF6 in pure water and alcohols and to investigate the phase transformation of the solid. As explained earlier, (NH4)3ScF6 transformed to NH4ScF4 in pure water and it can be assumed that the new solid phase had attained equilibrium with the liquid phase based on equilibration data shown in Fig. B.1 in the Appendices. For these reasons, the solubility in pure water can be approximately reported as 17.15 ± 1.47 g NH4ScF4/kg solution, which notably is much higher than the corresponding values of 0.91, 1.13 and 1.29 g Sc/L reported previously in the literature [18–20]. Out of twelve experiments conducted, only one value was identified as an outlier using interquartile statistical analysis and we are therefore confident of this result. (NH4)3ScF6 was found to have a negligibly low solubility in all pure alcohol solvents. The fairly high solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in water may be ascribed to the complete dissociation of (NH4)3ScF6 in water yielding ScF6 3− complexes, which in turn transform to lower order ScFn (3−n) complexes, whilst dissociation of an inorganic solute is practically impossible in a non-polar alcohol solvent. In summary, addressing the purpose of anti-solvent crystallization of (NH4)3ScF6 from strip liquors, the most efficient alcohol is the one that causes the highest de-solubilizing effect of (NH4)3ScF6. In this case, the effectiveness of the alcohols in recovering (NH4)3ScF6 decreases in the order 2-propanol, 1,3-propane-diol, ethanol and methanol. To quantify this, if a strip liquor containing 2 g Sc/kg solution (equivalent to 9.47 g (NH4)3ScF6/kg solution) in 3 mol/L NH4F is subjected to anti-solvent crystallization by adding either of the alcohols to attain an alcohol concentration of 2 mol/L, the calculated recovery of (NH4)3ScF6 increases from 53.58% for methanol to 62.48, 65.47 and 71.05% for ethanol, 1,3-propane-diol and 2-propanol, respectively. If alcohol is added to attain a concentration of 3 mol/L, these values become 63.30, 75.28, 76.32 and 78.28%, respectively. These differences become smaller as the alcohol concentration increases beyond 6 mol/L, for instance, at 8 mol/L, the (NH4)3ScF6 recoveries are higher than 97.3% for all alcohols. Table F.1 in the Appendices shows the comparison of the alcohols in terms of the computed (NH4)3ScF6 recovery upon adding alcohol in known concentrations to an aqueous solution of specific scandium and NH4F concentration. In previously reported research, a recovery of ca. 98.5% has been obtained upon adding ethanol to attain an ethanol to aqueous volumetric ratio of ca. 0.8, which is equivalent to an ethanol concentration of ca. 7.5 mol/L. This ethanol concentration was reported to be the optimal since further increase would result in no significant gain in (NH4)3ScF6 recovery [15]. In this study, three alcohols namely methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol, were used to recover (NH4)3ScF6 from strip liquor. By re-plotting previously reported experimental recovery values of (NH4)3ScF6 against the molar concentration of alcohols instead of alcohol: strip liquor volumetric ratios, a similar trend shown in Fig. 8 is obtained [15]. With account taken also of possibilities for alcohol recovery for re-use in the anti-solvent crystallization process, methanol and ethanol are the most desirable candidates since they have significantly lower boiling points of ca. 64 °C and 78 °C, respectively, in comparison to ca. 83 °C and 213 °C for 2-propanol and 1,3-propane-diol, respectively. In addition, the market price of methanol and ethanol is significantly lower than that of 2-propanol and 1,3-propane-diol. Therefore, the operational costs of the process can be significantly reduced by using methanol or ethanol as anti-solvent. Finally, the choice of solvent should also take into account a detailed risk assessment, and whilst methanol is generally less expensive than ethanol, and only about half the volume is required in comparison with ethanol to achieve the same molar concentration, it poses a higher health risk to humans."
7,Summary and conclusions,"Solubility data are reported for (NH4)3ScF6 in NH4F solutions of various concentrations dosed with varying concentrations of alcohols. The data were obtained for 3 mol/L NH4F solutions dosed with 0.5–9 mol/L of the alcohols methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1,3-propane-diol at 25 °C. The solubility decreases with increased alcohol concentration, and this is correlated to a decrease in the effective dielectric constant of the solvent medium, which promotes ion pairing and subsequent salting out of the solute beyond its saturation limit. The de-solubilizing effect of monohydric alcohols increases with increased alkyl molecular chain length, which is directly linked to the decrease in the dielectric constants of the pure alcohols from methanol to 2-propanol. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in NH4F-1,3-propane-diol solutions is generally intermediate between that in NH4F-ethanol and NH4F-2-propanol solutions. Considering the effect of the higher density of 1,3-propane-diol compared to the monohydric alcohols on the effective dielectric constant of the mixtures, such an intermediate de-solubilizing effect almost comparable to that of NH4F-ethanol mixtures is expected. The solubility of (NH4)3ScF6 in 3 mol/L NH4F-ethanol mixtures was also observed to increase with increasing temperature in the range 10–35 °C. Solubility data of (NH4)3ScF6 are reported for pure aqueous NH4F solutions of concentrations 1 – 12.2 mol/L at 25 °C. The solubility decreases with increased concentration of NH4F. This is attributed to the common ion effect due to increase in the concentration of both NH4 + and F− ions which contribute to the formation of a single solid, (NH4)3ScF6. (NH4)3ScF6 is shown to transform into another solid phase, NH4ScF4, in pure water, and possibly a mixture of several phases, including the postulated phase (NH4)5Sc3F14 as determined by EDS analysis, in NH4F solutions of concentrations ≤ 0.5 mol/L, at 25 °C."
