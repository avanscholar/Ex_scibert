0,Introduction,"As an important organic compound, n-amyl acetate has been widely used in cosmetics, adhesives, dyestuff and other industries [1]. N-amyl acetate is commonly synthesized via the esterification of n-amyl alcohol and acetic acid using sulfuric acid as the catalyst [2]. Although sulfuric acid is a low-cost catalyst with good activity, it has many shortcomings, such as low selectivity, formation of by-products, equipment corrosion and environmental pollution [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop environment-friendly, efficient and reusable catalysts to synthesize n-amyl acetate. Ionic liquids (ILs) are green and emerging solvents and catalysts [4,5] and have been extensively used in many industries [6-8] attributed to their unique physicochemical properties and many advantages such as strong dissolving ability, outstanding thermostability [9], good chemical stability and adjustable pH [10]. Attributed to these intriguing properties, ILs have also been reported in catalysis [11], materials extraction, industrial production such as olefin polymerization [12], alkylation [13], and esterification [14]. In addition to these, ILs have been used as catalyst in the esterification of alcohol and acid with promising catalytic activity and selectivity [15,16]. However, some studies revealed that ILs have certain limitations due to their own characteristics such as costly nature and difficulty in recycling [17]. The fluidity of ILs causes a short contact reaction time between ILs catalysts and reactants in the reaction section of reactive distillation (RD) tower, which can decrease catalytic efficiency. Recently, the application of supported ILs instead of the traditional harmful inorganic acid catalysts has shown great potential in the esterification and transesterification reactions [18,19]. The supported ILs can be conveniently recycled [20] and be packed in RD column [21]. Supported ILs based catalysts can be prepared by physical loading [22], chemical loading [23], sol–gel [24] and polymerization [25] based approaches. Among these, the sol–gel method for immobilizing functionalized ILs on SiO2 solid particles is an efficient and economical approach where the prepared supported ILs catalysts show high stability and activity, particularly for the esterification reactions [26,27]. Reaction kinetics can provide the theoretical basis for the industrial application of catalysts. There are several models used to describe esterification reaction behavior, including the ideal quasi-homogeneous model (IQH), the non-IQH (NIQH) model, Eley-Rideal (ER) model, modified ER (M−ER) model, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Waston (LHHW) model and modified LHHW (M−LHHW) model [28-30]. IQH and NIQH models are commonly applied in the homogeneous esterification kinetics however they can also be used to describe heterogeneous esterification reactions [31]. LHHW and ER models study the influence of adsorption resistance, surface reaction and desorption resistance on reaction rate, and in describing the kinetics of heterogeneous reactions [32,33]. Experimental results exhibited that LHHW model has higher accuracy than ER model in kinetic study of solid–liquid phase esterification reaction [34]. Teo et al. [35] and Pankajakshan et al. [36] proved that LHHW model with dual-site adsorption can describe the reaction kinetics of esterification with higher accuracy than ER model by comparing the experimental data. Cui et. al and Peng et. al. [37,38] showed that IQH model accurately predicts the kinetic behaviors in transesterification using ILs as catalysts. The application conditions of LHHW, IQH and ER models are shown in Table 1 [32]. Hence in this paper, a novel supported IL catalyst ([HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2) was prepared by sol–gel method and the morphology, surface elements, structural stability, pore diameter, specific surface area, thermal stability and distribution of acid strength of the prepared catalyst were characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) analyses and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The immobilization yield of [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 was tested by Soxhlet extraction test, and the degree of corrosion of [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 was evaluated. The reaction kinetics performance of [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 was compared with four types of conventional catalysts i.e. sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, [HSO3-pmim][HSO4] and [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/Silica gel. The effect of stirring rate, catalyst particle size, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration and initial molar ratio of reactants on the kinetic experiments of esterification of acetic acid and n-amyl alcohol catalyzed by [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 were characterized in detail. The stability of [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 and [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/Silica gel was evaluated by analyzing the fresh and recycled catalysts by FT-IR, BET surface properties and EDS analysis. The kinetic equations of esterification of acetic acid with n-amyl alcohol were established through IQH and LHHW models and their accuracy was verified by the experimental data."

3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts The silica gel solid particles were obtained after grinding and sifting by 100 mesh sieve and were soaked in deionized water for 30 min. After ultrasonic cleaning, these particles were dried in oven at 330.15 K for 12 h. EtOH, [HSO3-pmim][HSO4] and silica gel with a mass ratio of 6:1:4 were mixed and stirred for 24 h at 313.15 K followed by stirring and heating at 363.15 K for 2 h to remove the remaining ethanol. [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/Silica gel product was obtained after drying in a vacuum oven at 423.15 K for 24 h. TEOS was used as the silicon source in the preparation of [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2. TEOS, [HSO3-pmim][HSO4], EtOH, HCl and deionized water with mass ratio of 18:4:13:10:7 were weighed. [HSO3-pmim][HSO4] and EtOH was stirred in round-bottom flask at 298.15 K for 1 h. TEOS was drop-wise added to the flask until the solution became clear in a water bath at 333.15 K. Aqueous solution of HCl (60.0 wt%) was dropwise added to the flask and stirred for 1 h at 333.15 K. The colloidal solution was aged for 24 h and was further dried in vacuum oven for 4 h at 393.15 K and finally [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 was obtained. [HSO3-pmim][HSO4], [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/Silica gel and [HSO3-pmim][HSO4]/SiO2 were coded as [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/Sil and [sulfate-p]/SiO2 respectively. The influence of the amount of HCl and TEOS on the immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 was studied. The mass ratio of TEOS to [sulfate-p] in the range of 2.6–6.2 and the mass ratio of HCl to TEOS in a range of 0.25–1.25 were selected."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization FT-IR analysis of [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil was performed on a Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer using KBr pellet method in a wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1. TG-DTG analysis of [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil were performed using Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter TG analyzer at a heating rate of 10 K/min, from 373.15 to 1173.15 K under Nitrogen atmosphere. The surface morphology of [sulfate-p]/SiO2, SiO2, silica gel, [sulfate-p]/Sil was observed by SEM (S-3400 N, Hitachi, Japan) using an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The surface elements of original and five times reused [sulfate-p]/SiO2 were observed by EDS (S-3400 N, Hitachi, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The specific surface area and pore size of [sulfate-p]/SiO2, [sulfate-p]/Sil, silica gel and SiO2 were measured using Micromeritics ASAP 2420–4 equipment. The distribution of acid strength of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p] was measured by NH3-TPD (FINESORB-3010D, FINETEC INSTRUMENTS) in a temperature range of 273.15–773.15 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min."
5,Catalytic activity evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation The immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil was determined by Soxhlet extraction method [39] using the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 . The flask containing acetone as extractant was preheated to 353.15 K. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil samples were wrapped in the filter paper bag before weighing and were packed in the extraction tube. The extraction process lasted for 3 h. The extracted catalysts were dried along-with the filter paper bag in oven at 313.15 K for 3 h and weighed together. The immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil were calculated by Eq. (1) : (1) r L = m IL - m 1 - m 2 m 2 where r L is the immobilization yield of catalyst (wt. %), m IL is the total mass of [sulfate-p] added in the preparation process of catalyst (g), m 1 and m 2 are the total mass of catalyst and filter paper bag before and after extraction process (g), respectively. The corrosion rate of catalysts to the equipment was tested by the corrosiveness experiment[40]. 2.76 g H2SO4, 8.60 g PTSA, 7.55 g [sulfate-p], 21.44 g [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and 31.07 g [sulfate-p]/Sil were mixed with 50.00 g deionized water. The c H + of the obtained mixtures are 1.0 mol/L. The stainless steel 304 blocks of the same size were weighted and put into the mixture liquid at 393.15 K. The corrosion process lasted for 6 h. The corroded stainless steel 304 blocks were washed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 353.15 K for 30 min. The passivation layer on the surface of 304 stainless steel blocks were worn off after each corrosion before weighting. The corrosion rate of catalyst was calculated via Eq. (2) : (2) r C = m 1 S - m 2 S S × t where m 1s and m 2s are the mass of stainless steel 304 blocks before and after corrosion (g) respectively, S is the surface area of stainless steel 304 blocks (m2) and t is the duration of corrosiveness experiment (h). The consecutive experiments were carried out for five times after recycling and separating the catalyst from the reaction products at 333.15 K, catalyst dosage of 1.0 wt% and initial reactants molar ratio of 1.0. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil were selected as catalysts for the esterification of HAc and AmOH. After reaching reaction equilibrium, the reaction liquid mixture was filtered by hot filtration method [41-43] for recycling the solid catalyst particles. In the process of hot filtration, the temperature of the funnel was kept constant at 333.15 K and the reaction solution at 333.15 K and finally obtaining the solid catalyst particles. The recycled particles were washed with deionized water for 3 times and dried in oven at 353.15 K for 1 h. The mass of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 recovered five times by hot filtration method was recorded. The five times reused catalysts were tested by FT-IR, BET surface properties and EDS techniques to test the stability of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil[44,45]. The specific surface area and pore size, FT-IR and EDS analyses of fresh and five times reused [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil were performed using Micromeritics ASAP 2420–4 equipment, Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer and (S-3400 N, Hitachi, Japan) instruments respectively."
6,Kinetics experimental procedures,"2.5 Kinetics experimental procedures All kinetics experiments were conducted in a four-necked flask with an agitator as shown in Fig. 2 . The temperature of the mixture was kept constant by glycerol bath. The condenser was used to promote condensation reflux of the volatile compounds. HAc and catalyst were preheated in the reactor vessel and AmOH was preheated in a separate vessel. When the reaction temperature was reached, AmOH was poured into the reactor vessel at initial time. The stirring was immediately started and the time was noted. Liquid samples (0.2 mL) were taken out with a syringe at regular intervals and cooled rapidly to 268.15 K in order to avoid any further reaction[46,47]. The effect of catalyst type, stirring rate, catalyst particle size, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration and initial molar ratio of reactants on reaction rate and conversion of HAc was investigated. All the samples were analyzed by acid-base titration (using 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution as titrant and phenolphthalein as indicator). 0.1 mL phenolphthalein solution was added to the sample, and was titrated with NaOH solution, from which the volume of NaOH solution consumed was recorded. The conversion of HAc “X” can be expressed by Eq. (3) : (3) X = n HAc 0 - n HAc t n HAc 0 where n HAc represents the total number of moles of hydrogen proton in the solution at initial time and testing time point as the upper corner mark is “0″ and “t” (mol), respectively. In the catalytic esterification reaction system, the total number of moles of hydrogen proton ( n H + ) in the solution is equal to the sum of the number of moles of hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p] and the number of moles of hydrogen proton provided by HAc. The number of moles of the hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p] is assumed constant during the esterification process of HAc and AmOH. Thus, Eq. (4) is obtained by substituting “ n H + = n ILs + n HAc ” into Eq. (3) . (4) X = n H + 0 - n H + t n HAc 0 n ILs + n HAc 0 n H + 0 where n H + represents the total number of moles of hydrogen proton in the solution at initial time and testing time point as the upper corner mark is “0″ and “t” (mol), respectively. n ILs is the number of moles of hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p]. Since the samples in this experiment were taken out from the upper solution, and [sulfate-p] is mostly located at the bottom of the reactor, it can be assumed that there is no hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p] in the sample. According to the calculation of acid-base equilibrium in titration, the total number of moles of hydrogen proton in the reaction solution n H + can be expressed as Eq. (5) : (5) n H + = c NaOH V M m where n H + represents the total moles of hydrogen proton in the reaction solution (mol). c NaOH is the molar concentration of NaOH in the titrating solution (mol/L). V is the volume of titrating solution consumed to titrate the sample (L). m is the mass of the sample (g). M is the total mass of reaction solution (g). By substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (4) , “X” can be calculated by Eq. (6) . (6) X = V 0 m Total 0 m 0 - V t m Total t m t m HAc M HAc m ILs M ILs + m HAc M HAc × V 0 m Total 0 m 0 where V 0 and V t are the volume of titrating solution consumed to titrate the sample at initial time and testing time point (L), respectively. m 0 and m t are the sample mass at initial time and testing time point (g), respectively. m Total 0 and m Total t are the total masses of reaction solution at initial time and testing time point (g), respectively. m HAc is the mass of HAc at initial time (g). m ILs is the mass of [sulfate-p] at initial time (g). M HAc is the molar mass of HAc, while M ILs is the molar mass of [sulfate-p].”"
7,"Reaction kinetics, mechanism and modeling studies","2.6 Reaction kinetics, mechanism and modeling studies In this work, IQH and LHHW models were applied to simulate the reaction kinetics of esterification of HAc and AmOH. The reaction mechanism based on IQH model is shown in Fig. 3 . When the reaction mixture was considered as ideal solution, the esterification reaction consisted of three steps. In the first step, the carbonyl group combines with a proton to form a carbonium ion. In the second step, the acyl cation was formed by nucleophilic substitution reaction between carbon ions and AmOH. In the third step, the AmAc and H2O were produced by acyl cation breaking. In the first and third step, the proton transfer process occurs very fast, which can be approximately considered as a state of equilibrium. The second step with slower reaction rate is considered as the rate controlling step. The reaction mechanism can be simplified as a second-order reversible reaction[17]. The reaction kinetics equation in IQH model can be expressed as follows[48]: (7) r IQH = k + IQH c AmOH c HAc c 1H + - k - IQH c AmAc c Water c 1H + Where (8) c i = n v · x i According to the stoichiometric relation, x i can be expressed as: (9) x HAc = Z 1 - X HAc x AmOH = ( 1 - Z ) - Z X HAc x AmAc = Z X HAc x Water = Z X HAc Z = n HAc n Where n is the total moles of initial reactants (mol), n HAc is the total moles of initial HAc (mol), and X HAc is the conversion of HAc (%). According to IQH model, the catalytic effect mainly comes from the hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and HAc. The parameter c 1H + can be expressed by a corrected item as shown in Eq. (10) [49]. (10) c 1H + = a + b c cat p where c cat is the molar concentration of catalyst (mol∙L-1), a and b are constants and p is the power of c cat. a represents the autocatalytic effect of protons from the self-decomposition of HAc. The kinetic equation based on IQH model (Eq. (7) ) can be written as: (11) r IQH = a + b c cat c n v 2 k + IQH x AmOH x HAc - k - IQH x AmAc x Water Where (12) k + IQH = k 1 IQH exp - E 1 IQH / RT (13) k - IQH = k 2 IQH exp - E 2 IQH / RT where r is the reaction rate (mol∙L-1∙min−1), c i is the concentration of component i (mol∙L-1), n is the total number of moles of the reaction solutions, v is the total volume of the reaction solutions (L), k + and k - are the forward and reverse reaction rate constants respectively (mol−1∙L∙min−1), x i is the mole fraction of i, R is the gas constant and T is temperature (K), k 1 IQH (mol−1·L·min−1) and k 2 IQH (L∙mol−1∙min−1) are the pre-exponential factors and E IQH represents activation energy (J∙mol−1). When the esterification reaction is regarded as heterogeneous system, the LHHW model based on a dual site mechanism is used to describe the kinetics of esterification of HAc and AmOH which includes multiple stages as shown in Fig. 4 . In the first step, both reactants n-amyl alcohol and HAc are diffused from the bulk liquid phase to the external surface of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and are absorbed by the active vacant sites (S). In the second step, the adsorbed HAc and AmOH at the catalyst surface react with each other to form the products in the active vacant sites on the catalyst surface. In addition, the sulfonic acid functional group in [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has low affinity for HAc so that the proton provided by [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is the main factor to promote the forward reaction on the catalyst surface[32].In the third step, the products are desorbed from the catalyst surface and diffuse to the bulk liquid phase. The following assumptions were made to derive the simplified rate expression: The resistance offered by mass transfer (internal and external) and internal heat transfer was found to be negligible. The adsorption and desorption steps were assumed as fast processes and these two processes were in equilibrium. The surface reaction process is assumed to be the rate-controlling step under isothermal conditions[34]. The reaction kinetics equation in LHHW model can be expressed as follows[32]: (14) r LHHW = k + LHHW c HAc · S c AmOH · S c 2H + - k - LHHW c AmAc · S c Water · S c 2H + Where (15) c i · s = K i c i c s (16) r LHHW = ( k + LHHW K AmOH c AmOH K HAc c HAc c 2H + - k - LHHW K AmAc c AmAc K Water c Water c 2H + ) c S 2 where c i·s is the concentration of reactant i in active vacant sites of catalyst (mol∙L-1), K i is the equilibrium constant for adsorption of reactant i on catalyst active site (mol−1∙L∙min−1) and c s is the concentration of active vacant sites on the catalyst (mol∙g−1). For the strong affinity of the sulfonic acid functional group in [sulfate-p]/SiO2 for water and n-amyl alcohol, the hydrogen proton provided by [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is the main driving force for the forward reaction. The relationship between concentration of active vacant sites on the catalyst (c S) and concentration of total vacant sites on the catalyst (c TS) can be expressed as Eq. (17) . c H + can be expressed by corrected item, which is shown in Eq. (18) [50]. (17) c TS = c S + K AmOH c AmOH c S + K Water c Water c S (18) c 2 H + = q c cat α Where (19) k - LHHW = k + LHHW K AmOH c AmOH Eq K HAc c HAc Eq K AmAc c AmAc Eq K Water c Water Eq where c i Eq is the equilibrium concentration of component i (mol∙L-1). In order to grouping the parameters in Eq. (16) , k 1 LHHW’ and k 2 LHHW’ are defined as: (20) k + LHHW1 = k + LHHW K AmOH K HAc c TS 2 (21) k - LHHW1 = k + LHHW c AmOH Eq c HAc Eq c AmAc Eq c Water Eq = k + LHHW K AmOH c AmOH K HAc c HAc c TS 2 c AmOH Eq c HAc Eq c AmAc Eq c Water Eq Eq. (22) can be obtained by combining Eq. (16) , (17) , (18) , (19) , (20) and (21) . (22) r LHHW = β c cat α n v 2 k + LHHW1 x AmOH x HAc - k - LHHW1 x AmAc x Water 1 + n v K AmOH x AmOH + n v K Water x Water 2 Where (23) k + LHHW1 = k 1 LHHW exp - E 1 LHHW / R T (24) k - LHHW1 = k 2 LHHW exp - E 2 LHHW / R T (25) K AmOH = K AmOH0 exp - Δ H AmOH0 / R T (26) K Water = K Water0 exp - Δ H Water0 / R T where, k + and k - are the reaction rate constant (mol−1∙L∙min−1), K i is the adsorption equilibrium constant of component i (mol−1∙L∙min−1), q is constant and α is the power of c cat, k LHHW represents pre-exponential factors (L∙mol−1∙min−1), E LHHW shows activation energy (J∙mol−1), K i is the adsorption equilibrium constant of component i (mol−1∙L∙min−1), K i0 is the pre exponential factor (L∙mol−1) and ΔH i is the standard enthalpy of formation of component i (K). The kinetic equations based on IQH model (Eq. (11) ) and LHHW model (Eq. (22) ) are differential equations, which can be solved by fourth order to fifth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. The parameters are obtained by fitting and regress to the kinetic experimental data. The fitting method for the kinetic parameters in IQH model and LHHW model is shown in Fig. 5 . The mean absolute square error (MASE) values as the objective function in the fitting process of kinetic parameters are shown in Eq. (27) . (27) MASE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N X HAc,cal - X HAc,exp 2 where N is the number of test points, including all points in the experimental kinetics test with temperature, catalyst dosage and initial acid alcohol mole ratio as variables, X HAc,cal is the calculated value of HAc conversion (%), and X HAc,exp is the experimental value of HAc conversion (%)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst immobilization yield,"3.1 Catalyst immobilization yield Fig. 6 shows the influence of TEOS dosage and HCl dosage on the immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. The optimum conditions for the synthesis of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 are m TEOS /m IL = 4.4 (Fig. 6 a) and m HCl /m TEOS = 0.50 (Fig. 6 b) under which the immobilization yield reached 35.01 wt%. In the process of synthesizing [sulfate-p]/SiO2, HCl promotes the hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS to produce solid support SiO2. The immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 gradually increased in the range of m TEOS /m IL of 2.6 to 4.4 which is due to the enhanced generation of SiO2 and [sulfate-p] can be immobilized completely. In the range of m TEOS /m IL of 4.4 to 6.2, the immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is reduced. The large amount of SiO2 results in a decrease in the amount of [sulfate-p] immobilized on the same mass of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. The immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 kept increasing in the range of m HCl/m TEOS of 0.25–0.50, which is attributed to the production of more SiO2 with increasing HCl dosage. The rapid formation of SiO2 results in the incomplete immobilization of [sulfate-p] when m HCl /m TEOS is in the range of 0.50–1.25."
10,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization Table 2 shows that SiO2 and silica gel are both supports with high specific surface area and large pore diameter. A sharp decrease in specific surface area was observed for [sulfate-p]/SiO2 (from 600.53 to 66.35 m2/g) and [sulfate-p]/Sil (from 640.66 to 280.04 m2/g). In addition, the average pore diameters of SiO2 and silica gel increases as the micropore is blocked off by [sulfate-p]. This suggests that [sulfate-p] may be well confined in the micropores of SiO2 and silica gel. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has smaller specific surface area and larger average pore diameter than [sulfate-p]/Sil, which shows that [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has higher immobilization yield than [sulfate-p]-Sil. The morphology of SiO2, [sulfate-p]/SiO2, silica gel and [sulfate-p]/Sil in Fig. 7 suggests that the surface structure of SiO2 (Fig. 7 a) and silica gel (Fig. 7 d) remained unchanged before and after immobilization, indicating their good structural stability. The surface of SiO2 is relatively smooth, while there are dense [sulfate-p] liquid particles on the surface (Fig. 7 b) and cross section (Fig. 7 c) of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. There is a liquid phase reaction step in the synthesis of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. [sulfate-p]-EtOH solution was dispersed uniformly in the gel system under high speed stirring condition. With the formation of SiO2 and the evaporation of EtOH, the [sulfate-p] existed in the form of particles and hence was filled in the dried SiO2. In the process of preparing [sulfate-p]/Sil, the surface of silica gel was covered with a layer of [sulfate-p] (Fig. 7 e) without any prominent change in its cross sectional morphology (Fig. 7 f). [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has higher fixation fastness and immobilization yield than [sulfate-p]/Sil. Fig. 7 g is the EDS spectrum of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 which suggest a mass ratio of N, O, Si and S of 7.61%, 53.54%, 22.68%, 16.16%, respectively. The distribution of surface elements proves the existence of [sulfate-p] particles on the surface of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. Fig. 7 h shows the EDS spectrum of five times reused [sulfate-p]/SiO2 which indicate a mass ratio of N, O, Si and S of 6.04%, 60.15%, 23.54%, 10.27%, respectively, which suggested a slight decrease in the content of [sulfate-p] on the surface of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 after being reused for five times. The TG-DTG analysis was carried out to investigate the thermal stability of [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . There is only one mass loss of 80.02% in the TG curve of [sulfate-p] (Fig. 8 a) which corresponds to the decomposition of [sulfate-p] at 618.15 K. In the TG curve of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 (Fig. 8 b), an initial mass loss of 8.42% at 381.15 K and a significant mass loss of 30.32% can be detected at a temperature of 654.15 K. There are two mass losses of 4.65% and 17.08% in the TG curve of [sulfate-p]/Sil (Fig. 8 c) at 370.15 K and 659.15 K, respectively. For [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil which were ascribed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water and due to the [sulfate-p] decomposition, respectively. The thermal stability of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil are both improved in the process of immobilization. The FT-IR spectra of [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil are shown in Fig. 9 . The absorption peaks at 3160 cm−1, 2977 cm−1, and 1469 cm−1 are associated with the stretching and bending vibration of imidazole ring and C–H on the side chain. The characteristic peaks of C = C and C = N on imidazole ring are observed at 1636 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1 respectively while the absorption peak of inorganic anion HSO4 - is observed at 1173 cm−1 [18].The typical absorption peak at 1080 cm−1 corresponds to the characteristic absorption band of Si-O-Si. The skeleton vibration peaks of silica gel are observed at 794 cm−1 and 951 cm−1 [51]. When [sulfate-p] was immobilized on SiO2 and silica gel, similar intensified peaks can also be observed, indicating the interactions of IL with support. The immobilization of [sulfate-p] on the support was assumed to have occurred via physical adsorption without any true chemical bond formation. Fig. 10 shows the distribution of acid strength of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p], which indicate that [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has two NH3 desorption peaks which appeared at 508.15–581.15 K and 613.15–746.15 K. [sulfate-p] has one NH3 desorption peak which appears at 592.15–721.15 K[52]. The NH3 desorption peak area of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is larger than that of [sulfate-p] and the distribution of acid strength of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is higher than that of [sulfate-p]."
11,Catalytic activity evaluation,"3.3 Catalytic activity evaluation The immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil is shown in Table 3 , which indicates that [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has higher immobilization yield than [sulfate-p]/Sil. The main reason is the difference between the adsorption mechanism of the carrier to IL in sol–gel method and physical method. The immobilization mechanism of physical method is physical adsorption of [sulfate-p] by silica gel, while that of sol–gel method is the encapsulation of [sulfate-p] by SiO2 [51], which could have contributed to the enhanced immobilization yield and fixation fastness of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. Table 4 shows the corrosion rate of H2SO4, [sulfate-p], [sulfate-p]/SiO2, [sulfate-p]/Sil and PTSA for stainless steel blocks under the same corrosion conditions. The corrosion rates of various catalysts followed an order of: H2SO4 > PTSA > [sulfate-p] > [sulfate-p]/Sil > [sulfate-p]/SiO2. These findings could be attributed to the contact of reactants in the active vacant sites of [sulfate-p]/Sil and [sulfate-p]/SiO2, which effectively reduce the corrosion of H+ in the reaction mixture to the equipment. Importantly, [sulfate-p]/SiO2 as catalyst can solve the problem of equipment corrosion in the process of AmAc synthesis by esterification of HAc and AmOH. Table 5 shows the mass of recovered [sulfate-p]/SiO2 for five times of consecutive experiments, which indicate that the mass of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is reduced by 10.8% after five times of continuous recycling by hot filtration method. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has good stability under the condition of hot filtration recovery. Table 6 shows the changes in surface properties of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil after five times of consecutive experiments. After being reused for five times, the specific surface area of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil increased from 66.35 to 100.33 m2/g and from 280.04 to 518.77 m2/g respectively, while the average pore diameter decreased slightly. These findings suggest that there is a loss of IL in [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and [sulfate-p]/Sil after five times reuse. Fig. 11 compiles the FT-IR spectra of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 and five times reused [sulfate-p]/SiO2 which indicate that the absorption peaks at 3160 cm−1, 2977 cm−1, and 1469 cm−1 are associated with the stretching and bending vibration of imidazole ring and C–H on the side chain, while the characteristic peaks of C = C and C = N on imidazole ring were observed at 1636 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1 and the absorption peak of inorganic anion HSO4 - was observed at 1173 cm−1 [18]. The typical absorption peak of [sulfate-p] did not change, which proves that the composition of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 does not change after five times of reuses. These findings suggest that after being reused for five times, the content of [sulfate-p] on the surface of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 decreased slightly indicating good stability of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 during the reaction."
12,Kinetic experiments,"3.4 Kinetic experiments Fig. 12 shows the comparison of the reaction kinetic performances of different catalysts under the same reaction conditions. The hydrogen ion concentration ( c H + ) provided by catalyst is 0.0562 mol/L while the catalytic activity (reaction rate of HAc) of catalysts followed an order of: [sulfate-p]/SiO2 > [sulfate-p]/Sil > H2SO4 > [sulfate-p] > PTSA. The high catalytic activity of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 could be endorsed to four reasons. Firstly, [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has higher distribution of acid strength than [sulfate-p]. Then, the open columnar pore structure on the surface of SiO2 not only improves the specific surface area of [sulfate-p]/SiO2, but also facilitates the entry of [sulfate-p], which improves the immobilization yield of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. Thirdly, [sulfate-p]/SiO2 with good thermal and structural stability can ensures its structural integrity and inhibits the loss of [sulfate-p] under the reaction conditions of high temperature and high stirring speed[51]. Finally, most importantly, the specific surface area of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 was increased in the process of immobilization due to the porous nature and large pore size of SiO2, the large specific surface area can provide large number of active vacant sites on the inner surface of [sulfate-p]/SiO2, which can increase the number of effective collisions between the reactants and catalyst which can ultimately accelerate the esterification reaction. Based on these findings, follow-up experiments were carried out using [sulfate-p]/SiO2 as catalyst. Fig. 13 shows the effect of stirring speed and catalyst particle size on the conversion of HAc in the range of 510–935 rpm (Fig. 13 a) and 100 to 300 mesh (Fig. 13 b), respectively. Since the variation of stirring speed has no significant effect on the reaction rate and conversion of HAc, the external mass transfer resistance can be considered negligible and hence can ignored. It can be assumed that internal mass transfer resistances are negligible for the conversion of HAc remained unaffected by the stirring speed. As a consequence, the stirring speed of 680 rpm and catalyst particle size of 200 mesh were used for further experiments. The effect of reaction temperature on the reaction rate of HAc in the range of 333.15 K to 413.15 K is displayed in Fig. 14 . The increment of temperature is apparently favorable to accelerate the esterification reaction in the range of 313.15–373.15 K. With further increase of temperature, the reaction rate of HAc changes slightly. The effective number of collisions of molecules are greatly increased with increasing temperature, which accelerates the reaction rate. The equilibrium conversions of HAc are slightly dependent on the temperature because the enthalpy of the esterification of HAc with AmOH is small[17]. From these results, 373.15 K was chosen as the optimum reaction temperature for further experiments. Fig. 15 shows the effect of initial molar ratio of HAc to AmOH on the conversion of HAc in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 which suggests that the equilibrium conversion of HAc decreased with increasing molar ratio of HAc to AmOH, and no significant increase was observed at the initial reactant molar ratio of less than 1.0. As esterification is an equilibrium-limited chemical reaction, hence an increase in AmOH concentration would lead to a corresponding increase in the conversion of HAc. The molar ratio of HAc to AmOH of 1.0 was chosen for further experiments. Fig. 16 shows the effect of catalyst dosage on the conversion of HAc in the range of 0.0–3.0 wt%. Compared with the blank experiment, the conversion of HAc increased by 47.81% after adding [sulfate-p]/SiO2 as catalyst in the esterification of HAc and AmOH, this phenomenon shows that the autocatalytic contribution of HAc is significantly weak, and the catalytic effect of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 was the main reason in promoting the forward reaction. These experiments further proved the high catalytic activity of [sulfate-p]/SiO2. The conversion of HAc increased significantly in the range of 0.75–1.0 wt% while increased slightly with further increase in catalyst dosage. This is attributed to the existence of a large number of catalytic active sites at higher catalyst concentration results in greater number of molecular level effective interactions with the reactants[53,54] and hence leads to higher conversion of HAc. From these results, a catalyst concentration of 1.0 wt% was chosen for onward experiments."
13,Kinetic modeling,"3.5 Kinetic modeling The relationship between the initial reaction rate r 0 and the catalyst concentration c cat was studied to obtain the proton correction terms (c H +) of hydrogen proton concentration in IQH model (c 1H +) and LHHW model (c 2H +). The kinetic equation based on IQH model and LHHW model can be expressed as Eq. (28) and Eq. (30) . (28) r IQH = c 1 H + n v 2 k + IQH x AmOH x HAc - k - IQH x AmAc x Water In which (29) c 1H + = 0.00254 + c cat where a = 0.00254 represents the autocatalytic effect of protons in the initial dissociation of HAc. (30) r LHHW = c 2H + n v 2 k + LHHW1 x AmOH x HAc - k - LHHW1 x AmAc x Water 1 + n v K AmOH x AmOH + n v K Water x Water 2 In which (31) c 2H + = 11.25601 c cat 0.71404 Where the proton provided by [sulfate-p]/SiO2 is the main driving force for the forward reaction. c cat (mol∙L-1) is the molar concentration of catalyst, while the values of constant q is 11.25601 and the power of c cat α is 0.71404. The kinetic parameters were obtained through the fitting process shown in Fig. 5 and the calculation results are shown in Table 7 . In IQH model, E 1 and E 2 are the intrinsic activation energies of forward and reverse reaction (J∙mol−1), respectively. In Table 7, E 1 is lower than E 2 , indicating that the energy barrier of forward reaction is lower than that of reverse reaction at a given temperature. The reverse reaction process has higher activation energy and is more sensitive to temperature compared to the forward reaction. At a temperature of more than 373.15 K, the reaction rate and conversion of HAc increased slightly with increasing temperature as Fig. 14. According to LHHW model, the adsorption and desorption steps were assumed as fast processes and were in equilibrium. The reaction process on vacant sites is assumed to be the rate-controlling step under isothermal conditions. Therefore, E 1 and E 2 are considered as the intrinsic activation energy of forward and reverse reaction on vacant sites (J∙mol−1), respectively. “ n K AmOH x AmOH / v ” represents the adsorption resistance term, “ n K Water x Water / v ” represents the desorption resistance term. The desorption resistance is the main part of the total mass transfer resistance. The MASE data in Table 7 reveal that LHHW model has higher accuracy than IQH model in describing the esterification kinetics of HAc and AmOH catalyzed by [sulfate-p]/SiO2. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 has strong adsorption affinity for the reactants and the esterification reaction follows solid–liquid heterogeneous reaction mechanism[32]. LHHW model considering the influence of adsorption and desorption resistance on kinetic parameters can better describe the kinetics of solid–liquid phase esterification. Fig. 17 shows the comparison of kinetic equations and experimental data in a temperature range of 353.15–413.15 K, which suggests a better fit of experimental data with simulated data at higher temperature than at lower temperature (Fig. 17 (a-d)). In the presumptions of IQH and LHHW models, the influence of internal and external mass transfer resistance is neglected. The assumption may result in a slightly higher predicted data than the experimental data before the reaction reaches equilibrium. The measured conversion at lower temperature (especially at 353.15 K) in initial period is relatively low. The dispersity of the experimental kinetic data will lead to poor fitting effect to the model. Meanwhile, the minor fluctuations may also be related to other experimental errors such as the possible side reactions (condensation reaction of AmOH)[55] and some analytical errors in titration. The kinetic equation based on LHHW model has higher accuracy than the kinetic equation based on IQH model. With increasing temperature, the effective collisions of reactants on the active vacant sites of solid catalyst also increase, which increased the rate of esterification reaction. Fig. 18 shows the comparisons of IQH and LHHW models and experimental data in the range of initial reactant molar ratio of 0.67–2.0 which suggest good agreement between the experimental data and simulation data from the two models (Fig. 18 (a-d)). Comparatively, the kinetic equation based on LHHW model has higher accuracy at reaction equilibrium of esterification of HAc and AmOH. Fig. 19 indicate good agreement between the experimental data obtained at variable catalyst dosage (0.75–3.0 wt%) and those simulated from the two models (Fig. 19 (a-d)). The experimental data and simulation data have better fit in the initial stage of reaction than at equilibrium. This is because the kinetic models established in this study mainly considered the influence of catalyst dosage on the initial reaction rate. In reaction equilibrium stage, the kinetic equation based on LHHW model can better fit with the experimental data. The concentration of active vacant sites increased with increasing catalyst dosage, which leads to greater extent of esterification of HAc and AmOH."
14,Conclusions,"In this work, a novel catalyst [sulfate-p]/SiO2 was prepared by sol–gel method. Compared to conventional catalysts like PTSA, H2SO4, [sulfate-p] and [sulfate-p]/Sil, [sulfate-p]/SiO2 exhibited better reaction kinetic performances in the esterification of HAc with AmOH. The structural stability, thermal stability and corrosion resistance of [sulfate-p]/SiO2 were significantly higher than those of [sulfate-p]. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 as catalyst greatly improved the convenience of experimental operation. [sulfate-p]/SiO2 can be separated from the reaction mixture by simple hot filtration method and has excellent recycling performance. IQH and LHHW models were modified with an additional corrected item about proton concentration and were used to describe the kinetics of the esterification of HAc and AmOH. The simulation data of the conversion of HAc based on LHHW model and IQH model fitted well with the experimental data while LHHW model showed higher accuracy than IQH model in describing the kinetics of esterification of HAc with AmOH catalyzed by [sulfate-p]/SiO2. This study provides useful data and findings for the industrial level preparation of n-amyl acetate using a novel, cost-effective and environment friendly catalyst."
