0,Introduction,"The photoreduction of CO2 (with in-situ water photo-oxidation) by utilizing solar energy is an emerging carbon–neutral route to convert CO2 as a feedstock into fuels and value-added chemicals [1–9]. TiO2-based catalysts are still largely used for photoreduction of CO2 [10–20], and the use of titania nanotubes (1D-type nanostructure) generally improves light harvesting and photocatalytic performances [21,22]. These titania-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction are typically promoted by adding cocatalysts or elements to enhance visible-light activity. CO or CH4 are the products of photoreduction, with only traces of other products, e.g. hydrocarbons or oxygenates. We earlier observed, however, that in a similar reaction (electrocatalytic rather than photocatalytic reduction of CO2) the reactor configuration (i.e. allowing operations without the electrolyte in contact with the catalyst) can change considerably the type of products. The observation was interpreted as due to the different surface concentration of CO2-derived adspecies, which promotes reactions with C–C bond formation [23]. While the mechanism of reaction of CO2 photoreduction is still matter of discussion [24–34], and whether and in which conditions heavier products than CO and CH4 can be obtained in a significant amount during photoreduction as observed for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 [35–41], a fundamental question is to proof the feasibility to form these > C1 products by changing the way of operation of the photocatalyst. Understanding this question is relevant both from application and fundamental perspectives. For example, acetic acid has a market value 3–4 times higher than CO or CH4, and its direct synthesis from CO2 greatly reduces the number of process steps and energy intensity with respect to the actual process starting from fossil fuels [39]. Four H2 molecules are necessary to convert CO2 to one molecule of CH4 or CH3COOH, and thus cost of production is essentially analogous, but the current production price of acetic acid is about three times higher. Although these economic considerations are quite simplified, they remark that production of > C1 molecules from CO2 photoreduction is potentially attractive. From the scientific perspective, formation of acetic acid or other light carboxylic acid is relevant in terms of reaction mechanism and understanding of possible deactivation processes. Aim of this study is to present the concept and demonstrate feasibility of a novel type of photoreactor for the conversion of CO2 based on flow-through photoactive nanomembranes. These membranes are constituted by ordered arrays of aligned TiO2 nanotubes grown over a microperforated metallic substrate (the latter acting as an electron collector and to provide the necessary robustness), which are then functionalized by copper oxide (Cu2O or CuO) electrodeposition. The resulting flow-through photocatalytic nanomembrane is an integral part of the whole photoreactor. There is a conceptual relevant difference between this novel type of photoreactor and the conventional photocatalytic reactors using a thin supported film of a semiconductor (operating in liquid or gas phase) or the photo-electro-catalytic (PEC) devices for CO2 conversion. The latter operate typically in the presence of an electrolyte and use a proton-conductive membrane, while in our case operations are in gas-phase and the CO2 flow (saturated with H2O) passes through the photoactive nanomembrane. In photocatalytic gas-phase approaches, instead, the CO2 + H2O flow is in contact with the semiconductor but does not pass through it. Only one side is illuminated, as in PEC reactors. With respect to conventional photocatalysis operating in the presence of a liquid (such as CO2-saturated water), this new approach shows many advantages: i) no limitations in CO2 concentration exist at the catalyst surface, due to solubility and diffusion through the double layer and ii) competitive chemisorption of water is largely reduced. All these aspects lead to a great difference in terms of types of products for the novel approach proposed with respect to conventional PEC or photocatalytic approaches. A comparison of some different copper-based semiconductors is also reported to evidence the influence of the nature of the electrodes on their catalytic performances. Particularly, the behavior of Cu2O (acting itself as a semiconductor) deposited over the bare microperforated metallic substrate (Ti or Cu) is also presented. Although the combination of two or more semiconductors to enhance the photocatalytic performance is a well-known methodology in the field of photocatalysis, the development of a titania nanomembrane grown on a microperforated substrate (to allow a water-saturated CO2 flow to pass through it) with electrodeposited copper on it, coupled with a compact-design reactor working in gas-phase (to control the local adsorption of H2O on the active sites in competition with CO2) at low residence time (i.e. working in laminar flow regime) at a very low temperature (close to r. t.), allowed to obtain very different performances (like the formation of C2-C3 products) with respect to similar photocatalysts processed in conventional batch photocatalytic reactors. Copper (Cu2O, CuO) electrodeposition is used to promote visible-light activity. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has recently received much attention for its suitable bandgap (around 2 eV) for solar energy application [42,43]. Typically, it shows p-type characteristics due to copper ion vacancies and can accept and accumulate electrons generated from visible light absorption, revealing Cu2O as a qualified photocatalyst for the multi-electron process of CO2 reduction [43]. As Cu2O shows a lower band gap than TiO2, it can promote visible-light activity of the latter. Furthermore, being a p-type semiconductor with respect to titania (which is a n-type semiconductor), deposition of Cu2O nanocrystals creates heterojunctions that could be relevant in promoting photoreduction [31,44–46]. The use of ordered TiO2 NTs prepared by controlled anodic oxidation technique could further improve these properties [47,48]. Cu2O/TiO2 NTs photocatalysts with p-n heterojunction are thus attracting photocatalysts to investigate [49,50]. Scope of this manuscript is to demonstrate the use of this novel photoreactor concept and how it has a large impact on the types of products obtained."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals High-purity commercial chemicals were used. Copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) were supplied by Carlo Erba, while L-(+)-lactic acid solution (C3H6O3, 87,5%), copper(II) acetate monohydrate (C4H6CuO4·H2O, 98%), sodium acetate (CH3COONa, 99%), acetic acid solution (CH3COOH, 99.7%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 98%), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4, 99%), NaOH (pellets) and TiO2 Degussa P25 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Titanium (Ti) discs (0.025 mm thickness, 35 mm diameter, 99.96% purity) were provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Copper (Cu) foils (0.025 mm thick, 99.999% purity) were supplied from Sigma Aldrich. The metallic discs (Ti and Cu) were previously cleaned by sonication with isopropanol for 30 min, and then oven dried at 100 °C."
3,p-type Cu2O deposition on metallic substrates,"2.2 p-type Cu2O deposition on metallic substrates p-type cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was deposited on a conductive substrate by electrodeposition technique, using an electrochemical cell with three-electrode setup. The working electrode was a pure Ti (or Cu) thin disc (0.025 mm thickness, 35 mm diameter) and the counter electrode was a Pt rod (having a comparable area with respect to the working electrode), while a 3 M KCl Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference. The procedure of synthesis was adapted from Hsu et al. [51]. In detail, a solution based on CuSO4·5H2O (0.1 M) and lactic acid (0.75 M) was used as the electrolyte, adjusting the pH to 9 with a few drops of a 5 M NaOH solution and stirring for 5 h to stabilize the solution and let the temperature drop. During the deposition, temperature was maintained at 60° C. The reaction involved is the following: (1) C u 2 + + e - → C u + A basic electrolyte (pH > 7) favours the precipitation of Cu+ over the electrode, according to the following reaction: (2) 2 C u + + 2 O H - → C u 2 O + 2 H 2 O A preliminary linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from 0 to −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (see Fig. 1 a) was carried out for the selection of the potential set value for Cu electrodeposition, in order to obtain a selective deposition of only Cu2O avoiding the full reduction to metallic Cu. A set value of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.34 V vs. RHE) was finally chosen and used for Cu deposition on Ti (sample name: Cu2O/Ti p-type) and Cu (sample name: Cu2O/Cu p-type). The electrodeposition time determined the final Cu loading on the substrate. A potentiostat/galvanostat (Amel 2049) was used to apply the voltage."
4,n-type Cu2O deposition on metallic substrates,"2.3 n-type Cu2O deposition on metallic substrates n-type cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was deposited on metallic Ti (and Cu) by using the same set-up described in the previous section and adapting the procedure reported by Wang et al. [52]. An aqueous solution of sodium acetate (0.08 M) and copper acetate (0.02 M) was used as the electrolyte, adjusting the pH to 5 using a few drops of concentrate acetic acid. The sample (sample name: Cu2O/Ti n-typeA) was prepared by applying −0.02 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.49 V vs. RHE) for 30 min at 60 °C. The set potential value was chosen by evaluating the preliminary LSV analysis reported in Fig. 1b. Even in this case, the set potential was chosen in order to avoid the full reduction to metallic Cu, also due to hydrogen evolution process in such a proton rich environment, as described by the following reaction: (3) C u 2 O + 2 e - + 2 H + → 2 C u + H 2 O"
5,Cu2O to CuO transformation,"2.4 Cu2O to CuO transformation An analogue sample prepared as described in section 2.3 (Cu2O/Ti n-typeA) was annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to change into CuO phase (sample name: CuO/Ti p-type), also evidenced by a colour change from violet to grey, while annealing at a lower temperature (250 °C) for the same time led to the formation of a sample named Cu2O/Ti n-typeB, whose characteristics will be described below. By annealing, more oxygen is incorporated in the structure as described by the following reaction: (4) C u 2 O + 1 / 2 O 2 → C u O"
6,TiO2 NTs preparation and Cu2O deposition,"2.5 TiO2 NTs preparation and Cu2O deposition Titanium nanotube arrays (TiO2NTs) were synthesized by a controlled anodic oxidation process, starting from a Ti disc (0.025 mm thickness, 35 mm diameter) and using an electrolyte based on 2 wt% H2O and 0.33 wt% NH4F in ethylene glycol, under the application of a constant voltage (50 V) for 45 min [47,53]. After the anodization, the TiO2NTs were calcinated at 450 °C (reached by 2 °C min−1 ramp) for 3 h and then sonicated with HCl for about 30 s to clean the surface from debris [54]. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) in p-type form was electrodeposited onto TiO2NTs using the same procedure and electrolyte described in section 2.2 for Cu2O/Ti p-type. This sample will be named hereafter as Cu2O/TiO2NTs p-n."
7,Preparation of TiO2 Degussa P25 film on Ti,"2.6 Preparation of TiO2 Degussa P25 film on Ti In order to obtain a thin film of TiO2 Degussa P25 on Ti to be used as a reference photocatalytic material, a paste was prepared by mixing 1 g of commercial TiO2 Degussa P25 with 10 mL of a solution consisting of water (H2O, 51 wt%), absolute ethanol (EtOH, 47 wt%) and polyethylene glycol (PEG 2000, 2 wt%). The paste was then deposited on metallic Ti substrate by doctor-blade technique. After deposition, the TiO2 Degussa P25/Ti sample was annealed at 200 °C to eliminate all the residual organics. The final thickness of the photocatalyst was about 12 μm, with a total photocatalyst loading of about 20 mg."
8,List of photocatalysts tested,"2.7 List of photocatalysts tested The list of the photocatalysts developed and tested, the description of which is given above, and of their acronyms used in the work, is reported in Table 1 ."
9,"Morphological, structural and electronic characterization","2.8 Morphological, structural and electronic characterization Morphology and structure of the Cu-based photocatalytic multilayers were studied by a Phenom ProX Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with EDS analyser. A D2 Phaser Bruker diffractometer equipped with a Ni β-filtered Cu-Kα radiation source, operating at 30 kV and 10 mA, was used to perform X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, in order to investigate the phase composition and crystalline size of the photocatalysts. In detail, data were collected in a 2θ range from 10° to 80° at a scanning rate of 0.025° s−1. The JCPDS database of reference compounds was used to identify the diffraction peaks. Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded by a Jasco V570 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere for solid samples, using BaSO4 as the reference and in air. The light harvesting characteristics of the photoactive layers were determined by a spectroradiometer system (Lot Oriel, model ILT950)."
10,Photo-electrochemical characterization,"2.9 Photo-electrochemical characterization The photocurrent response was evaluated by Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and Chronoamperometry (CA) under ON/OFF light irradiation cycles (3 s). The measurements were carried out in a modified Pyrex flask equipped with a quartz window. The photoactive layer, acting as the working electrode, was immersed into 170 mL of a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution, together with a Pt counter electrode and a 3 M KCl Ag/AgCl reference electrode (supplied by Amel), under a continuous flow of inert gas (N2). Specifically, LSV measurements were performed by scanning the applied voltage from 0.22 to 0.62 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Lighting was guaranteed by a solar simulator (Lot-Oriel, 300 W Xe lamp), equipped with a set of lenses for collecting and focusing light and a water filter to eliminate the infrared radiation. A potentiostat/galvanostat (Amel 2049) was used to apply the potential and measure the generated photocurrent. The CA measurements were recorded in presence of different light cut-off filters (AM 1.5G, UVC blocking filter, UVB/C blocking filter, Vis/IR blocking filter) in order to evaluate the response at different wavelength regions. The potential values have been translated into RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) voltages by using the following equation: (5) E ( R H E ) = E Ag / A g C l + 0.059 p H + 0.21"
11,Flow-through photocatalytic reactor,"2.10 Flow-through photocatalytic reactor Tests of CO2 photocatalytic reduction were performed using a specifically-designed flow-through photoreactor working in gas phase (gas–solid interface mode). The experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 2 . A continuous gas flow of CO2 was first introduced into a vapour saturator, maintained at constant temperature to obtain a water-saturated CO2 flow. At 60 °C in the vapour saturator, a gas flow with a saturation humidity of 0.10 kgvapour/kgCO2 was generated. Then, the water-saturated CO2 gas stream entered a compact photo-device, made of Plexiglas® (there is the need of having a transparent system to look if the nanomembrane does not break during operations) and equipped with a quartz window for light transmission. To avoid early desorption of reaction intermediates and facilitate C–C bond formation, residence time in the photoreactor should be kept as long as possible. The inlet gas flow rate into the photoreactor was set at 33 mL min−1. At this gas flow rate value, Reynolds number has been calculated to be as about 3, indicating that all the experiments were carried out in laminar flow regime, providing sufficiently long residence times for CO2 reduction (35 s). Lower gas flow rates are not compatible with the flow dynamics conditions needed for gas analysis. Once in the device, the gas flow was forced to cross the photocatalyst, located as a multilayer thin film in the middle of the photoreactor. Gas diffusion through the photocatalytic metallic substrate was guaranteed by the presence of small holes. It was checked that pore size did not influence the photocatalytic performance by varying the hole diameter from 0.1 to 1 mm in preliminary tests with Cu2O/Ti p-type sample. However, we observed no differences in the production rate of CO2 reduction products (data are within 5% of analytic error). This means that diffusion of water-saturated gaseous CO2 though the microperforated holes in Ti substrate is not the limiting factor. Then, all the tests were performed by perforating the substrates with holes of 0.1 mm diameter. The light source was a Xe-arc lamp (Lot Oriel, 300 W) equipped with a set of lenses for light collection and focusing, a water filter to absorb the infrared radiation and an AM 1.5G filter to simulate standard terrestrial solar irradiance distribution. Profiles of light spectral irradiance vs. wavelength with different cut-off light filters (including AM 1.5G) are reported in Supporting Information (see Figure S1). The outlet gas stream was sent to a cold trap to condense the liquid products. Moreover, at the end of the test, the surface of the photocatalyst was soaked by adding some drops of very diluted sulphuric acid (0.001 M), left for about 15 min and then washed with distilled water in order to extract species eventually formed and still adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The washing water was then recovered and analysed together with the liquid coming from the cold trap by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) to detect methanol, ethanol, methyl formate and isopropanol, and by Ion Chromatography (IC) to detect formic acid, acetic acid and oxalic acid [39]. The presence of products in the gas reactor outlet stream (H2, CH4, CO, C2H4, C2H6) was checked by a Gas Chromatograph (MicroGC GCX Pollution Analytic Equipment), having a sensitivity of 1–2 ppm. The CO2 photo-reduction tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (except for the vapour saturator heated at 60 °C). Test time was 5 h for each experiment. The irradiance was 135 mW·cm−2, measured by using a spectroradiometer (Lot Oriel, model ILT950) and adopting a procedure earlier reported [47]. This value represents the incident light energy reaching the photocatalytic surface when irradiated by the Xe lamp. The irradiated surface area was about 5 cm2. Control tests were made to exclude that the species detected in CO2 photoreduction derive from adventitious carbon [5]. First, the absence of formation of carbon-containing products was verified in photoreduction tests feeding a flow of humified inert gas (Ar) instead of humified CO2. These tests allowed to exclude that carbon products derive from adventitious carbon originating during photocatalyst preparation or present in the photoreactor components used. These tests also excluded that the detected carbon-containing products derive from carbonate species adsorbed onto the photocatalyst surface during preparation and storage of the photocatalyst. Photocatalytic tests with the bare microperforated Ti and Cu substrates (no CuxO deposited) did not produce any CO2 reduction products. Analytical tests were also made to monitor the quality of CO2 supply and to check the absence of elements such as CO even in traces. In addition, control experiments were made without illumination of the catalysts, allowing to exclude that the detected products are not associated to photocatalyst illumination."
12,Results,
13,SEM analysis,"3.1 SEM analysis Fig. 3 summarizes the morphological structures of the main photocatalysts prepared and tested in CO2 photoreduction. Fig. 3a shows a top SEM image of the sample Cu2O/Cu p-type, synthesized from a basic solution of lactate on a metallic Cu substrate, as described in section 2.2. The cuprous oxide layer evidences a pyramidal-like shape with an edge distribution size of particles ranging from 1.2 to 2.7 μm. The analogue p-type Cu2O layer but grown on a metallic Ti layer (Cu2O/Ti p-type) has similar characteristics (see Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Fig. 3b shows instead a SEM image of the top of the sample Cu2O/Ti n-typeA, prepared using a pH = 5 solution of copper acetate, as reported in section 2.3. The pyramidal-like structure is very similar to Cu2O/Cu p-type, however the particles are smaller (in the range 1.2–1.8 μm) with some irregular holes (see the yellow-border rounds in the figure) probably due to H2 bubble formation at these acidic conditions. Fig. 3c shows a top view SEM image of TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs) prepared by controlled anodic oxidation technique as described in section 2.5, evidencing the formation of a dense and clean packing of a highly ordered 1D nanostructure. The TiO2 NTs have a quite round-shape morphology, with mean diameter of 54 nm and wall thickness of about 8–9 nm. The cross-section SEM image of TiO2 NTs can be observed in Fig. 3d, showing a bunch of 1D ordered nanotubes with a length of 1.2 μm. The length of the NTs grown on the metallic Ti foil corresponds to the thickness of the TiO2 layer in the final multilayer photocatalyst. Fig. 3e and 3f show the SEM images of the p-type Cu2O/n-type TiO2 NTs multiple layers (Cu2O/TiO2NTs p-n). The p-type Cu2O layer covers uniformly the top surface of TiO2 NTs, but the pyramidal-like particles look smaller (in the range 0.1–0.5 μm) with respect to the p-type Cu2O layer grown on metallic substrates (Cu, Ti), probably because their size was influenced by the nanoholes of TiO2 NTs during the electrodeposition. A small piece of TiO2 NTs layer (indicated by a yellow arrow in Fig. 3e) detached from the photocatalyst is shown. The cross section of the NTs can also be observed in the SEM image of Fig. 3f (see the cleft in the nanostructure), obtained after detachment of the TiO2 NTs from the not-oxidized Ti layer."
14,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis The phase composition of the Cu2O-based photocatalysts was investigated by XRD and the obtained diffraction patterns are shown in Figure S3 (see Supporting Information) in the region between 10° and 80°. The peaks observed at 2θ = 29.7°, 36.6°, 42.5°, 52.5°, 61.6°, 73.7°, and 77.5° can be assigned to (110), (111), (200), (211), (220), (311), and (222) planes of the cuprous oxide (Cu2O), respectively (JCPDS 05–0667). The peaks observed at 2θ = 32.6°, 35.6°, and 48.8° can be assigned to (110), (111) and (202) planes of the cupric oxide (CuO), respectively (JCPDS 80–1916). The multilayer photocatalyst Cu2O/Ti n-typeA mainly shows refraction planes referring to Cu2O. After mild calcination at 250 °C, the new sample Cu2O/Ti n-typeB shows more intensive Cu2O peaks, but no CuO peaks appear, indicating that, if a partial oxidation occurs, it refers only to the external surface of the particles. The calcination at 450 °C, instead, leads to the complete oxidation of the Cu-based photocatalyst and the resulting CuO/Ti p-type evidences the typical patterns of CuO. The modification from n- to p-type after calcination will be described in the next section. The Cu2O/TiO2NTs p-n photocatalyst shows the patterns of both Cu2O and TiO2, the latter in anatase phase. In all the XRD patterns, the peaks related to pure Ti or Cu (used as the substrates) appear with different relative intensity depending on the covering by CuxO."
15,Photocurrent response,"3.3 Photocurrent response The nature of the semiconductor (n-type or p-type) and the mechanism of interaction of the electrons/holes can be investigated by CA measurements under periodical ON/OFF pulsing illumination cycles, as already described in section 2.9. Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent response of Cu2O/Ti p-type sample obtained at a set constant potential of −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.024 V vs. RHE). This voltage allows to maximize the cathodic photo-response, maintaining Cu stable in the oxidation state of (I), at least under the conditions of the CA measurements (electrolyte, pH). A clear increase (in absolute value) in the magnitude of current was observed under light exposure (see the ON/OFF arrows in the figure). The negative photocurrent response indicates a typical behaviour of a p-semiconductor, due to the movement of electrons towards the electrode/electrolyte interface rather than the holes [55]. The photo-induced cathodic current results from the reduction of protons (at least during the CA measurements) involving the photo-generation of electrons and revealing the p-type nature of the Cu2O thin layer. It is to notice that the increase of photo-generated negative current when using the AM 1.5G filter (simulating the solar irradiation) is very similar to the current increase at open spectrum (no filter used), indicating that Cu2O absorbs prevalently in the visible light region. The same sample (Cu2O/Ti p-type) was characterized by LSV under pulse light irradiation cycles, as described in section 2.9. Fig. 5 shows the obtained LSV scan between 0.22 and 0.62 V vs. RHE. The voltage was not applied below 0.2 V vs. RHE in order to avoid the full reduction of Cu2O to metallic Cu, as already discussed in the experimental part for the synthesis by electrodeposition. It can be observed that the photocurrent density shifted negatively when light pulsing was on, producing a cathodic photocurrent that decayed (in absolute value) during the light ON period, due to the recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole. However, at higher applied voltage the charge recombination was predominant and the photocurrent density fell immediately down in less than one second. Moreover, the two photocurrent density profiles at open spectrum and with AM1.5 G filter (simulating solar spectrum) are very similar, evidencing that the Cu2O/Ti p-type sample works mainly with visible light. Similar results were observed by testing the Cu2O/Cu p-type sample (see Figure S4 in Supporting Information). Fig. 6 shows instead the electrochemical behaviour of n-type Cu2O in comparison with samples calcined at different temperatures. Specifically, Fig. 6a shows the photocurrent density vs. applied potential profile (black profile) for the sample Cu2O/Ti n-typeA, evidencing a p-type behaviour in the narrow range from 0.22 to 0.31 V vs. RHE, while the behaviour shifts to n-type at voltages higher than 0.31 V. p-type or n-type character of a semiconductor strictly depends on Fermi level position with respect to its conduction and valence bands. However, Fermi level is spatially constant only at thermal equilibrium and, if an electrical bias is applied, it is not more constant. That leads the Cu2O/Ti n-typeA sample to change p-type to n-type behaviour when increasing the bias voltage, evidencing the typical behaviour of an n-prevalent semiconductor. However, after calcination at 250 °C, the sample (named as Cu2O/Ti n-typeB) behaves as n-type in the whole investigated potential range. For n-type semiconductors, the holes move towards the interface and extract electrons from the solution, leading to the formation of anodic photocurrent. On the contrary, the calcination at 450 °C leads to a modification of the behaviour and the annealed sample (named as CuO/Ti p-type) evidences a typical p-type behaviour (see Fig. 6b). Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent response of the p-type Cu2O/n-type TiO2 NTs multiple layers (Cu2O/TiO2NTs sample), in comparison with the bare n-type TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2NTs). The CA measurements were performed at a set constant potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.62 V vs. RHE), in order to maximize the anodic photo-current response of TiO2 and evaluate the improvement of light absorption and charge separation in presence of Cu2O. The first three peaks obtained at open spectrum, as well as the last one, show a stable and reproducible behaviour for the p-type Cu2O/n-type TiO2 NTs sample, providing an increment of about 1.8 mA·cm−2 under open illumination with respect to the dark anodic current density and resulting in a n-type behaviour as a whole. The current increment at open spectrum is slightly higher (about 12.5%) than the one obtained for the bare n-type TiO2 NTs, which instead shows a higher initial increment (about 3.4 mA·cm−2) but sharply decreasing until a value of about 1.6 mA·cm−2, evidencing a fast charge recombination, not shown by the Cu2O/TiO2NTs sample. It is interesting the behaviour of the p-type Cu2O/n-type TiO2 NTs sample under solar irradiation simulating conditions (see filter AM 1.5G in Fig. 7), showing a large increment with respect to the bare n-type TiO2 NTs sample not working, as known, in the visible light region. Taking into account that the p-type Cu2O alone is not able to provide a positive anodic current at this applied voltage (see Fig. 5), the good light absorption of Cu2O/TiO2NTs is to ascribe to the formation of a p-n heterojunction at the interface between Cu2O and TiO2 NTs. Note on the contrary that, by using a Vis/IR blocking filter, the Cu2O/TiO2NTs sample shows a photocurrent density lower than that of bare n-type TiO2 NTs. Thus, the presence of copper slightly reduces (about 15%) the fraction of UV radiation absorbed by the titania layer."
16,Optical properties,"3.4 Optical properties Fig. 8 reports the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of Cu2O/Ti p-type, Cu2O/TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs samples. Those of Cu2O/Ti n-typeB, Cu2O/Ti p-type, Cu2O/Cu p-type and CuO/Ti p-type samples are instead reported in Figure S5 (Supplementary Information). All the spectra show a broad absorption in the visible region, with a maximum in the range 550–600 nm. The spectrum of the bare TiO2NTs sample is characterized by a strong light absorption below 400 nm, related to the typical band gap of TiO2, and a broad light absorption between 500 and 1200 nm with a maximum at about 700 nm. We earlier observed that titania films, prepared by anodic oxidation and characterized by ordered arrays of nanotubes, show an intense absorption in this region, due to light diffraction and scattering [47,56], i.e. it is a physical effect rather than a true light absorption that does not enhance photocatalytic current/activity. For Cu2O/TiO2NTs, the light absorption onset shifts to 500 nm, with a maximum of light absorption at about 450 nm, indicating an effective enhanced visible light absorption due to formation of a p-n heterojunction at the interface between Cu2O and TiO2 NTs, also confirmed by the photocurrent response (see Fig. 7). The band gap for the bare TiO2 nanotubes (3.2 eV) corresponds to that typically reported for anatase TiO2 [57], while a shift in the absorption edge to about 2.0 eV could be estimated for the Cu2O/TiO2NTs sample, due to the presence of Cu2O nanoparticles [58]. In Figure S6 (see Supporting Information) we report a tentative model of the band structure of Cu2O-TNT including energy levels for CO2 reduction to methanol. Specifically, TNT as an n-type semiconductor has its Fermi level close to the conduction band (CB), while Cu2O as a p-type-semiconductor has its Fermi level close to the valence band (VB). After contact between TNT and Cu2O, the Fermi levels of the two semiconductors align together to the Fermi level of the electrons during CO2 reduction, as shown in the proposed diagram of Figure S6. It should be noted that the electrons participating in CO2 reduction straddle two different levels (reduction potentials of water oxidation and CO2 reduction to methanol, EOH-/O2 and ECO2/CH3OH respectively, both at pH = 7). Since the two half reactions should occur simultaneously, the chemical potential of the electrons contributing to the process locates at (E OH–/O2 + ECO2/CH3OH)/2, and it can be taken as the Fermi level of electrons in CO2 reduction."
17,CO2 photoreduction,"3.5 CO2 photoreduction A series of control experiments were preliminarily made to verify if products detected were actually produced via photoreduction of CO2 (with protons/electrons deriving from water in-situ oxidation), as described in the experimental part. These tests definitely excluded that products derive from adventitious carbon. Moreover, a control test was made without co-feeding water, but instead co-feeding H2 to check whether the reaction involves CO2 photoreduction with in-situ photogenerated H2, rather than by reaction with protons/electrons deriving from water photo-oxidation. This test did not produce any CO2 reduction products. Before testing all the CuxO-based samples, we have evaluated the effects of temperature and humidity in the gas flow-through photocatalytic reactor. Particularly, we studied the effect of water content by varying the temperature of water in the vapour saturator from 20 to 80 °C for Cu2O/Ti p-type sample. Figure S7 shows the production rate vs. temperature in the vapour saturator. Saturation humidity values in the inlet gas flow are also reported. Following the main product (i.e. methanol for this photocatalyst), we observed an increase of productivity with temperature. A temperature value of 20 °C was too low to guarantee sufficient vapour content in CO2 gas flow and methanol was detected only in traces. At 80 °C, instead, we observed the maximum of methanol productivity (0.0312 μmol h−1 gCu -1 cm−2). However, it was only slightly higher than the production rate at 60 °C (0.0283 μmol h−1 gCu -1 cm−2), thus we decided to test all the prepared photocatalysts maintaining temperature in the vapour saturator at 60 °C, in order to avoid instability of operation and degradation of the photoreactor material and tubes at 80 °C. As reported in the experimental part, the photoreactor operated at room temperature, while temperature at the reactor inlet was measured as about 40 °C (with a temperature of 60 °C set in the vapour saturator). However, we measured the temperature of the photocatalyst during light irradiation (by touching the photocatalyst substrate with a thin thermocouple) and it was quite high (120 °C). This is another big difference with respect to the conventional liquid approach in which a photocatalytic powder is dispersed in slurry during light irradiation. In the latter case, the aqueous solution acts as means of heat dissipation and temperature of the photocatalyst is much lower. The CuxO-based samples were then tested in CO2 photocatalytic reduction following the procedure described in section 2.10. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained, reporting the apparent turnover frequency – TOF – (per cm2 of illuminated photocatalyst) in μmoles of products formed per moles of Cu atoms. This is an apparent TOF, because the number of Cu atoms does not correspond to the number of active sites, but it allows to compare consistently the catalytic results of the different samples (i.e. at equal amount of copper) that present in some cases a quite different morphology. The TOFs for p-type Cu2O deposited on metallic substrates (Cu2O/Ti p-type and Cu2O/Cu p-type samples) were quite low, with methanol, formic acid and oxalic acid as the main reduction products. The formation of oxalic acid has been rarely observed in CO2 photoreduction in significant amounts. Srinivas et al. [59] reported the formation of oxalic acid in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over Cu-TiO2 ⁄ molecular sieve 5A composite. They tested their photocatalysts in 0.2 N NaOH containing solution, while we made CO2 photoconversion tests in absence of sacrificial agents and without using hole-scavenger species such as OH– ions, associated to the presence of a basic solution in contact with the photocatalyst. In addition, the use of the zeolite influences significantly the behaviour and these authors indicate that oxalic acid formation is related to “shape selectivity” effect related to zeolite (a king of coupling mechanism between formic acid-type species). Without zeolite, the oxalic acid formation strongly decreases. Furthermore, an UV lamp rather than a solar illuminator was used by these authors, with great influence of the UVC component (254 nm). Note also that we consider oxalic acid deriving from a different route than formic acid coupling (see below) as indicated by Srinivas et al. [59], and for which there is the need of a zeolite cocatalyst. On the contrary, photodegradation of oxalic acid on TiO2 has been investigated, for example by Mendive et al. [60] who analysed the reaction mechanism. They observed different bidentate coordinated oxalic acid species that under UV illumination convert to two CO2 molecules. In our case, oxalic acid formation was instead favoured due to the different conditions. Methyl formate and acetic acid were also observed as products of CO2 photoreduction, although in minor amounts. No relevant differences were observed for p-type Cu2O deposited on Cu (Cu2O/Cu p-type). In this case, very small quantities of CH4 (in traces), due to metallic Cu substrate, were also detected. No other products (H2, CO, etc.) were detected in these experiments. The photoreduction activity increased of one order of magnitude in n-type Cu2O and p-type CuO deposited on Ti samples (Cu2O/Ti n-typeB and CuO/Ti p-type, respectively). For the first sample, with respect to Cu2O/Ti p-type, the distribution of the products remained roughly similar, although their formation was intensified. In addition, methanol formation was slightly higher and new products (i.e. ethanol and isopropanol) were also detected. Using CuO instead of Cu2O (compare Cu2O/Ti p-type with CuO/Ti p-type), acetic acid became the major product of reaction, while ethanol and formic acid formation were not detected, and methyl formate was produced in relatively higher amounts. A comparison of the photocatalytic behaviour of the photoelectrodes with copper deposited on metallic substrates is given in Fig. 9 , which reports the Faradaic Efficiency (FE) to the various products (i.e. normalized, taking into account the different nr of electrons necessary for the various reactions: 6 for methanol, 2 for formic acid, 8 for methyl formate and acetic acid, 2 for oxalic acid, 12 for ethanol, and 18 for isopropanol). FE calculations allow to normalize results in terms of number of electrons (thus also in terms of solar light that the photocatalysts are able to absorb and convert to chemical energy) and to compare the behaviour of the different photocatalysts independently of the amount of copper. However, Fig. 9 (right axis) also reports the Coulombs per hour (normalized to moles of Cu and cm2 of photoelectrode) and the ratio between the sum of FE to C2 + C3 products and the sum of FE to C1 products (i.e. methanol and formic acid). While the behaviour was similar for p-type Cu2O/Ti and Cu2O/Cu photoelectrodes, with low photocurrents (Coulomb/h converted to chemicals) and a (C2 + C3)/C1 FE ratio slightly lower than 1, the other two samples showed a significant difference, with a drastic increase both in photocurrent and formation of > C1 products. For the more active photoelectrode, ethanol and isopropanol (i.e. 12 and 18 e- reduction reactions, respectively) with relatively high FE were also observed. The photoelectrode with CuO in place of Cu2O, shows the highest FE to acetic acid and methyl formate, both 8e- reductions. Cu2O/Cu p-type instead shows the highest FE to methanol, nearly 50%. Oxalic acid (a two-electron reduction) was produced with the highest FE on Cu2O/Ti photoelectrode (FE of about 20%). This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the formation of oxalic acid in the CO2 photoreduction has been observed in absence of sacrificial agents (without using hole-scavenger species such as OH– ions). Note that as indicated before, no other products of reaction (except traces of CH4) were detected, and that no H2 formed under the adopted experimental conditions. It is likely that the great difference in the photocatalytic behaviour observed in our tests with respect to what reported in literature (where CO and CH4 have been the most common observed products, absent or present in only traces in our case) is related to the different surface population with adspecies of the photocatalyst. In our case, the competitive chemisorption of water as well as the formation of a double layer, which can limit diffusion of CO2 to the surface of the photocatalyst, are both absent. Moreover, the results in Fig. 9 evidence how both the nature of copper and the presence of heterojunctions strongly determine the behaviour in CO2 photoreduction, and the distribution of products obtained. For this reason, we have also studied the behaviour of photocatalysts where instead of depositing copper oxide over the Ti substrate, the latter is treated before by anodic oxidation to create a thin oxide layer (about 1.2 µm thickness) constituted by ordered arrays (vertically-aligned) of TiO2 NTs, as shown in the characterization part. On this film, Cu2O is then electrodeposited. The bare TiO2 NTs/Ti (i.e. before electrodeposition of Cu2O) was also tested in CO2 photoreduction. Fig. 10 shows the comparison between Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti (p-n type) and TiO2 NTs/Ti. The plot reports also the data on Cu2O/Ti n-type (the most active in Fig. 9). Note that in this case, being not present copper in TiO2 NTs/Ti, the results are not normalized per moles of copper (molCu), but instead per mg of catalyst (mgcat). In terms of activity (Coulomb/h of converted CO2 to products per mg of photocatalyst and per cm2 of illuminated photoelectrode), the performance of Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti (p-n type) photoelectrode is roughly given by the sum of the activity of TiO2 NTs/Ti plus that of Cu2O/Ti n-type, taking into account that the deposit of Cu2O over TiO2 NT shields partially titania from light absorption (about 15% decrease, as shown in photocurrent tests). However, a very marked change in the distribution of products was observed. Note that also in these tests, H2, CO, CH4 and other hydrocarbons were not detected (if not below detection limit of 1–2 ppm), and thus the total FE is very high, nearly 100%. The TiO2 NTs were very selective (in terms of FE, i.e. calculated by considering the electrons necessary for the formation) to acetic acid, about 73%. Formic acid and oxalic acid were the two other products detected, with about 13–14% selectivity, while no other products were observed. Note also that the FE to > C1 products is about 6 times greater than that to C1 products (formic acid in this case). In addition, it can be observed that only carboxylic acids (formic, acetic and oxalic acids) were detected on this photocatalyst, with nearly 100% total selectivity to these products. This is also the first time that a similar behaviour has been reported to our knowledge. As a reference, we have also prepared a standard photocatalyst by depositing commercial TiO2 Degussa P25 on a microperforated Ti substrate via doctor blade technique. Note that this electrode is quite different from TiO2 NTs n-type, which was instead prepared by anodic oxidation technique. Testing of CO2 reduction shows for TiO2 Degussa P25 electrode the formation of only formic acid in traces. No alcohols (methanol, ethanol, etc.) or other products involving C–C bond formation have been detected. Due to the absence of a specific nanostructure, as present in vertically aligned TiO2 NTs, TiO2 Degussa P25 particles favour charge recombination at the grain boundary. The product distribution notably changes when Cu2O is deposited over TiO2 NTs. Two new products were observed, i.e. methanol and methyl formate. Methyl formate is a product of oxidation of methanol, typically formed by oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde, which then reacts with methanol to form methyl formate [61]. It is known that CO2 reduction with enzymes occurs through the sequence of formic acid, formaldehyde and finally methanol formation [62]. At the first indication, methyl formate derives from the reaction of methanol with a formaldehyde-like intermediate of its path of formation, remarking how in our experimental conditions surface condensation reactions to form heavier products occur. Methanol and methyl formate were also detected on Cu2O/Ti photoelectrodes, and it may be ascribed to a specific path of transformation related to the presence of copper. On the contrary, ethanol and isopropanol formation, observed on Cu2O/Ti but not on other copper-based photocatalysts (see Fig. 9), is a peculiar characteristic of this sample (Cu2O/Ti n-type). If we do not consider these two C2-C3 alcohols (absent in other Cu2O samples), the product distribution in Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti p-n sample could be interpreted as the combination of Cu2O/Ti and TiO2 NTs/Ti behaviours. However, at the same time, these results remark that in copper-based photoelectrodes the preparation may significantly influence the distribution of products. In terms of specific performances, the Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti p-n photoelectrode gives in CO2 photo-reduction methanol, acetic acid and oxalic acid productivities of 71.0, 55.8 and 24.3 μmol·gCu -1·h−1, respectively. Taking into account photonic efficiency and including radiation source and exposure area of the photocatalyst, following Ali et al. [63] indications it is possible to estimate an apparent quantum yield (AQY - ratio between electrons reacted and photons absorbed) of 21.5%. This is one of the highest AQY observed in CO2 photoreduction to methanol and acetic acid as the main products, obtained for atmospheric pressure operations with a gaseous flow of water-saturated CO2 and without sacrificial agents or use of hole-scavenger such as OH– [64]."
18,Discussion,"The first result of this study refers to the novel concept of gas-phase flow-through photoreactor as a new effective option for engineering the process of photocatalytic reduction of CO2. However, the results also evidence that due to the specific operating conditions, different types of CO2 reduction products are observed with respect to the products typically detected in conventional types of reactors (i.e. CO and CH4). Thus, not only the photoactive materials determine performances and type of products in (photo-)electrocatalytic reactions, but also photoreactor design and engineering has a crucial role [65,66]. Data reported in Table 2 and Figs. 9 and 10 clearly evidence a marked difference in our experimental conditions with respect to what reported in literature. CO, H2 and CH4 do not form in our conditions, while C1-C2 carboxylic acids and alcohols (or products related to their formation such as methyl formate) are observed. Alcohols up to C2-C3 are detected, but only in a specific copper sample. As commented in the experimental part, a series of control experiments allowed to confirm that these products derive from the photoreduction of CO2 with the protons/electrons deriving from water photo-oxidation. In these experiments, no solution is in contact with the photocatalyst (for this reason indicated as a gas-phase photoreduction), and differently from other tests in gas-phase reduction, the flow of CO2 and H2O is passing through the thin layer of the nanomembrane-type photocatalyst. Preliminarily, we have investigated some features related to reactor design and operational parameters, such as the water saturation in CO2 gas flow (depending on the vapour saturator temperature) and optimized the inlet gas flow rate to provide sufficiently long residence time (35 s) for CO2 reduction and operate in laminar flow regime (Reynolds number Re = 3). We used copper oxide based photocatalysts electrodeposited on metallic (Ti, Cu) or TiO2 NTs nanomembrane films. Note that the aim of the present work is to present this novel photoreactor concept (and how it largely influences the photoreduction behaviour) rather than to optimize the performances of the used photoactive materials. As a comparison, we also tested some of the CuxO-TiO2-based photocatalysts in liquid phase, by suspending the thin films in a CO2 saturated aqueous solution (reaction mode with solid–liquid interface). This configuration is quite similar to the conventional liquid approach in which a photocatalytic powder is dispersed in slurry during light irradiation. Results showed only products in traces (mainly methanol and ethanol, depending on the catalyst) for this kind of operation. The reasons are many: i) the competition of water on CO2 chemisorption sites, which modifies the catalytic behaviour; ii) CO2 concentration in solution is limited by its low solubility and, even more important, by its diffusion through the double layer, different from gas phase operations; iii) the charge separation in the photo(electro)catalytic approach allows to avoid charge recombination. The adoption of the new compact-design photoreactor, instead, with its peculiar characteristics (working in gas-phase and under a gas cross-flow of water-saturated-CO2 through the oxide photocatalytic nanomembrane film) can strongly modify the reaction pathways towards more interesting CO2 reduction products (>C1 carboxylic acids and alcohols), different from the products commonly observed in conventional photocatalytic systems. Likewise, we earlier observed that in a similar reaction (electrocatalytic rather than photocatalytic CO2 reduction) performed in a two-compartment device, operations without the electrolyte (gas-phase mode) can change considerably the type of products, promoting reactions with C–C bond formation [23]. In the present photo(electro)catalytic approach (in only one compartment), reaction mechanism is very similar with respect to the two-compartment electrocatalytic system, as the electrons (coming from light absorption) move rapidly to the reduction zones (which are present in this case in the same photocatalytic material) [54], probably located at the interface between CuxO and TiO2 NTs for the formation of methanol, and on specific OH– functional groups present on the TiO2 NTs surface for the formation of products involving C–C formation (like acetic acid and oxalic acid). The CuxO-TiO2 NTs-based thin films could also be used as photoanodes in a two-compartment PEC device, but a suited electrocathode (also based on CuxO) should be added in the cathodic compartment [49]. A tentative reaction mechanism for the formation of formic acid, methanol and acetic acid is reported in Supporting Information (see Figure S8), evidencing that acetic acid is the result of the combination between a –CH3 absorbed species and a CO2 –· radical anion. Despite we are aware that further dedicated mechanistic studies are needed to clarify this mechanism, we already demonstrated a similar reaction pathway for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 [39] and we believe that due to the similarities between the two approaches (electrocatalytic vs. photocatalytic) the reaction mechanism is very closed to what here proposed. Within the lab timescale investigated, the materials evidenced a linear behaviour with irradiation time (i.e. 5 h) and thus resulting stable. XRD analysis of the used photocatalysts (the case of Cu2O/Ti p-type is reported in Figure S9 in Supporting Information) confirms that, even if the crystalline properties slightly diminish in intensity, the crystalline phases are the same in comparison with the fresh photocatalyst, and no metallic copper (Cu 0) phase is observed, evidencing that the reduction environment (due to light irradiation) is not enough to reduce further the Cu2O species. However, it is not the scope of this work to analyse long-term stability of these materials, but they are used here to proof the concept and feasibility of the novel photoreactor, rather than their optimization. Although different products of CO2 reduction are observed, no side products (e.g. H2) are formed in these conditions, and thus the total FE is close to 100%. The specific FEs, taking into account the number of electrons involved in the specific reaction, are also high, being about 73% to acetic acid for TiO2 NTs/Ti n-type photoelectrode, and 42% and 44% to methanol and acetic acid, respectively, for Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti p-n type photoelectrode. In terms of apparent quantum yield (AQY), the results indicate that quite high values are reached (above 21% for Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti p-n type photoelectrode) considering that a solar illuminator is used as the light source. As shown in the photocurrent tests, a significant fraction of absorbed light is still lost, due to fast mechanisms of charge recombination. Nevertheless, this AQY value can be considered quite high for CO2 photoreduction, in the absence of sacrificial agents (such as other chemicals present in the solution in contact with the photocatalyst) and with no use of hole-scavenger such as OH– ions, associated to the presence of a basic solution in contact with the photocatalyst. Being operations in gas-phase, these effects cannot be present. In order to compare our results with literature, Ali et al. reported a review about the AQY obtained by many research works of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using conventional batch reactors [63]. Values reported for CuxO/TiO2 based on photocatalytic systems (not containing precious metals) range from 0.013 to 2.03%, thus much lower than our case. Moreover, stability of the performances is at least over 5 h, which is the typical time for CO2 photoreduction tests. The question is why in our experimental conditions we observe a so marked difference with respect to results reported in literature. We should precise that in our CO2 photoreduction tests, the outlet gas stream from the photoreactor is sent to a cold trap containing a diluted sulphuric acid solution to capture carboxylic acids, alcohols and methyl formate, while the gas stream is analyzed to determine the presence of non-condensable products (H2, CO, CH4, light hydrocarbons). Note, however, that at the end of the test, the surface of the photocatalyst was soaked by adding some drops of very diluted sulphuric acid (0.001 M), left for about 15 min and then washed with distilled water in order to extract species eventually formed and still adsorbed on the catalyst surface. With this procedure, we determine not only the products present in the outlet stream from the photoreactor, but also those remaining on the photocatalyst. Note that in our control tests, we have checked that the products observed do not form when the sample is not illuminated, or when CO2 is not present, i.e. the products detected are not related to adventitious carbon present in the reactor/electrode. Specific analysis of the product distribution in the reactor outlet stream (absorbed in the cold trap, indicated hereafter as A) compared with the extraction of adsorbed species on the photocatalyst surface (indicated hereafter as E) for the test with Cu2O/TiO2 NTs/Ti p-n sample, shows that methanol and formic acid are totally distributed in A (>95%), while acetic acid, oxalic acid and methyl formate are present in A within a percentage of 70–80%. Thus, only a small amount (20–30%) of products of CO2 reduction (specially the heavier products) remain adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface. Our interpretation of the difference with respect to literature results, although further experiments are necessary to confirm this preliminary hypothesis, is that the absence of an aqueous solution in contact with the photocatalyst, and the general very low partial pressure of water in the flow of CO2 (saturated with water, e.g. with a concentration around 4%), determine an effective very low surface concentration of water on the photocatalyst, while a high surface concentration of adsorbed CO2 is present, being CO2 in contact with the photocatalyst not limited by solubility as in tests in the presence of a liquid solution. This determines a completely different surface coverage with respect to conventional tests, favoring the formation of C2-C3 products, while minimizing reactions requiring high coverage by H* species (active hydrogen species), i.e. those leading to H2, CO and CH4 formation. This indication, although to be confirmed, introduces the relevant question about the crucial role of the surface coverage by adspecies in CO2 photoreduction, as we introduced also for the electrochemical CO2 reduction [67]. This is a relevant aspect to consider in mechanistic studies, including theoretical ones, that is typically not considered. As commented for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, the surface coverage by adspecies has an impact on determining the conversion paths of CO2 even greater that the nature of the electro/photo catalysts, while the latter aspect is the only one commonly considered. A second relevant observation deriving from the reported experiments is about the role of copper in the photoconversion of CO2. While carboxylic acids are detected also with TiO2 NTs films without deposited copper, only when copper is present (alone or on TiO2) alcohols are formed, in particular methanol or a product associated to it such as methyl formate. TOF to methanol (normalized to amount of copper) depends significantly on the method of preparation of the photoelectrode (see Table 1), but the photocurrent experiments show a rough relationship with the photocurrent. This indicates that TOF to methanol is mainly related to the ability of the photocatalyst to absorb light and generate a photocurrent, to which is reasonably associated the capability of in-situ generation of protons/electrons (by water photo-oxidation or photo-electrolysis) needed for the photoreduction of CO2. FE, as the sum of methanol and methyl formate, is about 50% for Cu2O deposited on Ti or Cu substrate, lower (around 40%) for Cu2O deposited on TiO2 NTs/Ti or CuO deposited on Ti (see Fig. 9). In the latter, the amount of methyl formate is higher than that of methanol, reasonably due to the higher redox properties of Cu2+ with respect to Cu+ that may favour methyl formate over the methanol path. This could also explain why FE to acetic acid is higher in this sample. For Cu2O deposited on TiO2 NTs/Ti, instead, the lower selectivity to methanol is related to the formation of ethanol and in minor part also isopropanol. Tentatively, this difference refers to the presence of interfacial sites at the Cu2O/TiO2 boundary that modify the paths of conversion of CO2. The presence of a p-n heterojunction is likely relevant, but current data do not allow to clarify fully this aspect. Note also that the presence of both Cu2O and p-n heterojunction enhances light absorption in the visible region and slightly shifts the band gap, as shown in the characterization of this sample, and this may induce the difference in the behaviour observed. Although further data are necessary, these results evidence new relevant aspects related to the paths in CO2 photoconversion, and that a better understanding will allow to progress in developing these photocatalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the possibility to form a 18e- reduction product such as isopropanol (even if in small amounts) in the photoreduction of CO2 is shown."
19,Conclusions,"In this work we have showed a novel concept of gas flow-through photo(electro)catalytic reactor based on copper-functionalized nanomembranes for the conversion of CO2 and how it leads to a very peculiar behaviour, quite different from those reported in literature. Specifically, its use allowed to form selectively, with high efficiency, C1-C2 carboxylic acid and C1-C3 alcohols, especially increasing significantly the formation of C2 + products with respect to most of literature alternatives. To remark the conceptual relevant difference of the proposed approach with respect to both photocatalytic and PEC approaches, we operated in gas-phase with a CO2 flow (saturated with H2O) passing through the photoactive nanomembrane. Only one side is illuminated, as in PEC reactors. However, in conventional photocatalytic approaches the CO2 + H2O flow is in contact with the semiconductor but does not pass through it. Moreover, with respect to photocatalysis operating in the presence of a liquid (such as CO2-saturated water), there are many advantages. No limitations in CO2 concentration exist at the catalyst surface, due to solubility and diffusion through the double layer, and competitive chemisorption of water is largely reduced. All these aspects led to a great difference in terms of products for the novel approach proposed with respect to conventional PEC or photocatalytic approaches. We believe that these results may open new prospects in terms of novel possibilities of operations in the photoconversion of CO2, widening also the understanding of reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction, regarding the role of adspecies in controlling the paths of CO2 conversion, the role on copper in creating a path to alcohols and of Cu2O/TiO2 interface sites to enable the possibility to form higher alcohols."
