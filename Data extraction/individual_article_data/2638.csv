0,Introduction,"Carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones comprise an important class of compounds used not only in chemical industries but also in laboratories. The oxidation reaction of alcohols is regarded as a principal process because it is the most common way of producing carbonyl compounds. In spite of the formation of toxic by-products and large amount of heavy metal wastes, the reactions have been performed mainly in non-catalytic systems with stoichiometric amounts of oxidants [1]. From environmental and economic points of view, catalytic systems that can use greener and cheaper oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen, have been desired [2]. To date, catalytic systems of various kinds have been reported in the oxidation of alcohols using transition metal complexes [3–5], nitroxyl radicals [1], heterogeneous catalysts [6–10], and photocatalysts [11,12]. For practical applications, utilization of metal catalysts supported on oxide materials is preferred because of their advantages in separation, recovery and reuse of the catalysts, and ease of catalysts preparation. Therefore, the development of efficient supported metal catalysts for this reaction has been regarded as an attractive research area. Recently, we reported that TiO2-supported Ir catalysts prepared using the conventional impregnation method efficiently catalyzed the oxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen [13]. Although Ir catalysts supported on various oxide materials exhibited catalytic activity to a certain degree, the relations between catalytic activity and metal surface area or acid–base properties of the support were not observed clearly. Investigation of the intrinsic role of TiO2 support revealed that catalytic activity of Ir/TiO2 in the alcohol oxidation was enhanced by high-temperature reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere. Strong interaction between metal particles and the TiO2 support is well known to be induced by high-temperature hydrogen reduction. This phenomenon is known as the Strong-Metal-Support-Interaction (SMSI) effect [14,15]. A well accepted explanation of the SMSI effect is the decoration of metal surface by partially reduced titanium oxide [16–19]. Several reports have described that activity and/or selectivity of the TiO2 supported catalysts can be tuned by the SMSI effect. For example, Fierro et al. reported enhancement of the catalysis toward the hydrogenation of citral over Ir/TiO2 by the SMSI effect [20]. They explained that TiO x species formed by the higher temperature reduction contributed to the polarization of carbonyl group, which made the hydrogenation of citral easier to produce geraniol or nerol. Moon et al. and Panpranot et al. reported that higher temperature reduction of Pd/TiO2 improved the selectivity in the semi-hydrogenation reactions of alkyne to alkene [21–23]. Moon et al. described that configuration and electronic modification of Pd particles were the key factors for improving the selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene over Pd/TiO2 [21]. In the present work, we describe enhancement of the catalytic activity of Ir/TiO2 in the oxidation of alcohols by high-temperature reduction in a hydrogen stream. Furthermore, we investigated how the SMSI effect participated in the enhancement of the catalytic activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Instruments,"2.1 Instruments GC analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2010; Shimadzu Corp.) with a FID detector equipped with a TC-WAX capillary column. Mass spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (GCMS2010; Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a TC-WAX capillary column at an ionization voltage of 70eV. NMR spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (JNM-ECA-600; JEOL). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured, respectively, at 600.17 and 150.92MHz. A transmission electron microscope (JEM2010; JEOL) with an acceleration voltage of 200kV and a LaB6 cathode was applied for the observation of the images of supported catalysts. Samples were prepared by suspending the catalyst powder ultrasonically in 2-propanol and depositing a drop of the suspension on a standard copper grid covered with carbon monolayer films. The X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (JPS-9010; JEOL) with a Mg Kα X-ray source (10kV, 10mA). Before measurement, a sample was reduced by H2 at 573K or 723K in the preparation chamber and transferred to the analysis chamber without exposure to air. The adsorption amount of carbon monoxide was measured using a static volumetric adsorption apparatus (Omnisorp 100CX; Beckman Coulter, Inc.) at 298K. Before measurement, a sample was dried at room temperature and reduced for 3h at varying temperatures in a flow of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure. The dispersion (D(%); percentage of metal atoms exposed to the surface) of the supported metal was evaluated from the amount of chemisorbed carbon monoxide and adsorption stoichiometry (CO/surface metal atom=1)."
3,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.2 Materials and catalyst preparation The TiO2 support (P25) was purchased from Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd. The solvents used for the catalytic reaction were dried with activated molecular sieves 4A. For other materials, commercially available reagents of the highest grade were used without further purification. A TiO2-supported Ir catalyst was prepared from aqueous solution of H2IrCl6 using the conventional impregnation method. The loading amount of Ir was adjusted in the range of 0.5–15wt%. The impregnated sample was dried at 373K and then reduced in a H2 flow at varying temperature for 3h."
4,Procedures for catalytic oxidation,"2.3 Procedures for catalytic oxidation The oxidation reaction was done in the following procedure: 187mg of the reduced 2wt% Ir/TiO2 (Ir: 20μmol, 1.25mol% to substrates), the solvent (toluene or mesitylene, 1.5mL), and the substrate (1.5mmol) were charged into a glass vial (17mL). The reaction was started by stirring the reaction mixture at 353K in alcohol oxidation or 423K in xanthene oxidation under molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure. The products were identified by comparison of the mass and NMR spectra with those of authentic samples. The yields of the products were determined using GC analyses with an internal standard technique."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the catalyst The relation of CO chemisorption amount with hydrogen reduction temperature was examined on 2wt% Ir/TiO2. When the hydrogen reduction temperature was increased, the CO chemisorption amount was decreased (Table 1 ) because of the Strong Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) effect. The decrease of chemisorption amount is explained by the decoration of Ir metal surface with partially reduced titanium oxide, which is formed by hydrogen reduction at high temperature [16–19]. After reduction at 873K, the chemisorption amount of CO was almost zero. A TEM photograph of the catalyst reduced at 723K is presented in Fig. 1(b). It was rather difficult to distinguish the interface between Ir metal particle and TiO2 support. In addition, some Ir particles were completely covered with partially reduced titania moieties. On the other hand, the interface between Ir metal particle and support was clearly distinguishable in the case of 573K reduced catalyst (Fig. 1(a)) and the surfaces of Ir metal particles were well exposed. These observations also support the occurrence of the SMSI effect by the reduction at 723K. The electronic state of Ir was investigated using XPS analyses. The catalysts reduced in a H2 atmosphere were transferred to the measurement chamber without exposure to air. In the Ir4f7/2 transition, the similar spectra were obtained for 573K and 723K reduced catalysts (Fig. 2 ). This observation suggests that the electronic state of Ir species formed on the catalyst reduced at 573K and 723K are not so different. The observed spectra for Ir4f7/2 transition were separated in two peaks: a major peak centered at 60.2eV and a minor one at 61.7 or 61.8eV. Binding energy for the major peak is slightly lower than the reported value for metallic Ir (60.8eV [24]), indicating that slightly anionic Ir is the major species. The binding energy for the minor peak is approximately equal to that reported for IrO2 (62.0eV [24]), indicating that a small amount of Ir species is in an oxidized state even after the reduction."
7,Enhancement of catalytic activity by higher temperature reduction,"3.2 Enhancement of catalytic activity by higher temperature reduction The relation between catalytic activity and reduction temperature was investigated in the aerobic oxidation of 1-phenylethanol (Table 1). In spite of the decrease of CO chemisorption amount, the catalysts reduced at higher temperature (673–873K) showed higher activity than that reduced at 573K. This result suggests that partially reduced titanium oxide around Ir metal particles enhanced the catalytic activity. The catalyst reduced at 723K showed the best performance; 94% of acetophenone afforded 98% selectivity after 7h at 353K. The lack of detection of a significant amount of by-product indicates that the oxidation proceeded selectively. Low-valent Ir or metallic Ir is expected to be the active species because the catalyst without hydrogen reduction showed almost no activity. The catalysts reduced at 773 and 823K showed lower activity than the 723K reduced one. This is probably caused by the too much covering of the Ir surface with partially reduced titania moieties. The high-temperature reduction enhanced not only 1-phenylethanol, but also the oxidation reactions of a wide variety of alcohols. The catalytic activities of the 723K reduced catalyst and 573K reduced catalyst are compared in Table 2 . In the oxidation of primary alcohols, the 723K reduced catalyst showed slightly higher or almost identical activity compared to that of the 573K reduced catalyst. When benzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, and cinnamyl alcohol were applied to the substrates, the 723K reduced catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity to afford corresponding aldehyde quantitatively, whereas the 573K reduced catalyst also showed good activity to afford aldehydes in around 90% yields. In the oxidation of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, the respective catalytic activities of the 723K reduced catalyst and the 573K reduced catalyst were almost identical. Enhancement of catalytic activity by high-temperature reduction was observed more clearly in the oxidation of secondary alcohols. For example, the 723K reduced catalyst afforded 2-adamantanone in 94% yield in the oxidation of 2-adamantanol after 21h, whereas the 573K reduced catalyst afforded the product in 58% yield in the same period. For oxidation of other kind of aromatic and aliphatic secondary alcohols, the 723K reduced catalyst showed efficient catalytic activity to afford the corresponding ketones at more than 92% yields. It is noteworthy that not only the catalytic activity but the selectivity was also improved by the higher-temperature reduction. For oxidation of secondary alcohols, dehydration of substrate to form alkenes was the only detectable side reaction. To consume the substrate in a shorter period might reduce the production of by-products. Therefore the selectivity was improved. We have already reported that Ir/TiO2 catalyst shows the catalytic activity to the aerobic oxidation of alkylarenes [13]. We also compared the respective catalytic activities of 573K and 723K reduced 2wt% Ir/TiO2 in the oxidation of xanthene (Table 2, entry 10). It is particularly interesting that the catalytic activity of xanthene oxidation was retarded by the higher-temperature reduction. As presented in Table 2, catalysis enhancement by high-temperature reduction was observed to a considerable degree in the oxidation of secondary alcohols and moderately in the oxidation of primary alcohols. We reported earlier that primary alcohols reacted predominantly over Ir/TiO2 catalyst in the presence of both primary and secondary alcohols [13]. This result might be explained by the stronger absorption of primary alcohols than secondary alcohols on the active sites. The marked enhancement of the catalytic activity in the oxidation of secondary alcohols by higher temperature reduction suggests that absorption of secondary alcohols on the active sites was improved in the presence of the partially reduced titanium oxide species near the Ir metal particles. On the other hand, the oxidation of primary alcohols was only moderately enhanced by the SMSI effect. This is probably because the adsorption of primary alcohols to the catalyst surfaces is strong enough even in the absence of the SMSI effect is absent. Fierro et al. reported the enhancement of the catalysis toward the hydrogenation of citral over Ir/TiO2 by the SMSI effect [20]. They explained that TiO x species formed by the higher temperature reduction activated the substrate by polarizing a carbonyl group. The SMSI effect is known to result from the formation of partially reduced titanium oxide (TiO2−δ ) species near the supported precious metals. The partially reduced titanium oxide species contains oxygen vacancies. In other words, it contains coordinatively unsaturated titanium sites, which are able to function as adsorption and/or activation sites of polar molecules, such as carbonyl compounds and alcohols. To bind the alcohol molecules in the vicinity of the iridium metal center is presumed to be an intrinsic role in the enhancement of the catalysis by the SMSI effect (Fig. 3 ). It is noteworthy that no enhancement was observed in the oxidation of alkylarenes of xanthene (Table 2, entry10), probably because xanthene does not form alcoholate and has no strong coordination ability."
8,Kinetic analysis,"3.3 Kinetic analysis To investigate the intrinsic role of the SMSI effect in the enhancement of the catalysis, kinetic analysis using a Langmuir equation was conducted. The Langmuir equation is given as V = n·k reac·K·[A]/(1+ K·[A]) or 1/V =1/(n·k reac ·K·[A])+1/(n·k reac ) (K = k ads /k des ), where V is the reaction rate, n is the number of reaction sites, k reac is the reaction rate constant of adsorbed species, k ads and k des are the adsorption and desorption rate constants of substrate on catalyst surface, respectively, and [A] is the substrate concentration. The adsorption equilibrium constant K is calculated by dividing intercept of y-axes (1/(n·k reac )) by slope (1/(n·k reac ·K)) on the plot of 1/V vs. 1/[A]. Fig. 4 presents plots of 1/V vs. 1/[A] toward the 1-phenylethanol oxidation catalyzed by 573K and 723K reduced 2wt% Ir/TiO2. Linear correlations were observed on the plots for both 573K and 723K reduced catalysts, suggesting that the reaction operated in the Langmuir type kinetics. The K values calculated using the method described above were, respectively, 6.7 and 13.5 for 573K and 723K reduced catalysts. Increase of the K value after high-temperature reduction indicates clearly that the SMSI effect enhances adsorption of alcohol on the catalyst surface."
9,Recyclability of catalyst,"3.4 Recyclability of catalyst Recyclability of 2wt% Ir/TiO2 catalyst reduced at 723K was examined in oxidation of benzyl alcohol. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration and subsequently washed with toluene. The obtained catalyst was reused without any treatment. During the recycling experiments, the yield of benzaldehyde was only slightly lower than the fresh one in the 2nd and 3rd runs (>99% (fresh catalyst), 90% (2nd run), 92% (3rd run)), although the greater decrease was observed in the 4th run (64% (4th run)). The catalytic activity was almost recovered by hydrogen reduction at 723K after the 4th run. The activity was maintained in another three reactions (92% (1st run after reduction), 92% (2nd run), and 89% (3rd run)). Tauster et al. discussed from the CO chemisorption results on 2wt% Pd/TiO2 that the SMSI effect became ineffective by oxygen treatment at 673K and recovered again after high-temperature hydrogen reduction [14]. Therefore, the catalyst degradation after several reactions and recovery after high-temperature hydrogen reduction could be explained by ineffectiveness and recovery of the SMSI effect."
10,Conclusion,"The catalytic activity of 2wt% Ir/TiO2 in alcohol oxidation with molecular oxygen was enhanced by higher-temperature reduction (673–873K) of the catalyst in a hydrogen stream, even though the chemisorption amount of CO was decreased. Wide variety of alcohols were converted efficiently into corresponding carbonyl compounds with 2wt% Ir/TiO2 reduced at 723K. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction operated in Langmuir type kinetics. The adsorption constants in Langmuir equation of 6.7 and 13.5 for 573K and 723K reduced catalysts respectively indicate that high-temperature reduction of catalysts enhanced adsorption of alcohols. Formation of partially reduced titanium oxide by high-temperature hydrogen reduction of TiO2-supported metal catalysts are widely known phenomena referred to the SMSI effect, and the formed TiO(2−δ) species containing coordinatively unsaturated titanium sites might contribute to the enhancement of catalysis as a coordination site of alcohols."
