0,Introduction,"Combination of light energy and nano-materials have been accounted as one of the most favorable technologies, which can mitigate the issues of global energy crisis and climate change [1,2]. In particular, due to potential applications in eliminating environmental harmful contaminants, semiconductor photo-catalysis functional under visible light have gained considerable attentions [3,4]. Among all, photo-catalytic H2 evolution is a clean, economical, reliable and environment friendly process and has invoked more attractions as an efficient approach for mitigating GHGs and recycling industrial effluents [5,6]. In the pioneer work, Honda and Fujishima in 1972 [7] successfully demonstrated photocatalytic H2 generation by water splitting using semiconductor photo-catalysts. Instead of various research efforts, the stability and effectivity of semiconductor materials for photocatalytic water-splitting to molecular H2 product is not much impressive to fulfill the standards required for industrial applications [8]. However, H2 evolution rates can be enhanced by several times with the involvement of renewable sacrificing reagents such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol and glucose to gain more and more industry attention [9–11]. Among the alcohols, the glycerol could be used as an efficient sacrificing agent for dynamic H2 production to make the photocatalytic process more sustainable compared to pure water [12]. A large number of nanostructured photocatalysts such as Ag loaded ZnO nanosheets [13], CdS coupled g-C3N4 composite with RGO [14], WO3 coupled with g-C3N4 [15], ZnO [16], GO supported on ZnS [17], ZnS2 [18], and TiO2 [19] have been successfully investigated for efficient H2 production. Among all, TiO2 is recommended as a superior candidate because of its numerous advantages such as low-cost, non-corrosive, abundantly available and high chemical/thermal stability. However, high band gap energy (3.2 eV) and lower efficiency due to rapid recombination of photo-induced electron/hole (e−/h+) are the limitations [20]. TiO2 efficiency can be improved under solar energy by band structuring, controlled morphology, photosensitizations with metals/non-metals and heterojunctions with low band gap materials [21–23]. TiO2 modification with various metals and semiconductors such as Pt doped graphene/TiO2 [24], Au loaded TiO2/CdS [25], Cu-TiO2 [26], Ag2O/TiO2, Pt doped TiO2/ZnO [27] and Au doped TiO2 [28] etc., have been reported with improved hydrogen production. Although, significant research has been conducted, yet low-cost and noble metals free materials as co-catalyst to design highly efficient TiO2 photo-catalyst functional under solar light are highly demanding. Previously, carbon nano-structured have been explored as efficient coupling materials for TiO2 based nano-structured composites due to their electron-accepting and electron-transmitting properties [29]. For example, single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, MWCNTs), fullerene (C60) and graphene oxide (GO) have been coupled with TiO2 to get enhanced photocatalytic efficiency [30–32]. Among the carbon materials, MWCNTs exhibit extraordinary electrical, thermal, optical and chemical properties with high surface area that makes them conductive under visible spectrum [33,34]. Due to high surface area, MWCNTs can be beneficial for suppression of electron/hole pairs recombination with efficient adsorption-desorption process. TiO2 nanoparticles loaded with MWCNTs would be fruitful to maximize visible light absorption, transmitting electrons and increased separation of charge carriers [35,36]. Numerous photo-catalysts have been utilized for H2 production over MWCNTs such as Ag doped TiO2-MWCNTs [37], WO3-MWCNTs [38] and CdS-CNTs [39]. In addition, the efficiency of MWCNTs/TiO2 can be further improved by using layered natural clay due to their multifunctional properties, low cost, abundantly availability and environmental friendly to make sustainable photocatalytic process for hydrogen production. Recently, multi-layered clay minerals are gaining much attractions due to their high stability, good conductivity, recyclability and large surface area [40,41]. Among the available natural clays, montmorillonite (MMT) has gained more considerations due to pillared 2D layered structure, efficient adsorption due to microporous structure, remarkable charge capturing dexterity and excellent cation transfer potential [42]. These distinguished properties of MMT make it much attractive to be used as a co-catalyst in TiO2 surface modification. In this perspective, TiO2/MMT [43] and ZnS/MMT [44] composite catalysts for CO2 reduction applications have been reported with improved efficiency and selectivity. In the recent developments, Ni decorated over MMT/TiO2 nano-catalyst was successfully tested for photo-driven evolution of H2 and organic compounds via aqueous ethanol water solution under ultra-violet (UV) light irradiations [45]. The photoactivity of MMT modified TiO2 nano-composite can be further enhanced by loading with photo-sensitizers such as CNTs. Therefore, the dispersion of MWCNTs/TiO2 in the 2D layered structured of MMT would enable to develop 1D/0D/2D heterojunctions for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production under solar energy irradiations. To the best of our knowledge, MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite has never been reported in photocatalytic water splitting applications. Herein, the design and fabrication of novel 1D/0D MWCNTs/TiO2 structure dispersed in 2D layered MMT to synthesize 1D/0D/2D heterojunctions via single step sol-gel and wet impregnation method has been investigated. The performance of newly developed composite materials was analyzed for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from glycerol aqueous mixture in a slurry type photo-reactor system under visible light irradiations. Different operating parameters such as loading of MMT and MWCNTs over TiO2 nano-particles and different concentrations of feed mixtures were also studied. Moreover, photo-catalytic turn over productivity (PTOP) of the heterojunction composite was reported for the first time to estimate the concentration of molecular H2 produced based on photons energy and specific surface area. Stability analysis of heterojunction composite was carried out to estimate the duration and reliability of nanostructured composite in cyclic runs. Furthermore, the schematic mechanism for H2 evolution in the presence of photo-catalyst, solar light and glycerol aqueous mixture was also proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of MMT/TiO2 composite sample,"2.1 Preparation of MMT/TiO2 composite sample Commercially available Titanium (IV) iso-propoxide (sigma-aldrich) and montmorillonite (Bentonite, sigma-aldrich) were used to prepare MMT/TiO2 nano-structured catalysts. The crystalline structured and multilayered MMT dispersed TiO2 nano-structured composites were constructed via a single step sol-gel process. Typically, sample ‘A’ was synthesized by adding slowly 10 mL titanium solution in 25 mL 2-propanol (C3H8O) solution and continually stirred for 40 min in a round shaped bottom flask. Afterwards, appropriate quantity of MMT-clay was added into sample ‘A’ under vigorous stirring and the process was continued for 30 min. Next, for the hydrolysis process sample ‘B’ was obtained by dispersing 6.37 mL of 1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) mixture in a fixed amount of 10 mL 2-propanol (C3H8O) solution and added dropwise into sample ‘A’ and continuously stirred for further 12 h at ambient conditions. Finally, obtained solution was dried in an oven at 110 °C for 12 h under air flow and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain MMT/TiO2 nano-structured catalyst."
3,Preparation of MMT@TiO2@MWCNTs composite sample,"2.2 Preparation of MMT@TiO2@MWCNTs composite sample Carbon nanotubes, multi-walled (Sigma-Aldrich) were acidic functionalized using acid mixture containing 75 mL sulphuric acid (6 M) and 25 mL nitric acid (6 M). Then, 200 mg MWCNTs were added in acid mixture and ultra-sonicated at 45 °C for 1 h. Finally, sonicated mixture was washed with deionized water (DI) until filtrate pH reached to 7 and was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The fabrication of MWCNTs over MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite was conducted through wet-impregnation method. Typically, 5 wt% functionalized MWCNTs were dispersed in 10 mL 2-propanol solution and added appropriate quantity into MMT/TiO2 dispersion. The suspension was stirred for another 6 h under continuous heating at 60 °C. Finally, the slurry was dried overnight at 90 °C and then calcined at 500 °C for 1 h to get MMT@TiO2@MWCNTs composite samples. The scheme for the preparation of composite samples is presented in Fig. 1 , which clearly highlighted the sol-gel and wet impregnation process."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis of the nanocomposites was carried out by employing a broker D 8 advance diffractometer provided with Cu-Kα radiation and wavelength = 1.541 Å. The data was collected at 40 kV and 40 mA at the rate of 1 min−1 2θ = 1.5° to 80°. Raman spectrum was examined at room temperature with Raman Xplora Spectrometer (Lab RAM HR Evolution, HORIBA) with a 532 nm emitting laser, which is used as excitation source. BET (Brunauer Emmett-Teller) specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of nanostructured catalysts were obtained by N2 adsorption-desorption investigated at −196 °C using micrometrics ASAP 2020. The structural morphology of nanocomposites was investigated using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS Crossbean 340). The lattice structure of the samples was obtained in a transmission electron microscopy with TEM, HITACHI HT7700. Infrared spectra peaks were determined by FTIR using Perkin Elmer, spectrum 2000 spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The absorption spectra of samples were obtained with the Agilent, Cary 100 UV–Vis spectrophotometer instrument in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Finally, PL analysis was conducted to investigate photo-generated charge carrier’s separation employing Lab RAM HR Evolution, HORIBA."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test The photoactivity test for H2 generation from glycerol aqueous mixture was conducted in a slurry type three neck Pyrex glass photo-reactor system with total volume of 120 mL. The photoreactor was provided with HID 35 W Xe-lamp of intensity 20 mW cm−2 as a visible light source. First, 50 mg photo-catalyst was immersed in 80 mL aqueous solution of glycerol using a magnetic stirrer. Prior to start the experiment, system was flushed with N2 gas at a flow rate of 15 mL min−1 for 20 min. The concentration of molecular H2 gas was analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-7820A) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples were collected every hour in gas sample collecting bags and analyzed using Intelligent H2 analyzer to detect hydrogen in ppm levels. Furthermore, the H2 was not detected under the same experimental conditions in the absence of photo-catalysts and light illumination."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization To determine crystalline phase of synthesized TiO2, MWCNTs, MMT, MMT/TiO2 and MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite, XRD analysis was conducted and the results are presented in Fig. 2 . It was observed that TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited pure anatase and crystalline phase peaks positioned at 2-theta of 25.53°, 37.91°, 48.06°, 53.92°, 55.16°, 62.82°, which are aligned with (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal planes. The diffraction peak of MMT at 2 θ = 3.70° corresponding to (0 0 1) exhibits basal reflection initiated because of MMT layered sheets. However, TiO2 retained its original crystalline structure in case of MMT dispersed TiO2 samples, yet peak patterns of TiO2 become wider and weaker. This reflects that MMT provided hindrance in TiO2 crystal formation [46]. Similarly, for MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs-MMT/TiO2 nano-composites, the XRD patterns are similar to pure anatase phase TiO2. The sharp peak of MWCNTs at 2θ = 26.63° was not appeared in XRD patterns of MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs-MMT/TiO2 catalysts, probably due to uniform dispersion and lower concentration of MWCNTs. This would also be due to overlapping with (1 0 1) peak of crystalline TiO2 NPs [47]. Further information regarding nano-composite heterojunction was obtained by Raman spectroscopy. To identify the phase description of the pure TiO2, MMT/TiO2, MWCNTs-MMT/TiO2 nano-catalysts, Raman spectroscopy technique was used and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . As for the Raman spectra of the pure anatase TiO2, peaks located at 142, 196 and 634 cm−1 can be attributed to Eg(1), Eg(2) and Eg(3), respectively. Similarly, B1g and (A1g + B1g) modes are located at 394, 513 cm−1, respectively, characteristics peaks of anatase phase of TiO2 [45]. The characteristic bands of all the synthesized MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 samples are similar to bare TiO2, which confirms there is no effect on the primary TiO2 crystalline structure. Typically, with the dispersion of functionalized MWCNTs into the TiO2 nano-particles, two peaks were appeared at 1314.95 cm−1 named as disordered-carbon band (D-band) and second peak located around 1593.54 cm−1 named as Graphite-carbon band (G-band). Moreover, MWCNTs or MMT related fundamental modes were not detected in the MWCNTs/TiO2 or MMT-MWCNTs/TiO2 nanocomposite samples. This was possibly due to lower concentration of MWCNTs and uniform distribution of MMT in the TiO2 NPs. However, the Raman signal Eg(1) in all the TiO2 modified samples was shifted towards higher wavenumber with the dispersion of MWCNTs and MMT (e.g., 149 cm−1 for MMT/TiO2). Raman analysis reveals there is a very compact chemical interaction among the MWCNTs and MMT/TiO2 samples, thus confirmed a successful development of MWCNTs-mMT/TiO2 heterojunction composite. The SEM analysis of pure MMT, TiO2/MMT and MWCNTs coupled MMT/TiO2 catalysts is displayed in Fig. 4 . The stacked sheets of pillared MMT with 2D structures are obvious as shown in Fig. 4(a). Similarly, Fig. 4(b) clearly displays the structural morphology of MMT loaded TiO2 NPs. Evidently, MMT 2D sheets were completely delaminated and TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed over the MMT surface, thus developed a 0D/2D TiO2/MMT composite structure. However, the structural morphology of MWCNTs@MMT@TiO2 is much identical to TiO2/MMT NPs, where 1D MWCNTs and 2D MMT are well-dispersed with TiO2 structure to produce heterojunction as illustrated in Fig. 4(c–d). This indicates that photo-catalytic reaction would be increased due to heterojunction of MWCNTs and TiO2 and uniform dispersion over the MMT structure. TEM analysis describes the deep structure and morphology of MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite as depicted in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a–b) highlights that 0D TiO2 NPs with 2D pillared MMT are uniformly distributed as the core/shell heterojunction with 1D MWCNTs. The presence of 2D MMT sheets with TiO2 NPs to fabricate 0D/2D TiO2/MMT catalyst is clearly identified in Fig. 5(c), which makes a good junction with 1D MWCNTs. The TEM image of MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite in Fig. 5(d) presents a clear interface between MMT/TiO2 and MWCNTs, which highlights a strong connection between 1D/0D/2D MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT composite sample. The nano-composite displays lattice spacing for TiO2 of 0.35 nm, analogous to plane (1 0 1) anatase phase of TiO2. These observations have confirmed successful fabrication of 1D/0D/2D MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction through facile sol-gel assisted hydrothermal methods. The summary of surface areas, pore volumes and pore diameters of the TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 samples are presented in Table 1 . As it can be seen that BET surface area of pure MWCNTs is 191 m2/g, much higher than TiO2 and MMT having SBET of 43 and 2 m2/g, respectively. Similarly, the BET surface areas for 5 wt% MWCNTs/TiO2, 10 wt% MMT-TiO2 and 5% MWCNTs-10% MMT/TiO2 photocatalyts were 82, 52 and 54 m2/g, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of MWCNTs/MMT loaded TiO2 samples, there was no significant impact on the pore volumes but the pore diameter of the TiO2 NPs was effected with the modification of MMT and MWCNTs. The pore diameter obtained over TiO2 was 10.5 nm, which was slightly decreased to 9 nm in MMT/TiO2 but increased to 21.8 and 12.3 nm in MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2, respectively. This information indicated that the presence of MMT has a great influence on the TiO2 NPs crystal growth but has no significant effect to enhance surface area. To investigate the organic compound (CC) and functional groups deposited over the photo-catalyst surface, FTIR analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 6 . The absorbance spectra recorded for the pure TiO2, MMT, MMT/TiO2 and MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite samples reveal that FTIR peaks generated for the TiO2 were located at 1625 and 3437 cm−1, detecting adsorption of H2O over TiO2 surface and vibration of OH groups. The MMT absorbance spectra display stretching band, appeared at ca. 3635 cm−1, associated with Al2 OH group of three dimensional layer presents in MMT-clay. In addition, there are peaks, centered at 3421 and 1625 cm−1, attributed to hydroxyl (OH) group of H2O molecules on the outer layer of MMT. Additionally, peaks observed at 2930 and 2838 cm−1 show stretching vibration of CH bonds (organic compound) in MMT structure. The absorbance band at 1053 cm−1 indicated the unbalanced vibration of tetra-hyderal layer of SiO2 in MMT. Various peaks in the range of 1000 to 550 cm−1 assigned to Al-IV tetra-hydera and similar vibration bands were observed for MMT-decorated TiO2 and MWCNT@MMT@TiO2 with pure TiO2 at ca. 1053 cm−1, probably due to unequal stretching vibration-band of SiO2 tetra-hydera [48]. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) technique was used to detect the optical properties and absorption bands of TiO2, MMT/TiO2, MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 catalysts as demonstrated in Fig. 7 (a). Pure TiO2 and 10 wt% MMT/TiO2 samples exhibit absorbance curves in the ultra-violet light region. However, the MWCNTs coupled with TiO2 and MMT/TiO2 promote the absorption of visible light illuminations [49]. Moreover, the absorbance spectra shifted towards the visible light region with the dispersion of MWCNTs over the TiO2 and MMT/TiO2, thus narrowing the band gap energy. The band gap energies were evaluated according to plot of (ahν)2 vs photon energy (eV) as shown in Fig. 7(b). The estimated band gap energy values for the TiO2 and MMT/TiO2, MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 were 3.11, 3.12, 2.80 and 2.91 eV, respectively as illustrated in Table 1. This depicted that 1D MWCNTs is a promising material to narrow the band gap energy of TiO2. This might also be due to lower band gap energy of MWCNTs and reduction in the crystallite size of TiO2 nanoparticles. PL analysis is an efficient technique to investigate the separation of photo-generated charges, optic properties of nano-structured semiconductors and more importantly get information about the surface oxygen vacancies. The PL emission signals of synthesized TiO2, MWCNTs/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 , excited at wavelength 325 nm. It is observed that with the introduction of MMT and MWCNTs in TiO2, found similar emission spectra as compared to pure TiO2 and the maximum PL intensity was observed around 550 nm. The PL emitted modes can be associated with the transformation of electrons (e−) from the oxygen vacancies to TiO2 VB. However, the peak intensity of MWCNTs/TiO2 and MMT modified MWCNTs/TiO2 samples continuously enfeebled compared to the bare TiO2. The lower peak intensity of composite hetero-structured catalyst was due to possibilities of suppression of recombination rate of photo-excited charge carriers (e−/h+) over the TiO2 surface [45,50]."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production 3.2.1 Effect of MWCNTs on the activity of MMT/TiO2 catalyst The effect of MMT and MWCNTs on the performance of TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light at different irradiation time using glycerol as scavenger is presented in Fig. 9 . The results show that initially H2 evolution rate was very slow over the pure TiO2 NPs and then gradually increased with time span. The low performance of TiO2 NPs for H2 production was due to high band gap energy (3.2 eV) and high recombination rate of photo-excited charge carrier’s (e−/h+). However, maximum H2 evolution rate obtained over 5 wt% MWCNTs/TiO2 was 1286 ppm/h, which was 4.85 times higher than using pure TiO2. This indicated that coupling 1D MWCNTs with TiO2 NPs provides 1D/0D interactions which improves the light harvesting and electron transport capacity. Thus, this heterojunction would be helpful in reducing the band gap energy and preventing charges recombination rate in the TiO2 structure, thus photocatalytic activity was enhanced. Similarly, H2 production rate observed over 10 wt% MMT/TiO2 nano-catalyst was 619 ppm/h, 2.33 folds higher than using pure TiO2. More importantly H2 production was not detected over the pure MMT from glycerol-water mixture under the same operating conditions. This revealed that modification of TiO2 with multilayered MMT-clay improves TiO2 dispersion and enables faster charges separation due to the presence of metals ions inside MMT galleries, consequently promotes the photo-catalytic efficiency towards H2 production. The optimum concentration of 5 wt% MWCNTs and 10 wt% MMT in TiO2 structure shows higherst photo-activity towards H2 generation. However, photo-catalytic activity of nano-catalysts towards hydrogen generation was decreased with an excessive loading of MWCNTs and MMT, probably due to origination of charges recombination centers (e− or h+) inside nano-structured photocatalyst. The H2 evolution rate was further improved by co-loading of MWCNTs and MMT in TiO2 samples. The maximum H2 production rate over MWCNTs supported MMT/TiO2 heterojunction was 1888 ppm/h, significantly higher than MWCNTs/TiO2, TiO2/MMT and TiO2 nano-catalysts. This enhanced in productivity was due to fabrication of 1D MWCNTs/2D MMT coupled with 0D TiO2 NPs which greatly improved the photogenerated charges separation for enhnaced molecular H2 production [51]. Therefore, photocatalytic activity boosted over ternary photo-catalyst would be due to enhanced visible light harvesting and effective migration of photo-excited charges over the nano-structured TiO2 surface due to synergy effect of 1D-MWCNTs and 2D-MMT-clay heterojunction with 0D TiO2 NPs. 3.2.2 Effect of hole scavenger substrate The photocatalytic performance of designed MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite towards H2 evolution over different sacrificial reagents such as ethanol, methanol, propanol and ethylene glycol is presented in Fig. 10 . The maximum H2 evolution rate observed over MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite was 153 ppm/h using pure water mixture. However, H2 production rate was greatly enhanced using sacrificial reagent which was 1.3 to 7.3 times higher than using pure water. The hydrogen formation rate of 1157, 947, 446, 310 and 210 ppm were obtained using glycerol, ethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol with 5% (v/v) concentration, respectively. The results exhibited that glycerol, ethylene glycol and methanol show increasing trend towards H2 generation as compared to the other alcohols such as iso-propanol and ethanol. The yield of H2 does not maximize with the long chain alcohols which exhibited that H2 generation was not originated from the utilization of all H2 atoms present in the alcohols. However, molecular H2 production rate relatively based on the presence of total α-hydrogen atoms, for example in molecular structure of glycerol, ethylene glycol and methanol all the carbon atoms attached to the α-hydrogen atoms reflected high efficiency for H2 production as compared to ethanol and 2-propanol. Besides, polarity of alcohols also impact the proficiency of H2 formation which was higher in the order glycerol (C3H8O3) > ethylene glycerol (C2H6O2) > methanol (CH4O) > ethanol (C2H6O) > 2-propanol (C3H8O) [52]. 3.2.3 Effect of glycerol concentration The performance of MWCNTs/MMT modified TiO2 was further investigated using different glycerol concentrations and the results are presented in Fig. 11 . The initial glycerol concentration in the water mixture greatly affects the hydrogen evolution rate. The highest H2 formation of 37760 ppm/g-cat h was obtained using 5% (v/v) aqueous glycerol solution, which was 1.60 times higher than 1% (v/v) and 1.14 folds higher than 10% (v/v) glycerol-water concentration. Usually, the photocatalytic molecular H2 evolution was dominated by the reactions occurring at the interface of the semiconductor nanomaterials surface and aqueous solution. The rate of H2 generation found to be declined above 5 vol% glycerol concentration. This was probably due to higher concentrations of glycerol saturated the active sites of the catalyst surface. In general, at lower concentration of glycerol less than 5% (v/v), these reactions are directly influenced by the glycerol mass-transportation from aqueous medium to the photo-catalyst surface. However, with the further addition in glycerol as a sacrificial reagent at the optimum concentration, consequently, the surface blockage of the heterojunction composite that restrains its ability to absorb the visible light irradiations. Therefore, optimal concentration of sacrificial reagents would be employed to get high performance of photo catalyst towards hydrogen production. 3.2.4 Performance comparison and photocatalytic turn over productivity The comparison of H2 production rate over the MWCNTs/TiO2, MMT/TiO2 and MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 composites is summarized in Table 2 . Evidently, with the introduction of MWCNTs in MMT/TiO2 significantly promotes the photo-catalytic behavior of the catalyst. The production rate of H2 over 5% MWCNTs-10% MMT/TiO2 was highest among several other prepared photocatalysts. The highest amount of hydrogen recorded from MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 photocatalyst was 37760 ppm/g-cat h, which was 1.49 and 3.07 times higher as compared to MWCNTs/TiO2, MMT/TiO2 and product rate was exceed to 7.12 times when compared with the pure TiO2. The H2 production efficiency through photocatalysis was enhanced in order of MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 > MWCNTs/TiO2 > MMT/TiO2 > TiO2. Thus, after coupling with MMT and MWCNTs, the photocatalytic activity of MMT-modified MWCNTs/TiO2 significantly enhanced which probably due to synergy between 2-D MMT and 1-D MWCNTs inside the TiO2 structure. Photocatalytic turn over productivity (PTOP) is an efficient way to determine photocatalytic performance at ambient conditions and favorable for slurry phase reactions system. The PTOP calculations have been computed for the first time for H2 production. The photo-catalytic energy efficiency is considered as essential factor for computing the performance of different photocatalysts in terms of energy consumption to obtain a specific product. However, the yield of product per unit of energy used during photocatalytic H2 synthesis can be described as if one photon of energy is used for per unit active surface area to create one electron/hole pair, the ratio of photons flux (eV) transformed into electrons (e−) to generate a product as explained by mathematical formula in Eq. (1). (1) PTOP = Production r a t e ( μ mole / g s ) Specific s u r f a c e a r e a ( m 2 / g ) . p h o t o n f l u x μ mole / m 2 s The moles of photon flux (eV) determined from the visible-light as energy source input of intensity 20 mWcm−2 and wavelength around 550 nm. The PTOP comparison of different nano-catalysts is concluded in Table 2. The highest PTOP observed over MWCNTs-MMT/TiO2 was 6.15 × 10−5, which was 5.94 times higher than bare TiO2 and 3.23 and 2.26 folds higher than MMT/TiO2 and MWCNTs/TiO2 samples. PTOP values of different samples under the same photon energy flux for H2 evolution rate are different due to catalyst synergistic effects. This was obviously due to developments of heterojunctions with 1D/0D/2D structure and faster charge carrier’s separation with suppression of recombination rate. The performance of MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 photocatalyst for H2 production was further compared with the recent articles reported by many researchers as presented in Table 3 . The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance over CuS/TiO2 synthesized by solution chemistry route catalyst under visible light irradiations was very low [53]. The photo-catalytic H2 evolution rate was reported in smaller amounts over In/Cu co-doped ZnS photo-catalyst. The highest rate of H2 obtained was 131.3 µmol/h [54]. Recently, ZnO modified by gold to find the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate using slurry type photoreactor system. The product detected was H2 but in trace amount [55]. Similarly, H2 evolution performance under visible light responsive has been reported over Au/GO/TiO2 catalyst [56]. Although, in previous reports, the H2 yield rate reported was not much convincing, we reported photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over Ni loading MMT/TiO2 under UV-light irradiation with H2 yield of 3430 µmole gcat−1h−1 [45]. However, in the current study, MWCNTs@TiO2@MMTs exhibited good efficiency for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiations. In the presence of glycerol as sacrificial reagent, photocatalytic H2 efficiency was further enhanced. Therefore, these results proved that ternary MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 nano-catalyst is an effective photo catalyst under visible light illumination for H2 generation due to enormous advantages such as light harvesting, excellent separation of photo-excited charges and remarkable transmission of photo-induced charges over the TiO2 surface. This enhanced photocatalytic performance of MWCNTs supported MMT/TiO2 structure is schematically displayed in Fig. 12 . In case of pure TiO2 nano-particles, there exists a possibility of rapid recombination of photo-excited electrons, probably due to absence of electron sink. However, in 0D/2D TiO2/MMT sample, high recombination rate of photo-originated charge carriers is partially hindered by the presence of transition metals ions (M+) in 2-dimentional MMT narrow galleries. The collision between TiO2 sample conduction band and metals ions (M+) in MMT layers significantly promoted the separation of photogenerated charge carrier’s. With the dispersion of photosensitizer such as MWCNTs over MMT/TiO2 shows tremendous separation of photoexcited electrons which leads to promote the photocatalytic activity towards H2 production as evidenced by PL analysis. However, the electrons (e−) captured by metal ions (M+) within the narrow layers of 2-D MMT will be directly migrated towards the MWCNTs for formation of H2. Evidently, TiO2 would be able to significantly enhance the performance for dynamic hydrogen production due to synergistic effect among MWCNTs and MMT with 1D/2D heterojunction. 3.2.5 Stability analysis of composite catalyst The stability investigation of photo-catalysts is essential for systematic and practical applications. The photo-stability study of MWCNTs fabricated MMT/TiO2 composite for effective photo-catalytic hydrogen generation over visible-light spectra using glycerol aqueous solution was inspected to detect the life-cycle of photo-catalyst under steady operating conditions. Typically, stability experiments were carried out in cyclic-runs over slurry phase photo-reactor system under normal operating conditions. Prior to starting next cyclic-run, the pyrex glass photo-reactor was flushed using N2 gas at the rate of 15 mL/min for half an hour to eliminate the hydrogen in the system. The yield of hydrogen under visible light irradiation in cyclic runs is presented in Fig. 13 , which depicts that in the first run after 4 h, the evolution rate of H2 increased gradually and attained steady state over the entire irradiation time. In second cyclic run, catalyst remained stable and production rate was consistent after 8 h. In the third cyclic-run after 12 h of irradiation time, heterojunction composite continuously generated molecular H2 gas. In the fourth-cyclic experiment, the photo-activity of catalyst relatively decreased but there was consistent evolution of H2 achieved. This specified that MWCNTs fabricated MMT/TiO2 heterojunction composite is stable for efficient H2 production in a slurry phase reactor system. 3.2.6 Schematic mechanism for hydrogen production Firstly, when TiO2 is illuminated with light irradiations, excited electrons (e−) move from valance band (VB) to conduction band (CB) and create holes (h+) in the VB of TiO2. Secondly, these photo-generated electrons immediately migrated to MMT sheets which works as a mediator due to lower potential energy than ECB of TiO2 [45], and ultimately transmitted to MWCNTs, which have excellent electrons accepting and transmitting properties. The significantly enhanced light and electron arresting properties of MWCNTs allow its use as a photo-sensitizer, helpful in the separation of charge carriers (e− and h+) and narrowing the band gap of TiO2 to 2.91 eV as evidenced by UV–vis and PL-spectra analysis. To visualize the synergistic effect of MWCNTs and MMT-clay, the schematic diagram of the heterojunction composite and molecular H2 formation mechanism from glycerol-water mixture is presented in Fig. 14 . As discussed above, the photo-generated electrons transmit from conductance band of TiO2 to MMT and then towards MWCNTs. However, this transmission phenomenon depends on the work function or conduction band energy (ECB) vs NHE. The ECB = −0.50 eV is more negative than the H+/H2 redox couple (−0.41 eV vs. NHE at pH = 7), whereas EVB = +2.70 eV of TiO2 is more positive than O2/H2O redox potential (+1.23 eV vs. NHE), so TiO2 catalyst meet the required criteria for H2 formation through water splitting. The photo-excited electrons from CB of TiO2 are trapped by MMT because of the (M+) metal ions in the multi layered MMT and then transferred to core structure of MWCNTs having work function nearly 4.3 to 5.1 eV greater than TiO2 [57]. Therefore, reduction reaction would occur at MWCNTs, which gives electrons to H+ ions and produces molecular hydrogen gas. On the other hand, holes (h+) occupied by sacrificial reagent (glycerol) donate electrons (e−) might be act as an electron donor to complete the holes position in the valance band of TiO2. Therefore, this synergistic effect exhibited the improved H2 generation over MWCNTs@MMT@TiO2 ternary composite."
9,Conclusions,"MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT ternary heterojunction composite was synthesized via single step sol-gel and impregnation methods and tested in slurry phase photo-reactor using glycerol aqueous mixture for dynamic hydrogen evolution. The highest product rate of H2 was achieved with MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 photocatalyst than several other composite photocatalysts, which exhibits 7.12 folds more H2 generation (1888 ppm/h) compared to bare TiO2 (250 ppm/h). The synergistic effect within MWCNTs and MMT promotes visible light absorption and photo-excited charge carrier’s separation for efficient H2 production. Hydrogen production has been enhanced significantly with the addition of sacrificial reagents such as alcohols promoting the photo-catalytic activity. The photocatalytic turn over productivity (PTOP) exhibited effective consumption of photon flux energy (eV) and specific surface area by photocatalyst in the presence of glycerol water mixture. The highest photocatalytic turnover productivity achieved over MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 ternary composite, 5.94 times higher than PTOP obtained over the TiO2. The long term stability test revealed MWCNTs/MMT/TiO2 heterojunction composite sustained photocatalytic activity for H2 generation upto 4 cyclic runs. Therefore, this work reflects the importance of dynamic and photostable MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite for efficient H2 production from glycerol-water mixture under visible light irradiation."
