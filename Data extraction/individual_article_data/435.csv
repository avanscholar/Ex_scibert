0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) evolution from photocatalytic water splitting has attracted great interest [1–6]. Among the different photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) offers several advantages, including ease of production from nitrogen-rich compounds, good thermal and chemical stability, and strong visible absorption [7–9]. However, its photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance is still limited partly because of its fast electron–hole recombination [10–12]. Various strategies have been developed accordingly, and they include structure and morphology control [13–15], heterojunction formation [16], and use of cocatalysts [17–19]. Using cocatalysts, such as noble metals [20], can promote charge separation and increase active reaction sites. Although noble metals show strong performance, their scarcity and high cost limit their application [2]. Photocatalytic H2 evolution over g-C3N4 can be promoted by noble metal cocatalysts through the formation of a Schottky barrier between g-C3N4 and the deposited high work functions of metals (Pt = 5.7 eV, Au = 5.3–5.6 eV). When g-C3N4 is under light irradiation, the electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). Induced by the Schottky barrier, the excited electrons further transfer to the metal and are trapped so as to prolong their lifetime. In this process, the excited electrons must overcome the Schottky barrier: that is, the height of the Schottky barrier could affect electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, the height of the Schottky barrier between the metal and g-C3N4 should be regulated for the construction of efficient g–C3N4–based photocatalysts. According to previous reports [17], the Schottky barrier is the difference between the work functions of metals and the electron affinity of the semiconductor CB. The work functions of metals can be tuned through the introduction of other metals with different work functions [18]; hence, the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of g–C3N4–based catalysts may be further enhanced using alloyed cocatalysts instead of their monometallic counterparts. g-C3N4 deposited with alloy particles may show some unique properties that are different from those of g-C3N4 deposited with corresponding mono-metals because of the synergistic effect between the monometallic counterparts. For instance, Zhang et al. achieved excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution performance by using NiMo alloy-modiﬁed g-C3N4 nanocomposites, which were reported to facilitate the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of pure g-C3N4 by about 37 times and matching that of optimized Pt/g-C3N4 [21]. Xie et al. were inspired by the significantly improved performance of NiCoP in the electrocatalysis field and obtained good results with a prepared NiCoP/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic H2 production [22]. Basu et al. enhanced g-C3N4 through in situ incorporation of AgNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs); the as-prepared photocatalysts showed efficient oxygen reduction in an alkaline medium [23]. Nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) NPs show similar characteristics to noble Pt, and their alloys are anticipated to be used as electron capture agents for g-C3N4 to widen the distance between photogenerated electrons and holes in space. In such a case, numerous electrons are allowed to participate in photocatalytic reduction reactions. In the current work, a novel CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was fabricated using an easy chemical reduction approach, in which CoNi alloyed NPs are deposited on g-C3N4 nanosheets. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and stability of CoNi/g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation were measured. The prepared CoNi/g-C3N4 composites showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity relative to mono-metallic Co/g-C3N4, Ni/g-C3N4, and even pure g-C3N4. After the full optimization of the loading ratio of CoNi alloy NPs, CoNi markedly improved the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4, with the H2 evolution rate reaching 354.4 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 136 times higher than that achieved with Co/g-C3N4 and 64 times higher than that obtained with Ni/g-C3N4. To investigate the mechanism that enhances H2 evolution activity in the CoNi/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, we analyzed its structural characteristics and optical properties. On the basis of the characterization results, the increase in photocatalytic activity was attributed primarily to the improved charge transfer and active reaction sites by CoNi. The experimental results demonstrate that CoNi alloy NPs can be effective cocatalysts for g-C3N4. Hence, they may also have potential benefits for other semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 evolution."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals N2H4·H2O was purchased from Nanjing Huangtai Pharmaceutical Technology Co. Ltd. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, CO(NH2)2, and NaOH were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company, Ltd. All chemical reagents were used directly without further purification. The distilled water employed in the experiment was made in the laboratory."
3,Fabrication of g-C3N4 and CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"2.2 Fabrication of g-C3N4 and CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites 2.2.1 Preparation of pure g-C3N4 Exactly 20 g of urea was heated at 80 °C for 24 h. The urea was calcined at 550 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 h. Subsequently, the muﬄe furnace was cooled naturally to room temperature, and the final calcinated powder was collected and ground. Finally, pure g-C3N4 was synthesized. 2.2.2 Preparation of CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites Dissolved 4.0 mmol of g-C3N4 was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred for 0.5 h. Then, 2.0 mL of Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution (0.010 mol/L) and 2 mL of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution (0.010 mol/L) were transferred to the above mentioned mixture and stirred for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Exactly 6.0 mL of 0.05 mol/L N2H4·H2O solution and 4.0 mL of 0.10 mol/L NaOH solution were transferred into the above suspension and further stirred for 1 h. The suspension was added to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 150 °C in an oven for 3 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the resulting nanocomposites were collected by rinsing it with alcohol and deionized water for several times and subjecting it to filtration. It was then dried to constant weight in a vacuum, and samples were collected after final grinding. The samples with CoNi and g-C3N4 of various molar ratios were labeled as x-CoNi/g-C3N4 (x = 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, and 10%). The molar ratio of Ni and Co was fixed to 1:1. And In order to further study the co-catalysis effect of CoNi alloy, we also adjusted the ratio of Co: Ni in 4%-NiCo/g-C3N4 nanocomposite as to 0: 4,1: 3, 3: 1 and 4: 0, respectively. The details of the material characterization, photoelectrochemical measurement, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) evaluation method are given in the Supplementary Information."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology The crystal structures of g-C3N4 and CoNi/g-C3N4 were determined using XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . Two typical peaks of pristine g-C3N4 appeared at 13.1° and 27.4°, and they can be ascribed to the accumulation of layered conjugated aromatic rings on g-C3N4 and the in-plane trigonal nitrogen linkage of tri-s-triazine motifs, respectively [24]. For the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, the intrinsic characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 were also noted, and they indicated that these composites still maintained the primary construction of g-C3N4. Relative to the pristine g-C3N4, the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed decreased diﬀraction intensity possibly because of the deteriorated crystallinity of g-C3N4 in the hydrothermal process. When the molar ratio of Co and Ni increased to 4%, weak typical diﬀraction peaks marked with ⧫ indexed to Co and with ♣ relevant to Ni were detected. These weak peaks matched the diﬀraction pattern of pristine Co and Ni [25]. The XRD peaks of g-C3N4 and CoNi indicated that the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were successfully fabricated. In addition, no obvious Co and Ni diﬀraction peaks were observed in the nanocomposites because of the low Co and Ni content. To determine the metal composition, we measured the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. As shown in Table S1, the molar ratios of CoNi and g-C3N4 remained consistent with the actual addition, thus implying that the loss of CoNi species during the solvothermal process could be ignored. To gain insights into their surface morphologies, the g-C3N4 and 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 samples were checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2 a, g-C3N4 displayed irregular curled nanoplates that were loosely agglomerated and thus resulted in the formation of some holes because of its physical accumulation. After combining Co and Ni with g-C3N4, we observed 3D porous structures, as shown in Fig. 2b. Meanwhile, the SEM mappings of the 10%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite were investigated. As shown in Figure S1, the element mapping of 10%-CoNi/g-C3N4 clearly revealed the presence and homogeneous distributions of C, N, Co, and Ni, which confirmed the formation of the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. The morphologies of g-C3N4 and the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite were further explored using TEM (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Figs. 3(a-b), g-C3N4 generally possessed thin and curly nanosheets with irregular morphology. From the TEM image (Fig. 3a), numerous mesopores were apparent on the surface of 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4, and they were mainly due to the etching effect of NaOH during the thermal treatment. The porous construction of 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 was further proved by the corresponding TEM results and was deemed beneﬁcial for charge transfer. As shown in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b), the CoNi/g-C3N4 composite sample presented a typical thin film morphology with black NPs distributed on the surface. The thin film was attributed to g-C3N4 because of its intrinsic 2D molecular structure. To determine the composition of the black NPs observed on the surface of g-C3N4, we conducted a close investigation by using HRTEM. The results indicated a set of clear lattice fringes, from which a lattice spacing of 0.232 nm was determined. The lattice spacing revealed by the HRTEM matched well with the interplanar crystal spacing of the (010) crystal plane of the CoNi alloy (JCPDS 45-1027). Hence, it provides additional support for the successful synthesis of CoNi/g-C3N4 composites. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were conducted to estimate the speciﬁc surface area and pore size distribution. The as-prepared samples exhibited a type IV profile with H3 hysteresis loops, which suggested the presence of mesopores. As shown in Fig. 4 , the corresponding pore size distribution curves of the four samples exhibited broad peaks at about 2–100 nm, thus further confirming the presence of macropores and mesopores. The results of the BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore size for all samples are shown in Table 1 . When the molar ratio of CoNi and g-C3N4 was less than 4%, the CoNi/g-C3N4 composites showed a smaller specific surface area (SBET) and a larger pore volume than pure g-C3N4. This difference may be attributed to CoNi decorating g-C3N4 and the etching effect of NaOH during the thermal treatment that resulted in porous structures. However, as the molar ratio of CoNi and g-C3N4 was greater than 4%, the CoNi/g-C3N4 composites showed a larger SBET and a smaller pore volume than pure g-C3N4 because some CoNi alloy particles may partially fill the pores in g-C3N4 [20,26]. The analysis clearly demonstrated that surface area and pores did not play a determinative role in the improved photocatalytic activity observed in this study. The XPS spectra of pristine g-C3N4 and 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite are presented in Fig. 5 . The C 1s spectra in Fig. 5a were fitted into three peaks. The two strong peaks of C 1s centered at 284.7 and 288.1 eV for g-C3N4 and at 284.9 and 288.3 eV for 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4. These peaks were attributed to the sp2 bond in the graphitic carbon groups and sp2 carbon in the N–CN aromatic nuclei, respectively [27]. The small peak at 286.2 eV for g-C3N4 and at 286.4 eV for 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 was ascribed to the sp3-coordinated carbon (C–N) [28]. The N 1s of g-C3N4 and 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 was deconvoluted into four peaks, as shown in Fig. 5b. The peak at 398.5 eV was ascribed to the sp2-hybridized N atom (CN–C). The third peak centered at 399.3 eV was ascribed to the bridging nitrogen atoms of the formation of H–N−(C)2 or N−(C)3. As three C atoms bonded to quaternary N in triazine rings, the sample showed a weak peak at 400.9 eV [29]. Interestingly, these three N peaks of 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 slightly shifted toward the positive binding energies at 398.6, 399.6, and 401.0 eV. Fig. 5c and d shows the Co 2p and Ni 2p spectra. The Ni 2p XPS spectrum for the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 sample showed peaks at 781.1, 796.5, 855.7, and 873.7 eV, which respectively belonged to the Co 2p3/2, Co 2p1/2, Ni 2p3/2, and Ni 2p1/2 signals of Co(II) and Ni(II) species on g-C3N4. Co(II) and Ni(II) are paramagnetic, thus giving rise to the additional “shake-up” satellite features at 6 eV above the main Co 2p3/2, Co 2p1/2, Ni 2p3/2, and Ni 2p1/2 characteristic peaks. These observations demonstrated that in addition to CoNi alloy NPs, small amounts of Co(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 were loaded on the surface of g-C3N4. The XPS spectra of metallic Co0 2p and divalent Co2+ 2p are usually located at 780.7 and 796.1 eV and at 781.7 and 797.2 eV, respectively [30]. Meanwhile, the XPS spectra of metallic Ni0 2p and divalent Ni2+ 2p are usually located at 853.4 and 870.0 eV and at 857.0 and 874.8 eV, respectively [31]. However, the binding energies of Co and Ni in our experiments were respectively centered at 781.0 and 796.5 eV and at 855.7 and 873.7 eV. These locations were between those of Co0 2p and divalent Co2+ and between those of Ni0 2p and divalent Ni2+ 2p. We ascribed the shift to two aspects: the alloying effect between metallic Co0 and Ni0 and the existence of a small amount of hydroxide of Co and Ni [32–34]."
6,Optical absorption properties,"3.2 Optical absorption properties Fig. 6 shows the electronic absorption spectra of the different samples. The absorption edge of pure g-C3N4 was located at 443 nm. Relative to g-C3N4, the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibited a systematic red-shift in the absorption edge because of the decoration of Co and Ni. For example, the absorption edge of the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite moved up to 464 nm. The forbidden band of pristine g-C3N4 and 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was obtained by the Kubelka–Munk curve, and the calculated results were 2.79 and 2.67 eV, respectively. With the increasing CoNi alloy, the absorption of nanocomposites in the visible light range obviously increased. The intensity at 580–650 nm of the 5%-CoNi/g-C3N4 and 6%-CoNi/g-C3N4 samples was induced by the transitions of the electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to CoNi alloy under light illumination. This transfer of charges between the interfaces induced light trapping and thus further produced photoinduced electron–hole pairs for improved photocatalytic activity [35]. When the CoNi content was lower than 5%, the UV–Vis DRS reflectance spectra was found to be consistent with the spectrum of pure g-C3N4 because of the CoNi metal content being too low and the dispersion being too high. With the increase of CoNi metal content, the color of the samples gradually darkened (e.g., 8%-CoNi/g-C3N4 and 10%-CoNi/g-C3N4), which led to the increased intensity of light absorption at all measured wavelengths (Figure S3). An enhanced light harvest ability is conducive to the production of available photoinduced carriers and improvement of the performance of photocatalytic H2 evolution. However, the light intensity of the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 sample was weaker than that of 10%-CoNi/g-C3N4, and the H2 production of 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 was the highest. Hence, light absorption ability is not the unique determinant of high-efficiency photocatalytic performance."
7,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.3 Photoelectrochemical properties Photocurrent densities were measured to understand the photoinduced charge separation and transport process. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the photocurrent responses of g-C3N4 and CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with an interval time were carried out under visible light irradiation. All the photocatalysts exhibited a sensitive response to light strikes, and the current densities showed minimal change with the number of cycles; hence, the as-prepared samples had good structural stability [36]. The 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 exhibited the highest photocurrent density, which implied its eﬃcient photogenerated carrier generation and transportation [37]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further applied to the photoinduced interfacial charge immigration rate. In the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7b), the pristine g-C3N4 showed a large arc radius. The impedance arc radius of the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was smaller than that of the pristine g-C3N4, and the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed a minimum arc radius. This result indicated that an improved charge transfer was obtained through the introduction of CoNi to g-C3N4, and the outcome matched the photocurrent results well [2]. Therefore, the surface charge transfer in 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 was strongest among all the samples [2]. Fig. 7c illustrates the LSV polarization curves for bare g-C3N4 and CoNi/g-C3N4 hybrids with a sweep rate of 10 mV/s. The CoNi/g-C3N4 hybrids showed higher electrocatalytic activity than the pristine g-C3N4 sheets, and the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites achieved the optimal value. These results indicated that the CoNi cocatalyst loading could effectively reduce the overpotential and accelerate the electrocatalytic H2 evolution kinetics of the CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites [38]. The intensity of PL can reflect the extent of recombination of photogenerated charges. As shown in Fig. 8 , g-C3N4 possessed a serious charge recombination. When a cocatalyst CoNi was loaded, the PL was drastically quenched. Obviously, the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in g-C3N4 can be suppressed by transferring electrons to CoNi as the electron acceptor. The lowest spectrum intensity of PL was observed after loading 4% CoNi. The outcome was in agreement with the HER results (see Fig. 9). To understand and gain quantitative insights into the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism in a g-C3N4 system, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy measurements on all samples. The average lifetime of two exponential decays is essential to describe the overall TRPL characteristic [39,40]; it is calculated by the following equation: < τ > = ∑ i = 1,2 A i τ i 2 ∑ i = 1,2 A i τ i where <τ> is the average lifetime and A i and τ i are the amplitude (pre-exponential factor) and TRPL decay time of the individual components, respectively. The fluorescence lifetimes were acquired by fitting the decay profiles with two exponential terms (Fig. 8b). Apparently, the average lifetime of 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 (7.2713 ns) was longer than that of g-C3N4 (4.7676 ns) and thus indicated the effective electron transfer from CB of g-C3N4 to the CoNi alloy NPs. These results further indicated that the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 sample was more beneficial for electron transfer."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance The influence of CoNi alloy on the H2 evolution of CoNi/g-C3N4 was investigated under visible light irradiation by utilizing triethanolamine as the sacriﬁcial reagent. As shown in Fig. 9b, the pristine g-C3N4 displayed a low H2 generation rate of about 1.88 μmol h−1 g−1, which was likely due to the fast recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. When g-C3N4 was modiﬁed with CoNi alloy, the H2 evolution rate was significantly enhanced, particularly for the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 sample that showed a rate of 354.4 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 188 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. Extensive studies have explored photocatalytic water splitting using g–C3N4–based photocatalysts (Table S2). To determine the highest H2 production efficiency, we compared our present results with those of other similar investigations in the literature. Although the photocatalytic performance of 354 μmol h−1 g−1 achieved in this work is lower than those of conventional noble metal cocatalysts loaded on g-C3N4 photocatalysts [41], it is much better than those reported for most g-C3N4 photocatalytic systems decorated by different cocatalysts, such as NiS [42], AuPd [43], and MoS2 [44,45]. The result indicated the excellent synergetic effect of the cocatalyst. To assess the photocatalytic stability and recyclability of the photocatalyst, we conducted seven cycle tests by using the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (Fig. 10 ). The photocatalytic activities did not show much decay in the first five cycles. By contrast, the HER activities showed a slight reduction after five cycles. The difference may be explained as follows. As the reaction proceeded, a part of the surface active sites was covered by some other intermediates, which caused the decrease in H2 production efficiency. Sufficient CoNi is obviously needed in enhancing carrier separation and increasing reactive sites. However, too much CoNi covering g-C3N4 may block eﬀective light absorption [46]. Thus, 4% CoNi seems to be optimal for photocatalytic H2 production. To determine the effect of the molar ratio of Co to Ni on the photocatalytic activity of CoNi/g-C3N4, we performed a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test for 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 (molar ratio of Co: Ni = 1:1), 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 (molar ratio of Co: Ni = 1:3), 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 (molar ratio of Co: Ni = 3:1), 4%-Co/g-C3N4, and 4%-Ni/g-C3N4 (Fig. 11 a). When the molar ratio of Co to Ni was 1:1, the maximum rate of H2 evolution was achieved. Thereafter, the rate of H2 evolution decreased with increasing Ni. This result may be ascribed to the change of the Schottky barrier between g-C3N4 and the CoNi alloy. To further study the effect of CoNi loading (such as N2H4·H2O solution, NaOH solution, and hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C) on the properties of g-C3N4, we fabricated 0%-CoNi/g-C3N4 by using the same method as that for the synthesis of x-CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites without the addition of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. Then, the photocatalytic water splitting performances for H2 evolution were evaluated under visible light irradiation. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of photocatalytic H2 evolution amounts over the g-C3N4, 0%-CoNi/g-C3N4, and 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 samples. The 0%-CoNi/g-C3N4 photocatalyst had slightly higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C3N4, but it was still lower than that of the 4%-CoNi/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. A possible reason is that the 0%-CoNi/g-C3N4 showed numerous apparent mesopores on the surface and was fluffier than g-C3N4 (Fig. 11b) because of the etching effect of NaOH during the thermal treatment, which can provide additional active sites for photocatalytic reaction."
9,Photocatalytic HER mechanism of CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"3.5 Photocatalytic HER mechanism of CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites A probable mechanism for the improved photocatalytic H2 production using CoNi/g-C3N4 was proposed. Fig. 12 a shows the electrochemical Mott–Schottky (MS) plots. The slope of the C−2-E plot was positive, which indicated that g-C3N4 was a typical n-type semiconductor. The flat-band potential (Vfb) of g-C3N4 was obtained from the intercept of the tangents of the linear potential curves on the horizontal axis; it could be estimated to be −1.63 V vs. SCE. The potentials referred to the SCE electrode were converted to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by using the equation ENHE = ESCE + 0.24 [47]. The flat-band potential (Vfb) of g-C3N4 versus NHE was −1.39 eV. Generally, the bottom of the CB is more negative by −0.2 V than Vfb for n-type semiconductors. The ECB of g-C3N4 vs. NHE was −1.41 eV. Meanwhile, the VB edge potential can be determined by ECB = EVB − Eg [48], that is, 1.38 eV vs. NHE. As shown in Fig. 12b, after the CoNi alloy was deposited onto g-C3N4, a Schottky junction might have formed between CoNi and g-C3N4. In this case, the junction promoted the rapid separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs and thus enhanced the water splitting activities [2]. The work functions of Co and Ni (WCo and WNi) were ~5.0 and 5.15 eV, respectively. The work function of the CoNi alloy (WCoNi) can be calculated as follows: WCoNi = xWCo + (1−x)WNi (where x denotes the proportion of Co in the CoNi alloy) [49,50]. According to this calculation, WCoNi should be 5.08 eV. The work function of g-C3N4 was about 4.5 eV, which was smaller than that of WCoNi; this result showed that electrons can be transferred from g-C3N4 to CoNi bimetallic alloy [51,52]. Upon visible light, photoinduced electrons and holes suddenly formed in the CB and VB of g-C3N4, respectively. As the Fermi level of CoNi was more negative than the CB edge of g-C3N4 and the two materials had good contact, the photoelectrons in g-C3N4 shifted quickly to CoNi and then participated in the H2 evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the holes in the VB of g-C3N4 were scavenged by triethanolamine, thus reducing charge carrier recombination. Moreover, the hierarchical nanostructure of CoNi/g-C3N4 with a large surface-to-volume ratio provided a high density of reactive sites. Therefore, the CoNi/g-C3N4 photocatalyst demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved photocatalytic H2 generation over g-C3N4."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were fabricated and evaluated for H2 evolution. The CoNi/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with a 1:1 Co-to-Ni ratio and 4% CoNi-to-g-C3N4 ratio showed the highest photocatalytic H2 production eﬃciency. The optimized CoNi/g-C3N4 showed a favorable H2 generation rate of 354.4 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light. This rate was about 188 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The obviously improved photocatalytic activities were attributed to the introduction of the CoNi alloy cocatalyst that improved the charge transfer and active reaction sites. This work demonstrates a new noble metal-free CoNi/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for high efficiency H2 generation."
