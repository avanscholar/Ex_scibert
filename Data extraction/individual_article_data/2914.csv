0,Introduction,"Sufficient energy supply is one of the major issues in our growing modern society. In 2016, the world's energy consumption already amounted to 577.92 EJ. Of this value, 81% was delivered by non-sustainable fossil fuels, resulting in a global CO2 emission of 32.1 Gt. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted that the global energy demand will exceed 810 EJ following the current policies scenario (CPS) [1]. This will most probably give a strong driving force for global warming if no additional measures are taken. In order to meet the scenario in which the temperature rise stays below 2 °C, renewable energy sources must play a more important role. The largest disadvantage of these resources is their variable nature over short periods of time, and the fact that the energy production and demand are not at all perfectly synchronized [2]. In that context the scientific community is showing ever-increasing interest in sustainable energy carriers such as H2 to store and buffer the fluctuations in energy production and demand. This molecule is recognized worldwide as a promising energy vector. It benefits from a high energy conversion efficiency and ease of conversion in different forms of energy [3,4]. Besides, the required infrastructure, skills and regulations are already (partly) available. E.g. 40% of the European households already uses gas heating systems, that could allow H2 usage as well. Hydrogen storage is often more cost efficient than battery storage and recharges 15 times faster, leading to smaller charging infrastructure [5]. The major downside is that nowadays, it is still produced for about 95% from fossil fuels since other production technologies are not yet fully mature [6]. Nonetheless, direct water splitting technologies are heavily studied to provide a short-to-medium term solution. In these technologies H2 and O2 are simultaneously evolved from water molecules (eq. (1)), with basically no undesired side-reactions [4]. It is even stated by Hydrogen Europe that without water-derived H2, deep decarbonization (>80%) will be impossible [5]. (1) 2 H2O (l) → 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) (ΔH = 286 kJ mol−1) With ΔH the change in enthalpy. Electrochemical methods are considered as one of the most efficient ways to provide the required energy for this endothermal reaction. In addition, since solar power is the most abundant renewable energy source (every second about 1.2 × 1014 kJ reaches the Earth's surface [7]) photoelectrochemical (PEC) and direct photocatalytic water splitting are studied extensively as well [8]. It is even called one of the ‘Holy Grails’ of chemistry [9]. Next to energy, the other crucial resource is water. Unfortunately, considering the population growth, the availability of fresh water as a feedstock becomes problematic. Hence, it would be better to use abundant seawater, that accounts for ca. 97% of the water on Earth [10]. Another advantage is the fact that (sea)water is quite evenly distributed throughout the globe, allowing to decrease the dependence on fossil fuel producing countries [10]. On the other hand, the use of seawater imposes important technological challenges due to the abundant presence of various ions (Table 1 ), averaging 3.5 wt% in total [10]. Both photocatalytic as well as (photo)electrochemical seawater splitting research has been evolving rapidly over the last years. While a very limited number of overview articles is available on one given technology in particular [11–13], to the best of our knowledge a concise, comparative overview of the current state of the art in these different fields is lacking. In this review these technologies will be compared, starting from their basic fundamental principles, followed by a comparison between their overall efficiencies and resulting costs for H2 production. In subsequent sections, the seawater selectivity, stability and other influencing factors will be discussed in more detail. A particular focus lies on recent technological developments for dealing with saline media in view of their application in seawater. Note that in this review only direct seawater utilization is considered, i.e. without prior desalination of the water. Certainly in applications with space constraints (e.g. ships), a prior desalination step would be inadvisable [10]. Besides, more specific (bio-based) niche-technologies such as microbial processes with cyanobacteria [14], phototrophic [15] and dark-acidogenic bacteria [16], the decomposition of H2S from the Black Sea [17] and the hydrolysis of Mg species in seawater [18] are not considered in this overview. The interested reader is kindly referred to the corresponding references, as well as an excellent review article by Fukuzumi et al. (2017) [19]."
1,Basic principles,"The following section briefly discusses the fundamentals behind electrolytic, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Readers already familiar with the basic principles of each technology are welcome to directly proceed to the next section."
2,Electrolytic water splitting,"2.1 Electrolytic water splitting Volta was probably one of the first to open up the electrolysis research domain with the discovery of his voltaic pile in 1799. A few months later, Carlisle and Nicholson applied this setup for the first time as a water splitting electrolysis cell (EC) [20]. The pile consisted of a series of copper and zinc plates (the electrodes) separated by cardboard layers soaked in salt water (the electrolyte) [21,22]. In a standard EC, an external voltage is applied to the electrodes to drive the different redox half reactions. These electrodes are connected by an electronic circuit to enable the flow of electrons. The ionic conductivity is further guaranteed by the electrolyte [23]. Nowadays, different types of ECs exist with low temperature acidic polymeric electrolyte membrane ECs (PEMECs, Fig. 1 a) and liquid electrolyte alkaline ECs (AECs) as the most established ones [10]. Other types of ECs such as anion exchange membrane (AEM) and high temperature solid oxide (SO) ECs will not be discussed here in detail for the sake of brevity. The reader is kindly referred to the reviews of Vincent et al. (2017) [24] and Laguna-Bercero (2012) [25] for more information on those particular topics. The extreme pH conditions in simple PEMECs and AECs result from the addition of strong electrolytes like H2SO4 or NaOH and KOH [26]. Note that their addition is not strictly required in seawater due to the natural occurrence of ions. Nonetheless, it is still often done to increase the ionic conductivity [27–29]. At the anode in a PEMEC, water is oxidized to oxygen (Oxygen Evolution Reaction, OER, eq. (2)). The released electrons and protons are then transferred to the cathode via the electronic circuit and the polymeric membrane, respectively. Here, they combine to form H2 (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, HER, eq. (3)). In AECs on the other hand, hydroxide anions are oxidized to oxygen gas at the anode (eq. (4)) and water is reduced at the cathode (eq. (5)) [7]. (2) Acidic OER: 2 H2O (l) → O2 (g) + 4 e− + 4 H+ (3) Acidic HER: 4 e− + 4 H+ → 2 H2 (g) (4) Basic OER: 4 OH− → O2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) + 4 e− (5) Basic HER: 4 H2O (l) + 4 e− → 2 H2 (g)+ 4 OH− The absolute minimum theoretical voltage is 1.23 V vs. SHE (Standard Hydrogen Electrode) for water splitting at room temperature. This corresponds to the difference between the redox potentials of the respective half reactions at a given pH. However, a larger potential is applied to ensure a sufficient reaction rate, denoted as the ‘overpotential’ (η). Obviously, the goal is to minimize this excess energy, which is the role of the electrocatalyst [7]. For PEMECs, the best performing electrocatalysts are Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) (Pd > Pt ≈ Rh > Ir > Re > Os > Ru > Ni) at the cathode and IrO2 or RuO2 at the anode [30]. In AECs, mostly first row transition metals (e.g. Ni, Mn, Fe, Co etc.) or their alloys are used as electrocatalysts for the HER [7], while oxides or (oxy)hydroxides are found at the anode [31]."
3,Photocatalytic water splitting,"2.2 Photocatalytic water splitting Photocatalysis research started nearly two centuries after the discovery of electrolysis. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda observed for the first time the water splitting capacity of TiO2 under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [34]. In this domain, semiconductors (SC) catalyze redox reactions such as the HER and OER simultaneously under illumination. This ability originates from their specific electronic band structure, that consists of a filled valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB) with a small bang gap (E g ) in-between. When the semiconductor is illuminated by light of sufficient energy to overcome the band gap, an electron of the VB is excited to the CB (e− CB), leaving behind a positively charged hole in the VB (h+ VB) (eq. (6)) [35]. The required wavelength for this excitation is determined by the Einstein-Planck relation (eq. (7)) [32]. After migrating to the catalyst surface, the holes can initiate water oxidation (eq. (8)), while the conduction band electrons initiate the reduction of protons (eq. (9)) [32]. (6) SC + h.ν → h+ VB + e− CB (7) E = h.ν = h.c/λ > E g (8) OER: 2 H2O (l) + 4 h+ VB → O2 (g) + 4 H+ (9) HER: 4 H+ + 4 e− CB → 2 H2 (g) With h Planck's constant (6.63 × 10−34 J s), ν the incident light frequency, E the energy content, c the speed of light (300 × 106 m s−1), λ the incident light wavelength and E g the band gap. Whether a SC is suitable for un-biased photocatalytic water splitting is largely determined by the respective positions of the VB and CB edges. The redox potentials of the photogenerated h+ VB and e− CB need to be more positive and more negative than those of the water oxidation and reduction half reactions, respectively. These correspond resp. to +0.83 V vs. SHE and −0.41 V vs. SHE at neutral pH [32]. Band gaps should evidently always be greater than 1.23 eV. The optimal value is determined by the availability of sunlight. It is therefore beneficial to have a band gap in the order of 2.53 eV which matches the wavelength range of maximum solar intensity at the Earth's surface (around 490 nm) [36]. The most common SC is the relatively cheap, chemically stable TiO2 (E g ≈ 3.0–3.2 eV, Fig. 1b). This photocatalyst guarantees water splitting due to its sufficiently strong oxidant h+ VB (2.53 V > 0.83 V vs. SHE) and reductant e− CB (−0.52 V < −0.41 V vs. SHE) [32]. One of the first main drawbacks of TiO2 is its fairly large band gap, that requires excitation by UV light. Other suitable SCs include several oxides, (oxy)sulfides and (oxy)nitrides with d10 cations (e.g. Ga3+, Ge4+, In3+, Sb5+, Sn4+) or d0 transition metal cations (e.g. Mo6+, Nb5+, Ta5+, Ti4+, W6+, Zr4+) [37]. Also Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are studied for their photocatalytic activity. Note that other factors such as diffusion lengths and efficient separation of the charge carriers are important as well. The more efficient, the less recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers occurs (eq. (10)). Recombination processes result in a dramatic decrease in efficiency [32]. (10) h+ VB + e− CB → energy"
4,PEC water splitting,"2.3 PEC water splitting PEC water splitting is situated at the intersection of ECs and photocatalysis. A basic PEC cell configuration (Fig. 1c) consists of a cathode and an anode submerged in an aqueous electrolyte solution [26]. Alike ECs, both electrodes are connected by an external electronic circuit. The difference with ECs lies in the fact that one or two electrodes are photoactive [26]. Important materials for photoanodes and -cathodes are n-type (e.g. TiO2 [38]) and p-type semiconductors (e.g. Cu2O [39]), respectively. Depending on these photocatalysts, a suitable electrolyte is chosen. For example, alkaline electrolytes are the most optimal for TiO2 anodes [26]. If non-photoactive counter electrodes are used, they often consist of Pt [26]. When wide band gap SCs such as TiO2 are utilized, an additional voltage or bias is often applied. This is done when the band edges are not suitable for water splitting (e.g. in the case of WO3) [40]. In that case, the photoelectrodes also contain an electrocatalyst to minimize the overpotential [41]. The need for additional energy and other issues will be thoroughly discussed in the following section. A comparison between the different technologies will be made with special attention to the technical issues arising when using seawater."
5,Comparison,"Firstly, the efficiencies that can be attained to date are presented for both technologies. Hereafter, a closer look is taken at the different factors that may influence the efficiency, going from selectivity over stability-related problems, to additional operational requirements. Recent interesting improvements on the level of the catalyst or the reactor will be discussed when relevant."
6,H2 evolution efficiencies and costs,"3.1 H2 evolution efficiencies and costs 3.1.1 Electrolysis Water electrolyzers already perform quite efficiently. The efficiency of mature pure water AECs with a capacity up to 150 MW reaches 82%, while the early market PEMECs (<1 MW) have a 65–78% efficiency [42]. Direct seawater electrolysis on the other hand, attains voltage efficiencies based on the H2 higher heating value (141.5 MJ kg−1) up to 79% [29]. This is yet similar to the 70–85% range of the industrial large scale steam methane reformers (SMR) (150–300 MW) [42]. Although the efficiencies are similar, the costs differ significantly. SMR-derived H2 costs about US$ 1.25 kg−1 for a natural gas price of US$ 3.50 GJ−1. Nowadays, large scale electrolysis plants operate solely on pure water, yielding H2 at a cost of ca. US$ 4.09 kg−1 (coal-powered) [43]. This is slightly above the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of US$ 2.00–4.00 kg−1. The H2 cost consists of the complete power-to-gas installation investment costs (US$ 2009 kW−1 on average), operational costs (US$ 39.5 kW−1), energy costs and water costs (ca. US$ 0.08 kg−1) [44,45]. In contrast to PV-derived H2 (>US$ 5 kg−1 [43]), small-scale wind energy powered H2 production may already hit this target in specific cases (US$ 3.53 kg−1 in Texas) [44]. However, as mentioned earlier, this is only valid when working with pure water. Accurate techno-economic assessments for direct seawater electrolysis are still non-existent and strongly requested. The use of seawater may drastically decrease the cost of water, but increase the electrolyzer costs (e.g. operational EC cost is estimated to increase ≥6-fold without proper stabilization) [13]. d’Amore-Domenech et al. (2020) recently estimated that the lifetime of conventional PGM electrodes would decrease by at least an order of magnitude [13]. Seawater causes several detrimental effects such as Cl2 evolution [46], scaling [47], fouling of membranes [48], corrosion [46] etc. which is especially true for PEMECs that require very pure water [7]. Ren's group recently attained very promising results for alkaline seawater splitting, similar to pure water splitting. Their 3-dimensional core shell metal nitride electrocatalyst achieved industrially required current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 at record low voltages of 1.608 V and 1.709 V, respectively (Fig. 2 a). These results emphasize the potential this research domain has to offer [27]. To complete the overview, a selection of recently developed HER and OER electrocatalysts is presented in Table 2 with parameters quantifying their activity, selectivity and stability in seawater. From this table, it is clear that nowadays already low overpotentials (70–480 mV) allow to operate the HER at useful current densities of about 10 mA cm−2. The OER generally requires higher overpotentials. Finally, it is important to notice that both half reactions can be performed using sustainable PGM-free catalysts, like Ni. The selectivity and stability will be discussed further in the following paragraphs. 3.1.2 Photocatalytic and PEC seawater splitting The H2 yields obtained through electrolytic water splitting are not yet achieved by direct photocatalytic processes. The major reason being the limited available natural solar power, in the order of 100 mW cm−2, commonly denoted as an irradiation intensity of ‘1 sun’. The DOE targeted a Solar-to-Hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 10% as the benchmark for commercialization [40]. This STH can be described according to eq. (11) [63]: (11) S T H ( % ) = o u t p u t e n e r g y i n H 2 i n p u t s o l a r e n e r g y = R H 2 ⋅ Δ G P ⋅ S . 100 % With R H2 the H2 evolution rate, ΔG the Gibbs free energy for the water splitting reaction, P the energy intensity of the used illumination and S the illuminated surface area. For 1 sun illumination and based on the Gibbs free energy (237.13 MJ kg−1 at 25 °C and 1 atm) this corresponds to a H2 production rate of ~150 μmol h−1 cm−2 or a photocurrent density of ~8 mA cm−2 for PEC cells with a theoretical maximal Faradaic efficiency of 100% [64]. To achieve such high efficiency, photocatalysts should be developed with an absorption edge higher than 600 nm and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 60% [65] which is calculated as in eq. (12): (12) A Q Y ( % ) = n u m b e r o f u s e d e l e c t r o n s f o r H 2 n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s = 2 ⋅ N H 2 N p h o t o n s . 100 % With N H2 and N photons the number of generated H2 molecules and incident photons, respectively. These targets have not yet been attained in this young research field. In general, STH efficiencies of direct photocatalysis often stay one order of magnitude lower, around 1% [63]. This is mostly due to the use of large band gap SCs, recombination, back reactions and poisoning with peroxo-compounds [66]. Yet, promising results have recently been reported using both pure water and seawater. Liao et al. (2013) obtained STH efficiencies in the order of 5% in pure water with earth abundant CoO photocatalysts [67], while Guan et al. (2018) achieved a stable 1.9% efficiency in seawater using p-GaN-based nanowire arrays under concentrated sunlight (Fig. 2b) [49]. Besides, several recent studies with less intense light sources yielded STH efficiencies of ~2% [68,69]. Moreover, Jaramillo and co-workers estimated that the cost of H2 could even drop to US$ 1.6–3.8 kg−1 [43]. This is well below the DOE target. Pure photocatalysis would thus outperform current PEC water splitting (US$ 4.2–10.4 kg−1 H2) due to its simpler design [43], despite the difficulties concerning catalyst immobilization and recovery [70]. Note that over 80% of this maximal cost for PEC water splitting comes from the materials, construction and installation of the PEC cells [43]. Regardless of the higher cost, PEC cells are still promising because of their ability to reach high STH efficiencies. The theoretical maximum for a single cell lies at 16.8% given minimal ohmic and kinetic losses [71]. Even higher efficiencies are theoretically possible by using tandem cells [40]. Interesting results in that context were obtained at Rutgers in 2018. A STH efficiency of 11.5% could be reached using a Ni5P4 HER catalyst attached to a high performing p-GaInP2/GaAs photoabsorber in pure water. The system was covered with a TiN protection layer possibly allowing the use in more harsh environments [72]. If the STH efficiency of a tandem cell would reach 25%, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) could even decrease to US$ 2.90 kg−1. This should be possible in theory using appropriate triple junction cells [43]. A wide selection of photocatalytic and PEC seawater splitting studies are provided in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively. A very important critical note has to made here, stating that comparisons between different studies are often strongly hampered by the use of different light sources and intensities, especially in pure photocatalysis research. Therefore, it would be very useful if standard testing protocols became more established. A good first measure would be to use 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) Air Mass (AM) 1.5G simulated solar light in all setups. From the studies using ca. 1 sun illumination, it is clear that H2 yields range from 0.8 to 5 mmol h−1 gcat −1. Besides, it seems that the yields for oxides and nitrides are lower than those for sulfide-modified photocatalysts which is in accordance with the size of the band gaps. In contrast to pure photocatalysis, PEC cells are easily compared to ECs due to the similar setup. It is clear that the PEC photocurrent densities are limited to an order of magnitude of 10 mA cm−2. This is still 50–200 times smaller than for the most advanced ECs. Consequently, larger surface areas will be required for industrial operation, while several other parameters such as seawater selectivity and stability should also be considered. These will be dealt with in the following paragraphs."
7,Cl2 and ClO− evolution,"3.2 Cl2 and ClO− evolution In the following section a closer look is taken at the selectivity of seawater splitting. Next to the OER, detrimental competing oxidation reaction can occur. Especially Cl− chemistry plays a major role in these systems. The selectivity for the OER is therefore far more challenging than for the HER. This HER selectivity originates from its more optimal reduction potential compared to those of the main seawater components [10]. Still, some anions such as NO3 − and IO3 − can reduce [101], but their concentrations are negligible in seawater (below ppb [102] and ppm level [103], respectively). For these reasons, the main focus lies on Cl2 and ClO− evolution. 3.2.1 Electrolysis Competing reactions with Cl− species are probably the most important complication for seawater electrochemistry [47]. Based on the Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 3 ), one could state that at low pH values the Cl2 evolution reaction (ClER, eq. (13)) is the main competing reaction, while at high pH values the formation of the hypochlorite anion (eq. (14)) prevails [47]. Next to being toxic and highly environmentally unfriendly [104], these species are also disadvantageous to the electrode materials [48]. (13) At pH 0: 2 Cl- → Cl2 (g) + 2 e− (E 0 = 1.36 vs. SHE) (14) At pH 14: Cl-+ 2 OH− → ClO− + H2O + 2 e− (E 0 = 0.89 vs. SHE) With E 0 the redox potential of the half reaction. The OER is thermodynamically favored over the ClER due to its lower redox potential OER (1.23 V < 1.36 V vs. SHE at pH 0 [10]). Bennet already noticed in 1980 that unbuffered seawater splitting would deliver mostly Cl2 gas at realistic larger current densities. He explained this by the better kinetics of the ClER. The ClER involves only two instead of four electrons, leading to smaller required overpotentials. He pointed out that this effect could be avoided by using inconveniently low (<1 mA cm−2) or very high current densities (several thousand mA cm−2) [105]. Note furthermore that Br− oxidation is even thermodynamically favored, but due to its low concentration (289 times lower than Cl−), it will not be considered further [10]. The Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 3) shows that the ClER can be avoided by operating at higher pH. Dionigi et al. (2016) proposed a pH-value above 7.5 as a criterion for more selective O2 evolution [47]. Without the addition of strong acids or bases, the pH of natural seawater is around 8 [29]. Nonetheless, in typical liquid-based ECs, a tremendous decrease in the local pH of 5–9 pH units is observed at the anode for high current densities [11,106]. Buffers are hence necessary, despite the original occurrence of borate and carbonate [10] (see Table 1). On the other hand, too high pH values should also be avoided, due to safety constraints [7], faster degradation of the cell components and ClO− formation [47]. The latter can be suppressed by applying overpotentials lower than 0.48 V (Fig. 3). Since the pH dependence of the OER and the evolution of ClO− are similar, this second criterion is valid for all pH values above 7.5 [47]. To be less reliant on the reaction conditions, more robust selective solutions have been proposed [62,107–113]. One interesting strategy is the repulsion of negatively charged Cl− species. This can be achieved using manganese based electrocatalysts. Their OER selectivity in 0.5 M NaCl solutions (simulated seawater) is very well documented for different pH values (pH 1–10) with all examples showing efficiencies exceeding 90% [62,108,109,112,114]. Another important recent example is the application of an in situ generated polyanion-rich passivating layer by Kuang et al. (2019). Next to the passivating layer, their multilayer anode contains a NiFe electrocatalyst layer attached to a NiSx layer on porous Ni foam. This setup allowed operating at industrially required current densities (0.4–1 A cm−2) over 1000h. The polyatomic sulfate- and carbonate-rich passivating layers led to excellent corrosion resistance and were able to effectively repel Cl− [46]. In order to repel the negatively charged Cl−, the use of cation exchange membranes is often suggested (e.g. Nafion®) [115]. Unfortunately, these solutions suffer from membrane-related issues (see 3.5.1). Other solutions focus on the preliminary removal of Cl− with e.g. a settling tank filled with an aqueous NaOH solution [116]. Finally, another interesting approach is the use of seawater vapor instead of liquid seawater (Fig. 4 a). This was suggested by Spurgeon and co-workers (2016) [117]. The vapor itself contains far less ions and is sufficiently humid to maintain relatively high current densities. Coupled to photovoltaics (PV), stable STH efficiencies of about 6% were demonstrated for more than 50h at a relative humidity (RH) of 80%. In contrast, the liquid seawater equivalent lost more than 92% of its activity over this period (Fig. 4b). The performance was moreover only minimally affected by RH fluctuations as long as the relative humidity exceeded 30%. However, severe HER selectivity issues occur in these systems. Spurgeon's researchers encountered only low Faradaic efficiencies for the HER in the order of 60%. This was explained by O2 crossover and its competing reduction reaction. A thicker membrane was hence suggested to suppress gas crossover [117]. 3.2.2 Photocatalysis and PEC seawater splitting In contrast to electrolysis, several studies indicate that photocatalytic seawater splitting does not seem to suffer as much from Cl2 evolution compared to electrolysis. Pioneers Ji et al. (2007) explored the role of salts in seawater, but never detected any formation of Cl2 in their photocatalytic test systems (i.e. La2Ti2O7 under UV light and CdS/TiO2 under visible light (VIS)) [75]. Note that the VBs of these photocatalysts are theoretically suitable for Cl− oxidation [40]. It was measured that the overall pH only decreased slightly from 8.5 to 8.3 [75]. Besides, it is not expected to have large local differences since both the oxidation and the reduction occurs at the same catalyst surface [32]. This is a strong asset compared to electrolysis where pH changes are observed up to 9 pH units near the electrode surface [11]. Also, in other photocatalytic studies no chlorine production was reported, explaining it by the possible back reduction of the Cl° radical by an e− CB [77,80,118]. Guan et al. (2018) observed only a small amount of free chlorine (dissolved Cl2, HClO and ClO−) of ~0.1 mg L−1 [49]. This value was negligible compared to the formed amounts of H2 and O2. The latter were generated in an approximately ideal 2:1 ratio. This may imply that the ClER is an intermediate reaction. Also, the role of light irradiation may not be underestimated. Cl2 can react further with water to HClO (eq. (15)) which is easily decomposed to protons, oxygen gas and Cl− under illumination (eq. (16)) [99]. (15) Cl2 + H2O → H+ + Cl− + HClO (16) 2 HClO + h.ν → 2 H+ + 2 Cl- + O2 With h Planck's constant (6.63 × 10−34 J s) and ν the incident light frequency. Cooper et al. (2007) quantified the half-life of HClO/ClO− under conventional sunlight irradiation as 0.28h in pure water at pH 7. This value even decreases for lower pH values [119]. Besides, Cl2 itself can also be decomposed under illumination, giving photocatalytic technology a strong benefit over electrolysis [120]. Low-energy UV-A light already enables Cl2 photolysis. Finally, an additional reason that helps avoiding Cl2 evolution is the fact that many photocatalysts, such as TiO2, have a point of zero charge below the average pH of seawater (7.5–8.4) [121]. Consequently, their surface is negatively charged which leads to Cl− repulsion. On the other hand it means that for some materials Cl− oxidation is technically possible, depending on their valence band position [85]. For example, Maeda et al. (2009) attributed the small quantity of evolved oxygen from seawater for their (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) photocatalysts to the competition with chloride oxidation [122]. However, only very small amounts of ClO− were observed after the reaction, compared to the total Cl− concentration. This might again indicate that the Cl species continue to react further, which should be confirmed by on-line measurements in future research. Also in the case of PEC seawater splitting, Ji et al. (2007) did not detect Cl2 evolution [75]. Conversely, Cl2 evolution may actually increase the STH efficiency [94,95], since Cl− can act as a hole scavenger, thus reducing the recombination rate [68]. Especially in the case of WO3 photoanodes, Cl2 evolution is interesting. In several studies, the ClER is used to surpass the slow kinetics of the OER due to the intrinsic properties and morphology of WO3 [123]. Additionally, if oxygen bubbles are evolved, these could also fill the pores of the WO3 photoelectrodes, leading to lower currents. This issue is less important for Cl2 evolution because of its higher solubility in water [95]. Another advantage for separated WO3 anodes is the local acidification caused by the disproportionation of Cl2 (eq. (15)). WO3 is most stable in acidic environments [26]. Shi et al. (2017) obtained Faradaic efficiencies for the ClER of 56%, using porous WO3 in 0.5 M NaCl solutions. The remaining holes were likely largely consumed in the formation of HClO. Their WO3 film photoanode yielded a photocurrent density of 1.95 mA cm−2 which was stable for 3h under 1 sun AM 1.5G solar radiation (100 mW cm−2) and at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) [94]. Recently, Jadwiszczak et al. (2020) could even achieve higher photocurrent densities in seawater using lower overpotentials. When anodic potentials of 0.95 V vs. RHE were applied, their nanostructured WO3 photoanodes yielded currents exceeding 4.5 mA cm−2 [95]. Yet, extra precautions should be made to monitor and take care of the formed toxic Cl2. Possibilities to remove Cl2 from water include evaporation, adsorption on activated coal or chemical neutralization with ascorbic acid [124]. As in the case of pure photocatalysis, due to the presence of light, Cl2, HClO and ClO− will also be degraded [119]. Finally, a possible method of avoiding Cl issues could be to translate Spurgeon's seawater vapor approach to a PEC setup [117]. This can be done using gas-phase PEC cells (Fig. 5 ), based on the initial concept of Seger & Kamat (2009) [125] and recently adapted towards hydrogen recovery from polluted humid air by Van Hal et al. (2017). Although O2 crossover losses have been recorded, the design offers the opportunity to effectively work with vapor streams [126]. Unfortunately, actual PEC studies using seawater vapor are still lacking to date, but could present a highly interesting research opportunity."
8,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability Next to the activity and selectivity, the stability in seawater is a crucial parameter. Important aspects including corrosion, scaling, biofouling and flocculation will be discussed. 3.3.1 Electrolysis Apart from the formation of Cl2 and ClO−, Cl− can also cause severe corrosion of the electrodes. This happens via the metal chloride-hydroxide mechanism (eq. (17)–(19)). It consists of the Cl− adsorption due to surface polarization, which can lead to dissolution of the metal. After this, the chloride is often converted to a hydroxide [46]. (17) M + Cl− → MCl (ads) + e− (18) MCl (ads) + x-1 Cl− → MClx − (aq) (19) MClx − (aq) + x-1 OH− → M(OH)x (s) + x Cl− Corrosion in general is considered as one of the major issues of seawater electrolysis, resulting in lowered yields [11]. Also for OER selective anodes such as NiFe-LDH (Layered Double Hydroxides) [47], Co-borate [28] and Co-phosphate [28,127] severe corrosion on the long term is observed. It is even noticed for noble metal (e.g. Ru) containing electrocatalysts [128]. Important for corrosion processes is the dramatic pH change (up to 9 pH units in slightly buffered seawater) at the anode [11]. For example, when efficient H+ acceptors are lacking, the electrocatalyst will act as a base resulting in H+ induced corrosion [127]. Therefore, proper control over the reaction medium [117] and additional modifications such as passivating layers [46] are needed in order to increase the corrosion resistance. Dai's polyatomic sulfate- and carbonate-rich passivating layers are a good example that lead to superior corrosion resistance [46]. Cl2 can also cause corrosion at the cathode due to gas crossover [129]. To prevent this, controlling the pressure gradient is key. Thicker membranes are advisable, although this will be a trade-off with the conductivity [11]. Another option is alloying the Pt or Ni cathodes with transition metals (Cr, Fe, Co and Mo) [130]. For instance, PtMo alloys on a Ti mesh lose less than 10% of their activity in seawater over 172h of operation [51]. Finally, also Spurgeon's seawater vapor approach could be helpful (see 3.2.1 and Fig. 4b). Secondly, a tremendous pH increase can occur at the cathode when protons are rapidly consumed. This leads to very alkaline conditions. Cations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ may hence precipitate as hydroxides [131]. This precipitation on the electrodes, called inorganic scaling, already begins at pH ≥ ~9.5 [132]. Consequently, the active sites of the cathode get blocked. Current density losses of more than 50% after 24h have been reported because of this phenomenon [131]. Proposed solutions are often based on the use of perm-selective overlayers. These block the impurities and still allow transfer of reagents and products [133]. In 2017, Ma et al. suggested a graphitic shell around a CoMoP electrocatalyst (Fig. 6 a). By using this shell, effective protection against etching, agglomeration and blocking of active sites could be obtained (Fig. 6b). However, close attention should be paid to possible mass transport issues [57]. Finally, active site blocking can also originate from organic matter, if no seawater pre-treatment is applied [134]. Next to active site blocking, biofouling can locally attack metallic materials and consequently cause crevice corrosion [135]. Alternatively, it is stated that electrochemical reactions can generate ROS at sufficiently large overpotentials [48]. Important examples of these ROS are the hydroxyl radical at the anode and the superoxide anion radical at the cathode [32], that can oxidize organic matter. Also chlorine species could play that role bringing them back to the Cl− state [48]. It should be noted that the occurrence of ROS and Cl2 is far less likely at the cathode [136]. Esposito's group developed impurity tolerant membrane coated electrocatalysts for the cathode. These catalysts are based on ultrathin layers of SiOx coated onto Pt films. The SiOx overlayers act here as poison resistant nanomembranes which still easily allow the H+/H2 transport [137]. Nevertheless, further research for the effect of impurities in ECs and impurity resistant materials could be very advantageous to the community [11]. 3.3.2 Photocatalysis and PEC seawater splitting As mentioned previously, local pH fluctuation-induced corrosion is not considered a significant problem for photocatalysts. Reported pH changes are in the order of 0.1–1 pH unit [75,99] vs. 5–9 units for electrolytic seawater splitting [11]. The most common semiconductor photocatalyst, TiO2, is also a chemically stable oxide [138]. Its outstanding chemical stability originates from the fact that O2− is a hard nucleophile [32]. Unfortunately, this also results in a large band gap since the VB consists of the low energy O 2p orbitals [32]. On the other hand, small band gap photocatalysts such as metal chalcogenides [40], (oxy)nitrides [139,140] and oxysulfides [141] suffer from poor stability. In general, corrosion, and photo-corrosion in particular (which obviously does not occur in ECs), are major issues here [40]. Cheng et al. (2016) observed for example performance losses of more than 95% for orthorhombic Ag8SnS6 in a 0.5 M NaCl solution due to its poor stability. To solve this, the use of sacrificial agents such as Na2S and K2SO3 is suggested [100]. Further, the application of co-catalysts could also enhance the corrosion resistance. MoS2 seems very promising to inhibit photo-corrosion and can improve charge separation and light absorption (absorbance edge around 1040 nm) [142]. Another promising strategy to broaden the activity spectrum of oxide photocatalysts is the deposition of plasmonic nanoparticles (Pt [76], Pd [143], Ag [144,145] and Au [36,146–149]). These possess the optical property of (Localized) Surface Plasmon Resonance ((L)SPR) which can enable the utilization of visible light [150]. These metal particles function additionally as electron sinks under UV illumination, thereby lowering the likelihood of recombination [151]. Especially Ag seems promising due to its lower cost and strong SPR response. Unfortunately, also these noble metals quickly aggregate and oxidize in saline media, and should thus be stabilized. As a solution, work by the Verbruggen group reports on the effect of a stabilizing polyelectrolyte shell. By applying the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) technique, a homogeneous capping layer was deposited around the Ag nanoparticles with thickness control up to the sub-nanometer level (Fig. 7 a) [145]. The thin shell ensured the plasmonic effect was not compromised, while superior stability of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles could be achieved, which was demonstrated by adding a 1 M NaCl solution to the particle suspension (Fig. 7b). An alternative stabilizing technique is the full embedment of the plasmonic particles in the photocatalyst layer itself [146]. The effect of scaling due to inorganic ions is ambiguous. Ichikawa (1997) reported in the first seawater splitting study using photocatalysts that the surface of a thin anatase TiO2 film remained clean and free from deposits. He considered this as a strong advantage over seawater electrolysis [90]. Still, Ji et al. (2007) tested the effect of NaCl, MgCl2, MgSO4, CaSO4, K2SO4, K2CO3 and MgBr2 in simulated seawater. It was revealed that all the dissolved electrolytes decreased the H2 formation rates compared to pure water, except K2SO4. MgCl2 appeared to be the most detrimental salt. A solution containing ca. 74% and 15% of the Mg2+ and Cl− content of natural seawater, respectively, resulted in the lowest activity (decreased rates with a factor of ~2 compared to pure water). It was also demonstrated that simulated seawater without MgCl2 clearly outperformed seawater containing all seven salts. Hereby, Mg2+ was exposed as the main culprit [75]. Hence, it can be beneficial to selectively exclude this ion. Despite membrane related issues (see 3.5.2), polyelectrolyte multilayer membrane consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and -sulfate can offer a solution. These reject 98% of Mg2+ from seawater [152]. Anions are also further investigated for their influence on the photocatalytic activity. Although Krivec et al. (2014) pointed out the detrimental effect of Cl− active site blocking on TiO2 [153], the effect of anions can actually be beneficial. It has been shown that carbonates facilitate O2 desorption on ZrO2 photocatalysts via a carbonate radical pathway. Back reactions between H2 and O2 are consequently suppressed [154]. In addition, small amounts of Cl− are known to be effective against peroxo-forming side reactions [155]. These unwanted side reactions can lead to significant activity decreases [156]. Also, the usage of stabilizing co-catalysts such as Co oxides is found to be effective against the peroxo formation on WO3. Peroxo compounds are strong poisons for C3N4 photocatalysts as well. Therefore, Liu et al. (2015) introduced extra stabilizing carbon dot (CD) co-catalysts. These CDs degrade peroxo species, leading to a long-term stability of at least 200 days [66]. Zhu et al. (2019) showed that these CDs allow the distraction of various ionic components in seawater. Secondly, they give rise to more efficient charge separation in CDs/CdS composites, resulting in 265 times higher H2 evolution rates than for unmodified CdS [86]. Finally, biofouling has never been reported as a severe issue, to the best of our knowledge. This could be explained by the fact that photocatalysts are very prone to generate ROS. ROS can effectively degrade organic matter [32]. Therefore, TiO2 photocatalysts are often applied on different kinds of substrates to decompose organic fouling [146,157–159]. This is an advantage over compartmentalized cells such as ECs and PECCs. On the other hand, an advantage of such cells over plain photocatalysts is the lack of flocculation effects: In photocatalyst slurries, flocculation can occur due to the presence of salts. The ions may remove the electrostatic repulsion. Sakurai et al. (2018) noticed that the resulting agglomeration and decrease in active surface area led to halved H2 yields for granular Pt/TiO2. This flocculation behavior is, at least in part, reversible. For Sakurai's system, enhanced stirring or a Na+ decrease was already helpful [76]. For PEC seawater splitting, the situation depends strongly on the materials used. For the OER, chemically stable photocatalysts, sometimes modified with co-catalysts, are advisable. Luo et al. (2011) showed that unmodified Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes in seawater underwent photocurrent decreases from 18 mA cm−2 to 12 mA cm−2 after 270 min under 1 sun illumination. After modification with RhO2, the photocurrent densities were stabilized around 16.7 mA cm−2 [99]. At the cathode, similar problems as for ECs can be observed. Ayyub et al. (2018) explained performance decreases by flaky Mg(OH)2 layers shown by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Fig. 8 a–c) and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, Fig. 8d–f). The adverse blocking effect of formed Cu(OH)2 was suggested as well. This Cu hydroxide might be formed from the Cu2O–CuO-NixPy electrodes [85]. To stabilize the cathode, opportunities lie in the use of chemically stable oxides as a protecting layer. Kawde et al. (2018) showed the potential of TiO2 protection layers for p-Si photoanodes with NiOx. Without the extra layer, the silicon would oxidize rapidly, but no declined activity was observed during a 5h test with the protected photoanodes. Excellent photocurrent densities of 10 and 20 mA cm−2 could moreover be achieved for applied potentials of 0.7 V and 0.9 V vs. RHE using this system [89]. As a final remark, it is even stated in several studies that salts in seawater could act as an ideal electrolyte if corrosion and scaling issues are solved [70,92,160]. Important parameters are composition, concentration and ionic strength [92]. Concentrating seawater is therefore suggested to increase the ionic conductivity, potentially leading to lower ohmic losses [160]. Even RO waste streams could be useful. Hence, also coastal environmental pollution could be avoided [70]."
9,Catalyst sustainability,"3.4 Catalyst sustainability Another factor of paramount importance is the sustainability of the used catalysts. This determines factors like the eventual H2 cost and upscaling possibilities. The following paragraphs will therefore discuss the most commonly used materials and present some sustainable alternatives. 3.4.1 Electrolysis As mentioned before, PGMs belong to the best performing electrode materials. Only under very alkaline conditions (30% KOH in water), first row transition metals and their oxides display reasonably high activities for the HER and OER [7]. Certainly for PEMECs, Pt- and Ir-based catalysts are considered as the benchmarks [52]. Unfortunately, rational design strategies that have been applied to replace PGMs in studies involving pure water cannot be directly extrapolated to seawater environments. An example is Trasatti's volcano plot that revealed sustainable alternative materials for Pt. This plot captures the relation between the HER exchange current density and the metal-hydrogen bond strength [161]. By combining elements from opposite sides of the plot, promising composite materials could be generated. For example, Lu et al. (2015) combined Cu surfaces with Ti dopants, yielding materials with a Pt-like H-binding energy. This strategy has yielded remarkably stably performing structures for pure water splitting. Cu95Ti5 exhibited even twice the activity of state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts [162]. However, CuTi composites appear to suffer from pitting corrosion in seawater, and are thus a lot less promising in that context [163]. Still, after proving to be promising alternatives to PGM HER electrocatalysts in pure water [164,165], several abundant transition metals such as Co [58], Fe [60] and Ni [52], as well as transition metal phosphides (e.g. CoMoP [57]) have found their way into seawater research in recent years. The same goes for OER materials, although these still strongly suffer from corrosion [47,127]. 3.4.2 Photocatalysis and PEC seawater splitting Various oxides based on earth-abundant elements are often applied as photocatalysts. Yet, possible sustainability issues may occur due to use of very specific oxides and co-catalysts. The highest activities are often brought about by components containing rare earth metals like Ta. Replacing such metals by inexpensive, abundant fourth-period transition metals would be desirable [65]. Since many oxide semiconductors exhibit a low solar activity, co-catalysts are regularly added which impacts the catalyst's sustainability. For instance, rare noble metals like Pt [76], Pd [143], Ag [144] and Au [146] perform very well since they improve both the charge separation as the solar light absorption due to plasmonic effects. To investigate the benefits of the plasmonic effect with earth-abundant components, Guo et al. (2018) synthesized nonmetal plasmonic MoS2@TiO2 heterostructures (Fig. 9 a). In pure water, these photocatalysts achieved high H2 yields of 181 μmol h−1 cm−2 under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination. This value was 8 times higher compared to bare TiO2, but decreased by a factor 2–3 in seawater (Fig. 9b), showing the importance of stability [73]. Other sustainable promotors for improving the performance of large band gap oxides in seawater research include CuO [74], NiO [166] and NiS [82]. Next, non-oxide earth-abundant small band gap photocatalysts are studied extensively. For example, Qiu et al. (2017) revealed the potential of Cd0·25Zn0·75Se/CoP, displaying an interestingly stable H2 formation rate of 36.6 mmol h−1 g−1 in seawater [87]. Equally interesting are sustainable carbon-based materials. In 2015, Liu et al. introduced the use of low-cost, earth-abundant and environmentally friendly C3N4 (E g = 2.7 eV) in seawater research [66]. Speltini et al. (2018) further improved g-C3N4's activity by a facile HNO3 refluxing pretreatment, increasing the surface area, electron transport and reduction capacity. The subsequent oxidized g-C3N4 performed 5 times better than TiO2 in seawater splitting due to its smaller band gap and more beneficial position of the CB [167]. However, Pt co-catalysts are often applied to enhance the H2 evolution, although alternatives such pyridine cobaloxime based co-catalysts are recently appearing as well [168]. In addition, g-C3N4 is often combined with other abundant photocatalysts as well [68,93,98]. For example, WS2/TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction composites showed high HER rates of 4.56 mmol h−1 g−1 for 5h [68]. Another interesting class of small band gap materials is based on carbonaceous polymers. Liu et al. (2018) developed electron donor-acceptor covalent organic polymers (COP) using 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (donor) and 3,8-dibromophenantroline (acceptor) with a band gap of 1.76–1.84 eV [169]. Ultra-stable structures were attained by a Ni catalyzed Yamamoto-type Ullmans cross-coupling reaction which allowed the use of seawater. To exclude any PGM co-catalysts, corrosion resistant carbon encapsulated Ni2P substitutes were recently introduced. These sustainably modified COP photocatalysts achieved stable 2.5 mmol H2 h−1 g−1 evolution over half-a-month of intermittent testing [170]. Finally, also 2 dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COF) have been studied in a seawater context, but currently suffer much from Mg2+ chelation, yielding less active structures [171]. For PEC cells, the use of earth-abundant materials for the photoanode in seawater is quite well documented [69,88,94,95,97–99,156,172]. Yet, similar activity issues arise as for pure photocatalysts. On the cathode side, Pt is usually used [173]. In order to replace it, p-Si as a photoactive substrate with deposited HER electrocatalysts (e.g. Mo sulfides) has been suggested [174]. However, Si electrodes suffer from their poor stability. The same is observed for Cu2O (with an ideal E g of about 2 eV) [175]. Hence, the use of abundant co-catalysts like Ni [175] and protecting layers consisting of e.g. ZnO and TiO2 is studied [176]. An alternative is the use of Co-based materials [88,177]. Patel et al. (2017) applied porous and semi-transparent Co3O4 photocathodes for achieving high current densities of 25 mA cm−2 under 1 sun illumination and a bias of 0.83 vs. RHE. Due to the dual band gap character of the porous Co3O4 (E g = 1.5 and 2.3 eV), high photo conversion efficiencies of 9% and 2% could be obtained for UV and visible light wavelengths, respectively [88]."
10,Use of membranes,"3.5 Use of membranes Although the catalyst is considered to be the crucial component in all systems, the use of membranes is simply often required in ECs and PEC cells. They may moreover serve to overcome some of the difficulties when working in seawater, as mentioned before (see 3.2.1). Membranes are known to be affected by ions and impurities as well [178]. 3.5.1 Electrolysis Membranes are prominently present in PEMECs and AEMECs where they guarantee the ion-selective transfer of protons and hydroxide anions, respectively. This also leads to physical separation of the reaction products, increasing the final hydrogen yields [179]. The most common membranes in PEMECs are based on Nafion® [136]. These humid sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based polymers benefit from their high proton conductivity, good thermal properties and chemical stability in pure water. Unfortunately, it increases the cost of the device significantly [180]. Their lifetime is severely compromised in seawater due to blocking by Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ which decreases the membrane performance [181]. This resulted in high water purity requirements for PEMECs (18 MΩ cm) making their use in seawater unfeasible. In AEMECs on the other hand, similar issues are observed due to the anions present (Cl−, Br−, SO4 2− …) [10]. Boettcher's group pointed out that anion exchange membranes are still significantly less stable and active than their more developed cation equivalents [182]. Dresp et al. showed a first working membrane-based AEMEC on artificial seawater in 2018 [29]. They used a NiFe LDH anode and a Tokuyama A201 AEM. After addition of 0.5 M NaCl to several KOH solutions (0.1–1.0 M), a remarkable current density decrease was noticed. This decrease could only be related to Cl− blocking of the membrane, as no adverse effect of NaCl on the catalysts and electrodes was observed [29]. An alternative approach is the use of a Zirfon diaphragm due to its robustness, but these systems suffer from their lack of functional exchange groups. This results in a low ion conductivity [183]. The use of a membrane also generates a pH gradient between the electrodes. This causes an efficiency decrease since the theoretical electrolysis voltage increases. It is expected that this effect will be more significant for larger distances between the electrodes [184]. Besides, biofouling may occur as it is also observed for reverse osmosis membranes [178]. An interesting solution refers back to the seawater vapor approach of Spurgeon and co-workers (2016) [117]. These systems exclude the majority of ions, as mentioned earlier in 3.2.1. The ultimate solution, however, for all the membrane-related problems mentioned thus far, is to completely remove it from the cell design. In that regard Esposito's group introduced in 2018 floating membraneless PV-electrolyzers with buoyancy-driven product separation (Fig. 10 a) [48]. These electrolyzers contain mesh electrodes with asymmetrically deposited electrocatalysts (Fig. 10b). Using this system, product crossover rates could drop to only 1% without the use of any membrane. 3.5.2 Photocatalysis and PEC seawater splitting Another way of surpassing membrane related issues is the use of photocatalysis, as pointed out by Dresp et al. (2019) [10]. For pure photocatalysts, the use of membranes is not required. This has consequences for the hydrogen yield since the reaction products are not physically separated [185]. A solution to suppress the back reaction is the use of oxyhydroxide layers as an O2 impermeable surface coating. This was successfully applied for pure water splitting by Pan et al. (2015) using complex perovskite-type oxynitride photocatalysts (LaMgxTa1-xO1+3xN2-3x with x ≥ 0.33) [186]. A more established solution is the use of hole scavengers. These often lead to a higher efficiency in seawater than in pure water due to better adsorption [84,187]. The available ions may remove any electrostatic repulsions between the scavenger and the photocatalyst [84]. Another issue related to the absence of gas separation is the possibility of forming an explosive gas mixture [66]. However, several industrial techniques are already sufficiently mature to extract and separate the H2 gas such as pressure or temperature swing adsorption [43] and electrochemical pumps [66]. Since PEC water splitting devices are similar to ECs [26], the types of membranes involved and the related issues are similar to those discussed above. Gas-phase PEC cells (see 3.2.2) might at least partially solve the fouling problems, again highlighting the potential of using seawater vapor, also in PEC cells."
11,Electricity requirements,"3.6 Electricity requirements The last discussed parameter is the need for electricity, since this is also an important difference between both technologies. 3.6.1 Electrolysis Electrolysis is by nature an electricity-driven process. d’Amore-Domenech et al. (2019) calculated that the required electric energy for producing 1 kg H2 (at 350 bar) amounts to 452.0 MJ if direct seawater electrolysis is applied (Fig. 11 ). This value is rather high, compared to the estimated 174.6 MJ kg−1 H2 for low-temperature pure water electrolysis. It should also be noted that the heat delivered by the electrolyzer cannot be used for co-generation under the studied conditions (operation temperature of 15.9 °C) [188]. Possibly, energy efficiency gains may be obtained by adding more electrolytes to increase the ionic conductivity [160]. To deliver the required energy, several sustainable solutions have been explored that are available in a marine environment, i.e. close to the source of seawater. Potential energy sources are e.g. salinity and thermal gradients, wave, tidal, solar and wind energy [188]. 3.6.2 Photocatalytic and PEC seawater splitting One of the major advantages of photocatalysis compared to electrolysis, is the fact that no external electricity input is required, thus avoiding the associated efficiency losses [190]. PEC cells can in principle also benefit from this advantage, although often an external bias is applied to enhance the activity. Moreover, an energy input of 7–15 MJ per kg H2 is always required for the utility systems [189]. In multiple studies several tenths of Volts are commonly applied as external bias [7]. The effect of this bias is not as straightforward, since the excess energy leads to a temperature increase of the environment. This in turn results in a lower required energy for the photocatalytic redox reactions [191]. On the other hand it again increases the recombination rate and the rate of reagent desorption as well [192]. In an early study, Raja et al. (2006) demonstrated that the optimal photon conversion efficiency for TiO2 nanotubular arrays in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was obtained for a potential applied to the anode of 0.6 V vs. Ag|AgCl [191]. To further minimize the overpotentials, electrocatalysts can be added [41]. Important pioneers for this were Chorkendorff and co-workers who assembled electrocatalytic Mo3S4 and red photon absorbing p-Si photocathodes for pure water splitting. This modification made it possible to work quite efficiently without external bias [174]. More specifically in seawater research, Kawde et al. (2018) implemented p-Si/TiO2 photocathodes without external bias. These already showed to work 15 times better after the addition of NiOx [89]. So, the possibility of working without extra electric energy input is clearly a strong advantage for these processes. Hence, Glenk and Reichelstein (2019) stated that despite their early commercial stage, they may improve the economics of renewable H2 generation in the future [44]."
12,Conclusion and outlook,"In this review, photocatalytic and PEC seawater splitting are compared to seawater electrolysis. Seawater electrolysis heavily benefits from a high overall activity that is reached to date, while the efficiency of photocatalytic and PEC processes is strongly limited by their dependence on solar light. On the other hand, these technologies may appear superior when selectivity and stability in seawater are concerned. In photocatalysis, harmful Cl2 and ClO− formation tend to be less problematic than for electrolysis, but the actual fate of Cl-species has not yet been fully elucidated is such systems. Besides, conventional ECs suffer strongly from corrosion and inorganic scaling due to the very high local pH changes (up to 9 pH units) occurring at the electrodes. Hence, to deal with the aforementioned selectivity and stability issues, future EC research may benefit from focusing on the application of perm-selective, passivating overlayers, excluding harmful ions and other interfering components in seawater. Another promising research suggestion is the implementation of Spurgeon's seawater vapor approach for more sustainable, earth-abundant metal based electrodes. On the other hand, large pH changes are simply not observed for pure photocatalysts, where they are measured to be limited to several tenths of a pH unit. Photocatalysts are also considered more resistant toward biofouling because of the formation of reactive oxygen species. Other benefits of direct photocatalysis lie in the fact that membranes and additional electricity input are not strictly needed. This makes this young research domain still promising to achieve the DOE targets. However, in order to attain these targets, the solar light utilization capacity of current photocatalysts will need to be improved further. Therefore, research on abundant, small band gap photocatalysts in combination with sustainable co-catalysts is encouraged. However, additional stabilization methods will need to be considered to guarantee long-term performance. Finally, more optimized photocatalysts can be implemented in PEC cells. These cells suffer from several EC-like disadvantages, but benefit from the immediate separation of the evolved gases. Especially all-solid PEC designs operating on seawater vapor have been identified as a potentially promising strategy due to reduced Cl2 formation, diminished corrosion and scaling, thus offering great new research opportunities. Finally, while seawater electrolysis is clearly the most established technology to date, photocatalysis offers crucial advantages toward selectivity and (long term) stability that could stimulate its further development for applications on the intermediate and long term, while photoelectrochemical techniques may be able to compromise between advances in both fields."
