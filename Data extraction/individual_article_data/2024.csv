0,Introduction,"Global climate change due to the increased carbon dioxide emissions along with concerns over depletion of the fossil fuel resources have aroused increased interest in alternative energy strategies [1]. In this respect, hydrogen has become one of the most attractive energy carriers, because it is clean, has a high-energy yield (122 kJ/g) and its production via biological means has the potential to eliminate environmental deterioration due to the utilization of conventional fossil fuels [2]. Biological hydrogen may be produced by cyanobacteria and algae through biophotolysis of water or by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic-fermentative bacteria [3]. The fermentative hydrogen production process has the advantages of high hydrogen efficiency, simplicity of control, low production cost and light – independence compared to the photosynthetic process [4,5]. Moreover, a variety of renewable biomasses such as wastes and energy crops can be used as feedstock, while metabolites of commercial interest, such as organic acids and solvents, are also generated [6]. Fermentative hydrogen production is carried out under anoxic conditions. When organic substrates are degraded by fermentative bacteria, electrons which need to be disposed of to maintain electrical neutrality are produced, while protons act as electron acceptors and molecular hydrogen is produced [7]. When glucose is used as the model substrate for fermentative hydrogen production, it is first converted by hydrogen-producing bacteria via the glycolytic pathway, to pyruvate which can be further converted to a number of soluble metabolites, i.e. acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic acids, ethanol etc. Hydrogen is produced either from the reduced form of ferredoxin or through the decomposition of formic acid when acetyl-CoA is produced from pyruvic acid (reactions (1) and (2)). (1) Pyruvate + CoA + 2Fd(ox) → acetyl-CoA + CO2 + 2Fd (red) (2) Pyruvate + CoA → acetyl-CoA + formic acid Production of acetic and butyric acids favours production of hydrogen, with the fermentation to acetic acid giving the highest theoretical yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose, while the conversion of glucose to butyric acid yields 2 mol H2/mol glucose [8,9]. The production of other, more reduced organic acids and/or alcohols lowers the yield of H2, namely glucose conversion to propionic acid and ethanol leads to negative and zero yield of hydrogen, respectively [10]. In mixed acid fermentation processes, the involved microorganisms produce rather a spectrum of metabolic products than only acetic acid, which consequently leads to lower than the maximum theoretical hydrogen yields. Selection of pathway and consequently, hydrogen and fermentation end-products distribution, is highly dependent on many factors, such as wastewater specificity, reactor configuration, Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), influent organic concentration, organic loading rate, pH, temperature, oxidation-reduction potential, nutritional requirements, the absence or deliberate inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens etc. [11–15]. Among these factors, pH, which strongly influences hydrogenase activity [16] and metabolic pathways selection [17] is especially important. In addition, pH variation can also affect cell morphology and structure and thus flocculation and adhesion phenomena [18]. If pH is not maintained in the optimal range, it may inhibit hydrogen production or even cause a microbial population shift resulting in cessation of hydrogen production [19]. Therefore, the control of pH is crucial. Up to now, the effect of pH on hydrogen production by mixed microbial cultures using synthetic substrates such as glucose [20–22], sucrose [23,24] and starch [25], has been investigated. However, there is a wide range of pH values, which have been proposed as optimum for fermentative hydrogen production from different feedstocks. The pH range of 5–7.5 [20,26] is usually reported as optimum, even though lower or higher pH values such as pH of 4.5 [27] and 9.0 [28] have also been proposed to give the maximum hydrogen yield. This could be attributed to the differences among these studies in terms of inocula, operation mode and the pH range studied. Up to now the majority of studies report the influence of initial pH on fermentative hydrogen production at batch systems [12,29,30]. Although batch mode fermentative hydrogen production is frequently carried out for research purposes [21,28] industrially feasible processes would most likely have to be performed on a continuous or at least semi-continuous (fed or sequencing batch) basis. So far, little information is available in the relevant literature concerning the role of pH in continuous fermentative hydrogen production process [20,25]. In the present study the effect of pH on the continuous hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract, was investigated. Sweet sorghum is an annual plant of tropical origin, well-adapted to sub-tropical and temperate regions, highly productive in biomass and rich in readily fermentable sugars [10,31]. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract at different HRTs [10]. We reported that at the HRT of 12 h and a pH value of 5.3, maximum hydrogen yield was obtained using as inoculum the indigenous mixed microbial culture already contained in the sweet sorghum extract. In the present study, the influence of pH on the hydrogen production rate and yield was investigated and the possibility of high hydrogen yields at low pH values was explored with the additional advantage of decreased addition of chemicals. In general, the operation of a fermentative hydrogen production reactor at low pH values has the advantage of reduced consumption of chemicals in order to maintain the pH at levels allowing for hydrogen production. Thus, the contribution of the operational cost to the total cost of the process will be lower compared to the case of the reactor operation at higher pH value. So, hydrogen production at low pH values results in an improvement of the process efficiency from an economic point of view."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Analytical methods,"2.1 Analytical methods Determinations of chemical oxygen demand of the mixed liquor (TCOD) or of only the soluble part (SCOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were carried out according to Standard Methods [32]. For the quantification of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ethanol (EtOH), 1 mL of filtered sample acidified with 30 μL of 20% H2SO4 was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (VARIAN CP-30), equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (Agilent technologies, INC. 30 m × 0.53 mm). The oven was programmed from 105 °C to 160 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, and subsequently to 235 °C (held for 3 min) at a rate of 20 °C/min for VFA analysis and from 60 °C (held for 1 min) to 230 °C (held for 0.5 min) at a rate of 45 °C/min for ethanol analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 15 mL/min, the injector temperature was set at 175 °C and the detector at 225 °C and 200 °C, for VFA and ethanol determinations respectively. The concentration of lactic acid was measured on a liquid chromatograph (DIONEX DX300), equipped with an electron conductivity detector and a Dionex IonPac column (AS11-HC, 4 × 250 mm Analytical). The eluent (sodium hydroxide solution) flow rate was 1.5 mL/min and the analysis was carried out at 30 °C. The produced gas composition in hydrogen and methane was quantified with a gas chromatograph (VARIAN STAR 3600) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column with nitrogen as carrier gas. The injector, column and detector temperatures were set at 70 °C, 80 °C and 180 °C respectively. The measurement of the produced gas volume was based on the displacement of acidified water. For the determination of carbohydrates, a colored sugar derivative was produced through the addition of L-tryptophan and sulphuric and boric acids and subsequently measured colorimetrically at 520 nm [33]. The measurement of the pH was done using a HANNA (pH 211) pH-meter with a HANNA (HI 1230) electrode."
3,Extraction of sweet sorghum biomass,"2.2 Extraction of sweet sorghum biomass Sweet sorghum biomass (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) used in the present study was produced in field experiments through biological farming techniques according to European Regulation EC 2092/91 [10]. After plant harvesting, the fresh stems were stripped from the leaves and the stalks were chopped to a size of 20 cm, stored in the freezer at −20 °C and milled by a laboratory grinder to an average particle size of 1–2 mm. Extraction of free sugars of the sorghum biomass was done in batches by mixing 5 kg of milled sorghum stalks with 30 L of tap water for 1 h, at 30 °C. After the extraction process a liquid fraction (sorghum extract), rich in soluble carbohydrates and a solid fraction (lignocellulosic residues) were obtained. The main characteristics of the sorghum extract used for fermentative hydrogen production in this study are shown in Table 1 ."
4,Experimental setup and operation,"2.3 Experimental setup and operation A double walled stainless steel, cylindrical CSTR-type reactor with a working volume of 0.5 L was operated under mesophilic (35 °C) conditions. During start-up, the reactor was filled up with 500 mL sweet sorghum extract supplemented with 2 g/L urea (NH2CONH2) and a buffer solution consisting of 2.24 g/L NaOH and 6.8025 g/L KH2PO4 and operated anaerobically at a batch mode at 35 °C for 24 h in order to activate the indigenous microflora contained in sweet sorghum extract [10]. Following start-up, the operation of the hydrogen producing reactor was subsequently switched to a continuous mode at an HRT of 12 h and with a loading rate of 1 L/d. In Antonopoulou et al. [10] study it was shown that at an HRT of 12 h the pH culture was maintained at 5.3 ± 0.1 through the addition of 2.24 g NaOH and 6.8025 g KH2PO4 per liter of sorghum extract. The production of hydrogen from sweet sorghum extract was investigated in a pH range of 6.5–3.5. The pH values in the range of 5.3–3.5 (low pH values) were achieved through reducing the capacity of the buffer solution used, while the pH values of 6 and 6.5 (high pH values) were adjusted through changing the ratio of the buffer solution components. Specifically, after start-up the operation of the hydrogen producing reactor was subsequently switched to a continuous mode at an HRT of 12 h in a pH range of 5.3–3.5 which was set by decreasing the buffer capacity of the mixed liquor. Initially 2.24 g/L NaOH and 6.80 g/L KH2PO4 (Buffer Solution or BS) were added to sweet sorghum extract and when the reactor reached steady sate, the concentration of the buffer solution components decreased to 2/3 of the initial one (1.493 g/L NaOH and 4.535 g/L KH2PO4) (2/3 BS). When the reactor reached steady state, the buffer solution components concentration was further reduced to the half (1.12 g/L NaOH and 3.40 g/L KH2PO4) (1/2 BS) and the one third (0.747 g/L NaOH and 2.267 g/L KH2PO4) (1/3 BS) of the initial one respectively. Finally, no buffer solution was added in sweet sorghum extract (0 BS). In order to achieve higher pH values, a second start-up of the reactor was made. The increase of the pH was achieved by increasing the NaOH concentration which was contained in the buffer solution and in parallel maintaining the concentration of KH2PO4 at a constant value of 6.8025 g/L. Initially the NaOH concentration increased to 3.4 g/L (instead of 2.24 g/L NaOH) which corresponded to approximately 1.5 fold increase (1.5 NaOH) and thereafter to 5.56 g/L which corresponded to approximately 2.5 fold increase (2.5 NaOH). In both cases, the reactor was operated anaerobically and was under steady state at an HRT of 12 h. The reactor was stirred periodically for 15 min, 2 times per hour. It was fed intermittently, every 3 h with sweet sorghum extract kept at 4 °C. Feeding was programmed always with the stirring on. Simultaneous flow of the effluent occurred during feeding by liquid overflow, in order to maintain constant reactor volume. As a result, a portion of the feed was removed with the effluent and the initial concentration of carbohydrates for every feeding cycle could be calculated using the following equation: (1a) S = S 0 − ( S 0 − S in ) × e − ( Q / V ) × t where S is the resulting concentration when feeding was completed, S 0 is the influent concentration, S in is the concentration when feeding started, namely the concentration measured at the end of each cycle, Q is the volumetric feeding rate, V is the reactor volume and t is the duration of feeding. In all experiments, 2 g of urea (NH2CONH2) per liter of sorghum extract was added to make up for N deficiency of the feed. Gas and liquid samples were collected 10–15 min before the start of a feeding, once a day. In all experiments, the reactor performance (biogas production and composition in H2, pH, carbohydrates, soluble COD, ethanol, butanol, lactic acid and VFAs concentration) was monitored daily. Gas samples were also analyzed for methane daily, in order to monitor whether methane production occurred. Complete characterization was made once a steady state was reached. By steady state, it is meant, that the variation of the monitoring parameters in time was less than 10%, at least for 5 successive measurements (usually more than 6 HRTs)."
5,Results and discussion,"In the present study, the influence of pH on the continuous hydrogen production from sweet sorghum biomass was investigated. The hydrogen producing reactor operated at an HRT of 12 h, with an influent flow rate of 1 L/d, which corresponded to a carbohydrates loading rate of 188.9 mmol/L reactor/d (the concentration of the influent in carbohydrates was approximately 17 g/L in glucose equivalents). This was found to be the optimum HRT for hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract, in the range of 24–4 h [10]. As mentioned before, the pH varied by either a gradual reduction of the buffer capacity or by an increase of NaOH added in the feeding. In Table 2 , the variation of the pH of the reactor mixed liquor, is presented at each steady state. In the experiments with low pH values, the pH varied from 5.3 to 3.5. Initially, the pH of the mixed liquor in the reactor was 5.3 (BS) and decreased gradually to 5.1, 4.7 and 4.6 when the concentration of the buffer solution components was reduced at 2/3 (2/3 BS), 1/2 (1/2 BS) and 1/3 (1/3 BS) of the initial one, respectively. A rapid decrease of the pH to 3.5 occurred when no buffer solution was added (0 BS). When the NaOH concentration increased by 1.5 (1.5 NaOH) and 2.5 (2.5 NaOH) times the initial one, the pH increased to 6.2 and 6.5, respectively. In Fig. 1 (a and b), the content of hydrogen in the gas phase and hydrogen production rate during the experimental period, is presented. The mean values of the corresponding hydrogen production rates and hydrogen yields in each steady state are presented in Table 2. It should be noted that during the operation of the hydrogenogenic reactor no traces of methane were detected at any time, indicating lack or suppression of methanogens in the microbial consortium. In general, the biogas composition in hydrogen (Fig. 1a) lied between 37 and 40% for pH values of 5.3–4.6 and systematically decreased to 27 and 21% (Fig. 1b), when the pH increased to 6.2 and 6.5 respectively. The higher hydrogen production rates were monitored in the pH range of 5.3–4.7. The maximum productivity was obtained at pH 5.3 and corresponded to the production of 1752 ± 54 mL H2/d or 3.50 ± 0.07 L H2/L reactor/d. However, high hydrogen production rates of 3.15 ± 0.31 L H2/L reactor/d and 3.21 ± 0.18 L H2/L reactor/d were also produced at pH values of 5.1 and 4.7, respectively. Further decrease of pH to 4.6 led to a reduction of hydrogen production rate whereas the hydrogen evolution ceased when the pH decreased below 4. The observation that hydrogen production ceased at a pH of 3.5 is consistent with Hwang's et al. findings [34] that pH 4.0 can be regarded as the operational limit for the hydrogen production process. At high pH values, the hydrogen production rate decreased from 1.14 ± 0.07 to 0.47 ± 0.05 L/L reactor/d when the pH increased from 6.2 to 6.5. The efficiency of total carbohydrates consumption in glucose equivalents (Table 2) was greater than 97% at the pH range of 6.5–4.6 and decreased to 72.9% when the pH decreased to 3.5. The hydrogen yield reached its highest value at pH of 5.3, amounting to 0.93 mol H2/mol glucose consumed or 10.51 L H2/kg sweet sorghum. However, relatively high hydrogen yields were also obtained at the pH range of 5.3–4.7 (0.83 mol H2/mol glucose consumed at pH = 5.1 and 0.87 mol H2/mol glucose consumed at pH = 4.7). This means that a reduction of the concentration of buffer solution components at 2/3 (2/3 BS) and 1/2 (1/2 BS) of the initial one, did not considerably affect the yield of hydrogen produced. This is beneficial for the economy of the process, since reduction of the pH from 5.3 to 4.7 means lower consumption of chemicals and specifically a 50% reduction of chemicals. In general, the operation of a hydrogen producing reactor at pH below 5 could be advantageous, since this involves the addition of less alkali for pH control, incurring less cost [13]. Thus, at the pH 4.7 the contribution of the chemicals cost to the total cost of the process will be only half of the respective cost when the reactor is operated at a pH of 5.3. However, further reduction of buffer solution capacity to 1/3 of the initial one (pH = 4.6) corresponded to a yield of 0.67 mol H2/mol glucose consumed. In order to decide for the optimal pH value for a full-scale plant, it is necessary to take into account both economic (based on chemical costs) and technical (based on hydrogen yield) aspects. At the pH values of 6.2 and 6.5, the hydrogen yield was significantly lower and taking into account the increased demands of chemicals (higher concentration of NaOH), it can be concluded that the optimum pH range for hydrogen production was 4.7–5.3. In Table 3 the effect of pH on fermentative hydrogen production from synthetic or real wastewaters at continuous systems using mixed microbial cultures is presented. Lay [25] reported that hydrogen production occurred within a pH range between 4.7 and 5.7 with an optimum pH value of 5.2, when a continuous bioreactor was operated with mixed microbial cultures processing starch at an HRT of 17 h. In that study it was also observed that when the pH was lower than 4.3 or higher than 6.1 lower hydrogen yields were obtained. In addition, other studies in continuous systems reported that a pH of 5.5 for glucose [20], 5.5 for brewery waste [35] and 5.8 for beer processing wastes [36] was optimum for hydrogen production. Nevertheless, there are also studies reporting different pH values as optimum which could be attributed to the differences in terms of inocula, substrates, reactor configurations and pH range studied [37]. For example, Chen et al. [38] reported that the pH of 4.9 was optimum for hydrogen producing bacteria in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) using sucrose at a concentration of 25 g COD/L, while Zhao and You [19] reported that maximum hydrogen production rate and yield using sucrose in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) was observed in a pH range of 6.5–7.5. The mean values of the concentrations of the main metabolic products measured at each steady state are presented in Fig. 2 . Butanol, valeric, isovaleric and isobutyric acids were not detected at the pH values tested. Acetic acid concentration was favoured at high pH values reaching the highest concentration of 1726 mg/L at the pH of 6.2. The concentration of propionic acid was stable at approximately 500 mg/L at the pH range of 5.1–4.6 and decreased at the pH of 5.3. As presented in Fig. 2, the dominant metabolic product, at all steady states, was butyric acid. Its concentration was 5435, 5610 and 5243 mg/L at pH values of 5.3, 5.1 and 4.7 respectively. Its concentration decreased when the pH was lower than 4.7 or higher than 6.2. This verified that the yield of hydrogen was related to the production of butyrate [2,40], since reduction of butyrate concentration was accompanied by a proportional hydrogen decrease. Moreover, high hydrogen yields were achieved when butyrate was the main metabolic product. At the pH value of 4.6, butyric acid concentration decreased to 3662 mg/L and finally dropped to 2100 mg/L with the pH reduction to 3.5. At the latter pH value where hydrogen evolution ceased the dominant metabolic products were also ethanol and lactic acid, with concentrations of 2300 and 2000 mg/L, respectively. Similar results were also obtained from Lay [25] reporting that at a pH below 4.1 the process favoured alcohol production and hydrogen evolution sharply decreased. He stated that the sharp drop in hydrogen production rate might be tentatively influenced by undissociated VFAs or a low hydrogenase activity [16,41]. Therefore, the control of pH through alkali addition is one of the key parameters during fermentative hydrogen production process, since pH value influences hydrogen rates and yields as well as the metabolic pathways which will be followed by the involved microorganisms [25]. In the present study, it is obvious that the distribution of metabolic products was different at various pH levels. The higher hydrogen yields were associated with the production of butyric acid, while low hydrogen yields were observed at low pH values where the production of reduced end-products, occurred. The hydrogen yield can be correlated stoichiometrically with the final metabolic products, through the reactions describing the individual processes of acidogenesis: (3) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (4) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 (5) C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O The predicted hydrogen production rate, based on the above equations, was calculated as the sum of 2 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of acetic acid produced and of 2 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of butyric acid produced, minus 1 mmol of hydrogen per 1 mmol of propionic acid produced. The mean values of the production rates of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and the theoretically calculated hydrogen production rate based on the measured concentrations of acids at steady state, compared to the experimentally measured hydrogen production rate, at different pH values are shown in Table 4 . It was observed that the measured hydrogen production rate was much lower than the predicted hydrogen production based on the metabolic products measured. An explanation could be that a considerable amount of the produced hydrogen is probably consumed by hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as homoacetogenic bacteria which may be establish in the reactor, producing acetic acid. (6) 4H2 + 2CO2 → CH3COOH + 2H2O Another possibility for the discrepancy between the predicted and measured hydrogen production rates could be that part of the acetic acid may be produced through reaction (7) where no hydrogen is produced via glucose degradation. (7) C6H12O6 → 3CH3COOH In Fig. 3 the mean values of the measured and calculated SCOD concentrations of the reactor content at each steady state are presented. Calculated SCOD concentration represents the sum of the calculated chemical oxygen demand of different products (hydrogen, ethanol, lactic, butyric, propionic and acetic acids) as well as the calculated chemical oxygen demand of non-consumed carbohydrates measured as glucose units. The remaining SCOD value after subtracting the calculated SCOD from the measured SCOD concentration corresponds to non-identified metabolic products during glucose fermentation. As presented in Fig. 3, at the pH range of 5.3–3.5, the remaining SCOD represented only a very small fraction of the SCOD measured, and thus it can be assumed that the main metabolic products of sweet sorghum sugars fermentation were determined. On the other hand, at the pH values of 6.2 and 6.5 the remaining SCOD corresponded to 26% and 35% of the SCOD measured, respectively. This implies that there were other undetected metabolic products which contributed to the SCOD value. Such products could be either alcohols such as propanol or some ketones the production of which is not accompanied by hydrogen production. These results are consistent with Fan et al. [35] findings that higher production of alcohols over acids was observed at pH values of 6–6.5. As it was anticipated, the SCOD removal efficiency of the reactor (presented in Table 2) was low since fermentative hydrogen production (acidogenesis) process does not significantly reduce the organic content of the influent. In practice, typical yields in the range of 1–2 mol H2/mol of glucose result in 10–20% COD removal, since the main part of the organic content of the influent remains in the form of various VFAs and solvents. Even under the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield of 4 mol H2/mol glucose about 60–70% of the organic matter remains in the solution [42,43]. Further utilization of the organic matter contained in the effluent of a fermentative hydrogen producing bioreactor, through i.e. methane production, could increase the overall energy output of the process. This concept has already been presented by Antonopoulou et al. [10] and Koutrouli et al. [44] who developed a two stage anaerobic process for hydrogen and methane generation, using as feedstocks sweet sorghum biomass and olive-pulp, respectively."
6,Conclusions,"In this study, the pH effect on continuous fermentative hydrogen production from sweet sorghum extract was investigated. The process was carried out at an HRT of 12 h under mesophilic conditions and at a pH range of 3.5–6.5. Maximum hydrogen efficiency (production rate of 3.50 ± 0.07 L H2/L reactor/d and yield of 0.93 ± 0.03 mol H2/mol glucose consumed) was achieved at the pH of 5.3. This yield corresponded to the production of 10.1 L of H2/kg sweet sorghum biomass. The hydrogen production rates and yields were also high for the pH range of 5.3–4.7, where butyric acid was the main metabolic product. Further decrease of pH value to 4.6 led to a reduction of hydrogen production rates and yields, accompanied by a butyric acid concentration decrease. The hydrogen evolution ceased when the pH decreased to 3.5. At this pH value, the dominant metabolic products were lactic acid and ethanol in addition to butyric acid. This indicated that the yield of hydrogen was related to the production of butyrate since high hydrogen yield were achieved when butyrate was the main metabolic product while production of reduced end-products was associated with low hydrogen yields."
