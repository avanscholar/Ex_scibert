0,Introduction,"Continuous increase in fuel prices, contraction of natural energy resources (such as oil and coal) and evidence of man-made global warming have triggered urgent development of alternative energy sources. Hydrogen is one such source which enables electric energy to be generated in ecologically clean way [1]. For example if fuel cells were used for generating electricity instead of traditional means such as coal, carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 40–60%, and nitrogen oxide emissions by 50–90%, which would make a significant impact on the environment. Hydrogen has been identified as a promising alternative energy source [2,3]. However, issues such as manufacture, transports, storage and utilisation present a challenge [3,4]. Methanol, the simplest of all alcohols, is a promising source for hydrogen production. The absence of a strong CC bond facilitates the reforming of methanol at low temperatures (200–300°C). Although methanol is highly toxic and miscible in water, it has the advantage of being biodegradable liquid at atmospheric conditions and has high hydrogen to carbon ratio. Oxidizing and steam reforming of methanol is carried out under atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of 150–350°C [5–12]. Typical catalysts in both processes are Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Pd, Pt, Ru, Au, Ir, Ag supported on mono [5–8], and binary oxides [7–10]. These catalytic systems are prepared using different methods such as microemulsion [13], aerogel [14], coprecipitation [15], sol–gel [16], impregnation [17] and combustion synthesis [18]. However, at present, the most common catalysts used for methanol reforming are the copper supported catalysts. High values of copper dispersion and metal surface area along with small particle size are the targets for achieving highly active catalysts. The addition of promoters [19–24] and the influence of preparation method [25–28] on the properties of copper supported catalysts are well documented. However, despite the relatively high activity of CuO/ZnO, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalytic systems in methanol oxidizing reaction, there are still ongoing problems with their yield, selectivity and stability [12]. The group 8–10 metal-based catalysts were firstly studied by Iwasa et al. [29–31]. Other authors have later studied the influence of several factors on the catalytic performance for methanol steam reforming [32–35]. Iwasa et al. [30,31] reported that catalytic performance of the Pd/support catalysts were dependent on the type of support (SiO2, La2O3, Nb2O5, ZnO, ZrO2, Nd2O3, Al2O3) and the highest selectivity exhibited Pd/ZnO catalysts. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that as temperature increases, monometallic Pd particles form an alloy with Zn which is stable at a wide temperature range. On the contrary, no alloy formation in the case of Pd catalysts supported on SiO2 and ZrO2 was observed. Iwasa also investigated the influence of different metal (Me=Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ir or Ru) addition on catalytic activity of Me/ZnO catalyst in steam and oxygen reforming of methanol [29]. He proved that the most promising system was Pd/ZnO monometallic catalyst. Its high activity was explained by intermetallic Pd–Zn formation. Similarly to Pd/ZnO catalyst, the low selectivity of Pt/ZnO towards CO was assigned to PtZn alloy formation. In the case of Ni, Ru, Co and Ir catalysts no alloy phase were formed after reducing the catalysts at 500°C. These catalysts showed low methanol conversion and produced a higher concentration of carbon monoxide [36,37]. Palladium is active component for methanol reforming reactions. It is an effective decomposition catalyst, selectively forming H2 and CO when it is supported on metal oxide [38–41]. However, when palladium is supported on ZnO, high selectivity for CO2 in the steam reforming reaction (SRM reaction) has been reported. This change in selectivity can be explained by the Pd–Zn alloys formation [42]. These palladium alloys are formed at moderate temperatures under reducing conditions [43,44]. The promotion effect of Zn, Ru on activity and selectivity of Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 supported catalysts was also tested in steam reforming of methanol [45–48]. As a result the authors observed increase of activity and selectivity in the discussed reaction. The improvement of activity and selectivity of Pt and Pd catalysts the authors explained by formation of Pd–Zn and Pt–Ru alloys and by occurrence of interaction SMSI between noble metal and TiO2. Liu et al. studied the influence of Cr, Fe or Cu addition into Pd/ZnO catalysts. They observed the increase of selectivity to hydrogen production and limitation of CO formation [49,50]. Comparing the copper and the 8–10 group metal catalysts we can conclude that both systems exhibit high activities. However, we should highlight some advantages of the 8–10 group catalysts, such as thermal stability and long-term stability, when compared to the copper-based systems [51–53]. One way to improve copper-based catalysts is to create multifunctional catalysts containing intermetallic or alloy compound on the catalysts surface directly during activation process. This intermetallic compound is thought to be a key factor in achieving highly active and selective systems. Therefore the main goal of this work is to explain the correlation between the composition of active component in mono and bimetallic catalysts with their activity results in steam reforming of methanol. In order to achieve the goal of this work monometallic Cu and bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. The physicochemical properties of the catalytic systems were studied by XRD, TPR-H2, FTIR and XPS techniques. Catalytic activity tests in steam reforming of methanol were carried out using fixed bed quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 120–240°C."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Copper catalysts were prepared by wet aqueous impregnation. In order to prepare ZnAl2O4 support the following molar ratio of Zn:Al=0.5 zinc acetate and aluminium nitrate compounds were used. Aqueous solutions of 1ML−1 zinc acetate and 1ML−1 aluminium nitrate were mixed in appreciate quantity under vigorous stirring at 80°C. A concentrated ammonia solution was then added by dropwise addition until the pH reached values of between 10 and 11 and then the mixtures were stirred for another 30min. The resulting fine precipitates were washed two times in deionised water and then dried at 120°C for 15h and calcined for 4h at 600°C in air. Calcination at 600°C was chosen because such high temperature is required for creation of spinel structure in a prepared system. Metal phase Cu and Pd was introduced on the support surface by wet impregnation using aqueous solutions of copper and palladium nitrates. The supported catalysts were then dried at 120°C and finally calcined for 4h in air at temperatures of 400°C. Copper loading was 5, 20 and 60wt.%, respectively. The content of palladium in the bimetallic palladium–copper catalyst was 1wt.% (1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4). 5%Pd/Al2O3, 2%Pd/ZnAl2O4 and 20%Pd/ZnAl2O4 catalysts were also prepared by a wet impregnation method. Metal phase Pd was introduced on the support surface (Al2O3 or ZnAl2O4) by wet impregnation using aqueous solution of palladium nitrate. The supported catalysts were then dried at 120°C and finally calcined for 4h in air at temperatures of 400°C. Al2O3 support was obtained by precipitation methods using a concentrated ammonia solution as a precipitation agent."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts 2.2.1 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H2) The TPR-H2 measurements were carried out in an automatic TPR system AMI-1 in the temperature range of 25–900°C with a linear heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Samples (weight about 0.1g) were reduced in hydrogen stream (5% H2–95% Ar) with a volumetric flow rate of 40cm3 min−1. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. 2.2.2 Thermo-gravimetric TG method Thermo-gravimetric TG method, equipped with differential thermal analysis DTA device SETSYS-16/18 (Setaram) was used for temperature programmed decomposition of palladium nitrate Pd(NO3)2 in air atmosphere. The TG–DTA measurements were carried out applying sample weight about 20mg, linear heating rate of 10°Cmin−1, temperature range from 25 up to 1000°C. From aqueous solution of nitrate(V) palladium(II) the solvent was evaporated, then the sample was dried at 80°C for 2h. The prepared sample was examined using TG–DTA technique. Such prepared sample was used without any preliminary treatment. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements Room temperature powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano reflecting geometry. Copper Cu Kα radiation from a sealed tube was used. Data was collected in the range 5–90° 2θ with a step of 0.0167° and exposure per step of 27s. Due to the fact that raw diffraction data contain some noise, the background during the analysis was subtracted using Sonneveld and Visser algorithm. The data was then smoothed using cubic polynomial. All calculations were done using X‘Pert HighScore Plus computer software. 2.2.4 Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRFTIS) Infrared spectra were recorded with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT (Mercury cadmium telluride–MCT, HgCdTe) detector. Before analysis copper, palladium and palladium–copper catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 were reduced at 300°C, “in situ” in gas reduction mixture 5%H2–95%Ar for 1h. Additionally, palladium catalyst supported on alumina was first reduced ex-situ at 500°C in pure hydrogen and then reduced in-situ at 300°C in gas reduction mixture 5%H2–95%Ar for 1h. After, “in situ” reduction, the catalysts were cooled down, “in situ” in the same apparatus to 50°C and then the reduction mixture was shifted to a mixture of approximately 5% CO in Ar. A resolution of 4.0cm−1 was used throughout the investigations. Sixty-four scans were taken to achieve a satisfactory signal to noise ratio. The background spectrum was collected at 50°C after reduction. The adsorption process involved exposure of the reduced catalysts to 5vol.% CO in Ar flowing at 40cm3 min−1 for 30min under atmospheric pressure. After the adsorption process, the cell was evacuated for 30min at the same temperature in argon. 2.2.5 X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS spectra were recorded on a Specs SAGE XPS spectrometer using Mg Kα radiation source (hν =1253.6eV) operating at 10kV and 20mA. The elements present on the sample surface were identified from a survey spectrum recorded over the energy range 0–1000eV at a pass energy of 100eV and a step of spectra acquisition of 0.5eV. The areas under selected photoelectron peaks in the spectrum were used to calculate the percentage of atomic concentrations. High resolution (step of spectra acquisition of 0.1eV) spectra were then recorded for pertinent photoelectron peaks at pass energy of 20eV to identify the chemical state of each element. All the binding energies (BEs) were referenced to the C1s neutral carbon peak at 285eV, to compensate for the effect of surface charging. The analysis area was circular with a diameter of 0.7mm. The processing and curve-fitting of the high-resolution spectra was performed using CasaXPS software."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test Steam reforming of methanol (SRM) was performed using a flow quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. The reaction was carried out in a temperature range of 160–240°C. HPLC grade methanol (Aldrich, water ∼0.03wt.%) was used. The catalyst load was 0.2g and the GHSV at reaction temperature was 2400h−1. The steady—state activity measurements at each temperature were taken after at least 2h in the stream. The analysis of the reaction organic products (methanol, methyl formate, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde) was carried out by an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with FID detector and 10% Carbowax 1500 on Graphpac column. The CO, CH4 and CO2 concentrations were monitored by a GC chromatograph equipped with TCD detector (150°C, 60mA), and Carbopshere 60/80 (50°C) column. The hydrogen concentration was measured by a GC chromatograph equipped with TCD detector (120°C, 60mA) and Molecular Sieve 5A (120°C) column. Material balances on carbon were calculated to verify the obtained results. The yield of hydrogen production in SRM (reaction (1)) was calculated using Eq. (2) and the conversion of methanol using Eq. (3): (1) CH3OH+H2O=CO2 +3H2 (2) Y H 2 = n out H 2 / 3 n 1 in CH 3 OH × 100 where, nCH3OH and nH2 is the molar flow rate of CH3OH and H2, respectively. (3) Conv . CH 3 OH = n 1 in CH 3 OH − n 2 out CH 3 OH n 1 in CH 3 OH × 100 where n outH2—molar flow rate of H2 feed out, n 1 in CH 3 OH , n 1 out CH 3 OH –molar flow rate of CH3OH feed in and feed out, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,"The catalyst reducibility was evaluated by temperature-programmed reduction. H2-TPR results for support ZnAl2O4, the monometallic 1%Pd/ZnAl2O4, 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 and bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The reduction studies performed both for support and 1%Pd/ZnAl2O4 systems clearly show that those materials are not reduced in the studied reduction temperature. The lack of the reduction stage on the TPR profile recorded for palladium catalyst means that all PdO was reduced at ambient temperature or lower temperature what we are not able to record using the TPR technique. To clarify the presence of palladium oxide phase in the case of a palladium catalyst calcined at 400°C the decomposition measurement of palladium(II) nitrate(V) in an air atmosphere was performed and the results are presented in Fig. 2 . Palladium(II) nitrate decomposition occurs in three stages. The process of water removal taking place in the temperature range 30–120°C and the changes of TG and DTG curves are accompanied by endothermic DTA peak situated in temperature range 30–120°C (see Eq. (4)). Although palladium II nitrate supposedly was nominally water free but the investigated sample appeared to contain about 1.8% of water. The second stage of palladium nitrate phase transformation into palladium oxide phase takes place in temperature range 120–420°C. Sample denitrification results in weight loss Δm about 53.8%. Such process can be described by general reaction (see Eq. (5)). (4) Pd(NO3)2·xH2O→Pd(NO3)2 + xH2O (5) Pd(NO3)2 →PdO+2NO+3/2O2 (6) PdO→Pd+1/2O2 The following sequence of temperature programmed decomposition of Pd(NO3)2·nH2O can be anticipated: dehydration, denitrification leading to palladium oxide phase which undergo further decomposition on metallic palladium and oxygen. Whereas, both Cu and Pd–Cu supported catalysts exhibited two reduction peaks. Monometallic copper catalysts exhibited two effects situated in the temperature range of 200–380°C which are attributed to reduction of copper(II) oxides and copper(I) oxide reduction according to the following reduction scheme (see below scheme (7)). (7) CuO→Cu2O→Cu The differences of the reduction peaks heights are associated with the presence of larger and smaller copper oxide crystallites on the catalyst surface. The smaller crystallites are easier reduced so they are reduced first to Cu2O at lower temperature range and then to metallic Cu. In the case of larger CuO crystallites which are harder to reduce, therefore their reduction takes place at a higher temperature directly to metallic copper. The reduction peaks recorded for bimetallic 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst are shown in the temperature range 150–380°C. A shift of the low temperature peak is observed. This shift indicates that the addition of Pd into the copper catalyst facilitates the reduction of copper(II) oxide to copper(I) oxide species [54]. The facile reduction of copper(II) oxide in the case of Pd–Cu catalysts is explained by hydrogen spillover from metal Pd to copper species. In our previous work [55] we studied the reduction behaviour of 2% Pd/ZnAl2O4 catalyst and we observed two hydrogen consumption peaks situated at about 30 and 80°C. The first profile was attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed palladium oxide which is slowly reduced at room temperatures. The second reduction peak was assigned to the reduction of small palladium crystallites interacting with the surface of ZnAl2O4 [55]. A study by Cubeiro et al. [56] claimed that PdO is an easily reducible oxide, which is undergoing the reduction process even at room temperature. The authors also observed a low temperature reduction peak situated at the temperature range 30–150°C which was assigned to the reduction of PdO to Pd metal. The reduction behaviour of palladium and copper–palladium catalysts was investigated previously by Wang et al. [54]. The palladium system exhibited only one reduction peak centred at 125°C which was attributed to the reduction of PdO. The result confirmed that there was a weak interaction between Pd and support. However, the TPR profile of bimetallic Pd–Cu/γ-Al2O3 showed reduction peaks shifted towards higher temperature. Furthermore, the addition of Pd into copper catalyst facilitated the reduction of copper oxides, which resulted in the formation of a Pd–Cu alloy. Another point of view is presented by Canner et al. [54,57] who attributed the facile reduction of copper species in the case of Pd–Cu catalysts to hydrogen spillover from metal Pd to copper species. Kugai et al. [58] investigated the reduction of palladium, copper and palladium–copper catalysts and reported that Cu catalysts exhibited two major reduction peaks assigned to the reduction in highly dispersed CuO cluster interacting with the support and/or bulk copper. The second reduction peak observed for copper catalysts was split into two peaks when copper content was 25wt.%. A new, third peak has been assigned to the reduction of bulk CuO species. On support, reduction occured at lower temperature compared to non-supported bulk CuO suggesting that even bulk CuO species were under strong influence of the support. Kugai et al. reported that the introduction of Pd into Cu catalyst did not result in an additional reduction peak. They observed only a single reduction peak at around 135°C, but the peak appears somewhat broader. Further, Batista et al. [59] investigated the reduction of monometallic palladium, copper and bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts and found that in the presence of palladium, Cu2+ is completely reduced to Cu0 at lower temperature range. The phase composition studies of copper and bimetallic palladium–copper supported catalysts were carried out to elucidate the interaction between the active component and support. Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns of copper catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 after calcination at 400°C, after reduction (5%H2–95%Ar) and after steam reforming of methanol. The diffraction peaks of the oxide phase in the case of copper catalyst calcined at 400°C are attributed to ZnAl2O4, ZnO, CuO phases [60,61]. The appearance of the ZnO phase on the diffraction curve is explained by the fact that after introduction of copper ions Cu2+ into ZnAl2O4 during calcination process some part of Zn2+ can be substituted by Cu2+ ions in spinel structure and creates CuAl2O4 structure. It is not possible to confirm by XRD the presence of copper aluminate structure because ZnAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 are isostructural and their diffraction peaks appear exactly at the same 2θ angle [61]. The reduction process carried out for this catalyst resulted in the appearance of metallic copper phase coming from reduction of copper oxide species. In addition to metallic copper phase, diffraction peaks attributed to the spinel structure phase are visible on the XRD curve of copper catalysts reduced at 300°C in 5%H2–95% Ar mixture. The phase composition of 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst synthesized using the procedures described in the experimental section was also studied after steam reforming of methanol. These studies confirmed the presence of the same phase as for the catalyst only after reduction. Any additional phase (e.g. CuZn alloy phase) during reduction process was not detected. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the monometallic 1%Pd, 20%Cu and 20%Pd and bimetallic 1%Pd–20%Cu catalysts supported on spinel ZnAl2O4 structure after reduction at 300°C in 5%H2–95%Ar mixture or in pure hydrogen at 350°C. Additionally, the XRD pattern for 1%Pd/ZnAl2O4 catalyst calcined in air at 400°C for 4h was also given on the same picture to better visualize the differences in phase composition of the tested mono-and bimetallic catalysts. It is well known from the literature that PdZn alloy can be formed by the reduction of Pd/ZnO catalyst conducted at 150°C [55]. The reduction temperature of 350°C in the case of 20%Pd/ZnAl2O4 was selected in order to more clearly visualize the resulting PdZn phase. However, for copper and palladium–copper bimetallic catalysts the reduction temperature was 300°C in order to determine the phase composition of the tested systems before the reaction. The XRD curve recorded for copper catalyst 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 (curve 1) shows diffraction peaks stem from spinel ZnAl2O4 structure, metallic copper and zinc oxide phases. XRD pattern of 20%Pd/ZnAl2O4 catalyst after reduction at 350°C in pure H2 shows only diffraction peaks attributed to PdZn alloy [42–44,49,50] and spinel ZnAl2O4 structure (curve 2). The XRD patterns of reduced 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst (curve 3) show diffraction peaks shifted in comparison to metallic copper phase observed in 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 and to Pd–Zn intermetallic compound phase observed in the case of palladium catalyst. The position of these diffraction peaks indicates that these peaks originate from Pd to Cu intermetallic compound which is formed during reduction in 5%H2–95%Ar mixture. The formation of this compound is assigned to the facilitated reduction of copper(II) oxide to copper(I) oxide in the presence of palladium. The presence of diffraction peaks coming from Cu2O phase on the catalyst surface was confirmed by XRD measurement. The alloy formation can be explained by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen on palladium surface to atomic hydrogen which flows on copper oxide causing their reduction. In the next step the composition of PdCu alloy was calculated. The Vegard's law was used to determine the composition of the alloy [62]. Vegard's law is an approximate empirical rule which holds that a linear relation exists, at constant temperature, between the crystal lattice constant of an alloy and the concentrations of the constituent elements. The CuPd alloy is solid solution with cubic structure. In this case a linear combination of lattice spacing of the individual metal components and their mole fraction is given by equation: a CuPd = x Pd a Pd + ( 1 − x Pd ) a Cu where a is the lattice constant, and x is the mole fraction. Through the use of the lattice constant of pure Cu and that of the alloying atom (Pd), the lattice constant of the remainder of the alloy compositions between 0 and 100 can be estimated using Vegard's law. By the use of the simulated lattice spacing of Pd and Cu, Vegard's law was used to predict the mole fraction of Pd with lattice constant of PdCu alloy. The percentage of atomic palladium in the alloy was 2.5%. This result well agrees with the amount of Pd and Cu entered in the catalytic system. The initial amount of atomic Pd in the catalytic systems was about 2.9%. The discrepancy between the amount of introduced palladium and alloy composition may be due to the accuracy of the measurement technique. It should be taken into account that the palladium metal or palladium oxide phases were not visible because of the small amount of metal incorporated into the catalyst system (1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4). Lambert et al. [63] studied the phase composition of bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts (samples are denoted Pd–Cu (67–33), Pd–Cu (50–50) and Pd–Cu (33–67)—numbers in parentheses refer to the weight composition in the sample), and their catalytic properties for 1,2-dichloroethane hydrodechlorination. The authors showed XRD patterns for the remaining catalytic systems and noted that for all catalysts the broad peak was visible between (111) Bragg lines of Pd and Cu which was assigned to the presence of a solid solution. In addition, in the case of bimetallic Pd–Cu (33–67) catalyst, a second broad peak between the (200) Bragg lines of Pd and Cu was present which further confirmed the alloy formation between Pd and Cu. Derrouiche et al. [64] investigated the influence of different conditions of preparation of Cu/ZnO materials using TEM, XRD, and UV–visible techniques. Cu/ZnO systems were subjected to various post-synthesis treatments. The authors confirmed by XRD and UV–visible techniques that increasing reduction temperature to 350°C in pure H2 led to a progressive transformation of the metallic phase into Cu–Zn alloy Cu0 →Cu1−x Zn x (x <0.25)→Cu3Zn. On the XRD patterns of reduced Cu/ZnO catalyst extra diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈42.67°, 49.69°, and 88.33° were observed. The authors assigned the corresponding diffraction peaks neither to metallic copper, nor to copper oxide, or to metallic zinc, but they ascribed these diffraction peaks to the Cu3Zn phase (JCPDS file no. 65-6567: 42.673° (I =100) and 49.686° (I =43)). These results confirm that a copper–zinc alloy is formed during the reduction in hydrogen at 350°C. The authors claimed that alloy particles size depend on synthesis route and the copper precursor. This is directly related to the strength of the ligand field of the copper precursor. Yuanyuan et al. [65] synthesized ZnS whiskers using a simple CVD method, with the assistance of CuS microspheres. The structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction method. The XRD results confirmed besides of cubic zinc-blende ZnS phase, the presence of Cu3Zn alloy phase which originates from resource reagents, which are situated at 43.50°, 50.37°, 74.04°, and 89.78°, corresponding to its (111), (200), (220) and (311) faces, respectively. In order to investigate the oxidation state of the metal and the accessibility of the metals, CO adsorption followed by FT-IR spectroscopy were carried out. IR spectra of CO for monometallic: palladium, copper and palladium–copper supported catalysts after (precise description of the catalysts pretreatment are given in the experimental part of this work) evacuation of CO for 30min are shown in Fig. 5 . IR spectra of CO adsorbed species were recorded for 2%Pd/ZnAl2O4 (1-black curve), 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 (2-blue curve), 5%Pd/Al2O3 (3-green curve) and bimetallic 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 (4-red curve). The bands in the range 1970–1725cm−1 are assigned to CO in bridged configuration on Pd. The band located at 2075cm−1 is ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed (on-top) on Pd (see Fig. 5) [66,67]. The FT-IR spectrum collected for monometallic copper catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 exhibited only one band located between 2170 and 2060cm−1 assigned to CO linearly bonded to Cu0 and/or Cu+ [66,67]. It is well known that position of the CO band is strongly dependent on the metal particle size and/or surface roughness. If the CO band is broad both species can be present on the catalyst surface. It should be remembered that Cu+ cations form more stable surface carbonyls in comparison to the carbonyls of metallic Cu. However, it is difficult to distinguish between Cu+–CO and Cu0–CO species on the basis of the CO stretching frequency. In the case of bimetallic Pd–Cu catalyst supported on spinel structure only two bands were visible. The first band located between 2200 and 2095cm−1 is attributed to CO species linearly bonded to Cu+ species present on the catalyst surface were confirmed by XRD method. The position of the second band (band located between 2095 and 1950cm−1) did not overlap with the bands originating from the CO species adsorbed on palladium or copper supported catalysts. The position of this band suggests that this band does not come from any CO surface species adsorbed on Cu0 and/or Cu+ or on palladium, but from CO surface species adsorbed on PdCu alloy compound [68]. Topsøe et al. [69] studied the nature of surface structural changes of Cu/ZnO methanol synthesis catalysts using IR method. The authors carried out the IR measurements for various CuO/ZnO catalysts after reduction at 220, 260 and 300°C. The results for Cu/ZnO catalysts clearly showed a progressive intensity decrease for the observed band (located at about 2096cm−1 and 2080cm−1 for 1%Cu/ZnO and 5%CuO/ZnO catalysts, respectively). The position of this band was shifted downwards from 2085 to 2083cm−1 and afterwards to 2067cm−1 during increasing of reduction temperature from 220 to 260°C and further to 300°C. The authors claimed that observed significant frequency shifts and changes as a function of the severity of the reduction treatment cannot be interpreted solely by changes in morphology and abundance of different Cu surface planes. On the contrary, the band shifts are related to the formation of Cu–Zn surface alloys under more severe reduction conditions. The physicochemical properties of bimetallic Pd–Cu supported catalysts and their catalytical activity in denitration reaction were investigated by Sá et al. [66]. To elucidate the interaction between active phase component (Pd, Cu) IR measurements were carried out for Pd–Cu catalysts after reduction at various temperatures. The authors reported that increasing of the reduction temperature caused migration of metallic copper to the top of the palladium particles and onto the support. Furthermore, free palladium particles were found on the support surface. In order to elucidate the interaction between active phase component and support XPS analysis was carried out for 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 after calcinations, reduction and reaction. XPS spectra of bimetallic 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 supported catalysts used in the study are presented in Fig. 6 . XPS spectra of Cu for all bimetallic catalysts are shown in Fig. 6. The XPS high resolution spectra of the binding energies between 927 and 972eV show several characteristic peaks. The peak in the region of 930–940eV includes Cu2+ species (936eV) (Cu 2p3/2), metallic Cu0 (932.7eV) and Cu+ (932.4eV) [60,70–72]. The peaks at about 943eV and 963eV are characteristic only for Cu2+ species and are of particular interest. One can see a significant decrease in the intensity of the peaks at about 933.5eV corresponding to Cu2+ species for sample after reduction and reaction relative to the intensity of the Cu0/Cu+ component. This is also associated with almost complete disappearance of the satellite Cu2+ after reaction. The percentage of Cu2+ and Cu0/Cu+ obtained after deconvolution of the Cu 2p XPS spectra of 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 for fresh (only after calcinations at 400°C) and for reduced catalysts in 5%H2–95%Ar at 300°C and after reaction are presented in Table 1 . Quantification of the atomic percentage of the chemical elements on the sample surface obtained from the XPS survey spectra is presented in Table 1S of the supplementary information. Small increase in the concentration of carbon after reduction was observed. The XPS data indicates that the Cu species are reduced to metallic Cu and/or Cu+ and is in a good agreement with TPR data discussed above. The increased content of Cu/Cu+ species after reduction and reaction confirms that addition of palladium into copper catalyst facilitates the reduction process. Fig. 7 shows the methanol steam reforming reactivity results for the mono (copper and palladium) and bimetallic palladium–copper supported catalysts after reduction at 300°C in 5%H2–95%Ar mixture. Fig. 7A shows the methanol conversion as a function of temperature, whereas Fig. 7B presents the hydrogen yield in steam reforming of methanol. The catalytic activity results of the copper catalysts in SRM show that increasing of copper loading from 5 to 20wt.% leads to an enhanced methanol conversion. Further increase of the copper content to 60wt.% (60%Cu/ZnAl2O4) leads to decrease in methanol conversion. Whereas, the palladium catalyst showed the lowest conversion of methanol and hydrogen yield in steam reforming of methanol in the studied temperature range. In addition, promotion of copper catalyst 20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 by palladium does not cause increased methanol conversion, but leads to a significant increase in the hydrogen yield. These results clearly confirm the promotion effect of palladium on hydrogen selectivity of copper catalysts and can be explained by the formation of PdCu intermetallic compound during the reduction process. The increase in selectivity in the degradation of nitrates over Pd–Cu catalysts was previously reported [66]. The authors assigned the increasing of reaction selectivity to the PdCu compound formation. The same trend was observed in the present study. The PdCu alloy formation enhanced the selectivity to hydrogen production. The observed trend is associated with the RWGS (reverse water gas shift) reaction which runs in a limited extent over the bimetallic catalyst. During RWGS reaction CO2 and H2 transform to CO and H2O which explains the selectivity to hydrogen below 100%. Bichon et al. [73] investigated Pd promoted CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 in steam reforming of methanol. They observed that the increase in activity after palladium promotion was moderate, and is accompanied by a large increase in CO production. Palladium doped copper catalysts exhibited faster start-up without pre-reduction, thus improving the dynamics of the system. Pd improved the decomposition of methanol, which was negative in terms of CO production, but had a positive effect on the start-up characteristics of the copper Cu–Zn based catalyst. Chang et al. [74] studied Pd promoted CuO/ZnO/Al2O3(30/60/10) catalyst in oxidative steam reforming of methanol and confirmed that the noble metal improved the reducibility of copper based catalysts, but also enhanced the dissociative adsorption of methanol. Furthermore, palladium promoted the split and adsorption of atomic hydrogen during the dehydrogenation of the intermediates reaction which takes place during OSRM. This promotion effect contributes directly to increase the activity of the catalyst system. In the case of a copper catalyst intermetallic compound was not formed. This result indicates that the intermetallic compound is created by the influence of palladium. The formation of this compound is explained by the facilitated reduction of copper oxide by atomic hydrogen which flows from the palladium surface. Moreover, the formation of intermetallic compound revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pd and Cu. These characteristics were found to originate from the unique structure of highly dispersed Pd in Cu bimetallic particles [57]."
6,Conclusions,To the best of our knowledge this study provides the evidence of PdCu alloy compound formation in a 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst after reduction at 300°C in reduction mixture 5%H2–95%Ar. This is a result of a spillover effect between palladium and metallic copper what has been confirmed by XRD and FTIR techniques. The catalytic properties of copper and bimetallic palladium–copper supported catalysts were compared in steam reforming of methanol. The higher selectivity of the bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts can be explained by PdCu alloy compound formation. The presence of Cu+ and Cu0 species on the catalysts surface after reduction in 5%H2–95%Ar and after reaction was confirmed by XPS. The highest concentration of Cu+ and Cu0 exhibited bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts after reduction. The higher hydrogen production and selectivity to hydrogen formation in steam reforming of methanol of the reduced 1%Pd–20%Cu/ZnAl2O4 catalyst is explained by intermetallic PdCu alloy formation.
