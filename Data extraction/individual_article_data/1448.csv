0,Introduction,"Lignin, the most abundant, renewable aromatic biopolymers on earth, is comprised of non-identical phenolic units interconnected by a network of CC and CO bonds. It is regarded as a potential substitute for aromatic chemicals and platform compounds. Though acidolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation technologies, C-O-C linkages in lignin can be selectively cleaved into phenolic monomers or cyclic compounds [1–8]. Among these technologies, hydrogenolysis allows direct access to valuable platform chemicals by the cleavage of CC and CO bonds in lignin. However, some hydrogenolysis processes require high pressure and temperature and excess amount of H2 gas. Alternatively, the using of hydrogen-donor molecules such as formic acid and alcohols has been reported to generate in-situ hydrogen in the reductive depolymerization or hydrogenation of lignin and models [9–11]. Photocatalysis was recently emerged as a potential alternative to degrade organic compounds. It is commonly accepted that the generated electrons and holes are responsible when the photocatalyst is exposed to light enough for energy. In photocatalytic reduction process, alcohols are usually used as hole scavengers that undergo fast and irreversible oxidation, thus making photo-generated electrons more readily available for the reaction. Recent years, considerable attention has been paid to photocatalytic acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation reactions, in which alcohols are dehydrogenated to form aldehydes/ketones or successive reaction products, with simultaneous liberation of H2 molecule [12–15]. Based on the integration of acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohol and in situ consumption of generated hydrogen equivalents [16,17], several groups have developed photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation systems for hydrogenative cyclization and reduction of NO without using molecular H2 at moderate temperatures [18–20]. In the research of photocatalytic depolymerization of lignins, most studies are focused on oxidation of lignin and its models [21–25]. Very few works were devoted to the photo-induced reduction of lignin and models. In this study, attention is paid to the CO cleavage in β-O-4 ketone of lignin model by a simple TiO2 photocatalytic reaction. An attempt will be also made to demonstrate the hydrogen transfer system mediated by ethanol oxidation into ketone hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Commercial Degussa TiO2 titanium dioxide (P25), with 80% anatase and 20% of rutile, was used in the present work without any treatment. β-O-4 models were synthesized according to the previous procedures [26]. In a typical synthesis of 2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethanone (named as 1), 4-O-methyl- bromoacetophenone (10mmol, 2.299g) was added to a stirred solution of K2CO3 (15mmol, 2.072g) and guaiacol (12.5mmol, 1.552g) in acetone (100mL). The mixture was stirred at 100°C for 5h, after which it was filtered off and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography with hexane: ethyl acetate (3:1)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Metal doped TiO2 (M/TiO2, M=Pd, Ni, Co, Ag, Cu) was prepared by a wet-impregnation and photochemical-reduction method similar to the procedures described by Li et al. [27]. The metal loading in these catalysts was set as 10wt%. In the typical preparation of Pd/TiO2, 81mg of TiO2 was first dispersed into 20mL water. A solution of PdCl2 in 2M HCl was added into the TiO2 dispersion and stirred overnight. A certain amount of NaOH solution was added until the pH value was 13. Then, 10mL of NaBH4 (0.1mol/L) was added dropwisely at a temperature below 15°C. After 6h, the obtained mixture was separated, washed with distilled water and dried at 60°C for 12h. The fresh catalyst was further reduced by a photochemical method under the irradiation of a commercial UV lamp (15W) for one week at room temperature."
4,Reaction procedures and analysis,"2.3 Reaction procedures and analysis 0.02mmol substrate 1 and 10mg catalyst were added to 5mL ethanol in a 10mL quartz tube, and then purged with N2 for 5min before reaction. To initiate the reaction, the quartz tube was irradiated with a 250W high pressure Hg lamp under N2 atmosphere. Main wavelength of the lamp was around 365nm, and the light intensity was 6mW/cm2, with the distance between lamp and quartz tube of 10cm. The products were quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) on an Agilent 6890/5973N instrument equipped with an HP-5 MS column (30m in length, 0.25mm in diameter). The temperature was initially kept at 60°C for 2min, then was heated at a rate of 15°C/min to 260°C, and maintained for another 2min. Conversion and yield were determined using decane as the internal standard."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone,"3.1 Hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone To evaluate the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 for CO cleavage of lignin, β-O-4 ketone 1 was selected as a model compound, and the results are shown in Table 1 . Usually, the cleavage of lignin needs to be performed under a high temperature even in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts [28]. As expected, the transformation of 1 was fairly low by heating at 160°C for 240min without any catalysts (entry 1). UV photolysis dramatically accelerated the decomposition of the model, with a conversion sharply increased to 73.6% in a short time of 30min, and a low yield of 4-methoxy acetophenone (a) and o-methoxyphenol (b) (entry 2), suggesting the efficient cleavage of CO bond in β-O-4 ketone under UV light irradiation under N2 atmosphere. When the same photo reaction was performed in the presence of TiO2, a further increase of the conversion to 89.8% was observed. Moreover, the yield of a and b was significantly improved to 75.2% and 98.9% respectively (entry 3). This may be caused by the participation of the produced photo-generated electron and hydrogen from the solvent as the reductive species. In addition, when N2 atmosphere was replaced by air atmosphere, the transformation of substrate 1 to corresponding products (a and b) declined substantially, with or without TiO2 (entry 4 and 5), suggesting the importance of oxygen-free condition for the reaction. Thus, these results represented a simple and efficient method focused on photo-induced hydrogenolysis of CO in β-O-4 ketone into aromatic fragments."
7,Mechanism investigation,"3.2 Mechanism investigation Presumably the β-O-4 ketone hydrogenolysis occurs by photocatalytic hydrogen transfer mechanism, active hydrogen should be generated from an oxidative reaction. Then the simple photochemistry only contains solvent of ethanol, TiO2 and UV radiation, so the active hydrogen may come from the radiated ethanol. Recently, many researchers were devoted to H2 generation from neat or aqueous aliphatic alcohol by photocatalytic technology, during which the primary and secondary alcohols can be effectively dehydrogenated to aldehydes or ketones through radicals with the evolution of H2 gas [18,29]. Based on this, it is guessed that alcohol dehydrogenation reaction may occur in our study. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology was then used for in situ analysis of intermediate species during the reaction, using DMPO as a radical trapping agent. As shown from Fig. 1 , 1-hydroxylethyl radical was formed as the main active species in the irradiated TiO2-ethanol suspension. It is reported as a key radical intermediate in the oxidation of ethanol [30–32]. After adding substrate 1 in the suspension, there was a significant shift in some resonance signals. The change was consistent with another photocatalytic intermolecular hydrogen transfer reaction, suggesting the formation of new intermediates [20]. In addition, 1,1-diethoxyethane was found in the GC–MS spectrum during the photocatalytic hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone (Fig. 2 ), further indicating the existence of alcohol dehydrogenation reaction in our system. Thus, it can be deduced that the active hydrogen liberated from ethanol dehydrogenation will participate in the photocatalytic reduction of substrate 1 by a photocatalytic hydrogen transfer process, with ethanol used as solvent and hydrogen donor at the same time. Usually, photocatalytic reaction does not efficiently proceed on bare TiO2, mainly due to the rapid recombination of photo-produced electron-hole pairs, which largely reduces the fraction of photo-generated charge carriers [33]. The presence of ethanol as a hole sacrifice agent can prevent the electron-hole recombination, and increase the alcohol dehydrogenation and β-O-4 ketone hydrogenolysis. Evenly, the hydrogen transfer hydrogenlysis could be happened directly between ethanol and the substrate, with the substrate conversion as high as 73.6% from the result of Table 1 (entry 2)."
8,Effect of reaction parameters,"3.3 Effect of reaction parameters The influence of solvents on the photo-hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone was performed. As shown in Table 2 , the reaction conducted in ethanol showed the highest conversion of 89.8% and the best yields of a and b (entry 1); while in isopropanol and tert-butanol, the conversion was decreased, accompanied by a dramatic decrease of product yields (entry 3–4). The reason may be that, alcohol solvents are not only performed as proton sources, but also as hole scavengers, which undergoes fast and irreversible oxidation, thus making photo-promoted electrons more readily available for β-O-4 ketone reduction. Furthermore, the produced electrons from lower viscosity alcohols are more easily access to catalyst surface. In non proton donor of acetonitrile, the reaction showed a conversion of 70.1% but low product yields (entry 5). When toluene or 1, 4-dioxane were used, the CO band cleavage occurred rarely (entry 7 and 8). The poor result may be due to the inability of the solvent to producing any reactive species under the reaction conditions. H2O is one of the most widely used proton source in photo-reduction reaction, so the effect of water was also detected. From entry 6, it can be found that the solvent of ethanol with 5% (w/v) H2O showed high conversion but low target product yields. It is deduced that the addition of H2O into ethanol decreases the solubility of β-O-4 ketone. In addition, H2O was preferentially adsorbed on TiO2 and provided most hydrogen protons to produce hydrogen [29], which was disadvantageous for the subsequent hydrogen transfer reaction of the non water-soluble substrate."
9,Hydrogenolysis of different β-O-4 model compounds,"3.4 Hydrogenolysis of different β-O-4 model compounds Mild photocatalytic reaction allows for fast reductive cleavage of β-O-4 lignin model 1 to methoxyl phenyl ketones and guaiacol with high yields. Then the hydrogenolysis of CO bond was studied in more detail by varying the substrates (Table 3 ). It can be found that the hydrogenolysis reaction is influenced by the reactivity of the carbonyl and non-carbonyl portions of the molecule. The remove of methoxyl group in either the ketone part or the phenol part resulted in much lower substrate conversion during long reaction time (entry 1 and 2), indicating the electron donating action of methoxyl group on benzene ring. Also, the substitution of phenyl ketone with methyl ketone did not initiate any transformation in 120min photocatalytic process (entry 3). These are presumably due to the larger reduction potential of methyl ketones in comparison to phenyl ketones. On the contrary, a substrate bearing an α-acetoxy group instead of guaiacol reached similar conversion as 1 (entry 4 and 5), indicating that the reaction rate is strongly influenced by the pKa of the leaving group, as reported in literature [26]. Compared to β-O-4 ketone, the corresponding alcohol underwent somewhat fragmentation under much longer time of photocatalytic reaction, but the target hydrogenolysis product was almost impossible to detected (entry 6). Then it was proved again that the cleavage of β-O-4 ketone was much easier than β-O-4 alcohol [26]."
10,Hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation with metal doped TiO2,"3.5 Hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation with metal doped TiO2 In general, noble metals, such as palladium, platinum and nickel, have been used to modify semiconductors to enhance their photocatalytic performance [18,23]. The reactivity of 1 was tested in the presence of different metals supported TiO2 during the photocatalytic reaction (Table 4 ). The Ni, Co and Ag supported TiO2 catalysts were active under comparable conditions for the ether hydrogenolysis. There was no considerable improvement in the substrate conversion and the product yields, and nearly no other product was detected (entry 1–3). This was consistent with the result of Wang et al. [34], who speculated that metal particles loaded on TiO2 surface may cover the Ti3+ active sites and suppress the adsorption of substrate, thus giving inferior results of hydrogenolysis. On the contrary, Pd/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 catalysts underwent efficient hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, with different major products identified (entry 4 and 5). For example, in the presence of Pd/TiO2, the ketone afforded hydrogenolysis cleavage with good yields of product a (63.4%) and b (8.3%), together with hydrogenation of ketone to alcohol d (53.6%), and small amounts of the reductive products of c (2.5%) from the product of a (entry 5). Interestingly, the conversion was decreased, and there was no product of d while N2 was replaced by air atmosphere (entry 6), indicating again that nitrogen atmosphere is a necessary condition for the photocatalytic reaction of β-O-4 ketone. Then the fact of CO bond cleavage and reductive products showed in the results suggested that, hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation were coexisted in the Pd/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 photocatalytic reactions, and the catalysts of Pd/TiO2 or Cu/TiO2 may have bifunctional active sites composed of metal (for hydrogenation) and TiO2 sites (for hydrogenolysis), resulting in a bifunctional pathway for CO hydrogenolysis followed by metal-catalyzed hydrogenation. Accordingly, XPS analysis of the Pd/TiO2 was carried out to check the presence of palladium species on the catalyst surface (Fig. S1). In the fitted Pd 3d 5/2 spectrum, Pd 3d5/2 (334.95eV), Pd 3d3/2 (340.3eV) and Pd 3d5/2 (336.7eV), Pd 3d3/2 (342.1eV) can be assigned to Pd0 and Pd2+ species, respectively. The ratio of Pd0/Pd2+ on the surface of catalyst was as high as 1:1. It is reasonable to predict that the metallic state Pd0 has a certain effect in the hydrogenation of ketone to alcohol. In order to verify this, several different Pd/TiO2 catalysts were tested for the photochemical reaction. From the result of Table S1, it can be found that the Pd/TiO2 without the photo-chemistry treatment showed slightly higher activity than the other metal/TiO2 catalysts but much lower than the radiated catalyst. Notably, there was no product of d in the non-radiated Pd/TiO2 or PdO2/TiO2 groups, indicating that the supported Pd0 on TiO2 functioned as the active sites for direct hydrogenation of CO to CHOH by transferring hydrogen from ethanol to substrate."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we report a high efficient hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone in ethanol under UV irradiation with TiO2 as the catalyst. During the photocatalytic hydrogen transfer system, active hydrogen generated from ethanol oxidation reaction participated in the hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 ketone. In the Pd/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 photocatalytic reactions, two pathways for CO hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation were coexisted, with the ketone cleaved into methoxyl phenyl ketones and guaiacol, and together with hydrogenated directly to alcohol."
