0,Introduction,"Water pollution with heavy metals is a major global problem. Heavy metals have a high atomic weight between 63.5 and 200.6 and a density of at least five times greater than that of water [1–6]. These non-biodegradable metals accumulate in living organisms. Heavy metals are released into the wastewater from industries such as metal- plating, dyeing operations and pigment production [7–12]. Chromium is one of the most toxic pollutants which cause severe environmental and public health problems. The most common forms of chromium are Cr(0), Cr(III), and Cr(VI). The hexavalent form is more toxic than trivalent and requires more concern. Strong exposure to Cr(VI) causes cancer in the digestive tract and lungs and may cause epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea and hemorrhage [12–16]. It is very soluble and can easily accumulate in the human and other creature's bodies [17]. According to the world health organization (WHO) the maximum permissible amount of hexavalent chrome in potable water is 0.05 mg/L [18]. There are several methods for heavy metal removal from an aqueous solution such as membrane separation, chemical precipitation, adsorption and ion exchange [19]. These methods have some disadvantages like high energy and reagent requirement, generation of toxic sludge or waste product which need to be treated. But adsorption is a much more effective method used extensively for heavy metal removal.it has low cost and chemical stability. Activated carbon, biological material, fly ash and chitosan are conventional adsorbents for the adsorption process [20]. Activated carbon (AC) has a porous structure with a big surface area it is abundant and economical. It has also high adsorption capacity, functional groups and chemical stability. Activated carbon is very effective in removing organic and mineral compounds from water due to its inexpensiveness, high surface area, and high porosity. Activated carbon is far more important than other adsorbents such as functionalized polymers like resins in organic dyes removal due to their disadvantages such as low surface area or low adsorption capacity [10]. However, it is a non-biodegradable adsorbent and has a hard regeneration process [21]. Susmita et al. studied the hexavalent chrome removal from aqueous solution by microporous activated carbon from Aegle marmelos shell. According to the results, the maximum removal percentage was 82.3% at pH = 2 [22]. Wenmi et al. used AC/CoFe2O4 composite for hexavalent chrome adsorption from wastewater. Results showed that the adsorption capacity of AC/CoFe2O4 is much better than activated carbon. In addition, the magnetic property of AC/CoFe2O4 revealed that this adsorbent can be separated easily with a magnet [23]. Yang et al. used activated carbon prepared from Longan seed in order to remove hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution. According to the results equilibrium data follows second-order kinetic and also Langmuir isotherm. This was an effective adsorbent for hexavalent chromium removal from aqueous solution. In recent years, the use of cheaper adsorbents like chitosan has been paid more attention. Chitosan (CS) is a nontoxic and biodegradable polymer produced from chitin extracted from shrimp and crab shell [8,24]. CS, as one of the most naturally abundant and cheapest biopolymers, has been broadly investigated as an adsorbent for pollutant removal. It is a natural adsorbent with high selectivity and lots of functional groups such as amin groups (NH2) and hydroxyl groups (OH) which has good chelation with ions and provides enough active sites for capturing of pollutants. It can interact with pollutant ions of the solution by ion exchange or other complexation reactions due to the presence of amino groups on the polymer matrix [8]. Sun et al. used the nanoparticles of magnetic silica with chitosan for hexavalent chrome removal from acidic aqueous solution. Results showed that this adsorbent has a good capability for chrome removal [25]. Higher pH values are more favorable for adsorption of heavy metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ on chitosan, while adsorption of hexavalent chrome will be favorable at lower pH values. It is attributed to anionic forms of chrome in aqueous solution which contain CrO4 2 −, HCrO4 −, HCr2O7 −, Cr2O7 2 −. This means that chitosan is not suitable for chrome adsorption because it has low acidic resistance and also is soluble in dilute acid solutions [26]. Chitosan also forms a gel in acidic condition making hydroxyl and amine groups non-accessible for metal bonding [27]. Therefore, the material should be added to improve chemical stability in acidic condition. In this research, Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) is added to the chitosan structure overcome this limitation. PVA is a cheap and nontoxic polymer used for immobilization of microorganisms in wastewater treatment. In addition, it has well mechanical strength with active hydroxyl groups which easily modified with different functional groups [28]. PVA forms hydrogen bonds with amin groups in chitosan and strengthen it by making extra active sites. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the use of Chitosan/Poly Vinyl Alcohol/Activated Carbon beads for chrome removal from aqueous solutions. Further, the synthesized adsorbent was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared analysis. In addition, the effect of different parameters such as pH, chrome concentration, contact time, temperature and adsorbent dosage on chrome adsorption was investigated. Kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were studied to evaluate the performance of the synthesized adsorbent for chrome removal."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly Vinyl Alcohol (C2H4O) and chitosan (C6H11NO4) with medium molecular weight purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium nitrate (KNO3), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), and activated carbon (with particle size < 100 μm) were Merck analytical grade and were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of chitosan/poly vinyl alcohol (CS/PVA) biocomposite,"2.2 Synthesis of chitosan/poly vinyl alcohol (CS/PVA) biocomposite First, 4 g chitosan was solved in 100 mL of acidic acid 3% (v/v) and was stirred for 2 h in 65 °C. Then, the PVA solution was prepared by adding 4 g PVA powder into 100 mL of deionized water and refluxing for 5 h in 70 °C. Finally, CS/PVA adsorbent prepared with mixing of two mentioned precursor in the ratio of 2:1 under stirring for 1 h in 70 °C."
4,Synthesis of chitosan/poly vinyl alcohol/activated carbon (CS/PVA/AC) biocomposite,"2.3 Synthesis of chitosan/poly vinyl alcohol/activated carbon (CS/PVA/AC) biocomposite At first, 1.33 g of AC was added to CS/PVA solution prepared based on the procedure described before and was stirred for 1 h. Then this solution was kept at room temperature for 24 h in order to provide a homogenous solution. After that, this solution was injected into the 0.5 M NaOH solution by a syringe to form a bead and was stirred for 1 h at room temperature in order to solidify the beads. These beads were filtered from the NaOH solution and were washed with deionized water to neutral pH. Finally, the beads were dried at room temperature (Fig. 1 )."
5,Adsorption procedure,"2.4 Adsorption procedure The removal of chrome (VI) from a 60 ppm dichromate potassium aqueous solution was done and the effect of parameters like pH, AC percentage, initial solution concentration, contact time, the adsorbent dosage was investigated. The solution pH was adjusted by 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M H2SO4. After that, the pH of the solutions was measured to determine the pHPZC. After the experiments the adsorbent was separated from the solution by a filter paper and a UV-spectrophotometer (Sanjesh-Sp 2000 UV-spectrophotometer) was used to specify the concentration of a solution by measuring its absorbance value at λ = 390 nm. The amount of chrome adsorbed on the adsorbent surface and the removal percentage was determined by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively: (1) q e = C 0 − C e m × V (2) % Removal = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 where, q e is the equilibrium chrome value (mg/g), V is the volume of the solution (L), m is the weight of adsorbent and C0 and Ce are initial and final concentrations (mg/L) of the solution, respectively. For the investigation of the effect of contact time on adsorption and kinetic study, a series of experiments were carried out in which 0.1 g adsorbent come in contact with 125 mL of potassium dichromate with a concentration of 60 ppm at different contact times. For the investigation of isotherms, thermodynamics, and the effect of temperature on the adsorption process, the adsorption experiments were performed at different temperatures ranges from 25 °C to 55 °C. The effect of activated carbon percentage in the adsorbent was performed by conducting a set of experiments at different percentages of activated carbon (4%, 7%, and 10%). To study the effect of pH, some experiments are performed at different pH levels from 2 to 6. For the investigation of the Effect of potassium dichromate concentration on adsorption, 0.1 g adsorbent was contacted with a potassium dichromate solution at different concentrations. For the determination of pHPZC, a KNO3 solution (0.1 M) was used to determine the pHPZC point [29]. Then 0.1 g of adsorbent (CS/PVA/AC) was added to the aforementioned solution and agitated more than equilibrium contact time."
6,Result and discussion,
7,FTIR results,"3.1 FTIR results FTIR results for chitosan/Poly Vinyl Alcohol, activated carbon and chitosan/Poly Vinyl Alcohol/activated carbon are shown in Fig. 2a,b, and c, respectively. Amino and hydroxyl are very important functional groups in the chitosan structure. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a the peak in 3386 cm− 1 shows stretching vibration of OH. Peaks also at 1376 cm− 1 can be related to the NH vibration in NH2. Adsorption peaks at 2920.6 and 2852.2 cm− 1 shown in Fig. 2b are due to CH aliphatic stretching and OCH3 aldehyde group respectively. Peaks in 1549 and 1417 cm− 1 also show stretching vibration of CO in carbonyl group and vibration deformation of CO and OH in carboxylic acid respectively. Fig. 2c shows the FTIR spectrum of chrome adsorbed On CS/PVA/AC composite. The peak in 1073 cm− 1 shows NH scissoring from amines and amides groups and reveals that the CS/PVA is covered by activated carbon successfully."
8,SEM results,"3.2 SEM results Morphology and surface characteristics of synthesized adsorbents before and after the adsorption process were determined with SEM images. Fig. 3 shows SEM images for internal surface area for spherical CS/PVA and CS/PVA/AC biocomposites. As can be seen from Fig. 3a and b CS/PVA has a smooth surface area without any pores in its structure that can't be effective for adsorption. Fig. 3c,d shows the surface morphology of chitosan/poly vinyl alcohol)/AC. According to these figures, the surface of adsorbent has been a more porous structure with the presence of activated carbon providing more opportunity for adsorbate."
9,Adsorption procedure results,"3.3 Adsorption procedure results 3.3.1 Effect of contact time on adsorption and kinetic study Contact time is a factor should be inevitably considered for economic treatments of wastewater. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 , equilibrium was approached within about 225 min. There are high concentrations of chrome in solution and also a large number of vacant adsorption sites in the initial adsorption stages resulting in a more effective collision between chrome ions and adsorption sites. Therefore, chrome is more rapidly adsorbed at the early hours. After that with the saturation of surface adsorption sites, the adsorption process continues slowly through the deeper positions within the adsorbent structure. This will cause the rate of adsorption to become slow and the adsorption rate decreases gradually over time until reaches the equilibrium point. The kinetic data evaluation can provide useful information about an adsorption mechanism. Here, three kinetic models including, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic equations and intraparticle diffusion examined to describe the chrome ion adsorption process. The liner form of the Pseudo -First-order kinetic is given by Eq. (3). (3) log q e − q t = log q e − k 1 2.303 × t k1 is kinetic constant (min− 1),qe is equilibrium metal uptake (mg/g), qt is metal uptake in time t (mg/g). k1 and qe can be obtained from intercept and slope of diagram log(qe-qt) versus t as shown in Fig. 5a. As seen in this figure kinetic doesn't have good compatibility with experimental data. The calculated values also are given in Table 3. The pseudo-second-order kinetic is described as Eq. (4). (4) t q t = 1 k 2 q e 2 + t q e k2 is kinetic constant (mg− 1 min− 1), qe is an equilibrium amount of metal adsorbed (mg/g) which determines from intercept and slope of the equation t/qt versus t. qt is also metal adsorbed in time t (mg/g) which shown in Table 1 . The linear fit for this model in Fig. 5b. shows that chromium removal by this adsorbent can be approximated by pseudo-second-order kinetic. The intraparticle diffusion model uses to investigate diffusion mechanism and given by Eq. (5) [30]. (5) q t = k p t 1 2 + C qt is the amount of metal adsorbed per minute (mg/g), kp is intra-particle diffusion constant, C is intercept related to the thickness of the boundary layer. The values of kp and C can be calculated from the slope and the intercept of the plot of qt versus t0.5. The diagram of this model shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Table 1 pseudo-second-order kinetic has the highest correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.998) confirming the better compatibility of this model with experimental data. 3.3.2 Adsorption isotherm Isotherm studies describe the behavior of adsorbent and express a relationship between the amount of adsorbate taken up by adsorbent and the adsorbate concentration in solution at equilibrium. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are mostly employed to describe the adsorption process behavior. The linear forms of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are as Eqs. (6) and (8), respectively. (6) C e q e = C e q m + 1 bq m where Ce (mg/L) is equilibrium concentration and qe (mg/g) is equilibrium capacity. b (L/mg) and qm (mg/g) are Langmuir constants related to the adsorption energy and maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent respectively and determined from intercept and slope of diagram Ce/qe versus Ce. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . The characteristic of the Langmuir model can be described with the dimensionless separation factor (RL) based on Eq. (4). (7) R L = 1 1 + bC 0 In this equation, b is Langmuir constant and C0 is initial concentration (mg/L). Values of R L > 1 suggest that isotherm is undesirable, R L = 1 corresponds to linear isotherms and 0 < R L < 1 shows that isotherm is desirable. In this study, as can be seen from Table 2 , the calculated values of R L at different concentrations confirm that the Langmuir isotherms are desirable. Freundlich assumes a heterogeneous surface with different adsorption energies. According to Eq. (8), KF and n are also Freundlich constants determining the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. These constants can be obtained from intercept and slope of diagram log qe versus Ce respectively as shown in Fig. 6. The calculated values of these constants are given in Table 3 . (8) log q e = log K F + 1 n log C e According to the data reported in Table 3, a higher correlation coefficient obtained from Langmuir isotherm reveals that there is good compatibility with experimental data comparison with the Freundlich model. 3.3.3 Thermodynamic studies The values Gibbs energy (∆G), entropy (∆S) and enthalpy (∆H), can be obtained by Eqs. (9) to (11), respectively [11]. (9) Δ G = − RT ln k d (10) ln k d = − Δ H RT + Δ S R (11) Δ G = Δ H − T Δ S In these equations kd is distribution factor, T is temperature (K) and R is universal gas constant (8.314 kJ/mol·K). The values of enthalpy and entropy obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of Ln K vs. 1/T as shown in Fig. 7 . Then Gibbs energy can be calculated from Eq. (11). The values of these parameters are shown in Table 4 . The negative values for Gibbs energy and enthalpy reveal that the adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic. Entropy is the degree of disorder. The negative value of entropy means that there is a decrease in disordering."
10,Effect of activated carbon percentage in the adsorbent,"3.4 Effect of activated carbon percentage in the adsorbent This effect was investigated by conducting a set of experiments at different percentages of activated carbon. Results have been shown in Fig. 8 . Removal percentage increases with an increase in the amount of activated carbon which may be related to the increase in the surface porosity [15]. Therefore, the activated carbon used for adsorbent synthesis was 10 wt%."
11,Effect of pH on adsorption,"3.5 Effect of pH on adsorption Solution pH is one of the most important factors affecting adsorption behavior. To study the effect of pH, some experiments are performed at different pH levels. As demonstrated in Fig. 9 , chrome adsorption decreases when pH increases from 2 to 6. In acidic conditions, the anionic form of hexavalent chrome (HCrO4 −) is predominant. Because of electrostatic forces between adsorbent and adsorbate ions removal percentage is better in acidic condition [31]. There are a lot of H+ ions in acidic pH neutralizing negative charges on the adsorbent surface so that chromate ions (HCrO4 −) can penetrate to the adsorbent bulk easily. Thus, pH = 2 is chosen as an optimum pH for other experiments. 3.5.1 pHPZC pHPZC is a point in which the surface charge of adsorbent is zero. At pH,>.pHPZC the surface charge of the adsorbent is negative and at pH < .pHPZC the charge is positive. According to the results shown in Fig. 10 . pHPZC = 4.9 obtained for this adsorbent. It means that at pH lower than 4.9 the adsorbent surface charge is positive which bonds with hydrogen chromate ions. At pH larger than 4.9 the negative surface charge of the adsorbent repulses the hydrogen chromate ions and adsorption decreases significantly [32]."
12,Effect of potassium dichromate concentration on adsorption,"3.6 Effect of potassium dichromate concentration on adsorption The adsorbent was contacted with a potassium dichromate solution at different concentrations. Results have been shown in Fig. 11 . The removal percentage of chrome depends on initial concentration. The amount of chrome adsorbed increases with solution initial concentration. Primary, adsorption progresses quickly and then its rate decreases gradually until it became constant at an equilibrium point. At high ion concentrations, the decrease in the number of active sites leads to a decrease in removal percentage [33]. As shown in Fig. 7 the amount of chrome adsorbed increases from 69 mg/g to 106 mg/g when initial concentrations increase from 60 ppm to 110 ppm, respectively. The equilibrium reaches 110 ppm. Increasing initial concentration increases the driving force of adsorption of chrome and leads to an increase in adsorption capacity [34]."
13,Effect of temperature on adsorption,"3.7 Effect of temperature on adsorption Adsorption experiments were performed at optimum conditions at different temperatures ranges. The results are shown in Fig. 12 . Adsorption and removal percentage decreases with an increase in temperature. At high temperatures, kinetic energy is more than the electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and chrome ions resulting in a decrease in adsorption capacity [35]. According to the results, the adsorption process is exothermic for this adsorbent."
14,Effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process,"3.8 Effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process For this experiment, all of the effective parameters, except adsorbent dosage, kept constant at pre-determined optimum condition. According to Fig. 13 , the removal percentage increases with adsorbent dosage. It can be related to an increase in surface area of adsorbent resulting from the increase in the number of active sites in comparison with the number of chrome ions. However, the adsorption capacity decreases due to an increase in saturated adsorption sites [30]."
15,Comparison of another adsorbent with present adsorbent,"3.9 Comparison of another adsorbent with present adsorbent In this section different adsorbents compared with CS/PVA/AC for chrome adsorption. According to Table 5 , the adsorption capacity for present adsorbent is 109.89 (mg/g) which is the highest one than the others. So it can be used extensively for chrome removal from aqueous solution."
16,Conclusion,"Synthesis of the CS/PVA/AC adsorbent was performed and the adsorbent was used to hexavalent chromium removal from aqueous solution. SEM images showed that the adsorbent surface of CS/PVA/AC has a lot of pores resulting in an increase in adsorption. Based on FTIR results CS/PVA/AC has special peaks in 1073 cm− 1 for NH scissoring from amines and amides. Adsorption experiment results revealed that using activated carbon in CS/PVA adsorbent structure improves its adsorption performance. In the initial stages, the chrome adsorption rate was very fast. In this study, the highest adsorption occurred at pH = 2. The value of pHPZC for this adsorbent was 4.9, as well. The negative charge of the adsorbent surface at the pH values higher than pHPZC confirms that the lower pH is favorable for adsorption. In addition, an increase in solution concentration from 60 ppm to 110 ppm caused an increase in adsorption capacity. Adsorption rate also gradually decreased over time and became constant after equilibrium time (225 min). The removal percentage increases with the adsorbent dosage. It can be related to an increase in surface area of adsorbent resulting from the increase in the number of active sites in comparison with the number of chrome ions. Kinetic and isotherm studies also conducted. According to the results, Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic had good compatibility with experimental data. The maximum amount of chrome adsorbed was 109.89 (mg/g) based on Langmuir isotherm. Thermodynamic studies reveal that the adsorption process is exothermic and spontaneous as well. According to the results, this adsorbent is effective for hexavalent chrome removal from aqueous solution."
