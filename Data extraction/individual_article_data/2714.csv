0,Introduction,"FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) is a term describing a sum of adverse effects provoked by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) (Chudley and Longstaffe, 2005). First described in 1968 by Lemoine (Lemoine et al., 1968), this disease includes developmental, neurological and behavioral deficits. Chronic high doses of alcohol can lead to the development of the most severe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) (Coriale et al., 2013). The diagnostic criteria of FAS are based on four components (Tarani et al., 2018): 1) specific facial dysmorphic traits, 2) prenatal and/or postnatal growth deficit, 3) central nervous system or behavioral deficits, 4) confirmed ethanol exposure in utero (Jones et al., 1973; Stratton et al., 1996). Prenatal exposure to mild levels of alcohol can lead to the development of partial FASD phenotypes that include a range of cognitive and behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity, deficits in attention and perception, problems in executive functions, impulsivity (Astley et al., 2009; Streissguth et al., 1986). Children with FASD show cognitive and neuropsychological primary disabilities leading to secondary behavioral disabilities like the susceptibility to develop anxiety and depression disorders (Famy et al., 1998; O’Connor et al., 2002; Streissguth et al., 2004). Maternal alcohol exposure gives rise to remarkable modifications in epigenetic pathways during fetal development involving genomic DNA methylation, histone modifications, transposons and miRNA profile alterations. Other possible additional stressors such as childhood abuse, malnutrition, and poor maternal care may enhance in adulthood the predisposition to mood disorders such as anxiety, and depression. Moreover, epigenetic modifications of regulatory genes (Ciafre’ et al., 2019), such as the proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene, expressed in the germline cells, can be inherited in future generations. The current challenge in FASD research is to characterize molecular and cellular mechanisms that are involved in FASD development and the specific time course of their manifestation during fetal growth."
1,Ethanol metabolism,"Ethanol is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to acetaldehyde; this last is then converted to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (Cederbaum, 2012; Cederbaum et al., 2009). Acetaldehyde oxidation is mainly performed by the mitochondrial form of ADH (ADH2). Ethanol oxidation is driven by the irreversible conversion to acetate (Bosron and Li, 1987) that lowers the level of acetaldehyde, highly toxic for cells. Acetaldehyde can also be formed by peroxisomes catalase and by the enzyme CYP2E1 in microsomes. The low levels of ADH located in the fetal liver are not enough to metabolize ethanol and also CYP2E1 shows much slower rates of ethanol oxidation. It is believed that ethanol toxicity relies on the production of oxygen free radicals as byproducts of such enzymatic reactions. ALDH is produced by the fetal liver only in the late gestation meaning that until this period acetaldehyde is not metabolized, causing the production of free radicals that alter cell metabolism. Acetaldehyde is an unstable chemical and rapidly forms free radicals that are highly toxic if not extinguished by antioxidants (Cederbaum, 2012; Wu and Cederbaum, 2003). Moreover, ethanol, crossing the blood-brain barrier, impairs the development of the fetal brain (Henderson et al., 1999a). The metabolic pathway of ethanol can also be conditioned by the presence of polymorphisms that can alter gene expression or the activity of alcohol metabolizing enzymes (Ferraguti et al., 2015; Ceccanti et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2001)."
2,Biomarkers of alcohol exposure,"Detecting children that can potentially develop FASD is a crucial point; this allows early interventions with psychological support and/or pharmacological treatments. For this purpose, it is strategically important to constantly look for new and always more sensible and specific markers of alcohol intake. These are usually ethanol metabolites (direct markers) or markers of cell and tissue damages induced by ethanol (indirect markers). Direct markers are: i) fatty acids ethyl esters (FAEEs) that accumulate in meconium of the newborn from high consumption mother; ii) ethyl sulfate (EtS), a side product of ethanol metabolism in liver whose detection period is 30 h; iii) phosphatidylethanol (PEth), generated by phospholipids in presence of ethanol and detected in blood for three weeks; iv) ethylglucuronide (EtG), produced in the liver and detectable also in urine for two or three days. This last is highly sensitive and its detection in hair is specific of chronic and excessive alcohol use. To establish the real consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, an approach that goes beyond specific screening questionnaires and that relies on a biological assessment of alcohol drinking is requested. Between the possible biomarkers, the amount of EtG in biological matrices, especially in maternal urine (a biological sample that can be obtained in a non-invasive way), is receiving an increasing interest (Ferraguti et al., 2017; Ferraguti et al., 2019; Graham et al., 2017; Ondersma et al., 2016) as it represents a possible first line of intervention. Moreover, investigations are in progress to link changes in neurotrophins levels induced by prenatal alcohol consumption in the meconium, cord blood or mother/infant serum to propose them as additional markers of FASD. Among the indirect biomarkers, the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) concentration in the serum from peripheral blood is a robust marker of chronic alcohol consumption; unfortunately, its use is not suitable in pregnant women because of possible false positives depending on the week of pregnancy. Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase, whose levels rise in the blood after chronic alcohol exposure and mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells that increase with chronic consumption are commonly used in clinical routine even though they are not enough specific/sensitive markers. Recently, Lussier et al., identified a specific DNA methylation signature in children and adolescents affected by FASD. These findings may provide a starting point towards the development of epigenetics biomarkers of FASD."
3,Prenatal alcohol exposure animal models,"Animal models of PAE give access to all tissues, in particular to brain tissues, at precise time points (Patten et al., 2014). PAE animal models allow the use of genetically controlled inbred strains where the role of genetic background can be tested (Nestler and Hyman, 2010) and permit the assessment of well documented behavioral tests to evaluate changes induced by the disease (Fiore et al., 2009a; Chater-diehl, 2017; Fiore et al., 2009b; Ceccanti et al., 2012). The most used model organisms in FASD research are rodents, mostly rats and mice due to the easiness of genetic manipulation and the care of their health and the analogy to human physiology and development (Patten et al., 2014; Ceccanti et al., 2016). The C57BL/6 J laboratory mice strain was largely used in ethanol research due to their voluntary consumption of ethanol solutions that is higher than in all other strains (Rodgers, 1966) and for the high amount of fetal malformations shown in response to PAE (Boehm et al., 1997). Central nervous system (CNS) development starts at gestational day 7 in mice (GD7) corresponding to the first trimester in humans (Rice and Barone, 2000). CNS formation begins with neurulation followed by neuron proliferation, migration and differentiation during the second trimester (Rice and Barone, 2000). In the third trimester, neurons are subjected to maturation and synaptogenesis. Ethanol exposition perturbs each of these processes, with molecular and behavioral consequences that differ in function of dosage, time point and type of exposition (acute or chronic) (Patten et al., 2014; Kleiber et al., 2014a; Mantha et al., 2013; Miller and Spear, 2006; Wozniak et al., 2004). Rodent models of ethanol exposure are studied in early or late gestation and in the first post-natal period that corresponds to the third trimester in humans. Ethanol dosage can vary from moderate over a longer time to high doses in a short period to mimic binge-drinking behavior. The vehicle of exposure was usually gavage, but also injection consumption and inhalation are used (Kelly et al., 2009). Post-natal day (PND) 7 in mice is the peak of a period named “the brain growth spurt” in which rapid growth and maturation of synaptic connections of the brain have been observed (Rice and Barone, 2000). In rats and mice, this period spans the first two postnatal weeks, whereas in human is collocated near to birth (Rice and Barone, 2000; Dobbing and Sands, 1979). Ethanol exposition at high doses on PND 7, considered the model of binge drinking behavior for humans, provokes general neurodegeneration in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus with spatial memory and learning deficits (Goodlett CR1, 1997; Zimmerberg et al., 1991). Exposition to ethanol of mice or rats during the first postnatal week provokes a marked alteration in synaptogenesis. In this period many synaptic connections are formed and successively reinforced or removed in a process named “synaptic pruning” (D’Amelio et al., 2012) in which redundant neurons are eliminated by apoptosis; this process is controlled both by NMDA receptors activation that allows neuron survival and by GABA A receptors that promote apoptosis (Olney et al., 2002). The general neuronal apoptosis induced by ethanol during the period of synaptogenesis is due to the role of ethanol as both an NMDA antagonist and GABA A agonist and is particularly relevant in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum (Wozniak et al., 2004; D’Amelio et al., 2012; Olney et al., 2002; Ikonomidou et al., 2000)."
4,Prenatal alcohol exposure and neurodegeneration,"4.1 Prenatal alcohol exposure and neurodegeneration The neuronal loss in these crucial brain regions is associated with the behavioral phenotypes observed in FASD. Ethanol-induced neurodegeneration is also driven by the brain immune response controlled by microglia, the macrophage cells that, after the transition to an activated state, eliminate the damaged neurons by phagocytosis. Proinflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS), that trigger neuronal death during brain development, are produced during microglia activation. Moreover, ethanol activates microglia and produces ROS from its metabolism exacerbating neuronal death during the first postnatal week in mice. Furthermore, it triggers a concomitant loss of microglia that reduces its immunological function in later life (Thameem Dheen et al., 2007; Brocardo et al., 2011). Hippocampus is extremely vulnerable to the effect of ethanol during synaptogenesis; in mice exposed to ethanol during PND 7, a reduced number of neurons (Gil-Mohapel et al., 2010) and a deficit in neurogenesis, synaptic strength and dendritic spine density in adult age are observed (Bellinger et al., 1999; Abel, 1993). These alterations are associated with an impairment of memory and learning. These phenotypes resemble those described in mice with hippocampal lesions or in children with FAS (Mantha et al., 2013; Cho et al., 1999). Ethanol-induced modifications in the brain involve changes in gene expression. The genes Casp3 and Bax that control apoptosis are both upregulated by ethanol (Nowoslawski et al., 2005). The blockade of the upregulation of these genes reverts ethanol-induced neurotoxicity and behavioral dysfunctions (Sadrian et al., 2012). Ethanol also upregulates transcription of genes controlling inflammation and downregulates genes involved in immune response (Drew et al., 2015; Lussier et al., 2015). A recent work by Chater-Diehl on PAE, focused on the modifications of H3K4me and H3K27me3 across promoters in the PND 7 mouse hippocampus using a model of ethanol exposition on PND 4 and 7 introduced by the Singh laboratory. In this model, pups were exposed to ethanol on PND 4 and 7 in order to affect both the starting and the peak of synaptogenesis. This type of exposition produced a relevant FASD phenotype marked by a delay in development, hyperactivity and deficits in learning and memory. Exposed mice displayed a reduced time in exploring an open field linked to anxiety-related behavior (Mantha et al., 2013; Carola et al., 2002; Laufer et al., 2013). They also showed an increased home cage activity that correlated to hyperactivity (Mantha et al., 2013); most of all, they displayed strong deficits on the Barnes maze memory test (Barnes, 1979). This model, being an effective example of FASD impairment in learning and memory, provides a system to study molecular mechanisms that drive these aberrations. Other findings showed that chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol resulted in a significant decline in the ontogenetic upregulation of choline acetyltransferase activity in the rat septal area during the second postnatal week, but was followed by recovery to control levels by adulthood (Swanson et al., 1995) whereas major changes were found with chronic or binge drinking during adulthood (De Simone and Aloe, 1993)."
5,Prenatal alcohol exposure and reactive oxygen species,"4.2 Prenatal alcohol exposure and reactive oxygen species Prenatal alcohol exposure increases oxidative stress in developing organs including the brain (Chu et al., 2007; Dembele et al., 2006; Heaton et al., 2002; Heaton et al., 2003; Petkov et al., 1992; Ramachandran et al., 2001; Reyes et al., 1993; Smith et al., 2005). In rodent models of FASD, even a brief exposition to ethanol during gestation causes an imbalance in brain cellular redox state (Dong et al., 2010), correlated with deficits in the behavior (Vink et al., 2005). These alterations are reverted by antioxidants administration (Busby et al., 2002; Neese et al., 2004; Reid et al., 1999). Elevated levels of ROS derive from the abundance of unsaturated fatty acids that are substrates for ROS in brain tissue (Halliwell, 1992; Porter, 1984), from the high content in some brain region of iron (itself promoting ROS) and from the spontaneous reaction with the oxygen of several neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. The reaction with oxygen generates superoxide anion (O2 −) and depletes the levels of endogenous antioxidants (Spencer et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the antioxidant defense system of the brain is limited if compared to other organs such as liver and kidney, where the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) are higher (Floyd and Carney, 1992). We must also consider that in fetal cells the levels of antioxidants, enzymatic and non-enzymatic, are lower in comparison to the adults, so fetal cells are more sensitive to neurotoxic effects of oxidative stress (Bergamini et al., 2005; Henderson et al., 1999b). Oxidative stress derives from the imbalance between ROS production and antioxidant defense that damage macromolecules and phospholipids that constitute cellular membrane (Dean et al., 1997), impairing cellular integrity and inducing genetic alterations that culminate in apoptosis and neurodegeneration (Brocardo et al., 2011). 4.2.1 Origin of reactive oxygen species Intracellular ROS are generated by mitochondria as a by-product of the oxidative phosphorylation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1995) and in the cytoplasm by the xanthine oxidase and the reduced nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) pathway (Gao et al., 2003; Infanger et al., 2006; Miller, 2006). Oxidative stress can also derive from environmental factors such as radiations, pollution, drugs of abuse and ethanol (Zadák et al., 2009). Organisms have developed endogenous antioxidant systems to prevent cellular damage induced by ROS (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1995). Endogenous antioxidants are divided into two groups: nonenzymatic, that include thiols and GSH (Halliwell, 2006) and enzymatic, like i) SODs which inactivate O2 −, that exists in the copper/zinc-containing cytosolic form or in the mitochondrial manganese-containing form (Fridovich, 1997), ii) the iron-containing catalase, that reduces the toxic hydrogen peroxide to water (Percy, 1984) and iii) the Gpx system, that reduces organic peroxides using GSH which is oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). In this pathway, GSH is regenerated by the enzyme glutathione reductase that consumes NADPH (Halliwell, 2006). Alcohol toxicity depends on ROS production during ethanol metabolism which occurs in two steps: the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or the cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), or, in a much lesser extent, the enzyme catalase that converts ethanol into acetaldehyde, than oxidized to acetate by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Ethanol oxidation by CYP2E1 generates ROS that are also increased in mitochondria where NADH is re-oxidized to NAD + . Since ethanol metabolism occurs mostly in the liver, ethanol-induced imbalance of redox state in the CNS probably derives from the dysregulation of mitochondrial energetics. Data from in vitro models have shown that chronic ethanol exposure causes mitochondrial malfunctions and oxidative stress in both astrocytes and immature neurons (Chu et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2007). 4.2.2 Reactive oxygen species and neurodegeneration Studies in vivo by Xu et al. observed, in cerebral tissues of mouse fetuses exposed to ethanol during GD 6–15, a reduction of mitochondrial volume, proliferation and differentiation and a decrease of the enzymatic activity of the respiratory chain and of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, leading to a reduction of cerebral ATP (Xu et al., 2005). The ethanol-induced cell redox imbalance during brain development causes oxidative damage of lipids, proteins and DNA that can contribute to neurodegeneration observed in FASD causing long-lasting effects that weaken the antioxidant defense systems later in life (Brocardo et al., 2011). Serotonergic neurons are particularly sensitive to ethanol-induced apoptosis (Koop, 2006); this last has been linked to a decrease in brain volume and to abnormal cortical structure and is correlated to cognitive and behavioral deficits (Guerri et al., 2009). Elevated ROS levels are extremely dangerous for the developing brain since the brain has the highest metabolic rate of all body tissue. Fatty acids and neurotransmitters, that are auto-oxidable, react with ROS generating superoxide anion, quinones and semiquinones that are highly reactive radicals; moreover, the lower level in the brain of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT and Gpx) and the lower amount in fetal cells of ethanol degrading enzymes represent a further vulnerability. FASD phenotypes show specific and distinctive features that should be correlated to the effect of ethanol oxidative stress in order to understand their etiology. Ethanol exposure changes gene expression producing long term modifications in epigenetics marks on imprinted genes that can be transmitted over generations (Sarkar, 2016). The vulnerability to ethanol and the development of FASD depend on genetic and epigenetics disposition; for example, some variants of ALDH and CYP2E1 seem to predispose to disease development (Ramsay, 2010). 4.2.3 Prenatal alcohol exposure, epigenetics and reactive oxygen species Epigenetics is the generation of heritable changes in chromosome conformation without changing DNA sequence (Berger et al., 2009). Many chemical modifications in chromatin structure can condense or relax its structure with repression or activation of gene expression. Among them, DNA methylation of cytosine residues and histone covalent modifications are the most studied. These modifications are conserved through cell division providing a long-term regulation of genetic expression. A complex coordination between histone modification and DNA methylation controls transcriptional response (Cedar and Bergman, 2009; Schultz et al., 2002). Epigenetics marks are reversible and can modify in response to environmental stimuli (Rosenfeld, 2010). Ethanol can change genetic expression through histone modifications and DNA methylation (Kleiber et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2009; Shukla et al., 2008; Chater-Diehl et al., 2017). Garro et al., for the first time observed that fetus exposition to ethanol inhibited DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) activity (Garro et al., 1991). Furthermore, acetaldehyde inhibits methionine synthase (that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine) (Halsted et al., 2002) reducing the level of s-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the primary source of methyl groups (Fig. 1 ). Ethanol originates oxidative stress-producing ROS through CYP2E1 and also by increasing NADH levels; additional ROS derive from ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage (Hoek JB, Pastorino JG, 2002). Under oxidative conditions, homocysteine is converted to glutathione, reducing SAM and methylation (Kerksick and Willoughby, 2005). Acetylation pathway is also impacted by ethanol metabolism that produces acetate and consequently acetyl-CoA that, being the principal acetyl group donor for HATs (Chater-Diehl et al., 2017), drives histone acetylation. Ethanol metabolism depletes NAD + and reduces the activity of sirtuins that are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. In 2007 the study of Pal-Bhadra et al., demonstrated that, in cultured hepatocytes, site-specific histone modifications H3K9me2 and H3K4me2 were associated with gene expression changes (Pal-Bhadra et al., 2007). In upregulated genes, it was observed an increase in H3K4me2 and a reduction of H3K9me2 in downregulated genes. Two studies by Subbanna et al., in C57BL/6 J mice, exposed to ethanol at PND 7 showed, in the hippocampus and neocortex, an increase in the transcription of the histone methyltransferase G9a. This protein, involved in synaptic remodeling, catalyzes the mono- and di-methylated status of histone H3 at lysine residue 9 (K9) and 27 (K27) (Subbanna et al., 2013; Subbanna et al., 2014; Schaefer et al., 2009; Tachibana et al., 2002). Ethanol exposure at PND 7 is linked to neurodegeneration and is reverted by a pre-treatment with the G9a inhibitor Bix, before ethanol exposure (Subbanna et al., 2013; Subbanna et al., 2014). During development H3K9 and H3K27 methylations are stable and heritable and can be considered strong and true epigenetics marks of repressed and/or closed chromatin structure and very strong candidates for the long-lasting effects of ethanol exposure (Chater-Diehl et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2013). 4.2.4 PAE and antioxidant supplementation In human embryos and fetuses (Cederbaum, 2012; Goodlett and Horn, 2001), ADH enzymes are not yet fully expressed (indeed, the production of ADH begins only after birth). As a result, the fetal liver cannot metabolize alcohol or other xenobiotics. In various human fetal tissues, CYP2E1 expression and activity are found after the beginning of organogenesis (at about 50 days of gestation). Exposure to alcohol elicits the induction of CYP2E1 in fetal and adult tissues contributing significantly to the oxidative system of microsomal ethanol and its activity in fetal tissues participates significantly to the toxicity of maternal intake of ethanol. These free radicals can harm embryonic neural crest cells and may lead to severe birth defects, mental retardation and physical anomalies in newborns (Chen and Sulik, 2000; De Nicolò et al., 2014). Guidelines to reduce oxidative stress might be of great use in managing the damage induced by gestational alcohol drinking. In this context, the consumption of polyphenols, natural compounds known to possess antioxidant properties, as diet supplements, could be of great concern in the prevention/reduction of free radicals-induced cell damage (Carito et al., 2015a; Carito et al., 2014). Several studies discussed the relationship between oxidative stress and polyphenols supplementation (Carito et al., 2016). Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid phenol, naturally produced by grapes, shows antioxidant properties, but also anti-inflammatory, and vessel/endothelium protective abilities (Petrella et al., 2020; Castaldo et al., 2019). Olive oil polyphenols (De Nicoló et al., 2013; Carito et al., 2015b) have also strong antioxidant properties and neuroprotective capabilities (Carito et al., 2016; De Nicoló et al., 2013; Fiore et al., 2003; Bersani et al., 2000; Manni et al., 2009). Indeed, another study carried out in a mouse model of alcohol dependence demonstrated that olive polyphenols supplementation prevented ethanol-related oxidative stress increase (Carito et al., 2017)."
6,Histone methylation,"A work by Chater-Diehl, using a model of ethanol exposition on PND 4,7 introduced by the Singh laboratory, identified regions of differential histone modifications (RDHM) for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, analyzing the genes proximal to these regions. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses were used to identify the functional role of these genes, using three different software platforms to identify pathways: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), Partek Pathway and Enrichr. GO analysis of the H3K4me3 showed synaptic changes, cell adhesion and signal transduction genes disruptions; H3K27me3 methylation affects networks related to endocrine system development and function, protein synthesis and molecular transport. The shared H3K4me3/ H3K27me3 gene sets showed an enrichment in cell-cell adhesion and genes related to synapses and dendrites. These genes codify proteins that organize the synaptic network during development. Taken together, these data suggest that histone specific methylation regulates the expression of cell-cell adhesion genes. The development of synapses is regulated by communications that are realized via cell-cell adhesion molecules, with a prominent role of protocadherin (Pcdh) genes which are crucial in synaptogenesis (Cohen-Cory, 2002). Pcdh genes form clusters of related genes that, through the establishment of connections between neurons, generate neuron diversity during vertebrate brain development (Thu et al., 2014). Pcdh proteins determine if a neuron is self-synapsing or if it is in synapse with other neurons generating the neurites’ diversity necessary to establish in humans the complex network of synapses during the third trimester. Pcdh genes constitute three genomic clusters, Pcdh a, b and g, conserved across species and localized in human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 18. Pcdha and Pcdhg have alternative first exons and produce proteins with a constant cytoplasmic domain and different extracellular domains that generate neuronal individuality. Recent data in humans have shown an association between DNA methylation at Pcdh loci and FASD (Laufer et al., 2015; Portales-Casamar et al., 2016). Pcdh genes can be considered key factors in the etiology of FASD and strong epigenetics biomarkers of this disease. Damage induced by ethanol cause deficits in formation, transmission, potentiation and plasticity of synapses that persists in adulthood (Olney et al., 2002; Mameli et al., 2005; Puglia and Valenzuela, 2010). The H3K4me3 gene set is mainly represented by sequences regulating lipid metabolism pathways. The hub of this network is leptin, the hormone-peptide that is the principal regulator of adipocyte function and hanger. Other important hub genes include the β-oxidation enzyme ACOX1 that catalyzes the first step of β-oxidation. It is well known that FASD phenotypes show an alteration of lipid metabolism and that PAE causes alterations of brain cholesterol levels in adult mice (Barceló-Coblijn et al., 2013), and also dysregulations of the hippocampus phospholipids profile (Wen and Kim, 2004) and brain lipid peroxidation (Petkov et al., 1992; Smith et al., 2005; Brocardo et al., 2017). This study of Chater-Diehl was the first to link histone modifications to lipid metabolism in the hippocampus, the brain region that controls spatial memory and learning."
7,DNA methylation,"Methylation of cytosine residue of DNA in mammalian gene promoters takes place at CpG dinucleotides (Deaton and Bird, 2011) but also at non-CpG moieties and controls gene expression (Medvedeva et al., 2014). The role of non-CpG methylation is not yet clearly recognized (Lucarelli et al., 2019), although some evidence exists of the role of active non-CpG demethylation in the fast dynamics of transcriptional activation in animals (Fuso et al., 2010). Promoter regions containing high concentrations of CpG sites are called CpG islands (Bird, 1986). Methylation of CpG islands can be linked to the repression of both up and downstream genes (Deaton and Bird, 2011). DNA methylation is regulated by the DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT). DNMT3A and B catalyze de novo CpG methylation (Okano et al., 1998), whereas DNMT1 recognizes the hemimethylated palindromic sequence in each daughter cell after cell division and adds methyl groups to the unmethylated strand. In this way, the methylation pattern is conserved through cell division. DNMT3A and B activation during embryonic development regulates methylation patterns which control the acquisition of the final identity of somatic cells through stem cells differentiation (Seisenberger et al., 2012). During gametogenesis, DNA methylation is removed (Messerschmidt et al., 2014) and is erased also after fertilization (Geiman and Muegge, 2010). This demethylation is performed by the DNA demethylases ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins (Kohli and Zhang, 2013). After development, in most somatic tissues, only DNMT1 remains active at low levels and DNA methylation is maintained stable. The repressive effect on transcription is achieved by promoting the binding of negative transcription factors or inhibiting the binding of positive factors. DNA methylation patterns, that are stable in most adult tissues, are instead dynamic in the brain where post-mitotic neurons express de novo DNMTs (Feng et al., 2005a; Goto et al., 1994)."
8,DNA methylation in the brain,"6.1 DNA methylation in the brain Deletion or pharmacological inhibition of these demethylases in the hippocampus perturbs long term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity that control learning and memory. Studies have shown a plasticity of methylation patterns in response to neuronal activation (Lubin et al., 2008; Miller and Sweatt, 2007). TET enzymes have important functions in maintaining the balance of 5mC in the brain and during active demethylation they produce 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hm) as intermediate; this last is prominently present in brain tissues and particularly in synaptic regulatory genes (Ito et al., 2011; Khare et al., 2012). It is not clear whether or not this intermediate represents simply a step towards demethylation or can actively promote transcription (Branco et al., 2012). The brain is also enriched in non-CpG cytosine methylation; both methylated CpGs (mCpGs) and mCpHs (H = A/C/T) can repress transcription in vitro and are recognized by methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in neurons in vivo (Guo et al., 2014). About half of CpG islands localize over transcription start sites (TSSs) (Macleod et al., 1999) and many overlaps with non-coding TSSs RNA (Guttman et al., 2009). Moreover, a correlation between CpG density and H3K4me3 levels was observed (Thompson et al., 2010; Jones, 2012). A whole-genomic 5 hmc analysis found that, during development, TET mediated demethylation localizes at gene enhancers (the same happens in the adult brain) (Lu et al., 2014; Tognini et al., 2015) suggesting that this mechanism regulates gene expression during neuronal stimulation and learning. Aberrations of DNA methylations profiles are implicated in many human diseases and are particularly important in FASD where ethanol impairs methylation depleting the generation of the methyl donor SAM (Hamid and Kaur, 2007)."
9,DNA methylation and fetal alcohol Spectrum disorders,"6.2 DNA methylation and fetal alcohol Spectrum disorders In FASD mouse fetuses exposed to a high dose of ethanol from GD 9–11 it was found a global DNA hypomethylation (Garro et al., 1991). The work of Liu et al., using whole-embryo culture, examined the effect of ethanol exposure on gene expression and DNA methylation during neurulation (Liu et al., 2009). They found 85 genes differentially expressed and methylated, many of which were imprinted genes and olfactory genes. In another study, the promoter of Pomc gene, involved in neuronal regulation of stress response, was found down methylated and downregulated at PND 60 after ethanol exposure at GD 7–21; this modification was transmitted to the F2 and F3 male offspring (Govorko et al., 2012), providing the first example of transgenerational transmission of epigenetics changes. Chater-Diehl in a FASD PND 4,7 model, performed an analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) to identify affected genetic systems. A pool of 689 genes proximal to the 733 DMRs was submitted to GO and IPA. GO and IPA identified pathways related to cell growth, development and death, hematopoietic cell lineage and peroxisome and lysosome pathways. Lysosomes control the elimination of cellular waste and contain hydrolytic enzymes. They play a role in cell repair and signaling and lysosomal autophagy in the developing brain is considered a defense from neurotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by ethanol (Chen et al., 2012). IPA also indicated peroxisomes, which modulate oxidative stress, control the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the synthesis of lipids (Trompier et al., 2014). These organelles control the redox balance of cells generating and removing free radicals. The Pex genes, that codify peroxisomal membrane proteins, control peroxisome production in response to oxidative stress. These genes, which guide matrix proteins inside the structure, regulate the assembling of peroxisomes. Moreover, the upregulation of peroxisomes biogenesis has been recently studied as a therapeutic option for FASD. The differential methylation of T cells genome could represent a response to inflammation which is involved in FASD etiology (Drew et al., 2015). Calmodulin binding is another function highlighted by the GO analysis. Calmodulin controls Ca2+ signaling and regulates the propagation of nerve impulse; probably, it is also involved in ethanol neurotoxicity (Caillard et al., 1999). Furthermore, IPA indicated the network “Embryonic Development, Organism Development, Cellular Development”. Proinsulin, a precursor of the peptide hormone insulin, is a hub protein of this network. Features of FASD are the alteration of insulin signaling and insulin resistance in CNS (Dembele et al., 2006; de la Monte and Wands, 2010). Combined analysis of differentially methylated regions in both DNA and histones identified novel processes not evidenced in the individual analysis; differences in methylation that concern genes that watch over cardiovascular development and function are possibly linked to anomalies in the cardiovascular system that were described in FASD (Burd et al., 2007). Another highlighted pathway is the Notch signaling, that regulates neurogenesis in the adult brain and during development and is involved in learning and memory (Imayoshi and Kageyama, 2011; Costa et al., 2003)."
10,MicroRNA,"6.3 MicroRNA Analysis of gene expression using microarrays evidenced that PAE can induce alterations of gene expression at the whole transcriptome level and can affect both protein-coding and non-protein coding genes producing microRNA (miRNAs). MicroRNAs are short (20–26 bp) non-coding RNA molecules that control target messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, inhibiting their translation or activating their degradation (Bartel, 2004). A longer primary transcript the pri-miRNAs is cleaved by Drosha, an endonuclease that produces a short stem-loop structured molecule, the pre-miRNA (Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2003). Exportin-5 exports this molecule from the nucleus (Bohnsack et al., 2004; Yi et al., 2003) to the cytoplasm where it is processed by the ribonuclease Dicer to form mature miRNA (Bernstein et al., 2001). Dicer produces a double-stranded RNA in which one strand is the guiding strand that corresponds to the mature miRNA, while the other is the passenger strand or miRNA which is usually degraded, but that sometimes can function as a mature miRNA (Bartel, 2004). In the cytoplasm, miRNA becomes part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in association with the Argonaute family of proteins. This complex binds the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) of the target mRNA (Bartel, 2009) inhibiting its translation or provoking its degradation (Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015; Ameres and Zamore, 2013). A single miRNA can target hundreds of mRNA and a single mRNA can be targeted by dozens of miRNAs. It was estimated that about one-third of the human genome is regulated by miRNA (Urbich et al., 2008). They are important regulators of cell differentiation and neurodevelopment. The mammalian brain shows high levels of miRNA expression (Babak et al., 2004). Many neurological diseases such as drug addiction, autism or schizophrenia are associated with miRNAs expression changes (Wang et al., 2012). Changes in miRNAs expression were also observed in FASD, affecting neuronal development and function. The Singh laboratory has studied gene expression changes in several FASD models assessing also miRNA expression modifications; an enrichment in miRNAs involved in the control of imprinted regions, in neuronal function and development was observed (Laufer et al., 2013)."
11,Prenatal alcohol exposure and neurotrophins,"PAE impairs neurotrophins production and signaling pathways (reviewed by (Ciafre’ et al., 2019; Ceci et al., 2020; Carito et al., 2019a). Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that regulate the survival, differentiation and functions of nerve cells and other cells of the endocrine, immune and adipo-cardiovascular systems (Chaldakov et al., 2010; Chaldakov et al., 2000; Chaldakov et al., 2003). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) are highly expressed during the development of the nervous system and in adulthood, in response to neuronal stimulation and synapse formations and during learning and memory consolidation (Manni et al., 2009; Fiore et al., 2009c; Sornelli et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2005; Park and Poo, 2013)."
12,Prenatal alcohol exposure and brain-derived neurotrophic factor,"7.1 Prenatal alcohol exposure and brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF gene structure is complex: a common 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) and multiple 5′ non-coding exons, each containing its own promoter that controls the expression, generates a precursor proBDNF that shows a conserved structure in different species (Aid et al., 2007; Pruunsild et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2009; Ambigapathy et al., 2013). 3′UTR contains alternative polyadenylation sites giving rise to short and long UTRs. The length of 3′ UTR regulates intracellular localization of this mRNA and its activity-dependent translation (An et al., 2008; Exposure, 2009; Lau et al., 2010). Intracellular processing produces proBDNF protein (25−35 kDa) that migrates outside the cell where it works as a ligand or is alternatively cleaved by Plasmin or by matrix metalloproteinases. Cleavage forms the mature protein (14 kDa). Early development of adverse stimuli or psychosocial stress markedly affects the levels of NGF and BDNF in adulthood either in plasma or in specific brain areas such as the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. During mouse forebrain development, differential expression of BDNF is controlled by epigenetics mechanisms that rely on differential methylation patterns of CpG islands in exon IV of the BDNF promoter. Tsankova et al. studied chromatin remodeling of five BDNF splice variant mRNAs (I–V) and their unique promoters in the hippocampus, in a model of chronic social defeat stress in mice. Epigenetics modifications caused by defeat stress may induce a long-lasting downregulation of BDNF transcripts III and IV and an increase in repressive H3K27 histone methylation at their corresponding promoters (Tsankova et al., 2006). Methylation within exon IV of Bdnf promoter of the c-AMP response element site interferes with the binding of the c-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor (Roth et al., 2009 (Roth and Sweatt, 2009)). Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that inhibits histone deacetylases, can revert the reduction of gene transcription (Tsankova et al., 2006). One gene can be regulated by multiple and interconnected epigenetics mechanisms. Neuronal development is ensured by factors that control apoptosis or cellular survival. The Pl3K-Akt signaling of the BDNF pathway plays a key role because it can induce both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival genes (Brunet et al., 2001). BDNF, through the activation of its receptor TrkB, can trigger a variety of downstream cascades that regulate the transcription of survival factors such as Nf-kB and CREB (Romashkova and Makarov, 1999). Without BDNF, the pre-apoptotic genes of the Bcl2 family are upregulated promoting apoptosis (Brunet et al., 2001). Modarresi et al. reported an example of epigenetics regulation of the BDNF cascade describing a natural antisense transcript that represses the expression of this gene (Modarresi et al., 2012). The repressive chromatin remodeling factor mSin3A is another epigenetics regulation of this gene, following activity-induced changes in promoter methylation of the BDNF gene (Martinowich et al., 2003). A similar kind of regulation, methylation-dependent, was also observed in Akt1 gene, which, during ESC differentiation, is upregulated and acquires intragenic 5 hmC (Kim et al., 2014)."
13,Prenatal alcohol exposure and nerve growth factor,"7.2 Prenatal alcohol exposure and nerve growth factor An increasing body of evidence shows, in mice models, that PAE affects the synthesis and release of NGF and BDNF (Fiore et al., 2009b; Ceccanti et al., 2012; Carito et al., 2019a; Ceccanti et al., 2013; Mooney and Miller, 2007; Aloe, 2006; Feng et al., 2005b; Moore et al., 2004). A reduced ethanol metabolism by women is the base of the teratogenic effect on the fetus. The higher sensitivity of women to ethanol is probably due to a reduced body water content, to a different enzymatic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and sex hormones (Mancinelli et al., 2013; Ely et al., 1999). Moreover, polymorphisms of genes coding alcohol metabolizing enzymes can contribute to individual differences in alcohol pharmacokinetics (Ferraguti et al., 2015). The dysregulation of the biochemistry of growth factors caused by ethanol is linked to the abnormal development of the central and peripheral nervous systems (Fiore et al., 2009b; Aloe and Tirassa, 1992; Zucca and Valenzuela, 2010). Alcohol exposure modifies the levels of expression of NGF and BDNF in several brain regions such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus that control neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity (Caldwell et al., 2008; Aloe et al., 1993; Tapia-Arancibia et al., 2001). A longitudinal analysis that used a mouse model of prenatal ethanol exposure, investigated the short and long-term consequences in the offspring during a time-lapse ranging from adolescence to aging (Fiore et al., 2009b; Ceccanti et al., 2012). Data showed profound alterations of the NGF and BDNF levels in offspring hippocampus and other brain areas linked to cognitive, emotional and behavioral deficits, with the maximum negative response in adult mice (90 days). Data from rodent models have also shown that paternal alcohol exposure prior to mating can induce abnormalities in organ and brain growth (Abel, 1993; Tanaka et al., 1982), reduction of testosterone levels (Abel, 1989), and thickening of cortical layers (Jamerson et al., 2004) coupled to behavioral abnormalities (Wozniak et al., 1991). In this context, our research group found alterations of NGF and BDNF expression in the brain and an increased ethanol-elicited preference in the offspring of paternal alcohol-exposed mice (Ceccanti et al., 2016). Another study investigating PAE impact on stress responsivity in the offspring have demonstrated a stress hypo-responsivity in male offspring at both behavioral and endocrine level (Rompala et al., 2016). Liang et al. hypothesized that paternal chronic ethanol exposure dysregulates the methylation of imprinted genes in sire spermatozoa that can be inherited by the offspring giving rise to developmental disorders (Liang et al., 2015). Further investigations are in progress to link the variations of neurotrophins levels induced by PAE to the fluctuations of these proteins measured in the meconium, cord blood or mother/infant serum, in order to propose them as additional markers of FASD (Carito et al., 2019b)."
14,Prenatal alcohol exposure and the hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis epigenetics,
15,Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis,"8.1 Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis controls stress response and regulates many homeostatic systems of the body that include immune, metabolic, reproductive, cardiovascular and central nervous systems (Nestler et al., 2009). Its role is to integrate physical and psychological signals to better adapt an organism to its environment (Del Rey et al., 2008). A large number of studies are focused on HPA axis alterations due to its key role in the physiological response to stressful stimuli. A stressful stimulus such as PAE activates the amygdala and stimulates the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to release corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). CRH and AVP bind to their receptors CRH receptor1 (CRHR1) and Vasopressin 1b receptor (V1b) and stimulate the release of adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation. Circulating ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids (GCs). Hippocampal glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralcorticoid receptors (MR) detect the concentration of circulating GCs, triggering a negative feedback cascade that represses the release of CRH, AVP and ACTH. Increased methylation of the nr3c1 gene coding for GR, causes a decrease in the expression of this protein, impairing negative feedback signaling in the hippocampus and peripheral immune cells and upregulating the HPA axis. At the intracellular level, the HPA axis activity is regulated by the chaperone protein FKBP5, which controls GR-GC binding and the successive translocation of the activated complex into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for many downstream genes (Silberman et al., 2016)."
16,Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis and prenatal alcohol exposure,"8.2 Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis and prenatal alcohol exposure The HPA axis has been shown to be sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure (Bekdash et al., 2014). PAE increases HPA axis tone with a permanent dysregulation that looks like that observed in anxiety/depression disorders (Weinberg et al., 2008). PAE causes a variety of long-term adverse effects on the HPA axis function (Hellemans et al., 2008; Rachdaoui and Sarkar, 2013) in many physiological systems that can be observed in the adult stage (Rachdaoui and Sarkar, 2013). In the CNS, a predisposition to anxiety-like behaviors (Hellemans et al., 2008), a hyper-response to stress, an unbalancing in the release of neurotransmitters (serotonin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide and catecholamine) (Lee et al., 2008) and a sex-specific malfunction of the serotonergic system was observed (Hoffman et al., 2007). Deficits in cytokines release in humoral or cell-mediated immunity (Johnson et al., 1981) and a reduced innate immune function with a higher vulnerability to cancer were also observed (Polanco et al., 2010; Murugan et al., 2013). Metabolic system modifications involve insulin resistance in the glucose tolerance test (Harper et al., 2014), alterations of signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons (Agapito et al., 2014), mild type 2 diabetes mellitus (Knee et al., 2004) and an increase in metabolic syndrome effects (Xia et al., 2014). HPA axis dysfunction causes also cardiovascular problems (Parkington et al., 2010) (Fig. 2 ). In the neuroendocrine system, HPA axis response to stress is upregulated (Govorko et al., 2012; Haley et al., 2006; Hellemans et al., 2009) and its feedback inhibition by GCs or β-endorphin is compromised at the level of PVN (Hellemans et al., 2009; Boyadjieva et al., 2009). The long term alteration of the HPA axis function correlates to behavioral deficits, hyper-response to stress and dysfunctions of immune and metabolic systems in adulthood (Bekdash et al., 2014). The ""over-exposure” of fetuses to maternal GCs, increased by ethanol consumption, maybe the starting factor by which the fetal HPA axis programming is altered. Furthermore, GCs directly induce neuronal oxidative stress enhancing mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (Exposure, 2009)."
17,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis, Prenatal alcohol exposure and epigenetics","8.3 Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis, Prenatal alcohol exposure and epigenetics Studies of the epigenetics effect of early stressors in animals are mainly focused on brain tissue; in humans, only mixed tissues are accessible to the molecular investigation such as peripheral blood and buccal cells with a few studies on post-mortem brain tissues (Klengel and Binder, 2015). Recently epigenetics marks at a genome-wide level have been analyzed (Klengel et al., 2014). Stress-induced epigenetics modifications were examined in genes that regulate the HPA axis and genes that control monoaminergic or neurotrophic signaling because of their important role in stress-related diseases. In long term epigenetics modification an important role of the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), that controls transcription after neuronal activation, was observed. This protein is abundantly expressed in mature brain and specifically in the hypothalamus where it works both as a transcriptional repressor, binding to methylated DNA, or as a transcriptional activator, interacting with other proteins such as CREB (Chahrour et al., 2008). Murgatroyd et al., working in a murine model of stress due to maternal separation, showed that MeCP2 phosphorylation causes dissociation of this protein from the promoter region of the murine arginine vasopressin gene in the PVN. MeCP2 binding site is thus demethylated and the binding between the repressor complex formed by polycomb complexes and TET protein is reduced, leading to transcription of the gene (Murgatroyd et al., 2009). MeCP2 involvement in stress response was studied in MeCP2 knockout mice (Nuber et al., 2005). MeCP2 knockout mice show behavioral phenotypes of aggressivity, anxiety, hyperphagia and abnormal stress response, the same observed in fetal alcohol-exposed rodents and in humans (Hellemans et al., 2009; Kelley and Dantzer, 2011). These mice show elevated expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, such as fkbp5 and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (sgk1), without an increase in glucocorticoid plasma levels, suggesting a modulation of glucocorticoids in neuronal cells. The wide range of interactions of this protein with chromatin-modifying enzymes directly regulates transcription in specific loci (Bellini et al., 2014)."
18,The pro-opiomelanocortin system,"8.4 The pro-opiomelanocortin system The pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) system, one of the most important regulators of the HPA axis function, consists of hypothalamic POMC neurons expressing the homonymous gene. This gene codifies melanocortin-related peptides ACTH/α-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), β-MSH and γ-MSH, the opioid peptide β-endorphin (BEP) and lipotropins (LPHs). The POMC system is highly conserved in mammalian species and humans. Three different promoters control specific transcription in different tissues. These promoters contain CpG islands that are methylated in non-expressing tissues. The Pomc gene is mainly expressed in the brain by neurons localized in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the anterior and neuro intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. In the periphery, the gene is expressed in the semen, testes, ovaries, placenta, thymus and peripheral mononuclear cells. The 241 amino acids POMC peptide cleavage produces active neuropeptide hormones with a process that involves post-translational and tissue-specific modifications. In the hypothalamus, POMC processing gives rise to β-endorphin, γ-lipotropin and α-MSH. The transcription of Pomc gene is stimulated by CHR whereas β-endorphin inhibits CRH production as negative feedback (Bekdash et al., 2014). POMC derived neuropeptides play important roles in the immune system, energy homeostasis, reproduction, metabolism and brain reward system (Boyadjieva et al., 2009; Luger et al., 2003)."
19,The pro-opiomelanocortin system and prenatal alcohol exposure,"8.5 The pro-opiomelanocortin system and prenatal alcohol exposure POMC system is particularly sensitive to neurotoxic ethanol exposure during development (7) and regulates many physiological processes, stress axis responses, immune system modulation and feeding circuitry (Parker and Bloom, 2012) In PAE there is a depletion of hypothalamic Pomc, a decrease in β-endorphin and a decrease in the number of β-endorphin producing neurons (Boyadjieva et al., 2009; Del Arbol et al., 2007). in vitro observations have shown an apoptotic effect of ethanol on BEP neurons, causing downregulation of cAMP and transforming growth factor β1 related pathways, whereas the activity of caspase 3 increases (Chen et al., 2006). A significant postnatal reduction of Pomc expression was observed also in the arcuate nucleus in a PAE rat model comparable to the exposure to ethanol in the third trimester of pregnancy in humans (Sarkar et al., 2007). Some of the POMC neurons that survive the alcohol-induced apoptosis manifest an alteration of Pomc gene in the adult stage. Presumably, this sort of imprinting, caused by exposition to ethanol during development, is mediated by epigenetics mechanisms. Gangisetti et al., demonstrated in a FASD rat model an hypermethylation of the Pomc gene promoter in POMC hypothalamic neurons that causes gene silencing and increasing levels of MeCP2 protein (Gangisetty et al., 2014). PAE increases also MeCP2 binding to Pomc gene promoter. They observed also a dysfunction in DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) levels (Govorko et al., 2012; Bekdash et al., 2013). Moreover, MeCP2 contains a methyl CpG binding domain (MBD) that recognizes and binds methylated regions of promoters and, recruiting additional repressors such as HDAC, silences gene expression maintaining a repressive chromatin structure (Meehan et al., 1992; Nan et al., 1998). This silencing of Pomc expression can be reverted by intraventricular lentiviral delivery of MeCP2 shRNA. MeCP2 silencing normalizes the hyper-responsivity of the HPA axis and lowers the hypothalamic levels of CRH, the plasmatic ACTH and corticosterone that increase in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (Gangisetty et al., 2014), demonstrating the important regulatory role of MeCP2. PAE-induced CpG methylation of Pomc promoter was observed in two sites: one (hyper-methylated) at 62 bp upstream of TSS containing a CCAAT box that is a binding site for transcription factors and the other at 216 bp upstream of TSS containing an 11 bp long sequence highly conserved in vertebrates that regulates Pomc expression in target tissues (Govorko et al., 2012; Bumaschny et al., 2007). Epigenetics modifications driven by PAE include the decrease in histone activation marks such as trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4 me 2, 3), acetylated H3K9 (Ace H3K9) and phosphorylated H3S10 (ph3S10), and an increase in the histone repressive marks such as dimethylated H3K9 (H3K9 me2) in POMC neurons that express β-endorphin. Changes in the expression level of histone-modifying enzymes such as Set 7/9, G9a/Set and CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Govorko et al., 2012; Bekdash et al., 2013) were contextually observed. These changes in histone marks are tissue-specific and probably affected by time, amount and duration of alcohol exposure."
20,"The pro-opiomelanocortin system, prenatal alcohol exposure and epigenetics","8.6 The pro-opiomelanocortin system, prenatal alcohol exposure and epigenetics The epigenetics reprogramming induced by ethanol in Pomc gene can be reverted by the injection of the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), which induces a chromatin-closed conformation or by injection of 5′ Azacytidine (5′-Aza) that inhibits hyper-methylation of Pomc promoter operated by DNMTs. This treatment, if carried out during the neonatal period, normalizes the Pomc gene expression, β-endorphin production and ACTH/corticosterone response to immune stimulation mediated by LPS (Govorko et al., 2012). These data suggest a potential therapeutic application that targets the epigenetics machinery. Changes in the POMC system epigenetics changes can affect subsequent generations in a gender-dependent manner. Bekdash et al., have studied Pomc expression deficits induced by PAE in F1-F3 male and female offspring. They produced two different germlines: 1) the male germline in which only males were exposed in fetus to ethanol and were crossed with normal females, and 2) the female germline where only females were fetal alcohol-exposed and were crossed with normal males. The increase in Pomc methylation and the concomitant reduction in gene expression observed were limited to F1, F2 and F3 male progeny of male germline; no changes were observed in female F2 and F3. Moreover, this study reported an increase in ACTH and corticosterone levels both in the basal and immune stimulated conditions in males and females offspring of F1 progeny and only in males F2 and F3. The examination of POMC promoter methylation in the sperms of F1-F3 male rats showed a persistence of the methylation pattern in F1-F3 only in males derived from male germline. It was also demonstrated that the hypothalamus β-endorphin expression is partially controlled by the non-pairing region of the Y chromosome (YNPAR) that contain the sex-determining region gene (Botbol et al., 2011). This suggests that the transgenerational epigenetics pattern observed in PAE could depend on epigenetics changes in YNPAR (Bekdash et al., 2014)."
21,Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis and glucocorticoid receptors,"8.7 Hypothalamic-pituitary-Adrenal Axis and glucocorticoid receptors HPA axis response to stress depends on the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GR) expression that can be regulated by DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation across its promoter region and associated histone post-translational modification in the hippocampus. Glucocorticoids binding at their receptor in the hippocampus controls HPA activity exerting a feedback effect that targets corticotrophin-releasing factor synthesis and release in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. GR structure and function and the epigenetics mechanisms that control its response to environmental stress represent a model to better understand the complex interaction between environment, genotype, neuronal plasticity and long-term effects on psychiatric vulnerability. PAE involves an overexposure of the fetus to elevated levels of maternal glucocorticoids (Yu et al., 2020). This excessive exposition is the starting factor that impairs the fetal HPA axis programming. GC signaling controls learning and attention acting via GR. GC signaling regulates also the adaptive responses in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the connection between mPFC and hippocampus and amygdala. Many effects of glucocorticoids depend on the GR control of gene transcription. GR, in the unbound state, localize in the cell cytosol and upon ligand binding translocates to the nucleus. Many proteins regulate the trafficking of GR between cellular compartments such as FK506-binding proteins 51(FKBP51; FKBP5) and 52 (FKBP52; FKBP4), heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), cyclophilin40, dynein and dynamitin (Allan et al., 2014). Allan et al. have shown that PAE mice expressed a significantly reduced response flexibility in a Y-maze reversal-learning task (Allan et al., 2014). They observed, in mPFC, a reduction of the levels of total nuclear GR, a normal levels of GR phosphorylated forms and an alteration of the GR trafficking proteins (FKBP51, Hsp90, cyclophilin 40, dynamitin and dynein intermediate chain) suggesting an alteration of GR trafficking that causes the exclusion of GR from the nucleus. An interactive effect of PAE and chronic unpredictable stress on anxiety-like behavior was observed by Lam et al. in a model of adult male and female offspring from PAE mice; moreover, they observed a different mRNA expression of stress-related receptors that is sex and time-dependent (Lam et al., 2018). Independently from chronic unpredictable stress, PAE induces a GR downregulation in both males and females; this downregulation of GR mRNA is region and sex specific as observed in the male amygdala and in the female mPFC. In the mPFC, GR activation controls glucocorticoid negative feedback suggesting a deficit in this pathway in PAE females, whereas in PAE males this deficit could involve the direct control of the HPA activity (Herman and Tasker, 2016)."
22,"Prenatal alcohol exposure, glucocorticoid receptors and depression","8.8 Prenatal alcohol exposure, glucocorticoid receptors and depression Epidemiological data have linked PAE to an increased risk for depression. It was hypothesized that the development of depression is correlated to a dysregulation of BDNF signaling. In a model of PAE rats, fed with a high-fat diet to increase the HPA axis activity, Yu et al. have studied the correlation between PAE, depression-like behavior, histomorphology of the hippocampus (where is the highest expression of BDNF), expression of GR and of the genes related to the BDNF signaling pathway (Yu et al., 2020). They observed a depression-like behavior more severe in females than males linked to a worse morphology in the CA3 region of the hippocampus with the presence of disordered, loose and thin pyramidal cells. Furthermore, the expression of genes controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis resulted upregulated. The influence of high GC levels in PAE provokes an excessive activation of GR with extensive damage of hippocampal neurons and inhibition of BDNF in the hippocampus. The blockade of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway mediated by BDNF induced neuronal damage, a reduced synaptic plasticity and an overall deficit in neuronal circuits that can predispose to depression. This inhibition suppresses the HPA axis programming and the effects persist into adulthood. The high-fat diet after birth causing an over-excitability of the HPA axis produced also an elevated expression of GR in female offspring and a downregulation of the BDNF pathway that can be linked to depression-like behavior (Yu et al., 2020). In the rat, selective knockdown of GR expression in the corticolimbus is linked to an increase in HPA activity both under basal and stressful conditions (Barden, 2004; Boyle et al., 2005; Ridder et al., 2005) whereas GR overexpression is linked to a decrease in HPA response to acute stress (Reichardt et al., 2000). In humans, major depressive disorder is linked to the decline in GR expression, the elevation in HPA activity and the alteration of corticosteroid feedback (de Kloet et al., 2005; Neigh and Nemeroff, 2006)."
23,Conclusions,"FASD is a serious problematic in many countries and its impact in terms of cost for the health system and quality of life of affected individuals is significant. For this reason, an improvement of our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and the development of strategies of intervention that can prevent, reduce or eliminate the dangerous effect of alcohol exposure is mandatory. The challenge for future research is to clarify the connection between environmental events, epigenetics marks, stress pathways and genome function. Many variable factors whose effects overlap and cumulate make difficult to obtain clear conclusions about PAE and consequently in researches concerning FASD. The pathophysiology, the development and the role of individual sensitivity to alcohol effects are still largely unknown (Ledda et al., 2019; Coriale et al., 2019; Ceccanti et al., 2018; Ceccanti et al., 2015). Moreover, animal models are not completely translatable to humans and there is a lack of clinical evidence in the investigation of potential treatments. Many factors have a role in FASD development: amount and timing of ethanol exposure, epigenetics and genetic background, other forms of addiction and comorbidities (infections, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease), nutrition and lifestyle. Further investigation is required in many research areas including that on ethanol metabolites, that can be collected in body fluids, meconium or hair and can be used as biomarkers of ethanol intake and also for early FASD detection. In this context, the use of metabolomics could be more specific and sensitive. Another promising area is represented by gene expression data analysis that studies the direct effect of ethanol on transcriptome and consequently on the proteome. In this area, a meta-analysis of gene expression pattern in PAE animal models revealed a general downregulation in gene expression (Rogic et al., 2016). An open question is if this downregulation could be reversible and what pharmacological treatment eventually could counteract it. However, the reversibility of the stress-induced epigenomic modifications opens the possibility of targeting epigenetics marks to restore the pre-disorder state or to stabilize a resilient condition. Anyway, this attempt is still largely speculative since therapeutic substances such as DNMT modulators and HDAC inhibitor are global non-specific drugs and also by the reason that antidepressants, such as valproic acid, possess epigenetics effects (Gottlicher et al., 2001). Epigenetics modifiers could also be used to re-open windows of enhanced epigenomic plasticity within which conventional or psychiatric therapies could take advantage (Sweatt, 2009). Beyond their therapeutic potential, epigenetics marks could help in monitoring therapeutic approaches (Roberts et al., 2014). Animal models of prenatal stress-related disorders provide an excellent resource to understand the spatial and temporal complexity of epigenetics regulation and their interaction with childhood adversity and genetic predisposition (Laviola et al., 1994; Fiore et al., 2001; Angelucci et al., 1999; Fiore et al., 1998; Fiore et al., 2000; Di Fausto et al., 2007). Longitudinal studies of several tissues are important to clarify the chain of molecular events following trauma and to identify specific cell types and tissues affected. Actually, epigenetics studies are performed in a mixture of cells, but this type of research will benefit from new techniques and cellular systems. New approaches are nowadays available: single-cell RNA expression profiling (Zeisel et al., 2015); positron emission tomography neuroimaging with ligands that target epigenetics marks (such as HDAC1 inhibitors) and correlate peripheral epigenetics changes with brain imaging (Wang et al., 2014). Moreover, the generation of neuronal cells using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can overcome the non-availability of brain tissues in humans (Brennand et al., 2011). Ethanol exposition during development dysregulates also redox pathways of neuronal cells causing a long-lasting upregulation of the HPA axis and accounting for the neurological and behavioral deficits observed in FASD. A greater understanding of the key role of ethanol-induced oxidative stress together with a better knowledge of long-term consequences of oxidative stress in brain structure and function and its involvement in DNA damage of germ cells is required. Oxidative stress modifies DNA methylation patterns and alters the epigenetics imprinting; treatment with antioxidants substances, such as vitamins C and E, folic acid, glutamine, boric acid, choline and selenium, as demonstrated in animal models, can revert ethanol-induced phenotypes (Gupta et al., 2017)."
