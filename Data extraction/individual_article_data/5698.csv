0,Introduction,"CO2 is a greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to global warming, and hence the concentration of CO2 exhausted into the atmosphere should be reduced or CO2 should be removed using various technologies, including capture, sequestration, and utilization [1–4]. Energetically, CO2 is a very stable low-reactive gas molecule that features two double bonds between its atoms; the activation of its strong double bonds would require significant energy input [5–8]. The addition of an active catalyst to the reaction system is an effective solution for the efficient activation of CO2, as the catalyst would decrease the activation energy and could ultimately reduce the energy input required for the reaction. The Lewis acid behavior of CO2 can be explained using the molecular orbital theory, as the energy level of the antibonding molecular orbitals of CO2 molecules in ground state is high [6–8]. These unoccupied orbitals could act as Lewis acid sites, which could accept external electrons and further activate them. However, the bandgap between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of CO2 was calculated to be ∼10 eV (∼964.8 kJ mol−1) [9–11]. Therefore, strongly basic catalysts that exhibit good affinity for the unoccupied orbitals of the CO2 molecule are required to activate the stable and acidic CO2 molecule by overcoming such a large bandgap [8,11,12]. The catalytic reduction of CO2 using H2 under high pressure is a promising process for the activation of CO2 [13–15]. One of the main advantages of this approach is the use of reactive H2 molecules for activating the energetically stable CO2 molecule in the presence of a catalysts capable of activating both CO2 and H2. Numerous studies have been performed in this area during the past several decades. Researchers have used various basic substances not only as catalyst supports to activate H2, but also as catalysts for the activation of the Lewis acidic CO2 molecule [16–18]. Typically, basic metal oxide materials that exhibit high porosity and high surface area, which allow them to achieve good dispersion of catalytic metal components, have been used for this purpose. Fe-based catalysts supported on various metal oxides promoted with alkali metal cations have been investigated for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight (usually > C5). Owing to the fast kinetics of the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, CO which is typically an intermediate product, was the major product when the conversion of CO2 was ∼30% at the slow gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1320 cm3 g−1 h−1 [19]. However, the intermediate CO molecule could be further converted to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight using the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) reaction. It was also demonstrated that the addition of alkali metals, such as Na and K, as promoters could increase the chemisorption of CO2, whereas the adsorption of H2 would be decreased [20,21]. This could suppress the formation of CH4 and eventually increase the selectivity for hydrocarbons of high molecular weight. Surface doping of metal oxide supports using Mn or Cu as promoters could also increase their surface basicity and result in similar effects [22–25]. Recently, a Na-promoted Fe3O4 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 zeolite has been investigated for the direct conversion of CO2 to gasoline-range (C5-C11) liquid hydrocarbons [26]. In addition, it was reported that the bifunctional catalyst consisting of reducible In2O3 and HZSM-5 zeolite has been investigated for the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons with almost 80% selectivity, in which it was demonstrated that the oxygen-vacancy sites on the In2O3 catalyst could activate CO2 and H2 simultaneously [27]. To convert CO2 to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight using CO as intermediate, the basicity of the catalyst should be controlled to achieve efficient activation of Lewis acidic CO2 and adequate adsorption affinity for H2. The facile and highly selective conversion of CO2 to CO is the first reaction stage, which should be followed by a FT-type reaction to produce hydrocarbons of high molecular weight. The catalysts used for the FT reaction have been studied more in depth than those used for the CO2 conversion process and are already commercialized and used in many industries. Therefore, to design such direct and consecutive conversion technology of CO2 to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight, the development of active catalysts for the first reaction stage of CO2 to CO should be a priority research topic. Supporting materials, which are usually porous metal oxides, are very important for achieving good catalytic performance as they ensure the proper dispersion of the metal nanoparticle catalyst components. In addition, the adsorption affinity of these materials for CO2 and H2 should be delicately controlled for energy-efficient hydrogenation to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight via CO as intermediate. Otherwise, as previously reported, the formation of CH4 would dominate, which is undesirable for the production of hydrocarbons of high molecular weight [19,20]. Therefore, the basicity of the catalyst itself and that of the catalyst support are very important. Although the consensus that the basicity of catalyst support is important has been reached, the catalytic role of supporting materials on the activation of CO2 during hydrogenation has not been entirely elucidated yet. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to clarify the role of the basicity of metal oxides during the catalytic process as well as their role of support for metal nanoparticles. Therefore, we selected a series of bimetallic oxide materials with spinel structure as catalyst candidates. The unit cell formula of bimetallic spinel oxides is AB2O4, where A and B are divalent and trivalent metal cations, respectively, that are covalently bonded to oxygen atoms and form the spinel framework. A variety of metal cations could be used to obtain the spinel framework, which can be a significant advantage for constructing a set of catalysts with the least number of structural variables. In this study, a series of aluminum spinel oxides where a divalent metal cation is varied with Mg2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ was synthesized. These spinel oxides presented very different basicity, and hence their catalytic activity was different. In addition, the synthesized mesoporous spinel oxide catalysts presented higher catalytic activity than their commercial counterparts, which featured lower surface area and smaller pore volume. Furthermore, a reasonable catalysis descriptor was discovered from catalytic reactions that used the series of spinel catalysts of different basicity, which proposed that not all basic sites were involved in the activation of CO2, but only the strongly basic sites can effectively activate CO2. Systematic studies of the reactions that used the set of spinel oxides as catalysts could shed light on the future design of highly active heterogeneous catalyst for the activation of CO2 to hydrocarbons of high molecular weight using hydrogen."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of spinel oxides,"2.1 Synthesis of spinel oxides Spinel oxides were synthesized via the co-precipitation method by mixing the metal precursors in isopropyl alcohol. Aluminum isopropoxide (>98%, Sigma Aldrich) was used as Al precursor. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (99%, Junsei Chemical), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (97%, Daejung Chemicals & Metals), Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (98%, Sigma Aldrich), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (98%, Daejung Chemicals & Metals) were used as Mg(II), Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) precursors, respectively. In a typical synthesis procedure for CuAl2O4 spinel oxide, 0.06 mol (12.255 g) of aluminum isopropoxide was dissolved in 80 g of isopropyl alcohol in a round-bottomed flask, and the resultant solution was heated on a hot plate under reflux and stirring for 2 h. Then, 10 ml of aqueous solution that contained 0.03 mol (6.977 g) of Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O was added to the flask dropwise, and the resultant solution was further heated on a hot plate under reflux and stirring for 3 h. After the final solution was cooled to room temperature, it was titrated with an aqueous solution of NH4OH (25–30%, Daejung Chemicals & Metals) to adjust the pH of the solution to 9.5. The resultant solution was further stirred for 3 h, and the solid precipitate was filtered followed by drying in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The dried solid powder was calcined in a furnace at 800 °C for 4 h under O2 flow (100 cm3 min−1), which led to the formation of crystalline CuAl2O4. The synthesis procedure and gel composition of all other spinel oxides were the same as that described above, only different nitrates were used as metal precursors."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized spinel oxides were obtained using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 apparatus with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) at 40 kV and 15 mA (600 W). All measurements were performed under ambient conditions, at the step size of 0.02°, the scanning rate of 2° min−1, and in the 2θ range of 25° to 70°. N2 adsorption isotherms were obtained using a BEL/Belsorb mini II instrument at 77 K. Prior to these measurements, all samples were degassed at 400 °C for 2 h. The surface area of the spinel oxide samples was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory [28], and their total pore volume and pore size distribution were obtained from the adsorption branches using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) algorithm [29]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai F-20 (Philips) instrument operating at 200 kV (lattice resolution: 0.19 nm). Images were recorded using a CCD camera at high magnification under low-dose conditions. CO2 or NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out using a BEL-CAT (BEL Japan, Inc.) analyzer. The exhaust gases desorbed from the spinel oxide samples were analyzed by thermal conductivity detector (TCD), which allowed quantitative and qualitative analyses of basic and acidic sites. Prior to the CO2-TPD measurement with TCD, CO2-TPD with quadrupole mass spectrometer confirmed that most of desorbed species during CO2-TPD process was species having m/z = 44 corresponding to CO2 and traceable amounts of other components such as O2 with m/z = 32 were observed. Prior to the TPD measurements, all samples were pre-treated using a stream of He for 1 h at 500 °C in a quartz cell followed by cooling to 50 °C. The adsorption of CO2 and NH3 was performed using 19.8%CO2/He and 5%NH3/He flows, respectively, for 1 h. After purging the cell with He for 30 min, TPD measurements were performed by increasing the temperature of the cell from 50 to 980 °C (ramping rate of 10 °C min−1) and maintaining the temperature at 980 °C for 1 h under He flow."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The hydrogenation of CO2 was performed in an Inconel continuous flow fixed-bed microreactor (Scheme S1 in Supporting Information). The reaction was conducted at 20 bar and various temperatures (300, 320, 350 and 400 °C), and the gas flow rates were controlled using a mass flow controller (LineTech). The temperature of the reactor was monitored using a thermocouple located inside the catalyst bed. During a typical reaction, 0.5 g of catalyst was physically mixed with 1.0 g of sea sand (14–20 mesh, Wako Chemicals), and the mixture was placed on a fixed bed inside the microreactor. The catalyst was pretreated by purging it with Ar (50 cm3 min−1) which was followed by the addition of H2 (60 cm3 min−1) for the reduction reaction while increasing the temperature to 400 °C under ambient pressure conditions (Scheme S2 in Supporting Information). After the temperature reached 300 °C, the gas mixture that contained 21% CO2, 63% H2, and 16% balance gas (Ar) (flow rate: 84.0 cm3 min−1) was introduced into the reactor (GHSV = 10 080 cm3 g−1 h−1). After 200 min, the reaction temperature was further increased to 320, 350 and 400 °C consecutively at the ramping rate of 1 °C min−1. The process was monitored for 200 min at each reaction temperature. The reaction was monitored using a gas chromatography (GC) instrument that was connected to the outlet of the reactor. The GC instrument was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) connected with a capillary column (HP-INNOWAX, 30 m length, 0.20 mm diameter, 0.50 μm thickness) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected with a packed column (Supelco Analytical Metal packed GC column, 1.5 m length, 1/8-inch outer diameter, 2.1 mm inner diameter). The carbon balances for all reactions were calculated, and the average values for all reactions were approximately 95%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The crystalline structure of the synthesized spinel oxides was characterized using powder XRD, and was compared with that of a commercially available spinel oxide (i.e., MgAl2O4(comm.), Sigma Aldrich). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the XRD peaks of all the materials could be assigned to the same Miller indices, which confirmed that the typical XRD patterns corresponded to the crystal structure of spinel. All reflections were located at positions similar to those of MgAl2O4(comm.) with similar relative peak intensities. However, a small discrepancy in the peak positions was observed owing to the different lattice parameters that originated from the different sizes of the divalent metals present in the spinel frameworks. The XRD intensities with peak broadness were different and depended on the divalent metal present in the spinel framework. Particularly, the peaks of the synthesized MgAl2O4 spinel were broader than those of MgAl2O4(comm.), which suggested that the structure of the synthesized spinel was nanocrystalline. Figs. 1B and C shows the N2 adsorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distributions, respectively, or the synthesized spinel oxides. All synthesized spinel oxides presented type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops in the high relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.4-0.9, which could serve as evidence for their mesoporous structure. A steep increase in the amount of adsorbed N2 was observed in this relative pressure range, which indicated the adsorption of N2 inside the mesopores. By contrast, MgAl2O4(comm.) adsorbed very small amounts of N2, and the amount of adsorbed N2 did not significantly increase in the high P/P0 range. Therefore, it was concluded that the pore volume and surface area of the MgAl2O4(comm.) sample were smaller than that of the synthesized mesoporous MgAl2O4. The BET surface area of the synthesized MgAl2O4 sample was approximately three times higher than that of the MgAl2O4(comm.) (199 vs. 77 m2 g−1) while the total pore volume of the synthesized MgAl2O4 sample was twice as large as that of the MgAl2O4(comm.) (0.47 vs. 0.24 cm3 g−1) (Table 1 ). The mesoporous structure of spinel oxides was further characterized using TEM (Fig. 2 ). All spinel oxides exhibited highly nanocrystalline frameworks, and the individual spinel nanocrystals were different in size. The bright void spaces observed between the nanocrystals corresponded to the intercrystalline mesopores, and their presence was already confirmed using the N2 adsorption analysis results. Crystal lattice fringes could only be conspicuously observed for ZnAl2O4. In addition, the individual ZnAl2O4 spinel nanocrystals were slightly larger than those of the other analyzed spinel oxides. This was consistent with the features of the XRD spectra, wherein ZnAl2O4 presented the most intense XRD reflections of all spinel oxides in this study. The basic properties of the spinel oxide samples were analyzed using CO2 TPD. Fig. 1D depicts the CO2 TPD profiles of all spinel oxide samples, and includes quantitative and qualitative information on their basicity after the deconvolution of the original TPD profiles depending on the desorption temperature. The TPD profiles of the spinel oxide samples were noticeably different, which indicated that their basic properties were significantly different. The spinel oxide samples presented different amounts of basic sites of different strengths (Table 1). The total amounts of basic sites of CuAl2O4, CoAl2O4, and MgAl2O4 were similar and ranged from 140 to 150 mmol g−1. By contrast, the total amount of basic sites of ZnAl2O4 was the smallest (∼30 mmol g−1) of all samples. The strength of the basic sites could be determined using the TPD signals of the samples obtained at different temperatures. Of all spinel oxide samples, CuAl2O4 presented a very intense TPD signal at approximately 980 °C, followed by CoAl2O4, which presented an intense peak at approximately 900 °C. The integrated area of the TPD peaks at higher desorption temperature (>800 °C) was used to estimate the quantity of strong basic sites, and it was determined that the amount of strong basic sites decreased as follows: CuAl2O4 > CoAl2O4 > MgAl2O4(comm.) > ZnAl2O4 > MgAl2O4. Namely, the CuAl2O4 sample presented the largest amount of basic sites of all analyzed spinel oxide samples. The acidic properties of spinel oxide samples are also analyzed using NH3 TPD (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information), demonstrating that the acidic properties are also significantly different depending on the spinel oxide samples. However, the absolute amounts of acidic sites of all spinel oxide samples were almost negligible compared with the amounts of basic sites, and therefore, it was concluded that the basic character of the spinel oxide samples was predominant. The reducibility of spinel oxide samples was measured with H2 TPR (Fig. S2 in Supporting Information). Of all the spinel oxide samples, MgAl2O4(comm.) showed two distinct H2 consumption peaks at 500 and 750 °C, indicating that the MgAl2O4(comm.) is highly reducible. In contrast, it is noteworthy that no intense H2 consumption peaks were observed in the synthesized MgAl2O4 sample, indicating that the mesoporous MgAl2O4 synthesized in this work is almost non-reducible. Similarly, ZnAl2O4 sample was much more non-reducible without any H2 consumption peaks, and hence H2 TPR data for ZnAl2O4 sample could not be acquired. CoAl2O4 sample showed a very broad H2 consumption peak beyond 600 °C. Such high reduction temperature indicated that CoAl2O4 sample is also less reducible. In contrast, CuAl2O4 sample show a distinct H2 consumption peak at 210 °C, which might be attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ inside the CuAl2O4 framework to Cu+. All the spinel oxide samples were further characterized with XRD after the reduction at 400 °C under the pretreatment condition using H2/Ar flow and compared with the fresh samples before the pretreatment (Fig. S3 in Supporting Information). After pretreatment, the initial spinel structure was fully maintained for all the samples, but most of the XRD peaks were broadened. Of all the spinel oxide samples, only CuAl2O4 sample showed a distinct H2 consumption peak below 400 °C. However, any additional XRD peaks were not appeared for the pretreated CuAl2O4 sample. This suggested that the quantity of reduced phase was very small. In overall, it could be stated that the pretreatment condition for the following reaction studies could not make any distinguishable metallic phase and the spinel phase could be almost fully maintained due to its very stable and rigid crystalline architecture."
7,Hydrogenation of CO2 using spinel oxide catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogenation of CO2 using spinel oxide catalysts The catalytic activity of the spinel oxide samples was investigated during the hydrogenation of CO2 under pressurized H2 gas. Fig. 3 illustrates the kinetic reaction profiles of the four synthesized spinel oxide catalysts compared with that of the MgAl2O4(comm.) catalyst at the reaction temperatures of 300, 320, 350 and 400 °C as functions of the time-on-stream (Figs. 3A–E), and the respective CO2 conversion and product selectivity average values at different reaction temperatures (Figs. 3F–J and Table 2 ). The reaction results demonstrated that the spinel oxide catalysts presented apparent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO2. Depending on the catalysts and reaction temperature, the average conversion values of CO2 ranged from ∼5% to ∼45% (closed black circles in the graphs in Fig. 3). Such high conversion values were remarkable for the reaction conditions in this study, where the GHSV (10 080 cm3 g−1 h−1) value was high. While most spinel oxide catalysts continuously convert CO2 without appreciable deactivation during the reaction process (Figs. 3A–E), the CO2 conversion capacity of CoAl2O4 gradually decreased as the reaction went on. When CoAl2O4 was used as catalyst, CH4 was the major reaction product, and its selectivity was approximately 80% at the tested reaction temperatures. By contrast, the other spinel oxide catalysts were more active for generating CO as the major product, and their selectivity exceeded 78% at all reaction temperatures, of which the reaction may follow the RWGS reaction pathway. Small amounts of CH4 and CH3OH were also produced as minor products, but their selectivity did not exceed ∼20% upon increasing the reaction temperature to 400 °C. The distinct deactivation phenomenon observed for the CoAl2O4 catalyst could be explained by the formation of CH4 as the major product. Compared with other spinel oxide catalysts, CoAl2O4 produced more than 80% CH4 as the major product. Co-based materials are very effective catalyst for the CO2 methanation as well as the production of CH4 via FT-type syngas (CO + H2) conversion [24,30–32]. Similar to the Co-based catalysts reported in other papers, the CoAl2O4 catalyst in this study was also very active for the formation of CH4 [21,33,34]. When CH4 is produced during the hydrogenation of CO2, metal carbide species could form on the surface of the catalyst, and these carbide species could react with H2 to generate reactive CHx species that could be further hydrogenated to CH4. During this process, the main catalytic sites could be gradually deactivated owing to the formation of metal carbides [30,35]. Similarly, the deactivation of the CoAl2O4 catalyst in our study could be attributed to the formation of cobalt carbide (Co2C) species on the surface of the catalyst. When the XRD spectra of the spent and fresh CoAl2O4 catalyst samples were compared, it was possible to identify the cobalt carbide (Co2C) phase at 2θ value of 42.5° (Fig. S4 in Supporting Information) [36]. In addition, a thin layer of carbonaceous structure with ca. 1.1 nm thickness was observed on the external surface of spent CoAl2O4 catalyst (Fig. S5 in Supporting Information). Of all spinel oxide catalysts in this study, only CoAl2O4 presented appreciable deactivation. Moreover, the major reaction product of all spinel oxide catalysts, except for CoAl2O4, was CO, and their selectivity exceeded 78%. When CO was the major product, no reactive carbonaceous species and CHx species could be formed during the conversion of CO2 to CO. Accordingly, the surface of the catalyst remained almost intact during the reaction process, and no significant deactivation occurred. In addition, almost no differences were observed in the XRD patterns and peak intensities of the spent and fresh spinel oxide catalysts, except for CoAl2O4 (Fig. S4 in Supporting Information). The catalytic activity of all spinel oxide catalysts depended on the reaction temperature. CuAl2O4 exhibited the highest CO2 conversion (average value of 25.8%) at low reaction temperature (300 °C), and the conversion degree significantly decreased as follows: CoAl2O4 (16.5%) > ZnAl2O4 (7.0%) > MgAl2O4 (5.1%) > MgAl2O4(comm.) (4.8%). The CO2 conversion values of all spinel oxide catalysts increased as the reaction temperature increased. At 400 °C, CoAl2O4 presented the strongest catalytic activity and the conversion of 45.7%, followed, in order, by CuAl2O4, ZnAl2O4, MgAl2O4, and MgAl2O4(comm.). However, except for the CoAl2O4 catalyst, which generated CH4 as the major reaction product, CuAl2O4 exhibited the highest catalytic activity of all spinel catalysts that generated CO as the major reaction product, and its average CO2 conversion value was 38.6% at 400 °C. Therefore, CuAl2O4 was the most active catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to CO at the tested reaction temperatures. It is noteworthy that CuAl2O4 spinel oxide catalyst maintained its initial catalytic performances up to four repetitive reaction tests without significant deactivation and changes in product selectivity (Fig. S6 and Table S2 in Supporting Information)."
8,Effect of basicity of spinel catalysts during hydrogenation of CO2,"3.3 Effect of basicity of spinel catalysts during hydrogenation of CO2 We attempted to correlate the catalytic activity of all spinel oxide catalysts with their properties. According to the CO2 and NH3 TPD analysis results, the basicity of all spinel oxide catalysts was high and their acidity low. Typically, the Lewis acidic CO2 molecule should be adsorbed on basic sites for its activation, and consequently, the amount of CO2 converted during a given reaction time would be correlated with the number of basic sites of each spinel oxide catalyst. When the average CO2 conversion values were plotted against the total quantity of basic sites, the graphs consisted of very scattered data points and no systematic relationships were observed (Fig. S7 in Supporting Information). This could suggest that only a fraction of all basic sites were directly involved in the activation of CO2. However, when the CO2 conversion was plotted against the quantity of strong basic sites determined using the CO2 TPD results, a linear relationship was observed (Fig. 4 ). As the amount of strong basic sites of the spinel oxide catalysts increased, the CO2 conversion increased linearly. The correlation coefficient (R2) was almost 1 at the low reaction temperature of 300 °C, but significantly deviated from 1 as the reaction temperature increased to 400 °C. However, the linear relationship between the amount of strong basic sites and the CO2 conversion could still be observed at the tested reaction temperatures. From the above findings that the strong basic sites were directly involved in the activation of CO2 during the hydrogenation reaction, it was proposed that the amount of strong basic sites of spinel oxide catalysts could be the catalysis descriptor that would explain the activation of CO2. In addition, the strong basic sites could be considered the actual catalytic sites for the activation of CO2. Based on this assumption, the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction could be obtained using the Arrhenius equation at four different reaction temperatures. Fig. 5 depicts the Arrhenius plots: the turnover frequency (ln(TOF), s−1) as function of temperature (1000/T, K−1), of the reactions that used the synthesized and commercially available spinel oxides as catalysts. The TOF was calculated using the amount of CO2 converted on the strong basic sites of all spinel oxide catalysts during a given reaction time. The activation energies (Ea) and pre-exponential factors (A) could be derived from the y-intercept and slope of the linear regression, respectively, of these linear plots. All plots presented linear regression, and the R2 values were very close to 1. The Ea values of CuAl2O4, MgAl2O4(comm.), MgAl2O4, CoAl2O4, and ZnAl2O4 increased from 13.0 to 14.6, 17.1, 30.9, and 39.7 kJ mol−1, respectively. The contribution of CuAl2O4 to the reduction of the activation energy was the greatest of all studied catalysts, which indicated that its catalytic power for activating the RWGS reaction was the strongest of all analyzed catalysts at the tested reaction temperatures. In addition, the Ea value of the CuAl2O4 catalyst for the RWGS reaction was much smaller than those reported in the literature for Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts [37–39]. For example, the Ea value of the Cu/ZnO catalyst, which was obtained using ZnO as support for metallic Cu, for the RWGS reaction, exceeded 50 kJ mol−1 [37–39]. This was attributed to the strong basicity of CuAl2O4 compared with those of other Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts, which could bind CO2 very strongly for its activation. As proposed above, the strong basic sites could be the catalytic sites for activation of CO2. The strong basic sites might be related with the oxygen-vacancy sites in the spinel framework, at which the CO2 molecules could be bound via strong chemisorption. Recently, it was reported that the oxygen-vacancy sites in In2O3 catalyst could be the catalytic sites for CO2 hydrogenation in the presence of H2 [27]. According to this work, CO2 molecules could annihilate the oxygen-vacancy sites via strong adsorption. Such oxygen-vacancy sites were also active for H2 activation, and thus the CO2 molecules could be hydrogenated into hydrocarbons via CO as the intermediate species. Similarly, in the present work, the strong basic sites might be the oxygen-vacancy sites having the strong adsorption affinity to CO2 molecules, which could be the catalytic sites for activation of CO2. If this is the case, H2 molecules could also be activated by the oxygen-vacancy sites though the distinguishable metallic phases were not present. Consequently, CO2 and H2 molecules could be simultaneously activated on the strong basic sites (i.e., oxygen-vacancy sites), as reported above [27]. The pre-exponential factor (A) is a mathematical constant, but it can provide physical information about the collision frequency. The collision frequency of mesoporous MgAl2O4 was one order of magnitude higher than that of MgAl2O4(comm.). This could be explained by the highly mesoporous structure allowing for more facile molecular diffusion, which increased the collisions of CO2 with the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, the mesoporous structure significantly contributed to the higher catalytic activity of MgAl2O4 compared with that of MgAl2O4(comm.). In addition, the mesopore void spaces could be further used to support and disperse additional catalytic metal components. This will be investigated in more details in future studies."
9,Conclusions,"Mesoporous bimetallic spinel oxides were synthesized using the co-precipitation of divalent and trivalent metal components under basic conditions. Depending on the divalent metal (Mg, Co, Cu, and Zn) present in the spinel framework, the resultant spinel oxides exhibited different porosity (surface area, pore volume, and pore size) and basicity (quantity and strength of basic sites). Owing to their strong basic sites, which could adsorb Lewis acidic CO2, all spinel oxides exhibited sufficiently high catalytic activity during the conversion of CO2 under hydrogenation conditions even in the absence of additional catalytic metal components for the activation of H2. The catalytic activity of the spinel oxides was high, and their average CO2 conversion values ranged from ∼5% to ∼45% depending on the reaction temperature (300, 320, 350 and 400 °C). The major contribution of this study was the discovery of a catalysis descriptor that linearly correlated with the catalytic activity of the spinel oxides: not all basic sites contributed to the activation of CO2, only the sufficiently strong ones did. Of all spinel oxide catalysts analyzed, CuAl2O4 possessed the largest amount of strong basic sites, and hence, it exhibited the strongest catalytic power and featured the smallest Ea value for the activation of CO2 to produce CO via the RWGS reaction pathway. The spinel oxide catalysts synthesized in this study are under further investigation for designing multifunctional catalysts having additional catalytic metal nanoparticles. Such catalysts could present tandem catalytic functions that could facilitate the conversion of CO2 to CO, which could subsequently be converted to hydrocarbons of large molecular weight via the FT-type reaction pathway."
