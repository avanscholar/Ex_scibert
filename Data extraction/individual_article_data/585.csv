0,Introduction,"The contradiction between environmental protection and society development is becoming more and more prominent in 21 st century. At the same time, the issue of energy crisis is becoming more realistic. Obviously, it goes without saying that clean energy technology is an effective method to solve this issue [1]. Benefit from its high calorific value (1.28 × 107 J/m3) hydrogen is regarded as one of the most perspective clean energy [2]. Since the first discovery of photoelectrochemical water splitting phenomenon by Fujishima in 1972, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution technology has been attracted a lot of interest [3,4]. In past decades, various photocatalysts have been reported, such as TiO2 [5], WO3 [6], CdS [7], Zn0.5Cd0.5S [8], ZnIn2S4 [9], g-C3N4 [10], et al. Thereinto, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) has good prospects for industrial application due to its low cost, poisonless and harmless. However, low apparent quantum yield and high recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is still the big issue for g-C3N4 [11]. Thus, finding a way to solve these issues is the quite important role for the large sacle application of g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The g-C3N4 systems have been studied comprehensively, and show the excellent photocatalytic activity for water splitting [12,13], CO2 reduction reaction [14] and degradation of pollutants [15,16]. Generally, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4 can be enhanced by several methods: co-catalyst modification [17,18], semiconductor coupling [19], metal or nonmental ion doping, et al. Compared to other cocatalyst, noble metal with lower Fermi level has decent performance in enhancing the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. (e.g. Pt [20], Pd [21], Ag [22], Au [23]). Due to the synergistic effect [24], bimetallic alloy shows high H2 evolution activity. Han et al. discovered that NiMo alloys decorated two dimensional (2D) g-C3N4 nanosheet via simple one-pot synthesis method can offer a high hydrogen release activity [25]. Urie et al. reported that PtPd co-catalysts supported on Nb-doped TiO2 have superior performance in hydrogen evolution, and point out the critical role of the metal-support interface [26]. Eiler’s group presented a method to synthesize AuPd alloy NPs supported on titanium silicalite-1 which exhibits amazing charm for the catalytic activity [27]. Chen et al. constructed a FeCu/g-C3N4 system with improving photocatalytic activity [28]. Among various kinds of metal, the Pd metal have appropriate energy level, and the cost is lower than the Pt metal. However, Pd-based cocatalysts have a lower active surface area, so a second metal can be added into Pd-based cocatalysts to achieve higher catalytic performance [29]. As the noble metals, the Ag metal with SPR effect shows intense visible light absorption [30]. Mori et al. proved that PdAg alloy nanoparticles supported on TiO2 can enhance the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to formic acid [31]. Werth et al. demonstrated that alloying Pd with Ag increased the catalytic activity for NO2– hydrogenative reduction [32]. The electronic and geometric effect between Pd and Ag is benefit for prompting its photocatalytic performance. Inspired by these literatures, the PdAg bimetallic alloy should be a promising cocatalyst to achieve high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Additionally, constructing heterojunction structure can not only suppress the recombination between electrons and holes, but also widen the light-response range [30]. On account of these advantages, various g-C3N4-based heterojunction photocatalytic systems have been reported, such as Ni(OH)2/g-C3N4 [33], TiO2/g-C3N4 [34], WO3/g-C3N4 [35], ZnO/g-C3N4 [36] and CeO2/g-C3N4 [37]. The design of g-C3N4-based heterostructures depends on their energy band structures [38]. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), which has a narrow band gap about 2.42 eV, can absorb the light in visible range, and has the proper VB and CB that is well matched with g-C3N4. Thus, the heterostructures built between CdS and g-C3N4 would be effective in promoting the separation and transfer process of photogenerated charge carriers [39]. The two dimensional g-C3N4 offers abundant surface active sites for the combination with other components due to much larger specific surface area [40]. Inprevious reports, researchers fabricated successfully the CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunction via various methods, such as wet chemical method [41], in situ synthesis method [42], hydrothermal method [43] and ultrasonication method [40]. The Mott–Schottky heterojunctions of noble metal/g-C3N4 were constructed in situ [44] and sedimentation by light or strong reducing agents [43]. In this study, a novel ternary CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 composite has been designed and synthesized by chemical deposition and hydrothermal method [45]. The ternary photocatalyst has a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compare to g-C3N4. The result illustrates that 40 wt% CdS/4 wt% PdAg/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibits the best hydrogen production performance, which can reach up to 3098.3 μmol g−1 h−1 with a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 9.6% at 420 nm. The structural characteristics are investigated by XRD, TEM, XPS and DRS techniques. The charge transfer behaviors of photogenerated electron-hole pairs are studied by PL, SPV, EIS and ESR techniques. This study can pave a new way to design the high efficient ternary photocatalytic systems."

3,Synthesis of the 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of the 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets 2D g-C3N4 was prepared by thermal polycondensation method [46]. 10 g of urea, as the precursor, was uniformly dispersed in the bottom of the crucible. With the heating rate of 5°C min−1, the urea was heated at 550°C for 4 h in muffle furnace, then natural cooled. To finish thermal oxidation etching, muffle furnace was further heated to 500°C for 2 h. Ultrathin two dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitrides were obtained."
4,Synthesis of the PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"2.3 Synthesis of the PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites On the basis of the previous work, PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was synthesized with hydrazine hydrate and metal salts. Typically, 0.2 g g-C3N4 nanosheets were dissolved in the 40 mL solvent of ethylene glycol and then ultrasonic dispersed for 1 h. Afterwards, a certain amount of AgNO3 solution and 2 g/L PdCl2 was slowly added to the mixed liquid, and stirred the solution for 5 min (Pd: Ag = 0.5: 0.5). After dropwise adding of hydrazine hydrates, the solution instantly became grey, then stirred at room temperature. 4 h later, the resulting product was completely washed with water and alcohol, and dried at 60 °C in vacuum oven. According to the mass ratios of the PdAg alloy NPs, the product was referred as x wt.% PdAg/g-C3N4."
5,Synthesis of the CdS nanorods and CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"2.4 Synthesis of the CdS nanorods and CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites In accordance with the previous work [47], CdS nanorods are also prepared by hydrothermal method. 0.9134 g Cd(NO3)·6H2O and 0.3005 g thioacetamide was added into 64 mL alcohol, and stirred thorough dissolution. Then 16 mL ethylenediamine was dropwise put in stirred dissolution, and stirred half an hour.When the mixed solution appeared the uniform yellow suspension, it was transfered from beaker to Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 180 °C for 48 h. Finally, the CdS nanorods were washed with water and ethanol, and dry under vacuum at 70 °C. The ternary CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were prepared by sonochemical synthesis [40]. The reaction solution, as-prepared PdAg/g-C3N4 and CdS nanorods were added in the beaker with deionized water, and were ultrasonicated for 1 h, and then continuously stirred. After 24 h, the mixed solution was centrifugated and washed with deionized water and ethanol, and the rinsed CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 (CSACN) nanocomposites were dried at 60 °C for 8 h in vacuum. According to the mass ratios of the CdS nanorods, the product was referred as y wt.% CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4. For contrast, CdS/g-C3N4(CSCN)without PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs are also synthesized via the identical methods. The sample synthesis process is shown in Fig. 1 ."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The crystal structure of the samples were characterized by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using CuK radiation which the diffraction angle from 5° to 80°. The microstructure of the samples were taken with transmission electron microscopy (TEM)and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), using the FEI Tecnai G2 F20. The elemental distribution was detected by Tecnai G2 F30 with Esax Genesis. The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured on Hitachi UV-4100 spectrophotometer with using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum data with the excitation wavelength of 400 nm was gained by the FLS980 spectrometer. The element-valence state was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Thermo ESCALAB 250 × . The signal of electrons and holes were characterized by the electron spin resonance (ESR) technology, which were obtained on a Bruker-type ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer equipping a quantum ray Nd utilizing YAG laser as a light source and UV cut-off filter (≥ 400 nm). The surface photovoltage (SPV) data was obtained by the PL-SPS/IPCE1000 surface photovoltage spectroscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured on a CHI760e electrochemical working station in a pH = 7, 0.5 M sodium sulfate solution electrolyte."
7,The photocatalytic H2 evolution test,"2.6 The photocatalytic H2 evolution test The photocatalytic overall water splitting test was evaluated by Perfectlight Labsolar - IIIAG system (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.), and illuminated by the PLS-SXE 300D Xenon lamp source (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) equipped with UV-cutoff filter (≥ 400 nm). Typically, The mixed solution, 50 mg photocatalytic sample and 10 mL triethanolamine was added into 90 mL deionized water, was transferred to a 300 mL quartz reactor. To maintain vacuum, the system was evacuated for 60 min by the vacuum pump, and the temperature of quartz reactor was kept at 4 °C. The generated H2 carried with high purity Ar was analysed by Beifen 3420A gas chromatograph. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated on the condition that the PLS-SXE 300D Xenon lamp source was equipped with 420 nm (±5 nm) band-pass filter. The AQY was calculated by the following: A Q Y ( % ) = t h e n u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e t r o n s t h e n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % = t h e n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s × 2 t h e n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 %"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the structures and morphologies,"3.1 Characterization of the structures and morphologies To characterize the crystal structure of the nanocomposite, the g-C3N4, CdS, PdAg/g-C3N4, CdS/g-C3N4 and CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 samples are measured by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2 , the two distinct peaks at 12.9°and 27.3°correspond to the (100) and (002) crystal plane of g-C3N4 [48]. The diffraction peaks at 24.9°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 43.8°, 47.9° and 51.9° are easily observed on the sample of CdS. According to the standard diffraction patterns of JCPDS 41-1049, these peaks are corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (112) crystal plane of CdS, respectively [49]. After the PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs are deposited on the surface of g-C3N4, the diffraction peaks at 39.1°and 45°corresponding to PdAg can be observed. These peaks are located between the (111) and (222) crystal plane of the monometallic Pd (JCPDS 87-643) and Ag (JCPDS 4-783), indicating that PdAg alloy NPs was synthesized successfully [50]. However, the diffraction peaks intensity of PdAg alloy NPs is quite weak in the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample, which may be due to the decreased loading amount of PdAg alloy NPs. Because CdS have the excellent crystallinity and the position of diffraction peaks is too close to distinguish, the XRD patterns of the nanocomposite sample did not show the (002) crystal plane of g-C3N4 [51]. TEM and HRTEM technologies are applied to reveal the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the ultrathin nanosheets are g-C3N4 sample. The CdS nanorods in Fig. 3b are in accordance with the morphology as expected. As displayed in Fig. 3c, the surface of thin g-C3N4 nanosheets are covered by CdS nanorods. The fringe distances of 0.333 nm and 0.356 nm have been observed in Fig. 3e, which correspond to the (002) and (100) crystal plane of CdS [49]. In order to check the crystal structure of the surface attached black nanoparticles, HRTEM is performed, and the fringe distance of 0.233 nm is determined, which falls between the distances of (111) plane of Pd and (111) plane of Ag (0.230 nm) in Fig. 3d. Combined with the XRD results, it is strongly suggested that the black nanoparticles are PdAg bimetallic alloy. The elemental distribution of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, cadmium, palladium and silver is illustrated in Fig. 3f by EDX elemental mapping. The palladium and silver are evenly spread on the surface of g-C3N4. The EDX mapping result indicates that CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was successfully synthesized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is applied to characterize the surface electronic states of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample. The change in binding energy regarding to the alloying effect of metallic silver and palladium was studied. In Fig.S1, the spectra of the survey of the CdS/PdAg/ g-C3N4 composite show the presence of sulfur and cadmium compared with the survey of CdS/ g-C3N4. When forming the PdAg alloy, the binding energy of Ag 3d is shifted to lower binding energy, and the Pd 3d spectra shows a positive shift to higher binding energy [52]. As presented in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4c, the Pd 3d XPS spectra of PdAg alloy NPs have two typical peaks which are correlated to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd at 336.09 eV/341.29 eV and 335.19 eV/340.39 eV, and the 5.2 eV peak separation proves the alloy of metallic Pd0 according to the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Database [52,53]. In Fig. 4b and Fig. 4d, the Ag 3d XPS spectra of PdAg alloy NPs also have two characteristic peaks correlated to metallic Ag0 [54], which are located at 367.51 eV/373.51 eV and 367.78 eV/373.78 eV belonging to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Ag. Compared with PdAg/g-C3N4 sample, the Pd spectra have a positive shift (0.9 eV) to higher binding energy, and the Ag spectra have a negative shift (0.27 eV) to lower binding energy in the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. In Fig. 4e, the C 1s XPS spectra of PdAg/g-C3N4 have two peaks located at 284.84 eV and 288.22 eV, which are standing for the C-C and N-C = N. In Fig. 4g, The N 1s XPS spectra of PdAg/g-C3N4 is divided into three peaks centered at 398.59 eV, 399.26 eV and 400.73 eV, which matches with the binding energies of C = N-C, N-C3 and C-N-H [55]. By compare the XPS spectra of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 sample shown in Fig. 4f and Fig. 4h, the binding energy of C 1s and N 1s have positive and negative shift respectively. These changes can be attributed to the electronic interaction between CdS and PdAg/g-C3N4 [56]. All the XPS results shown above certifies that the nanoparticles attached on the surface of the nanosheets are mainly composed by Ag0 and Pd0, and CdS/g-C3N4 heterostructure is formed successfully. To acquire the light absorption properties of the sample, diffuse reflection spectrum is measured and shown in Fig. 5 . The absorption edge of pure g-C3N4 and the CdS nanorods is determined to be 443 nm and 553 nm [57,58], respectively. According to the empirical equation of Eg, the band-gap energy are 2.79 eV for g-C3N4 and 2.24 eV for CdS which is consistent with the results reported in literatures [59,60]. Meanwhile, the corresponding absorption edge located at 553 nm for CdS nanorods extends the light absorption range of g-C3N4. However, two-stage absorption edges are appeared in the diffuse reflection spectra for CdS/g-C3N4 and CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 [61], which clearly demonstrate that the composite sample is constituted by CdS and g-C3N4. The heterojunction structure formed between CdS and g-C3N4 has the key role in extending the light absorption of g-C3N4, and increasing the dissociation of the photogenerated electron-hole pair at the same time [62]. The conduction band (CB) potential has been obtained by extrapolation of Mott-Schottky curves. According the reported literature [63], the position of flat band potential is similar to the conduction band for the n-type semiconductors. The conduction band of g-C3N4 and CdS are positioned at -1.45 V and -0.75 V. On the basis of the relation of the EVB, ECB and Eg, the EVB of g-C3N4 and CdS is 1.34 V and 1.49 V by calculation. Therefore, the VB and CB of CdS are well matched with g-C3N4, which can improve the efficiency of charge carrier separation via the migration of photogenerated charges at the interfaces."
10,Photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments are carried out in a 300 mL quartz reactor with 50 mg sample with addition of 90 mL deionized water and 10 mL TEOA as sacrificial reagent. As displayed in Fig. 6 a and Fig. 6b, due to the low optical absorption range and fast recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, the hydrogen production rate of pure g-C3N4 is only 12.7 μmol g−1 under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm) [64]. Meanwhile, the CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with the different contents of CdS show decent photocatalytic H2 generation activity. In the initial stage, as the content of CdS in the CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites increase, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity first increase significantly. When the content of CdS is 40 wt%, the photocatalytic H2 production rate is 85.31 times higher than that of g-C3N4. The results proved that forming heterojunction between CdS and g-C3N4 help on improving the photocatalytic H2 production performance. However, when the content of CdS continuously increased over 40 wt%, a negative effect on the photocatalytic H2 production performance appeared. Generally, overloading of CdS nanorods would reduce the light absorption of g-C3N4, and then an appropriate loading amount of CdS should be adopted. Under the same condition, the effect of PdAg alloy contents on the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample has been explored and shown in Fig. 6c and d. In general, the photocatalytic H2 production of nanocomposites has been dramatically enhanced after the deposition of PdAg alloy NPs, and the reason should be attributed to the photoelectron capture ability of PdAg alloy NPs. Among the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample, the composite with 40 wt.% CdS and 4 wt.% PdAg exhibits the best hydrogen producing performance, which can reach up to 3098.3 μmol g−1 h−1. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the performance of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample has been enhanced by 968 times, and the results indicate that the combination of heterojunction structure and cocatalyst decoration has the potential to obtain high efficient photocatalytic system. Meanwhile, the graphite carbon nitride loaded with only 4 wt% PdAg alloy NPs shows photocatalytic H2 production rate of 589.01 μmol g−1 h−1, which is far more less than the best hydrogen evolution performance of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample, indicating that a synergistic effect between CdS and PdAg exists which can significantly improve the hydrogen evolution activity of g-C3N4. Compared with the excellent performance of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4, the 4 wt% PdAg/CdS only shows photocatalytic H2 production rate of 1587.9 μmol g−1 h−1, indicating the g-C3N4 can improve the photocatalytic H2 production performance of the CdS system. To further increase the H2 evolution performance, K2HPO4 as sacrificial agent is added in the electrolyte, and ultimately raise the H2 evolution activity of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample to 3779 μmol g−1 h−1. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the 40 wt% CdS/4 wt% PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample was measured under monochromatic light irradiation at wavelength of 420 nm (±5 nm). AQY can reflect the relationship between incident photons and photogenerated charge carriers. As presented in Fig. 7 a, the AQY is determined to be 9.6%, which represents a superior conversion efficiency of photon energy. The result can be attributed to the effective generation and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The high AQY of CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample is in accordance with the high photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Photocatalyst for practical application not only needs a high hydrogen production activity but also requires a high photocatalytic stability. The cycling photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment is continuously performed for four times in 16 h. Fig. 7b shows that the hydrogen production performance has slightly decreased at the fourth cycle, which may be attributed to the loss of photocatalyst and photocorrosion caused by S2− oxidation. During the agitation process, these burst bubbles and the splashy fluids may easily cause the loss of photocatalyst. Moreover, the oxidation of some S2− by photogenerated holes and the consumption of sacrificial agent can also lead to the decreased photocatalytic performance. In Fig. S2, the hydrogen production is obviously decrease to 45.48% after four cycling hydrogen evolution tests of pure CdS nanorods. The photocorrosion of pure CdS nanorods is caused by the hole-induced oxidation of surface lattice S2−. Compared with CdS nanorods, CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 exhibit more stable hydrogen production performance, indicating that the involvement of C3N4 can relieve the photocorrosion."
11,Photogenerated electrons and holes transfer behavior,"3.3 Photogenerated electrons and holes transfer behavior Furthermore, the graphitic carbon nitride and 40 wt% CdS/4 wt% PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary samples are characterized by PL and TRPL to investigate the charge transfer behaviors of photogenerated electrons and holes. In Fig. 8 a, the g-C3N4 exhibits a stronger emission peak at 440 nm under 325 nm excitation than the 40 wt% CdS/4 wt% PdAg/g-C3N4 sample. For photoluminescence spectra, the height of luminescence peak and the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs are positively correlated, which means a higher recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the g-C3N4 sample. However, the construction of CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary structure clearly reduces the PL emission intensity, indicating that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is largely suppressed. Afterwards, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is conducted to investigate the life span of the photogenerated charge carriers. The formula used to fit the collected result and derive the average lifetime is shown as follow: τ a = A 1 × τ 1 2 + A 2 × τ 2 2 A 1 × τ 1 + A 2 × τ 2 Where A: corresponding amplitude, τ: PL emission lifetime The average lifetimes of the pure g-C3N4 and CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 samples are determined to be 4.0121 ns and 5.3135 ns, which indicates that the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary sample shows much lower recombination of electron-hole pairs, leading to an excellent photocatalytic performance. In order to explore the influence of PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs on the charge transfer process of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary composite photocatalyst, surface photovoltage (SPV) was applied in Fig. 9 . Obviously, the positive photovoltage responses observed in wavelength range from 300−550 nm are in accordance with the previous DRS results. Compared with CdS/g-C3N4, the SPV spectra of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 sample shows higher peak intensity, which further confirms the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons-holes pairs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is measured to reveal the charge transfer resistance at the solid/solution interface. In Fig. 10 , the diameter of the semicircle of the pure g-C3N4 is quite large, indicating that the charge transfer at the interface is difficult. In contrast, the diameter of the semicircle of the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 sample is much smaller, indicating a fast charge transfer process. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was performed to investigate the photoactive species in the photocatalytic process [65]. In the process of photocatalytic water-splitting for hydrogen production, the active species are normally photo-induced electrons and holes. When the irradiation condition of the sample is alternated from dark to light, the photo-induced electrons and holes can react with radical scavenger TEMPO (2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), and the height of radical scavenger signal would reduce, therefore the generation of photo-induced electrons and holes can be characterized from the signal of radical scavenger. As shown in Fig. 11 , changes in irradiation condition rarely impact the ESR signals for pure g-C3N4, indicating a low concentration of photon-generated charge carriers which may attribute to the ultrafast recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes [66]. On the contrary, the changes of the ESR signals are apparent for the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 ternary photocatalyst under different illumination conditions (dark, irradiated for 5 min, irradiated for 10 min). This distinction illustrates that ternary photocatalyst could generate a large number of photon-excited charge carriers, which are trapped by radical scavenger. The PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs can easily capture photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 11(d), (e) and (f), the significant decrease of the TEMPO signals under continuous irradiation, indicating an oxidization process happened between TEMPO and h+ [67]. Because different metals have different work functions, alloying Pd with Ag can change the surface electron density [68]. By simulated computation method, the PdAg alloys have higher energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) [69]. Compared with monometallic Pd, the PdAg bimetallic alloy particles have better catalytic activity due to the electronic and geometric effect. The introduction of element Ag can enhance the photocatalytic performance via weaken adsorption energy values of H atom on catalysts. Moreover, the Pd metal becomes the electron rich state where proton reduction reaction mainly proceeds due to the introduction of Ag [70]. By density functional theory simulations (DFT), Zhou et al. found that PdAg alloys make the d-band center lower due to the electron filling. The lower d-band center can provide the electrons to the antibonding orbital of Pd, and weaken the surface adsorption [71], which can enhance photogenerated electrons capturing ability and further improve hydrogen evolution activity. On the basis of all above results, the reasonable catalytic mechanism of the ternary CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 12 . When irradiated by visible light, the photocatalyst absorbs energy from photons and produces photo-induced electrons and holes. The electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 (-1.45 V vs. NHE) quickly transfer to the PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs as they have large electron capturing ability, and then transfer to the CB of CdS (-0.75 V vs. NHE). Ultimately, the electrons located in the CB of CdS involve reduce H2O to H2. In the electron transfer process, PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs behave like an electron-bridge between g-C3N4 and CdS, and therefore reduce the charge carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the holes in the VB of CdS (1.49 V vs. NHE) are transferred to the VB of g-C3N4 (1.34 V vs. NHE), and reduces the photo-corrosion phenomenon of cadmium sulfide. In sum, the PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs surface decoration and the heterojunction structure formed between g-C3N4 and CdS nanorods can not only accelerate the migration of photo-induced charge carrier, but also inhibit light corrosion phenomenon of cadmium sulfide, thus the CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 photocatalyst shows excellent hydrogen production performance."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, the ternary CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst is successfully synthesized via chemical deposition and hydrothermal method. When the content of CdS and PdAg are 40 wt% and 4 wt%, respectively, the hydrogen production activity can reach up to 3098.3 μmol g−1 h−1, and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) is 9.6% at 420 nm. The stability of the ternary composite photocatalyst has been proved by continuous four runs of photocatalytic reaction. By various characterization methods, the ternary CdS/PdAg/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst shows enhanced photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation efficiency and charge transfer efficiency. This work provides a feasible route for designing the highly efficient ternary composite photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production."
