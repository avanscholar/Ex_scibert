0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a clean oxidant and has attracted widespread concern. It is an oxidizer with high atomic efficiency and only generates by-product water [1], which is widely used in pulp bleaching, waste water treatment, disinfection and other industrial production, etc. [2] Commercial H2O2 is synthesized by the anthraquinone method, which requires a lot of energy and organic solvents. Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis is expected to become an alternative to the anthraquinone method and has attracted wide attention. TiO2 [3,4], ZnO [5,6], BiVO4 [7] and g-C3N4 [8–10] and other semiconductor photocatalyst could directly catalyze H2O2 formation from ORR under mild reaction conditions. Among these materials, TiO2 has been widely studied due to its low price and high stability. Recently, various strategies have been adopted to improve the performance of TiO2 in H2O2 synthesis, such as loading proper cocatalysts, forming surface passivation layer, or modulating the hydrophilcity of photocatalysts [2,4,11–14]. To further improve the H2O2 yield of TiO2, an important strategy is to design heterojunction structure so that the photogenerated electrons and holes could be effectively separated. So far, it is rarely reported that TiO2–based heterojunction for the application of efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Here, we successfully demonstrate an Au modified Bi2O3-TiO2 hybrid which enhances the charge separation for improved H2O2 production. The amount of H2O2 produced by Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 photocatalyst is 2.7 times that of Au/TiO2. In-situ electron spin resonance studies shows stepwise single-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 photocatalyst for the production of H2O2 where the characteristic intermediate OOH is observed in the photocatalytic reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Au modified Bi2O3-TiO2 (Au/Bi2O3-TiO2),"2.1 Preparation of Au modified Bi2O3-TiO2 (Au/Bi2O3-TiO2) To produce the Bi2O3-TiO2 heterojunction structure, anatase TiO2 powder (particle size of 5 nm, specific surface area of 280 m2/g, Shanghai Yifu Industrial Co., Ltd.) was used as a photocatalyst. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Guangdong Wengjiang Reagent Co., Ltd.) is used to modify TiO2 by molten salt method. Usually, 1.89 g anatase TiO2 and 0.11 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1% molar ratio of Bi:Ti) are mixed with 3.76 g LiCl (China Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and 4.23 g KCl (China Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The powder mixture was calcined at 773 K and kept at this temperature for 5 h. The mixture was then transferred to deionized water for grinding, centrifuged, washed and dried. 0.1 wt% of Au was supported on the photocatalyst by the previously reported deposition method [15]. Bi2O3-TiO2 and urea were added into a beaker filled with distilled water, ultrasonically dissolve the urea, and then add HAuCl4·4H2O. After reacting at 373 K for 4 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature by centrifuged, washed and dried to prepare Au/Bi2O3-TiO2. By changing the ratio of Bi to Ti, a series of Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts could be prepared."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Ma-2500, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) operated with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). UV-VIS spectra were recorded with Spectrum Lambda 750 S (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence analyzer (PerkinElmer Instruments Co., Ltd.) was used for fluorescence (PL) performance characterization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was performed using a scanning electron microscope model Scios03040702 (FEI Czech Republic Co., Ltd). In-situ ESR spectra were recorded on a JES-FA200 Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer. We use 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapped O2 reagent on different catalysts. ESP300E spectrometer was used to detect the ESR signal of free radicals captured by DMPO (Brucker, Switzerland). Usually, the catalyst (1 mg) is added to a mixture containing 1 ml of alcohol/water (4 wt%) and 0.125 mmol DMPO."
4,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity test A photocatalytic reaction kettle (200 mL) was used as the reactor. Sodium fluoride (0.1 M, Shentai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) was added as part of the reaction medium. 200 mg Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 was added to the reaction solution of ethanol (4 wt%) and deionized water. The suspension was dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 2 to 3 min. The suspension was poured into the reactor and then oxygen was bubbled for 30 min before light irradiation. Then, a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used as the light source. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out under stirring and cooling by water. The concentration of produced H2O2 was determined by DMP (2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, Guangdong Wengjiang Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) method [16]."
5,Results and discussion,"Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi: nTi = 1%) and Au/TiO2 (molten salt treatment) have similar XRD result and only anatase TiO2 could be identified (Fig. S1a). The diffraction peak of Bi was not observed. It is presumed that the content of Bi2O3 is too low and it is highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2, which makes it impossible to form obvious characteristic diffraction peaks [17,18]. Because Bi2O3 is a visible-light-active photocatalyst, the absorption edge of Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi:nTi = 1%) hybrid (Fig. S1b) is red-shifted to the visible region relative to pure TiO2 in the UV–Vis spectrum [19]. From the UV–vis spectrum, the band gaps of Bi2O3-TiO2 and TiO2 calculated by Tauc plot ((ahv)1/n = A(hv − Eg), n = 2) method are 3.05 eV and 3.12 eV, respectively (Fig. S4b). For Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi:nTi = 1%), a typical Au surface plasmon zone appears between 500 nm and 650 nm [20]. The element mapping of Ti, Bi and Au on the Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi:nTi = 1%) by the scanning electron microscope (Fig. S1c-f) showed that Bi and Au are evenly distributed on the surface of TiO2. The EDS analysis showed that the nBi:nTi was almost 1% which is consistent with material design in sample preparation (Fig. S2) [21,22]. The photocatalytic activity of H2O2 synthesis over Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 quantified using copper ion and DMP by spectrophotometry [16]. The standard curve indicates a good linear relationship between the absorbance and concentration of H2O2 (Fig. S3). With the increase of the Bi/Ti molar ratio, the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst gradually increased (Fig. 1a). When the Bi/Ti molar ratio was 1%, the photocatalytic activity of Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 hybrid reached the highest. Under the same conditions, the amount of H2O2 produced reached 11.2 mM with 12 h irradiation. In previous study, we reported the design of Au/SnO2-TiO2for the production of H2O2. In the optimized condition, the rate of photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 are higher than that of Au/SnO2-TiO2 (Fig. 1b). This is possibly because Bi2O3 has a smaller band gap than SnO2 and is more easily excited by visible light as shown by UV–Vis spectrum (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 2a, due to the waveband photoluminescence (PL) phenomenon of TiO2, a broad emission peak centered at ~400 nm can be observed. On the contrary, Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi:nTi = 1%) shows more quenched PL signals compared with TiO2 and Bi2O3-TiO2 [23], which indicates that the carrier recombination in TiO2 is inhibited. The effective separation of carriers between Au promoter and Bi2O3 from TiO2 is beneficial to enhance H2O2 production. Fig. 2b shows the band alignment of Bi2O3-TiO2 heterojunction. Under the illumination of UV–visible light, both Bi2O3 and TiO2 could be excited and the electrons and holes are respectively separated by Bi2O3 and TiO2. This inhibits the charge recombination and allows more electrons to reduce oxygen into H2O2. In general, H2O2 is could be produced through stepwise single-electron ORR (Eqs. (1)–(3)) or direct two-electron ORR (Eq. (4)) [24,25]. In order to further study the mechanism of photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, in-situ ESR tests were carried out to detect reaction intermediates using DMPO as trapping agent (Fig. 3 ). Except for pure TiO2, we have detected the DMPO-OOH radical signal composed of 6 characteristic peaks in other samples. Superoxide radical (HO2 ) is formed by the first combination of O2 in the photocatalytic reaction medium with electrons and protons. The generated HO2 will continue to react with an electron and a proton, eventually generating H2O2. This proves that in the process of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 from Au/Bi2O3-TiO2, the synthesis of H2O2 is achieved through stepwise single-electron ORR (Eqs. (2)–(3)). In addition, under the same test conditions, the signal intensity of Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 (nBi:nTi = 1%) is obviously stronger than that of Au/TiO2, which is possibly because that both Au and Bi2O3 promote the ORR process. (1) Semiconductor → e − + h + (2) e − + O 2 + H + → HO 2 ˙ (3) HO 2 ˙ + H + + e − → H 2 O 2 (4) 2e − + O 2 + 2H + → H 2 O 2"
6,Conclusion,"In short, we have designed Au/Bi2O3-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst for the direct production of H2O2 in aqueous solution. The formation of Bi2O3-TiO2 heterojunction structure significantly enhanced the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. The optimized performance was obtained when the Bi/Ti molar ratio is 1%. In-situ ESR study reveals that H2O2 is formed through a stepwise single electron ORR process over Au /Bi2O3-TiO2. Therefore, it is possible to use Au modified heterojunction photocatalyst to produce concentrated H2O2 for photocatalytic environmental purification or organic synthesis."
