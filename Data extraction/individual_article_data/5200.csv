0,Introduction,"Nanostructured vanadium pentoxide has received much attention due to its novel physical and chemical properties. Vanadium can exist in different valence states and consequently form various oxides including VO, V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 [1]. Among the diverse vanadium oxide compounds, vanadium pentoxide, V2O5, is thermodynamically most stable [2]. V2O5 nanostructres and V2O5-based composites have been exploited in a wide variety of applications such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors [3–9], removal of dye from water [10–13], conversion of solar energy via water splitting to hydrogen [10–12,14] and using as a sensor to detect NOX emission [15]. For example, vanadium pentoxide with their layered structures, high theoretical specific capacity and high electrochemical potential versus the Li/Li+ and tunable number of inserted lithium ions are favorite to be used as a cathode electrode by a variety of authors [3–6]. Supercapacitors are also environment friendly energy storage devices, and heavy metal are not found in their structures. On the other hand, supercapacitors are superior to traditional batteries because of their longer life time and higher power density. Many researchers have reported a high-specific-capacitance supercapacitor with nanostructured vanadium oxide electrode [7–9]. Additionally, photocatalysts such as Na2Ti3O7/V2O5/g-C3N4 [10], Na2Ti3O7 nanotube–V2O5 heterostructures [11], Bi2O3/V2O5 anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets [12] and ZnO-stearic acid/V2O5-hexadecylamine [13] have been used efficiently for the removal of dye from water. Another application of V2O5 as a photocatalyst is to dissociate water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, in the presence of sunlight. This method is a novel and developing technique for the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen, which is a valuable energy source with a high energy value. Recent studies showed an excellent catalytic activity of V2O5 based composites employed in this process [10–12,14]. Furthermore, V2O5 nanostructres have been used as NO x sensors [15]. V2O5 nanostructures have been produced through various methods such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, reverse micelle and electrochemical deposition methods. The hydrothermal technique is a green method [16]. Pan et al., in 2002 synthesized V2O5 nanowires in the range of 10–80 μm long and about 20–85 nm width. They used NH4VO3 as precursor, and HNO3 as the pH level adjuster of solution at 2–3. The products were mainly V2O5.0.3H2O with a small fraction of V2O5.xH2O (0.3 < x < 1.7) and V2O5 [17]. Li et al., in 2006 synthesized V2O5.xH2O nanobelts with the 10 μm long, 100–150 nm width and 20–30 nm thick. They used NH4VO3 as precursor, and H2SO4 was utilized to adjust the pH level of solution at 4 [18]. Zhou et al., in 2007 produced V2O5 long nanowires with 60–80 nm in diameter. They employed VOSO4.xH2O as precursor and KBrO3 as oxidizing agent. The pH level of solution was adjusted at 1–2 using HNO3 as acidizing agent [19]. Avansi Jr et al., in 2009 investigated the effect of temperature and time on V2O5 nanostructures morphology, depending on conditions. They produced different nanoribbons and nanowires sizes at different temperatures and times. V2O5 powder was exploited as precursor and H2O2 as oxidizing agent [20]. Yu et al., in 2012 synthesized four different nanostructures by controlling the reaction temperature and PVP volume (Poly vinyl pyrrolidone). Four different morphologies of the V2O5 nanostructure were nanowire, urchin-like, flowers-like and sphere-like nanostructures. The nanowires length and width were several micrometers and 100 nm, respectively. Urchin-like V2O5 nanostructures were composed of radially aligned nanorods with rectangular cross section. The thickness and width of the nanorods were estimated to be 60–100 nm and 40–60 nm, respectively. Flower-like nanostructures were assembled of petals. The diameter and thickness of the petals were about 1 μm and 60 nm, respectively. The sphere-like nanostructures with 2 μm width were composed of nanosheets. They used NH4VO3 as precursor, HNO3 to adjust the pH level of solution at 2, H2O2 as oxidizing agent and PVP (K-30) as capping agent [21]. Balamuralitharan et al., in 2013 produced V2O5 nanorodes in the width range of 10–50 nm. They utilized NH4VO3 as precursor and H2SO4 as acidizing agent [9]. Lee et al., in 2015 synthesized graphene decorated V2O5 nanobelts to increase the electric conductivity of V2O5 nanostructures. Firstly, they produced graphene oxide and then graphene decorated V2O5 nanobelts without using any capping or oxidizing agent. They used V2O5 as precursor [22]. Saravanakumar et al., in 2017 produced stacked V2O5 nanosheets using CTAB (Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide) as capping agent, H2O2 as oxidizing agent and V2O5 powder as precursor. Stacked V2O5 nanosheets were produced with the width of 0.56 nm [23]. Although, V2O5 nanospheres with their large specific surface areas and good stability have recently attracted more attention in detection of MUC1 as an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor [24], there are not any reported data about the hydrothermal synthesis of V2O5 particles with the morphology of nanosphere. However, F.Yang et al., in 2018 synthesized V2O5 particles with the morphology of sphere using the solvothermal method with the average size range of 400–500 nm [25]. On the other hand, one of the most important problems during the synthesis of V2O5 nanostructures is to stick the particles to each other, and form irregular aggregates. Indeed, this causes the total surface area of V2O5 nanostructures to reduce and consequently the surface free energy [26–31]. In this work, for the first time, V2O5 nanospheres were synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Additionally, the effect of different parameters including temperature, solution pH level and oxidizing agent/water volume ratio on the precipitate yield and morphology was elucidated. Another main goal of this investigation was to minimize the nanoparticles aggregation. To do so, SEM, FE-SEM, TEM images were performed. Three drying techniques including oven drying, vacuum drying and freeze drying methods were also employed to examine the extent of water removal efficiency and aggregation. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation that has been fulfilled and reported on drying steps in the hydrothermal synthesis of V2O5 nanostructures. Moreover, another worthy novelty of this research is to exploit the synthesized V2O5 nanospheres as catalyst for fast elimination of sour water rich in hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Results showed that the synthesized V2O5 nanospheres enable to convert efficiently the hydrogen sulfide into sulfur quickly."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) (99%, Merck/Germany) and poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K-25) powders (97%, Merck/Germany) were employed as precursor and capping agent, respectively. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (30 wt %, Kimia Exsire company/Iran) and nitric acid (HNO3) (65 vol %, Kimia Exsire company/Iran) were used as oxidizing and pH adjustment agents, respectively. Sour water was donated by Shiraz Oil Refinery Company with the H2S concentration of 1300 ppm and NH3 concentration of 7 ppm. Vanadium pentoxide (hereafter known as commercial V2O5 powder) used as a catalyst for H2S removal from sour water was purchased from Merck/Germany with a minimum purity of 99 wt %. Saturated iodine solution (99.8% Merck/Germany), chloridric acid (HCl 6 N) (Merck/Germany), and starch indicator (Merck/Germany) were used for sour water H2S concentration determination via iodometry titration method. NaOH (97% Merck/Germany), anhydrous sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7) (98% Merck/Germany), boric acid (99.5–100.5% Merck/Germany), methyl red (Merck), methylene blue (Merck), sulfuric acid (H2S04) (95–97% Merck/Germany) and mercuric iodide (HgI2) (99% Merck/Germany) were used for NH3 detection test. Potassium iodide (KI) (99.5% Merck/Germany) and sodium thiosulfate (97% Merck/Germany) were used for H2S and NH3 detection tests. Distilled and demineralized water were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/USA with a minimum purity of 99% and used for diluting a solution and washing precipitate, respectively. Ethyl alcohol (98%, Kimia Exsire company/Iran) was used for drying pretreatment and NH3 detection test. Nessler reagent: To prepare the Nessler reagent, 100 g of mercuric iodine was dissolved with 70 g of potassium iodide in a small amount of water. This mixture was slowly added with stirring to a cooled solution of 160 g NaOH in 500 mL of water. The mixture was then diluted to 1 L."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis NH4VO3 was dissolved in distilled water containing 30 wt % H2O2 to achieve 0.1 molal solution under vigorous magnetic stirring. Nitric acid (65 wt %) was then added dropwise to adjust the pH level of the solution according to Table 1 . When the solution under magnetic stirrer formed a clear pure orange color, PVP was added to the solution. The PVP/NH4VO3 mass ratio was about 0.3. Next, about 30 cc of the mixture was transferred to a 50 cc Teflon liner embedded in the reactor and heated up to the reaction temperatures of 160 °C, 180 °C or 200 °C for 24 h in an electric muffle furnace (Fan Azma Gostar (FG)/Iran). Afterwards, the resulting black precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethyl alcohol several times and then dried in an (Binder/USA) oven for 10 h. After that the resulting dried precipitates were calcined in the furnace at 500 °C for 1 h."
4,H2S removal procedure,"2.3 H2S removal procedure In order to investigate the possibility of removing H2S from sour water provided from Shiraz oil refinery by using V2O5 nanospheres, 15 cm3 of sour water with the initial concentration of 1300 ppm was firstly poured into a volumetric flask with a plastic stopper. Then, 0.1 g of V2O5 nanospheres powder was added to the flask before being mixed by a magnetic stirrer for 3 min. The resulting solution was then placed in a high-speed centrifuge to separate the particles from water and provided a clear water. Next, the concentration of H2S was measured according to the procedure elaborated below."
5,Determination of H2S concentration in sour water,"2.4 Determination of H2S concentration in sour water H2S concentration of sour water was determined according to the standard test method 376.1 [32], which is based on water and wastewater chemical analysis methods of United States Environmental Agency Protection. To do so, an appropriate amount of iodine solution was poured into the 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. It should be noted that the amount of iodine used was estimated to be greater than that needed to convert sulfide to sulfur theoretically. To create an acidic environment, 2 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid was added to the iodic solution. An amount of 200 mL sample was then added to the aqueous solution of iodine. If the color of the standard iodine solution disappears, more iodine should be needed to add. The sample was next titrated by a standard thiosulfate solution. After a few minutes, when the color of the solution changed from brown to light yellow, a few drops of starch solution were added to make the solution a deep blue. The titration continued until the blue color disappeared. Finally, the concentration of H2S (mg/L or ppm) was calculated according to the following formula: (1) H 2 S concentration = 400 ( A − B ) C where. A = mL of standard iodine solution B = mL of sodium thiosulfate solution C = mL of sample This method is suitable for the measurement of hydrogen sulfide in concentrations above 1 mg/L."
6,NH3 removal procedure,"2.5 NH3 removal procedure In order to investigate the possibility of removing NH3 from sour water provided from Shiraz oil refinery by V2O5 nanospheres, 15 cm3 of sour water with the initial concentration of 7 ppm was poured into a volumetric flask with a plastic stopper. An amount of 0.1 g of V2O5 nanospheres powder was then added to the flask and mixed by a magnetic stirrer for different times of 3, 10, 30 and 60 min. The resulting solution was then placed in a high-speed centrifuge to separate the particles from water and provide a clear water. The concentration of NH3 was measured according to the test method 350.2 extracted from Environmental Protection Agency water and wastewater chemical analysis explained below [32]."
7,Determination of NH3 concentration in sour water,"2.6 Determination of NH3 concentration in sour water To measure the concentration of NH3 in sour water, 500 mL of distilled water was firstly added to an 800 mL Kjeldahl flask. The residual chlorine in the sample was then removed by adding dechlorinating agent (sodium thiosulfate) equivalent to the chlorine residual. Next, the pH of 400 mL of the sample was adjusted at 9.5 by adding NaOH solution (1 N). An amount of 25 mL of the borate buffer was then added to the sample kept in an 800 mL Kjeldahl flask. After that, 300 mL of sample was distilled at the rate of 6–10 mL/min into 50 mL of boric acid (2%) contained in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Next, the distillate was diluted to 500 mL with distilled water and nesslerized (treating with Nessler reagent) an aliquot to obtain an approximate value of the ammonia-nitrogen concentration. Finally, three drops of the mixed indicator were added to the distillate, and the ammonia was titrated with the H2S04 (0.02 N), matching the end point against a blank containing the same volume of distilled water and H3B03 solution. The ammonia concentration (ppm) is calculated as: (2) NH 3 concentration = D* 0.28 * 1000 S where. D = mL of used H2S04 (0.02 N) S = mL of sample This method is suitable for the measurement of ammonia in concentrations above 1 mg/L."
8,Structural characterization and morphologies analysis,"2.7 Structural characterization and morphologies analysis The phase and structure identification of the precipitates were characterized by X-Ray diffractometry (XRD, Philips PW1880, Philips, Amsterdam, Netherland) using Cu Kα as radiation source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. To further investigate transformation from precursor to V2O5 nanoparticles, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used. Morphology of the synthesized V2O5 powder was characterized by Scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM, TESCAN-Vega3, Kohoutovice Czech Republic, Brno), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN-MIRA3, Kohoutovice Czech Republic, Brno) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips EM 208S, USA, Hillsboro). Finally, a Belsorp Mini instrument was employed to measure the specific surface area and pore size distribution through BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) and BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) methods."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 shows XRD results of the calcined precipitates. The main diffraction peaks of 15.440, 20.780, 210, 26.400 and 31.100 correspond to the characteristic diffraction of the (200), (001), (101), (201) and (110) planes of the vanadium pentoxide, respectively. The diffraction peaks match well with those of JCPDS card No. 41.1426 for orthorhombic V2O5 phase. This confirms that the synthesized powder of three different temperatures of 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C was V2O5 powder. 3.1.2 FT-RI analysis Fig. 2 a, b and c show a typical FT-IR spectrum of V2O5 [33,34] for the reaction temperatures of 160, 180 and 200 °C, respectively, in which the VO stretching bonds appear at 1007.25, 1005.61 and 1003.95 cm−1 while the peaks at 820.45, 824.62 and 806.70 cm−1 are assigned to the V–O–V stretching bonds. The V–O stretching bonds and the coupled vibrations between VO and V–O–V bonds can be found at 465.76, 426.60 and 410.84 cm−1. As can be seen in Fig. 1, there is a sensible difference between the intensity of peaks at a temperature of 200 °C and the two other temperatures (i.e., 160 °C and 180 °C). Also, Fig. 2 shows that the percentage values of transmittance at 200 °C are sensibly lower than those at the two other temperatures. Additionally, the wavenumbers corresponding to VO and V–O–V stretching bonds at the temperatures of 180 and 160 °C are significantly different from those at the temperature of 200 °C. Therefore, both characterization methods confirm each other. In fact, the intensity of peaks at the reaction temperature of 200 °C is lower than that at the temperatures of 160 °C and 180 °C. Additionally, Fig. 1 shows that there are extra peaks for diffraction angles lower than 20 deg for the reaction temperature of 200 °C.This may be occurred due to two reasons, firstly a high temperature of 200 °C causes the crystalline phase to change to amorphous phase. Secondly, impurity forms due to increasing the temperature to 200 °C, for example, the conversion of the decavanadate (reaction 6, section 3.2.1) into cyclic metavanadates upon extra heating according to the following reaction [35]. (3) 2 [ H 2 V 10 O 28 ] − 4 + 4 H 2 O → 5 [ V 4 O 12 ] − 4 + 12 H +"
11,Optimization of different operating conditions,"3.2 Optimization of different operating conditions Fifteen experiments were conducted in the hydrothermal method to elucidate the effect of different parameters including pH (2.6, 2.8, and 3), H2O2/H2O volume ratio (0.01, 0.02, and 0.03) and reaction temperature (160, 180 and 200 °C) upon the yield of precipitate using the hydrothermal method. Finally, all precipitates were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 10 h. 3.2.1 Effect of pH at different temperatures In the first series of the experiments, the influence of pH level was investigated upon the yield of precipitate while the H2O2/H2O volume ratio and temperature were held constant. Experiments were conducted at three different constant temperatures (160, 180 and 200 °C) with the constant H2O2/H2O volume ratio of 0.01 while the pH level of solution was varied from 2.6 to 3. It should be noted that the amount of precipitates in the pH level of below 2.6 (i.e., pH = 2.4, T = 180 °C) was found to be so low. Considering that the amount of precipitate yield turned out to be 15. Additionally, at the pH level of greater than 3 (i.e., pH = 3.2, T = 180 °C), the precipitate yield would be around 50. It means that the amount of precipitate yield didn't significantly change. All the results were summarized in one graph and shown in Fig. 3 . According to the figure, the precipitate yield increases with increasing pH, which leads to increasing the hydrolysis constant [21,35].The hydrothermal reactions, which lead to producing the wet precipitate, are shown below [21]: (4) N H 4 V O 3 + 4 H 2 O 2 → N H 4 [ V O ( O 2 ) 2 ] + 4 H 2 O + O 2 (5) N H 4 [ V O ( O 2 ) 2 ] + H + → H [ V O ( O 2 ) 2 ] + N H 4 + (6) 10 H [ V O ( O 2 ) 2 ] → [ H 2 V 10 O 28 ] − 4 + 4 H 2 O + 9 O 2 (7) [ H 2 V 10 O 28 ] − 4 + 4 N H 4 + → 5 V 2 O 5 + 3 H 2 O + 4 N H 3 Reactions no. 4 to 6 show the hydrothermal reactions, which take place in the reactor. Reaction no.7 introduces the calcination process, which is the final step of V2O5 nanosphere synthesis. Reactions no. 5 and 6 correspond to hydrolysis and dehydration reactions, respectively. Since a hydrolysis constant is an equilibrium constant for a reaction, increasing hydrolysis constant leads to increasing H [VO(O2)2], subsequently [H2V10O28]−4 as the precipitate of the hydrothermal reactions increases. 3.2.2 Effect of H2O2/H2O volume ratio at different reaction temperatures In the next series of designed experiments, the effect of H2O2/H2O volume ratio was investigated upon the yield of precipitate while the temperature and pH level were held constant. Experiments were conducted at three different reaction temperatures (160, 180 and 200 °C) with the constant pH level of 3 while the H2O2/H2O volume ratio was changed from 0.02 to 0.03. Results were shown in Fig. 4 . As can be seen, the precipitate yield decreases with increasing H2O2/H2O volume ratio. This phenomenon may be attributed to the hydrolysis degree. Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which water is used to breakdown a compound and relates to pH, and the oxidation or reduction potential of substance [36]. In fact, increasing H2O2/H2O volume ratio decreases hydrolysis constant, consequently, [H2V10O28]−4 production (yield) decreases. Generally, Figs. 3 and 4 show that the amount of precipitate decreases with increasing temperature, it seems that the precipitate redissolves at higher temperatures."
12,Drying techniques,"3.3 Drying techniques To examine the extent of aggregation, the reaction temperature of 180 °C was chosen. The precipitate was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 10 h and then calcined at 500 °C in a muffle furnace to obtain V2O5 powder. SEM image shown in Fig. 5 demonstrated the aggregation of NPs. Reasons of this aggregation could be rationalized by the following issues: 3.3.1 Thermodynamic stability Generally, the primary NPs assemble and form agglomerates due to London forces. Agglomerates tend to reduce the total surface area and consequently surface free energy by sticking to each other in order to stabilize thermodynamically. The innate tendency of particles with very small sizes for sticking to one another cannot be reduced easily. Because, the surface area and surface energy of nanostructured particles increase substantially, and, thus, the particles are thermodynamically unstable or metastable. One of the great challenges in fabrication and processing of NPs or nanostructures is to overcome the surface energy and to prevent the NPs or nanostructures from growth in size. One way to prevent the particles from sticking to each other is to create a space barrier by employing a capping agent. But in this study, despite the use of PVP, which acts as a capping agent, aggregation was observed (Fig. 5). 3.3.2 Sintering High temperatures during the drying and calcination stages cause the particles to deform and sinter. The intensity of sintering in the calcination stage is much higher due to the increase in temperature up to 500 °C. At this stage, the particles are in atomic contact with each other, and mass is transferred between the particles by surface diffusion, thereby aggregation is reinforced [30]. 3.3.3 Water bridging The capillary pressure of liquid water forms bridges between adjoining particles. The capillary force are so high that is comparable to cohesion forces at calcination step [30]. The water bridges connect the particles as depicted in Fig. 6 . The part of this figure shown with the letter b and the blue color represents the bridge and part a, which is shown in pink, represents the particles. As can be seen, the two sides of the bridge that connect to the particles are concaved form. Based on the Kelvin equation, the water vapor pressure at a concave curved surface is lower than that at a flat surface. Therefore, removing the water bridge is not easy. Since the alleviation of NPs or nanostructures aggregation by eliminating water bridges is easier than the two other effects, we focused to reduce water bridges’ effect by using the following procedures. 3.3.4 Employing low temperature in different drying techniques In order to reduce sintering during drying, low temperature techniques were employed. Firstly, a conventional drying technique in a heating oven (German, Binder: FD 115) was applied at the maximum temperature of 55 °C. Secondly, the vacuum drying method was employed. In this method, the precipitate was dried at ambient temperature by a wised laboratory instrument vacuum oven tray (WOV-30, Ireland).The third technique used for drying the precipitate was freeze drying method (German, LD Plus Alpha 2–4 freeze dryer). This method is performed at a very low Pressure and temperature (below the triple point) [37,38]. Freeze drying technique comprises three steps: freezing, primary drying and secondary drying. At the first step, the precipitate was freezed at −80 °C and at the second step, the pressure of freeze drying treatment was reduced to vacuum pressure, so water molecules sublimated. In fact, about 95% of water molecules are removed. Finally, in secondary drying, the temperature was increased up to −4 °C while the pressure was kept intact. Therefore, the remaining water molecules are eliminated based on the water phase diagram [37–39]. 3.3.5 Using extra drying treatments In order to reduce the precipitate moisture level as low as possible, some extra drying treatments were employed. In this investigation, oven drying technique was improved with the aid of two treatments applied prior to the main drying method. Initially, the precipitate was placed in alcohol for 7 days and then dried at room temperature for a week. Commonly, the moisture content of the precipitate may be bounded or unbounded [26]. Unbounded moisture (surface liquid) evaporates from solid surface at initial drying step [27]. At the end of this stage, surface liquid film totally evaporates and hot spots appear, so the remaining moisture transfers from the precipitate bulk to the surface by capillary forces. At the second drying step, some of the bounded moisture is eliminated. In fact, the moisture content decreases and falls down to the equilibrium moisture content of precipitate [27]. In the first pretreatment, water substitutes by a more volatile compound, which is ethyl alcohol in this work. In the second pretreatment (i.e. drying at room temperature for a week), almost total amount of liquid on surface is removed. So, further drying causes the moisture trapped in capillary tubes to vaporize [refer to section 3.3]. For the case of ethyl alcohol or water, the vapor pressure of moisture with a concave surface in a fine capillary tube is lower than that with a flat surface according to the Kelvin equation. In fact, the alcohol vapor pressure is approximately triple the water vapor pressure, and its surface tension is one third of water surface tension [40]. Hence, the alcohol's mass transfer rate would be higher than the water's mass transfer rate. In the other hand, capillary pressure causes linkage between the particles [27,41] to create, and if water replaces by alcohol, linkage among the particles would decrease and so reducing the extent of aggregation. Fig. 7 shows a typical example of the sample kept in ethyl alcohol for a week and then dried in an oven at 55 °C for 10 h without any additional treatment. Results revealed that not only alcohol substitution pretreatment is required to use for the reduction of aggregation, but also an additional treatment, which is drying at room temperature, has to be used for further drying to alleviate the aggregation problem. In vacuum drying method, vacuum pressure causes water to vaporize at a lower temperature (i.e., 25 °C), and consequently evaporation rate in this method is inherently higher than that in oven drying method. Fig. 8 shows that the application of this method (for 8 h at room temperature) without any additional treatment causes the particles to stick to one another. For this reason, a pretreatment (i.e. drying the precipitate at room temperature for 7 days) upon particles was required to be used before placing them in a vacuum oven. Additional treatment employed before any drying method was to spread the precipitate on a flat surface such as watch glass instead of falcon tube. Drying rate is inversely proportional to the square of precipitate thickness. So, decreasing the thickness leads to increasing drying rate [27,42]. Additionally, all dried precipitates have to be milled to break weak van der Waals bonds [29,30] and so lessening the aggregation of particles to each other during the calcination process. The last step of treatment for all the mentioned drying methods was to sonicate the final product by an ultrasonic probe (SONOPULS HD-4200, Germany) in order to segregate the nanoparticles. Although employing the ultrasonic probe leads to segregating NPs, using an ultrasonic bath instead of an ultrasonic probe at the same condition causes the nanosphere aggregates to persist as can be seen in Fig. 9 . To examine the efficiency of each drying technique with respect to aggregation, fifteen experiments were conducted. The designed experiments are shown in Table 2 . Sample code denotes the reaction temperature and the drying technique. For example according to Table 2, sample code of 183 points out to the reaction temperature of 180 °C and oven drying temperature of 50 °C. Typically, FESEM images of sample codes 181 and 182 are shown in Fig. 10 a and b , respectively, and SEM image of sample code 185 is shown in Fig. 10c. Since there is a minimum amount of water bridges for aggregation, so that the system would be in equilibrium state, it is impossible to vanish the occurrence of aggregation. However, the extent of aggregation could be minimized by using extra drying treatments. Results among the implemented methods used in this research show that the order of aggregation intensity is: freeze drying < oven drying < vacuum drying In spite of the occurrence of vacuum drying in low pressures causing water molecules to evaporate easily, the amount of aggregation in this method was remarkable because of mechanical damage, shrinkage and deformation of the precipitate remained under vacuum conditions over a long period of time. Additionally, the size range of the synthesized NPs changed with applying different methods evaluated in this research. The order of particle size distribution of the synthesized NPs based on different drying techniques is: oven drying < freeze drying < vacuum drying It should be noted that the above order is false, if the oven drying temperature is set below 55 °C. As the drying temperatures was reduced to 50 or 45 °C, the drying rate decreased and the size of the NPs would be larger, and consequently the extent of aggregation increased. Typically, FESEM and SEM images of the V2O5 powder synthesized hydrothermally at the reaction temperature of 180 °C and then dried via vacuum, oven or freeze dying are shown in Fig. 10a and b and c, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the sensible particles aggregation observed in Fig. 10a is related to the method used for drying (i.e., vacuum drying). Fig. 10a shows that the size of NPs is sensibly higher than that observed in Fig. 10b and c. So, according to these figures, a narrow particle size distribution is produced when the precipitate is dried in an oven at 55 °C for the reaction temperature of 180 °C (see Fig. 10b). In this condition, the particle size distribution was between 12 and 25 nm. Fig. 10 c shows the NPs size distribution of synthesized V2O5 powder when the reaction temperature was set at 180 °C, and the precipitate was dried in a freeze dryer. Image J (Fiji 1.46) software was employed to determine the particle size distribution of sample code 185, and 230 NPs with the morphology of nanosphere were counted to obtain the average particle size. The majority of nanospheres (about 80%) was in the size range of 30–41 nm. The most frequency (Fig. 11 ) was allocated to the diameter of 38 nm, and the average diameter of nanosphere was 37 nm. The following factors may be conducive to produce V2O5 nanospheres: 1-Using PVP K-25 compound as caping agent in synthesizing V2O5. 2-Adjusting the effective parameters at certain degrees (optimum values) such as volume ratio of H2O2/H2O and pH level. For instance, increasing the volume ratio of H2O2/H2O from 0.01 to 0.03 (cc/cc) caused the nanoparticles to change from spherical to rod shape, as shown in Fig. 12 . Size distribution of spherical nanoparticles is the result of Ostwald ripening, since the larger particles are thermodynamically more stable than smaller ones and this process spontaneously occurs [43]. Additionally, in oven drying technique a decrease in drying temperature may lead to a decrease in vaporization rate, so the amount of moisture elimination decreases. Also in vacuum drying method, drying time and temperature influence the water removal efficiency. The remained water molecules trapped in pores can make bridges between the nanospheres and so producing larger nanospheres. On the other hand, higher temperatures in oven drying may cause nanospheres to sinter to each other and to produce larger nanospheres, so the precipitate should be dried in an oven at optimum temperature. For this reason in this work, the temperature of oven drying didn't exceed 55 °C."
13,BET and BJH analysis,"3.4 BET and BJH analysis Surface areas of the synthesized V2O5 nanoshere powder were measured by BET method via N2 sorption isotherms. All samples were dried by the freeze drying technique. The isotherms of V2O5 nanospheres are displayed in Fig. 13 a–c at different reaction temperatures (a: 160 °C, b: 180 °C and c: 200 °C). The inset plot of each diagram shows pore size distribution. The BET surface areas of the V2O5 nanospheres for the reaction temperatures of 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C are 125.6 m2/g, 207.07 m2/g and 206.86 m2/g, respectively, which are much higher than those reported by other researchers. The reported BET of V2O5 powder (commercial) used in this work was 24 m2/g. Additionally, BET values of the nanosheet and microflower V2O5 particles synthesized hydrothermally were reported 56.4 and 61.5 m2/g, respectively in the literature [34]. Fig. 13a–c revealed that the adsorption isotherms are in accordance with type Ⅱ of IUPAC classification. As seen in these figures, the adsorption/desorption isotherms are very close to each other. The hysteresis loop verifies that the pores are cylindrical type [44]. Pore size distribution curves confirm that the synthesized V2O5 powder composed of mesopores and micropores, but micropores are dominate."
14,The effectiveness of V2O5 nanospheres in H2S removal from sour water,"3.5 The effectiveness of V2O5 nanospheres in H2S removal from sour water Commonly, sour water is the wastewater that is mainly produced from atmospheric and vacuum columns of oil refineries. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are the main undesirable components of sour water that need to be removed before being reused elsewhere in the plant such as oil desalters. Generally, removal of these components is performed by stripping towers where heat, in the form of steam, is applied. The ideal pH value for H2S stripping is below 5; alternatively, efficient ammonia stripping requires a pH level of above 10. Although the most favorable strategy for sour water stripping is employing two separate towers, one for removing hydrogen sulfide and the other for removing ammonia. In some refineries, such as Shiraz oil refinery, the amount of ammonia is not high and the main problem is hydrogen sulfide, so the pH level of sour water is set in the appropriate range to remove hydrogen sulfide, which is 5–6. Some fluctuations in operating conditions can cause the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the sour water to increase and thus the sour water cannot be reused anywhere. So, it is necessary to have an auxiliary or alternative technology for removing hydrogen sulfide from sour water with a lower energy consumption as compared to steam injection into a stripping column. The FT-RI analysis of the V2O5 powder was performed after the H2S removal treatment from sour water (see Fig. 14 ). Compared to V2O5 FT-RI result, the additional peaks of 3398, 2352 and 2318 cm −1 are specific to sulfur and also the deeper peaks of 1614, 1400, 1004, 786 and 500 cm −1 on the right side of graph are related to sulfur [39]. Therefore, it seems that sulfur forms as a result of the following chemical reaction [reaction 8] in the presence of V2O5 as a catalyst. (8) H 2 S ( g ) + v 2 o 5 ( s ) → H 2 ( g ) + S − v 2 o 5 ( s ) Fig. 15 shows the effect of using two different catalysts (commercial V2O5 catalyst with the morphology of sheet with micro width and the synthesized V2O5 catalyst used in this work with the morphology of nanosphere) in eliminating H2S from sour water. As can be seen, the conversion rate of V2O5 nanospheres in comparison to commercial V2O5 powder increased significantly, especially in the early 30 s. This is due to the higher BET of nanospheres compared to the commercial powder. Additionally, the kinetics of H2S reaction was determined as follows: (9) r = − d C d t = k C a where k is the apparent rate constant and C is the H2S concentration of sour water. Based on the experiments, the following values were obtained under a reaction temperature of 298 K: k = 0.018 and a is approximately 1. Therefore, the reaction rate can be described as a pseudo-first-order reaction: (10) r = − d C d t = k C As C = C 0 ( 1 − X ) , the equation will be written as: l n ( 1 − X ) = − k t where X is the conversion of H2S and C0 is the initial concentration of H2S. Figs. 16 and 17 show the plotting of l n ( 1 − X ) versus reaction time for commercial V2O5 powder and V2O5 nanospheres, respectively, and the kinetic reaction can be described as a pseudo-first-order. The effect of stirring rate on H2S conversion is shown in Fig. 18 . When the stirring rate was 300 rpm, the reaction rate was slow and H2S conversion was only about 30% at 120 s. Increasing stirring rate up to 500 rpm caused the reaction rate to enhance. In fact, volumetric overall mass transfer coefficient increases with an increase in agitation speed. Conversion rates of over 90% were obtained at 120 s. However, beyond this contact time, the reaction rate showed no further increase with increasing stirring. The possibility of removing NH3 from sour water provided from Shiraz oil refinery by V2O5 nanospheres was investigated. The initial H2S and NH3 concentrations were 1300 and 7 ppm, respectively. A method similar to H2S removal by nanospheres was employed. Different contact times (i.e., 3, 10, 30 and 60 min) were conducted in NH3 removal from sour water to ensure enough time for the conversion of reactants into products. Finally, the NH3 concentrations was measured according to the procedure described in section 2.6. Results showed that the ammonia concentration in water had no change."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, V2O5 spherical nanoparticles were successfully fabricated through PVP assisted hydrothermal method at three reaction temperatures of 160, 180 and 200 °C. Experimental results revealed that decreasing the volume ratio of H2O2/H2O and reaction temperature, as well as increasing pH level cause more precipitate to deposit. Fifteen experiments were designed for the determination of an efficient drying procedure with respect to the NPs aggregation at minimum level. Minimum aggregation was obtained in the freeze drying technique. FESEM images confirmed that employing auxiliary treatments caused the drying efficiency of both oven and vacuum drying techniques to improve. Specially, employing oven drying method leads to producing smallest NPs with low aggregation extent. It was found that using freeze drying technique at the reaction temperature of 180 °C, the majority of nanospheres was in the size range of 30–41 nm. The synthesized V2O5 powder at the three mentioned reaction temperatures exhibited great specific surface areas (BET) in the range of 126–207 m2/g depending on the hydrothermal reaction temperature. Additionally, V2O5 nanospheres as catalyst with a specific area of 207.07 m2/g efficiently eliminated H2S from sour water very fast with a first order reaction kinetic especially at early minutes. Moreover, V2O5 nanospheres are superior to V2O5 powder in eliminating H2S from sour water."
