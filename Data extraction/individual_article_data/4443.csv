0,Introduction,"In the modern society, energy is one of the most significant building blocks. The “availability” and “reliability” of energy are complex processes, which can directly affect the human health and environment [1]. The terms “acid rain”, “radioactive waste”, and “global warming” are close to us, which are related to our “production” and “use” of energy. Energy, environment, and economy developments are closely linked [2]. The global demand of energy has increased dramatically in the past 50 years [3–12]. The “end uses of energy” are generally classified into four sectors: transportation, industrial, residential, and commercial. The sources of energy can be renewable or nonrenewable (primary energy). Based on the principle of these two sources, and many drawbacks of nonrenewable energy sources, a shift from nonrenewable to renewable energy has begun in the last few decades. However, there are several drawbacks of renewable energy resources, such as higher upfront cost, intermittency, geographic limitations and so on. Therefore, other alternative for use in the sectors are urgently required. Hydrogen is a secondary energy source, which can produce using a number of processes such as thermochemical, electrolytic, water splitting, and biological [13]. One of the crucial obstacle in realizing hydrogen economy is “hydrogen storage” [14]. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas under high pressure, or absorbed/adsorbed by solid-state materials. The storage of hydrogen in/on solid-state materials is more efficient as compared to the conventional compressed gas. Solid-state materials in hydrogen storage can be carbon materials [15], mixed metal oxides [16], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [17], hydrides [18], composites [19], etc. Generally, the properties of the applied electrode material as a host for hydrogen storage, such as chemical composition, porous structure, crystallinity, and catalytic features, can strongly influence the hydrogen storage capacity of the system. Among these absorbents, nanoscaled metal-oxides (MOs), and mixed metal oxides (MMOs) - due to the unique structural, physical and chemical properties - have been achieved a great interest in hydrogen storage system [20]. In theory, the atoms on the surface of nanomaterials contain a series of active hanging bands, which tend to bind with surrounding molecules to decrease the surface energy. In addition, the defects in the structure can enhance the hydrogen storage performance of MMOs [21]. Nevertheless, a low specific surface area and weak electron conductivity of these materials still demonstrate unsatisfactory hydrogen storage properties. Constructing an appropriate nanostructure is one of the main challenges in production of highly effective materials in this field. Nanomaterials can enlarge active surface area and shorten transport channels for ions or electrons. In recent years, molybdate-based mixed oxides with unique catalytic activity have been achieved great interest in numerous applications such as supercapacitors, hydrogen storage and lithium-ion batteries [22]. The double molybdate compounds with the general formula MR2(MoO4)4 (M=bivalent metal cations and R= trivalent rare earth ions) are one of the most important families of molybdate based complex metal oxides with numerous applications in light-emitting diode, laser, solar cell, etc. [23, 24]. In MMOs, the mechanism of hydrogen sorption can be proposed through the insertion of hydrogen protons into the vacancies and formation of OH− ion defects [25]. It has been proven that the presence of redox species can enhance the electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity, for example reduction of ZrIV → ZrIII and CeIV → CeIII in a hydrogen storage Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 nanopowders [26], and in Ni/MH batteries of BaCe0.95Nd0.05O3-δ [27]. So far, solid-state reaction and sol-gel method have been used in order to synthesize double molybdates. Pechini technique is a simple and appropriate synthesis procedure, which yields oxides with controlled shape and size, high crystallinity, good chemical homogeneity and suitable porosity. Doping with rare-earth ions (RE) is a novel technique, which can create vacancies, decrease the grain size, and crystallinity of the main texture. In addition, the RE elements can improve electronic conductivity and reaction kinetics [28,29]. In the current study, the fabrication of SrCe2-x-y(MoO4)4: xHo/yYb nanostructures via a simple Pechini route is reported. In addition, the influence of holmium (Ho) and ytterbium (Yb) on the chemical properties, morphology, crystallinity and porosity of the samples are investigated. Herein, an attempt has been developed to present, for the first time, a) the electrochemical hydrogen storage properties of double molybdate SrCe2(MoO4)4, and b) the effect of doping on hydrogen storage performance."
1,Experimental study,
2,Materials and method,"2.1 Materials and method All chemical reagents (Table 1 ) were purchased in analytical grade from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. In this study, the SrCe2(MoO4)4 (blank sample) and various SrCe2(MoO4)4:Ho3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles were synthesized via Pechini method. In this procedure, an admixture of metal nitrates was prepared by dissolution of strontium nitrate, cerium nitrate, holmium nitrate, and ytterbium nitrate in de-ionized water with the molar ratio of Sr2+/Ce3+/Ho3+/Yb3+ equal to 1:2:0:0, 1:1.9:0.1:0, 1:1.6:0.1:0.3, and 1:1.5:0.1:0.4 under magnetic stirring and continuous heating. After complete dissolution of cationic salts, citric acid (C6H8O7) as a chelating agent with the ratio of metals:citric acid = 1:3 was added into the primary solution. Subsequently, the aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate was added into the above container under continuous stirring at 80 °C. The pH value of the mixed solution was adjusted to be around 7–8 by adding a dilute solution of triethylenetetramine. Appropriate amount of propane 1,2-diol, as an esterification agent, was added into the above solution. In the next step, the obtained highly transparent-yellowish solution was further heated and stirred to produce a viscose solution, where turned into a porous solid mass after overnight drying at 100 °C. Eventually, various RE-doped SrCe2(MoO4)4 samples were calcined at 800 °C for 4 h. Table 2 presents the formulation ingredients of the blank and doped samples. The effects of the RE-ions have been discussed in order to achieve the condition for producing the sample with optimal purity, morphology, size as well as excellent discharge capacity."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Herein, the crystal-phase formation and composition of the samples were analyzed using an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips - Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation; λ=0.15418 nm; scanning range 10<2θ<80) and spectroscopic analyzers including a fourier transform infrared (FTIR; Nicolet Magna-550 spectrophotometer in KBr pellets ranging from 4000-400 cm−1), and a Laser Raman microspectrometer (TakRam APUS+, Laser Power 100 mW, Wavelength = 532 nm). The morphology of the samples was captured using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, MIRA3 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips CM30). The physical properties of the samples were recorded using an ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-Vis-DRS, Shimadzu – UV-2550, Japan), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller–Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BET-BJH) (which applied at −196 °C, Tristar 3000, Micromeritics). Finally, the electrochemical performance of the samples was measured primarily using a cyclic voltammogram (CV-using K3(Fe(CN)6)/K4(Fe(CN)6) in the 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, scan rate of 0.1 V−1) and eventually by using a chronopotentiometer (GC-2550TG, Teif Gostar Faraz Company-Iran, in a 6M KOH solution and ±1 mA constant current). The later was used in order to study the hydrogen storage property of the samples, in a standard three-electrode setup. In this electrochemical cell, platinum (Pt) was used as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a coated-copper sheet (surface area ~ 1 × 1 cm2) as a working electrode. The working electrode was fabricated by coating the porous copper sheet using a thin layer of as-synthesis samples. Primarily, the MMOs (samples) were dispersed in absolute alcohol (ethanol) and mixed thoroughly in order to obtain a uniform dispersion. Finally, using a dropper, the homogenous dispersion was dropped on the surface of copper substrate and dried at 80 °C, without any binder to achieve a thin layer."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structural analysis,"3.1 Structural analysis The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1 . It is noteworthy that the samples consist of nearly similar phase structure. The major diffractograms are located at 28.14°, 30.23°, 33.68°, 45.79°, 48.29°, 52.26°, 56.73°, and 57.94° in diffracting lattice planes of (1 0 1), (0 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 3), (2 1 1), and (2 0 2), respectively. These diffractions are in good agreement with the literature reported by Surjith et al. [30]. They expressed the structural, and microwave dielectric properties of ACe2(MoO4)4 (A = Ba, Sr and Ca), and deduced that the ionic radii of alkaline earth ions can affect crystal structure. Since the crystal phase of the SrCe2(MoO4)4 is unknown, so far no JCPDS are matched, however, it is theoretically inferred that the SrCe2(MoO4)4 can crystallize in a tetragonal structure, while its analogous i.e. BaCe2(MoO4)4 in a monoclinic phase [20]. Referred to the observations and literature, it can be inferred that all diffraction peaks are arisen to the tetragonal crystal phase of strontium cerium molybdate. The holmium and ytterbium in the SrCe2(MoO4)4 structure appear with additional weak peaks with new shape, which assigned to the formation of new phases, such as two diffractions at 2θ = 41.75° and 44.51°. In addition, the intensity ratios of the (1 0 1) to (2 0 2) planes are decreased in the doped samples. Displacement of the major peaks in the XRD patterns confirm the alteration in structural phase of the doped samples [31]. The average crystallite sizes (Dave .) of the samples were calculated using Debye–Scherrer equation [26]. The results are tabulated in Table 2. The doped-samples containing Ho and Yb have the smallest crystallite sizes (~29 nm) as compared to other samples. The elemental analysis confirms the pure composition of the selected samples (Fig. 2 ). As expected from XRD patterns, the EDX spectrum of SrCe2(MoO4)4 contains only strontium (Sr), cerium (Ce), molybdenum (Mo), and oxygen (O). Similarly, the EDX spectrum of SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles shows the existence of the major elements (Sr, Ce, Mo, O), and add-on elements i.e. Ho and Yb. The surface morphologies of the samples were observed in order to confirm the nanosized formation of the particles (Fig. 3 ). The blank sample (Fig. 3a) shows a complex morphology composed of aggregated particles. A series of fine particles (mostly spherical) are formed in the samples containing Ho and Yb (Fig. 3b and c). However, in SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 (Fig. 3c), the particles are comparatively denser, with narrow distribution of the particles, and homogeneous texture. The TEM images of the selected sample (in two magnifications) are presented in Fig. 3e. In these micrographs, the lattice fringes and contrast demonstrate a crystalline texture of the particles. In this morphology, the particles are small, with average particle-longitude of 10–40 nm (Fig. 3f). In this histogram, the majority of the particles are in the range of 15 to 25 nm. The FTIR and Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 4 . The FTIR spectra of the samples (Fig. 4a) show a series of successive vibration frequencies located in two areas, above and below 1000 cm−1. Above 1000 cm−1, there are two vibration frequencies at around 3430 and 1630 cm−1, which assigned to the stretching vibration frequencies of –OH group. All metal-oxygen bonds arise below 1000 cm−1; three successive bands at around 918, 846, and 712 cm−1, and an absorption frequency at around 412 cm−1. The former is assigned to the F2(ν3) antisymmetric of O–Mo–O band, and the latter corresponds to the vibration frequency of F2(ν4) bending mode of the O–Mo–O group [24]. In addition, a band at around 412 cm−1 can be also assigned to the vibrational frequencies of Ce–O [26]. The Raman spectra of the samples are presented in Fig. 4b. In the blank sample (the sample without Ho or/and Yb), two successive peaks can be observed at around 300 and 900 cm−1. This few numbers of Raman peaks indicate a high symmetry of SrCe2(MoO4)4 [30]. In addition, a high intensity and well-resolved appearance of the Raman peaks reveals the high crystallinity of the samples. In the samples containing Ho and Yb ions, the Raman spectra contain a series of major and minor peaks, most probably due to the formation of disordered-SrCe2(MoO4)4 lattice structure of Ho3+ and Yb3+. The Raman spectra of the SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 and SrCe1.5(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.4, contain less number of peaks, ascribing a higher symmetry of the samples. The bands corresponding to the ν2 (centered at around 300 cm−1), and ν4 (centered at around 420 cm−1) bending modes of the MoO4 groups can be observed in this wavenumber range."
6,Physical properties,"3.2 Physical properties The band gap energy (Eg ) of the samples was obtained from UV-DRS (Fig. 5 ) and measured by Tauc plot Eq. (1); (αhϑ)n = A(hϑ - Eg) (1); where hϑ, α, and A are photon energy, absorption coefficient, and band tailing parameter constant, respectively, and n is either 2 for a direct transition or 1/2 for an indirect transition. The direct band gap energy of the samples is tabulated in Table 2. In order to confirm the band gap energies obtained by Tauc plots, Eq. (2); λ = 1240/Eg (2); was used based on the maximum wavenumber of the UV-DR spectrum. In this equation, λ is wavenumber (nm) and Eg is band gap energy (eV). These band gap energies are also presented in Table 2. The band gaps of the samples containing Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions are slightly lower than blank sample, most probably due to the electronegativity values, which can affect covalent properties of respective crystal lattice. The electronic structures of solids (based on electrons and ions interactions) are in correlation with their physical properties like electric conductivity, magnetism, and optical effects [32]. Therefore, the electronic activities of the samples can be further reflected into the hydrogen storage performances, where basically semiconductors are electrically conductive with the band gap energy (i.e. the differentiation between the valence band (VB) energy and conduction band (CB) separation) of 0.2–4 eV [33,34]. On the other hand, the band gap energy can be influenced by particle size [35]. An uneven morphology of the nanosized-MMOs semiconductors facilitates absorption/desorption of hydrogen [36,37]. Since hydrogen is electrically active, the H+ and H− can interact with active anions or cations. In this mechanism, the hydrogen absorption is thermodynamically more favorable based on splitting of the H2 → 2H [38]. In solid-state hydrogen storage process, the porosity of host (here MMOs) is one of the most explicit factors governing the hydrogen storage efficiency. BET-BJH analyses were used to provide precise specific surface area, pore area and specific pore volume evaluation of the blank and doped-samples by nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The BET profiles of the samples (Fig. 6 ) indicates that all the samples (blank and doped-samples) follow the type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop, in accordance to IUPAC classification. The specific surface area of the samples support our prediction as SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1Yb0.3> SrCe1.5(MoO4)4:Ho0.1Yb0.4 > SrCe1.9(MoO4)4:Ho0.1 > SrCe2(MoO4)4 (Table 3 ). Similar trends can be almost observed for other BET-BJH results; for example the total pore volume of the SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1Yb0.3 is around 0.0379 (cm3.g−1), with the mean pore size of around 38 nm."
7,Electrochemical properties and hydrogen storage profiles,"3.3 Electrochemical properties and hydrogen storage profiles The reaction/interaction profile of hydrogen with intermetallic compounds can occur in three ways; formation of hydride phases, solid solution, or decomposition, where governs by temperature, pressure, and properties of the intermetallic compound [39]. The hydrogen storage MMO is capable of electrochemically charging and discharging hydrogen in alkaline aqueous media. The SrCe2(MoO4)4, SrCe1.9(MoO4)4:Ho0.1, SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3, and SrCe1.5(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.4 nanoparticles were used as preferred exemplification hosts in an electrochemical hydrogen storage system. Applying an electrical potential across the cell, the working electrode materials (M) is charged by the electrochemical absorption of hydrogen and the electrochemical evolution of hydroxyl ion Eq. (3); M + H2O + e− → M – H + HO− (3), and discharged in order to form water and electron Eq. (4): M – H + −OH → M + H2O + e− (4) [30]. The CV cycles of the samples (Fig. 7 ) reveal that the samples have one reduction peak and one broad oxidation peak. The anodic peak currents (Ipa ) of the samples grow up to ~ 44 μA (for SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3). The lowest intensity of the anodic peak current is related to the blank sample (the sample without Ho and Yb) to be around 26 μA. Similarly, an intense cathodic peak current can be observed for the SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles at around −45 μA. The details of the CV results are collected in Table 4 . The unity of separation (anodic to cathodic) is refered to the reversible electron transfer character of the samples [17]. The CV profile support our primary prediction on hydrogen storage performance of the SrCe2-x-y(MoO4)4: xHo/yYb (x = 0.1, y = 0, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles. The hydrogen storage performance of the samples with various concentrations of Ho3+ and Yb3+ were analyzed using a chronopotentiometer and the results are presented in Fig. 8 (a–d). Twenty sequences of successive discharging of the samples in early observations indicate the tendency of the nanoscaled complex metal oxides (with the general formulation of Sr-Ce-Mo:Ho-Yb) for hydrogen sorption (Table 4). As predicted from CV analysis, the highest discharge capacity was obtained for the doped-sample with Ho/Yb = 0.1/0.3, where the maximum discharge capacity was 3250 mAh/g (3.2 wt%). In this sample, the discharge capacity is enhanced from 400 to 3250 mAh/g, which is due to the stepwise activation of working electrode materials. Since the reaction profile is improved, the electrolyte penetrates and fills the interior of the SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 and its pore. For hydrogen sorption of MMOs, the physical absorption mechanism has been accepted (proposed), however, the exact mechanism(s) are still remained unknown. High specific surface area, presence of active metal cations, and spillover are the main factors that govern hydrogen sorption performance of MMOs [26]. In spillover, the adsorbed hydrogen on nanoparticles migrates/transfers from one surface (nanoparticles) to another (surface of support) [40,41]. Here, the hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed and dissociated by catalysts (metal, metal oxides, mixed metal oxides, etc.). Hydrogen spillover is characterized by three major steps; a) dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H2 → 2H), b) migration from the catalyst to the new substrate, c) diffusion [42]. Karim et al. [43] reported the spillover phenomenon in several pairs of metal oxides such as iron oxide/titanium oxide, and iron oxide/aluminium oxide. They expressed about ten times faster hydrogen spillover on titanium oxide as compared to aluminium oxide, due to the structural rigidity and also side interactions of coordinated aluminium centers in aluminium oxide. In the case of MMOs, the hydrogen show preference for metal-building units, and the hydrogen adsorption is found consistent with general mechanism reported in literature [26]. In addition to this proposed mechanism, the redox reaction can also influence the hydrogen storage [44]. Moreover, the presence of doped species (here Ho3+ and Yb3+) with redox abilities in the framework can also occupied by hydrogen [15]. The charging and discharging efficiency are important in storage technologies. It is a ratio of the discharge/charge capacities. The insets of Fig. 8 show the 20th charge capacities of the samples. The response of the working electrode containing SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles shows highest discharge/charge efficiency of around 60%, which can be an ideal energy storage system, and an alternative with some mature batteries. Theoretically, an excellent storage system works with a charge-discharge efficiency of one, which is impossible in reality due to the self-discharge and side reactions."
8,Conclusions,"Energy storage technologies making use of hydrogen adsorption in/on inorganic materials such as MMOs are promising towards efficient hydrogen storage. In this manuscript, a nanosized MMO was synthesized with general formula of SrCe2(MoO4)4 with pure lattice structure via a Pechini method. This sample was served as host for production of doped-nanoparticles containing Ho3+ and Yb3+. The structural analysis of the samples were confirmed the formation of crystal lattice of SrCe2(MoO4)4 and SrCe1.9-x(MoO4)4:Ho0.1 3+/Ybx 3+ nanostructures, with average crystallite size of around 30 ± 3 nm, and metal-oxygen (M-O) bands (at vibrational frequencies less than 1000 cm−1). In addition, the morphological observations were clarified the nanoscales formation of the samples, where a narrow distribution of the particles was observed in SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements were confirmed slightly better electrochemical response of the SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles. This primary information was served to study the electrochemical hydrogen storage properties of the sample. As predicated, the maximum discharge capacity, and discharge/charge efficiency were observed on electrode response of SrCe1.6(MoO4)4:Ho0.1/Yb0.3 nanoparticles (max discharge capacity: 3250 mAh/g, efficiency: 60%). Hence, it can be deduced that the SrCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures containing Ho3+ and Yb3+ can be used as a potential host for hydrogen sorption, however, some additional works are still required in order to fulfill the actual requirements for real application of this class of materials."
