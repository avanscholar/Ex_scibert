0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic benzyl alcohol (BzOH) oxidation over semiconductors materials [1–4], such as TiO2 [5–8], CeO2 [9,10], Bi4O5Br2 [11], C3N4 [12], H2Ti3O7 [13] and CdS [1] semiconductors, is one of efficient method to produce benzaldehyde (BzH). Especially, TiO2 semiconductor has received a lot of attention among the semiconductors materials [14–16], due to its high photocatalytic performance and stability [17–21], which is strongly depended on its crystal structure [5]. Such as, Li, et al. found high BzH selectivity can be obtained over rutile TiO2 under visible-light irradiation [22]. Brookite TiO2 gave 56 % selectivity of aldehyde, 3 times higher than that with anatase/rutile mixed phases [23]. Besides, brookite, anatase and rutile, TiO2(B) is also typical crystallographic forms of TiO2, which was discovered by Marchand et al. [24]. TiO2(B) as photocatalysts has wide applications in photodegradation of methyl orange [25], photocatalytic hydrogen production [26] and so on [27]. Usually, high photocatalytic performance of BzOH oxidation over TiO2 was only obtained under the solvent of acetonitrile [7,28], toluene [6], H2O [29] or trifluorotoluene [3]. Actually, it is more environmentally friendly for BzOH oxidation under the solvent-free condition, avoiding toxic and harmful solvents. However, there is very poor photocatalytic activity over bare TiO2 under the solvent-free condition. Only 0.2 % of BzOH conversion was obtained for TiO2(P25) under the solvent-free condition at 60 °C [30]. Although, the TiO2 was modified by metal nanoparticles, such as Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, Rh or Ir, the BzOH conversion still lower than 10 % at 6 h under 250 W Hg lamp [30]. TiO2 nanowires with special physical and chemical properties have advantages as photocatalysts, which supported on the graphene oxide exhibited much higher photodegradation activity for methylene blue in comparison with TiO2 nanoparticles [31]. In this work, 1D TiO2(B) nanowires supporting Pd nanoparticles were prepared, and were used for solvent-free photo-thermocatalytic oxidation of BzOH with atmospheric O2. Pd/TiO2(B) nanowire catalyst shows high photo-thermocatalytic activity and stability in BzOH oxidation to produce BzH, due to the synergistic effect among Pd, TiO2(B) and their well-matched heterojunction."

Firstly, Pd sol were prepared by mixing Pd(NO3)2 (74 mM) and CP extract at 90 °C. Then Pd nanoparticles were supported onto TiO2(B) nanowires by mixing Pd sol and TiO2(B) to obtain the Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires catalysts."

6,Catalytic activity measurements,2.5 Catalytic activity measurements Solvent-free photo-thermocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation using O2 was carried out in quartz flask at 90 °C. The light source was halogen lamp(150 W). 0.1 g catalyst and 10 mL benzyl alcohol was mixed with oxygen of 90 mL/min. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the resulting product.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterizations of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterizations of the catalyst TiO2(B)were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis method [25,37], and The Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires catalysts were prepared by sol-immobilization method [32,33]. As shown in Fig. 1 , the obtained sample is 1D TiO2 nanowire in Fig. 1(a and b), and the lattice spacings of the crystal planes were approximately 0.36 and 0.62 nm, which corresponds to that of the (110) and (001) crystal planes from TiO2(B) nanowire(Fig. 1c). TiO2(B) crystal planes were also confirmed by FFT (Fig. 1g). There are typical (001), (002), (003) and (110) crystal planes of TiO2(B). As shown in Fig. 1(d and e), Pd NPs were highly dispersed on the TiO2(B) nanowire in Fig. 1(d). We also found that the well-matched heterostructure contact boundary between (111)planes of Pd NPs and (003) planes of TiO2(B) was obviously seen in the HRTEM images in Fig. 1(e and f) [37–39]. The Fourier transformation patterns also display the typical (111) crystal plane of Pd NPs and (003) crystal plane of TiO2(B) nanowire of Pd/TiO2(B) catalyst in Fig. 1(h). Crystal phase structure of TiO2(B) was also characterized using XRD and visible Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the diffraction peaksat 2θ = 14.19°, 24.93°, 28.61°, 43.51°and 48.53° are reflections from the (001), (110) and 002) et al. planes of the TiO2(B) (Ref. code: 46–1237). There is no change for those diffraction peaks associated with TiO2(B) after loading Pd NPs in Fig. 2(b). However, no Pd NPs peak was observed, indicating that Pd NPs might be well dispersed on TiO2(B) nanowire. Raman spectroscopy excited by 532 nm laser of the TiO2(B) nanowire is displayed in Fig. 2(c), the typical bands of TiO2(B) phase appear at 120, 143, 196 cm−1 appear [40], consistent with XRD, visible Raman spectroscopy and HRTEM results. Pd2+ ions can ben reduced to Pd0 species for the Pd/TiO2(B) catalyst, which has been demonstrated by the result of the XPS [41], the detail analysis can be seen in Fig. S2 and Table S1. The detail imformation of BET surface area, pore diameter and pore volume can also be seen in Fig. S1."
9,Photocatalytic activity measurements,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity measurements The photo-thermocatalytic activity of the obtained catalysts was shown in Table 1 . Without light irradiation, Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires only gave 39.5 % of BzOH conversion at 90 °C after 2 h. Under light irradiation, the Pd/TiO2(B) nanowire gave higher catalytic activity with 55.6 % of BzOH conversion,70.3 % of BzH selectivity and TOF of 2735 h−1 at 90 °C after 2 h. Only 68.8 % of conversion was obtained for Pd/TiO2(P25) at 6 h, which is much lower than that of Pd/TiO2(B) nanowire catalyst even at 4 h (81.9 % of BzOH conversion). Almost no photocatalytic performance for Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires at 30 °C, suggesting that there is a synergism between thermocatalysis and photocatalysis [19]. As shown in Fig. 3 , Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires showed enhanced light adsorption, compared with bare TiO2(B). Therefore, more electrons (e−) and holes (h+) pair can be produced, according to the photo-thermocatalytic reaction mechanism7, The e− can been transferred along the axial direction of TiO2(B) nanowire to Pd NPs through the well-matched heterostructure contact boundary between (111)planes of Pd NPs and (003) planes of TiO2(B) nanowires. Therefore, more e− and h+ were separated efficiently. The holes react with α-C–H of BzOH to give BzOH radicals7. The photo-induced electrons can promote Pd sites to active oxygen molecules, yielding O2 − ·. It can cleave OH bond of benzyl alcohol radical, forming BzH6. Without Pd NPs, oxygen molecules activation was decreased [42–44], therefore, bare TiO2(B) gave only 1.9 % of BzOH conversion. Therefore, synergistic effect among Pd, TiO2(B) and their well-matched heterojunction played an important role photocatalytic synthesis of BzH. The Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires catalyst also present high catalytic stability. There is no obviously decrease for BzOH conversion after six recycle utilization (Fig. 4 ). Compared with the catalytic performance from the previous studies, as shown in Table S2, the obtained Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires catalyst present high catalytic activity, especially, High BzH yield and TOF are simultaneously achieved."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, Pd/TiO2(B) nanowires for photo-thermocatalytic BzOH oxidation was prepared. Well-matched heterojunction from (111) planes of Pd NPs and (003) planes of TiO2(B) was formed, which facilitate photo-generated e− transfer. Aslo, the Pd/TiO2(B) showed enhanced light adsorption. Therefore, the catalyst exhibited enhanced photo-thermocatalytic performance which is mainly due tothe synergistic effect among the Pd, TiO2(B) and the contact boundary."
