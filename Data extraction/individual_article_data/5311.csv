0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of textile and dye industry, the production of dyes wastewater has become a serious threat to all the human beings and world. In the past decades, massive efforts have been devoted for removing dyes efficiently from wastewater, such as electrochemical, adsorption and membrane filtration method, etc [1,2]. Among these, the membrane separation technology has drew great attention because of their scalability, easily handing and long-term operability [3]. Particularly, nanofiber based membrane often exhibits excellent capabilities in dying water treatment due to its high surface area, large porosity and excellent water permeability [4]. However, film filtration process often based on the size-dependent separation principle and the intercepted or adsorbed organic contaminants would strongly affect its filtration performance. Therefore, organic fouling to existing membranes separation technology remains a big problem for organic dyes continuous filtration in practical application. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) based photocatalytic is another promising advanced oxidation technology in water purification [5–7]. Currently, the concept of hybrid film that combined nanofibrous materials with photocatalysis captured special interest in wastewater treatment [8,9]. Immobilization of TiO2 NPs onto fibrous support shows of several advantages: (1) avoid the costly separation step; (2) confer self-cleaning property to the membrane matrix; (3) synergistic effect of membrane separation and photocatalytic degradation. Various approaches have been reported to incorporate TiO2 into a film matrix. Electrospinning is one of the most popular versatile method to prepare nanofibrous film of polymers, metals, and composites based on electrostatic forces to form solid nanofiber materials [10]. Despite the versatility of electrospinning, the drawbacks of time-consuming and specific requirement of high-voltage limit its application in industry. An air jet spinning technique have been purposed to fabricate the polymer/TiO2 nanofiber hybrid in large scale based on stretching the polymer/TiO2 blends with high-speed compressed air jet system [11]. However, TiO2 NPs located on the fiber surface with relatively week interfacial interaction that strongly influences its photocatalytic performance and reusability. Recently, a simple and facile method to prepare poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE) nanofiber has been developed by our group [12,13]. This method is able to prepared nanofiber materials in a large scale by using the cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) as the immiscible matrix through a conventional co-rotating twin-screw extrusion equipment [14]. Moreover, poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) is a commercial polymer possessing abundant active hydroxyl groups, which can be easily reactivated and widely applied ranged from electrochemical to biology fields [13,15]. Therefore, we have chosen poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) as a fiber matrix to immobilize TiO2 NPs for photocatalytic applications. Previous researchers mainly focused on the film filtration or photocatalytic performance individually, while little work has been performed on their synergistic effect. Herein, we presented that dye removal efficiency of the fibrous film could be improved by immobilizing TiO2 NPs into the film matrix and coupling with a dye-enriched filtration process. Structural and morphological information of the hybrids was followed by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and contact angle measurements. Methylene blue (MB) was chosen as a model organic dye pollutant to evaluate photocatalytic activity of the hybrid films. Further, a dead-end filtration test combined with photocatalytic process was conducted using the hybrid film as a filter media and the filtration efficiency and repetitive use performance for dye removal were studied."
1,Experimental section,"In briefly, the PVA-co-PE nanofibrous films were prepared following a melt phase separation and suspension coating method reported by our group [12]. TiO2 in three concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%) were added to improve properties of the nanoscale fibers and the result hybrid films were coded as HF-1, HF-3 and HF-5, respectively. The bare film (NF) without TiO2 was prepared as control. Synergistic effect on the hybrid film was characterized by the use of hybrid film filtration after the photocatalytic regenerate process. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of hybrid film and filtration device set-up. More experimental information including materials, preparation of the hybrid films, photocatalytic activity and filtration performance evaluation, and characterizations can be found in Supporting Information."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Morphology and characterization,"3.1 Morphology and characterization The nanofibrous film progressively changed to bright with increasing the TiO2 content, and it seems mechanical strong and flexible which could be warped by using the tweezers (Fig. 2 a). All the films displayed well fibrous morphology and fibers random distributed with a porous internal structure. The magnified views show the nanofiber has a relatively ruffled surface after immobilized TiO2 NPs to the fiber matrix (Fig. 2b). The TiO2 NPs (arrows indicate) were homogeneous distributed throughout of the film matrix with a narrow diameter distribution that ranged from 10 nm to 35 nm. Inserted image indicates the TiO2 were evenly embedded in the internal fiber (Fig. 2c). Elemental analysis measurements were conducted to confirm the presence of TiO2 NPs. Significant Ti signals can be clearly observed from the hybrid samples and slightly increased with the TiO2 contents (Fig. 2d), suggesting the fabricated nanofiber materials can be used as an efficient scaffold for TiO2 immobilization. As mentioned, embedded NPs always played an important role to influence physical structure of the film, such as film thickness, fiber diameter, pore size, surface hydrophilicity, which are the key parameters for film filtration performance [16]. Table 1 summarized some structural parameters of the bare and hybrid films. The nanofibrous film has uniform diameter varies in the range of 50 nm–300 nm and exhibit small pore size that slightly changes in the range of 124.7 ± 3.9 nm to 164.3 ± 3.7 nm with the increase of TiO2 content. These results probably due to the aggregation of TiO2 NPs occurred at higher concentration. Interestingly, there was no observable change in water contact angles between the films synthesized with different TiO2 concentrations (see Fig. S2). This phenomenon means most of the NPs were embedded in the internal nanofibers which is consistent with the observation from the TEM measurement. Fig. 3 give a chemical evidence that embedded TiO2 into nanofiber matrix would affect the physical structure of films. The characteristic peaks of TiO2 at 400-800 cm−1 was observed in all the hybrid films confirm the presence of TiO2 NPs. It also can be seen that the spectrum of hybrid films become stronger and sharper than that of the bare sample after loading TiO2 NPs to the fiber matrix, suggesting some interaction between TiO2 NPs and polymer molecules that strengthen the hydrogen bonding of the hybrid films. These possible affection may explained by the new hydrogen bonds were formed between the alkyl group hydrogen of the polymer chain and abundant – OH groups on the TiO2 surface [11]."
4,Self-cleaning performance,"3.2 Self-cleaning performance Methylene blue (MB) was chosen as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of hybrid film. On the basis of the decrease of peak absorbance and the decolorization of the MB solution (Fig. 4 a), the photocatalytic degradation achieved a maximum removal efficiency of 97.3% after irradiated (15 mW/cm2) for 150 min. All the TiO2 doped hybrid films displayed relatively higher removal rate of MB solution compared to the bare sample. The ln(C/C0) varies linearly with time, suggesting the photocatalytic degradation of MB by TiO2 NPs followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (Fig. 4b). In addition, there was no observable decline in MB photocatalytic degradation rate (all above 95% within 150 min), which indicating the TiO2 immobilized in the fiber matrix does not lose significant amounts of the doped TiO2 during the self-cleaning cycles (Fig. 4c). This results imply the advantage of TiO2 immobilization is potential energy saving, which is a major factor determining the feasibility of photocatalytic treatment."
5,Synergistic effect of film filtration and photocatalytic degradation,"3.3 Synergistic effect of film filtration and photocatalytic degradation Our final experiment shows a coupling of film filtration and photocatalytic degradation. The initial concentration of MB was decreased progressively and then reached to a constant stage with the continuous accumulation of the dye to a certain level, suggesting the film process a final dye capture capacity of 51% and pore structure was not being completely blocked (Fig. 5 a). From this filtration test and the saturated adsorption experiments (about 21%), it could be indicated that the physical interception based on the size-dependent separation principle play a leading role instead of adsorption. During the filtration process, dye particles with relatively large scale will be trapped in the porous network resulting a smaller or blocked pores, thereby the rejection capacity was expected to become increasingly higher and accompanied by the decreasingly lower of water flux [17]. Fig. 5b shows a dense cake-layer of MB (blue arrows indicate) partially covered on the film surface and gradually dissolved under UV irradiation. The film was readily regenerated for repeated use within 45 min. Compared to the results presented in Fig. 4, this rapid degradation process could be explained by the dye-enriched filtration process and nanoscale fiber morphology, thus providing more sites for highly utilization of the living active radical (ROS) produced by the embedded NPs. Self-cleaning induced reusability of the hybrid filters were characterized by the use of membrane filtration after the photocatalytic process. The freshly prepared and regenerated hybrid film showed comparable performance, indicating the excellent regeneration of the photocatalytic properties of the hybrid film which can be used repeatedly without a significant decrease in its mechanical strength and water flux value (Fig. 5c). Therefore, we are expecting that this material will be a reusable promising purification media for contaminated dying water."
6,Conclusion,"The hybrid film of poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene)/TiO2 was prepared on a large scale via a novel facile and green preparation approach. Experimental results showed that the embedded TiO2 confer self-cleaning capability to the nanofibrous film and lead to a great removal efficiency of MB under UV irradiation, reaching to 97.3% within 150 min. This self-cleaning property allows the decomposition of unwanted remnants (eg. MB) on the hybrid film thus make the media reusable. The hybrid films show constant filtration efficiency and water flux after experienced with five cycling tested, which indicating the filter media has great repetitive use performance, and could be developed as a recyclable materials for effective removal of the organic pollutants in wastewater."
