0,Introduction,"Over the past decade, considerable effort by government and industry has been directed towards providing cleaner gasoline. Originally, lead was added to gasoline as an octane enhancer. For each gram of lead added to a gallon of gasoline, the octane rating goes up about 10 times or more in octane numbers [1]. Engines require certain minimum levels of octane to run smoothly and resist knocking. Concern about leaded gasoline emissions encouraged the environmental protection agency (EPA) to call for reduced lead in gasoline. As unleaded gasoline became the standard, petroleum refineries looked to other additives to help keep gasoline octane numbers at leaded standards. Aromatics and alcohols have been the most popular choices. Aromatics, such as benzene and toluene, have high octane levels, but the presence of these compounds produces more smoke, smog, as well as benzene, a known carcinogenic compound [2]. The EPA has approved using several alcohols and ethers in unleaded gasoline. Ethanol and methyl tertiary butyl ethers (MTBE) are the two most popular additives. MTBE is not as widely used as ethanol, but refineries use it as an additive because it is not as sensitive to water as other additives and tends not to increase fuel volatility [3]. The fuel properties of gasoline and its contents have a direct impact on the environment. Table 1 gives a brief account of gasoline properties, their desirable impact on engine performance, and their undesirable impact on the environment [4]. Low molecular weight alcohols such as ethanol have replaced other additives as octane boosters in automotive fuels. Alcohols can be promoted as alternative fuels or alternative fuel components in transportation for many reasons, such as: • Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions • Reduction of toxic exhaust emissions • Enhancement of overall energy efficiency • Reduction of fuel costs • Societal reasons (e.g., employment in the agricultural sector) Unlike gasoline and diesel, alcohols contain oxygen. Adding alcohols to petroleum products allows the fuel to combust more completely due to the presence of oxygen, which increases the combustion efficiency and reduces air pollution. Using gasoline blended with 10% ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An additional factor making ethanol attractive as a fuel extender or substitute is that it is a renewable resource. Table 2 compares the properties of alcohols such as boiling point, latent heat, vapour pressure and solubility in water, with those of octane and hexadecane [5]. Compared to conventional fuels, alcohols have less combustion energy. However, the lowest stoichiometric air to fuel ratio helps alcohol fuels to produce more power inside an engine when these fuels are burned. Table 3 shows the effective blending values of oxygenated fuels as gasoline blends [6]. Research Octane Number (RON) is determined in test engines at a relatively low speed (600rpm) to simulate city driving speed with frequent acceleration. Motor octane number (MON) is measured at a higher speed (900rpm), which simulates highway driving. For most fuel components, RON is greater than MON and the difference between them is used to judge fuel quality. This is known as the sensitivity of the fuel and a maximum value is specified for the gasoline, which typically should be less than 10. Although methanol has the highest percentage of oxygen, its sensitivity is 30 when compared with ethanol, having a sensitivity of 15 and a Reid vapour pressure (RVP) much less than that of methanol. In essence, ethanol is more advantageous when comparing the percent oxygen content, sensitivity, and Reid vapour pressure with those of other fuels."
1,Adverse effects of alcohol fuels,"The presence of alcohols in fuel causes corrosion to metallic fuel system components because of increased water content in the fuel and partly because of the organic acids produced in commercial oxygenates. Other major disadvantages of alcohol fuels are vapour lock due to high vapour pressures and low boiling points [7]. The major difference between the alcohols and gasoline is that alcohols are strong solvents and, hence, highly corrosive to some metal parts of the engines. Methanol is more corrosive compared with higher alcohols. There is limited miscibility between methanol and gasoline, because of the presence of minute amounts of water, which causes phase separation. When compared to methanol, ethanol has low vapour pressure, better solubility with hydrocarbon liquids, improved water tolerance, and higher overall heating value. Other redeeming qualities such as latent heat of vaporization, volatility, and anti-knock values make ethanol fuels superior to methanol blended fuels [8]. Phase separation occurs when alcohol and water mix together in an ethanol blended fuel. When the alcohol and water get separated from the gasoline, the resulting mixture settles at the bottom of the tank and becomes corrosive [9]. Corrosion due to alcohols is of three types: general corrosion, dry corrosion, and wet corrosion. General corrosion is due to ionic impurities such as chloride ions and acetic acid. Dry corrosion is due to the ethanol molecule and its polarity. The azeotropic formation of ethanol and water causes wet corrosion. Ethanol with neutral pH has little corrosive effect. If the alcohol/gasoline blend stays for a sufficiently large time inside the tank, it allows the alcohol to absorb moisture from the atmosphere and causes corrosion to the fuel injection system. Non-metallic components such as seals and O-rings in the fuel injection system tend to swell and stiffen due to the presence of alcohols in fuels [10]."
2,Modifications required for best use of alcohol fuels,In order to best use the alcohols as alternative fuels there are two options: redesign the engine to take full advantage of the alcohol fuel's properties or blend in one or more additives to the ethanol or methanol to improve its characteristics.
3,Modifications to vehicles,3.1 Modifications to vehicles The following modifications are typical for converting conventional vehicles to high-level alcohol blends [11]. 1. Stainless steel fuel tank with stainless flame arrestors in the fill and vent tubes to prevent ignition by an external source. 2. Methanol resistant float level potentiometer with a corrosion protection circuit. 3. Higher flow methanol–tolerant fuel injector and fuel pump to handle higher flow rates. 4. Stainless fuel lines with accompanying Teflon fuel hoses. 5. Anodized aluminium fuel injection rail and modified pressure regulator.
4,Additives required for improving the fuel properties of alcohols,"3.2 Additives required for improving the fuel properties of alcohols Alcohols can be used effectively as alternative liquid transportation fuels by modifying their properties by using certain additives, which must be physically and chemically compatible with the base alcohol fuel and have the same or higher specific energy content. Additives must not be readily removable from the fuel, significantly add to exhaust emissions, or leave any residue. They should not complicate regulatory compliance, and they should be relatively inexpensive [12]. Ethanol and methanol are completely miscible with water, but show very poor miscibility with gasoline containing traces of water. So, blending gasoline with ethanol or methanol in the presence of water may lead to a phase separation problem. Additives such as higher alcohols like iso-propanol, 1-butanol, n-decanol, various commercial non-ionic surfactants, and various anionic fatty acid surfactants can be effectively controlled to prevent the phase separation problem. The prevention of phase separation would have definite benefits for overall drivability, as well as in corrosion of water-sensitive components such as aluminium [13]. Conventional fuel injection systems usually encounter lubrication problems due to the low viscosity of alcohol fuels, which leads to wearing of the engine parts. Higher alcohol additives offer better lubrication and decrease wear in engine parts. During combustion, alcohol blended fuels produce acids that are responsible for wearing of engine parts. Neutralizers such as zinc dialkyldithiophospates and calcium sulfonates are added in lubricant oil to neutralize these acids and improve lubrication. Shorter lubricant oil change intervals reduce corrosive wear significantly [14]."
5,Production of industrial ethanol,"Ethanol can be manufactured by: 1. Fermentation of sugar derived from grain starches (wheat and corn), sugar beets, or sugar crops using microorganisms. 2. Using surplus wine ethanol; fermentation of the non-sugar lignocellulose fractions of crops (grasses and trees). 3. Synthetically, through direct hydration of ethylene (derived from petroleum). 4. High temperature catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to liquid fuels by the Fischer–Tropsch process to produce a mixture of alcohols. Fermentation is the primary method for production of beverage alcohol and much of the alcohol used in industry. Fermentation uses a variety of sources including grains such as corn, potato mashes, fruit juices, beet and cane sugar, molasses, and non-sugar lingo-cellulose fractions of crops and grasses. Enzymes such as microscopic yeasts in the absence of oxygen convert carbohydrates to ethanol. The equations for the fermentation of carbohydrates to ethanol in the presence of yeast are [15]: (1) C12H22O11 +H2O→2C6H12O6 (2) C6H12O6 →2CH3CH2OH+2CO2 Another method of manufacturing ethanol is reacting ethylene with steam. The catalyst used is solid silicon dioxide coated with phosphoric (V) acid. The reaction is reversible. (3) CH2 =CH2 +H2O↔CH3CH2OH;ΔH =−45MJ/kgmol Only 5% of the ethylene is converted into ethanol at each pass through the reactor. By removing the ethanol from the equilibrium mixture and recycling the ethane, it is possible to achieve an overall 95% conversion. This is a continuous flow process and is much simpler and more efficient than fermentation, producing high purity ethanol. The major disadvantages of this process are that it needs a lot of energy input, because the reaction takes place at high temperatures and pressures, and it uses finite resources based on crude oil [16]. Synthesis of alcohols from synthesis gas remains an economically attractive method for making fuels and primary materials from chemical industries. Synthesis gas can be produced from natural gas reforming, coal gasification, or biomass gasification. Synthesis gas obtained from coal and natural gas reforming contains sulfurous compounds such as hydrogen sulphide, whereas little H2S is contained in synthesis gas obtained from biomass gasification. The presence of minute amounts of H2S in synthesis gas can deactivate the catalyst and decreased the efficiency of gas-to-liquid catalytic conversion process. Synthesis gas obtained from biomass is advantageous because of the flexibility regarding feedstock, that enables a very wide range of biomass and even residues to be processed, depending on the gasification technology used [17]. Compared to other process, catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols is advantageous as this uses forest or agricultural surplus and household waste and does not compete with the feed grains available for human need or use finite resources. Catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols is a continuous flow process, producing mixture of methanol, ethanol and other higher alcohols with comparatively higher yields."
6,Synthesis of higher alcohols from synthesis gas,"The synthesis of higher alcohols from synthesis gas by direct catalysis was recognized in 1923 by Frans Fischer and Hans Tropsch. They reported that a mixture of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, and esters were formed when the reaction between CO and H2 was performed at pressures ranging from 10 to 14MPa and at temperatures of 400–500°C in the presence of an alkalized iron oxide catalyst. They named the mixture synthol and named the process the synthol process [18]. In 1930, Frolich and Cryder reported the formation of alcohols higher than methanol by passing syngas over a Zn:Mn:Cr, 1:1.1:1.03 catalyst. They reported that methanol forms from a formaldehyde intermediate and that the higher alcohols form from the methanol through a stepwise condensation reaction [19]. In the 1940s, Du Pont developed an alkalized Mn-Cr catalyst to synthesize methanol and higher alcohols from syngas for commercial purposes [20]. In the late 1940s, Farbenindustrie et al. introduced the Synol process for the manufacture of alcohols from syngas. This process uses low pressures of around 2MPa with higher productivity of alcohols by modifying the Fischer–Tropsch alkalized iron catalyst [21]. Natta et al. reviewed the synthesis of higher alcohols from CO and H2, in 1957 and reported that the synthesis of higher alcohols was always related to the presence of strongly basic substances [22]."
7,Catalyst systems for higher alcohols synthesis,"Several authors summarized typical operating conditions, research status, characteristics, and performance of primary groups of catalysts that have been adapted and tested for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS). According to these reviews, there are two major catalyst groups for higher alcohol production:"
8,Modified methanol synthesis catalysts,"6.1 Modified methanol synthesis catalysts a. Alkali-modified high pressure, high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts. b. Alkali-modified low pressure, low temperature methanol synthesis catalysts."
9,Modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts,"6.2 Modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts a. Fe, Ni, or Co-modified low temperature, low pressure methanol synthesis catalysts. b. Supported rhodium-group catalysts. c. Alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts."
10,"High pressure, high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts","6.3 High pressure, high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts Natta et al. [23] first studied the synthesis of alcohols from synthesis gas over ZnO/Cr2O3 catalysts promoted with alkali metals, these are high pressure and high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts. They reported that Cs, Rb, and K were the most active promoters for production of HAS. The HAS takes place over this catalyst at high temperatures of 400–450°C and at high pressures of 10–25.5MPa [24–26]. These catalyst systems represent an improvement in the selectivity towards iso-butanol, but the total product rate of alcohols in the product stream is lower than that of Cu-containing catalysts [27,28]. These catalyst systems require high operating temperatures and pressures, are relatively inactive, and yield branched alcohols, among which iso-butanol is the main product and methanol is the other product [29]. The activities and selectivities of alcohols obtained over high pressure, high temperature methanol synthesis catalysts are compared in Table 4 [30]. The commercially available Zn/Cr spinel support promoted with K is compared with the catalyst supported on ZnO powder. The total alcohols and iso-butanol space time yield (STY) increases whereas, the methanol and hydrocarbon STY decreases with the addition of K. The best operating parameters for the production of higher alcohols are 440°C and 10.3MPa (1500psi) using H2 to CO molar ratio of 1.0 and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 12,000 over the 1wt% K promoted catalyst supported on commercial Zn/Cr spinel. When compared with K, incorporation of Cs in Zn/Cr catalysts increased the higher alcohol production rate and selectivity."
11,"Low pressure, low temperature methanol synthesis catalysts","6.4 Low pressure, low temperature methanol synthesis catalysts In 1928, Lewis and Frolich found that high methanol yields are possible by passing a synthesis gas over a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. Since this discovery, it was found that Cu-based catalysts promoted with alkali resulted in higher alcohols from synthesis gas. The presence of Cu in ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts enables the alcohol production at lower operating temperature and pressures. Smith and Anderson [31] studied the synthesis of higher alcohols over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts promoted with K2CO3 at temperatures of 270–310°C and a pressure of 7.6MPa, using a H2 to CO molar ratio of 0.45 and a GHSV of 3265L(STP)/[(kg of catalyst)h]. The alcohols in the product were mostly methanol, with small amounts of higher alcohols. They assumed that the addition of an oxygenated C1 intermediate to an alcohol chain obtained from the linear growth of carbon–carbon bond forming reactions yields linear alcohols, whereas, a β-addition aldol condensation type mechanism between an oxygenated C1 intermediate and an aldehydic C n intermediate yields 2-methyl-branched primary alcohols. The HAS selectivity enhanced at higher temperatures and H2/CO ratios of less than 1.0 [32,33]. The low temperatures of 250–300°C and low pressures of 2–10MPa are used for the synthesis of higher alcohols over these catalysts. These catalyst systems produce mainly branch alcohols, along with methanol. Compared to high temperature, high pressure methanol synthesis catalysts, these catalysts can yield high conversion of alcohols, but with poor selectivity. Long time activation is one advantage of this catalyst system, but they cannot be used at temperatures greater than 300°C due to sintering of copper [34]. Increasing calcination temperatures from 280 to 400°C causes a decrease in the surface area of the catalyst. The addition of the cesium promoter did not significantly affect the BET area of the base catalyst. The incorporation of cesium resulted in much higher methanol and higher alcohols productivities; by co-feeding a given C n H2n +1OH alcohol, they found that the C n +1H2n +3OH yield was enhanced. Increasing temperature increases methanol, higher alcohol, and hydrocarbon production rate over a Cs-promoted Cu/Zno/Cr2O3 catalyst. The addition of water does not affect the methanol synthesis reaction, but inhibits the formation of the C2+ oxygenates [24]. Increasing the temperature from 270 to 325°C increased the activity of the Cu-Co2O3/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, but decreased the selectivity of C2+OH alcohols. Increasing pressure increased the overall yield, conversion, and selectivity of the alcohols, but hydrocarbon selectivity decreased [35]. Table 5 compares the activities of methanol and higher alcohols obtained over low pressure, low temperature methanol synthesis catalysts. Most of these studies were performed using H2 to CO molar ratio less than 1.0 [24,33]. It is clear from Table 5 that addition of alkali improved the formation of higher alcohols [24]. Increased temperature favoured the formation of higher alcohols [36,37]. Higher alcohols yield was greatly improved by using a double bed reactor system [33,38]."
12,"Fe, Ni, or Co-modified low temperature, low pressure methanol synthesis catalysts","6.5 Fe, Ni, or Co-modified low temperature, low pressure methanol synthesis catalysts In 1934, Taylor modified the hydrogenation action of Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts by the addition of metal sulfides, borates, phosphates, and/or alkali promoters. In 1952, Anderson et al. proved that alkali-promoted F-T catalysts improved the production of higher alcohol synthesis. Later studies showed that decreased operating temperatures and increased reactant stream contact time reduced the hydrocarbon production and favoured the alcohol formation over Fe- and Co-containing F-T catalysts. Typical operating conditions for these catalysts are 4–10MPa of pressure, 200–350°C of temperature, and 2000–8000L(STP)/[(kg of catalyst)h] of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) with a ratio of H2/CO of 1.0 to 2.0. The products consist mainly of linear alcohols, with small amounts of branched alcohols. Linear alcohol distribution obeys the Schulz–Flory distribution, but the formation of hydrocarbons cannot be reduced to acceptable levels over these catalyst systems. Deactivation causes the destruction of the spine structures of Cu and Co, Ni or Fe and these cannot be used at temperatures greater than 300°C due to the sintering of Cu [34]. High temperature and pressure could increase carbon deposition from the iron group metals, resulting in catalyst disintegration. The carbon deposition rate of cobalt and nickel catalysts is prohibitively high at temperatures above 250 and 300°C for iron. Hydrogen-rich synthesis gas should be used in order to minimize carbon deposition [39]. F-T catalysts prepared from solutions of various cyanide complexes showed a slightly higher alcohol production than the conventionally prepared bimetallic catalysts [40]. The selectivity of higher alcohols was increased greatly when nickel and cobalt were added, compared with that of the CuMn/ZrO2 catalyst. The addition of Fe to the CuMn/ZrO2 catalyst improved its selectivity to hydrocarbon [41]. The effect of iron was greatly influenced by the method of catalyst preparation. The presence of iron affects the structural properties of the catalyst by increasing the dispersion of copper and by improving the stabilization of the catalyst. The co-precipitation method produced highly dispersed copper species, which favoured the synthesis of methanol and branch alcohols. The wetness impregnation method gave rise to a highly dispersed copper and copper-iron phase, which showed a good performance for synthesis of straight chain alcohols [42]. Typical activities of Fe, Ni, or Co-modified low temperature, low pressure methanol synthesis catalysts towards alcohols are reported in the literature and are shown in Table 6 . It can be observed from this table that the calcination temperature strongly influenced the interaction between the active species (Cu and Mn) and support (ZrO2), hence influencing the structure and catalytic performance [43]. Xu et al. [43] and Chu et al. [44] observed that addition of Fe, Co to low pressure, low temperature methanol synthesis catalysts decreased CO conversion, and total alcohols yield, whereas, the selectivities of hydrocarbons and total alcohols are greatly improved. Conversely, Zhao et al. [41] reported that addition of Ni to CuMn/ZrO2 improved the CO conversion and hydrocarbons yield, and decreased the total alcohols yield and selectivity."
13,Supported rhodium-group catalysts,"6.6 Supported rhodium-group catalysts The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over transition metal catalysts produces a variety of compounds such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, and acids. Over transition metal catalysts, alkali doping inhibits methanol formation and favours the formation of ethanol. In 1978, Ichikawa et al. reported that C2-oxygenated compounds (mainly ethanol) were produced over an Rh-based catalyst during the synthesis of methanol. Among the group VIII metals, Rh is unique in its ability to predominantly catalyze the formation of C2 oxygenates from syngas. Rhodium is a component of most catalyst studies, usually in combination with promoters to increase its activity or selectivity to ethanol. During the last decade, research has focused on the features of Rh-based catalysts and their function in higher alcohol synthesis. These catalysts are advantageous due to low operating conditions, with typical operating temperatures of 150–250°C and pressures of 0.1–2.5MPa [34]. The addition of transition metals such as Mn, Ti, and Zr in oxide form on Rh/SiO2 enhances the CO conversion rate 10–50 times more than that with Rh/SiO2 alone, and also improves the selectivity towards C2-oxygenates. This is due to the oxophilic promoters located at the surface of Rh particles, which enhance the CO dissociation rate and the steady-state coverage of the surface with alkyl groups. The addition of base metals such as Zn and Fe are effective in blocking CO dissociation on the Rh surface and, hence, methanation and C2-oxygenate formation is substantially suppressed [45]. The addition of Fe and Mo enhance the chain growth properties of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst and improve the formation of C2+ components. Moderate reaction pressures between 0.1 and 2.5MPa and low temperatures between 150 and 250°C favour the formation of C2+ components. The addition of Fe on Rh/ZrO2 catalysts produces opposing effects: it reduces the number of Rh atoms available for CO and hydrogen adsorption, increases the number of double-bonded CO (Rh–CO–Fe), and favours the formation of oxygenated products. In Rh/ZrO2 catalysts, iron promotes the activity and selectivity to oxygenated products when present in small quantity (Fe/Rh<1.5), but decreases the activity only when present in larger amounts [46]. Rh catalysts supported on SiO2 and CeO2 are compared in CO hydrogenation [47]. The main C2 oxygenate that formed over SiO2-supported Rh catalyst was acetaldehyde, whereas ethanol was mainly obtained over the Rh catalyst supported on CeO2. It was also observed that CeO2 suppressed alkanes formation to a larger extent than it did C2 oxygenate production, and promoted the formation of methanol. The activities and selectivities results of the supported Rh-group catalysts available in the literature as discussed here are compared in Table 7 ."
14,Alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts,"6.7 Alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts The sulfides of transition metals have been used in the petroleum industry in hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenigrodenation, and hydrogenation reactions for over 50 years. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) when supported with an alkali can be used as a catalyst for the production of alcohols from syngas. The commercial Mo-based catalysts to convert synthesis gas to alcohols were first developed by Dow and Union Carbide companies. The functions of alkali are to reduce the hydrogenation ability of alkyl species to form alkanes and to increase the active sites for the formation of alcohols [48,49]. Alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts are more attractive due to their excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning and their high activity for water–gas shift reaction. This saves the cost of ultra-desulfurization for feed gas and separation of water [50]. The alcohol products over these catalyst systems are linear alcohols, and the mechanism for formation of higher alcohols (C2+OH) was via a classical insertion of CO into the corresponding precursor alcohol. The activity and selectivity to C2+OH was found to be low due to A-S-F distribution [51]. The effect of CO hydrogenation reaction towards the formation of higher alcohols also depends on the catalyst support. Table 8 compares the activities of alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts supported on various supports [50,52–56]. The catalytic performance of alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts supported on carbon based supports such as, activated carbon (AC) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were found to be high in terms of higher alcohols yield and selectivity compared to that of unsupported and catalysts supported on metallic oxide supports, such as SiO2 and Al2O3. The F-T elements such as Ni and Co increase the alcohol yield and selectivity towards higher alcohols of MoS2 catalysts [57,58]. The presence of Co in alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts enhanced the C1 →C2 homologation step that led to ethanol as the dominant product [59]. The addition of Ni to K/MoS2 catalysts leads to methanation [57]. The addition of Mn on Ni/K/MoS2 catalysts inhibits the enrichment of Ni to a certain extent, which restrains the formation of hydrocarbons and carbon chain growth promoted by Ni, leading to improved selectivity of higher alcohols [60]. The typical operating temperature and pressure are in the range of 250–350°C and 5–10MPa [34]. Increasing the reactant temperature increases the selectivity of both hydrocarbons and higher alcohols, but decreases the selectivity of methanol. The promoting effect of different alkali metals (K, Rb, and Cs) on MoS2 catalyst for the formation of higher alcohols depends on the alkali:Mo ratio. The performance of K and Rb are superior to those of Cs at an alkali:Mo ratio of 0.7:1. The performance for Cs-promoted catalysts can be improved by decreasing the ratio from 0.7:1 to 0.22:1 [61]. The promotional effect of K was greater than Cs for alcohol synthesis over the Co-MoS2/clay catalyst [62]. The addition of Cl has no promotion effect on alcohol activity, but increases the selectivity of alcohol formation. The presence of carbon-dioxide in the feed causes greater amounts of water to be produced, but reduces the formation of CO2. The addition of CO2 reduces the formation of higher alcohols; while H2S increases the formation of hydrocarbons [63]. Co-promotion to Mo-K catalysts increased the alcohol ratios of C2 +/C1 in the products relative to that for the un-promoted sample. Co species show a relatively stronger interaction with the Mo component in the form Co–Mo–S structure than the in Co–Mo–O structure [58]. Mo species with intermediate valence (around +3.5) are more active phases for alcohol synthesis from CO hydrogenation, while those with lower Mo valence are responsible for the production of hydrocarbons [64]. Depending on the reaction conditions, and on the properties of alkali promoters, and support, Rh-species in catalysts are capable of catalyzing dissociation, insertion, and hydrogenation of CO [65]. The conversion of CO and the yield of oxygenates over Mo-Rh/Al2O3 catalysts is high when compared to Rh/Al2O3 catalysts [66]. The interaction of rhodium with molybdenum affects the status of the rhodium species, which affects CO adsorption. The formation of alcohols on rhodium catalysts can be catalyzed by the sites that are less electron-rich than those needed for hydrocarbons, and more of these electron-deficient sites can be created by the interaction of rhodium with molybdenum [67,68]. The incorporation of rhodium into the K-promoted MoS2 catalysts increases catalytically active surfaces and is responsible for increasing the activity for alcohol synthesis. Due to the co-existence of cationic and metallic rhodium species stabilized by the interaction of rhodium with molybdenum species, the selectivity to the formation of higher alcohols is high [69]. The effects of promotion of various transition metals on alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis are compared in Table 9 . It can be observed from this table that addition of transition metals such as Ni, Co, and Rh to alkali-modified molybdenum-based catalysts improved CO hydrogenation, to result in enhanced space time yields of methanol, higher alcohols, and hydrocarbons [60,65,67,70–72]. The formation of hydrocarbons is greatly reduced using alkali-modified trimetallic catalysts supported on MWCNTs compared to that of bimetallic catalysts [73]. The mesoporous activated carbon-supported trimetallic catalysts showed less activity and selectivity compared to the MWCNT-supported catalysts [74]."
15,Catalyst supports for higher alcohols synthesis,"A catalyst support is a solid material that offers a high surface area for a catalyst by distributing the metal particles over the support. The texture and surface acidity of a support can influence metal dispersion and properties of reduction, as well as the interaction between metal and support. The sintering of the active material can be prevented by impregnating the catalyst species on a thermostable support. Typical supports, such as various kinds of carbon, alumina, silica, and zirconia, have been used for catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to higher alcohols [75,76]. The supports for higher alcohol synthesis are neutral or basic; otherwise, can be made neutral or basic by adding alkaline promoters [77]. The surface acidity of metal oxides such as Al2O3 and ZrO2 suppresses the formation of alcohols and improves the hydrocarbon reaction rate. Activated carbon, as a neutral catalyst support, has many advantages for higher alcohols synthesis because of its large surface area, limited interaction between the support and the active material, resistance to acidic or basic media, and stability at high temperatures and pressures [78]. The hydrocarbon selectivity on activated carbon-supported molybdenum catalysts was found to be much less than that of SiO2, Al2O3, and CeO2 [79]. However, the microporous structure (pore size<2nm) of activated carbon limits the transportation of the reactants and products through the pores. This results in the formation of coke which plugs the pores of the support and finally deactivates the catalyst [80]. Also, activated carbons are impure in nature with l0–15% of ash content, depending on the nature of the precursor used [81]. Carbon in the form of MWCNTs is drawing attention as a new generation of catalyst support, due to their flexibility as support in tailoring the catalyst properties to specific needs [82]. The use of MWCNTs as catalyst support has been increasing for reactions involving hydrogen as a reactant or product [83–85]. These materials have inert graphitic surfaces, are resistant to acidic or basic media, and display unique properties such as meso/macroporous structures that mitigate transport limitations. They have uniform and straight pores that allow great metal dispersion. They exhibit high mechanical strength and thermal conductivity and can be highly purified [86–88]. Due to its structural advantages, the deactivation of the catalysts supported on MWCNTs was found to be low compared to those of the catalyst supported on activated carbon [89]. This is due to less sintering of active phase, metal support interaction and coke formation during catalytic processes."
16,Catalyst preparation and pre-treatment conditions,"In a heterogeneous chemical reaction, the activity and selectivity of products also depend on the selection of precursors and the method of preparation of the catalyst. The selection of precursors has a direct impact on the cost and availability of the chemicals. The deposition of the metals on the support plays an important role in such a way that every metal atom is accessible to the reactants [90]. The catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis can mostly be prepared by sequential pore volume impregnation or incipient wetness method [91]. The catalysts, synthesized in the form of a metal oxide, are subjected to a pre-treatment prior to higher alcohols synthesis. The temperature, pressure, heating rate and pre-treatment gas environment can influence the surface area and the activity of the catalyst [92]."
17,Reaction mechanism for higher alcohol synthesis,"Depending on the process conditions and catalyst used, alcohols are synthesized using iso-synthesis, variants of Fisher–Tropsch synthesis, oxo-synthesis involving the hydroformylation of olefins, and homologation of methanol and lower molecular weight alcohols to make higher alcohols. The products include primary and secondary alcohols of both normal and branched carbon chains. Other oxygenates such as esters, aldehydes, and ketones are also formed. The following are the chemical reactions involved in the synthesis of higher alcohols from synthesis gas: (4) CO+2H2 ↔CH3OH (5) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 (6) CH3OH+CO+2H2 ↔CH3CH2OH+H2O (7) C n H2n +1OH+CO+2H2 ↔CH3(CH2) n OH+H2O (8) 2CH3OH↔CH3CH2OH+H2O (9) 2CH3OH↔(CH3)2CO+H2O (10) CH3OH+CO↔CH3CHO+H2O (11) (CH3)2CO+H2 ↔(CH3)2CHOH+H2O (12) 2CH3CHO↔CH3COOCH2CH3 Together with these reactions, undesired side reactions such as hydrocarbon formation may occur, especially that of methane. (13) CO+3H2 ↔CH4 +H2O The water gas shift reaction, Eq. (5), is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. According to the reaction stoichiometry the optimum H2/CO ratio is 2; however, the simultaneous occurrence of water gas shift reaction means that the optimum ratio is closer to 1. As all the above reactions are exothermic reactions, from a thermodynamic point of view, lower temperatures and higher pressures are profitable for the formation of alcohols."
18,Modified methanol synthesis catalysts,"9.1 Modified methanol synthesis catalysts Smith and Anderson assumed the following growth rules to describe a chain growth scheme for the synthesis of alcohols from syngas over modified methanol synthesis catalysts [31]: Higher alcohol formation results from the reaction of two intermediates of lower carbon numbers. At least one of these has a carbon number of one or two. Thus, growth is by one or two carbon additions only. Addition occurs at the α- or β-carbon (with respect to the hydroxylated carbon atom) of the reaction intermediate. Addition does not occur on α-CH group. Two-carbon addition does not occur at an α-carbon. All the reaction rates are assumed to be first order with respect to the concentration of growing intermediate at the surface, including desorption of this intermediate. The rate constants are also assumed to be independent of carbon number and all steps are irreversible. Based on these assumptions, the following reaction scheme represents the successful kinetic model for the formation of methanol and higher alcohol from CO and CO2 on modified methanol synthesis catalytic sites [93]: Reaction schemes for methanol synthesis from CO and H2 are (14) CO+s→COs (15) H2 +2s→2Hs (16) COs +Hs →HCOs +s (17) HCOs +Hs →H2COs +s (18) H2COs +Hs →H3COs +Hs (19) H3COs +Hs →CH3OHs +s (20) CH3OHs →CH3OH+s Reaction schemes for methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 are (21) CO2 +s→CO2,s (22) H2 +2s→2Hs (23) CO+s→COs (24) CO2,s +Hs →HCO2,s +s (25) HCO2,s +Hs →H2COs +Os (26) H2COs +Hs →H3COs +Hs (27) H3COs +Hs →CH3OHs +s (28) CH3OHs →CH3OH+s (29) COs +Os →CO2,s +s Reaction schemes for higher alcohol synthesis from CH3OH only are (30) CH3OH+s→CH3OHs (31) CH3OHs+s→CH3Os +Hs (32) CH3Os+s→CH2Os +Hs (33) CH3Os+CH2Os→CH3CH2Os +Os (34) CH3CH2Os+Hs→CH3CH2OHs +s (35) CH3CH2OHs →CH3CH2OH+s (36) COs +Os →CO2,s +s (37) CO2,s →CO2 +s (38) CO+s→COs (39) H2 +s→H2,s The higher alcohols formed include ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-1-proponol, 1-butanol, and pentanols."
19,Supported Rh-based catalysts,"9.2 Supported Rh-based catalysts Xiaoding et al. suggested the following reaction scheme for the production of higher alcohols from syngas over Rh-based catalysts [34]: (40) ½H2 +s→Hs (41) CO+s→COs (42) CO+s→Cs +Os (43) Cs + xHs →(CH x )s (44) CH3 +(CH x )s →(C2H y )s (45) (C n H z )s +(CH x )s →(C n +1H x + z )s (46) (C n +1H x + z )s +Hs →C n +1H2n +Hs →C n H2n +2 (47) (C n H z )s +COs →C n H z COs +Hs →C n +1H2n +3OH The hydrogenation of C n H zs leads to the formation of alkanes and alkenes, whereas, COs insertion to C n H zs leads to the formation of C n H z COs species, which upon hydrogenation eventually leads to the production of C n +1 alcohol. The CO insertion represents a termination step rather than propagation in this mechanism."
20,Alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts,"9.3 Alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts Santiesteban et al. [94] developed the reaction system for the production of mixed alcohols from syngas over alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts based on a CO insertion mechanism. This reaction scheme can be represented in terms of chain initiation, propagation and termination as follows: Chain initiation: (48) CO+s↔COs (49) H2 +2s↔2Hs (50) COs +Hs ↔CHOs +s (51) CHOs +Hs ↔CH2Os +s (52) CH2Os +Hs ↔R1Os +s Chain propagation: (53) R i Os +COs →R i COOs +s (54) R i Os +2Hs →R is +H2O+2s (55) R is +COs →R i COs +s (56) R i COs +2Hs →R i +1Os +2s Chain termination: (57) R i Os +Hs ↔R i OH+2s (58) R i COOs +Hs →R i COOR i −1 +2s (59) R is +Hs →C i H2i +2 +2s (60) R is →C i H2i +Hs Reactions represented by Eqs. (48)–(52) are assumed to be in equilibrium. R indicates an alkyl group, i.e., R i =C i H2i +1. Alcohols are formed by hydrogenation of their precursors R i Os, hydrocarbons from R is and esters from R i COOs by CO insertion and hydrogenation. Together with the above reactions, a water gas shift reaction also takes place as given by Eq. (5). The simplified reaction scheme is as shown in Fig. 1 ."
21,Conclusions,"Ethanol synthesis is of interest due to the increasing petroleum prices, environmental concerns, and gasoline additive octane demands. The presence of ethanol in the fuel causes corrosion of the metallic fuel system components and causes vapour lock of the engine due to high vapour pressures and low boiling points. This can be avoided by redesigning the engine or blending additives, such as higher alcohols, to improve fuel characteristics. Catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols is advantageous as this uses various renewable and non-renewable carbon resources. Different catalytic systems can be used for synthesizing higher alcohols from synthesis gas. Depending on the process conditions and catalyst used, the reaction mechanism varies and the products include primary and secondary alcohols of both normal and branched carbon chains. Transition metal-promoted alkali-modified molybdenum sulphide catalysts are considered to be more attractive to improve CO hydrogenation and for the production of linear alcohols."
