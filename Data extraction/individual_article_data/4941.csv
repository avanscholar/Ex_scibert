0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is highly toxic gas and a dangerous workplace hazard. It is colorless, flammable and smells like rotten eggs. About 90 % of H2S present in ambient air originates from natural processes [1]. Typical H2S values released into the atmosphere by natural processes are less than 1 ppb. The main entry route for H2S into the human body is via inhalation and symptoms depend on dose [2]. The mechanism of toxic action of H2S is similar to cyanide, a reversible inhibition of cytochrome c-oxidase which consequently inhibits mitochondrial ATP production causing the inhibition of aerobic cellular respiration [1]. Human metabolism normally metabolizes H2S and oxidizes it to pharmacologically inert thiosulfate, which is then converted to sulfate and excreted in the urine. If the absorbed dose gas is too high, the body's natural ability to detoxify is overwhelmed and the toxic exposure leads to death. In cases of non-fatal H2S poisoning, it is useful to investigate thiosulfate in the urine rather than in the blood, while in fatal cases thiosulfate analysis of the blood is the most effective method of confirming H2S poisoning [1,3,4]. Blood sulfide, on the other hand, is only useful when analyzed within 2 h of exposure because it is highly unstable and can be increased by postmortem production of sulfide due to putrefaction. Likewise, sulfhemoglobin is not useful for confirming H2S exposure [4]. Several accidents in the workplace and fatal cases involving hydrogen sulfide have been reported, mainly in confined spaces or semi-confined spaces. We have taken into consideration only those cases where the level of thiosulfate has been assessed and used to confirm intoxication [3–9]. Only one death from H2S in an open space has so far been documented [10]. Besides their occurrence in a confined space, the most frequent and typical circumstances surrounding H2S accidents are a combination of the following criteria: immediate collapse with a high probability of death and the typical unpleasant odor at the accident site as well as on the cadavers. Tragically, a recurrent workplace scenario is when a worker realizes that a colleague has been poisoned and when that worker himself also becomes a victim when he tries to rescue the colleague without adequate protection [2]. Table 1 reports fatal H2S accidents which have occurred in Italy in the last 10 years: it uses data up until 2011 taken from Benedetti et al., 2012 [11] as well more recent INAIL data (Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work) [12]. The reported cases have been the subject of judicial inquiries. However, in special environmental conditions, associated with unsafe operating procedures, workers are also at risk from poisoning even in unconfined spaces. While no previous cases of deaths from acute H2S intoxication in open spaces or totally outdoors have been reported in Italy, we report a rare case of lethal H2S intoxication which occurred in Italy in a totally outdoor environment, specifically on a tanker semi-trailer during leachate loading operations."
1,Case report,"In July 2014 two male tanker drivers died outside a plant producing organic fertilizers from wet waste processing while they were loading leachate, produced in the composting process, from a buried tank (8 m away) into a tanker in order to dispose of it in another place. The H2S, which had formed in the underground tank, leaked out in the tanker, quickly escaped from the hatch, engulfed the first worker and, immediately afterwards, the second worker as well. As Fig. 1 shows, the first worker (P.R.) was standing by the upper opening of the tank without wearing a respirator or using equipment to monitor the operation’s safety. He opened the hatch and collapsed as he was engulfed by the gas which escaped violently from the hatch. The second worker (L.F.), rushed to help the first worker and, after inhaling the gas, lost his balance and fell off the tanker. P.R. was found lying on the top of the tanker next to the hatch, while L.F. was found lifeless on the ground near the tanker. The entire accident area was secured following the gas leak (Fig. 2 ). The accident occurred at about 9.40 a.m. in the morning. The coroner arrived on the scene at 10.30 a.m. and pronounced the victims dead. The autopsy was conducted on well refrigerated corpses about 36 h after death."
2,Autopsy findings,The autopsy results are consistent with acute cardio-respiratory failure due to acute H2S gas inhalation as the cause of the workers' death. Findings of the two autopsies are shown in Table 2 .
3,Toxicology,"During the autopsies, arterial and inferior vena cava blood samples were collected for toxicological analyses and stored at −20°C until analysis about two months later. Routine toxicological analyses on the blood, carried out to exclude the presence of the main illicit drugs and/or psychotropic substances (alcohol, opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, amphetamines), gave negative results. The detection of thiosulfate in the blood was confirmed by GC/MS analysis, following the method previously published by Poli et al. [3]. Tests for CO and CN were negative. On-site air analyses were performed two hours, twenty days and seventy days after the accident on the air outside the tank near the hatch (closed and open), and on the air inside the tank at various depths. Toxicological and chemical-physical analyses were carried out on the vapor samples taken both inside the buried tank and in the tanker. In the laboratory, the measurement of H2S and SO2 in the air was carried out inside the transport bins containing samples of leachate. All analytical methods used are summarized in Table 3 . All results of the toxicological analyses on the blood of two workers are shown in Table 4 : Environmental analyses performed two hours after the accident revealed an H2S concentration of 102 ppm above the tanker near the front hatch and 153 ppm near the pick-up point from the buried tank. Twenty days later, the concentration measured inside the front hatch was 950 ppm. Although the gas had plenty of opportunity to escape – the hatch was opened by the worker, remained open for a few hours, was reopened for sampling and did not close tightly – even so, seventy days after the accident there was still a lethal concentration as Table 5 shows."
4,Discussion,"The majority of accidents involving hydrogen sulfide poisoning occur in confined spaces where workers are often hit by the rapid ""knockdown"" (acute central neurotoxicity which results in respiratory paralysis and cellular anoxia) that makes them unconscious and thus unable to save themselves. The knockdown is a characteristic sudden and reversible syndrome that occurs in exposures at H2S high concentrations, about 500ppm. If the exposure continues without air movements, the knockdown may be lethal [15]. In the literature, lethal H2S poisonings are reported in workers cleaning sewers, tanks containing oil and rotting organic compounds as well as those working in farm manure pits. In our case, the two workers were outdoors, one on the tanker near the upper hatch, the other on the ground near the tanker. During inspection at the accident scene, hydrogen sulfide poisoning was suspected due to the presence of the typical rotten eggs smell near the tanker. The H2S suddenly and violently escaped from the upper hatch like a geyser and overwhelmed the two workers who had no chance of escaping. After the violent lethal leak from the hatch, the gas cloud became rarefied but the two workers had already died. It is very likely that, during the transfer of the leachate from the buried tank to the tanker, the gas, which must have been already present owing to sulfide’s reaction in an acidic environment, was also sucked up (sulfuric acid is used in the washing tower as a pH corrector to produce neutral salts). The toxicity of H2S determines a series of adverse effects on humans, which can be acute or chronic and which depend on the dose. The threshold of H2S smell perception is very different from one person to another but is reported as 0.02ppm [16]. Above a 20 ppm concentration, in addition to the first health effects (eye irritation), the ability to smell the gas tends to decrease and olfactory paralysis occurs at a concentration of about 100–150 ppm, making it impossible to perceive its unpleasant odor which leads to unconsciousness within a few minutes. At 200–300ppm, respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary edema may result while at concentrations >700ppm cardiopulmonary arrest usually occurs. Above this concentration unconsciousness and death ensue. Exposure to H2S concentrations above 750–1000 ppm even for only a few seconds may also cause a loss of consciousness and may cause cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to asphyxia and respiratory paralysis. This rapid effect ""… like a stroke of lightening"" in the words of Oesterhelweg and Püschel [17] has led to numerous cases of death among rescuers. In our case, the absence of pulmonary edema in the first worker is indicative of rapid death following ""knockdown"" by sudden inhalation of high concentrations of H2S (> 1000ppm), further confirmed by the measurements 70 days after the accident which still found very high concentrations (see Table 3). The presence of edema in the second worker suggests that the inhalation of the gas occurred over a longer period of time. At the time of the event, the second worker was farther away and had enough time to start to move towards his colleague in a rescue attempt but was then overcome as he made this attempt. The autopsy results support analytical data that confirm the workers’ deaths as acute cardio-respiratory failure due to acute H2S gas inhalation. Death occurred extremely quickly for both workers after the inhalation of H2S as is demonstrated by de-epithelialization of the tracheal mucosa, absence of inflammatory infiltration and by the presence of small areas of edema of the lungs since insufficient time had passed to cause an inflammatory response to the trachea or full pulmonary edema. The analyses performed on biological samples of the two workers revealed the presence of thiosulfate in the blood in lethal concentrations. Thiosulfate is the most reliable indicator of H2S poisoning [1,3–5,7–10] as it is the major metabolite and is less volatile than H2S. It is detectable in the blood for far longer and is unaffected by storage conditions [4,7]. Because of its instability, H2S was not detected in the blood. To establish whether death occurred quickly or after a certain period of unconsciousness, it would have been useful to test for thiosulfate in the urine [18], but unfortunately it was not available. In non-fatal cases, exposure to hydrogen sulfide is confirmed only by the presence of thiosulfate in the urine, while in fatal cases the measurement of thiosulfate in the blood is recommended [4,7]. In our case, since the bodies were well preserved, there was clearly no postmortem gas production. Hence the thiosulfate detected was unquestionably from exogenous poisoning. Toxicological analyses on venous blood samples of both victims revealed the presence of thiosulfate (0.01 and 0.04mM/L). These values were compared with data from lethal occupational cases, as shown in Table 6 . These values refer to workers who died in confined spaces, except for two cases. The lethal values range from a minimum of 0.014mM/L to a maximum of 1.93mM/L. Bibliographic data show that the thiosulfate concentrations found in the deceased workers in our case fall in the mid-low range of reported cases. Hence, despite being in a totally open space, the two workers were imprisoned in a cloud of gas that caused their death in the space of a few minutes: the first immediately by knockdown, the second after a few breaths. The thiosulfate blood concentration detected in a case which occurred in open space [10] was about double that in our case but the area from which the gas was released was over 5000m2, far larger than the hatch diameter. Instead in a similar lethal case involving a truck-tanker thiosulfate was absent [21]. The authors attribute death to inhalation of a high concentration of H2S and report that it occurred very quickly. No environmental chemical-analytical data are reported. Regarding the difference in concentration of thiosulfate in the two blood samples (venous and arterial) the workers’ last actions immediately prior death need to be considered. Although they were both engulfed by the cloud of gas, the first worker with a higher concentration than the second, in the last moments of their lives they probably breathed air without or with a low concentration of H2S. In this case the gas escaped suddenly and quickly from the hatch when the tanker was being filled. It did not spread out in the air but instead formed a high concentration cloud around the hatch. Thus this sudden outdoor and very vigorous geyser-like event was a death trap for the two workers as it formed a highly concentrated cloud engulfing workers one after other. While some confined spaces are easily identifiable as such, since the restrictions regarding access, openings and ventilation are clearly marked and the presence of dangerous chemical agents is well-known, it should be noted that some open spaces must also be considered at risk because there is a danger of death or serious injury caused by rapidly evolving toxic substances or dangerous conditions. Many asphyxiating gases are odorless, colorless and tasteless, are not detected by the human sensory apparatus and cause loss of consciousness with no warning signs, so the worker cannot perceive the danger in time. The physical characteristics of the polluting agent must be kept in mind, particularly if it is heavier or lighter than air, in order to predict the gas’s probable course. This leads us to affirm that many fatal injuries could be avoided by using basic prevention and protection measures: greater risk awareness on the part of workers, specific training, safe and shared work procedures, use of suitable equipment (appropriate gas detectors and personal protective equipment). Environmental monitoring is also useful using oxygen sensors and multi-gas analyzers detecting gases present in confined or open spaces."
5,Conclusion,"The present case has shown that workers working in open spaces must adopt the same safety precautions used in confined spaces. Moreover, when there is a risk that H2S may be released, the danger is also extended to those who rush to provide relief. A violent geyser-like release of H2S, even if totally outdoors, can become a death trap for workers and their rescuers."
