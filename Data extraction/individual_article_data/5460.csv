0,Introduction,"All the natural chemical processes are taking place at ambient temperature, aqueous medium with high atom efficiency and specificity with no environmental issue hence they are green. To badge with the prestigious “green” title, chemical processes should follow the 12 principles of green chemistry [1]. In ordinary chemical reactions, selection of non-toxic, non-volatile solvents and minimization of the use of energy with waste prevention are the prime steps towards the greener approach [2]. In this voyage we put our steps by doing the dynamics studies in aqueous medium for a decade [3–17]. The present study is the homogeneous catalytic oxidation of an alicyclic alcohol in aqueous medium, with employment of surfactants as catalyst, minimizing the need of external activation energy and a shorter reaction time is in line with green procedure. Oxidation is a key reaction in synthetic organic chemistry and industrial chemistry [18]. There are several metal based oxidizing agents among which Cr(VI) based oxidizing agents such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), pyridinium dichromate (PDC), imidazolium dichromate (IDC), quinolinium chlorochromate, quinolinium fluorochromate, tributylammonium chlorochromate, quinolinium dichromate, and tripropylammonium halochromates are used for decades [19–21]. These reagents require the use of toxic and volatile organic solvents, for example dichloromethane (DCM), acetone, dimethylformamide (DMF) etc. which step up a great adverse contribution to the atmosphere and mankind [22]. So, we select potassium dichromate which is readily soluble in most abundant, cost-effective, environmentally compatible, non-toxic, and non- inflammable solvent water [23]. The use of chromium (VI) as an oxidizing agent is questionable because of its' toxic and carcinogenic effect on human health [19]. Although chromium (VI) is toxic but generation of trivalent chromium, after 3-electron reduction, is non-toxic one. Even Cr(III) is consumed as nutritional supplement [24,25]. Cyclohexanone is industrially very much useful and prepare billions of kilograms annually for the production of precursor to nylon 6.6, nylon 6 and caprolactam [26]. Cyclohexanone is produced industrially from cyclohexane and in laboratory scale by oxidation of cyclohexanol with NaOCl [27]. In the present work it is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexanol in aqueous medium. Though water is eco-friendly, the solubility of organic substrate in aqueous medium is a major problem. To overcome this aggregated surfactant medium can be brought into play. The aggregated surfactant medium has hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties thus can easily solubilise both organic and inorganic compounds [28–32]. Additionally, surfactant molecule can catalyse homogeneous organic transformation in aqueous medium by forming different types of nano-like aggregates above its critical micelle concentration (CMC) such as micelle, vesicle, and large unilamellar vesicle, reversed micelle etc. [33]. Micellar systems are well suited for catalytic process; the catalytic activity in most cases may arise due to concentration of the two reactants in a small volume of stern layer. At present micellar mediated transformation is of great importance and play key role in different types of research field such as dipeptide-ninhydrine interaction, interactions of cytochrome c with surfactants, physiochemical properties of surfactant mixture, metal remediation, oxidation, Friedel-Crafts reaction, Diels-Alder reaction, ether synthesis, Suzuki and Heck coupling reaction and many more [34–54]. Heteroaromatic metal based complexes can catalyse the oxidation of alcohol [55]. With this concept we can further use of some heteroaromatic substances such as 2-picolinic acid (PA), 2, 2′-bipyridine (bpy) and 1, 10′-phenanthroline (phen) to enhance the rate of reaction. But the study shows that the hetero aromatic substances in this instant are not true catalyst and never co-oxidized but lost by the formation Cr(III)–PA, Cr(III)–bpy, and Cr(III)–phen complexes. They are better termed as promoters [7,14]. Three such types of promoters are also used in the present study. In short in this study we mainly focus on the chromic acid oxidation of cyclohexanol. Here, we used three promoters (PA, bpy, and phen) and three surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), Triton-X-100 (TX-100) in aqueous medium at room temperature and pressure. After the oxidation is over surfactants remain unreacted in the reaction mixture and can be recycled."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Cyclohexanol (99.0%, AR, SRL, India), K2Cr2O7 (99.9%, AR, BDH, India), H2SO4 (98%, AR, Merck, India), sodium dodecylsulfate (>90%, AR, Merck, India), N-cetylpyridinium chloride (98.0%, AR, SRL, India), Triton X-100 (98%, AR, HIMEDIA, India), 2-picolinic acid (99%, AR, Sigma Aldrich, UK), 2, 2′-bipyridine (99%, AR, Spectrochem, India), 1, 10-phenanthroline (99.5%, AR, Merck, India), deuterium oxide (D2O) (99.9%, AR, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), chloroform-d (CDCl3) (99.8%, AR, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Double distilled water was used for the preparation of required solutions. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Procedure and kinetic measurements,"2.2 Procedure and kinetic measurements All the kinetic data were collected under pseudo 1st order reaction condition at 30 °C by keeping concentration of cyclohexanol 20 fold excess over the concentration of oxidant potassium dichromate in 0.5 mol dm−3 H2SO4 medium. All the solutions were thermostated at 30 °C (±0.1 °C) separately and the oxidation reactions were initiated by mixing the oxidant (5 × 10−4 mol dm−3) to the substrate solution (100 × 10−4 mol dm−3) in 0.5 mol dm−3 H2SO4 in the presence and absence of surfactant (SDS, CPC, TX-100) and promoter (PA, bpy, phen). The progress of the reactions were monitored by double beam UV–Visible spectrophotometer [UV–VIS 1800 and UV–VIS 2450 (SHIMADZU)] fitted with temperature controller. All the solutions were prepared by using Sartorius BSA224S-CW balance and Digital Ultrasonic Cleaner CD 4820 sonicator. IR spectra were recorded by Perkin Elmer Spectrum 2. Bruker Ascend 400 MHz spectrometer was utilized for 1H NMR study. No other reactants except Cr(VI) and product show significant absorbance at 450 nm. Under experimental conditions, the possibility of decomposition of the surfactants by Cr(VI) was also negligible."
4,Product analysis and stoichiometry,"2.3 Product analysis and stoichiometry After the completion of the reaction (appearance of pale blue colour in unpromoted and pale violet colour in promoted reactions), the reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether, evaporation of the solvent followed by fractional distillation results in two liquids with boiling points of 155.5 °C (cyclohexanone, literature value 156 °C) and 161 °C (cyclohexanol) [56]. With a small portion of the lower boiling liquid 2, 4-DNP derivative was made in HCl medium [57]. The yellow coloured 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone was recrystallized with ethanol and melting point was obtained as 162 °C [56]. The product cyclohexanone was also confirmed by the IR and 1H NMR spectral analysis. Under pseudo-first order condition excess of substrate (cyclohexanol) is present in reaction mixture as compared to the Cr(VI), so it is expected that at the end of reaction Cr(VI) ion will be totally reduced to Cr(III). Hence the possibility of hexavalent chromium mixing into the industrial effluent through drainage is minimum. The existence of Cr(III) in the product mixture was evident from the absorption maximum found at 580 nm (pure Cr(III) solution show λmax at 580 nm) [58,59]. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined by spectrophotometric titration. Known concentrations of Cr(VI) and varying concentrations of cyclohexanol solutions were reacted at constant [H+] = 0.5 mol dm−3. The absorbances were measured at 580 nm, after the completion of the reaction a steady absorbance value over a period of three days was observed. Stoichiometric analysis showed that 2 mol of chromic acid was consumed by 3 mol of cyclohexanol (Eq. (1)). After the completion of the reaction surfactants were recycled by means of precipitation by counter ion in case of ionic surfactants and by thermal precipitation method in case of non-ionic surfactant [16,46]. (1) 2.3.1 IR spectral analysis IR spectrum of cyclohexanone shows characteristic carbonyl stretching frequency at 1715 cm−1 (Fig. 1(a)), whereas its 2,4-DNP derivative shows peaks due to NH symmetric stretching at 3307 cm−1 and CN stretching frequency appeared at 1618 cm−1 (Fig. 1(b)). 2.3.2 1H NMR spectral analysis 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2 ) of the product was recorded at 400 MHz in CDCl3 solvent. Chemical shifts (ppm) were internally referenced to the TMS are reported in Table 1 ."
5,Result and discussion,
6,UV–VIS spectral analysis,"3.1 UV–VIS spectral analysis The progress of the reactions was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance of Cr(VI) with time at 450 nm (Fig. 3 ). The Pseudo 1st order rate constants (k obs) were calculated from the plot of −ln(A450) vs. time in second plots (Fig. 4 ). Half life for each reaction was evaluated from the relation t1/2 = 0.693/k obs. The rate constants and half lives of reactions are tabulated in Table 2 . Inspections of the table revel that the rate of micellar catalysed reactions are greater than that of the uncatalysed reactions. Promoters enhanced the rate to a greater extent whereas the combination of promoter and the micellar catalyst gives a 600 fold increase in the rate constants. The UV spectral analysis of unpromoted reactions indicate the formation in Cr(III) species as evident from the appearance of the two new peaks at 580 nm and 265 nm and the final colour of the solution become pale blue (Fig. S1). The new peaks are due to the 4A2g (F) → 4T2g (F) and 4A2g (F) → 4T1g (F) transition in Cr(III) [60,61]. The same is true in case of micellar catalysed reactions. This is similar with the spectral property of chromic sulphate in aqueous sulphuric acid medium. But in promoted reaction the final species is not purely Cr(III) but Cr(III)- promoter complex as was evident from spectra and final pale violet colour of the solutions (Fig. S2) [62]. Here the 4A2g (F) → 4T2g (F) transition shows a shifts towards lower wave length λmax = 552, 546 and 565 nm for phen, bpy and PA-promoted reactions, respectively due to the presence of more strong field hetero aromatic ligands whereas the transition 4A2g (F) → 4T1g (F) merges with the charge transfer band in the visible region due to the metal to ligand charge transfer involving vacant antibonding π* orbitals of the promoters [61–63]. The appearance of charge transfer bands at visible region strongly suggests the formation of Cr(III)-promoter complex in the final solution of promoted path. Further analysis of each UV–VIS spectra in the wavelength region 600 nm to 350 nm suggest that under the experimental condition the concentration of intermediate like Cr(V) and Cr(IV) are very low as only a single isobestic point was observed in each reaction [64]. Some of the absorption spectra are given in Fig. S3 with their isobestic points. SDS catalysed bpy promoted reaction was too fast to record scanned spectra in the entire said region."
7,Mechanism of the reaction,"3.2 Mechanism of the reaction Product analysis shows that cyclohexanone is the product of chromic acid oxidation of cyclohexanol. The mechanism of the reaction can be divided into two categories (i) Unpromoted path and (ii) promoted path. 3.2.1 Oxidation in absence of the promoter Though potassium dichromate in aqueous acid medium forms chromic acid (A), The predominating species in aqueous medium is HCrO4 − (B) as the protonation constant of B is very low [65]. Chromic acid oxidation of cyclohexanol is a well-known reaction and hence the variations of substrate concentration, acid concentration are not done here [66]. We are mainly interested in the promoted path of the reaction and the catalytic effect of the surfactants in both the path. Based on the previous work the mechanism of the unpromoted reaction can be proposed as in Scheme 1 [66,67]. In the proposed mechanism cyclohexanol in its more stable conformation (equatorial) reacts with chromic acid to form a neutral ester. In the next step (slowest step, rate determining step) via the hydrogen ion transfer in a five membered cyclic transition state cyclohexanone is formed along with some Cr(IV) species, which readily degrade to Cr(III) via different possible routes [68,69]. Here k 1 is the rate constant for unpromoted reaction. 3.2.2 Oxidation in presence of the promoter Form Table 2 it is clear that the rate of promoted reactions is greater than that of unpromoted reactions. It is demonstrated earlier that after the reaction Cr(III)-promoter complex are formed. We know that Cr(III) is kinetically inert so it could be expected that initially Cr(VI)-promoter complexes are formed and these are the active oxidants in the promoted path (Schemes 2–3 , AO+ are the active oxidants). In fact spectroscopic analysis suggests the formation of such type of active oxidants (Fig. S4). Previous reports of NMR study and emission spectral analysis also strongly suggest the formation of active oxidant complexes [16,70–72]. Here among three promoters phen shows higher rate of oxidation compared to PA and bpy. The used promotes are the chelating agents with N, N or N, O donors and form chelated complex with Cr(VI). In 1,10-phenanthroline both the donating N atom are always cis with three stable aromatic ring, so the rate of formation of active oxidant is higher in case of phen and this may be attributed to the enhanced rate of oxidation. For 2, 2′-bipyridine more stable conformer is s-trans and hence an activation barrier is there to change the conformation to s-cis prior to the formation of active oxidant. This causes a relative reduction in the rate of reaction. 2-Picolinic acid is depriving of more aromatic stabilization (in bpy two aromatic rings and in phen three aromatic rings) and the presence of more electronegative O atom affect the rate a greater extent. Rate increase with increase in the concentration of each reactant suggests that the rate equation is dependent to 1st power of the promoter concentration (Fig. 5 ). The mechanisms of the promoted reactions are shown in Schemes 2 and 3. 3.2.3 Oxidation in presence of the surfactant 3.2.3.1 Micellar catalysed unpromoted path All the three surfactants SDS, TX 100 and CPC show a rate enhancing effect on the oxidation above their CMC (Fig. 6 ). Alcohol oxidation by Cr(VI) in aqueous phase depends on two steps i.e. the formation of the neutral chromate ester and acid catalysed decomposition of chromate ester. In aqueous acid medium the dominating Cr(VI) species is HCrO4 − but in the presence micellar media formation of H2CrO4 is favoured through the protonation of HCrO4 − to facilitate the binding of Cr(VI) species on the micellar surface [65]. As electrostatic repulsion is present, binding of the anionic species, HCrO4 − on the anionic SDS micellar surface is unfavourable. But the neutral species H2CrO4 through an ion–dipole interaction and hydrogen bonding can bind on the micellar surface [65]. In fact, Cr(VI) as H2CrO4 can bind with the micellar surface(Stern layer) of cationic, neutral and anionic surfactants hence rate enhancement is observed with the alcohol present in the stern layer of the micelle projecting its nonpolar part towards the hydrophobic core. The greater rate in case of SDS may be explained considering the acid catalysed decomposition step i.e. rate determining step. H+ can approach the chromate ester present in the anionic SDS micelle with greater ease, resulting rate enhancement. The cationic CPC micelle should repel H+ and retard the reaction. The present study shows no retardation but acceleration of the rate, though the rate acceleration is minimum for CPC compared to the anionic and non-ionic micelle. The slower rate in CPC can be explained by the reduced positive charge on the polar head of the micellar aggregate. Research revel that the positive charge is not located only on N atom of CPC but spread along the entire surfactant molecule [73]. Recent research on cationic micellar system also shows a reduction in the charge of the head group via the H-bonding interaction with the alcohol present in the micellar system [74]. As the charge is reduced so H+ can easily combine with chromate ester results in rate acceleration. The non-ionic micelle shows an intermediate reaction rate (Fig. 7 ). 3.2.3.2 Micellar catalysed promoted path From the mechanism of the promoted reaction it is clear that at first an active oxidant (AO+) is formed. As the active oxidant is positively charged so when the promoted reaction occurs in micellar media it is expected that SDS micelle shows a higher rate due to electrostatic attraction followed by the neutral TX 100 micelle and reduced positively charged CPC micelle (Fig.8 ). We have already seen the cause of increased rates in promoted path and the same reasoning can be extended for the micellar catalysed promoted path. So we may expect k obs(phen) > k obs(bpy)>. k obs(PA) in micellar media. In fact except SDS other two systems shows the expected trend. In addition to the electrostatic force there may be some pi-pi interaction between the active oxidants and the aromatic sextet of TX 100 and CPC. As the number of pi electrons is higher in phen so it shows higher rate followed by the other two. In SDS micellar medium k obs(bpy) > k obs(phen) > k obs(PA) is observed. There is no pi-pi interaction present in SDS medium but a repulsive interaction between pi-electron cloud of the active oxidant and negatively charged SDS may present beside the electrostatic attraction force. Consideration of attraction force alone, the rate should be k obs(bpy) ≈ k obs(phen) > k obs(PA) in SDS medium, as AO+ of bpy and phen are bi-positive whereas that of PA is uni-positive. Consideration of repulsive force leads to k obs(PA) > k obs(bpy) > k obs(phen) as pi electron cloud density increases in the given order. Consideration of these two factors together along with the arguments of promoted path give the actual experimental result in SDS micelle which is k obs(bpy) > k obs(phen) > k obs(PA) (Fig. S5)."
8,Interaction between cyclohexanol and surfactants,"3.3 Interaction between cyclohexanol and surfactants We have discussed the mechanism of micellar catalysed paths depending on the clustering of reactants in the stern layer of the micelle. Now to verify whether or not actually the reactant molecules reside in the stern layer we have performed some NMR studies with surfactants above their CMC and cyclohexanol together. Previously DLS, 2D NOESY and HRTEM studies were done to confirm any sort of interaction between surfactants and alcohols [16,33,42]. As we are concern with the interaction at the stern layer of the micelle with cyclic alcohol, so the chemical shifts of the hydrogens at polar head of the surfactant is of interest. In SDS-cyclohexanol interaction a distinct downfield shifts of α and β protons are observed (Table 3 ). It is quite obvious if we consider the charge distribution model, it is seen that α carbon of SDS is partially positive charged [73]. So there may be an interaction between α H of SDS with O atom of the alcohol in addition to the hydrogen boding interaction between O of sulphate group and –OH group of alcohol (Fig.S6). In contrast an upfield shifts of protons in polar head group of TX 100 surfactant is observed (Table 4 ).This is due to increase in electron density near the head group region by the presence of alcoholic OH group in addition to the ether linkage (Fig. S7). CPC shows an intermediate trend. Here α and (a, a′) protons are in upfield region where as β, (b, b′), c protons are in downfield. An electronic interaction between electronegative O atom and positively charged N atom in the head group cause a reduction in the −I effect of N atom, as a result α and (a, a′) protons are now more shielded causing upfield shifts. A close proximity of OH proton with b, b′ and c protons cause a distinct downfield shift with modified coupling behaviour (Table 5 ). The large downfield shift of β protons are probably their closeness with the deshielding zone of cyclohexyl ring (Fig. S8)."
9,Conclusion,"Previously we have reported the oxidation kinetics of different kind of substrate but this is the first report of oxidation of an alicyclic system from our end [3–17]. In this article we have presented a detailed study of cyclohexanol oxidation by chromic acid in presence and absence of surfactants and promoters. The cyclic alcohol shows a moderate oxidation rate which could be enhanced by the presence of surfactants above their CMC. Among the three surfactants SDS shows a greater rate, k obs (SDS) > k obs (TX 100) > k obs (CPC). When promoters are used rate is further enhanced and phen shows higher rate, k obs (phen) > k obs (bpy) > k obs (PA). Promoters and surfactants together bring the half life of oxidation to few minutes; the best combination is SDS and bpy which gives a 600 fold enhancement in the rate of the reaction."
