0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean carbon-free fuel that oxidizes to water as its combustion product, without any pollution. It is an ideal secondary energy carrier with high energy density, whose heating value per unit mass is much higher than alcohols or hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen production by dark fermentation has drawn significant attention over past few decades because of its low cost, rapid bacteria growth, high hydrogen producing capacity and abundant feedstocks [1–3]. Among a large number of microorganisms, facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacter, and strict anaerobes such as Clostridium, are efficient producers of hydrogen through fermentative pathways [4–6]. Enterobacter strains are considered to be more suitable than Clostridium or Escherichia for industrial scale hydrogen production due to their rapid growth rates, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources, and low sensitivity to dissolved oxygen, H2 pressure and pH [7,8]. Characteristics of fermentative hydrogen production with Enterobacter aerogenes strains, such as HU-101, HO-39, and E-82005, have been studied before [9–11]. However, the H2 yields of these strains are only about 1 mol/mol-glucose. Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08, isolated and characterized as a strain with high potential for hydrogen production, has a H2 yield of 2.2 mol/mol-glucose [7]. According to the theoretical yield of 4 mol/mol-glucose in dark fermentation, it is necessary to enhance the hydrogen producing ability of Enterobacter for large-scale hydrogen production. Hydrogen is produced by Enterobacter species through two pathways. One is the formate decomposition pathway, which evolves hydrogen by formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) from formate produced by glycolysis [12]. The other is the NADH pathway, which produces hydrogen by hydrogenase through the re-oxidation of NADH produced via glycolysis [13]. Hydrogenase is a key factor in proton transfer process during hydrogen production. Several studies have elucidated that hydrogenase activity can be enhanced via genetic methods to improve hydrogen production. Information about hydrogenase genes and their products has been reported from a few Clostridia, for example, [FeFe]-hydrogenase Ⅰ of Clostirdium pasteurianum, hydrogenase A of C. perfringens, C. acetobutylicum P262, and C. paraputrificum [14–16]. Furthermore, some investigators have also reported heterologous expression of hydrogenase gene in the genetic engineering bacteria Escherichia coli. Maeda et al. isolated a cyanobacterial hydrogenase and performed over-expression studies in E. coli TG1 and BW25113 strains to improve hydrogen production [17]. Mishra et al. identified what they termed a novel [FeFe]-hydrogenase (hydA) from a high rate of hydrogen producing E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 and characterized the feasibility studies on the fermentative hydrogen production by recombinant E. coli BL-21 [18,19]. However, the nucleotide sequence of the smallest [FeFe]-hydrogenase shares no homology with those of several known [FeFe]-hydrogenases, yet it reportedly retains a high catalytic activity [7,19,20]. Tosatto et al. analyzed the structural features and made a hypothesis on the structure–function relationship of the particular [FeFe]-hydrogenase protein, which missed regulatory sub-domain, presumably allowing higher enzymatic activity at the cost of greater exposure to oxygen inactivation [21]. Although the protein of interest has been called “hydA” in previous literature, critical evaluation of the protein sequence of this supposed hydrogenase reveals that it lacks sufficient similarity to any actual hydA protein in other species. Here, we investigate the role of this protein, and designate it as simply a “hydrogen-promoting protein” (HPP) in a species of Enterobacter which already has hydrogen evolution capabilities. As opposed to E. coli, no strain of E. cloacae has a genome that has been fully sequenced, and many strains of E. cloacae have some antibiotic resistance. In nature, the distribution of E. cloacae is more wide, and antimicrobial resistance rates in E. cloacae are higher than those to E. aerogenes [22,23]. It is therefore more difficult to do genetic modification and mutant selection with E. cloacae. In this study, the gene of the HPP was amplified and over-expressed with a reconstructed shuttle vector in E. cloacae CICC10017 for the first time to enhance hydrogen production, and hydrogenase activities of the parental and recombinant strains were tested. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure the aqueous by-products, demonstrating that over-expression of a single structural gene results in a redistribution of fermentative fluxes to more oxidized soluble carbon products and a 2-fold increase in in vivo hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and genetic modification,"2.1 Bacterial strains and genetic modification E. cloacae CICC10017 was purchased from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection. The coding region of the gene (GenBank Accession no. AY676139) from E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 was amplified from a synthesized template (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Co., Ltd., China) with forward (Fw 5′-GGATCC ATGTTCGGCGATCAGTTC-3′) and reverse (Rv 5′-CTCGAG TCAGCCGCCCGGGCAGGC-3′) primers. The recombinant plasmids pGEX-4T-2-Cat/HPP, which were reconstructed by Zhao et al. [24] for gene transformation in our previous study, were transformed into competent E. cloacae CICC10017 cells by electroporation to produce a GST-fusion protein in this study. The E. cloacae CICC10017, recombinant strains and E. coli DH5a (a host for genetic manipulation) were all grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g peptone, and 10 g NaCl per liter) medium in an incubator shaker at 220 rpm until the cultures reached mid-log phase. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) were added into the growth medium for selection of recombinants. Then, the E. cloacae CICC10017 and the recombinant strain E. cloacae CICC10017/HPP were cultivated with 1 mM Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) used as an inducer in the H2-producing medium."
3,SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis,2.2 SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis The recombinant strain containing the HPP gene (pGEX-4T-2-cat/HPP) was grown aerobically overnight in 5 ml LB media containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. This seed culture (100 μl) was inoculated into 5 ml LB medium (without chloramphenicol) in a shaker for 2 h. The cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG and further grown for 4 h hermetically. The cells were then centrifuged and lysed by sonication. The lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Over-expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed by western blot analysis with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham–Pharmacia).
4,Hydrogen production by fermentation,"2.3 Hydrogen production by fermentation The overnight seed culture (1 ml) of E. cloacae CICC10017 and the recombinant E. cloacae CICC10017/HPP were inoculated into 100 ml of LB medium, respectively. The batch cultivations were performed aerobically in an incubator shaker (220 rpm) at 37 °C for 2 h. 1 mM IPTG as an inducer was added into both strains, which were then cultivated in an incubator shaker (180 rpm) at 37 °C until the cells grew to mid-log phase. The cells were then added into 200 ml fermentative medium composed of 3 g glucose, 0.03 g FeCl2, 1 ml vitamin liquid [25], and 1 ml microelement liquid [25]. A 300 ml fermentation reactor was purged with N2 gas for 10 min to create an anaerobic environment. The pH value was adjusted to 6 ± 0.2 by adding 6 M NaOH into the fermenter during hydrogen fermentation at 37 °C. The compositions of biogas (H2 and CO2) derived from dark fermentation were determined on a gas chromatograph (GC) (SP3400, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operation temperatures of the injection port, oven and detector were 50, 50 and 100 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. All biological samples were prepared in at least triplicate."
5,Hydrogenase assay,"2.4 Hydrogenase assay The hydrogenase activities of E. cloacae CICC10017 and the recombinant strain E. cloacae CICC10017/HPP were quantified by the amount of H2 evolved from Na-dithionite reduced methyl viologen (MV) [26–28]. A 1 ml aliquot of culture from actively fermenting cells was taken from each of the two strains (transformed and control) and moved into a 13 ml sealed vial, which was purged with N2 gas in advance. The cells in the fermentative liquid were lysed anerobically with glass beads in 2 ml anaerobic induction buffer (AIB, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KH2PO4, and 40 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.8) and 200 μl Na-dithionite solution (30 mM NaOH, 100 mM Na-dithionite). The total 3.2 ml lysed liquid was bubbled with N2 gas to remove trace dissolved oxygen. Then, 2 ml MV buffer (50 mM K2HPO4, 50 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM MV, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) was added. The hydrogenase released from the lysed cells was used to produce hydrogen from the reduced MV. Hydrogen gas produced from these 5.2 ml suspensions and accumulated in the 7.8 ml headspace was detected on a GC (SP3400, China). The triplicate experiments for all the conditions were performed to give the average data, and anaerobic induction buffer without cells was taken as control."
6,Analysis of metabolic by-products,"2.5 Analysis of metabolic by-products The metabolites including formate, acetate, butyrate, lactate and ethanol derived from fermentation were determined on an NMR spectrometer (Bruker Avance-Ⅱ, 500 MHz). The fermentative liquid sampled periodically in H2 production was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. 500 μl of the cell-free supernatant was pipetted into pyrex NMR tubes (Norell Inc., Landisville, NJ, USA), into which 100 μl of D2O containing 2 mg/ml 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4-acid, sodium salt (TSP) (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louise, MO, USA) was added. All proton NMR experiments were run at 295 K using the TopSpin 2.1/ICON software with 128 scans. Excitation sculpting was adopted to suppress the water signal as the 1H2O signal is otherwise much larger than those of metabolites in the samples [29]. Spectra were processed using MestRe-C v.4.9.9.6 software (Mestrelab Research S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The phase and baseline were manually corrected, and integral ratios of metabolite peaks relative to TSP were also performed manually. The metabolite concentrations were calculated based on standard samples prepared separately."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Over-expression of the HPP gene in E. cloacae CICC10017,"3.1 Over-expression of the HPP gene in E. cloacae CICC10017 The HPP gene used in this study is small in size, 444 bp only, but it contains all the necessary features required for the active protein. With the strong promoter provided by the shuttle vector pGEX-4T-2-Cat, the HPP gene is successfully over-expressed in E. cloacae CICC10017 (Fig. 1 ). GST-tag is 26 kD, and the HPP is 17 kD, so the fusion protein should be 43 kD. Molecular weight of the GST-tagged HPP is estimated to be about 43 kD from SDS-PAGE analysis."
9,Hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity,"3.2 Hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity Firstly, hydrogen fermentation from glucose using E. cloacae CICC10017 and the recombinant strain E. cloacae CICC10017/HPP was performed respectively with the results shown in Fig. 2 . The volume yield of H2 produced during fermentation is calculated from volume of biogas multiplied by composition ratio of the H2 fraction. The wild strain gives the peak rate at around 12 h with a hydrogen producing rate of 38.9 ml/(L·h), as shown in Fig. 2a. It takes longer time for the recombinant strain to give a peak hydrogen rate of 70.8 ml/(L·h), which is significantly higher than that of the wild strain. This may due to a higher demand in energy for synthesis of more HPP for the recombinant strain, which leads to a lower reproduction speed of the cells and the later peak rate. With more HPP at around 24 h, a much higher peak rate appears for the recombinant strain. Fig. 2b shows that cumulative H2 yield of the recombinant strain with the over-expressed HPP is promoted from 284.1 ml to 427.3 ml. A control condition in which only void GST was over-expressed was carried out. The fermentative H2 production rate and cumulative H2 yield in the control condition were almost the same as the results using the wild strain. After 12 h of fermentation, the pH of the fermentative solution was adjusted to 6, and then the liquid samples during H2 fermentation were removed into 13 ml sealed vials. After being purged with N2 for 2 min, the samples were cultured anaerobically for another 2 h, then used for hydrogenase assays. The hydrogenase activity is defined as the hydrogen yield from one gram of cells in dry weight (DW) per hour. As shown in Fig. 3 , the slope of fitting curves represents the hydrogenase activity. Hydrogenase activity of the recombinant strain with the over-expressed HPP is as high as 534.78 ± 18.51 ml/(g-DW·h), which is 97.4% higher than the wild strain of 270.93 ± 22.65 ml/(g-DW·h). This result demonstrates that over-expression of a single structural gene (HPP) is sufficient for increasing active hydrogenase in cells, without need for over-expression of endogenous maturation proteins. The protein of interest is effective in promoting hydrogen production, either by acting as a hydrogenase itself, or by promoting expression of the endogenous NiFe hydrogenase in the cell."
10,Enhancing hydrogen production by E. cloacae/HPP with nitrogen source,"3.3 Enhancing hydrogen production by E. cloacae/HPP with nitrogen source The cell concentration and the hydrogen production profile were found to be maximum in the exponential phase of the growth [19]. In order to get a maximum hydrogen yield with the recombinant strain, MYG medium (nitrogen source) containing 1% (w/v) malt extract and 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract was added into the initial fermentation medium (lack of nitrogen source) [30]. MYG medium provides sufficient nutrition for the growth and reproduction of the cells during fermentation, so more hydrogen will be produced. The cumulative hydrogen production is markedly increased from 480.32 ± 25.84 ml of the wild strain to 949.92 ± 36.96 ml of the recombinant strain, as shown in Fig. 4 . In another word, the hydrogen yield increased from 1.29 ± 0.07 mol/mol-glucose to 2.54 ± 0.1 mol/mol-glucose after the over-expression of the HPP, improved by 97.9%. A control with MYG medium only (without glucose) was used and produced little hydrogen."
11,Redistribution of metabolite products due to over-expression of the HPP gene,"3.4 Redistribution of metabolite products due to over-expression of the HPP gene By measuring fermentation medium with respect to incubation time, the liquid by-products during hydrogen fermentation using the two strains with nitrogen source were determined. Excreted metabolites mainly contain ethanol, acetate, butyrate, lactate, and formate for both strains. Aqueous solutions containing ethanol, acetate, butyrate, lactate, and formate at five known concentrations were prepared and measured by NMR, and standard calibration curves were generated according to the results. The integrals of peaks due to different metabolites are linearly (R 2 > 0.9999) correlated with their concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM (at least) when measured with 1H NMR protocol. Some metabolites (ethanol, butyrate, and lactate) give rise to peaks at more than one chemical shift, in which case the one least likely to overlap with peaks from other species is chosen to calculate the integrals. The variation trends of metabolite concentrations during H2 fermentation are calculated based on the standard calibration curves, as shown in Fig. 5 . Among the metabolites of both strains, ethanol is produced during initial 12 h mainly, after which production nearly ceases. Acetate and butyrate gradually increase during fermentation, while formate and lactate first increase and then decrease. Ethanol, acetate, and butyrate are final by-products, which could not be reutilized by the cell, resulting in the increase of their concentrations. Formate is produced during glycolysis process and then decomposed by FHL to produce hydrogen [12]. Lactate, which is produced with a low concentration, might be consumed partly by the metabolism of the cell [31,32]. Comparing the liquid by-products of the two strains from Fig. 5a and b, it can be seen that after hydrogen fermentation, the final concentration of ethanol is less: from 32.7 ± 1.4 mM of the wild strain to 21.6 ± 0.8 mM of the recombinant strain, while that of acetate and butyrate is significantly larger: from 7.8 ± 0.5 mM and 6.6 ± 0.5 mM to 21 ± 1.1 mM and 16.3 ± 0.1 mM, respectively. This transformation of metabolism corresponds to the enhancement of hydrogen yield with the recombinant strain. According to the metabolism pathways of glucose as substrate, pyruvate is produced from glucose and subsequently converted into acetyl coenzyme A, which is the precursor of ethanol, acetate, and butyrate. During this degradation process, NADH is released as reducing equivalents, which need to be re-oxidation by producing reduced products such as hydrogen, ethanol, and organic acids. The consumption of NADH for generation of hydrogen, ethanol, and butyrate is 1 mol/mol, 2 mol/mol, and 2 mol/mol, respectively, while generation of acetate needs no NADH [33]. However, butyrate consumes less NADH per carbon because butyrate is a 4 carbon product, and ethanol is only 2. 2 ethanol or 1 butyrate can be produced from per glucose consumed, and 2 ethanol consume 4 NADH while 1 butyrate only consumes 2 NADH. During the fermentation process, more NADH is consumed to produce hydrogen with the recombinant strain because of the over-expression of the HPP, resulting in less NADH for ethanol production which needs more reducing equivalents from the glucose consumed. The carbon flux is more directed to the production of acetate and butyrate, which consumes no or less NADH. Thus the over-expression of HPP modifies the metabolic pathways. In the wild-type strain, less hydrogen is produced and the metabolism favors ethanol production to maintain the balance of reducing equivalents inside the cell [34]. Correspondingly, less acetate or butyrate is produced. Table 1 shows the fermentation carbon/reductant fluxes in both strains. From 1 g glucose consumed, 160.1 ml H2 is produced with the wild strain, and the by-products are mainly 10.9 mM ethanol, 2.9 mM formate, 2.6 mM acetate, 2.2 mM butyrate, and 0.5 mM lactate. When the recombinant strain is used, 316.6 ml H2 is produced from 1 g glucose consumed, and the by-products are mainly 7.2 mM ethanol, 3.2 mM formate, 7.0 mM acetate, 5.4 mM butyrate, and 0.6 mM lactate."
12,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates the over-expression of the HPP gene improves the hydrogen yield of E. cloacae CICC10017. Hydrogenase activity of the recombinant strain is 534.78 ± 18.51 ml/(g-DW·h), increased by 97.4% of the wild strain. The peak hydrogen producing rate of the recombinant strain is 70.8 ml/(L·h). When MYG medium is used during hydrogen fermentation, the hydrogen yield of the recombinant strain is 2.55 ± 0.1-mol/mol-glucose, which is 97.9% higher than the wild strain. Liquid by-products of hydrogen production are mainly ethanol, acetate, butyrate, lactate, and formate. Compared to the wild strain, the recombinant strain produces more acetate and butyrate during hydrogen fermentation, but less ethanol, which is corresponding to the metabolism of NADH in the cell. It is necessary to purify the heterologous HPP and study its inherent characters (e.g. the sequence and activity of the purified HPP) in the future."
