0,Introduction,
1,Combustion synthesis,"1.1 Combustion synthesis Combustion synthesis (CS) is a well-known technique for the synthesis of advanced materials [1–3]. This process is characterized by a fast heating rate (up to 106 K/s) and short reaction time (10−3 to 10s). It is also an energy efficient method since the heat of reaction provides the energy required for the material synthesis. There are two modes in which CS can occur. First, the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis mode in which the reaction is locally initiated by an external source (tungsten coil, laser, etc.) and then the reaction front moves in a self-sustained manner along the reaction media without requiring any additional energy. Second, is the Volume Combustion Synthesis (VCS) mode, where the entire sample is preheated uniformly in a controlled manner until it reaches the ignition temperature and the reaction takes place simultaneously throughout the bulk of the specimen. Using conventional CS of solid powders, a wide variety of highly pure advanced materials including oxides are obtained but the specific surface area of these products is relatively low. To synthesize nano-size powders another variation of this approach, known as solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is widely used [4–6]. In this method different oxidizers (e.g. metal nitrites) and organic fuels (e.g. glycine) are dissolved in water in the desired ratio to make an aqueous homogeneous reactive solution. It has been shown that such reactive solution can be self-ignited in a similar way to that of the VCS mode. Due to the combination of different processes, including low reaction temperatures, extensive gas evolution and high homogeneity of the reaction media, this method gives extremely fine particles with a high specific surface area than in VCS [7–9]. Essentially all the SCS related studies reported in the literature used the less controllable VCS mode. To restrain the explosive nature of the volume combustion mode, another more tunable approach known as solution layer combustion synthesis has been developed [10]. It was shown that under optimized conditions a layer of a sol–gel type solution media can be locally ignited at one end to start the combustion front propagation. Solution layer combustion synthesis has two major advantages over the previously mentioned CS methods. First, it eliminates the preheating stage, since once ignited, the combustion front propagates without requiring any additional energy. Second, a fast cooling rate in the thin reaction front in contact with the surface holding the sol layer decreases the temperature and thus sintering, yielding a product with even finer particle size and thus higher specific surface area. To further improve the product textural properties and enhance control of the combustion process, the so-called, impregnated layer combustion synthesis (ILCS) method has been developed [11,12]. In this case the reactive solution is impregnated in a media that can be inert (e.g. a porous oxide support [11]) or reactive (e.g. cellulose paper [12]). In the later case, the cellulose paper itself can also act as a fuel to increase the exothermicity of weakly exothermic systems. The absence of explosion in this method led to a continuous catalysts preparation technology with high product yield [13]. Recently, we presented results of multi-component catalysts for the oxidative reforming of methanol (ORM) to produce hydrogen [14]. In this study we report results obtained using the ILCS method and variations of this methodology that yielded even more active and selective catalysts for the ORM reaction than previously obtained by standard co-precipitation methods."
2,Oxidative reforming of methanol,"1.2 Oxidative reforming of methanol Interest in fuel cell utilization has led to the investigation of hydrogen production from hydrogen containing sources. Abstraction of hydrogen from methanol can be accomplished in many ways. Methanol decomposition and methanol steam reforming are both endothermic and require external energy supply to maintain the reaction [15,16]. The exothermic nature of the methanol partial oxidation reaction, or ORM [15,17] and its reduced tendency to form carbon monoxide [18,19] makes ORM a promising alternative for hydrogen production: (1) C H 3 OH + 1 2 O 2 → C O 2 + 2 H 2 Δ H r = 192 kcal/mol Methanol decomposition to CO and H2 has been examined by many research groups using different catalysts. For example, noble metal chlorides [20] RuCI3, RhCl3, PdCl2, OsCl3, IrCl3 and H2PtCl6 supported on Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 were studied for the decomposition reaction at 573K. Salts such as CuCl-KCl, CuCl-ZnCl2-KCl, loaded up to 50wt% on SiO2, Al2O3 and ZnSiO3 have been reported to enhance the methanol decomposition [18]. Pure Pd supported on ZrO2, La2O3, SiO2, CeO2, Pr2O3 and TiO2 has shown excellent activity for the decomposition reaction [21,22]. Methanol decomposition has also been reported to occur on copper in combination with such elements as Zn, Zr, Ni, Cr, Mn, Si, Ba [24–26]. It was also shown that methanol decomposition is also catalyzed by Pd on ZnO and ZrO2 [30], Cu/Cr [31], Cu-Zn/SiO2 [32], Ce and Zr promoted Cu/Zn/Pd [33], Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 [23]. Literature analysis show that most of the catalysts for this reaction include Cu, Zr, ZnO [27,28], Pd and group VIII metal oxides [29,30]. Selection of the catalysts composition for this work was based on the results of previous studies [14,34] that have been conducted in our group that led to the optimized molar ratio for complex cooper-based catalyst consisting of 7CuO/3ZnO/1ZrO2, in which 7/3/1 refers to their molar metal ratios."
3,Experimental,
4,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Aqueous solutions of metal nitrates (Sigma–Aldrich) M υ (NO3) υ ·xH2O (where Me=Cu, Zr, Zn, or Pd) and glycine (CH5NO2, as fuel) were used to synthesize catalysts in three combustion synthesis modes, i.e. VCS, ILCS and a novel combination of the ILCS+VCS, or second wave impregnation (SWI) method. The following stoichiometric reaction takes place during the combustion process to yield the metal oxide: (2) where φ denotes the fuel to oxidizer ratio with φ =1 corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio, i.e. the oxidizers contain theoretically the equivalent amount of oxygen required to complete the reaction, while φ >1 means fuel rich and φ <1 fuel lean conditions respectively. In the ILCS method a homogeneous solution of metal nitrates and fuel is impregnated in a cellulose paper followed by 12h drying at room temperature. The dried impregnated paper is ignited locally at one end by contact with a heated surface (<400°C) to initiate the combustion wave. The front moves in a self-sustained manner as a wave, leaving behind the final product of the required composition. In the SWI method, the basic 7CuO/3ZnO/1ZrO2 catalyst is prepared using first the ILCS method. This material is then impregnated with the solution containing Pd nitrate and glycine which is then ignited using the VCS mode. Catalysts are named according to their compositions and the synthesis mode used. The metal oxides nCuO, mZnO, lZrO2 are given in respective molar ratios n, m and l, with Pd as weight percent based on the total oxide mass, followed by the synthesis mode VCS, ILCS, or SWI, and finally the fuel/oxidizer ratio φ, and on supported catalysts, the type of support material is included. For example, the catalyst 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr/3Pd-VCS-0.5 has 7CuO:3ZnO:1ZrO2 molar ratio with 3wt% palladium prepared by the VCS method with a fuel/oxidizer ratio of 0.5. Since in this work all the catalysts have same metal oxide ratio (7CuO:3ZnO:1ZrO2), an abbreviated form is also used for convenience e.g. ILCS-0Pd, means that the ILCS method was used to prepare a catalyst which contains no Pd. A high-speed IR thermography (IRT) camera (FLIR SC6000 HS) and a conventional Digital Video Camera (Sony) were used to measure the temperature–time history and to visualize the movement of the combustion front and of the combustion synthesis process. The FLIR SC6000 HS camera has a spatial resolution up to 1.5μm and the maximum frame rate can go as high as 36kHz."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and phase composition of the as-synthesized catalyst powders were analyzed using BET, and XRD methods, while their morphology was analyzed by SEM. BET surface area measurements were carried on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 unit, using nitrogen as the adsorbent gas. Catalyst particles were outgassed at 473K until the differential pressure falls below 20μHg/min. The weight of the outgassed sample was precisely measured before calculating the specific surface area. No other pretreatments were carried out prior to BET area measurements. XRD measurements were carried out using a Scintag Inc. X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 1.54056Å. Powder microstructures were imaged and analyzed using a Hitachi 4500 Field-Emission SEM and an Oxford instruments LEO, series EV-50 SEM, equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectra (EDS) system. Pd dispersion was calculated by measuring the amount of CO adsorbed at 0°C on the surface of the catalyst using a pulse chemisorption technique. Prior to CO adsorption, each catalyst was reduced at 573K to obtain metallic copper. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the reaction solutions was performed on a TA instrument's ‘SDT 2690 TGA-DTA’ model."
6,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements Catalytic activity measurements were conducted in a quartz tubular reactor with an internal diameter of 10.5mm, total length 30cm and a heated length of 22cm. In each experiment the freshly prepared catalyst from as-synthesized powders were pressed to 35MPa for 4min to form a pellet. The resulting pellet was broken up and sieved to obtain agglomerates with particle sizes between 0.6 and 1mm. A catalyst mass of 200mg was used in activity measurements. Each catalyst was reduced in situ by heating it from room temperature to 573K at a rate of 5Kmin−1 and held at this temperature for 1h under a pure hydrogen flow rate of 50cm3 min−1. After reduction, the flow was switched from hydrogen to nitrogen to purge out any remaining hydrogen, as the reactor was cooled to room temperature in about 30min. A flow rate of 140cm3 min−1 of nitrogen saturated with methanol at 0°C, resulting in a stream containing 3.8% methanol was used. Oxygen was added to the reactant stream to obtain an O2/CH3OH ratio of 0.5. Two gas chromatographs were connected in parallel to analyze the reactor effluents. The first (Varian 3300) contained a 3.7m HAYESEP Q column for separation and detection of carbon dioxide, methanol, water, and formaldehyde. The second (Varian 920) contained a 1.8m molecular sieve 5Å and a 5.0m HAYESEP D connected in series to separate nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. Product gases were measured in 12min intervals while the catalyst bed was heated from room temperature to 573K over the course of 3h."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalysts preparation,"3.1 Catalysts preparation It is well known that a pure cellulose paper can be combusted in two different modes: smoldering and flame [35]. The thickness of the fuel layer (i.e. cellulose paper), oxygen concentration, and heat transfer effects define the criteria for the stability of the combustion mode as well as its transition from one mode to another. Due to the vigorous nature of flames, to control the combustion synthesis, it is necessary that it occur in smoldering mode. The cellulose paper used is so thin (∼300μm), that without the metal nitrate and glycine containing solution it could not sustain the steady state smoldering combustion in ambient atmosphere, but it can easily be combusted in the flame mode. However, when the paper was impregnated with the reactive solution, the smoldering mode could be achieved. Impregnation of the active mixture onto the cellulose paper followed by drying enhances the fuel density by bringing the oxidizer directly on the cellulose pore structure. Fig. 1 shows a sequence of frames obtained by conventional digital (a) and high-speed IR (b) cameras that illustrate the movement of the combustion wave in smoldering mode. The reaction front, once initiated locally at one end, moves in a self-sustained manner through the cellulose-solution media. The visible light images taken by the SONY camcorder (Fig. 1a) show two reaction zones. The first zone, being of darker color than the non-reacted region, is followed by an intense bright front with almost the same width (∼10mm). The IRT frames (Fig. 1b) show that temperature of the first zone is low (≤300°C), while the second front is at a higher temperature (>500°C). Analysis of the IRT frames allows one to obtain the temperature distribution across these zones (Fig. 2 ). Deconvolution of the temperature profile confirms the existence of two fronts: low and high temperature zones. The low-temperature zone is heated by conduction and can involve evaporation of moisture and devolatilization of the cellulose paper. Devolatilization is one of the key stages in cellulose combustion followed by pyrolysis and gasification of biomass-type material [36]. SEM images shown in Fig. 2 along with the IRT profile illustrate the specifics of micro-structural transformations taking place in the combustion wave. It can be seen that at in the un-combusted zone the reactive solution is uniformly distributed as thin layers on the surfaces of the cellulose fibers (top left panel a). The SEM micrograph of material collected after the passage of the low-temperature front (bottom left panel b) show some changes in the fiber structure but there is no significant change in overall media microstructure. This can be explained by the formation of the desired oxides as thin layers on the surface of the cellulose fibers. Material collected after the second front (right bottom panel c) show that along with some carbon residue, the morphology of the as-synthesized product can be described as hollow tubes with thin walls (right middle panel e). These oxide tubes have inner diameter and length equal to that for initial fibers, with wall thickness of less than 100nm and specific surface morphology with characteristic size of ∼10nm (right top panel d). Also a pore size analysis of the complex metal oxides prepared by ILCS method indicates pores centered in the mesopore (∼40nm) region. TGA results of the pure cellulose (dotted curve, Fig. 3 ), while obtained in a different spatial configuration than in ILCS, show that the devolatilization of pure cellulose starts ∼300°C, which is higher than the temperature of the low-temperature front. The impregnated paper starts losing its weight much earlier at ∼140°C (solid curve, Fig. 3) and DTA data shows that this is the initiation temperature for the reactive solution. These results along with the SEM micrographs, suggest that the first front occurs mainly due to reaction (2) between nitrates and glycine. Moreover additional experiments conducted in vacuum and in argon show that only the low-temperature front exists if the ambient environment does not contain oxygen. Thus it is clear that the second high temperature front propagation is due to the carbon combustion reaction of the de-volatilized cellulose, i.e. (3) C+O2 →CO2 The carbon combustion reaction (3) reduces the amount of carbon in the final product resulting in ∼0.2wt% of carbon for powders synthesized under optimum conditions (see also [10,12]). More importantly these results along with the XRD results described below, show that the second high temperature reaction front is responsible for the product crystalline structure. XRD results show that the cellulose paper as well as the initial reaction media (i.e. dried cellulose with impregnated salt solution (Fig. 4a and b) are amorphous. The product formed in the low-temperature combustion zone is also not crystalline, while after the second high-temperature combustion wave, well-defined peaks of the crystalline diffraction pattern of the desired phase composition are seen (see patterns c and d in Fig. 4). Thus the cellulose paper is not only a convenient support for the reactive solution, allowing a continuous approach for catalyst synthesis [12], but the high-temperature combustion of cellulosic carbon in oxygen plays a key role that leads to crystallization of the desired phase. The above mechanism of catalyst formation in ILCS explains why it is possible, in a single step, to prepare well crystalline nano-powders with higher surface area than co-precipitation. First, the initial reaction media, containing precursors well mixed at the molecular level before impregnation, can be spread along the fibers forming reactive nano-layers due to the good wetting ability of the cellulose paper. Second, the oxide formation reaction (first front) takes place at low temperature (<300°C) lasting about 10s, leading to the formation of amorphous oxide nano-layers over the cellulose fibers. Finally, the high-temperature front (cellulose burning), which also has a very short duration (about 10s), converts the amorphous oxide product to the desired crystalline phase. In addition the extensive gasification of carbon as CO2, leads to the formation of the final oxide with a higher surface area than if a separate calcination step is carried out."
9,Catalytic activity and selectivity,"3.2 Catalytic activity and selectivity The composition, synthesis mode and the BET area of the as-synthesized catalysts prepared by ILCS and SWI are summarized in Table 1 . As mentioned previously, all catalysts have a 7CuO:3ZnO:1ZrO2 molar ratio and they are denoted in abbreviated form by the amount of Pd used (in wt%), and the synthesis mode followed by the fuel to oxidizer ratio in the reactive solution. Thus, SWI-3Pd indicates that 3wt% Pd was added to the 7CuO:3ZnO:1ZrO2 catalyst using the SWI method. Furthermore the fuel to oxidizer ratio has been kept constant at φ =0.5, based on the previous optimization work done in our group [34] for VCS catalysts, so it is included only if different than 0.5. Table 1 shows that the BET surface areas of as-synthesized powders are in the range of 10–15m2/g. Fig. 5 displays the X-ray diffraction patterns of the two catalysts, i.e. ILCS-0Pd and SWI-3Pd. A crystallite size calculation using Scherrer's equation for monoclinic CuO(111) peak at 38.7°, gives 22nm for ILCS-0Pd and 25nm for SWI-3Pd respectively. It can be also seen that all peaks correspond to the desired oxide phases. No Pd peaks are detected, however, possibly because the Pd crystallites are too small and highly dispersed, or the Pd loading is below the diffractometer detection limit, or because the crystallites are encapsulated by the oxide phases. Fig. 6 shows the methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity for three catalysts prepared by ILCS with three different loadings of Pd (see Table 1). Fig. 6a shows that addition of Pd leads to a significant decrease of the reaction initiation temperature and more accurately to T 50, the temperature for 50% conversion. Indeed, when no Pd (ILCS-0Pd) is used, the reaction starts at 150°C with T 50 =225°C, while it starts at about 120°C with T 50 =195°C when 3%Pd was added in one step by ILSC synthesis (ILCS-3Pd). When Pd was added by using the SWI method, however, the reaction initiation temperature is well below 100°C with T 50 =150°C. Fig. 6b shows the selectivity for hydrogen production as a function of temperature for these catalysts. Hydrogen selectivity is defined as the ratio of the amount of hydrogen produced to the total amount of hydrogen that can be produced from the reacted methanol assuming it is completely converted into hydrogen. It is important to note that the SWI-3Pd catalyst while having high conversion at lower temperature has no selectivity for hydrogen below 140°C, producing carbon dioxide and water as the main products with some traces of formaldehyde. These experiments also show that oxygen is completely consumed at about 130°C, which indicates that hydrogen production starts after completion of the combustion reaction and it could be produced from the decomposition of formaldehyde or/and by water gas shift reaction at higher temperatures. Hydrogen selectivity increases monotonically with temperature and reaches the maximum value of ∼95% at a total methanol conversion of ∼98%. Dispersion of Pd plays a key role in the methanol partial oxidation reaction. Adding 3% Pd as in SWI method has only a minor effect on BET area (Table 1), but have an effect on Pd dispersion resulting in one of the most active catalysts reported so far in literature for methanol conversion, giving ∼40% conversion at 70°C. This increase in activity could be attributed to the well-dispersed Pd which is confirmed by CO adsorption experiments at 0°C while there is no CO adsorption on catalysts without Pd, the total amount of CO adsorbed on SWI-3Pd (445μL/g-catalyst) is more than twice the amount adsorbed on ILCS-3Pd (200μL/g-catalyst). Pd dispersion has been reported to play a significant role in methanol decomposition reactions [30]. Similar observation was made in the case of Pd/CeO2 [37] and it was concluded that the interaction between Pd and the support enhances methanol decomposition. Pd also affects the hydrogen selectivity at temperature above 140°C on ILCS-3Pd, in which hydrogen production starts at ∼140°C and attains a maximum value of 94% selectivity at 290°C, whereas on the ILCS-0Pd, hydrogen production starts at ∼180°C and gives a maximum of only 87% at 300°C. The effectiveness of the SWI method in dispersing Pd led us to examine the effect of varying Pd loading using SWI. Fig. 7 shows results on the catalysts prepared by SWI with varying Pd concentrations. Increasing the Pd concentrations up to 1% decreases T 50 but it does not improve any further the activity when the loading increases from 1 to 5wt%. This could be because Pd dispersion does not improve much above 1%Pd loading as reported in other literature results as well [34,37]. The dispersion of Pd was found to be reduced by a factor of three in case of SWI-5Pd (168μL/g-catalyst CO adsorbed) in comparison to SWI-3Pd (445μL/g-catalyst CO adsorbed). Hydrogen selectivity varies with Pd loading depending on the reaction temperature. At 250°C the SWI-0.5Pd is more active and selective whereas it is less active and selective at 150°C. Interestingly, at higher Pd loading the selectivity decreases. As shown next, this is probably due to an increase in the less selective oxidation Pd sites and a decrease in the more selective sites for partial oxidation. To determine the effect of Pd in absence of Cu/Zn, two catalysts were prepared with Pd supported on ZrO2 (125m2/g, Sigma–Aldrich) and Pd supported on SiO2 (8m2/g, Cerac Inc.). The methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity of these catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . Both catalysts are highly active at low temperature with Pd/SiO2 giving ∼80% methanol conversion at 60°C while Pd/ZrO2 displays 70% conversion at 90°C. The main products in both the cases are carbon dioxide and water with some trace amounts of a byproduct which is expected to be formaldehyde. Fig. 8 shows in broken lines that methanol conversion first decreases with an increase in temperature and reaches a minimum value at ∼150°C followed by an increase in conversion with temperature shown in solid lines. This behavior could be attributed to the non-isothermal heating of the catalysts bed during start-up. When the reactants are introduced, the catalyst bed entrance that comes into contact with them first, gets heated rapidly due to high energy released by combustion and remains at higher temperature as compared to the rest of the catalyst. In fact the conversion and temperature increases immediately after introducing the reactants. The thermocouple in the reactor thermowell measures an average temperature, which is lower initially than the heated part at the top of the bed, and it takes some time for heat to dissipate throughout the bed before a uniform temperature develops inside the bed. Hydrogen production is observed only at temperatures above 180°C. Such trend in activity suggests the presence of two different reaction regimes, first, at low temperature, the combustion reaction and byproduct formation occurs and second, the actual hydrogen production reaction which starts above 150°C, takes place. Comparing the hydrogen selectivity results with catalysts containing Cu/Zn, it can be concluded that the primary role of Pd is to start the methanol combustion reaction at a lower temperature rather than participating in the actual hydrogen generation reaction. The later, is much enhanced by the presence of Cu/Zn. Previous EXAFS work in our group shows that Pd also helped to maintain Cu in a mixture of reduced and +1 oxidation state. Thus the enhancement in the activity and selectivity of palladium promoted copper catalysts could be due to the ability of palladium to maintain copper in a partially reduced state [39]. In general it is accepted that hydrogen production from methanol partial oxidation goes through multiple steps. A kinetic model developed in our research group [39] indicates that the reaction pathway involves methanol combustion, methanol steam reforming, methanol decomposition, as well as water gas shift reaction as described by Eqs. (4)–(7). It is observed that the hydrogen selectivity increases with increase in methanol conversion, which strongly suggests that both reactions, the combustion reaction and the hydrogen generation reaction, occur sequentially at higher temperature (4) C H 3 OH + 3 2 O 2 → C O 2 + H 2 O (5) CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 (6) CH3 +OH→CO+2H2 (7) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 Fig. 9 shows a comparison between catalysts (7Cu/3Zn/1Zr and 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr-1Pd) prepared using ILCS and the previously used co-precipitation methods. Results for co-precipitated catalysts are taken from reference [38]. The SWI-1Pd shows high activity at low temperature (triangles) but it is relatively less hydrogen selective than co-precipitated catalysts (circles) at intermediate and higher temperatures. The primary reason for this could be the presence of carbon in ILCS catalysts, which reduces the exposure of active sites on Cu/Zn. On the other hand in co-precipitation, Cu and Zn are more likely to be present together forming intermetallic or alloy phases, which have been reported to be responsible for the methanol reforming reaction [21]. The role of ZrO2 in the methanol partial oxidation reaction was also investigated on catalysts prepared by combustion synthesis methods. To examine the effect of ZrO2, four catalysts were prepared using VCS mode by maintaining the same 7Cu/3Zn ratio in presence of zirconia. Addition of the Cu/ZnO to ZrO2 was performed by wet impregnation of the solution containing metal nitrate and glycine, followed by combustion. The ratio of active catalyst to support was kept constant at 1:5 in all the experiments. The activity and selectivity of these supported catalysts are compared with similar catalysts diluted with aluminum oxide to get the same mass of the Cu/Zn active phase concentration. A blank run with pure alumina is also reported as a reference. The methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity results for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 . Addition of 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr to the ZrO2 support improves the activity at higher temperature and gives ∼97% at 300°C in comparison to the unsupported 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr which gives only ∼60% conversion at 300°C. The ZrO2 supported catalyst is more hydrogen selective in the complete range of temperatures investigated and gives ∼100% hydrogen selectivity while the unsupported catalyst gives only 30% at 300°C. The effect of ZrO2 is more prominent in the presence of Pd as shown in Fig. 10. The (7Cu/3Zn/1Zr/3%Pd)-ZrO2 having high surface area gives the highest methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity than any other catalyst synthesized by VCS method. Methanol conversion reaches ∼76% at 200°C and it is almost completely consumed above 250°C. Hydrogen production starts much earlier and gives ∼60% selectivity at 200°C and maintains a value ∼96% above 250°C while the unsupported 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr-3%Pd gives the maximum hydrogen selectivity of only ∼80% at 300°C. Using ZrO2 as a support increases the BET area appreciably (as BET area for (7Cu/3Zn/1Zr)-ZrO2 is ∼88m2/g in contrast to 7Cu/3Zn/1Zr which is 19m2/g) which improves the dispersion of active phase and makes it readily available to participate in the reaction. The presence of zirconia has a significant effect on the structure of the catalyst too. Apart from increasing the total surface area, it reduces the CuO particle size and increases the active copper area [39]. A catalyst promoted with zirconia and palladium is expected to have higher copper surface area as well as high reducibility. This could be the reason for high methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity for (7Cu/3Zn/1Zr/3%Pd)-ZrO2 catalyst."
10,Summary,"Highly active and selective catalysts for oxidative reforming of methanol were prepared using different modes of combustion synthesis. Besides composition, the synthesis mode can have a significant effect on the catalysts performance. Addition of Pd in a SWI helps to improve Pd dispersion and makes the catalyst very active at low temperature. Increasing Pd concentration in the SWI catalysts above 1wt% does not have a significant effect on catalysts activity. Pd increases the activity towards methanol combustion to carbon dioxide and water, but it has less effect on hydrogen selectivity. Pd supported on zirconia in absence of Cu/Zn was found to be very active but completely non selective toward hydrogen at low temperature. Hydrogen selectivity increased with temperature on this catalyst and gives a maximum of ∼55% at 300°C. Cu/Zn/Pd-ZrO2 catalysts i.e. supported on zirconia, have high activity and hydrogen selectivity due to an increase in total surface area which provides structural and thermal stability to the highly dispersed active phase. Further work is being carried out on in our group to investigate the mechanism of catalysts preparation by combustion synthesis and its effect on the dispersion of the active phases and the role of individual components in oxidative reforming of alcohols."
