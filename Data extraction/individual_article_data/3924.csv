0,Introduction,"Lignin is a major waste by-product obtained from pulp and paper industry, and second-generation bio-ethanol refineries (Zhou et al., 2014). It is generally combusted to produce energy within the industry, which is a high volume, yet low value application. Lignin combustion results in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions, which affect the ecosystem (Chai et al., 2021). Compared to the existing thermochemical processes like pyrolysis, torrefaction, gasification and hydrothermal liquefaction that are aimed to derive valuable bio-oil, biochar, syn-gas and bio-crude, respectively, from waste lignin, catalytic hydrogenolysis offers better atom economy in order to derive monomeric phenols and guaiacols from lignin (Chen et al., 2021, 2019; Chio et al., 2019). Transition metals like Ni, Cu (Bjelić et al., 2019), Mo (Zhang et al., 2016), W (Guo et al., 2016) and noble metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) (Bjelić et al., 2019) catalyze lignin deconstruction via hydrogenolysis. Ni and Pd-based catalysts exhibit high selectivity to phenolic monomers and cyclic hydrocarbons (Ma et al., 2019). A combination of hydrogenation metal and transition metal is also shown to exhibit superior activity than a single active metal (Gurrala et al., 2021b; Huang et al., 2016). Different types of supports have been used for the loading of active metals, which include metal oxides (Wang et al., 2019), zeolites (HY, ZSM-5) (Nandiwale et al., 2017), and activated carbon (Bjelić et al., 2019). The nature of the support plays a crucial role, and the support-metal interaction is also vital for better catalytic activity. Bio-char, a renewable carbon source, has widespread applications owing to its high surface area, pore volume and surface functional groups (Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, it is a promising material for catalyst support. Van den Bosch et al. (2015) reported 91% selectivity to 4-propanol guaiacol (PohG) + 4-propanol syringol (PohS) from birch sawdust lignin using 5%Pd/C, and 75% selectivity to 4-propyl guaiacol (PG) + 4-propyl syringol (PS) using 5%Ru/C catalyst at 250 °C and 3 MPa H2, using methanol as solvent. The addition of a mild acid like H3PO4 to 5%Pt/C catalyst increased the yield of PohS from 13.7 to 20.9 wt% due to better cleavage of etheric β−O−4 and α−O−4 bonds (Yan et al., 2008). The addition of Tb3+ and Al3+-triflates to Pd/C catalyst is also shown to improve the yield of monomeric phenols upto 45 wt% (Huang et al., 2016). Lignin depolymerization via hydrogenolysis increases remarkably with increase in metal cation valency. The decreasing order of delignification with different metal salts in the case of 5%Pd/C catalyst is given by: Al3+ > Fe3+ > Mg2+ > Cr3+ > Zn2+ > Ni2+ > Fe2+ ≈ Li+ > Cu2+ > Ba2+ > K+ ≈ Na+ (Shu et al., 2015). The catalytic activity is also influenced by the solvent, as it affects the solubility of lignin and monomeric products. Among the different solvents, the use of methanol and isopropanol are shown to result in high conversion of lignin (>90%) with significant monomer yield (Shu et al., 2016). This is due to favourable Lewis acidity of alcohols of shorter chain lengths, and their hydrogen donating ability. Klein et al. (2016) used guaiacyl glycerol-β-guaiacyl ether as a β−O−4 type model compound and showed that the primary hydroxyl at the Cγ position was unaffected when Pd/C was used, while the use of Zn(OAc)2 + Pd/C resulted in the cleavage of both benzylic OH at Cα position and the primary OH at Cγ position to yield PG. Li and Song (2020) proved the simultaneous cleavage of Cα−O and Cβ−O bonds using deuterium incorporated β−O−4 model compound using Pd/Zn/C catalyst, which yielded PG and PohG. Zhang et al. (2016) studied the dehydroxylation and hydrogenation activity of sulfided NiMo catalyst using a number of β−O−4 lignin dimers. Using a free radical trap and density functional theory calculations, they showed that the generation of Cα radical facilitates the cleavage of Cβ−O ether bonds in presence of hydrogen and alcohol solvent. Comprehending the mechanism of catalytic transformation of whole lignin is a complicated task, which requires an interplay of experiments and modelling. This study is aimed to resolve the pathways involving sequential dehydroxylation followed by hydrogenation, and vice versa, for the formation of C9 monomeric phenols from lignin. The novelty of this study is three-fold. Firstly, the preparation and thorough characterization of a novel catalyst, Pd-Al2O3 supported on activated biochar, are demonstrated. Secondly, the catalyst was then employed for hydrogenolysis of alkali lignin, and the effects of reaction conditions like temperature, H2 pressure, and time on lignin conversion, product yield and selectivity are systematically evaluated. Finally, in order to derive a mechanistic understanding of the formation of C9 monomers like 4-propyl guaiacol, t-isoeugenol and 4-propanol guaiacol, insights from quantum chemical density functional theory calculations are combined with hydrogenolysis of model compounds, and the dominant reaction pathways are rationalized."
1,Experimental and modeling methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Potassium hydroxide (KOH), nitric acid (HNO3) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), were purchased from Merck, India. Palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2), guaiacol, 4-methyl guaiacol, 4-ethyl guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, cis-isoeugenol, trans-isoeugenol, acetovanillone, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy phenylacetone, methyl vanillate, 4-propyl guaiacol, coniferyl alcohol and Kraft lignin (henceforth denoted as lignin) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. 4-Propanol guaiacol was purchased from TCI Chemicals (India) Pvt. Ltd. The chemicals used for the preparation of catalysts were of reagent grade, and used as received."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The activated biochar (ABC) was prepared from untreated biochar, which was obtained by microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass (Suriapparao et al., 2018). The untreated biochar and the activated biochar were characterized using proximate and elemental analyses. The ABC was prepared by sequential HNO3 and KOH treatments based on an established procedure with modifications (Linares-Solano et al., 2014). In order to remove the metal oxides and inorganics, the untreated biochar (15 g) was mixed with 1 M HNO3 (300 mL). The solid solution was heated for 12 h at 80 °C with continuous stirring. The solution was filtered and washed till the filtrate reached neutral pH. The obtained solid was dried at 110 °C, then mixed with 10 wt% KOH (300 mL), and finally heated for 24 h at 80 °C with continuous stirring in order to remove silica present in the biochar. The solution was again filtered and washed until neutral pH was achieved, and then dried at 110 °C. The obtained solid residue is called activated biochar. Wetness impregnation method was adopted to load 5 wt% of Al on ABC. After dispersing ABC (2 g) in distilled water (40 mL), the required amount of metal precursor, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, was added. The solution was stirred for 6 h at 70 °C in an oil bath. Water was then removed under vacuum at 65 °C, and the solid obtained was dried at 60 °C. The sample was calcined at 300 °C for 3 h with continuous flow of air (30 mL min−1). The obtained sample is named as 5Al/ABC. 2 wt% of Pd was loaded on 5Al/ABC using the same protocol with required amount of metal precursor, Pd(NO3)2. After obtaining the dry solid powder, it was calcined and reduced in H2 ambience (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 3 h. The obtained sample is denoted as 2Pd-5Al/ABC. Similarly, 2 wt% of Pd was loaded on ABC, which is called 2Pd/ABC."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The prepared catalysts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Pyridine diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission electon microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to evaluate the structural, morphology, thermal stability and acidity. The detailed characterization protocols are available in the co-submitted manuscript ( Gurrala et al., 2021a). The specific surface area and pore size were determined using N2 adsorption–desorption porosimetry. The metal dispersion was determined using CO chemisorption. A Quantachrome Autosorb IQ instrument was employed for both these analysis. The analysis was performed at –196 °C, and multi-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed at 300 °C in vacuum for 3 h. The isotherms were analyzed in the relative pressure range of 0.05 to 0.30. For chemisorption, the catalysts were reduced in situ under H2 at 300 °C for 2 h, followed by subsequent cooling to 40 °C, and then the adsorption isotherms were recorded. The average crystallite size and dispersion were measured using the volume of gas chemisorbed per gram of metal. Proximate analysis was carried out according to ASTM E1131-08 method in a TG analyzer (TGA-2000A, Navas Instruments, U.S.A.). Elemental analysis was performed using CHNS analyzer (Thermo Flash 2000) according to ASTM D5291 method. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopic (ICP-OES) analysis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300 DV. All the catalyst samples were digested in aqua regia solution, and standard solutions were used for the purpose of calibration."
5,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests Hydrogenolysis of lignin was carried out in a 100 mL autoclave (Amar Instruments, India) made of Inconel, and equipped with internal cooling coil, K-type thermocouple and a turbine blade stirrer. The autoclave was charged with 0.5 g of lignin, 0.1 g of catalyst, and 40 mL methanol. Prior to the reaction, the autoclave was flushed 5 times with H2 to remove the residual soluble gases. The autoclave was then pressurized to 3.0 MPa while stirring the contents at 600 rpm before heating it up to 240 °C. Reaction time was noted once the set temperature was reached. Heating was stopped after holding the reactor for specified period of time. The stirrer speed was then decreased to 100 rpm, and cold water was circulated through the cooling coil until the temperature of the contents reached 30–35 °C. The schematic of the product separation protocol is presented in Fig. 1 . The experiments were repeated three times, and the standard deviations in the conversion and liquid yield were within 3–5%. The following calculations were performed to determine the conversion of lignin, yield of products, mass balance achieved, monomer yield and monomer selectivity. (1) Lignin conversion ( % ) = W L - W UL W L × 100 (2) Liquid yield ( w t . % ) = W LQ W L × 100 (3) Mass balance ( % ) = W LQ + W UL W L × 100 (4) M o n o m e r y i e l d w t . % = Wt . o f m o n o m e r i n l i q u i d W L × 100 % (5) M o n o m e r s e l e c t i v i t y % = Wt . o f m o n o m e r i n l i q u i d W LQ × 100 In the above expressions, WUL , WL , and WLQ denote the mass of unconverted lignin, initial mass of lignin, and mass of liquid products, respectively."
6,Product characterization,"2.5 Product characterization Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, GC/MS, (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus and QP2020) equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) was used to separate the organics in the product mixture. Helium (99.9995%) was used as the carrier gas at a column flow of 1.5 mL min−1. The column oven was held at 45 °C for 1 min, ramped up to 250 °C at 5 °C min−1, and finally maintained at 250 °C for 10 min. The injector, interface and MS ion source temperatures were set at 280, 280, and 250 °C, respectively. The compounds were recorded in the mass range of 50–500 Da. The concentrations of the identified phenolic monomers in the soluble liquid mixture were determined by constructing calibration graphs using pure compound standards. Twelve different standard compounds, viz., guaiacol, 4-methyl guaiacol, 4-ethyl guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, cis-isoeugenol, trans-isoeugenol, acetovanillone, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy phenylacetone, methyl vanillate, 4-propyl guaiacol and 4-propanol guaiacol, were calibrated and the response factors were calculated. An average response factor was considered for other compounds, viz., ethyl guaiacol, propiovanillone, methyl homo vanillate, 4-ethenyl-2-methoxyphenol, ethyl benzene, 4-ethyl-phenol and phenol (Nandiwale et al., 2017)."
7,Computational method,"2.6 Computational method The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) (Kresse and Hafner, 1993). The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the electron–ion interactions, and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional (Perdew et al., 1993) was used to model the electron exchange and correlation energies. In order to account for the weak binding systems, Grimme's vdW D3 correction was employed. A plane wave basis set was used to describe the valence electrons with an energy cut-off of 400 eV. The Brillouin zone, sampled at the Monkhorst-Pack 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid (Monkhorst and Pack, 1976), was used to sample the bulk and the surface. The Pd (111) surface was modeled as a four-layer slab using 4 × 4 supercell (16 atoms per plane), and Al2O3 (111) surface was modeled as two layers using 2 × 2 supercell with 10 Å of vacuum between the slabs. During the geometry optimization, the bottom two layers were constrained, while the top two layers along with the adsorbate were allowed to relax at Z-direction in the case of Pd (111). The optimized structures were obtained by minimizing the forces on each ion until they were<0.05 eV/Å. For coniferyl alcohol, a cubic box of 15 × 15 × 15 Å3 was used."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Powder X-ray diffraction The XRD profiles of untreated biochar, ABC and all the metal-loaded catalysts are presented in the co-submitted publication (Gurrala et al., 2021a). About 23.9 wt% of ash was found in the untreated biochar, which is due to oxides of Si, Al, Zn, and Ti (Suriapparao et al., 2018) (see e-supplementary materials). This was also evident in the form of crystalline impurity peaks in the XRD profiles. After chemical treatment of biochar, a broad peak at 2θ 22° was observed, indicating the amorphous nature of the carbon. No characteristic diffractions were observed for Al2O3 in 5Al/ABC, which shows good dispersion of metal oxide over the support. The reduced Pd-loaded catalysts showed characteristic diffractions for Pd0 at 2θ 39.9, 46.4, 68.0 and 81.8° (JCPDS: 46–1043). The crystallite size of Pd0 was measured by Scherrer formula for the (111) plane. The crystallite size of Pd0 increased with the addition of secondary metal oxide (Table 1 ). The crystallite size of Pd0 in 2Pd/ABC and 2Pd-5Al/ABC were 18.8 nm and 27.6 nm, respectively. This clearly indicates that the addition of Al2O3 influences the crystallite size of Pd0. 3.1.2 Physicochemical characteristics Multipoint BET specific surface area and chemisorption data of the catalysts are given in Table 1. It is evident that there is no significant improvement in the BET surface area of biochar after chemical treatment. However, chemical treatment reduces the inorganics from 23.9 to 4.4 wt%, and increases the fixed carbon from 57.3 to 67.5 wt%. Metal oxide loading and Pd loading on metal oxide further improved the BET surface area. The increase in BET surface area of ABC was analyzed by reducing it at 300 °C for 3 h in H2 environment. The BET surface area increased from 31 m2 g−1 for unreduced ABC to 65 m2 g−1 for reduced ABC. This can be attributed to the possible reconstruction of biochar in H2 environment at elevated temperatures. This observation is in line with an earlier study (Gurrath et al., 2000). Metal loading on the support is also shown to enhance the BET surface area due to metal dispersion (Mishra et al., 2008). From CO chemisorption, the average crystallite size of Pd0 in 2Pd/ABC was found to be 11.4 nm, which increased to 18.4 nm for 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst. The actual loading of Pd and Al in the catalysts is also given in Table 1. The stability of Pd-loaded catalysts was assessed by performing TGA in inert N2 atmosphere (Data provided in the co-submitted publication in Elsevier Data in Brief). It is evident that the mass loss exhibited by all the catalysts at 300 °C and 800 °C correspond to 3.0% and ∼ 20%, respectively, which proves that the catalysts exhibit good thermal stability especially under hydrogenolysis conditions. 3.1.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analysis of the reduced 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was carried out to examine the surface composition and elemental state of the metals. The C1s and Pd3d spectra are provided in the co-submitted publication (Gurrala et al., 2021a). The C1s spectrum of the catalyst indicates four different environments in which carbon is present in the supported catalyst (Wu et al., 2012). The lowest binding energy (BE) ∼ 285.0 eV (C1, 78.1%) is attributed to C − C bond present in carbon. The next binding energy peak at ∼ 286.5 eV (C2, 5.4%) is due to the carbon present adjacent to nitrogen (C − N) and oxygen (C − O) functionalities. The third peak at ∼ 287.6 eV (C3, 2.6%) corresponds to carbon attached to nitrogen in quinine or pyridine form. The peak at ∼ 289.1 eV (C4, 3.1%) arises due to carbon attached to strong electronegative atoms such as carboxylic groups. The XPS of Pd3d5/2 and Pd3d3/2 can be further deconvoluted to Pd0 and Pd2+. The peaks corresponding to Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2 are observed at 336.0 and 341.2 eV, respectively. The peaks at 335.4 and 342.9 eV correspond to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd2+ present on the surface, respectively (Nagpure et al., 2016). This implies that Pd is not completely reduced, but ∼ 21% of surface Pd exists in oxide form. These results indicate that the catalyst is active, even though a small fraction of surface-bound Pd is present in PdO form. 3.1.4 Electron microscopy Bright field HRTEM images of ABC and all the fresh catalysts were recorded to understand the morphology of the catalysts and lattice parameters of the supported metals. All the HRTEM images are presented in the co-submitted publication (Gurrala et al., 2021a). TEM images of ABC reveal an irregular surface morphology. The distinct lattice fringes corresponding to d-spacing of 0.22 nm can be assigned to the face-centered cubic crystalline plane of (111) of Pd0. Edge-sharing of lattice fringes was observed for the combination of Pd0 and Al2O3. Based on the d-spacing values of the lattice fringes, the diffraction planes of the metal oxide were assigned. The crystal structure of the metal oxide can be assigned as monoclinic for Al2O3 (JCPDS: 86–1410). The EDS elemental mapping results show the distribution of C, Al, O and Pd elements in the catalyst, and the good dispersion of Pd over the support (data presented in the co-submitted publication Elsevier Data in Brief (Gurrala et al., 2021a)). The concentrations of Pd and Al are 2.6 and 5.0 wt%, respectively, whereas small amount of Si and K (<0.5 wt%) are found in the catalyst. The wt.% concentration of Pd and Al obtained from EDS are similar to the values obtained from ICP-OES, which clearly demonstrates the homogeneous dispersion of metals. The catalyst characterization data from XRD and TEM demonstrate that the Pd0 and Al2O3 exist with Pd (111) and Al2O3 (111) planes exposed to the surface. 3.1.5 Acidity of the catalysts In order to determine the total acidity of the catalysts arising due to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, NH3-TPD experiments were conducted, and the data is provided in the co-submitted publication (Elsevier Data in Brief (Gurrala et al., 2021a)). Three distinct desorption peaks were observed in the TPD profiles of all the catalysts. The desorption curves were deconvoluted to determine the acidity of the catalysts. The desorption peaks in the range of 100–250 °C (D1), 250–500/550 °C (D2) and >500/550 °C (D3) are attributed to weak adsorption, moderate adsorption and decomposition of support, respectively. The D1 and D2 desorption peaks arise due to weak and moderate acidic sites present over the catalyst. Due to the decomposition of support at higher temperatures D3 desorption peak was observed, which was verified by subjecting ABC support to TPD experiment without adsorbing NH3. All desorption curves were deconvoluted, and the amount of NH3 desorbed below 500 °C was considered to determine the acidity of the catalyst (Table 1). Upon Al2O3 loading on ABC, the total acidity increased to 1.7 mmol g−1 for 5Al/ABC catalyst. This can be attributed to Lewis acid sites contributed by Al2O3. The acidity of 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst decreased to 1.1 mmol g−1, which can be attributed to the surface coverage of Al by Pd. In order to prove the contribution of Al to Lewis acid sites, pyridine-DRIFT characterization was performed (provided in the co-submitted publication Elsevier Data in Brief (Gurrala et al., 2021a)). A broad peak was observed at 1440 cm−1 due to strong adsorption of pyridine on Lewis acid sites. The peak at 1545 cm−1 due to the pyridinium ions adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites (Kondo et al., 2010) was absent. The acidity of these catalysts follows the trend: 2Pd-5Al/ABC > 2Pd/ABC > ABC."
10,Catalytic activity for lignin hydrogenolysis,"3.2 Catalytic activity for lignin hydrogenolysis Alkali lignin is reported to contain C (60.9%), H (5.5%), N (0.8%), S (1.3%) and O (31.5%) (Nair and Vinu, 2016), and molecular weight in the range of 2500–600 g mol−1 (Dhar et al., 2020). FTIR characterization revealed that the vibrations corresponding to C−H out-of-plane stretch due to syringol ring are absent in alkali lignin (Nair and Vinu, 2016). Similarly, the 2D-HSQC NMR spectra of alkali lignin exhibits cross signals of δC/δH at 120–110/7.5–6.5 ppm, which indicates the presence of guaiacol units (G) (Dou et al., 2020). These results unequivocally demonstrate that the lignin sample used in this study predominantly consists of G-units. Hydrogenolysis of lignin was systematically investigated with different catalysts under similar reaction conditions, and the results of conversion, product yields and individual monomer yields are given in Table 2 . The classification of different products quantified in this study, viz., monomeric phenols, extractives and other phenolics, are shown in Table 3 . Initially, a blank reaction was conducted in the absence of catalyst. Lignin conversion of ∼ 31% and 5.6 wt% yield to alkene guaiacols were observed. The major products were t-isoeugenol (t-IEug) (4.3 wt%) and guaiacol (3.4 wt%). The use of untreated biochar and ABC as catalysts further improved the lignin conversion to 47.6% and 58.3%, respectively. The liquid yields were 31.5 wt% and 47.8 wt% with untreated biochar and ABC, respectively. Guaiacol (5.3 wt%), alkene guaiacols (5.2 wt%) and alcohol guaiacols (4.7 wt%) were the major monomeric phenols obtained with untreated biochar. Similarly, high yields of alkene guaiacols (8.1 wt%), alcohol guaiacols (5.0 wt%), guaiacol (4.5 wt%), vanillin and its derivatives (9.6 wt%) were obtained using ABC catalyst. The reactions such as decarboxylation and demethoxylation are predominant in the absence of active metals, which results in high yield of guaiacol (Shen et al., 2020). When 2Pd/ABC catalyst was used, the lignin conversion increased to 65.3% with better liquid yield of 54.0 wt%. Alkyl guaiacols and alcohol guaiacols were obtained as the major phenolic monomers at 15.4 wt% and 14.2 wt% yields, respectively. Specifically, the yields of PG and PohG were 8.2 and 9.2 wt%, respectively. These are obtained as a result of cleavage of β−O−4/α−O−4 linkages (Li and Song, 2020). Pd-based catalysts favor the formation of hydroxyl-substituted monomeric syringol/guaiacol units (Van den Bosch et al., 2015). Lignin hydrogenolysis in presence of 2Pd/ABC catalyst results in hydrogenation of unsaturated Cα=Cβ bonds to produce alkyl guaiacols and alcohol guaiacols. As a result, the selectivity to alkene guaiacols like t-IEug are suppressed. Pd is a good catalyst for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions with facile H-dissociation and adsorption capacity (Shu et al., 2015). Heavy products (or heavies) include dimers and oligomers, and extractives like terpenes and terpenoids (Pereira, 2007). C9 alkene guaiacols and alcohol guaiacols are obtained as the primary products of lignin depolymerisation. Alkyl guaiacols can be derived via hydrogenation and dehydroxylation of alkene and alcohol guaiacols. The rate-limiting step could be either hydrogenation of Cα=Cβ or dehydroxylation of Cγ for the formation PG. The conversion of lignin increased to 70.4%, and the yield of phenolic monomers changed significantly when 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was used. It is reported that strong Lewis acidic metals aid in the cleavage of ether bonds (Shu et al., 2016). In the presence of 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst, high yield of alkyl guaiacols (29.1 wt%) was observed. The C9 phenolic monomer, PG, was obtained at 21.5 wt% yield (Table 2). This clearly indicates that the presence of Al enhances both hydrogenation of unsaturated carbons and dehydroxylation of Cγ (Huang et al., 2016). High amounts of alkyl guaiacols/alkyl syringols were obtained when Al2O3 or Al is present in the catalyst (Si et al., 2019). These observations indicate that the presence of Al might help to overcome the rate limiting step of dehydroxylation of Cγ. With 2Pd-5Al/ABC, high yield of C9 phenolic monomers (30.4 wt%) was obtained. This proves that 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst exhibits better catalytic activity than 2Pd/ABC. 3.2.1 Synergetic Effect of Pd-Al catalyst The results demonstrate the superior activity of 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst, and point to the synergism due to Pd-Al interactions. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed to investigate the synergism. Nearly 45% of lignin conversion was achieved in presence of 5Al/ABC, but its hydrogenation activity towards double bond saturation was poor. This was also reflected in high yield of t-IEug (9.8 wt%) formed via dehydroxylation/dehydration. The use of 2Pd/ABC catalyst resulted in high yields of PohG (9.2 wt%) and PG (8.2 wt%) with increased conversion of lignin of 65.3% as compared to 5Al/ABC (Table 2). This implies that the presence of Pd as active metal substantially increases the hydrogenation activity. When 2Pd/ABC and 5Al/ABC were physically mixed and used as the catalyst, the conversion of lignin decreased by 10% compared to 2Pd-5Al/ABC. At the same time, the yield of PG decreased from 21.5 to 12.5 wt% with a concomitant increase in yield of PohG from 6.2 to 7.9 wt%. The physical mixing of individual catalysts is less prompt for dehydroxylation of Cγ–OH as compared to 2Pd-5Al/ABC. This shows that the presence of Pd next to Al site can alter its electronic structure and make it more active for dehydroxylation at Cγ−OH, which is achieved with the 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst. These results point to the possibility of dehydroxylation reaction at Cγ catalyzed by Al, and hydrogenation of Cα=Cβ catalyzed at the Pd0 active sites. This experimental evidence demonstrates that the synergism of Pd-Al facilitates both hydrogenation and dehydroxylation reactions. This can be attributed to the metal–metal interaction, electron transfer within the catalyst surface and the interphase of Pd-Al, and the adsorption of reactant molecules over the surface of active site. Owing to these promising results, 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was examined at different reaction conditions in order to understand the product distribution and plausible mechanism of lignin depolymerization. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature Increasing the temperature from 200 to 260 °C resulted in enhancement of depolymerization of lignin. The conversion of lignin followed the trend: 21.2% (200 °C) < 46.2% (220 °C) < 70.4% (240 °C) < 85.1% (260 °C). Similarly, liquid yield increased from 20.6 to 63.1 wt% with increase in temperature from 200 to 260 °C (Fig. 2 a). The total monomer yield followed the trend: 20.4 wt% (200 °C) < 44.9 wt% (220 °C) < 64.1 wt% (240 °C) < 71.3 wt% (260 °C). The yields of heavies and extractives increased with temperature. At high temperatures, monomers tend to repolymerize/condense resulting in increase in yield of heavies (Wang et al., 2019). High yields of guaiacol and vanillin were observed at lower temperatures of 200 and 220 °C. Further increase in temperature to 240 and 260 °C suppressed the formation of vanillin. Similarly, at 200 and 220 °C, the yields of t-IEug and PohG were high. With further increase in temperature from 220 to 240 °C, the yield of PG increased upto 21.5 wt% with a concomitant decrease in production of t-IEug and PohG. These observations suggest that the rate limiting steps of hydrogenation and dehydroxylation can be overcome at high temperatures. However, with further rise in temperature to 260 °C, the yields of PG and other C9 monomers decreased. At high temperatures, the selective cleavage of bonds will not be favourable, and selective production of monomers with high carbon number such as C9 or C8 is decreased. As a result, the yield of guaiacol increased at 260 °C (9.3 wt%). At 240 °C, C9 phenolic monomers were produced at high yield (30.4 wt%). 3.2.3 Effect of total pressure of hydrogen The effect of total hydrogen pressure on product distribution was investigated at 240 °C, with 1, 2, 3 and 4 MPa of H2. Conversion of lignin increased from 42.1% to 69.2%, and liquid yield also increased from 41.4 wt% to 56.6 wt% as H2 pressure was increased from 1 MPa to 3 MPa. Beyond 3 MPa, there was no significant change in conversion of lignin and liquid yield (Fig. 2b). At different H2 pressures, the yield of alkyl guaiacols remained high (9.1–29.1 wt%), and the yields of C9 phenolics increased from 14.4 wt% (at 1 MPa) to 30.4 wt% (at 3 MPa). With further increase in pressure to 4 MPa, the yield decreased to 25.8 wt%. A similar trend was reported by Ma et al. (2019) for 4-ethyl guaiacol monomer. The yields of t-IEug were 7.7 wt% (at 1 MPa) and 8.7 wt% (at 2 MPa). With further increase in H2 pressure, the yield of t-IEug decreased, which indicates the prominence of hydrogenation of Cα=Cβ at high pressures. Likewise, the yield of guaiacol was high at 1 and 2 MPa, which is due to the Ar–Cα (α–1) cleavage and decarboxylation or demethoxylation reactions (Shen et al., 2020). Owing to the low solubility of H2 in the reaction medium (Wang et al., 2019), the hydrogenation of double bonds is suppressed, and this results in increased yield of t-IEug. These results indicate that low partial pressure of H2 has a profound impact to promote guaiacol and C8 monomeric phenols. 3.2.4 Effect of reaction time 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was examined to understand the time evolution of lignin conversion, liquid yield and product yields. Lignin conversion and liquid yield increased with time from 2 to 3 h, and slightly decreased as the time was further increased to 4 h (Fig. 2c). A similar trend was observed for the selectivity to alkyl guaiacols and C9 monomeric phenols. The formation of heavies decreased initially from 2 h (9.4 wt%) to 3 h (3.8 wt%), and then gradually increased at 4 h (5.7 wt%), which is due to the possible repolymerization of monomers (Nandiwale et al., 2017). At longer durations, some of the phenolic monomers are converted to gaseous products, which is evident from the mass balance data. The highest individual phenolic monomer yield was to PG (21.5 wt%, 3 h), and the corresponding total C9 yield was 30.4 wt% with 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst. A similar study with the 2Pd/ABC catalyst resulted in high yield of PohG (11.7 wt%) at 2 h, with 25.2 wt% yield of C9 monomers (Fig. 2d). These experimental evidences prove that, in the presence of Pd as active metal, C9 alcohol guaiacols are formed as the major phenolic monomers. However, in the presence of Lewis acid metal, alkyl guaiacols are predominantly observed. The carbon atom economy of the process for the production of monomers was also calculated. With respect to initial lignin, the carbon atom economy for total monomers, i.e. C6-C9 monomeric phenols was 60%, whereas that for only C9 monomers was 35%, which are both impressive. In order to understand the fraction of reacted lignin that got converted to monomeric phenols, carbon atom economy was also calculated with respect to the carbon in reacted lignin. The carbon atom economy for the production of total monomeric phenols was 84%, whereas that for only C9 monomers was 50%. The liquid and monomeric phenol yields obtained from this study using 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst are comparable with or better than the reported values in the literature on hydrogenolysis of alkali/kraft lignin using various catalysts and solvents (see e-supplementary materials). Dou et al. (2021) used porous ZnCoO x nanoplates in 1,4-dioxane + methanol solvent, and observed 48.5 wt% liquid yield and 12.5 wt% total phenolic monomer yield with 58% lignin conversion. To the best of our knowledge, lignin conversion of 70.4% along with 56.6 wt% liquid yield and high selectivity to monomeric phenols (∼91%) were achieved with low noble metal loading (2 wt%) in this study."
11,Cleavage of β−O−4 unit of lignin and chemoselective activity of coniferyl alcohol,"3.3 Cleavage of β−O−4 unit of lignin and chemoselective activity of coniferyl alcohol The recent findings of Li and Song (2020) show the simultaneous cleavage of Cβ−O and Cα−OH of β−O−4 bonds in presence Pd/Zn/C catalyst. This catalyst resulted in PohG and PG as the major products from lignin hydrogenolysis. In the current study, control experiment in the absence of any catalyst showed that PohG and t-IEug are the major C9 products (Table 2, Entry 1). Further, experiments at low temperatures were conducted without any catalyst to identify the formation of intermediate monomers. Hydrogenolysis of lignin at 180 and 200 °C resulted in the formation of coniferyl alcohol (COL) intermediate, which was evident from the GC/MS total ion chromatogram of depolymerized lignin at 180 °C. As COL is a reactive molecule, it readily undergoes either hydrogenation at Cα=Cβ or dehydroxylation at Cγ−OH in a parallel pathway even without a catalyst to form t-IEug and PohG. Based on the formation of COL intermediate, concurrent cleavage of Cβ−OPh and Cα−OH can be expected in the presence of a catalyst. Similarly, chemoselective reduction and dehydroxylation of COL can be the rate-limiting steps to form PG from t-IEug and PohG. Hydrogenolysis of the model compound, COL, was carried out using 2Pd/ABC, 5Al/ABC, and 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalysts at the optimized reaction condition (Fig. 3). The results demonstrate that the Pd/ABC catalyst actively participates in the hydrogenation of the Cα=Cβ of COL. This results in 100% conversion of COL in 30 min with 100% selectivity to PohG (Fig. 3 a). There was no decline in the concentration of PohG at long reaction periods. Importantly, there was no formation of PG. This shows that there is no adsorption of Cγ—OH of PohG over Pd to react further. With 5Al/ABC catalyst, 100% conversion of COL was observed in 30 min. The major products include t-IEug, methylated COL (2-methoxy-4-(3-methoxyprop-1-en-1-yl) phenol or methyl-COL) and eugenol (Fig. 3b). Initially, esterification of COL with MeOH in presence of Al/ABC catalyst was observed. At longer duration, the concentration of methyl-COL gradually decreased, and the formation of C9 phenolic monomers increased. The dehydroxylation products (t-IEug + eugenol + c-IEug) were produced at ∼ 84% yield, hydrogenation product (PohG) at 3.2% yield, and dehydroxylation + hydrogenation product (PG) at 8.2% yield. These results clearly show the necessity of Al in the catalyst to promote the dehydroxylation of Cγ-OH. Similarly, when 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was used, 100% conversion of COL was observed in 30 min with high selectivity to PohG (99%) and negligible PG (1%) (Fig. 3c). This is due to the presence of active Pd sites, which favor the adsorption of Cα=Cβ bonds for hydrogenation. Interestingly, with increase in time, gradual increase in the selectivity to PG was observed, and concurrently, the concentration of PohG decreased. At 3 h, a maximum of 15.9% of PG was observed. The formation of the dehydroxylation product (PG) was more favorable in presence of transition metal along with Pd sites, which is clearly due to adsorption/affinity of Cγ–OH group over the transition metals. This is further investigated through quantum chemical calculations for the adsorption of coniferyl alcohol on the catalyst surface."
12,Density functional theory (DFT) study of adsorption of coniferyl alcohol over Pd and al sites,"3.4 Density functional theory (DFT) study of adsorption of coniferyl alcohol over Pd and al sites The experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior selectivity to PohG with 2Pd/ABC catalyst, t-IEug with 5Al/ABC catalyst, and PG using 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst. In order to unravel the surface chemistry at the active metal site that is responsible for the shift in product selectivity, adsorption energies were determined using DFT calculations. Earlier DFT calculations (Delbecq and Sautet, 1995) and experimental results (Nagpure et al., 2016) suggest that the adsorption energy of α-β unsaturated carbonyl/alcohol compounds on Pd (111) via double bond is high. The carbonyl/alcohol functional groups have a low adsorption energy compared to unsaturated bonds. Therefore, the adsorption energies for the alcohol group of coniferyl alcohol (COL) intermediate on Pd (111) and Al2O3 (111) surfaces were evaluated. The adsorption energies of the most stable states with their configurations are reported. The following equation was used to calculate the adsorption energy of COL: (6) E ads = E COL + s u r f a c e - E COL - E surface where ECOL+surface is the total energy of the adsorbed COL on the surface, and ECOL and Esurface are the energies of the COL in the gas phase and the bare surface, respectively. The adsorption energies of the alcohol group of COL over Pd0 and Al2O3 sites are –1.77 eV and –2.53 eV, respectively. More negative the value of adsorption energy, stronger is the adsorption of species on the surface, and vice versa. Thus, the COL molecule preferentially gets adsorbed on the Al2O3 site than over Pd0. This is due to co-ordination of lone pair of electrons present in the oxygen of the alcoholic group with the electron deficient Al site. As a result, the adsorption energy of COL is much higher over Al2O3. This readily favours the activation of Cγ−OH bond of COL. Consequently, the bond length of HO−Cγ increases from 1.40 Å to 1.47 Å for the COL molecule adsorbed on Al2O3. On the other hand, only a little increase in the bond length of HO−Cγ (1.45 Å) was observed for Pd0 (see e-supplementary materials). Therefore, the adsorption strength of the alcoholic oxygen group on Al of Al2O3 (111) is significantly higher than over Pd (111) metal surface. Due to the change in the adsorption mode, the presence of Al in the catalyst enhances the selectivity to PG. These collectively lead to a lower rate of Cγ−OH dehydroxylation over Pd than over Al2O3 site."
13,Chemoselective activity of coniferyl alcohol,"3.5 Chemoselective activity of coniferyl alcohol DFT studies prove that, due to the low metal d-band width of Pd, the chemisorption of unsaturated Cα=Cβ bond is favored over the oxygen functionality (C=O or C–O) on Pd metal sites (Delbecq and Sautet, 1995). As a result, low C−O hydrogenolysis activity is observed for Pd/ABC catalyst. The experimental results and DFT simulation of adsorption of COL molecule on the catalyst surface unequivocally support the fact that the presence of Al in the catalyst enhances the dehydroxylation of Cγ−OH due to preferential adsorption of COL on Al2O3 active sites. As a result, high selectivity to t-IEug is obtained with 5Al/ABC. The presence of electropositive metal enhances the activation of Cγ−OH via C−O adsorption (Koo-Amornpattana and Winterbottom, 2001). The preferential adsorption occurs due to the donation of a lone pair from the oxygen in the OH group (Cγ−OH, top-on η1) to the empty d-orbitals present in Al, which acts as a Lewis acid. Based on these insights, a possible surface catalytic mechanism for the formation of PG from COL is proposed (see e-supplementary materials). The elementary steps involved in the mechanism can be listed as follows: (a) methanol and H2 release active hydrogen species that adsorb onto the surface of Pd, (b) coniferyl alcohol released from lignin readily adsorbs in parallel configuration on the Pd surface (di-σCC η2) (Delbecq and Sautet, 1995), (c) hydrogenation occurs by the reaction of H-adatoms with the Cα=Cβ moiety resulting in the formation of PohG, which then adsorbs on the active Al-site (on top η1) (Delbecq and Sautet, 1995), (d) oxygen present in the hydroxyl group of PohG acts as a nucleophile and forms a transition state intermediate with Al, (e) addition of hydrogen across the hydroxyl group and Cγ carbon results in PG formation, (f) PG desorbs from the surface with the elimination of water (see e-supplementary materials). To summarize, the mechanism of C9 propyl guaiacol formation is unravelled using coniferyl alcohol as the reaction intermediate, and the bimetallic Pd-Al catalyst is proximal to the simultaneous cleavage of Cβ−OPh and Cα−OH bonds. Owing to the promising activity exhibited by the catalyst, it is vital to study its recyclability and long-term stability for converting different varieties of lignin, which are possible scopes for future work."
14,Recyclability of the 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst,"3.6 Recyclability of the 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst The recyclability of 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst was studied by recovering the spent catalyst and reactivating it before its subsequent use. Typically, the unconverted lignin was removed using 1 M NaOH solution, and the catalyst was recovered. The washed catalyst was dried and reactivated at 300 °C for 3 h in H2 ambience (30 mL min−1). The hydrogenolysis experiment was conducted at 240 °C for 3 h at 3 MPa H2 partial pressure. After the first cycle, lignin conversion, liquid yield, monomer yield and C9 yield decreased by 31%, 35%, 34% and 36%, respectively (Fig. 4 ). This clearly indicates the deactivation of the catalyst active sites due to coke formation. Importantly, the phenolic monomer selectivity and C9 selectivity remained almost the same (∼90% and ∼53%) in the liquid, which demonstrates that the available Pd and Al2O3 sites are active. Calcination of the catalyst prior to reactivation is expected to further improve the availability of the metallic sites for hydrogenolysis reaction, which is a possible future work. Moreover, altering the relative proportion of Pd and metal oxide can further improve the yields and selectivity to phenolic monomers."
15,Conclusion,"This study demonstrates the superior activity of 2Pd-5Al/ABC catalyst to produce C9 phenolic monomers at high yield (30.4 wt%) with high selectivity to propyl guaiacol (38%). The optimum reaction condition to produce high liquid yield with high selectivity to phenolic monomers was 240 °C, 3 MPa H2 and 3 h. The liquid products contained alkyl guaiacols, alcohol guaiacols and vanillin derivatives as the major products. Through hydrogenolysis experiments of coniferyl alcohol intermediate and DFT calculations of adsorption of Cγ–OH on Al2O3 site, the major pathway for the formation of propyl guaiacol is shown to be via dehydroxylation of propanol guaiacol."
