0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas is a primary feedstock for the chemical industry (e.g. the synthesis of ammonia [1], the refinement of fossil fuels [2] or metals [3], the treatment of different materials going from semiconductors to glass [4] and others). While hydrogen element represents 75% of the universe mass, the presence of hydrogen gas (H2) is rare in the Earth’s atmosphere (1 ppm) [5]. The nonexistence of any direct H2 source on Earth makes its extraction impossible and consequently the synthesis of this molecule needs to be achieved on an industrial scale in a way to be used for a mass production of many components. About 50 million tonnes of hydrogen gas are produced every year corresponding to about 2% of the world’s primary energy consumption [5,6]. Today, the production of hydrogen strongly relies on the use of fossil fuels: more than 95% of this gas is produced from and by this non-renewable source of energy and the involved synthetic pathways are responsible for the release of 830 Mt of CO2 in the atmosphere per year [5,7,8]. Hydrogen gas can also be produced by photochemical and electrochemical water splitting, which in case of renewable energy input appears to be a sustainable and realistic alternative to steam methane reforming or coal gasification [5,9,10]. The splitting of water (H2O → H2 + ½O2) using electricity is as old as electrochemistry. Today, only 4% of the hydrogen gas is produced by water electrolysis, mainly for application requiring high purity hydrogen (e.g. fuel cell vehicles) [1,5]. Two main technologies are considered today as scalable systems for electrolytic hydrogen production: alkaline and proton-exchange membrane electrolysers (PEM) [11,12]. Alkaline electrolysis is a mature technology with reasonable efficiency (59–70%), in which water splitting occurs at the surface of two electrodes immersed in an alkaline electrolyte (20–30% KOH) [11,13]. The main disadvantages related to the alkaline electrolysers stem from the caustic environment affecting the durability of cell components and the low current density limiting the production rate [12,14,15]. PEM electrolysis is a more recent technology and uses a solid proton-conducting polymer as electrolyte [16]. The technology offers greater energy efficiency (65–82%), a lower gas crossover, a more compact design, and higher production rates [11–13]. However, the system requires more expensive components including noble-based electrocatalysts, bipolar plates electrodes and current collectors. In PEM and alkaline electrolysers, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have to be carried out simultaneously at the same rate. However, decoupling spatially and temporally the two half-cell reactions would offer several advantages for water splitting: (i) the minimisation of O2 and H2 recombination lowering safety issues and O2 content in hydrogen stream, (ii) the electrochemical operation at atmospheric pressure reducing cell components degradation, (iii) a more flexible production rate for HER, which is not anymore linked directly to the OER [9,14,17]. Recently, Symes and Cronin reported an approach with decoupled HER and OER, whereby a polyoxometalate (H3PMo12O40) buffer is used to reversibly store the protons and electrons generated during the electrolytic OER and deliver them back later in a separate electrolytic cell for hydrogen production [18]. They also reported a similar system using quinone derivatives or H4[SiW12O40] as electron-coupled-proton buffer [9,19,20]. In 2014, our laboratory introduced the concept of dual-circuit Redox Flow Battery (RFB) (Fig. 1 ), whereby the negative and the positive charged redox species of a V-Ce RFB (e.g. negative side V3+/V2+, positive side Ce4+/Ce3+) could be employed as redox mediators (electron donor or acceptor) for respectively performing proton reduction and water oxidation [14,21,22]. The reactions do not occur at the electrode surface, but are carried out in outer reservoirs on the surface of an appropriate solid electrocatalyst to increase the rate of the electron transfer reactions. In this work, a redox-mediated hydrogen evolution reaction is carried out over a molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C) electrocatalytic bed without the need of an additional energy input (spontaneous reaction). The resulting hydrogen evolution reaction is given by equation: (1) 2 H + + 2 V 2 + → M o 2 C H 2 + 2 V 3 + The water oxidation was mediated by Ce4+ in order to balance the protons consumed for the mediated-HER. More recently, comparable approaches were reported using conventional all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). Since the V5+/V4+ redox couple (1.00 V vs. SHE) remains below the required potential to promote OER, alternatives pathways were investigated to regenerate the protons on the positive side [23–25]. In order to use low-cost (precious-metal free) electrocatalysts for the proton reduction in acidic conditions, molybdenum-based electrocatalysts have been widely considered. Among these catalysts, MoS2 was considered as a good alternative electrocatalyst to Pt-group towards HER [26–29]. More recently, Vrubel and Hu investigated the use of a commercial molybdenum carbides (β-Mo2C, hexagonal form) and have shown an even better stability and activity towards HER [30]. In the present work, a similar commercial molybdenum carbide (in the form of microparticles of 1 to 5 µm) was used as it was reported to be stable and active towards HER in both acidic media [14,21,30]. Peljo et al. operated the dual-flow circuit redox flow battery at pilot scale with the same commercial Mo2C catalyst (Fig. 1) for more than six months without observable changes in activity [23]. The use of a low-cost catalyst is of particular interest in order to propose a system with high accessibility for industrial applications. To control the production flow rate of hydrogen, it is necessary to understand the kinetic behind the vanadium-mediated process for HER. Previous studies revealed that the rate of electrocatalytic mediated-electron transfer depends on various parameters such as the availability of catalyst sites, the redox potential of the mediator solution and the reactants concentration [10,20]. However, no clear determination of the kinetic rate law was established. In this work, we performed a complete kinetic and mechanistic study of the hydrogen evolution reaction via the chemical oxidation of V2+ over a commercial Mo2C (β-form, hcp structure) [21,30] by redox electrocatalysis. First, a kinetic rate law was established according to an assumed reaction mechanism. From this, the exponential factor associated to each kinetic parameter was determined by hydrogen flow measurements. The proposed rate law was corroborated using an adapted rotating ring-disk device (RRD) technique that enables the study of the reaction at steady-state conditions and also a full characterisation of the redox electrocatalyst. Furthermore, a conversion study was performed to further confirm and enlarge the range of validity of the kinetic model. Finally, the developed kinetic model was implemented to simulate the process in a semi-batch reactor."
1,Experimental method,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%) was purchased from Roth and dried on 4 Å molecular sieves. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95–97%) was purchased from Merck and used without further purification. Nafion (20% w/w in EtOH) was purchased from Ion Power (D2020 Alcohol based 1000 EW) and used without further purification. Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C, 99%, β-form, hcp structure [21,30]), oxalic acid (H2C2O4, 98%), hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4·H2O, 64–65%), and vanadium oxide (V2O5, 99.6%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification."
3,Electrolyte synthesis,"1.5 M of VO(SO4) electrolyte solution in 2 M H2SO4 was synthesized via the chemical reduction of vanadium pentoxide by oxalic acid: (2) V 2 O 5 + 2 H 2 S O 4 + H 2 C 2 O 4 ⇌ 2 V O S O 4 + 2 C O 2 + 3 H 2 O To prepare 500 mL of vanadium electrolyte, 68.25 g of V2O5 were placed in a triple-neck round-bottom flask and mixed with 100 mL of distilled water. 73.5 g of sulfuric acid were slowly added and the mixture was refluxed (115 °C). 33.75 g of H2C2O4 were carefully added (formation of a thick foam due to CO2 production). To complete the reduction of V2O5, few drops of an aqueous solution of hydrazine (10% v/v) was slowly added. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was cooled down and filtered on ceramic. The solution was finally completed with distilled water. The obtained 1.5 M VO2+ solution was then electrolyzed in a single-flow cell to prepare solution of 1.5 M V(II) (negative side) and 1.5 M VO2 + (positive side) in 2 M H2SO4. Initially, 1L of 1.5 M VO2+ was disposed within two reservoirs and the electrolytes were circulated through the cell with a peristaltic pump (Minipuls 3, Gilson), where oxidation and reduction respectively occur on the positive and the negative side. The electrolysis was performed at a constant cell potential of 1.6 V. The flow-cell was made of carbon felt electrodes (SGL GFD 5) and copper current collectors with a geometric surface area of around 550 cm2. The membrane was of anion-exchange type (Fumatech 375-PP). These solutions were used for the preparation of all the other vanadium electrolytes."
4,Instrumentation,"3.1 Instrumentation Electrochemical experiments were performed with an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT204 (Metrohm) and with an Autolab bipotentiostat PGSTAT302N (Metrohm) while using the RRD device. A Biologic HCP‐1005 (100A booster) was used for the electrolysis of the vanadium electrolyte. Hydrogen flows were recorded with a high-precision hydrogen thermal mass flow meter (Red-y smart meter GSM, ±1% accuracy) purchased from Vögtlin Instruments. SEM images were performed with a Teneo SEM (FEI, USA) equipped with a Schottky field emission gun. Secondary electron detection was carried out with an Everhart–Thornley detector and an in-lens detector. Optical imaging was conducted with a Keyence model VK-8710 Color 3D laser scanning microscopy. UV–vis measurements were performed with an Ocean Optics FLAME-S spectrometer."
5,Mo2C film preparation,"3.2 Mo2C film preparation The RRD device consisted of a ring-rotating disk electrode (purchased from Metrohm) including a glassy-carbon disk and a platinum ring (disk diameter = 5 mm, gap between disk and ring = 0.375 mm, ring thickness = 0.375 mm, theoretical collection efficiency = 24.9%, thread = M4, shaft material: PEEK). The RRD electrode was first mechanically polished with 1 and 0.05 μm aluminium oxide (Al2O3, 1.0 µm, purchased from Buehler) on 8′’ microcloth PSA 10/PK (Buehler) and sonicated for 3 min in a solution of water:isopropanol (50:50). For the preparation of the Mo2C film, 6 μL of an ink of the electrocatalyst in N,N-dimethylformamide (30 mg·L–1) was dropcasted on the glassy carbon of the GC-Pt RRD device (Glassy Carbon-Platinum Rotating Ring Disk) at a spinning rate of 300 rpm (catalyst loading of 5.97 mg·cm−2). The solvent was then evaporated at 10 mbar for 3 min. A 4 mm diameter circular pattern was used to avoid leak of the catalyst ink on the platinum ring. To enhance the stability, the Mo2C film was covered with 25 μL of a solution of Nafion (2% wt in dry ethanol), evaporated at 10 mbar for 3 min. An electrochemical benchmarking protocol was followed to characterize the Mo2C film (Figs. S4–S5), especially the surface area, the catalytic activity and the stability of the film [31]. This is presented in the SI."
6,Kinetic study in transient conditions,"3.3 Kinetic study in transient conditions To determine the dependence of the overall rate of the hydrogen generation reaction with the state-of-charge of the vanadium redox electrolyte, the concentration of V2+ and the amount of electrocatalyst, the chemical oxidation of various electrolyte solutions (Tables S1–S3) was studied by monitoring the hydrogen production flow. The chemical oxidations were performed in a 100 mL stirred-chemical reactor (Schott bottle) connected with PVDF tubing to a hydrogen flowmeter (5 mL·min−1 and 648 mL·min−1). The rate of reaction was measured according to: (3) r = d n H 2 d t = ρ V ̇ H 2 M H 2 where ρ is the volumetric mass density of hydrogen (g·L–1), V ̇ H 2 is the volumetric flow of hydrogen (mol·L–1), and M H 2 is the molar mass of hydrogen (g·mol−1). For every experiment, the system was first purged with hydrogen and the sealing of the apparatus was checked with a gas leak detector. The catalyst powder was first well-dispersed in 2 M aqueous H2SO4. The reaction was triggered by adding the vanadium electrolyte. The chemical reactor was kept under stirring using a magnet (500 rpm). For the conversion study, 50 mL of V2+/V3+ (1.44 M in 2 M H2SO4, SOC = 85%) were oxidised on 25 ± 1 mg of molybdenum carbide mesh. To monitor the state of charge of the solution, samples were collected during the chemical oxidation and analysed by UV–vis spectroscopy in a 1 mm quartz cuvette. A filter (Xtra H-PTFE-20/25 purchased from Chromafil, 20 µm pore size) was used for the sampling to remove particles of Mo2C. The UV–vis calibration curve was performed for absorbance (A) at wavelength (λ) of 400 nm for 1.44 M V2+/V3+ in 2 M H2SO4 electrolyte solutions (SOC ranging from 20% to 100%). The background was adjusted using the isosbestic point at λ = 725 nm (A = 0.25) (Figs. S16 and S17)."
7,Kinetic study in steady-state conditions,"3.4 Kinetic study in steady-state conditions All the RRD kinetic experiments at steady-state conditions were performed in an inert atmosphere at 20 °C. The collection efficiency of H2 produced on the disk and collected on the ring was determined electrochemically with the GC-Pt RRD (covered with a Nafion layer 25 μL of 2% wt in dry ethanol) in a solution of 2 M aqueous H2SO4 at rotating speed of 2000 rpm. Chronoamperometry experiments were performed at different potentials comprised between –0.24 V and –0.29 V vs. SHE, while linear sweep voltammetry was performed at the ring from 0.1 V to 1.2 V vs. SHE with a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1. The anodic current at 0.2 V vs. SHE was plotted as a function of the resulting cathodic current on the disk, with the slope indicating the collection efficiency. The rate of reaction (1) was studied for various vanadium solutions in 2 M H2SO4: 150 mM V2+/V3+ (15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75), 300 mM V2+/V3+ (15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%). After purging the electrolyte with Argon, the Mo2C film RRD was immersed at a rotation rate of 2000 rpm and the platinum was linearly polarized from –0.1 V to 1 V vs. Ag|AgCl (sat. KCl) with a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1. Blank measurements were performed using the GC-Pt RRD electrode covered with Nafion to quantify the background signal due to V2+ oxidation on the platinum ring. The dependence of protons on the reaction was also evaluated by studying the reaction rate for 300 mM V2+/V3+ (SOC = 35%) in various concentrations of H2SO4 (1000 mM, 1500 mM, 2000 mM)."
8,Theoretical basis,
9,Kinetic model,"4.1 Kinetic model In a redox-mediated process (reaction(1)), two electron transfer reactions take place on a solid electrocatalyst particle, here the oxidation of V2+ (reaction (4)) and the reduction of protons (reaction (5) [21]), and the role of the solid electrocatalysts is to cope with the different number of electrons for the two half-reactions: V 2 + → k c a t , a V 3 + + e - ( 4 ) 2 H + + 2 e - → k c a t , c H 2 ( 5 ) where k cat,a is the rate constant of the anodic half-cell reaction and k cat,c is the rate constant of the cathodic half-cell reaction. Both half-cell reactions occur simultaneously and the electrocatalyst plays the role of a conductor of electrons that are supplied by the oxidation of V2+ and drawn by the reduction of the protons. According to this reaction scheme, the rate law of reaction (1) would be governed by the slowest step between the two half-cell reactions (rate-determining step). In terms of energy levels, the driving force of the mediated-electron transfer is set by the difference of the Fermi levels between the electrocatalytic material and that of the limiting redox couple determined by the Nernst equation. As shown on Fig. 2 , the Fermi level of the catalyst particles equilibrates with the Fermi level of the electron in solution for the fastest redox couple. As both half-reactions occur in the same potential range ( E V 3 + / V 2 + 0 = –0.26 V vs SHE, E H + / H 2 0 = 0 V vs SHE) on the Mo2C electrocatalyst, it is difficult to isolate the kinetic parameters for each half-reaction using classical electrochemical methodologies (e.g. Butler-Volmer). Considering the large excess of protons (due to the low solubility and stability of V(II) and V(III) redox species at high pH [32]) composing the commercial vanadium electrolyte (∼1.6 M V in 2 M H2SO4) and the high activity of Mo2C for HER [30], we assume that the half-reaction of V2+ oxidation is the rate-determining step and the mediated electron transfer follows the reaction scheme described in Fig. 2B. In other words, the overall reaction (1) is pseudo-first order with respect to V2+. Thereafter, the oxidation of V2+ (reaction (4)) is postulated to occur according to the following elementary steps [33]: V 2 + + ∗ → k 1 k - 1 ← V 2 + , ∗ ( 6 ) V 2 + , ∗ → k 2 V 3 + , ∗ + e - ( 7 ) Where * represent the catalytic active sites on the Mo2C particles, k 1, k –1, k 2 are respectively the kinetic rate constants of the adsorption step, the desorption step and the electrochemical half-cell reaction of the adsorbed reactant (oxidation of V2+,*). We assumed that the adsorption equilibrium constant of H+ remains constant due to the excess of protons in solution and the low solubility of H2 (no accumulation). Thereby, the rate law of reaction (1) is governed by the kinetic of the oxidation of V2+ at the catalytic surface (unimolecular surface reaction) [33,34]: (8) v c a t , a = k 2 θ V 2 + ∗ Where v cat,a is the overall reaction rate (mol·L–1·s−1), θ V 2 + is the fractional surface coverage (fraction of occupied sites = [ V 2 + , ∗ ]/ [ ∗ ] ) and [ ∗ ] is the concentration of all active sites (occupied or not) (mol·m−2). Furthermore, the irreversible one-electron redox process in reaction (7) (oxidation of V2+,*) is governed by the Butler-Volmer model and k 2 can be written as follows [35,36]: (9) k 2 = k 2 0 e α F E - E e q RT where k 2 0 is the pre-exponential factor, α is the dimensionless charge transfer coefficient of the anodic reaction for the redox couple V3+/V2+, F is the Faraday constant (C·mol−1), R is the ideal gas constant (J·mol−1·K−1), T is the temperature (K) and E–E eq is the overpotential given by the difference between the Fermi level of the electrons in the electrocatalyst and the Fermi level of the electrons in solution associated to the redox couple V3+/V2+ (i.e. Nernst potential). The overpotential generated at the electrocatalyst surface in eq.(9) is then the difference between the catalyst particle Fermi level (close to the equilibrium potential of H+/H2, E H + / H 2 ) and the equilibrium potential generated by the redox couple V3+/V2+ in solution: (10) E - E e q ≈ E H + / H 2 - E ° V 3 + / V 2 + - RT F ln V 3 + V 2 + where [V2+] and [V3+] are the molar concentrations of V2+ and V3+ (mol·L–1). All in all, the Mo2C microparticles behave as an electrode for which the potential is set close to 0 V, and onto which V2+ is oxidized. Equation (10) is a key equation that reflects the importance of the redox-mediator potential in the kinetics. By analogy, the redox-mediator acts as a “liquid electrode” by accepting or giving electron (electron donor in this particular case). By regrouping all the terms that are independent of the state-of-charge (SOC = [V2+]/ ([V2+] + [V3+])) of the solution, in the pre-exponential factor (k 2 0), we can express k 2 as follows: (11) k 2 = k 2 0 e - α F RT E ° V 3 + / V 2 + - E R H E + RT F ln V 3 + V 2 + = A V 2 + V 3 + α = A S O C 1 - S O C α where A is a kinetic factor that is temperature-dependent. Then, if we apply the steady-state approximation to the intermediate V2+,∗, we have: (12) d V 2 + , ∗ d t = 0 = k 1 V 2 + ∗ 1 - θ V 2 + - k 2 θ V 2 + ∗ - k - 1 θ V 2 + ∗ (13) θ V 2 + = k 1 [ V 2 + ] k 1 V 2 + + k - 1 + k 2 From this point, we can then distinguish two cases: 1) Limiting step: redox reaction of the adsorbed reactant (k 2 ≪ k 1[V2+], k –1) (14) v c a t , a ≈ k ' V 2 + γ ∗ w i t h γ = 1 , k ' = k - 1 k 1 k 2 l o w V 2 + γ = 0 , k ' = k 2 h i g h V 2 + 2) Limiting step: adsorption/desorption (k 2 ≫ k 1[V2+], k –1) (15) v c a t , a ≈ k ' V 2 + γ ∗ w i t h k ' = k 1 , γ = 1 Herein, we assume that the state-of-charge of the electrolyte would influence the kinetic of the overall rate of reaction (1) and thus the rate law has to be governed by the oxidation of the adsorbed V2+ (reaction (7)). From the expression of k 2 described in Eq. (11), the general rate law governing reaction (1)) can be expressed as follow: (16) v r x n = k c a t S O C 1 - S O C α [ V 2 + ] γ ∗ where k rxn is the reaction rate constant of reaction (1) and γ is the associated orders for V2+."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Kinetic experiments in transient conditions,"5.1 Kinetic experiments in transient conditions A classical method to determine the kinetic parameters of the rate law consists in measuring the reaction rate by varying one kinetic parameter while keeping the others in large excess. At low pH, if the oxidation of V2+ is the rate-determining step, the kinetic of the overall reaction should be sensitive to the SOC of the vanadium electrolyte, the concentration of V2+ and the electrocatalyst load. Thus, the rate of reaction (v rxn) was studied as a function of each kinetic parameters to determine the respective orders of reaction. The chemical oxidation of various V2+/V3+ solutions in 2 M H2SO4 over Mo2C were carried out in a stirred-tank reactor at room temperature by monitoring the hydrogen production with a flowmeter. The electrolytes were formulated in a way to maintain the same volume at the expense of the total vanadium concentration in order to ensure, within the reactor, both constant stirring and headspace (Tables S1–S3). The reactor was purged with hydrogen gas before triggering the reaction in the bulk. The initial flow rate was considered to calculate the various reaction orders. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the overall rate of reaction (1) as a function of the concentration of V2+ (Fig. 3A), the SOC (Fig. 3B) and the mass of catalyst (Fig. 3C). The recorded hydrogen flowrate profile along the chemical oxidation are available in the Supporting Information (Figs. S1–S3). To determine the dependence of the overall rate on V2+ concentration, several electrolytes were prepared (0.025–0.50 M V2+, 0.025–0.5 M V3+, 2 M H2SO4) and chemically oxidized over 50 ± 1 mg of Mo2C. In order to minimize the variation of the initial equilibrium potential of the electrolytes, the solutions were prepared by maintaining the state-of-charge at 0.5 ([V2+] = [V3+]). As shown in Fig. 3A, an apparent reaction order of γ ≈ 1 was observed, which is the order expected for an one-electron transfer reaction with respect to the interfacial concentration of the adsorbed reactant (V2+,*). The first-order dependence of overall reaction rate on V2+ is in agreement with the kinetic rate law proposed in Eq. (16), with a dependence of k rxn on the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then, the sensitivity of the reaction rate with the state-of-charge of the solution was evaluated by studying the chemical discharges over 50 ± 1 mg of Mo2C electrocatalyst of various electrolyte solutions (0.15 M V2+, 0.015–1.35 M V3+, 2 M H2SO4) at SOC ranging from 20 to 90%. As shown in Fig. 3B, an apparent kinetic factor of α ≈ 0.57 was observed. The value is very close to the charge transfer coefficient reported in the literature [37] consolidating the hypothesis that the mediated electron transfer process is driven by the difference between the Fermi level of the Mo2C electrocatalytic particles and that of the limiting redox couple potential V2+/V3+. Finally, the chemical oxidations of vanadium electrolyte solutions (0.375 M V2+, 0.375 M V3+, 2 M H2SO4) on various load of electrocatalyst ranging from 3 to 50 mg were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3C, an apparent exponential factor of 1 was extracted from the experimental data as predicted by the kinetic rate law. The results obtained under transient conditions reveal that the kinetic of the reaction (1) fits well with the reaction scheme described in the kinetic model Section."
12,Kinetic experiments in steady-state conditions,"5.2 Kinetic experiments in steady-state conditions 5.2.1 RRD method To validate the results obtained under transient conditions, we have developed a method using a rotating ring disk device to study the kinetic of the mediated electron transfer reaction in steady-state conditions under diffusion-controlled regime. The approach consists in preparing a Mo2C film-Pt RRD device by dropcasting a catalyst ink on a commercial polished glassy carbon disk RRD electrode, but not connected to a potentiostat (Fig. 4 ). It is important to notice that in the film, the Mo2C microparticles do not need to be in electrical contact to each other, as each microparticle acts as an electrocatalysts in its own right. Next, we covered the Mo2C film with a Nafion layer to enhance the short-term stability of the electrocatalytic surface. The Nafion layer was observed to be homogeneous with a thickness of ∼1.5 µm (Fig. S5). Note that when the bare electrode or the Mo2C film is covered with a thin pure Nafion layer (where the diffusion of reacting species is smaller than in the solutions), we keep a steady-state diffusion-controlled current (Fig. S10) with the thickness of the diffusion layer equal to the thickness of the membrane layer30. The Mo2C film-Pt RRD device is then immersed in the vanadium electrolyte (redox-mediator) to spontaneously trigger the mediated-electron transfer in the Mo2C film. Under rotation, the hydrogen produced (Reaction (1)) is circulated in a laminar flow from the electrocatalytic film to the platinum ring, where the potential is swept from 0.1 V to 1.2 V vs. SHE to oxidise back the hydrogen generated from the disk: (17) H 2 → 2 H + + 2 e - E 0 H + / H 2 = 0 V v s . S H E The resulting anodic signal at 0.2 V vs. SHE can be analysed to quantify the overall rate of the reaction occurring in the film according to the following equation: (18) v r x n = I r i n g n · F · C E where I ring is the anodic current recorded on the ring at 0.2 V vs. SHE (A), n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96′485 C·mol−1) and CE is the experimental collection efficiency of the RRD device (see SI). The background current generated by the simultaneous V2+ oxidation on the ring was subtracted by carrying out blank experiments in the same conditions in the absence of the electrocatalyst. The interest of the method is to evaluate the kinetic of the mediated electron process under well-established steady-state conditions and a constant catalytic activity in a controlled-diffusion regime. This improves considerably the control on the mass-transfer and kinetic parameters of the reaction. Furthermore, the activity, the surface and the stability of the electrocatalyst film can be precisely determined using electrochemical voltammetry (see SI). 5.2.2 Kinetic study Steady-state RRD kinetic experiments were carried out on two different sets of vanadium electrolyte solutions in 2 M H2SO4: 150 mM V2+/V3+ (15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, and 75%), 300 mM V2+/V3+ (15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, and 55%). We prepared and characterized the Mo2C film before every experiment to ensure the performance and the stability of the catalytic layer following an electrochemical benchmarking protocol (see SI) [31]. The collection efficiency was measured to about 8% compared to a maximum theoretical value of 24.9% (Figs. S11–S13). The difference between the experimental and the theoretical collection efficiency is due to the presence of Nafion hindering an optimal flow from the disk to the ring (e.g. bubble fouling). For every solution, blank measurements were performed using a GC-Pt (Glassy Carbon-Platinum) RRD device with the disc covered with Nafion but in the absence of Mo2C in order to subtract the background signal due to V2+ oxidation on the platinum ring. All the anodic LSV recorded on the ring are available in the Figs. S14–S15. The resulting rates of reaction were measured using Eq. (18) for each electrolyte solutions and are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of both the concentration of V2+ and the state-of-charge of the electrolyte. An apparent kinetic constant, k app, was calculated using the proposed kinetic law with the exponential factors previously found (21) v r x n = k a p p S O C 1 - S O C 0.57 [ V 2 + ] and was found to be 4.56·10–7 cm·s−1 for 150 mM V3+/V2+ solutions and 1.48·10–6 cm·s−1 for the 300 mM V3+/V2+ solutions. The experimental variations may result from changes in rheological properties between two sets of experiments that may affect the collection efficiency. Since it was not possible to evaluate CE in presence of V2+, the one measured in 2 M H2SO4 was considered for all the calculations. Additionally, the resulting standard rate constant for the oxidation of V2+ calculated using Eq. (11) (7.20·10–5 cm·s−1 for 150 mM V3+/V2+ solutions and 2.33·10–4 cm·s−1 for the 300 mM V3+/V2+ solutions) is of the same order of magnitude than the standard rate constant values reported on classical electrodes (e.g. k 2 0 = 2.5·10–5 to 4.69·10–4 cm·s−1 on glassy carbon [37]). To compare the experimental data, we drew in the Fig. 5 the mathematical representation of the kinetic model of Eq. (16). In this model estimation, we used the kinetic parameters found with the transient experiments (α = 0.57, γ = 1) and an average value of the apparent kinetic rate constant was considered ( k app - = 9.69·10–7 cm·s−1) to normalize the experimental data and correct the uncertainty on the collection efficiency. Fig. 5 illustrates the good agreement of the model predictions with the RRD experimental data and demonstrates the applicability of the rate law established in this work governing the kinetic of reaction (1). Furthermore, Fig. S16 reveals that the concentration of H+ does not affect the overall rate of reaction at sulfuric concentration above 1 M. This confirms that the oxidation of V2+ is the rate determining step of the mediated electron process in this range of protons concentration."
13,Conversion study,"5.3 Conversion study In order to confirm the proposed kinetic rate law and to extend the validity range of the model, a conversion study was performed by discharging 1.44 M V3+/V2+ (SOC = 85%) electrolyte solution in 2 M H2SO4 over 25 ± 1 mg Mo2C. The reaction was studied by monitoring the flowrate of H2 produced (flowmeter) and the state-of-charge of the electrolyte (UV–vis). The variation of the protons concentration along the reaction was not considered. The production of hydrogen was recorded during 35 min before the detection limit (5 mL·min−1) was reached (Fig. S17). After this period of time, the electrolyte state-of-charge was measured to about 20% (UV–vis calibration curve, Figs. S18–S20). Fig. 6A shows the experimental rates of reaction as a function of the SOC and the concentration of V2+. The model-predicted rates of reaction were plotted using Eq. (21). Fig. 6B illustrates the evolution of V2+ concentration throughout the reaction. To plot the model-predicted evolution of V2+ concentration during the reaction, the following differential equation was solved: (22) v r x n = - 1 2 ∂ n V 2 + ∂ t = k a p p n V 2 + n V t o t - n V 2 + 0.57 n V 2 + V The volume of the reactor was considered to remain constant during the reaction (V = 50 mL). The apparent kinetic rate constant, k app, was calculated to 2.23·10–5 cm·s−1 by fitting to the first recorded experimental data (at t = 3 min). The net increase of the measured apparent kinetic rate constant (compared to the values measured for RRD experiments) is due to a change of the electrocatalytic surface. In absence of the Nafion layer, the surface diffusion of reactant increases resulting in an increase of the apparent kinetic rate constant. The good agreement between the kinetic model and the experimental data corroborate the rate law suggested in this work, in which the kinetics is governed by the rate of the oxidation of the adsorbed V2+ on Mo2C."
14,Model predictions for the production of hydrogen in a semi-batch reactor,"5.4 Model predictions for the production of hydrogen in a semi-batch reactor The kinetic model was used to predict the production of hydrogen and determine the optimal conditions to discharge 1L of a commercial vanadium electrolyte (1.6 M V3+/V2+, 2 M H2SO4). The process simulations were conducted in an isothermal semi-batch heterogeneous reactor (1L) for the chemical discharge of the electrolyte. The reactor includes an outlet for extracting hydrogen flow in order to keep the pressure constant (Fig. 7 A). The load of electrocatalyst was fixed at 0.1% w/v and the reaction was conducted at 20 °C and 1 bar. At the end of the discharge, the electrolyte is flowed through an electrolyser unit where the electrolyte is charged back at a constant current of 20 A (Fig. 7A). On the basis of the previous experiments, the kinetic parameters implemented in the simulation were α = 0.57, γ = 1 and k app = 8.91x10–4 cm·s−1 (for 1 g of electrocatalyst). The process simulations were performed with Matlab™ (version R2018a). Fig. 7B predicts the time profile for the hydrogen generated in a semi-batch reactor for different initial SOCs comprised between 0.2 and 0.9. As expected, the production rate of hydrogen increases with the increase of SOC. Since the amount of V2+ fed to the reactor is larger at higher SOC, the total amount of hydrogen produced for a given conversion increases. The energy required to charge back the electrolyte is then proportional to the amount of V3+ that need to be reduced back, and thus to the time of electrolysis. Consequently, it becomes relevant to evaluate the optimal SOC to complete efficiently the reaction in terms of time and energy consumption. Fig. 7C compares the cycle time (discharge + charge) for various hydrogen demand ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mol per cycle as a function of the initial SOC of the electrolyte. For a given hydrogen demand per cycle, the discharging time depends on the initial SOC of the electrolyte, but the charging time remains constant. The results of the simulation show that the cycle time decreases when the reaction is conducted at high SOCs for a given hydrogen demand. Each curve reveals a vertical asymptote corresponding to the minimum value of initial SOC required to enable the generation of the desired amount of hydrogen. Interestingly, a threshold value for the initial SOC can be extracted at the maximum curvature of the curve. Below this value, the process becomes time-consuming and not optimal for an efficient production of hydrogen."
15,Conclusion,"The reaction kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction through the chemical oxidation of V2+ on a commercial Mo2C (β-form, hcp structure) [21,30] electrocatalyst was studied. Considering that the overall rate of reaction was determined by the rate of the oxidation of the adsorbed V2+ onto V3+ on the electrocatalyst, we established a kinetic rate law depending on the state-of-charge of the vanadium electrolyte, the concentration of V2+ and the amount of catalytic site. The corresponding reaction orders were determined by examining the dependence of the overall rate of reaction while varying one kinetic parameter and keeping the others in excess. A first order dependence was observed on the concentration of V2+ and on the catalyst load. Then, we determined an exponential factor of 0.57 on the ratio V2+/V3+, which is in accordance with the expected charge transfer coefficient of the redox couple V3+/V2+. In order to validate the proposed kinetic model, measurements of the reaction rates at steady-state conditions were carried out using an adapted RRD method. The approach consists in immersing a rotating Mo2C film deposited on a non-electrically connected glassy carbon disc - Pt ring electrode in the vanadium electrolyte in a dynamic mode. The resulting hydrogen produced is flowed radially and oxidized back on the platinum ring. The overall rate of reaction is related to the recorded signal and depends on the collection efficiency of the apparatus. The Mo2C film-Pt device was prepared by dropcasting a catalyst ink on a commercial GC-Pt RRD and recovering the electrically isolated disc with a Nafion layer. The Mo2C film was fully characterized by studying the stability, the activity and the electrochemical active surface area of the catalytic layer by electrochemical measurements. The kinetic experiments were carried out for 150 mM and 300 mM V3+/V2+ electrolyte solutions in 2 M H2SO4 at SOC ranging from 15 to 75%. The apparent kinetic rate constant was adjusted to 9.69·10–7 cm·s−1 to fit the experimental data. A good agreement was observed between the model-predicted and experimentally measured rates of reaction. To further validate the kinetic model, the chemical oxidation of a 1.44 M V2+/V3+ in 2 M H2SO4 was completed in a stirred tank reactor. The reaction was followed by monitoring both the hydrogen flowrate and the SOC of the bulk electrolyte during the reaction. The strong agreement between the model and the experimental data suggests that the kinetic model proposed in this work is an efficient tool to predict the kinetic of the vanadium-assisted hydrogen evolution on Mo2C catalyst in high acidic conditions. Finally, process simulations were performed for an isothermal semi-batch reactor. The results of the simulations emphasize the optimal SOC to discharge efficiently the electrolyte for various demands in hydrogen. The ability to control the hydrogen production and to optimize the charging and discharging time is important to design a flexible process able to deal with the fluctuating nature of the electrical grid."
