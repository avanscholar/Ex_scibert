0,Introduction,"With increasing public awareness about the environmental impacts and depletion of fossil fuels, hydrogen production from biomass is considered as one of the effective and excellent solution towards green energy production due to the fact that the CO2 produced from gasification is balanced by photosynthesis through biomass growth. However, the water content of biomass is generally high, in the range of 90% or even higher, and thermochemical conversion needs prior drying which, in turn, consumes a large amount of energy. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is an emerging technology that has been developed to treat hazardous wastewater streams as well as producing green gases such as hydrogen [26]. Supercritical water can dissolve most organic substances and gases and has low viscosity and excellent mass transfer. In oxidation above the critical conditions of water (374°C, 22.13MPa) all organic compounds are present in a single, dense fluid phase, minimizing mass-transfer resistance and facilitating rapid reaction rates. Gaseous product composition from supercritical water gasification of glucose significantly depends on the reactant concentration [1] and temperature [2,3,4]. In the last decades, there have been a lot of studies carried out on gasification of wet biomass [1,3,5,6,7,8], and aqueous organic wastes [9,10,11] in supercritical water. Enhancement of biomass conversion through oxidation in supercritical water [2,12] or partial oxidation [13,14,15] has been also studied. Catalysts play an important role in hydrogen production from biomass gasification in supercritical water by increasing hydrogen yield, reducing tar and char formation, and affecting organic matter gasification efficiencies, defined as the percentage of biomass converted into gas, of up to 98%. Watanabe and co-workers [14] studied the effect of different catalysts on the gasification of biomass model compounds in batch reactor at a temperature range of 400–440°C and observed that the yield of H2 from n-C16 and lignin with zirconia was twice as much as that without catalyst at the same conditions whereas the H2 yield with NaOH was 4 times higher than that without catalyst. However, Yu and Antal [1] reported that the achievement of 95% or higher gasification efficiency in supercritical water requires a reaction temperature above 600°C. Courson et al. [16] and Wang et al. [17] reported that nickel catalysts cracked tar and promoted water–gas shift, methanation, and hydrogenation reactions. From economic and energy efficiency points of view, high gasification efficiency at low temperatures with higher hydrogen yield is favorable. Nickel has a high melting point of 1453°C and is a readily available cheap metal, which makes it a suitable and reasonable choice for supercritical water gasification and oxidation. Homogeneous catalysts such as KOH and NaOH, which can easily dissolve in SCWG to produce hydrogen-rich gas, cause corrosion of reactor wall [5,30]. Minowa et al. [18] reported that reduced nickel catalyst enhanced the gasification of cellulose and water gas shift reaction in hot compressed water. From an economic perspective, lower temperature gasification that coincides with maximum hydrogen and methane rich fuels is favorable [15]. Therefore, in this study, we have demonstrated a new approach of introducing hydrogen peroxide as an oxygen source after 15min of reaction time for glucose gasification in supercritical water at relatively low temperatures i.e. 400–500°C. Hydrogen peroxide can help to decompose aromatic rings by radical reactions that are not gasified during supercritical water gasification (SWG) in the first 15min of the reaction time [19]. The yield of hydrogen is expected to increase via CO formation by partial oxidation of the intermediate products as well as char and tar formed prior to H2O2 injection. In this work, different loadings of nickel on theta(θ) and gamma(γ) alumina catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method [20] and were tested for supercritical water gasification (SCWG) and supercritical water partial oxidation (SWPO) at a temperature range 400, 450, and 500°C to investigate catalysis of hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Reduced commercial nickel on silica alumina and glucose were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (50% H2O2 solution) was obtained from EMD Chemicals Inc (Gibbstown, NJ, U.S.A). De-ionized water obtained from a compact ultrapure water system (EASY pure LF, Mandel Scientific co, model BDI-D7381)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume were determined from nitrogen adsorption- and desorption isotherm data obtained at −193°C in a constant-volume adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2010) using 99.995% pure N2 gas obtained from Praxair (Oakville, Canada). The prepared samples were degassed at 150°C for 5h before measurements. γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 were used as catalyst supports for catalyst synthesis. Calcining γ-Al2O3 to 1050°C at a rate of 10°C per min converts γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3. Catalyst synthesis by the incipient impregnation method was described elsewhere [20]. For a typical synthesis, the required metal salt solution was prepared in a volume of pure water corresponding to 115vol% of pore volume of alumina (0.248cm3/gm, measured by Micromeritics ASAP 2010) used for catalyst support. The required amount of nickel is calculated from the nickel present in NiNO3·6H2O. All alumina was dipped into the solution at once for uniform metal dispersion. The pelletilized catalyst was then placed in a closed beaker of 10vol% NH3-H2O solution for ammonia treatment for 10min at 60°C inside the oven. Metal salt converts to ammonium salt by ammonical treatment which increases the activity and Ni dispersion [21]. Amoniacal treatment converts metal salt anion to ammonium salt. The NH3-H2O vapor treated catalysts were then taken out from the closed beaker and dried from 60°C to 120°C for 2h, and then temperature was elevated to 250°C for 1.5h. In this step most of the ammonium salts attached to the catalysts are removed by sublimation. Hydrogen reduction and thermal treatment at 600°C for 2h was done afterwards, in a stream of 10vol% H2 diluted with N2 with a rate of 6L/h. The rate of temperature increment from room temperature was 3°C/min. The reduced catalysts were weighed to measure actual loading of nickel from the difference between support alumina and nickel loaded catalyst. In our synthesis the actual loading was little less than calculated loading. For instance, the calculated 8wt nickel on alumina was actually approximately 7.5wt% nickel on alumina, calculated 12wt% loading was found 11wt% and 20wt% loading was 18wt%. Due to diffusion limitations, in order to achieve high nickel loadings, impregnation was repeated more than once. For example, while the 7.5wt% nickel on θ-Al2O3 was loaded in one step incipient impregnation, the 18wt% nickel was synthesized in three steps wherein the reduced 7.5wt% nickel/alumina was further impregnated to approximately 14wt% nickel/alumina and then to 18wt% nickel/alumina. Table 1 portrays the summery of surface area, pore size and pore volume of gamma (γ) and theta (θ) alumina and synthesized catalysts."
4,Apparatus,"2.3 Apparatus Fig. 1 portrays a schematic diagram of the experimental system setup. Experiments were performed in the main reactor body which was obtained from the Autoclave Engineers, Erie, Penna, U.S.A. The reactor was constructed of Hastelloy C-276 with a capacity of 600ml, with a maximum pressure rating of 41.4MPa and maximum temperature rating of 343°C. The reactor was a batch reactor, but allowing for sampling of gas and liquid samples throughout the experiments. The reactor was heated with a 1.5kW electrical furnace that surrounded its main body supplied by the same manufacturer. From the pressure-temperature rating of the Hastelloy alloy published on the manufacturer's web site, the reactor was able to sustain a higher temperature of maximum 500°C at a lower pressure level of 36MPa, which facilitated operation above the supercritical conditions of water (374°C, 22.13MPa)."
5,Experimental procedures,"2.4 Experimental procedures The experimental procedures consisted of several steps started by opening and washing the reactor body thoroughly with distilled water to remove any residual carbon from previous experiments. The catalyst and 70ml of de-ionized water were added to the reactor, after which it was closed and purged with helium gas at a constant pressure of 0.2MPa for 20min to drive away all the air and oxygen that may be present in the system. After purging with helium, the outlet valve (VO1) was closed and the pressure in the reactor increased to 0.7MPa to prevent water evaporation during the heating phase. The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature, and the pressure was increased accordingly to about 22.8MPa. After reaching the desired temperature, the reactor was left for 5min to stabilize. Subsequently, the feed was injected into the reactor against its pressure by employing an ISCO syringe pump (Model 100 DX, Lincoln NE, USA). As soon as the feed injection was complete, the reaction time (t) started. After 15min of reaction time, a known amount of hydrogen peroxide was injected into the reactor in a similar manner to the feed. After 30min, the valve (VO1) was opened to allow for effluent gases to pass through the condenser (Double pipe H/E), where it cooled and then depressurized using a Swagelok piston-sensing high pressure reducing regulator (KHP series Solon, OH, USA). The cooled depressurized effluent passed to a gas liquid separator from which the gases left the separator to pass through an in-line filter to remove any moisture prior to the OMEGA mass flow meter (FMA 1700/1800 series 0–2L/min, Laval (Quebec), Canada). The mass flow meter was equipped with a totalizer that utilizes a K-factor to relate the mass flow rate of an actual gas to nitrogen, the calibrated reference gas. The actual gas flow rate was calculated by determining the average K-factor for the produced gas by the mean of the mole fraction of each gas in the stream, as shown in equation (1) (1) Avg K factor = 1 / K ref ∑ y i K factor ( l ) where Kref is the K-factor for the reference gas, and yi is the mole fraction of the individual components. The actual gas flow rate was calculated by (2) Q total = Avg K factor × Q ref where Qtotal is the mass flow rate of the actual gas and Qref is the mass flow rate of the reference gas. After passing through the mass flow meter, the product gases were collected in 3L Tedlar gas sampling bags."
6,Gas & liquid analysis,"2.5 Gas & liquid analysis The gaseous products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and 120/80 D Hayesep stainless steel 3.18mm ID, 6.2m nickel packed column (Grace Davidson, City and State). Helium was used as the carrier gas. The gas chromatograph was calibrated using a standard gas mixture of known composition. The analysis was performed manually using 1ml SGE gas tight syringe (Model number 008100, Reno, NV USA) by collecting the sample from the gas bag. Multiple injections were performed and the results were averaged to minimize analytical error. The liquid effluent was analyzed for chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile fatty acids (VFA's), ethanol, and pH. Total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (TCOD, SCOD) were measured using HACH methods and test kits (HACH Odyssey DR/2500). Individual VFAs were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Varian 8500) with a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a fused silica column (30m×0.32mm). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 5ml/min. The temperatures of the column and detector were 110, 250°C, respectively. For alcohol measurement, the same instrument with a refractive index detector (RID) was used. pH was measured using OAKTON portable pH meter (Model WD-35615-22)."
7,Yield calculations,"2.6 Yield calculations Calculation of product gas yield and carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) was performed by the same procedure used by Yu and Antal [1]. The aforementioned authors calculated the CGE as (CGE=(mol carbon in gas)/(mol carbon in feed)) and measured gas yields (yield=(mol of gas species produced)/(mol of glucose in feed)). The maximum theoretical hydrogen that can be produced from glucose (C6H12O6) following the method proposed by Cortright et al. [22] is 12H2 in accordance with equation (3), comprised of 6 moles generated directly together with 6CO2 and 6CO formed from glucose through partial oxidation with the latter (6CO) reacting with H2O to produce another 6H2 through the water–gas shift reaction (Equation (4)). (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 6 CO 2 + 12 H 2 and the water–gas shift reaction (4) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Methane reforming reaction (5) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 The hydrolysis reaction, whereby glucose is converted to intermediates plus gaseous products, with the intermediates undergoing further gasification precedes the gasification reactions depicted in Equations (4) and (5). COD destruction efficiency was defined as [ ( ( COD initial − COD final ) / ( COD initial ) ) × 100 ] , and was selected as a parameter to track the liquid effluent quality and to optimize, together with maximum hydrogen yield in gasification and partial oxidation of glucose in supercritical water."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Effect of M.R and temperature on gas and liquid product distribution,"3.1 Effect of M.R and temperature on gas and liquid product distribution A series of non-catalytic partial oxidation experiments (A, B, C, and D) were conducted at 400°C at different molar ratios (MR) to optimize the maximum hydrogen yield in the product gas (Fig. 2 ). Runs A1 and F1 which are duplicates of A and F illustrate the reproducibility of experimental data. The maximum yield of hydrogen was observed at a MR of 0.8 as well as the highest amount of CO (experiment C). This MR of 0.8 was selected because it provided the highest hydrogen and CO yields that could help promote the water–gas shift reaction for more hydrogen production (equation (4)). The CO2 yield at a MR of 0.8 was higher than 0.5 and 0.7, but lower than 0.9, which is attributed to the availability of oxygen to convert CO to CO2 by direct oxidation. The optimized MR of 0.8 was selected as a base line for the higher temperatures of 450 and 500°C. The effect of the temperature on the partial oxidation without catalyst is depicted in Fig. 2 (experiments E, and F). By increasing the temperature from 400 to 500°C, hydrogen yield increased from 0.2 to 0.5mol/mol glucose, which is attributed to the higher conversion at higher temperatures [27]. CO2, CH4 yield also increased whereas CO remains almost same which is also similar to the reported results by Holgate and Tester [2]. Accordingly, a temperature of 500°C and MR of 0.8 were selected as the base line for the catalytic experiments. Based on the work of Lee et al [8], CO concentration increased and hydrogen yield decreased at a reaction temperature below 650°C. This is due to the endothermic reforming reaction by the organic acid formation. The COD reduction efficiency was above 90% in all experiments except for experiments A, and B where it 76% and 85%. The lower COD reduction efficiency is explained by the lower MR of 0.5 used and eventually the lack of oxidant. Due to the limitation in our reactor, we could not exceed a temperature of 500°C. The main aim of tracking the VFAs is to help identify the intermediate products, facilitate the understanding of reaction mechanisms, and eventually the development of kinetic models required for reactor design. Shanableh et al. [25,28] reported the formation of acetic acid as one of the residual main intermediates during SCWO and wet air oxidation of organic wastes. Table 2 exhibits the liquid effluent characteristics results. Moreover, the VFA's concentration observed in experiment (B) was more than 2.5 times compared to the other experiments. This is illustrated clearly in Fig. 3 in which the distribution of VFAs and ethanol is depicted. Acetic acid was the main component in all experiments with significant concentrations of propionic acid. Based on the comparison between experiments A, B, C, and D, all of which were run at 400°C but different MR ratios, it is evident that the residual VFAs decrease with increasing MR in the range of 0.5–0.9."
10,Effect of M.R and commercial catalyst amount on gas and liquid product distribution,"3.2 Effect of M.R and commercial catalyst amount on gas and liquid product distribution Experiments (G, H, I, and J) were conducted to investigate the effect of MR and catalyst amount on the product distribution as well as to compare between the commercial catalyst and the synthesized one at 500°C. Fig. 4 portrays the gas yield for these experiments. In experiment G, the hydrogen gas yield was almost the same as without catalyst, which is attributed to the potential inhibition of catalyst activity by oxidation of metallic Ni on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the experimental procedure of injecting the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) prior to the feed was manipulated by delaying the injection of the oxidant for 15min (that is, the feed was injected first and after 15min, the oxidant was injected). By using this procedure, catalyst inhibition could be mitigated and potentially more hydrogen could be obtained by oxidizing the intermediate products. This methodology increased the hydrogen yield from 1.1 to 1.5mol/mol glucose (experiments I, and J). This is due to the partial oxidation of the formed carbon species (tar and char) to form CO by the oxidant, with the CO reacting with the adsorbed methane on the catalyst surface dissociates to produce hydrogen [23,31]. Carbon monoxide may also undergo the water gas shift reaction catalyzed by Ni to produce more hydrogen. Comparing gasification results using 0.5 and 1g of catalyst (experiments H and I) showed that the amount of catalyst had no influence on the H2 fraction in the gaseous products. The liquid effluent characteristics are reported in Table 3 . In the present of metallic catalyst with no oxygen (i.e. MR=0), the COD destruction efficiency was 78% for both 0.5g and 1g of Ni commercial catalyst (experiments H and K). At a MR of 0.8 in experiment (J) the hydrogen yield increased from 1.1 in experiment (I) to 1.5mol/mol glucose and the COD reduction efficiency increased from 78% to 82%. On the other hand, the reduction of VFA's and TCOD concentration indicates that the presence of oxygen promotes the gasification process. This is confirmed by the higher yield of gases as well as lower liquid effluent TCOD in experiment J compared to I. The behavior of individual VFAs was monitored in all experiments (Fig. 5 ). In experiment (G), the (H2O2) was injected before the feed; thus, the (H2O2) dissociated and produced oxygen. The very low yield of all VFAs can be attributed to faster the oxidation reaction relative to the hydrolysis, as confirmed by the higher amounts of acetic and iso-butyric acids in the absence of oxygen (MR=0) in experiments (H and I) [28]. The increase in the catalyst mass from 0.5g in experiment H to 1g in experiment I yielded in almost complete disappearance of propionic acid and increase in the concentration of iso-butyric acid. In experiment (J), the presence of MR of 0.8 decreased the VFA's concentration and increased the gas yield. Meanwhile, Holgate et al [2] found that the stability of intermediate soluble products in glucose hydrolysis and oxidation varied considerably except for acetic acid, propenoic acid, and acetaldehyde. On the basis of the aforementioned reported data, it is hypothesized that the presence of oxidant slightly contributes to the decrease of both TCOD, and VFA's concentration by oxidizing the water soluble intermediates to gases such as H2, CH4, and CO."
11,Effect of the synthesized catalyst mass and nickel loading on gas and liquid product distribution,"3.3 Effect of the synthesized catalyst mass and nickel loading on gas and liquid product distribution Fig. 6 portrays the effect on the gaseous product by the synthesized metallic Ni on θ-alumina and γ-alumina supports. The maximum yield of hydrogen that coincided with the maximum COD reduction efficiency was observed in the 11wt% loading, and the trend of hydrogen yield was similar to the reported for gasification of lignin using Ni/MgO [24] where the H2 yield increased from 1.9 to 11%by increasing the amount of nickel deposited on MgO from 5 to 15wt% Ni/MgO. However, as the amount of deposited nickel increased to 20wt%, the H2 yield decreased to 9.3%. To investigate the effect of active metal surface area, the 18wt% Ni/θ alumina catalyst was crushed to a mesh size and employed in experiment (P), in which the hydrogen yield increased from 0.9 to 1.2mol/mole glucose. It was also noted that increase in Ni loading to 18wt% (experiment O) resulted in a sharp decrease in CO2 with a slight increase in methane. This is possibly because of the reaction of CO2 with hydrogen to form methane which could have consumed some of the hydrogen and eventually decreased its yield. The effect of catalyst support (experiments M and N) was found to be insignificant. As apparent from Table 4 , the increase of MR from 0.55 to 0.8 with the presence of 1.0g 7.5wt% synthesized Ni/alumina catalyst increased the COD reduction efficiency sharply from 66% to 88% (experiments Land N) whereas the increase in the catalyst amount from 0.5 to 1.0g had no influence on COD reduction efficiency (experiments K and N). Interestingly, increasing the catalyst surface area which increased the hydrogen yield did not affect any change in COD destruction efficiency. Based on the reported work of Yu et al [1] and Holgate et al [2], glucose decomposition in SCW has two pathways: high and low temperature pathways. In the high temperature pathway, glucose reforms and produces CO2 and H2. The formation of CO2 and H2 comes from the reaction of unstable free radicals with water which is given by Equation (3). The low temperature pathway occurs at temperatures levels from 400 to 600°C which is our temperature range. This pathway proceeds through the formation of acetic acid, propionic acid, and acetaldehyde. The formed intermediates then further decompose to CO2, CO, H2, and small amounts of CH4. The distribution of the individual VFAs reported in Fig. 7 is in good agreement with the low temperature glucose decomposition pathway. On the other hand, the individual VFA concentrations in experiment (K) were lower than the other experiments, which reveals that the increase in the catalyst mass favors the formation of VFA's and intermediate components. The free-radical oxidation reaction mechanism adds (OOH) to organic fragments that helps forming VFAs [29]. At MR of 0.8 and 1g catalyst mass (experiments M, N, O, and P), the acetic acid concentration was almost constant at different nickel loadings. Moreover, propionic and iso-butyric acids concentration had insignificant variation in all experiments. Goodwin and Rorrer [32] reported that acetic, butyric, and propionic acids are the major intermediates for the decomposition of glucose. The presence of CH4 in the gas products at all conditions supports the conclusion that glucose was being decomposed through acid intermediates [32]. According to Lu et al [6], CH4 was mainly formed by free-radical reactions as glucose is decomposed to gas through acid intermediates. Notwithstanding that the limited comparative assessment of the commercial and synthesized catalyst in terms of hydrogen yield and COD destruction efficiency only is not fair and overlooks the importance of catalyst activity and stability. Comparing experiment J (with commercial catalyst) and M (with synthesized catalyst) at the same temperature, molar ratio, and catalyst mass reveals that the H2 yield for the commercial catalyst is 50% higher than the synthesized catalyst H2 yield, albeit with 40% and 50% higher residual COD and VFA. With crushing of the synthesized catalyst, hydrogen yield increased by 20% to 1.2mol/mol glucose and thus the commercial catalyst surpassed the synthesized one by only 0.3mol/mol or 25% of the overall yield."
12,Conclusions,"Gasification and partial oxidation of glucose was performed in the presence of different metallic Ni loadings (7.5, 11, 18wt%) on different catalyst supports (θ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3) in supercritical water at three temperature levels, viz., 400, 450, and 500°C. The hydrogen gas yield increased with the increase in temperature. The hydrogen yield was relatively insensitive on the pellet catalyst at nickel loading above 11wt% as well as the different catalyst supports. The commercial Ni/silica–alumina catalyst surpassed the synthesized Ni/alumina in terms of H2 yield by 0.3mol/mol glucose due to the higher active metal surface area the commercial Ni/silica–alumina catalyst posses. Glucose was completely gasified, even at lowest tested MR of 0.55. The presence of molar oxygen slightly enhanced the decomposition of the intermediate products to form gaseous products. The concentrations volatile organic fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid, butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, valeric acid) and ethanol in the liquid phase were measured and reported. The gaseous products were composed mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), and methane (CH4). The COD destruction efficiency reached as high as 97%. The relatively low hydrogen yield of 1.5 and 1.0mol/mol glucose obtained was due to limitations in reactor temperature."
