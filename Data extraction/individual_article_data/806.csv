0,Introduction,"The ever-growing world’s population, accompanied by its energy demands and environmental effects has been a matter of concern. Primarily, coal and petroleum are used in running variety of energy consuming gadgets. The major hitch to these energies is the high level of environmental pollution which forms the backbone of global warming. The drawbacks associated with these energy systems have necessitated the search for a clean, sustainable and renewable form of energy with zero carbonaceous emissions. Molecular hydrogen, is the best choice since it is a preferred energy carrier and could effectively store energy [1–3]. High energy density and ability to be converted from one energy form to another are other forms of advantages associated with hydrogen [1,4]. Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach that leads to the production of highly purified hydrogen in large quantity [5–7]. Furthermore, it proved to be the cleanest and safest form of energy with zero emissions of carbon substances [8–10]. However, due to large overpotential in electrocatalytic process, high electrical energy is required to overcome the high overpotential. To reduce energy loss, designing efficient and favorable catalyst towards hydrogen evolution is required. Traditionally, Pt metal was considered the best choice but due to high cost, low reserve and severe surface poisoning limits their general applications [11–16]. Recently, transition metal complexes of Co [17], Ni [18], Fe [19] and Mo [9] have emerged as alternatives to platinum. Despite this achievement, high efficiency and durability could not be promised since the metal in the complex could easily be displaced in highly acidic and basic media [20]. Metal macrocyclic compounds of porphyrins [21], corroles [22], corrins [23] and phthalocyanines [24] have been reported as promising electrocatalysts due to their high chemical and thermal stability and interesting electrochemical properties. Metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) are well noted for their applications in hydrogen evolution [25–27] due to their rich redox properties. Koca and co-workers studied on oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions on phthalocyanine modified electrodes. They concluded that CuPc and CoPc are efficient in hydrogen evolution compared to H2Pc and ZnPc in aqueous media [25]. Akyuz and co-workers studied on electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution on reduced graphene oxide electrode decorated with CoPc. They reported HER in PBS whose current density was enhanced by 15-fold and overpotential lowered by 340 mV (pH = 3.4) and 380 mV (pH = 7.4) with respect to bare GCE [1]. Ozcesmeci and co-workers synthesized CoPc bearing four redox active cobaloxime (CoDMG) substituents ((CoDMG)4-CoPc)) and applied them towards electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Their catalyst demonstrated a current density increase by 10-fold compared to ordinary CoPc. Also, the catalysts overpotential decreased by 360 mV [24]. Against this background, it is evident enough that CoPc could effectively catalyse molecular hydrogen when modified. Based on this inspiration, we explored alternative system to improve electrocatalytic behaviour of CoPc towards hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report a new strategy to construct MWCNT/Py-Py nanocomposite, serving as an axial linker to cobalt phthalocyanine through noncovalent interactions via MWCNT on GCE support. The result obtained explains the enhanced electrocatalytic activity introduced by our coordinated axial ligand system."

3,Synthesis of Co(II)phthalocyanine 1,"2.2 Synthesis of Co(II)phthalocyanine 1 Co(II)phthalocyanine was synthesized using modified lithium metal-alcohol procedure [28]. In this procedure, Lithium metal (69 mg, 10 mmol) was added to 5 mL n-butanol and refluxed at 150 °C under N2 atmosphere until the lithium is fully dissolved. 4-tert-butylphthalonitrile (360 mg, 1.95 mmol) was then added and the resulting mixture refluxed for 2 h at 150 °C. The solvent was removed and product purified by silica gel chromatography using CH2Cl2: MeOH (100:2) as the eluent. A dark green solid product (2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butylphthalocyanine) of yield 55.5% (200 mg) was obtained. For simplicity, it was labelled H2Pc. H2Pc (200 mg, 0.27 mmol) and Co(OAc)2. 4H20 (260 mg, 1.08 mmol, 4 eq) were dissolved in 20 mL DMF and refluxed at 180 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere. DMF was removed by distillation and the crude product purified by alumina gel column chromatography with CH2Cl2: MeOH (100:5) as the eluent. The target compound was obtained in 90% (180 mg) yield. MALDI-TOF-MS: m/z = 795.16 ( Figure S4 ) (calcd for C48H48CoN8 [M]+ = 795.33). FT-IR (KBr, ν, cm−1): 3445 (w), 3151 (w), 3065 (w), 2958 (vs), 1725 (s), 1612 (m), 1525 (s), 1485 (m), 1398 (m), 1358 (s), 1325 (m), 1258 (s), 1199 (m), 1151 (m), 1092 (s), 938 (m), 885 (w), 825 (m), 752 (s), 685 (m), 665 (m), 565 (w), 539 (w), 517 (w) ( Figure S5 )."
4,Functionalization of MWCNTS,"2.3 Functionalization of MWCNTS A 0.3 mM (2.3 mg) Py-Py was mixed with 5.0 mg MWCNT and sonicated for 30 min in 5 mL isopropyl alcohol (IPA) nafion mixture. The mixture was stirred for 24 h, filtered, washed and dried under vacuum for 24 h and labelled MWCNT/Py-Py composite. To this composite mixture (MWCNT/Py-Py), 1.0 mM CoPc 1 was added and the mixture stirred for 12 h under room temperature in 5 mL IPA solution. This mixture was filtered, washed with 5 mL IPA (to remove any weekly adsorbed CoPc), dried under vacuum and labelled 1/MWCNT/Py-Py. The unfunctionalized MWCNTs (5.0 mg) were also mixed with CoPc (1.0 mM), and prepared under same reaction conditions and process (sonicated, stirred, filtered, washed and dried) to give 1/MWCNT. The prepared materials (1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT) were used for SEM, UV, and FT-IR characterizations."
5,Electrode modification and electrochemistry,"2.4 Electrode modification and electrochemistry A total of 5 µL suspension of MWCNT/Py-Py was drop coated on GCE and allowed to dry for 1 h. Prior to drop coating the suspension onto GCE, the surface was polished with 0.05 µm alumina, washed and ultrasonicated to remove any adhered Al2O3 particles. It was rinsed with ethanol and dried under ambient temperature for about 10 min. The modified GC (GC/MWCNT/Py-Py) was immersed in a 1.0 mM CH2Cl2 solution of 1 and stored overnight to achieve coordination. The modified electrode was removed from the CoPc solution, dried and dipped into dry CH2Cl2 for 5 min with gentle agitation to remove any weekly adsorbed CoPc [22,29–32]. It was air-dried for 1 h, labelled as 1/MWCNT/Py-Py and ready for HER experiments as illustrated in Scheme 2 . To prepare GC electrode modified 1/MWCNT, we firstly coated a polished GC surface with 5 µL MWCNT suspension, followed by immersion in 1.0 mM solution of 1 overnight. The modified electrode was also air-dried, gently agitated in dry CH2Cl2 for 5 min and kept under room temperature for 1 h. It was labelled 1/MWCNT and used as modified working electrode for HER. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using Chi-730D electrochemistry workstation. It consists of a three-electrode-compartment cell; Glassy carbon electrode served as working electrode while platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes respectively. Electrocatalytic activities towards HER were investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0), 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7) and 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14) solutions saturated by bubbling high purity N2, 30 min prior to each measurement. Aqueous solutions were prepared freshly using Milli-Q water. Potentials observed using Ag/AgCl were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation, E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059pH + E0 Ag/AgCl; Where E Ag/AgCl is the experimentally determined potential using Ag/AgCl reference electrode; E0 Ag/AgCl is 0.199 V at 25 °C [33]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Spectroscopic investigations,"3.1 Spectroscopic investigations The absorption spectra of CoPc 1 in CH2Cl2 showed absorption peak at 340 nm (B-band) arising from the π-LUMO transition and peaks at 600 and 678 nm (Q-band) attributed to π-π* transition from HOMO-LUMO of the Pc ring [34,35] (Fig. 1 a). Pyridine-Pyrene (Py-Py) showed strong π-π* transition absorption peaks between 300 and 350 nm originating from the pyrene moiety [32]. The UV data measured from the mixture of 1 and Py-Py indicates there is a coordination between 1 and Py-Py as shown in Fig. 1a, (labeled 1/Py-Py). Our target material, (1/MWCNT/Py-Py) reveals significant change in UV–Vis absorption wavelength indicating a configurational change in our system (Fig. 1b). It is important to state that the appearance of pyridine-pyrene peaks in 1/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT/Py-Py further illustrates coordination between the pyridinic “N” of our Py-Py and the central metal of the CoPc 1. FT-IR characterizations showed peaks at 1398 cm−1 (CN) [36], 1612 cm−1 (CC stretching) [4] , 1650 cm−1 (CC) and 3065 cm−1 (CH stretch vibration on the aromatic ring) [24] for CoPc 1. Also, the appearance of other absorption bands at 3110 cm−1, 1360 cm−1, 1100 cm−1, and 750 cm−1 are all indications of phthalocyanine ring formation [37,38] ( Fig. 1c). Composites made up of 1/MWCNT and 1/MWCNT/Py-Py all indicates the presence of 1 in the mixture whereas 1/MWCNT/Py-Py further reveals the presence of Py-Py as indicated with dotted lines (Fig. 1d, bottom ). Additionally, the morphological appearance of the composite materials (1/MWCNT and 1/MWCNT/Py-Py) were investigated using SEM. As shown in Fig. 2 reveals the morphology of a regular MWCNT, 1/MWCNT, 1/MWCNT/Py-Py. When MWCNTs were mixed with CoPc 1, there appeared no clear aggregation indicating a fine encapsulation between MWCNTs and CoPc. Mixture of 1, MWCNT and Py-Py (1/MWCNT/Py-Py) provided an appreciable increase in thickness of the nanotubes. The appreciable thickness could be due to the presence of Py-Py in the composite material (Fig. 2c)."
8,Electrocatalysed HERs in acid media,"3.2 Electrocatalysed HERs in acid media Electrocatalytic activity of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT towards HER were first examined in 0.5 M H2SO4 using LSV at 50 mV/s. Notably, 1/MWCNT/Py-Py exhibits a lower overpotential of 448 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 which is smaller than that of 1/MWCNT whose overpotential at same j value is 544 mV (Fig. 3 a). Besides, a smaller Tafel slope of 83 mV/dec was obtained for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py as compared to 1/MWCNT whose Tafel slope was 137 mV/dec (Fig. 3b). According to Chen and Lasia, Tafel plots are basically used to determine the mechanism of a catalytic reaction and a low Tafel slope predicts a favorable kinetics [39]. Zhu et al. in their work indicates low overpotential, low Tafel and high current densities are properties of a good electrocatalyst [40]. These enhanced properties exhibited by 1/MWCNT/Py-Py compared to 1/MWCNT emphasizes its efficiency to evolve molecular hydrogen more. It is a known fact that double layer capacitance (Cdl) is linearly proportional to electrochemical surface area (ECSA) [41]. To determine the catalytic activity relative to electrochemical surface area, CV curves of our composite materials (1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT) were measured in non-Faradaic region at different scan rates [42,43] (40–140 mV/s1) as shown in Fig. 3c and Figure S6 a (see ESI). The observed double layer capacitance of 1/MWCNT is twice that of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py (Fig. 3d) illustrating its ability to facilitate hydrogen more [44]. Nevertheless, electrocatalytic activity of 1/MWCNT was less than 1/MWCNT/Py-Py. This occurrence is not strange as similar behaviour was reported by Ulla and co-workers where a much higher ECSA material rather showed a less catalytic activity [45]. Wang and co-workers also reported similar phenomenon where a higher ECSA material, Ni-Rgo2.0/Ni foam (Cdl = 7.92 mF/cm2) showed less electrocatalytic activity compared to Ni-rGO1.0/Ni foam (Cdl = 6.53 mF/cm2) [10]. In addition, Sabhapathy and co-workers showcased similar behaviour where a less catalytic activity (in terms of onset and overpotential @ j = 10 mA/cm2) was exhibited by a higher ECSA material compared to that of lower ECSA material [5]. These experimental evidences in addition to ours indicate not all active sites on electrode surface effectively facilitate HERs [10,45]. Controlled bulk electrolysis experiments conducted at applied potential of 0.45 V vs RHE showed H2 gas bubbles produced in larger quantity few seconds after the start of experiment. Comparatively, a charge built-up of 0.35C was produced by 1/MWCNT/Py-Py within 95 secs while 1/MWCNT produced same charge at 750 secs (Fig. 3e). This further indicates the enhanced catalytic performance of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py material. Stability and durability are benchmarks for a good electrocatalyst [46]. To evaluate this, we run amperometric i-t curve for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py at j = 10 mA/cm2 for 4 h. The i-t curve (Fig. 3f, insert) suggests our product maintained about 95% overpotential, indicating a superior stability of our product. LSV measurements of our product was taken immediately after the amperometric test and compared to the LSV curve before the i-t experiment. The data as seen in Fig. 3f (main) shows insignificant change compared to the initial curve indicating excellent stability of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py."
9,Electrocatalysed HERs in other media,"3.3 Electrocatalysed HERs in other media HER activities were further examined in PBS(aq) at 50 mV/s. At j = 10 mA/cm2, 1/MWCNT/Py-Py exhibited an overpotential which is 340 mV less than that of 1/MWCNT (even at 5 mA/cm2) indicating its enhanced catalytic activity (Fig. 4 a). As reported earlier, Akyuz and co-workers at pH = 3.4 and 7.4 had their overpotentials lowered to 340 and 380 mV respectively [1]. Herein, at pH = 7.0, we have lowered the potential to 340 mV which is 40 mV lowered than their work at similar pH. Other properties of efficient catalyst such as more positive onset potential, lower Tafel slope and higher current density were comparatively exhibited by 1/MWCNT/Py-Py (Fig. 4a-b). The double layer capacitance obtained from scan rates (Fig. 4c and Figure S6 b) accompanied by its ECSA value indicates 1/MWCNT/Py-Py is less as shown in Fig. 4d, a behavior same under acidic conditions. Controlled-bulk electrolysis as shown in Fig. 4e revealed at 1000 sec, a charge built-up to 0.35C and 0.15C were generated for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT respectively, owing to large volumes of H2 produced by 1/MWCNT/Py-Py. Stability and durability of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py were also confirmed in this media using LSV and amperometric i-t curve as shown in Fig. 4f. Electrochemical response of the composite materials was also tested in KOH at 50 mV/s. A more positive onset potential (-0.3 V vs RHE) was recorded for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py compared to 1/MWCNT whose onset potential was −0.4 V vs RHE (Fig. 5 a). At j = 10 mA/cm2, an overpotential of 400 mV and 517 mV were generated for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT respectively. Fig. 5 b displays the Tafel plot which shows a slope of 120 mV/dec and 157 mV/dec for 1/MWCNT/Py-Py and 1/MWCNT respectively. This shows 1/MWCNT/Py-Py improves the reactions kinetic by presenting a lower Tafel slope, more positive onset potential and lower overpotential. The ECSA behavior (Fig. 5 d) of the catalysts is similar as reported in both acidic, and neutral media with same reasons attached. Controlled-bulk electrolysis of the materials at −0.4 V vs RHE shows a charge built-up at 900 secs of 0.35C and 0.10C for 1/MWCNT/Py and 1/MWCNT respectively (Fig. 5 e). At this stage the target product once again showed higher H2 bubble than the later. This is another indication of an enhanced performance of 1/MWCNT/Py-Py brought up by the introduction of Py-Py moiety. Amperometric i-t measurements conducted at −0.55 V vs RHE indicates the target material retains its electrocatalytic behaviour within a period of 4 h (Fig. 5 f, insert). Evaluation of the catalysts stability after running the amperometric i-t test showed minimal changes in the LSV curve (Fig. 5 f). This means our target product (1/MWCNT/Py-Py) in all aspects is a highly stable material for electrocatalysis towards HERs."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, a composite material of Py-Py and MWCNT with Co(II)phthalocyanine axially ligated (1/MWCNT/Py-Py) was applied as electrocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reactions in aqueous media. Compared with 1/MWCNT, our target material (1/MWCNT/Py-Py) showcased outstanding hydrogen evolution characteristic properties indicating more positive onset potentials, lower overpotentials, lower Tafels, higher current densities and superior stability in all media. The enhanced catalytic feature of the target material ensued from the Py-Py linker which served as a bridge between the MWCNT and Co(II)phthalocyanine. These exciting behaviour of our target material pave way to potentially apply it in future fuel cells.
