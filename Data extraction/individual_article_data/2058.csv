0,Introduction,"The chemistry of amines, amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds plays a central role in modern organic synthesis [1,2]. The relevance of these compounds takes its foundations from several important facts, for instance, the interaction between nitrogenated compounds with living organisms is a basic issue in the pharmaceutical [2] and agrochemical industries [1,2,4]. Therefore, the development of new and efficient methods to prepare N-containing derivatives is of particular relevance in these arenas. The N-alkylation with alkyl halides is a very well-known method for the synthesis of amines [2]. This typically involves conversion of the alcohol into the corresponding alkyl halide or other alkylating agent, followed by a nucleophilic substitution with appropriate C- or N-nucleophiles. However, the production of large amounts of salts as by-products is not a desirable aspect from the point of view of the green chemistry and the atom economy. The reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones is another classical method, which has been widely employed as a useful tool in the synthesis of amines. Nevertheless, this method requires the use of strong reducing agents and it is difficult to selectively yield mono-alkylated products [3]. An interesting alternative method for the formation of a C–N bond is the N-alkylation of amines with alcohols [4]. This is an efficient procedure, since it does not generate any harmful and/or wasteful co-products (only H2O as by-product). In addition, alcohols are more readily available starting materials than the corresponding halides or carbonyl compounds used in other methodologies. This reaction involves the conversion of alcohols into amines according to Scheme 1 . The catalyst reacts with alcohol i removing hydrogen to yield the corresponding aldehyde ii. In the presence of an amine, such aldehyde is converted into the imine iii by a condensation reaction, and the latter reacts with the metal-hydride produced in the first step to yield the amine iv. Moreover, the alkylation of amines is a thermodynamically favored process where the breaking of a C–O bond to yield a C–N bond, is largely compensated by the formation of H2O. Several heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been developed for the alkylation of amines. To name few: silica [5], aluminum oxide [6], Raney-nickel [7], copper (simple or oxide) [8,13b] have been used as heterogeneous catalysts. The first homogeneous catalyst for that kind of reaction was introduced in 1981 by Grigg et al. [9] and Watanabe et al. [10]; since then, complexes of iridium [12,11], rhodium [10], ruthenium [13] and platinum [14] have been used as homogeneous catalysts. However, relatively few reports have been disclosed for the alkylation of amines using alcohols employing palladium catalysts. In this context, the use of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) as efficient catalysts in organic reactions has attracted considerable interest, particularly if they are rapidly and systematically generated from homogeneous molecular Pd precursors to yield active species for a variety of catalytic processes [15]. Most of the examples where palladium nanoparticles are used as catalysts are mainly focused in C–C coupling reactions [16]. To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of examples for the use of PdNPs have been devoted to C–N coupling reactions. Worthy to mention is the one by Ranu and co-workers [17], where PdNPs were used in allylic amination reactions. Recently Sabater and co-workers [18] reported a bifunctional metal Pd/base catalyst for the selective mono-alkylation of amines with alcohols. In recent years, our group reported the synthesis and use of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) in cross coupling reactions leading to the desulfurization of dibenzothiophene [19]. These PdNPs were synthesized by thermal reduction of precursors such as [(L)PdMe2] (L=PEt3, PPh3, dippe=1,2-bis(di-isopropyl)phosphino-ethane) and dppe=1,2-bis(diphenyl)phosphino-ethane), Scheme 2 shows the basic reactions leading to PdNPs. The use of such PdNPs in desulfurization along with stabilizing agents like hexadecylamine resulted in a good catalytic performance of such nanoparticles, with a typical diameter size of 3–6nm and low agglomeration in the reaction media. Herein, we report the use of such PdNPs in the catalytic alkylation of amines by alcohols under mild conditions (Scheme 3 ). The current disclosed results illustrate one of the few reports dealing with the use of PdNPs for this kind of reaction."
1,Results and discussion,"In order to asses the general reactivity of PdNPs in the amine alkylation reaction, one equivalent of the complex [(dippe)PdMe2] (1) [dippe=1,2-bis(di-isopropyl)phosphino-ethane)], used as PdNPs precursor [19], along with five equivalents of hexadecylamine were reacted with methanol as alkylating agent and solvent, at 100°C during 72h. The results for these experiments are summarized in Table 1 . As found in Table 1, the alkylation reaction of hexadecylamine using methanol without hydrogen showed the lowest activity (Table 1, entry 1). In contrast, the highest yield was obtained at 250psi to give the dialkylated amine as the only product in 93% (Table 1, entry 3). Noteworthy, a decrease in the activity was observed using a higher hydrogen pressure (Table 1, entry 4), probably due to the deactivation of the reactive PdNPs by the hydrogen excess leading to the formation of inactive palladium hydrides. In order to establish the best PdNPs precursor for the amine-alkylation reaction, the best reaction conditions found on using (1) (Table 1, entry 3) were applied to the use of the analog complex [(PEt3)2PdMe2] (2) [19] as shown at Scheme 4 . In comparison, the use of complex 1 as PdNPs precursor gave a better performance (93% yield) than the use of complex 2 (70% yield), under the same reaction conditions. Differences in activity between these two precursors has been observed previously in cross coupling reactions leading to desulfurization [19]. This fact may be adduced to differences in the degree of stabilization of the nanoparticles and/or nanoparticle-related intermediates. Particularly, the chelate effect and basicity of the dippe present in the PdNPs precursor, probably inhibited agglomeration and prevented their precipitation from the reaction medium. With the aim of extending the scope of this reaction, a variety of alcohols were further tested under the same reaction conditions, also using the same alkylamine and nanoparticle precursor. Relevant results are summarized in Table 2 . As can be seen on Table 2, high conversions are generally obtained for alkyl alcohols (>80%). To note, now the selectivity of the process is prone to the mono-alkylation when bulky alcohols are used (Table 2, entries 1 and 2), with a lower yield on increasing the bulkiness of the corresponding alcohol from isopropanol to tert-butanol (Table 2, entry 2). In sharp contrast, the use of aromatic alcohols such as phenol did not resulted in any activity at all, at first glance this could be attributed to the non-availability of a β-hydrogen, which may allow the conversion of the alcohol into the corresponding aldehyde [4]. However, a tertiary alcohol such as tert-butanol showed very good reactivity (Table 2, entry 2). Therefore, an alternative explanation to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1 is needed. We speculate in an explanation invoking the elementary steps involved in the dehydration of alcohols, to generate a carbocation needed to react with the primary amine to yield the new substituted amine. Since this reaction regularly requires an acid reaction media, it is proposed that Pd(II) species may be catalyzing such reaction; this proposal is represented on Scheme 5 [20,21]. Considering the above-discussed results made under stoichiometric amounts of PdNPs, at this point is worthy to note that just a minor amount of metallic palladium atoms would be in the surface to be active in catalysis. Thus, catalytic amounts of PdNPs were assessed for this process, using alkyl amines and alcohols as substrates. Table 3 summarizes the relevant results for such catalytic experiments. In general, the use of catalytic amounts of PdNPs results in good to moderate yields. Particularly, the use of 2mol% of (1) for the alkylation of hexadecylamine by methanol and isopropanol allowed the highest conversions, 70% and 60%, respectively (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). The reaction with isopropanol is selective towards the mono-alkylation. Meanwhile, the dialkylation of the amine with methanol is observed. Lower yields were obtained on using a load of 1mol% of catalyst (Table 3, entry 4). Also, lower conversions on using cyclohexylamine and isopropanol were obtained (Table 3, entries 3 and 5), probably due to significant steric hindrance in both substrates. A complementary mechanistic proposal was recently formulated by Zhang et al. for the alkylation of amines with alcohols under catalytic conditions [22]; from these studies, the occurrence of a hydrogen-borrowing process, started with the oxidation of the alcohol to form the corresponding carbonyl compound, is postulated similarly as illustrated in Scheme 1."
2,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we developed a method where the use of PdNPs afforded the N-alkylation of amines employing alcohols as alkylating agents in good yields (>80%) under neat conditions and low hydrogen pressure. The reaction allowed the production of di-alkylated or mono-alkylated amines, depending on the nature of the alcohol. Such selectivity is sensitive to the size of the alcohol, yielding mono-alkylation products when bulky alcohols are used and dialkylation when small alcohols are used. Likewise, good yields were obtained using catalytic amounts of PdNPs."
3,Experimental,"All manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques and a MBraun glovebox (H2O and O2 <1ppm) under high-purity argon (Praxair 99.998%). Stainless steel Parr pressure vessels 4750 (125mL) were used for catalysis experiments. Methanol and isopropanol (J.T. Baker) were dried and distilled from the corresponding Grignard reagent. Tert-Butanol (>99%; Aldrich) were distilled and degassed by the freeze–pump–thaw method prior to use. MeMgBr (3.0M in THF solution) was purchased from Aldrich and was used as received. (COD)PdCl2 and hexadecylamine were purchased from Aldrich, dried in vacuo and used without further purification. PEt3 was purchased from Aldrich and was also used without further purification. 1,2-Bis(diisopropylphosphino)ethane (dippe) was prepared as reported [23]. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and were stored over 3Å molecular sieves in the glovebox. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a 300MHz Varian Unity spectrometer in CDCl3. 1H chemical shifts (δ) are reported relative to the residual proton resonances in the deuterated solvent. 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded relative to external 85% H3PO4. All NMR spectra were carried out using thin wall (0.38cm) WILMAD NMR tubes with J. Young valves. GC–MS determinations were performed using an Agilent 5975C GC–MS equipped with a 30m DB-5MS capillary (0.32mm ID) column, using triethylamine as internal standard."
4,Nanoparticle precursors,4.1 Nanoparticle precursors Complexes [(dippe)PdCl2] (1) and [(Et3P)2PdCl2] (2) were prepared following the procedures reported in the literature [24]. The methylated compounds were prepared in situ by reaction of chlorinated compounds with excess of MeMgBr [25].
5,Typical procedure for the alkylation of hexadecylamine by methanol and related alcohols,"4.2 Typical procedure for the alkylation of hexadecylamine by methanol and related alcohols A typical experiment is described as follows: methylated catalytic precursor (1) or (2) (0.03g, 0.08mmol), hexadecylamine (0.075g, 0.313mmol for stoichiometric ratio experiments) and (0.483g, 2.5mmol for catalytic ratio experiments) were mixed with methanol (15mL, 368mmol) in the reactor vessel. This was closed, taken out from the glovebox. Then, in a well-vented fume-hood, the autoclave was pressurized with H2 to the corresponding pressure as indicated in Table 1 and heated to the desired temperature, under constant stirring. After 72h, heating was stopped and the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature, then, the remaining H2 was released to the fume hood. The vessel was opened to air and the reaction mixture was filtered in a Celite column, an aliquot of the mixture was immediately injected into the GC–MS. A second aliquot of the same mixture was also analyzed by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR."
