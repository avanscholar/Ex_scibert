0,Introduction,"With increasing concern about global warming and fossil fuel depletion, a demand for development of new and clean energy sources has increased dramatically [1,2]. In this respect, hydrogen is considered to be the most viable energy carrier due to its clean and non-polluting nature [3,4]. In particular, technological advances in hydrogen utilization such as fuel cell make hydrogen more important as a new energy carrier [1,5]. A number of catalytic reforming technologies, such as steam reforming [6–8], partial oxidation [9,10], auto-thermal reforming [11,12], and CO2 reforming [13,14], have been extensively investigated for the large and small scale hydrogen production from various hydrocarbons and alcohols. Among these reforming reactions, steam reforming has been recognized as the most feasible process for the production of hydrogen from methane. Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is abundant and mainly composed of methane, can serve as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure in modern cities may become more widespread in the future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential and on-board reformers in fuel cell applications. Although ruthenium- and rhodium-based catalysts exhibited a superior catalytic performance compared to other transition metal-based catalysts, nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in the commercial steam reforming processes due to their low cost and relatively high intrinsic catalytic activity [15–18]. However, nickel-based catalysts exhibit relatively weak resistance toward carbon deposition reaction which causes severe catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming reaction [18,19]. Therefore, conventional steam reforming process requires high reaction temperature (>800°C), high reaction pressure (20–40bar), and high steam to methane ratio (≈3) [16–19]. Undoubtedly, such severe reaction conditions are not favorable for on-site hydrogen production due to safety problems. Textural modification of nickel-based catalysts has been extensively studied to achieve high catalytic performance in the reforming reactions [20–24]. In particular, it has been reported that mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts exhibited high active nickel surface area and nickel dispersion for the steam reforming reactions [21–24]. In this respect, mesoporous Ni–Al2O3 catalysts have attracted much attention for improving catalytic performance in the reforming reactions. However, nickel–alumina catalysts with high Ni/Al atomic ratio were required for practical operation of fuel processor. In fact, it was previously reported that optimum Ni/Al ratio was 0.35 for maximum catalytic performance of nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst in the steam reforming of LNG [24]. Although they exhibited a high catalytic performance, nickel–alumina catalysts with high nickel content were obviously vulnerable to nickel sintering and carbon deposition during the long-term operation. To overcome these problems, addition of small amount of second metal such as Ca [25], Mo [26], Mg [27], Ce [28], and La [29] has been attempted to enhance the stability of nickel-based reforming catalyst [28,29]. However, decrease of catalytic reforming activity was inevitable when these second metals were added into nickel-based catalysts [25,26]. On the other hand, mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalyst containing small amount of second metal (M) has never been applied to the steam reforming reaction. Therefore, a systematic investigation of nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts with small amount of second metal (M) for hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG would be worthwhile. In this work, a series of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts with different second metal (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) were prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of second metal of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance in the steam reforming of simulated LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts A series of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts with different second metal (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) were prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method, according to the similar method reported in literatures [21–24]. A known amount of aluminum precursor (aluminum sec-butoxide, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol at 80°C with vigorous stirring. Small amounts of distilled water and nitric acid, which had been diluted with ethanol, were slowly added into the solution of aluminum precursor for partial hydrolysis of aluminum precursor. After maintaining the resulting solution at 80°C for a few minutes, a clear sol was obtained. The sol was cooled to 60°C. Known amounts of nickel precursor (nickel acetate tetrahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) and second metal (M) precursor (metal acetate hydrate form, Sigma–Aldrich) were then simultaneously added into the sol to obtain a nickel–M–alumina composite sol. After cooling the nickel–M–alumina composite sol to room temperature, a monolithic gel was obtained by adding an appropriate amount of water diluted with ethanol into the sol. The gel was aged for 7 days, and then it was dried at 50°C and 170atm for 24h in a stream of supercritical CO2. The resulting powder was finally calcined at 700°C for 5h to yield the mesoporous nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalyst. The prepared nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts were denoted as NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg), where M represents the second metal. For example, NiLaAE denotes a nickel–lanthanum––alumina aerogel catalyst with lanthanum as a second metal. Nickel loading and second metal loading in the NiMAE catalysts were fixed at 37wt% and 3wt%, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Chemical compositions of catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analyses. Textural properties (surface area, pore volume, and average pore size) of catalysts were examined using an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument. Crystalline phases of catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.541Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion and average nickel diameter of the catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5ml/min) and argon (47.5ml/min) at 700°C for 3h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50ml/min) for 15min at 700°C. The sample was then cooled to 50°C under a flow of argon (50ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was measured by periodically injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel dispersion and average nickel diameter were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (JEM-2000EXII, Jeol) were conducted to examine the nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts and to see the carbon deposition and nickel sintering on the used catalysts. Carbon deposition in the used catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG LNG used in this work was simulated LNG composed of methane (92.0vol%) and ethane (8.0vol%). Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 =4.6:0.4:10:30. Total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000ml/hg. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion, hydrogen yield, and CO x composition in dry gas were calculated according to the following equations on the basis of carbon balance. (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (2) Hydrogen yield ( % ) = F H 2 , out 2 × F CH 4 , in + 3 × F C 2 H 6 , in × 100 (3) CO x composition in dry gas ( % ) = F CO x , out F H 2 , out + F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out + F CO x , out × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural properties of nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"3.1 Textural properties of nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts Textural properties of NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . For comparison, textural properties of bare alumina aerogel [30] are also listed in Table 1. It was found that textural properties of NiMAE catalysts were strongly influenced by the identity of second metal. However, all the NiMAE catalysts exhibited high surface area (>253m2/g), large pore volume (>1.30cm3/g), and large average pore size (>14.0nm). The measured Ni/Al and M/Al atomic ratios of NiMAE catalysts were in good agreement with theoretical values. This means that all the NiMAE aerogel catalysts were successfully prepared in this work. Although pore volume and average pore diameter of NiMAE catalysts slightly decreased by the addition of nickel and second metal, overall textural properties of NiMAE catalysts were comparable to those of bare alumina aerogel. This can be understood by the fact that acetate groups in the nickel precursor and second metal precursor effectively controlled the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of aluminum precursor as chelating ligands during the preparation of NiMAE catalyst, resulting in the formation of NiO–Al2O3–MO x composite structure [23,31]."
7,Crystalline structure of calcined nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of calcined nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts calcined at 700°C for 5h. It is interesting to note that no characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to bulk nickel oxide were observed in all the NiMAE catalysts (solid lines in Fig. 1). Moreover, no distinctive diffraction peaks for second metal (M) oxide were detected in all the NiMAE catalysts. Instead, all the NiMAE catalysts exhibited three diffraction peaks indicative of nickel aluminate phase (closed circles in Fig. 1). An examination of diffraction peaks revealed that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 1) shifted to a lower diffraction angle, representing lattice expansion of γ-Al2O3 caused by the incorporation of Ni2+ ions [32,33]. This is because Ni2+ ions might be intimately located in the cationic deficient sites of γ-Al2O3, resulting in the formation of nickel aluminate phase in all the NiMAE catalysts, in good agreement with the previous results [34,35]. The above result indicates that nickel species were highly dispersed in the NiMAE catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase, regardless of the identity of second metal."
8,Nickel dispersion and average nickel diameter in the reduced nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"3.3 Nickel dispersion and average nickel diameter in the reduced nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts reduced at 700°C for 3h. It is noticeable that the diffraction peak of γ-Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 2) moved back to the original diffraction angle in all the reduced NiMAE catalysts when compared to the diffraction peak in the calcined catalysts (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all the reduced catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 2). This result indicates that nickel aluminate phase in all the NiMAE catalysts was completely reduced into metallic nickel during the reduction process employed in this work. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel dispersion and average nickel diameter in the reduced NiMAE catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts are listed in Table 2 . The amount of hydrogen uptake on the reduced NiMAE catalysts decreased in the order of NiLaAE>NiCeAE>NiYAE>NiCsAE>NiNiAE>NiFeAE>NiCoAE>NiMgAE. As a consequence, nickel disper-sion decreased in the order of NiLaAE>NiCeAE>NiYAE>NiCsAE>NiNiAE>NiFeAE>NiCoAE>NiMgAE. Average nick-el diameter increased in the order of NiLaAE<NiCeAE<NiYAE<NiCsAE<NiNiAE<NiFeAE<NiCoAE<NiMgAE. This was further confirmed by TEM images. No large agglomerates of metallic nickel were found in the reduced NiLaAE catalyst (Fig. 3(b)). However, NiNiAE (Fig. 3(a)), NiFeAE (Fig. 3(c)), and NiMgAE (Fig. 3(d)) catalysts retained relatively large aggregates of metallic nickel, representing relatively poor dispersion of metallic nickel. This result is well consistent with hydrogen chemisorption results (Table 2). This implies that the identity of second metal strongly affects the chemical properties of NiMAE catalysts."
9,Steam reforming of LNG over nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"3.4 Steam reforming of LNG over nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts Fig. 4 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen yields with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts at 600°C. All the catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the reaction. It is likely that high surface area, large pore volume, and large average pore diameter of NiMAE catalysts played an important role in facilitating internal mass transfer of reactant and product during the reaction. Highly dispersed metallic nickel species reduced from nickel aluminate phase in the NiMAE catalysts was also responsible for stable catalytic performance of NiMAE catalysts by suppressing nickel sintering during the reaction. Fig. 5 shows the effect of second metal (M) on the catalytic performance of NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG. It was found that catalytic performance of NiMAE catalysts was strongly affected by the identity of second metal. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield decreased in the order of NiLaAE>NiCeAE>NiYAE>NiCsAE>NiNiAE>NiFeAE>NiCoAE>NiMgAE. Among the catalysts tested, NiLaAE catalyst with lanthanum as a second metal exhibited the best catalytic performance in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen yield. Fig. 6 shows the correlations between average nickel diameter and catalytic performance of NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts in the steam reforming of LNG. It is interesting to note that both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield increased with decreasing average nickel diameter. These correlations clearly show that average nickel diameter played an important role in determining the catalytic performance of NiMAE catalysts. According to kinetic studies, hydrogen production by steam reforming of methane over nickel-based catalysts is closely related to the following adsorption mechanisms [36–38]. One is the dissociative adsorption of methane on the active nickel surface (equation (4)), and the other is the dissociative adsorption of steam on either the active nickel surface (equation (5)) or the support (equation (6)). Here, Nis and Ss represent adsorption site on the surface of nickel and support, respectively. (4) CH4 +Nis ↔CH2–Nis +H2 (5) H2O+NisO–Nis +H2 (6) H2O+Ss ↔H2O–Ss It is known that dehydrogenation of methane on the surface of metallic nickel (equation (4)) is a rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [39,40]. Furthermore, it has been reported that step-sites are more reactive than terrace-sites in the steam reforming reaction over nickel-based catalysts [15,18]. However, the number of step-site in specific nickel-based catalysts decreased with increasing nickel particle size [15,18]. Therefore, high catalytic performance can be achieved by decreasing average nickel diameter on the surface of reduced catalysts. As a result, NiLaAE catalyst with smallest average nickel diameter showed the best catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG."
10,Characterization of used nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts,"3.5 Characterization of used nickel–M–alumina aerogel catalysts Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of NiNiAE, NiLaAE, NiFeAE, and NiMgAE catalysts obtained after a 1000-min reaction. Compared to the reduced NiMAE (M=Ni, Fe, and Mg) catalysts (Fig. 3), relatively large agglomerates of nickel particles were observed in the used NiMAE (M=Ni, Fe, and Mg) catalysts (Fig. 7). Other used NiMAE (M=Ce, Y, Cs, and Co) catalysts also exhibited nickel sintering during the reaction, although they were not shown here. However, no significant nickel sintering was observed in the used NiLaAE catalyst (Fig. 7(b)) when compared to the reduced NiLaAE catalyst (Fig. 3(b)). In summary, relatively large metallic nickel particles in the reduced NiMAE (M=Ni, Ce, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) catalysts were vulnerable to sintering or aggregation, resulting in the significant nickel sintering during the steam reforming reaction. Interestingly, the used NiMgAE catalyst showed the filamentous carbon derived from the dissolved carbon on the active nickel surface. This might be because carbon deposition reactions (equations (7) and (8)) also competitively occurred on the surface of nickel catalyst during the steam reforming reaction [36,41]. (7) CH4 ↔C+2H2 (8) 2CO↔C+CO2 Furthermore, carbon deposition reactions require relatively large number of adjacent active nickel sites compared to steam reforming reaction [36,41]. In other words, carbon deposition reaction preferentially occurs on the surface of large nickel particles, and small nickel particles have strong resistance toward carbon deposition. Consequently, the amount of carbon deposition in the used NiMAE catalysts increased with increasing average nickel diameter, as can be seen from Tables 2 and 3 . Among the catalyst tested, NiLaAE catalyst with the smallest average nickel diameter exhibited the smallest amount of carbon deposition after 1000-min reaction. Furthermore, no significant morphological change was observed in the NiLaAE catalyst before (Fig. 3(b)) and after (Fig. 7(b)) the reaction, as mentioned earlier. This might be because the smallest average nickel size of NiLaAE catalyst effectively suppressed the nickel sintering and carbon deposition during the steam reforming of LNG. In conclusion, La was found to be the most efficient second metal for maximum production of hydrogen by steam reforming of LNG over mesoporous nickel-M-alumina catalyst."
11,Effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic performance of nickel–lanthanum–alumina aerogel catalyst,"3.6 Effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic performance of nickel–lanthanum–alumina aerogel catalyst Fig. 8 shows the catalytic performance of NiLaAE catalyst in the steam reforming of LNG, plotted as a function of total feed rate. It is known that heat and mass transfer had significant effect on the catalytic performance of reforming catalyst [42,43]. LNG conversion and hydrogen yield over NiLaAE catalyst were almost constant with regard to total feed rate. This implies that NiLaAE catalyst exhibited a strong capability of facilitating heat and mass transfer of reactant and product during the steam reforming of LNG. Fig. 9 shows the catalytic performance and CO x composition in dry gas in the steam reforming of LNG over NiLaAE catalyst, plotted as a function of reaction temperature. It was found that both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield increased with increasing reaction temperature from 450 to 700°C. This is because thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of steam reforming reaction monotonically increased with increasing reaction temperature [44,45]. On the other hand, CO/CO2 ratio increased with increasing reaction temperature. This can be understood by the fact that water–gas shift reaction (equation (9)) favorably occurs at low reaction temperature due to its exothermic nature [46,47]. (9) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 Fig. 10 shows the catalytic performance and CO x composition in dry gas in the steam reforming of LNG over NiLaAE catalyst, plotted as a function of steam/carbon (S/C) feed ratio. Hydrogen yield continuously increased with increasing S/C feed ratio up to S/C=4, whereas LNG conversion already reached saturation level at around stoichiometric value of S/C feed ratio (=2). Moreover, CO/CO2 ratio drastically decreased at S/C>2. Therefore, it can be said that water–gas shift reaction governed the overall steam reforming reaction over NiLaAE catalyst under the steam-rich reaction condition (S/C>2)."
12,Conclusions,"A series of mesoporous nickel–M–alumina (NiMAE) aerogel catalysts with different second metal (M=Ni, Ce, La, Y, Cs, Fe, Co, and Mg) were prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of second metal of mesoporous NiMAE catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic activity for steam reforming of simulated LNG was investigated. It was found that textural and chemical properties of NiMAE catalysts were strongly influenced by the identity of second metal. However, nickel species were finely dispersed in the NiMAE catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase, regardless of the identity of second metal. All the catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the steam reforming of LNG. Both LNG conversion and hydrogen yield decreased in the order of NiLaAE>NiCeAE>NiYAE>NiCsAE>NiNiAE>NiFeAE>NiCoAE>NiMgAE. Average nickel diameter played an important role in determining the catalytic performance of NiMAE catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, NiLaAE catalyst with the smallest average nickel diameter showed the best catalytic performance. It was also found that NiLaAE catalyst exhibited a strong capability of facilitating heat and mass transfer of reactant and product during the steam reforming of LNG. Catalytic performance of NiLaAE catalyst increased with increasing reaction temperature and steam/carbon (S/C) feed ratio. Water–gas shift reaction governed the steam reforming of LNG over NiLaAE catalyst under the steam-rich reaction condition (S/C>2)."
