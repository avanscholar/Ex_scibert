0,Introduction,"Due to their high formation enthalpy, good thermal stability and low flammability, 5,5′-azotetrazolate salts with different nitrogen-rich cations have been investigated intensively as potential high-energy density materials for military and industrial applications in the past decades [1,2]. Since the nitrogen-rich cations are easily bonded with the 5,5′-azotetrazolate group through replacement reaction [2–4], the oxidative-coupling of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (5AT) into 5,5′-azotetrazolate is the initial and critical step for the synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate energetic salts. Significantly, the conventional method of 5,5′-azotetrazolate synthesis mainly takes advantage of KMnO4 as oxidant to drive the oxidative-coupling of 5AT in alkaline condition [4–6]. To achieve a high yield, the reaction of 5AT with KMnO4 is usually conducted at a temperature of higher than 60 °C, but which can easily give rise to explosion accident. In addition, MnO2 is the inevitable by-product in the reaction, which requires careful separation during the purification of 5,5′-azotetrazolate compounds. Accordingly, there are several disadvantages of insufficient security and inconvenient purification in the conventional approach for the oxidative-coupling of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate compounds. Therefore, the development of an alternative synthetic methodology which is safe, convenient and environment-friendly direction is desirable. In recent years, photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis of organics has attracted attention in the interdisciplinary field of synthetic chemistry and PEC material science. Choi et. al reported the PEC oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) on BiVO4 photoanode under mild conditions in the absence of noble metal catalysts [7]. In their PEC system, hydrogen evolution was simultaneously observed on the cathode by the co-initiation of low bias and photoexcited electrons of BiVO4. Tateno et. al reported the PEC activation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone on WO3 photoanode at room temperature [8]. From these previous reports, the PEC approach could act as a green method to drive organic synthesis reaction at mild conditions using solar energy. Meanwhile, hydrogen could be obtained in the PEC cell during the organic reaction as valuable by-product. Therefore, the PEC synthesis of organics has obvious advantages in terms of reaction condition, avoidance of waste products, cost and added value of products over the conventional method for organics synthesis. For the oxidative-coupling of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate by conventional approach, its essence is that the KMnO4 oxidant initiates the dehydrogenation oxidative-coupling of 5AT. As is well known, semiconductor photoanode with a suitable valance band position has potential oxidizability to achieve desired PEC oxidation reaction (such as, water oxidation, hydrogen sulfide oxidation) [9,10]. In the present work, inspired by the previous works related to the PEC synthesis of organics and PEC water splitting [7–9], a Ti-doped Fe2O3 (Ti–Fe2O3) film consisting of porous nanorods was investigated as photoanode to construct a PEC cell with Pt wire cathode. In such a PEC cell, the oxidative-coupling of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen evolution were simultaneously observed at room temperature. The Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode showed a stable Faradaic efficiency of 65% for the oxidative-coupling of 5AT into sodium 5,5′-azotetrazolate (SZT) in 0.1 M NaOH solution at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, about 99% Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution was observed on the Pt wire cathode. More interestingly, our investigations found that the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes in Ti–Fe2O3 film could be reduced by magnetic field, thus higher synthesis efficiency of SZT and hydrogen was achieved in the Ti–Fe2O3-based PEC cell under a magnetic field of 0.5 T. The oxidative-coupling of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate on the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode was confirmed to be a typical holes-driven reaction which is kinetically favorable relative to water oxidation. The present work provides a green approach to produce 5,5′-azotetrazolate salts and H2 simultaneously using solar energy."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization of Ti–Fe2O3 film,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of Ti–Fe2O3 film The Ti doped Fe2O3 films (Ti–Fe2O3) were prepared by a method similar with to our previous works [11,12]. Briefly, fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, 20 × 10 × 2 mm, sheet resistance 7 Ω/square) was firstly cleaned using acetone, isopropanol alcohol and deionized water for 15 min under sonication, respectively. Then, 20 mL of aqueous precursor solution was prepared, containing FeCl3 (0.15 M, FeCl3·6H2O, ≥99.99%), urea (0.3 M, CO(NH2)2, AR, 99%), and 20 μL titanium trichloride (TiCl3, AR, 15.0–20.0% TiCl3 basis in 30% HCl). Next, the precursor solution was added into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and the precleaned FTO was placed into the precursor solution vertically. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 100 °C for 6 h, during which a Ti doped FeOOH film was formed on the FTO. Based on our previous investigation [12], a distinctive annealing process was used to treat the as-prepared Ti doped FeOOH film. Specifically, the Ti doped FeOOH film was directly put into a 250 °C furnace for annealing 8 min, and then annealed at 550 °C for 2 h and 650 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Due to the rapid dehydration of Ti doped FeOOH during annealing, some nanopores could be generated in the Ti–Fe2O3 nanorods (see Fig. 1 b and c). The morphological characteristics of the as-prepared Ti–Fe2O3 films were investigated by both field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55 VP, Germany) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Talos F200S). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Ti–Fe2O3 films was obtained by a Rigaku Ultima III X-Ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument with an unmonochromatized Al-Kα radiation. The absorption spectrum of Ti–Fe2O3 film was measured on a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). The photoluminescence spectrum of the Ti–Fe2O3 film was recorded using a SPEX 500 M spectrometer in air at room temperature with a 325 nm laser as excitation source. Since the Ti–Fe2O3 film was prepared on conductive side of FTO, a piece of magnet (20 × 10 × 5 mm, 0.5 T) was glued on the non-conductive side of FTO to investigate the influence of a magnetic field on the photoluminescence intensity of the Ti–Fe2O3 film."
3,"Photoelectrochemical synthesis of sodium 5, 5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen","2.2 Photoelectrochemical synthesis of sodium 5, 5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen Sodium 5,5′-azotetrazolate (SZT) and hydrogen was simultaneously synthesized in a PEC cell that consisted of a Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode and a Pt wire cathode. The PEC synthesis was conducted on a CH Instruments 660E electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode cell. The working electrode was the as-prepared Ti–Fe2O3 film, a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode (99.99%, CH Instruments), and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, CH Instruments) serviced as the reference electrode. 0.1 M NaOH with and without 0.05 M 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (5AT, CH3N5, >98.0%) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A 300 W xenon lamp with AM 1.5G filter (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source. The PEC measurement and reaction were conducted using back-side illumination (the light goes through the FTO substrate reaching the film) at room temperature (25 °C). For the PEC synthesis of SZT and hydrogen, the temperature of electrolyte was maintained at 25 °C by cooling the electrolyte for 30 min after every 1 h of reaction. The value of measured potential (vs. SCE reference electrode) was converted into the potential value vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) using the following formula. (1) E R H E = E S C E θ + E S C E + 0.0592 p H Where E RHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, E SCE is the measured potential vs. SCE, and Eθ SCE = 0.2415 V at 25 °C. During the PEC synthesis of SZT, the 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT electrolyte gradually changed from colourless to yellow. To confirm the presence of SZT after PEC reaction, the NaOH-5AT electrolyte was contrastively analyzed by UV–Vis spectroscopy using the SZT aqueous solution as a reference. The standard SZT sample was synthesized according to literature procedures [3,4]. The absorption spectrum showed that both the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction and the standard SZT solution have an obvious absorption peak at 418 nm (shown in Fig. 2 b). Therefore, the amount of SZT formed in the electrolyte was determined using the characteristic absorption peak of 418 nm (see Fig. S1). Liquid chromatography (Shimadzu liquid chromatography, LC-16) measurements were carried out to detect the presence and purity of SZT in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction. The detection was set at 254 nm using 50% CH3OH–H2O as the mobile phase, and the temperature was controlled at 25 °C. To evaluate the stability of Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode, the concentration of dissolved Fe in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after 8 h of reaction was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). After the PEC reaction (20 h), the electrolyte was concentrated at 70 °C for 5 h, then be cooled to 5 °C to form yellow SZT·5H2O precipitate. Finally, the SZT·5H2O precipitate was washed with water, filtered and dried in air at 60 °C. To improve the efficiency of PEC reaction, a magnetic field of 0.5 T was applied parallelly on the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode (see the diagram in Fig. S2). The effect of magnetic field on the charge recombination of Ti–Fe2O3 film was investigated by its photoluminescence spectrum and transient time constant (τ). The photoluminescence spectrum of the Ti–Fe2O3 film was recorded with different magnetic fields (0 T MF, 0.5 T MF, 1.0 T MF and 1.5T MF). The transient time constant (τ) of the Ti–Fe2O3 film is defined as the time when lnD = −1 in the normalized plots of lnD ∼ t (shown in Fig. 3 d). τ can reflect the general behavior of charge recombination and the lifetime of charge in conventional photoanodes [13,14]. Specifically, an anodic photocurrent spike (I in ) is usually appeared on the photoanode under a sudden illumination, which could be attributed to the bulk separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Immediately, a decaying photocurrent owing to the surface recombination of charge would be observed until a gradually stabilized photocurrent (I st ). To quantitatively determine the charge recombination behavior, a normalized parameter (D) is applied as follows: (2) D = ( I t − I s t ) / ( I i m − I s t ) where I t is the time-dependent, I st is the steady-state photocurrent, and I in represents the initial photocurrent. The Faradaic efficiency of H2 evolution [η(H2)] from the PEC cell was investigated in a single gas-tight cell at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The amount of H2 evolution was detected using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph. The value of [η(H2)] was calculated according to the Equation (3). (3) η ( H 2 ) = ( det e c t e d a m o u n t o f H 2 e v o l u t i o n ) × 100 / ( t h e o r e t i c a l a m o u n t o f H 2 e v o l u t i o n )"
4,"Synthesis and characterization of guanidinium salts of 5,5′-azotetrazolate","2.3 Synthesis and characterization of guanidinium salts of 5,5′-azotetrazolate Bis(guanidinium) 5, 5′-azotetrazolate (GZT) and triaminoguanidinium 5, 5′-azotetrazolate (TAGZT) were synthesized using the as-prepared SZT. 5H2O product for ion replacement reaction with guanidine nitrate and triaminoguanidinium nitrate at 75 °C, respectively. The morphology of the SZT.5H2O product was characterized by a laser scanning confocal microscope (LeicaTCSSP8). The functional groups of the SZT.5H2O, GZT and TAGZT product were determined by FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27). The IR measurement range was 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1, the number of scans were 32, spectrum resolution was 4 cm−1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the SZT.5H2O were recorded with a JEOL Eclipse 400 instrument in D2O at 25 °C. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the GZT and TAGZT were recorded with same NMR instrument in DMSO at 25 °C. Elemental analyses of the GZT and TAGZT were performed with a Vario III EL elementalanalyzer using classical dynamic combustion method. The elemental composition for the GZT product was found to be C: 16.8, N: 78.8, H:4.3, for the TAGZT product was C:12.7, N:82.2, H: 4.8, which are close with the calculated values of standard GZT (C4H12N16, 284.25) and TAGZT (C4H18N22, 374.33)."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterizations of Ti–Fe2O3 film,"3.1 Characterizations of Ti–Fe2O3 film Fig. 1a and b shows the typical SEM images of the as-prepared Ti–Fe2O3 film that was investigated as photoanode for 5AT oxidative-coupling reaction in the present work. Apparently, the Ti–Fe2O3 film is composed of dense nanoprisms with an average thickness of approximately 400 nm. Since the intentional regulation of FeOOH annealing process could induce its rapid dehydration [12], a porous microstructure was formed in the Ti–Fe2O3 nanorods (Fig. 1b and c). In our previous work, Ti–Fe2O3 films with porous microstructure have been demonstrated to be better photoanodes for PEC reaction owing to its superior light-harvesting and charge-transfer properties [12]. The EDS mapping and XPS investigations suggested that about 4% Ti was doped into the hematite. Due to the low doping ratio of Ti, the XRD pattern collected on the as-prepared Ti–Fe2O3 film indicated that the Ti-doped Fe2O3 is hematite (JCPDS 87–1165) (Fig. 1d). The XPS and UV–Vis light absorption investigations confirmed that the composition, chemical states and band gap of the as-prepared Ti–Fe2O3 film are in good agreement with the reported Ti-doped hematite (shown in Fig. S3) [15]."
7,"Synthesis of sodium 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in the PEC cell","3.2 Synthesis of sodium 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in the PEC cell Based on the PEC responses from the same Ti–Fe2O3 film in 0.1 M NaOH with and without 0.05 M 5AT, we firstly investigated the feasibility to achieve 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5,5′-azotetrazolate on the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode under AM 1.5G illumination. As shown in Fig. 2a, a higher photocurrent was observed on the Ti–Fe2O3 film when it was measured in 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT relative to in 0.1 M NaOH. Meanwhile, a lower onset potential of photocurrent (0.93 V vs. RHE) was observed on the Ti–Fe2O3 film in 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT in comparison with that in 0.1 M NaOH (1.02 V vs. RHE). Similar lower onset potential of reaction was found on the Ti–Fe2O3 film in 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT without illumination (Fig. S4). In addition, a distinct phenomenon have to noted that the NaOH-5AT electrolyte was gradually turning from colorless into yellow during the LSV measurements of the Ti–Fe2O3 film under AM 1.5G illumination (inset of Fig. 2b). It is well known that the photocurrent of the Fe2O3 film in colorless NaOH electrolyte is originated from its photogenerated holes-driven water oxidation reaction [11,12,16]. For the color of standard SZT aqueous solution, which is yellow due to the chromogenic property of the 5,5′-azotetrazolate group [2–4]. From the PEC responses on the Ti–Fe2O3 film in NaOH-5AT as well as the color-changing of electrolyte, we can deduce that the oxidative-coupling of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate may be initiated on the Ti–Fe2O3 film, and the 5AT oxidative-coupling is more kinetically favorable than the water oxidation. To check the presence of 5,5′-azotetrazolate in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction, we contrastively investigated the UV–Vis absorbance feature for the standard aqueous solution of SZT and our NaOH-5AT electrolyte. As exhibited in Fig. 2b, the standard SZT solution and the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction both show a absorption peak at 418 nm, indicating that the 5,5′-azotetrazolate was formed in the electrolyte. Liquid chromatography investigation further confirmed the formation of 5,5′-azotetrazolate in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction (Fig. S5). Meanwhile, the liquid chromatography result indicated that no by-product was formed in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte after PEC reaction, revealing the high selectivity (∼100%) of 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5,5′-azotetrazolate. By the UV–Vis spectrophotometry (see Fig. S1), the formation amount of 5,5′-azotetrazolate in the NaOH-5AT electrolyte and the Faradaic efficiency of the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode for 5AT coupling reaction were calculated. As shown in Fig. 2c, though water oxidation occurs as a side-reaction, the Faradaic efficiency of the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode for the 5AT oxidative-coupling is higher than 65% at 1.23 V vs. RHE. In theory, a corresponding reduction reaction would be initiated on the cathode of the Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell during the oxidation reaction be achieved on Fe2O3 photoanode [17,18]. In fact, hydrogen evolution was observed on the Pt wire counter electrode during the LSV measurements of Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode both in NaOH and NaOH-5AT electrolyte (see the Video 1 and 2 in Supplementary Materials). Although the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen evolution on the Pt wire electrode in two kinds of electrolytes is close (∼99%, shown in Fig. 2d), the hydrogen yield of PEC cell with NaOH-5AT electrolyte is higher than the NaOH electrolyte (Fig. 2d). In previous reports, it has been demonstrated that the hydrogen evolution activity of a conventional Fe2O3-based PEC cell is mainly restrained by the high overpotential that is required to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the water reaction on Fe2O3 photoanodes [19–21]. As indicated in Fig. 2a, the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode has faster kinetics on 5AT oxidative-coupling than water oxidation. Thus, it is not surprising that higher production of hydrogen was obtained in the PEC cell with NaOH-5AT electrolyte. From above observations, we could know that the solar-driven synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen can be simultaneously achieved in the Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell, and the PEC cell could produce more valuable product than the conventional PEC water splitting-cell.

8,"Improved the synthesis of 5, 5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen under magnetic field","3.3 Improved the synthesis of 5, 5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen under magnetic field To improve the efficiency of the Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell for 5AT oxidative-coupling and hydrogen evolution, a magnetic field of 0.5 T was parallelly applied on the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode (see the diagram in Fig. S2). As displayed in Figs. 3a and S6a, it is apparent that the photocurrent of Ti–Fe2O3 film is enhanced both in 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT under the magnetic field, while the dark-current of the Ti–Fe2O3 film is weakened (Fig. S6b). Significantly, the photocurrent onset potential remains unchanged regardless of applying a magnetic field, implying that the magnetic field has a promotional effect only on the PEC activity of the Ti–Fe2O3 film (Figs. 3a and S7). Further contrastive investigations confirmed that production efficiencies for both, the 5, 5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen, are improved under the influence of a magnetic field (Fig. 3b). In essence, the 5AT oxidative-coupling and hydrogen evolution are driven by the photon-generated holes and electrons of Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode, respectively. Under magnetic field, the enhanced production of the PEC cell should be closely related to the charge separation and transfer property in the Ti–Fe2O3 film. Accordingly, we investigated the carrier recombination feature of the Ti–Fe2O3 film under and without magnetic field through photoluminescence emission spectrum. As shown in Fig. 3c, the photoluminescence emission intensity of the Ti–Fe2O3 film is gradually enhanced with increasing magnetic field intensity. The photoluminescence of a semiconductor originates from the recombination-luminescence of its photoinduced carrier, and its photoluminescence emission intensity is proportional to P rad /(P rad + P non-rad ), where P rad is the radiative recombination ratio of the carrier, and P non-rad is the non-radiative recombination ratio of the carrier, P rad + P non-rad = 1 [22–24]. From the photoluminescence emission spectra, we could certain that the non-radiative recombination of carrier in the Ti–Fe2O3 film is reduced under magnetic field (Fig. 3d). In addition, the transient time constant (τ) of the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode under magnetic field was calculated to be 0.85 s, while a shorter τ of 0.325 s was found in absence of a magnetic field. These results revealed that the presence of a magnetic field could restrain the surface charge recombination of the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode. Our observations are in agreement with some related reports that the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts could be improved by the magnetic field [25–27]. In summary, the lower non-radiative recombination of surface charge of the Ti–Fe2O3 film under magnetic field should be the fundamental cause of enhanced efficiency of Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell."
9,"Sustained synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in PEC cell","3.4 Sustained synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in PEC cell The sustained synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in the PEC cell was investigated by applying a constant potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE on the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode. As shown in Fig. 4 a, both with and without magnetic field, the photocurrent of Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode gradually decreased with the reaction time. Accordingly, the amount of 5, 5′-azotetrazolate formed in the electrolyte increased with the reaction time (inset of Fig. 4a). Since the Ti–Fe2O3 film be of higher PEC activity under magnetic field, the production of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in the PEC cell with magnetic field was naturally higher than that the PEC cell without magnetic field. However, the presence of magnetic field has a slight influence on the Faradaic efficiency of Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode for 5AT oxidative-coupling and hydrogen evolution (Fig. 4b). To evaluate the Ti–Fe2O3 film stability for PEC synthesis reaction, contrastive LSV measurements were conducted for the same Ti–Fe2O3 film before and after 8 h of synthesis. The outcomes indicated that the PEC activity of the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode in fresh 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT electrolyte is the same as ever, even if after 8 h of synthesis reaction (Fig. S8). In addition, the ICP-MS investigation showed that only 10−7 M of Fe was detected in the NaOH-5AT solution that was used as the electrolyte for the 8 h reaction (Table S1). Therefore, the photocurrent attenuation on the Ti–Fe2O3 film during PEC synthesis can be ascribed to the decrease of 5AT PEC oxidation as the conversion of 5AT into 5,5′-azotetrazolate progresses in the electrolyte. Additionally, to check the potential presence of 5,5′-azotetrazolate degradation or reduction, we further conducted an investigation that the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode was photoelectrochemically reacted in 0.1 M NaOH-0.01 M SZT electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 4 h. After 4 h of reaction, the contrastive UV–Vis absorbance specta showed that the concentration of SZT in the electrolyte is not changed (see Fig. S9). This result indicated that the 5,5′-azotetrazolate is stable enough to resist the PEC degradation and reduction. After 8 h of PEC synthesis, the electrolyte was concentrated to form SZT. 5H2O precipitation (Fig. 4c). The identity of the SZT. 5H2O product was confirmed by FTIR and 13C NMR. As expected, the characterization results confirmed that the product obtained from the PEC cell is SZT. 5H2O (Fig. 4d) [4,28]. Furthermore, bis(guanidinium) 5,5′-azotetrazolate (GZT) (Fig. 4e) and triaminoguanidinium 5,5′-azotetrazolate (TAGZT) (Fig. 4f) were synthesized using the as-prepared SZT. 5H2O product for ion replacement reaction with guanidine nitrate and triaminoguanidinium nitrate, respectively."
10,"Mechanism of 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5, 5′-azotetrazolate on the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode","3.5 Mechanism of 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5, 5′-azotetrazolate on the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode Our results have confirmed that the 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5, 5′-azotetrazolate as well as hydrogen evolution can be simultaneously achieved in the Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell at room temperature. The mechanism of 5AT oxidative-coupling on the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode was investigated through a holes-scavenging investigation. Fig. 5 a shows the PEC responses of the same Ti–Fe2O3 film in 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT with and without 1.0 M Na2SO3. As is well known, SO3 2− is an efficient hole-scavenger that can be photoelectrochemically oxidized on photoanodes with favorable kinetics [29,30]. In the presence of Na2SO3, the photocurrent of the Ti–Fe2O3 film was obviously improved and its onset potential was shifted negatively, indicating that the PEC oxidation of SO3 2− is kinetically favorable relative to 5AT oxidative-coupling. Due to the presence of SO3 2− hole-scavenger, after 1 h of reaction at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination, the amount of 5, 5′-azotetrazolate formed in the NaOH-5AT-Na2SO3 electrolyte is negligible (no colour changing of electrolyte) (Fig. 5b). These observations suggested that the 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5,5′-azotetrazolate on the Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode is a direct holes-driven reaction. The in-situ photoluminescence emission spectrum of the Ti–Fe2O3 film collected in 0.1 M NaOH-0.05 M 5AT solution also provided indirect supporting for our conclusion. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photoluminescence emission intensity of the Ti–Fe2O3 film is obviously decreased due to the presence of 5AT, revealing that 5AT could react with the surface holes of Ti–Fe2O3 film and thus restrains its radiative recombination. Based on the results obtained above, the schematic diagram of the Ti–Fe2O3 film-based PEC cell for the synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen could be illustrated as Fig. 5d. Specifically, under illumination with solar light, the electrons and holes are generated from the conduction band and valence band of Ti–Fe2O3 film, respectively. Since an external bias is applied between the Ti–Fe2O3 film and the Pt wire, the photogenerated electrons are directionally transferred to the Pt wire electrode through the outer circuit, then the hydrogen evolution reaction be initiated. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes are staying on the Ti–Fe2O3 film to drive the 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5,5′-azotetrazolate. Due to the presence of a magnetic field, the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes in the Ti–Fe2O3 film is reduced, and thus the synthesis efficiency of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen in the PEC cell be improved. In comparison with the traditional PEC cell for water splitting, the present PEC cell can produce more valuable product of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and H2 with higher efficiency. In addition, the PEC synthesis approach shows obvious superiorities in operation security, product purification and added value of products over the conventional method for the synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate salts."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a PEC cell constructed with a Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode and a Pt wire cathode was investigated to drive the 5AT oxidative-coupling into 5,5′-azotetrazolate as well as hydrogen evolution simultaneously. Since the 5AT oxidative-coupling on Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode is kinetically more favorable than the water oxidation, a stable Faradaic efficiency of 65% was obtained on the Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode for the synthesis of 5,5′-azotetrazolate at room temperture. Simultaneously, hydrogen evolution was initiated on the Pt wire cathode by the photogenerated electrons of Ti–Fe2O3 film photoanode with about 99% Faradaic efficiency. In presence of a magnetic field, the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes on Ti–Fe2O3 film is reduced, and higher synthesis efficiency of 5,5′-azotetrazolate and hydrogen was achieved in the PEC cell under a magnetic field of 0.5 T. Our work provides a green approach to produce 5,5′-azotetrazolate salts and H2 simultaneously using solar energy."
