0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is a highly attractive feedstock for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals [1–4]. An important method for converting the lignin fraction of biomass is through pyrolysis, which produces a high oxygen content oil [4]. The pyrolysis oil is a complex mixture of aromatic compounds and lignin-derived oligomers so that further upgrading, through oxygen removal via deoxygenation, is required to form useful products. However, the highly functionalized nature of these compounds makes it difficult to selectively form desired products [5–7]. Previous studies indicated that product selectivity was strongly correlated to the adsorption geometry of these oxygenates, where flat-lying configurations result in higher production of decarbonylation products, which are undesired, and upright conformations favor C—O bond activation, producing the desired hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) products [6,8]. It has been shown on Pd(111) that high surface coverage of furfuryl alcohol favors selectivity towards the HDO product, methylfuran, because the reactants are forced into the upright configuration [8]. It was found that on Pd(111) there are two HDO pathways, a low-barrier direct transfer of H atoms between alcohol adsorbates and a high-barrier H transfer via metal-bound H atoms [8]. However, this direct H transfer is poorly understood, hampering efforts towards designing catalyst surfaces or processes that can capitalize on this low-barrier pathway. In designing effective and efficient catalysts for HDO, both Pt and Pd must be considered due to their ability to activate H2, which is necessary in HDO. However, little is known if Pt and Pd catalyze the reaction of these oxygenates in the same way. A previous study found that furfural undergoes decarbonylation and decomposition on Pd(111) to produce furan, propylene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen [7]. In contrast, no furan is produced on Pt(111); instead furfural undergoes an unselective decomposition to propene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen [9]. It was found that this is due to furfural binding in such a way that it adsorbs only through the aromatic ring which facilitates a C—C bond scission and ring-opening at low temperatures [9]. Taylor et al. found that furan was also produced as a result of furfural decomposition on Pt(111) [10]. They found that selectivity to furan as compared to furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran depended on the precoverage of both furfural and hydrogen. Low coverages of furfural resulted in a planar adsorption geometry that resulted in a hydrogen-bonding network to form between aromatic hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens, while higher coverages caused furfural to bind in a tilted geometry that disrupted the network. Further, supported Pt and Pd nanoparticles catalyze furfural in different ways. Bhogeswararao and Srinivas [11] found that at room temperature Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were selective for CO hydrogenation to produce furfuryl alcohol while Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were active for both CO and ring hydrogenation to produce furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran. At higher temperatures, Pt catalysts facilitated hydrogenolysis to create methylfuran and furan ring-opening products while Pd catalysts are selective to decarbonylation of furfural and furfuryl alcohol [11,12]. Detailed information about the reactivity differences between Pt and Pd can be elucidated by conducting surface-level mechanistic studies of furfuryl alcohol on Pt(111). This contribution focuses on the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) studies of furfuryl alcohol decomposition on the Pt(111) surface. Further, surface science techniques using isotopic reactants on single crystals can provide a fundamental understanding of the direct H transfer mechanism, as well as determine the most effective catalyst for utilizing the low-barrier hydrodeoxygenation reaction."
1,Materials and methods,"Both TPD and HREELS experiments were conducted in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) apparatuses described in detail in previous publications [13,14]. Briefly, TPD experiments were performed in a chamber equipped with a Smart-IQ + quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Scienta). Fragmentation patterns for all relevant species were obtained either by recording a mass spectrum during exposure or from the multilayer desorption spectrum. The Pt(111) sample (Princeton Scientific) was mounted on tantalum foil which was spot-welded to two tantalum filaments. The temperature was monitored by a spot-welded thermocouple placed between the sample and the tantalum foil backing. In this chamber, the sample was cooled through thermal contact with a liquid nitrogen reservoir. Furfuryl alcohol was dosed onto the surface using a direct dosing line pointed at the sample surface and exposure-dependent measurements were conducted by varying the pressure in the dosing line and tracking the change in the chamber pressure after dosing. To estimate the yield of products in TPD experiments, the desorption peaks were integrated using the trapezoidal rule. The coverage of CO produced from furfuryl alcohol that underwent decarbonylation was determined by integration of the CO desorption peak, which was related to the area of the CO desorption peak for a 5 L [15] (0.58 monolayer, saturation for Pt(111) [16]) dose of CO applied to the clean surface. Reported decarbonylation yields represent an upper bound due to the presence of some contaminating CO. Product yields from TPD experiments were estimated using a previously described method [17] for peak area corrections using mass spectrometer sensitivity factors; it is noted that the method was developed for a different mass spectrometer model, and therefore should be considered approximate. HREELS experiments were performed in a chamber equipped with an LK model ELS3000 high-resolution electron energy spectrometer (LK Technologies) and a model 981–2046 sputter gun (Varian) for cleaning. The Pt(111) sample was mounted on a 1.5 mm tantalum disk and held onto a copper stage using two metal clips. The temperature was measured using a thermocouple which was welded onto the stage directly adjacent to the tantalum disk. HREELS experiments were conducted at a specular angle of 60° with respect to the surface normal. To study the thermal chemistry, the crystal was annealed at various temperatures for a few seconds and then cooled before collecting spectra. Cooling below room temperature was accomplished through a liquid nitrogen cooled air line located in thermal contact with the sample backing. It is important to note that the HREELS and TPD chambers utilized different sample holders. Whereas the HREELS system employed a mount with a more remote thermocouple for ease of sample transfer, the TPD system was designed for better temperature control via direct contact of the thermocouple with the Pt surface. The more remote thermocouple location on the HREELS system resulted in lower temperature readings than expected, as determined by the desorption temperature of CO, which was under-reported by approximately 50–80 K. Comparisons between TPD and HREELS temperatures should take this offset into account. Both chambers operated at a base pressure of approximately 10−10 Torr. The Pt(111) crystals were cleaned primarily through cycles of cooling and heating in 1 × 10−7 Torr O2 between 373 and 900 K. When this cleaning method was insufficient, mild sputtering with Ar+ ions (1–3 keV) and annealing at 900 K was used. Furfuryl alcohol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich at 98% purity and was further purified using repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Ultrahigh-purity O2, CO, and Ar were obtained from Matheson Trigas."
2,Results,
3,Temperature-programmed desorption,"3.1 Temperature-programmed desorption Fig. 1 shows a TPD spectrum of species desorbing from Pt(111) after a saturating furfuryl alcohol exposure. On Pt(111), furfuryl alcohol (m/z = 98) molecular desorption was detected from the monolayer in a broad peak between 255 K and 420 K, while a liquid-like multilayer phase that did not saturate at larger exposures can be seen at 255 K. Dehydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol produced furfural (m/z = 96) which desorbed in a broad peak with a maximum of 365 K. Hydrogen (m/z = 2) originating from this dehydrogenation and other reactions was produced in multiple peaks at 330 K and 420 K. Furan (m/z = 68), a decarbonylation product of furfuryl alcohol, was observed in a peak at 365 K while carbon monoxide (m/z = 28) was detected as a desorption-limited product at 405 K. Studies that we conducted of molecularly dosed furan on Pt(111) show that furan desorbs between 210 K and 310 K, depending on the surface coverage (Fig. S1). This suggests that furan desorbed in a reaction-limited process, likely from decarbonylation of furfural. CO can be produced from furfural through the aldehyde functional group as well as from ring-opening of furan, resulting in a maximum of two CO molecules per decomposed furfuryl alcohol molecule; the actual amount would be lower due to desorption of furan. Further, the studies of molecularly dosed furan on Pt(111) studies showed that furan on Pt(111) does not undergo decomposition (Fig. S1), suggesting that decomposition products of furfuryl alcohol are not formed through a surface furan, but rather a furan-like intermediate such as C4H3O or C4H2O. This furan-like intermediate further decomposed into propylene (m/z = 42) through a ring-opening reaction at 370 K. However, previous studies on Pt(111) found that ring-opening products are produced from furan under hydrogenating conditions [18]. Therefore, it is likely that decomposition occurs for furfuryl alcohol on Pt(111) due to the production of surface H from O—H bond scission. Benzene (m/z = 78), hypothetically produced from coupling of C3 fragments from decarbonylation of furan, desorbed at a significantly higher temperature than propylene in a sharp peak at 430 K. Furfuryl alcohol also underwent deoxygenation to produce methylfuran (m/z = 82), which peaks at 375 K. (Note that the small peak at 255 K was indicative of the multilayer furfuryl alcohol fragmentation in the mass spectrometer.) Furfuryl alcohol deoxygenation also yielded H2O (m/z = 18) as a result of the C—O bond scission of the alcohol functional group. At saturation, furfuryl alcohol underwent decarbonylation more readily than hydrodeoxygenation, as the methylfuran yield was found to be lower by at least a factor of 10 compared to the CO yield. Fig. 2 shows the trends in yield of various products as a function of initial furfuryl alcohol exposure on Pt(111); product yield as a function of CO yield can be found in Fig. S2. At low exposures, almost no products were produced other than carbon monoxide and hydrogen, indicating that complete furfuryl alcohol decomposition via a decarbonylation route was dominant. Other products emerge at higher coverages, but for the most part do not show major changes in desorption temperature. Carbon monoxide desorbed in a single peak that shifts to lower temperatures at higher coverages, consistent with previous studies [7]. Hydrogen also showed exposure-dependent changes in TPD traces. At low exposures, hydrogen desorption produced two peaks at 340 K and 415 K, with the main peak at 415 K. Moreover, continued desorption of H2 occurred at higher temperatures. The 340 K peak was relatively large, which is consistent with the normal temperature for recombination of surface hydrogen prior to desorption. The 415 K peak is attributed to additional decomposition reactions that provide hydrogen for desorbing species, such as methylfuran, furan, benzene, and propylene. At higher exposures, the low-temperature peak decreased in intensity and shifted to 315 K, presumably because of repulsive interactions with other adsorbed species, while the high-temperature peak increased in intensity and shifted to a slightly higher temperature of 420 K, likely due to an increase in difficulty in C—H and O—H bond scission at high exposures [19–21]. The H2 peaks at higher temperatures indicated deposition of some amount of surface carbonaceous species; these were removed after each experiment by oxygen TPD. Among the higher-molecular weight products, benzene did appear to undergo a slight shift to higher temperature. While the symmetric peak shape for benzene desorption suggested a second-order process, the unexpected increase in desorption temperature at higher coverages may indicate complex kinetics on the most crowded surface. To better understand the role of surface hydrogen atoms in the decomposition of furfuryl alcohol on Pt(111), TPD experiments on a D-precovered surface were conducted. Fig. 3 shows a spectrum collected after predosing the surface with 3 Langmuir (1 Langmuir = 10−6 Torr s) of molecular deuterium (D2), followed by a saturating dose of furfuryl alcohol. No additional products were detected and there was no hydrogenation of double bonds despite the presence of adsorbed deuterium. Propylene has a parent fragment of m/z = 42, but similar traces were seen up to m/z = 45, indicating that propylene incorporated up to three D atoms. Similarly, methylfuran incorporated up to two D atoms and all methylfuran traces had similar shapes regardless of the extent of deuteration. Benzene appeared to incorporate at least two D atoms, but the higher-mass benzene peaks were difficult to resolve due to intense overlapping fragments from methylfuran. The furan peaks exhibited a trend in which furan containing up to two D atoms (m/z = 69–70) was observed in a peak at 314 K, while unlabeled furan desorbed in a high-temperature peak at 360 K. This trend was likely due to the decreasing population of D (as compared to H) on the surface as a function of temperature, since pre-adsorbed D atoms were consumed by desorption, while surface H atoms were produced by decomposition of furfuryl alcohol. Note that the incorporation of up to two D atoms in furan was somewhat surprising, since furan production from furfuryl alcohol decarbonylation would only appear to require a single C—H bond formation. We discuss this point in further detail below. Molecular deuterium (D2) desorbed at relatively low temperatures as a result of recombination, whereas HD was also produced as a high-temperature desorption product. The observation of HD at higher temperatures indicates that furfuryl alcohol-derived intermediates incorporated surface D via hydrogenation reactions during the temperature ramp, but that a portion of those intermediates underwent dehydrogenation at a higher temperature. The HOD isotope was produced during the deoxygenation of furfuryl alcohol, hypothetically from reaction of a surface D atom with the hydroxyl group of furfuryl alcohol. HOD would be expected to be the main water product, with H2O being difficult to resolve due to background pressure. However, a small amount of D2O was also observed, likely from some H/D exchange between adsorbed water or furfuryl alcohol and surface D atoms [22]."
4,High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy,"3.2 High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy HREEL spectra were collected to probe the surface structure and chemistry for furfuryl alcohol as a function of coverage and temperature. Fig. 4 a shows the increasing exposure of furfuryl alcohol on the Pt(111) surface at 123 K. At the lowest coverage, the dominant losses were observed near 732, 1020, 1430, and 2970 cm−1. The 1020 cm−1 loss is associated with furyl CH bending, while the remainder are attributed to CH2 modes. The lack of an in-plane C—H stretching mode at around 3150 cm−1 for the smallest exposure, Fig. 4b, indicates that the dynamic dipole caused by the C—H stretching on the furan ring is parallel to the surface, and therefore that the furan ring adopted a flat-lying configuration on the surface at low coverage. The dominant feature for both coverages in Fig. 4b is the CH2 stretching peak at 2970 cm−1; however, the 2.5 L exposure exhibits a small peak at 3140 cm−1 that is not apparent in the 0.2 L spectra. At larger exposures, additional modes associated with various furyl ring C—H and C—C deformations begin to appear at 620, 920, 1110, 1232, and 3145 cm−1. The development of furyl ring C—H and C—C modes at higher exposures suggests that more crowded surfaces were partly covered by adsorbates in which the furyl ring was not oriented parallel to the surface. Further, the CH2 modes shifted slightly to a higher frequency, likely indicating some change in the coordination environment of the alcohol as exposure was increased. Similar behavior has been seen for benzyl alcohol adsorbed on Pd(111) [5]. The spectra shown in Fig. 5 are for Pt(111) dosed with 2.5 Langmuir (L) of furfuryl alcohol at 133 K and subsequently heated to progressively higher temperatures, spectra collected at additional temperatures are included in Fig. S3. The low-temperature spectrum was consistent with IR spectra of furfuryl alcohol (Table 1 ) [5]. The temperature series of furfuryl alcohol indicated that at 133 K the adsorbate was intact and in a multilayer state with methylene modes at 760 cm−1 and 2960 cm−1 and a broad O—H stretch apparent near 3510 cm−1, all of which are indicative of the alcohol group. Further, C—H out-of-plane bending, ρ(CH2) at 760 cm−1 and furan ring stretching, ν(ring) at 1314 cm−1 indicate the intact molecule. Heating the surface to 177 K allowed for changes in the multilayer, likely through desorption and sequential reorganization of the furfuryl alcohol in the adsorbed layer. Low-frequency peaks associated with Pt—C stretches were resolved, and the elastic peak became sharper and more intense compared to the loss peaks, consistent with a decrease in the coverage of adsorbates. The lack of an O—H bond vibration around 3510 cm−1 suggests possible O—H bond scission to produce an alkoxide intermediate. Further heating to 203 K appeared to result in the onset of additional reactions. A decrease in peak intensity at 760 cm−1 indicated the possible onset of methylene dehydrogenation at this temperature. As a result, furfural intermediates began to occupy the surface, which may correlate to the increase in intensity for the 1425 cm−1 peak associated to the appearance of a strongly bound aldehyde. This has been seen in previous studies on Pd(111) where a feature around 1390 cm−1 was associated with the C—O stretch of aldehydes adsorbed in an η2(C,O) configuration [5]. At 251 K, there was an increase in peak intensity for Pt—C modes at 414 cm−1 and 582 cm−1. It appears that by this temperature, furfuryl alcohol dehydrogenation was largely complete, which is apparent from the disappearance in the methylene mode at 760 cm−1. As a result of this, a large amount of furfural intermediates were produced which is seen in weakly bound aldehyde stretches at 1690 cm−1, whereas this mode is seen at 1672 cm−1 in gas-phase furfural [5]. In studies of aldehydes produced from 1-epoxy-3-butene on Pt(111), it was determined that the peak position of around 1690 cm−1 is indicative of weak interaction of the aldehyde with the surface [5,20]. There is also evidence for the onset of decarbonylation to produce furan-like intermediates and CO, which is apparent from the development of bridging and atop CO peaks at 1831 and 2082 cm−1, respectively. The appearance of a strong peak at 814 cm−1 may be indicative of furyl ring decomposition, as discussed further below. At 300 K, decarbonylation was nearly complete as indicated by the decrease in peaks associated with furfural, as seen in the disappearance of the aldehyde stretch at 1690 cm−1. However, CO and other decomposition products remained adsorbed. By 340 K, all furyl species appear to have decomposed. This is represented in the lack of furyl ring features at 925, 1232, 1314, and 3145 cm−1. At this temperature, peaks at 814, 1120, 1425, and 3005 cm−1 are still visible. These modes correspond to benzene-like C—C and C—H modes on Pt(111) [23]."
5,Discussion,"Based on these experimental insights, Fig. 6 is proposed to reflect the decomposition pathways for furfuryl alcohol. Starting from adsorbed furfuryl alcohol, the first dehydrogenation step results in production of the proposed alkoxide (structure I in Fig. 6). This occurs by 177 K because the O—H bond feature, which is seen in a broad feature around 3510 cm−1 in the low-temperature HREEL spectra in Fig. 5, was absent, indicating the O—H bond had broken. At the same temperature, symmetric methylene CH2 stretching (2960 cm−1) and ring CH stretching (3140 cm−1) remained intense, which indicated that the methylene was intact, suggesting initial alkoxide formation in the first dehydrogenation step. At higher temperatures, the alkoxide further dehydrogenated through methylene C—H bond scission to produce a surface aldehyde (II). This is apparent in the 251 K HREEL spectra, where methylene modes began to disappear while CO stretches indicative of a surface aldehyde emerged around 1690 cm−1. The surface aldehyde (II) underwent decarbonylation to produce an adsorbed furyl-type intermediate and carbon monoxide (III). It is unclear if furan was produced through an acyl intermediate as proposed on Pd(111) [7], because a clear signature for the aldehydic C—H stretch at 2790 cm−1 could not be isolated, therefore the formation of an acyl intermediate could not be determined by the disappearance of this mode. Acyl intermediates were also not detected in the decomposition of furfural on Pt(111) [9], although another study found that furan was produced from furfural [10]. The furyl-type intermediate (III) is assigned as C4H2O based on the incorporation of up to two D atoms in desorbing furan from the TPD studies on d-precovered Pt(111). (Furan theoretically would need to form only one C—H bond to be produced after decarbonylation of a furfural intermediate.) The HREELS results indicated that decarbonylation to produce surface-bound C4H2O species began by a measured temperature of 251 K and was largely complete by 300 K, as apparent from the disappearance of the CO stretch at 1690 cm−1 in combination with the growth of peaks for adsorbed CO. Similar trends were seen in the studies of furfural on Pt(111) [9]. The C4H2O species (III) underwent hydrogenation to produce gas-phase furan (VI) or further decomposed to a proposed C3Hx intermediate (IV). Decomposition of C4H2O began by 251 K, which is apparent from the presence of a ring C—H wagging mode at 814 cm−1 [24]. This indicates that furan desorption and C4H2O (III) decomposition are competing processes. This is also seen in TPD, where furan and propylene (a decomposition product produced from ring-opening and decarbonylation) desorb at similar temperatures. Propylene is proposed to be produced from a C3Hx intermediate (IV) which can be hydrogenated to produce propylene (VII), but can also couple with another C3Hx intermediate (IV) to produce a C6Hy intermediate (V), which is the precursor to benzene (VIII). Although it is unclear whether C3Hx intermediates (IV) exist as stable species on the surface, C6Hy (V) is proposed as a stable intermediate based both on the benzene-type species seen in the HREEL spectra and the high desorption temperature of benzene in TPD. The C6Hy surface species formed by 340 K in the HREEL spectra, where a loss at 795 cm−1 is assigned to a C—H out-of-plane ring stretch, 1110 cm−1 indicates a benzene-type ring deformation, 1430 cm−1 is a C—H in-plane bend, and 3005 cm−1 is a C—H in-plane stretch [5,23]. As discussed in the methods section, HREELS temperature readings were systematically lower than expected due to different thermocouple placements between HREELS and TPD. It is important to note that temperatures referenced in this discussion are from the HREEL studies. At higher coverages, a fraction of the furfuryl alcohol is proposed to undergo dehydrogenation through O—H bond scission to produce an upright alkoxide (IX). This is apparent in the presence of the high-frequency peak at 3140 cm−1 at higher coverages, which is representative of furyl ring C—H in-plane stretches. Due to HREELS selection rules for dipole scattering, the presence of an in-plane C—H stretching mode at larger exposures suggests that the dynamic dipole caused by C—H stretching of the ring in this case was perpendicular to the surface, thus some fractions of the adsorbates were expected to be upright. Similar behavior has been seen for benzyl alcohol adsorbed on the Pd(111) surface and for furfural on the Pt(111) surface [10,25].The subsequent steps to produce methylfuran are unclear, however we propose that the high-coverage structure underwent further dehydrogenation through the methylene group to produce an upright hydroxyfurfuryl or aldehyde intermediate, and this intermediate undergoes deoxygenation, breaking the C—O bond, with subsequent surface H hydrogenation to produce methylfuran and water (X). The scission of a methylene C—H bond to form a hydroxyfurfuryl-type intermediate is not necessary to produce methylfuran, however our isotope tracing studies indicate that two C—H bonds were formed prior to desorption of methylfuran, apparent in the traces for methylfuran-d2 in Fig. 3. Since it is expected that at least one C—H bond must be formed as a result of the deoxygenation, this suggests that potentially a methylene C—H bond is broken in the process as well. Since methylfuran is not produced until much higher temperatures, a methylene dehydrogenation may precede the C—O bond scission, as indicated in Fig. 6. As mentioned above, furfuryl alcohol on Pd(111) was found to undergo an alternative mechanism in which significant intermolecular interactions allowed for direct hydrogen abstraction from one adsorbate to another to produce methylfuran [5,7,26]. This allowed for more facile HDO to occur at higher coverages due to increased interaction between adsorbates [5]. However, we have shown that furfuryl alcohol deoxygenated solely through the incorporation of surface H on Pt(111). The deuterium studies show that undeuterated (m/z = 82) and deuterated (m/z = 83–84) methylfuran traces exhibited similar shapes, indicating that a single surface H-mediated HDO occurred. Also, as described above, adsorbed furfuryl alcohol may undergo O—H bond scission prior to methylene dehydrogenation. It is possible that the methylfuran intermediates undergo this alcohol dehydrogenation, resulting in the need for two O—H bonds to be formed in order for methylfuran to be produced. This could explain the production of D2O in the deuterium studies. Lastly, since methylfuran was produced entirely through a surface H-mediated HDO, larger coverages of the reactant may have inhibited combination with surface H, resulting in the shift in temperature for methylfuran desorption on Pt(111) as exposure increased. The results reported here indicate the effect that the alcohol group has on the furyl ring in comparison to that of an aldehyde group. Shi and Vohs [9] examined furfural on Pt(111) and found that the aldehyde undergoes nearly complete decomposition to produce propylene, CO, and H2 as gas phase products, while Taylor et al. [10] found that furfural decomposes to furan, CO, H2, and surface carbonaceous species. As indicated in Fig. 6, we thus attribute propylene and furan products in the current work with furfuryl alcohol to decomposition through a furfural intermediate. Furthermore, Taylor et al. [10] observed that precoverage of Pt(111) with hydrogen prior to furfural adsorption leads to formation of both furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran, also consistent with the reaction network in Fig. 6. Interestingly, however, entering the reaction network from adsorbed furfuryl alcohol apparently results in some significant changes in the surface reaction kinetics within the mechanism. For example, Taylor et al. [10] found that furan desorbed at significantly lower temperatures when produced from furfural, significantly below the temperature found for methylfuran formation (which was consistent between their study and the present results). They also did not observe production of hydrogen in its desorption-limited peak from furfural decomposition, consistent with a more efficient reaction between surface furyl species and H atoms as compared to hydrogen recombination, which was the inverse we observed using furfuryl alcohol as the reactant. Finally, the observation of benzene as a product from furfuryl alcohol, but not from furfural, suggests that the overall hydrogen richness of the surface intermediate pool at any given temperature likely plays a key role in facilitating the desorption of strongly bound species."
6,Conclusions,"Furfuryl alcohol adsorption and decomposition were studied on the Pt(111) surface using TPD and HREELS. In one pathway, furfuryl alcohol was found to undergo dehydrogenation to furfural, followed by decarbonylation to yield furan and CO as gas-phase products. Furan production was proposed to proceed through a dehydrogenation C4H2O intermediate. This furyl-like intermediate was also found to undergo ring-opening and decarbonylation to yield the gas phase product propylene, as well as small amounts of benzene at high temperatures. As an additional pathway accessible at higher coverages, furfuryl alcohol underwent deoxygenation to produce methylfuran. In contrast to observations for Pd(111), it was determined that deoxygenation occurred through a single mechanism involving the incorporation of surface hydrogen from Pt(111), rather than inter-adsorbate H transfer. Overall, comparison of these findings with prior work indicates that although similar reaction products are observed from furfuryl alcohol on Pd(111) and Pt(111), the detailed mechanisms are somewhat different, perhaps accounting for differing selectivities and rates observed in prior work on supported Pd and Pt catalysts."
