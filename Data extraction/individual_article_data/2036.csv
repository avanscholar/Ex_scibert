0,Introduction,"Butanol octanol wastewater (BOW) is generated in the conversion of coal synthetic gas by DAVY/DOW low pressure carbonyl synthesis process (as shown in Fig. 1 ). The BOW mainly presents two characteristics: (1) the concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) ranges from 10,000 to 50,000 mg/L, which is a typical high concentration organic wastewater; (2) the wastewater contains high concentration of 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol, 3-methyl-1, 2-butanediol, and other toxic substances, which have toxic effect on microorganisms. At present, the treatment methods of BOW mainly include acidification extraction, Fenton oxidation, and disc tube reverse osmosis membrane separation technology. However, a common drawback of these treatments is high cost. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of such wastewater treatment, it is urgent to explore an economic and efficient treatment method. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for BOW treatment, which can remove toxic organic matter and achieve methane recovery. However, anaerobic bioprocess was usually limited with low removal rate and poor stability under toxic condition (Zhuang et al., 2018). For example, COD removal efficiency and methane production rate were only around 30% and 100 mL/d, respectively in anaerobic degradation of actual coal gasification wastewater, which contained high concentrations of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrogen heterocyclic compounds (Jia et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, high concentration of toxic substances in BOW might inhibit the metabolic activity of anaerobic microorganisms, thus reducing the anaerobic treatment efficiency of wastewater. In recent years, various methods were used to solve the problem of low efficiency of coal chemical industry wastewater treatment, such as adding conductive materials, hydrogen enrichment, and so on (He et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021). The lag times for methane formation were shorten by 10–75%, methane production rates were increased by 79–300%, and methane production yields were increased by 100–178% in the reactors that supplemented with conductive materials (e. g. granular activated carbon, biochar, and magnetite) (Park et al., 2018). The main reason might be that the addition of conductive materials could change the sludge morphology, reduce oxidation–reduction potential of sludge, and altered the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)-suited microbial community thus enhancing the efficiency of AD (Liu et al., 2021). After adding the conductive materials, Geobacter and Methanosaeta could form a close partnership through the DIET (Zhu et al., 2018). However, due to the poor tolerance of acetoclastic methanogens to toxic condition, the growth of acetoclastic methanogens was easily inhibited (Yan et al., 2020). The DIET based on conductive materials between Geobacter and Methanosaeta under toxic condition might be weakened. Therefore, it was important to find a method to form the efficient DIET between Geobacter and methanogens under toxic condition. Conversely, hydrogenotrophic methanogens showed better tolerance to toxic condition (Wu et al., 2019). Previously, exogenous hydrogen (EH2) can be used for biogas upgrading in which EH2 and CO2 were converted to CH4 through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Xu et al., 2021). When the partial pressure of hydrogen (HPPs) was too high (>500 Pa), EH2 could promote homoacetogenesis (Liu et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2021). EH2 might be conducive to the enrichment of Methanosaeta under toxic condition, thus promoting the formation of DIET between Geobacter and Methanosaeta. Consequently, the coupling of EH2 and granular activated carbon (GAC) might play a synergistic enhancing role in the treatment of toxic pollutants, which provided a new idea for the treatment of such wastewater. The purpose of this study is to: (1) analyze the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of BOW; (2) explore the feasibility of coupling EH2 and GAC to enhance anaerobic treatment of BOW; (3) investigate the effect of HPPs on anaerobic treatment of BOW; (4) analyze the change of microbial community structure in the EH2/GAC system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and culture conditions,"2.1 Inoculum and culture conditions The inoculated sludge was taken from Zhu Zhuanjing Sewage Treatment Plant (Hefei City, Anhui Province). The sludge was directly anaerobic treated for a week and then used as seed sludge. The mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) of seed sludge was 34.30 ± 0.30 g/L, and the ratio of mixed liquid volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) to MLSS in the sludge was 0.37. The BOW was taken from Shuguang Chemical Co., Ltd (Anqing, Anhui Province). The wastewater characteristics of BOW were as follows (in mg/L): total COD of 11760 ± 57, dissolved COD of 7600 ± 113, ammonia nitrogen of 4.60 ± 0.10, nitrate nitrogen of 29.75 ± 2.80, total phosphorus of 2.20 ± 0.28, mixed liquid suspended solids of 775 ± 10, pH of 5.60 ± 0.02. The main organic compounds in the wastewater were identified to be 2, 4-dimethyl-3-pentanol and 3-methyl-1, 2-butanediol by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS)."
3,Biochemical methane potential test,"2.2 Biochemical methane potential test The test was carried out in triplicate in working volume of 150 mL serum bottles. BOW and seed sludge were added to the serum bottles at a ratio of COD (g) to seed sludge (g MLVSS) = 1:1.25. Before incubation, all serum bottles were flushed with nitrogen for 30 s to avoid the presence of oxygen and then sealed. Finally, all bottles were incubated in an air bath shaker at 37 ± 1 °C and 140 rad/min in dark. The biogas composition was measured every two days by gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890, Shandong Ruihong-Ltd., China) until methane production terminated."
4,Batch tests,"2.3 Batch tests Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of GAC, EH2, and HPPs on the methane production of BOW. The initial COD concentration in serum bottles was set at 5000 mg/L. BOW and seed sludge (raw water g COD: seed sludge g MLVSS = 1:1.25) was added into the serum bottles, and the working volume was 150 mL. After that, high purity nitrogen (99.99%) was used to flush for about 30 s to exhaust the oxygen in the headspace. The addition of GAC was 5 g/L (AR = 18 mesh, Sinoptic Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). EH2 consisted of a mixture of H2: CO2 = 4:1 in volume (Nanjing Shangyuan Co., Ltd.). The same volume as the injected hydrogen should be extracted from the serum bottles before hydrogen injection to ensure the same headspace pressure. The initial volumes of pure H2 and pure CO2 were added into the serum bottles at the ratio of 4:1. The gas composition in serum bottles was rapidly checked by gas chromatography and then the content of H2 or CO2 was supplemented according to the set HPPs. In all tests, neither EH2 nor GAC was added as a control group and only GAC was added in GAC group. Both EH2 and GAC were added in EH2/GAC groups (the HPPs is 0.5 atm). The corresponding HPPs tests (0.2, 0.3, 0.5 atm) were obtained by injecting the mixed gas into bottles with a syringe. Only EH2 was added in EH2 group (the HPPs is 0.5 atm). Triplicate samples were set in this experiment. Serum bottles of each group were incubated in an air bath shaker at 37 ± 1 °C and 140 rad/min in dark. The macronutrients and micronutrients in the medium were consistent with previous experiments (He et al., 2021)."
5,The analysis of EH2/GAC on electrical conductivity,"2.4 The analysis of EH2/GAC on electrical conductivity Electrochemical workstation was used to measure the electrical conductivity of sludge. After the batch experiment, 20 mL of sludge was removed from the serum bottles and used as a sample. The sample treatment method was consistent with previous experiments (Zhao et al., 2016). The electrical conductivity of sludge was calculated according to the formula 1 and 2. Formula 1: σ = 1 ρ Formula 2: ρ = RS L σ , for the sludge conductivity, S/m. R, for the inverse of the slope of the current–voltage curve. S, for the cross-sectional area between two titanium plates (2.5 × 10−5 m2). L, for the gap between distance two titanium plates (0.5 × 10−3 m)."
6,Impacts of EH2/GAC on the change of microbial community structure,"2.5 Impacts of EH2/GAC on the change of microbial community structure The bacterial and archaeal communities in groups were investigated by 16SrRNA at the end of the batch experiment. All sludge samples were centrifuged at 8000 r/min for 10 min before the supernatant was removed. GAC was extracted as the sample from EH2/GAC and GAC groups. After washing with 0.9% NaCl for 3 times, the supernatant was put into the ultrasonic instrument for 30 min. Finally, the residual material on the filter membrane was retained as the samples after filtration. The three parallel samples were mixed evenly and sent to MajorBio Bio-Parm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for testing as DNA samples. The determination methods of DNA extraction, DNA purity and concentration refered to the references (He et al., 2021). The bacterial primers used for high throughput sequencing of 16SrRNA gene were 338F (ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). The archaeal primers were 524F10extF (TGYCAGCCGCCGCGGTAA) and Arch958RmodR (YCCGGCGTTGAVTCCAATT)."
7,Other analytical methods,"2.6 Other analytical methods The biogas composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890, Shandong Ruihong-Ltd., China). The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was determined by gas chromatography (GC, 7890A, Agilent Technologies, USA). COD was measured by the standard method (APHA, 2005). The degradation products of the wastewater were determined by GC–MS (ClarusSQ8TPerkinElmer, shanghai China). The pretreatment of wastewater was as follows: Firstly, water samples of 500 mL were filtered and passed through the activated SPE column (ENVI-18 column). Secondly, after cleaning by 5 mL methanol solution (methanol: water V: V = 4:6), SPE column was dried for 1 h. Finally, the SPE column was eluted with 8 mL solution (ethyl acetate: acetone = 1:1), and dried with gentle nitrogen for derivatization. The chromatographic column is Agilent HP-5 ms (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Shanghai Ample Company) and inlet and initial column temperature was 280℃ and 75℃, respectively. The temperature was raised to 300℃ at 15℃/min and maintained for 5 min. The carrier gas was high purity (99.99%) helium, and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 μL, and the split ratio was 20:1."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Biochemical methane potential of butanol octanol wastewater,"3.1 Biochemical methane potential of butanol octanol wastewater In order to explore the anaerobic biodegradability of BOW, a biochemical methane potential (BMP) experiment was carried out in this study. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the actual methane production of each group began to differ significantly from day 9. The cumulative methane production of (B1) group reached 94.20 ± 3.60 mL CH4/g COD, while the cumulative methane production of (B3) and (B5) groups was only 15.75% and 12.95% of that. The gap between (B1) and (B5) groups had become more obvious over time. On the 31st day, the cumulative methane production of (B1) group reached 275.59 ± 1.32 mL CH4/g COD, which was 2.61 and 3.25 times of that of (B3) and (B5) groups, respectively. The actual methane production of each group reached 78.10%, 29.84%, and 24.38% of the theoretical methane production, respectively. The results indicated that with the increase of COD concentration, the BMP of BOW was gradually decreased. This decrease was most obvious in the (B5) group. As shown in Fig. 2(b), when the COD concentration of wastewater was 1 g/L, 3 g/L, and 5 g/L, the relative methane production rate constant K1, K2, and K3 was 0.022d-1, 0.006d-1, and 0.005d-1, respectively. The results showed that the methane production rate decreased with the increase of COD concentration. According to the results, it was concluded that the BOW had a good BMP. However, with the increase of COD concentration, the BMP of BOW would be inhibited by toxic pollutants. Similarly, olive mill effluent contained a lot of refractory organic matter (e. g. polyphenols, tannins), and the BMP of wastewater (5 g COD/L) was 160 mL CH4/g COD (Azbar et al., 2008), which was 1.88 times that of the (B5) group in this experiment. It was found by GC–MS that BOW contained 2, 4-dimethyl-3-pentanol and 3-methyl-1, 2-butanediol, which were difficult to be degraded."
10,Effect of EH2/GAC on anaerobic methane production of butanol octanol wastewater,"3.2 Effect of EH2/GAC on anaerobic methane production of butanol octanol wastewater After 32 days of anaerobic inoculation, there was significant differences among the groups in the cumulative methane production, and removal efficiency of COD and VFAs. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the cumulative methane production in EH2/GAC group was 289.55 ± 17.43 mL CH4/g COD (methane production was deducted from the contribution of EH2), which was 1.07, 1.98, and 2.04 times of GAC, control, and EH2 groups, respectively. The results as showed in Table 1 were simulated by Gompertz equation as previously described by Lee et al. (2020). Compared with the control group, the maximum methane production rates in EH2/GAC and GAC groups were increased by 257% and 259%, and the cumulative methane production was increased by 98% and 85%, respectively. It was obvious that GAC played a major role in promoting the anaerobic methane production of wastewater. The reasons for improving anaerobic methane production might be that DIET between bacteria and archaea was established (Cavalcante et al., 2021; Kang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021). The results (Table 1) exhibited that the supplement of EH2/GAC significantly reduced the lag times from 11.67 days to 3.34 days, which might be due to the accelerated degradation of complex biodegradable compounds (Johnravindar et al., 2020). In order to exclude the influence of pure H2 and pure CO2 in the EH2 group, 0.5 atm pure H2 and 0.5 atm pure CO2 groups were also set in this study. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the cumulative methane production of the pure H2 and pure CO2 group were basically zero, indicating that the addition of pure H2 or pure CO2 would seriously inhibit anaerobic methane production of wastewater. Both the maximum methane production rate and cumulative methane production of EH2 group were similar to those of control group, indicating that the addition of mixed H2 had no inhibition on the treatment of BOW. As calculated, when the contribution of EH2 on methane production was deducted, the cumulative methane production of EH2/GAC group was still higher than that of GAC group. The results indicated that EH2 also played a promoting role in methane production of BOW. In order to investigate the effect of different HPPs on methane production of BOW, 0.2 and 0.3 atmEH2/GAC groups were also set in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the methane production of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 atmEH2/GAC groups were 266.00 ± 1.19, 278.28 ± 1.67, and 289.55 ± 17.43 mL CH4/g COD, respectively. It demonstrated that the high HPPs could improve the anaerobic methane production of BOW. The main reason was that high HPPs (>500 Pa) would promote the homoacetogenesis which could convert the H2 and CO2 to acetate (Liu et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2021). It might be conducive to the growth of Methanosaeta, which could form DIET with Geobacter. The coupling of EH2/GAC might enhance a DIET between archaea and bacteria and this was the possible reason that the treatment efficiency of EH2/GAC group was the best. The initial COD concentration of each group was 5000 mg/L. As shown in Fig. 3(c), it was found that the residual COD concentration of EH2/GAC group was 640.00 ± 75.40 mg/L, and the COD removal efficiency was 87.20% at the end of the experiment. It was similar to that in GAC group (88.27%), and was 3.76 and 4.61 times of control and EH2 groups, respectively. These results indicated that adding EH2 in EH2/GAC group did not inhibit the degradation of organic pollutants in the BOW. It was reported that the addition of conductive materials in the experimental group could reduce the accumulation of VFAs and thus improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion process in the treatment of complex organic matter (Martins et al., 2018). Acetate and valerate were the main VFAs in the anaerobic degradation of BOW. In the acetogenesis, propionate, butyrate, and valerate could all be converted to acetate. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the descending order of degradation effect of VFAs in each group was as follows: EH2/GAC group, GAC group, control group, EH2 group. The final concentrations of propionate, butyrate, and valerate in the first two groups were 24.53, 59.60, and 124.30 mg/L, respectively, which were decreased by 84%, 82%, and 79%, respectively compared with the control group. This might be because the addition of EH2/GAC accelerated the conversion of propionate, butyrate, and valerate to acetate. Although the residual concentration of acetate in EH2 group was slightly lower than that in EH2/GAC and control groups, the concentration of propionate, butyrate, and valerate in EH2 group was still very high. This might be because the addition of EH2 alone inhibited the conversion of propionate, butyrate, and valerate to acetate (Wahid et al., 2019). The residual concentration of acetate in GAC group was 1.71 times that of EH2/GAC group, indicating that adding EH2 could greatly improve the rate of acetoclastic methanogenesis. The possible reasons were as follows: (1) the addition of EH2 could improve the activity of homoacetogenic bacteria, enrich a large number of acetoclastic methanogens, and promote the degradation of acetate (Liu et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2021); (2) after the addition of EH2/GAC, the electrons might be directly transmitted by Geobacter to Methanosaeta because of the formation of DIET (Li et al., 2015). Therefore, the conversion of acetate was accelerated, and the inhibition of VFAs on anaerobic digestion was alleviated."
11,Effect of EH2/GAC on the electrical conductivity of sludge,"3.3 Effect of EH2/GAC on the electrical conductivity of sludge As shown in Fig. 4 , the electrical conductivity of sludge in EH2/GAC group reached 308.75 ± 54.40 μS/cm. It was 1.52, 2.32, and 2.41 times of that of GAC, EH2, and control groups, respectively. The conductivity of bio-aggregate in anaerobic digestion was reported to often result from the abundance of Geobacter, which was DIET-mediated microbials and could facilitate DIET by conductive pili or c-type cytochromes OmcS (Barua et al., 2018). This implied that conductivity enhancement might serve as a sign for DIET establishment (Wang & Lee, 2021). The increase of HPPs would change the metabolic activities and microbial community structure, and this change would also vary the electrical conductivity (Martins et al., 2018; Montiel Corona et al., 2020). Compared with the control group, the sludge conductivity of GAC, EH2/GAC, and EH2 groups was increased by 59.08%, 141.46%, and 3.91%, respectively. It was obvious that the coupling of EH2 and GAC could improve the conductivity of sludge much more than the sum of the effects of adding GAC and EH2 respectively. It showed that the coupling of EH2 and GAC played a synergistic role in improving the electrical conductivity of sludge."
12,Effect of EH2/GAC on change of microbial community structure,"3.4 Effect of EH2/GAC on change of microbial community structure 3.4.1 Bacteria It was stimulated that DIET via conductive materials for short chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate) or low molecular weight alcohols (ethanol, butanol) other than complex organics (Park et al., 2018). Therefore, accelerating the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process of BOW would promote the DIET between bacteria and archaea. As shown in Fig. 5 , the relative abundance of fermenting bacteria (Pseudomonas, Syntrophomonas, and Longilinea) in each group was significantly different. Pseudomonas could participate in the hydrolysis and acid production stages of anaerobic digestion (Zhu et al., 2018). In the bulk sludge, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas in EH2 group (11.13%) was 2.95, 1.03, and 1.15 times that of control, GAC, and EH2/GAC groups, respectively. These results indicated that both addition of EH2 and GAC could promote the enrichment of Pseudomonas, and the enrichment effect of EH2 was stronger than that of GAC. Longilinea, belonging to Class Anaerolineae, could convert carbohydrates and amino acid to acetate and H2 (Song et al., 2017). Longilinea were significantly enriched in the bulk sludge of EH2/GAC group, and the relative abundance reached 7.57%, which was 7.72, 3.59, and 24.42 times of that in the control, GAC, and EH2 groups, respectively. The enrichment of Pseudomonas and Longilinea was of great significance to accelerate the hydrolysis of BOW. In the bulk sludge, the contents of Syntrophomonas which could degrade fatty acids were 1.36% and 1.68%, respectively in control and EH2 groups. However, after the addition of GAC, Syntrophomonas in GAC and EH2/GAC groups were significantly enriched, and the relative abundance of Syntrophomonas in the above two groups were 6.87% and 5.16%, respectively. It was reported that Syntrophomonas could degrade VFAs, and this effect only occurred in the symbiosis with H2-using bacteria (Sousa et al., 2007). As shown in Fig. 5(b), Syntrophomonas in the EH2/GAC group was mainly grown on the surface of GAC (14.51%) rather than the bulk sludge (5.16%). This might be because the hydrotrophic Methanobacterium was mainly concentrated on the surface of GAC. And the cooperation between the Methanobacterium and Syntrophomonas improved the degradation of fatty acids. This prediction was consistent with the optimal VFAs degradation effect of the EH2/GAC group in section 3.2. The enrichment of fermenting bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Longilinea, and Syntrophomonas) indicated that the coupling of EH2 and GAC could promote the hydrolysis and acidogenesis process of anaerobic digestion and accelerate the conversion of macromolecular organic matter to small molecular matter. It provided sufficient substrates for the electron-donating bacteria further promoted DIET. As reported that some bacteria belonging to Clostridium (e. g. Clostridium ultunense) is the SAO bacterium that had an ability to synthesize acetate from H2/CO2 through the homoacetogenesis (Hattori, 2008). Whether it produced or oxidized acetate depended on the HPPs (Schnurer et al., 1996). High HPPs was favorable to performance homoacetogenesis (Montiel Corona & Razo Flores, 2018). The relative abundance of Clostridium in control, GAC, EH2, and EH2/GAC groups were 17.02%, 13.10%, 14.81%, and 9.78%, respectively. The decrease in relative abundance of Clostridium in EH2/GAC group might be attributed to: (1) when the PH2 exceeded a critical value (≤10−6 atm), homoacetogenesis turned to autotrophic metabolism (Dinamarca et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016); (2) during the homoacetogenesis process, Clostridium formed competition with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, resulting in a gradual decrease in relative abundance. On the contrary, low HPPs was conducive to the oxidation of acetate through the SAO process (Montecchio et al., 2017). Therefore, Clostridium in the control and GAC groups mainly produced methane through the SAO-HM pathway. In addition, the microbial community structure on the GAC surface is considered as one of the factors affecting the increase in the methane production rate (Kang et al., 2021a). According to the results of Scanning electron microscope (SEM), a large number of microorganisms were found on the surface of GAC, which were closely attached to the surface of GAC. As shown in Fig. 5(b), Geobacter aggregated a large amount on the surface of GAC in EH2/GAC (25.36%) and GAC (28.60%) groups. This agreed with the results of previous studies related to DIET: when a conductive material was injected into the anaerobic digestion reactor, Geobacter became dominant on the surface of the conductive material (Kang et al., 2021b). However, no Geobacter was found in the bulk sludge, indicating that the enrichment of Geobacter was closely related to GAC (Chen et al., 2021; Martins et al., 2018). Similarly, it was also observed in the heatmaps that Geobacter only enriched on the surface of GAC in EH2/ GAC and GAC groups. Relevant studies indicated that Geobacter could directly transfer electrons to acetoclastic methanogens through DIET (Du et al., 2020). Therefore, Geobacter was enriched on the surface of GAC, implying that DIET might be the main metabolic pathway of bacteria and archaea on the surface of GAC. 3.4.2 Archaea In all groups, archaea were mainly composed of four methanogens, e. g. Methanosaeta, Methanobacterium, Methanolinea, and Methanospirillum (as shown in Fig. 6 ). Methanosaeta could not only produce CH4 via the aceticlastic pathway but also DIET by bicarbonate reduction (Li et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 6, Methanosaeta were significantly enriched in the bulk sludge of the EH2/GAC group. The relative abundance reached 52.81% and was 3.66, 15, and 11.21 times of GAC, EH2, and control groups, respectively. It was consistent with the heatmaps results that the relative abundance of Methanosaeta was significantly increased in the bulk sludge of the EH2/ GAC group. In addition, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta on the surface of GAC in EH2/GAC and GAC groups also increased gradually. It was 1.70 and 2.67 times of the control group (4.71%), respectively. In Section 3.4.1, it was found that a large number of Geobacters appeared in EH2/GAC and GAC groups, which could exchange electrons with Methanosaeta through DIET (Ma et al., 2021). Therefore, the competitiveness of Methanosaeta in the bacterial community was improved. On the contrary, Methanosarcina, the acetoclastic methanogen, only appeared in the bulk sludge of control and EH2 groups. The relative abundance of Methanosarcina in the bulk sludge of EH2 group was 26.28%, which was 4.49 times that of the control group. The reasons for the enrichment of Methanosarcina in EH2 group were as follows: (1) when HPPs was too high (>500 Pa), EH2 was beneficial to the homoacetogenesis (Liu et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2021). As a result, the enrichment of Methanosarcina was promoted; (2) a large number of VFAs was accumulated in EH2/GAC group. Concentration of VFAs was recognized as a major selecting pressure that strongly influenced methanogenic community structures and even led to a metabolic pathway shift for Methanosarcina (Hao et al., 2011). Methanobacterium, Methanolinea, and Methanospirillum are all hydrotrophic archaea (Chen et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2016). They could attach to conductive materials and receive electrons, so they might play the role of electron transfer in DIET as conductive archaea (Lee et al., 2016; Valero et al., 2018). In the bulk sludge, the relative abundance of Methanobacterium in the control group was the highest (81.04%), which was 1.28, 2.26, and 1.29 times of that in the GAC, EH2/GAC, and EH2 groups, respectively. The reasons for this phenomenon were as follows: (1) the BOW was more toxic than the phenolic wastewater, and the hydrogenotrophic methanogens are more tolerant to toxicity than the acetoclastic methanogenesis (He et al., 2021). Therefore, hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be more advantageous in the treatment of BOW; (2) as could be seen from Section 3.4.1, SAO-HM was the main methane-producing pathway in the control group. SAO-HM was the main methane-producing pathway in the control group, so a large number of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was enriched. The decrease in the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the bulk sludge of EH2/GAC group might be caused by: (1) there was a certain amount of Clostridium, which could compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for H2/CO2. Under the condition of higher HPPs (>500 Pa), the homoacetogenesis are more dominant than hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This was because homoacetogenesis could metabolize a variety of substrates and switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism (Dinamarca et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2008); (2) the DIET was established between Geobacter and Methanosaeta, so that Methanosaeta was more competitive than Methanobacterium. In the EH2/GAC and GAC groups, the relative abundance of Methanobacterium on the surface of GAC was 84.67% and 83.61%, respectively, which was close to that of the control group (81.04%). Zhuang found that after the addition of magnetite, DIET might be formed among Geobacteraceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Methanobacteriaceae (Pan et al., 2021). Li also found that both Geobacteraceae and Methanobacteriaceae were significantly enriched after adding NanoFe3O4, suggesting that Methanobacteriaceae bacteria might be involved in the process of syntrophic DIET (Li et al., 2015). After the addition of EH2/GAC, a large number of Geobacter appeared on the surface of GAC. Methanobacterium and Geobacter were likely to participate in the syntrophic DIET process, improving their competitiveness on the surface of GAC. This could explain the enrichment of Methanobacterium on the surface of GAC in the EH2/GAC group. Methanolinea only appeared in EH2/GAC group. The abundance of Methanolinea in bulk sludge (4.56%) was much higher than that in the surface of GAC (0.97%). Similarly, Methanospirillum only appeared on the GAC surface of EH2/GAC group. In EH2/GAC group, Geobacter, Methanobacterium, and Methanosaeta all appeared in large numbers. It could be inferred that the coupling of EH2 and GAC might form a DIET between Geobacter, Methanobacterium, and Methanosaeta."
13,Conclusion,"The BMP of butanol octanol wastewater would decrease with the increase of wastewater concentration. Methane production efficiency, COD removal rate of BOW, the degradation of VFAs, and sludge conductivity were improved significantly by the coupling of EH2 and GAC. In the process of synergistic promotion of EH2 and GAC, GAC and EH2 promoted the enrichment of Geobacter and Methanosaeta, respectively, which was conducive to the formation of more DIET between Geobacter and Methanosaeta."
