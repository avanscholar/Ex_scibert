0,Introduction,"Selective, low temperature, catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation has been studied extensively because of its economic importance. It has been known for a long time that during aqueous-phase alcohol oxidation, low concentrations of H2O2 are also produced which increase as the medium becomes more basic [1]. Although H2O2 has been included either explicitly or implicitly in the description of mechanisms for alcohol oxidation [2,3], its formation is often treated as a side reaction and left largely unstudied. The low levels of H2O2 achieved, constrained by its decomposition and/or reaction with the organic reactants/products, have discouraged investigators from pursuing alcohol oxidation as a viable commercial production method for H2O2. As alcohols can be obtained directly from biomass and H2O2 produced by their oxidation does not require generation or handling of explosive hydrogen gas (often derived from petroleum) or large volumes of organic solvent, this approach has noteworthy advantages over the conventional Anthraquinone Process or direct synthesis from H2 and O2. However, the need for a highly basic reaction medium is a considerable disadvantage. In order to explore this reaction as a potential route for H2O2 production, it is important to overcome the limitations due to low achievable concentrations and requirement for a strongly basic medium. For that, determining mechanistic details for the formation of H2O2 during alcohol oxidation can help identify cost-effective and environmentally friendly process improvements. The focus of this investigation is to fill the knowledge gap for H2O2 production associated with alcohol oxidation. Specifically, we tackle these questions: (1) How many molecules of H2O2 can be produced during one catalytic cycle of alcohol oxidation, (2) is the active site for alcohol oxidation the same as for H2O2 production, (3) what limits the achievable concentration of H2O2, (4) what determines the rate of production of H2O2, and (5) what is the role of hydroxide ions? We used the oxidation of 1,2-propanediol to investigate the production of H2O2. 1,2-propanediol, hence referred to as diol, possesses a primary and a secondary hydroxyl group. It can be produced from biomass-derived glycerol and form valuable products such as lactic acid. The oxidation is catalyzed by Au/C at near ambient temperatures in a strongly basic medium [4,5]. Scheme 1, derived from information in the literature, captures the general features of the diol oxidation pathway [4,6]. In this molecule, the α-CH bond associated with the primary alcohol functional group is much more reactive than the one associated with the secondary carbon. Its oxidation produces lactate as the most abundant product [7], the formation of which involves first the formation of lactaldehyde that converts easily to hydroxyacetone in a basic solution. Minor products, including acetic, formic, and pyruvic acid, are also formed. This scheme, however, does not address the formation of H2O2."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Au/C catalyst was synthesized following the procedure of Ketchie et al. [1]. First, 15 mg HAuCl43H2O (99.8 wt% Au, Strem Chemicals) was added to 300 mL deionized (DI) water followed by addition of 7.5 mg polyvinyl alcohol (Aldrich). The gold colloid was formed by reducing the Au solution with dropwise addition of 0.1 M NaBH4, using a 4:1 molar ratio of NaBH4:Au. The resulting sol was ruby red in color. Separately, 1 g activated carbon (Norit SX, Ultra Cat) was suspended in 10 mL DDI water and the mixture sonicated for 1 h before addition to the Au sol. The Au sol–carbon slurry was stirred for 1 h, after which time the catalyst was filtered. The filtrate had a red tint, indicating that not all the Au sol had deposited onto the carbon support. The catalyst was then washed with 300 mL DI water twice to remove residual chloride and dried overnight at 130 °C. It was then reduced in a stream of about 100 mL min−1 pure H2 for 6 h at 300 °C, ramping to this temperature at 5 °C min−1. The resulting solid was stored in a refrigerator at 5 °C. Five such batches of catalysts were synthesized and the activities of these catalysts were within ±15%. They were combined and used for all the reactions conducted in this paper."
3,Reaction test,"2.2 Reaction test 2 M NaOH stock solution and 0.6 M 1,2-propanediol (diol) stock solution were prepared separately and these stock solutions were used within two days. For a standard test, NaOH solution (15 mL) was added to 15 mL diol in a 3-neck cylindrical reaction vessel to form a 0.3 M diol, 1 M NaOH solution. The solution was stirred at 300 rpm and purged with N2 for ∼3 min at 35 °C. At the very end of the N2 purge, a sample was withdrawn from the reactor and this was taken to be representative of the composition at time zero. Then 15 mg Au/C catalyst (0.74 wt% of Au determined by ICP) was added to the mixture and the reaction was initiated by bubbling in O2 at 20 mL min−1. The reaction time started when the first bubble emerged. Samples (1.1 mL) were collected at 1 minute intervals for the first 5 minutes to obtain the initial rates. 0.6 mL of the sample was mixed immediately with 3 mL 0.0938 M TiOSO4 solution (TiOSO4, Sigma Aldrich, ≥29% Ti basis, used as 1.5 wt% TiOSO4 in 0.5 M H2SO4) and analyzed for H2O2 by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using UV–vis spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 UV/VIS Spectrometer). The remainder of the sample was stored in ice to be analyzed later by HPLC (Agilent 1100 equipped with Diode Array Detector (DAD) and Refractive Index Detector (RID) and an Agilent Hi-Plex H, 300 × 7.7 mm column and a PL Hi-Plex H Guard Column 50 × 7.7 mm). The diol was determined using a RID detector and the organic products with a DAD detector (lactic acid and formic acid at 210 nm and acetic acid at 200 nm wavelengths). The mobile phase was 0.01 M o-phosphoric acid at 60 °C and 0.6 mL min−1. Experiments (Fig. S1 in Supporting information) conducted using different stirring speeds and gas flow rates demonstrated that the data were not affected by mass transfer limitation under the standard test conditions. Three NaOH concentrations were used, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 M, corresponding roughly to pHs 14, 13.7 and 13.4, respectively. The concentrations were independently verified with titrations using potassium hydrogen phthalate. Reaction rates were calculated from the acids formed (lactic, acetic, and formic) as no other products were detected. Based on carbon stoichiometry, the amount of formic and acetic acids formed should be equal. However, the amount of formic acid detected was far less than expected, possibly due to decomposition into CO2 or CO over the Au catalyst. Thus, the moles of diol consumed were calculated using only lactic and acetic acids, assuming that equal quantities of formic and acetic acid were produced: Moles of 1,2-propanediol reacted = moles of lactic acid + moles of acetic acid."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a ARM-200CF microscope using specimens prepared by drop-casting an ethanol suspension of catalyst onto a carbon film supported on a copper grid. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements were performed on a computer-controlled (QTEGRA software) Thermo iCap7600 ICP-OES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) operating in radial view and equipped with a CETAC 520 autosampler (Omaha, NE, USA). Each sample was acquired using 5 s visible exposure time and 15 s UV exposure time, running three replicates. The spectral lines selected for analysis were: Au (214.423, 242.795, 267.595 nm). The catalyst samples for analysis were first heated at 1000 °C in air for 3 h to remove carbon, and the Au in the residue was dissolved with aqua regia followed by dilution with DI water. Micromeritics 3Flex was used to measure surface areas. The samples were first degassed at 150 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi) was performed by mounting the samples with a double-sided adhesive tape. The binding energies were referenced to C (1 s) peak at 284.8 eV."
5,Results,
6,"H2O2 formation during oxidation of 1,2-propanediol","3.1 H2O2 formation during oxidation of 1,2-propanediol In a 1 M NaOH solution with bubbling oxygen at 35 °C, the diol reacted readily in the presence of a Au/C catalyst to form mostly lactic acid with simultaneous formation of H2O2 (Fig. 1 ). There is no detectable reaction if: (1) oxygen was replaced by N2, (2) no catalyst was used, or (3) the carbon support was used instead of Au/C. The diol conversion stopped if the suspended Au/C catalyst was removed from the mixture by filtration after 0.5 h, and no detectable amounts of Au were found in the filtrate (<2 ng mL−1 Au). Thus, both the diol oxidation and H2O2 formation reactions were catalyzed by Au/C. As mentioned earlier, these rates were not affected by mass transfer limitations. As shown in Fig. 1A, the conversion of diol increased with reaction time, but the rate decreased. The rate of accumulation of H2O2 was rapid initially (Fig. 1B), but its concentration reached a maximum after which the concentration decreased slowly. These time-dependent features of diol conversion and H2O2 concentration were similar for all three NaOH (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 M) and diol (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M) concentrations studied, although the reaction rates and product concentrations differed. As shown in these figures and Table S1 in Supplementary information, the reaction rates and concentrations of accumulated H2O2 were higher at higher NaOH or diol concentrations. The reaction rates also depended on the amount of catalyst used (Fig. S2). The rates of both reactions increased linearly with catalyst amount up to about 10 mg. Above that, the increase in reaction rate deviated slightly from linearity, which was attributed to clumping and/or adhesion of the catalyst powder to the reactor wall above the liquid that was more severe at higher catalyst concentrations."
7,H2O2 decomposition and reaction,"3.2 H2O2 decomposition and reaction The disappearance of H2O2 in N2 was determined in the absence and presence of the carbon support or Au/C (Fig. 2 ). In the absence of Au/C or carbon (curve a1), H2O2 decomposed slowly, suggesting that it was rather stable even in 1 M NaOH solution, despite the reported decrease in stability under alkaline conditions [8]. In reality, H2O2 decomposition should be slow even in an alkaline solution in the absence of adventitious trace metal impurities as its OO bond energy is 48 kcal/mole [9] and the hydroxyl ions have been shown not to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 [10]. Rate of degradation of H2O2 became fast with the addition of the carbon support (curve b1), and even faster with Au/C (curve c1). Since the diol was always present in our test reactions, its effect on the H2O2 degradation was also examined. Addition of diol suppressed the degradation of H2O2 in the presence of carbon (curve b2) or Au/C (curve c2), but had little effect when neither was present (curve a2). Under a N2 atmosphere and in the presence of diol and Au/C, H2O2 was degraded by disproportionation and reaction with diol, with the latter producing detectable quantities of acids. The accumulation of acids stopped at around 30 min when most of the H2O2 was consumed (Fig. S3). The rate of H2O2 degradation in N2 in the presence of Au/C and diol depended on the NaOH and diol concentrations. Fig. 3 shows that the degradation rate was faster at lower NaOH concentrations. The H2O2 concentration profiles roughly followed zeroth-order kinetics up to about 50% conversion after which the rate decreased. On the other hand, the reaction rate of diol showed a much weaker dependence on the NaOH concentration (Fig. S3)."
8,Physical characterization of Au/C before and after reaction,"3.3 Physical characterization of Au/C before and after reaction The rate of diol conversion decreased noticeably with time over the first 3 h, despite the conversion being 12% or less. In order to examine whether this decrease was due to catalyst instability, the catalysts were characterized before and after reaction. TEM was used to detect changes in Au particle size and the results indicated no significant changes after reaction (Fig. S4a–c). Compared to the fresh catalyst, the XPS binding energies and peak shapes of the Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks remained unchanged post catalysis, although the peak intensities decreased significantly relative to the carbon peak while the intensity of the oxygen peak increased (Fig. S5). The enhanced oxygen peak intensity and attenuated Au peak intensity could be ascribed to surface coverage with organics. BET surface area measurements showed a slight decrease in the surface area for the spent catalyst (977 m2 g−1) when compared with the fresh catalyst (1042 m2 g−1) and insignificant changes in the pore volume (0.64 mL g−1 spent vs.0.63 mL g−1 fresh)."
9,Effect of products and intermediates on reaction rates,"3.4 Effect of products and intermediates on reaction rates Acid products (lactic acid, acetic acid and formic acid), in quantities detected after 3 h of reaction under standard conditions were added in a control experiment under otherwise standard conditions to examine the possibility of product inhibition. At these concentrations, the presence of these acids showed no effect on the reaction rates of diol oxidation (Fig. S6) or H2O2 formation throughout the course of the reaction (Fig. S7). The effect of H2O2 on the reaction was examined by adding H2O2 into an otherwise standard reaction mixture such that its concentration at time zero was 3.5 mM. This concentration was close to the highest concentration of H2O2 detected in this study. Its presence had little effect on the initial or long-term oxidation rates of the diol (Fig. S8) regardless of pH, although it made the H2O2 concentration-time profile more complicated (Fig. S9). The H2O2 concentration decreased rapidly at first and then slowly approached the same quasi steady state value as that of a reaction conducted without the addition of H2O2. The reaction of hydroxyacetone was also investigated since it is a possible reaction intermediate (Scheme 1)[4,5], although it had not been detected in our experiments. In 0.5 M NaOH and O2, 0.015 M hydroxyacetone reacted rapidly over the catalyst and more than half had reacted in 5 min (Fig. S10). Simultaneously, H2O2 was also formed rapidly and accumulated to the maximum H2O2 concentration in about 15 min. Afterwards, degradation of H2O2 occurred rapidly until it was all consumed."
10,Effect of interrupting the reaction,"3.5 Effect of interrupting the reaction In order to further understand the changes in the reaction rates with reaction time, experiments were designed to interrupt the reaction by switching the flow of O2 to N2 or by removing and then replacing the Au/C catalyst with a fresh batch. Fig. 4 shows the effect of replacing the O2 flow with N2 during a standard experiment. Immediately after switching the O2 flow to N2 at 15 min (the time of maximum accumulated H2O2), the rate of diol reaction dropped by at least 90%. Thus, the primary route for diol oxidation was with O2 and not with H2O2. Diol conversion resumed after O2 was readmitted 60 min later, but the rate was slower than if there was no interruption of the O2 flow. While none of the oxygenates reacted in N2, H2O2 degradation occurred and its concentration decreased from 3.1 to 0.51 mM in 60 min. The rate of degradation was similar to that of running H2O2 decomposition experiment in N2 with added H2O2 (Section 3.3) indicating that H2O2 production stopped when diol oxidation stopped. Accumulation of H2O2 recovered upon reintroduction of O2 and reached about the same quasi-steady state concentration as was observed for a standard run. However, the rate to reach this quasi-steady state value was much slower than at the beginning of the run. In another experiment, the effect of replacing the catalyst in use with fresh catalyst was examined. A reaction was first conducted under the standard condition for 90 min and then the reaction mixture was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter to remove the catalyst. 15 mL of the filtrate was combined with 15 mL of fresh diol in 1 M NaOH. After purging with N2 for ∼3 min, 15 mg of fresh Au/C catalyst was introduced and the reaction was re-started by flowing in O2. It was observed that, even with a fresh charge of catalyst, the diol oxidation rate was significantly slower than for the standard condition using a totally fresh batch of reagents (Fig. 5 ). This result suggested that trace amounts of residual side products in the filtrate adsorbed onto the fresh catalysts and slowed down the oxidation rate of the alcohol by site blocking. Although the H2O2 time-on-stream profiles were qualitatively similar before and after catalyst replacement and both reached about the same maximum H2O2 concentrations, the reaction rates were slower with the replacement catalyst. Thus, poisoning of the replacement catalyst affected all reactions equally."
11,Oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.6 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol A large primary isotope effect was observed for both the non-oxidative [11,12] and oxidative [12,13] dehydrogenation of alcohols when deuterium was substituted for hydrogen in the α-C–H bond of alcohols. This suggests that breaking of the α-C–H bond is involved in the rate determining step. To evaluate the relative importance of pKa and α-C–H bond of an alcohol in determining its reactivity, the reaction of diol was compared with the reaction of benzyl alcohol at pH 14. The pKa of benzyl alcohol (15.4) [14] is higher than that of 1,2 propanediol (14.9) [15]. The experimental α-C–H bond energy for benzyl alcohol is 83−85 kcal mol−1[16], and its calculated values from DFT is between 83.7 [17] and 84.3 kcal mol-1[18] whereas the calculated values for 1,2-propanediol is between 95.7 [17] and 100.9 kcal mol−1[18]. For a 0.1 M alcohol solution at pH 14, the RO− concentration is 3.83 mM for benzyl alcohol and 11.2 mM for the diol. Despite the three-fold lower concentration of RO−, benzyl alcohol reacted much faster than the diol (Fig. S9). Under the highly basic conditions, benzaldehyde and benzoate were the only two hydrocarbon products detected, but the carbon balance was only 62% at the termination of the run. It has been reported that in benzyl alcohol oxidation, higher molecular weight products such as esters and ethers can be formed [19]. We expect that the esters would be hydrolyzed to the carboxylate (or acid) and the alcohol under our highly basic reaction conditions and by the acid mobile phase during our HLPC analysis and detected. However, high molecular-weight ethers would not be detected and they could be some of the undetected products as ethers are extremely stable."
12,Discussion,"The data can be summarized as follows; they showed definitively that H2O2 was produced during oxidation of the diol, and that multiple reactions occurred simultaneously the extents of which depended on the reaction time. In spite of the complexity, the temporal product concentration profiles were qualitatively similar for all experiments within the range of diol (0.2–0.4 M) and NaOH (0.25–1 M) concentrations studied. In all cases, there was a rapid initial rise in H2O2 concentration concomitant with consumption of the diol. As the reaction proceeded, the rates of both H2O2 formation and diol consumption slowed. Whereas the diol consumption continued at increasingly slower rates, the rate of H2O2 accumulation changed drastically such that its concentration reached a maximum and then decreased slowly. Both the reaction rates and the maximum concentrations of H2O2 detected depended strongly on the diol and NaOH concentrations. We focused our discussion on three periods of this reaction profile: at the start of the reaction (initial rates), when the H2O2 concentration reached a maximum, and beyond this maximum point."
13,Initial reaction rates,"4.1 Initial reaction rates The reaction was initiated when O2 was bubbled into the liquid. We assumed that the system had a short transient, of the order of one minute or less, and extrapolation of data collected from 1 to 5 min could yield reliable initial reaction rates. This assumption was supported by the fact that the concentration of acid products showed a nearly linear increase with time (Fig. S12). The H2O2 concentration profile showed some deviation from linearity and the deviation became more severe with lower diol and NaOH concentrations. This observation is not surprising as H2O2 degradation over Au/C was suppressed in the presence of diol (Fig. 2) and higher NaOH concentration (Fig. 3). The initial rates of H2O2 formation and diol consumption collected under otherwise standard conditions using different concentrations of diol and NaOH are shown in Table S1. These initial rates increased with the concentrations of NaOH and diol. At t = 0 min, there were no reaction products or H2O2. Thus, these initial rates were not affected by secondary reactions of the products such as decomposition of dissolved H2O2 or deactivation of the catalyst. That is, these reaction rates reflected the intrinsic oxidation reactivity of the diol on a fresh catalyst. Assuming the Au particles were uniform 3.28 nm spheres and the surface density of Au atoms was 17.8 atoms/nm2, TOFs were calculated for the diol and NaOH concentrations studied. Their values ranged from 32 to 88 mol diol (mol Au-1min-1), being higher at higher diol and NaOH concentrations (Table S1). These values were in line with values reported for this type of reaction [20]. The strong dependence of the diol oxidation rate on solution pH suggests that deprotonation of the diol is an important step and that the diolate (RO−) may be involved in the rate limiting step. The diolate concentrations can be calculated from the diol and NaOH concentrations and pKa of the diol (Table S1). These rate data in Table S1 can be analyzed assuming that the reaction follows the Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism and the rate limiting step is the surface reaction of adsorbed diolate with a rate constant krd : (1) R O s o l - ⇄ R O ads - (2) R O ads - ⟶ O 2 Products Then the rate of diol reaction is: (3) r a t e d i o l = k r d θ (4) θ = K m R O - s o l 1 + K m R O - s o l (5) 1 r a t e d i o l = 1 K m k r d [ R O - ] s o l + 1 k r d where θ is the surface coverage of diolate, and Km = kads/kdes is the adsorption equilibrium of the diolate. Eq. (5) suggests a linear relationship between the inverse reaction rate and inverse diolate concentration. This is indeed the case for the initial rates of diol conversion and H2O2 accumulation (Fig. 6 A and B, respectively). It is significant that these linear relationships were obtained using data from experiments in which the concentrations of ROH and NaOH were varied independently from 0.1 to 0.4 M and from 0.25 M to 1 M, respectively. These observations suggest that under our conditions, the catalytic site properties do not change with [OH−], the reaction rate is not directly dependent on [OH−], and the OH− ion is not involved in the rate limiting step. Instead, the important species is the diolate ion. From Fig. 6A for the diol conversion, the values of Km and krd were found to be 0.079 mM−1 and 0.96 mM min−1, respectively. Two important observations are apparent from these linear relationships. First, according to Eq. (5), extrapolation of these two plots to the y-axis yields the rates of ROH conversion and H2O2 accumulation at infinite diolate concentration (i.e. when θ equals unity). The data show that the intercepts of the two plots are the same within uncertainties, meaning that the two rates are the same (0.96 mM min−1 and 0.91 mM min−1, respectively for diol conversion and H2O2 accumulation). This means that when the surface is saturated with diolate, each molecule of diolate reacted generates one molecule of H2O2 and one molecule of lactate, that is, Au/C is capable of forming H2O2 selectively without forming CO2 during alcohol oxidation to acid. This 1:1 stoichiometry can be understood with the mechanism shown in Scheme 2 . In this mechanism, the alcoholate is formed by deprotonation of the alcohol in the basic solution. Abstraction of the α-C–H is the rate limiting step for both the non-oxidative and oxidative mode of alcohol dehydrogenation but the latter reaction is significantly faster than the former [12] indicative of the effectiveness of O2 in breaking the C–H bond. O2 is proposed to adsorb associatively to form a peroxy. Retention of the OO bond in the O2 molecule is important for peroxide formation as is recognized in the literature [21–25]. Abstraction of an α-C‒H by the peroxy forms an adsorbed hydroperoxy. This step could be facilitated by nucleophilic attack of the carbon by a H2O molecule that results in a gem diolate. H2O2 is formed together with a molecule of H2O by abstraction of the second α-CH and deprotonation of the carboxylate intermediate. The desire to retain the OO bond in O2 is one of the reasons that Au is an effective catalyst as Au interacts weakly with O2 [26] and has a low tendency for OO bond cleavage. This mechanism is also consistent with literature results of isotope labeling experiments which demonstrated that the O atoms in H2O2 originate from molecular O2 [27] and the O atom in the organic acid is derived from water [2]. Thus, the primary role of NaOH is for generation of the diolate by deprotonation of the alcohol. The second observation from the linear relationships of Fig. 5 is that the slopes for diol conversion and H2O2 accumulation are slightly different such that at finite diolate concentrations, H2O2 accumulation is always slightly slower than diol conversion. The percentage difference increases with decreasing diolate concentration (Table S1), that is, increasing fraction of the diol reacts nonproductively with decreasing surface coverage of diolate. Thus, there is a competing pathway that increases in importance as the coverage of diolate decreases and results in diol conversion without forming H2O2. This can be understood if the OO bond of the adsorbed hydroperoxy is cleaved before formation of H2O2 (Scheme 3 ). This requires an unoccupied site adjacent to the hydroperoxy. Since the probability of finding an unoccupied adjacent site increases with lower diolate coverage, the H2O2 yield per diol reacted decreases with decreasing diolate concentration, i.e. surface coverage of diolate. Although using this reasoning would result in the same observation if O2 is adsorbed dissociatively, we prefer the model of dissociation of adsorbed peroxy because the peroxy bond is weaker than the OO bond of the O2 molecule. The rate-limiting step in the mechanism is the abstraction of the H atom of the α-C–H bond by a surface peroxy. It implies that the rate should depend on the α-C–H bond strength. Indeed, a comparison of 0.1 M benzyl alcohol and diol oxidation shows that although the solution concentration of the benzyloxide anion was only one third of that of the diolate, benzyl alcohol reacted much faster than the diol (Fig. S11), consistent with its much lower α-C–H bond energy. The scheme also explains why diolate is the relevant kinetic species instead of the neutral diol. It is known that the α-C–H bond of an alcoholate ion is significantly weaker than that of the neutral form [28]. For 1,2-propanediol, the calculated α-C–H bond of the diolate is 95.4 kcal mol−1, which is significantly lower than the calculated 100.9 kcal mol−1 for the neutral molecule [18]."
14,Reactions beyond the initial period,"4.2 Reactions beyond the initial period After about 5−15 min of reaction, depending on the condition, the rates of both diol conversion and accumulation of H2O2 in the liquid decreased. The decrease in rate of H2O2 accumulation was quite rapid, and a maximum concentration was reached when only 2–4% of the diol had reacted in all experiments. We surmise that the cause for decline in the rate of diol conversion was due to catalyst deactivation, which also affected H2O2 production. The rate of H2O2 accumulation was also influenced by the concurrent degradation and consumption of H2O2 alongside its formation. The following possible causes for the decline of rate of acid accumulation were examined: sintering of Au metal particles, competition for active sites by reaction products, catalyst deactivation due to site blocking, and reaction of H2O2 with diol. The possibility of metal particle sintering can be ruled out because examination of the catalysts with HRTEM before and after reaction (Fig. S4) did not show significant changes in the Au particle size distribution. Competition of active sites by the major reaction products can be excluded when we observed that adding lactic, acetic, and formic acids or H2O2 intentionally did not change the reaction rates (Section 3.4). Catalyst poisoning by site blocking was examined with experiments in which either the catalyst was replaced in the middle of a run (Fig. 5) or the gas supply was switched between O2 and N2 (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows that after filtering and replacing the catalyst with a fresh batch and 50% of the liquid with fresh reactants, the diol conversion and H2O2 accumulation rates of the “refreshed” system were slower than those of a completely fresh system. The data suggest that some minor reaction products other than lactic, acetic, and formic acid caused decline in catalyst activity, and these minor products were carried over to the “refreshed” mixture with the filtrate. This conclusion is also supported by the data from experiments in which the O2 flow was interrupted. As shown in Fig. 4, after resumption of O2 flow, the diol conversion rate did not resume to those just before the O2 flow was stopped but was slower. That is, the catalyst activity for diol conversion declined in the period when the system was purged by N2. This activity decline is reflected also in the H2O2 accumulation rate. During N2 flow, degradation of H2O2 occurred as expected from the data in Fig. 3. After resumption of O2 flow, the H2O2 accumulation resumed but at a much slower rate (from 90 to 120 min in Fig. 5) than the rate before the flow interruption (about 5 min) or the rate at comparable H2O2 concentration in a standard experiment (Fig. 1). Thus, the overall catalyst activity was lower for all reactions. It has been reported in the literature that Au catalysts can be deactivated by compounds with OH groups bound to secondary carbon atoms such as sugar acids or polyols produce ketones, enones and/or compounds with b-dicarbonyl structure [20]. There is also evidence in the literature for a system operating at higher concentrations of reactants, that deactivation could be due to pore blocking [29], which would have the same effect as blocking of active sites. It is interesting to note that after resumption of O2 flow, eventually the accumulated H2O2 concentration returns to roughly the same as a standard experiment without gas flow interruption. It implies that active site blocking affects all reactions roughly equally. A model consistent with our observations and those in the literature is that oligomeric surface species, formed from some minor oxidation products of diol, block the active sites and decrease the catalyst activities for diol conversion and H2O2 formation and degradation. We postulate that lactaldehyde or its tautomer hydroxyacteone are likely precursors of the site blocking oligomers. Literature report show that oxidation of hydroxyacetone can result in polymeric or heavy side products [30]. Fig. 2 shows that the rates of degradation of H2O2 in the liquid are strongly affected by the reaction conditions. In the absence of a catalyst, H2O2 degrades quite slowly even at 1 M NaOH. The degradation is very rapid in the presence of the Au/C catalyst to the extent that accurate rate data could not be collected. Interestingly, addition of diol suppresses the degradation rate significantly for all conditions tested, and the extent of suppression increases with pH indicating that the “protective effect” is consequent of the coverage of active site for H2O2 decomposition by the diolate."
15,Conclusion,"H2O2 can be produced effectively in conjunction with alcohol oxidation. The alcohol, in the form of alcoholate, serves as the hydrogen source. Importantly, H2O2 is produced stoichiometrically, such that one molecule is produced for every diol reacted. However, this is possible only when the catalyst surface is saturated with the alcoholate, such that O2 is adsorbed and reacts without cleaving the OO bond because there is no unoccupied surface site adjacent to the adsorbed peroxy or hydroperoxy. The observation that adsorbed alcoholate suppresses degradation of dissolved H2O2 by blocking the catalytic sites could be used to improve process yields. Our data imply that hydroxide ions are not involved in the rate limiting step. Instead, their function is to generate alcoholate ions which are the catalytically relevant species. We attribute this to the purported weaker α-C‒H bond in the alcoholate than the neutral alcohol. We further demonstrated that alcoholate plays an additional important role in suppressing H2O2 degradation. This is the reason why a highly basic solution facilitates H2O2 formation during alcohol oxidation as well as preserving the H2O2 formed. For these reasons, Au is a desirable catalyst because it can retain catalytic activity in oxidizing and basic conditions. The cause of slow catalyst deactivation remains unclear. A possibility is the blocking of active sites by oligomeric species or minor oxidation products that contain carbonyl groups. If so, conducting the reaction in solvents that dissolve such oligomers could prolong catalyst life."
