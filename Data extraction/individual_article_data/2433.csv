0,Introduction,"With the inevitable depletion of the world’s energy supply, there has been an increasing worldwide interest in alternative sources of energy [1]. Ethanol can be supplemented for gasoline as a fuel for transportation and also can be used as a substrate for biodiesel production. Hence, bioenergy technology focuses heavily on converting biomass feedstock to bioethanol and/or biodiesel at this moment [2,3]. Hydrogen is considered an ideal and clean energy carrier for the future because of its high conversion, recyclability and non-polluting nature [4]. Fermentative hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention recently due to its high rate of hydrogen evolution and its applicability to different types of organic wastes and wastewaters from industrial processes. Furthermore, using organic wastes reduce waste disposal problems [5,6]. In addition to H2 production, anaerobic fermentation also produces a significant amount of alcohols (such as ethanol). Due to the conversion of hydrogen to methane in the anaerobic fermentation process, the blocking of the methanogenesis in the anaerobic pathway is one of the key considerations. The inhibition of the methanogenic activity can be achieved by controlling various parameters, such as the pH [7], aerobic pretreatment [8] and the solids retention time (SRT) [9], for acidogenesis. Of the various parameters, the aerobic pretreatment is considered to be useful and economic. In general, the inhibition of methanogens can be achieved by using aerobic pretreatment for 30–40 days [10]. Biohydrogen production from wastewater through fermentation is carried out by anaerobic acidogenic bacteria with highly diverse fermentation characteristics and hydrogen production capabilities [11]. Fermentation performance is dependent on a number of factors [12], such as temperature, pH and hydrogen partial pressure. Hariklia et al. [13] showed that the most suitable temperature for biological hydrogen production was 35 °C. Moon et al. [14] indicated that pH in the fermentation process would drop rapidly with the abundant soluble microbial products (especially acetate) and pH 4.0 was regarded as the operational limit for the anaerobic biohydrogen production process. Mizuno et al. [15] studied the continuous stirring of the anaerobic culture and the removal of the hydrogen by supplying another gas (such as nitrogen) could help to keep a low hydrogen partial pressure and thus result in enhanced hydrogen production rate and yield. The variations of these factors result in diverse microbial communities, which lead to different hydrogen yields [16]. However, most studies have been focused on the mechanism of hydrogen production by pure cultures from single carbohydrates, insufficient information is available on biological fermentative hydrogen and ethanol production from molasses in a mixed microbial community culture. In this study, using molasses as the sole carbon substrate, the performance of continuous H2 and ethanol production rate was investigated at different organic loading rates (OLRs) for CSTR. The objective of this work was to develop innovative fermentation technology for dual production of two most critical biomass energy products, H2 and ethanol."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental set-up,"2.1 Experimental set-up Continuous culture was performed in a 12.5 L continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with an effective volume of 5.4 L (Fig. 1 ). The reactor, operated in a continuous flow mode, was completely mixed by a variable speed stirred with a gear shift. Temperature was automatically kept at the level of 35 ± 1 °C using an electric jacket. The influent flow rate was controlled by a feed pump. Biogas generated during the reactor operation was collected by a water displacement method through an outlet provided at the top of the reactor. The hydrogen collection system consisted of a water separator."
3,Hydrogen-producing sludge and cultivation,"2.2 Hydrogen-producing sludge and cultivation The seed sludge used in this study was obtained from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Prior to use, the sludge was first sieved through mesh with a diameter of 0.5 mm in order to remove waste materials that could cause pump failure. The sludge settled at room temperature for 10 days, was aerated for 30 days to inhibit the methane-producing bacteria activity and then was added into the CSTR. Afterward, the diluted molasses with chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 4000 mg/L was fed into the CSTR continuously at the HRT of 6 h. At the beginning of the start-up period, the biomass in the reactor was approximately 17.74 gMLVSS/L."
4,Feeding,"2.3 Feeding Normal molasses, containing about 53% sugars, was diluted by water to certain loading rate (8–32 kg COD/m3 reactor/d). The molasses used throughout the study was collected from a local sugar refining industry and its characteristics are given in Table 1 . The COD: N: P of the influent was maintained at a ratio of 1000:5:1 by adding synthetic fertilizer in order to supply microorganisms with adequate nitrogen and phosphorus."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods COD, biogas yield and its constituents were measured and monitored daily in the CSTR. These analyses were performed according to Standard Methods [17]. Biogas yield was measured at room temperature by a wet gas meter (Model LML-1, Changchun Filter Co. Ltd., Changchun, China), while its constituents were analyzed using a gas chromatography (SC-7, Shandong Lunan Instrument Factory). The gas chromatography was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless steel column (2 m × 5 mm) filled with Porapak Q (50–80 meshes). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. A dose of injected sample was 0.5 ml each time. Based on the percentage of hydrogen in biogas, the hydrogen yield could be calculated. Detection of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the fermentation solution was analyzed by a another gas chromatograph (GC112, Shanghai Anal. Inst.Co.) using a flame ionization detector (FID). A 2-m stainless steel column was packed with the supporter GDX-103 (60–80 meshes). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 220 °C, 190 °C, and 220 °C, respectively. The carrier gas was also nitrogen at a flow rate of 30 ml/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,H2 and ethanol production,"3.1 H2 and ethanol production The performance of H2 and ethanol (EtOH) production in CSTR is indicated in Table 2 . Regardless of different OLRs, the H2 production rate initially increased with an increase in OLR and the highest OLR tested (24 kg/m3 d) gave the highest H2 production rate of 12.4 mmol/h l. The highest ethanol production rate also reached 20.27 mmol/h l for OLR = 24 kg/m3 d. However, the H2 and ethanol production rate tended to decrease with an increase of OLR to 32 kg/m3 d. Using higher OLR could lead to a higher H2 and ethanol production rate, but much more OLR would result in inhibition of H2 and ethanol production activity (Table 3 ). The above correlation between biofuels production could be a result of the difference in metabolism by the mixed bacterial population in the sludge culture, in which H2-producing bacteria may have a different substrate concentration preference from the population that tended to produce solvents (e.g., ethanol)."
8,Composition of soluble metabolities,"3.2 Composition of soluble metabolities In soluble metabolites (i.e., soluble microbial products; SMP), regardless of different OLRs, the major product was ethanol, which accounted for the 31–59% of total SMP. The next abundant products were acetate and butyrate, contributing to 23–33% and 11–20% of SMP, respectively. Meanwhile, a small quantity of propionate was also produced. This soluble metabolite composition indicates that the culture environment was favorable for H2 production metabolism of the bacterial populations in different OLRs, because in most efficient H2-producing system, ethanol was the predominant product (Reaction 1) [18]. The theoretical yield of hydrogen is 2 mol hydrogen/mol glucose in butyrate fermentation(Reaction 2), which is the same as that of the ethanol fermentation. However, the butyrate production pathway has the potential to change to the butanol production pathway, where hydrogen may be consumed [19]. The percentage of propionate in soluble microbial products increased from 0.8% to 18% as OLR increased from 24 kg/m3 d to 32 kg/m3 d, the hydrogen production rate decreased from 12.4 mmol/h l to 8.67 mmol/h l. This result corresponded with Wang [20] reported that propionate fermentation exhibited a low hydrogen production capability (Reaction 3). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O + 2 NADH → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 HCO 3 − + 2 NAD + + 2 H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO − + 2 HCO 3 − + 2 H 2 + 3 H + (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 NADH → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COO − + 2 H 2 O + 2 NAD + The collection between H2 and ethanol producing pathways can also be observed from Fig. 2 , showing that, the H2 and ethanol production rates were in general proportionately correlated irrespective of the different OLRs. Linear regression results show that the correlation between ethanol production rate (y) and H2 production rate (x) can be expressed as y = 0.5431x + 1.6816 (r 2 = 0.7617)."
9,Energy conversion rate,"3.3 Energy conversion rate Since our fermentation systems produced a significant amount of gaseous and liquid biofuels (i.e., H2 and ethanol), the process performance in terms of energy conversion derived from the combination of the two biofuels was calculated according to their combustion heat values [21]. As depicted in Table 2, The energy conversion rate (ECR) tended to increase as OLR increased from 8 to 24 kg/m3 d, which is quite obvious because both H2 and ethanol production rates increased with increasing OLR (Table 2). The maximum energy conversion rate was 31.23 kJ/h l, taking place when CSTR was fed with OLR at 24 kg/m3 d, this difference could be attributed to the variation in bacterial population and structure. From the aspect of total energy conversion, production of both H2 and ethanol may be superior to producing biofuel. Moreover, since H2 and ethanol are present in different phases, separation of the two biofuels would be relatively easy, leading to additional economical benefits arising from simple down-stream processing."
10,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated a feasible bioreactor system for simultaneous production of H2 and ethanol as biofuels. The H2 and ethanol production rate in CSTR initially increased with increasing OLR (from 8 to 24 kg/m3 d). However, the H2 and ethanol production rate tended to decrease with an increase of OLR to 32 kg/m3 d. The highest production rate of hydrogen and ethanol attained from this work was 12.4 mmol/h l and 20.27 mmol/h l, respectively. This work also utilized energy conversion rate (base on heat values of H2 and ethanol) as a performance indicator for overall energy conversion rate of the bioprocesses examined. Using molasses as substrate, the CSTR system operated at OLR = 24 kg/m3 d exhibited the best energy conversion rate of 31.23 kJ/h l."
