0,Introduction,"Catalytic transformation of biomass into biofuels or other value-added chemicals has emerged as an efficient strategy to alleviate the possible shortage of fossil resources in the future [1–4]. Biomass-derived fatty acids widely existing in biomass-derived oils and fats can be hydrogenated or deoxygenated to produce value-added fatty alcohols or biofuel hydrocarbons respectively [5–8]. Fatty alcohols have attracted huge interest in recent years due to their increased demand in many areas of application including surfactants, plasticizers and food additives [9,10]. Catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acids with molecular H2 has been widely studied in both homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic systems [11,12]. Although the bimetallic Cu-Cr catalyst has been shown to exhibit excellent selectivity to fatty alcohols from the hydrogenation of fatty acids, the presence of Cr in the bimetallic Cu-Cr catalyst poses serious environmental concern due to the toxicity of Cr [10]. A series of Cr-free bimetallic catalysts including Ru-Sn [13–15], Cu-Zn [16], and Cu-Fe [17] have been fabricated and investigated towards hydrogenation of fatty acids. Although these catalysts displayed equally good catalytic performance towards hydrogenation of fatty acids, the conversion systems, unfortunately, require the use of highly pressurized molecular H2 as the hydrogen donor. Such a technologically difficult conversion strategy is limited by inherently many challenges associated with the handling of compressed hydrogen gas including hydrogen gas storage, transportation, and other safety concerns [18–20]. Efforts have been put towards the development of suitable alternatives in which in situ hydrogenation protocol by the use of alcohols seemed very promising [21–23]. Catalytic in situ hydrogenation of fatty acids with isopropanol, methanol or methanol-water as hydrogen donors have been investigated in recent years with limited. Wang and co-workers reported a 100% oleic acid conversion alongside >90% selectivity to octadecanol in the isopropanol system over the CoOx catalyst [18]. Given the consumption rate of the relatively expensive isopropanol which simultaneously served as both solvent and hydrogen donor, commercialization of this isopropanol-based in situ hydrogenation process is cost-ineffective from an industrial standpoint. An 85% conversion and a 100% fatty alcohol selectivity have been attained in a much cheaper methanol system over Cu/SiO2 catalysts from the conversion of fatty acids derivative [24]. A methanol-water hydrothermal system (little methanol as hydrogen donor and water as solvent) has been developed to further reduce cost using Cu/Zn/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 as catalysts [25,26]. Besides cost reduction, a methanol-water hydrothermal system often results in hydrogens with high gravimetric densities since hydrogen can also be obtained from H2O during aqueous-phase reforming of methanol (APRM) [27,28]. However, high-temperature hydrothermal instability of the Al2O3 carrier is not well suitable to maintain good catalyst reusability [29,30]. Therefore, the development of alternative catalysts with much improved hydrothermal stability is highly desirable for in situ hydrogenation of fatty acids. Herein, we report a tannin-derived carbon-supported monometallic Cu/C, Co/C and bimetallic CuCo/C catalysts with different Cu/Co ratios for in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water hydrothermal system. The monometallic Cu/C, Co/C, and bimetallic CuCo/C catalysts with varying Cu/Co ratios showed different catalytic activity and product distribution in the methanol-water hydrothermal system. Various characterizations including X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the chemical composition and structure of catalysts. The catalytic activity and the stability of the unsupported bimetallic Cu-Co catalyst were also investigated for in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid. The effect of different kinds of hydrogen donors (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and isopropanol) on in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid is compared. Also, the effects of process parameters including the quantity of methanol, catalyst loading and reaction time on the conversion of lauric acid were systematically studied and optimized."

Lauric acid (98%) and lauryl alcohol (95%) were acquired from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (98%), ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (98%), and methyl laurate (99%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation, Shanghai, China. Tannin (AR), undecane (98%) and dodecane (98%) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. The deionized water was made in our laboratory. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis The carbon-supported monometallic Cu/C, Co/C and bimetallic CuCo/C catalysts with different Cu/Co ratios (4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) were synthesized by the combination of previous experiments (seen in Scheme 1 ) [31–33]. Briefly, a calculated amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and/or Co(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 4 mL ethanol and stirred for ~30 min. Following this, a 2.0 g of tannin was slowly added into the above mixture and stirred for another 4 h. The as-obtained dark liquid mixture was dried under reduced pressure for 6 h. The resultant solid was calcined at 500 °C (300, 400, 600 and 700 °C is adopted in Fig. 5b) in an H2 atmosphere for 2 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature overnight under N2 flow to obtain the final product. The obtained catalysts are Cu/C, Co/C, 5% CuCo/C, CuCo/C, 15% CuCo/C, Cu4Co/C, Cu2Co/C, CuCo2/C and CuCo4/C. Besides 5% CuCo/C and 15% CuCo/C catalysts, the combined theoretical weight loading of Cu and Co in other catalysts is 10 wt%. For comparison, fructose was utilized as an alternative source of carbon and the obtained catalysts denoted as CuCo/FC. Similarly, bimetallic CuAl, CuZr, CuCo, ZnCo, FeCo and NiCo catalysts with Cu/Zn/Fe/Ni loading of 20 wt% were also synthesized by co-precipitation method [2]. Briefly, calculated amounts of the mixed metal salts were dissolved in 200 mL deionized water at 25 °C. A 150 mL mixture of Na2CO3 and NaOH aqueous solution was slowly added into the metal salt solution and stirred for 3 h at 90 °C. After aged at 90 °C for another 3 h, the solid was recovered by filtration and then washed severally with deionized water before been dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The dried sample was calcined at 350 °C in air for 3 h, followed by a reduction in H2 atmosphere at 350 °C for another 1 h. CoOx, 10% CuCo, 30% CuCo and 40% CuCo catalysts were synthesized in a similar fashion by adjusting the amount of the Cu precursor."
4,Experiment and analytical method,"2.3 Experiment and analytical method The in-situ hydrogenation of lauric acid was performed in a 1.67 mL micro-batch reactor purchased from Swagelok, Solon, OH, U.S.A. Firstly, calculated amounts of lauric acid, catalysts, methanol (0–80 mg) and 0.5 mL DI H2O were charged into the reactor and sealed properly. The reactor sank into a fluidized sand bath (Techne SBL-2) and heated to set temperature. At the end of the reaction time, the reactor was immediately submerged into a cold-water bath to quench the reaction. The products were dissolved in acetone in readiness for analysis. The analyses of the products were performed on Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent CP-FFAP column and flame ionization detector (FID). The quantitative analysis was performed using external calibration curves for each compound. The reported data are average values of three repeated measurements. The error bars represent the standard deviation from three replicate experiments. The conversion of lauric acid, yields of different products and selectivity were calculated using the following equations: Conversion % = 1 − moles of remaining reactant moles of reactant added × 100 % Yield % = moles of product moles of reactant added × 100 % Selectivity % = yield conversion × 100 %"
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The crystal structure of catalysts was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique recorded on PANalytical Empyrean 200,895 instrument operating at 30 mA and 40 kV using Ni-filtered Cu Kα source (λ = 0.154 nm). The catalysts were scanned over a 2θ range 10–80°. The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was performed on the FineSorb-3010 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Zhejiang Finetec Instruments Co., Ltd.). Typically, ~50 mg of the sample was pretreated at 120 °C for 2 h under He flow and then cooled to 40 °C. Following this, the reactor was heated to 700 °C under H2 flow (30 mL min − 1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and the H2-TPR profiles acquired. The actual metal loadings of the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) performed on PerkinElmer Optima 8300 instrument. The samples were dissolved in aqua regia before analysis. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed at 250 °C for 12 h. The specific surface area of the catalysts was determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The pore size was obtained by Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) adsorption average pore diameter. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a JEM-2100F microscopy instrument with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Raman spectra of Cu/C, Co/C, and CuCo4/C catalysts were collected on LabRAM HR Evolution Raman Spectrometer."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterizations,"3.1 Characterizations The X-ray diffraction patterns of Cu/C, CuCo4/C, and Co/C are presented in Fig. 1 . The diffraction pattern of monometallic Cu/C catalyst has three main peaks at 43.3, 50.4 and 74.1° attributed respectively to (111), (200) and (220) reflections of metallic Cu with face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice (PDF #04-0836) [34]. The diffraction pattern of Co/C catalyst on the other hand exhibit both cubic Co (PDF #15-0806) [35] and hexagonal Co (PDF #05-0727) [36] crystal phases but predominantly cubic metallic Co phase. The diffraction pattern of the representative bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst contains two separate patterns attributed to metallic Cu and Co, which indicates that both Cu and Co nanoparticles are separately dispersed on the carbon support. Also, the hexagonal Co crystal phase present in the monometallic Co/C catalyst was not found in the bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst, suggesting that the presence of Cu has an effect on phase selectivity of cobalt oxides during the reduction process. The average crystallite size of Cu/C, Co/C and CuCo/C as determined using Scherrer equation is 57.7 nm (Cu), 34.6 nm (Co) and 48.7 nm (Cu, 19.5 nm for Co) [37]. The crystallite size of both Cu and Co in the bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst is much lower than they are in their respective monometallic catalysts - Cu/C and Co/C. It should be noted that the tannin-based carbon-supported CuCo4/C-N2 catalyst treated in an N2 atmosphere (rather than H2) shows the co-existence of metallic Cu and CoO (PDF #48–1719) [38] with no metallic Co detected (Fig. S1). This observation indicates the Cu-tannin complexes are very readily reduced to metallic Cu at 500 °C even in the N2 atmosphere, unlike Co-tannin complexes that can only decompose to form CoO in N2. N2 adsorption-desorption profile of CuCo4/C and the corresponding pore size distribution are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b respectively. CuCo4/C catalyst displays a high adsorption amount of N2 at low relative pressure a type-IV isotherm with an H3-type hysteresis loop, indicating the co-existence of both micropores and mesopores [39–41]. Furthermore, the corresponding pore size distribution shown in Fig. 2b suggests a hierarchical pore structure. The surface area, microporous surface area and total pore volume of CuCo4/C catalyst is 194.5 m2/g, 28.3 m2/g (t-plot micropore area) and 0.3 cm3/g (BJH adsorption cumulative volume of pores) respectively, from which we can conclude that in situ pyrolysis of CuCo-tannin complexes in H2 atmosphere can generate a sizable portion of mesopores and a small portion of micropores. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurement was made to determine the actual metal loadings of the as-obtained catalysts; the results are shown in Table S1. Cu/C catalyst gave a 9.9% Cu weight loading that is very close to the theoretical 10% weight loading. This indicates that the Cu-tannin complexes are very stable in an H2 atmosphere. In contrast, a drastic increase in Co weight loading as high as 93.9% was observed over the Co/C catalyst due to massive loss oxygen and/or carbon atoms in the Co-tannin complexes during high-temperature (500 °C) treatment in H2. This severe loss of oxygen and/carbon atoms is possibly due to weak interaction between Co and tannin. Upon introducing a certain amount of Cu into the Co-tannin complexes, degradation of O/C in the Co-tanning complex was controllably inhibited. For example, CuCo4/C with an initial Cu and Co weight loadings of 2% and 8% respectively resulted in a 14% Cu and 48.7% Co weight loadings at the end of pyrolysis. Although CuCo4/C treated in N2 (CuCo4/C-N2) exhibits a negligible weight loss, in situ reductions of CoO to produce Co cannot be realized in N2 atmosphere according to its H2-TPR profile result shown in Fig. 3a; as a result, CuCo4/C-N2 shows much lower catalytic activity than CuCo4/C-H2 under the same reaction conditions (Fig. S2). For the Cu/C-N2 precursor, the presence of only a negligible H2 consumption peak below 500 °C in Fig. 3a indicates that copper has been reduced to Cu0 in Cu/C-N2. This observation is in good agreement with the XRD result in Fig. S1. The H2 consumption peak above 500 °C is ascribed to the removal of O/C from the tannin framework. For the Co/C-N2 precursor, the presence of a reduction peak associated with CoO → Co additionally collaborates the fact that complete reduction of Co derived from Co-tannin complexes cannot be realized in N2. More interestingly, the O/C component of the tannin framework is much easily reduced in Co/C-N2 precursor as compared with Cu/C-N2 precursor, further collaborating the phenomenon of severe weight loss witnessed in Co/C precursor. This suggests a stronger Cu-tannin interaction that protects the O/C components of the tannin framework from decomposing at high-temperature in the H2 atmosphere. Additionally, the introduction of Cu in Co/C-N2 suppresses the reduction temperature of CoO. The Raman spectra of Cu/C, Co/C and CuCo/C catalysts shown in Fig. 3b have two obvious peaks at 1358 cm−1 and 1586 cm−1, ascribed to D and G bands respectively [42]. It is generally believed that the formation of the G band is caused by the breakage of benzene rings of amorphous carbonaceous materials; the D band, on the other hand, originates from disordered or in-plane defective carbon structure within basic structural units [42,43]. Herein, defective carbonaceous structure (D band) is formed during the high-temperature pyrolysis in addition to the aromatic ring structure (G band). The intensity ratio of ID/IG can be used to ascertain the degree of distortion and defect of a well-ordered sp2 planar structure, whereby a lower ID/IG ratio implies fewer defects [44]. The calculated ID/IG ratio for Cu/C, Co/C, and CuCo4/C is 0.818, 0.903 and 0.808 respectively, suggesting an increase in condensed aromatic structure in Cu/C and CuCo4/C initiated by the presence of Cu, which explains why the observed weigh loss (Table S1) is more pronounced in Co/C as compared to Cu/C and CuCo4/C. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the representative bimetallic catalyst - CuCo4/C shown in Fig. 4 shows relatively dark sphere-like particles and greyish base, ascribed to the metal nanoparticles (Cu or Co) and C support respectively. Based on the TEM images of different magnifications, well-dispersed Cu or Co nanoparticles are seen on the carbon support. It is quite difficult to distinguish the Cu nanoparticles from Co since they have similar interplanar spacing and z-contrast intensity. Based on the EDS mapping results in Fig. 5 , however, we believe that Cu and Co nanoparticles exist separately. Also, the particle size of Cu in CuCo4/C is quite bigger than that of Co; this observation is consistent with the XRD results."
8,Screening of bimetallic active centers,"3.2 Screening of bimetallic active centers Before CuCo was adopted as the catalytic active center, other bimetallic catalysts including CuAl, CuZr, ZnCo, FeCo and NiCo were also evaluated. The preparation strategy is discussed in the experimental section. The catalytic performance of these catalysts was investigated for the in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water hydrothermal system. CuCo catalyst (77.3%) showed superior catalytic performance than CuAl (32.8%) and CuZr (23.8%) supported on Al2O3 and ZrO2 carriers respectively (Fig. S3). Upon substituting Cu with Zn, Fe, and Ni in the bimetallic CuCo catalyst, the percentage yield of lauryl alcohol decreased to 3.3% (ZnCo), 0.9% (FeCo) and 31.5% (NiCo) respectively. As seen in Fig. S4, the monometallic CoOx catalyst gave a 43.0% of lauric acid conversion, 24.5% lauryl alcohol, 8.2% undecane and 5.0% dodecane, suggesting the occurrence of side reactions like hydrodeoxygenation and/or decarboxylation. The addition of just 10 wt% Cu boosted the lauric acid conversion from 43.0% to 71.8% with a corresponding increase in the yield of lauryl alcohol (42.2%). Further increase in the Cu weight loading to 20% gave even higher lauric acid conversion (87.5%) and lauryl alcohol selectivity up to 88.3%. In addition, the percentage yields of the byproducts - undecane and dodecane were at a very low level. An additional increase in the Cu weight loading as high as 30 or even 40 wt% resulted in conversion efficiency <20% with a negligible amount in the yield of the deoxygenated byproduct. Overall, the presence of Cu in the catalytic system tends to decrease the yield of the deoxygenated byproduct at first with an increase in conversion of lauric acid which eventually decreases with a significant increase in the weight of Cu."
9,In situ hydrogenation of lauric acid over different catalysts,"3.3 In situ hydrogenation of lauric acid over different catalysts The monometallic Cu/C, Co/C and bimetallic CuCo/C catalysts treated at 500 °C were investigated for in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in methanol-water hydrothermal media. According to our previous study, aqueous phase reforming of methanol (APRM) provides the required hydrogen for fatty acid hydrogenation [26]. To highlight the significance of metallic species on the catalytic performance, the activity of the tannin-derived carbon was evaluated at 330 °C for 3 h with no metal loading. Methyl laurate was observed as the only product with no detection of lauryl alcohol, indicating the inactivity of unloaded tannin-derived carbon towards the in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid. Undecane is observed as the main product (40.2% yield) with a low selectivity to lauryl alcohol over the Co/C catalyst as seen in Fig. 6a. Although Cu/C catalyst exhibited high selectivity to lauryl alcohol, its lauric acid conversion, however, is quite low. The bimetallic CuCo/C catalyst (Cu/Co ratio of 1) on the other hand exhibited both high conversion of lauric acid and selectivity to lauryl alcohol. When fructose was utilized as the sacrificial carbon source, the obtained CuCo/FC catalyst showed low catalytic activity towards lauryl alcohol production. Like the Co/C catalyst, undecane was observed as the main product over the CuCo/FC catalyst, which indicates that tannin is better suited as the sacrificial carbon source than fructose for this application. Calcination temperature plays an important role in the performance of the catalysts as seen in Fig. 6b; 500 °C is screened as the optimized calcination temperature for our catalysts. The lower catalytic activity exhibited by samples treated at 300 and 400 °C is ascribed to the incomplete reduction of Co2+ (H2-TPR), and partial dissolution of the tannin carrier as seen in Fig. S5. The relatively inferior catalytic performance of CuCo/C calcined at 600 and 700 °C is perhaps due to excessive carbonation of the tannin support (Table S1). The product distribution of the bimetallic Cu-Co catalysts with different Cu/Co molar ratios is summarized in Fig. 6c. The lauric acid conversions of Cu4Co/C, Cu2Co/C, CuCo/C, CuCo2/C and CuCo4/C are 17.3%, 41.0%, 41.1%, 52.7% and 62.3% respectively. Cu4Co/C afforded the lowest yield of the deoxygenated byproducts but gave the lowest conversion of lauric acid. By decreasing the Cu/Co ratios in the bimetallic CuCo catalysts, both the lauric acid conversion and lauryl alcohol yield significantly increased with no appreciable increase in the yield of undecane and dodecane. The optimized total addition of Cu and Co is found to be 10 wt% (Cu + Co) − CuCo4/C as seen in Fig. S6. We can conclude from a combined analysis of the catalytic performances of Co/C, Cu/C and CuCo4/C catalysts that the product distribution of hydrogenation process can be controllably tuned by the introduction of Cu into Co/C catalyst. Thereafter, the efficiency of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and isopropanol as hydrogen donors was compared for in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid; the results are presented in Fig. 6d. The obtained lauryl alcohol yield in the methanol-water system is much higher than other alcohol-water systems; this result is consistent with our previous work over Cu/ZrO2 catalyst [26]. The relatively lower hydrogen production rate of ethanol, 1-propanol and isopropanol hydrothermal system is the main reason for the observed low yield of lauryl alcohol."
10,Optimization of reaction conditions over CuCo4/C catalyst and reusability potential,"3.4 Optimization of reaction conditions over CuCo4/C catalyst and reusability potential The effects of process parameters including the mass of methanol, catalyst loading, reaction time and reaction time on the conversion of lauric acid were systematically optimized at 330 °C of reaction temperature. As seen in Fig. 7a, methyl laurate is found as the only product with only 22.4% lauric acid conversion for the uncatalyzed reaction, suggesting that the hydrogenation process can only proceed with an addition of a catalyst. The obtained yields of lauryl alcohol upon addition of 5, 10, 15 and 30 mg of CuCo4/C as a catalyst are 25.1, 44.0, 62.3 and 58.3% respectively. The slight decrease in the yield of lauryl alcohol beyond 15 mg of catalyst loading is attributed to the higher production of undecane and dodecane as a product. A 15.0 mg of the CuCo4/C catalyst was adopted as a good compromise to maintain both high lauric acid conversion and high selectivity to lauryl alcohol production. The significant importance of methanol as the hydrogen-donor was evaluated on in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid by varying the mass concentration of methanol added into the reactor. The result is presented in seen in Fig. 7b. The lauryl alcohol yield mostly increased with the increasing mass of methanol. For the reaction time in Fig. 7c, the lauric acid conversion and yield of lauryl alcohol increases steadily with increasing reaction time between 0.5 h to 3 h, but remains relatively constant with an additional increase up to 4 h. Notably, the yield of lauryl alcohol dramatically decreased from 61.1% to 26.9% upon further increase to 5 h with a corresponding increase in the yields of both undecane and dodecane as byproducts due to side reactions. The occurrence of secondary reactions and a decrease in the conversion of lauric acid is possibly due to the occlusion of the catalyst's active sites by highly concentrated lauryl alcohols. Besides lauric acid, our CuCo4/C catalyst exhibits similar conversion and selectivity to fatty alcohol towards hydrogenation of other long-chain saturated fatty acids like stearic acid as well as unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, as seen in Fig. S7. The reusability potential of a catalyst is of great economic importance from an industrial application standpoint. The reusability potential of our optimized CuCo4/C catalyst was evaluated at 330 °C for 3 h for three usage cycles. The results and the detailed reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 7d. Under similar reaction conditions, the conversion of lauric acid over CuCo4/C catalyst progressively decreased from 79.1% to 69.1% to 62.2% for 1st (fresh CuCo4/C), 2nd and 3rd usage cycles respectively. The corresponding yields of lauryl alcohol also decreased from 62.3% to 51.6% to 47.5% respectively, indicating loss of activity. By comparing the XRD patterns of fresh and used CuCo4/C catalysts (Fig. S8), the emergency of new diffraction peaks ascribed to the hexagonal Co crystal phase is possibly one of the various reasons for the decrease in catalytic activity. Unlike CuCo4/C, the unsupported bimetallic Cu-Co catalyst suffered severe deactivation after the first usage (Fig. S9), highlighting the robustness and catalytic stability of our supported bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst. Considering the harsh hydrothermal condition (330 °C, 3 h), the reusability performance of the CuCo4/C catalyst seems quite promising."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, tannin-based carbon-supported monometallic Cu/C, Co/C and bimetallic CuCo/C catalysts with different Cu/Co ratios were synthesized and evaluated for in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water hydrothermal system. The product distribution over these catalysts can be controllably tuned by varying the weight loading of the metal active sites. Through the synergistic effect induced by Cu-Co interactions, the bimetallic Cu-Co/C catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity than monometallic Cu/C catalyst towards lauric acid conversion, as well as higher selectivity to lauryl alcohol than monometallic Co/C catalyst. Also, the bimetallic CuCo4/C with Cu/Co ratio of 1:4 showed better catalytic performance than other bimetallic catalysts investigated. The CuCo4/C catalyst is composed of metallic Cu, metallic Co, and amorphous carbon, characterized by high surface area (194.5 m2/g) and hierarchical structure. This bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst is subject to some degree of deactivation after multiple usage cycles at 330 °C hydrothermal reaction temperature. Methanol-water aqueous-phase reforming showed a significantly higher percent conversion of lauric acid compared to other alcohols-water hydrothermal systems. With proper optimization of the process parameters, 79% of lauric acid conversion and a 62.3% yield of lauryl alcohol can be realized over the bimetallic CuCo4/C catalyst."
