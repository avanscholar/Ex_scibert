0,Introduction,"SCC are naturally found in fossil fuel, such as diesel, gasoline and kerosene [1]. Some of the sulfur compounds including sulfides, disulfides, thiophene, benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene. Combustion of fuel oil produce SOx, a major pollutant that leads to air pollution and acid rain, which could corrode historical buildings, destroy forests and disrupt marine ecology [2]. Moreover, accumulation of SOx may form sulfate aerosol with a particle diameter of 2.5 μm. These tiny particles can be transported into lungs and lead to lung irritation, causing respiratory disease such as lung cancer [3]. With an expanding number of automobiles due to the rapid growth of economy and population, the percentage of SCC in fuel oil is now becoming environmental and human health concern [4]. Recently, the United State Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has release a new authorization to decrease the sulfur content in gasoline from 30 ppm to 10 ppm by 2017 [5]. Many attempts have been made both by researchers and industries to reduce the sulfur via separation technology. At commercial level, the conventional method to eliminate sulfur in fuel oil, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) has been widely used [1,6,7]. This technique involves utilization of catalyst such as Co-Mo/Al2O3 or Ni-Mo/Al2O3 at extremely high temperature (300 – 340 °C) and pressure (20 – 100 atm of hydrogen gas). The produced hydrogen sulfide can be eliminated from the treated oil and converted into elemental sulfur. Although HDS is an efficient procedure to eliminate sulfur compounds, the drawback comes from the non-feasible operational conditions which may increase capital costs [8]. Moreover, HDS is less effective to separate heterocyclic SCC due to the inefficient adsorption of desired compounds on the catalyst surface [9]. Therefore, the search for an alternative methods to separate sulfur from oil are vital to produce clean fuel. A number of non-conventional desulfurization technologies have been explored, including biodesulfurization (BDS) [10,11], adsorption desulfurization (ADS) [12,13], oxidative desulfurization (ODS) [14,15] and extractive desulfurization (EDS) [16,17] to replace the existing HDS process. In BDS, microorganism is involved in the elimination of SCC. The existence of sulfur atom in the enzyme cofactor and amino acids could assist in the separation of sulfur. Utilization of BDS is efficient for the removal of refractory sulfur under ambient conditions. However, due to the sensitive nature of the microorganism, some by-products from the refinery can give a toxic effect toward microorganism, making it not feasible for deep desulfurization. Another alternate method for desulfurization is ADS, where a support or adsorbent will selectively adsorb the SCC via physical mechanism. Benefits of ADS including no use of hydrogen gas, no H2S gas production and suitable to be implemented at low temperature. The challenges of ADS may came from the poor selectivity of SCC and inefficient adsorption capacity. An inexpensive adsorbent materials with large surface are a necessary to maximize the efficiency of ADS. An emerging technique in desulfurization technology is the EDS. Liquid-liquid extraction is employed where it involves extractant to dissolve the SCC from the oil. The layer containing the sulfur can be separated gravitationally. Common extractants including acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and pyrrolidone. However, these conventional extractants are highly volatile and could give toxicity effect when applying into a large-scale separation. By using an eco-friendly solvent such as IL, a non-toxic and green separation of sulfur could be achieved. EDS itself is not enough to achieve deep desulfurization due to the low affinity of SCC toward extractant. By oxidizing the SCC, a highly polar molecule could be easily extracted into the polar extractant. The ODS will require oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen oxide, ozone, peroxy salts or molecular oxygen before an extraction step is done. An integrated extraction and catalytic-oxidative desulfurization (ECODS) using IL and catalyst could be employed to increase the sulfur removal from oil [18,19]. IL is a kind of molten salt that consists of a cation and anion moiety with negligible vapor pressure and easy to be recycled. The unique structure of the tailor-made IL makes it useful to synthesize based on a specific application. The specialty of IL has made it widely used as catalyst, solvent and electrolyte in oil and gas industry, such as in CO2 transformation into fuels, biomass conversion into chemical platforms and solar and energy storage [9,20,21]. In the past few years, the use of IL as an extractant had been conducted in ECODS to remove sulfur [22]–[25]. Most of the literature reported on imidazolium-based IL as an extractant in desulfurization such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate [26]–[28]. Although usage of IL could yield an excellent performance in the separation process of sulfur compounds, the production of IL is expensive and this is not feasible for an upscaling application [3,29,30]. To counter the issue, selection of low cost IL with ease of preparation is a concern in desulfurization of fuel oil. The new generation IL – deep eutectic solvent (DES) is now becoming of interest in the scientific community as it could offer the same properties with the conventional IL. It uniqueness lies on its low-cost constituents and great biodegradability, making it as a suitable candidate as extractant in the separation industry [31,32]. The structure of DES contains at least one hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) which can interact to one another by hydrogen bonding. Some of the DES does not show a melting point, however a glass transition temperature could be obtained. DES has low-transition temperature and can be prepared with less impurities by just simply mixing the HBA and HBD. The first application of DES was focusing on the enzymatic catalysis [33]. The ability of DES in molecular purification was exploited late in 1995. Since 2004, significant amount of article on DES had been published, especially in electrochemistry, zeolite synthesis and biocatalysis [34]. DES is now widely being tested in separation process such as desulfurization of fuel oil [32,35,36], separation of bioactive compounds [33,37] and carbon dioxide capture [36]. This research is focusing on the DES synthesis of choline chloride and dihydric alcohols for the extraction of SCC in model oil. The physical properties of DES were evaluated including the density, viscosity and melting point. The result will give a new insight on the suitability of dihydric alcohol-based DES as alternative solvent to capture SCC from fuel oil."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemicals used to synthesize DES is shown in Table 1 . Choline chloride act as hydrogen bond acceptor, while 1, 2-ethanediol and 1, 4-butanediol are the hydrogen bond donors. For desulfurization experiment, the SCC used is dibenzothiophene in n-dodecane."
3,DES synthesis,"2.2 DES synthesis Schematic set-up can be referred in Fig. 1 . Due to the hygroscopic nature of choline chloride, the reagent will be pre-treated by drying in vacuum dryer at 80 °C for 6 h before being used in synthesis. The amount of choline chloride and hydrogen bond donors are mixed in a ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. The mixture is heated to 60 °C until a homogenous liquid is formed. The product is cooled to room temperature."
4,Physical properties of DES,2.3 Physical properties of DES SVM 3000 Anton Paar viscometer was used to measure the densities and viscosities of DES. The temperature range was set from 20 to 90 °C with uncertainty of ± 0.02 °C. Precision of viscosity value was ± 0.5% while absolute uncertainty of density was ± 0.0005 g cm−3.
5,Thermal behavior of DES,"2.4 Thermal behavior of DES The determination of melting temperature (Tm) and glass transition (Tg) of synthesized DES was analyzed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), model DSC 1, Mettler Toledo. Temperature and heat flow calibration was made with zinc and indium reference samples. Empty aluminum pan was used as the reference pan Approximately 10 mg of DES was weighed and sealed in aluminium standard sample pan. Analysis was run under nitrogen atmosphere, while the heating rate and cooling rate were 10 K min−1 and 5 K min−1 respectively, with temperature range of 123.15 K to 323.15 K."
6,Desulfurization efficiency,"2.5 Desulfurization efficiency To test the desulfurization ability, batch EDS was utilized where model oil (100 ppm DBT in n-dodecane) and DES were mixed together in a home-made glass reactor. Sample of model oil in the upper layer was taken and analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using UV–vis detector at 310 nm. Zorbax SB-C18 (4.6 × 150 mm) was used as reversed phase column, while mixture of methanol, water and isopropanol (90/8/2 vol% ratio) was used as mobile phase. The flow rate was 1 mL/min with injection volume of 1 μL. A brief schematic procedure can be referred in Fig. 2 . Desulfurization efficiency was calculated based on Equation (1). (1) D e s u l f u r i z a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y % = C i - C f / C i x 100 % where Ci and Cf is the initial and final concentration of DBT respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis of DES,"3.1 Synthesis of DES 2 DES with two different dihydric alcohols as hydrogen bond donors were synthesized with different molar ratios. A summary of physical appearance of the DES is shown in Table 2 . It is shown that the eutectic mixture of 1, 2-ethanediol with choline chloride is easier to form compared to 1, 4-butanediol. The difference of alkyl chain in HBD has an impact on the mixing properties. Shorter carbon length in 1, 2-ethanediol make it easier to move around the solution to solvate the chloride anion. Synthesis pathway of DES is shown in Fig. 3 [38]–[40]. Successful DES is further characterized to determine the densities and viscosities."
9,Physical properties of DES,"3.2 Physical properties of DES The densities of the 5 successful DES are obtained as a function of temperature. The temperature range was set from 20 to 90 °C. The density trend can be seen in Fig. 4 . Based on the graph, the density of all DES decreased linearly with temperature. Density trend was observed as follow: 1:2ED > 1:3ED > 1:4ED > 1:3BD > 1:4BD. As temperature increases, molecular vibrations occur rapidly, making the interactions between ions become weaker. High density of DES was obtained at room temperature as the anions and cations are packed closely. By comparing the difference in alkyl chain, DES with 1, 4-butanediol as HBD possessed a lower density than 1, 2-ethanediol. Increasing the length of alkyl chain in HBD decreases the density of DES, which corresponds to the density formula, where the value of density is inversely proportional to the volume of compound. The density also influenced by the amount of HBD where the higher the HBD, the lower the density. As more carbon chains were being introduced from the HBD, the HBD-HBA hydrogen bonding interaction decreases as well due to steric hindrance [41]. The wrapping of chloride ions by HBD causes packing structure destruction, which provide more active hydrogen for SCC removal [42,43]. Fig. 5 shows the viscosities of 5 DES at different temperatures. The viscosity of each DES was corresponded to 1:4BD > 1:3BD > 1:4ED > 1:3ED > 1:2ED, which was the reversed order compared to their density. As temperature increases, the viscosity value for both DES decreases exponentially. As heat is applied, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, making them easy to collide. By comparing the length of alkyl chain, the viscosity of 1, 2-ethanediol DES is lower than 1, 4-butanediol. Short alkyl chain makes them to move freely, hence decrease the resistivity itself. This is essential especially when considering the fluidity of solvent for industrial application, as it will affect the mass transfer in a separation process. Considering the fuel oil desulfurization, it is preferable to use low viscosity solvent to shorten the time required for SCC separation to reach equilibrium [44]. More heat is required to increase the fluidity of solvent if the viscosity is too high."
10,Thermal behavior of DES,"3.3 Thermal behavior of DES Thermal analysis give an insight on how a substance behave as heat is applied. In term of engineering, heat flow in separation unit is a crucial aspect as it will affect the production yield and economically concern. DSC thermograms for choline chloride: 1, 2-ethanediol and choline chloride: 1, 4-butanediol were shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . Based on Fig. 6, four different mole ratios of ethanediol DES undergo glassy transition state around −120 °C, where apparent melting peak at Tg is caused by DES heating, produces an internal stresses in DES which released via handling, processing or thermal history. At this state, heat causes the rigid molecule state to become flexible enough to move around. Molecular relaxation usually occurs as weak endothermic transition close to the end of a Tg, altering the Tg for a certain degrees. The melting temperature however could not be detected by DSC, hence Tg was referred to describe the heat property of the solvent. In the case of butanediol, the Tg observed were slightly higher than ethanediol. Melting temperatures for each mole ratios of DES were detected from 1 to 7 °C, with 1:2BD possess the lowest melting point (1.57 °C). A significant finding was the depression of the freezing point for synthesized DES, compared to their individual melting points (choline chloride: 302 °C, 1, 4-butanediol: 20.1 °C). This means above the Tm which was now referred to room temperature, the DES was in molten liquid state, which is practically to be used in SCC desulfurization. We expect that the Tm for ethanediol DES was also around the range detected for butanediol DES as their chemical structure were only differ by two carbon atoms. The list of the values derived from the DSC curve can be obtained in Table 3 . The melting points of DES were below the room temperature, suggesting that these DES could be used as alternative solvent for fuel oil desulfurization without further heating process. 1:2ED and 1:3BD were chosen to test the desulfurizing ability by varying different parameters."
11,Desulfurization performance,"3.4 Desulfurization performance The performance of synthesized DES in was conducted by looking on the effect of temperature, effect of alkyl chain, effect of volume ratio of DES to model oil, effect of stirring speed and effect of time. Based on Figs. 8 and 9 , the temperature increased the performance of desulfurization. As temperature increases, the viscosity reduces as well which in return increase the affinity of DES towards DBT. We expect not so much increase in desulfurization percentage beyond 80 °C, therefore 80 °C was set as optimum temperature for further analysis. Referring to Fig. 10 , after 4 h, 1:2ED showed better efficiency (59.42%) compared to 1:3BD (42.41%) which arises from the low viscosity value of 1:2ED. The shorter ethanediol chain also contribute to a high efficiency as the mobility of the alkyl chain increased which make extraction of DBT become easier. The optimization of the volume ratio of model oil to DES was studied to ensure an economical usage of solvent for industrial application. Fig. 11 described the trend of desulfurization performance by varying the ratio from 1:1 to 1:20. It was noticed that the highest amount of desulfurization percentage was 1:1 with 72.16%. When decreased to 1:5, performance decreased to 59.43%. Less solvent decreases the effective collision of solvent and DBT, however the ratio of 1:2 was chosen for further optimization to consider the industrial scale. Next, the stirring speed was examined to identify the best condition for desulfurization. Fig. 12 presented that the desulfurization percentage increased from 100 rpm to 400 rpm, while further increase in stirring speed did not produce a significant increase in terms of performance. This indicated that at 400 rpm, the desulfurization had achieved its equilibrium state (69.05%). Finally, the effect of time can be seen from the graph trend in Fig. 13 . The desulfurization performance increased as we lengthen the time from 1 h (53.33%) to 5 h (60.27%), however the performance showed no changes when reach 6 h. The phenomenon also recorded elsewhere which provide good agreement with the experiment data [3]. Again, this was due to the equilibrium accomplishment where all molecules of DES had extract the DBT from n-dodecane. Based on the parameters study, 1:2ED produced a better desulfurization efficiency than 1:3BD with the optimized conditions."
12,Conclusion,"Dihydric alcohol-based DES could have a potential role as extracting agent desulfurization of fuel oil. The simple synthesis procedure makes it an economical solvent as it does not require expensive starting material. The density and viscosity of DES was studied as it is an important aspect for the dynamic flow of solvent in real separator. 1, 2-ethanediol give lower viscosity compared to 1, 4-butanediol, however in density, 1, 4-butanediol possess lower density. The thermal behaviour of DES was presented from DSC analysis, showing that a huge freezing point depression observed for the synthesized DES, suggesting a good candidate to be used as extractant at room temperature without heat. In terms of desulfurization test, it was noted that 1, 2-ethanediol produce higher desulfurization efficiency 60.27% in optimized conditions (5 h, 400 rpm stirring speed, 1:5 model oil to DES ratio, 80 °C). This provide a new opportunity for dihydric alcohol-based DES to be used as extractor in desulfurization separation unit."
