0,Introduction,"To reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate global warming, hydrogen has been accepted as a promising energy carrier to achieve sustainable energy production in the near future. The production of hydrogen has attracted great interest in the academia and industry [1–3]. For decades, steam reforming of natural gas using nickel as a catalyst has been the most widely used process for the production of hydrogen [4,5]. However, the production of hydrogen by this multistep process results in high emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and the end-products always contain some quantities of carbon monoxide, which prevent the resulting hydrogen from being directly used in fuel cells. Thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane is an alternative method to produce hydrogen without the emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants [6,7]. An important by-product of this process is clean carbon. Thermocatalytic decomposition of methane is an endothermic process and the direct thermal decomposition of methane requires temperatures above 1200°C for complete decomposition of methane into hydrogen and carbon [8]. Thus, for large-scale hydrogen production by TCD of methane, it is necessary to use catalysts to reduce the reaction temperature and to accelerate the kinetics of the process [9]. For decades, transition metals, such as Fe, Co and Ni, and their alloys have been widely studied as catalysts for the TCD of methane due to the good conversion of methane to hydrogen. In industrial production, the regeneration of the deactivated metallic catalysts by burning off or gasifying the deposited carbon would waste the valuable by-product of carbon and produce large amounts of CO2, which nullifies the benefits of TCD [10]. In recent years, carbonaceous catalysts have been used for the TCD of methane because of their availability, durability and low cost [11–21]. The significant advantage in the use of carbonaceous catalysts is to produce hydrogen with high purity which can be directly utilized in fuel cells and other applications. Furthermore, the produced carbon materials can be directly used without any further separation and purification processes. Muradov and co-workers had initiated and made significant contributions in the field of TCD of methane using various carbonaceous catalysts including activated carbons (ACs), carbon blacks (CBs), carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, graphite, glassy carbon, etc. [11,22,23]. Subsequent to Muradov’s seminal work [22], many other articles were published in which ACs [12–15], CBs [24–26], or both [27,28] were widely studied as catalysts for the TCD of methane. For instance, Abbas and Daud [29–31] studied the catalytic performance of palm-shell-based activated carbon for the TCD of methane. It was found that the catalytic activity was closely related to the ordering degree of the carbons. Disordered amorphous carbons were observed to be more active as compared with ordered turbostatic and graphitic carbons. Pinilla et al. [9] and Suelves et al. [32] also conducted extensive studies on the catalytic activities of carbonaceous catalysts for the TCD process. It was reported that the commercial carbon black (BP2000) exhibited the highest carbon yield of 6.13g carbon per gram of catalyst. Moliner et al. [15] investigated the catalytic activities of ACs with different textural properties and surface chemistry. It was found that the surface chemistry and the pore size distribution played a decisive role in the initial conversion rate of methane and the long-term sustainability of the catalyst. Serrano et al. [33,34] and Botas et al. [35,36] investigated the TCD of methane using synthesized ordered mesoporous carbons CMK-5 and CMK-3. The CMK-5 showed outstanding catalytic performance in terms of hydrogen production rate and carbon yield because of its high surface area and bimodal pore structure. A remarkably high carbon yield, 31g carbon per gram of catalyst, was obtained [36]. Shilapuram et al. [37,38] also studied the catalytic performance of CMK-3 and DUT-19. It was confirmed that CMK-3 and DUT-19 carbons showed better catalytic performance for methane decomposition than the commercial carbons. In spite of great efforts made by researchers from the academia and industry, the catalytic performance of carbonaceous catalysts is still very limited since the methane conversions reported were quite low. Furthermore, these catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to the decreasing number of active sites and increasing methane diffusion resistance accompanying carbon deposition. Recently, hierarchical porous carbons have been of great interest for applications in fuel cells, batteries and capacitors because of their large surface areas and unique pore structures [39]. Such structural characteristics render hierarchical porous carbons to be good potential candidates for TCD of methane because of the large number of active sites and low diffusion resistance to the reactants. However, very limited work has been reported on the use of hierarchical carbons as catalysts for methane decomposition [40]. In this work, a new type of hierarchical porous carbon material was synthesized using nanoparticulated bimodal micro-mesoporous silica particles as the template. The resulting carbon exhibited an extremely high surface area, a large pore volume and an interconnected trimodal pore structure. The hierarchical porous carbon was used as a catalyst for the TCD of methane and its catalytic performance was compared with those of two types of commercial carbons."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and Tween 20 were used as the precursor and surfactant for the synthesis of silica template, respectively. Furfuryl alcohol and oxalic acid were used as the carbon source and subsequently further processed as the catalyst for the synthesis of the carbon material. Hydrofluoric acid was used to etch the silica template."
3,Synthesis of silica template,"2.2 Synthesis of silica template The SiO2 template was synthesized using a well-established sol–gel technique [41]. A nontoxic and biodegradable ethoxylated sorbitan ester, namely, Tween 20, was used as the structure-directing agent. The detailed procedures are as follows: 1ml of Tween 20 surfactant was dissolved into 40ml of distilled water. 5ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was then added into the solution. After stirring for 30min, 2.5ml of HCl solution with a concentration of 0.1M was slowly introduced into the mixture in droplets. The mixture was stirred for 2h and then transferred into an oven and aged at 100°C for 24h. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with distilled water. The dried powder was calcined at 550°C for 4h to remove the surfactant."
4,Synthesis of carbon material,"2.3 Synthesis of carbon material The calcined silica powder was dried overnight at 120°C under vacuum and then used as template to prepare the carbon material. The carbon material was synthesized using the nanocasting method [42]. The detailed procedures are as follows: 6.5ml of furfuryl alcohol and 0.13g of oxalic acid were dissolved into 15ml of ethanol. 12ml of the solution was impregnated into 3.5g of template at room temperature. After the polymerization of the initial loading of furfuryl alcohol at 80 and 350°C for 12 and 6h under N2 atmosphere, respectively, the remaining furfuryl alcohol solution was impregnated into the mixture and polymerized under the same conditions. The mixture of template and poly furfuryl alcohol was transferred into a furnace and the temperature was raised to 900°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min, dwelled for 4h and then the furnace temperature was reduced. A nitrogen gas stream with a flow rate of 50ml/min was introduced into the furnace during the carbonization process. After the temperature had cooled down to room temperature, the resulting silica–carbon composite was etched using hydrofluoric acid to remove the silica template."
5,Characterization tests,"2.4 Characterization tests A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JSM2010, JEOL) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-5600LV, JEOL) were used to observe the morphology of the samples. To achieve high definition micrographs, the silica samples were coated with platinum for the FESEM tests. The samples for the transmission electron microscopy tests were prepared by the ultrasonication of the powdered samples in ethanol and the evaporation of one drop of the suspension onto a carbon film supported on a mesh copper grid. Transmission electron microscopy test was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 200kV at room temperature. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using the accelerated and surface area porosimetry system (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics). Before the test, the samples were dried overnight at 200°C in a vacuum oven. The pore surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the mesopore volume and mesopore size were calculated by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method which is based on the desorption branch of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The micropore volume and micropore size were analyzed by the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method."
6,Experimental procedures,"2.5 Experimental procedures The catalytic performance of the resulting carbon materials was carried out in an experimental set-up as reported in our previous work [43–47]. A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown and described in Wang and Lua [47]. In a typical process, 50mg of catalyst was loaded into the center point of a quartz tube reactor which had an internal diameter of 10mm and a length of 800mm. The reactor was placed in an electric furnace (Lenton 2460) which was fitted with a temperature programmed controller (Carbonite 2416). The temperature of the reactor was accurately monitored using a K-type thermocouple. The flow rates of the gases were controlled by mass flowmeters (Alicat Scientific). For each test, the total flow rate of methane and nitrogen (in a ratio of 1:3) was 20ml/min. Before the tests, the system was flushed with nitrogen to remove the air. The concentrations of the outflow gases were analyzed by a calibrated gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890-5973 GC–MS network systems) equipped with a TCD detector. The catalytic performances of the two types of commercial carbon materials, i.e., mesoporous Norit CAP Super carbon (denoted as CAP) and microporous Norit DLC Super 50 carbon (denoted as DLC), were also evaluated for comparison purposes. The catalytic decomposition of methane was carried out at 900°C. During the methane decomposition reaction, the concentrations of the gases at the reactor outlet were monitored by a calibrated gas chromatograph. The methane conversion (χ) was calculated using the following equation: χ = C H 2 C H 2 + 2 C CH 4 where CH2 and CCH4 are the concentrations of hydrogen and methane, respectively, at the outlet of the reactor, as determined by the GC–MS network systems [48,49]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural properties of silica templates,"3.1 Structural properties of silica templates The morphology of the synthesized silica was examined by TEM and FESEM. Fig. 1 A shows the TEM micrograph of the silica. The nanoparticulated silica particles had diameters ranging from 20 to 50nm. The TEM micrograph of the silica particles at a higher magnification (Fig. 1B) shows an external worm-like pore structure with an average pore size of 2nm originating from the supermolecular templating of Tween 20 surfactant. Fig. 1C shows a typical bulky silica aggregate of several micrometers, which consisted of a collection of pseudo-spherical primary silica particles with inter-particle pore sizes in the mesoporous range as shown in Fig. 1D. These large disordered textural pores were produced due to the collision and aggregation of the primary silica nanoparticles during the nucleation and growth process [50]. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the as-synthesized silica template is a mixed type of Type I and Type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop at a relative pressure between 0.45 and 0.8 as shown in Fig. 2 (a), which is due to the capillary condensation of nitrogen inside the intra-particle mesopores. A steep adsorption of nitrogen at the ultra-low pressure is observed in the isotherm, which is attributed to the adsorption of nitrogen in the micropores. Fig. 2(b) and (c) shows the mesopore and micropore distributions of the as-synthesized silica, respectively. The BET surface area and the mesopore size of the silica particles were 725m2/g and 4.0nm, respectively, as shown in Table 1 . The as-synthesized silica template had a significant micropore volume of 0.35cm3/g, which was much greater than that of mesoporous silica materials such as SBA-15 [51]. This could be due to the presence of branched structures arising from the structure-directing agent, i.e., Tween 20, which is amenable toward the penetration of hydrophobic ethylene oxide chains into the silica walls [42]. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), the as-synthesized silica exhibited a bimodal hierarchical pore structure, which could provide a unique template for the synthesis of carbon materials."
9,Physical characteristics of as-synthesized carbon materials,"3.2 Physical characteristics of as-synthesized carbon materials Fig. 3 shows the TEM micrographs of the as-synthesized carbon material. It could be observed that the carbon exhibited a similar morphology as that of the silica template. The nanoparticulated carbon had the same diameters as those of the silica template and the intra-particle pore sizes were of the range of 1–3nm as shown in the TEM micrograph at a higher magnification (Fig. 3(B)). The FESEM of the as-synthesized carbon material and the two commercial carbons are shown in Fig. 4 . The FESEM micrograph of the as-synthesized carbon showed an inter-connected network of pore structures with textural pore sizes ranging from 10 to 20nm. Similarly, these inter-particle pores were formed by the aggregation of carbon nanoparticles. In contrast, the two commercial carbons, i.e., microporous activated carbon (DLC) and mesoporous carbon (CAP) exhibited a more dense structure as shown in Fig. 4. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-synthesized carbon, commercial mesoporous ordered carbon and commercial activated carbon are shown in Fig. 5 (a). The isotherm of the as-synthesized carbon showed three well-defined adsorption phases which is of a mixed type of Type I and Type IV isotherms. The first sharp adsorption rise at the ultra-low relative pressure of less than 0.1 was attributed to the adsorption of nitrogen in the micropores. The second adsorption phase at an intermediate relative pressure, 0.1< P/P 0 <0.4, was attributed to the adsorption of nitrogen in the mesoporous intra-particle and the inter-particle pores. The third phase occurred at a high relative pressure of 0.8 which was due to the capillary condensation of nitrogen in the intra-particle and inter-particle pores. Comparatively, the isotherm of the DLC carbon is a Type I isotherm, which is consistent with its microporous structure. The isotherm of the commercial CAP carbon exhibited a mixed type of Type I and Type IV isotherms. The physical properties of the carbon materials are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized carbon was 2182cm2/g, which was much higher than those of the commercial mesoporous carbon and microporous activated carbon. The BJH pore size and the total pore volume of the as-synthesized carbon were calculated to be 6.2nm and 1.82cm3/g, respectively, which were also higher than those of the commercial carbons. Fig. 5(b) and (c) showed that the pore sizes of the as-synthesized carbon exhibited a wide range of microporous and mesoporous sizes. These pore size distribution curves indicated the presence of micropores of less than 2nm (Fig. 5(c)), intra-mesopores with a peak at 2.3nm (Fig. 5(b)) and inter-mesopores with a peak at 13nm (Fig. 5(b)) for the resulting carbon. This observed trimodal pore structure will possibly improve the catalytic activity of the resulting carbon by providing a large number of active sites and free space for carbon deposition as well as reducing the diffusion resistance of methane molecules [52]. The as-synthesized carbon exhibited a remarkable total pore volume of 1.82cm3/g and particularly the micropore volume was 0.97cm3/g. The high micropore volume of the as-synthesized carbon was attributed to the pyrolysis of the carbon source during the carbonization process and the presence of micropores in the silica template. In contrast to the silica template, the as-synthesized carbon materials exhibited a much broader distribution of micropores, which could be due to the difficulty in controlling the pore size during the pyrolysis of the carbon source. The sharp peak observed in the micropore distribution of the as-synthesized carbon as shown in Fig. 5(c) is possibly due to the templating effects of the silica or the pyrolysis of the carbon source."
10,Catalytic activities of carbon catalysts,"3.3 Catalytic activities of carbon catalysts Fig. 6 shows the catalytic performance of the three types of carbon materials in terms of methane conversion and the quantity of hydrogen produced. The initial methane conversion of the as-synthesized carbon was 52%, which was higher than those of 19% and 40% for the microporous DLC and mesoporous CAP, respectively. This higher conversion was attributed to the higher BET surface area and the larger pore size of the as-synthesized carbon than the other two commercial carbons, thereby providing more active sites for the decomposition action. The microporous DLC had the lowest initial conversion. This poorer performance could be due to its micropores which prevented the efficient adsorption and subsequent dissociation of methane on the active sites. The mesoporous CAP carbon yielded an initial conversion of 40% but it quickly declined due to the blockage of the pores by the deposited carbon. After 350min, the conversion of the mesoporous CAP carbon was similar to that of the microporous DLC carbon. The as-synthesized carbon, on the contrary, exhibited much better resistance to deactivation, resulting in a conversion of 23% after 350min. This better resistance to deactivation of the as-synthesized carbon could be surmised from the fact that it exhibited a unique hierarchical trimodal interconnected pore structure with large pore volume and surface area, which provided low resistance to methane diffusion and possessed abundant active sites and porosities for the deposition of carbon. The as-synthesized carbon produced a hydrogen yield of 1.13mol per g of carbon catalyst, which was much higher than those of 0.38 and 0.54mol per g of catalyst for the microporous DLC and mesoporous CAP, respectively. Under similar conditions, the CMK-3 carbon obtained using SBA-15 as template produced a hydrogen yield of 0.78mol per g of carbon catalyst [53], which was also lower than that of the as-synthesized carbon in this study. Hence, for the heterogeneous thermocatalytic decomposition of methane, the catalytic activity of the carbon catalysts is strongly dependent on the quantity of active sites, the volume of space for the accumulation of the deposited carbon and the effectiveness in the transport of the reactants. The pore morphology, such as the pore size and pore size distribution, plays a critical role on the catalytic reaction. Certainly, the presence of micropores will contribute to a high pore surface area with a high density of active sites while the presence of the smaller mesopores in the as-synthesized carbon is equally important as these intra-mesopores provide extra pore volume for the accumulation of the carbon. Furthermore, the presence of the bigger inter-mesopores in the as-synthesized carbon would serve as a highway to achieve a fast accessibility of methane molecules to the intra-mesopores and micropores [52]. These roles can be implicitly observed from the experimental results for the three types of carbons used in this study for identical experimental conditions. The commercial Norit DLC Super 50 carbon, which is predominantly microporous, and the commercial Norit CAP Super carbon, which is predominantly mesoporous, produced initial reaction rates of 0.42 and 0.89mmol of hydrogen/min per g of catalyst respectively whereas the trimodal microporous-mesoporous as-synthesized carbon produced initial reaction rate of 1.16mmol of hydrogen/min per g of catalyst (Table 2 ). The initial reaction rate of the as-synthesized carbon was 2.76 and 1.30 times greater than those of the DLC and CAP carbons respectively. Hence, these experimental results showed that the as-synthesized porous carbon with interconnected trimodal pore structure of micropores, intra-mesopores and inter-mesopores produced better catalytic activity than the commercial carbons with narrow pore size distributions of micropores or mesopores. The carbon yields and initial reaction rates of the carbonaceous catalysts in the literature were compared with the as-synthesized carbon catalyst prepared in this study, as shown in Table 2. The as-synthesized carbon catalyst produced the highest carbon yield amongst all the various types of catalysts, which was 6.78g of carbon per g of catalyst in this study. The morphology of the spent catalysts was also examined by TEM as shown in Fig. 7 . For good comparison, the TEM micrographs of the pristine catalysts were also included. Pristine ACs showed clear contours of thin carbon layers while the deposited carbons had whisker-like carbon crystallites in the spent catalysts. Besides filling the pores of the carbon catalysts, these carbon crystallites grew outside and around the catalyst particles as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 7. In contrast to the short carbon whiskers in the spent DLC catalyst, longer and denser carbon whiskers originated from the CAP and the as-synthesized carbon catalysts. This was consistent with the catalytic results that the micro-mesoporous carbons showed much higher carbon yields."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a new type of nanoparticulated bimodal micro-mesoporous silica was successfully synthesized using a nontoxic, biodegradable surfactant. The carbon replica of the resulting silica was prepared using a nanocasting method [42]. The as-synthesized carbon possessed a hierarchical trimodal pore structure with a BET surface area and pore volume of 2182m2/g and 1.82cm3/g, respectively. The catalytic performance of the carbon material for the methane decomposition was characterized in terms of methane conversion and hydrogen yield. When compared with the commercial mesoporous CAP carbon and microporous DLC carbon, as well as some of the carbon catalysts reported in the literature [15,17,18,28,53], the as-synthesized carbon in this study showed much higher initial methane conversion and better resistance to deactivation. The superior catalytic activity of the as-synthesized carbon was attributed to the hierarchical trimodal pore structure, in which the intra-mesopores and micropores in the carbon catalyst provided large abundant active sites and free spaces for carbon deposition while the inter-mesopores served as a highway for the transport of methane molecules. The synergistic effects of the trimodal pores in the as-synthesized carbon resulted in the high initial reaction rate and hydrogen yield. It was found that the produced carbon deposits in the catalysts showed a whisker-like morphology. This work suggests that the physical characteristics of carbon catalysts, particularly, the surface area, the pore size distribution and the pore volume play a crucial role on the catalytic activity of the methane decomposition reaction. It has demonstrated that the preparation of carbon catalysts with multimodal pore size distributions is important and necessary for the enhancement of the catalytic decomposition of methane. The beneficial catalytic effects and results of the multimodal pore size distributions can be extended to other heterogeneous catalytic processes such as benzene oxidation [54] and dehydrogenation [55]. Due to the significance of the physical characteristics of the as-synthesized carbon in this work, the applications of trimodal porous carbon material can be extended to advanced adsorbents and catalyst supports."
