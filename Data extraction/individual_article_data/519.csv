0,Introduction,"In the last decades, environmentally friendly tri and tetra-coordinate boron compounds and related different boronate derivatives have found a wide range of application fields in synthetic chemistry, chemical industry, materials science, energy research, pharmacology, cytotoxicity and bioimaging cells, catalysis and other application areas [1–5]. In addition, highly Lewis acidic organoboron compounds continue to attract tremendous interest and current applications range from Lewis acid catalysis of organic transformations and polymerization reactions to small molecule activation, sensors for anions, and the development of new and unusual electronic materials [6]. Besides, significant advances for developing a wide range of new chiral catalysts and improvement studies toward high enantioselectivity and practicability of boron-based catalytic transfer hydrogenation of various ketones have been accomplished [7–10]. In light of those researches, the development of an effective and new a stable metal-free catalysts for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones is one of the main aim for the many scientists due to the expensive and causing environmental pollution of metal-based homogeneous catalysts [10–12]. Therefore, the production of the high-value alcohols through the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various ketones was the factor for which the research of the effective, robust, cheap, easy-to-handle, air-stable and different structure catalyst has been continued. The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl functionalities in the presence of isoPrOH as a hydrogen source is one of the most important chemical transformations to precious alcohols. The transfer hydrogenation process, which involves hydrogen transfer from a donor to an acceptor, has become one of the most important synthetic routes for producing highly active and enantioselective alcohols from different ketones [13]. Symmetric or asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is the addition of hydrogen to an unsaturated molecule using a reagent other than hydrogen gas. Although the direct hydrogenation of aromatic ketones is more widely applied, transfer hydrogenation is an attractive alternative [14–16]. Numerous various catalysts were developed for transfer hydrogenation of various aromatic ketones to high-value alcohols, which includes homogeneous metal complexes [17,18], metal-free homogeneous organocatalysts such as boron, phosphorus and chiral auxiliaries [10,19–21], and apart from transition metal complexes and metal-free organocatalysts, zeolites, oxides of cerium and metal-organic frameworks have also been used for transfer hydrogenation [22,23]. To the best of our knowledge, the literature demonstrates that the use of boronate complexes for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of various ketones to high-value alcohols is very rare. However, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation is also an operationally simple method to synthesize highly enantioselective chiral alcohols with the use of hydrogen donors in the presence of new chiral boronate catalysts. Recently, our research group reported the synthesis and catalytic properties of a series of novel salen/salan boron compounds because the salicylaldimine boron complexes have gained increasing interest. In this work, we describe the synthesis and spectroscopic properties of new chiral salen ligands and their metal-free one-pot synthesis of four-coordinate chiral boronate complexes using boronic acids and chiral salen ligands. Then, these chiral boronate complexes were investigated as catalysts for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives under suitable conditions. The probable structures of all the newly synthesized compounds were assigned by the FT-IR, UV–Vis, NMR (1H, 13C, and 11B) spectroscopy, LC-MS, melting point analysis, and elemental analysis techniques. The obtained spectroscopic results of all newly chiral salen ligands and their chiral boronate complexes are consistent with proposed structure."
1,Experimental section,
2,General considerations,"2.1 General considerations All organic solvents and starting materials used for the synthesis of the novel chiral salen ligands and their boronate complexes were purchased from Aldrich Inc. or Fluka Inc. and used without further purification. All reactions requiring a dry atmosphere were performed under an argon (Ar) gas atmosphere in standard Schlenk techniques. FT-IR spectra were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Two UATR-FT spectrophotometer in the range of 4000 to 400 cm−1 at 25 °C equipped with ATR accessory. 1H, 13C and 11B NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies or a Bruker Avance instrument (1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 100 MHz and 11B: 192.5 MHz) in DMSO‑d 6 with TMS as internal standard. All the NMR spectra were measured at 298 K unless otherwise mentioned. Chemical shifts are reported in delta (δ) units in ppm downfield from TMS, and J values are given in Hertz. Elemental analyses measurements of the novel ligands and their boronate complexes were carried out on a LECO CHNS 932 model elemental analyzer. Mass spectra were determined with an Agilent LC-MS spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). UV–Vis spectra were determined using a Perkin-Elmer model Lambda 25 spectrometer in the scan range of 200–1100 nm using quartz cuvettes at room temperature and studied in EtOH. Melting points were determined using an Electrothermal 9100 and uncorrected. GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu 2010 Plus Gas Chromatograph equipped with a capillary column (5% biphenyl, 95% dimethylsiloxane) (30 m × 0.32 mm x 0.25 μm). The GC parameters for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones were as follows: initial temperature, 110 °C; initial time, 1 min; solvent delay, 4.48 min; temperature ramp 80 °C/min; final temperature, 200 °C; final time, 21.13 min; injector port temperature, 200 °C; detector temperature, 200 °C, injection volume, 2.0 μL. The key starting material 5-chloromethyl salicylaldehyde was synthesized according to literature procedures [24,25]."
3,Synthesis of chiral ligand (L1H2),"2.2 Synthesis of chiral ligand (L1H2) Firstly, a solution of 5-chloromethyl salicylaldehyde (3.30 g, 19.2 mmol) and NaN3 (1.25 g, 19.2 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was heated at 100 °C during overnight stirring vigorously (Scheme 1 ). When TLC analysis showed complete consumption of the starting material the reaction was cooled to room temperature and then the crude product was added to the water and the target product was extracted into the chloroform (3 × 100 mL). Organic phase dried over Na2SO4, evaporated and residue was used without further purification, affording dark red crystals of the product [26]. After 5-azidomethyl salicylaldehyde was synthesized, a mixture of 5-azidomethyl salicylaldehyde (2.0 g, 11.30 mmol) and (R)-(−)-2-amino-1-butanol (1.0 g, 11.30 mmol) were placed into a two-necked-flask, equipped with an argon (Ar) connection in ethanol (40 mL), which was stirred and refluxed for 6 h, in the presence of two drop formic acid as catalyst. After this time, the mixture was allowed to cool to 25 °C. All solvent was removed and the solid was washed three times with diethyl ether and n-hexane, successively, and dried under vacuum. Finally, re-crystallization from CH3Cl/C2H5OH by slow evaporation afforded pure chiral salen ligand (L 1 H 2 ), successfully.

7,General procedure for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"2.6 General procedure for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones Typical procedure for the catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction: a solution of chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes (0.01 mmol), NaOH (0.05 mmol) and the corresponding ketone (1.00 mmol) in degassed 2-propanol (10 mL) was refluxed until the reaction was completed. Followed by a sample of the reaction mixture was taken off, diluted with acetone and analysed immediately by GC. Conversion rates were calculated based on unreacted ketone."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization Schemes 1 and 2 shows the synthetic path and structures of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes. Firstly, the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) ligand was synthesized in 81% yield via the straightforward condensation of 5-azidomethyl salicylaldehyde and (R)-(−)-2-amino-1-butanol in ethanol, which was stirred and refluxed for 6 h in the presence of two drop formic acid as catalyst (Scheme 1). Then, 1, 2, 3-triazole-containing a chiral ligand (L 2 H 2 ) was synthesized from the azido-functionalized ligand (L 1 H 2 ) via click chemistry approach in 78% yield in the presence of propargyl alcohol, CuSO4 and freshly prepared sodium ascorbate (Scheme 1). Finally, as shown in Scheme 2, the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands was reacted with various boronic acid (ferrocene boronic acid, butylboronic acid, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl boronic acid or phenylboronic acid) in refluxing toluene in a 1:1 M ratio to create targeted tetra-coordinated chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes in the range 76–68% yield, respectively. The proposed structures of chiral salen ligands with their boronate complexes were confirmed by spectroscopic and analytical techniques such as NMR (1H, 13C, and 11B), FT-IR, UV–Vis, LC-MS spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The spectroscopic results of the salen ligands and their boronate complexes are consistent with proposed structure. Moreover, the elemental compositions of the chiral salen-based ligands (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes were determined and the results confirmed the formation of the desired products."
10,Spectroscopic studies,"3.2 Spectroscopic studies FT-IR spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure of the synthesized two chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes. These chiral salen ligands and corresponding chiral boronate complexes exhibited many prominent infrared peaks and the obtained results are given in the experimental part. The most important characteristic FT-IR peaks of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands were in the range 3520–2348 cm−1, which are ascribed to intermolecular H-bond υ(OH … ∙NCH) stretching, which disappeared in the FT-IR spectra of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes due to the deprotonation of the OH group, as expected [29,30]. While another important FT-IR peak of free salen ligands are found in the range 1658–1637 cm−1, corresponding stretching vibrations of the chiral boronate complexes are found in the region of 1637–1624 cm−1 towards lower wavenumber as compared to that of the free ligands [31]. These two results indicates the coordination of imine group to boron center through the nitrogen atom with phenolic oxygen and confirm the formation of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes. In the FT-IR spectra of the azido-functionalized chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) ligand and its chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] complexes, characteristic stretching peak of the azido groups were observed in the range 2114–2103 cm−1 as very strong peaks owing to the transformation of chlorine to an azido group in these compounds [26–28,32]. This band was disappeared in the FT-IR spectra of the chiral salen (L 2 H 2 ) ligand and its chiral boronate [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes because of the click reaction between the azido-functionalized compounds with propargyl alcohol and the presence of different new peaks in the final FT-IR spectra of triazole-containing compounds. In addition, in the FT-IR spectrum of each chiral boronate complexes were observed new characteristic peaks in the range 1123–1112 cm−1 and 897-891 cm−1 for [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and 1164-1158 cm−1 and 897-890 cm−1 for [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes indicative of the presence of υ(BO) and υ(BC) bonds, respectively, thus corroborating the coordination of the chiral salen ligands to the boron center of boronate complexes [33–36]. For the full characterization of the new chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, the 1H, 13C, and 11B NMR spectroscopy have been used. The 1H NMR spectra results were in good agreement with the proposed structures in DMSO‑d 6 and all chemical shifts were in the expected ranges (Fig. 1 and S1-S8) The absence of the signal was attributed to the D-exchangeable phenolic-O H resonance in the 1H NMR spectra of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, which is present at 13.42 and 13.30 ppm as singlet in the spectra of free chiral salen ligands, indicating the successful formation of boronate complexes and the deprotonation of the O H group during complexation [37–39]. The compared with the 1H NMR spectra of chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, the chemical shift of the azomethine (C H N) protons appears at 8.37–8.42 ppm for ligands and 8.83–8.03 ppm for boronate complexes [4,40]. These results clearly indicates the coordination of azomethine nitrogen atom to boron center and provides further evidence for successfully boronate complexation. Another decisive event, the appearance of new signals at aromatic region and presence of two new shielded signals at 5.69–5.28 and 4.68–3.94 ppm for (L 2 H 2 ) ligand and chiral boronate [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes as singlet signals corresponding to the CH2 O H and the C H 2 OH protons of 1,2,3-triazole group, respectively in their 1H NMR spectra. Also, these results obviously indicates the success of the click cyclization reaction and the formation of the 1, 2, 3-triazole-containing compounds [41]. In addition, the 1H NMR chemical shift values of the other aromatic and aliphatic groups have been supported the formation of all compounds in DMSO‑d 6, which gave suitable signals that are in good agreement with the proposed structures. This indicates the coordination of atom to boron center through azomethine nitrogen atom, phenolic oxygen, and deprotonation of the O H group on the other side of ligands, as expected. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectra results can be analysed in an analogous manner to that of the proton spectra and the chemical shift of 13C NMR resonances supports the formation of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes. The signals for the azomethine group carbon (H C N) was observed in the range 165.42–162.38 ppm for boronate complexes with a low-field shift in its position as compared to that of the salen chiral ligands, which provides further evidence for the formation of the chiral boronate compounds. Besides, the appearance of new signals at δ = 148.30–142.28 ppm, at δ = 129.41–122.47 ppm, and at δ = 55.76–52.15 ppm corresponding to the triazole- C H, triazole- C CH2 OH, and triazole- C H2 OH carbons of 1,2,3-triazole group, respectively for the chiral salen (L 2 H 2 ) ligand and its chiral boronate [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes in their 13C NMR spectra obviously shows the success of the click cyclization reaction and the formation of the 1,2,3-triazole-containing (L 2 H 2 ) and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] compounds [28,41]. Also, the chemical shift of aromatic (Ar C H) and other group carbons were in the expected range, which support the formation of the proposed structures (Fig. 2 and S1-S8). Additionally, in order to demonstrate the formation of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, spectroscopic analysis of the 11B NMR data was also performed (Figs. 3 and 4 and S9-S13). The 11B NMR spectroscopic results are of special interest because the chemical shift of the 11B NMR spectroscopic signal gives a strong indication of whether or not the boronate compounds is trigonal planar or tetrahedral [42,43]. In the 11B NMR spectra of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, the characteristic boron signals located in the range δ = 32.44–20.42 ppm as broad singlets due to the similar chemical environment for the boron center of each boronate complexes [44–46], which confirms the formation of tetra-coordinate boronate compounds. However, these values suggest that tetra-coordinated boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes exist predominantly as monomers in solution. To understand the electronic transitions of our compounds, we studied the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and the corresponding chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes under the same conditions for comparison (Figs. S20–23). The UV–vis results of the chiral salen ligands and their boronate complexes show very similar features in EtOH at room temperature, probably the electronic effects resulting upon coordination of the boron atom and the planarization of the π-conjugated salen ligands entail a narrowing of the energy gap between the ground state and the first singlet excited state [47]. Another reason for the showing similar absorption bands in ethanol, probably it was dependent on the electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing group at different positions in the ligand groups or the boronate complexes. The electronic spectrum of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands exhibits an absorption band at range 382–231 nm, while the corresponding chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] complexes at range 370–234 nm and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes at range 384–243 nm, respectively. These absorption bands can be assigned to π → π* transitions or the n→π* transition of non-bonded electrons of the phenolic chromophores and azomethine (CHN) unit in the structure of all the compounds [48]. Further confirmation of the formation of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and the corresponding chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes was also provided by LC-MS (Figs. 5–8 and S14-S19). The LC-MS spectra indicated the formation of a variety of fragments during the course of its decomposition and the existence of [M]+ or [M+H]+ peaks, with the base peak were in the proposed nature of the compounds. The LC-MS mass peaks showed the expected molecular and fragmentation ions, with appropriate isotope distribution. As seen in Figs. 5 and 6 the molecular ion peak for the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands were observed at m/z = 249.3 amu for [M+H]+ and 184.0 amu for [M+H]+ consecutively, whereas those of the chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes were observed at m/z = 442.2 amu for [M]+, 315.2 amu for [M+H]+, 471.2 amu for [M+H]+, 335.2 amu for [M+H]+, 499.2 amu for [M+H]+, 371.2 amu for [M+H]+, 526.2 amu for [M]+, and 391.2 amu for [M+H]+ [1,4,49] (Figs. 7 and 8 and S14-S19). In light of those LC-MS data, the existence of the molecular ion and other peaks confirms the formation of the chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and the corresponding chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes."
11,Catalytic performances of boron complexes,"3.3 Catalytic performances of boron complexes In a preliminary study, the chiral compounds, [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] have been examined as catalyst precursors for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone under variable conditions. A typical procedure using acetophenone as substrate was as follows: 0.01 mmol of the complex and 1.00 mmol of acetophenone were added to a solution of NaOH in 2-propanol (0.05 mmol of NaOH in 10 mL 2-propanol) and refluxed at 82 °C, while the reaction was watched by GC (Figs. S24-S27). In all reactions, these compounds catalyzed the reduction of ketones to the corresponding alcohols via hydrogen transfer from 2-propanol. A comparison of chiral boronate complexes [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] as precatalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of acetophenone by 2-propanol is given in Table 1 . All Catalytic experiments were completed under inert (Ar) atmosphere using typical Schlenk-line methods. These systems catalyzed the reduction of acetophenone to corresponding alcohol ((S)-, (R)-1-phenylethanol) in the existence of NaOH. Transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone occurred very slowly at room temperature [50], with low conversions (up to 30%, 48 h) and low to moderate enantioselectivities (up to 52% ee) in the reactions (Table 1, entries 1–8). Because of the reversibility at room temperature (rt), the prolonging the reaction time (96 h) led to a slight reducing of enantioselectivity, as indicated by the catalytic results collected with chiral catalyst, [L 2 B 1 ] (entry 5, [b]) [51,52]. Moreover, as can be inferred from Table 1 (entry 9), the existence of base is essential to detect appreciable conversions [53–56]. Furthermore, the select of base, such as KOH and NaOH, had little influence on the conversion and enantioselectivity (Table 1, entry 14, [e] ) and with a catalyst/NaOH ratio of 1/5, the boronate complexes are very active leading to a quantifiable transformation of acetophenone (Table 1, entries 18–21, [f] ). Reduction of acetophenone into (S)- or (R)-1-phenylethanol could be reached in high yield by increasing the temperature up to 82 °C (Table 1, entries 10–17). Moreover, the conversions gradually declined with increasing the mole ratios of [acetophenone]/[Cat.] from 250/1 to 500/1 or 1000/1, although the enantioselectivities were still high (up to 56% ee, Table 1, entries 22–24). These outcomes clearly indicate that the structural variance of the ligands is a critical factor for catalytic activity and it is noteworthy that the catalytic systems, chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] catalysts show the differences in reactivity. It has also been shown that the catalytic activities in the studied hydrogen transfer reactions were mostly much higher for chiral boronate [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes than those for the [L 1 (B 1-4 )] complexes (Table 1, entries 10–17). Furthermore, it was seen that when ligands incorporate ferrocene moiety, the catalytic activity is low, but the % enantioselectivities is high compared to the other boronate complexes (Table 1, entries 10 and 14). So, from the outcomes, one can easily say that chiral boronate [L 1 B 1 ] and [L 2 B 1 ] complexes were effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of acetophenone. Particularly, chiral boronate [L 2 B 1 ] complex afforded good ee % in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophonone (up to 61% ee). As shown in Table 1, these results have also presented that enantiomeric purity of the product can be affected by electronic issues as well as steric factors of the substituents on the ligands. In order to explore the request range of the boron-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation, acetophenone derivatives were subjected to asymmetric reduction using the conditions optimized for acetophenone. Table 2 demonstrates conversions of the reduction performed in a 0.1 M of isoPrOH solution containing chiral boronate [L 1 B 1 ] or [L 2 B 1 ] catalysts and sodium hydroxide (Ketone/Cat./NaOH = 100/1/5). The outcomes obviously exhibit that a range of acetophenone derivatives can be hydrogenated with low and good enantioselectivities. Substitution of the phenyl ring of the acetophenone substrate led to a clear decrease or increase in the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. That's to say, electronic properties (the nature and position) of the substituents on the phenyl ring of the corbonil compound caused the important changes in the reduction rate. It is eminent that the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to the aryl ring of the ketone decreases the electron density of the CO bond so that the activity was enriched resulting in easier hydrogenation (Table 2, entries 1–14) [57,58]. Therefore, the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents resulted in improved activity with good ee % (Table 2, entries 1–8) [59,60]. The introduction of an electron-donating group such as CH3 or OCH3 group decelerates the reaction degree with various enantioselectivities, whatever the location of substitution (Table 2, entries 9–14). Additionally, it can be seen in Table 2, ortho-substituted acetophenones can dramatically increase ee %, while meta- and para-substitution to acetophenones have detrimental effect [61,62]. The investigation of the results indicates obviously that with each of the tested complexes, the highest enantioselectivity was found for o-methoxyacetophenone (78% ee) when chiral boronate [L 2 B 1 ] complex was used as the catalyst. It is well-known that transition-metal-catalyzed hydrogen transfer involves metal hydrides as key intermediates. All boron complexes, most likely follow the well-established mechanism via a boron alkoxide intermediate and β-elimination [63–65]. The importance of this study is that the use of inexpensive boron instead of expensive Ruthenium, Rhodium and Iridium. These higher catalytic activities can be explained by the nature of the ligands which can generate an open coordination site at boron more easily. It thus appears that the nature of the ligands can also play a crucial role in the transfer hdrogenation reactions. These results indicate the catalysts possibly can stabilize a catalytic transition state."
12,Conclusion,"In this study, we synthesize two new azido and 1, 2, 3-triazole group-based chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes, starting from commercially available reagents. The obtained two chiral salen (L 1 H 2 ) and (L 2 H 2 ) ligands and their chiral boronate [L 1 (B 1-4 )] and [L 2 (B 1-4 )] complexes were characterized by the FT-IR, UV–Vis, NMR (1H, 13C, and 11B), LC-MS, and elemental analysis techniques. The chiral boronate complexes were also used as catalyst for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of acetophenone derivatives under suitable conditions. The catalytic results show that the chiral boronate complexes are good catalyst precursor. Especially, it was showed that the ferrocene-based chiral [L 1 B 1 ] and [L 2 B 1 ] boronate compounds can afford an efficient catalytic conversion compared to the other boronate complexes in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation catalytic studies. Among them, chiral boronate [L 2 B 1 ] complex afforded good enantioselectivities in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophonone. Furthermore, the catalytic results have presented that enantiomeric purity of the product can be affected by electronic features as well as steric features of the substituents on the chiral ligands."
