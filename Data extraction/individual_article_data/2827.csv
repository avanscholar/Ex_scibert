0,Introduction,"A fermentative hydrogen production process which utilizes strict/facultative anaerobes is prospective and advantageous due to its higher evolution rate of hydrogen than that by photosynthetic methods as well as no inhibitory effect of oxygen on Fe-hydrogenase under anoxic or anaerobic condition (Nath and Das, 2004; Tanisho and Ishiwata, 1994). These anaerobes can produce hydrogen all day long without light and can use various kinds of substrates such as refuse and food waste products (Nandi and Sengupta, 1998). Until recently, clostridia and enteric bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum and Enterobacter aerogenes have been known to be strong and efficient producers of hydrogen (Nath and Das, 2004; Tanisho et al., 1987). Especially, E. aerogenes, which is representative of facultative anaerobes, can rapidly consume oxygen and recover the activity of Fe-hydrogenase under anoxic condition in contrast to strict anaerobes which are so sensitive to oxygen inhibition. Hence, the facultative anaerobe does not require any devices for degassing the feed in continuous hydrogen production process (Yokoi et al., 1995). However, the major bottleneck of fermentative hydrogen production process stems from its lower achievable yield compared to photosynthetic route (Nath and Das, 2004). Moreover, the yield appears too low to be economically attractive as a viable alternative to the existing chemical or electrochemical processes. It was reported that the utilization of substrate as an energy source for bacterial growth as well as the oxidation of NADH (reducing equivalent) by the conversion of pyruvate to alcohol (ethanol, butanol) and reduced acids (lactate) were the main reasons for obtaining lower yields than the theoretical value (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006; Nath and Das, 2004). Microorganisms are known to change their metabolic pathway according to metabolites concentrations (Nath and Das, 2004). The metabolites are greatly influenced by many factors such as pH, temperature and nutritional requirements (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Levin et al., 2004). The optimization of nutritional and environmental conditions plays an important role in developing bioprocesses and improving their performance (Kumar and Satyanarayana, 2007). However, a conventional ‘change-one-factor-at-a-time’ method is time-consuming and often leads to confusion in understanding the process parameters. This method is incapable of reaching the true optimum due to neglecting of the interaction among variables. On the contrary, an experimental design based on the statistical modeling is useful to evaluate the relationship between a set of controllable experimental factors and observed responses, and is a time saving method requiring fewer numbers of experiments (Annadurai et al., 1999). In other studies using E. aerogenes, several parameters such as temperature, pH and formate concentration were optimized with respect to hydrogen production rate (Fabiano and Perego, 2002; Kurokawa and Tanisho, 2005; Nakashimada et al., 2002; Tanisho et al., 1987, 1989). However, little is known about the interactive effects of initial substrate concentration, temperature and pH on hydrogen production rate by E. aerogenes. The objective of this work is to optimize the fermentation variables for enhanced hydrogen production rate by using statistical approaches."
1,Methods,
2,Microorganism and pre-cultivation,"2.1 Microorganism and pre-cultivation Facultative anaerobe E. aerogenes, ATCC 29007, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Pure culture of the cells was maintained on nutrient agar slants at 4°C and sub-cultured monthly. The cells were then incubated aerobically at 37°C on a shaker rotated at 150rpm and harvested at the stationary phase. The pre-culture medium was composed as follows (gl−1): K2HPO4, 14; KH2PO4, 6; (NH4)2SO4, 2; trisodium citrate dehydrate, 1; MgSO4, 0.2; glucose, 15; peptone, 5 (Tanisho et al., 1998)."
3,Media preparation,"2.2 Media preparation All experiments were performed in 160ml Wheaton serum bottles with 100ml medium. The media used for hydrogen production were the same with that used for inoculum preparation except glucose concentration. The pure cells harvested from pre-cultivation were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being used as inoculum. Experiments were carried out with the cells of 0.128g dry weight per liter and a 5ml of a thick suspension of the seed obtained by aseptic centrifugation was inoculated to the sterilized medium. The initial pH of medium was adjusted using 5N HCl and/or 5N NaOH solution(s). These serum bottles were immediately air-sealed with butyl rubber stopper and tied with aluminum seal cap. They were then flushed with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen in the headspace of the bottles and to ensure anaerobic condition. The bottles were operated in an orbital shaker with a rotation speed of 150rpm to provide better contact among substrates. At each 2h interval, the total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using syringe."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatography (model 6890N, Agilent Inc.), as previously described (Jo et al., 2006). Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced, at each time (2h) interval as the following equation based on mass balance: (1) V = V 0 γ i + ∑ V i γ i where V is the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i); V 0 is the volume of headspace of serum bottles; V i is the biogas volume discharged from the serum bottles at the time interval (i); γ i is the fraction of hydrogen gas discharged from the serum bottles at the time interval (i). Dry weight of cell was determined by centrifuging the culture broths (3000g, 10min), washing twice with distilled water and then filtering the broth with 0.45μm membrane filters. The filters were dried in a oven at 105°C, until no weight change between consecutive measurements was observed."
5,Optimization study,"2.4 Optimization study 3 K factorial Box–Behnken model was used as the experimental design model to optimize the key process parameters for enhanced hydrogen production in this study. For three factors, the Box–Behnken design offers some advantages in requiring a fewer number of runs and is rotatable if the variance of the predicted response at any point x depends only on the distance of x from the design center point (Box and Behnken, 1960). The 3 K factorial design also allows efficient estimation of second-degree quadratic polynomial and obtains the combination of values that optimizes the response within the region of the three-dimensional observation space (Annadurai et al., 1999). In developing the regression equation, the relation between the coded values and actual values are described according to the equation: (2) x i = ( X i - X i ∗ ) / Δ X i where x i is the coded value of the ith independent variable, X i is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable, X i ∗ is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable at the center point and ΔX i is the step change value. The levels of the variables and the experimental design are shown in Table 1 . Hydrogen production rate was associated with simultaneous changes in glucose (27.78, 83.34, 138.89mM), temperature (33, 38, 43°C) and pH (4.5, 5.5, 6.5) of the culture medium. A total of fifteen experimental runs decided by 3 K Box–Behnken design were carried out, and the center point was replicated three times to estimate the experimental errors. For predicting the optimal condition, the quadratic polynomial equation was fitted to correlate relationship between variables and response (i.e., hydrogen production rate) and estimated as the following equation: (3) Y = α 0 + ∑ i = 1 3 α i X i + ∑ i = 1 3 α ii X i 2 + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ i < j = 2 3 α ij X i X j where X i are the input variables, which influence the response variable Y, α 0 the offset term, α i the ith linear coefficient, α ii the quadratic coefficient and α ij is the ijth interaction coefficient. The input values of X 1, X 2 and X 3 corresponding to the maximum value of Y were solved by setting the partial derivatives of the functions to zero."
6,Results and discussion,"The optimum levels of key factors and the effect of their interactions on hydrogen production were determined by the Box–Behnken design of RSM. Many studies have shown the effects of substrate concentration, temperature and pH on the hydrogen productivity. First of all, it is known that pH is one of the most important factors in hydrogen production due to its effects on Fe-hydrogenase activity, metabolic pathways, and the duration of lag phase (Dabrock et al., 1992; Lay, 2000; Tanisho et al., 1987). Therefore, if the initial pH did not inhibit bacterial growth or residence, a higher initial pH value would delay the beginning of the pH inhibition caused by the metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis (Lee et al., 2002). The change of metabolic pathway from acids production to non-acids production is the characteristics of genus Enterobacter (Tanisho et al., 1987). Khanal et al. (2004) also reported that low initial pH values of 4.0–4.5 cause longer lag periods. On the other hand, high initial pH values such as 9.0 decrease lag time, but have lower yield of hydrogen production (Zhang et al., 2003). It was reported that the effect of pH is due to the change of ionization state of the components in enzymatic reactions (Fabiano and Perego, 2002). Initial glucose concentration also plays an important role on the yield and production rate of hydrogen (Fabiano and Perego, 2002). Low initial glucose concentration results in the low rate of the fermentation steps, and fermentation time increases as starting substrate concentration increases. In addition, temperature affects the maximum specific growth, substrate utilization rate and the metabolic pathway of microorganisms, resulting in a shift of by-product compositions (Lay, 2000; Li and Fang, 2007; Van Ginkel et al., 2001). Moreover, the optimum conditions reported were inconsistent (Table 2 ). The values depended on the ‘one-variable-at-a-time’ approach and couldn’t explain the mutual interactions between the independent variables. Therefore, the interactive effects of these three factors selected as key parameters were investigated to maximize the hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen production rate is on the basis of the dry cell weight with the unit of ml(g dry cellh)−1. Table 1 represents the design matrix of the variables together with the experimental results. The response of the center point (glucose=83.34mM, temperature=38°C, pH=5.5) was 387.2 (±0.1)ml H2 (g dry cellh)−1 (fitted value). The regression equation obtained after the analysis of variance gave the level of response as a function of three independent variables. A quadratic model was attempted to fit the data by least-squares, and all terms regardless of their significance were included in the following equation. (4) Y = - 7384.900 + 6.656 X 1 + 295.768 X 2 + 594.477 X 3 - 0.029 X 1 2 - 4.354 X 2 2 - 85.997 X 3 2 - 0.171 X 1 X 2 + 1.051 X 1 X 3 + 8.886 X 2 X 3 where Y is the predicted hydrogen production potential; X 1, X 2, and X 3 are the coded values of glucose concentration, temperature and pH, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the significance of fit of the second order polynomial equation for the experimental data as shown in Table 3 . ANOVA for hydrogen production indicated that the F-value to be 20.699, which implies that the model was significant because model terms which have values of ‘Prob> F’ less than 0.05 are considered to be significant, but the values higher than 0.1 are insignificant (Kumar and Satyanarayana, 2007). The P-value of the regression coefficient was significant at the 1% α level, while the lack of fit was not significant. Coefficient of determination (R 2) was calculated to be 0.974, which can explain up to 97.4% variability of the response. It indicates a good agreement between experimental and predicted values and implies that the model was reliable for hydrogen production in this study. The optimum level of each variable and the effect of their interactions on the hydrogen production were studied by plotting three-dimensional response surfaces and two-dimensional contour lines (Fig. 1 ). The figures are based on Eq. (4) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level and varying the other two variables within the experimental range. The three-dimensional curves of the calculated responses show the interactions between temperature and pH, glucose concentration and pH, and glucose concentration and temperature in Fig. 1a–c, respectively. The response surface of Y indicated a clear peak, which means that the optimum point was inside the design boundary well. Hydrogen production rate, Y, increased as glucose concentration, temperature and pH increased to optimum conditions, and then declined with the increases of these factors. This result indicates that three variables had mutually dependent influence on the hydrogen production rate. The two-dimensional contour plot with glucose concentration and pH (Fig. 1b) showed an elliptical nature and a clear elongated running diagonally on plot, indicating a significant interactive effect on Y between two independent variables. On the other hand, the contour of Y with respect to temperature and pH (Fig. 1a), and glucose concentration and temperature (Fig. 1c) showed a rounded ridge running diagonally on plot, suggesting that temperature and pH, as well as glucose concentration and temperature, were slightly interdependent, or that their interactive effects were not significant. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the residual plots of the model were randomly distributed without any trends. This result indicates good predictions of maximum response along with constant variance and adequacy of the quadratic models (Mu et al., 2006). The optimum conditions for the hydrogen production rate were at initial glucose concentration 118.06mM, temperature 38°C, and initial pH 6.13. As shown in Table 2, there was a difference in temperature and pH for the optimum conditions, but the optimum pH was coincident with the results of Tanisho and Yokoi groups (Tanisho et al., 1987, 1989; Yokoi et al., 1995). The predicted value of maximum hydrogen production rate was 425.8ml H2 (g dry cell cellh)−1, which was higher than those reported by other researchers (Table 2). Therefore, the response surface optimization could be successfully used to evaluate the hydrogen production performance and to achieve higher rate of hydrogen production in this study."
7,Conclusion,"The present work focused on the optimization of key parameters for improving the hydrogen production rate using the statistical methodology. Experimental results showed that glucose concentration, temperature and pH all had significant influences on the hydrogen production rate. Glucose concentration and pH were interdependent and had a significant interactive effect on the hydrogen production rate. On the other hand, temperature and pH, as well as glucose concentration and temperature, were slightly interdependent, and their interactive effects were insignificant. Accurate prediction of the maximum value of the experimental response and the constant variance of residuals indicated that the quadratic model was adequately selected to describe the response surface within the experimental region. Maximum hydrogen production rate of 425.8ml H2 (g dry cell cellh)−1 was obtained under the optimum condition of glucose concentration 118.06mM, temperature 38°C and pH 6.13. Finally, the RSM was useful to optimize the hydrogen production process and to improve the hydrogen production rate by E. aerogenes."
