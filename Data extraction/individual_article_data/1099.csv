0,Introduction,"Since A. Fujishima discovered the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 in 1972 [1], semiconductor photocatalysis has been widely considered a promising way to help settle the environmental pollution and energy crisis faced by mankind due to its unique function for organic contaminants degradation and hydrogen production under UV/visible light irradiation [2–5]. These two processes of degradation and water splitting are similar in mechanism. In both cases, it involves the photogeneration and migration of charge carriers, while avoiding their recombination; reactants adsorption; redox reactions and end products desorption [6]. What's more, the optimal goal of photocatalysis is to maximize the utilization of solar energy. Consequently, the stable and highly efficient photocatalysts that adequate for utilizing sunlight are the requirements of the times. So far, some novel visible-light-driven photocatalysts, such as simple metal oxides (Bi2O3 [7] and WO3 [8]), sulfides (CdS [9]), perovskite-type oxide (SrTiO3 [10] and NiTiO3 [11]) and nitrides (C3N4 [12]) have been investigated in recent years. However, the low activity of photocatalysis limits its practical applications seriously [13–15]. Therefore, it is still significant to design and develop novel and highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts to improve their efficiencies for the requirements of future environmental remediation and clean energy conversion. PPECu(polymer phenylethnylcopper) has been studied as an efficient catalyst in Cu-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition reactions [16,17]. Recently, Zhu and coworkers applied it to the photocatalytic reaction to degradate phenol and 2,4-Dichlorophenol, PPECu exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity. It is proven that PPECu is a p-type semiconductor and very stable in air below 170 °C. As a novel noble-metal-free photocatalyst, PPECu has a promising potential in the fields of photodegradation of pollutants and photoelectric conversion [18]. NiFe2O4 has been attracted substantial interest due to its unique properties, and has been widely studied in the fields of photocatalytic hydrogen production [19,20], photodegradation [21,22]. In our previous works, we coupled NiFe2O4 with Ag3PO4 to obtain NiFe2O4/Ag3PO4 composites with superior adsorptive and photocatalytic activity for methylene blue [22]. As a worldwide used pharmaceutical, tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) is now considered as a representative of PPCPs (Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products), because its residue in the soil and aquatic environment can induce environmental risks and lead to serious problems for human health [23,24]. It is very important to study how to remove PPCPs from water environment. To the best of our knowledge, the PPECu-based compound has not been reported yet. In this paper, a simple coprecipitation method has been used to prepare PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites. NiFe2O4 acted as cocatalyst made the PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites possessed better activities for TC degradation than pure PPECu. More interestingly, though PPECu have not exhibited the activity for hydrogen production, all PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites were catalytically active with the help of cocatalyst NiFe2O4 under the same conditions. The hydrophobicity problem of as-prepared samples has been handled by a simple and convenient way. A possible mechanism for the efficient PPECu/NiFe2O4 composite has been proposed."
1,Experimental section,
2,The preparation of materials,"2.1 The preparation of materials All the reagents were of analytical purity and directly used in the experiment. Copper (II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(OAc)2·H2O), phenylacetylene, tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) were purchased from Tianjin Heowns Science & Technology Co., Ltd. NiFe2O4 was prepared by the method from the literature [25]."
3,Preparation of Cu2(OH)3OAc·H2O,"2.2 Preparation of Cu2(OH)3OAc·H2O 4.000 g Cu(OAc)2·H2O was dissolved in 200 mL distill water under sonication and stirred at room temperature. 200 mL NaOH solution (0.1 M) was added with drop by drop. The reaction mixture reacted at room temperature for 7 days. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, then washed 4 times with distilled water and ethanol, then dried naturally in air over night to obtain Cu2(OH)3OAc·H2O as a pale green solid."
4,Preparation of PPECu/NiFe2O4,"2.3 Preparation of PPECu/NiFe2O4 0.300 g Cu2(OH)3OAc·H2O and 0.005 g NiFe2O4 were dispersed in 50 mL methanol, the resulting mixture was sonicated for 10min. And 0.40 g phenylacetylene was added, and stirred at room temperature for 48 h. The product was centrifuged and washed 3 times with distilled water, this sample was denoted as P-NFO-5. The other composites with 0.002 g, 0.010 g and 0.020 g NiFe2O4 contents were synthesized by adding the corresponding amounts of NiFe2O4, and denoted as P-NFO-2, P-NFO-10 and P-NFO -20 respectively. The pure PPECu was prepared by this method in the absence of NiFe2O4, denoted as P-NFO-0."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystal phases and composition of the as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Haoyuan, DX-2700BH, X-ray Diffractometer). The SEM and TEM images of as-prepared samples were obtained by a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI,Tecnai G2 F20). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of as-prepared catalysts were recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2700, Japan) in the range of 200–800 nm."
6,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.5 Photocatalytic experiments 2.5.1 Photocatalytic degradation of TC Photocatalytic degradation of TC experiments were carried out in a photocatalytic reactor (BL-GHX-V, Shanghai Bilang Instrument Co., Ltd.). A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the visible light source. The system was cooled by a circulating water to maintain at 20 °C. Briefly, 0.200 g of wet photocatalyst (centrifuged, but undried, the water content is about 85%) was suspended in 100 mL aqueous solution of TC (10 mg/L). Prior to irradiation, the suspension was stirred in dark for 30min to establish an adsorption-desorption equilibrium. During the photocatalytic experiment, every 10 min, 4 mL of suspension was extracted and filtrated by filter membrane (0.22 μm) to remove the suspended catalyst. The absorbance of TC was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer at the characteristic band of 356 nm. 2.5.2 Photocatalytic H2 production The experiments of H2 production were performed in CEL-SPH2N-D hydrogen production system (Beijing Zhongjiao Jinyuan Technology Co., Ltd China) at ambient temperature. Typically, 0.050g photocatalyst powder was fully dispersed into 5 mL methanol, and then 45 mL water was added. The suspension was deoxygenized 30 min by using nitrogen, and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. The light source is a 300W Xenon lamp equipped with an UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The generated hydrogen was measured by a gas chromatography (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD)."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Characterization of PPECu/NiFe2O4 samples,"3.1 Characterization of PPECu/NiFe2O4 samples 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks of as-prepared composites (P-NFO-2, P-NFO-5, P-NFO-10, P-NFO-20) are very similar to that of pure PPECu. Meanwhile, no notably characteristic diffraction peaks of NiFe2O4 are displayed in the patterns, which can be ascribed to the relatively low content of NiFe2O4 [26]. The diffraction peaks of pure PPECu and composites are not sharp, indicating that the PPECus have poor crystallinities. 3.1.2 SEM, TEM and EDS analysis The morphologies of as-prepared samples were studied by FE-SEM and TEM. As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2 a and b), PPECu consisted of nanowire structure, the length was more than 1 μm and about 20–30 nm wide. Most of the NiFe2O4 particles were cladded by PPECu nanowires, so they can rarely be seen in the surface of composites (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c shows that, for the specimen of P-NFO-5, some NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with an average size about 100 nm are anchored on the surface of PPECu nanowires. To further prove the existence of NiFe2O4, the composite P-NFO-5 was examined by EDS analysis (Fig. 2d). The corresponding EDS pattern indicates the existence of Cu, C, Ni, Fe and O elements."
9,Optical absorption properties,"3.2 Optical absorption properties The absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples were shown in Fig. 3 a, we can see that both PPECu and NiFe2O4 exhibited strong absorption in the visible-light region. For the composites, over the range of 200–490 nm, the loading of NiFe2O4 had little effect on the absorption strength. While over the range of 490–800 nm, with the increase of NiFe2O4 content, the absorption intensity of composites gradually increased [27,28]. Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 3a, the introduction of NiFe2O4 had a negligible effect on the absorption edge of composites. The band gap energy (Eg) of the samples was estimated by the following formula based on the UV–vis DRS results [29]: α h v = A(h v − E g ) 2 Where α, h, ν and A are the absorption coefficient, Plank's constant, the light frequency, and a constant, respectively. The band gap energies for the as-prepared samples were determined from plots of (αhν)1/2 versus hν, as shown in Fig. 3b, the band gap (Eg) of pure PPECu was 2.31 eV, which was close to that of previous report (2.48 eV) [18]. And the corresponding absorption edge was 537 nm. Though the Eg of composites has not changed too much compared to that of pure PPECu, the loading of NiFe2O4 did enhance visible light absorption intensity of composites, which meant that sunlight can be used more effectively."
10,Photocatalytic activity and photocurrent response,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity and photocurrent response Firstly, the photocatalytic performances of PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites were evaluated by the degradation of TC under visible-light irradiation at room temperature. It is worth noting that the hydrophobicity of PPECu result in that dry PPECu powder is hard to disperse into water [18]. To solve this problem, we directly used the centrifuged, but undried photocatalyst in the photocatalytic degradation tests. After many experiments, the water content of wet photocatalyst was determined to be about 85%. In other words, 0.200 g wet photocatalyst was equivalent to 0.030 g dry one. It is proven that this method was convenient and effective. Fig. 4 demonstrates the photodegradation of TC over PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites. As shown in Fig. 4, more than 98% of TC was degraded over the P-NFO-5 composite photocatalyst within 20 min. Apparently, the photocatalytic activities of the pure PPECu and NiFe2O4 were significantly lower than those of the composite photocatalysts. The pure PPECu degradated 62% of the TC after 20 min of irradiation, while the pure NiFe2O4 exhibited lower activity than pure PPECu. We further investigated their photocatalytic properties for H2 production. During the photocatalytic tests, in order to eliminate the effect of hydrophobicity of PPECu, 0.050 g powder of photocatalyst was firstly dispersed into 5 mL CH3OH (sacrificial agent), and then 45 mL water was added, in this way, photocatalyst could be evenly dispersed into the solution. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , in the photocatalytic hydrogen production tests, though the result of PPECu was negative, all other composite photocatalysts were catalytically active with the help of cocatalyst NiFe2O4. Among the composite photocatalysts, P-NFO-5 exhibited the highest activity for hydrogen evolution (35.8 μmol/g) under visible light irradiation (≥420 nm) for 3 h, which was much higher than pure NiFe2O4 (3.5 μmol/g). Surprisingly, the pure PPECu didn't exhibited catalytic activity under the same condition. This might be attributed to its large H2 evolution overpotential [30]. While by loading NiFe2O4 as the cocatalysts on the PPECu, the photocatalytic activities have been significantly improved, indicating that introduction of cocatalyst reduced the activation energy (Ea) of H+ reduction [31]. Thus it can be seen that PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites had dual function for PPCPs degradation and H2 production. The photocurrent tests were conducted to further investigate the photoinduced electron transfer properties. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent density curves of P-NFO-0 and P-NFO-5. It appears that the introduction of NiFe2O4 causes a notable enhancement in photocurrent, indicating the more efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers in the P-NFO-5 composite [32]."
11,Possible photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Possible photocatalytic mechanism To explore the photocatalytic mechanism more deeply, active species trapping experiments were conducted to study the active species during the photocatalytic reaction process. Triethanolamine (TEOA, 5 mM), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA 10 mM) and p-benzoquinone (BQ, 5 mM) were used as scavengers for photoinduced holes (h+), hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide radical (O2 −), respectively [33]. As shown in Fig. 7 , when the BQ was added into the reaction system, the degradation of TC was inhibited most largely (after 30 min irradiation, the degradation rate was 19%), indicating the O2 ¯ radical is the major active species in the photocatalytic reaction process. Meanwhile, the inhibition of TEOA and TBA on TC degradation is not obvious. Based on the above experimental results, a possible mechanism is discussed to illustrate the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the PPECu/NiFe2O4 composite (Fig. 8 ). As shown in the figure, under visible light irradiation, PPECu nanowires were easily excited to generate electron-hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of PPECu can be easily transferred to the surface of NiFe2O4, which provided active sites for the reaction of photocatalytic degradation and H2 production. In the process of photodegradation, because the CB of PPECu is at −2.095 V and E (O2/O2 −) = −0.330 V (O2 as acceptor of electrons) [32,34], so the O2 molecule could be reduced to superoxide radicals [18,35], which could degrade PPCPs to small molecules (such as CO2, H2O) [36–38]. As for hydrogen production, photogenerated electrons reacted with protons to generate H2. In conclusion, the loading of NiFe2O4 not only increased the visible light absorption intensity of composites, but also promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs; therefore, the photocatalytic performance of composites has been improved greatly. In addition, in the experiment of hydrogen production, adding methanol as a sacrificial agent to react irreversibly with the photogenerated holes could facilitate the separation of electron-hole pairs, leading to higher quantum efficiencies [39]."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites have been synthesized by a coprecipitation method. Cocatalyst NiFe2O4 had the following functions: 1. providing active sites for the reaction of photocatalytic degradation and H2 production; 2. increasing the visible light absorption intensity of composites; 3. promoting the separation of photoinduced electron-holes. So PPECu/NiFe2O4 composites possessed enhanced activities for PPCPs degradation and hydrogen production. Among the composite photocatalysts, P-NFO-5 showed the highest activity with the degrade efficiency of 98% (20 min) and hydrogen evolution yield of 35.8 μmol/g (3.0 h) under visible light irradiation. The hydrophobicity problems of as-prepared samples have been handled by a simple and convenient way. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the efficient PPECu/NiFe2O4 composite has been discussed. The results of this work may provide a new insight into the design and development of novel and highly efficient difunctional photocatalysts for environmental remediation and clean energy conversion."
