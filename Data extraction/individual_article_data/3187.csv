0,Introduction,"Since its discovery in 1922, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has been recognized as one of the most versatile methods to convert syngas (CO + H2) into variable chemicals including low-sulfur gasoline and diesel, high-quality wax, mixed alcohols, and olefins [1–3]. With the rapid development of new clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, and nuclear, as well as the wide application of various kinds of high-performance batteries for vehicles and industrial energy storage, the products of FTS should be tuned from fuels to chemical feedstock, including alcohols and olefins. Compared with paraffins, olefins are important chemicals, including the building blocks of polymers (lower olefins, C2–C4) and expensive feedstock (long chain olefins, C5+). On the other hand, higher alcohols (C2–C5 alcohols) are clean fuel additives, and long chain alcohols (C6+ alcohols) can be used as detergents, lubricants, and plasticizers, which are high-value-added chemicals and widely used in many industries [4]. However, the major challenge is to suppress the selectivity to paraffinic byproducts and facilitate the selective synthesis of the target products, both alcohols and olefins [5,6]. It is well known that the catalysts used in FTS processes are iron-based and cobalt-based [3]. The iron-based catalysts are widely used in many industrial plants due to their best compromise between price and performance [7], while the cobalt-based catalysts have advantages including higher activity, increased long-chain products selectivity, lower water-gas shift tendency, and longer lifetime [8,9]. In contrast to iron-based catalysts, whose active site is proved to be iron carbide (Fe x C y ), the active site of cobalt-based catalysts is the metallic Co phase, and cobalt carbide (Co2C) has long been recognized as a kind of inactive species in FTS processes, and was considered to be unstable under realistic FTS reaction conditions [10]. However, present researches have successfully synthesized a Co2C phase that remains stable in FTS reactions and proved that it may play an important role in the formation of alcohols and olefins. It is reported that Zhong et al. used Mn and Na as promoters for synthesis of Co2C nanoprisms, which have an ultrahigh lower olefin selectivity of 60.8% (C%, CO2-free) with a high ratio of olefins to paraffins (∼30:1) [11]. Simultaneously, Xiang et al. advocated that a high selectivity to aldehydes (∼60%) could be achieved over CoMn catalysts, whose active site might be the Co2C phase and Mn5O8 structure [12]. As a kind of transition-metal carbide, Co2C has been validated to have some noble-metal-like properties that allow it to adsorb CO molecules associatively and facilitate their insertion into alkyl chains adsorbed onto adjacent metallic Co phases to form alcohols [13,14]. It is seen that direct synthesis of alcohols and olefins over Co2C catalysts may be a promising process, while further efforts should be made to increase its activity and selectivity by investigating its formation mechanism and structure–performance relationship. The reported method for synthesis of a stable Co2C phase in Co-based catalysts prepared by co-precipitation is using alkali promoters such as Na and K [11,12,15], while our previous research proved that the purified activated carbon (AC) produced by coconut shells could facilitate the formation of Co2C when it was used as a support for Co-based catalysts [16]. Over the synthesized catalyst, namely, Co/AC, a non-negligible amount of mixed alcohols (22.2 wt%) was found under conditions of 495 K, 3.0 MPa with gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1500 h−1, accompanied by the occurrence of a significant Co2C phase, as determined by XRD. The selectivity to alcohols can be further increased by adding La as a promoter, from 22.2 to at most 37.1 wt% as La loading was elevated from 0 to 2 wt%. It is seen that La is an effective promoter for supported Co-based catalysts to improve the selectivity to higher alcohols, which was further investigated by Lebarbier et al. in both experimental and theoretical aspects [17]. Nevertheless, in recent research reported by our group, Mn-promoted CoxMn/AC catalysts exhibited good catalytic performance with a high combined alcohol and olefin selectivity of ∼60 C%, as well as relative low CH4 and CO2 selectivities of about 8 and 2 C%, respectively [18]. It is noticed that the Mn promoter greatly increases the production of olefins over CoxMn/AC catalysts, while the selectivity to alcohols is similar to that over the unpromoted Co/AC catalyst (∼20%). On the basis of previous research, we employ La here as a second promoter to form a CoxMnyLa/AC catalyst to tune the FTS reaction toward alcohols and investigate its promotion effect."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Activated carbon (denoted by AC, Brilliant Tech Co. Ltd.) produced from coconut shells was employed as a support in the present work. The coconut shell AC used was first soaked in HNO3 solution for about 1 h at 353 K and then washed several times with deionized water to remove the ash and residual alkali metals. The elemental composition of the purified AC support was measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and the result is listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials. Note that the content of total impurities is less than 1 wt%. The purified AC support was then calcined at 673 K for 12 h prior to being crushed into particles of 40–60 mesh. The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness co-impregnation method, in which an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, 99.99% purity) with various amounts of manganese acetate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Aladdin, 99.9% purity) and lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, 99.9% purity) was added dropwise into the AC support. The weight percentage of Mn and La on the basis of total weight of catalyst including metal and AC support was from 0 to 1 wt%, and that of Co was fixed at 15 wt%. Thus, the prepared catalyst was named CoxMnyLa/AC (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and y = 0.1, 0.5, 1), in which x and y stand for the weight percentages of Mn and La, respectively. The catalyst precursors were dried at room temperature overnight in air and then at 333 K for 12 h in a thermostat dryer, and then they were calcined at an elevated temperature, up to 623 K, for 5 h in an Ar flow of 60 mL/min."
3,Catalyst testing,"2.2 Catalyst testing The CO hydrogenation reaction was performed in a stainless steel fixed-bed microreactor with an inner diameter of 9 mm, and 2 mL of catalyst diluted with 2 mL of quartz powder with similar diameter was packed in the flat-temperature zone of the reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ at an elevated temperature, up to 703 K, for 10 h in a H2 flow with GHSV 2000 h−1. After this, the bed temperature was cooled to 353 K, and then syngas (H2/CO = 2/1) was fed into the reactor. The CO hydrogenation reaction was carried out under the conditions 3.0 MPa, 493 K, and GHSV = 1000 h−1. To study the effects of reaction pressure and GHSV on product selectivity, the reaction pressure was varied from 3.0 to 8.0 MPa and GHSV was changed from 1000 to 3000 h−1. The effluent gas in turn passed through a hot trap and a cold trap kept at 393 and 273 K, respectively, to collect liquid products with varied boiling points. Experimental data were obtained after 12 h time on stream, when stationary activity was reached. The CO conversion and the selectivity toward each product on a carbon basis were calculated by the following equations: X CO = F CO , in - F CO , out F CO , in × 100 % , S i = N i × n i Σ ( N i × n i ) × 100 % . X CO indicates the CO conversion, F stands for the molar flow of the gas, Si is the selectivity to product i on a carbon basis (including paraffins, olefins, alcohols, and carbon dioxide), Ni is the molar fraction of product i, and ni is the carbon number of product i. The flow rates of inlet and outlet gas were measured by a mass flow meter and a soap film flow meter, respectively, and the component of the outlet gas was analyzed on line by an Agilent 6890N GC apparatus with a Plot Q packed column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a normalization method. Thus, the molar flow rates of CO in and out of the reactor (F CO, in and F CO, out) can be calculated, and then the CO conversion can be calculated. The carbon balance was calculated and kept at higher than 95% according to the experimental results. The liquid products were analyzed off line by the Agilent 6890N GC apparatus with an HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID) [19]. The organic liquid product was measured by the area normalization method, and the aqueous phase was analyzed by the internal standard method using sec-butyl alcohol as an internal standard. The weight of product i in organic liquid phase and aqueous phase were calculated by the following equations, respectively: m i = m × A i × f i Σ ( A i × f i ) where m stands for the weight of the organic liquid product, mi stands for the weight of product i in the organic liquid product, Ai is the peak area of product i, and fi indicates the correction factor of product i; and m i = m s × A i × f i A s × f s where mi stands for the weight of product i in the aqueous phase, Ai is the peak area of product i, and fi indicates correction factor of product i. m s, A s, and f s stand for the weight, peak area, and correction factor of the internal standard (sec-butyl alcohol), respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 HRTEM imaging and STEM-EDS elemental mapping Morphology of the catalysts was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The samples were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the spent catalysts in ethanol, and the suspensions were added dropwise to a copper grid for HRTEM analysis. HRTEM was performed using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin electron microscope operated at 300 kV. The average Co particle size was determined using more than 300 particles from different areas. Scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental mapping of the spent Co1Mn1La/AC catalyst was characterized with the same instrument operated at 300 kV using a high-angle annular dark field detector (HAADF) in the STEM mode. 2.3.2 Chemisorption Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR) experiments were carried out using a Zeton Altramira AMI-300 instrument. About 100 mg of calcined catalyst was packed into a U-shaped quartz reactor, flushed with Ar at 393 K for 2 h, and then cooled to 323 K. The sample was treated with a flow of 10% H2/Ar at an elevated temperature, up to 1073 K, with a speed of 10 K/min. The H2 consumption was detected by a TCD. Pulsed CO chemisorption was carried out using the same instrument. About 100 mg of calcined catalyst precursor was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor and then reduced at 703 K for 4 h in a flow of 10% H2/Ar. Afterward, the sample was flushed with He at the same temperature for 30 min to remove the residual adsorbed H2. Experiments were performed at 323 K, which was reported in the literature [20] to be a suitable temperature for CO adsorption, by pulse injection of 10% CO/He. The quantity of CO in the flow downstream of the sample was measured by a TCD, and the CO pulses were continued until the TCD signal reached a constant value. The dispersion of cobalt is calculated on the basis of CO uptake and reduction degree of Co, according to the formula % dispersion = [ 0.5893 × ( μ mol / gCO ) ] / [ % metal ] × ( reduction percentage ) Pulsed H2 chemisorption was also carried out on the same instrument. About 100 mg of calcined catalyst precursor was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor and then reduced at 703 K for 4 h in a flow of 10% H2/Ar. Afterward, the sample was flushed with Ar at the same temperature for 2 h to remove the residual adsorbed H2. Then the oven was cooled to 373 K in a flow of Ar, which was reported to be an appropriate temperature for H2 adsorption in the literature [20], by means of pulse injection of 10% H2/Ar. The quantity of H2 in the flow downstream of the sample was measured by a TCD, and the H2 pulses were continued until the TCD signal reached a constant value. 2.3.3 XRD measurement Powder X-ray diffraction (ex situ XRD) phase analysis was performed using a PANalytical X’Pert3 powder diffractometer with CuKα radiation in our laboratory. In each run, about 300 mg of the catalyst sample was packed into the glassy sample cell and measured at 40 kV and 40 mA in a scanning angle (2θ) range of 30°–70° at a speed of 2°/min. The in situ XRD measurements were conducted with the same instrument using an Anton Paar XRK 900 chamber for the in situ reactions. The phase transformation of the calcined Co0.5Mn1La/AC sample was monitored during reduction in a H2 flow of 20 mL/min with a heating rate of 1 K/min from room temperature to 703 K. Each scan was performed every 20 min in a 2θ range from 30° to 70°. Afterward, the chamber was cooled to 493 K and the catalyst sample was treated with syngas (H2/CO = 2/1) at 0.8 MPa (the maximum pressure of the chamber was less than 1.0 MPa). The XRD patterns were collected every 60 min. All of the XRD patterns were analyzed by X'pertHighScorePlus 2.0 software with the JCPDS library. 2.3.4 XPS surface analysis The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed with a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi instrument using monochromatic Al Kα at 15 kV and 10.8 mA as an X-ray source to measure the surface composition of the samples. After subtraction of the Shirley-type background, the spectra were decomposed into several components with mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian lines using a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting procedure reported in the literature [21]. All the XPS spectra were corrected by referring to the binding energies of the C1s neutral carbon peak at 284.6 eV. The atomic surface compositions were calculated using the formula n i n j = I i I j × σ j σ i × E k j 0 . 6 E k i 0 . 6 , where I, n, E k, and σ stand for the intensity, number of atoms, kinetic energy, and photoionization cross section, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance Results of CO hydrogenation over CoyLa/AC (y = 0.1, 0.5, and 1) and CoxMnyLa/AC (x = 0.5 and 1) catalysts with varying Mn and La loadings under conditions of 493 K, 3.0 MPa, GHSV = 1000 h−1, and H2/CO = 2/1 are compiled in Fig. 1 . The product slate contains mixed linear α-alcohols, olefins, and paraffins and a minor amount of carbon dioxide. All the alcohols, as well as most of the C5+ hydrocarbons, exist in the liquid phase, while C2–C4 hydrocarbons are in the gasous phase. Seen in Fig. 1a for the unpromoted Co/AC catalyst, La doping greatly suppressed the CO conversion (from 64.5 to 31.5% as La loading was increased from 0 to 1 wt%) and decreased the selectivity of C5+ products from 35.2 to 13.8%. Simultanously, selectivities to C2–C4 hydrocarbons and alcohols were enhanced by La. In the liquid products, it is obvious that La promotion resulted in a larger amount of alcohols, up to 61 wt% in the liquid phase. According to the results, it seems that the La promotion can produce lighter FTS products, during which the chain-lengthening probabilities (α-value) of olefins and paraffins decreased from ∼0.7 to ∼0.6, as can be seen in Fig. S1, whereas it is noticed that La facilitates the formation of alcohols, especially in the liquid phase. Subsquently, since the Mn-promoted Co/AC catalysts have been investigated thoroughly in our previous work and exhibit high combined olefin and alcohol selectivity, up to 60% [18], we introduce La into the CoxMn/AC catalysts to study its promotion effect. As seen in Fig. 1b, the addition of La also decreased the CO conversion, which is similar to that for unpromoted Co/AC catalyst. However, it is noticed that selectivities to all the olefins and paraffins over Co0.5MnyLa/AC catalysts were decreased and increased by La promoter, respectively, with almost unchanged alcohol selectivity. In the liquid products, the content of alcohols was increased by La, while more higher alcohols and fewer long-chain alcohols were found in the product slate. Note that similar rules can be found in the Co1MnyLa/AC catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1c. The α-value of all the products over CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts can also be seen in Fig. S1, in which a decrease of the chain-lengthening probability caused by La can be identified clearly. Accordingly, we conclude that La promotion can shift the product slate toward lighter components, facilitate the conversion of olefins to paraffins to some extent, and promote the formation of alcohols. Since alcohols are the most valuable products in the product slate, we advocate that more efforts should be made to increase the selectivity to alcohols. Then we studied some reaction conditions, involving reaction pressure and GHSV to study their influence on the catalytic performance. The Co0.5Mn1La/AC catalyst was picked to conduct the experiments because it provides the best compromise between catalytic performance and alcohol selectivity. The effect of reaction pressure on the catalytic performance of the Co0.5Mn1La/AC catalyst is shown in Table 1 . It is seen that the CO conversion increased from 8.3 to 16.2% as the reaction pressure was elevated from 3.0 to 8.0 MPa, accompanied by decreasing CH4 and CO2 selectivities. Meanwhile, it is obvious that elevating the reaction pressure can enhance the formation of alcohols from 26.8 to 31.4%, while the selectivity to C2–C4 olefins was simultaneously decreased. Note that a slight increase in C5+ paraffins and olefins can be found. Basically, a higher reaction pressure facilitates the formation of alcohols and promotes the selectivity to heavy components, which corresponds well with the results reported in the literature [11]. This means that the C–C coupling and the CO insertion into alkyl chains are enhanced at higher reaction pressures, which may indicate an alternative method of increasing the selectivity to alcohols. Another factor that may affect the catalytic performance is GHSV. In our previous work, a trade-off between olefin and alcohol over CoxMn/AC catalysts was found under varying GHSVs [18]. However, as listed in Table 2 , changing GHSV did not change the selectivity to alcohols greatly, but might result in a trade-off between olefins and paraffins over Co0.5Mn1La/AC catalyst; the selectivity to C2–C4 olefins decreased from 22.2 to 16.7% as the value of GHSV was decreased from 3000 to 1000 h-1, accompanied by an increase of C2–C4 paraffin selectivity from 13.7 to 17.4%. Intriguingly, the combined selectivity for C2–C4 hydrocarbons at varying GHSVs remained about 35%. A similar rule can be found in the change in C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity, in which a trade-off between olefins and paraffins can be identified. The influence of GHSVs on catalytic performance of Co0.5MnyLa/AC (y = 0.1, 0.5) and Co1MnyLa/AC catalysts (y = 0.1, 0.5, 1) is listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The space time yields (STY) of Co/AC, CoyLa/AC, and CoxMnyLa/AC are listed in Table S4. It is obvious that a small amount of La could increase the STY of alcohols and olefins simultaneously and a small amount of Mn could increase the STY of olefins significantly. Further addition of Mn and La decreases the STY of alcohols, olefins, and paraffins simultaneously. The TOFs of the CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts are calculated based on molar CO consumption and metallic Co dispersion measured by CO pulsed chemisorption and depicted in Fig. 2 . It is obvious that the addition of Mn promoter increases the TOFs about onefold, from ∼40 to ∼80 h−1, whereas La promoter decreases the TOFs to some extent. The result is in line with Johnson et al. [22], which pointed out that Mn can facilitate the dissociative adsorption of CO molecules. Compared with some other Co-based catalysts listed in Table S5, the TOFs of the CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts reported here are of the same order of magnitude (∼101) with other alcohol synthesis catalysts (CoCuLa) which also has surface Co2C phase [23], but much smaller than that of typical Co-based FTS catalysts (∼102), whose active site is recognized as metallic Co [22,24]. We suggest that this may due to the partial carburization of surface Co atoms in a FTS run (see Section 3.2). To our best knowledge, it seems that few articles have reported the TOFs of Co2C catalysts [11,12], so that more effort should be made in future to determine the actual number of active sites and calculate the TOFs accurately. On the basis of these results, we suggest that La promoter can facilitate the formation of alcohols but make the FTS product class shift to lighter components. However, its promotion effect is not so strong as that of Mn, because the product class of CoxMnyLa/AC was not far from that of CoxMn/AC catalysts reported previously [18]. Differently from Mn, which facilitates the CO dissociative adsorption process by the Lewis acid–base interaction between Mn2+ cations and the oxygen atom of CO adsorbed onto the adjacent metallic Co phase as reported by Johnson et al. [20], the La promoter may both facilitate the hydrogenation and the CO insertion process, because of the increasing paraffin and alcohol selectivities. Accordingly, the structural and surface properties of CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts are investigated in the rest of this paper to establish their structure–performance relationship."
7,Catalyst characterizations,"3.2 Catalyst characterizations 3.2.1 Microscopy and spatial distribution of Mn and La Morphology of catalysts after reaction was analyzed by HRTEM. Representative TEM images for the spent Co0.5Mn0.5La/AC, Co0.5Mn1La/AC, and Co1Mn1La/AC samples are shown in Fig. 3 a–c. It is seen that the active sites of these catalysts are spherical cobalt species whose particle sizes range from 5 to 15 nm, and are dispersed on the surface of the AC support. The particle size distributions are depicted in Fig. 3 g–i, showing nearly monomodal, rather narrow Gaussian-like behavior. The average particle sizes of cobalt species nanoparticles of Co0.5Mn0.5La/AC, Co0.5Mn1La/AC, and Co1Mn1La/AC were 9.2, 12.2, and 10.8 nm, respectively. The result implies that the loadings of Mn and La have little influence on the particle size of cobalt species. To investigate the crystalline structure of cobalt species in the catalysts in depth, the catalyst samples were simultaneously characterized by HRTEM. The HRTEM images, shown in Fig. 3d–f, indicate that face-centered cubic (fcc) Co coexists with Co2C in the nanoparticles. In Fig. 3d, the clean lattice fringes of 2.18 and 2.10 Å and the corresponding angle of 61° are the characteristic interlayer spacing of the Co2C (0 0 2) and Co2C (1 1 1) planes, and the lattice fringes of 2.06 Å is attributed to the fcc Co (1 1 1) plane. Similar results are obtained in Fig. 3e and f, in which the characteristic lattice fringes of Co2C and fcc Co are identified. Basically, the dominant phase in the spent CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts is Co2C. Since almost no Mn and La can be seen in HRTEM images, the spatial distribution of each element should be investigated. The HAADF-STEM images of the spent Co1Mn1La/AC sample are shown in Fig. 4 a, in which many cobalt species nanoparticles (the bright ones) were located on the AC support. As shown in Fig. 4b, region 1 was chosen to conduct STEM-EDS mapping, and region 2 was picked as the reference. To separate La, Mn, and Co in the energy spectrum diagram, their energies were fixed at 4.8, 5.8, and 6.8 keV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b. The representative elemental mappings of La, Mn, and Co are compiled in Fig. 4c–e and are described by yellow, green, and red, respectively. The relative pixel intensities of the three channels were scanned according to the total X-ray counts for each channel. According to Fig. 4e, the spherical cobalt phase particles are randomly distributed on the surface of the AC support with clear boundary between nanoparticles and support. Nevertheless, the distributions of La and Mn were not so discriminating as that of Co, because some of them could be seen on the AC support, as depicted in Fig. 4c and d. However, an obvious enrichment of La and Mn, corresponding to the distribution of Co, could also be identified in Fig. 4c and d, indicating an agglomeration of La and Mn to the cobalt phase nanoparticles. It could be inferred that the La and Mn had intimate contact with Co, which might facilitate the interaction between Co and promoters in the light of elemental spatial distribution. Actually, the formation of a metal–metal oxide interface between Co and Mn and its promotion effect on catalytic performance for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reaction have been fully investigated in the literature [20]. 3.2.2 Reduction and chemisorption The H2 TPR profiles of CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts are depicted in Fig. 5 , in which three major peaks can be observed. The small hydrogen consumption peak at 498–507 K is attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, which is the first reduction step for cobalt oxides. The second peak, located at 609–625 K, is assigned to the second reduction step for Co species, during which the CoO converts into metallic Co. The broad hydrogen consumption peak between 700 and 850 K should be ascribed to the hydrogenation of organic groups on the surface of the activated carbon support in the presence of metallic Co, accompanied by the formation of methane [16]. According to Fig. 5, the addition of both Mn and La prohibited the reduction of cobalt oxides, because all three peaks migrated toward higher temperature as more Mn and La were added. The reduction degree, calculated on the basis of the H2 TPR results, is listed in Table 3 . It decreased from 76 to 66% with increasing La doping, and the addition of Mn caused a further decline of reduction degree, down to 48% when the Mn loading was 2 wt%. Similarly, the results correspond well with the work reported by Johnson et al. [20], in which Mn-promoted CoMn/SiO2 catalysts have a much lower reduction degree than the Co/SiO2 sample. Generally, the promotion effects of Mn and La on the variation tendency of reduction degree are similar, which demonstrates the prohibitive effects of Mn and La on the reduction of cobalt oxides, and may indicate intimate contact among Co, Mn, and La. The CO uptake of the CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts was measured and compiled in Table 3. It is obvious that the CO uptake decreased monotonically from 293 to 213 μmol/g-cat with the increase of La loadings from 0 to 1 wt%. Compared with that of La, Mn doping displayed a stronger influence on the CO uptake, which decreased to about half of that on the CoyLa/AC catalysts when only 0.5 wt% Mn was added. Further addition of Mn led to a decrease of CO uptake, in which the Co2Mn0.5La/AC catalyst has the lowest value of 92 μmol/g-cat. Accordingly, the dispersion degree of Co, calculated based on CO uptake and reduction degree, declined as more promoters were added, which indicates a weaker influence of La and a stronger influence of Mn. It is seen that the addition of La from 0.1 to 1 wt% only causes a decrease of Co dispersion degree from 11.2 to 8.3%, which is close to that of the unpromoted Co/AC catalyst, 11.5%, whereas the addition of only 0.5 wt% Mn caused a sharp drop of dispersion degree to about 5%, and the further addition of Mn had no significant influence. With respect to the H2 uptake of catalyst samples, also seen in Table 3, the addition of La resulted in a monotonic increase of H2 uptake from 9.8 to 29.0 μmol/g-cat, while the Mn doping significantly prohibited H2 adsorption (2.9–9.0 μmol/g-cat). The result corresponds well with the CH4 selectivity over CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts, showing that La facilitated the hydrogenation of surface *CH2 groups while Mn inhibited it. Compared with the CoMn/SiO2 catalyst (Mn/Co molar ratio = 0.1, H2 uptake about 20–50 μmol/g-cat) reported in the literature [20], the CoxMnyLa/AC catalyst has a much lower H2 uptake (at most 9.8 μmol/g-cat), exhibiting an H-lean surface environment in the present catalytic system. The variation of cobalt dispersion and reduction degree on CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts is in line with the change of catalytic activity. The decrease of CO conversion over CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts caused by Mn and La can be partly attributed to the prohibition effects on the reduction of cobalt oxides [22]. 3.2.3 Change of crystalline phase and structure The XRD patterns of CoxMnyLa/AC catalyst samples, which were calcined at 623 K in an Ar flow, are compiled in Fig. 6 a and c, respectively. It is apparent that the cobalt species are mainly Co3O4, according to the JCPDS reference (PDF 01-074-2120, 2θ = 36.8°, 44.8°, 59.3°, and 65.2°). Meanwhile, some CoO co-exists in the samples (PDF 01-070-2855, 2θ = 36.7°, 42.8°, and 62.2°). Note that no diffraction peak ascribed to Mn or La was found in the XRD patterns. We suggest that the minor amounts of Mn and La promoters in the catalysts result in high dispersion on the surfaces of the catalysts, which cannot be measured by XRD. With respect to the used catalysts, which were treated by syngas under realistic FTS reaction conditions in the fixed-bed reactor after 24 h time on stream, the XRD patterns exhibit some significant differences. As seen in Fig. 6d, a large amount of cobalt carbide (Co2C) (PDF 01-072-1369, 2θ = 37.0°, 41.3°, 42.5°, 45.7°, and 56.6°) and a minor amount of fcc Co (PDF 01-089-7093, 2θ = 44.2°) can be identified on the spent CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts. The structure of the spent CoyLa/AC catalysts differs somewhat from that of the spent CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6b, both Co2C and fcc Co phases can be clearly identified in the spent CoyLa/AC catalysts, indicating that their active sites may be composed of Co2C and a residual fcc Co phase, namely, Co–Co2C, whereas the active sites of spent CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts are mainly Co2C phase, and almost no metallic Co can be found in the XRD patterns. The structure is similar to that of the CoxMn/AC catalysts reported in our previous work [18], in which we suggest that they may composed of a Co2C phase and a highly dispersed surface metallic Co phase and named them Co@Co2C. To reveal the phase transformation process clearly, in situ XRD measurement was conducted. The calcined Co0.5Mn1La/AC catalyst was picked as the sample, and was first treated with H2 at elevated temperatures from 298 to 703 K, during which the XRD patterns were collected every 20 K and are depicted in Fig. 7 a–c. At the beginning, the major component of cobalt species lower than 433 K was Co3O4. It started to be reduced to CoO when the temperature reached 453 K. This means that the reduction of Co nanoparticles on the activated carbon support starts at about 453 K, during which Co3+ converts into Co2+ for the first step of reduction as reported in the literature [25] and corresponds well with the result of H2 TPR. Subsequently, the diffraction peak attributed to fcc Co started to appear when the temperature was elevated to 573 K, which is attributed to the second reduction step, during which Co2+ converts into Co0. The amount of metallic Co0 increased as the temperature was raised until 703 K, at which the amount of Co0 slowly increased from 1 h to 10 h. Note that some residual CoO species cannot be reduced, although the catalyst was kept at 703 K for 10 h. Basically, in the freshly reduced CoxMnyLa/AC catalyst, the active site should be the metallic Co phase, because the residual CoO had no CO hydrogenation activity [1]. The reduced Co0.5Mn1La/AC catalyst was then treated with syngas (H2/CO = 2/1) to investigate the restructuring of the active site under realistic CO hydrogenation reaction conditions. Experiments were conducted at 493 K and 0.8 MPa, the results of which are presented in Fig. 7d. In the first 25 h, the major component of the catalyst sample remained the metallic fcc Co phase, while a small diffraction peak at 2θ = 42.5° attributed to Co2C (1 1 1) was observed after 30 h time on stream. The signal of Co2C became stronger as the reaction time was lengthened, and other diffraction peaks of Co2C (0 0 2) and (0 2 1) at 2θ = 41.3° and 45.7° gradually appeared. Accordingly, the intensity of the diffraction peak of metallic fcc Co was getting weaker. The result proved the conversion of metallic fcc Co to the Co2C phase in the catalyst sample under realistic CO hydrogenation reaction conditions. It was suggested that the formation of Co2C should be attributed to the carburization of Co0 through the dissociation of CO on the surface of the catalyst, as well as the migration of carbon atoms from the surface to the core of Co nanoparticles. The reaction rate and the depth of carburization in the XRD apparatus are less than in the fixed-bed reactor. This could be explained by the difference of reaction pressure, which influences the carburization rate and migration process in the kinetic aspect [26]. In the fixed-bed reactor, the pressure was 3.0 MPa, in which the partial pressure of CO was 1.0 MPa, while that in the in situ chamber of XRD was only 0.27 MPa. On the basis of the results of in situ XRD, we conclude that a restructuring of the active site occurs during the FTS reaction, that is, a transformation of metallic Co in the reduced catalysts to Co2C phase under syngas. The Co–Co2C and Co@Co2C nanoparticles may be responsible for the catalytic performance of CoyLa/AC and CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts. 3.2.4 Surface elemental composition The surface elemental composition of the spent CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts after 24 h time on stream, as well as the valence states of elements, was investigated by XPS. The XPS spectra of Co2p, Mn2p, La3d, and C1s are compiled in Fig. 8 . Seen in Fig. 8a, deconvolutions of the Co2p 3/2 peaks at 778.3, 780.0, and 780.9 eV were located, which are attributed to Co0, Co3+, and Co2+, respectively. It seems that Co2+ is the dominant cobalt phase on the surfaces of catalysts, while a small amount of Co3+ exists in the Co0.5Mn0.5La/AC catalyst, which may be formed by the oxidation of Co0 in the sample preparation and transfer process. A Co0 shoulder was found in the CoxMn1La/AC catalysts, which remained stable and was resistant to oxidation even after exposure to air for a long time. Based on Fig. 8d, C1s peaks at 283.9, 284.6, and 288.5 eV were observed on the different CoxMnyLa/AC samples. A C1s peak at 284.6 eV was attributed to the surface graphite carbon of the activated carbon support. A C1s peak at 288.5 eV was attributed to the surface carbonates of the activated carbon support. Furthermore, a C1s peak at 283.9 eV was ascribed to the surface carbides, which might be the cobalt carbides on the surfaces of CoxMnyLa/AC samples. We suggest that the Co0 may be protected by a thin layer of carbon film formed by the CO dissociation. With respect to the Co2+ species, on the basis of previous investigations, and the C1s spectra shown in Fig. 8d, they should be attributed to the Co2C phase, which is found to exist universally in all of the spent catalysts. Note the shift of binding energy on Co2+ in the Co0.5Mn0.5La/AC catalyst; some CoO may coexist with the Co2C phase on the surface. The XPS spectra of Mn and La are depicted in Fig. 8b and c. The peaks at 640.7 and 641.9 eV represent the existence of Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn4+, respectively. In the reduction process, the Mn4+ converted to Mn2+/Mn3+, while the reduction was not sufficient under conditions of higher Mn loading. Accordingly, the form in which Mn promoter existed in the catalysts was MnO x , which agrees well with the consensus in the literature [20]. Nevertheless, only one peak at 834.9 eV assigned to La3+ can be found in the XPS spectra of La3d, showing that La cannot be reduced after reduction and reaction processes, but only exists in the form of La2O3. Quantitative analyses of the surface atomic ratio of C, Mn, and La to Co obtained from XPS spectra are depicted in Table 4 . It indicates that Mn and La accumulate preferentially on the surfaces of catalysts during reduction or CO hydrogenation processes, most probably in the reduction step, as demonstrated in the literature [27]. It is proposed that coverage of surface Co atoms by Mn and La oxides results in a decrease of catalytic activity, and the interactions among Co, Mn, and La cause strong promotion effects. On the other hand, the decrease of the Co/C ratio shows an increase in the amount of surface carbonaceous species, including carbides and graphited carbon formed during CO hydrogenation. Accordingly, a C-rich surface chemical environment can be identified, which could result in a decrease of actual H/C ratio on the surface of cobalt nanoparticles, result in a lower hydrogenation rate accompanied by more β-elimination [28] and CO insertion [13] facilitated by Co2C, which was formed by the carburization of the metallic Co phase."
8,Origin of promotion effects,"3.3 Origin of promotion effects The promotion effect of La and Mn on the catalytic performance corresponds well with that reported in previous [16,20,28], in which La facilitates the formation of alcohols and light components, while Mn promotes the formation of olefins. It is noted that a minor amount of Mn and La promoter can result in the full promotion effect, because of their tendency to aggregate on the surface of cobalt nanoparticles [22]. On the basis of structural analysis of catalysts with varying amounts of Mn and La loading, we advocate that the promotion effects of Mn and La in the CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts are different. Previous investigations have proved that Mn promotion can facilitate the formation of Co2C, forming the Co@Co2C structure in which small metallic Co ensembles are dispersed on the surface of a Co2C nanoparticle [18]. In contrast, here we found that the addition of La can only result in a combination of fcc Co and Co2C (Co–Co2C) in the CoyLa/AC catalysts. Since the active site of CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts has been identified to be Co@Co2C and its product slate is similar to that of the CoxMn/AC catalysts, it seems that the promotion effect of Mn is stronger than that of La, which may relate to the stronger relative Lewis acidity of MnO and Mn2O3 (1.4 and 2.5, respectively) than of La2O3 (0.85) as reported by Jeong et al. [29]. With respect to La promotion, it is acknowledged that Co nanoparticles are the active sites for H2 and CO dissociative adsorption, forming surface H* species and C* species. The two intermediate species subsequently react with each other to form surface *CH x species, which are the building blocks of the alkyl chains. If the hydrogenation on the surface of catalysts was enhanced, the *CH x species tended to be fully hydrogenated to CH4; otherwise they mighty connect to others to form *C n H2 n +1 species. The mechanism of this process is illustrated in Fig. 9 according to the literature [3]. At any stage of the alkyl chain growth, stable products could be formed either by β-hydride elimination from a growing carbon chain to produce a linear α-olefin or by α-hydrogen addition by H* to produce a linear paraffin. In the case of the C-rich surface of Co@Co2C, the concentration of surface H* is much lower. Hence, α-hydrogen addition was inhibited while β-hydride elimination was promoted, resulted in an increase in olefin selectivity and a decrease in paraffin selectivity. Moreover, the nondissociative adsorption of CO and its insertion into the alkyl chains were facilitated by Co2C; thus, the termination of *C n H2 n +1 species tends to be aided by a CO molecule, which causes the formation of linear α-alcohols (C n +1H2 n +3OH). Apparently, the addition of La facilitates both the CO insertion and hydrogenation steps, and prohibits the C–C coupling step as well, resulting in an increase of alcohol selectivity and making the product class shift to light components. The rationale behind this is twofold. First, enhancement of H2 chemisorption by La promotion increases the relative surface ratio of H to C, which facilitates the hydrogenation of alkyl chains to form paraffins and prohibits the C–C coupling step as well. Second, the weaker Lewis acidity of La2O3 decreases the CO dissociation rate and promotes its insertion into alkyl chains to form alcohols."
9,Conclusions,"We introduced La into the CoxMn/AC catalysts to form CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts in order to tune the product slate toward alcohols. It turns out that La doping can facilitate the formation of alcohols, which can reach ∼26.8% and up to 31.7% through elevation of the reaction pressure. La also facilitates the hydrogenation of alkyl chains, resulting in a shift of the product slate toward light components due to the enhancement of H2 chemisorption. Similarly to Mn, La also tends to aggregate on the surface of Co nanoparticles and achieves a full promotion effect with a relatively low loading, but its promotion effect is not as strong as that of Mn, because the structure of the active site of CoxMnyLa/AC catalysts is proved to be Co@Co2C, similar to that of CoxMn/AC, while that of CoyLa/AC catalysts is only Co–Co2C. We suggest that the result may be due to the weaker Lewis acidity of La than of Mn. Nevertheless, since the addition of La can further tune the FTS reaction toward alcohols, it provides a possible way to increase the selectivity to alcohols over CoxMn/AC catalysts.
