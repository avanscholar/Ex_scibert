0,Introduction,"It is well known that naturally occurring seed oils are comprised of C18 multiple cis-olefins. As recovered, these oils are susceptible to air oxidation and thus have a limited shelf life. Partial hydrogenation is commonly employed to stabilize, improve texture and smoke point, prolong shelf life, and enhance taste. Unfortunately, during conventional heterogeneous catalysis processing it is almost unavoidable that a considerable percentage of the remaining (non-hydrogenated) cis-olefins are isomerized to their trans form. Research within the last decade has shown that the presence of these “trans-fats”, or trans-olefins, in our diet increases our risk for coronary heart disease. In fact, beginning January 1, 2006, the US FDA will require all food labels to quantify the amount of trans-fats in retail food products. Recent work by our group has revealed that cavitating ultrasound, as compared to traditional processing methodologies, can significantly alter selectivity (by up to ∼700%) in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenations [1]. In this work we discussed the use of an inert dopant that has the effect of initiating the rapid onset of cavitation in an ultrasound-assisted reaction. Conversely, without the dopant no cavitation occurred even when employing full sonifier power (100% amplitude and ∼400W in 50mL solution volume). This study can be compared to other work, where substantially smaller changes in selectivity (<50%) are observed when high power non-cavitating ultrasound is employed as the processing method compared to a silent control experiment [2–5]. As an extension of this work and to attempt to find an application of this ultrasound processing methodology, we study here the hydrogenation of simple model cis-olefins and characterize their conversion to the trans form versus the saturated alcohol species. In particular, our starting material is the cis-olefins (cis-2-buten-1-ol and cis-2-penten-1-ol) and products are trans-olefins (trans-2-buten-1-ol and trans-2-penten-1-ol) and saturated alcohols (1-butanol and 1-pentanol, respectively). Although the trans-olefins are technically intermediates, as they undergo hydrogenation themselves to the saturated alcohols, our results indicate that this process is substantially slower than direct hydrogenation of the cis-olefin substrates."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and apparatus,"2.1 Materials and apparatus The 2-buten-1-ol reagent was supplied by ChemSampCo (97% purity) whereas the 2-penten-1-ol reagent was supplied by Aldrich Chemical Company (95% purity). The 1-butanol (99.8% purity) and 1-pentanol (99% purity) used for GC/MS calibration purposes were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company. A commercial Pd-black catalyst (Aldrich, 99.9% purity metals basis) with a N2 BET surface area of 42m2/g was used in this study [1]. Deionized water (18MΩcm) was used as the solvent. Hydrogenations were performed with hydrogen gas (A&L specialty gas, 99.99% purity) at a pressure of 6.5atm (80 psig). All components used for the reaction apparatus are commercially available and have been described in detail previously [1,2]. Samples collected during an experiment were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard GC/MS (5890 GC and 5972 MSD). Authentic standards were employed in the calibration of mass area counts. For the cis-2-buten-1-ol system the entire total ion chromatograms (TICs) were utilized. However, for the 2-penten-1-ol system the 1-pentanol peak co-eludes with the trans-2-penten-1-ol isomer (when run isothermal at 35°C). For this system single ion monitoring (SIM) was employed utilizing m/z =68 for the trans and cis isomers and m/z =70 for 1-pentanol. Again authentic standards were used to calibrate ion intensities (e.g., determine ion counts/mole). The GC/MS method entailed a liquid injection volume of 1.5μL and a temperature ramp of 2.5°C/min. The column used for analyses, for both systems, was a 30m, 0.5μm DB-5MS column."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure For all experiments, 50mL of water and catalyst (1.5±0.1mg Pd-black) were added to the reaction cell. For ultrasound-assisted, as well as silent (e.g., stirred) experiments, the catalyst was reduced with hydrogen (80 psig) in water using non-cavitating ultrasound at an average power of 390W (electrical; 98% amplitude) for 2min, prior to reaction. A Branson Ultrasonics model 450 digital sonifier (probe-type) with a jacketed reaction cell was employed in these experiments. A bath circulation system (Fisher Scientific 1016D) maintained temperature at 298±2.5K. The concentration of the reagent employed was 100mM (67M/g-catalyst based on initial concentrations). The first sample for each experiment was taken for time equal to 0min and filtered through a 0.45μm hydrophilic Millipore filter to remove catalyst powder into a capped vial for subsequent GC/MS analyses. For stirred (control/silent) experiments, the cell was connected to the probe assembly and pressurized with hydrogen. Stirring was commenced, and after the system reacted a (filtered) sample was collected. Further samples were taken for subsequent time intervals using the same method of pressurizing and stirring. For ultrasound-treated experiments, the cell was connected, vented, and pressurized with hydrogen as just described. The solution in the cell was irradiated with ultrasound (100% amplitude) and samples collected. To ensure rapid onset of cavitation for the cavitating ultrasound experiments 200mM of 1-propanol was used as an inert dopant in solution that caused cavitation within 3s of turning on the sonifier, resulting in 270±25W cavitating power delivered to the convertor, again at 100% sonifier amplitude. Our claim that 1-propanol is an inert dopant is only substantiated through indirect evidence. For example, a prior study by our group of a similar hydrogenation [1] has shown that only a 16% change in selectivity occurred between a reaction run under silent conditions with and without the 1-propanol inert dopant. Furthermore, the chromatographic analyses indicated that the dopant remained at a constant concentration throughout both ultrasound and silent reactions. The only substantial inert dopant effect was a 2-fold reduction in silent reaction activity with the dopant present."
4,Results and discussion,"The temporal behavior of the hydrogenation of cis-2-buten-1-ol is given in Fig. 1 for the (a) cavitating ultrasound and (b) silent and stirred systems. We have not performed experiments employing non-cavitating high power ultrasound (e.g., without inert dopant) conditions. This omission is justified, we believe, since a prior hydrogenation study by our group [1] demonstrated nearly identical selectivities between non-cavitating high power ultrasound and stirred silent processing conditions. It is seen for both systems studied here in Fig. 1 that all concentrations change monotonically and thus are well behaved. Two general observations can be made about Fig. 1. First, a fit was made to cis-2-buten-1-ol decay that resulted in first-order rate coefficients of 2.30×10−2 and 9.60×10−5 s for ultrasound and stirred/silent reactions, respectively. All kinetic fits had an average 11% estimated uncertainty for the assumed first-order process (95% confidence interval). Thus the ultrasound reaction activity was a factor of 240-fold greater. Second, whereas the cavitating ultrasound yielded comparable trans-2-buten-1-ol and 1-butanol concentrations throughout the course of the reaction, the silent reaction had a [trans-2-buten-1-ol/1-butanol] ratio of ∼2 through the reaction. A slightly different result was obtained for hydrogenation of cis-2-penten-1-ol. Fig. 2 again compares the (a) cavitating ultrasound result to the (b) silent experiment. Here the activities again assuming first-order loss of the substrate were 2.36×10−2 and 1.46×10−4 s for ultrasound and stirred/silent reactions, respectively. It is seen that a slightly smaller ratio of activities of ultrasound-to-stirred of 162 exists (as compared to cis-2-buten-1-ol system above). Also, a more variable [trans-2-penten-1-ol/1-pentanol] ratio for both the ultrasound and silent systems is present during the course of the reaction. Most notable is the enhanced 1-pentanol production at large extent of reaction relative to the silent system. It is worthwhile mentioning that without catalyst less than 4% reaction occurred for either the 2-buten-1-ol or 2-penten-1-ol systems after 60s of cavitating ultrasound treatment. This small amount of reaction is likely due to residual catalyst carry-over (e.g., impurity) in the reactor. A further characterization of the selectivity towards saturated alcohol versus trans-olefin products is presented in Fig. 3 . In this figure the [saturated alcohol/trans-olefin] molar ratio is given as a function of extent of reaction, for both the 2-buten-1-ol and 2-penten-1-ol systems. It is seen that these ratios for the ultrasound experiments (for both compounds) lie above those for the silent control experiments. This again illustrates, perhaps more clearly, the reduction in trans-olefin production occurring in the ultrasound-assisted systems. An additional item worth noting is the somewhat dramatic upturn (e.g., increase in ratio) that occurs in the ultrasound systems at large extent of reaction. One possible cause of this would be an enhanced [trans-olefin→saturated alcohol] rate increase in the ultrasound systems. A final refinement in the data presentation, which arguably is in a form that best illustrates the trans-olefin reduction potential of ultrasound processing, is given in Fig. 4 . Presented is the following quantity: ([trans-olefin/saturated alcohol]ultrasound)/([trans-olefin/saturated alcohol]silent) molar ratios versus extent of reaction. Any number less than unity indicates that ultrasound produces less trans-olefin compared to the silent system. An examination of Fig. 4 shows this to be the case for both substrates (cis-1-buten-1-ol and cis-2-penten-1-ol) at all extents of reaction. It is interesting to note that the 2-penten-1-ol system overall has smaller values than for the 2-buten-1-ol system. Furthermore, whereas this ratio quantity increases with extent of reaction for 2-buten-1-ol, it monotonically decreases for 2-penten-1-ol. Part of the rationale for choosing the 2-buten-1-ol and 2-penten-1-ol systems is that the added methyl group of the C5 olefin results in an increase in moment of inertia for this species relative to the C4 olefin. In particular, the approximate moments of inertias [6–8] are I ∼2.5×10−39 gcm2 for the C4 olefin and I ∼3.8×10−39 gcm2 for the C5 olefin assuming that the rotation is about the C2C3 double bond during isomerization. It is interesting to note that the ∼52% increase in C5 versus C4 olefin moment of inertia can be thought of as giving rise to a slower isomerization rate and thus a reduced trans-olefin concentration relative to the C4 olefin (30% less at reaction mid-point). Extrapolation of these ideas suggests a variety of olefins with variable chain lengths could be studied (e.g., C6C18) to determine if a more general law can be found relating the [trans-olefin]/[saturated alcohol] concentration ratio to moment of inertia. Future work is needed in this area. A final issue worthwhile discussing is the role of water in the hydrogenations. It is reasonable to expect that if an enol intermediate could be formed in our reactions, then water would likely play an important role in not only solvation but also in chemistry. However, in our experiments the alcohol moiety is in the C2 position relative to the olefin suggesting an enol intermediate is unlikely. We have not studied solvents other than water, in part because we have found through trial and error that water with inert dopants is easier to cavitate than organic solvents, but nevertheless feel these would be worthwhile investigations. As for actual C18 hydrogenations, we have successfully cavitated (without inert dopants) C18/water (and 75wt.% C18/hexane) systems, and de-emulsified the resulting two-phase system by adding NaCl (enhancing ionic strength of aqueous phase). We feel this would be an actual, plausible, processing methodology. This work is ongoing by our group."
5,Implications,"The following question can be asked in light of our study here: Can partial hydrogenation of edible seed oils as an industrial process ever be viable using cavitating ultrasound processing? Despite this study that suggests that cavitating ultrasound hydrogenation may have advantages over traditional processing methods, we can only make broad predictions extrapolating this work to the partial hydrogenation of actual C18 seed oils. For example, based on the cavitating ultrasound C5 olefin result here that ∼50% hydrogenation occurred at ∼80s, it can be computed that it costs ∼US$ 0.35/lb for 50% hydrogenation (assuming electricity cost is US$ 0.05/kWh and power usage was 280W during treatment). Therefore, assuming similar costs for C18 seed oils, from an economic perspective the cost is likely not prohibitive. A second issue is the catalytic selectivity towards hydrogenation relative to isomerization (to the trans-olefin). Here, as an example, if we consider isomerization about the C9 position in linoleic acid there would be a roughly ∼6.1-fold increase in moment of inertia here versus our C5 olefin [6–8], which from our result comparing our C4 and C5 olefins here suggests there would be an approximate 3.5-fold decrease in trans-olefin production in linoleic acid using cavitating ultrasound. For comparable amounts of hydrogenated (e.g., saturated alcohol) and trans-olefin content in our C5 experiment this indicates that for a C18 seed oil there would still be ∼18% [trans-olefin/hydrogenated species] content at reaction mid-point. This is likely still too much isomerization, thus improvements beyond the effects seen here would need to be seen in ongoing research of cavitating ultrasound chemical processing. For example, the effect of cavitating ultrasound processing could be investigated for precious metals on basic supports which are thought to offer reduced, but favorable, [trans-olefin]/[saturated alcohol] ratios."
