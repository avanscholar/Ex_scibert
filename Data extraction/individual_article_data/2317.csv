0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenolysis of C–OH bonds is a very important synthetic technique; it is widely used in organic synthesis [1–3], pharmaceutical production [3–5] and biomass conversion [6–8]. Conventionally, hydrogenolysis of C–OH bond is achieved with molecular hydrogen using noble metals as catalysts. In some cases, stoichiometric reducing agents such as metal hydrides are used. Nevertheless, these traditional hydrogenolysis methods have some drawbacks. One drawback is the use of molecular hydrogen or stoichiometric reducing agents that often causes safety and environmental problems, because molecular hydrogen and metal hydrides are flammable, explosive and hazardous. Another drawback is the use of high temperature and high-pressure that will necessitate expensive high-pressure equipment, thereby increasing the cost of the process and resulting in many troubles in manipulation. An additional drawback is its low selectivity due to the hash reaction conditions employed. In contrast to the traditional hydrogenolysis methods, catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (CTH) uses hydrogen donors to provide hydrogen species in situ; hence it offers the possibility to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional hydrogenolysis methods. From the viewpoint of green chemistry [9], CTH is superior to traditional hydrogenolysis methods because of its safety, simplicity, high selectivity and low environmental impact. α-Methylbenzyl alcohol (MBA) is often used as one of the model compounds to study the hydrogenolysis of C–OH bond [10]. It is also an intermediate in the production of propylene oxide (PO) employing the ethylbenzene hydroperoxide (EBHP)-oxidation process (Scheme 1 ) [11,12]. This process uses ethylbenzene (EB) as raw material. In the first step, EB is peroxidized to EBHP. Then, PO is obtained by the epoxidation of propylene with EBHP. During the epoxidation step, EBHP turns into MBA, which can be hydrogenolyzed to EB. Integration of the three steps can realize the production of PO by a recycling process. The hydrogenolysis of MBA is the key step to achieve the above-mentioned recycling process. Therefore, several groups have extensively studied in this reaction [11–15]. For example, Schram and Wattimena [11] described a method of hydrogenolysis of MBA using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at a high temperature up to 450°C and a pressure of 4MPa. Sanders et al. [13] reported that MBA can be converted to EB with a low selectivity (21.0%) at 100°C over Pt/TiO2 catalyst. Recently, Kwark et al. [12] developed a metal-acid bifunctional catalyst system; however, styrene was always formed as a by-product in the hydrogenolysis process. Sato et al. [15] studied the hydrogenolysis of MBA with several noble metal catalysts in supercritical carbon dioxide medium at a total pressure of 12MPa. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, the CTH of MBA has not been systematically studied. Therefore, in this paper, we report for the first time the CTH of MBA using palladium catalysts and formic acid (Scheme 2 ). Under mild conditions, MBA can be completely hydrogenolyzed to EB almost without any by-products. This methodology offers considerable advantages over the traditional methods as neither hydrogen containment nor a pressure vessel is required."
1,Experimental,"The supported palladium catalysts (4wt%), including Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3 (γ-alumina), Pd/NaY, Pd/SiO2 and Pd/TiO2 were obtained from Institute of Homogenous Catalysis, Sichuan University. MBA (97%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Formic acid, formate salts and other chemicals were commercially available and were used as received. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a DX-2500 (Dandong) X-ray diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 25mA. The mean Pd particle sizes of the catalysts were determined by XRD using the Scherrer equation. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out on a homemade apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The samples were firstly flushed with argon (20mL/min) at 700°C for 1h, and then cooled to room temperature. Adsorption of ammonia was carried out at 50°C for 1h in a flow of 3% NH3 in argon (20mL/min). After that, flowing argon (20mL/min) was introduced and the desorption of ammonia was performed at a heating rate of 8°C/min. BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured on an auto adsorption/desorption analyzer (ZXF-6, Northwest Chemical Industry) using nitrogen as adsorbate. The CTH of MBA was carried out in a 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a water-cooled condenser and a magnetic stirrer. To the flask were added 10mL of ethanol, an appropriate amount of water, 1.5mmol of MBA, a certain amount of hydrogen donor and 0.2g of palladium catalyst. The reactor was placed in a preheated oil bath and maintained at a desired temperature in the atmosphere. Aliquots (0.1mL) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at regular intervals, quenched, and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (EC™-WAX, 30 m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The products were also identified by GC–MS (Agilent 6890-5973N) by comparison with authentic samples. The selectivity of each product is determined as carbon selectivity; the details are similar to those described elsewhere [16]."
2,Results and discussion,"Previous studies using traditional methods have shown that palladium is the most effective catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of C–OH bonds in benzylic alcohols [1,12,15]. Unlike the rhodium, ruthenium or platinum catalysts, palladium barely leads to the hydrogenation of aromatic rings in the substrate. In this work, we have also compared the catalytic performance of several metal catalysts, including Rh/C, Ru/C, Pt/C, Ir/C and Pd/C. The results (not shown here) are similar to those reported in the traditional hydrogenolysis studies; namely, palladium is also a good catalyst for the CTH of C–OH bonds."
3,Effect of support,"3.1 Effect of support We first performed the CTH of MBA in the presence of several supported palladium catalysts; the results are shown in Fig. 1 . Among the tested palladium catalysts, Pd/C exhibited the highest conversion of MBA (98.8%) and the highest selectivity to EB (98.8%). Pd/Al2O3 also showed high activity, but the selectivity to EB was not so high (76.5%). For Pd/SiO2 and Pd/TiO2, very low conversions of MBA (<20.0%) and low selectivities to EB (<70.0%) were observed. In the presence of Pd/NaY, the conversion level was low, whereas the selectivity to EB was high (92.7%). In the traditional hydrogenolysis of MBA, Kwak et al. found that the catalytic performance of different palladium catalysts is mainly related to the surface acidity of the support [12]. Therefore, we characterized our catalysts by the NH3-TPD technique to study their acid properties. Fig. 2 shows the NH3-TPD spectra of the palladium catalysts used in our study. In the case of Pd/SiO2, three peaks at 167, 340 and 532°C are detected. The Pd/NaY catalyst shows two peaks at 190 and 281°C, respectively. The spectrum of Pd/Al2O3 exhibits three peaks at 171, 264 and 490°C. For Pd/C, a main peak at 255°C is obtained. Pd/TiO2 has two weak peaks at 215 and 650°C. In the NH3-TPD curves, peaks are generally divided into two regions: low temperature (T <400°C) region and high temperature (T >400°C) region [17]. The peaks in the low temperature region are assigned as the desorption of ammonia from weak acid sites, while the peaks in the high temperature region are ascribed to the desorption of ammonia from strong acid sites. As shown in Fig. 2, all the palladium catalysts have weak acid sites, but only Pd/SiO2, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/TiO2 have strong acid sites. According to the intensity in the spectra, the acid density (i.e. the amount of acid sites) of the catalysts decrease in the order Pd/SiO2 >Pd/NaY>Pd/Al2O3 >Pd/C>Pd/TiO2. Combined with the results in Fig. 1, these facts suggest that strong acid sites in the catalyst favor the formation of the by-product acetophenone (AP, in the case of Pd/SiO2, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/TiO2). Catalysts with few or no strong acid sites, such as Pd/C and Pd/NaY, result in high selectivity to EB. The different catalytic activity of the palladium catalysts can be related to the acid density in the catalysts. The high catalytic activities of Pd/C and Pd/Al2O3 indicate that the CTH of MBA is more active when a catalyst with moderate acid density is used. In order to get more insights into the relations between the catalytic performance and the catalyst structure, we also characterized the palladium catalysts by XRD and BET techniques. Some characterization results are shown for comparison in Table 1 . The mean Pd particle sizes of these catalysts are all in nanosize, but no clear correlations can be observed between the metal particle size and the catalytic performance. Similar unclear relations can be observed between the BET surface area of the catalysts and the catalytic property. These results are in agreement with those reported in the studies on CTH of 2-phenyl-2-propanol and on hydrogenolysis of glycerol [16,18]."
4,Effect of hydrogen donor,"3.2 Effect of hydrogen donor Table 2 shows the hydrogen-donating abilities of formic acid and its salts in the CTH of MBA over Pd/C catalyst. From the standpoint of green chemistry, HCOOH and formate salts are better hydrogen donors than other compounds such as 2-propanol and hydrazine [19]. In the reaction process, a stable molecule, i.e. CO2, is released from the hydrogen donor. In other words, HCOOH and formate salts can function as a hydride donor under irreversible conditions [20]. As shown in Table 2, HCOOH is an excellent hydrogen donor for the CTH of MBA, resulting in very high conversion of MBA (98.8%) and high selectivity to EB (98.8%, entry 2, Table 2). In contrast, formate salts show poor performance in the reaction, with low conversion levels and low selectivities to EB (entries 3–6, Table 2). For comparison, without the addition of any hydrogen donors, MBA can also be hydrogenolyzed to EB with moderate activity; however, the main product is AP (entry 1, Table 2). We can conclude from Table 2 that only HCOOH can accelerate the CTH of MBA, while the formate salts may even poison the catalyst. Interestingly, either HCOOH or formate salts can increase the selectivity to EB as compared with that of the reaction without any hydrogen donors. Rajagopal and Spatola studied the CTH of benzyl acetate and found that the hydrogen-donating abilities of HCOOH and its salts were associated with the cation (H+, Li+, Na+, K+ and NH4 +) of the formates [19]. In this study, we also believe that the different catalytic performances of HCOOH and its salts are related to the cation; the details will be discussed later. It is worth noting that the CTH of MBA can also proceed without the addition of hydrogen donor (entry 1, Table 2). This is due to the fact that MBA can act both as a hydrogen donor and as a reactant, leading to the possibility of the disproportionation-type reaction (Scheme 3 ) [21,22]. The formation of AP is attributed to the dehydrogenation of MBA when the hydrogen species are stripped from the donor over the catalyst. This has been clearly verified by Keresszegi et al. in their studies on the catalytic transfer dehydrogenation of MBA [21]."
5,Effect of molar ratio of HCOOH to MBA,"3.3 Effect of molar ratio of HCOOH to MBA The molar ratio of HCOOH to MBA has an effect on the CTH of MBA. Table 3 shows that both the reaction rate and the selectivity to EB increase with increasing molar ratio of HCOOH to MBA, while a contrary trend is found for the selectivity to AP. When the molar ratio of HCOOH to MBA is 2, EB can be obtained in a high yield up to 97.6% (entry 3, Table 3). However, as the ratio increased from 2 to 4, the catalytic performance changed slightly (entries 3–5, Table 3), indicating that the CTH of MBA only needs to be carried out at a low dosage of hydrogen donor. An advantage of this is that the possible esterification side reaction between MBA and HCOOH can be avoided."
6,Effect of water content,"3.4 Effect of water content Water is an important co-solvent in the CTH of benzyl esters and aryl halides using HCOOH and formate salts as hydrogen donors [19,20]. The effect of water content on the CTH of MBA is shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion of MBA remarkably increased when water was added in the reaction system. The reaction nearly completed as more than 2mL of water was used. This is because increasing the water amount makes the ionizability of HCOOH increase, and consequently results in the formation of more active hydrogen species. As the amount of water increased from 0 to 10mL, the selectivity to EB initially exhibited an increase, ultimately reached a maximum at a water dosage of 2mL, after which the selectivity to EB began to decrease. High water content seems to favor the transfer dehydrogenation of MBA, resulting in the enhancement in the selectivity to AP and the decrease in the selectivity to EB."
7,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.5 Effect of reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature was also studied (Fig. 4 ). As expected, the reaction rate increases with increasing reaction temperature. As the temperature elevated from 20 to 80°C, there was a uniform increase in the MBA conversion from 14.3 to 98.8%. The selectivity to EB changed slightly when the reaction temperature increased from 20 to 50°C, while it dramatically increased at a temperature higher than 60°C. It should be noted that the selectivity to EB reached 98.8% at 80°C with a high conversion level (98.8%). The high selectivity to EB is of great importance because it will enable the recycling process of PO production to become really feasible and quite simple. It seems that the formation rate of AP was lowered as the reaction temperature was raised. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: the increase in the reaction temperature is in favor of the formation of active hydrogen species, i.e. [Pd]H− (the details will be discussed later), which can promote the formation rate of EB, while decreasing the formation rate of AP."
8,Catalyst recycling,"3.6 Catalyst recycling To evaluate the catalyst life and the deactivation behavior, we used the Pd/C catalyst repeatedly five times. After each experiment, the catalyst was separated by filtration. As shown in Fig. 5 , the Pd/C catalyst could be reused for four times in the CTH reaction without obvious loss of catalytic activity. The selectivity to EB was still higher than 97.0% after five times of recycling experiments. The decrease in MBA conversion at the fifth run is mainly because of the loss of catalyst in the recycling process. After five recycles, the catalyst was filtrated and dried. The recovery ratio of the used catalyst was about 89.5%."
9,Reaction mechanism,"3.7 Reaction mechanism As has been noted above, HCOOH is far superior to formate salts as a hydrogen donor for the CTH of MBA. This inspires us to get more insights into the reaction mechanism, so as to find the reasons for the excellent performance of HCOOH. It has been demonstrated that the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ester is easier than that of benzyl alcohol in the traditional hydrogenolysis process using molecular hydrogen [23]. In this study, a small amount of α-methylbenzyl formate is detected in the products. Therefore, a possible reaction pathway is one that proceeds via the formation of an ester intermediate, i.e. α-methylbenzyl formate, followed by further CTH to yield EB. Rajagopal and Spatola have systematically studied the CTH of benzyl ester and have elucidated that formate salts are better hydrogen donors than HCOOH [19,20]. In the CTH of benzyl acetate, using HCOOLi as hydrogen donor, the reaction rate is faster than that of HCOOH. Hence, if α-methylbenzyl formate is a necessary intermediate for the proceeding of the CTH of MBA, the reaction rate ought to get more faster when HCOOLi is added in the system employing HCOOH as hydrogen donor. In contrast to the hypothesis based on Rajagopal's investigation, a suppressive effect was found in the case of adding HCOOLi to the HCOOH system. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , the addition of HCOOLi to the HCOOH system results in a decrease in the reaction rate, indicating that the formation of an ester intermediate is not necessary for the reaction. Previous studies have elucidated that HCOO− is necessary for the CTH of benzyl esters and benzylic alcohols using HCOOH and its salts as hydrogen donor [18–20]. The active hydrogen species are dissociated from the adsorbed formyloxy ions on the palladium catalyst. In our study, both HCOOH and formate salts can afford enough HCOO− ions in the water–ethanol solvent, whereas only HCOOH shows excellent performance. This encourages us to believe that H+ ion plays an important role in the CTH of MBA using HCOOH as hydrogen donor. Therefore, the verifying experiments were carried out in which some acids were added to the CTH system using HCOOLi as hydrogen donor. The time-conversion profiles for reactions with and without the addition of acids are depicted in Fig. 6. The reaction took about only 50min for completion when HCOOH was used as hydrogen donor, while the reaction rate was very slow in the case of HCOOLi. The addition of an acid (H3BO3, HCOOH and HCl) to the HCOOLi system remarkably accelerated the reaction rate. In the case of the addition of HCl (3mmol), the reaction had nearly completed after 2h. However, such a study may not be very informative since HCOOLi (a salt of weak acid and strong base) can react with HCl (strong acid) to form HCOOH and LiCl. When an equal amount of HCOOH was added, the reaction rate also increased. More valuable information can be obtained from the addition of H3BO3, because H3BO3 is an inorganic acid whose acidity is weaker than that of HCOOH and H3BO3 cannot react with MBA to form an ester. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the reaction rate obviously increased as 6mmol of H3BO3 was added in the HCOOLi system. The above descriptions clearly indicate that H+ ions play an important role in the CTH of MBA. In addition, we also have performed the reactions wherein HCl or H2SO4 was added to the HCOOH system (the details are not shown here). Unfortunately, large amounts of ester products are formed because the esterification reaction can be catalyzed by strong acids such as HCl and H2SO4. Furthermore, the CTH reaction rate decreases in the presence of HCl or H2SO4. This is attributed to the fact that a strong acid can suppress the dissociation of HCOOH, thereby depleting the concentration of HCOO− ions [20]. Taken together, we can reasonably conclude that: (1) HCOO− ion is a necessary precursor for the CTH of MBA and (2) H+ ion has a significant effect on the reaction and plays an important role in the reaction process. Based on the results and discussion above, a mechanism has been proposed for the Pd/C-catalyzed CTH of MBA using HCOOH as hydrogen donor. For convenience, the catalyst Pd/C is denoted as [Pd0]. As presented in the middle and right circles in Scheme 4 , HCOOH is reversibly ionized to HCOO− and H+ in the reaction medium. Adsorption of HCOO− ions on the active palladium sites forms the species which can dissociate into [Pd]H− and CO2. Simultaneously, H+ protonates the hydroxy group of MBA, resulting in a readily leaving group O+H2, followed by cleavage of the C–O bond to produce a carbonium ion. Finally, the carbonium ion reacts with [Pd]H− to form EB. Similar to the CTH process of benzyl esters [19], the dissociative chemisorption of HCOO− is the rate-limiting step in the overall process. Because the active hydrogen species, i.e. [Pd]H−, react with the carbonium ions very rapidly, the dissociation of HCOO− tend to proceed more easily. This can be responsible for the excellent performance of HCOOH when it is used as hydrogen donor. Although formate salts can even dissociate more HCOO− ions than HCOOH, it only leads to the formation of adsorbed HCOO− species. The dissociative chemisorption of HCOO− seems difficult, since the consuming of [Pd]H− is few and slow when formate salts are used as hydrogen donors. In the absence of an added hydrogen donor, the reaction occurs in the pathway as depicted in the left circle in Scheme 4. This catalytic cycle is adjusted loosely according to Scheme 3. In this case, MBA acts both as a hydrogen donor and as a reactant, resulting in the formation of AP. Combined with the results listed in Table 2, the CTH of MBA mainly takes place in the left circle pathway when formate salts are used as hydrogen donor. Blocking of active sites by the alkali metal cations or NH4 + is a feasible explanation to account for the suppressive effect of formate salts."
10,Conclusions,"The catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of α-methylbenzyl alcohol was studied for the first time using palladium catalysts and formic acid. Pd/C is the most effective catalyst for the reaction. Formic acid is far superior to formate salts as a hydrogen donor, due to the fact that the dissociated H+ ions promote the formation of active hydrogen species. Under mild reaction conditions, MBA can completely transfer hydrogenolyzed to ethylbenzene almost without any by-products. From a practical point of view, this study may open the way to a new approach for the production of propylene oxide."
