0,Introduction,
1,Non-renewable energy sources,"1.1 Non-renewable energy sources Fossil fuels as their names exhibit are consisted of high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum, and natural gas (Eisenberg and Nocera, 2007; Kamat, 2007). Fossil fuels are producing significant amounts of energy per unit weight and because of this reason, they are very important. They are named as non-renewable energy resources because it will take millions of years for them to form, and the depletion and extraction of accumulation is faster than making of them. The production and use of fossil fuels increased environmental concerns."
2,Hydrogen,"1.2 Hydrogen Recently interest in alternative fuels like hydrogen, which is one of the great alternative, renewable energy sources, has been established (Goltsov et al., 2006; Ni et al., 2006a, 2006b). There are many different methods and various kinds of sources that can produce hydrogen (Marshall et al., 2007; Navarro et al., 2007). Industrial production of hydrogen is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water (Wang et al., 2008; Vizcaino et al., 2007; Haryanto et al., 2005; Breen et al., 2002). By using the steam reforming method, the toxic and greenhouse gases like carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide produces which are corrosive and a large amount of energy is needed (Itoh, 2003; Kariya et al., 2003; Yolcular and Olgun, 2008). Because of these bad effects of steam reforming method, the alternative method is the dehydrogenation of organic hydrocarbons with high amount of hydrogen content. This method has many advantages like: The only products of this method are hydrogen and dehydrogenated hydrocarbons, no toxic, corrosive and greenhouse gas is formed, because this method is reversible, the products can be hydrogenated and regenerated again and finally, because no by-products such as carbon monoxide has formed, the purification of hydrogen is not needed (Khademi et al., 2009a,b; Rahimpour and Asgari, 2009)."
3,Coupling reactors,"1.3 Coupling reactors Chemical engineering focused on making the processes more efficient and reducing the cost and bad environmental effects of the processes. One of the processes for improving the efficiency and reducing the costs is coupling of endothermic and exothermic reactions through them; the heat that released from the exothermic reaction is the driving force for proceeding of the endothermic reaction (Zanfir and Gavriilidis, 2001; Dautzenberg and Mukherjee, 2001). There are many publications on coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions in a reactor (Kolios et al., 2002; Moustafa and Elnashaie, 2000; Ramaswamy et al., 2008). Abo-Ghander et al. (2008) coupled the endothermic reaction with the exothermic reaction by using no direct heat transfer. Itoh and Wu (1997) suggested an adiabatic type of palladium membrane reactor for coupling endothermic and exothermic reactions. Elnashaie et al. (2000) studied a heterogeneous model to study the performance of the catalytic membrane reactor for the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene. Altimari and Bildea (2009) designed plant systems, which are including coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions. Ramaswamy et al. (2006) have analyzed the steady state and the dynamic behavior of coupling exothermic and endothermic reactions in directly coupled adiabatic packed-bed reactors for the first order reactions using one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous plug flow model. Khademi et al. (2009a,b) optimized methanol synthesis and cyclohexane dehydrogenation in a thermally coupled reactor by using differential evolution method. Additionally Khademi et al. (2010) presented a mathematical model for thermally coupled hydrogen-perm selective membrane reactor that is composed of three sides for synthesis of methanol and benzene. Glockler et al. (2009) optimized the reactor design for coupling the exothermic and endothermic reactions in a fixed bed reactor. Rahimpour et al. (2011) have studied theoretically hydrogen production from coupling of methanol synthesis and cyclohexane dehydrogenation in hydrogen perm-selective membrane and dual membrane thermally coupled reactor. Rahimpour and Pourazadi (2010) compared co-current and counter-current patterns in a thermally coupled membrane reactor in which, the heat that is required for the endothermic reaction of benzene production is provided from exothermic reaction of methanol synthesis. Vakili et al. (2011) investigated dimethylether synthesis directly in a thermally coupled heat exchanger reactor. Farsi et al. (2011) and Farsi and Jahanmiri (2011), investigated simulation and optimization of DME production and cyclohexane dehydrogenation in a thermally coupled dual membrane reactor and suggested the optimum conditions for hydrogen synthesis from coupling of DME and benzene production processes."
4,Cyclohexane and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane,"1.4 Cyclohexane and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane Cyclohexane is used as a nonpolar solvent in the chemical industry. In the industrial scale, reaction of aromatic compounds like benzene with hydrogen produces cyclohexane. Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is the reverse reaction of benzene production, which is an endothermic reaction, which its products are hydrogen and benzene. The heat that is required for this endothermic reaction is provided from the exothermic reaction (Biniwale et al., 2005, 2008). There exists many ways for benzene production that dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is one of them. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane for producing hydrogen has many advantages in comparison with the other methods such as: the dehydrogenated products like benzene could be generated and recycled, high hydrogen content of cyclohexane that is 7.1 wt.%. This amount of hydrogen content is much higher than metal hydrides, because of high boiling point; it is safer for transportation and storage. There is no carbon dioxide emission in hydrogen production by cyclohexane dehydrogenation that is environmental friendly (Ali et al., 1994; Garcia Villaluenga and Tabe-Mohammadi, 2000). As previously mentioned one or two exothermic reactions can provide the heat that is necessary for the endothermic reaction, which coupled in one reactor."
5,Exothermic reactions,"1.5 Exothermic reactions 1.5.1 DME synthesis DME is a promising fuel in diesel engines, petroleum engines (30% DME-70% LPG), and gas turbines due to its high octane number, which is 55, in comparison with diesels octane number, which is 40–53. Just finite modification is needed to convert a diesel engine to burn DME (Semelsberger et al., 2006; Galvita et al., 2001; Fleisch et al., 1995). Nowadays, by gasification of coal or steam reforming of methane, synthesis gas is produced and then it is converted into methanol in the presence of catalyst that is usually belonging to the copper group. DME is produced with dehydration of methanol in the presence of another different catalyst such as silica-alumina. This process includes two steps that firstly, starts with methanol synthesis and ends with DME synthesis or methanol dehydration (Guo et al., 2000; Arcoumanis et al., 2008; Makarand et al., 1992; Troy et al., 2006; Ng et al., 1999). Alternatively, DME can be produced through direct synthesis. In this process, we can use a dual catalyst system, which allows both methanol synthesis, and methanol dehydration in the same process unit, with no methanol isolation and purification, a procedure that by omitting the intermediate methanol synthesis stage, yields more efficiency and low cost. The two-steps process is widely used and more applicable than other method because it is relatively simple and start-up costs are relatively low (Lu et al., 2004; Rahimpour et al., 2008). 1.5.2 Methanol Methanol has many applications like using as a solvent, using as a hydrate inhibitor in pipelines, using as antifreeze and using as a fuel. Methanol is clean burning fuel with many applications (Rahimpour et al., 2005; Lovik et al., 1998; Semelsberger et al., 2006; Rahimpour et al., 1998). Firstly, methanol was produced as a byproduct of the mortal distillation of wood and because of that, it was named as wood alcohol. In advanced case, methanol is produced directly in a catalytic industrial process from synthesis gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The synthesis gases react over a catalyst to produce methanol. Nowadays, the most applicable catalyst is a mixture of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and alumina. An alternative process instead of production of methanol from synthesis gas is the direct catalytic conversion of methane to methanol by using Cu-Zeolites or other catalysts (Rezaie et al., 2005; Rahimpour and Ghader, 2003; Amandusson et al., 2001)."
6,Membrane,"1.6 Membrane Recently, membranes are used to improve the yield and selectivity of reactions. Membranes have some advantages like: • Membranes are less energy-intensive, since they do not require major phase changes. • Do not require adsorbents or solvents, which may be expensive or difficult to handle. • Equipment simplicity and modularity, which facilitates the incorporation of more efficient membranes. • They provide low maintenance operation. 1.6.1 Pd/Ag membrane The most widely used application of membrane in separation of gases is the separation of hydrogen from nitrogen, argon and methane in the ammonia purge gas stream. The Palladium membrane is commonly a metallic tube, which is consisted of palladium and silver alloy material. This characteristic gives the membrane the unique property that only allows the monatomic hydrogen gas to pass through the membrane crystal lattice when it is heated above 300 °C. Because of this membrane property, this type of membrane is mostly used in dehydrogenation of organic compounds and in hydrogen purifying (Shu et al., 1991). By eliminating the hydrogen by means of Pd/Ag membrane through the reversible reaction, the reaction is shifted toward the product side. Shu and coworkers have investigated the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions on Pd/Ag membrane (Uemiya et al., 1991). In Pd/Ag membrane, the hydrogen permeability in the membrane increases by increasing silver content until it reaches its maximum permeability that is about 23 wt.% Ag (Graaf et al., 1988)."
7,Objective,"1.7 Objective The aim is study is theoretical investigation of employing Pd/Ag membranes for increasing performance of a thermally double coupled reactor. In fact, the new idea of this work is coupling two exothermic reactions with one endothermic reaction and using two Pd/Ag membranes for improving methanol, DME and hydrogen production. Two Pd/Ag membranes are used for improving the efficiency of hydrogen production and other products in exothermic sides by separation of hydrogen from unconverted outputs of exothermic sides that are recycled to the reactor. In fact by addition of hydrogen to methanol and DME synthesis sides, reversible reactions are shifted to front along to reactor axes. Therefore unconverted hydrogen at the output of exothermic sides of thermally double coupled reactor can be recycled to the reactor for increasing methanol, DME and hydrogen production by employing Pd/Ag membranes in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. A steady state heterogeneous catalytic reaction model is applied to analyze the performance of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and comparison of the result with corresponding predictions for an industrial methanol reactor, thermally coupled reactor (coupling of methanol synthesis with cyclohexane dehydrogenation only) and thermally double coupled reactor."
8,Process description,
9,Conventional methanol synthesis reactor,2.1 Conventional methanol synthesis reactor Conventional methanol synthesis reactor is consisted of a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. The vertical tubes are packed with CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and in their surroundings is boiling water. The synthesis gas is entering the tubes from top of the reactor and methanol synthesis reactions occur. The heat of this exothermic reaction that produced is transferred to the boiling water and steam is produced. The catalyst characteristics and the conventional methanol reactor specifications are exhibited in Table 1 .
10,Thermally coupled reactor,"2.2 Thermally coupled reactor In the thermally coupled reactor dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene is used in the shell side instead of using cooling water. The heat is transferred from exothermic reaction (methanol production) to the endothermic reaction (cyclohexane dehydrogenation) continuously, and the total feed flow rate of endothermic side is equal to 0.1 mol s−1 (Khademi et al., 2009a,b)."
11,Thermally double coupled reactor,"2.3 Thermally double coupled reactor Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the thermally double coupled reactor in co-current mode. Thermally double coupled reactor is a multi tubular reactor and consisted of 2962 three concentric tubes. In the central tube, the endothermic reaction, which is dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, received the heat from two exothermic reactions of methanol and DME synthesis, which have taken place in the inner and outer tubes respectively. DME synthesis reactions occur over catalyst of conventional methanol reactor (Cu/Zn/Al2O3) and dehydration of methanol process (γ-Al2O3). In addition, Pt/Al2O3 is used as a catalyst for dehydrogenation of cyclohexane reaction. The properties and input data of thermally double coupled reactor are showed in Tables 2 and 3 . The other properties of thermally double coupled reactor related to methanol synthesis process are the same as conventional methanol reactor. In this configuration, three reactions have done in a proper temperature range to have proper thermal couple."
12,Thermally double coupled two-membrane reactor,"2.4 Thermally double coupled two-membrane reactor Thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is a multi tubular reactor and consisted of 2962 three concentric tubes with two membrane that covered inside and outsides of each three concentric tubes. A schematic diagram of one three concentric tubes with covered membrane inside and outside of it in co-current mode is showed in Fig. 2 . For better explanation of this configuration, Fig. 3 represents a differential element along the axial direction of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor with direction of heat and mass transfer. Two Pd/Ag membranes separate hydrogen from recycled gases and hydrogen are added in exothermic sides for shifting reversible reactions to front. Pressure of recycle streams is increased to 90 bar by using compressors. The pressure of recycle stream should be sufficient because the driving force for hydrogen separation in Pd/Ag membranes is temperature difference. The properties and input data of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor are similar to thermally double coupled reactor."
13,Reaction scheme and kinetics,
14,Direct DME synthesis (exothermic reaction),"3.1 Direct DME synthesis (exothermic reaction) The reactions in DME production from synthesis gas are: production of methanol from CO and CO2 and dehydration of methanol as follows (Vakili et al., 2011): (1) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH Δ H 298 K = − 90.55 kJ / mol (2) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 49.43 kJ / mol (3) 2 CH 3 OH ↔ CH 3 OCH 3 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 21.003 kJ / mol These reactions are taken happened over a catalyst that contains two active sites; one is applied for methanol synthesis and the other one for DME formation. The reaction rates of direct DME synthesis are as follow: (4) r CO = k 1 f CO f H 2 2 ( 1 − β 1 ) ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 + K H 2 f H 2 ) 3 (5) r CO 2 = k 2 f CO 2 f H 2 3 ( 1 − β 2 ) ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 + K H 2 f H 2 ) 4 (6) r DME = k 3 f CH 3 OH ( 1 − β 3 ) ( 1 + K CH 3 OH f CH 3 OH ) 2 (7) β 1 = f CH 3 OH K f 1 f CO f H 2 2 (8) β 2 = f CH 3 OH f H 2 O K f 2 f CO 2 f H 2 3 (9) β 3 = f DME f H 2 O K f 3 f CH 3 OH 2 In the above equations, f i and K f i represent the fugacity of component i and equilibrium constant of reaction i respectively. The kinetic parameters are exhibited in Table 4 ."
15,Methanol production reaction (exothermic reaction),"3.2 Methanol production reaction (exothermic reaction) In methanol synthesis reaction, three equilibrium reactions take place simultaneously: (10) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH Δ H 298 K = 90.55 kJ / mol (11) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = 49.43 kJ / mol (12) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = 41.12 kJ / mol In this work, methanol synthesis reaction kinetic parameters are taken from Graaf et al. (1999). This kinetic model can be used in the temperature range of 495–533 K and pressure range of 5–8 MPa. The rates of reactions for methanol synthesis are: (13) r 1 = k 1 K CO [ f CO f H 2 3 / 2 − f CH 3 OH / f H 2 1 / 2 K P 1 ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f H 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 1 / 2 ) f H 2 O ] (14) r 2 = k 2 K CO 2 [ f CO f H 2 3 / 2 − f CH 3 OH f H 2 O / f H 2 3 / 2 K P 2 ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 1 / 2 ) f H 2 O ] (15) r 3 = k 3 K CO 2 [ f CO 2 f H 2 − f H 2 O f CO / K P 3 ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f H 2 1 / 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 1 / 2 ) f H 2 O ] Table 5 exhibits the reaction rate constants, the adsorption equilibrium constants and the reaction equilibrium constants for methanol synthesis."
16,Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (endothermic side),"3.3 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (endothermic side) The reaction dehydrogenation of cyclohexane reaction is as follows (Farsi et al., 2011): (16) C 6 H 12 ↔ C 6 H 6 + 3 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 206.2 kJ / mol In this case, the following rate equation is used for the above equation: (17) r C = − k ( K P P C / P H 2 3 − P B ) 1 + ( K B K P P C / P H 2 3 ) Where k, K B , K P are the reaction rate constant, the adsorption equilibrium constant and the reaction equilibrium constant respectively which are showed in Table 6 . P i is the partial pressure of component i in Pa. The temperature range of the reaction is 423–523 K."
17,Pd/Ag membrane,"3.4 Pd/Ag membrane For estimating the hydrogen flux, Equation (18) can be used, which in this equation; the hydrogen flux is a function of diffusivity, membrane thickness and hydrogen partial pressure (Barbieri and Maio, 1997; Lindsay and Bromley, 1950). (18) J H 2 = Q 0 exp ( − E H 2 R T ) δ H 2 ( P H 2 Tube − P H 2 Shell ) Q 0 = 1.65 e − 5 mol m − 1 s − 1 kPa − 1 2 , E H 2 = 15.7 kJ mol − 1"
18,Mathematical model,The one-dimensional heterogeneous catalytic reaction model for mathematical modeling of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is based on the following assumptions: • It is assumed that this model is to be at steady-state conditions. • Ideal gas phase. • Plug flow mode is applied in each side of reaction. • Constant bed porosity in axial and radial directions. The differential equations which are describing mole and energy balances in the axial direction of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor for all sides are exhibited in Table 7 .
19,Auxiliary correlations,"4.1 Auxiliary correlations For solving of mentioned set of differential equations, auxiliary correlations including physical properties of components, mass and heat transfer coefficients, and the Ergun equation should have been listed in Table 8 ."
20,Numerical solution,"4.2 Numerical solution The proposed model is consisted of the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) resulted from mass and energy conservation rules as well as non-linear algebraic equations of the kinetic model, auxiliary and hydrodynamic correlations. Backward finite difference calculation is applied for solving set of ODEs. Hence, the ODEs are changed into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The length of each reactor is divided to 100 distinct segments and the Gauss–Newton method is used to solve the obtained set of non-linear algebraic equations in each segment for both sides, simultaneously. This procedure is repeated for all nodes in the reactor that the results of each node are used as the inlet conditions for the following node."
21,Model validation,4.3 Model validation Model validation has been carried out by comparison between the simulation results and conventional methanol synthesis reactor in industrial scale by Rahimpour et al. (2011) fortunately; very good agreement was achieved between proposed model and experimental plant data showing feasibility of this novel process.
22,Result and discussions,"In this part of paper, the results of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor simulation with the validated conventional methanol reactor, thermally coupled reactor in which methanol synthesis is coupled with cyclohexane dehydrogenation only and thermally double coupled reactor have been compared. The following results will exhibit the various observed behaviors of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor by some figures. In order to calculate methanol and hydrogen yields as well as cyclohexane and carbon monoxide conversions in DME production side, following definitions have been used: (29) Hydrogen recovery yield = F H 2 , out F C 6 H 12 , in (30) Methanol yield = F CH 3 OH , out F CO + F CO 2 , in (31) Cyclohexane conversion = F C 6 H 12 , in − F C 6 H 12 , out F C 6 H 12 , in (32) CO conversion = F CO , in − F CO , out F CO , in"
23,Molar behavior,"5.1 Molar behavior Fig. 4(a) shows the products mole fractions of methanol synthesis side, which are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water and methanol that pass through inner side of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. The results show that hydrogen has the highest mole fraction profile. The mole fractions of components in DME synthesis versus reactor length are plotted in Fig. 4(b). As this plot shows, hydrogen has the highest profile like Fig. 4(a) because hydrogen is added along reactor axes in exothermic sides with Pd/Ag membranes. Fig. 4(c) is the plot of components mole fractions in endothermic side; cyclohexane, hydrogen and benzene. The hydrogen mole fraction profile is above the benzene mole fraction profile because of its higher stoichiometric coefficient in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction."
24,Thermal behavior,"5.2 Thermal behavior Fig. 5(a) exhibits the temperature profile of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor in the three sides. Generated heat of both exothermic sides (methanol and DME syntheses) is used for proceeding endothermic reaction as well as heating the mixtures of all three sides. As shown in this figure, both exothermic profiles have approximately the same manner, above the endothermic one. Also temperature variation of membrane inside and outside flow are near methanol and DME production respectively. Temperature reduction in the second half of exothermic sides is decreasing rate of reversible reactions due to equilibrium conditions, Therefore temperature of endothermic side decreases slightly along reactor axes. Temperature of DME side is lower than methanol side due to greater area contact of DME side with endothermic side. At the entrance of the thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, generated heat is less than consumed heat leading to temperature of endothermic side to fall and a cold spot developed. Fig. 5(b–d) illustrates the temperature profiles of methanol synthesis, DME synthesis and cyclohexane dehydrogenation for various types of coupling reactors and conventional one. Results show that temperature of methanol production in conventional methanol reactor is higher than coupled reactor due to more transferring heat to endothermic side in comparison with boiling water. It must be noted that in thermally coupled reactors, another products such as benzene, hydrogen and DME are produce but in conventional methanol reactor only steam is produced. For DME side, temperature of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is more than thermally double coupled reactor because of addition of hydrogen with membranes increases heat generation by far out of chemical equilibrium in reversible reactions. Therefore endothermic side in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is received more heat compared with thermally coupled reactor and thermally double coupled reactor and temperature of it is highest (see Fig. 5(c)). For better explanation of this subject, Figs. 6–9 present the heat generation and consumption for exothermic and endothermic sides of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 for methanol production, heat generation in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is bigger than thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor due to higher temperature and higher rate of methanol production in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor compared to thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor (rate behavior has been illustrated in next part of paper). Fig. 7 exhibits the heat of DME reactor in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and thermally double coupled reactor. As this figure presents the heat generation of DME production in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is much larger than thermally double coupled reactor because temperature and rate of reactions in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is higher. Fig. 8 displays the heat consumption of cyclohexane dehydrogenation process for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor. As the results explain the heat consumption of dehydrogenation process for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is larger than thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor. This subject is due to higher temperature and rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. Fig. 9 illustrates the heat of three sides of the reactors. As the results display the generated heat of DME side is larger than methanol side and summation of generated heat is more than consumed heat in cyclohexane dehydrogenation side."
25,Rate behavior,"5.3 Rate behavior Fig. 10(a) demonstrates variations in rates of CO hydrogenation, CO2 hydrogenation and water gas shift in methanol synthesis side of thermally coupled reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. Results show that rate of reactions in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is more than thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor due to higher temperature of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor (see Fig. 5(b)). For exothermic reactions, the temperature is closed to the industrial temperature which is optimum temperature. In thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, temperature of methanol side becomes near temperature of conventional methanol reactor. Of course, by moving along the reactor length, rate of reactions decreases because of equilibrium conditions at the end of the reactor. Rate behavior of DME side has been shown in Fig. 10(b). With employing membranes in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor increases rate of DME production. This subject manner is based on far away of chemical equilibrium in reversible reactions cause more heat generation and higher temperate. Fig. 10(c) shows the rate profiles of cyclohexane dehydrogenation reactor for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor. As the results show, the rate in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is more than thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor because of receiving more heat from exothermic sides and highest temperature of cyclohexane dehydrogenation can be achieved in this configuration."
26,Molar flow rate behavior,"5.4 Molar flow rate behavior Fig. 11 displays methanol production molar flow rate profiles of all components in each three concentric tubes of multi tubular reactors. As shows in Fig. 11(d) the final hydrogen molar flow rate at the end of the reactor for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is more than 18% higher than the other reactors approximately due to membranes are added hydrogen to methanol production side. Fig. 11(e) presents methanol molar flow rate profile for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, thermally double coupled reactor, thermally coupled reactor and conventional methanol reactor. The results display that methanol molar flow rate at the end of the reactor is 0.036 mol s−1 that is higher than thermally double coupled reactor, thermally coupled reactor and conventional methanol reactor. Methanol molar flow rate at the output of the reactors is equal to 0.03244, 0.03346 and 0.03481 mol s−1 for thermally coupled reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and conventional methanol reactor respectively. This subject is the advantages of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor in comparison with other reactors. Fig. 12 illustrates the DME side molar flow rate profiles for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and thermally double coupled reactor. The results exhibit that the DME production in each three concentric tubes of multi tubular reactor increases from 0.0262 to 0.0305 mol s−1 by employing membranes in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. In addition, the results demonstrate that hydrogen molar flow rate at the end of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is increase 33.31% is comparison with thermally double coupled reactor. Fig. 13 shows hydrogen, benzene and cyclohexane molar flow rate profile of cyclohexane dehydrogenation side in coupled reactors. The results show that hydrogen molar flow rate at the end of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor is 0.1143, 0.1009 and 0.0235 mol s−1 that indicate 13.28% enhancement for hydrogen production in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor in comparison with thermally double coupled reactor. Based on importance of hydrogen, hydrogen molar flow rate profile for methanol side, DME side and cyclohexane dehydrogenation side for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and thermally double coupled reactor has been presented in Fig. 13(d). The results exhibit that hydrogen flow rate in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is higher than thermally double coupled reactor and enhancement of 13.28%, 33.31% and 18.07% can be achieved for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, DME production and methanol synthesis sides respectively. This results show that one the major advantage of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is production of hydrogen."
27,Yield and conversion changes,"5.5 Yield and conversion changes Fig. 14(a) shows methanol yield for all types of reactors. As the results illustrate, yield of methanol at the end of the thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is 0.4017 which is higher than the other three reactors (0.3885, 0.3735 and 0.362 for conventional methanol reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor respectively). Fig. 14(b) shows the conversion of carbon monoxide in DME reactor for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and thermally double coupled reactor. The results demonstrate that conversion of carbon monoxide in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is 0.78 in comparison with thermally double coupled reactor that is 0.64. As shown in Fig. 14(c) the conversion of cyclohexane increases from 0.68 in thermally double coupled reactor to 0.76 in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. Fig. 14(d) demonstrates the recovery yield of hydrogen in cyclohexane dehydrogenation side for thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and thermally double coupled reactor. The results show that hydrogen recovery yield in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is 12.98% higher than thermally double coupled reactor."
28,Pressure variation,"5.6 Pressure variation Fig. 15(a–c) presents pressure variations along thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor axis in methanol synthesis, DME synthesis and cyclohexane dehydrogenation sides respectively. The pressures drop is 2.68, 1.12 and 5.17 bar for methanol production, DME production and cyclohexane dehydrogenation side respectively."
29,Conclusion,"In this study thermally coupling of two exothermic reactions with one endothermic reaction using two Pd/Ag membranes for improving methanol, DME and hydrogen production has been investigated theoretically in a thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. Thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is a multi tubular reactor and consisted of 2962 three concentric tubes with two membrane that covered inside and outsides of each three concentric tubes. A steady state heterogeneous catalytic reaction model is applied to analyze the performance of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor and comparison of the result with other conventional and coupled reactors. The simulation results display that methanol production of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is 383.87 kmol h−1 that is higher than thermally double coupled reactor (356.79 kmol h−1), thermally coupled reactor (345.91 kmol h−1) and conventional methanol reactor (371.19 kmol h−1). Also DME production increases from 279.38 in thermally double coupled reactor to 325.23 kmol h−1 by employing membranes in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor. Yield of methanol at the end of thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor is 0.4017 which is higher than the other three reactors (0.3885, 0.3735 and 0.362 for conventional methanol reactor, thermally double coupled reactor and thermally coupled reactor respectively). By employing Pd/Ag membranes in thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor, carbon monoxide conversion in DME side, cyclohexane conversion and hydrogen recovery yield in endothermic side increase 14%, 8% and 12.98%. Finally, based on simulation result it can be said that thermally double-coupled two-membrane reactor increases methanol and DME production from syngas and production of hydrogen from cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
