0,Introduction,"Developing clean and sustainable alternative energies from renewable sources is one of the most urgent tasks for humans in the 21st century due to the fast consumption of fossil fuels and the aggravating environmental problems. Among all the renewable energies, solar is one of the most promising energies that have a high potential of substituting a large number of fossil fuels in the future through photocatalytic hydrogen production or photovoltaic technology (Cao et al., 2017; Correa-Baena et al., 2017; Lou et al., 2018; Polman et al., 2016; Qi et al., 2018; Tyagi et al., 2012). However, solar energy is difficult to use directly as an aviation fuel due to its rather low volumetric energy density, and the application of renewable energy-derived electricity for aircraft still remains great challenges. This is not only because of the low energy density and storage problems of the batteries but also due to the safety issues (Veses et al., 2016). On the other hand, biomass, as a renewable resource, abundantly exists on our planet and can convert the CO2 into organics with high energy densities through the photosynthesis. Long carbon chain fatty acids contained in the biomass and waste oils such as plant oils, animal fats and microalgae have similar structures to the aviation fuels which usually consist of C8 to C16 hydrocarbons (Guo et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2018; Wang. et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). This unique merit makes the biomass and waste oils be promising renewable feedstock to produce aviation fuels for sustainable development. Deoxygenation of fatty acids to long-chain alkanes is the main process to produce aviation fuels from the fatty acids, which mainly involves three different pathways: the hydrodeoxygenation (Eq. (1)), decarbonylation (Eq. (2)), and decarboxylation (Eq. (3)) (Asikin-Mijan et al., 2017; Gosselink et al., 2013a; Hancsók et al., 2012; Hermida et al., 2015; Jeništová et al., 2017; Sági et al., 2017). (1) R-COOH + 3H2 → R-CH3 + 2H2O (2) R-COOH + H2 → RH + CO + H2O (3) R-COOH → R-H + CO2 However, in traditional ways, gaseous hydrogen, organic solvents, and/or elaborately prepared noble metal catalysts (such as Pt-MoOx/TiO2, Ru/TiO2, Pt/Nb2O5) are often required (Di et al., 2017; Gosselink et al., 2013b; Grosso-Giordano et al., 2016; Janampelli and Darbha, 2017; Kon et al., 2014, 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Rozmyslowicz et al., 2012; Snare et al., 2006; Zhang and Zhao, 2016). It is known that the hydrogen is generally produced from fossil fuels, this process not only consumes large quantities of energy but also discharge many environmental pollutants. Meanwhile, the use of gaseous hydrogen brings the problems of hydrogen transportation, storage and safety issues. Therefore, developing a simple and environmental-friendly process with a facile hydrogen source and a simple non-precious metal catalyst for the deoxygenation of fatty acids is highly required. Hydrothermal reactions have demonstrated many advantages in organic synthesis and biomass conversions since high-temperature water (HTW) has unique properties as a reaction medium such as low dielectric constant, few and weak hydrogen bonds, and high isothermal compressibility compared to ambient liquid water (Akiya and Savage, 2002; Jin and Enomoto, 2011). Previously, we have studied the in situ hydrogen production from HTW with earth-abundant metals such as Zn, Fe and Al for the CO2 reduction and biomass conversion (Jiang et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2017, 2019). In these processes, the HTW acted as not only an environmental-friendly solvent but also the facile hydrogen source, in which metals are oxidized in HTW to produce hydrogen with the formation of metal oxides as the reaction of M + H2O → H2 + MxOy. The formation of molecular hydrogen and metal oxidizes were clearly observed. For the used metals, particularly for Zn, it acted as a highly active reductant for producing hydrogen. More importantly, we found that the in situ formed hydrogen exhibited much higher activity than the gaseous hydrogen for the CO2 reduction (Jiang et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2014; Le et al., 2017). These previous studies suggest that the in situ formed hydrogen can probably be a facile hydrogen source for the deoxygenation of the fatty acids to alkanes, and thus the use of gaseous hydrogen can be avoided. Although the metal reductants were oxidized during the in situ hydrogen production from HTW, they can be re-generated by solar energies and biomass readily (Haueter et al., 1999; Jin et al., 2011; Lede et al., 2001). Thus, it can be regarded as an indirect input of the renewable energies. With such consideration in mind, we propose a new method for the deoxygenation of fatty acids to alkanes with the in situ formed hydrogen from HTW with Zn as an indirect input of renewable energy. The strategy is shown in Scheme 1 . A commercially-available non-precious Ni catalyst without any pretreatment was found to have an excellent activity for catalyzing the deoxygenation of the fatty acids to alkanes with an alkane yield as high as 90%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first observation of a highly effective, highly selective and robust system of converting fatty acids to alkanes by dissociating the water using a simple Ni powder as the catalyst, which can be a promising alternative way to produce energy from renewable resources to achieve a sustainable development."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Palmitic acid (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), pentadecane (≥99.5%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), lauric acid (Aladdin Industrial Corporation), stearic acid (Aladdin Industrial Corporation), hexadecanol (Aladdin Industrial Corporation), and ethyl acetate (AR, Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used as received. Zn, Ni, Cu, Mo, Co, Cr powders (200-mesh) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and were used without further purification."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Experiments were conducted in a stainless steel (SUS-316) tubular reactor (3/8 in. diameter, 1 mm wall thickness) with an inner volume of 5.7 mL. Details of the reactor can be found in our previous report (Jin et al., 2001). In a typical experimental procedure, the mixture of tested materials was added into the reactor, and then the sealed reactor was put into a salt bath that had been preheated to the desired temperature to initiate the reaction. The salt bath can offer a fast heat-up time of about 15 s from 20 to 300 °C. During the reaction, the tubular reactor was placed horizontally in the salt bath and was automatically shaken back and forth along the axis by a mechanical arm, which promotes the mass transfer during the reaction. After the reaction, the reactor was taken out of the salt bath and put into a cold water bath (25 °C) to quench the reaction. After the reaction, extraction was processed in a volumetric flask with ethyl acetate, which was used to wash the reactor continuously until all the target products were extracted from the liquid sample. Then, the solution was kept standing for at least 30 min. After standing, the supernatant liquid was filtered with a 0.45 μm syringe filter. Solid sample was collected and washed with ethyl acetate several times and dried in air before analysis. In the catalyst recycling test, the Ni catalyst was separated from the solid sample (a mixture of Ni and ZnO) by using a magnet, and then, it was reused directly without any regeneration. In addition, fresh Zn was used in each recycling test."
4,Analytic method,"2.3 Analytic method After the reaction, liquid samples were analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent 7890 A-5975C) equipped with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.5 μm) for qualification. Quantification of the liquid products was analyzed by an Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm). The temperature program of the column was as follows: 150 °C for 0.5 min, then increased to 280 °C at 10 °C/min and held at 280 °C for 2 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 280 and 300 °C, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the solid samples were collected by a Shimadzu 6100 X-ray diffractometer (Cu-Kα source, 40 kV, 40 mA) at a scan rate of 2°/min. The morphology of the solid sample was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200). X-ray photoelectron spectra of the solid samples were obtained on an EXCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyzer."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Screen of non-precious metal catalysts for the deoxygenation of fatty acid into alkane,"3.1 Screen of non-precious metal catalysts for the deoxygenation of fatty acid into alkane Initially, a series of experiments with palmitic acid as the model compound of fatty acids in the presence and absence of various non-precious metal catalysts (Mo, Cr, Cu, Co and Ni) were conducted at 300 °C to screen high active non-precious metal catalysts in the deoxygenation of fatty acids to alkanes. Results showed that only a trace of pentadecane (C-15) was produced in the absence of any catalyst (Table 1 , Entry 1). When Mo, Cr, and Cu were used, the pentadecane yield was almost negligible. However, the pentadecane yield increased to 48% when Co was added (Table 1, Entry 5). Interestingly, when Ni powder was used, the yield of the desired pentadecane further increased to a high value of 60% (Table 1, Entry 6), which was determined via both GC-MS and GC-FID (Figs. S1 and S2). The remaining solid samples after the reaction with Ni catalyst was analyzed by XRD (Fig.S3), and the results showed that the valence state of Ni remained unchanged, while Zn was oxidized into ZnO after the reaction, indicating the role of Zn as a reductant and Ni as a catalyst in the conversion of palmitic acid into pentadecane. These results suggest that using the in situ formed hydrogen from the reaction of Zn with HTW for the deoxygenation of the fatty acid is feasible and is greatly influenced by the catalyst."
7,Deoxygenation of fatty acids to alkanes on Ni catalyst,"3.2 Deoxygenation of fatty acids to alkanes on Ni catalyst The catalytic characteristics of Ni in the deoxygenation of palmitic acid into pentadecane and the optimization of reaction conditions for the yield of pentadecane were investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), the yield of pentadecane increased dramatically with increasing reaction time and reached the maximum value at 16 h. Also, from Fig. 1(a), the reaction temperature had a significant effect on the yield of pentadecane. The yield of pentadecane increased remarkably from 0 to 79% as the reaction temperature increased from 250 to 300 °C. The effect of the initial amount of Zn and Ni on the yield of pentadecane is shown in Fig. 1(b). It is obvious that the pentadecane yield had a dramatic increase with the increasing amount of Zn and an excellent yield of 90% was reached with 2 mmol Zn, suggesting that a higher hydrogen concentration or H2 partial pressure is favorable for the deoxygenation of fatty acids into alkenes since Zn was used to produce the hydrogen from water. In addition, the pentadecane yield increased greatly with increasing Ni amount, and the highest yield reached 90% with 1 mmol Ni. No significant change in the yield of pentadecane was observed with a further increase in the amount of Ni. Effect of the water filling on the yield of pentadecane was studied, and the results showed that the yield of pentadecane had no obvious change with the varying amount of water (Fig. S4). Quantitative analysis of the liquid products showed that a relatively good carbon balance can be obtained (Table S1), and the selectivity of pentadecane was ca. 93%. To investigate the catalyst stability, recycling experiments were performed under the optimal reaction conditions. Results showed that the Ni catalyst was relatively stable after 3 cycles (Fig. 2 ). The specific surface areas of the Ni before and after the first recycle reaction were 3.4 m2/g and 2.38 m2/g, respectively. The specific surface areas of Ni after the second and third cycles had little change, which is coincident with the observed results of no significant change in pentadecane yield. ICP analysis of the solution after the reaction was also performed and only a trace (3 ppb) of Ni ions was detected in the liquid sample, indicating that the leaching of Ni is negligible. Deoxygenation of other main fatty acids in oils or fats such as lauric acid and stearic acid were also conducted to examine the application of the proposed process for the conversion of plant oils and fats into aviation fuels. Results showed that the yield of related alkanes from the lauric acid and stearic acid were 80% and 83%, respectively (Table S2), which are similar to that obtained with the palmitic acid. This suggests that the proposed process is suitable for the conversion of plant oils and fats into alkanes for the production of aviation fuel from biomass."
8,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism The mechanism of in situ hydrogen production from the reaction of Zn with HTW has already been studied in detail in our previous report (Jin et al., 2011, 2014; Le et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017), thus, only a short explanation is given as follow. During the reaction of Zn with HTW, Zn was oxidized in HTW to produce hydrogen with the formation of ZnO as the reaction of Zn + H2O → H2 + ZnO. The in situ produced hydrogen was subsequently involved in the fatty acids deoxygenation. An intriguing finding in this study is that the general unsupported Ni powder without any pretreatment exhibited a great catalytic activity in the deoxygenation of fatty acids into alkanes. A possible explanation is that the oxides of the Ni on the Ni surface are reduced in situ by the hydrogen from water, which makes the Ni keep a fresh surface during the reactions. To verify this assumption, XPS analyses of the Ni catalyst before and after the reactions were performed. For the Ni catalyst before the reaction (Fig. 3 (a)), peaks at 852.50, 853.67 and 855.30 are characteristic peaks of metallic Ni 2p3/2, Ni2+ 2p3/2 in NiO, and Ni2+ 2p3/2 in Ni(OH)2, respectively (Oswald and Bruckner, 2004), indicating that a trace of NiO and Ni(OH)2 was formed on the fresh Ni surface. For the Ni catalyst after the reaction (Fig. 3(b)), the peak of NiO disappeared while the peak of Ni (0) increased. The peak of Ni(OH)2 still exists and is probably due to the hydrothermal reaction condition. Although the Ni 2p of Ni oxides have complex satellites and are challenging to fit reasonably, these results demonstrate that Ni oxides on the Ni surface can be readily reduced under hydrothermal conditions, which is probably the reason why general unsupported Ni powder without any pre-treatment exhibits such high catalytic activity. This should be a key merit for the practical application. For the mechanism of the reduction of NiO on the Ni surface, it is probably because a galvanic reaction between NiO and Zn occurs. The standard electrode potential of ZnO/Zn, NiO/Ni and H2O/H2 are −0.76 V, −0.25 V and −0.83 V, respectively, and thus the electric potential of NiO/Zn is 0.51 V, which is much higher than H2O/Zn (−0.07 V), leading to an order of the galvanic reductive reaction with NiO/Zn>H2O/Zn. As a result, the surface of Ni is refreshed by reducing NiO via a galvanic reaction before H2 is produced by the oxidation of Zn in water. The Ni catalyst before and after the reaction (separated from ZnO in the solid sample) were also analyzed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 4 , the morphology of Ni has no significant change after the reaction, however, some small particles on the surface of Ni were observed for the used Ni. To identify whether these small particles were the leaching Ni or residual ZnO, SEM-EDS element mapping was further conducted. As shown in Fig. 4 (c), the distribution of the element Zn and O are coherent with the distributions of the small particles, which indicates that the small particles should be the residual ZnO. From the high-resolution TEM analyzing, the d-spacing of the particles had a measured value of 0.243 nm (Fig. S5), agreeing with the (101) facet of ZnO. This result further confirms that the small particles are the ZnO. Further, we compared the different effect of gaseous hydrogen (H2) and Zn using as the reductant on the deoxygenation of palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 5 , the pentadecane yield was only 13% when using H2 instead of Zn, indicating that the deoxygenation of fatty acids in water with Zn as a reductant is more efficient than that with gaseous H2. Moreover, considering that ZnO is formed in this study, the possibility of autocatalytic activity of the formed ZnO was also examined by experiments with the gaseous H2 with the addition of dry ZnO (Fig. 5, Bar B) or wet ZnO (Fig. 5, Bar C) collected after the reactions. No significant change in the pentadecane yield was observed compared to that without the addition of ZnO (Fig. 5, Bar A), suggesting that ZnO has no significant catalytic activity in the deoxygenation of palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 5, the pentadecane yield (90%) with Zn was much higher than those with gaseous hydrogen. This can be explained by the mass transfer limitations of gaseous hydrogen because gaseous hydrogen needs to pass through the gas-liquid interface and transfers to the solid catalyst for the reaction, which is a diffusion limited reaction. On the contrary, the in situ formed H2 has no such limitations. To explore the possible reaction pathways, variation of intermediate products with time from the deoxygenation of palmitic acid were identified. GC-MS analysis showed that the major product in liquid products was pentadecane, and other products were notable hexadecanol, a little amount of hexadecane, heptadecane, and hexadecanal (Fig. S6). Quantitative analysis of the hexadecanol showed that hexadecanol amount increased initially and then decreased with increasing reaction time, suggesting that the conversion of palmitic acid to pentadecane is via the formation of hexadecanol. To check this assumption, the reaction of hexadecanol as the starting material was conducted, and a 90% yield of the desired pentadecane was obtained, which is almost the same as that obtained from palmitic acid directly. Further, gas product analysis showed that hydrogen was the main product with a trace amount of methane (Fig. S7). Based on these results and previous reports (Peng et al., 2012, 2013), a possible reaction pathway of the deoxygenation of fatty acids in water with Zn reductant on a Ni catalyst was proposed in Scheme 2 . The hydrogen generated in situ from the reaction of Zn with HTW is adsorbed on the surface of Ni, meanwhile, the C=O of COOH group is also adsorbed on the surface of Ni. Subsequently, fatty acids (Cn+1) are dehydrated to form aldehyde (Cn+1) by an attack to the carbon on the COOH group with the activated hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of Ni. Finally, the formed aldehyde (Cn+1) is converted to the alkane with the formation of CH3OH via alcohol (Cn+1) because alcohol (Cn+1) was detected as the mainly intermediate. Furthermore, the direct decarbonylation to alkane along with the formation of CO may also occur. In addition, the detection of CH4 in the gaseous products is probably attributed to the hydrogenation of CO and/or CH3OH catalyzed by Ni at the same condition. It should be noted that, since ZnO is a typical semiconductor, the generation of small ZnO particles on the surface of Ni (Fig. 4) probably results in a formation of metal-semiconductor junction between the Ni and ZnO. Thus, based on the band edge of ZnO (undoped) and the work function of Ni, the band diagram of Ni-ZnO junction can be predicted (Fig. S8), and the result suggests that the Ni-ZnO junction would lead to an injection of electron from ZnO to Ni. Accordingly, the surface electron density of Ni would be increased after contacting with ZnO. Interestingly, from the XPS results (Fig. 3), the banding energy of Ni 2p3/2 shifted negatively after the reaction, which evidenced that the surface electron density of Ni was enhanced as supposed. The enhanced surface electron density of Ni catalyst would probably benefit the adsorption of in situ formed hydrogen and the carboxyl group of the fatty acids on the Ni surface, and thus, promote the reaction of fatty acids deoxygenation to alkanes. This is probably another key reason why this untreated commercial Ni powder has such a high catalytic activity, and the ZnO should be regarded as an in situ formed co-catalyst with Ni. The overall reaction of the deoxygenation of palmitic acid to pentadecane with Zn as the reductant and water as the hydrogen source catalyzed by Ni is provided in Reaction (4). C16H32O2(l) + 4Zn(cr) + 2H2O(l) = C15H32(l) + 4ZnO(cr) + CH4(g), (4) ΔrH0 = −495 kJ/mol The standard enthalpy of the reaction is calculated to be −495 kJ/mol, suggesting that it is an exothermic reaction. As already introduced above, the ZnO can be readily dissociated to Zn0 by using solar thermal energy (Haueter et al., 1999; Lede et al., 2001). Therefore, by combining with the Zn-ZnO redox powered by the solar energy, the hydrothermal deoxygenation of fatty acids to alkanes can be a promising practical method for converting the biomass into aviation fuels with renewable sources."
9,Conclusion,"We developed a new and simple method for highly efficient conversion of fatty acids to alkanes with a simple commercially available Zn and Ni powder in water for the sustainable production of aviation fuel from biomass resources. The results exhibit that the general Ni powder has a significant catalytic activity, and an excellent 90% yield of pentadecane from palmitic acid was achieved. The Ni catalyst is stable and still maintains its high catalytic activity after several cycles. This research provides a green, simple and highly efficient process for producing aviation fuel from biomass with a simple and stable catalyst, which is the key for the practical application."
