0,Introduction,"Owing to the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels over the last hundred years, the rising concentration of released CO2 has led to global climate change [1,2]. The recycling of carbon resources is one of the most effective methods for resolving the energy and environmental crises [3,4]. The released CO2 can be hydrogenated to form various products, which can then be used as fuels or raw chemical materials [5,6]. One of the most important chemical products is methanol, which is mainly produced via Cu-based catalysts [7,8]. Cu-based catalysts are usually prepared by a co-precipitation method, and are composed of Cu, ZnO, and Al2O3 [9–11]. Understanding the intrinsic roles and synergistic effects of these three components is not only important for designing Cu-based catalysts with better performance but is also a significant, fundamental insight. Komeda et al. found various reaction conditions for the dynamic restructuring of Cu using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [12]. Behrens et al. [13] thought that the active sites of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 industrial catalysts consisted of Cu steps decorated with Zn atoms. The study by Kuld et al. [14] on Cu/ZnO revealed the formation of a surface ZnCu alloy, which originated from the incorporation of metallic Zn atoms into the surface of Cu particles during H2 reduction pretreatments, and their later work quantified the relationship between methanol synthesis activity and Zn coverage [15]. Recently, Kattel et al. [16] used several kinds of model catalysts to find a synergistic effect between Cu and ZnO at the interface that facilitates methanol synthesis via formate intermediates. In summary, the possible explanations include (1) the morphology changes of Cu under different gas conditions [12,17,18]; (2) the formation of a ZnCu alloy [13–15,19,20]; and (3) the ZnO x overlayer covers or partly covers the Cu nanoparticles by strong metal support interaction (SMSI) [13,20–24]. Most of the current publications focus on the roles of Cu and ZnO or the synergistic effects between them; therefore, the role of Al2O3 as a structural promoter has rarely been addressed [25]. Recently, Behrens et al. [26,27] found the electron promotion effect of Al2O3 by the modification of the defect properties and reducibility of ZnO. In our previous work, using Cu/Al2O3/ZnO(0001)-Zn model catalysts, we also found that Al2O3 can enhance the stability of Cu+ [28]. In this study, supported Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO powder catalysts were prepared and investigated using the surface sensitive technologies of in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/high sensitivity low energy ion scattering (XPS/HS-LEIS) to further understand the promoting roles of Al2O3 and ZnO. In situ FTIR is a powerful tool that can analyze the oxidation states of Cu using CO as the probe molecule and as the reaction intermediate species during the reaction processes [29–34]. The combination of ex situ XPS/HS-LEIS can identify the oxidation states and dispersion of copper; moreover, the content of the surface elements [35,36]. Detailed comparisons of Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO can provide deeper insights into the roles of Cu-based catalysts during H2 reduction and CO2 hydrogenation reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Al2O3 and ZnO supports were prepared using nitrates as precursors and (NH4)2CO3 as the precipitant. The detailed experimental procedure is as follows: Al(NO3)3·9H2O (7.50 g) and (NH4)2CO3 (3.84 g) were separately dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. The two solutions were added dropwise into 200 mL of deionized water at 343 K. The pH of the suspension was kept at approximately 7 during the precipitation process. After the precipitation, the precipitate was aged at 343 K for 2 h and then washed several times with deionized water, followed by heating at 383 K for 24 h. The Al2O3 support was finally prepared by calcining in a muffle furnace at 773 K for 4 h (3 K·min–1). The ZnO support was prepared using the same method, except 5.95 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was used instead of 7.50 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O. The composite support, ZnO-Al2O3, with a Zn/Al molar ratio of 3, was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5.95 g) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (2.50 g) were both dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water, and (NH4)2CO3 (5.12 g) was dissolved in another 100 mL of deionized water and then the aforementioned procedures were followed. The supported catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.094 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and then added dropwise into 500 mg of the supports. The mixture was stirred for 6 h followed by heating at 383 K for 24 h. The final supported catalysts were achieved by calcining at 773 K for 4 h (3 K·min–1)."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα (35 kV, 15 mA). TEM images were recorded on a Philips Analytical FEI Tecnai 20 with a voltage of 300 kV. The amount of Cu, Zn, and Al were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Thermo Elemental IRIS Intrepid II XSP. The catalysts were refluxed in aqua regia at 353 K for 10 h until they were dissolved completely. Each solution was diluted with 25 mL of 5% HNO3 solution before measurements. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was measured by a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument. The pore size distribution was calculated by the adsorption isotherm branch using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70v FTIR spectrometer with an MCT detector and a home-made in situ cell. The sample was pressed on a tungsten mesh (Alfa Aesar, 30 mesh woven from a 0.1 mm (0.004 in) dia. wire) that could be resistively heated. Temperature measurements were achieved by a Type C thermocouple (W-5%Re/W-26%Re/W) which was welded onto the W mesh. For each spectrum, 256 scans were run with a resolution of 4 cm–1. A schematic of the sample holder and IR cell is shown in Fig. S1. The CO adsorption experiments were conducted as follows: The samples were first oxidized in 100 Torr O2 at 523 K for 30 min, and then annealed under vacuum at 673 K for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 0.2 Torr CO was dosed into the cell and allowed to adsorb for 10 min, then the cell was pumped off for 10 min followed by the collection of the IR spectra. The subsequent reduction processes, in 100 Torr H2 at different temperatures, were repeated similarly. Each of the treatments proceeded for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 0.2 Torr CO was dosed and allowed to adsorb for 10 min. The spectra were collected after pumping off the CO for 10 min. XPS measurements were performed using an Omicron Sphera II Hemispherical energy analyzer with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV), which was operated at 15 kV and 300 W. The pressure of the analysis chamber was more than 5 × 10–9 Torr. The binding energy at 74.5 eV of Al 2p in Al2O3 was used to calibrate all spectra of Cu/Al2O3, and the binding energy at 1021.8 eV of Zn 2p in ZnO was used to calibrate all spectra of Cu/ZnO. HS-LEIS spectra were obtained using an Ion-TOF Qtac100 instrument, which could achieve sensitivity approximately 3000 times higher than that of the conventional LEIS instrument. In order to minimize the damage of the surface, He+ was used as the ion source with a kinetic energy of 3 keV, an ion flux of 6000 pA·m−2, and a spot size of 2 mm × 2 mm. The sputtering processes were recorded using Ne+ as the ion source with a kinetic energy of 5 keV, an ion flux of 1600 pA·m−2, and a spot size of 2 mm × 2 mm. The XPS/HS-LEIS instrument was also equipped with a home-made ex situ cell so that the samples could be treated at atmospheric pressure and at different temperatures. The samples were first oxidized in O2 at 773 K for 30 min and after cooling down to room temperature they were transferred to the XPS and LEIS chambers for analysis. After finishing the measurements, the samples were transferred back to the reaction cell for the H2 reduction processes at different temperatures. After each treatment, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, pumped off, and then transferred to the XPS and LEIS chambers for analysis."
4,Results and discussion,"The XRD spectra are shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks of the Al2O3 support show the characterization of γ-Al2O3 after calcination [37]. After supporting with 5 wt% Cu, the diffraction peaks do not show a noticeable change except for the weak peaks of CuO, which are marked by rhombuses. ZnO has strong diffraction peaks, and the peaks of CuO in the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO are much stronger and sharper than those of the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3, indicating a better dispersion of CuO on γ-Al2O3 than on ZnO after calcination. ICP measurements indicate a 4.8 and 4.6 wt% of Cu on Al2O3 and ZnO, respectively, which are close to the loading values. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution are shown in Fig. 2 . The Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 show distinct hysteresis loops and mesopores with a pore size of approximately 11 nm, which might be caused by the stacking of Al2O3 nanoplates. The BET surface areas are 237 and 204 m2·g−1 for the Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3, respectively. In contrast, the BET values for the ZnO and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO are only 10 and 9 m2·g−1, respectively. Moreover, not many pores exist according to the pore size distribution curves for the ZnO and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO. The significant difference between the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO can also be observed from TEM images, which are shown in Fig. S2. Al2O3 shows the morphology of thin nanoplates which stack together (Fig. S2(a)), and the CuO particles have a relatively narrow size distribution with an average size of 4.8 ± 1.4 nm (inset in Fig. S2(a)). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. S2(b)) images show clear lattice fringes of CuO and Al2O3. The measured lattice distances of 0.189 and 0.229 nm can be attributed to the d(-202) and d(111), respectively, of CuO [38,39], and the lattice distance of 0.241 nm can be attributed to the d(311) of Al2O3 [40]. In contrast, ZnO in Fig. S2(c) shows the morphology of thick nanoblocks, and the CuO particles have a broad size distribution with an average size of 21.9 ± 5.0 nm (inset in Fig. S2(c)). The measured lattice distances of 0.276 and 0.195 nm can be attributed to the d(110) and d(102) of CuO and ZnO, respectively [41,42]. The TEM results confirm that Al2O3 can disperse CuO better than ZnO. It is generally accepted that the frequency of CO adsorption (νCO) can be used to distinguish the oxidation states of Cu. The νCO is normally below 2110 cm–1 for Cu0, between 2110 and 2140 cm–1 for Cu+, and above 2140 cm–1 for Cu2+ [29,30]. In Fig. 3(a) , CO on the pre-oxidized 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 at room temperature gives a broad band. During the reduction process by H2, three bands at 2133, 2116, and 2095 cm–1 could clearly be seen when the temperature was higher than 423 K (Fig. 3(a)). The band of 2095 cm–1 can be assigned to Cu0, while 2133 and 2116 cm–1 can be assigned to Cu+. The two kinds of CO adsorption frequencies for Cu+ might be because of the different adsorption facets of Cu2O, which is similar to the situation of CO adsorption on different Cu facets [43], or ascribed to CO adsorption on Cu+ with different surface surroundings [30]. Then, the sample was repeatedly treated the second and third time and the CO adsorption bands are shown in Fig. S3. The band position does not evidently change, but the intensities of the adsorption bands decrease overall, indicating the aggregation of Cu nanoparticles. For the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, CO adsorption showed only one IR peak at approximately 2090 cm–1, which is associated with Cu0 (Fig. 3(b)). The peak intensity decreases quickly after reduction by H2 with rising temperature. Such a phenomenon is repeatable (Fig. S4) and probably induced by a ZnO x overlayer on Cu rather than aggregation [13,19–23]. The reason for the formation of a ZnO x overlayer can be ascribed to the SMSI [44–48], which are driven by the difference in surface free energy between Cu and ZnO [20,46]. There are no CO adsorption bands observed for the unsupported Al2O3 or ZnO under the same conditions as shown in Fig. S5, confirming that the CO bands observed in Fig. 3 are caused by copper related species. In order to further investigate the surface states of the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 during the oxidization and reduction processes, the ex situ XPS/HS-LEIS spectra were recorded. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S6. The reduction by H2 induces the conversion of Cu2+ to Cu+ or Cu0. Since the binding energies of Cu 2p for the Cu+ and Cu0 are very close, the Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) peaks of Cu LMM were measured to distinguish Cu+ from Cu0, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The calculated Auger parameters of Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ are 1850.6, 1848.5, and 1851.7 eV, respectively, which are close to Wagner and Sun's results, further verifying the oxidation states of Cu [49,50]. In order to survey the variation trend of Cu oxidation states more clearly, the curves of Cu LMM have been fitted and are shown in Fig. 4(b). Therefore, the conversion processes are clear, and the corresponding intensity ratio of each peak is shown in Fig. 4(c). It is found that the ratio of the intensity of Cu2+ decreases rapidly, and the ratio of Cu0 increases continuously. For Cu+, the intensity ratio increases first, and then remains at a relatively stable value. So, it is clear that Al2O3 can stabilize Cu+ for the supported 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst during the reduction process. The top surface content of Cu during the oxidization and reduction processes can be measured by HS-LEIS, and the results are shown in Figs. S6(a) and (b). The linear decrease in Cu content means there is aggregation of Cu or partial coating of Cu by Al2O3. In order to distinguish between these two, the sample after reduction at 523 K was sputtered by Ne+. The results are shown in Figs. S6(c) and (d). During the sputtering process, the ratio of the LEIS peak intensity of Cu/Al decreases continuously, indicating no coating occurred. XPS and HS-LEIS spectra of the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO after the oxidization and reduction processes are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S7, respectively. XPS spectra of Cu 2p and Cu LMM confirm the conversion of Cu2+ to Cu0. No pronounced Cu+ peak is found in Fig. 5(b), indicating the weak stabilization of Cu+ on ZnO. HS-LEIS spectra are shown in Fig. S7(a). Since the atomic masses of Cu and Zn are close, the LEIS peaks of Cu and Zn are overlapped. Referring to the spectra of pure CuO and ZnO, the Cu-Zn peaks can be deconvoluted into two components of Cu and Zn (Fig. S7(b)). The ratio of Cu/Zn decreases significantly after reducing H2 (Fig. S7(c)), which also reveals the covering of Cu nanoparticles by ZnO x , which is consistent with the CO-IR measurements. In order to further confirm such a process, heavier sputtering by Ne+ is conducted to obtain a depth profile and the corresponding HS-LEIS spectra are shown in Fig. S7(d). By fitting the LEIS peaks of Cu-Zn (Fig. S7(e)), the increase in the Cu/Zn intensity ratio as the sputtering time increases is evident (Fig. S7(f)), indicating the encapsulation of Cu nanoparticles by ZnO x . The in situ FTIR spectra of the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO during CO2 hydrogenation are shown in Fig. 6 . After the samples were reduced by H2 at 523 K, CO2 and H2 were dosed together into the cell at different temperatures. The IR spectra of the unsupported Al2O3 and ZnO under the same conditions are combined (Fig. S8) and the band assignments are summarized in Table 1 . For the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3, the conversion of bicarbonate on Al2O3 to bidentate formate is seen on both Al2O3 and Cu. For Al2O3 alone, formate is not found. For the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, formate species appear at 323 K. Unsupported ZnO can also produce formate but only at a temperature higher than 473 K, which may be ascribed to the surface oxygen defects formed by high temperature reduction. The formation of formate at a lower temperature for the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO might be ascribed to the highly defective ZnO x overlayer which can effectively dissociate H2. The peak at 1710 cm–1 can be assigned to the Zn–H bond, which is further demonstrated in Fig. S9. Methoxy species can finally be formed at 523 K on the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO with a decrease in the formate, carbonate, and bicarbonate species. XPS and HS-LEIS spectra after H2 pre-reduction and CO2 hydrogenation of the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 7 . Very weak satellite peaks of Cu2+ after CO2 hydrogenation at 323 and 373 K are found, which is probably because of the partial oxidization of Cu by Oads dissociated from CO2,ads. The fitted Cu LMM curves and the corresponding intensity ratios of Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ are shown in Figs. 7(b) and (c). The intensity ratios of Cu2+ and Cu+ both increase first and then decrease. The difference is that the intensity of Cu2+ decreases to zero at reaction temperatures higher than 423 K; whereas, Cu+ still exists. The final intensity ratios of Cu+ and Cu0 at 523 K are similar to those after H2 reduction at 523 K. Therefore, the role of stabilization of Cu+ by Al2O3 still exists during CO2 hydrogenation reactions at 523 K. HS-LEIS spectra after each reaction are shown in Figs. 7(d) and (e). The top surface content of Cu increases first, which might be because of the spreading of Cu2+ [28], and the latter rapid decrease is caused by both the reduction of Cu2+ and the large amount of produced formate species which partially covers the Cu surface. XPS and HS-LEIS spectra after H2 pre-reduction and CO2 hydrogenation for the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO are shown in Fig. S10. No shift of the Cu 2p or Cu LMM happens, as shown in Figs. S10(a) and (b), and the top surface content of Cu is still very small after H2 pre-reduction and CO2 hydrogenation, indicating that the ZnO x overlayer is stable under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the synergistic effect of Al2O3 and ZnO can be understood by the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO supported catalysts because of the following: (1) Al2O3 possesses a large surface area that is beneficial for the dispersion of CuO after calcination, but still insufficient for preventing the aggregation of Cu during H2 reduction. However, it can stabilize Cu+ during H2 reduction and CO2 hydrogenation; (2) Al2O3 has a much stronger ability to adsorb CO2 than to produce a large amount of bicarbonate and carbonate species, which can be converted into formate; and (3) for the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, a ZnO x overlayer is found during the H2 reduction and CO2 hydrogenation processes. The formed, highly defective ZnO x overlayer, caused by SMSI, can dissociate H2 even at room temperature. In order to investigate the synergistic effect of ZnO and Al2O3, the composite support of ZnO-Al2O3 with a Zn/Al molar ratio of 3 was prepared. In situ FTIR spectra of CO2 hydrogenation are shown in Fig. 8 . The Zn–H band at 1710 cm–1 is clearly seen, and as the temperature rises the band intensities of bicarbonate and bidentate carbonate decrease gradually. In contrast, the band intensity of formate increases and a much stronger methoxy band is seen than what was observed with the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO. This indicates that Cu on the composite support is more efficient at producing methoxy species than. Note that all of these conclusions are achieved using supported catalysts with low Cu content in order to avoid the limitations of FTIR measurements due to the high Cu content (50 wt%–70 wt%) in industrial Cu-based catalysts. For industry Cu-based catalysts, the ZnO x overlayer may not fully cover Cu because of the high Cu content [64]. Detailed studies of the Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO catalysts conclude that Cu+, Cu0, and an adjacent, highly defective ZnO x overlayer may together play the role of the active sites for CO2 hydrogenation reactions with a CuZnAlO x catalyst."
5,Conclusions,"The supported powder catalysts, 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 and 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, have been investigated. Al2O3 can disperse Cu more effectively but is still insufficient at preventing the aggregation of Cu during H2 reduction. However, the amount of Cu+ species is higher during the H2 reduction and CO2 hydrogenation processes for the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 than for the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, indicating the stabilization of Cu+ by Al2O3. During CO2 hydrogenation, the 5 wt% Cu/Al2O3 can adsorb a large amount of bicarbonate species and carbonate species, which are then converted into formate species when the temperature increases. For the 5 wt% Cu/ZnO, a ZnO x overlayer is formed to cover the Cu particles during the H2 reduction process, and the overlayer is stable during the subsequent CO2 hydrogenation. The highly defective ZnO x overlayer, which is caused by SMSI, can dissociate H2 even at room temperature, and the adsorbed carbonate and bicarbonate can be hydrogenated to give formate and then a methoxy species when the temperature increases. Therefore, the active sites of industrial Cu-based catalysts may contain Cu0, Cu+, and an adjacent, highly defective ZnO x overlayer."
