0,Introduction,
1,Background,"1.1 Background There is a worldwide interest growing to convert biomass e.g. forestry and agricultural residues, into renewable fuels, electricity or chemicals of higher value. Being renewable, biomass-based fuels have significant benefits in terms of environment and sustainability i.e. zero CO2 emissions reducing global warming. As per European Union (EU) renewable directive 2009, there shall be a 20% share of renewable sources in energy supplied in EU by 2020 and a considerable share of 10% bio-fuels in transport sector (Kåberger et al., 2009). Several fuel producing options exist from biomass gasification using synthesis gas generated from gasification technology including methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), hydrogen, Fischer–Tropsch fuels, and synthetic natural gas. Hydrogen is considered as a promising energy carrier that can be used in vehicle fuel cells and internal combustion (IC) engines. One significant advantage of using hydrogen as a transport fuel is that almost all internal combustion (IC) engines in current automobiles could be converted to burn hydrogen emitting only water vapors without CO2 emissions. Electricity could be generated from hydrogen fuel cells in power plants with high efficiency. However, the cost to run a hydrogen fuel vehicle is high since it requires a substantial amount of energy to store or to liquefy hydrogen. This limitation could be overcome to some extent by using compressed hydrogen gas identical to compressed natural gas (CNG). The distribution of hydrogen to vehicles could require changes in the fuel distribution network as well as modification in gasoline-fuelled vehicles. Currently about 95% of the hydrogen production comes from fossil resources used as raw material for petrochemical, food and electronic industries (Thomas et al., 2002). Alternative hydrogen production technologies must be developed identifying most energy efficient route in terms of sustainability, efficiency, cost effectiveness, and safety, to meet global growing hydrogen demand. However, with increasing hydrogen demand for zero-emission energy products, the use of biomass in future energy systems is significantly important. Pulp and paper industry consumes a large proportion of biomass worldwide that include bark, wood residues, and black liquor. Bio-refinery operations to generate power, renewable fuels or chemicals can be integrated with modern pulp mills having established infrastructure for handling and processing biomass. In regions with large pulp and paper industry, black liquor (BL) is considered as a major energy source that can be gasified to produce synthesis gas producing various valuable energy products in downstream processes. In addition, black liquor gasification (BLG) has potential to replace conventional black liquor recovery system with the recovery boiler. The recovery boiler (RB) technology is in use for several decades but it has several disadvantages e.g. low electric power generation efficiency, smelt-water explosions and reduced-sulfur gas emissions (Larson et al., 2006; Whitty, 2005)."
2,Previous studies,"1.2 Previous studies A number of studies investigated different black liquor gasification technologies to replace conventional black liquor recovery cycle e.g. SCA-Billerud process, DARS process, MTCI process, black liquor gasification with direct causticization, and Chemrec process (Andersson and Harvey, 2007; Berglin and Berntsson, 1998; Dahlquist and Jacobs, 1994; Dahlquist and Jones, 2005; Ekbom et al., 2003). The performance of BLG based combined heat and power (CHP) integrated with the KAM reference mill, an Eco-cyclic pulp mill research programme (see KAM report, 2003) was studied (Maunsbach et al., 2001). Preliminary economics of BLG based methanol and DME production was assessed (Berglin et al., 2002). The black liquor gasification based bio-refinery operations for bio-fuel production e.g. DME, Fischer–Tropsch liquids, and ethanol-rich mixed-alcohols was studied (Consonni et al., 2009). CO2 mitigation technologies integrated with pulp and paper mills was evaluated (Joelsson and Gustavsson, 2008; Möllersten et al., 2003a,b; Yan et al., 2007). A catalytic hydrothermal gasification route to produce methane from woody biomass was presented (Luterbacher et al., 2009; Sricharoenchaikul, 2009; Waldner and Vogel, 2005)."
3,Motivation and objective,"1.3 Motivation and objective Most of the studies focused on potential of electricity or bio-fuel production with pressurized thermal BLG system integrated with modern pulp mills. The present paper is a continuation of previous work to identify most efficient bio-fuel route from different BLG technologies e.g. pressurized Chemrec gasification for dimethyl ether and methanol production, catalytic hydrothermal gasification for direct methane production, and dry BLG for synthetic natural gas, based on various system performance (Naqvi et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2012a,b). The indicators i.e. material and energy balances, potential black liquor to hydrogen production, energy efficiency, and potential CO2 reductions, are chosen because these are the major drivers of converting a conventional pulp and paper mill into a bio-refinery. These performance indicators should give substantially better and competitive results of integrated black liquor gasification based bio-fuel production compared to the conventional black liquor recovery system for a successful commercialization. In addition, the competitiveness of hydrogen production is evaluated using ‘system performance indicators’ by comparing overall process energy efficiency with other bio-fuel alternatives from integrated BLG. The purpose of this article is to investigate hydrogen production potential from a circulating fluidized bed black liquor gasification system with the direct causticization and system integration with the reference pulp mill that produces about 1000 air dried tonnes (ADt) per day of pulp. Pressure swing adsorption is employed as a carbon capture technology with hydrogen upgrading from the synthesis gas achieving potential negative-CO2 emissions. The emphasis of the study is to avoid any major impact on the conventional pulping process recovering cooking chemicals for re-use during delignification."
4,Black liquor to hydrogen: System configuration,"Black liquor is spent cooking liquor that contains organics from the wood (lignin) and the in-organic chemicals used for the delignification. A typical pulp and paper mill uses a large amount of in-organic chemicals and it is environmentally and economically desirable to recover these chemicals. The in-organic part (about 45% mass of the black liquor as dry) mainly consists of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate (Dahlquist and Jones, 2005). The remaining part (about 55% mass of the black liquor as dry) is organic which is gasified to produce the synthesis gas. Due to presence of the in-organic materials, the lower heating value (LHV) per tonne of black liquor solids is relatively low (LHV, 12.3MJ/kg). In a BLG system, black liquor is gasified at high temperatures in a reactor and the in-organic content is separated from the synthesis gas. Black liquor conversion to hydrogen completes in three major process steps, (i) circulating fluidized bed gasification with direct causticization, (ii) CO-shift, and (iii) the synthesis gas upgrading with CO2 capture."
5,Air separation unit,"2.1 Air separation unit The black liquor gasifier is fed with nearly pure oxygen (about 99% concentration) as gasifying medium to avoid high concentration of nitrogen in the synthesis gas. For this reason, a simple cryogenic air separation unit is used. However, for commercial process this high quality oxygen is not required, but a cryogenic air separation unit is selected as the most common process for air separation used by majority of industries meaning that the real process can be cheaper and less complicated."
6,Dry BLG with direct causticization,"2.2 Dry BLG with direct causticization A dry BLG (DBLG) system with direct causticization replaces the conventional recovery boiler with a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier (i.e. titanium dioxide (TiO2) as bed material). The name ‘dry’ given to the gasification technology is based on the fact that the black liquor is gasified at 800°C which is below the melting point of the in-organic solids in the black liquor. The in-organic material is recovered as ‘dry solids’ from the bottom of the gasifier. On the other hand, other gasification processes e.g. Chemrec BLG operates at 950–1000°C which is above the melting point of the in-organic solids in the black liquor. The in-organic material is recovered as ‘molten smelt’ from the bottom of the gasifier. The chemical recovery cycle is replaced by a Titanate cycle (Nohlgren and Sinquefield, 2004). Fig. 1 illustrates the Titanate cycle in the DBLG system. The black liquor organics are gasified at 800°C and a pressure of 20bar to a synthesis gas that constitutes mainly H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. Since oxygen is used instead of air, there is increased risk of agglomeration of the fluidized bed material due to local hot spot formation. However, this risk is reduced in this system due to considerable steam generation within the gasifier because of significant moisture content of the black liquor (about 20%). VTT in Finland has built oxygen blown circulating fluidized bed gasifier with steam injection, but currently there is no available experimental data (Kurkela, 2009). During the gasification, sulfates are reduced to sulfides that are mostly evaporated as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The reaction of TiO2 with Na2CO3 results in direct causticization leading elimination of energy-intensive lime kiln which is an integral unit required in the conventional chemical recovery cycle and also in other BLG technologies. The reactions in the gasifier are (Nohlgren and Sinquefield, 2004): (1) 7 Na 2 CO 3 + 5 ( Na 2 O · 3 TiO 2 ) → 3 ( 4 Na 2 O · 5 TiO 2 ) + 7 CO 2 (2) Na 2 SO 4 + 2 C → Na 2 S + 2 CO 2 (3) Na 2 S + CO 2 + H 2 O → Na 2 CO 3 + H 2 S (4) 3 ( 4 Na 2 O · 5 TiO 2 ) + 7 H 2 O → 5 ( Na 2 O · 3 TiO 2 ) + 14 NaOH The sulfur-lean white liquor is reused in the delignification unit and H2S is recovered from the synthesis gas using selective absorption which generates sulfur-rich stream."
7,Synthesis gas cooling and cleaning,"2.3 Synthesis gas cooling and cleaning The synthesis gas leaving the CFB gasifier contains considerable amount of water vapors and few particulates. To make process energy efficient, the heat energy associated with the vapors must be recovered to generate medium and low pressure steam. A counter current condenser type of gas cooler is used as combined gas cooling and particulate removal unit (Ekbom et al., 2003). In addition, the synthesis gas needs to be free from sulfur. An absorption system using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution as solvent removes H2S which is absorbed reacting with Na2CO3 solution in a selective way and the patent for absorption system has been applied by Dahlquist, Wallin, Simonsson, and Bengtsson (Dahlquist et al., 2010). The absorption system shows 20times more H2S absorption than CO2. The sulfur rich stream is recycled back to the pulp mill for re-use in the pulping process."
8,CO-shift conversion,"2.4 CO-shift conversion After purification, cleaned synthesis gas is shifted in catalytic CO-shift unit using water gas shift reaction. See Reaction (5). (5) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 + Heat The conventional catalyst based on iron oxides and chromium oxides increases the reaction rate resulting less residence time. To achieve high yield of hydrogen, the synthesis gas is shifted in two water gas CO-shift reactors i.e. high and low temperature shift converters (see Fig. 2 ). The equilibrium reaction is dependent on variable stoichiometric composition of the dry synthesis gas due to different dry solids content of the black liquor, and particularly on steam quantities in the synthesis gas fed to the shift reactor."
9,Hydrogen Upgrading with CO2 capture,"2.5 Hydrogen Upgrading with CO2 capture Hydrogen upgrading includes CO2 separation from the shifted synthesis gas to achieve high purity of hydrogen as product. A number of commercial technologies for CO2 capture are available e.g. membrane gas separation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or physical absorption (e.g. Selexol process). The pressure swing adsorption is selected achieving more than 99% purity of hydrogen in this study. The hydrogen yield is not much affected by purity level while the operating pressure ranges between 18 and 36 bars (Cortes et al., 2009). The CO2 rich gas can be sequestrated in empty gas fields that allow the system to be potential CO2-negative. However, the CO2 compression energy required is not included in overall efficiency estimation. Note that CO2 capture and storage technologies are still under development and are not fully commercially implemented."
10,Methodology and assumptions,"This Section presents assumptions and methodology adapted to configure DBLG technology to produce hydrogen, integrated with a reference pulp mill. The purpose is to explain how energy and material balance calculations have been performed to estimate potential hydrogen production and CO2 offsets. This Section also provides data used for the reference pulp mill system and the gasification island configuration."
11,Reference mill characteristics,"3.1 Reference mill characteristics An Eco-cyclic hypothetical pulp mill developed within the Swedish research program KAM (Kretslopps Anpassad Massafabrik) is selected as the reference for material and energy calculations. The hypothetical mill produces 2000 air dry metric tonnes (ADt) per day of pulp (KAM report, 2003). For present study, the pulp mill is assumed to produce 1000ADt/day of pulp that corresponds to about 1700 tonnes per day of black liquor dry solids (BLS). Table 1 shows key reference pulp mill parameter assumptions."
12,System boundary and configuration,"3.2 System boundary and configuration A quantitative process flow chart of the DBLG system for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 2. The key input values are listed in Table 2 used for the energy calculations. The composition of the synthesis gas containing mainly CO, H2, CO2, CH4, H2S, and H2O(g), from the gasifier (800°C; 20bar) at equilibrium is used (Dahlquist and Jones, 2005). A detailed energy and material balances for the gasification process are performed including total energy consumption within the gasifier i.e. energy required to heat black liquor water contents, evaporation of water to steam, heating the steam to the gasification temperature (800°C), heating the required amount of oxygen (based on the relative oxidation) to the gasification temperature and heating of both organic and in-organic contents of the black liquor to the gasification temperature. Table 3 provides a detailed synthesis gas data that helps to calculate the overall material and energy balances of the black liquor gasification island providing the synthesis gas composition, volumetric and mass flow rate of the synthesis gas, and the lower heating value of the synthesis gas at each important step of converting the synthesis gas to hydrogen. Each step is marked in the Fig. 2. A low relative oxidation (Relox=the amount of O2 per kg BL/amount of O2 needed for 100% oxidation of all organics using nearly pure oxygen as gasifying medium) of 27% is assumed as high relative oxidation leads to lower gas quality without efficient residual carbon conversion. Another assumption is that the chemicals required for cooking shall be recycled from the reactor to the pulp mill for reuse in the cooking unit. It is important to note that the integrated hydrogen production requires compensating electricity and process steam generated in the power boiler employing extra biomass import. However, the total energy demand is reduced in the DBLG system due to no bark requirement in the lime kiln as compared to the reference pulp mill system. In conventional BL recovery process, steam and electricity needed for the pulping process are generated by the combustion of black liquor in the recovery boiler. It is important to generate identical amount of steam in integrated BLG system for hydrogen production to eliminate major impact on the pulping process. Hence, the total demand of steam and electricity shall be fulfilled by employing a new biomass power boiler. Since available falling bark at the pulp mill is not enough to generate much steam needed for the pulping process, additional fuel is combusted in the power boiler. The power boiler generates steam to balance overall steam deficit for mill process use and also to meet internal net steam demand of the BLG Island. High pressure steam is produced in back pressure mode where electricity is generated using back pressure steam turbine."
13,Results: System performance indicators,"This study evaluates energy conversion performance based on system performance indicators and potential CO2 abatement from hydrogen production at integrated reference pulp and paper mill. The comparisons are performed with other bio-fuel alternatives from different BLG systems to understand major consumers and producers within the integrated systems. The other alternatives are (1) hydrogen from Chemrec BLG system CBLG (H2) (Andersson and Harvey, 2007), (2) methanol from Chemrec BLG system CBLG (MeOH) (Ekbom et al., 2003), (3) methanol from DBLG system with causticization DBLG (MeOH) (Naqvi et al., 2012a), and (4) synthetic natural gas from DBLG system with direct causticization DBLG (SNG) (Naqvi et al., 2012b). To make systems comparable, the results from other studies are scaled up to the reference pulp mill capacity."
14,Material and energy balances,"4.1 Material and energy balances Material and energy balances determine the potential electricity, steam and hydrogen production based on reference mill capacity i.e. 1000ADt/day of pulp production. The material balance results are divided into three major streams balances (i) Steam balance, (ii) Electricity balance, and (iii) bark balance. The reference mill steam demand is approximately identical in all alternatives (about 177tonnes/h). Despite the net BLG steam production of these alternatives is positive but it is still significantly less than steam demand of the pulp mill that must be balanced by generating steam in the power boiler (Fig. 3 ). The steam generation in the BLG island primarily comes from heat energy recovered from the synthesis gas cooling. The net BLG steam output in the DBLG (H2) system shows less production than other DBLG system (both MeOH and SNG) resulting more steam needs to be generated to balance total steam demand. However, net DBLG (H2) steam production is nearly similar to the CBLG systems (H2). See Fig. 3 for comparisons. The conventional recovery boiler (RB) system is favored when electricity balances are compared with bio-fuel alternatives i.e. the RB system has a potential to export surplus of electricity (more than 20MW). About 21MW of electricity shall be required in the DBLG (H2) system to meet both reference mill and the BLG island electricity demand (see Fig. 4 ). This means a total of about 41MW shall be generated outside the mill to make both systems comparable. An important energy stream in the compared systems is additional biomass requirement to compensate total energy deficit due to energy conversion of black liquor to bio-fuels. The DBLG (H2) system needs about 50MW of biomass import to compensate the deficit which is significantly less than the CBLG systems (both H2 and MeOH) due to elimination of the lime kiln (Fig. 5 )."
15,Black liquor to hydrogen: Potential and efficiency,4.2 Black liquor to hydrogen: Potential and efficiency The integrated BLG system for hydrogen production is evaluated and compared in terms of production potential and fuel to product efficiency (see Table 4 ). The fuel to product ratio i.e. also termed as cold gas energy efficiency of the process is the ratio of bio-fuel energy output to fuel input (black liquor and biomass import). The DBLG (SNG) systems shows highest FTPE compared to other alternatives whereas the DBLG (H2) system is still substantial.
16,Energy ratios,"4.3 Energy ratios The energy ratio is defined as the sum of mill process steam, net electricity import or export, and hydrogen output divided by the sum of all fuel energy inputs i.e. black liquor, bark to lime kiln, and biomass to the power boiler (see Equation 6). Table 5 shows energy ratios based on the lower heating value (LHV) of fuels. The DBLG (SNG) system shows the highest energy ratio and the DBLG (H2) considerably better than the CBLG systems. Energy ratio = Useful outputs ( MW ) Total inputs ( MW ) Whereas:Useful outputs=Mill process steam (MW)+Net electricity (MW)+Hydrogen fuel produced (MW)Total inputs=Black liquor input (MW)+Bark to lime kiln (MW)+biomass to power boiler (MW)"
17,Potential CO2 reductions,"4.4 Potential CO2 reductions Hydrogen produced from black liquor is considered CO2 neutral and it is assumed to replace fossil gasoline as an automotive fuel. A substantial amount of CO2 can be captured using pressure swing adsorption. However, there are some fossil fuel CO2 emissions connected with electricity import and upstream processes including extra biomass cultivation and transport emissions, but these emissions are not included. The compared results shown in Fig. 6 combines on-site CO2 capture potential and CO2 offset from hydrogen replacing motor gasoline."
18,Discussion,"The studied DBLG system differs from the conventional recovery boiler system and the Chemrec BLG system in terms of synthesis gas composition but mainly with respect to the chemical recovery cycle. In the recovery boiler system, sodium and sulfur as molten sodium sulfide and sodium carbonate are recovered at the bottom of the boiler. The molten smelt is absorbed in the weak wash to produce green liquor. The causticization of the green liquor is performed in the lime kiln to produce calcium carbonate and sodium hydroxide before it can be reused for cooking. In the CBLG system, sulfur in black liquor leaves the gasifier mostly as H2S and not as sodium sulfide (Na2S). This results in increased load on the lime kiln for causticization e.g. 25% increased load on lime kiln compared to conventional recovery system. However in the DBLG system, there is direct causticization in the reactor eliminating the energy-intensive lime kiln. About 65% of the sulfur in the form of H2S goes with the gas phase in dry BLG system which is recovered with a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate at pH 10.5 using selective absorption. The leaching of sodium oxide titanate in water forming NaOH and a separation between NaOH and NaHS enables modified cooking (Hakanen and Teder, 1997). In addition, the DBLG system with direct causticization showed several other advantages over the conventional recovery boiler system, such as higher white liquor concentration, white liquor production of varying sulfidity. From the overall system perspective, it is interesting to estimate the potential of hydrogen production from the DBLG system as potential motor fuel replacement candidate in the transport sector based on black liquor availability in different regions, such as Sweden, Europe and World. During 2008, the black liquor production was about 47TWh in Sweden, 184TWh in Europe, and 733TWh in the world (FAOSTAT, 2008). The potential motor gasoline and total motor fuel replacement is shown in Table 6 . About 35% of total motor fuel replacement is possible in Sweden. Moreover, it is important to discuss the current status of the black liquor gasification technology and highlighting the scientific research and development (R&D) work required to solve issues and filling research knowledge gaps. The black liquor gasification technology is under development and a number of pilot scale plants are operational e.g. (i) Weyerhaeuser’s 300tonnes/day low pressure and entrained flow black liquor gasifier in New Bern, (ii) Georgia-Pacific’s fluidized bed black liquor gasifier with a capacity of 200tonnes/day inVirginia, (iii) Norampac’s steam reformer with a capacity of 100tonnes/day of black liquor in Trenton, Ontario, and (iv) Chemrec’s oxygen blown pressurized entrained flow black liquor gasifier with a capacity of 20tonnes/day in Piteå, Sweden. In the light of experience from these pilot plants, there are several issues that need to be resolved e.g. the selection of refractory lining material for gasifier vessel and mechanical design of the black liquor injection nozzle. The current material for refractory lining are not considered adequate since the black liquor gasification process combines an aggressive environment for reactor lining due to high temperature and alkalinity. However, the dry black liquor gasification process using circulating fluidized bed reactor is significantly better from the corrosion point-of-view compared to other types of gasification systems. Other limitations include better understanding of black liquor chemistry and dynamics, the gasifier design, better pulp mill integration, appropriate black liquor conversion technology, and market opportunities for bio-fuel end use."
19,Conclusion,"This paper shows energy conversion performance of black liquor to hydrogen from dry black liquor gasification system with direct causticization and the results are compared with various bio-fuel alternatives. Based on the reference mill capacity (243.5MW of black liquor) and additional biomass import (50MW), the results indicated a significant hydrogen production potential (about 141MW). The energy ratio of about 0.74 is calculated considering major inputs and outputs across the system boundary. About 867 ktonnes of CO2 abatement per year is estimated i.e. combining possible CO2 capture and CO2 offset from hydrogen replacing motor gasoline. The hydrogen production offers a substantial motor fuel replacement especially in regions with large pulp and paper industry e.g. about 63% of domestic gasoline consumption can be replaced with hydrogen produced based on total black liquor available in Sweden."
