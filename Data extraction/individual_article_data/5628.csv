0,Introduction,"The production of hydrogen by reforming of hydrocarbons and/or alcohols has attracted widespread attention for fueling polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Among the liquid feedstocks proposed for producing hydrogen, bio-ethanol is regarded as one of the most promising candidates due to its relatively high hydrogen content and renewable origin. Ethanol may be converted into hydrogen by steam reforming (SR) according to the stoichiometric reaction: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 This reaction is thermodynamically feasible at above 400°C [1,2], but undesirable by-products are formed in significant amounts. Depending on the catalyst and the reaction conditions employed, ethanol dehydration to ethylene and dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde may become the major reactions [3–8]. The formation of these intermediates not only significantly reduces the productivity of hydrogen, but also has a marked detrimental effect on the stability of the catalyst. For instance, oligomerization of ethylene and condensation of acetone are the main reasons for coke formation during the course of the reaction. Thus, the main challenge for the production of hydrogen by SR of ethanol has remained the development of efficient catalysts giving high yields of hydrogen while displaying acceptable stability. Supported Ni [5,7,9–11] and Co [3,12–14] catalysts have been shown to be active for SR of ethanol. However, the formation of considerable amounts of methane on Ni catalysts through acetaldehyde decomposition and CO/CO2 hydrogenation results in a significant decrease in the yields of hydrogen [9–11]. Rapid deactivation due to heavy coke deposition is another problem associated with these catalysts. Co catalysts are characterized by significant deactivation mainly because of surface oxidation of the metal, even at moderate temperatures [12,13]. Among the noble metals, Rh has been proved to be significantly active and selective for SR of ethanol [3,8,15–18]. For example, 100% conversion of ethanol was achieved over an Rh/Al2O3 catalyst at 800°C, and the selectivity of hydrogen was more than 95% [15]. Rh/MgO catalysts gave 100% ethanol conversion at 650°C and a hydrogen selectivity of 92% [3]. An Rh/CeO2 catalyst showed 100% hydrogen selectivity and >99% ethanol conversion at ∼800°C [18]. We have recently reported that Ir/CeO2 catalysts show quite promising performances for ethanol SR in terms of activity and stability [19,20], mainly due to the strong Ir–CeO2 interaction. In fact, ceria-supported noble metals have been demonstrated to be rather stable and highly active for ethanol decomposition [21], partial oxidation of ethanol [17] and the water gas shift (WGS) reaction [18,22–24], which are closely related to the reaction scheme of ethanol SR. In addition to preventing the metal particles from sintering, ceria also exhibits strong resistance to coke deposition because of its high oxygen storage-release capacity, which facilitates coke gasification under steam [17,18]. In this work, we have extended our studies to the reaction mechanism of ethanol SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst and have assessed the stability of the catalyst. The reaction mechanism was investigated with a feed stream of a 25vol.% ethanol aqueous solution (water/ethanol molar ratio of 9.5/1) diluted with He. The stability of the catalyst was examined with an approximately stoichiometric feed stream of a 50vol.% ethanol aqueous solution (water/ethanol molar ratio of 3.2)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ir/CeO2 catalyst with an Ir loading of 2wt.% was prepared by a deposition–precipitation method. Commercially available cerium dioxide powder with a BET surface area of 96m2/g (Baotou Rare Earth Metal Co., China) was suspended in an aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of the iridium precursor (H2IrCl6·6H2O), and the mixture was heated to 75°C with stirring. A 0.25M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 was then gradually added until the pH value of the mixture reached 9.0. The resulting mixture was maintained at 75°C for 1h, during which iridium hydroxide carbonate species were precipitated on the surface of ceria. After filtration and washing with hot water, the solid obtained was dried at 100°C overnight and finally calcined at 400°C for 5h in air."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX-RB diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source operating at 40kV and 100mA. The mean crystallite size of the ceria was calculated using the Scherrer equation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a Philips Tecnai G220 microscope operating at 200kV. TEM images of the catalysts used were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2000EX instrument operating at 100kV. Specimens were prepared by ultrasonically suspending the samples in ethanol. A drop of the suspension was deposited on a thin carbon film supported on a standard copper grid and dried in air. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at −196°C using a Nova 4200e system. Before the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300°C for 5h. The specific surface areas were calculated by multipoint Braunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms. The chemical composition of the catalyst was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Plasma-Spec-I spectrometer. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional set-up equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples (50mg) were heated to 500°C in flowing He (40mL/min) and kept at this temperature for 1h to remove adsorbed carbonates and hydrates. After cooling to room temperature, the reducing gas mixture (10vol.% H2/He) was introduced at 30mL/min and the temperature was increased to 700°C at a ramp rate of 10°C/min."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements SR of ethanol was conducted in a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. Catalyst samples (300mg, grain size of 40–60 mesh) were loaded and sandwiched between two layers of quartz wool. Before the reaction, the catalysts were reduced with a 10vol.% H2/He mixture (30mL/min) at 400°C for 3h. For mechanistic studies, a 25vol.% ethanol aqueous solution was injected by means of a micro-pump into a vaporizer, in which it was heated to 200°C and mixed with an He stream from a mass-flow controller (D07-7A/ZM, 0–100mL/min), giving a feed gas composition of H2O/CH3CH2OH/He=18.1/1.9/80vol.%. When 2vol.% CO, 5vol.% CO2, and 2vol.% CH4 were added to the reaction stream, the concentrations of ethanol and water were kept constant and the balance was made up with He. SR reactions of acetaldehyde, acetone and methane were carried out with feed gas compositions of H2O/CH3CHO/He=18.1/1.9/80vol.%, H2O/CH3COCH3/He=16.4/3.6/80vol.% and H2O/CH4/He=18.1/1.9/80vol.%, respectively. The gas hourly space velocity was 11,000mL/gcat h. For the stability test, a 50vol.% ethanol aqueous solution with an H2O/CH3CH2OH molar ratio of 3.2 was used. The liquid ethanol/water mixture was fed by means of a micro-pump and vaporized at 200°C. The gas hourly space velocity was 6000mL/gcat h. The effluent from the reactor was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatography. H2, CO, and CO2 were separated on a packed column (Hayesap D) and detected by a TCD, and the hydrocarbons and oxygenates were separated on a capillary column (INNOWAX) and analyzed with a flame-ionization detector (FID). The concentrations of the outlet products were calculated by excluding water, that is, dry-based gas composition are quoted."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical and chemical properties of the Ir/CeO2 catalyst,"3.1 Physical and chemical properties of the Ir/CeO2 catalyst ICP analysis revealed that the actual loading of Ir was 2.05wt.%, as designed, and the deposition of Ir decreased the surface area of the ceria support only slightly, from 93m2/g to 86m2/g. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared Ir/CeO2 catalyst; only diffraction peaks of CeO2 (JCPDS 34-394) are observed, with an average crystallite size of 8nm. No diffraction peaks of iridium species are seen, suggesting that the Ir crystallites were highly dispersed over the ceria and were too small (probably less than 3nm) to be detected. Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM images of the Ir/CeO2 catalyst. It can be seen that the Ir particles with an average diameter of ∼2nm were highly dispersed on ceria particles of sizes ∼10nm. Fig. 3 compares the TPR profiles of the Ir/CeO2 catalyst and the CeO2 support. Pure CeO2 only showed hydrogen consumption at 430°C, corresponding to its surface reduction [25]. The Ir/CeO2 catalyst exhibited two overlapped hydrogen consumptions, appearing at 65°C and 120°C, respectively. Since the amounts of hydrogen consumed were much higher than that required for reduction of IrO2 to Ir, it can be assumed that the overlapped hydrogen consumptions corresponded to the reduction of IrO2 together with the CeO2 surface. That is to say, the presence of Ir caused the surface reduction of CeO2 to be shifted to a much lower temperature region, indicating a strong Ir–CeO2 interaction. This observation is in good agreement with previous reports concerning the reduction features of ceria-supported noble metals [17,25,26]. It is supposed that hydrogen, after dissociation on Ir, is able to spill over to the CeO2 surface and reduce it at a lower temperature."
7,SR of ethanol,"3.2 SR of ethanol Fig. 4 shows the outlet gas composition following ethanol SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst as a function of reaction temperature. At 250°C, the conversion of ethanol was ∼40% with acetaldehyde as the main product (22%), indicating the occurrence of the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. At 300°C, the concentration of acetaldehyde decreased to 10%, but the concentration of acetone, formed by the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde, increased to 9%. Acetaldehyde and acetone had practically disappeared at 350°C, and the outlet stream consisted of 8% CH4, 25% CO2, 67% H2, and 0.4% CO. Notably, the much lower concentration of CO suggested that CO was efficiently converted into CO2 through the WGS reaction. Methane is undesirable because it competes with H2 for hydrogen atoms; however, it can be eliminated by increasing the reaction temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, the concentration of methane was less than 0.5% at 500°C due to its steam reforming, which is thermodynamically favored in this temperature range [2,27]. In short, ethanol and the reaction intermediate, like acetaldehyde and/or acetone, were entirely reformed into H2, CO2, CH4, and CO at 350°C, and SR of methane and the WGS reaction were the major processes at 500°C. Fig. 5 shows the concentrations of H2, CO2, CH4, and CO in the outlet stream of ethanol SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst at 500°C. The concentrations of H2 and CO2 were ∼73% and ∼25%, respectively. The concentrations of CH4 and CO were only 0.5% and 1%, respectively. These much lower concentrations of CO and CH4 in the outlet stream indicate that SR of methane and the WGS reaction occurred to significant extents due to the promotion effect of the ceria, whereby CO/CH4 adsorbed on Ir particles reduced the ceria surface with the generation of CO2, and water re-oxidized the ceria with the release of hydrogen. This observation is similar to previous reports that ceria-supported noble metals promoted the WGS reaction and SR of methane [4,17,18,20,28]."
8,SR of the reaction intermediates,"3.3 SR of the reaction intermediates As mentioned above, acetaldehyde, acetone, and methane were the main products of ethanol SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst below 350°C. To elaborate the reaction behavior of these intermediates, SR reactions of acetaldehyde, acetone, and methane were investigated. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of the product distribution for SR of acetaldehyde. At temperatures below 350°C, ethanol, acetone, methane, and CO were formed. The formation of ethanol apparently resulted from the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde, suggesting that the interconversion between ethanol and acetaldehyde is a reversible process in view of the fact that acetaldehyde was the dominant product in ethanol SR. The formation of acetone is due to the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde: (2) 2CH3CHO→CH3COCH3 +CO+H2 A concentration of acetone of 8% was seen at 300°C, but this decreased to practically zero at 350°C. The concentrations of CO and CH4 showed similar temperature dependences, indicating the decomposition of acetaldehyde. The relatively lower concentration of CO was caused by the WGS reaction. At temperatures above 350°C, SR of methane occurred as the major reaction, yielding H2 and CO. The significant increase in the CO concentration and the slight decrease in the CO2 concentration demonstrated the occurrence of the reverse WGS reaction, converting CO2 into CO. Fig. 7 shows the reaction results obtained for acetone SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst. The concentration of acetone decreased rapidly with increasing temperature and it had completely disappeared at 400°C. The concentrations of H2 and CO2 increased concomitantly, suggesting that these were produced directly by the reforming of acetone. The appearance of a trace amount of CO at above 450°C might have been due to the reversible WGS reaction. Fig. 8 shows the temperature dependence of methane SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst. The reaction only occurred to an appreciable extent only at 400°C, and the concentration of methane decreased rapidly with increasing reaction temperature. The trace amount of CO indicated that methane SR initially produced H2 and CO and that CO, once formed, was converted into CO2 through the WGS reaction."
9,Addition of C1 intermediates,"3.4 Addition of C1 intermediates To clarify the secondary reactions among the C1 products, CO, CH4, and CO2 were added to the ethanol/water stream during ethanol SR. As shown in Fig. 9 , the addition of 2% CO at 350–500°C led to a remarkable increase in the partial pressure of CO2, but the partial pressure of CH4 did not change. This fact demonstrated that most of the added CO was converted into CO2 through the WGS reaction, and there was no hydrogenation reaction of CO or CO2 to methane. After stopping the addition of CO, the outlet gas composition reverted to the original levels. When 5% CO2 was fed at 350°C, the partial pressures of CO and CH4 remained unchanged. However, the addition of CO2 at 500°C resulted in a significant increase in the partial pressure of CO because of the reverse WGS reaction, as shown in Fig. 10 . Again, there was no hydrogenation of CO or CO2 to methane. This fact proved that methane was not produced by the hydrogenation of carbon oxides, but originated from the decomposition of acetaldehyde. The addition of 2% CH4 to the reactant at 350°C did not alter the outlet partial pressures of CO2 and CO, thus excluding the occurrence of methane SR. When added at 500°C, however, SR of methane to H2 and CO took place to a significant extent, leading to increased partial pressures of CO2 and CO (Fig. 11 ). Thus, it would appear that methane is essentially formed by the decomposition of acetaldehyde and not by the hydrogenation of CO or CO2 and that CO2 is produced from CO through the reversible WGS reaction, depending on the reaction temperature and the relative concentrations of the respective reactants and products."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.5 Reaction mechanism Based on the structural features and the reaction performance of the Ir/CeO2 catalyst, it is possible to propose a structure–reactivity relationship. Fig. 12 illustrates the reaction scheme of ethanol SR on the Ir/CeO2 catalyst. The formation of significant amounts of acetaldehyde at low temperatures clearly indicates that the reaction proceeds mainly through this intermediate. Acetaldehyde is then decomposed to CH4 and CO and/or converted to acetone through decarbonylation. In such a scheme, the Ir particles are mainly responsible for cleavage of the C–C bond in acetaldehyde to give CO and CH4, while CeO2 favors the activation of a water molecule, owing to the very fast reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies at the surface and in the solid [24]. A study of ethanol decomposition over a Pt/CeO2 catalyst proved that the Pt–CeO2 interaction contributed to the efficient cleavage of the C–C bond of the ethoxy species adsorbed on the surface [21]. It was also confirmed that CeO2 with a high surface mobility of the OH groups could activate water molecules at low temperatures, promoting the WGS reaction [17,18,22–24]. Thus, the decomposition of acetaldehyde leads to the formation of CO and CH4, while the CO2 is produced from CO through the WGS reaction. This explains the higher relative abundance of methane. The methane produced can only be steam-reformed to H2 and CO at higher temperatures, and the Ir–CeO2 interaction enhances the SR of CH4 and the WGS reaction. Methane adsorbed on Ir particles reduces the ceria surface with the generation of CO, and water re-oxidizes the ceria surface with the release of hydrogen [29]. Pt/CeO2 catalysts are known to promote the SR of methane and the WGS reaction [17,30]. In a recent study of oxidative SR of ethanol over a CeO2-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, it was also concluded that the Pt–ceria interaction not only enhanced cleavage of the C–C bond, but also promoted SR of methane and the WGS reaction [17]."
11,SR of ethanol with stoichiometric feed composition,"3.6 SR of ethanol with stoichiometric feed composition Practically, bio-ethanol is produced by fermentation of biomass originating from plant cultivation and/or residues of agro-industries. The primary aqueous mixture containing 10vol.% ethanol is then distilled to a level of ∼50vol.%, which equals to a water/ethanol molar ratio of 3.2. This feed composition is approximately the stoichiometric proportion for ethanol SR, that is, 3mol of water are required to reform 1mol of ethanol into CO2 and H2. However, water/ethanol ratios higher than this stoichiometric value have been used in most of the previous studies in order to minimize carbon deposition. From a practical point of view, the ethanol ratio of 3.2 is the most efficient and industrially available feedstock, but the activity and stability of the catalysts becomes a major challenge. Fig. 13 shows the temperature dependence of ethanol SR over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst using a 50vol.% ethanol aqueous solution. Compared with the results obtained by using a diluted feed stream, a similar product distribution was observed, but higher temperatures were required to produce acetaldehyde and acetone and to reform them into H2 and CO2. The conversion of ethanol was 10% at 300°C, and the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde was highly selective. Acetaldehyde had been practically all consumed at 400°C with the formation of CH4 and CO. The concentration of acetone formed by decarbonylation of acetaldehyde was 5% at 350°C, and it was entirely reformed to H2 and CO2 at 450°C. As a result, the outlet stream consisted of 67% H2, 17% CO2, 12% CH4, and 4% CO. Upon further increasing the temperature to 650°C, the concentration of CH4 decreased to 0.5%, but the concentration of CO increased to 9% because of the reverse WGS reaction. The concentration of H2 approached ∼75% and the concentration of CO2 was ∼15%. Fig. 14 shows the concentrations of H2, CO2, CH4, and CO in the outlet gas as a function of time-on-stream (TOS). At 450°C, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone were entirely converted and the outlet stream consisted of 67% H2, 18% CO2, 12% CH4, and 3% CO. The concentrations of these products were relatively stable during the initial 20h on-stream, but the concentrations of CH4 and CO gradually increased to 17% and 5%, respectively, in the subsequent 7h. Concomitantly, a small amount of acetone (4%) was detected and the concentration of H2 decreased to 58%. When the reaction was performed at 650°C, however, the outlet gas composition remained rather stable for 300h on-stream. The concentrations of H2, CO2, and CO were about 72%, 16% and 11%, respectively. Only a negligible amount of methane (less than 1%) was detected. The Ir/CeO2 catalyst clearly showed rather high stability even for a stoichiometric feed composition with a water/ethanol ratio of 3.2 at 650°C, but significant deactivation was detected at 450°C. The CeO2 crystalline sizes increased to 12nm and 18nm in the catalysts used at 450°C and 650°C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. This demonstrates that aggregation of ceria took place during the course of the reactions. However, this growth of ceria particles would seem no remarked influence on the stability of the catalyst, considering the results obtained at 650°C. Fig. 15 compares TEM images of the used catalysts. Heavy coke deposition can clearly be observed for the catalyst used at 450°C, and the Ir particles exhibit random degrees of aggregation with a wide size distribution and irregular shape. Since this deactivation was related to the appearance of acetone, coke formation from acetone is postulated as the main reason: (3) 2CH3COCH3 →(CH3)2CCHCOCH3 →oligomers→coke At 450°C, the capacity of the Ir particles to cleave C–C bonds decreased gradually with TOS, and thus the accumulated acetaldehyde was converted into acetone, which acted as the precursor of coke. This observation is similar to the case of coked Pt catalysts, over which acetone was also produced during SR of acetic acid [31]. On the other hand, there was no significant coke deposition on the catalyst used at 650°C, and the size of the Ir particles increased only to ∼20nm with a uniform distribution. As mentioned above, the strong Ir–CeO2 interaction prevented the highly dispersed Ir particles from sintering and the oxygen storage–release capacity of ceria facilitated coke gasification. Meanwhile, SR of methane occurred very rapidly at 650°C and the deposited carbon, if any, could be easily removed through reaction with steam. It may be speculated that the equilibrium between coke deposition and its gasification is well established under the reaction conditions. Therefore, the most striking feature of the current Ir/CeO2 catalyst is that there was no detectable coke deposition within 300h on-stream even with a stoichiometric feed composition of water/ethanol."
12,Conclusion,"The Ir/CeO2 catalyst is significantly active for ethanol SR and shows good stability. Ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde is the primary reaction, and acetaldehyde is then decomposed to CH4 and CO. Methane is further reformed to H2 and CO, and the later is converted to CO2 by the WGS reaction. Ir particles are mainly responsible for breaking C–C bonds, while CeO2 promotes the activation of water molecules, favoring the reforming of CO and CH4. More importantly, the Ir/CeO2 catalyst shows rather high stability for ethanol SR with a stoichiometric feed composition of water/ethanol at 650°C with no obvious deactivation being observed during 300h on-stream. The promotional effect of CeO2 may be attributed to prevent the highly dispersed Ir particles from sintering while also facilitate coke gasification through its high oxygen storage-release capacity."
