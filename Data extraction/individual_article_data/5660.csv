0,Introduction,"Currently, catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) is the second most important reduction method after hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen [1–10]. Significant effort has been directed toward the synthesis and applications of optically active chiral diamines and amino alcohols as ligands for ATH catalysts based on metal complexes. In particular, the well-known classical ruthenium-based Noyori catalysts, which contain (R,R)- and (S,S)-N-(toluenesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenyl-diamino-ethane as ligands, are fundamental contributions to the development of enantioselective catalysts. These catalysts react according to the bifunctional metal-ligand outer-sphere mechanism during the asymmetric reduction of aryl ketones in either 2-propanol or mixtures of formic acid and triethylamine [11–14], and have been applied to industrial processes. Arene complexes of ruthenium with enantiomerically pure mono-N-tosylated 1,2-diamines based on (R)-(+)-limonene were recently found to be highly effective in the ATH of aromatic ketones and imines, with enantiomeric excesses (ees) of up to 93 % reported for the ATH of acetophenone (APh) [15]. In addition, high enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee) were achieved during the ATH of a wide range of aryl alkyl ketones using catalysts generated in situ from [RhCl2Cp*]2 and thioamide ligands prepared from commercial α-amino acids and d-glucoses [16–18]. Wills et al. proposed new half-sandwich rhodium (III) complexes, containing tetramethylcyclopentadienyl groups “tethered” with tosyldiamine ligands that increase complexes rigidity; these complexes are structural analogues of Noyori catalysts. These complexes showed excellent catalytic performance in terms of reactivity and selectivity for the ATH of various ketones using a formic acid/triethylamine mixture as the hydrogen donor. The corresponding alcohols were obtained under mild conditions in yields and ees of 68–99 % and 70–99 %, respectively [18–20]. Unfortunately, transition-metal diamine complexes are often not very stable, with the transition metal reduced to its elemental state in some cases [21,22]. In contrast, сomplexes bearing ligands containing sp2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms tend to be more stable. According to many studies, the optically active N,N- or N,N,N,N-complexes of rhodium with sp2 -nitrogen atoms deliver outstanding performance for the ATH of APh. For example, the [Cp∗Rh(2,2′-bipyridyl)-Cl]Cl rhodium complex was catalytically active and efficient during the ATH of a wide variety of ketones in aqueous formic acid solution under mild conditions. Using chiral Schiff-base ligands, asymmetric induction was observed during the ATH of dialkyl ketones as well as aryl ketones, with the maximum ee of 84 % observed for ortho-chloroacetophenone. The [CpRhCl2]2 complex exhibited greatly enhanced enantioselectivity, from 12 % to 51 % ee, when the (R)-pyridyl-3-iso-propyl-oxazoline ligand was changed to (R)-2-pyridinyl-l-phenylethylamine [23]. Rhodium and iridium complexes prepared from [MX(COD)]2 (M = Rh, Ir; X = Cl, OMe) in the presence of various ligands have received considerable attention as pre-catalysts for transfer hydrogenation [21,24,25]. The dimeric [Rh(1,5-COD)μ-Cl]2 complex with the (R,R)-1,2-dibenzylidene-1,2-cyclohexanediamine ligand delivered an ee of 48 % for (S)-1-phenylethanol (PhE) [26]. In addition, Iridium (I) and ruthenium (II) complexes with sp2 -nitrogen bi- and tetradentate ligands [27,28] failed to deliver high enantiomeric excesses compared to those with sp3 -nitrogen ligands [11,29]. In some cases, enantioselectivity is enhanced by increasing the denticity of the ligand. In particular, Rh (III) catalysts with N-heterocyclic N,H,C-ligands covalently bound to a transition metal [18,19,30], C,N,N-pincer ruthenium catalysts [31], and Ru (II) complexes bearing tridentate N,N,N-ligands with chiral oxazoline fragments are effective for the ATH of ketones [32–34], with the latter delivering high enantioselectivity only in the presence of dual Ru-H/NH functions («ambox», ee 98 % [32], «pybim», ee 98 % [33]) or phosphines («pybox», ee 94 %) [34]. However, the [IrClH(η2 -C2H4)(iPr-pybox)][PF6] complex delivered a lower enantioselectivity of 65 % ee [35]. Therefore, to achieve the best catalyst activity, it seems appropriate to use ligands containing sp2 -hybridized nitrogen atoms, which are potentially polydentate (to create rigid chelation in the system) and hemilabile (leaving empty places for substrate coordination) [36–38]. As examples, N,N,N,N- and S,N,N,S-tetradentate ligands containing heteroatoms with different coordinating properties are good new alternative complexes for homogeneous catalysis [39–40]. A thorough kinetic description of a catalytic system allows one to optimize the reaction conditions and improve the stability and activity of the catalyst, which are usually described by the total turnover number and turnover frequency, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, kinetic studies of ATH over rhodium complexes bearing sp2-N,N ligands have not been reported. Moreover, the NC bonds in the ligand are most often reduced to HNCH fragments, after which ketones are reduced according to the bifunctional outer-sphere mechanism, similar to that observed for ruthenium-based complexes. In these systems, the ketone is reduced by the transfer of a hydridic H from the metal and a protic H from the amino functionality of the ligand [41–45]. The main purpose of this work was to describe the ATH of APh over the Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N'-(R,R)-1,2-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-(1-(pyridine-2-yl)-methanimine)-OiPr complex and carry out an associated kinetic study. The study focused on using numerical simulations to obtain a set of rate constants and thermodynamic parameters that correspond to the proposed kinetic model."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All procedures and manipulations involving air-sensitive materials were performed under an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were purified, degassed, and dried using standard procedures prior to use. Chemicals used in this study (APh, R,R-1,2-cyclohexane diamine, 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, and 2-PrOH) were commercially available from Aldrich; they were thoroughly purified and dried according to reported procedures, and stored in an argon atmosphere. All syntheses were carried out under argon."
3,Instrumentation and analysis,"2.2 Instrumentation and analysis Elemental analyses were performed using a Euro EA3000-Single CHNS elemental analyzer (carrier gas: argon at 120 kPa, temperature of the frontal furnace: 980 °C, thermostat temperature of the chromatograph: 100 °C). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX250 spectrometer at 253 and 298 K using hexamethyldisiloxane as the internal standard. The concentrations of the 1H and 13C NMR solutions were 5 %. GLC analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu QP2010 Plus gas chromatography-mass spectrometer in electron-impact mode at 70 eV, with subsequent scanning in the 40–350 Da m/z range. An Equity 5 capillary column (30 m ×0.25 mm, 95 % dimethylpolysiloxane, 5 % diphenylpolysiloxane, carrier gas: helium) was employed. The quantitative compositions of the samples were calculated using hexadecane as an internal standard. The ee values of the reaction products were determined using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a Dean switch, a CYCLODEX-B chiral capillary column (length: 30 m, internal diameter: 0.25 mm), and a flame ionization detector. The optical rotations of the pure samples or solutions were determined at 589 nm using an ADP410 automatic digital polarimeter (cell length: 50 mm, solution concentrations: 2–30 g/100 ml in methanol). The configuration of the predominant enantiomer in the product was determined by comparison with published data [46]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using, the Firefly version 8.1 software package. The molecular geometries of the rhodium(1+) complexes were optimized using the B3LYP hybrid functional [47] with the Lanl2dz basis set for the rhodium atom and 6-31(G)(d) was for the remaining atoms. The conditions of the kinetic experiments were carefully chosen in order to avoid mass-transfer limitations. The reaction rate was insensitive to stirring rates above 300 rpm. The as-measured kinetic data were used directly without smoothing. A constant maximum formation rate of 1-PhE was observed at conversions of approximately 20–60 %. For this reason, we used this maximum rate Wmax and the maximum turnover frequency TOFmax for the 1-PhE-forming reaction. Differential equations in the kinetic model were numerically integrated using the Kinet version 08 program (Moscow State University, A.V. Abramenkov) [48]. The model parameters were determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviation between the measured and simulated (R)- and (S)-1-PhE concentrations weighted by the standard deviations of the measured values."
4,General reaction procedures,"2.3 General reaction procedures Synthetic procedures, IR, NMR, and elemental analysis data for the N,N'-(1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-[1-(pyridine-2-yl)methanimine] ligand (2) and the [Rh(COD)(N,N'-(1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-[1-(pyridine-2-yl)methanimine-OiPr] complex have been published [49]. In a typical TH reaction, 0.025 mmol of the catalyst precursor [Rh(1,5-COD)μ-Cl]2, 0.027 mmol of ligand 2, and 0.1 ml of hexadecane (internal standard) were stirred in dry 2-propanol (25 mL) for 0.5 h at 25 °C in a dry argon atmosphere. The KOtBu cocatalyst (KOtBu/Rh = 6) was then added some time before introducing the substrate. APh (0.25–2 mL) was added to the resulting bluish-green solution, after which the temperature was quickly raised to 78 °C, and the reaction course was followed by GLC-MS with sampling at 5–10-min intervals."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterizing the catalysts,"3.1 Characterizing the catalysts The bis-imine ligand 2 was prepared by the condensation reaction of (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (1) with 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, which contains the dentate N-atom in the α-position (Scheme 1 ). The ATH of APh to form 1-PhE was carried out in the presence of rhodium (1+) complexes that were formed in situ by interacting the dimeric [Rh(1,5-COD)μ-Cl]2 chloride complex with a small excess of optically active N,N,N,N-ligand 2. Bidentate coordination of N,N,N',N'-ligands is possible in COD-rhodium (1+) complexes. According to the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, this interaction in 2-PrOH led to the formation of Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N-2)-Cl (3) [49]: (1) ½ [Rh(1,5-COD)μ-Cl]2 + 2 → Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N-2)-Cl Geometry optimization of the rhodium (I) complex with ligand 2 using Firefly version 8.1 [47] confirmed the formation of the 18-electron Rh(1+) complex 3 (Fig. 1 ), which subsequently interacted with KOiPr to form the asymmetric sec-propoxide rhodium complex 4 (Eq. (2) [49]: (2) Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N-2)-Cl + KO-iPr →Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N-2)O-iPr (4) + KCl This observation is in complete agreement with the theoretical result of Sautet et al. [50], which showed that four σ-donor ligands cannot simultaneously coordinate to Rh, whereas a complex with two σ-donor and two π-acceptor ligands is stable. It is noteworthy that the DFT calculations confirmed that the active species contains only one diamine and one diene bound to the metal in RhH(NN)(COD). When complex 4 was formed in the absence of APh, the proton signals in NMR spectrum [49] appear to correspond to the ATH products of coordinated 1,5-COD and free cyclooctene (1-COE) (2.29 and 5.42 ppm), cyclooctane (COA, 1.47 ppm), and acetone (Ac, 2.10 ppm). The introduction of APh into the reaction mixture led its catalytic reduction, which was confirmed by the appearance of 1-PhE resonances (δCH3 2.5 ppm; δCH 3.93 ppm) in the spectrum and an increase in the Ac concentration. Hence, the required step in the reaction is the activation of catalyst 3 by basic KOtBu cocatalyst. The coordinatively unsaturated active catalyst is formed from complex 4 by the TH of the rhodium-coordinated diene in 1-COE, which is followed by the coordination of the chiral N,N,N,N-ligand 2 to the rhodium center. Most likely, this reaction proceeds over a rhodium hydride complex, which is formed upon β-hydride transfer to the rhodium atom from an iso-propoxide substituent."
7,Transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone The ATH reaction proceeds according to Eq. (3). Hydrogen transfer from 2-PrOH produces 1-PhE and Ac as products, with no other products found in the system. (3) In this reaction, 2-PrOH acts as both the solvent and hydrogen donor. The maximum rate Wmax is directly proportional to the concentration of KOtBu, up to KOtBu/Rh = 4. Above this value, the reaction rate remains constant; therefore, the kinetic experiments were carried out with a molar base/Rh ratio of 6. A typical kinetic curve for the hydrogen-transfer process is shown in Fig. 2 . An induction period for catalyst activation was observed prior to the catalytic production of 1-PhE; this induction period depends on the catalyst concentration, and decreased from 30 min for a low precursor concentration to 2–5 min for higher ones. Due to the existence of this induction period, the initial reaction rates cannot be used to explore the reaction mechanism. However, a constant maximum formation rate of 1-PhE was observed at conversions of approximately 15–60 %. For this reason, we used a Wmax and a maximum turnover frequency TOFmax that produced 1-PhE in a manner suitable for kinetic measurements."
8,The kinetic model,"3.3 The kinetic model To propose a kinetic model, we first established the catalyst activation rate and 1-PhE formation rate at different reagent concentrations. To identify factors that influence the rates and directions of these reactions, kinetics experiments were conducted in the following concentration ranges: APh (1.7 × 10−5–1.9 × 10-1) M, Rh (3 × 10-4–2.2 × 10-3) M, KOtBu (3 × 10-4–8.8 × 10-3) M, 1-PhE (4.7 × 10-2–4.7 × 10-1) M, and Ac (0–5 × 10-2) M. The results of typical experiments are given in Table 1 . In the presence of the catalyst, the reaction proceeds with TOFmax =268 h−1 and with (R)-1-PhE as the dominant product in all cases. The introduction of rac-1-PhE (0.0476 M) into the initial reaction mixture led to a small decrease in Wmax (by a factor of 1.2) and a slight increase in the ee of the product (to 40 %) (entries 4 and 14, Table 1). A decrease in Wmax was also observed when ∼3.3-times the amount of Ac was introduced, although this effect was already observed when 1/4 of the initial concentration of APh was used; this increased the ee of (R)-1-PhE to 49 % (compare entries 4 and 15). The linear dependence of Wmax on rhodium concentration in the studied range (i.e., (3–22) × 10-4 M) is clearly evident in Fig. 3 . The trend line intercepts the x-axis at [Rh] =0.052 mM; therefore, it seems that a minimum amount of catalyst is needed to show any activity. Increasing the substrate concentration has a positive effect on the reaction rate, as indicated by a higher turnover frequency (TOF) (Table 1). The dependence of TOF on the initial concentration of APh deviates from linearity at CAPh > 100 mM (Fig. 4 ). The maximum rate of this reaction is the result of the combined effects of various rate constants; therefore, it cannot be used to determine the activation parameters of the rate-determining step. The substrate can bind to the chiral rhodium complex in two different ways (to either the re or si face of the prochiral CO bond); thus, two diastereomeric complexes can be formed. The rates of these two competing reactions are given by d[(R)-1-PhE]/dt and d[(S)-1-PhE]/dt, respectively. The differential selectivity for the enantiomeric products, d[(R)-1-PhE]/d[(S)-1-PhE], is independent of the amount of active catalyst when the products are formed on the same active component [51]. The phase trajectories of the products at various rhodium-precursor concentrations are shown in Fig. 5 . The almost overlapping phase trajectories indicate that the two enantiomers are indeed formed over the same type of catalyst. 3.3.1 The role of the COD ligand To clarify whether or not the COD ligand is located in the coordination sphere of the active rhodium complex, we determined the time courses of CCOD and CAPh in the TH process at [Rh0] =2.22 mM. The relative amounts of APh, 1,5-COD, 1-COE, and COA in one TH experiment are plotted against time in Figures 6а and b; it should be noted that 20 % of the original 1,5-COD and 80 % of 1-COE remain in the system (Fig. 6 b) when the conversion of APh is almost complete (Fig. 6a, t ≈ 90 min), while 1-COE begins to be hydrogenated after complete hydrogenation of APh. The rate constant of the TH step (the conversion of 1,5-COD into 1-COE) is 0.0046 M−1 min−1. The ketone, solvent, and COE compete for coordination to rhodium, but since [APh] >> [1-COE], the latter does not significantly inhibit the catalyst. It follows that the active form of the catalyst is the Rha complex, as [Rha ] is time-dependent and 1,5-COD is simultaneously hydrogenated as APh is reduced. Clearly, the formation of the active species is a continuous process, and its rate diminishes over the course of the entire reaction. This non-constant catalyst concentration makes straightforward modeling of this system very difficult. To have a catalytically active system, the catalyst concentration [Rha ] must be higher than about 0.052 mM; this value is probably reached during the induction period of the reaction. As a result, the initiation reaction (the TH of one double bond from 1,5-COD) is expressed by: (4) Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N-2)-OiPr + 2-PrOH = Rh(N,N,N,N-2)-OiPr (Rh a)+ COE In view of the excess C2-PrOH, the reaction scheme in Eq. (4) can be transformed into the following kinetic Eq. (5): (5) d [ R h o ] d t = - k a [ R h 0 ] where [Rh 0 ] is the concentration of the [Rh(1,5-COD)(2)]-OiPr pre-catalyst (mM) and ka is the activation constant (s−1). Integrating Eq. (5) with respect to time using [Rh 0 ] = [Rh0] and [Rha] = 0 at t = 0 as the boundary conditions, we obtain: (6) [ R h a ] = [ R h 0 ] × ( 1 - e - k a t ) The active catalyst can be destroyed during the reaction for a number of reasons, including clustering, ligand dissociation, and ligand decomposition, as examples. When operating under conditions that enable short reaction times (high catalyst or low substrate concentrations) this time-dependent degradation has less time available to decrease the amount of active catalyst; consequently, any decrease is less likely to be noticed. The degraded catalyst can also act as a non-stereoselective catalyst that would be expected to result in a decrease in ee. Catalyst screening experiments are usually preformed under “high activity” conditions, as is the case here. In separate experiments it was shown that ee remains constant at conversions of approximately 15–60 %. To model the decay of the active catalyst with time, catalyst degradation was assumed to be first order in catalyst concentration. The rhodium mass balance is given by Eq. (4), and is valid at any given moment in time: (4) R h 0 = R h i + R h a + [ R h d ] where [Rh0 ] is the initial concentration of the catalyst precursor (mM), [Rhi ] is the current concentration of catalyst precursor (mM), [Rha ] is the concentration of the active catalyst (mM), and [Rhd ] is the concentration of the degraded catalyst (mM). Using Eq. (4), the appearance rate of active catalyst becomes: (5) d [ R h a ] d t = k a × R h i - k d × R h a Integration of Eq. (5) with respect to time with the following boundary conditions, t = 0, [Rhi ] = [Rh0 ], [Rha ] = 0, and [Rhd] = 0, gives: (6) R h a = R h 0 × k a k a + k d × 1 - e - ( k a + k d ) t The time-dependent catalyst degradation described by Eqs. (5) and (6) is not the only type of catalyst degradation encountered during our experiments. The linear relationship between average reaction rate and catalyst concentration (Fig. 3) reveals an x-axis intercept of 0.052 mM; below this value the system exhibits no activity. The most likely explanation for this observation is that a fixed amount of catalyst degrades prior to the reaction, most likely due to trace amounts of oxygen present in the solvent or gases. This means that up to 10 % of the 0.5-mol% catalyst degrades due to such contaminants at normal concentrations. Even “pure” gases contain small amounts of impurities, such as oxygen. To prevent the use of solvents with accumulated impurities, we used freshly distilled 2-propanol in this kinetics study. Instantaneous degradation is expressed mathematically by: (7) R h 0 , e f f = R h 0 - [ R h p ] where [Rh0,eff ] is the effective catalyst concentration (mM), [Rh0 ] is the initial catalyst concentration (mM), and [Rhp ] is the concentration of contaminants present in the system (mM). In this case, the threshold value of the system is 0.052 mmolcatalyst/L. With both activation and degradation properly modeled mathematically, it becomes possible to describe the active catalyst concentration. Inserting Eq. (7) into Eq. (6) provides the following equation for the active catalyst concentration: (8) R h a = R h 0 , e f f × k a k a + k d × 1 - e - ( k a + k d ) t In order to reduce the number of constants in the equation, and taking into account that fact that the kinetics data were processed in the 20–60 % conversion range when ee remain constant, the time-dependent constant kd is able to be included in constant ka. Under conditions in which the catalyst does not degrade, kd = 0 and Eq. (8) becomes: (9) [ R h a ] = [ R h 0 , e f f ] × ( 1 - e - k a t ) Up to now, the detailed mechanisms of ATH reactions have been studied mainly for diamine complexes of transition metals [52–60]. These reactions typically proceed according to a bifunctional outer-sphere TH mechanism. For complexes with sp2 -donor ligands, the ATH mechanism of APh in basic 2-propanol over the trans-[Fe(CO)(Br)(Ph2PCH2CH = N-((S,S)-C(Ph)H − C(Ph)H)-N = CHCH2PPh2)][BPh4] iron complex has been reported [42–44]. Here, the active complex is iron hydride containing a reduced azomethine bond in the ligand, which leads to the ATH of APh by a bifunctional outer-sphere mechanism. According to the NMR data, azomethine-bond reduction in ligand 2 during the TH of APh was not observed. Consequently, we can exclude the “metal-ligand outer-sphere bifunctional catalysis”, mechanism that has been confirmed for complexes with δ+H-N-Me-Hδ− fragments (where Me is a transition metal) [52]. A monohydride mechanism with a metal alkoxide as an intermediate (“migratory insertion”) has been implemented for various transition metal, depending on the nature of the catalyst and the substrate. Particularly, hydrogen transfer can be either stepwise or concerted [53–55]. The formation of d8-monohydride rhodium complexes has been postulated in a number of articles [41,45,53,55,59]. In the current study, no (NNNN)-Rh-H was observed by NMR spectroscopy when a ketone was added. It should be noted, however, that the major species during catalysis is the 2-propoxide complex 4, whose formation is driven by the presence of 2-propanol as a solvent. Despite the lack of direct evidence, the participation of a hydride species as a key intermediate is possible. The direct transfer of the β-hydrogen of the metal alkoxide complex to the prochiral ketone, commonly known as the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction, was found to operate in the mechanism for Al-catalyzed ATH [61]. Whether the mechanism in the present case is “migratory insertion” or Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction cannot be deduced from the results presented here. The pathway to a pentacoordinated rhodium hydride involves the reversible dissociation of the N-Rh bond in Rh(N,N,N,N)-O-iPr prior to β-hydride transfer. In addition, we can also assume that the ATH of APh proceeds over the rhodium hydride formed during the TH of 1,5-COD. The assumed mechanism involves the dissociation of an N-Rh bond in the hydride complex, the coordination of APh, subsequent hydride migration, re-coordination of the N-ligand, and (finally) exchange of sec-alkoxy ligands to give the desired alcohol. The formation of the Rh hydride from the Rh alkoxide may occur through the reverse pathway. Since the reactions are reversible, the observed slowing down of the ATH of APh upon addition of acetone is expected. Rhodium hydride formation resulting from β-hydride transfer (Eq. (10)), coordination of APh (Eq. (11)), and “migratory insertion” (Eq. (12)) are consecutive steps, and each step is at equilibrium even though they can be combined into one step in Scheme 2 . The hydride intermediate is excluded in the direct transfer mechanism.

The reaction products, namely (R)- and (S)-1-PhE, are formed as a result of the TH from 2-PrOH to a phenylethoxide substituent in the coordination sphere of rhodium, with the regeneration of the Rha (Eq. (13)). The equilibrium of this reversible reaction is strongly shifted to the right due to the large excess of 2-propanol as a reagent (2-PrOH/Rh ≈ (6÷20) × 103).

Scheme 2 shows the simplified catalytic cycle for the ATH of ketones, which contains two cycles that correspond to the two enantiomer-forming pathways. The kinetic scheme involves three major rhodium-containing complexes: the 18-electron rhodium-sec-propoxide complex Rha and two diastereomeric 18-electron Rh-methyl-phenyl-methoxide intermediates (RhaSHr and RhaSHs, respectively). The elementary kinetics shown in Scheme 2 can be expressed using the following rate equations for the various components: (14) - d [ R h a ] d t = - k a [ R h i ] + k 1 s [ R h a ] S + k 1 r [ R h a ] S - k - 1 s R h a S H s - k - 1 r R h a S H r (15) - d S d t = k 1 s R h a S + k 1 r R h a S - k - 1 s R h a S H s - k - 1 r R h a S H r (16) - d R h a S H r d t = k 1 r [ R h a ] S - k - 1 r R h a S H r A c - k 2 r R h a S H r (17) - d R h a S H s d t = k 1 s [ R h a ] S - k - 1 s R h a S H r A c - k 2 s R h a S H s The catalyst mass balance is given by Eq. (18) and is true at any given moment in time: (18) [ R h 0 , e f f ] = R h i + [ R h a ] + K S H s + K S H r The formal kinetic rate laws for the formation of (R)- and (S)-PhE were derived from the kinetic scheme using the Bodenstein approach for catalytic intermediates [RhaSHr] and [RhaSHs] (Eqs. (19) and (20)). The concentration of 2-propanol is not taken into account in these rate equations, since it remains relatively constant during the reaction (∼13 M).

A change in each component concentration in the reaction mixture at certain time intervals can be determined from the equations based on the kinetic model. The experimental data from 10 catalytic runs (100 data points), conducted with various initial concentrations of pre-catalyst, APh, and Ac, were globally fitted by numerical techniques to determine an optimized and consistent set of rate constants. Differential equations were numerically integrated using the Kinet program. The rate constants of the individual steps (ka, k1s, k-1s, k2s, k1r, k-1r, and k2r) were estimated from the curves for the formation of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 1-PhE as functions of time by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between measured and simulated (R)- and (S)-1-PhE concentrations; the results of which are summarized in Table 2 . Fig. 7 compares the experimentally determined and fitted kinetics curves (as points and lines, respectively), which reveals only slight deviations between the two sets. The rate constants obtained by modeling the reaction profiles at various temperatures are summarized in Table 3 . These values were used to determine the activation parameters of the individual reaction steps using Eyring–Polanyi plots. The calculated constants for the two enantiomer-forming cycles enables the Gibbs free energies of activation for the various reaction steps to be compared. For example, ΔΔG1rs ≠ = -2.2 kJ/mol, ΔΔG-1rs ≠ = -0.56 kJ/mol, and ΔΔG2rs ≠ = -0.57 kJ/mol. The results show that the steps that form intermediates RhaSHs and RhaKSHr contribute more to the enantioselectivity than those that displace the r-SH2 and s-SH2 products (r2s and r2r) and 2-propanol. A negative activation entropy indicates an ordered transition state, which is consistent with an excess of one enantiomer. The Gibbs free energies of all steps in the process are relatively high, which is consistent with the observed average process rates. The activation energy for the 1,5-COD TH reaction, that is, the Rha -forming step, does not correspond to the highest Gibbs free energy in the catalytic cycle (24.1 kcal/mol), rather, the highest Gibbs free energies were observed in the steps associated with constants k2s and k2r (24.6 kcal/mol and 24.5 kcal/mol, respectively). After reacting for 20 min, the rates of the individual steps at any given time can be approximated by multiplying the corresponding rate constants by the concentrations of reagents, the results of which are summarized in Table 3. The concentrations of the reagents were determined from the experimental and simulated reaction profiles. The forward reactions (described by constants k1s and k1r) were found to be 150–200-times faster than the reverse reactions (described by k-1s and k-1r). Glancing at the activation parameters listed in Table 3, one might conclude that the steps corresponding to k2s and k2r (i.e., the formation of (S)- and (R)-1-PhE) are rate-determining, since they have the largest free energies of activation. Indeed, under the experimental conditions, the slowest steps in the forward process are associated with k2s and k2r, which explains why the rate of catalytic ketone reduction is sensitive to the concentrations of APh and Ac. The rate-determining step must coexist with, or come after the steps involving these reagents. The apparent activation energy ΔE≠ of the reaction was calculated to be 15.2 kcal/mol using the Arrhenius equation (Fig. 8 ). Other activation parameters calculated from the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are: ΔH≠ =14.5 kcal/mol, ΔG≠ =24.0 kcal/mol, and ΔS≠ = -35.7 eu. The calculated free energies of activation of ATH ΔG≠ =24.0 kcal/mol are close to the characteristics of the rate-limiting steps of the process (ΔG1s ≠ = 24.6 and ΔG1r ≠ =24.5 kcal/mol, respectively). These values are almost identical to the value (ΔG≠ =24 kcal/mol) calculated for the ATH hydride mechanism [58], and is higher than that (ΔG≠ =21.9 kcal/mol) for direct ATH [61]. A negative activation entropy indicates an ordered transition state, which is consistent with an excess of one enantiomer. The good correspondence between these values further suggests that the proposed mechanistic model effectively describes the catalytic process under investigation."
9,Conclusions,"Interactions between the N,N,N,N-(1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-(1-(pyridin-2-yl) methanimine diimine ligand (2) and the [Rh(COD)(μ–Cl)]2 complex result in the formation of the Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N'-(R,R)-1,2-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-(1-(pyridine-2-yl)-methanimine)-Cl complex (3). DFT calculations involving structure 3 confirm the formation of a rhodium complex with the bidentate N,N’-coordinated ligand 2. The presence of a strong ligand, such as 1,5-COD, in the coordination sphere of the transition metal prevents the tetradentate coordination of the N,N,N,N-ligand, which becomes possible only after the hydrogenation of 1,5-COD to 1-COE in the (1,5-COD)(N,N'-(R,R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)methanimine)-O-iPr unit. The induction period observed for process is proposed to involve the rapid reaction of the pre-catalyst 3 with excess potassium iso-propoxide to give the catalytically active Rh(1,5-COD)(N,N'-(R,R)-1,2-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl-bis-(1-(pyridine-2-yl)-methanimine)-OiPr diene-diimino-iso-propoxide species, after which 1,5-COD is hydrogenated to 1-COE. The catalytic activity of the tetradentate complex 4 in the ATH of APh with 2-propanol was found to depend on the concentrations of rhodium, APh, and Ac. A kinetics study found that: (a) Wmax is linearly related to [Rh0] in the studied (3–22) × 10−4 M range, and (b) a minimum amount of catalyst (0.052 mM) is needed for any ATH activity toward APh. This means that the ATH of APh proceeds over the Rh (N,N,N,N-2)-OiPr (Rha ) complex formed after the hydrogenation of 1,5-COD. Modeling the ATH process with complex 4, taking into account the proposed catalytic scheme, enabled us to determine the reaction constants for the formation of the active rhodium complex and for the steps in the formation of S- and R-1-PhE. Finally, the Gibbs free energies of the individual reaction steps were calculated. The results suggest that the steps associated with k2s and k2r (i.e., the formation of (S)- and (R)-1-PhE) should be the rate-determining steps, since they have large values of free energy of activation. On the other hand, the formation of intermediates RhaSHs and RhaKSHr contribute more to enantioselectivity than the steps that displace the r-SH2 and s-SH2 products with 2-propanol (r2s and r2r). In the near future, we will intend to undertake DFT calculations to further support the proposed mechanism."
