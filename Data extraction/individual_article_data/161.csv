0,Introduction,"There is an urgent need to develop highly efficient catalysts and technology to obtain butyl alcohol with their production based on local secondary resources of significant national economic importance. Butyl aldehyde, a limiting aliphatic aldehyde of the acyclic series, is obtained by the oxosynthesis of hydrocarbon raw materials. Its byproducts have long attracted the attention of researchers as a raw material – a starting object for the synthesis of new oxygen-containing organic compounds [1,2]. In industry, aldehydes are obtained by hydroformylation (oxosynthesis) of unsaturated ethylene hydrocarbons of oil [3]. During the oxosynthesis of propylene, two isomers of butyl aldehydes are formed: Unlabelled Image One of the most effective methods of chemical processing of carbonyl-containing compounds is heterogeneous catalytic liquid-phase hydrogenation into the corresponding alcohols, which are in huge demand in the industry [4–9]. Skeletal nickel catalyst, characterized by high activity and low cost, has been widely used in industry as well in several studies on the liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds [10,11]. To increase the stability and activity of catalysts in the hydrogenation of saturated aldehydes, promoting additives are employed [11]. Analysis of the characteristics of industrial processes for the hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde, used in various countries, showed that each of these processes, along with advantages, has several disadvantages. Butyl alcohols are produced on an aluminum‑nickel‑titanium catalyst. However, the specified catalyst has low activity and productivity. The hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde at this contact occurs under severe conditions – high temperature (up to 170 °C) and pressure (up to 25 MPa), leading to a decrease in the process selectivity and an increase in the process cost [12,13]. To address this problem, the search continues for effective catalytic systems and the selection of optimal technological parameters, conditions close to the environment (T, P), and a solution of harmless environment-friendly supercritical liquids for the hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde, considering the requirements of the principles of green technology [14]. The authors studied promoted-skeletal nickel catalysts with the addition of platinum group metals [15,16]. They found that the rate of hydrogenation of carbonyl-containing compounds depends on the amount of promoter and passes through a maximum rate. Ruthenium is the most active catalyst in the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds. The development of new selective modified catalysts for the hydrogenation of aldehydes contributes to improving the technology for the production of butyl alcohols, which are used as solvents for organic substances as well as for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. The authors studied skeletal nickel [17,18] and supported [19–21] catalysts in the reactions of liquid-phase hydrogenation of carbonyl-containing compounds. In this study, the kinetic regularities of butyl aldehyde hydrogenation in solution at atmospheric pressure of hydrogen on skeletal Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts were investigated. This work aims to improve industrial processes for the selective hydrogenation of normal butyl aldehyde to primary butyl alcohol by developing new and modified heterogeneous catalysts considering various technological and economic requirements."
1,Experimental part,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Catalyst alloys were prepared in a high-frequency furnace. Nickel and aluminum granules and ruthenium or rhodium powder were used as metals for the preparation of alloy catalysts. To examine the rate of butyl aldehyde hydrogenation, alloyed nickel catalysts with the addition of ruthenium or rhodium were prepared. The amount of ruthenium or rhodium in the catalyst varied from 0.5% to 10%. The aluminum content in the initial alloy remained constant at 50%. The activation technique for promoted skeletal nickel catalysts consists of leaching 1.0 g of the alloy in a 20% NaOH solution at 100 °C for 1 h. The resulting catalyst was washed from alkali with distilled water to a neutral medium with respect to phenolphthalein."
3,Hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde,"2.2 Hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde The n-Butyl aldehyde of the grade (chemically pure) TU 6-09-3828-74 was purified before the use by simple distillation and the purity of butyl aldehyde was controlled by chromatography. Distilled water was used as a solvent. The characteristics of the substances used are consistent with the reference data [22]. The hydrogenation reaction of butyl aldehyde was carried out in a glass thermostated duck-type reactor in water at the atmospheric pressure of hydrogen (700 bar) and a temperature of 20 °C [23]. To ensure that the reaction proceeds in the external kinetic region, the stirring speed was maintained at 600–700 unidirectional oscillations per min. The reactor was charged with 0.2 g of catalyst and 25 ml of solvent (H2O). Air was displaced from the reactor with a stream of hydrogen. The rocking chair was then switched on, and the catalyst was saturated with hydrogen at the temperature of the experiment for 30 min. Butyl aldehyde (0.5 ml) was added to a stream of hydrogen to the reactor. Catalytic activity was measured by the amount of hydrogen absorbed in one min. The state of the catalyst surface was monitored by the change in potential."
4,Chromatographic analysis of reaction products,2.3 Chromatographic analysis of reaction products The butyl aldehyde hydrogenation products were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) on a Chrom-4 chromatograph with a flame ionization detector in isothermal mode using a capillary column with a polar phase 50 m in length and 0.32 mm in inner diameter. The temperature in the column was maintained at 90 °C; temperature in the evaporation chamber was 200 °C; helium served as the carrier gas; the volume of the injected sample was 0.2 μl(microliter). Samples of the liquid reaction mixture were collected 2–3 times during the experiment [25]. GLC was based on the physicochemical separation of the analyzed components in the gas phase as they passed along a non-volatile liquid deposited on a solid sorbent. The GLC is caused as the components allow to separate and quantify substances in a complex mixture even if they are similar in chemical properties [26]. The hydrogenation of primary aldehyde to alcohols takes place as per the following scheme: Unlabelled Image
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde on promoted skeletal nickel catalysts,"3.1 Hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde on promoted skeletal nickel catalysts The catalytic properties of Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts in the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation reaction were studied in water at 20 °C. The preliminary results showed that the aldehyde hydrogenation rate slightly increases with an increase in its concentration in the solution by a factor of 2, and then remains constant. The hydrogenation process is limited by the activation of hydrogen. In all cases, hydrogen is consumed for the hydrogenation reaction, which is theoretically calculated. The kinetic curves consist of two sections. In the first section, a sharp decrease in the rate of hydrogen absorption was observed and in the second section, a smoother decrease in the rate occurred. Fig. 1 shows kinetic and potentiometric curves of butyl aldehyde hydrogenation on skeletal Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts in water. The ordinate axis shows the rate of butyl aldehyde hydrogenation (W), expressed in hydrogen milliliters absorbed per minute, and the potential of the catalytic system (E) is shown on the down of the ordinate axis. The abscissa axis shows the number of ml of hydrogen (V) absorbed during the reaction."
7,Characteristics of the investigated catalysts in the hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde,"3.2 Characteristics of the investigated catalysts in the hydrogenation of butyl aldehyde The saturation potentials of nickel skeletal catalysts and promoted skeletal nickel catalysts are 700 mV and 650 mV, respectively. The ratio of the saturation potentials of the catalysts shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 indirectly indicates the higher activity of Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts as compared to skeletal nickel catalysts (Niskel). The course of the kinetic curves shows that hydrogenation both on skeletal nickel and on promoted catalysts occurs at a decreasing rate. Varying the content in the alloy from 0.5% to 10% significantly increases the activity of the obtained catalysts. Table 1 shows the characteristics of Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts for the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation in water. Analysis of the data in the table shows that all the Ru and Rh additives increase the catalytic activity of the skeletal nickel catalyst during the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation by 1.7–1.9 times. When the hydrogenated substance is introduced into the reaction zone, the potential shift occurs, which indicates the competitive adsorption of hydrogen molecules and the hydrogenated aldehyde. The potential drop (△E) (as evident in Fig. 1 and Table 1) ranges from 105 to 120 mV. At the end of the hydrogenation reaction, the potential of the catalysts does not reach the saturation potential by 30–40 mV, due to irreversible adsorption by the reaction products on the surface of the catalysts. Notably, the character of the change in the potentiometric curves of the hydrogenation correlates with that in the process rate. To determine the comparative activity of alloyed nickel catalysts depending on the number of additives, the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation rate on the Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh catalysts was studied. This dependence is shown in Fig. 2 . The butyl aldehyde hydrogenation rate (W), expressed in ml of hydrogen absorbed per minute, is plotted up the ordinate axis, and the catalyst potential shift (△E) down the ordinate axis. The abscissa axis exhibits the amount of additive (Me / Ni-Al-Me, %) on the catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the catalysts' activity dependence after the absorption of 100 ml of hydrogen on the content of the addition of metals in the alloy during the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation in water. Fig. 2 shows that the optimal content of the additive in the alloy during the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation in the solvent (Н2О) is different. Thus, the maximum reaction rate on the Ni-Ru catalysts is observed at the contact with the content of 1.0% Ru. The butyl aldehyde hydrogenation rate on this catalyst is 1.9 times higher in water than in skeletal nickel without additives. The maximum activity of the Ni-Rh catalysts in water corresponds to 1.0% Rh in the alloy, the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation rate on this composition is 1.7 times higher than the corresponding value for skeletal nickel without additives. A further increase in the concentration of Ru and Rh in the alloy leads to a decrease in the activity of the contacts. An increase in the reaction rate is mainly accompanied by a decrease in the value of the anodic shift of the catalyst potential (Fig. 2), which characterizes a decrease in the degree of butyl aldehyde adsorption on the catalytic surface. These Ru and Rh additives help to better activate the reactants from the surface of the mixed catalyst. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the surface of promoted skeletal catalysts with an increase in the number of additives in the alloy changes slightly from 28 to 40 m2/g nickel."
8,Adsorption and physicochemical properties of modified catalysts,"3.3 Adsorption and physicochemical properties of modified catalysts According to the data of X-ray diffraction studies, the promoting components have a significant effect on the composition and structure of the starting alloys and catalysts. The additives create, in addition to the phases usual for the alloy – NiAl3, Ni2Al3, and eutectics (NiAl3 + Al), new phases – Fх have not yet been deciphered. The ratio NiAl3 / Ni2Al3 in the promoted alloys is 1.25 times higher than in the Ni-Al alloy without an additive. Electron microscopic research methods indicate that the additives do not affect the crystal lattice parameter of nickel; however, these additives significantly grind nickel crystals (from 5.4 to 4.7 nm); increase the specific surface of the catalyst within 110–120 m2/g Investigations of the particle size distribution using optical microscopy and an electron microscope confirmed that Ru and Rh additives increase the fraction of dispersed catalyst particles, decrease diffusion inhibition in H2, leading to an increase in the reaction rate. The degree of its fatigue and deactivation depends on the ability of the catalyst to renew the initial concentration of adsorbed hydrogen and maintain it at a high level. This conclusion is supported by our data on the activation and stability of promoted catalysts. The hydrogen adsorption capacity was characterized using thermal desorption and conductometry methods. The conductometric method was used to characterize the state of hydrogen adsorbed by the catalysts. The promotion of skeletal nickel with Ru and Rh increases the fraction of weakly adsorbed hydrogen, leading to an increase in the binding energy of adsorbed hydrogen with its surface, thereby causing an increase in the total amount of adsorbed hydrogen. Large quantities of Ru and Rh in the alloy lead to a certain slowdown in the rate of hydrogen diffusion over the surface. Promotion on skeletal nickel leads to a decrease in the activation energy; the lowest value of the activation energy corresponds to the maximum activity of the catalyst, which indicates an increase in the binding energy of hydrogen with the surface. A similar conclusion was drawn from the calculation of the apparent activation energy of the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation reactions in the presence of promoted catalysts, which were 3–4 kcal/mol less than when the process was carried out on relatively non-promoted catalysts. To assess the amount and form of adsorbed hydrogen, the thermal desorption method was applied. The data show that the release of H2 from the surface of the catalysts under study begins at (−30 °C) and proceeds up to ≥800 °C; however, it proceeds at different rates. An increase in the rate of hydrogen evolution is noted in the temperature range: the first at (−20 °C); the second main desorption peak is located in the range 130–140 °C, and is characterized as a surface-adsorbed form of hydrogen. The third peak of desorption in the temperature range 220–230 °C characterizes the structural form of hydrogen. The introduction of Ru or Rh into the skeletal nickel catalyst is accompanied by an increase in the second main desorption peak and its shift to higher temperatures up to 170–180 °C, indicating a relative increase in the binding energy of adsorbed hydrogen with the catalytic surface. It confirms the conductometric measurements. The total volume of adsorbed hydrogen varies slightly from 45 to 47 ml/g."
9,Catalytic properties of Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh in the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation reaction,"3.4 Catalytic properties of Ni-Ru and Ni-Rh in the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation reaction The results obtained are presented in Table 2 and indicate that the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation process on skeletal nickel is nonselective. The addition of Ru and Rh causes an increase in the selectivity index from 0.59 to 0.94. Comparison of the obtained data on thermal desorption measurements allows to observe a tendency to an increase in the selectivity index with the strengthening of the bond of adsorbed hydrogen with the catalyst surface. Analysis of the reaction products shown in Table 2 reveals that under the hydrogenation conditions, the butyl aldehyde not only turns into butyl alcohol but also undergoes destructive endothermic decomposition [23–25]. It should be noted that in the first minute, both butyl alcohol and propane are formed. In the beginning, active surface-adsorbed hydrogen takes part in the formation of butyl alcohol, after a slowdown in the reaction rate, strongly adsorbed hydrogen arriving at the catalyst surface from its depths. Propane is formed during the destructive endothermic decomposition of butyl aldehyde at the time of adsorption. Table 3 shows that the volume of H2 adsorbed by skeletal nickel is 17.6 ml/g, and the Н2 surface is 63.8 m2/g; for promoted skeletal nickel catalysts, these values increase: in the case of Ru – 26.4 ml/g and 96.0 m2/g; in Rh – 30.0 ml/g and 110.0 m2/g, respectively. This increase is due to an increase in the area on which energetically homogeneous hydrogen is adsorbed. This hydrogen may have a significant effect on the activity of catalysts in the hydrogenation of compounds, the rate of which is limited by the activation of hydrogen. Fig. 3a shows the obtained chromatogram of the butyl aldehyde hydrogenation products. Fig. 3b shows the simultaneous formation of butyl alcohol and propane, and the concentration of butyl alcohol reaches 87.1% (Table 2) by the time of the absorption of 0.75 mol of hydrogen. An intense increase in the concentration of butyl alcohol occurs after butyl aldehyde disappears from the solution. IR spectroscopic studies were carried out (Fig. 4 ) in order to establish the chemical structure of n-butyl alcohol [27]. IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 FT-IR spectrometer with a Miracle ATR attachment (Pike Technologies) in the frequency range 600–4000 cm−1."
10,Conclusion,"The method has been developed for the hydrogenation of butyl aldehydes under mild conditions, which helps to reduce energy costs. Novel efficient catalytic systems based on the alloyed nickel catalyst containing Ru or Rh additives have been created, which allow increasing the hydrogenation process rate by 1.7–1.9 times as compared to the skeletal nickel catalyst without additives. The hydrogenation of butyl aldehydes under mild conditions proceeds with high selectivity and stability ensures the quality of the target product and is of practical interest for improving the technology for the production of butyl alcohols."
