0,Introduction,"Petro-based synthetic polymers are used globally for food packaging, with a high impact on the environment due to their poor biodegradability. This plastic waste is a major global concern: plastic is commonly found in the oceans, it does not easily decompose and it is often ingested by marine animals. Further, plastic waste incineration and pyrolytic conversion results in the emission of hazardous atmospheric pollutants (Ilyas et al., 2018). The main purpose of packaging is the preservation of food products from deterioration. The research effort is now focused on suitable biocompatible polymers production with sufficient barrier, thermal, optical, and mechanical properties at low cost (Abdullah, Dong, Davies, & Barbhuiya, 2017). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is one of the most used synthetic biopolymers used for packaging thanks to its good compatibility, processability, and mechanical properties. PVA is water-soluble and can be produced with molecular weight comprised between 20,000 and 400,000 Da, and different degrees of hydrolysis. These features influence the tensile strength and solubility of the material (Abdullah et al., 2017). PVA however lacks antimicrobial or antioxidant properties necessary to preserve food especially fresh-cut preparations, where mechanical processing damages limit the shelf-life of products (Oms-Oliu et al., 2010). Antibacterial packaging based on PVA has been produced using organic acids (Suganthi, Vignesh, Sundar, & Raj, 2020), chitosan (Olewnik-Kruszkowska et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2013) among others. Furthermore, PVA or its blends can be reinforced and can obtain antimicrobial effects with nanofillers such as graphene oxides (Huang et al., 2012; Liu, Bian et al., 2016; Liu, Bandyopadhyay, Kim, Moon, & Lee, 2016), carbon nanotubes (Liu, Barber, Nuriel, & Wagner, 2005; Zhao et al., 2008) and silver nanoparticles (Wang et al., 2020). However the use of these nanomaterials, however the toxicity of these carbon-based material when in contact with food or released in the environment hasn’t been fully characterized (Cavion et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Precisely, it is relevant to develop antibacterial packaging that allows preserving quality and nutritional value of food, while maintaining environmental sustainability and safety for human health. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a thiol-containing amino acid that has been largely used in medicine thanks to its mucolytic capability that allows for disruption of disulfide bonds in mucus. Moreover, NAC has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties (Šalamon, Kramar, Marolt, Poljšak, & Milisav, 2019). The sulfhydryl group (–SH) within the NAC molecule scavenges reactive oxygen species, making it useful in medical conditions such as hyperglycemia-induced oxidative damage, liver diseases, and traumatic brain injury or as a dietary supplement in psychiatric conditions (Šalamon et al., 2019). NAC has also antimicrobial properties and promotes the breakdown of bacterial biofilms, as shown by its efficacy against infections caused by endodontic and skin pathogens (Eroshenko, Polyudova, & Korobov, 2017; Moon et al., 2016). NAC is also capable of inhibiting Xylella fastidiosa, a plant bacterial pathogen that causes diseases in many different crops(Muranaka et al., 2013) and towards other phytopatogens (Picchi, Takita, Coletta‐Filho, Machado, & de Souza, 2016). In this paper, we develop a simple, green method to create a biodegradable smart packaging capable of release of NAC when in contact with food moisture. By curing PVA and NAC at high temperature, we created thin mechanical resistant films that inhibit growth of S. aureus and E. coli, two important bacterial pathogens and food poisoners. Further, we demonstrate that NAC improves mechanical properties of PVA, prevents food browning and that PVA-NAC films are water soluble at T>85 °C. Our method is suitable to be applied for food preservation even in economically challenged situations and is completely sustainable for the environment."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 98 % hydrolyzed, MW 78,000 Polysciences, Inc, Germany), N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), PBS1X (GIBCO TermoFisher, USA)."
3,Film production,"2.2 Film production The films were prepared dissolving PVA in ultrapure water and stirring the solution for 2 h at 80 °C. PVA solution was degassed by microwave (1 min, 800 W). PVA was used at fixed concentration (10 %), while NAC was used at two concentrations, 5,7 mM or 22,8 mM, to obtain respectively PVA-NAC low concentration (PVA-NAC-L) and PVA-NAC high concentration (PVA-NAC-H) samples. Concentrations have been selected on the basis of (i) the known range of therapeutic concentration of NAC, comprised between 4 and 10 mM (Zuin et al., 2005), and (ii) our initial experiments on the calculation of minimum inhibitory concentration of soluble NAC against E.coli (5.7 mM, similarly to data available in literature (Olofsson, Hermansson, & Elwing, 2003). We tested quadruplicated concentration (22.8 mM) to increase the mechanical strength of PVA films and resistance to solubility in hot water (85 °C). For small round films, 250 μL of PVA or PVA-NAC were poured into silicon wells and let dry for 24 h at 37 °C to allow the formation of a uniform film. Then films were cured at 140 °C for 2 h. The thickness of films was kept constant by adjusting the volume of PVA or PVA-NAC according to mold diameters for each experiment."
4,"Scanning electron microsopy, atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","2.3 Scanning electron microsopy, atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on gold sputter coated samples with a SEM Supra 25 (Zeiss, Germany). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed with NanoWizard II (JPK Instruments AG, Berlin, Germany). The images were acquired using silicon cantilevers (CSC37 Mikro-Masch, Tallinn, Estonia). The average roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the samples has been calculated using JPK software as reported previously (Maiorana et al., 2015). The chemical analysis of the films was carried out using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) by Spectrum One spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) in the range of 4000–700 cm−1 as reported previously (De Maio et al., 2020)."
5,"Thickness, moisture content, mass loss and degradation","2.4 Thickness, moisture content, mass loss and degradation A digital micrometer (Fervi Pro Smart Equipment C033/150) was used to measure film thickness at 10 random positions. Moisture content (MC) was determined on film samples cut into round pieces (20 mm in diameter) by measuring the reduction in the mass of a minimum of 3 rounded films following oven drying (105 °C for 24 h). The results are expressed as g of water/100 g of material (Baron, Pérez, Salcedo, Córdoba, & do Amaral Sobral, 2017). Measurements have been performed in triplicate. Mass loss at room temperature was calculated after submerging samples in 1 mL of ddH2O and drying samples at fixed time intervals at 105 °C to determine sample dry weight. The mass loss of samples was calculated using the following equation: M a s s l o s s ( % ) = ( W 0 - W t ) / W 0 × 100 Where W 0 and W t are the initial mass and mass of sample at any time t, respectively. To investigate the degradation of films, PVA, PVA-NAC-L and PVA-NAC-H films were submerged in 15 mL of ddH2O and incubated at 60 °C or 80 °C. NAC release from films has been quantified by submerging films in ddH2O in a multi well and acquiring absorbance from supernatants for 24 h. Release has been anaylized as previously reported in literature (Cheung, Porter, & McKay, 2001; Gonzo & Gonzo, 2005; Romero et al., 2016, 2018; Tseng, Wu, & Juang, 2003). The model adopted follows a lumped second-order kinetic where the NAC release rate is directly proportional to the square of the amount of NAC available in the membrane at each moment according to the following equation (1) d M t d t = k ( M ∞ - M t ) 2 where k, Mt and M∞ are the rate, the total amount of NAC released at time t, and the amount of NAC feasible to be released at equilibrium, respectively. By elementary integration, between the initial condition (t = 0, Mt = 0) and any other (t = t, Mt = Mt), the following equation is obtained: (2) M t = a t b + t where: a = M ∞ a n d b = 1 k 1 M ∞ It has been found that this model satisfactorily describes processes in which there are various steps involved, and when the drug concentration in the release medium increases steadily. (Cheung et al., 2001; Gonzo & Gonzo, 2005; Romero et al., 2016, 2018; Tseng et al., 2003). All measurements were carried out in triplicate."
6,Solubility and swelling,"2.5 Solubility and swelling Film samples cut in squares (20 mm side), weighted, and submerged in 50 mL of distilled water under stirring (60 rpm, room temperature, 24 h) were used. Film samples were then removed from the solution, weighted to obtain the mass of water adsorbed, and dried in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h to determine the final dry weight. At fixed time intervals, the water absorbed sample was wiped with a tissue paper, and then the sample was weighted. The swelling ratio of samples obtained using the following equation: S w e l l i n g r a t i o = W s - W d W d × 100 % Where W s and W d are swollen and dry samples weight, respectively. Experiments were done in triplicate."
7,Mechanical properties,"2.6 Mechanical properties Tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EB), and elastic modulus (EM) were measured according to previous studies (Pérez-Córdoba et al., 2018) using 10 × 40 mm strip and a mechanical analyzer (Univert CellScale system, Germany). The grip separation was 20 mm and the speed rate of 1 mm/s until breaking. At least 3 sample strips from each film were used."
8,Light transmission and transparency,"2.7 Light transmission and transparency Light transmission of films was determined in transmittance mode at selected wavelengths (250−700 nm) using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cytation 3 Biotek, USA), according to method described previously (Bonilla & Sobral, 2016)."
9,Cell Culture and viability measurements,"2.8 Cell Culture and viability measurements ATTC A549 cells (ATCC® CCL-185™) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) as previously reported (Perini et al., 2020). For cell viability measurements, A549 were plated on 96-well flat bottom plates (Corning, USA), at a concentration of 1 × 10^4 cells/well, in a volume of 100 μL and treated with PVA, PVA-NAC-L or PVA-NAC-H dissolved in 1x PBS (concentration range 0.03−1 mg/mL). Incubation as carried for 24 h. To measure cell viability, CellTiter-Glo (Promega) reagent was added in each well according to manufacturer’s instructions and luminescence was recorded with Cytation 3 (Biotek) keeping an integration time of 1 s per well. Results are reported normalized to control cells (untreated)."
10,Antibacterial effects,"2.9 Antibacterial effects Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC 29213 were used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of PVA and PVA-NAC films. PVA and PVA-NAC films (1 cm diameter) were sterilized under UV-light prior each experiment to avoid contamination. Bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C overnight, and then sub-inoculated into fresh broth. Two hours after subinoculum, bacterial cells were harvested via centrifugation and diluted in PBS 1X to a final cell concentration of ∼105 colony forming units (CFUs)/mL. 0.5 mL of bacterial suspension was added to the wells containing PVA films. The plate was then incubated 37 °C for 3 h to allow NAC release. Then 0.1 mL of the bacterial suspension was harvested, diluted and plated on LB agar plates to measure CFUs. The antibacterial rate was calculated according to: Antibacterial ratio (%) = (N0-N)/N0 × 100, where N is the number of CFU in the PVA-NAC, and N0 is the number of bacteria in the control group (PVA)."
11,Results and discussion,"In this work, we produced PVA and PVA-NAC films to obtain a biodegradable material for food packaging with antibacterial properties. PVA was used at a fixed concentration (10 %), while NAC was used at two concentrations, 5.7 mM or 22,8 mM, to obtain respectively PVA-NAC low (PVA-NAC-L) and PVA-NAC high (PVA-NAC-H) concentration samples. PVA and PVA-NAC films were visually homogeneous with no cracks, scratches, bubbles, or phase separation. Samples thickness was constant with no significant differences in presence of NAC (Table 1 ). Moisture content wasn’t significantly different between samples. Films cross section obtained by SEM is reported in Fig. 1 a. Films surface morphology and roughness have been characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 1(b–d). Typical AFM surface maps of PVA, PVA-NAC-L and PVA-NAC-H are reported in Fig. 1b, c and d respectively. PVA and PVA-NAC films show a uniform surface. The inclusion of NAC into the biopolymer didn’t significantly change the films average roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq) (Table 1). FTIR spectroscopy was carried out on PVA, NAC, PVA-NAC-L and PVA-NAC-H (Fig. 1e). Characteristic peaks of PVA are highlighted with dashed lines and peaks typical of NAC are indicated with a continuous black line. The broad band in the range of 3700−3000 cm−1 can be associated with stretching of hydroxyl (OH) groups present on PVA (Kharazmi et al., 2015; Sabzi, Afshari, Babaahmadi, & Shafagh, 2020). Peaks around 2910 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 are related to asymmetrical and symmetrical CH stretching vibration of PVA respectively (Sabzi et al., 2020) and are conserved in both PVA-NAC-L and PVA-NAC-H samples. Peaks at 1720 and 1426 cm−1 are present on both PVA and PVA-NAC samples, due to CO carbonyl stretch and CH2 bending vibration, respectively (Lee, Isobe, & Senna, 1996). Peaks at 1080 and 834 cm−1 are visible on both PVA and PVA-NAC are related to CO stretching of acetyl groups and CC stretching vibration respectively (Omkaram, Chakradhar, & Rao, 2007; Sabzi et al., 2020). A peak at 1550 cm−1 is visible only on NAC and PVA-NAC films, due to the typical stretching of NH of NAC (Kumar, Srivastava, & Dutta, 2013). The stretching at 1220 cm−1 due to amide III is present on NAC sample, but not on PVA films enriched with NAC (Picquart, Abedinzadeh, Grajcar, & Baron, 1998). Furthermore, the disappearance of the thiol group of NAC highlighted by the absence of a characteristic peak at 2550 cm−1, indicates an interaction between NAC and PVA (Du, Liao, Yang, Qin, & Liang, 2017). The polymer PVA has a linear structure with a carbon backbone chains. Linear chains in PVA planar structure inter-bridge by the weak H bonding coming from (or through) the OH groups (Gautam, Singh, & Ram, 2007). Where the molecular layers of H-bonded monomers are interbridged from the OH groups, the structure is more compact. At the surfaces, PVA has plenty of OH groups free from the H-bonding with electrons arranged in a definite localized distribution over the surface. Our hypothesis is that NAC acetyl groups contribute to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PVA monomers. Inclusion of the NAC into PVA does not influence the transparency of films (Fig. 1f), however transmittance is significantly reduced in the wavelength range of 250−350 nm in PVA-NAC films compared to PVA films (Fig. 1g). This is caused by the ability of NAC to absorb UV light in a concentration-dependent fashion as shown in Fig. 1h. These data indicate that this type of packaging can act as a barrier to radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) light region and can protect food from light and avoid deterioration. Morphological, chemical and optical analysis of films demonstrate that NAC interacts with PVA into films without changing films topography but improving optical properties. For food contact, thin resistant films are necessary. For this reason, we characterized films mechanical properties that will affect packaging integrity. Mechanical properties of films are improved when a high concentration of NAC is used to cure PVA films as shown by values resumed in Table 2 . In Fig. 2 , the experimental setup for the mechanical tensile test (Fig. 2a) and representative stress-strain curves obtained for each sample (Fig. 2b) are reported. Samples with highly concentrated NAC (PVA-NAC-H) show a significant increase in Young Modulus and Tensile strength (Table 2), while elongation at break of film is slightly reduced. This indicates that NAC improves the mechanical performance of packaging. NAC stabilize the structure increasing the resistance against fracture and the thermal stability. It has been shown how the presence of the acetyl group causes more high occupancy H-bonds along the inter-sheet direction of PVA, and H-bond occupancy is correlated to strength of cohesion along a plane (Cui, Yu, & Lau, 2016). An H-bond with higher occupancy leads to greater fracture strength according to stochastic theory of fracture. Therefore NAC acetyl groups might contribute to the formation of stable H-bonds (higher occupancy) along the PVA inter-sheet direction. Packaging degradability is fundamental to reduce plastic waste in the environment. PVA and PVA-NAC samples maintain their integrity in water at environmental temperature (22 °C), even for long periods (40 days). This is typical of the fully hydrolyzed PVA, which dissolves only at high temperature (Fan, 2008). At 65 °C, PVA and PVA-NAC start losing their structure although a high concentration of NAC reinforces films as demonstrated by mechanical characterization. Precisely, at 65 °C, PVA and PVA-NAC-L films become sticky in ∼20 min, while PVA-NAC-H samples resist degradation (Fig. 3 a). However at 85 °C, all samples lose integrity in 10 min, proving the possibility to use high-temperature water to solubilize packaging after usage. The mechanism of degradation is essentially the same of PVA which is soluble in water according to the degree of hydrolysis(Hassan, Trakampan, & Peppas, 2002). PVA with higher degree of hydrolysis need high temperature of water for dissolution due to the increased intermolecular H bonds. The presence of NAC, that increases the H-bonding can slow down the rate of soluiblity even at high temperature. To verify wether PVA residues were harmful for euckaryotic cells, we tested cytotoxicity of solubilized PVA films on A549 cell line (Fig. 3b) and cell viability was not affected after 24 h treatment with solubilized PVA films. During food contact, dry films become hydrated, we therefore analysed behaviour of films in 1 mL of ddH2O at room temperature. Firstly, we observed that PVA-NAC films exhibit a certain percentage of mass loss compared to pure PVA (Fig. 3c) and we observed that mass loss corresponded to the initial NAC concentration of each sample. NAC influences also the ability of films to swell. PVA-NAC-H films displays the highest swelling after 24 h in water, caused by the NAC intercalation into PVA polymeric structure (Fig. 3d). Since we measured a loss of the NAC embedded in 24 h, we wanted to characterize this release during contact with water. For this reason, we exploited the absorbing light ability of NAC at 230 nm to analyze the release kinetics from PVA films (Fig. 3e). After 2 h, NAC release is maximum both from PVA-NAC-H and PVA-NAC-L films. Release has been anaylized as previously reported in literature (Cheung et al., 2001; Gonzo & Gonzo, 2005; Romero et al., 2016; Romero et al., 2018; Tseng et al., 2003). The model adopted follows a lumped second-order kinetic where the NAC release rate is directly proportional to the square of the amount of NAC available in the membrane at each moment (see Materials and Methods). Using to this model, we obtained the results reported in Table 3 . We measured that the total amount of NAC released at equilibrium has OD values of 0.17 and 0.29, corresponding to 1.16 μg/mL and 1.98 μg/mL of NAC for PVA-NAC-L and PVA-NAC-H respectively. From b values, we can recover the ratio k (PVA-NAC-H)/ k (PVA-NAC-L) that is 0.9 ± 0.2. This value, comparable with the expeted value of 1, shows that the kinetic of the release is proportional to the NAC mass in the film and that the lumped second-order kinetic model correctly describes the release of NAC from films. NAC release occurs also when in contact with fresh cut food (Fig. 3f). The moisture released from food induces NAC release and the browning is prevented. It is likely that NAC antioxidant activity can prevent the initiation of browning by reacting with oxygen or with the intermediate products, breaking the chain reaction and preventing the formation of melanin (Ioannou, 2013). NAC is also known for its antibiofilm and antioxidant properties, therefore we tested the effect of NAC released from films on two pathogens, S.aureus and E.coli growth has been totally inhibited with supernatants from PVA-NAC-H films (Fig. 4 ). We calculated that 100 % of inhibition has been obtained with a NAC concentration of 0.8 mg/mL for S.aureus and 0.7 mg/mL for E.coli. NAC is a thiol-containing antioxidant that disrupts disulfide bonds in mucus and competitively inhibits amino acid (cysteine) utilization (Olofsson et al., 2003). Several studies demonstrated the ability of NAC in reducing biofilm formation (Feng et al., 2018). Mechanism of action is still not clear and species-dependent, possibly NAC reduces adhesion of bacteria and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) production, either by interacting with disulfide bonds in enzymes involved in EPS production or excretion, or by competitive inhibition of cysteine utilization (Olofsson et al., 2003)."
12,Conclusions,"The use of single-use plastics in packaging is increasing dramatically the pollution of our environment. This work proposes a new sustainable, two-step method to produce highly transparent mechanical resistant PVA films modified with the bioactive compound N-acetylcysteine. PVA-NAC films represent a non-toxic innovative packaging material with multifunctional effects. PVA-NAC films have the ability to protect food from browning and reduce food exposure to UV light. Further NAC improves mechanical properties of films without changing PVA solubility at 85 °C. When in contact with moisture, the released NAC is effective against pathogens and food poisoning bacteria S.aureus and E.coli. This strategy for PVA modification is not based on release of harmful antibiotics or nanomaterials deriving from packaging disposal. The findings in this work can be exploited to create a smart packaging of food but also in cosmetic industries."
