0,Introduction,"The world energy demand has tripled since 1949 and is still increasing mainly due to the industrial development in China and India but also due to the globally fast growing transport sector. Today, 86% of the world energy consumption and almost 100% of the energy used in the transportation sector is constituted by fossil fuels [1]. Within this centennial it is assumed that the world's accessible oil reservoirs will be close to depletion and it is, therefore very important to develop suitable long-term technologies based upon renewable energy that gradually can substitute the declining fossil fuel production. Also fossil fuels have had a major impact on the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. At present, the CO 2 concentration is the highest ever recorded, exceeding pre-industrial concentrations by almost 100ppm and are far above concentrations measured in gas pockets of ice cores, reaching back 400.000 years [2]. One possible successor to the fossil fuel era is the establishment of a hydrogen society, where hydrogen produced from renewable sources is the primary energy carrier (Fig. 1 ). The two most important challenges are to generate enough hydrogen from renewable sources and to lower the production cost of hydrogen. Other problems concerned are the storage, distribution and utilization of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, since this is the most cost-effective [3]. However, several ways of producing hydrogen by other technologies and from renewable resources are emerging. An obvious source of hydrogen is seawater, which can be split by electrolysis, and splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen on metal surfaces has been the focus of several recent studies, e.g., [4]. The electricity needed for this can be produced from renewable sources such as sun, wind and geothermal energy [5]. Also biomass can be used as a source for hydrogen production [6]. To minimize conflicts with global food supply, however, agricultural and municipal waste should be the preferred biomass for energy production. This is possible but more difficult compared to the conversion of crops such as corn and sugarcane that are rich in starch and sugar [7]. Using waste as an energy source, both reduces the CO 2 emission and exploits an otherwise unused product."
1,Biological hydrogen production from biomass,"Biological production of hydrogen from biomass proceeds through either dark fermentation or photofermentation. Biophotolytic production of hydrogen is carried out by some algae and cyanobacteria, but since this is not a biomass converting process, it will not be considered in this review."
2,Dark fermentation,"2.1 Dark fermentation Dark fermentation of organic matter is an obligate series of microbial processes occurring under anaerobic conditions when no electron acceptors ( O 2 , NO 3 - , SO 4 2 - , Fe 3 + , etc.) are present. A part of the substrate carbon is oxidized and another part is reduced leading to the formation of products that are more or less oxidized than the original substrate. Electrons derived from this process are used for the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen. In all thermodynamically feasible dark fermentation processes exploited by known microorganisms, hydrogen is only produced in combination with volatile fatty acids (VFA) and/or alcohols—never as the single reduced compound. Therefore, the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield of 12mol/mol (Table 1 ), from complete conversion of glucose to hydrogen and carbon dioxide is never attained in known biological in vivo systems. Due to these thermodynamic constraints, the maximum attainable hydrogen yield from hexose fermentation is considered to be 4mol/mol and can be performed by numerous species belonging to bacterial genera such as Enterobacter and Clostridium (reaction 3, Fig. 2 ) [8]. The production of larger amounts of H 2 would happen at the expense of cell growth, which would cause evolutionary elimination. In practical fermentation processes the yield is even lower (Table 2 ) since a very low hydrogen partial pressure is required to avoid that competing intracellular H 2 consuming reactions leading to smaller H 2 yields are favored [9]. To circumvent this, purging with N 2 or Ar has been attempted [10]. This increases the hydrogen yield closer to the attainable maximum, but also demands subsequent gas separation. Since the H 2 yield is a function of the equilibrium of the reactions in Table 1, temperature, substrate and product concentrations as well as pH influence the maximum H 2 outcome. A major problem in direct fermentation of agricultural and municipal wastes is the activity of hydrogen utilizing acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea present in the substrate, which rapidly will convert hydrogen to acetate and methane (Table 1). Several other hydrogen utilizing processes can occur in open systems and it is, therefore, necessary to sterilize the substrate and inoculate with specific organisms. Decreasing the hydraulic retention time and lowering of pH has been shown to inhibit hydrogen consuming microbes since most of these grow relatively slowly and at neutral pH [11,12]. Also, a high-temperature pretreatment step is often included if lignocellulosic material is used as substrate. This will sterilize the material. To go beyond the border of 4mol hydrogen/mol hexose and approach the theoretical maximum of 12mol of hydrogen it might be possible to engineer suitable organisms since potentially usable biochemical pathways are known. This has to our knowledge not been practiced in living cells, but Woodward et al. [13] have demonstrated that it was possible to generate 11.6mol H 2 per mol glucose-6-phosphate by combining the enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle under optimized in vitro conditions. The ongoing intensive genome sequencing of microorganisms will result in a further understanding of pathways leading to hydrogen formation and might also elucidate potential means to modify these pathways, combining pathways from organisms of ecological niches and taxonomic groups which do not meet in nature."
3,Integrated photofermentative hydrogen production,"2.2 Integrated photofermentative hydrogen production The low hydrogen yield attained in dark fermentation reactions and the residual VFA in the fermentation liquor has led to the obvious combination of the dark fermentation process with a bacterial photosynthetic hydrogen production process converting VFA to H 2 and CO 2 . Purple non-sulfur bacteria can utilize VFA such as acetate as electron donors in a hydrogen producing light driven process catalyzed by nitrogenase under nitrogen deficient conditions. The theoretical yield of this process is 8mol H 2 per mol of acetate (reaction 3, Fig. 2). Numerous experiments have been carried out on photofermentative H 2 production either with different wastes as direct substrate or in series following a dark fermentation reactor [14,15]. A major challenge in this process is the demand for anaerobic photobioreactors taking up large areas. Claasen et al. calculated that the required area of a photobioreactor converting the effluent of a 450 m 3 dark fermentation reactor would be 12ha since the solar conversion efficiency and the production rates are very low [15]. In a recent analysis of practical application of biohydrogen production, Levin et al. [16] calculated the reactor volume necessary to power a 1kW PEM fuel cell. The necessary volume of a mesophilic dark fermentation reactor was 0.2 – 1.14 m 3 , while a photobioreactor yielding the same amount of H 2 would have a volume of 149 m 3 . Similar to the dark fermentation processes, genome sequencing and analysis might also lead to improvement of photofermentative processes, which so far only have been improved by unspecific mutagenesis. Photofermentative hydrogen production using current state of the art organisms and technology has, however, been considered economically unrealistic by many authors [16,17]."
4,Chemical conversion of biomass to hydrogen,"Presently, most hydrogen is manufactured from fossil resources and is immediately, and without separation, utilized at the same industrial site as a feedstock for large-scale commodity chemicals, e.g., for production of ammonia and methanol [18]. The most important processes for hydrogen production are coal gasification and catalytic steam-reforming of alkanes, primarily methane. By use of the steam-reforming technology, which is the most energy-efficient process for hydrogen production today, it is possible to construct plants with production capacities in excess of 250 000 m 3 H 2 (STP) per hour [19]. Ideally, four molecules of hydrogen are formed for each molecule of methane when it reacts with water according to reaction 8 (Fig. 2). However, in practice about 1 3 of the methane must be combusted to supply the energy needed for the endothermic steam-reforming reaction which is typically conducted at temperatures about 800 ∘ C [20]. The cost of hydrogen supplied by either coal gasification or catalytic steam-reforming is very dependent on the cost of the fossil feedstock and on the need for transportation. Relatively modest improvements in these mature, and energy-efficient technologies are expected but currently there are significant efforts to design and construct plants with increasing production capacities to benefit from the economy-of-scale. This development is largely driven by the desire to produce liquid transportation fuels from natural gas (and possibly at some point from coal) in the Fischer–Tropsch process [21]. The degradation of biomass into hydrogen requires rupture of C–C, C–O, C–H and O–H bonds, and formation of H–H and new C–O and O–H bonds. This can be achieved in biomass gasification which, in principle, is analogous to coal gasification in an essentially thermal process [22]. However, recently it has been shown that biomass monomers, such as glucose, can be steam-reformed at relatively mild conditions, e.g., 200 ∘ C , into hydrogen [23] in the presence of suitable catalysts [24]. In principle, one molecule of glucose could be reacted with water to produce 12 molecules of hydrogen (Table 1). So far it has, however, only been possible to achieve about six molecules of hydrogen since methane is formed simultaneously by catalytic CO or CO 2 hydrogenation."
5,Biomass conversion in biorefineries,"Traditionally, the development of biological processes to transform biomass to more versatile energy carriers has focused on the production of one energy carrier, either hydrogen, methane, or ethanol. During the last decade, however, several studies have been carried out on the production of methane and hydrogen in two-step processes [25–27]. Among the energy carriers, only methane is released from the conversion of organic matter in nature; both hydrogen and ethanol are intermediates during anaerobic degradation and are further metabolized to methane in nature [28]. The production of these two energy carriers, therefore, demands a physical separation of individual processes in the anaerobic degradation chain, or the use of defined microbial cultures under controlled conditions. This can be carried out in a biorefinery, which is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass [29]. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's petroleum refineries, which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum. Industrial biorefineries have been identified as the most promising route to the creation of a new biobased industry [30]. By producing multiple products, a biorefinery can take advantage of the differences in biomass components and intermediates and maximize the value derived from the biomass feedstock. A biorefinery might, for example, produce one or several low-volume, but high-value, chemical products and a low-value, but high-volume liquid transportation fuel, while generating electricity and process heat for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity. The high-value products enhance profitability, the high-volume fuel helps meet national energy needs, and the power production reduces costs and avoids greenhouse-gas emissions. An example of a biorefinery for production of several products by the biochemical route is now under construction in Tennessee in a joint venture between the companies Dupont and Tate and Lyle. The plant will produce a mixture of compounds including a bio-polymer (1,3 propandiol) with the same properties as polyester in addition to other products including ethanol using corn as raw material. Production of the new biopolymer Bio-PDO™ uses 40% less energy than would be needed to produce a petroleum-based equivalent. The new plant will save the equivalent of 10 million gallons of gasoline per year, or enough to fuel 22,000 cars annually [http://npe.dupont.com/pr-npe-renew-rsrcs.html]."
6,Energy production in biorefineries,"4.1 Energy production in biorefineries There is currently a tremendous world-wide interest in the production of ethanol from biomass, and in countries like USA and China, major national biofuel programs have been initiated to produce cost-efficient ethanol and other fuels from agricultural and forestry lignocellulosic biomasses. Technologically, lignocellulosic biomass is pre-treated by acid hydrolysis or other physical or/and chemical methods, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to open the plant fibers and to convert the polymers of cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars accessible to fermenting microorganisms such as bakers yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The hydrolysis processes are, however, costly and S. cerevisiae is unable to ferment pentoses released from hemicelluloses. Yeast strains carrying out this process have, however, been constructed, but the rates and yields are still low [31,32]. Therefore, several new types of fermentations are currently being developed using different species of bacteria instead of, or as a supplement to, yeast fermentation. The use of extremophilic bacteria growing at temperatures close to the boiling temperature of ethanol has been appealing since a continuous stripping of ethanol can be performed reducing product inhibition problems caused by high ethanol concentrations [33]. Similar to the dark fermentative production of hydrogen, bacterial ethanol production often results in other products such as hydrogen and organic acids to maintain the electron balance and the thermodynamic efficiency. To yield the maximum available energy from biomass conversion, therefore, a combination of two or more biological processes in biorefinery concepts is obvious. The Danish Bioenergy Concept is such a combinatory system approach (Fig. 3 ) [34]: Briefly biomass is pre-treated by wet oxidation to convert lignocellulosic compounds and to increase the availability of fermentable sugars, which are subsequently fermented to ethanol by yeast cells. Pentoses, which are not converted by yeasts, are then fermented to ethanol and hydrogen in a thermophilic fermentation process. Manure can be mixed in as a cheap source of water and as a way to increase production of methane from the effluent from the ethanol/hydrogen process. Process water can be partly re-circulated after purification in the methane step. Instead of concentrating on the biological production of only one energy carrier, the simultaneous production of hydrogen, methane, and ethanol leaves the possibility to optimize the exploitation of the specific energy carriers to suit specific needs corresponding to the current use of specific fossil fuels for specific purposes. Hydrogen can for instance be used in fuel cells for urban transportation. Ethanol can be used in fuel cells in rural areas, and methane can be used for local electricity and heat production in fuel cells or microturbines. Despite the obvious advantages of combining the production of different energy carriers, only few concepts have been published. Common to the known concepts is a much better exploitation of the biomass by suiting specific microbiological processes to the conversion of different fractions of the substrates to different fuels. The different processes are thereby exploited in an additive sequential fermentation transforming most of the energy available in the substrate to usable energy carriers. The production of several energy carriers leaves the possibility to optimize the production of one energy carrier at the expense of the other carriers by choice of microorganisms and operation conditions, and by genetic modification of the microorganisms. Currently the Danish Bioenergy Concept is optimized with respect to ethanol production. Furthermore, biorefineries might be considered as more environmentally friendly processes since process water and nutrients from the different processes can be recirculated, and waste production can be kept minimal."
7,Bio/catalytic conversion of biomass to bioenergy,"4.2 Bio/catalytic conversion of biomass to bioenergy A further development of the biorefinery, and a promising alternative to specialized fermentative hydrogen production is the use of hybrid techniques combining biological conversion with catalytic down-stream processing (Fig. 4 ). This might particularly be relevant in the replacement of gasoline with hydrogen in the automobile sector where the storage technology of sufficient amounts of hydrogen has still not been satisfactorily solved [35]. Highly efficient autothermal reformers capable of converting 1mol ethanol to 5mol hydrogen have recently been demonstrated [36]. Since 2mol of ethanol can be achieved for each sugar molecule, the hydrogen yield of this two-step process is 83% of the theoretical maximum compared to the 10–20% achieved by direct hydrogen fermentation. So far, however, the only known catalyst for the autothermal process is an extremely expensive supported rhodium catalyst [37]. As described in Section 3, it is possible to convert various carbohydrates and lower alcohols directly into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon oxides by aqueous phase reforming conducted at about 200 ∘ C . In principle, the low-temperature aqueous phase reforming process can supply even more hydrogen than the autothermal reforming process, but this process is endothermic and thus requires continuous heating. Therefore, both of these processes hold potential for integration with a biorefinery designed to co-produce hydrogen. In scenarios, where stand-alone hydrogen facilities are desired, the autothermal reforming process would be preferred, especially if cheaper catalysts were developed. In scenarios where process integration is extensive, the low-temperature aqueous reforming process might represent the best choice, since other process streams, such as methane, can be used to provide the required heating. For both reforming processes, further developments are required before they can be implemented into large-scale applications. Particularly, more stable and less-expensive catalysts are required, and additionally, the preferred catalyst systems need to be tested with relevant feedstocks from a biorefinery. The introduction of downstream catalytic conversion of biofuels leaves the possibility to combine a less complex fuel handling technology (ethanol instead of hydrogen) for transportation purposes with all the benefits of the fuel cell technology. In the transition period before a hydrogen-based energy economy has been realized, a gradual change to the use of renewable energy can be facilitated by the use of suitable biofuels in existing internal combustion engines. Acidic zeolite catalysts have attracted considerable attention as a possible means of converting fossil resources such as coal or natural gas into transportable liquid fuels via synthesis gas. In fact, for a significant period of time, the so-called methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process was performed on an industrial scale to supply the majority of all gasoline consumed in New Zealand [38]. Since then Gayobo et al. and Aguayo et al. have demonstrated the conversion of ethanol into liquid fuels (biogasoline) [39,40]. Although compressed methane, and ethanol in even high ethanol:gasoline mixtures can be used with few modifications of the engines, biogasoline produced by catalytic conversion of methane and bioethanol will have fewer implications with respect to logistics and end use. If aviation and air transport are sustained in future transportation scenarios, the availability of safe liquid fuels with high energy content storable under ambient conditions is a prerequisite. Neither hydrogen, methane nor ethanol fulfill these requirements while hydrocarbons produced catalytically from refined biomass might constitute a satisfactory solution. A current environmental concern regarding bioethanol:gasoline mixtures is the increase in vapor pressure in the mixture caused by ethanol. We suggest that catalytic conversion of ethanol to gasoline could solve this problem in the transition period towards a hydrogen-based society."
