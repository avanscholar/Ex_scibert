0,Introduction,"Climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels form the driving force behind the utilization of alternative and renewable energy sources [1–5]. Among various energy alternatives, biofuels, hydrogen, natural gas and syngas (synthesis gas) arise as the four strategically important sustainable fuel sources in the future. Recent studies have shown that between these four, biofuels are promising fuel source of the future due to their renewability, biodegradability, and generation of acceptable quality exhaust gases [6]. They can be produced domestically from a wide variety of biomass sources [7,8]. Derived from lignocellulose biomass, furfural is regaining attention as a bio-based alternative for the production of several products from antacids to fertilizers, plastics, and paints. Recently, it was identified as one of the most promising chemicals for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals in 21st century [9]. It is the natural dehydration product of five-carbon sugars (arabinose and xylose) that are derived from hemicelluloses biomass [10]. The knowledge of thermophysical (density, sound velocity, refractive index and viscosity) and thermodynamic (heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, excess molar volume and excess molar enthalpy) properties [11,12] allow for the development of new correlations and/or predictive models. These properties are also important to investigate the intermolecular interactions that can occur in liquid mixtures, especially where hydrogen bonding occurs [13–16]. In this regard, the present work is a continuation of our systematic studies on thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of binary mixtures containing solvents derived from biomass [17–23]. In this paper, we report the densities, and sound velocities for the binary systems {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} over the entire composition range and at (283.15, 293.15, 303.15 and 313.15)K and at p =1×105 Pa. These results were used to calculate the excess molar volumes, isentropic compressibility, and deviation in isentropic compressibility, respectively, over the entire composition range and at each temperature. The Redlich–Kister polynomial equation was fitted to the excess molar volume and deviation in isentropic compressibility. Four sound velocity mixing rules were applied to the experimental data. The open literature shows that there are no data available for the binary systems investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The chemical substances were supplied by Aldrich Chem. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). The purities of all chemicals, tested by GC (gas chromatography), were better than 0.99 (mass fraction). The source, purification method and purity of all chemicals used in this study are given in Table 1 . The purities of the chemicals were also checked by comparing the experimental density and sound velocity values of the pure chemicals at various temperatures with those reported in literature [24–35]. These results are given in Table 2 . No further purification of these chemicals was required."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure Binary mixtures were prepared by mass, using an OHAUS analytical balance with a precision of ±0.1kg. The estimated error in the mole fraction was 0.0005. The details of the experimental procedure can be found elsewhere [36]. A binary test system (diethyl carbonate+ethanol) [29] was previously measured [21,22] to validate the experimental technique. The calculated excess molar volumes, isentropic compressibility, deviation in isentropic compressibility were compared to literature values. The difference between the experimental and literature excess molar volumes, isentropic compressibility, and deviation in isentropic compressibility was within the experimental error. Density and sound velocity for pure components and binary mixtures were measured using a digital vibrating-tube densimeter and sound velocity analyzer (Anton Paar DSA 5000M) with an accuracy of ±0.02K in temperature. The estimated errors in density and sound velocity were less than ±0.01kgm−3 and ±0.5ms−1, respectively. The instrument can measure simultaneously density in the range from 0 to 3×103 kgm−3 and sound velocity from 1000 to 2000ms−1 in a temperature range from 273.15 to 343.15K with pressure variation from 0 to 0.3×105 Pa. The sound velocity is measured using a propagation time technique [37]. The sample is sandwiched between two piezoelectric ultrasound transducers. One transducer emits sound waves through the sample-filled cavity (frequency around 3MHz) and the second transducer receives those waves. Thus, the sound velocity is obtained by dividing the known distance between transmitter and receiver by the measured propagation time of the sound waves [37]. The estimated error in excess molar volume, isentropic compressibility, deviation in isentropic compressibility is ±0.003×103 m3 mol−1, ±1×1012 Pa−1 and ±0.6×1012 Pa−1, respectively. The structures of furfural and alcohol were optimized based on molecular mechanics and semi-empirical calculations using the HyperChem 7 molecular visualization and simulation program. Initial molecular geometry of furfural and the alcohols viz. ethanol, 1-butanol and 2-butanol were optimized with the AM1 semi-empirical calculations. The optimized molecules of furfural and alcohols were placed on top of each other symmetrically with an inter planar distance of between 2.3 and 3.0Å and the angle of between 50 and 70°. Further, the geometries were optimized using the molecular mechanics (MM+force field), AM1 semi-empirical calculations, and the Polak–Ribiere routine with rms gradient of 0.01 [38,39]. Hydrogen bonds were displayed using HyperChem 7 “show hydrogen bonds” and “recomputed hydrogen bond” options."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermophysical properties,"3.1 Thermophysical properties 3.1.1 Density The density, ρ, was measured at (283.15, 293.15, 303.15 and 313.15)K, and at p =1×105 Pa for the {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} systems and are given in Table 3 . The plots of density versus concentration at investigated temperatures are given in Fig. 1S((a)–(c)). From Fig. 1S ((a)–(c)), it can be seen that the ρ values decreases linearly with an increase in temperature and increases with an increase in the concentration of furfural for all binary systems. 3.1.2 Sound velocity Sound velocity is also an important property which describes the solvent–solvent, solute–solvent and solute–solute interactions in the mixture [40]. In this regards, the sound velocity data, u, were also measured at (283.15, 293.15, 303.15 and 313.15)K, and at p =1×105 Pa for {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} systems and are given in Tables 3. The plots of sound velocity versus concentration, at investigated temperatures, are given in Fig. 2S((a)–(c)). From this Fig. 2S((a)–(c)), it can be seen that the u values also decreases linearly with an increase in temperature and increases with an increase in the concentration of furfural for all binary systems. Further, the sound velocity data were tested using sound velocity mixing rules to calculate the sound velocity of the binary mixture from pure component data. The mixing rules used and tested were of Rao [41] (Eq. (1)), Wada [42] (Eq. (2)), Nomoto [43] (Eq. (3)), and Berryman [44] (Eq. (4)). (1) u 1 / 3 V m = ∑ i = 1 2 u i 1 / 3 x i V i ∴ u = ( Σ i = 1 2 u i 1 / 3 x i V i V m ) 3 (2) κ s − 1 / 7 V m = ∑ i = 1 2 κ s , i − 1 / 7 x i V i ∴ u = ( Σ i = 1 2 u i 2 / 7 ρ i 1 / 7 x i V i ρ 1 / 7 V m ) 7 / 2 (3) u = ( ∑ i = 1 2 ϕ i u i 1 / 3 ) 3 (4) κ s = ∑ i = 1 2 ϕ i κ s , i ∴ u = ( ρ ∑ i = 1 n ϕ i κ s , i ) − 1 / 2 where Vi , ui , xi , and ρi are the molar volume, sound velocity, mole fractions and density of the pure component i, respectively. The average absolute relative deviation (ARD) values were calculated between the experimental and calculated sound velocity data using different mixing rules and are given in Table 4 . These results show that the sound velocity calculated from the different mixing rules was quite good except for the Berryman mixing rule. A maximum average absolute relative deviation of 3.9ms−1 was obtained using the mixing rule of Berryman for the (furfural+ethanol) system at 313.15K."
6,Derived properties,"3.2 Derived properties 3.2.1 Excess molar volume The excess molar volumes, V m E , for systems studied were calculated using Eq. (5) from the density data of the mixture and the pure components: (5) V m E = x 1 M 1 + x 2 M 2 ρ − x 1 M 1 ρ 1 − x 2 M 2 ρ 2 where x 1 and x 2 are mole fractions; M 1 and M 2 denote molar masses; ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities; where 1 refers to furfural and 2 refers to ethanol or 1-butanol or 2-butanol, and ρ is the density of the mixtures. Table 1S represent the results of excess molar volume, V m E , for the {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} systems and are also plotted in Fig. 1 ((a)–(c)). The V m E values are negative for the systems (furfural+ethanol or 1-butanol) and both positive and negative for the system {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)}. To the best of our knowledge there are no data available in the literature for any of the mixtures considered here to compare our results. The molecules of furfural are known to exist as dipolar associate in the pure state [45]. The addition of polar solvents such as alcohols to furfural leads to breaking of these dipolar associates. The negative V m E values for the binary system suggest that the unlike dipolar interactions are stronger and predominant over the structure breaking effects in the mixtures [46–48]. The negative values of {furfural (x 1)+ethanol (x 2)}>{furfural (x 1)+1-butanol (x 2)}>{furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)} are an indication of the presence of stronger unlike interaction in the mixtures and hence follow the expected trend. The positive V m E values of {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)} are due to the dissociation of the hydrogen bonding in 2-butanol being greater than intermolecular bond formation between furfural and 2-butanol [49]. These results indicate that the interaction of furfural with ethanol is stronger than furfural with 1-butanol than furfural with 2-butanol because of the addition of an alkyl group on the alcohol and position of the alkyl group on butanol. The V m , min ⁡ E values were (−0.617, and −0.339)×103 m3 mol−1 occurs at (x 1 =0.4501 and 0.5417), respectively for the systems {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, (x 2)} at all temperatures. Both minimum and maximum values of V m E , were (−0.030, and 0.147)×103 m3 mol−1 at (x 1 =0.8999 and 0.3001), respectively for the system {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)} at all temperatures. In general, the V m E minimum and maximum values increase with an increase in temperature for all the systems. 3.2.2 Isentropic compressibility, and deviation in isentropic compressibility The isentropic compressibility, κ s, was calculated using the Newton–Laplace equation given below: (6) κ s = 1 ρ u 2 where ρ is the density and u is the sound velocity of the binary mixtures. The deviations in isentropic compressibility, Δκ s (x), were calculated using Eq. (7): (7) Δ κ s ( x ) = κ s − ∑ i 2 x i κ s , i where κ s,i and xi are the isentropic compressibility and mole fractions of the pure component i, respectively. The results of isentropic compressibility, κ s, and deviation in isentropic compressibility, Δκ s, for the binary systems {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} at (283.15, 293.15, 303.15 and 313.15)K are presented in Table 3. The isentropic compressibility, κ s, values increases with an increase in temperature at a fixed composition for all binary systems due to an increase in thermal agitation, making the solution more compressible [50]. The κ s value increases with an increase in temperature and decreases with the decrease in the concentration of furfural at a fixed temperature for all binary systems. It is well known that the interactions between the two components in liquid mixtures lead to the decrease in the free-space, thereby contributing to a negative deviation in isentropic compressibility [51–53]. The deviation in isentropic compressibility, Δκ s, over the entire composition range of furfural for all systems is plotted in Fig. 2 ((a)–(c)). It can be seen from Fig. 2((a)–(c)), that the values of Δκ s are negative for all systems indicating that there is a strong unlike dipole–dipole interaction in the mixtures which compensates greater to the positive contribution to Δκ s arising from the mutual rupturing of the dipolar aggregates in furfural and alcohol by each other [54]. It can be seen from Fig. 2((a)–(c)), the Δκ s values increase as the alkyl group of alcohol increases, which is an indication of relatively weaker interactions in the mixtures containing higher alcohols [54]. These concluding remarks are in good agreement with those obtained from the volumetric studies. In general, the Δκ s values decrease with an increase in temperature for all systems at a fixed composition of furfural as shown in Table 1S. The Δκ s values show that the {furfural (x 1)+1-butanol (x 2)} mixture is more compressible than the {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)} mixture which is more compressible than the {furfural (x 1)+ethanol (x 2)} mixture because of the position of the alkyl chain on butanol and smaller alkyl chain on ethanol than butanol. The Δκ s,min values be like this (−157.4, −39.3 and −46.8)×10−12 Pa−1 occurring at x 1 =0.4501, 0.5000 and 0.5000, respectively for each system at all temperatures."
7,Correlation of derived properties,"3.3 Correlation of derived properties Experimental excess/deviation properties of the {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 2-butanol (x 2)} systems are given in Table 1S. These properties such as V m E and Δκ s, were correlated by smoothing the Redlich–Kister equation [55] given below: (8) X = x 1 x 2 ∑ i 2 A i ( 1 − 2 x 1 ) i − 1 where X is excess molar volumes, V m E , and deviation in isentropic compressibility, Δκ s. The values of the fitting parameters Ai have been determined using a least-square method. These results are summarized in Table 5 , together with the corresponding standard deviations, σ, for the correlation as determined using Eq. (9): (9) σ ( X ) = ∑ i = 1 N [ ( X expt − X calc ) 2 N − k ] 1 / 2 where N is the number of experimental points and k is the number of coefficients used in the Redlich–Kister equation. The values of V m E , and Δκ s, as well as the plots of the Redlich–Kister model are displayed in Figs. 1 and 2((a)–(c)), respectively as a mole fraction dependence. The standard deviations, between the experimental data and those calculated using Redlich–Kister equation are also given in Table 5, that show very small values for both excess molar volume and deviation in isentropic compressibility at the investigated temperatures for all the systems."
8,Semi-empirical calculation using HyperChem 7,"3.4 Semi-empirical calculation using HyperChem 7 The semi-empirical calculation with the help of HyperChem 7 has been done to check the interactions between furfural and alcohol through the H-bonding. Using this calculation, we examined that the furfural molecules are engaged in the H-bonding with the alcohol such as ethanol, 1-butanol and 2-butanol which changes the physio-chemical properties of alcohol on interactions with furfural as can be seen in Fig. 3 ((a)–(c)). These theoretical results are very well linked with experimental results obtained in this study, clearly affirming that there is H-bonding interactions between furfural and alcohol."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, new physico-chemical properties, which include density and sound velocity, were measured as a function of temperature and composition, for furfural, alcohols such as ethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and their binary mixtures. The density and sound velocity data decrease linearly with temperatures and increase with the concentration of furfural. Four sound velocity mixing rules were applied and these results agreed favorably, except for the Berryman mixing rule. However, the most satisfactory result was obtained using the mixing rule of Wada for {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)} system. Furthermore, the excess/deviation properties were calculated from density and sound velocity data. The Redlich–Kister polynomial equation was fitted to the excess molar volume and the deviation in isentropic compressibility and provides a good description for all systems. Negative deviations were observed for excess molar volumes for the {furfural (x 1)+ethanol, or 1-butanol (x 2)} systems and both negative and positive values for {furfural (x 1)+2-butanol (x 2)}, whereas negative deviations were obtained for deviations in isentropic compressibility for all systems at all temperatures. The experimental results show H-bonding between furfural and alcohol molecules. These observed interactions are verified by our molecular modelling calculations obtained using HyperChem 7. These results are useful for the interpretation of the nature of intermolecular interactions that exist between these components of interest in mixtures. This work also provides an evaluation of the various sound velocity mixing rules which were used to calculate the sound velocity of the binary mixture from pure component data."
