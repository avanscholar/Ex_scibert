0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been considered one of the most promising clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels due to the depletion of fossil resources and the global warming. Hydrogen production by supercritical water gasification (SCWG), high-pressure gasification conducted above the critical point of water (374°C and 22.1MPa), has many advantages over conventional gasification techniques owing to the unique physical properties of supercritical water (scH2O). ScH2O has extremely low viscosity, high diffusivity, and high solubility of organic reaction intermediates, which promote fast reactions and reduce coke formation. The high energy efficiency (Calzavara et al., 2005; Matsumura, 2002), environmental friendliness, compact gasification equipment (Taylor et al., 2003), high hydrogen gas yield (Susanti et al., 2011), and in situ CO2 separability owing to the high solubility of CO2 in high-pressure water (Guo et al., 2010a) are some of the advantages of SCWG. Furthermore, SCWG can be conducted in the absence of external catalysts, avoiding challenges associated with catalytic gasification reactions such as catalyst deactivation due to the presence of heteroatoms (sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) in some feedstocks, carbon deposition, and reactor plugging issues. Various types of feedstocks can be used to produce hydrogen by SCWG. They include oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol, ethanol, glycerol, etc.), petroleum-based feedstocks (gasoline, diesel, jet-fuel, etc.), and biomass-based feedstocks (lignocellulosic biomass, sewage sludge, microalgae, etc.). SCWG of these feedstocks has been investigated at various conditions (different operation parameters, catalysts, oxidants, etc.) for different reactor systems (batch, plug-flow, fluidized bed, etc.) (Guo et al., 2010b; Peterson et al., 2008). In order to maximize hydrogen gas yield, operation conditions and reactor geometries need to be optimized. Although high feedstock concentration is preferable for high energy efficiency (Nakamura et al., 2008), both equilibrium calculations and experimental results have shown that an increase in feedstock concentration decreases the hydrogen gas yield while increasing the methane yield (Susanti et al., 2011). The SCWG of feedstocks of higher heating values (HHV) (e.g., long-chain hydrocarbons) can also provide high energy efficiency. However, based on the gasification reaction, long-chain hydrocarbons require more severe gasification conditions, e.g., high temperatures, because they are more reform-resistant than their short-chain counterparts. In this study, SCWG of various feedstocks was investigated under similar operating conditions. These feedstocks represent the model compounds of biomass (methanol, ethanol and glucose), byproducts of biodiesel synthesis (glycerol), gasoline (iso-octane and n-octane), jet fuels (n-decane and n-dodecane) and diesel (n-hexadecane). Due to the considerable differences between the physical and chemical properties of the feedstocks, it is important to determine how these differences affect the gasification efficiency and individual gas yield. SCWG of methanol, iso-octane, and n-decane at different temperatures and concentrations was also carried out to examine the effect of both parameters to the gasification behavior of these typical feedstocks. We also demonstrate that each feedstock can be gasified in scH2O with a hydrogen yield similar to its maximum theoretical hydrogen gas yield without added catalysts by using our recently developed reactor system."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Methanol (>99.8%, JT Baker, USA), ethanol (>99.8%, Carlo Erba, France), glycerol (>99%, Junsei Chemical, Japan), D-Glucose (≥99.5%, Sigma Aldrich, USA), iso-octane (>99%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), n-octane (>97%, Yakuri Pure Chemicals, Japan), n-decane (>99.5%, Daejung Chemical, Korea), n-dodecane (>98%, Kanto Chemical, Japan) and n-hexadecane (>99%, Alfa Aesar, UK) were used as received. The distilled and deionized (DDI) water was prepared using a Milli-Q Ultrapure water purification system. After each experiment, 2M H2O2 (>99.5%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) was flowed through the gasification system under the scH2O condition for 2h to remove any solid carbon residue that may have remained inside the reactor."
3,"Apparatus, procedure and characterization","2.2 Apparatus, procedure and characterization The SCWG experiments were carried out using a custom-built, continuous-flow tubular reactor with an updraft configuration. Interested reader may obtain more information on the modification history, apparatus details, reactor temperature control and temperature measurements in previous papers (Susanti et al., 2010, 2011; Laras et al., 2014). A schematic of the apparatus is shown in Fig. S1. The reactor was made of Haynes® 230® alloy with an inside diameter of 20mm and an effective length of 540mm, giving an internal volume of 170cm3. Prior to each gasification experiment, DDI water was introduced to the reactor system using a high-pressure pump and the system was pressurized to 25MPa by adjusting the back-pressure regulator. The temperature of the system was then increased to experimentally desired temperatures using heat furnaces. The reactor was stabilized for at least 1h before feedstock was introduced into the reactor system. The gaseous and liquid effluents were collected three times during the 2h reaction and analyzed. Average values of the three times sampling were reported in this study. The gaseous product was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC), which can quantify all the gaseous products, including H2, CO2, CO, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C3-C5 compounds. The GC was the Clarus 600 GC-Model Arnel 1115PPC Refinery Gas Analyzer (RGA) (Perkin Elmer, USA) with two different detectors, the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the flame ionization detector (FID). The carbon content in the liquid product was analyzed using a total organic compounds analyzer (TOC-VCSH 200V, Shimadzu, Japan). Detailed descriptions of GC and TOC are given in our previous papers (Susanti et al., 2010, 2012). Organic species in the liquid product were analyzed using gas chromatograph/time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (GC/TOF-MS, Pegasus III, Leco Co., USA) equipped with a model 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA), and a Hewlett Packard-5ms column (29m length×0.25mm I.D.×0.25μm thickness). The oven temperature was programmed increase from 50 to 90°C at 20°C/min, held for 2min at 90°C, and increased to a final temperature of 240°C at 15°C/min. Prior to an analysis, 2mL of ethyl acetate was added to 1mL of each liquid product, followed by shaking, centrifuging, and freezing. Details on liquid effluent analysis after glucose gasification are provided in the previous paper (Susanti et al., 2012). In this work, the individual gas yield of every gas produced was defined as the moles of each produced gas per moles of feedstock fed to the reactor. The moles of each produced gas were estimated by real-time volumetric flow rate measurements and the gas compositions were analyzed by the GC. Carbon gasification efficiency (CE) was defined as the total moles of carbon in the produced gases per total moles of carbon in the feed. The CE values of over 100% for several feedstocks were observed, which is possibly due to an error in the estimation of amount of produced gas collected from the gas-liquid separator under the non-equilibrium state and the real-time volumetric flow rate measurements. The potential hydrogen gas ratio was defined as total moles of hydrogen obtainable from relevant gas components divided by the predicted moles of hydrogen from the combined reaction of steam reforming and water gas shifting. Actual hydrogen gas ratio was calculated by comparing the moles of experimentally produced hydrogen with the moles of theoretically predicted hydrogen. The equilibrium hydrogen gas ratio was obtained by comparing the moles of experimentally produced hydrogen with the moles of hydrogen predicted from the equilibrium calculation using the Gibbs free energy minimization method."
4,Equilibrium calculation,"2.3 Equilibrium calculation There are two minimization formulations: stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric (Smith and Missen, 1982). In the stoichiometric formulation, a set of chemical reactions should have been identified. Chemical reaction pathways have to be clearly known. For complicated reactions and less clear mechanisms of reaction pathways in case of SCWG, the nonstoichiometric formulation is more appropriate (Basu and Mettanant, 2009). In this paper, equilibrium calculations were performed using the non-stoichiometric formulation via Gibbs free energy minimization in Aspen Plus© using a RGIBBS module The Peng–Robinson equation of state was employed and the binary interaction parameters were taken from Aspen Plus© database. This approach has been extensively used and verified in a good accordance with experimental data of biomass gasification in supercritical water (Susanti et al., 2011, 2012; Stucki et al., 2009)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Chemical reactions,"3.1 Chemical reactions During the gasification reaction in scH2O, the contribution of H2O is of utmost importance. ScH2O acts as a medium, reactant for H2, source of free radicals, and catalyst due to sufficient ionic concentrations of H3O+ and OH−, especially at high pressures (Ding et al., 1996; Kritzer and Dinjus, 2001; Park and Tomiyasu, 2003). Feedstocks of different chain lengths and chemical bonds undergo different reaction mechanisms in scH2O. Temperature and pressure have an important role in determining reaction pathways, product composition, and gas yields. The ionic reaction mechanism is preferred in the subcritical condition (low temperature region; high density), where the ion product is high enough to allow the existence of free protons and hydroxyl ions that can catalyze ionic reactions and the static relative permittivity of water is high enough to stabilize the ionic species and reaction intermediates. On the other hand, the radical mechanism is preferred in the supercritical condition (high temperature and low pressure region; low density), where ionic chemistry is hindered due to the low relative permittivity of water and the low ion product (Bühler et al., 2002; May et al., 2010). It is reported that liquid products were produced primarily near the critical point, and gaseous products produced above the critical point (Bühler et al., 2002). Some of the feedstocks, especially the thermally labile compounds, decompose during the early stage of feedstock heating. Feedstock decomposition is typically dependent on the heating mechanism and the heating rate. In a continuous SCWG, the feedstock flow can be heated separately or directly mixed with the hot-temperature water flow before the feedstock flow reaches the reactor with the gasification temperature. During the heating period, some of the feedstock (e.g., cellulose) hydrolyze and transform into water soluble compounds at around 150–200°C. Increasing the temperature (200–300°C) would either dehydrate the water soluble compounds into tarry materials (viscous liquids with brownish color) and other higher molecular weight compounds, or break the intermolecular bonding into smaller intermediate species which can further be gasified at higher temperatures (Minowa and Fang, 1998; Onwudili and Williams, 2009; Vogel et al., 2005; Williams and Onwudili, 2005). In the case of methanol, possible candidates of organic intermediates during the early stage of heating are likely to be dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, methyl formate and formic acid (Vogel et al., 2005). In the case of glucose, two parallel reaction pathways seem to exist, which are influenced by the heating rate. It was reported that a fast heating rate is responsible for increases in simple acids and aldehydes that can contribute to the increase of gas yield. In contrast, furfural (tar and char precursor) formation was suppressed and solids production was decreased (Sinag et al., 2004). On the other hand, a slow heating rate seemed to provide extra time for the formation of thermally pyrolyzed organic species and to promote the ionic reaction pathway that leads to a polymerization reaction, producing high-molecular-weight species in the low temperature range. Herein, to direct the reaction to the free radical reaction pathway and to provide a high heating rate, we heated the feedstock at a relatively low temperature (70°C) in a short tubing to reduce its residence time in the feedstock heating stage. In a separate preheating line, water was heated to the desired experimental temperature. The scH2O flow and the feedstock flow were mixed at the mixing zone, so that the feedstock could be heated at a high rate (Fig. S2). During the feedstock heating up period, some of the feedstock would decompose, resulting in several intermediate products that decomposed further to a gaseous product in the scH2O reactor zone. Some of the feedstock may polymerize depending on the operating conditions, resulting in a solid product."
7,Oxygenated hydrocarbons,"3.2 Oxygenated hydrocarbons Oxygenated hydrocarbons such as low-carbon-number alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and biomass model compounds (glycerol, glucose), with a generalized structure of C x H y O z , decompose by bond scission rather than by traditional reformation, in which the feedstock reacts with H2O directly producing H2 and CO (Bouquet, 2012; van Bennekom et al., 2011). The oxygenated hydrocarbons will decompose easily in scH2O due to the presence of oxygen in their chemical structure, which can also increase the decomposition reaction rate. The mean energy bonds of CO (360kJ/mol) and CC (347kJ/mol), which are typically broken during decomposition, are weaker than the CH energy bond (414kJ/mol) and the OH energy bond (464kJ/mol), which are broken in reformation. At the early stage of reaction, the oxygenated feedstocks will decompose into liquid intermediates in scH2O, which will decompose further into gaseous products (mostly to CO through dehydration reaction, H2 through dehydrogenation and CO2 from decarboxylation). The formed CO can participate in the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction to further increase the hydrogen gas yield. Feedstocks also might decompose into a radical form and subsequently undergo the steam reforming reaction as well as the WGS reaction. CH4 can be produced from decomposition reactions and methanation reactions. Tar/char may be formed from several reactions such as dehydration, cyclization, Diels–Alder cyclo addition, and polymerization of the feedstocks and reaction intermediates (Chuntanapum and Matsumura, 2010; Williams and Onwudili, 2005). The following reactions can take place in the decomposition of oxygenated hydrocarbons. Decomposition reaction (1) C x H y O z →CO+H2 +CH4 +CO2 +others A water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction can occur due to the large amounts of water under typical SCWG conditions. (2) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 ΔH 298K =−41.15kJ/mol The methanation of carbon monoxide is given as follows: (3) CO+3H2 ↔CH4 +H2OΔH 298K =−206.17kJ/mol The methanation of carbon dioxide is (4) CO2 +4H2 ↔CH4 +2H2OΔH 298K =−165.01kJ/mol The overall reaction will be (5) C x H y O z +(2x − z)H2O→ xCO2 +(0.5y +2x − z)H2 3.2.1 Methanol and ethanol gasification Methanol represents the simplest model compound of biomass, since it is built from C, H and O atoms which are the main constituents of biomass. It can be produced from a variety of sources including natural gas, coal, and biomass (wood waste, agriculture residue, and garbage). The theoretical maximum hydrogen gas yield using methanol as the feedstock is 3mol H2/mol methanol. The absence of a carbon–carbon bond in methanol enables the gasification reactions at relatively lower temperatures than those of longer-chain feedstocks (Gadhe and Gupta, 2007). Methanol in scH2O decomposes instead of reforming (Bouquet, 2012). Hot-temperature water can decompose methanol to produce formaldehyde at relatively low temperatures above 300°C. Formaldehyde dimerizes into methyl formate, and then subsequently reacts with water to produce formic acid. Formic acid then decomposes into CO2 and H2 (Vogel et al., 2005) or decomposes directly into CO and H2 (Chakinala et al., 2013), depending on the reaction temperature. It has been reported that formaldehyde and formic acid decompose rapidly in hydrothermal conditions (Watanabe et al., 2004; Yu and Savage, 1998; Zhang et al., 2009). In fact, trace amounts of formic acid, formaldehyde (Boukis et al., 2003; Chakinala et al., 2013; van Bennekom et al., 2011; Vogel et al., 2005) and acetic acid (Boukis et al., 2003) were detected in the liquid product resulting from the gasification of methanol in scH2O. Meanwhile, the non-catalyzed decomposition of methanol in scH2O is very slow; so, in order to enhance the decomposition, temperatures above 700°C are applied (Ullmann, 2000). Without added catalysts and at temperatures below 600°C, methanol is stable with conversion rate of up to 12% at 500°C at 120min, not greater than 25% at 550°C (DiLeo and Savage, 2006) and about 2.1% at 544°C and 6.6s residence time in the Inconel 625 reactor (Tester et al., 1993). The proposed mechanism pathway of methanol decomposition in scH2O can be found in the literatures (Chakinala et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2003; van Bennekom et al., 2011). Herein, SCWG of methanol was performed at high temperatures of 650–750°C, where the decomposition reaction would be accelerated. As listed in Table 1 , at 740°C and 10wt%, the CE value was found to be very high (110%), indicating complete conversion of methanol to gaseous products. The TOC value obtained from three samplings during 2h was very low (71.0ppm by average) and the chromatogram obtained from GC/TOF-MS (Fig. S3a) also revealed no organic species in the liquid effluent. A decrease in gasification temperature to 650°C led to the decrease in CE value to 99% at 10wt%, as listed in Table 2 . An almost five-time increase in TOC values from 71.0 to 311.3ppm was observed, while no peaks detected in GC/TOF-MS. The liquid effluent was clear and no oily product observed (Fig. S3b). TOC can analyze mainly water soluble products and GC/TOF-MS can analyze only the organic fractions that are soluble in ethyl acetate. The absence of organic water soluble products in the chromatogram may imply the complete gasification of the liquid intermediates at temperatures of 650–740°C. It has been proven that organic acids produced from methanol decompostion (e.g., formic acid) quickly decompose into gaseous product in near-supercritical and supercritical water (Vogel et al., 2005; Yu and Savage, 1998). When the methanol concentration increased to 20wt% at 740°C, the CE value slightly dropped to 108%, followed by an increase in TOC in the liquid effluent (177.8ppm), as listed in Table 3 . Small amounts of oily products appeared to be stuck on the wall of the vial. The organic fraction soluble in ethyl acetate was identified as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which were composed of naphthalene and benzene (Fig. S3c). These compounds may not have come directly from methanol, but maybe have come from the subsequent reactions of the products of incompletely decomposed methanol due to the high feed concentration. Kruse et al. (2009) highlighted the importance of the subsequent reactions between liquid intermediates, which can lead to the formation of PAHs from molecular compounds with carbon number less than six. Formation of aromatic compounds during SCWG of alcohols can be also found elsewhere; for example, the formation of benzene and toluene from the gasification of 1-propanol (C3) to 1-octanol (C8) at 600°C (Chakinala et al., 2013) and the formation of toluene, different types of alkyl-benzene and indane from the gasification of 1-butanol at 500°C (Kruse et al., 2009) were reported. Ethanol is an attractive feedstock as a source of hydrogen for several reasons such as relatively high hydrogen content (H:C=3:1), non-toxicity and biodegradability, easy storage and transport, and production availability from renewable biomass sources such as corn, lignocellulosic biomass, and energy crops by fermentation (Haryanto et al., 2005; Navarro et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2007). Ethanol can be regarded as a simple model compound of biomass since it contains both CC and CO bonds (Rabe et al., 2010). The theoretical maximum hydrogen gas yield using ethanol as the feedstock is 6mol H2/mol ethanol. The ethanol decomposition pathway in scH2O has been discussed in several literatures (Chakinala et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2007; Therdthianwong et al., 2011). The decomposition and dehydration of ethanol through CO, CH and OH bond scission produce reaction intermediates such as acetaldehyde, acetylene and formaldehyde. These intermediates may be decomposed further or steam reformed into gaseous products. Herein, at the high temperature of 740°C, a high CE of 98.0% and a high hydrogen gas yield of 3.84mol/mol ethanol were obtained, as listed in Table 1. The liquid effluent was clear, and the TOC value was very low (21.0ppm). The GC/TOF-MS also did not detect any organic species in the liquid effluent (Fig.S4a). 3.2.2 Glycerol and glucose gasification The global increase in the production of biodiesel from natural triglycerides has led to the generation of enormous amounts of the byproduct “bio-glycerol”. Crude glycerol produced from biodiesel plants is considered as a potential source of hydrogen due to its availability and catalytic content (alkali), which can be utilized as a homogenous catalyst in SCWG. Glycerol undergoes the decomposition reaction mechanism instead of the traditional reformation mechanism (Bouquet, 2012; van Bennekom et al., 2011). The decomposition mechanism of glycerol is discussed elsewhere (Bühler et al., 2002; Bouquet, 2012; May et al., 2010; van Bennekom et al., 2011). The noncatalytic decomposition of glycerol in scH2O occurs through complex reaction mechanisms: ionic reaction and radical reaction pathways. Dominant reaction pathway is dependent on temperature and water density/pressure (Bühler et al., 2002). The radical mechanism is preferred at high temperature and low water density, where ionic chemistry is not favored due to the low relative permittivity of the medium and low water ion product. Through the radical mechanism, typical intermediates such as methanol and allyl alcohol are produced (Bühler et al., 2002; May et al., 2010). Acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and acrolein are produced by both ionic and radical mechanisms (Bühler et al., 2002). Acetaldehyde decomposes into CO and CH4 as major products and H2 and C2H6 as minor products, while formaldehyde decomposes into CO and H2. Acrolein decomposes into CO and C2H4. On the other hand, the steam reforming pathway also has been suggested by several researchers as the main pathway of glycerol reformation (Byrd et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2012). Steam reforming is favorable at high water content (Guo et al., 2012). Herein, SCWG of glycerol exhibited extremely low TOC value around 21ppm at 740°C and 10wt% (Table 1). The chromatogram of GC/TOF-MS revealed no ethyl acetate-soluble organics in the liquid effluent (Fig. S4b). This result indicated that under this condition, all liquid intermediates were converted into gases, as supported by the high CE value that reaches 100%. Thus, it is not clear which pathway is dominant in the gas formation by the decomposition of glycerol to liquid intermediates, which would subsequently be converted into gases, or by the direct reformation of glycerol into gaseous products, because no liquid product was detected. SCWG of glucose, as a model compound of biomass, has been extensively studied (Byrd et al., 2007; Goodwin and Rorrer, 2008; Hao et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2002; Susanti et al., 2012; Williams and Onwudili, 2005; Yu et al., 1993). Depending on the reaction temperature, the decomposition pathway of glucose in scH2O has been widely discussed in literature (Kabyemela et al., 1999; Sinag et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 2005). Glucose is easily decomposed in scH2O even at low temperatures of 300–375°C (near scH2O condition), producing liquid products (Amin et al., 1975; Malaluan, 1995). Glucose decomposition requires more than 60s at 400°C, but at a slightly high temperature of 460°C, only 0.5s is required (Promdej and Matsumura, 2011). If the operating condition favors the ionic reaction mechanism (<374°C), the decomposition will be preferable for furfural and phenol formation. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and furfural were found to be typical intermediates in the decomposition of glucose which decomposed further to gas and/or solid products (Promdej and Matsumura, 2011). The formation of char can be retarded by increasing the temperature because char is the result of the ionic pathway. 5-HMF dehydrated into levulinic acid and formic acid (Sinag et al., 2003). Levulinic acid is a typical product of the ionic pathway with acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 5-HMF (Kuster and Temmink, 1977). At high reaction temperatures (>374°C), the decomposition of glucose prefers the radical pathway, promoting gas formation. Typical reaction intermediates of the gas formation are acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propanoic acid, propenoic acid, etc.), 5-HMF and furfural. A high temperature will decrease the formation of furfural/phenol and char, which are typically formed by the ionic reaction mechanism. At very high temperatures (>700°C), most intermediate will transform into gaseous products and thermally stable liquid products such as acetic acid (Goodwin and Rorrer, 2008; Susanti et al., 2012), phenol (Goodwin and Rorrer, 2008) and 2-hydroxyethyl acetate (Susanti et al., 2012). Acetic acid content will decrease with an addition of a catalyst and increase with a fast heating rate (Sinag et al., 2004). Fast heating rates promote the mechanism toward the free radical reaction, while low heating rates promote the formation of more phenol, furfural and solid products. High heating rates also promote CO formation (Watanabe et al., 2005). It was also observed that at a high temperature and low concentration condition (740°C, 10wt%), intermediates such as acetic acid and 2-hydroxyethylacetate were still present in the liquid effluents (Susanti et al., 2012)."
8,Long-chain alkanes gasification,"3.3 Long-chain alkanes gasification In the reforming of hydrocarbons, the breaking bonds are OH, CC and CH bonds. A typical breaking bond in reforming is OH, which has the highest mean bond energy among the other bonds. This is the reason why reforming requires a high reaction temperature. In addition, reforming also needs high water/steam content, making it favorable among the other reactions. If hydrogen comes only from hydrocarbons, then the hydrogen gas yield will be small, but some of hydrogen is thought to come from water through the WGS reaction (Kruse, 2008) during the SCWG. Then high energy (or high reaction temperature) is needed to break the covalent bond of H2O. Various competing reactions can occur during SCWG of long-chain hydrocarbons, producing gaseous products and/or char products (Boukis et al., 2003; Resende et al., 2008; Susanti et al., 2011). These include steam reforming, water-gas-shift (WGS), methanation, pyrolysis and other reactions that are responsible for carbon formation. The steam reforming reaction can be expressed as Eq. (6), where x and y depend on the type of feedstock. The WGS reaction (Eq. (2)) can occur subsequently. (6) C x H y + xH2O↔ xCO+(x +0.5y)H2 If all the feedstocks are steam reformed and all the CO produced by steam reforming is consumed to produce hydrogen, the maximum theoretical hydrogen gas yields can be obtained. The combined reaction between steam reforming and WGS reactions is (7) C x H y +2xH2O↔ xCO2 +(2x +0.5y)H2 Other competing reactions such as pyrolysis, methanation, boudouard, and hydrogenation can also occur during SCWG. Pyrolysis (cracking) reaction is responsible for the formation of hydrocarbon gases and carbon (Picou et al., 2009). (8) C x H y →H2 +C+C x H y +others Methane can be produced from the pyrolysis reaction (Eq. (8)), or reactions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide with hydrogen. The methanation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were given previously in Eqs. (3) and (4). The reactions that are responsible for carbon formation are pyrolysis reaction and Boudouard reaction. The Boudouard reaction is (9) 2CO↔C+CO2 H 298K =−172.45kJ/mol Of the reactions above, the combined steam reforming and WGS reactions are highly desired for high hydrogen gas yield, whereas methanation or the pyrolysis reaction decreases the hydrogen gas yield. Thus reaction conditions and reactor geometry should be optimized to enhance stream reforming and WGS reactions, and thus, to enhance the hydrogen gas yield."
9,Comparison of various feedstocks,"3.4 Comparison of various feedstocks SCWG of various feedstocks from the simplest alcohol of one carbon number with a high hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio to long-chain alkanes with sixteen carbon numbers are compared under similar operating conditions (740°C, 25MPa, 10wt%). Table 1 lists the individual gas yields, equilibrium maximum hydrogen gas yields, CE and TOC values obtained from SCWG of the various feedstocks. Very high CE values of >90% were obtained from all the feedstocks. The typical oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol, ethanol, glycerol and glucose) were easily gasified into gaseous products with negligible amount of liquid product. Complete gasification of glycerol occurred above 700°C in a capillary quartz reactor (Kersten et al., 2006). Ring structure like d-glucose is likely to produce coke at higher temperatures (Yu et al., 1993), which may be responsible for the slightly low carbon conversion value (91.3%). Typically, longer-chain hydrocarbons are known to be more reform-resistant in scH2O. The experimental results show that our gasification system can achieve high CE values (>96%) even from the long-chain alkane (C16), indicating the excellent conversion of the feedstocks to gaseous products. The liquid effluents were mostly clear and transparent, and the TOC values were very low ranging 21.0–71.0ppm for methanol, ethanol, glycerol, and glucose (Figs. S3 and S4). Hydrocarbons such as iso-octane and n-decane were almost completely gasified and their liquid effluents were virtually clear (Figs. S5a and S6a). Azulene and naphthalene were the only chemical species detected in the liquid effluents. In the case of the long-chain hydrocarbons (n-dodecane and n-hexadecane), the TOC values of the liquid effluents significantly increased (409.0 and 380.5ppm for n-dodecane and n-hexadecane, respectively). Tarry materials and phenol and PAHs such as azulene, 9h-fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene were observed in the liquid effluents, as shown in Fig. S7. PAHs, consisting of multiple ring compounds, were very difficult to reform, even under a high temperature condition. Benzene derivatives and PAHs are classified as tertiary tar products and high temperatures (above 650°C) promote their formation from primary tar (Basu, 2010). Primary tar contains products resulting from the direct breakdown of feedstock during the primary pyrolysis, such as oxygenated and condensable molecules (Basu, 2010). In addition to the aromatic compounds, butanoic acid was also observed in the chromatograms (Fig. S7). When methanol and ethanol were used as the feedstocks, the experimental hydrogen gas yields were higher than the equilibrium maximum hydrogen yields (125 and 128%, respectively, Table 1). In addition, the yields of C2+ gases were negligible, which meant that the gas composition was dominated by only permanent gases. The ratio between the experimental and equilibrium maximum hydrogen yields was low for glycerol and glucose cases (96 and 81%, respectively). When the hydrocarbons with C8–C16 were used, the ratios were 96–116%, indicating that the experimentally produced hydrogen gas yields were comparable to those of the equilibrium maximum hydrogen yields. Besides the wall catalysis effect, the H2O2 treatment during the off-session cleaning may have contributed to the constant high hydrogen yield (Antal et al., 2000; Boukis et al., 2003). The comparison of the dry gas compositions in Fig. 1 shows the production of hydrogen-rich gases from all the feedstocks tested in this study. Hydrogen comprised more than 50% of the gas mixture. The highest percentage of H2 in the gas mixture (69.4mol%) was observed when methanol was used as the feedstock. The CO2 content was much lower (∼25mol%) than the H2 content but was rather high in the glucose case (35.4mol%). Note that the CO content was very low in all the cases, indicating a possible enhancement of the WGS reaction at the given experimental condition. Aliphatic hydrocarbons (>C10) and iso-octane gave much higher methane and C2+ yields than the other feedstocks, which may suggest that pyrolysis reaction or methanation reaction is preferable. When taking into account the high yield of H2 achieved, pyrolysis is more likely dominant. In the aliphatic hydrocarbon cases (C8–C16), a similar trend in gas composition was observed; hydrogen comprised the highest proportion (52–59mol%), followed by CO2 (22–25mol%), hydrocarbon gases (16–23mol%), and the remaining CO (1–2mol%), suggesting that gas composition is not strongly dependent on the carbon number of the feedstock in the current SCWG system."
10,Effects of reaction temperature,"3.5 Effects of reaction temperature The effect of temperature on the gasification of three different feedstocks (methanol, iso-octane, and n-decane) are shown in Table 2. The feedstocks were gasified at two different temperatures (650 and 740°C) at 25MPa, 10wt% and a residence time of 60s. Methanol was almost completely gasified at the low temperature of 650°C; the CE value was 99% and the TOC value was low (311.3ppm). Indeed, no aromatic species were observed in the liquid effluents at both temperatures, as shown in Fig. S3b. This result indicates that at the low concentration of 10wt%, temperatures higher than 650°C do not promote the formation of PAHs. The hydrogen gas yield slightly increased from 2.31 to 2.50mol/mol methanol with an increase in temperature from 650 to 740°C. These hydrogen gas yields were much higher than those estimated from the equilibrium calculations. In contrast, when iso-octane and n-decane were used, relatively lower CE values of 78–80% resulted at 650°C while at 740°C almost complete gasification was achieved. The hydrogen gas yield increased significantly from 2.50 to 8.77mol/mol and 3.47 to 12.03mol/mol for iso-octane and n-decane, respectively, when the temperature increased from 650 to 740°C. The experimentally obtained hydrogen gas yields of iso-octane and n-decane at 650°C were much lower, while those at 740°C were very close to the predicted values obtained from the equilibrium calculations. Thus, the hydrocarbon chains were more resistant to gasification at the low gasification temperature. As shown in Figs. S5 and S6, the liquid effluents exhibited much more complicated aromatic species at the low temperature of 650°C. The SCWG of iso-octane and n-decane, whose CE values were low, also resulted in various benzene derivatives and PAHs peaks in the GC/TOF-MS chromatograph. These products could not be easily gasified and were relatively stable under the current operating condition. Thus, when dealing with long-chain hydrocarbons, reaction temperature was one of major reasons for the formation of the aromatic species and higher reaction temperatures can split the reaction pathway to yield more gasifiable intermediates. As shown in Fig. 2 , potential, actual, and equilibrium hydrogen gas ratios increased with increasing temperature; the potential and the equilibrium hydrogen ratios reached ∼100% at 740°C but were low, 42–60%, at 650°C for iso-octane and n-decane. In contrast, when methanol was gasified, the potential hydrogen gas ratio reached ∼1 at the low temperature of 650°C and the equilibrium hydrogen gas ratio decreased significantly from 1.93 to 1.28 with an increase in temperature from 650 to 740°C. This is due to the much higher experimental hydrogen gas yield than the predicted value at 650°C, as listed in Table 2. The reason for the higher hydrogen gas yield than that of the predicted values by the equilibrium calculation when methanol was gasified is not clear. Similar results were observed by other groups in which the experimental hydrogen yields were higher than the predicted values by equilibrium calculation when methanol was used as the feedstock (Boukis et al., 2003, 2006; Gadhe and Gupta, 2005; Xu et al., 1996). In addition, the actual hydrogen gas ratio from methanol was similar at both temperature conditions while those from iso-octane and n-decane increased significantly at the high temperature. Thus, reaction temperature has a critical effect on hydrogen yields when long-chain hydrocarbons are gasified in scH2O."
11,Effects of concentration,"3.6 Effects of concentration Table 3 lists the effect of feedstock concentration on the individual gaseous yields, CE and TOC values at a 25MPa, 740°C and 60s. At the high concentration of 20wt%, the average CE values are still high ranging 97–110%, indicating the current gasification system can provide almost complete conversion even at high feedstock concentrations up to 20wt%. When 20wt% methanol was used, the hydrogen gas yield exceeded to the equilibrium values and the gaseous product (CE>100%) was completely converted. In the iso-octane case, even though 97% of the carbon converted into a gaseous product at 20wt%, the TOC values of the liquid effluents from 1h and 2h gasification increased significantly from 157.8 to 670ppm, highly indicates the presence of carbon accumulation inside the system. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5Sc, the content of ethyl acetate-extractable compounds increased significantly. A third liquid effluent sampling could not be conducted because the effluent almost fully consisted of tarry materials. The experiment had to be stopped in order to prevent blockage of the reactor system due to carbon blockage. The hydrogen yield from iso-octane dropped sharply from 8.77 to 3.48mol/mol when the concentration was increased from 10 to 20wt%. The methane yield increased by 15% but the CO and CO2 yields decreased, indicating the preference for methanation under the high concentration condition. The experimental hydrogen yield was 79% of the equilibrium prediction at 20wt%, and the TOC value increased significantly from 56.2ppm to an average value of 429.0ppm with the increase in concentration from 10 to 20wt%. The SCWG of n-decane showed a similar trend to that of iso-octane. Hydrogen gas yield decreased from 12.03 to 7.91mol/mol, methane yield increased from 4.14 to 5.01mol/mol and CO2 yield decreased from 4.91 to 4.06mol/mol when the concentration increased from 10 to 20wt%. The appearance of liquid effluents from n-decane also changed significantly from virtually transparent at first 1h running (TOC of 90.2ppm) to dark brown at 2h running (TOC of 638.3ppm) due to the increase in tarry products accumulation (Fig. S6c). Aromatic compounds such as PAHs and phenol were detected in the liquid effluents. Even in the SCWG of methanol at the high feed concentration of 20wt%, the formation of aromatic compounds was observed (Fig. S3a). The high feedstock concentration may enhance the polymerization of reaction intermediates, which leads to the formation of tarry materials. Similar trend was observed in the SCWG of biomass in which polymerization (higher reaction order) of liquid intermediates, rather than degradation of liquid intermediates into gaseous products (lower reaction order), was more favorable at the high feed concentration (Kruse and Faquir, 2007). The exact reaction pathway of aromatic compound formation from long-chain hydrocarbons is not known, but it was reported that SCWG of phenol led to the formation of some aromatic compounds such as benzene, dibenzofuran, and PAHs (e.g., toluene, naphthalene, fluorene, biphenyls, etc.) via radical formation (phenoxy radical). Dibenzofuran may be unstable under the scH2O condition and may be further polymerized to form PAHs (Huelsman and Savage, 2012). As shown in Fig. 3 , an increase in feedstock concentration from 10 to 20wt% has a marginal effect on the potential hydrogen gas ratio, even decreasing the actual hydrogen gas ratio. The equilibrium hydrogen gas ratio obtained from methanol and n-decane gasification were higher, while that from iso-octane gasification was lower at the high concentration of 20wt%. Based on the results of concentration effect, n-decane with the longer carbon chain seemed to gasify easier than iso-octane. This may suggest that n-decane with a linear hydrocarbon structure may be reformed more easily than the branched hydrocarbon with a smaller carbon number. Currently, an in-depth gasification investigation on both feedstocks at various conditions is being carried out to address the different SCWG behaviors between the linear and branched hydrocarbons."
12,Conclusions,"SCWG of various types of feedstocks was investigated at temperatures of 650–740°C, concentrations of 10–20wt%, 25MPa and 60s. The feedstocks included methanol, ethanol, glycerol, glucose, n-octane, iso-octane, n-decane, n-dodecane, and n-hexadecane. At 740°C, 25MPa, 10wt% and 60s, almost complete conversion of each feedstock to a gaseous product was achieved and the experimentally determined hydrogen gas yields were very close to the predicted values at equilibrium, regardless of the dominant pathway, either decomposition or reformation. At this condition, the hydrogen content comprised more than 50% of the gaseous mixture, and the aliphatic hydrocarbons resulted in similar gas composition. The gasification at the low temperature of 650°C showed that iso-octane and n-decane conversions to gaseous products were decreased to 80%, while methanol conversion to a gaseous product was maintained at 100%. When the gasification results of n-decane and iso-octane at 650°C and 20wt% were compared, n-decane with the higher carbon number but a linear chain seemed to have been gasified more easily than iso-octane with the shorter carbon number but a branch structure."
