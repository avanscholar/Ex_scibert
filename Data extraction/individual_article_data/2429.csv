0,Introduction,"Polyurethane (PU) belongs to a diversified class of polymers, accounting for nearly 6% of the global polymer market (Atiqah et al., 2016; Gostev et al., 2018). Among them, polyurethane elastomers have been widely used in tires, seals, biomaterials, soft robots, wearable electronic devices and sensors due to their low modulus, good extensibility, ease of dyeing, resistance to general chemical solvents and good resilience (Ciobanu et al., 2004; Song et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019a, 2019b; Yu et al., 2019). However, most of the raw materials used to prepare polyurethane elastomers are currently derived from petroleum and its derivatives, while petroleum and coal resources are nonrenewable. With the decrease in petrochemical resources and the enhancement of people's awareness of environmental protection, the use of renewable resources to replace petroleum and other nonrenewable resources to prepare materials has become the focus of attention (Tanaka et al., 2008; Staples et al., 2017). Biomass is the most abundant renewable resource on earth. Due to a wide range of renewable and biodegradable sources, biomass has become the best alternative to petroleum-based materials. Lignin is the second-largest biomass resource in the plant world after cellulose, and it is also the only natural polymer with an aromatic structure in plant resources. Therefore, it is considered one of the most abundant green chemical resources at present (Chio et al., 2019; Rajesh Banu et al., 2019; Yoo et al., 2020). Generally, lignin is derived from plants such as wood and crop straws. Traditional lignin products are mainly separated from the “black liquor” produced in papermaking (Xiong et al., 2015). In recent years, the use of crop straw enzymatic hydrolysis technology to produce bioethanol has developed rapidly. The byproduct lignin obtained via this process has higher reactivity than other sources of lignin, which will facilitate the application and industrial production of lignin in polymer materials. In the molecular structure of lignin, in addition to the aromatic ring, there are active groups such as phenolic hydroxyl, alcoholic hydroxyl and carbon double bonds, which can undergo oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, alcoholysis, acidolysis, demethoxylation, carboxylation, photolysis, acylation, sulfonation and other chemical reactions (Li et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2018; Usman Khan and Kiaer Ahring, 2020; Wei et al., 2020). This provides an opportunity to integrate lignin into polyurethane products, and lays the foundation for the high-value utilization of lignin from crop straws. Active groups such as phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyl groups in the lignin structure can partially or completely replace the hydroxyl groups in reactive polyols and participate in the synthesis of lignin-containing polyurethane materials (Cao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019b). By reacting with isocyanates, lignin can also be added to polyurethane materials as active fillers (Datta et al., 2017; Barana et al., 2019; Wadekar et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2020). In addition to the introduction of lignin to increase the biobased content of polyurethane products, in some cases, its various products have shown performance advantages, including enhanced crosslinking density, improved biodegradability, increased ultraviolet (UV) stability, oxidation resistance, improved mechanical strength and thermal stability (Alinejad et al., 2019). However, materials are often affected by the external environment and additional stress during the application process, which will lead to cracking or macroscopic fracture and ultimately failure. At the same time, due to the cross-linked structures in the materials, it is difficult to repeatedly process and recycle pulverized waste, resulting in a series of environmental problems and waste of resources. Inspired by the ability of organisms to repair certain injured tissues to maintain their own life and health, self-healing materials with the ability to repair their own damage have been produced. Self-healing materials have the advantages of further improving safety and reliability, prolonging service life and reducing waste of resources, which have attracted increasing attention from researchers (Kang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2019). According to different triggers, self-healing materials can be divided into extrinsic self-healing materials and intrinsic self-healing materials (Li and Zuo, 2020). Extrinsic self-healing materials mainly use microcapsules, hollow fibers and mesoporous hollow microsphere technology to achieve self-healing performance, while intrinsic self-healing materials are functional materials that rely on chemical bonds or nonchemical bond interactions between molecules in polymers to achieve self-healing properties (Lai et al., 2019). The healing ability of intrinsic self-healing polymers mainly depends on the reversible chemical bonds (such as disulfide bonds, Diels-Alder bonds, coordination covalent bonds, etc.) in the polymer backbone structure, so it has the advantage of repeated healing and does not require the use of external repair agents. Therefore, compared with extrinsic self-healing materials, intrinsic self-healing materials have broad application prospects. At present, some studies on lignin-containing polymer elastomers with self-healing properties have been reported. Liu et al. used the carboxyl groups in the lignin structure to replace part of those in dicarboxylic acids to react with amine groups to prepare a lignin-based supramolecular elastomer that relies on the hydrogen bonds among the urea groups in the molecular chain. The elastomer showed a tensile strength of 1.12 MPa and achieved full recovery after a healing time of 48 h (Liu et al., 2018). In addition, the hydroxyl groups in the lignin can also participate in the reaction with isocyanate groups, thereby grafting furan or maleimide groups on the lignin molecular chain to achieve the Diels-Alder reaction (Zhou et al., 2018). On this basis, a lignin-based self-healing material containing DA bonds was prepared, which can heal spontaneously at 130 °C (Buono et al., 2017). Lignin has a rigid core and a large specific surface area, which can be dispersed under certain conditions and has potential application value as a rubber reinforcing agent (Tu et al., 2021). The introduction of lignin as a filler can not only improve the mechanical properties of a polymer elastomer but can also exist as a ligand for dynamic Zn-based coordination sacrificial bonds, providing the self-healing ability for the polymer elastomer (Wang et al., 2018). Compared with other healing methods, dynamic disulfide bonds (SS bonds) have the advantages of milder healing conditions, higher self-healing efficiency and simpler preparation processes (Ye et al., 2021; Pepels et al., 2013; Fernandes and Ramos, 2004). They have been widely used in self-healing polymer materials (Talebian et al., 2019). The existence of disulfide bonds not only gives the polymer material an excellent self-healing ability, but also increases the chemical cross-linking effect to improve the mechanical properties (Wang et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2018; Yarmohammadi and Shahidzadeh, 2018). However, the reversible dissociation and recombination of hydrogen and disulfide bonds, and the resultant polymer chain mobility enable effective self-healing without any stimulation, thereby resulting in mechanically weak and soft solids in most cases. These self-healing materials generally exhibit low tensile strength and toughness and poor creep resistance or resilience. Therefore, the development of polyurethane elastomers with good mechanical strength and healing properties based on molecular design has become the focus of our research. In a previous study, we tested the feasibility of incorporating lignin from crop straws into polyurethane elastomers (Sun et al., 2021). As a further attempt, the research purpose of this article was to optimize the comprehensive properties of lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers and endow them with excellent self-healing ability. Inspired by the high strength, stretchability, toughness and self-healing ability of the mussel byssus cuticle, this study designed a polyurethane elastomer by imitating its molecular structure. The extensible, self-healing and adhesive properties of the byssal threads were attributed to the internal structure of the catechol-metal complexes and disulfide linkages (Ye et al., 2021). Therefore, we tried to introduce lignin and disulfide into polyurethane to form a structure similar to catechol-metal complexes and disulfide linkages. Herein, lignin-containing polyester polyols were synthesized from decanedioic acid, neopentyl glycol (NPG), ethylene glycol (EG), bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and corn stover lignin by vacuum melting. Then, they were combined with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and a chain extender (EG/lignin/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide) to form lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers by the casting method. In addition to participating in the synthesis reaction, the unesterified hydroxyls of lignin can also interact with the carbamate and hydroxyl groups from the polyurethane molecular chain to form hydrogen bonds similar to the structure of catechol-metal complexes. The effect of the role of lignin as a reaction raw material and chain extender, as well as the order of introduction of disulfide bonds on the properties of polyurethane elastomers were systematically explored. The self-healing mechanism for dynamic hydrogen and disulfide bonds in lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers was also further elaborated. The use of lignin to partially replace petrochemical raw materials can further alleviate the resource and energy crisis, improve the utilization efficiency of biomass materials and expand the application fields for lignin, which is of great significance for the full utilization of renewable resources. This research provides a new type of high-value application for lignin derived from crop straws, which is expected to be applied to the industrial production of polymer elastomers."

Toluene diisocyanate (TDI, AR) was purchased from Wanhua Chemical Group Co. Ltd. of China."
3,Methods and procedures,"2.2 Methods and procedures 2.2.1 Preparation of the lignin-containing polyester polyols As shown in Scheme 1, lignin-containing polyester polyols were synthesized according to the esterification reaction. The samples were named LPES and S-LPES, with “S” standing for disulfide bonds in polyester polyol, “L” for lignin, and “PES” for polyester polyol. Among them, lignin replaced part of EG to participate in the reaction to prepare the polyester polyols. The synthesis process for S-LPES is described as follows: Decanedioic acid, NPG, EG, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin were added into a four-necked flask and heated to 150 °C for 1 h under mechanical stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere to melt all solids and mix all the raw materials uniformly. Then, the mixture was heated to 160 °C for 3 h and 220 °C for 3 h. Next, the system was placed under vacuum at −0.046 MPa for 0.5 h and −0.074 MPa for 0.7 h at 220 °C. Water and small molecule impurities formed during the reaction were continuously removed with a nitrogen stream. After cooling to 100 °C, the catalyst MSA and DBTL were added into the flask, and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 h. Additionally, LPES was synthesized by the same vacuum melting method using decanedioic acid, NPG, EG and lignin as the raw materials. The preparation process for S-LPES is shown in Fig. 1. The feeding amount was calculated according to Eq. (1) below, and the raw material ratios are shown in Table 1. The related calculation equation is expressed as follows: (1) M n = n M COOH + ( n + 1 ) M OH − 2 n M H 2 O here, M ¯ n is the molecular weight of polyester, and its value was set to 2000; M COOH is the molecular weight of dibasic acid (decanedioic acid); M OH is the molecular weight of glycol (NPG, EG, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin). The molar mass ratio of NPG to EG in LPES is 3:1, and the molar mass ratio of NPG, EG and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide in S-LPES is 6:2:1. Lignin replaced 50% of the quality of EG; M H2O is the molecular weight of H2O; n is the amount of dibasic acid (mol). 2.2.2 Preparation of polyurethane elastomers As shown in Scheme 2, lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers with a hard segment content of 37.50% were prepared by using the same casting method. The samples were named LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L, LPUE-S and S-LPUE, with “S-” standing for disulfide bonds in polyester polyol, “-L” for lignin in the hard segment, “-S” for disulfide bonds in the hard segment, and “LPUE” for the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomer. Since both bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin contain hydroxyl groups, they can replace part of EG as chain extenders to prepare lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. Using LPUE-LS as an example, LPES, TDI and chain extenders (EG/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide/lignin) were mechanically stirred evenly in a beaker. Then, the mixture was poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene mold and dried at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum to ensure that the reaction proceeded fully. The feeding amount was calculated according to Eq. (2), and the raw material ratios are shown in Table 2. The related calculation equation is expressed as follows: (2) C h = W i + W d W i + W d + W g = 100 × M i M g + 1 + M i M d w d 100 × 1 + M i M g + 1 + M i M d W d here, C h is the hard segment content of polyurethane elastomer (the hard segment content for this experiment was 37.5%); W i is the quality of isocyanate (TDI); W d is the quality of the chain extender glycol (EG, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin); W g is the quality of polyester polyol; M i is the molecular weight of isocyanate; M d is the molecular weight of the chain extender glycol; M g is the molecular weight of polyester polyol. The mass ratio of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide to EG/lignin in the chain extender was 3:1. Lignin replaced 37.82% (wt%) of EG as a chain extender. The NCO index ( Table 2 ) is an important indicator of polyurethane, which is calculated from the following equation ( Zhang et al., 2019a, 2019b ): (3) NCO index = W TDI × NC O TDI W PES × O H PES + W C h a i n e x t e n d e r × O H Chain extender Where W TDI, W PES, and W Chain extender are the weight (g) of TDI, polyester polyol and chain extender, respectively; NCO TDI was NCO groups content of TDI; OH PES and OH Chain extender were the OH groups content of polyester polyol and chain extender, respectively. 2.2.3 Characterizations 2.2.3.1 Hydroxyl value tests for the lignin-containing polyester polyols The hydroxyl value is an important indicator of polyester polyol, and it has a great influence on controlling the mass ratio of isocyanate to polyester polyol (NCO/OH), the content of soft and hard segments and the stability of the polyurethane elastomer during the reaction. The hydroxyl values for the lignin-containing polyester polyols were tested according to the method of acetic anhydride-pyridine acylation (Liu, 2012). 2.2.3.2 Swelling tests for the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers The swelling ratios for the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers were measured by the solvent extraction method. A sample of 0.5 g of polyurethane elastomer was put into 20 ml DMF and soaked at room temperature for 72 h so that the noncrosslinked part was completely dissolved, and the sample finally reached swelling equilibrium. The swelling ratios were calculated by using the mass of the samples before and after swelling. After that, the solvent in the gel was removed by high-temperature drying, the remaining part was the cross-linked structure part of the polyurethane elastomer, and the ratio of its mass to the initial mass of the elastomer was the gel fraction. 2.2.3.3 Fourier transform infrared analysis (FT-IR) A Magna-IR 560 spectrometer (PerkinElmer Corporation) was used to collect Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. FT-IR was used to characterize the structure of the solid lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. The test was conducted using 64 scan cycles in a scan range of 4000–400 cm−1. 2.2.3.4 Tensile strength and cyclic tensile measurements The tensile strength and cyclic tensile strength of the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers were tested at room temperature with an INSTRON Instron Electronic Universal material testing machine (USA). According to the GB/T 528–2009 (China), polyurethane elastomer sheet samples (80 mm × 80 mm × 2 mm) were cut into dumbbell samples with a length of 35 mm, a narrow section width of 2 mm and a thickness of 2 mm, as shown in Fig. 1. The stretching rate was set at 20 mm∙min−1. Each sample was cut into five dumbbell specimens for testing. The stress-strain curves for the elastomers were obtained. 2.2.3.5 Dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA) DMA was carried out using a Netzsch 242E (Germany) apparatus. A stretch mode was used at a frequency of 10 Hz. The dimensions of all the samples were 30 mm × 5 mm × 2 mm. The temperature was varied from −80 °C to 100 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C∙min−1. 2.2.3.6 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA was performed using a TG-209F3 apparatus from NETZSCH in a nitrogen (N2 gas) atmosphere. The samples were placed into an alumina crucible and heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C∙min−1. 2.2.3.7 Self-healing properties To quantitatively evaluate the self-healing efficiency, lignin-containing polyurethane elastomer specimens were completely cut into two pieces under ambient atmosphere. Then, the broken dumbbell samples were reconnected at break and placed into an oven at 60 °C for 24 h (Sheng et al., 2020). The tensile strengths for the healed specimens were calculated according to the stress-strain curves. The self-healing efficiency was defined as the ratio of the tensile strength of the healed lignin-containing polyurethane elastomer specimen to that of the pristine specimen."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Synthesis and characterization of lignin-containing polyester polyols and polyurethane elastomers,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of lignin-containing polyester polyols and polyurethane elastomers Polyurethane elastomer was prepared with polyester polyol, isocyanate and small molecule chain extender as the main reaction raw materials. Inspired by the mussel byssus cuticle, lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers were designed as follows: (1) decanedioic acid is an aliphatic diol and one of the most commonly used raw materials for polyurethane synthesis. Decanedioic acid was chosen as the backbone because of its better dynamic flexibility and reactive carboxyl functional groups. The glycol was composed of NPG and EG. Due to the presence of symmetric pendant methyl groups in the NPG structure, it can affect the regularity of the polyester polyol structure, so that the prepared lignin-containing polyester polyol was liquid at room temperature. This facilitated the preparation of polyurethane elastomers; (2) Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide was chosen as the raw material because it contains disulfide bonds and reactive hydroxyl groups; (3) TDI was incorporated into the lignin-containing polyester polyol backbone as the hard domain since the benzene ring can impart a certain rigidity. (4) The existence of a large number of hydroxyl groups in lignin makes it possible to replace EG in the synthesis of the lignin-containing polyester polyol. In addition, lignin can also replace part of the small molecule chain extenders into the hard segment of the polyurethane elastomer. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), in LPES and S-LPES, the hydroxyl groups for NPG, EG and lignin form ester bonds with the carboxyl groups of decanedioic acid. As shown in Table 1, both LPES and S-LPES have high hydroxyl values, which lay the foundation for the preparation of polyurethane elastomers with good properties. In LPUE-LS and S-LPUE-L, lignin as a small molecule chain extender and polyester polyols react with isocyanate to form carbamate bonds to prepare the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. Because lignin has a polyhydroxy structure, the unesterified hydroxyl groups of lignin can interact with ester groups, carbamate groups and hydroxyl groups of the polyurethane molecular chain to form hydrogen bonds similar to the structure of catechol-metal complexes. At the same time, when bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is introduced into polyurethane elastomers, dynamic disulfide bonds are formed between the sulfur atoms in the molecular chain. When subjected to an external force, the unstable dynamic hydrogen and disulfide bonds in the molecular chain are first broken and dissipate energy, thereby improving the tensile strength of polyurethane elastomers. In addition, when polyurethane elastomers are broken by external stress, the molecular chains at the broken ends of elastomers are moved by external stimulation, the broken hydrogen and disulfide bonds recombine, and the elastomers were healed. The self-healing mechanism is shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Table 2, the swelling ratios for LPUE-LS (5.16) and S-LPUE-L (4.39) were lower than those of their counterparts, LPUE-S (8.78) and S-LPUE (8.64), and the gel fractions for LPUE-LS (71.03%) and S-LPUE-L (60.19%) were lower than their counterparts, LPUE-S (46.02%) and S-LPUE (30.72%), respectively. The small swelling ratio and high gel fraction of polyurethane elastomers indicates a higher degree of crosslinking. This result also proves that lignin and disulfide can participate in the synthesis of polyurethane elastomers, and the introduction of lignin increased the degree of cross-linking of the polyurethane elastomers, so that a partial cross-linked network is formed between the molecular chains of the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), during the swelling process, the lignin will leach out from the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. When lignin was used as a chain extender, the swelling ratio of LPUE-LS and S-LPUE-L were small and the gel fractions were large, and the degree of crosslinking of the polyurethane elastomers were large. Therefore, the color of the solvent was lighter when the swelling equilibrium was reached after 72 h of soaking. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the FT-IR spectra for LPES and S-LPES are similar. The absorption peaks observed at 3519 cm−1 are characteristic peaks for the stretching vibration of -O-H groups in polyester polyols. The vibrational peaks for OH groups in the two samples are almost the same, which indicates that bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is fully involved in the esterification reaction of acids and alcohols to obtain the same content of hydroxyl-terminated S-LPES. The absorption peaks at approximately 2931 cm −1 and 2857 cm−1 are assigned to the vibrations of CH and CH2 groups, respectively. The peak at 1374 cm−1 is assigned to the vibration of the syringyl nucleus, and the peak at 1236 cm−1 is due to the tensile vibration of CO bonds in lignin. This shows that lignin is successfully introduced into polyester polyols. The absorption peak at 603 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of SS bonds in S-LPES, which proves that the disulfide bonds are also introduced into the lignin-containing polyester polyols. FT-IR analysis was performed for LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L, LPUE-S and S-LPUE to confirm the effect of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin as different components on the structures of polyurethane elastomers, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The stretching vibration peaks for -O-H groups disappear, which indicates that polyester polyols are fully involved in the synthesis of polyurethane elastomers. The absorption peaks at 3310 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of NH bonds, which indicates that polyester polyols react with isocyanate to form polyurethanes. Compared with LPUE-LS and S-LPUE-L, the vibration peaks for NH bonds observed the infrared curves obtained for LPUE-S and S-LPUE are stronger, which indicate that the use of lignin as a chain extender affects the formation of urethane bonds between isocyanate and hydroxyl groups of polyester polyols and the chain extender. This is due to the complex molecular structure of lignin, and the hydroxyl groups are affected by the steric hindrance of the aromatic ring, resulting in limited reactivity for lignin with isocyanate groups. The peak at approximately 1729 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of CO bonds in the carbamate groups, which is affected by the formation and deformation of dynamic hydrogen bonds. The peak at approximately 603 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of SS bonds. Stretching vibrations for the CO and SS bonds were observed in all four samples. The peak at 2273 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of isocyanate groups, and the peak at 1536 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of the benzene ring. The results show that TDI does not react completely. Compared with lignin used as raw material, lignin used as a chain extender significantly affects the reaction between isocyanate groups and polyester polyols."
6,Thermal properties of the elastomers,"3.2 Thermal properties of the elastomers To investigate the effect of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and lignin on the thermostability of the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers, TGA was performed for LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L, LPUE-S and S-LPUE, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The characteristic parameters of T 5% and T max are summarized in Table 3. According to the DTG curves, the weight loss processes for the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers can be divided into two steps. The first weight loss step at approximately 200 °C to 350 °C occurs due to the breakage of carbamate bonds and the degradation of lignin used as a chain extender. The second step at approximately 350 °C to 500 °C is attributed to the decomposition of polyester polyol chain segments in polyurethane. Compared with LPUE-S and S-LPUE, the T 5% for polyurethane elastomers with lignin as a chain extender (LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L) is slightly lower. This is because lignin begins to decompose at approximately 200 °C, which leads to the destruction of the hard segment structure in polyurethane molecules. When the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is used as a chain extender, T 5% for polyurethane elastomers (LPUE-LS, LPUE-S) is lower. Disulfide bonds are weak dynamic crosslinking points. Therefore, as the temperature is increased, the stability of the SS bonds decreases, which leads to the breakage of the SS bonds, and the thermostability of polyurethane elastomers decreases. Among the four groups of lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers, LPUE-S shows the highest T max. Due to the multifunctional structure of lignin, a partial cross-linked network is formed between the molecular chains of polyurethane elastomers. This makes it more difficult to break the soft segment molecular chain in LPUE-S. The T g values for LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L, LPUE-S and S-LPUE were analyzed by DMA and are shown in Fig. 5(b). The T g was determined based on the peak value of the temperature curve corresponding to tanδ, and the characteristic parameters are summarized in Table 3. When bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is used as a chain extender, its T g is significantly increased, suggesting that the disulfide bonds hinder the movement of the molecular segment of the polyurethane elastomer. At the same time, this also shows that bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide as a chain extender has a far greater impact on the T g of polyurethane elastomers than as a raw material. When bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is used as a chain extender, the hard segment structure of the polyurethane molecular chain is more regular, and the SS bonds form dynamic interactions between the molecular chains. Therefore, higher energy is needed to move the molecular chains. However, lignin has little effect on the T g of polyurethane elastomers."
7,Tensile strength of the elastomers,"3.3 Tensile strength of the elastomers The tensile properties of LPUE-LS, S-LPUE-L, LPUE-S and S-LPUE are shown in Fig. 5(c). Each sample was tested multiple times, and its characteristic parameters are summarized in Table 4. The maximum tensile strengths for LPUE-LS (14.99 MPa) and S-LPUE-L (6.98 MPa) are found to be higher than their counterparts, LPUE-S (10.77 MPa) and S-LPUE (1.39 MPa), respectively. These results show that the introduction of lignin as a chain extender can significantly increase the tensile strength of polyurethane elastomers. On the one hand, the rigid aromatic ring structure of lignin improves the tensile properties of polymer elastomers. On the other hand, the unesterified hydroxyls of lignin can form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyls and carbamates of polyurethane, thereby increasing the tensile strength of the elastomers. When bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide is used as a chain extender, polyurethane elastomers (LPUE-LS and LPUE-S) show higher tensile strengths. This is because bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide has a linear and regular structure, and the existence of dynamic disulfide bonds significantly enhances the tensile strength of the polyurethane elastomers."
8,DMA analysis of the elastomers,"3.4 DMA analysis of the elastomers DMA was conducted to study the influence of disulfide bonds and lignin on E′ and tanδ for the polyurethane elastomers. The results show that the overall trend for E′ for polyurethane elastomers decreases with increasing of temperature, which is shown in Fig. 5(d). The E′ for S-LPUE is 2770 MPa, but the rate of decrease E′ is very significant. As the temperature is gradually increased, the speed of the molecular chain increases, and E′ drops rapidly. The results show that the molecular chain movement in S-LPUE is easy and the stability is poor, which is consistent with the TG test results. When the temperature is raised to room temperature, the E′ values for LPUE-LS and LPUE-S become higher, which is the same as the change law found from the stress-strain curves of LPUE-S."
9,Self-healing properties of the elastomers,"3.5 Self-healing properties of the elastomers The tensile strengths and elongations at break before and after healing were obtained by conducting tensile tests for the healing fractured samples again, as shown in Figs. 1 and 6(a) and (b). The self-healing efficiencies of the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers are summarized in Table 4. The self-healing efficiencies of LPUE-S (93.02%) and S-LPUE (93.34%) are higher than those of their counterparts, LPUE-LS (55.97%) and S-LPUE-L (72.47%), respectively. This indicates that regardless of whether disulfide bonds are introduced into the soft or hard segment polyurethane elastomers, the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers show an excellent self-healing ability. However, compared with LPUE-S and S-LPUE, the self-healing efficiencies of LPUE-LS and S-LPUE-L are low, which indicates that the use of lignin as a chain extender will affect the self-healing ability of polyurethane elastomers. This may be due to the complex structure and large steric hindrance of lignin, which leads to serious entanglement of molecular chains. The decrease in the mobility of molecular chains significantly affects the healing efficiency of polyurethane elastomers because the interaction between the sulfur atoms in the hard segment of the molecular chain is limited. Therefore, the lowest self-healing efficiency of LPUE-LS was 55.97%. In LPUE-S, lignin is used as a raw material for the polyester polyol reaction. The hydroxyl groups of lignin react with the carboxyl groups in decanedioic acid to form ester bonds, while the unesterified hydroxyls of lignin can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyls and carbamates of polyurethane. In addition, there are dynamic disulfide bonds in the hard segment of LPUE-S. Through the structural design of the polyurethane molecular chain, suitable soft and hard segment structures are incorporated that contain two dynamic chemical bonds. Therefore, compared with other biomass-based self-healing elastomers recently reported, LPUE-S shows a higher tensile strength and self-healing efficiency, as shown in Fig. 6(c)."
10,Fatigue resistance of LPUE-S,"3.6 Fatigue resistance of LPUE-S Cyclic tensile tests were performed for LPUE-S, as shown in Fig. 6(d). Four successive cyclic loading-unloading tensile curves for the LPUE-S sample at a strain of 120% were obtained. When the second cycle is repeated immediately after the first cycle, a notable residual strain (28.53%) is noticed and the hysteresis energy is significantly reduced. With an increase in the number of cycles, the hysteresis energy continuously decreases to a steady value of 1.78 MJ∙m−3 after the fourth cycle, manifesting fatigue resistance. This is because the dynamic chemical bonds in the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomer break and dissipate energy, which leads to LPUE-S exhibiting better fatigue resistance."
11,Conclusions,"Inspired by the self-healing of biological materials, we prepared lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers based on hydrogen and disulfide bonds with good self-healing (> 93%) and tensile strength (10.77 MPa) properties. In addition to participating in the synthesis reaction, the unesterified hydroxyls of lignin can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyls and carbamates of polyurethane similar to the structure of catechol-metal complexes. Although the introduction of lignin significantly improves the mechanical strength, its use as a chain extender leads to a complex structure and large steric hindrance, which hinders the reaction of lignin and isocyanate, thereby affecting the self-healing properties of the lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers. Therefore, we introduced disulfide bonds into lignin-containing polyurethane elastomers to improve their self-healing properties. It was found that the introduction order of disulfide bonds has little effect on the self-healing properties of polyurethane elastomers, but has a greater impact on the tensile strength and thermal stability. In this study, through precise molecular design, a lignin-containing polyurethane elastomer (LPUE-S) with dynamic hydrogen and disulfide bonds is found to exhibit good mechanical strength (E′ of 1125 MPa), fatigue resistance, thermal stability and self-healing ability. This study provides a new type of high-value application for corn stover lignin, which is expected to be used for the industrial production of polymer elastomers."
