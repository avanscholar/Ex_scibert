0,Introduction,"Both the growing world-population and the ecological and economic aspects of sustainable development require the alternative protein sources (Lucas, Stoddard, Annicchiarico, Frias, Martinez-Villaluenga, Sussmann, et al., 2015). Owning to the greater sustainability and lower production costs, plant proteins in human diet are becoming of increasing important which garnered a great deal of interests in their production and processing (Gorissen et al., 2018 bib_Gorissen_et_al_2018). Oat protein extracted from oat groats is one of the important plant proteins because of its superior amino acid composition and health promoting effect (Pomeranz, Robbins, & Briggle, 1971). Conventionally, plant proteins including oat protein are extracted by using alkaline extraction–isoelectric precipitation (AE–IEP) method. This approach, however, is time consuming and laborious; sometimes, it's non-environmentally friendly and easy to denature the protein due to repeated centrifugation and pH adjustment (Nałęcz, Dziuba, & Szerszunowicz, 2017). Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more sustainable and green biorefining technique for better extracting oat protein. Currently, much endeavor has been carried out to look for green sustainable approaches that can substitute the incumbent protein extraction methods to reduce operation time, as well as water and energy consumption. Among most of the novel green biorefining techniques, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a nascent class of green solvent system, have attracted enormous attentions due to its excellent biodegradability, sustainability, lower toxicity, as well as the easiness to prepare in food application (Zainal-Abidin, Hayyan, & Jayakumar, 2017). In general, DES can be simply formed using substituted quaternary ammonium salts such as food-grade choline chloride (ChCl) and hydrogen bond donors (e.g., such as sugar alcohols, acids, or water) (Dai, Witkamp, Verpoorte, & Choi, 2015). In recent years, a wide spectrum of natural bioactive compounds has been successfully extracted using DES. For instance, (Wan Mahmood, Lorwirachsutee, Theodoropoulos, & Gonzalez-Miquel, 2019) reported the extraction of natural polyphenolic antioxidants from Chlorella vulgaris with DES. (Cui et al., 2018) selectively extracted and enriched flavonoids from sea buckthorn leaves using DES. Bubalo et al. (Bubalo, Ćurko, Tomašević, Ganić, & Redovniković, 2016) reported green extraction of grape skin phenolics by using DES and proved it to be more efficient than methanol. In addition to the application in bioactive compounds extraction, the recent discovery and application of deep eutectic solvents provides new vision to the green extraction and separation of both animal and plant proteins. (Bai, Wei, & Ren, 2017) was able to extract and separate collagen peptides with high purity from cod skins based on DES. Using polyethylene glycol-based DES aqueous biphasic systems, researchers extracted and enriched proteins for Pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) seed and a model bovine serum albumin and papain protein solution (Liu et al., 2017; Pang, Sha, Chao, Chen, Han, Zhu, et al., 2017). Grudniewska and coworkers (Grudniewska et al., 2018 bib_Grudniewska_et_al_2018) successfully extracted protein from rapeseed cake and evening primrose cake using DES consisting of glycerol–choline chloride.Whereas DES has emerged as a promising alternative replacement for food protein extraction, there remain some technical and methodological issues for their applications in the food industry. Factors such as isomer analogues of a hydrogen bond donor and the presence of water on the formation of DES, and the structural and functionality of protein extracted by DES has yet to be addressed. Thus, the aim of this research is to optimize the synthesis of a green, simple and environment-friendly choline chloride‒butanediol based DES or DES/water binary mixtures to extract protein from oat flour. In particular, extraction time was firstly optimized in light of protein extraction yield. The impact of butanediol isomers, its molar ratio with choline chloride, and the effect of water on the structural and functional properties (e.g., solubility, foaming capacity and stability) of the extracted oat proteins was also investigated. The results obtained from this research will provide a better understanding on the structure and function property of plant protein extracted by using DES."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Naked oat variety Paul from crop year 2019 was obtained from Dr. Michael McMullen's oat breeding group at NDSU. Oat grain was ground to flour using a Udy cyclone mill (MODEL 3010–030, UDY Corp., Fort Collins, CO) with a 0.5 mm screen fitted inside as part of the mill. The moisture and protein contents of raw oat flour were 6.9% and 14.3%, respectively. Choline chloride (99%, <0.5% H2O), 1,2-butanediol (≥98.0%), 2,3-butanediol (98%), and 1,4-butanediol (99%) were purchased from Millipore Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from VWR International (West Chester, PA, USA). All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Distilled de-ionized water (DDW, 18.2 MΩ cm, Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for preparation."
3,Preparation of deep eutectic solvents,"2.2 Preparation of deep eutectic solvents The deep eutectic solvents (DESs) ware prepared according to the method with minor modifications (Dai, van Spronsen; Witkamp; Verpoorte, & Choi, 2013). Briefly, choline chloride and butanediol isomer with varied molar ratio (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) in the absence or presence of water (maintaining the same molar concentration as choline) were mixed in a 50 mL thermostable plastic tube (SCP Science, Champlain, NY). In total, 18 kinds of formulas were tested in the current study (Table 1 ). The tube was incubated at 100 °C in a temperature-programmable heating block system (Questron Technologies Corp, Mississauga, Canada) with intermittent agitation until a homogeneous and transparent liquid was formed (60 min). After cooling to the room temperature, the liquid remains rather than solidification indicating the formation of DES."
4,Protein extraction using DES,"2.3 Protein extraction using DES Extraction of oat protein was performed as reported by Grudniewska et al. (Grudniewska et al., 2018 bib_Grudniewska_et_al_2018) with some modifications. Briefly, 5 g oat flour was mixed with 45 g DES in the 50 mL thermostable tube which was then incubated in the heating block for different time (60, 90, or 120 min) at 80 °C with intermittent hand-shaking. After cooling to room temperature, the tube was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min (Allegra 21R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The supernatant was transferred in a 300 mL flask; while the precipitation was treated with fresh DES for three times (3 × 5 g) and re-centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min and the obtained supernatant was pooled with the same flask. The oat protein in the collected supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 250 mL distilled de-ionized water. The precipitation was then centrifuged at 6,500 rpm for 10 min and the obtained precipitation was washed by 20 mL distilled de-ionized water. The washing and centrifugation cycle was repeated thrice to remove any salts and the resultant precipitation was freeze-dried (SP Scientific, Gardiner, NY, USA). The oat proteins extracted by using DESs were termed DES#P. For example, DES3P refers to as oat protein extracted from oat flour using DES3 solvent. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The extraction yield (%) was calculated by Equation (1) ; while the protein recovery yield (%) was calculated by Equation (2) . (1) Extraction yield ( % ) = W 1 / W 2 × 100 % (2) Protein recovery yield ( % ) = ( W 1 × P 1 ) / ( W 2 × P 2 ) × 100 % where W1 and W2 is the weight (dry basis) of lyophilized proteins and raw oat flour, respectively; whereas P1 and P2 is protein content (dry basis) in the extracted protein and oat flour, respectively."
5,Determination of molecular weight by size exclusion chromatography with multiangle laser light scattering (SEC‒MALLS),"2.4 Determination of molecular weight by size exclusion chromatography with multiangle laser light scattering (SEC‒MALLS) Oat protein (2.0 wt%) was dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 M NaCl. The oat protein solution was magnetically stirred at 600 rpm at room temperature overnight, followed by a centrifugation at 3,300 g for 10 min to remove any impurities. The protein concentration of the filtered supernatant (0.45 μm) was determined using Bradford dye–binding method. Oat protein solution of different concentration was neutralized to 0.5 mg/mL by dilution. The molar mass of oat protein was analyzed by SEC–MALS following previous method(Y. Zhao, Mine, & Ma, 2004). SEC conditions were set as follows: 100 μL oat protein solution was injected, and eluted using sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, 1M NaCl, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min; a column temperature of 30 °C, specific-refractive-index increments (dn/dc) of sample solutions with 0.186 mg/mL."
6,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"2.5 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of all oat protein samples were analyzed using a Varian 600-IR series spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a high-sensitivity mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and a Pike Miracle three-bounce Germanium crystal ATR accessory (PIKE technologies, Madison, WI, USA). The background was recorded before each sample scanning. The samples were performed with oat protein powder in the absorbance wavenumber from 4,000 to 400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 at 32 scans. Amide-I region (1600−1700 cm−1) was used to obtain information of oat protein secondary structures. The second derivative, Gaussian fitted curve, and areas of Gaussian peaks were reported as results."
7,Determination of amino acid profiles,"2.6 Determination of amino acid profiles The amino acid content of oat protein was quantified by the method reported by Shen et al. without any modification (KabeloVá, Dvorakova, Cizkova, DoStáleK, & MelzoCH, 2009)."
8,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry The thermal characteristics of oat protein was analyzed by using a differential scanning calorimeter according to previously method with some modifications (Colombo, Ribotta, & LEOn, 2010). In brief, 20 mg of oat protein slurry (15.0 wt%) was loaded into a 40 μL Tzero aluminum pan that was then hermetically sealed. The temperature was ramped at a rate of 10 °C/min from 30 to 140 °C. An empty Tzero hermetic pan was used for the reference. Onset temperature (To) and denaturation temperature (Td) were determined and data were analyzed by TA Universal Analysis 2000 software."
9,Determination of protein percent solubility,"2.8 Determination of protein percent solubility The percentage protein solubility (PPS) of oat protein was measured based on previous method with minor modification(Adebiyi & Aluko, 2011). Percent protein solubility (PPS) was calculated using Equation (3) . (3) PPS% = ( protein concentration of sample/protein concentration of control ) × 100 %"
10,Foaming capacity and stability,"2.9 Foaming capacity and stability Foaming property of oat protein was characterized according to the previous study with minor modification (Adebiyi & Aluko, 2011). In brief, oat protein solution (1.0 wt%) at pH 7.0 was transferred in a 50 mL graduated centrifuge tube and foam was prepared by homogenizing the solution using a digital homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T 25, IKA Co., Germany) at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. Foaming capacity (FC) was calculated as the percent foaming volume in the initial suspensions volume while foam stability (FS) was estimated as the percentage of foam remaining after 30 min storage at 25 °C."
11,Statistical analysis,2.10 Statistical analysis Oat proteins were extracted by DESs by two separately batches. All measurements and characterizations were performed at least twice using freshly preparation samples. Results were expressed as means ± standard deviations of duplicate from each of independent experiment. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 22.0 version. Mean differences between sample treatment were assessed with one-way ANOVA followed with Duncan's test and significance of differences was defined at p < 0.05.
12,Results and discussion,
13,Synthesis of deep eutectic solvents and the selection for protein extraction,"3.1 Synthesis of deep eutectic solvents and the selection for protein extraction DES1‒9 (Table 1) were prepared by physically mixing choline chloride (hydrogen acceptor) with each of the three butanodiol isomers (hydrogen donors) in different molar ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively). Subsequently, the solid mixture was molten upon thermal treatment at 100 °C over 60 min. For each of the combination, only the molten mixtures with a molar ratio of 1:3 remained as a liquid state after returning back to room temperature. The other mixtures with higher amounts of ChCl (1:1 and 1:2) returned to a solid state, suggesting that high concentration of ChCl cannot interact with dihydric alcohol to form a DES. This observation was independent of butanodiol isomers, probably due to the weaker hydrogen bond interaction with dihydric alcohol under these molar ratios (1:1 and 1:2) (Ji et al., 2018). For the sysnthesis of DES/water binary mixture (DES10‒18), the molar concentration of water remained the same as ChCl to achieve different molar ratios (e.g., 1:1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:3:1, respectively). Interestingly, ChCl can be dissolved in the solution of dihydric alcohol and water, all of which stayed a liquid state at room temepeature. The results indicated that water can facilitate the synthesis of the DESs by serving as a co-solvent to increase the hydrogen bonding with ChCl (Pang et al., 2012). The practicability of using the synthesized 3 DESs and 9 DESs/water binary mixtures as an alternative method in the extraction oat protein was investigated (Table 1). All DESs can successfully extract protein from oat flours. Different DES/water binary mixtures were shown to have variable abilities to extract proteins. Particularly, the binary mixture with highest ChCl (1:1:1) failed to extract oat protein. This is possibly a result of high viscous solvent/flour mixtures that can not be separated by centrifugation (Abbott et al., 2011). Apart from the characteristic high visicosity of DES solvent, high beta-glucan content in oat flour may also contribute to the high viscosity (Daou & Zhang, 2012). The binary mixtures with lower concentration of ChCl (i.e., 1:2:1 and 1:3:1) were successful in protein extraction except the one with 2,3-butanediol at 1:2:1 ratio. The decrease in ChCl concentration can certainly reduce the viscosity of DESs; however, the viscosity of 2,3-butanediol was higher than that of 1,2-butanediol and 1,4-butanediol which compensated the viscosity reduction effect of water (Sun, DiGuilio, & Teja, 1992), making 2,3-butanediol based DES/water binary mixture unable to extract oat protein at 1:2:1 ratio. During protein extraction, it is worth noting that protein precipitated quickly in both 1,2-butanediol and 2,3-butanediol based DESs and the binary mixtures while it took more than 12 h for the precipiation to occur in the systems with 1,4-butanediol. This might be the result of the compositional divergence of DESs that differs their polarity (Pandey, Rai, Pal, & Pandey, 2014), and less polar is more benefical to precipitate proteins (Zhao, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, & Ao, 2018)."
14,Impact of DES extraction time on oat protein extraction yield,"3.2 Impact of DES extraction time on oat protein extraction yield The findings above suggest that the mixtures of ChCl and butanediol isomers at a molar ratio of 1:3 is appropriate for the formation of DESs and the binary mixtures, as well as protein extraction. We therefore selected this molar ratio to further our understanding on how extraction time (60, 90, and 120 min) could impact the performance of DES pertaining to protein extraction yield and recovery rate (Table 2 ). In general, the prolonged extraction time improved the extraction performance of all DES in oat protein extraction to a lesser extent. Considering both protein content and extraction yield, 90 min of extraction rendered the optimal performance for both DESs and the binary mixtures, or adverse effect was otherwise observed for certain DESs, e.g., 120 min of extraction. This is plausible as longer extraction time at a high tempearure (80 °C) could faciliate the extraction of beta-glucan which contributes to the increased viscosity of flour/DES mixture. DES/water binary mixtures had better performace on protein extraction than DES along under the same extraction time. The protein content, protein extraction yield, and recovery rate ranged from 38.92% to 55.82%, 3.17%–11.75%, and 13.91%–41.43%, repsectivley, in all extracts from three different extraction time. For such protein concent, all the oat proteins extracted herein are considered as oat protein concentrates. Among them, DES15P prepared with 90 min of extraction had the highest protein content (55.28%). However, it had the lowest protein recovery rate because of its lowest extraction yield. DES18P prepared with 90 min of extraction were the highest in both extraction yield and recovery rate, indicating that 2,3-butanediol as HBD is better than the other two in oat protein extraction performance. The DES assisted oat protein extraction showed promising extraction performance as it does not require pH adjustments."
15,Amino acid composition,"3.3 Amino acid composition To gauge the effect of DESs and the binary mixtures on the chemical structure of the extracted oat protein, animo acid profile of each oat protein was summarized in Table 3 . Essential amino acids (EAAs) play crux roles in human health and protein functionalities. Notably, the highest total EAAs occurred in DES3P, followed by DES6P and DES9P. In addition, the total EAAs of DES extracted protein (DES3P, DES6P, and DES9P) was generally higher than it from the corresponding DES/water binary mixture (DES12P, DES15P, and DES18P). In other words, DES, rather than its binary mixtures was capable of extracting oat protein with higher propotions of essential amino acids, with 1,2-butanediol based DES being the greatest. Moreover, the amino acid composition analysis revealed that oat protein had more hydrophilic AAs than hydrophobic residues in general. DES extracted oat proteins exhibited similar hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments with ~55% hydrophilic AA residues. The DES binary mixture extracted oat protein gained more hydrophilic residues (~58%). With regarding to individual EAA, the highest EAA content of oat protein was determined to be hydrophobic leucine (Leu) with the similar amount founded in all oat proteins except DES15P. Leu is a critical AA involved in muscle protein synthesis after exercise and its level in oat protein is even higher than it in some sea foods such as abalone (Shi, Hao, Chen, Ma, & Weng, 2020). Hydrophobic phenylalanine (Phe) is the second abundance EAA in oat protein. DES6P possessed the highest Phe accounting for 10.53% of total AA, whearas all DES binary mixtures extracted oat had the lowest. Glutamic acid (Glu) content in oat protein was the highest among the identified non-essential amino acid (NEAA), followed by aspartic acid (Asp) and arginine (Arg). The contents of the three amino acid ranged from 38.34% to 41.73%, and 41.18%–45.8% in DES and DES/water binary mixture extracted oat proteins, respectively. No significant difference was recorded in the rest of the NEAA (i.e, Ser, Gly, Pro, Ala, and Tyr) in all samples. Taking together, DES altered the amino acids profiles as well as the hydrophilic/hydrophobic AA segments of the extracted oat proteins which might be due to the selectivity of DES for the subunits of oat protein."
16,Structure properties of oat protein extracted by DES,"3.4 Structure properties of oat protein extracted by DES 3.4.1 Secondary structure of oat protein The FTIR amide I spectrum (1600–1700 cm−1) has been intensively applied to determine the secondary structure (e.g., α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turns) of proteins (Dukor, Chalmers, & Griffiths, 2001). In this study, the best matching secondary derivatives and the fitted curve of amide I for all oat proteins extracted by DESs and its binary mixture were provided in Fig. 1 S and the calculated oat protein secondary structures were listed in Table 4 . In general, FTIR was able to resolve three types of secondary structure in all oat proteins including α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turn which was in agreement with previous studies (Liu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2018). The results also indicated that butanediol isomers altered the proportions of secondary structure in DES extracted oat protein. Whereas the proportion of α-helix in oat proteins (DES3P and DES6P) extracted by 1,2-butanediol or 1,4-butanediol based DES was identical, 2,3-butanediol significantly increased the content of α-helix in DES9P. This was inversely related to the β-sheets content where the lowest level was observed in DES9P. β-turn content in DES extracted oat protein remained similar (p > 0.05), which was independent of butanediol isomers. DES/water binary mixture had varied influence on the secondary structure of oat proteins. The addition of water in 2,3-butanediol based DES appreciably increased α-helix content in the oat protein it extratced, making it the highest among all 6 protein extracts. This however was contrast to 1,2-butanediol or 1,4-butanediol based DES binary mixture where the addition of water actually decreased the content of α-helix in the extracted oat protein. The lowest β-sheet content was observed in DES18P; while it remained constant in oat protein extracted by the DES binary mixture as compared to its counterpart in the absence of water. 3.4.2 Molecular structure of oat protein SEC‒MALLS was employed to elucidate the impact of DESs and the binary mixtures on weight-average (M w) and number-average molecular weight (M n), as well as polydispersity (I = M w/M n) of oat protein (Table 5 ) (Zha, Yang, Rao, & Chen, 2019). Representative SEC elution profiles were presented in Fig. 2S. In general, all oat proteins extracted by DES were separated into three different fractions in SEC profiles. In DES extracted oat proteins, the first mass fraction varied from 3.84 × 105 to 7.53 × 105 g/mol. This peak was presumably ascribed to the biopolymer impurities such as medium M w beta-glucan of oat flour, whose average M w was ~6 × 105 g/mol (Kim & White, 2013). Additionally, the polydispersity of this peak (1.12–1.30) was also similar to the reported value for heated beta-glucan (Wang, Wood, & Cui, 2002). According to the previous study, the average M w of hexameric oat globulin fluctuated from 3.0 × 105 to 3.5 × 105 g/mol depending on measurement sequence, extraction method and protein purity (Runyon, Sunilkumar, Nilsson, Rascon, & Bergenståhl, 2015; Liu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2004). Thus, the oat globulin (12S) in DES extracted oat protein was eluted in the second fraction, accounting for 65.4%, 67.9%, and 73.1% of total mass in DES3P, DES6P, and DES9P, respectively. Interestingly, the average M w of oat globulin in all three ChCl−butanediol isomers DES was identical (3.18 × 105 g/mol). We reasoned this to the nonselective extraction properties of butanediol based DES to globulin in oat flour. The calculated polydispersity index (I) of oat globulin in DES3P and DES9P was close to 1, indicating its narrow range of molecular weight distribution (Zha et al., 2019). A broader distribution (I = 2.25) was registered in DES6P which might be because of composition difference in the samples. The last fraction may correspond to the mixture of acidic and basic polypeptides or low M w beta-glucan in the protein extracts (Zhao et al., 2004). Oat protein extracted by DES/water binary mixtures shared similar pattern in which three major mass fractions were resolved. However, higher proportion of oat globulin (>71.8%) in total mass was obtained in all three binary mixtures extracted oat protein. The mass distribution of oat protein (DES15P) extracted by ChCl−1,4-butanediol/water was profoundly different to the rest of oat proteins; and oat globulin (3.34 × 105 g/mol) was eluted in the first fraction followed by two smaller peaks. Considering its highest protein content (55.72%) among all 6 extracts, we postulated that ChCl−1,4-butanediol/water (DES15) could effectively remove medium M w of beta-glucan, thus improving the extraction efficacy for oat globulin."
17,Functionality of oat protein extracted by DES,"3.5 Functionality of oat protein extracted by DES 3.5.1 Thermal stability of oat protein Protein thermal properties is important for the design of food processing strategies. The denaturation temeperature (Td) of DESs and the binary mixtures extracted oat protein varied from 105 °C to 111 °C (Fig. 1A), which is higher than most of the food proteins. This denoted the great stability of oat protein against thermal processing which may benefit from the higher degree of beta-sheet and the type of hydrophobic AA residues in oat protein. Differences in denaturation temperatures of glubular proteinswere believed to be determined by nonpolar hydrophobic interactions and cooperative transitions between the broken bonds during thermal processing (Peyrano, de Lamballerie, Avanza, & Speroni, 2017). Previous researches including another study in our laboratory (under reivew) found that Td of oat protein extraced by conventional method is ~111 °C (Sunilkumar & Tareke, 2019). A similar Td was recorded for DES3P and DES9P, while a significantly lower number was detected in DES6P. This may be attributed to the facilitation of protein structure unfolding by ChCl−1,4-butanediol (DES6) duing heat-assisted extraction which in turn shift the denaturation transition towards lower temperature, thus decreasing the thermal stablity of oat protein. Similar effcts have been found in ionic liquids (ILs), virtual analogues of DESs. The type of salt used to form ILs determines the denaturation temperature of the dissolved protein and the increase in hydrophobicity of cation could strongly decrease Td of protein (Constantinescu, Weingärtner, & Herrmann, 2007; Kareem, Mjalli, Hashim, & AlNashef, 2010). The presence of water in DES engendered a drastically opposite effect on Td of the extracted oat protein. The Td of oat protein extracted by ChCl−1,4-butanediol/water (DES15) became the highest while the other two (DES12P and DES18P) had the lowest. Water plays an important role not only in food systems to affect protein conformations, it also showed remarkable impact on the physicochemical properties of protein in hydrated ILs and DES (Durand, Lecomte; Baréa, Dubreucq, Lortie, & Villeneuve, 2013; Ohno, Fujita, & Kohno, 2015). As an example, de Diego and coworkers noted the loss of ribonuclease A thermal stability and activity in hydrated IL containing 2% of water as compared to its activity in water free IL (De Diego, Lozano, Gmouh, Vaultier, & Iborra, 2005). Durand et al. found that increasing the water content from 2% to 20% in ChCl:urea DES progressively boosted the thermal stability of lipase at 60 °C, furnishing a tenfold rise in enzymatic activity. A possible rationale for our findings was that the presence of water may induce a butanediol isomers-dependent change in the polarity of DES, which may alter oat protein structures and thermal stability. The more concrete mechanism should be unraveled in further study. 3.5.2 Foaming capacity and stability We further explored the foaming capacity and stability of oat protein extracted by DESs and the binary mixtures (Fig. 1B). The lowest and highest protein capacity was found in DES3P and DES9P, respectively. The foaming stability of oat protein was in consistence with it corresponding foaming capacity. Surprisingly, the order of foam capacity was flipped in the presence of water and DES12P along with DES15P (p > 0.05) led the foaming capacity in the binary mixtures. In terms of foaming stability, a similar situation was observed in which the order of foam capacity and stability was reversed after the addition of water in DESs. Protein solubility is an important property governing many protein functionalities including foaming capacity and stability. By measuring the protein percentage solubility, we found all oat proteins had relatively poor solubility (<25%), which was not uncommon in most of the cereal based proteins even high amount of hydrophilic AA residues was determined (Fig. 1C). This is because, in addition to hydrophilic/hydrophobic segments, the secondary structure is also a determinant factor for protein solubility. The higher amount of β-sheet and β-turn in DES extracted oat proteins may counteract the positive contribution of hydrophilic AA residues on oat protein solubility. As regard to the role of butanediol isomers on oat solubility, DES9P extracted by ChCl−2,3-butanediol DES had the highest solubility, followed by DES6P and DES3P. The presence of water greatly improved the solubility of oat protein (DES15P) extracted by 1,4-butanediol based DES/water binary mixture while a decline was noticed in 2,3-butanediol basedDES/water binary mixture extracted DES18P. This may partically explain the improvement of foaming capacity and stability specifically for DES15P as the solubility of protein is generally positively correlated with foaming capacity. In addition, we cannot overlook the differences of protein content in all extracts on foaming capacity. Considering the highest protein content in DES15P, more protein can be moved to air‒water interface, thus warranting an increased foam capacity and stability (Stone, Karalash, Tyler, Warkentin, & Nickerson, 2015). Nevertheless, the increased amount of hydrophilic AA segments as well as the proportion of α-helix in DES18P doesn't guarantee a better solubility and foaming capacity. It is posited that the functionality of DESs extracted oat protein is reliant on the interplay of amino acid composition and secondary structure."
18,Conclusions,"This study proposed a green and feasible one-step oat protein biorefining method by applying deep eutectic solvents (DESs) free of pH adjustment. Among the nine ChCl and butanediol isomers mixture, only the ones with ChCl to butanediol molar ratio of 1:3 can successfully synthesize DES which is independent of isomers. The presence of water allows all the formulas to form DES/binary mixture. Three choline chloride‒butanediol isomer DESs (molar ratio 1:3) and the corresponding DES/water binary mixtures (molar ratio 1:3:1) were applied to extract oat protein. Both dihydric alcohol isomers and water addition have a considerable effect on protein extraction performance and structural properties of the extracted oat proteins. Oat protein (DES15P) extracted by ChCl‒1,4-butanediol/water binary mixture for 90 min bears the highest protein content (55.28%). This is corroborated by the SEC-MALLS results in which 72.6% mass fraction of DES15P is eluted in the first peak with Mw of 3.34 × 105 g/mol. The amino acid composition analysis denotes that DES extracted oat proteins possesses more hydrophilic AA residues (~55%) than hydrophobic segments, which can be slightly increased by the presence of water in DESs. The secondary structure analysis reveals that β-sheet and β-turn dominates the oat protein indicating the relative rigidity in structure flexibility. Oat protein (DES9P) extracted by 2,3-butanediol based DES shows the highest content of α-helix (43.80%). The addition of water to this DES exerts a boost effect on the α-helix (45.55%) of the protein. Contrarily, 1,2-butanediol or 1,4-butanediol based DES/water binary mixture reduces the amount of α-helix in oat protein. Both butanediol isomers and water addition also impact the functional properties of the extracted oat protein. A lowest Td is detected in oat protein (DES6P) extracted by ChCl‒1,4-butanediol DES. The presence of water in ChCl‒1,4-butanediol DES makes the oat protein (DES15P) the highest in Td. The foaming capacity of oat protein is consistent with it corresponding stability with the lowest being the DES6P extracted by ChCl‒1,4-butanediol DES; it however becomes the highest when water is incoperated. As water solubility of oat protein cannot explicitly explain the role of water in both Td and foaming capacity of all oat proteins, we speculate that the functionality of oat protein is influenced by the interplay of amino acid composition and secondary structure, both of which may be independently modified by the polarity of DES with different butanediol isomers or in the presence of water. Overall, ChCl‒1,4-butanediol/water binary mixture at a molar ratio of 1:3:1 may be applied as a novel solvent to replace conventional laborious method for oat protein extraction. Still, more studies, such as the potential toxicity and DES residuals of the extracts are required before the DES extracted oat protein can be applied in the food system."
