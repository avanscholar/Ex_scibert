0,Introduction,"Cinnamyl alcohol is an important raw chemical for the preparation of flavoring, perfumery, cosmetics, and drug, etc [1–3]. At present, the promising preparation method of cinnamyl alcohol mainly focuses on chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated cinnamaldehyde. Unfortunately, the process is usually carried out by the simultaneous hydrogenation of the carbon-oxygen bond (CO) and the carbon-carbon bond (CC). First-principles density functional theory calculations have suggested that hydrogenation of CO has higher activation barriers than the hydrogenation of CC, particularly over the supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) on metal oxides [4]. And if the primary product has strongly bound to catalyst surface, saturated alcohols could then be obtained from over-hydrogenation. Accordingly, the production of cinnamyl alcohol directly from chemoselective hydrogenation of CO in cinnamaldehyde remains a scientific challenge [5,6]. How to simultaneously increase the turnover frequencies and the selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol is then a critical question worthy of further study. For instance, creating steric hindrance (e.g., capping ligands) around the CC bond can increase the selectivity of unsaturated alcohol as the hindered CC has less possibility to interact with the catalyst surface [7,8]. Alternatively, Tang et al have reported using metal-organic frameworks (MOF) as effective selectivity regulators for realizing the thermodynamically favored hydrogenation of CO rather than CC [9]. Among the various heterogeneous catalysts, Pt-based materials have exhibited good activity for the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [4,9]. Although PtNPs loading on typical carriers (e.g., graphite, RGO, g-C3N4, Al2O3, and so on) have shown good activity, the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol is relatively poor due to either the preferential activation of CC or over-hydrogenation of primary intermediates [10,11]. Accordingly, great attempts have been made to develop strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) in the Pt-based materials by changing the electronic states, particle size, charge distribution, etc [12,13]. For instance, the electronic SMSI tailored the 5d state of Pt on Co3O4 for enhanced activity in the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane [14]. The change in the chemical state of active sites will affect the chemisorption capacity of the reactants/intermediates, thereby influence both catalyst activity and product selectivity [15,16]. The generated SMSI will also affect the adsorption capacity for hydrogen [17]. Furthermore, numerous studies have been devoted to immobilization of bimetallic nanoparticles on catalysts or doping other oxygen-philic transition metal promoters (Fe, Sn, FeOx, etc.) to improve the CO selectivity in the hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes, wherein the PtNPs were generally loaded through a traditional impregnation method to achieve a high turnover frequency [18–30]. It is well known that the catalytic properties of materials are closely related to its structure in nanoscale [31]. For instance, hollow mesoporous materials have become one of the research hotspots in recent years, due to the interesting physical properties and the confined space [32,33]. The hollow cavity within mesoporous shells has the characteristics of confined space, high atomic utilization, and low transportation barrier, [34] which could be utilized in a myriad of applications, including catalysis, adsorption, separation, biomedicine, and chemical sensors, and so forth [35–37]. For instance, Vu et al. have developed a variety of hollow carbon nanotube-based catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru) for the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, which indicates that the hollow structure greatly reduce the mass transfer barrier and the generated SMSI may dedicate to promoting the preferential activation of CO [38]. In this work, we have synthesized six different integrated nanocatalysts consisting of PtNPs and transition metal silicate (TMS) hollow support. Scheme 1 a illustrates the preparative routes of the six different catalysts by either the two-step method or one-pot method. In the two-step route (viz., the sol-immobilization method), three TMS hollow support were firstly synthesized, including nickel silicate (NS), ferric silicate (FS), and Fe/Ni bimetallic silicate (FNS), and the presynthesized PtNPs were then loaded on the carrier (see structural models 1, 2 and 3 in Scheme 1a). In addition to the sol-immobilization method, we also adopted a one-pot method to prepare three other Pt/TMS catalysts (see structural models 4, 5 and 6 in Scheme 1a). Specifically, PtNPs were in-situ deposited on transition metal silicate due to the reducibility of disodium maleate or sodium acetate under hydrothermal conditions. The new synthetic strategy has both high reproducibility and high Pt atomic loading efficiency. The catalytic performance of the six designed nanocatalysts was examined towards the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were also used to reveal the electronic interactions of the ternary components during the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. The current study is expected to provide a valuable reference for designing hollow nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and industrial application prospects."

11,Results and discussions,
12,Catalysts preparation and characterizations,"3.1 Catalysts preparation and characterizations In this work, silica nanoparticles (ca., 200 nm, Fig. S1a) were used as a sacrificial template to prepare hollow TMS, including NS, FS, and FNS (see Scheme 1b) [39,40]. In the hollow TMS support, the Ni and Fe were not used as a dopant, but they were directly obtained from the compositional-tunable metal silicates. Moreover, the molar ratio of Fe/Ni can be easily adjusted during the preparation of transition metal silicate by the hydrothermal method. The hollow structures of the three TMS were checked by TEM, as displayed in Fig. 1 . It was clearly seen that NS hollow nanospheres were assembled from uniform nanosheets with an overall particle size of ca. 250 nm and an average shell thickness of 9 nm. As compared with NS, FS hollow nanospheres were produced with a thicker shell (48 nm), but the overall particle size was relatively small (ca. 200 nm). Moreover, the shell of FS was assembled from small-sized nanowires instead of nanosheets. Interestingly, the FNS had the characteristics of both silicates, exhibiting a medium thickness (ca., 24 nm) and an overall particle size of ca. 300 nm. Again, the SEM image shows the spherical NS actually owns an urchin-like morphology (see Fig. S1b), indicating the assembly of nanosheets on the external surface. The external surface of the FS was highly porous and rough due to the formation of surface burrs and wrinkles (see Fig. S2). The hollow cavity of the three TMS was conducive to the mass transfer of the reactants, and the shell composed of nanosheets or nanowires contributed to the highly-efficient loading of PtNPs. N2 physisorption isotherms of the three TMS are shown in Fig. 2 a-c. As shown, NS, FS and FNS all exhibited typical IV isotherms with a relatively obvious hysteresis and no saturated adsorption platform was observed [41]. The presence of a hysteresis loop (H3 type) was due to the slit holes in layered mesoporous materials [42]. The BET specific surface areas (SBET) of NS, FS, and FNS were determined as 125, 140, and 133 m2/g, respectively. Furthermore, the average pore sizes of NS, FS, and FNS were basically the same based on the BJH model (see Fig. 2f), which were all in the mesoporous region (around 3.9 nm). More textural information of the porous TMS can be found in Table S1, including SBET, pore-volume, and pore size. The crystal phases of the prepared TMS were further analyzed by XRD, as displayed in Fig. 3 a. The characteristic diffraction pattern of NS was in good agreement with the Ni3Si2O5(OH)4 (JCPDS NO.49–1859), indicating the formation of nickel silicate [39]. For instance, the diffraction peaks located at 7.4°, 20.1°, 34.9°, 36.2°, and 61.2° were corresponding to (002), (110), (200), (202), (060) crystal planes of the monoclinic nickel silicate, respectively. And no other impurity was detected. However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of ferric silicate (Fe2Si2O5(OH)4, JCPDS NO.72–1674) partially overlapped with the peaks of Fe2O3 appearing at 2θ of 19.5°, 32.9° and 35.4°, indicating the presence of few amounts of Fe2O3 in FS sample [43]. The XRD pattern of FNS was quite similar to FS, with a weak diffraction peak belonging to (110) of the metal silicate phase. We then immobilized PtNPs on TMS support through the two different preparation routes, forming Pt/FNS-T and Pt/FNS-O catalysts. The XRD patterns of Pt supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 3b, wherein, no Pt signal is determined, probably due to the small size of PtNPs. In addition, there was no obvious change in the morphology of FNS support after loading PtNPs, which well-maintained the original appearance of urchin-like spheres (see Fig. 4 a,b). TEM images of Pt/FNS-O catalyst are described in Fig. 4c-e, indicating that PtNPs were well-dispersed on the shell layer of FNS. The EDX elemental maps also confirmed the uniform distribution of PtNPs over the FNS support (Fig. S3). Interestingly, the morphology and cavity size of Pt/FNS-T were a bit different from those of Pt/FNS-O (Fig. 4f-h). The N2 physisorption indicated that both Pt/FNS-O and Pt/FNS-T maintain the mesoporous structure (Fig. 2d,e). Interestingly, the SBET of Pt/FNS-T (88.5 m2 g−1) was significantly smaller than the original FNS of 134 m2 g−1, suggesting that the loaded PtNPs partially blocked the pore in support [44]. However, the SBET of Pt/FNS-O increased to 186 m2 g−1, indicating that the in-situ deposition of PtNPs did not alter the textural structure of FNS. On the contrary, larger cavities were produced after the introduction of PtNPs on FNS. Furthermore, we found that the Pt loading on Pt/FNS-O (3.1 wt%) was higher than that on Pt/FNS-T (0.9 wt%), even using the same amount of Pt precursor, suggesting a higher metal loading efficiency of the one-pot preparation route. The reason may be due to that Pt precursor used in the one-pot method was entrapped in the silicate network before they were subjected to reduction, leading to strong interactions [45]. The surface chemical compositions in the six different kinds of Pt/TMS catalysts were further analyzed by XPS. For instance, Pt 4f spectra in the three Pt/TMS-O samples can be found in Fig. 5 a. It should be noted that the peak at binding energy (BE) of ∼68.5 eV was due to Ni 3p (highlighted in green color). Interestingly, only metallic Pt° was found in Pt/NS-O catalyst, however, both Pt0 and Ptδ+ were found in Pt/FS-O and Pt/FNS-O catalysts. The molar ratio of surface Pt0/(Pt0+Ptδ+) was calculated to be 100%, 74.3%, and 60.3% in Pt/NS-O, Pt/FNS-O, and Pt/FS-O, respectively. In addition, the deconvoluted peaks of Pt 4f 7/2 peaks were located at 71.2 eV, 71.6 eV, and 71.8 eV in Pt/NS-O, Pt/FNS-O, and Pt/FS-O catalysts, respectively. The peak shifted to lower BE, indicating that NS carrier donated electrons to Pt, leading to increased electron density around PtNPs. In contrast, as FS carrier was combined with Pt, the spin-orbital peaks of Pt 4f shifted toward higher BE, suggesting the transfer of electrons from Pt to FS carrier. A similar trend was observed over three Pt/TMS-T catalysts (see Fig. 5b). The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p are shown in Fig. 5c, d. The symmetric spin-orbital peaks located at BEs of ∼856 eV and ∼873 eV were assigned to Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2, respectively, which indicated the existence of Ni2+ in the composites. XPS spectra deconvolution analysis indicated that NS support comprised of two Ni2+ species with Ni 2p 3/2 BEs of ∼856.3 eV and ∼859.4 eV, which corresponded to 1:1 nickel silicate (Ni3(Si2O5)(OH)4) and 2:1 nickel silicate (Ni3(Si2O5)2(OH)2), respectively [40,46]. The structural models of the two different TMS can be found in Fig. 6 a,b, which shows that the mono- and bi-piece martensitic sheets (1:1 and 2:1) have octahedrally coordinated metal ions, interconnected with SiO4 tetrahedrons [40,47]. While the peak centered at BE of ∼862.9 eV was caused by the oscillating satellite peak of Ni2+. Likewise, the two Ni2+ species were also found in the catalysts prepared by the two-step method (see Fig. 5d). The dominating peak of Ni 2p 3/2 shifted to higher BE (ΔBE =0.4 eV) as comparing Pt/NS-O and Pt/FNS-O, indicating the transferred electrons from Ni to Fe within FNS support. Likewise, the ΔBE of Ni 2p 3/2 peaks in Pt/NS-T and Pt/FNS-T was found to be 0.37 eV. Furthermore, the XPS spectra corresponding to Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 doublet pairs can be found in Fig. 5e,f. The peak of Fe 2p 3/2 could be decomposed into two peaks at BEs of 712.4 eV and 716.1 eV, respectively, which were assigned to 1:1 ferric silicate (Fe2(Si2O5)(OH)4) and 2:1 ferric silicate (Fe2(Si2O5)2(OH)2). The presence of satellite peaks at 720.6 eV further confirmed that Fe2+ precursor was oxidized to Fe3+ during the fabrication of catalysts. The oxidation process could also be verified by the color change of the synthetic solution from green to orange after the hydrothermal reaction. The above XPS findings reveal that PtNPs have strong electronic interactions with the TMS support, and the electronic interactions among the ternary components can be illustrated in Fig. 6c. For instance, electrons in Ni 3d-state might transfer to Fe 3d-state or Pt 5d-state, and Fe 3d-state might also receive electrons from Pt. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 7 . For the pure NS, the two main broad peaks located at 484 °C and 670 °C, respectively, which were attributed to 1:1 and 2:1 martensitic sheets (Fig. 7a). As can be seen from Fig. 6a,b, the 2:1 martensitic sheets in TMS structure are protected on two tetrahedral SiO4 layers. In addition, adjacent OH groups in the octahedral layer of 1:1 TMS could promote dehydroxylation [48]. Therefore, the 2:1 TMS is more difficult to be reduced by H2, corresponding to higher reduction temperature in TPR profiles. Interestingly, after immobilization of PtNPs, all the peaks belonging to the TMS shifted to lower temperatures, which was due to that PtNPs facilitated the hydrogen dissociation and the split hydrogen atoms had stronger reducibility compared to hydrogen molecules (Fig. 7b) [49]. It is worth noting that the reduction peaks at around 225 °C and 295 °C in Pt/FSO sample might be attributed to the presence of Ptδ+ and Fe2O3, respectively. The presence of more Ptδ+ was due to the electronic interactions between PtNPs and FS carrier, which is in good agreement with the above XPS analysis. In addition, the H2-TPR profile of Pt/NSO shows no clear reduction peak due to Ptδ+, which is in line with the electronic interactions between NS and Pt (Fig. 6c). Similarly, these phenomena have also been found in the catalysts prepared by the two-step method (Fig. 7c)."
13,Chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde,"3.2 Chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde Subsequently, all the obtained Pt/TMS catalysts were evaluated in the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde by using toluene as solvent (labeled as Pt/TMS-O-B and Pt/TMS-T-B) or water solvent (labeled as Pt/TMS-O-W and Pt/TMS-T-W). Fig. 8 a illustrates the reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Firstly, the blank experiments with pristine TMS as a catalyst showed no activity in either water or toluene as solvent, indicating that Pt indeed served as active sites to dissociation of H2 into hydrogen atoms, thereby attacking the CC and CO bonds of cinnamaldehyde [50,51]. Prior research indicated that the interfacial effect of metal and support is a key factor in optimizing the selectivity of hydrogenation reactions [52]. As shown in Fig. 8b,c, it was found that the catalysts using NS as a carrier (Pt/NS-O and Pt/NS-T catalysts) exhibited high conversion regardless of solvent, but the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol was quite low. In contrast, the use of FS as a carrier (Pt/FS-O and Pt/FS-T catalysts) could significantly increase the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol, but their activities were very low. The low activity was probably due to the decreased electron density of Pt (forming Ptδ+) which led to a decreased adsorption capacity of H2. From this point of view, the chemical state of Pt in the catalyst may be a key factor affecting the catalytic performance. Likewise, the high selectivity of FS based catalysts can be ascribed to a strong oxygen affinity of iron sites, favoring preferential activation of the CO bond [53]. Moreover, the Pt/TMS-T catalysts exhibited higher activity when toluene was used as a solvent, which was probably due to the loaded PtNPs were coated with DDA to reduce their surface energy. Conversely, the catalytic performance of Pt/TMS-O in water was significantly better than that in toluene. The reason might be due to that the water solvent would provide an alternative reaction path for hydrogenation of CO bond via a reduced activation barrier [54,55]. Interestingly, the obtained FNS can be employed as a good carrier to achieve both high activity and high selectivity. We further investigated the effect of the molar ratio of Fe/Ni in FNS carriers on the catalytic performance (see Fig. 8d, e). Clearly, the increase of Ni content was beneficial to the high conversion of cinnamaldehyde, while the increase of Fe content led to the enhanced selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol. It was found that the optimal molar ratio of Fe/Ni was 2, which exhibited the best catalytic performance. The tread was applicable for catalysts prepared by both methods. Fig. S4 presents the reaction process as a function of time over Pt/FNS-O-W (Fe/Ni = 2) catalyst at 30 °C and 1 MPa (H2). In the initial stage of the reaction (< 1 h), the conversion of cinnamaldehyde continuously raised, while the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol stabilized at around 88 %. The catalyst exhibited a high conversion (98 %) and with good selectivity (86 %) at the reaction time of 1 h. As further extending the reaction time, the conversion hardly increased, but part of the cinnamaldehyde product was over-hydrogenated to HCOL, resulting in a decreased selectivity. In addition, taking Pt/FNS-O-W as an example (Fe/Ni = 2), the Pt content on the used catalyst was only slightly decreased, showing high stability against leaching. It is well-known that the hydrophobic catalysts would facilitate the adsorption of organic compounds with weak polarities on the surface [11,56,57]. Considering that TMS had a rough outer surface favorable for hydrophobic modification,[58] we further modified the Pt/TMS-T catalyst by cetyltrimethoxysilane for further enhancing their catalytic performance in toluene solvent. Fig. 9 a illustrates the FTIR spectra of the Pt/TMS-T catalysts before and after modification. The characteristic stretching vibration peak of Si-O-Si appeared at 1103 cm−1, and the peaks at 3439 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1, were corresponding to the stretching vibration and bending vibration of OH in TMS, respectively [59,60]. The characteristic absorption peaks of Ni-Si-O and Fe-Si-O were found at 1019 cm−1 and 630 cm−1, respectively. After the surface modification, the peaks appeared at 2922 and 2848 cm−1, which were assigned to CH stretching vibrations of methyl and methylene groups, respectively [59,61]. The results indicated that the long-chain alkane was successfully modified on the TMS surface. Moreover, the change in water contact angle further verified the successful surface modification of TMS (Fig. 9 b-g). Although a similar modification method was applied, the hydrophobization degree of the three TMS was quite different. For instance, the modified NS had a superhydrophobic surface with a high water contact angle of 152°. Nevertheless, the corresponding water contact angles of FS-M and FNS-M were only 28° and 60°, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10 , after loading PtNPs via the two-step method, the surface-modified catalysts exhibited much higher activity than the unmodified catalysts, at both 30 °C and 60 °C reaction conditions. Generally, the larger water contact angle, the higher conversion of cinnamaldehyde was achieved. However, it was found that the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol decreased, particularly at higher reaction temperatures (e.g., 60 °C, Fig. 10b). Based on the above results, a plausible mechanism for chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over Pt/FNS catalyst was proposed, as shown in Fig. 11 . First, H2 molecules were adsorbed and dissociated on the Pt sites, and the generated H atoms were transferred to the substrates (mainly adsorbed on the FNS) probably via hydrogen-bonded water networks to reduce the activation energy barrier of hydrogenation of CO bond [54,55,62]. The electronic interactions also significantly affected the catalytic performance. For instance, electrons on the NS carrier was partially transferred to Pt, which enhanced the electron cloud density of the active Pt and promoted the adsorption of H2, thereby exhibiting higher conversion of cinnamaldehyde [63]. Meanwhile, FS carrier serving as an oxophilic material contributed to the preferential activation of CO bond, resulting in an enhanced selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol [62,64]. Moreover, Pt could also transfer electrons to FS carrier, which could effectively prevent the over-hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to phenylpropanol."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed two different methods to prepared Pt/TMS integrated nanocatalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. It was revealed that the one-pot method was more suitable for preparing catalysts working in aqueous solvents, whereas, the catalysts prepared from the two-step method exhibited better catalytic performance in toluene solvent. Furthermore, the surface modification of Pt/TMS with cetyltrimethoxysilane could enhance their performance as using toluene as a solvent. Importantly, the hollow TMS carriers showed dramatic impacts on the C = O hydrogenation activity of Pt/TMS. Regardless of the preparation methods employed, Pt/NS exhibited high conversion but poor selectivity. Although Pt/FS led to a much higher selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol owing to the oxophilic nature of Fe sites, the presence of a large amount of Ptδ+ was detrimental to the dissociation and adsorption of H2, resulting in a poor activity. The XPS and H2-TPR analysis showed that the high catalytic performance of the Pt/FNS-O catalyst (with Fe/Ni ratio of 2) was caused by the electronic interactions among the ternary compositions (NS, FS, and Pt)."
