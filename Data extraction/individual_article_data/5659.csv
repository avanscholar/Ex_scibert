0,Introduction,"Converting biomass into petrochemical commodities generally involves oxygen removal, and a number of thermal, biological, and catalytic processes are available for doing so. From this landscape of reductive technologies, we narrow our focus to the hydrogenation of carbonyl groups using molecular H2 to form their corresponding alcohols. This chemistry is an important component of many catalytic “hydrodeoxygenation” strategies; as such, carbonyl hydrogenation appears frequently in the preparation of bio-based fuels and chemicals. For example, γ-valerolactone is synthesized by hydrogenation of the ketone moiety in levulinic acid [1]; synthesis of long-chain linear alkanes from furfural or 5-hydroxymethylfurfural condensation products requires ketone hydrogenation [2,3]; furfuryl alcohol is prepared by reducing the aldehyde group in furfural [4–8]; and production of sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol or mannitol) from their corresponding aldo- or keto- sugars (e.g., glucose or fructose) occurs through carbonyl hydrogenation [9–13]. Commonly, supported metals are used for the aforementioned, and Ru, Pt, Pd, Ni, and Cu have been used for both gas- and liquid-phase processes [7,8,14–20]. Studies of carbonyl hydrogenation have highlighted many interesting macroscale phenomena. Observed rates and selectivities are sensitive to the nature, structure, and provenance of the metal catalyst [21–23]; the nature and structure of the support [24]; the identity of the carbonyl compound subjected to hydrogenation [25,26]; and the nature and composition of the bulk gas- or liquid-phase [27–31]. Our group is interested in understanding the fundamental origins of these phenomena. To this end, we recently reported a microkinetic analysis of gas-phase ketone hydrogenation on supported Ru catalysts [25]. Consistent with prior reports, this study revealed that the most likely rate controlling step during ketone hydrogenation on Ru is the addition of a hydrogen adatom to a partially hydrogenated surface intermediate [28,30], which is generally thought to be an alkoxy [32–37]. We used data reconciliation and parameter estimation to quantify elementary reaction and activation free energies, which enabled prediction of turnover frequencies and reactor performance at any temperature, pressure, and system composition. Our prior work therefore established baseline expectations for the relatively facile and thermodynamically ideal case of gas-phase ketone hydrogenation over Ru [25]. Relative to this point, we are able to interpret impacts of the many possible perturbations to the carbonyl hydrogenation system. One interesting observation is that Ru is sensitive to solvent effects [27,28] and is particularly well-suited to aqueous-phase carbonyl hydrogenation [31], whereas Pt is weakly influenced by solvents [38] and reportedly offers better performance in the gas phase [30,39]. Toward the aim of elucidating the fundamental underpinnings of observed differences between Pt and Ru, we focus this manuscript on a rigorous microkinetic analysis for acetone hydrogenation in the gas phase over Pt/SiO2. This is a foundational study that is intended to facilitate a direct comparison with our prior microkinetic analysis of gas-phase ketone hydrogenation over Ru/SiO2. This will require an in-depth, concerted analysis of the two systems that extends beyond the scope of the present work and will comprise a separate manuscript. On metal surfaces, reduction of ketones using molecular hydrogen is thought to proceed through a Horiuti-Polanyi-type mechanism [40]. Specifically, metal surfaces bind the ketone, dissociate molecular hydrogen, and facilitate sequential addition of adsorbed hydrogen atoms to adsorbed ketones to form the surface-bound alcohol. Though there is consensus on this conceptual view, specific site requirements and rate controlling phenomena remain unclear [25,41–43]. Prior analyses of ketone hydrogenation and alcohol dehydrogenation over Pt have considered two distinct mechanisms [41–43], which are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The first involves a single type of surface site (Scheme A) and the second involves two distinct surface sites (Scheme B). In both schemes, we represent gas-phase acetone, molecular hydrogen, and isopropanol as ACE, H2, and IPOH, while H represents atomic hydrogen. Acetone is assumed to bind molecularly (Step 1), while H2 adsorbs dissociatively (Step 2). Hydrogen atoms then add sequentially to surface acetone and the partially hydrogenated intermediate (Step 3 and Step 4). This forms surface isopropanol, which desorbs to form the gas phase product (Step 5). Results from both surface science and computational analysis suggest that the partially hydrogenated intermediate on Pt surfaces is an isopropoxy fragment, which is bound atop a Pt atom via its oxygen [37,44]. We label it accordingly (IPOX). Distinct vacant sites are represented as “*” and “s,” and subscripts on surface-bound species designate the type of site where they adsorb. The sole difference between the two mechanisms is that the single-site model considers that atomic hydrogen and all surface hydrocarbons compete for adsorption at a single type of active site [42], while the two-site model allows hydrocarbons and hydrogen atoms to bind at different surface sites [41,43]. Previously, we showed good agreement between a two-site mechanism and measured ketone hydrogenation rates over Ru, and we rationalized a two-site mechanism based on the idea that atomic hydrogen will generally bind in three-fold hollow sites on Ru, whereas larger adsorbates are frequently observed in atop or bridged configurations [25]. The same rationale stands for Pt, and, because there has been no definitive resolution within the field, we consider both mechanisms here. In particular, we develop microkinetic models that describe acetone hydrogenation using single-site and two-site mechanisms. In order to identify the most likely mechanism and rate controlling step(s), we attempt to reconcile each mechanism with experimentally measured rates of acetone hydrogenation, as well as observed barriers, reaction orders, and kinetic isotope effects during H2/D2 switching experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods Hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid hydrate (37.5% Pt, Acros Organics) and amorphous SiO2 (481 m2/g, Sigma Aldrich) were used for catalyst preparation. Acetone (99+%, Acros Organics) and isopropyl alcohol (reagent grade, Acros Organics) were used as reactor feeds and for instrument calibration. H2 (99.999%, Airgas), He (99.999%, Airgas), N2 (99.999%, Airgas), and CO (99.99% Praxair) were employed for kinetic studies, catalyst pretreatment, and catalyst characterization. H2 and D2 blends (5% H2 or D2, 1% Ar, 94% He, Airgas) were used in probing kinetic isotope effects. Water used in preparation of catalysts was purified in house by reverse osmosis, UV oxidation, and ion exchange to a resistivity ≥18.2 MΩ cm."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis A Pt/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of amorphous SiO2 with aqueous hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid hydrate. We selected SiO2 because it has no strong acid, base, or redox functionality; and reference experiments confirmed it to be inert to all gas-phase species under our reaction conditions [25]. Our synthesis used an incipient volume of 1.6 ml of precursor solution per gram of support. Impregnated catalysts were dried overnight in air at 393 K and then reduced in flowing H2 (100 ml min−1, 673 K, 3 K min−1). Prior to removal from reduction cells, samples were passivated at 298 K in a stream of 1% O2 in He."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Catalyst surface area and average pore diameter were determined by N2 physisorption at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Before N2 dosing, samples were outgassed under vacuum (6 h, 523 K). Total surface areas and pore size distributions were obtained through BET and BJH analyses of the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm [45,46]. Pt surface site densities were quantified by CO chemisorption at 308 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) [47]. Prior to CO dosing, samples were reduced in flowing H2 (3 h, 673 K, 3 K min−1), evacuated at 673 K for 1 h to remove chemisorbed hydrogen, and cooled to 308 K under vacuum. The analysis was performed at 308 K by collecting a CO adsorption isotherm, evacuating the sample for 1 h to remove physisorbed CO, and collecting a second isotherm. Irreversible CO uptake was calculated as the difference in CO uptake between the first and second isotherms. Irreversibly bound CO was taken to be equivalent to the Pt surface site density, which assumes a CO:Pt adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1 [47]. Replicate chemisorption experiments on a single Pt/SiO2 catalyst indicate that this method is generally able to quantify CO uptake within ± 5%."
5,Catalytic activity testing,"2.4 Catalytic activity testing We performed acetone hydrogenation experiments in a downflow, packed bed reactor. The bed was comprised of an active phase (2.1 wt% Pt/SiO2, 45–90 μm) diluted 10:1 in amorphous SiO2 (45–90 μm). The mixture was loaded into a 6.35 mm OD 316 stainless steel tube, and the bed was held in place by quartz wool plugs. The void volume below the catalyst bed was packed with 850–2000 µm quartz granules. Reactor temperature was controlled at the outer wall of the packed bed using a Type K thermocouple and a PID temperature controller (LOVE 16A 3010). Kinetic data are reported at the bed temperature, which was measured by an in-line, Type K thermocouple positioned in the void space just above the catalyst bed. Prior to activity testing, the catalyst bed was reduced in situ under H2 flow (100 ml min−1) at 673 K for 4 h with a ramp rate of 5 K min−1. The bed was then cooled to the desired reaction temperature under H2. Gas-phase reactor feeds (He, H2, D2, various blends, etc.) were regulated using mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850S). Liquid feeds (acetone and isopropanol) were introduced using a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer series 100) and fed through a 130 µm PEEK capillary into a heated vaporization chamber where they were contacted with pre-heated gas feeds. The process stream then passed through a heat-traced static mixer, where it was brought to reaction temperature. During reactor startup, the feed stream was diverted through a bypass until reaching steady state composition, at which point the feed stream was introduced into the reactor. The time of valve switching was taken as zero time on stream. Reaction products were analyzed using an in-line Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a 6-port gas sampling valve, an HP-INNOWAX column, and a flame ionization detector. This configuration is sufficient to resolve and quantify all of the species considered in this study, and carbon balances closed to within ± 5%. Under conditions reported here, acetone hydrogenation over Pt/SiO2 is 100% selective to isopropanol, and ≈10 replicate experiments at a single reference condition indicate that our precision in quantifying isopropanol formation rates is ± 10%. Weight-hourly-space velocities were adjusted to maintain reactors at or below ≈10% acetone conversion, with 94% of acetone hydrogenation rates measured below 5% acetone conversion. Acetone hydrogenation is exothermic (ΔH° = −55.2 kJ mol−1), but it incurs a substantial entropy loss (ΔS° = −116.3 J mol−1 K−1); accordingly, it is important to consider experimental conversions in the context of the equilibrium limit under a given set of reaction conditions. This is particularly true at high reaction temperatures or low hydrogen partial pressures. The majority of our data (95%) were collected at or below fractional conversions and/or feed compositions where the reversibility, z [48], of the overall hydrogenation reaction (Eq. (1)) is less than 0.01. (1) z = a IPOH K · a ACE · a H 2 Increased proximity to equilibrium occurred at high reaction temperatures, low H2 pressures, and in the presence of isopropanol co-feeds. Specifically, during IPA co-feeding experiments, H2/D2 switching experiments, and H2 order studies at 420–440 K, we occasionally observed reversibilities above 0.01 and up to 0.05. Regardless, these values remain sufficiently displaced from chemical equilibrium that species production rates in all experiments are minimally influenced by the reverse reaction. Finally, reference experiments confirmed that, in our experimental range of acetone conversions, there is no strong product inhibition during acetone hydrogenation over Pt (See Online Supporting Information). Based on the above arguments, we conclude that the differential reactor approximation is reasonable, and, for the entirety of our analysis, we assume that hydrogenation rates are constant throughout the bed at feed conditions. In the interest of assessing intrinsic reactivity, hydrogenation rates are estimated on an active site basis as isopropanol site time yields (STY, Eq. (2)) [49]. FIPOH is the molar flowrate of isopropanol out of the packed bed (±10%), and SPt is the total molar quantity of Pt surface sites in the catalyst bed as estimated by CO chemisorption (±5%). Propagation of uncertainty suggests that site time yields are precise to within ± 15% in this system. (2) STY = F IPOH S Pt During reactor startup, effluent isopropanol flowrates decrease as a function of time on stream (see Online Supporting Information). This decline in activity occurs over time scales (1–2 h) that are significantly longer than the transient periods that we observe after making a perturbation in operating conditions at steady state (<10 min). We thus attribute this initial decline in activity to catalyst deactivation. Because we have employed an ex-situ method for surface site quantification (CO chemisorption), it is important to account for deactivation in specifying reaction rates. Active site densities estimated by CO chemisorption are representative of the catalyst as it exists before exposure to reactants; therefore, all reported site-time-yields reflect an extrapolation of hydrogenation rates to zero time-on stream. We obtained these estimates by fitting temporal deactivation profiles measured over the initial ≈ 2 h on stream to a first order deactivation model with an approach to a non-zero steady state rate. This approach is permissible because packed bed reactors were operated differentially over the entire deactivation profile and there is no strong product inhibition in our experimental conversion ranges [50]. The methodology is further detailed in the online supporting information."
6,Kinetic isotope effects,"2.5 Kinetic isotope effects We examined the kinetic impact of H2/D2 switching during acetone hydrogenation over Pt using the apparatus described in the preceding section. The system was permitted to reach steady state under a flow of 5% H2 in He; subsequently, the reducing gas was switched to 5% D2 in He, and the system was again permitted to reach steady state. Finally, the reducing gas was switched back to 5% H2 in He to quantify any perturbations to the baseline activity of the catalyst (e.g., deactivation or regeneration) induced by the switch. Under all conditions, the catalyst returned to its reference state activity within ≈ 10 min of the exchange, and we conclude that there was no appreciable deactivation or induction under D2 flow. Impacts of H2/D2 switching on acetone hydrogenation kinetics are inferred from site time yields of isopropanol under H2 and D2, which we use to establish an apparent kinetic isotope effect (KIEA) as defined by Eq. (3). (3) KI E A = ST Y H 2 ST Y D 2"
7,Electronic structure calculations,"2.6 Electronic structure calculations Where necessary, gas phase thermodynamic data were supplemented with results from simulations. Specifically, we used Gaussian’09 software to predict the standard state entropy and heat capacity of the gas-phase isopropoxy radical [51]. Geometry optimization and frequency calculations were performed using the Hartree-Fock method with a 6-311++g (3df, 3pd) basis set. Benchmarking simulations revealed that this level of theory is sufficient to predict reference state entropies and heat capacities for gas-phase acetone within ≈ 2% of tabulated values."
8,Data reconciliation and parameter estimation,"2.7 Data reconciliation and parameter estimation One of our primary methods of kinetic analysis is to determine whether a given kinetic model corresponding to a specified rate control scenario is able to reconcile with experimental observations with a physically realistic parameter set. Quantitatively, we assess this for each proposed kinetic model by solving the least squares problem, i.e., by determining the parameter values that minimize the objective function given in Eq. (4). (4) SSE = ∑ i = 1 n log 10 ST Y EX P i - log 10 ST Y MO D i 2 Here, the square error for any experiment, i, is defined by the difference between measured isopropanol site time yields at each experimental condition and the corresponding model prediction at the same experimental condition. Our experiments span large ranges of temperature and species partial pressures, and site time yields vary over several orders of magnitude. To provide a uniform weighting of all measurements and avoid bias toward preferential minimization of errors in large site time yields, all data were rescaled by taking their common logarithm [52]. This ensured that all of our measurements and model predictions range from approximately −2 to 1. The objective function (Eq. (4)) was minimized by varying parameter values using a trust-region reflective algorithm via the lsqnonlin routine in MATLAB. Analogous to the above described case of disparate scales in our measured hydrogenation rates, parameter estimates were passed to the optimization routine on a logarithmic scale, ensuring that all parameter values ranged from approximately −3 to 3. All of our kinetic models either have analytical solutions or require numerical solution of a small set of nonlinear algebraic equations; further, all of our data are collected under differential conditions. This avoids the need for iterative solution of stiff DAE systems, making our optimization routines computationally facile. We leverage this to increase the likelihood of locating global minima. Specifically, we performed an initial regression to identify an optimal parameter set and quantify a baseline minimum residual sum of squares. We then introduced random perturbations between 0 and ± 25% to each of the optimal parameter values, and we used the perturbed optimum set as the starting state for a second optimization. This process was continued until no further improvement in the value of the objective function was observed. We repeated this strategy for multiple, randomized starting parameter sets and found the optima to be robust and insensitive to the starting state of the model. Optimum parameter estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals. These were initially calculated for logarithmically-scaled parameters using the nlparci routine in MATLAB, which uses the set of residual errors and the Jacobian Matrix computed by lsqnonlin at the optimum parameter set. They were converted to the linear scale uncertainties reported in the manuscript using propagation of error analysis. A sample optimization routine, which is easily generalizable for kinetic analysis of other systems, is available for download in the online supporting information. The residual sum of squares (SSE) was used alongside the total sum of squares (SST, Eq. (5)) to compute the coefficient of determination (R2, Eq. (6)) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Eq. (7)) for each least squares solution [53]. Both are useful indicators of fit quality. Importantly, the AIC penalizes a regression for increasing variable parameter numbers, which helps to identify cases of over-fitting and to determine a statistically preferred model. (5) SST = ∑ i = 1 n log 10 ST Y EX P i - 1 n · ∑ i = 1 n log 10 ST Y EX P i 2 (6) R 2 = 1 - SSE SST (7) AIC = 2 · n k + n · ln SSE In Eqs. (5)–(7), n is the number of experimental measurements and nk is the number of parameters regressed in a given rate control scenario."
9,Results & discussion,
10,Catalyst synthesis & characterization,3.1 Catalyst synthesis & characterization Data were obtained using a Pt/SiO2 catalyst that had a total metal loading of 2.1 wt%. Physicochemical properties of this catalyst and its parent SiO2 support are summarized in Table 1 .
11,Demonstrating kinetic control,"3.2 Demonstrating kinetic control One can assess the extent of diffusion control using experimental tests, such as those described by Madon and Boudart [54], or by comparing rates of reaction to rates of diffusion as formalized in the Weisz-Prater criterion (Eq. (8)) [55]. Here, robs is the observed reaction rate per unit volume of catalyst, Rp is the radius of the catalyst particle, Dj is the effective diffusivity of the reacting species in the catalyst pores, and Cj is the concentration of species j at the external surface of the catalyst. (8) ϕ = r obs · R p 2 D j · C j Previously, we studied the gas-phase hydrogenation of acetone over a 1.5 wt% Ru/SiO2 catalyst (45–90 μm) with a surface site density of 62 μmol g−1, and we probed the influence of mass transfer using a Madon-Boudart test [25,54]. Ultimately, we demonstrated that kinetic control is maintained over Ru/SiO2 for acetone hydrogenation rates up to 2850 μmol g−1 min−1 (pA = 4.8 Torr, pH2 = 910 Torr, T = 341 K). Assuming a bulk catalyst density of 1.2 g mL−1, a particle diameter of 90 μm, an effective diffusivity of 1.0 × 10−6 m2 sec −1, and that acetone diffusion is more likely limiting than H2 diffusion, we estimate the value of the Weisz-Prater criterion to be ≈ 0.51 at these conditions. Threshold values for the Weisz Prater criterion are dependent on reaction orders, with the likelihood of diffusion control increasing for higher order reactions [56]. For Ru/SiO2, macroscopically observed reaction orders in hydrogen and acetone are between 0 and 1 [25]. This implies that the kinetic control threshold of the Weisz-Prater criterion for acetone hydrogenation is between 1 (first order reaction) and 6 (zero order reaction). Our estimated value of 0.51 can therefore be taken to indicate a kinetically-controlled hydrogenation rate; however, considering the uncertainty in estimating the Weisz-Prater criterion, this number is sufficiently close to the threshold range to raise concern. Here we emphasize two points. First, kinetic control at this condition was rigorously demonstrated using an experimental Madon-Boudart test, which is generally a more reliable assessment of kinetic control than estimated values of the Weisz-Prater criterion. Second, these represent the most demanding conditions with respect to mass transfer limitations in the prior study, i.e., those that had the largest ratio of reaction rate to acetone concentration. All hydrogenation rates measured over Ru/SiO2 were obtained at or below this threshold, allowing us to infer kinetic control for the entire data set. In the current study, we consider gas-phase acetone hydrogenation over a 2.1 wt% Pt/SiO2 catalyst (45–90 μm) that has a surface site density of 52 μmol g−1. This catalyst used an identical SiO2 support and sieve fraction to the previously discussed Ru/SiO2 catalyst; accordingly, surface area, porosity, and (bulk) particle sizes are comparable between the two materials. The most demanding condition for kinetic control in the current study was a measured rate of acetone hydrogenation of 313 μmol g−1 min−1 at an acetone partial pressure of 1.23 Torr (pH2 = 926 Torr, T = 416 K). We estimate the value of the Weisz-Prater criterion to be roughly 0.26 at this condition, which is the maximum value for the current data set. This is roughly half of the value of 0.51 estimated at the kinetic control threshold over Ru/SiO2. We are thus confident in concluding that all hydrogenation rates reported here over Pt/SiO2 are kinetically controlled. As a final note, reported rates and reactant concentrations in this manuscript often result in Weisz-Prater numbers that exceed the aforementioned kinetic control thresholds. We emphasize that reported rates represent zero-time corrections to measured rates. The latter were obtained over deactivated catalysts under clear kinetically-controlled regimes (WP < 0.26) and subsequently corrected to zero time on stream to provide a common basis for comparison."
12,Experimentally measured rates of acetone hydrogenation,"3.3 Experimentally measured rates of acetone hydrogenation Our kinetic data set is comprised of 185 isopropanol site time yields measured over a range of reaction temperatures and feed partial pressures. It is available for download as a CSV file in the supplementary online materials. Our intent is to provide a transparent, reliable, and comprehensive experimental kinetic benchmark for acetone hydrogenation on supported Pt catalysts, and we hope this data will be useful to others that are interested in fundamental aspects of ketone hydrogenation. Our final conclusions in this manuscript are drawn from reconciliation of kinetic models with experimental data, and we must acknowledge that this can provide only partial resolution of observed phenomena. Complementary insights from future efforts in surface science, in situ or operando spectroscopy, data science, and/or computational catalysis will help to broaden our understanding of ketone hydrogenation. We hope that by making our data accessible, we can help to bridge otherwise independent efforts in these areas. This data set excludes H2/D2 switching and isopropanol co-feeding experiments as these measurements were obtained under steady state conditions without recording the preceding deactivation profile. We are therefore not confident in our ability to precisely estimate zero-time reaction rates for these experiments. For this reason, we only discuss perturbations to steady state reaction rates upon H2/D2 switching (apparent kinetic isotope effects) or introducing an isopropanol co-feed (apparent reaction orders in isopropanol)."
13,The temperature dependence of acetone hydrogenation on Pt/SiO2,"3.4 The temperature dependence of acetone hydrogenation on Pt/SiO2 Fig. 2 illustrates acetone hydrogenation rates over Pt/SiO2 measured between 322 K and 421 K at various acetone partial pressures. In general, one observes nonlinearity over the entire temperature range. This indicates that apparent barriers are a strong function of temperature; accordingly, it is not possible to quantify a single barrier that describes acetone hydrogenation on Pt. That said, subsets of the data are linear, and we can discuss trends in apparent barriers over different temperature and partial pressure ranges. The most notable feature is that apparent barriers decrease as a function of temperature; further, the onset temperature and magnitude of this decrease are functions of acetone partial pressure. For example, acetone hydrogenation rates measured between 322 K and 381 K at 4.0 Torr acetone suggest an apparent barrier of 33 ± 6 kJ mol−1 whereas between 381 K and 421 K at the same acetone pressure, we observe that the apparent barrier decreases to 11 ± 8 kJ mol−1. These transitions become less pronounced at high acetone partial pressures and more pronounced at low acetone partial pressures. At 21 Torr acetone, the entire trend shows reasonable linearity and can be well-described by an apparent barrier of approximately 34 kJ mol−1. In contrast, apparent barriers become near-zero (1.4 Torr acetone) or even slightly negative (0.3 Torr) as temperatures exceed 381 K. These observations are most likely attributable to differences in surface coverage under various operating conditions. In general, one expects high surface coverages at low temperatures and elevated partial pressures. Catalysts studied at these conditions tend to display saturation kinetics, where heats of chemisorption largely cancel from observed rate constants, and apparent barriers reflect the elementary barrier for the rate determining step. At lower acetone partial pressures and/or higher reaction temperatures, surfaces become sparsely covered, and reaction rates are often positive order in the reactants. In these regimes, apparent barriers reflect a weighted sum of the endothermic barrier for the rate determining step and exothermic heats of adsorption, and they are often substantially diminished relative to elementary barriers. Similar observations and analyses have been applied for acetone hydrogenation over Ru/SiO2 [25], levulinic acid hydrogenation over Ru [14], and isopropanol dehydrogenation over Pt-Cu [57]. Further, apparent barriers in the range of 40–70 kJ mol−1 have been previously reported for acetone hydrogenation over Pt. Relative to our conditions, prior studies have considered acetone hydrogenation at low temperatures (300–370 K) and high acetone partial pressures (50–300 Torr) [41–43]. These conditions roughly align with our posited “saturation” conditions (e.g., 21 Torr Acetone), where we observe comparable barriers in the range of 30–40 kJ mol−1."
14,Apparent reaction orders,"3.5 Apparent reaction orders Apparent reaction orders for acetone, hydrogen, and isopropanol were determined at multiple temperatures by linear regression of hydrogenation rates as a function of species partial pressures on logarithmic scales (Figs. S2 and S6). We observe linearity over the measured partial pressure ranges at each reaction temperature, and apparent reaction orders are summarized in Table 2 . At 322 K, acetone hydrogenation has an apparent 0.06 ± 0.14 order in acetone, which increases to 0.33 ± 0.09 at 381 K and 0.45 ± 0.14 at 421 K. With respect to hydrogen, we observe a reaction order of 0.42 ± 0.02 at 322 K, which increases to 0.60 ± 0.16 at 381 K and 0.81 ± 0.02 at 421 K. Increases in apparent reaction orders are likely associated with a transition from saturated surfaces to sparsely covered surfaces with increasing reaction temperature. This is consistent with our observed decreases in apparent barrier as temperatures increase and partial pressures decrease. To probe the extent of product inhibition, we introduced isopropanol as a co-feed alongside acetone and H2. For these experiments, isopropanol partial pressures ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 Torr (pACE = 4.4 Torr, pH2 = 830 Torr, pIPOH:pACE = 0.02–0.25). These conditions simulate the impact of increasing isopropanol-to-acetone ratios, i.e., conditions where one is most likely to observe competitive inhibition by isopropanol. In the complete kinetic data set, our maximum measured isopropanol:acetone partial pressure ratio at the reactor exit was ≈ 0.1, which is within the span of this experiment. Independent of reaction temperature, we find that acetone hydrogenation is roughly zero order in isopropanol. Specifically, we observe apparent reaction orders in IPA of −0.14 ± 0.26 at 322 K, −0.13 ± 0.23 at 381 K, and −0.06 ± 0.21 at 422 K. The lack of temperature sensitivity in these apparent reaction orders suggests a sparse IPA coverage at all reaction temperatures."
15,Analysis of apparent reaction orders,"3.6 Analysis of apparent reaction orders Over the range of experimental conditions summarized in Table 2, acetone orders vary between 0 and 0.5, hydrogen orders vary between 0.5 and 1, and isopropanol orders are near zero. We next consider whether various Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate expressions can reconcile with our observations. Specifically, we develop overall rate expressions as a function of acetone, hydrogen, and isopropanol partial pressures in the limit where there is a single rate determining step (RDS) relative to which all others are equilibrated. We assume that each elementary step in Fig. 1 may be rate determining, which results in ten rate expressions. These are fully derived in the supporting information (Section S6). The SI also presents a limit analysis for each rate expression, which establishes permissible reaction orders in acetone, hydrogen, and isopropanol for each rate control scenario. Results are summarized in Table 3 . A macroscopic reaction rate in an adsorption-limited regime will always be first order in the (rate-limiting) adsorbate. Because we observe zero- or fractional orders in both acetone and H2 under all reaction conditions, one can exclude dissociative hydrogen adsorption (Step 1) and molecular adsorption of acetone (Step 2) in both the single-site and two-site mechanisms as rate controlling steps during acetone hydrogenation on Pt. Otherwise, depending on the dominant coverage regime, any of the remaining steps in either the single- or the two-site mechanism can be consistent with our observed reaction orders. A definitive resolution is not possible without invoking assumptions about dominant surface species, and we next consider observed kinetic isotope effects."
16,Kinetic isotope effects induced by H2/D2 switching,"3.7 Kinetic isotope effects induced by H2/D2 switching To further probe rate controlling phenomena, we performed H2/D2 switching experiments during acetone hydrogenation over Pt/SiO2. Impacts are presented as function of time on stream in Fig. 3 ; the corresponding apparent kinetic isotope effects (Eq. (3)) are summarized in Table 4 . At 322 K, the observed KIE is minor (1.17 ± 0.04), and it diminishes as reaction temperature increases to 378 K (1.04 ± 0.01) and 416 K (1.05 ± 0.03). These observations are within range of those previously reported by Baiker (KIEA ≈ 1.3) during liquid-phase trifluoroacetophenone hydrogenation over a supported Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at 298 K, 0.2–1.0 M trifluoroacetophenone in toluene, and pH2 = 5 bar [58]. Kinetic isotope effects of 1.0–1.2 are small relative to the 2- to 6-fold changes in rate constant that are expected when replacing hydrogen with deuterium in an elementary reaction that involves either scission or formation of an H-X bond (i.e., a primary kinetic isotope effect). Instead, our observations fall into the range expected for secondary isotope effects. This suggests that the formation or scission of an H-X bond cannot be rate controlling, leaving only acetone adsorption and isopropanol desorption as possible rate determining steps. In the preceding section, we excluded acetone adsorption as a rate controlling step because our maximum observed acetone order is ≈ 0.5, whereas a system limited by acetone adsorption should be first order in acetone. This leads to the tentative conclusion that acetone hydrogenation is limited by isopropanol desorption under our experimental conditions; however, we temper this by noting that the aforementioned magnitudes of primary and secondary kinetic isotope effects apply to true kinetic isotope effects, which reflect perturbations to elementary rate constants induced by changes in isotopic mass. Here, we report apparent kinetic isotope effects, which reflect perturbations in the overall hydrogenation rate induced by a change in isotopic mass. Whereas a true kinetic isotope effect represents a single elementary kinetic impact, apparent kinetic isotope effects may reflect a convolution of multiple elementary kinetic and thermodynamic impacts, and their observable value may depend on surface coverages under reaction conditions [59–63]. A rigorous interpretation of the apparent kinetic isotope effect is therefore non-trivial, and we are cautious in excluding surface reactions as kinetically significant based on apparent KIEs alone. We will defer further consideration until after a more detailed and quantitative kinetic analysis of our data set."
17,Microkinetic analysis,"3.8 Microkinetic analysis To this point, our discussion has been qualitative and based upon permissible reaction orders and anticipated kinetic isotope effects upon switching the reducing gas from H2 to D2. Next, we take a quantitative, statistical approach by attempting to reconcile experimental observations with predictions from microkinetic models developed for single-site and two-site mechanisms (Fig. 1). At the outset, each model is fully parameterized using published data and correlations, which enables base-case estimation of rate constants and equilibrium constants at any temperature. Subsequently, we apply limiting assumptions that facilitate prediction of macroscopic rates of acetone hydrogenation as a function of temperature, pressure, and system composition within a specific rate control scenario. We then regress the full set of potentially sensitive parameters in each rate control scenario by minimizing the objective function given by Eq. (4). This generates an optimal parameter set as well as a minimum residual sum of squares (SSE), which is used to compute the corresponding coefficient of determination (Eq. (6)) and Akaike Information Criterion value (Eq. (7)). Our rationale for regressing all potentially sensitive parameters instead of the initially sensitive parameter set is twofold. First, we are always working with small sets of potentially sensitive parameters (nk ≤ 6) relative to the number of measurements (n = 185), which increases the likelihood that we can regress each parameter with confidence. Second, the initial state of the model is generally far from an optimum, and parameters that are initially insensitive often become sensitive as the parameter set is allowed to change during optimization. To increase confidence that least squares solutions identify global optima, we regress the full set of parameters that are potentially sensitive in each rate control scenario. 3.8.1 Thermodynamic consistency A microkinetic model must satisfy two thermodynamic constraints [56]. First, as expressed in Eq. (9), any thermodynamic state function, Γ, that describes the formation of isopropanol from acetone and molecular hydrogen in the gas phase must equal the value of that state function computed by the sum of changes in state function for each elementary step (ΔΓi) weighted by their stoichiometric numbers (σi). (9) 0 = Γ IPOH , g - Γ ACE , g - Γ H 2 , g - ∑ i σ i · Δ Γ i Second, rate laws for each elementary step, i, must satisfy microscopic reversibility. This constraint is easily implemented by developing the rate expression for step i as a function of the forward rate constant for that step (ki ), the equilibrium constant for that step (Ki ), the thermodynamic activities of species participating in that step (a j), and the stoichiometric coefficients of species participating in that step (ν j ). (10) r i = k i · ∏ reactants a j ν i , j - k i K i · ∏ products a j ν i , j Rate and equilibrium constants are defined in Eqs. (11)–(13) using standard conventions. Euler’s number appears in the pre-exponential factor, Ai , because we use an Arrhenius formulation in Eq. (11), and we distinguish between the activation barrier (EA,i ) and the enthalpy of activation (ΔHi ‡). Specifically, EA,i = ΔHi ‡ + RT [64]. (11) k i = A i · exp - E A , i RT (12) A i = e k B T h exp Δ S i ‡ R (13) K i = exp Δ S i R · exp - Δ H i RT Using the above parameterization, solution of the microkinetic model requires a complete definition of entropic and enthalpic changes of reaction (ΔSi, ΔHi ) and activation (ΔSi ‡ , EA,i) for each elementary step. Our approach for doing so is specified in the following sections. We note that initial estimates for single-site and two-site mechanisms are identical because the nature of each elementary step and the species involved therein do not change between the two mechanisms; they only differ as to whether or not hydrogen atoms and organic species compete for adsorption at a single type of active site or if they bind at distinct types of active sites. 3.8.2 Thermodynamics of elementary reactions We rigorously apply the constraint specified in Eq. (9) by defining thermodynamic state functions for all surface species relative to their gas phase values. Relevant gas-phase thermodynamic properties include enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities; they are summarized for all reactants, intermediates, and products as pure, gas-phase species at 1 bar and 298 K (Table 5 ). Data for H2, ACE, IPOH, and atomic hydrogen (H) are taken from existing databases. The enthalpy of formation for a gas-phase isopropoxy radical was computed from the enthalpy of formation of isopropanol, the enthalpy of formation for a hydrogen atom, and the homolytic bond dissociation energy (BDE) of O–H, which is 443 kJ mol−1. (14) H IPOX = H IPOH + B D E OH - H H The entropy and heat capacity for gas-phase isopropoxy at 298 K were estimated using Gaussian 09 software [51]. Enthalpies and entropies for each gas-phase species are adjusted to reaction temperature using Eqs. (15) and (16). We assume that heat capacities are temperature-independent in our experimental range (303–435 K). (15) H j T = H j ° + C p j T - T ° (16) S j T = S j ° + C P j · ln T T ° Enthalpies for surface-bound species are calculated by subtracting the binding energy for that species from its gas-phase enthalpy at a given temperature. We assume that the binding energy (BE) for a given species (j) at a given surface site (x) is not a function of temperature or coverage. (17) H j , x T = H j T - B E j , x Initial binding energy estimates are taken from the surface science literature; however, these generally reflect bound species on well-defined model surfaces at low coverage, and this may be a poor approximation for adsorption enthalpies on technical catalysts under working conditions. Accordingly, we view species binding energies as uncertain and potentially variable parameters that may be estimated via regression. One’s ability to regress a binding energy for a gas-phase species relies on data being collected over a large range of partial pressures, coverage regimes, and/or reaction orders for the adsorbing species. We satisfy these criteria for H2 and acetone, but our reactors always operate at low conversion and thus low isopropanol pressures. Further, our analyses always apply the differential reactor approximation, i.e., we assume that reaction rates are constant and defined by the reactor inlet conditions, where isopropanol partial pressures are zero. We are thus not confident in our ability to regress a binding energy for isopropanol, and we define the isopropanol binding energy as an explicit function of the acetone binding energy based on trends observed during surface science experiments. Specifically, on a Pt(1 1 1) surface, Vannice has reported binding energies of 48.1 [65] and 55.2 [66] kJ mol−1 for acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Similarly, Sexton reported binding energies of 46.2 [67] and 52.7 [68] kJ mol−1 for acetone and isopropanol. Finally, Avery reported the binding energy of acetone on Pt(1 1 1) to be 48.5 kJ mol−1 [69]. Based on these observations, our initial estimate of the acetone binding energy is 49 kJ mol−1, and our microkinetic model constrains the isopropanol binding energy to be 110% of the acetone binding energy. We estimate the binding energy of an isopropoxy species (190 kJ mol−1) from that of methoxy on Pt (1 1 1) [70]. We account for the additional Van der Waals stabilization provided by the longer carbon chain of isopropoxy using the correlation given by Sexton (5.4 kJ mol−1 per carbon in longest side chain) [68]. Initial Binding Energy estimates, enthalpies of adsorbed species at 298 K, and reference sources are summarized in Table 6 . Next, we consider estimation of entropies for surface species. In prior microkinetic analysis, we assumed that bound species lose all translational entropy upon adsorption [52]. Although this approach can provide a reasonable data fit [72], recent studies by Árnadóttir [73], Schneider [74], and Iglesia [75] indicate that surface species retain a significantly larger fraction of their gas-phase entropies than allowed by our previous assumptions. Campbell reported similar observations from calorimetry data, and he developed a useful correlation for estimating surface entropies for molecular adsorbates (e.g., hexane, ethanol, etc.) as a function of their gas phase entropies [76]. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether these correlations extend to molecular fragments, such as the alkoxy and atomic hydrogen intermediates that form on the surface during acetone hydrogenation, and we are hesitant to apply them universally in our analysis. A specific concern is that radical species bind strongly relative to molecular analogs [77], and one might expect their mobility to scale accordingly, i.e., strongly-bound species should be less likely to diffuse across a surface, whereas a weakly-bound molecular adsorbate might have relatively unconstrained translational mobility in two dimensions. Eq. (18)–(24) summarize our approach for building this rationale into the calculation of surface entropies for species formed during acetone hydrogenation. First, we assume that surface species lose all of their gas-phase translational mobility and thus their translational entropy; however, they retain their gas-phase “local” entropy, which is comprised of all gas-phase rotational and vibrational modes [72,78]. (18) S j , L O C = S j - S j , T R A N 3 D - S j , E L E C For gas phase species, the total (3D) translational entropy is computed as a function of atomic mass (mj ) at the reaction temperature (T) and 1 bar reference pressure (P0). (19) S j , T R A N 3 D = R · ln 2 π m j k B T h 2 3 2 · k B T P 0 + 5 2 Electronic entropy is a function of the degeneracy of the electronic ground state (gj ). Acetone, isopropanol, and dihydrogen have a degeneracy of 1, while atomic hydrogen and isopropoxy have an unpaired electron and a degeneracy of 2. Electronic entropy contributes little to the total entropy of gas phase species in this system (Eq. (20)), and its inclusion in the local entropy calculation does not substantially change our results. Regardless, we consider it in our calculations to explicitly acknowledge differences in entropy contributions between gas-phase species with unpaired electrons and their surface counterparts. (20) S j , E L E C = R · ln g j The three translational degrees of freedom lost upon adsorption are treated as new vibrational modes [79]. One is normal to the metal surface, and it reflects the vibrational frequency of the Pt-adsorbate bond. We assume that this frequency is relatively high such that it contributes little entropy to the bound adsorbate [75], and we exclude it from consideration. The remaining two modes comprise hindered translations and are treated as surface diffusions in the xy plane. For large and/or weakly bound species, these should be very low frequency modes that contribute significantly to the total entropy of the adsorbate. To quantify these vibrational frequencies, we employ a correlation reported by Mavrikakis and Dumesic, which defines them as a function of the diffusion barrier as shown in Eq. (21) [79]. Per Mavrikakis, we estimate the diffusion barrier for species j to be 12% of its binding energy [80]. (21) ν j , D I F F = 0.12 · B E j 2 l 2 m j To give a frequency in Hz, the binding energy for each species (BEj ) reflects that of a single molecule and is expressed in Joules, the unit cell edge length (l) is given in m, and the mass of each species (mj ) is that of a single molecule expressed in kg. We assume the unit cell edge length for Pt is 3.0 × 10−10 m. We then use this frequency to compute the vibrational entropy associated with each diffusion mode. (22) S j , D I F F , 1 D = R · X j exp ( X j ) - 1 - ln 1 - exp - X j (23) X j = h ν j , D I F F k B T Once the diffusional entropy is estimated for an adsorbate in a single dimension, the total entropy of the bound species is given by Eq. (24). (24) S j , x = S j , L O C + 2 · S j , D I F F , 1 D An important aspect of this approach is that it provides a framework for computing surface entropies as an explicit function of gas-phase entropies and species binding energies. This allows one to estimate differences in surface mobility between strongly and weakly bound adsorbates without introducing additional variable parameters into the microkinetic model. We summarize the quantities used to evaluate the above equations alongside surface entropies for bound species at 298 K in Table 7 . Though this method invokes many approximations, it results in a surface entropy for atomic hydrogen that is consistent with prior kinetic analyses on Pt, Ru, Cu, and Fe [57,81–87]. Further, it yields surface entropies for acetone, isopropoxy, and isopropanol that are comparable to those estimated using Campbell’s empirical correlation [76]. The exception (relative to Campbell’s method) is that, by virtue of isopropoxy’s large binding energy compared to acetone and isopropanol, it has a lower surface entropy than either of the molecular adsorbates (see Table 7). This approach uses the harmonic oscillator approximation to estimate the entropy associated with hindered translations in two dimensions, and the accuracy of that assumption is a matter of current debate. For example, multiple studies suggest that the harmonic oscillator approximation will, in certain cases, under-predict entropic contributions from translational motion of surface species [73–75]. Árnadóttir has considered the topic in detail, ultimately suggesting that one can estimate the threshold of validity for the harmonic oscillator approximation by comparing the diffusion barrier to the temperature where adsorption is considered. If the diffusion barrier for an adsorbate significantly exceeds kT, then the translational mobility of that adsorbate can be represented as low frequency vibrational modes within the harmonic oscillator approximation. Taking surface science binding energies (Table 6) as a starting point; using the estimate that diffusion barriers are approximately 12% of the binding energy [80]; and considering that our maximum reaction temperature in this study was approximately 430 K, we estimate that the diffusion barrier for the most weakly bound species in this system—acetone—will exceed kT by a factor of ≈1.6 at our highest reaction temperature. This suggests the harmonic oscillator approximation is adequate for quantifying entropic contributions from hindered translations for acetone, even at our highest reaction temperature. Because acetone binding at 430 K represents the smallest multiple of kT in our system, we conclude that a universal application of this method is reasonable in our analysis. The thermodynamic approximations detailed above allow complete quantification of enthalpies and entropies for all gas-phase and surface species at any reaction temperature. This is sufficient to calculate enthalpies of reaction, entropies of reaction, free energies of reaction, and equilibrium constants for each elementary step summarized in Fig. 1, i.e., it comprises a full initial thermodynamic parameterization of the microkinetic model. Importantly, using the correlations and conventions described above, the variable set of thermodynamic parameters are restricted to three binding energies—acetone, the hydrogen atom, and the isopropoxy radical. 3.8.3 Kinetics of elementary reactions Rate constants for each elementary step are defined in terms of two elementary parameters: the entropy of activation and the activation barrier (Eq. (11) and Eq. (12)). Molecular adsorption steps (1 and 5) are assumed to be non-activated. Barriers for bond-breaking and bond-forming steps are estimated using UBI-QEP correlations [77], which define the activation barrier for an elementary step as a function of its reaction enthalpy and the binding energies of species participating in that step. This allows one to estimate elementary activation barriers without adding variable parameters to the microkinetic model. In Table 8 , UBI-QEP expressions are summarized for relevant steps alongside their estimated barriers, which are based on initial binding energies; all are generally reasonable in light of prior DFT and/or microkinetic analyses [37,88]. For example, Alcalá has reported DFT barriers of 61 kJ mol−1 and 18 kJ mol−1 for Steps 3 and 4 (respectively) during acetone hydrogenation on a Pt(1 1 1) surface [37]. Bearing in mind the anticipated minimum precision of DFT barriers (≈0.1 ev), these numbers are in excellent agreement with those derived here using surface science binding energies and UBI-QEP correlations. Eq. (25) illustrates the method used for estimating activation entropies for gas adsorption steps (1, 2, and 5). We equated the pre-exponential factor given by collision theory with that derived from transition state theory to solve for the activation entropy [56]. The calculation was performed at 298 K and a reference pressure (P0) of 1 bar. We have assumed the cross sectional area of a surface site (Ac ) is 1.5 × 10−19 m2. We additionally assume a sticking coefficient (Sc ) of 1.0 for molecular adsorption of acetone and isopropanol and a sticking coefficient of 0.08 for dissociative adsorption of hydrogen [89]. These assumptions result in activation entropies for gas adsorption that are on the order of −100 J mol−1 K−1 and adsorption pre-exponential factors of roughly 108 sec−1. Both align with expectations [56]. (25) Δ S i , A D S ‡ = R · ln h e · k B T · A c P 0 S c 2 π m j k B T We initially estimate that activation entropies for the two surface reactions (Steps 3 and 4) are −50 J mol−1 K−1. This results in pre-exponential factors of roughly 1010 s−1, which are reasonable for bimolecular surface reactions [90]. We are unaware of any correlations that allow one to couple activation entropies to binding energies, so we take activation entropies as potentially variable parameters that may be estimated through regression analysis. Initial activation entropies, alongside their corresponding pre-exponential factors are summarized in Table 9 . 3.8.4 Data reconciliation The above sections describe the initial kinetic and thermodynamic parameterization of microkinetic models that reflect acetone hydrogenation in both single- and two-site mechanisms. We next apply limiting assumptions to develop 16 models that describe macroscopic isopropanol site time yields as a function of temperature, pressure, and species composition in various rate control scenarios. A detailed explanation of the assumptions that underlie each scenario is presented alongside the derivation of overall rate expressions in the online supporting information. Each model is developed in terms of a maximum of eight uncertain and potentially variable parameters: binding energies for acetone, atomic hydrogen, and the isopropoxy radical (isopropanol binding energies are developed as an explicit function of acetone binding energies), as well as activation entropies for each of the five elementary steps. In general, we regress all three binding energies and the activation entropy for any rate constant appearing in the overall rate expression. Where steps are assumed to be equilibrated, the model is insensitive to their activation entropies; thus, they cannot be regressed with any precision, and they are excluded from parameter estimation. Results of regression analysis are summarized in Table 10 and illustrated in Fig. 4 . Considering the single-site model, we observe relatively poor fits (R2 < 0.90) for solutions that attribute rate control to H2 dissociation (Case 1), acetone adsorption (Case 2), addition of atomic hydrogen to surface acetone (Case 3), and addition of atomic hydrogen to surface isopropoxy (Case 4). For the single-site model, the only single RDS scenario that provides a reasonable fit to data (R2 > 0.9) is the one limited by isopropanol desorption (Case 5). Case 6 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to surface isopropoxy and further assumes that all adsorption steps are equilibrated. This relaxes the constraint that a single step is rate controlling and allows the possibility that both surface reactions are kinetically significant. We therefore regress activation entropies for both of these steps, increasing the total number of variable parameters to five. Despite this, the fit remains poor (R2 = 0.858), and we observe only a modest improvement in residual error relative to Cases 3 and 4, both of which correspond to full rate control by a single surface reaction. Case 7 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to surface isopropanol and assumes that steps 1, 2, and 3 are equilibrated. This allows the possibility that the second surface reaction and isopropanol desorption are both kinetically significant. For this case, we regressed activation entropies for steps 4 and 5 (5 total parameters); however, the optimal parameter set predicts that the rate of hydrogenation is fully controlled by isopropanol desorption, and we observe no improvement over the desorption-limited solution (Case 5). Finally, Case 8 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to both surface isopropoxy and surface isopropanol, and it assumes that acetone and hydrogen adsorption (Steps 1 and 2) are equilibrated. This allows that both surface reactions and isopropanol desorption can be kinetically significant (6 parameters). Despite this relatively flexible scenario, we were unable to find an optimum that improved upon the minimum residual relative to Cases 5 and 7. For the single-site mechanism, Case 5, which assumes that isopropanol desorption fully controls the rate of acetone hydrogenation, achieves the minimum AIC value and represents the statistically preferred rate control scenario. Considering the two-site mechanism, we observe poor fits for models that ascribe rate control to H2 dissociation (Case 9) and acetone adsorption (Case 10). Otherwise, addition of atomic hydrogen to surface acetone (Case 11), addition of atomic hydrogen to surface isopropoxy (Case 12), and desorption of isopropanol (Case 13) all capture trends in experimental observations reasonably well (R2 > 0.9). Case 14 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to surface isopropoxy, which allows that both surface reactions are potentially kinetically significant and adds an additional variable parameter (5 parameters). For this case, we observe a significant decrease in the minimum residual error (SSE = 1.52) relative to Case 11 and Case 12, which each assign rate control to a single surface reaction (SSE11 = 1.66; SSE12 = 1.73). This decrease in residual error is sufficient to offset the penalty for an increased number of free parameters such that there is a commensurate decrease in the AIC value (87.6) relative to the single-reaction rate control scenarios in Case 11 and 12 (AIC11 = 101, AIC12 = 109). Case 15 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to surface isopropanol, allowing that hydrogen addition to the isopropoxy and isopropanol desorption can both be kinetically significant. Similar to the previous PSSH case, this introduces an additional variable parameter (5 total). Despite this, we observe that the minimum residual error (SSE15 = 1.73) is the same as that observed in Case 12. Effectively, the optimal PSSH solution here is driven to the limiting solution where the second surface reaction is fully rate determining. Since there is no decrease in minimum residual error, there is an increase in the AIC value relative to Case 12, indicating no statistical improvement and that the additional parameter is unwarranted. Finally, Case 16 applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to both the surface isopropoxy and surface isopropanol, allowing that that both surface reactions and isopropanol desorption are potentially kinetically significant (6 total parameters). Despite the increase in free parameters, this model achieves the same minimum residual as observed in Case 14; thus, there is no improvement in the model’s ability to describe experimental trends, and the AIC value increases. On the whole, our data appears to be better described by a two-site mechanism than a single-site mechanism. From a statistical perspective, the optimal model is the one that achieves a minimum value of AIC, which is Case 14. This solution is based on a two-site mechanism, applies the pseudo-steady state approximation to surface isopropoxy, and assumes all adsorption/desorption processes are equilibrated. The optimal parameter set for this model is summarized in Table 11 . The parity plot generated using the Case 14 model and the optimized parameter set is illustrated in Fig. 5 . For a more tangible set of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, Table 12 compiles the corresponding pre-exponential factors; activation barriers; enthalpies, entropies, and free energies of reaction; rate constants; and equilibrium constants for each elementary step in the proposed mechanism. All were computed at 298 K using the methods summarized in section 3.8 and the optimal parameter set summarized in Table 11. For comparison, the overall thermodynamics of acetone hydrogenation are also given, and one observes that the sum of each step weighted by its stoichiometric number returns the value of the overall reaction (σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = σ4 = 1; σ5 = −1). With the exception of the activation entropy for step 3, regressed and calculated parameters appear reasonable based on preliminary estimates, general expectations for acetone hydrogenation on Pt, and prior computational analyses for ketone hydrogenation on metals. Our view is that the optimum activation entropy for step 3 is excessively unfavorable (−0.143 ± 0.029 kJ mol−1 K−1). This results in a pre-exponential factor on the order of 106 s−1, which falls outside the range generally expected for a surface reaction [64]. It is worth mentioning that pre-exponential factors/activation entropies are perhaps the most difficult kinetic parameters to accurately regress from kinetic data, and we highlight areas of uncertainty that may impact their values. The absolute magnitude of pre-exponential factors is sensitive to the absolute magnitude of the turnover frequency; thus, any inaccuracy in experimental site-time-yield estimation will translate to inaccuracies in regressed pre-exponential factors. While our determination of reaction rates (±10%) and CO uptake (±5%) are relatively precise, one may raise questions about the validity of using CO chemisorption as a basis for defining site-specific reaction rates. Equating total CO uptake with available Pt surface area is common practice; however, CO is significantly smaller than acetone, isopropanol, and isopropoxy. This may result in fewer steric restrictions and/or weaker lateral interactions for CO relative to the larger hydrocarbons at a given surface coverage, which may cause CO chemisorption to over-estimate the Pt surface area that is available for acetone hydrogenation. In addition, our microkinetic analysis tacitly invokes the mean field approximation, which assumes a random organization of adsorbates on catalytic surfaces. Surface science experiments have shown that, for certain metal catalyzed reactions, adsorbates may instead segregate into “islands,” where one might expect the majority of hydrogenation to occur at the perimeter [64,91–93]. Again, CO chemisorption would likely over-estimate the Pt surface area available for reaction in this case. Both of the above situations are realistic, and either would cause site-time-yields based on ex-situ CO chemisorption to under-estimate the absolute magnitude of the experimental turnover frequency. During regression, this would manifest as unfavorable activation entropies and pre-exponential factors that are low relative to expectations. Aforementioned concerns over the absolute magnitude of the activation entropy aside, the model presented in Case 14, along with the regressed parameter set, is adequate for capturing experimental trends in acetone hydrogenation; accordingly, we examine its predictions for degree of rate control over a large range of experimental conditions (well beyond those where have collected data). We define the Degree of Rate Control, XRC, for elementary step, i, per Campbell as shown in Eq. (26) [94]. (26) XR C i = k i r · δ r δ k i Degree of rate control was evaluated for each step by introducing a 1% perturbation to the rate constant for that step (ki ) while holding constant the equilibrium constant for that step (K i) and the rate constant for all other steps (kj ≠ i ). Results are summarized in Fig. 6 . Interestingly, our statistically optimal model predicts that, in general, both surface reactions are kinetically significant and the degree of rate control from each is sensitive to operating conditions. Indeed, one can only identify regimes where a single surface reaction exerts full rate control at extremely high or extremely low H2 pressures, which suggests that the assumption of a single, universal rate determining step may be invalid during acetone hydrogenation on Pt. By far, the most dramatic shifts in rate control occur with modulation of the hydrogen partial pressure. We attribute these impacts to significant changes in surface coverage under different operating conditions (Fig. 7 ). We observe that acetone is always the dominant species on * sites, while the coverage of isopropoxy is always low on * sites. This seems counterintuitive because isopropoxy has a large binding energy (227 kJ mol−1) relative to acetone (67 kJ mol−1); however, its large binding energy is offset by the fact that the gas-phase isopropoxy radical has a substantially higher enthalpy (−47.7 kJ mol−1) than gas-phase acetone (−217 kJ mol−1). Consequently, bound acetone and bound isopropoxy have comparable surface enthalpies, and the addition of a hydrogen atom to a surface acetone (Step 3) is enthalpically and entropically unfavorable (ΔH3 = 28.6 kJ mol−1, ΔS3 = −22 J mol−1 K−1). Ultimately, the free energy penalty of hydrogenating surface acetone severely restricts the maximum isopropoxy coverage under our typical reaction conditions. In regimes where hydrogen coverages are also low (e.g., at very low hydrogen partial pressures or at high reaction temperatures), rate control lies primarily with Step 4: addition of a hydrogen atom to surface isopropoxy. In contrast, in regimes where hydrogen coverages approach 1, rate control shifts toward Step 3: addition of a hydrogen atom to surface acetone. Hydrogenation of acetone on a Pt surface (Step 3) has a relatively large free energy of activation and is therefore kinetically challenging, whereas hydrogenation of isopropoxy on a Pt surface (Step 4) has a relatively small free energy of activation and is kinetically facile. Accordingly, at our typical reaction temperatures, the rate constant for isopropoxy hydrogenation (Step 4) exceeds that of acetone hydrogenation (Step 3) by 6–7 orders of magnitude (Table 12). Under conditions where hydrogen atoms and/or isopropoxy species are abundant on the catalyst surface, rate control is dictated by free energies of activation, and the more kinetically demanding reaction (Step 3) controls the overall reaction rate. Conversely, under conditions where isopropoxy and/or hydrogen coverages are sparse (but acetone coverages remain high), the kinetically facile step (Step 4) becomes rate controlling because there is a small driving force (chemical potential) for reaction. This highlights the importance of a holistic consideration of activation parameters, surface coverages, and/or species partial pressures in assessing rate control, and it provides an interesting illustration of how rate controlling steps, much like apparent barriers and reaction orders, may change depending on regimes where data are collected. The above analysis suggests that acetone hydrogenation can be effectively modelled using a two-site Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism by assuming that all adsorption processes are equilibrated and that each of the two surface reactions partially controls the rate of reaction. While these assumptions capture trends in data, the conclusion does not immediately reconcile with our observation that an H2/D2 switch has a minor impact on observed rates of acetone hydrogenation (Section 3.7). Each surface reaction involves the formation of an H-X bond; thus, the lack of a prominent kinetic isotope effect argues against either of these steps being rate controlling. That said, regression analyses show that, within the set of constraints outlined in section 3.8, we are unable to satisfactorily reconcile our data with kinetic control by acetone adsorption or isopropanol desorption, which are the only two steps that should display no primary kinetic isotope effect when switching the reducing gas from H2 to D2. We attempt to resolve this below. The statistically optimal kinetic model was developed by applying the pseudo-steady state approximation to the isopropoxy intermediate while assuming that all adsorption-desorption processes were equilibrated. The overall rate of hydrogenation anticipated in this scenario is given by Eqs. (27)–(34), and we observe that it has a complex dependence on the equilibrium constants for Steps 1, 2, and 5 as well as forward and reverse rate constants for steps 3 and 4. Further, since we always define reverse rate constants as a function of forward rate constants and equilibrium constants, the overall hydrogenation rate has an implicit dependence on the equilibrium constants for steps 3 and 4.

The exact magnitude of this decrease will depend upon mass differences in the isotopologues involved in the reaction; differences in zero-point vibrational energies of the reactants, transition states, and products; and the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate (i.e., early vs. late transition state). Owing to this complexity, there is no reason to expect that each surface reaction should exhibit an identical primary kinetic isotope effect, and it is hard to predict the exact magnitude without a full vibrational mode analysis for all surface species. That said, one typically expects that a switch from H to D will decrease the rate constant for a reaction directly involving an H-X bond by a factor of 2–6 [95]; however, one may not observe the full impact in experimentally measurable hydrogenation rates [59–63]. A switch from H to D may also perturb equilibrium constants for any reactions where reactants and products are deuterated to different extents. For example, we estimate that the equilibrium constant for the gas-phase hydrogenation of acetone is roughly 1–3 times larger than the analogous gas-phase deuteration of acetone (See Online supporting information) at our typical reaction temperatures. In our proposed mechansim, one would expect such Thermodynamic Isotope Effects to arise in Step 1 (H2 dissociation); Step 3 (hydrogen addition to surface acetone); and Step 4 (hydrogen addition to surface isopropoxy). In contrast, the reaction thermochemistry for Step 2 (Acetone adsorption) and Step 5 (Isopropanol Adsorption) should not be strongly impacted by switching the reducing gas between H2 and D2. Equilibrium constants for steps 1, 3, and 4 appear throughout our PSSH solution; thus, it is reasonable to expect that thermodynamic isotope effects will contribute to observed changes in hydrogenation rates upon H2/D2 switching. Depending on the magnitude of both kinetic and thermodynamic isotope effects as well as the surface coverage under reaction conditions, the impact of isotope substitution may largely cancel from experimental observations. Unfortunately, the PSSH solution described in Eqs. (27)–(34) does not lend itself to a concise rate expression, which makes it difficult to visualize the tension between kinetic and thermodynamic isotope effects. As a simple illustration, we consider the limiting case where the rate of acetone hydrogenation is entirely controlled by addition of a hydrogen atom to a surface bound acetone (Step 3). In the zero-conversion limit, the isopropanol partial pressure is zero, and the macroscopic rate expression reduces to Eq. (35). (35) r = k 3 f · K 1 1 2 K 2 · a ACE · a H 2 1 2 1 + K 2 · a ACE · 1 + K 1 1 2 · a H 2 1 2 At low temperatures, we observe that acetone hydrogenation is zero order in acetone and half order in hydrogen. To reproduce these observations, * sites must be acetone saturated and s sites must be mostly vacant, which generally agrees with our simulated coverage regimes under reaction conditions (e.g., see Fig. 7 at near-ambient temperatures and H2 pressures). In this limit, the rate expression reduces to Eq. (36). (36) r = k 3 f · K 1 1 2 · a H 2 1 2 For a fixed pressure of H2/D2, the experimentally observed KIE would be given by Eq. (37), which depends on the rate constant for step 3 as well as the equilibrium constant for step 1 (H2 or D2 dissociation). (37) KI E A = k 3 f , H k 3 f , D · K 1 , H K 1 , D 1 2 One generally expects that a change from H to D will decrease the magnitude of the elementary rate constants for Step 3, i.e., this step involves formation of an H-X bond and so should display a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, it is also realistic that replacing H with D can increase the magnitude of the equilibrium constant for Step 1, which may offset the anticipated kinetic isotope effect. For example, for a fixed H/D binding energy, Pt-D bonds should have lower frequency vibrational modes than Pt-H bonds, which could result in D2 dissociation being more thermodynamically favorable than H2 dissociation (K1,H < K1,D). In the case where replacing H with D causes a factor-of-two decrease in the rate constant for step 3 and a factor-of-two increase in the equilibrium constant for step 1, one would observe an apparent KIE of ≈ 1.4, which is significantly diminished from the true KIE and in line with our experimental observation of a low temperature KIE of ≈ 1.2. This example is, of course, speculative. It is only intended to highlight the fact that observed kinetic impacts of isotope exchange are often non-elementary and may represent a convolution of many fundamental impacts of changes in isotope mass. Ultimately, a full vibrational mode analysis of adsorbed intermediates and transition states is necessary to determine whether rate control by surface reactions can reconcile with the lack of an apparent kinetic isotope effect upon switching the reducing gas from H2 to D2 during acetone hydrogenation on Pt/SiO2."
18,Conclusion,"Microkinetic analysis of acetone hydrogenation over Pt/SiO2 suggests that observed kinetic trends are consistent with a Horuiti-Polanyi type mechanism involving two distinct active sites. Rate control in this system appears to lie primarily with surface reactions, namely the addition of hydrogen atoms to bound acetone and isopropoxy fragments. Both steps appear kinetically significant, and the degree of rate control exerted by each shifts with operating conditions, particularly the hydrogen partial pressure. This result highlights the importance of considering both free energies of activation (i.e., rate constants) and potentials of reacting species (e.g., surface coverages and partial pressures) in identifying a rate controlling step. At first glance, a lack of observed kinetic isotope effect upon switching between H2 and D2 stands in apparent contrast with the conclusion that surface reactions are rate controlling; however, observed reaction rates have a complex dependence on multiple elementary rate and equilibrium constants, any of which may be impacted by a change in isotopic mass. It is thus plausible that opposing kinetic and thermodynamic impacts of isotope exchange prevent the observation of a full, primary kinetic isotope effect in this system."
