0,Introduction,"Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising photocatalyst, attributing to its inherent stability, feat bandgap and profuse source [1–5]. However, the application of g-C3N4 in hydrogen (H2) evolution remains extremely restricted due to rapid electron-hole pair recombination behavior and narrow light-response range (λ < 470 nm) [6–8]. Therefore, the exploit of efficient exciton-splitting of g-C3N4 with broad spectral response is intensely imminent [9–11]. Thus far, various typical strategies have been devoted to modulating the excitonic features of g-C3N4 and further increasing solar energy conversion activity, including heterojunction construction, element doping and nano-structuring regulation [12–14]. Unfortunately, the developed photocatalytic activity of bulk g-C3N4 is still unsatisfactory owing to re-stacked nanosheets and interfacial defect recombination centers metal leaded by element doping [15–18]. Recently, donor–acceptor self-doping has become an effective means, demonstrating the promise of extending the visible light response range of g-C3N4, adjusting the potential and optimize the separation of photogenerated excitons [19–23]. Especially, organic molecules (pyrimidine, benzoquinone, glyoxal. etc) involved in the design of carbon nitride can obtain acceptable exciton separation ability, indicating the subject of research hotspot [24,25]. Nevertheless, the electronegativity of N is higher than that of C, which results in difficult to replace N with C in heptazine units [26,27], and therefore the hydrogen production performance is unsatisfied, as shown in Table 1 . Therefore, the construction of a carbon chain in heptane units to generate an intramolecular electron donor channel for charge transfer has been proposed as an effective strategy to accelerate the charge transfer performance [28,29]. Herein, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) grafted into g-C3N4 conjugated copolymers were obtained by the thermally copolymerization of π-π conjugated system donor PPD and nitrogen-rich acceptor melamine. Interestingly, this PPD/g-C3N4 exhibits such high light absorption at 200–1000 nm that the H2 production activity extends from blue light to orange light. Under visible light irradiation, the optimum sample exhibits a very high H2 production efficiency (1040 μmol g−1 h−1), indicating approximatively 5 times of that of bulk C3N4. The introduction of donor benzene ring groups into the g-C3N4 structure can not only inhibit carrier recombination, but also enhance the visible light trapping ability. Therefore, it should be noted that 3 wt% PPD/CN still produces hydrogen (5.29 μmol g−1 h−1) at λ = 600 nm (orange light). This work interprets the reasonable photocatalytic mechanism of PPD/g-C3N4 conjugated copolymers."
1,Preparation of different catalyst samples,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Melamine (MA), triethanolamine (TEOA), p-phenylenediamine (PPD, Mr = 108.14), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. FTO glass was ordered from Suzhou Crystal Silicon Electronics & Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents in this study were employed without further purification. Deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol were used throughout the whole experimental process and all of the chemicals were directly utilized without further purification."
3,Synthesis of g-C3N4.,"2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4. Bulk g-C3N4 was prepared by the traditional melamine pyrolysis method [30]. Generally, in an air atmosphere, using a 50 mL alumina crucible with a lid, 5 g of melamine is calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h. Finally, light-yellow powders were obtained."
4,Synthesis of PPD/CN samples,"2.3 Synthesis of PPD/CN samples PPD/CN samples were synthesized by a calcination strategy similar to g-C3N4. In brief, melamine and PPD were selected as the starting materials for synthesis of PPD/CN. A MA (5 g) and PPD (0.155 g) were fully ground and mixed in an agate mortar. Afterward, the mixed product was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h at the same heating rate to obtain the final product. The as-prepared samples are labeled as 3 wt% PPD/CN. Subsequently, the preparation process was unchanged, and PPD/CN with different amounts of PPD (0.5, 1, 6 wt%) was prepared. For simplicity, the sample is labeled as x wt% PPD/CN, where x represented the mass fraction of PPD added in melamine."
5,Samples characterization,"2.4 Samples characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed from a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) from 10° to 80° (7.0° min−1) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) were taken from the Nexus 470 (Thermo Electron Corporation). The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were recorded on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, 4800 field-emission, Hitachi, Japan). The Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN was employed to collect transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, while the elemental mapping was obtained by the TEM instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was obtained on the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha. Elemental Analyzer was conducted on the FLASH1112A (America). The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) was measured by the Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescene (PL) were implemented by the QuantaMaster™ 40 spectrometer. The photoelectrochemical testing was acquired by an electrochemical workstation (CHI-852C, Shanghai Chenhua Limited, China). Mott-Schottky (M−S) formula [31]: (1) 1 C SC 2 = 2 A 2 N d e 0 ε ε 0 E - E FB - KT e 0 + 1 C H 2 (2) N d = 2 q ε ε 0 × d 1 C 2 E where CSC is the space charge region capacitance in the organic catalyst, E acts as the additional potential, EFB indicates the flat-band potential, e0 means to the element-charge value, Nd refers to the charge carrier density, ε stands for the electric permittivity of the photocatalyst (ε = 5.5), ε0 represents the dielectric constant of free space (8.85 × 10−14F/cm), q portrays as elementary charge (1.60 × 10−19C), T denotes the temperature, and K figures as the Boltzmann constant [32]."
6,Photocatalytic characterization,"2.5 Photocatalytic characterization Photocatalytic performances were investigated by the photocatalytic H2 production under light irradiation. Normally, a 20 mg of sample was added to a 50 mL aqueous solution involving 10 vol% TEOA serving as the sacrificial agent. Then, the H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (~2 wt% Pt) as the precursor for the cocatalyst Pt was added, which was in-situ-photoreduced under light irradiation. Then, the solution was degassed and irradiated with a 300 W Xenon lamp assigned with a λ > 420 nm cutoff filter. The photocatalytic H2 evolution was supervised by employing a GC-7920 instrument with high-purity nitrogen as the carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector. In order to reduce the experimental error, the above test was repeated three times for g-C3N4 and x wt% PPD/CN, and error bars were drawn. Moreover, the injection port, column, and detector temperatures are 120, 80, and 180 °C, respectively. Besides, the recycle test was operated by using a gas closed circulation system and a 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with band pass filters (λ = 400, 420, 500, 600 nm and λ > 420 nm) under the same condition. Specifically, the reaction system was vacuumed every 4 h and the generated H2 data was recorded at intervals of 1 h by totally cycling test for 16 h."
7,Results and discussion,"The reaction process and possible structural formula for the formation of x wt% PPD/CN are presented in Fig. 1 (a). The conversion in the crystalline nature of g-C3N4 and x wt% PPD/CN were first investigated through the measurement of XRD (Fig. 1(a)). Powder XRD demonstrated that the g-C3N4 treated with different concentrations PPD presented similar structures. The XRD pattern of pure g-C3N4 demonstrated two typical peaks at 13.1° and 27.8°, indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4 [20]. The (002) is caused by the stacking of coplanar aromatic system crystal planes, while the (100) is related to the in-plane structure accumulation of heptazine units [33]. It was very interesting to observe that the (002) of the x wt% PPD/CN sample is blue-shifted to 27.4°. In addition, with the increase of PPD content, the (002) intensity of x wt% PPD/CN showed a gradual decrease, indicating PPD might react with g-C3N4 by introduced benzene rings through PPD and cause some structural transformation. The structural conversion can significantly enhance the crystal structure of bulk C3N4 materials. The broadening and weakening of the (002) of 6 wt% PPD/CN is the reason why the graphite structure of the heptazine aromatic is disturbed. The x wt% PPD/CN still maintains the primary structural characteristics of g-C3N4 after the incorporation of PPD as confirmed by XRD patterns due to the addition of a small amount of PPD. FTIR spectroscopy is used to further determine changes in molecular structures and functional groups in x wt% PPD/CN (Fig. S1 and Fig. 1(d)). Owning to the symmetrical and antisymmetric tensile vibration of the NH2 and OH groups, the FTIR spectrum of all samples possessed a characteristic broad peak at 3000–3650 cm−1 [34]. The typical peaks around 1100–1600 cm−1 are determined as the CN group of heptazine aromatic. The 810 cm−1 bending vibration of the triazine ring is compatible with previous reports. This revealed that the original heptazine aromatic framework is retained. In addition, we observed a weak peak is observed in the infrared spectrum of 3 wt% PPD/CN between 1480 and 1600 cm−1. The peak at 1520 cm−1 corresponds to the extension of aromatic CC in Fig. 1(d), confirming that the benzene ring has been successfully grafted into the structure of g-C3N4 [35]. Based on above results, we deduced that the PPD-adding thermal the polymerization route could successfully construct heptazine-based framework and the intramolecular conjugated heterojunction [23]. As show in Table S1, with the addition of PPD, C element in carbon nitride increases and N element decreases due to the grafting of aromatic ring. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization furnished surface structural characteristics of a series of contrast samples and C, N and O elements were observed. The XPS elemental survey scans of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN showed peaks corresponding to C 1s and N 1s in Fig. 1(c) & S2. The C 1s XPS spectrum for bulk g-C3N4 contains three peaks, indicating binding energies at 284.4, 287.9, and 293.3 eV. For C 1s of bulk g-C3N4, C 2p-hybrid CN in triazine, the peaks of defective CC are assigned to 288.2 and 284.4 eV, respectively (see in Fig. 1(c)). Additionally, the atoms usually demonstrate similar binding energies for similar bonding environments. The 3 wt% PPD/CN with a binding energy of 287.9 eV is attributed to the influence of C 2p binding carbon (CCC), while the bulk g-C3N4 is 288.1 eV [35]. Apparently, due to the introduction of the carbocyclic ring, the contribution of the 284.4 eV peak of PPD/CN is significantly bigger than the contribution of g-C3N4. Among N 1 of 3 wt% PPD/CN, the peaks at 398.4, 399.4, and 400.6 eV can be indexed as CNC, N(C)3 groups and edge amino functional groups [36]. Moreover, the 399.4 eV peak without obvious shift changes also confirmed that no π-conjugated bond was formed between the edge N of the triazine and the C of the carbocyclic ring (Fig. 1(c)) [23]. These results indicate that the triazine ring chemical framework of PPD/CN is maintained, and the donor PPD is polymerized with MA in other ways. At present, the formation process of PPD/CN is not fully understood. The solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra further confirmed the chemical framework and elemental composition of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN. As shown in Fig. 1(e), there are two strong peaks at 162.54 ppm and 154.70 ppm, which represent the chemical shifts of C1 atoms [CN2 (NHx)] and C2 atoms (CN3), respectively [37–39]. Compared with13C NMR spectra of g-C3N4, two small peaks of 3 wt% PPD/CN can be clearly observed at 122.5 and 134.36 ppm, representing CC and CCN chemical shifts, respectively. Numerous intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed based on NH2 and NH groups are hardly conducive to the electrons transfer between layers of bulk g-C3N4, resulting in local high charge [33,40,41]. All evidence reveals that successful introduction of conjugated aromatic rings into carbon nitride. The morphology and microstructure of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN were investigated via the SEM and TEM. According to the observation results of the SEM (Fig. 2 a–b), g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN show similar morphology. On the basis of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observation (Fig. 2c–e), it was clear that 3 wt% PPD/CN possessed multiple periodic stacked layers compared with the original g-C3N4, and these layers were amorphous nanosheets. Moreover, it shows that from 3 wt% PPD/CN is still a classic block structure, and there were no obvious lattice stripes indicating the disordering of atomic arrangements [42,43]. As show in Fig. 2(f), only two elements, C and N, appear on 3 wt% PPD/CN. It means that 3 wt% PPD/CN is only composed of C and N elements, and all elements are uniformly distributed. To evaluate the influence of PPD incorporation on the photoactivity properties of g-C3N4, the diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (DRS) of all samples were obtained. With the increase of PPD content in Fig. S3, the absorption intensity of PPD/CN in the visible light range gradually increases implying better exciton dissociation features, and the color of the modified samples changes from bright yellow to dark gray (Fig. S7) [7]. Fig. 3 (a) shows UV–vis DRS of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN to further confirm that PPD enhances visible light photocatalytic activity. The typical spectrum of g-C3N4 shows a good absorption peak from 200 to 460 nm. Interestingly, the light absorption range of 3 wt% PPD/CN has been expanded to 450–1000 nm, which makes it possible to use low-energy visible light [44]. When using (αhν)2 for the Tauc plots, a good linear fit of bulk g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN is observed and the accurate bandgap of bulk g-C3N4 was calculated at 2.60 eV, and 2.56 eV for the 3 wt% PPD/CN. In addition, according to the slope of Mott-Schottky (M−S) plots of pure g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN (Fig. 3(c) and (d)), the EFB and charge density of 3 wt% PPD/CN are calculated by M−S formula (Compared with g-C3N4 (relative E FB is about −1.18 V), the valence band potential has a negative shift (relative E FB is about −1.45 V) [45]. The tangent lines of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN both show positive slopes, indicating the n-type characteristics of the semiconductor. For n-type semiconductors, the flat band potential E FB is about 0.1 V lower than the conduction band (CB) [46]. Taking into account the bandgap width, the valence band (VB) and CB edge energy levels of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN are located at about −1.28 and 1.32 eV, −1.55 and −1.01 eV (relative to NHE), respectively. The above results show that the preparation of π-π conjugated polymers by adding different contents of PPD to g-C3N4 significantly improves visible light absorption and adjusts the bandgap of x wt% PPD/CN. Under standard reaction and measurement conditions using TEOA as sacrificial electron donor and Pt as the cocatalyst, photocatalytic activity of x wt% PPD/CN suspension in pure water was evaluated by H2 reaction under visible light. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show g-C3N4 has poor hydrogen production activity, which is mainly attributed to the higher electron-hole recombination rate. The x wt% PPD/CN exhibits higher H2 production activity than g-C3N4, especially, the 3 wt% PPD/CN has the highest H2 production rate (1040.0 μmol g−1 h−1), which is 5.3 times that of g-C3N4 (193.7 μmol g−1 h−1). The introduction of PPD in g-C3N4, the movement of the electron cloud on the aromatic ring to the active N position, which promotes the transmission of photons, thereby promoting the photocatalytic water splitting. With the increase of PPD content, the electron cloud is confined to the large number of benzene rings linked on the heptazine molecular chain due to the conjugation effect, which hinders the photon transmission path [47–49]. Moreover, through four consecutive photocatalytic reaction cycles, the 3 wt% PPD/CN still has acceptable photocatalytic activity, and the amount of hydrogen produced by photocatalytic water splitting has not been significantly reduced, which indicates that this conjugated heterostructure is resistant to photolithography. The effect of PPD addition on the electron separation and migration behavior in x wt% PPD/CN was evaluated by photoluminescence spectroscopy. The photoelectric properties of g-C3N4 are generally closely related to its chemical structure [50]. As shown in Fig. S4, the main PL emission peak is located at approximate 465 nm, and the PL peak has a significant red shift, which is attributed to the incorporation of the benzene ring to extend the π-conjugated heterogeneous interface, giving PPD/CN strong electrophilic surface properties. In addition, according to related work, the lower the PL peak intensity means that the effective photo-generated carrier separation efficiency is higher, which further proves that 3 wt% PPD/CN has the highest photocatalytic activity. In principle, the dramatically plunged PL should be attributed to the difference in electron affinity between the heptazine unit and benzene ring, which greatly restrains the photoinduced exciton pair recombination. Due to the introduction of the aromatic ring, the electron-induced effect causes the electron cloud to shift to the active N site, inhibits electron-hole recombination and promotes photon transport, thereby promoting photocatalytic water splitting [51,52]. In order to further understand the photogenerated carrier barrier of the catalyst, the EIS and transient photocurrent tests of the samples were further studied. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the arc radius of 3 wt% PPD/CN in the impedance diagram is much smaller than g-C3N4, which indicates that the conjugated structure in the heptazine unit can accelerate the charge transfer kinetics. Fig. 4(d) shows the photocurrent transient data of g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN. 3 wt% PPD/CN has a photocurrent density (about 0.31 μA·cm−2) higher than g-C3N4 under visible light, indicating that 3 wt% PPD/CN has more excellent conductivity and inhibits electron-hole recombination [46]. The mass junction has high photochemical stability (Fig. 4(e)). Comparing the XRD spectra before and after the cycle reaction, we found that 3 wt% PPD/CN still maintains a good crystalline morphology (Fig. S5). Moreover, the hydrogen evolution rate of pure g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN were collected under a series of wavelength irradiation (Fig. 4(f)). When the wavelength was 600 nm, g-C3N4 was barely photoactive, while the 3 wt% PPD/CN had photocatalytic performance under 600 nm (5.29 μmol g−1 h−1) suggesting highly efficient solar energy utilization of the 3 wt% PPD/CN. Introducing a benzene ring between the heptazine ring units can effectively expand the light absorption range. As the content of PPD increases, the light absorption of PPD/CN increases in the range of 500–1000 nm. In Fig. S6, under full-spectrum light radiation, the 3 wt% PPD/CN has a hydrogen production efficiency of 6857.16 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 3.1 times than that of pure g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. S6, the 3 wt% PPD/CN also showed good photoactivity under blue (λ = 420 nm) and green (λ = 500 nm) light (339.09 and 64.84 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively), which further clarified that 3 wt% PPD/CN can capture more photons during the visible light catalysis process. The conduction band position is calculated from the bandgap width and valence band position, and a simple schematic diagram of the energy band structure is drawn in Fig. 5 . The CB positions of bulk g-C3N4 and 3 wt% PPD/CN are −1.18 and −1.45 eV, respectively. Although compared with bulk g-C3N4, the correction is −0.27 eV, which is still more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2. Therefore, the possible process of H2 release under visible light is proposed [59]: (1) PPD/CN + hν → ePPD/CN− + hPPD/CN+ (2) TEOA + h PPD/CN+ → TEOA+ (3) 2H+ + 2ePPD/CN − → H2 As shown in Eq. (2), TEOA acts as a hole scavenger and combines with holes in the VB to effectively promote electron-hole separation. PPD/CN is a promising photocatalytic material, which can decompose water under visible light (λ > 420 nm) to produce H2 with a yield of 1040.0 μmol g−1 h−1. More importantly, the lower PL intensity, lower impedance and higher photocurrent density also prove that the unique carbocyclic conjugated conjugated copolymers accelerate the transmission of photogenerated electrons and effectively inhibits the recombination of photo-excited electrons and holes. UV–vis DRS also confirmed that 3 wt% PPD/CN can respond to light in an ultra-wide range of 200–1000 nm."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the π-conjugated conjugated copolymers PPD/CN was successfully prepared through a molecular design annealing process. Compared with the pure g-C3N4, the H2 production efficiency is increased by 5.3 times (1040 μmol g−1 h−1). In addition, under the blue and green light radiation, the H2 production of 3 wt% PPD/CN (339.09 μmol g−1 h−1 and 64.84 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively) were still 7.7 and 2.3 times that of pure g-C3N4. Under λ = 600 nm (orange light), H2 was still generated (5.29 μmol g−1 h−1). We attribute this phenomenon to the movement of the electron cloud on the aromatic ring to the active N position, which promotes photon transport, thereby promoting photocatalytic water splitting. With the increase of PPD content, we have demonstrated the conjugated homogeneous junction of PPD/CN increases the light absorption range under visible light irradiation. It is envisaged that this novel design of g-C3N4 can be expanded to other polymeric semiconductors, may open up opportunities for exploring cost-effective and green photocatalysts for the production of clean energy."
