0,Introduction,"Difluorocarbene is an important intermediate that has been widely used in the synthesis of difluoromethyl (thio)ethers, gem-difluorocyclopropa(e)nes, and gem-difluoroalkenes (including tetrafluoroethene) [1,2]. More recently, it has also found applications in difluoromethylation of carbon acids [3], 18F-labeled trifluoromethylation [4], metal-mediated fluoroalkylation [5] and fluorocarbon homologation [6], and difluoromethylenative coupling reactions [7], among others [8]. Due to the combined inductive effect of fluorine (destabilization effect) and π-donation from the fluorine to the carbon (stabilization effect), difluorocarbene in its singlet ground state is a moderately electrophilic species and reacts much more easily with the electron-rich substrates than the electron-poor ones [1c]. In this context, structurally diverse difluorocarbene precursors that allow its efficient generation and further reaction under varying conditions have been developed [1a,2]. It is interesting to note that in heteroatom-difluoromethylation with various difluorocarbene precursors, an alkaline base is usually needed to activate both the pronucleophiles and the difluorocarbene precursor. Correspondingly, either a miscible or biphasic aqueous-organic solvent system is preferred to dissolve the reactants [1a,1e,2a-g]. However, although many difluorocarbene-involved reactions, including some [2 + 1] cycloadditions with alkenes, have been achieved in the presence of water [1,2,9,10], there has been no report on the reaction of difluorocarbene with organic compounds in water as the sole solvent [11]. In 2017, by using TMSCF2Br, a general and versatile difluorocarbene source first introduced by us [2h,12], we achieved the difluoromethylation of alcohols under the activation of mild activators such as KHF2 in a mixed solvent system of dichloromethane/water at room temperature (Scheme 1 a) [1a], which not only addressed the synthetic problem of difluoromethylation of alcohols with difluorocarbene under strongly basic conditions, but also showed that the reaction of alcohols with difluorocarbene can proceed readily in a manner different from phenols. Since our last publication of this method, it has found applications in the preparation of alkyl difluoromethyl ethers of potential biological interest [13]. In view of the high reactivity of neutral alcohols towards difluorocarbene and the mildness of the conditions for the generation of difluorocarbene from TMSCF2Br, we were curious about the reaction of alcohols with TMSCF2Br in water as the sole solvent. In organic synthesis, water is not only a green reaction medium, but also can impressively accelerate many reactions [14]. Herein, we present our results on difluoromethylation of alcohols with difluorocarbene generated from TMSCF2Br under more environmentally benign conditions (Scheme 1b). This research also provides a new insight into the generation and reaction of difluorocarbene in a two-phase system. We showed that in a two-phase system, the transfer of an activated difluorocarbene precursor from the interfacial region to the organic phase region, which has been a challenging process even under phase-transfer catalysis [1d,9,15], can be a feasible process when TMSCF2Br is used as a unique reagent in the absence of any catalyst, since TMSCF2Br can form a lipophilic pentacoordinate intermediate in the interfacial region."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Optimization of reaction conditions,"2.1 Optimization of reaction conditions At the onset of our investigation, we chose alcohol 1a as a model substrate to survey the influence of organic solvent on the reaction (Table 1 ; and Table S–2 in Supplementary data). In our previous report, the reaction between alcohols and TMSCF2Br (2) was performed in a mixed solvent system of CH2Cl2/water (1:1, v/v) under the activation of KHF2. By using the reported optimal reactant ratio, we first investigated the difluoromethylation of 1a in water (0.6 L per mol of alcohol) in the presence of varying volume of CH2Cl2. To reflect the kinetic profile, the reaction was usually quenched before the full consumption of the starting materials and detected by 19F NMR analysis. As shown in Table 1, the reaction was sensitive to the volume of CH2Cl2. Decreasing the volume of CH2Cl2 significantly accelerated the reaction, which probably arose from the increase of the concentration of both reactants 1a and TMSCF2Br (Table 1, entries 1–3). Considering that both alcohol 1a and TMSCF2Br are liquid and of low solubility in water at ambient temperature, we performed the reaction in water. Surprisingly, the reaction proceeded much faster than in the mixed solvent system (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). The difluoromethyl ether 3a was produced in 97% 19F NMR yield in half an hour (Table 1, entry 5). Encouraged by this finding, we further investigated the influence of the amount of water. When more water was used, a nearly complete consumption of TMSCF2Br gave much lower yields of 3a (Table 1, entries 6–8), and the addition of a second portion of reagents further improved the yield (Table 1, entry 9). When less water (0.3 L per mol of alcohol) was used, a 61% consumption of TMSCF2Br led to the formation of 3a in 82% yield, showing an enhanced conversion of TMSCF2Br to 3a (Table 1, entry 10); however, the reaction was retarded to some extent due to the insufficient dissolution of KHF2 in water (39.2 g/100 mL, 20 °C). This phenomenon is different from the extensively studied “on-water” reaction, where the reaction occurs in the oil-water interface and is not influenced by the amount of water [14]. In our current reaction, if the difluoromethylation of 1a mainly occurs in the interfacial region, although much more water could dilute the activator KHF2, and thus result in a lower concentration of pentacoordinate silicate intermediate generated at the oil-water interface, the conversion of TMSCF2Br to 3a should not decrease, because the concentrations of 1a and TMSCF2Br do not change. The observed decrease of the utilization of TMSCF2Br as the increase of the amount of water indicates that the difluoromethylation mainly occurs in the organic phase, as the transfer rate of the pentacoordinate silicate intermediate can be influenced by its concentration in the interfacial region. Moreover, control experiments showed that TMSCF2Br was consumed at the similar rate no matter in the presence or absence of 1a (Table 1, entries 10 and 12), suggesting that a controlled release of difluorocarbene from TMSCF2Br and an efficient capture of difluorocarbene by enhancing the concentration of alcohol would be helpful for improving the difluoromethylation."
3,Scope and limitation,"2.2 Scope and limitation We examined the substrate scope of the reaction between alcohols and TMSCF2Br in water. As shown in Table 2 , primary, secondary, and tertiary cohols that are liquid at ambient temperature readily underwent the reaction to give difluoromethyl ethers in moderate to excellent yields. For primary alcohols (1a-1k), the reaction was conducted by using 2.0 equiv of TMSCF2Br and 4.0 equiv of KHF2 in water (0.6 mL per mmol of alcohol). The reaction typically completed in 2 h. For secondary alcohols (1l-1s), 3.0 equiv of TMSCF2Br and 6.0 equiv of KHF2 were needed due to the steric hindrance of alcohols towards difluorocarbene, and prolonged reaction time (6 h) was required to achieve high yields. When a tertiary alcohol (1t) was subject to the reaction, the use of more amount of TMSCF2Br (4.0 equiv) and KHF2 (8.0 equiv) was necessary to ensure the efficient conversion of alcohol 1t into difluoromethyl ether 3t, and the reaction completed in 12 h. Compared to our previous report [2a], the reaction in water could afford the difluoromethyl ethers in similar or much higher yields (Table 2, 3g, 3h, 3p, and 3r-t). In the cases of solid alcohols, the difluoromethylation at ambient temperature was found to be of very low efficiency. For example, reaction of hexadecan-1-ol (1x) gave the difluoromethyl ether 3x in only 24% yield, despite complete consumption of TMSCF2Br. It was found that heating, which allows melting the alcohols to liquid, is a viable way to improve the reaction. For alcohols with moderate melting points (1u-1aa) (for details, see SI), performing the reaction at a temperature slightly higher than the melting points of these alcohols afforded the corresponding difluoromethyl ethers in good yields (3u-3aa). As a complementary and an alternative approach, the reaction of solid alcohols can also proceed in water at ambient temperature with the addition of a minimum volume of CH2Cl2 to dissolve the alcohols (Table 3 ). Thus, adding CH2Cl2 (0.2 L per mol of alcohol) into the reaction mixture of alcohols with varying melting points, TMSCF2Br and KHF2 in water (0.6 mL per mmol of alcohol) resulted in the production of difluoromethyl ether 3 in yields comparable to those obtained by previous method (0.6 L of CH2Cl2 per mol of alcohol). The reaction of triol 1ac or sugar derivative 1ad with TMSCF2Br/KHF2 in water afforded trace amount of difluoromethylation product (Fig. 1 ), indicating the limitation of the current protocol when applying it to some water-soluble alcohols. However, ethanol, which is also miscible with water, smoothly underwent the difluoromethylation, with C2H5OCF2H being detected in about 30% yield, despite its volatility. TMSCF2Br-water extraction tests of alcohols 1a, 1ac, 1ad and ethanol in the absence of KHF2 showed that almost no alcohol 1ac or 1ad was extracted by TMSCF2Br, while 95% of alcohol 1a and about 1% of ethanol entered the organic phase (for details, see section 3 in ESI). Obviously, the extraction of the alcohol by TMSCF2Br is necessary for the difluoromethylation, providing an evidence to support that difluoromethylation of alcohols mainly occurs in the organic phase. To demonstrate the practicability of current protocol, we conducted the difluoromethylation of alcohol 1a in water on 10-mmol scale. After the completion of the reaction, a direct 1H NMR analysis of the organic phase showed that difluoromethyl ether 3a was formed with a purity of almost 90%. After workup, the isolated yield of crude 3a was 85% (Scheme 2 )."
4,Proposed mechanism,"2.3 Proposed mechanism Based on our results and discussion, and taking into account the previous mechanistic studies on reaction of carbenes with hydroxyl groups [1d,2c,16], a plausible mechanism for the difluoromethylation of alcohols with difluorocarbene in water is proposed (Scheme 3 ). In the two-phase system consisting of TMSCF2Br with an alcohol and an aqueous solution of KHF2, TMSCF2Br was activated by KHF2 to form a pentacoordinate silicate intermediate at the oil-water interface, which then enters the organic phase under the driving force of its lipophilicity (Scheme 3, Eq. 1). In the organic phase, BrCF2K is released from the pentacoordinate silicate intermediate (Scheme 3, Eq. 2), and then splits into KBr and the singlet difluorocarbene (Scheme 3, Eq. 3). The latter species interacts with two alcohol molecules to form a five-membered complex with oxonium character [16c], which eventually undergoes double proton transfer to deliver the difluoromethyl ether and regenerate one alcohol molecule (Scheme 3, Eq. 4). The complex is probably formed through the interaction of the central carbon’s vacant p-orbital with the oxygen’s lone pair of the first alcohol molecule and the hydrogen bonding between the central carbon and the second alcohol molecule [16a]. At the oil-water interface, BrCF2K released from the pentacoordinate silicate intermediate readily undergoes protonation (Scheme 3, Eqs. 5 and 6), which constitutes the major side reaction of TMSCF2Br when KHF2 is used as the activator. The feasibility of generating difluorocarbene from TMSCF2Br in the organic phase of a biphasic system is further supported by the gem-difluorocyclopropanation of an electron-rich alkene, 1,1-diphenylethene (for detail, see section 4 in Supplementary data)."
5,A comparison with the difluoromethylation of phenols,"2.4 A comparison with the difluoromethylation of phenols We compared the difluoromethylation of phenol 4 using water as the only solvent to that in CH2Cl2/water (Scheme 4 ). As previously reported [2g], the basic activator KOH is necessary, which promotes the generation of difluorocarbene and subsequent reaction with phenol (via phenolate anion). Using the reported optimal reactant ratio, the reaction in water (without organic solvent) afforded product 5 in moderate yield, although TMSCF2Br was consumed completely. In contrast, the reaction in CH2Cl2/water was much more efficient, where a 60% conversion of TMSCF2Br led to the formation of 5 in 86% yield (similar to previous report). The relative low efficiency of the reaction in water may be attributed to the fast consumption of difluorocarbene by KOH at the oil-water interface (for the proposed mechanism, see section 5 in Supplementary data). A dilution of TMSCF2Br with CH2Cl2 would slow down the formation of difluorocarbene; however, the utilization of difluorocarbene would be enhanced due to the relative enrichment of the phenolate anion and pentacoordinate silicate into the organic phase, which would reduce the contact between difluorocarbene and KOH correspondingly."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, we have shown that the difluoromethylation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols by using TMSCF2Br as the difluorocarbene reagent and KHF2 as a mild activator can proceed in water. Although no organic solvent is used, the liquid alcohol and TMSCF2Br constitute the organic phase. On the one hand, for primary and secondary alcohols, compared with the reaction in a combined solvent system of CH2Cl2/water, the reaction in water proceeded faster due to the enhanced concentration of the reactants in the organic phase. On the other hand, less water can improve the conversion of TMSCF2Br to difluoromethyl ethers, although the reaction can be retarded when the dissolution of KHF2 is not sufficient. In the case of solid alcohols, dissolving the alcohols with a minimum amount of organic solvent such as CH2Cl2 is necessary. Importantly, by probing the influence of the amount of water on the difluoromethylation of alcohols with TMSCF2Br, we have identified a new mechanism for the generation and reaction of difluorocarbene in a biphasic oil-water system, which is revealing for the design of new difluorocarbene reagents and the development of new difluorocarbene reactions."
7,Experimental section,"The typical procedures for the difluoromethylation of primary alcohols (liquid) are as follows: Into a 10-mL plastic tube containing 2-phenylethanol (1a) (61 mg, 0.5 mmol) and KHF2 (156 mg, 2.0 mmol) was added water (0.3 mL). After stirring for a while to dissolve KHF2, TMSCF2Br (2) (156 μL, 1.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then diluted with CH2Cl2 (2.0 mL) for the determination of the 19F NMR yield. For characterization of the product, the above reaction mixture was further treated with water (2.0 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 2.0 mL). The organic layers were combined and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (heptane/CH2Cl2, 5:1, v/v) to afford the desired product 3a in 77% yield (66 mg). The procedures for the difluoromethylation of other alcohols, the characterization data of isolated compounds, and the 1H, 19F, and 13C NMR spectra are presented in Supplementary data."
