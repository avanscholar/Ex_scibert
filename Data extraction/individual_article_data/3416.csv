0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FAL, C5H6O2) can be synthetized from the hydrogenation of furfural and widely employed in fine chemical and polymer industries [1]. FAL is used as an additive or solvent in the production of thermostatic resins, foundry binders, adhesives for plywood and furniture, fibres, rubbers-resins and farm chemicals [1–3]. Also, FAL can be used as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of lysine, plasticizer, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and among other applications [4–6]. During the preparation and application of FAL, there is an inevitable production of different concentrations of FAL aqueous solutions. Taking into consideration the toxicity of FAL and its adverse environmental impacts [7,8], separation of FAL from wastewater using economical and effective method is highly important. Liquid-liquid extraction is considered as a beneficial separation process and can be applied in industry and economical usage [9]. In the design and evaluate industrial units for FAL extraction processes, reliable liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) data is vital. The investigations on LLE of FAL extraction with different organic solvents have been undertaken. Wongsawa et al. [7] investigated {water + FAL + organic solvents (MIBK, ethyl acetate, furfural or n-butanol)} ternary systems at 298.15 K. Wannachod et al. [8] also collated the research on LLE data for the (FAL + water + n-butanol + NaCl) systems. Salt effect on the water-FAL-furfural equilibrium system at 298.15 K was studied by Kunthakudee [10]. For the effective separation of FAL from aqueous solution by liquid-liquid extraction, more research such as suitable solvents needs to be assembled [11–13]. In this work, isopropyl ether (DIPE), tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), and methyl isobutylcarbinol (MIBC) were selected as solvents for the extraction of FAL from aqueous solutions. Meanwhile, the results of LLE measurements of {water + FAL + solvent (DIPE, MTBE, CH2Cl2, MIBC)} ternary systems at T = 298.2 K and p = 101.3 kPa were analysed and discussed. As yet no LLE data on the studied systems have been reported in the available literature. The distribution coefficients (D) and separation factor (S) were evaluated from the LLE data. Othmer-Tobiass (O-T) [14], Hand [15], and Bachman [16] equations were used for the reliability of the LLE data. Furthermore, the LLE data were regressed using both the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL) [17] and Universal Quasi-Chemical (UNIQUAC) [18] models."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All details of the chemical reagents used in this work are presented in Table 1 . Furfuryl alcohol (FAL), isopropyl ether (DIPE), tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), and methyl isobutylcarbinol (MIBC) were obtained commercially from Aladdin reagent company. Distilled water obtained in our laboratory. The purity of all chemicals reagents were determined through gas chromatography (GC) and no appreciate peaks of impurities were detected. All these chemical reagents were used without any further purification."
3,Apparatus and procedures,"2.2 Apparatus and procedures All LLE experiments were measured at 298.2 K and 101.3 kPa. The details about equipment apparatus and experimental method were described in previous work [19–21]. During the mixture of water, FAL, and solvents were loaded into the glass cell, the volume for water and solvents were usually fixed, and FAL was increased correspondingly. The change interval was 2–5 mL each time [22,23]. All ternary mixtures were vigorously agitated at 298.2 K for more than 2 h, stood for 18 h to reach the phase equilibrium. The extension of agitating and settling time were found to have −1 a thermostatic bath with precise to ±0.1 K. Concentration of FAL in aqueous phase and organic phase were analysed by gas chromatograph (GC6820, Agilent Technologies) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Porapak N column (3 mm × 3 m). The detecting temperature and injecting temperature were set at 523.2 K for the duration of the analysis. The initial column oven temperature was 373.2 K and kept for 1 min, then ramped to 523.2 K at a rate of 20 K·min−1 and held for 1 min. Hydrogen (with the purity of 99.999%) was adopted as the carrier gas with the flowrate was 60 mL·min−1. The internal standard method was applied to determine the composition, and the internal standard substance was 1,4-dioxane. Each sample was measured at least three times and the mean value was adopted as the concentration data in this work. Furthermore, using the GUM standard and associated guidelines [24–26] calculate the standard uncertainty of the two separate phase composition, and the values estimate to better than ±0.0035 in mass fraction."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Experimental LLE results,"3.1 Experimental LLE results The experimental LLE data of {water + FAL + solvent (DIPE, MTBE, CH2Cl2 and MIBC)} ternary systems at 298.2 K and 101.3 kPa are shown in Table 2 . The subscript 1, 2, and 3 represent water, FAL, and solvent, the superscript I and II denote the organic phase and the aqueous phase, respectively. The triangle phase diagrams are presented in Figs. 1–4 . The phase diagrams shown only one liquid pair (water + organic solvents) is partially miscible and two liquid pairs (FAL + water or organic solvents) are completely miscible, which indicates that those studied systems are classified as Treybal’s I [7]. The measured mutual binary solubility data of water-DIPE, water-MTBE, water-CH2Cl2, and water-MIBC obtained in this work are compared to the literature values [27–42], and the results are shown in Table 3 . From the Table 3, it can be seen that the measured solubility in this work is consistent with literature data. The slight deviations related to the use of different methods and procedures or accuracy limitation, and the precision of the measurements [43]. The distribution coefficients (D) and separation factor (S) were evaluated by the following equations [44,45]: (1) D = w 2 I / w 2 I I (2) S = w 2 I / w 2 I I / w 1 I / w 1 I I where w refers to mass fraction, the superscripts I and II denote the organic phase and the aqueous phase, and subscripts 2 and 1 stand for FAL and water, respectively. The experimental distribution coefficients (D) and separation factors (S) are listed in Table 2. For the investigated ternary systems, the values of D and S are greater than 1, which indicated that extraction of FAL from aqueous solution is feasible by these solvents. Moreover, the D and S values versus the mass composition of FAL in aqueous phase and compared with the data of other extractants (MIBK, n-butanol) in the Wongsawa’s work, as plotted in Figs. 5 and 6 . The similar systems using MIBK, ethyl acetate, furfural, and n-butanol for FAL separation from aqueous solution were reported by Wongsawa et al. [7]. From the literature report, MIBK has the highest separation factor among ethyl acetate, furfural, and n-butanol solvents. As can be observed from Figs. 5 and 6, the D values of the solvents studied in this work are reasonable in comparison with MIBK and n-butanol, the S values of DIPE and CH2Cl2 are higher than MIBK and n-butanol, which indicated that DIPE and CH2Cl2 have excellent FAL extraction ability from aqueous solution. The experimental LLE data was validated by the Othmer-Tobias [46], Hand [47], and Bachman equations: (3) ln 1 - w 3 I / w 3 I = a + b ln 1 - w 1 I I / w 1 I I (4) ln w 2 I / w 3 I = a + b ln w 2 I I / w 1 I I (5) w 3 I = a + b w 3 I / w 1 I I where w, I and II are the same with those in the Eqs. (1) and (2). The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 denote water, FAL, and organic solvent, respectively. a and b are the regressed parameters in Othmer-Tobias, Bachman and Hand equations. All the calculated fitting parameters and the regression coefficients (R2) of the Othmer-Tobias, Bachman, and Hand equations are listed in Table 4 and the corresponding linearity plots are presented in Figs. 7–9 . The R2 being approximately unity and the linearity of the plots indicated that the experimental LLE data have a good consistency [9]."
6,Correlation of LLE data,"3.2 Correlation of LLE data The experimental LLE values were correlated using the thermodynamic models of NRTL and UNIQUAC. The UNIQUAC structural parameters r and q of pure component were derived from the database of Aspen Plus software (Version 8.4) and listed in Table 5 . The optimum binary interaction parameters of the NRTL and UNIQUAC models were calculated by minimizing the objective function (OF) [48,49]: (6) O F = ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 w i j k e x p - w i j k c a l 2 where subscripts i, j and k denote to the components, phases, and tie-lines, and M is the number of tie lines; wexp and wcal denote to the experimental and calculated data. The non-randomness parameters aij of NRTL model was optimized and the recommended value was set 0.3, except for binary pair (water + MIBC) was set 0.2. The calculated binary interaction parameters from NRTL and UNIQUAC models are listed in Table 6 . The calculated LLE data by the two models are shown in Tables S1–S4 of the Supplementary data are also compared to experimental LLE data in Figs. 2–4. Meanwhile, the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) values were employed to assess the consistency of the difference between experimental and calculated data [48]: (7) R M S D % = 100 ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 w i j k e x p - w i j k c a l 2 6 M 1 / 2 The corresponding M, wexp , wcal , k, j, i are the same with those in the Eq. (6). The calculated RMSD% values are presented in Table 6. As can be seen from Table 6, the low RMSD% values (all smaller than 0.36%) for NRTL or UNIQUAC models demonstrate the ability of these models to represent the LLE data in the studied systems. In addition, the satisfying consistency results of the calculated LLE data and experimental LLE data shown in Figs. 2-4 further confirm the above conclusion."
7,Conclusions,"Experimental LLE data for the ternary systems {water + FAL + solvent (DIPE, MTBE, CH2Cl2 and MIBC)} were investigated at 298.2 K and 101.3 kPa. The high values of distribution coefficients and separation factors manifest that separation of FAL from its aqueous solution by those selected solvents in this work is feasible. The Othmer-Tobias, Bachman and Hand equations fitted well with experimental LLE data with the regression coefficients (R2) values are all close to 1. The experimental LLE results were correlated by the NRTL and UNIQUAC models, and the corresponding binary interaction parameters were obtained. The low RMSD% values show that the calculated data are in good agreement with the experimental data. The results indicate that NRTL and UNIQUAC models would be helpful for design and optimization of the separation FAL process in this work."
