0,Introduction,"With significant merits including ambient operation conditions, zero emission of harmful products, and readily available precursor, water electrolysis has been one of the most appealing technologies for hydrogen production, especially in the condition that electricity is generated from various renewable energy [1,2]. However, current electrolysis system supplies mere 45% of the world's hydrogen, which is far lower than the conventional steam reforming method [3]. A major roadblock to the widespread employment of this technology is that the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a kinetically slow process, with only the pricey Pt exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance, which dramatically increase the cost of electrolysis devices [4–7]. In this regard, there is an imminent necessity to explore Pt-free materials but with Pt-like HER activity [8–10]. Over the past decade, MoS2 has received lasting research interest in the field of electrocatalytic HER due to its unique 2D structure, earth abundance, and outstanding HER activity of edge sites validated by both theoretical (ΔG H = 0.08 eV) and experimental studies [11–15]. The limited number of active sites (basal planes that occupy the majority of MoS2 are inert) and semiconducting character, however, pose great challenges for conventional 2H MoS2 to replace Pt as a practical HER candidate [16]. To boost the catalytic ability of MoS2, several strategies have been widely developed. One strategy is to enlarge the interlayer distance, which can lower the hydrogen adsorption free energy on edge sites to closer to 0 eV and therefore make them more intrinsically active [17–19]. The second strategy is to transform the 2H phase to 1T phase through heteroatom doping or intercalation of lithium ions, which can improve the electrical conductivity of MoS2 by nearly 105 times and thus activate the inert basal planes [20–23]. The third strategy is to expose more active edge sites through structure engineering [24,25]. A representative work is that, by introducing inner stress, bulk MoS2 can break down into smaller pieces and this nano-sized MoS2 exhibits significantly improved HER performance than the original one [26]. On the other hand, the high theoretical capacity makes MoS2 a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries [27–29]. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurement reveals that, during the discharge process, MoS2 will first experience layer expansion and then phase transformation and finally fragmentation after triggering conversion reaction [30]. Therefore, the electrochemical HER performance of MoS2 is highly expected to be continuously tuned with sodium ions insertion and might be maximized at a certain potential. Nevertheless, to be best of our knowledge, seldom work has been devoted to examine the electrochemical HER response of this tuned MoS2 and the underlying structure-activity relationship. In this context, herein we thoroughly investigated the structure change of MoS2 upon sodium ions insertion and then correlated the changed structure with its HER activity. We found that the HER activity of MoS2 would gradually increase at the intercalation stage due to the expanded interlayer and phase transition, and reached a maximum at the early stage of conversion reaction due to the fragmentation of MoS2. When MoS2 was deep discharged to 0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na), it still maintains a high catalytic activity, which might be ascribed to the doping of sulfur into molybdenum oxide according to the theoretical calculation. The optimal MoS2 only required an overpotential of 161 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was 89 mV lower than the pristine MoS2. This work puts forward an effective method to regulate the electrochemical HER performance of MoS2, which may find wide application in other layered materials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S), concentrated sulphuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sodium metal was purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) solution in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DIGLYME) was purchased from Suzhou Dodochem Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China). Pt/C (20 wt. % Pt) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the chemicals were directly used as received without purification. Carbon cloth (CC) was obtained from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Deionized water with a resistance of 18.2 MΩ cm used throughout all experiments was produced through a water purification system."
3,Preparation of MoS2/CC,"2.2 Preparation of MoS2/CC In a typical synthesis, 40.4 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O and 63.4 mg of CH4N2S were simultaneously added in 75 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring for 10 min. Next, 15 mL of the as-prepared clear solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave of 25 mL capacity and a piece of CC (1 cm × 3 cm), which had been cleaned with deionized water and ethanol, was immersed into this solution. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and heated in an electric oven at 220 °C for 24 h. After that, MoS2/CC was obtained after removing unstable products and finally being vacuum dried at 60 °C. Note that the loading amount of MoS2 on CC is determined to be 1.1 mg cm−2."
4,Sodium electrochemical tuning of MoS2/CC,"2.3 Sodium electrochemical tuning of MoS2/CC The CR2016-type coin cell was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox using Na foil as both the counter and reference electrode and the as-grown MoS2/CC as the working electrode. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGLYME solvent was used as the electrolyte and a glass fiber membrane (Whatmann) was used as the separator. Subsequently, the sodium ions insertion process was carried out by discharging the MoS2/CC samples to different potentials (vs. Na+/Na) at a constant current density of 0.05 mA cm−2. To obtain MoS2-X/CC (where X denotes the cut-off potential), the discharging products were carefully washed with plenty of alcohol and deionized water to remove the residual electrolyte and possible formed Na2S."
5,Instruments and measurements,"2.4 Instruments and measurements The morphology of MoS2-X/CC samples was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SU8010, Hitachi). Microstructural analysis was conducted using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F30). Crystal structure evolution of MoS2 was examined using a powder X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the X-ray source. Phase transition was monitored on a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer with a laser of 532 nm and a home-made testing cell. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi) with Al Kα radiation as the excitation source was used to determine the surface elemental state evolution of MoS2. The resulting spectra were calibrated against the C 1s photoemission line at 284.6 eV. SP7820 gas chromatography with Ar as the carrier gas was utilized to measure the amount of H2 generated during electrolysis."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature in a typical three-electrode electrochemical station (CHI 660E) consisting of a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and MoS2-X/CC as the working electrode. Multiple cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were performed until stable before linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. All LSV polarization curves were IR-corrected and the potentials initially measured versus SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale through the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. SCE) + 0.242 V + 0.059 V × pH. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out at an overpotential of 260 mV with a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV. The long-term stability was tested at the potential of -0.23 V (vs. RHE) for 75,000 s. Double-layer capacitance was measured in a non-Faradaic region of the voltammogram at different scan rates. For estimating the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), a general specific capacitance of C s = 0.035 mF cm−2 was used [31]."
7,Computational details,"2.6 Computational details DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) with the Projector Augment Wave (PAW) potential. A spin-polarized GGA PBE functional and an energy cutoff of 520 eV for all-electron plane-wave basis set were adopted. MoO3 was simulated using a surface model of p (2 × 2) unit cell periodicity. The Brillouin zones were sampled with (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack mesh. The conjugate gradient algorithm was used for optimization. The convergence threshold was set at 1 × 10−4 eV in total energy and 0.05 eV/ Å in force on each atom. The adsorption energy change (ΔE abs) was determined as follows: ΔE abs = E total − E sur − E H, where E total is the total energy for the adsorption state, E sur is the energy of pure surface, and E H is the energy of H. The free energy change (ΔG) for adsorptions were determined as follows: ΔG = ΔE abs + ΔE ZPE − TΔS, where ΔE ZPE is the zero-point energy change and ΔS is the entropy change. As the vibrational entropy of H* in the adsorbed state is small, the entropy of adsorption of 1/2 H2 is S H ≈ −0.5S 0H2, where S 0H2 is the entropy of H2 in the gas phase at the standard conditions. Therefore, the overall corrections were taken as in ΔG H* = E total − E sur − E H2/2 + 0.24 eV, where E H2 is the energy of H2 in gas phase."
8,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a schematically illustrates the preparation process of MoS2-X/CC (see the Experimental Section for details). The first step involved a facile hydrothermal growth of MoS2 on the CC with Na2MoO4·2H2O and CH4N2S as precursors. Subsequently, a sodium-ion half battery was assembled by employing the as-obtained MoS2/CC as the working electrode and Na foil as both the reference and counter electrode, which was then discharged at a current density of 50 μA cm−2 to different potentials to achieve MoS2-X/CC (Fig. S1a). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was first conducted to investigate the morphology evolution of MoS2 after sodium ions insertion. The pristine MoS2 is composed of numerous curved nanosheets with dimensions of hundreds of nanometers, which intertwine to produce a fluffy structure (Fig. 1b and S2a). Upon discharging MoS2 to 1.0 and 0.6 V (vs. Na+/Na), no distinct change of morphology is observed (Figs. 1c, d, S2b, and c). This is because when the cut-off potential is set to be above 0.3 V (vs. Na+/Na), the sodium ions intercalation mechanism is dominant, as can be seen from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve presented in Figure S1b. Intercalation of sodium ions mainly enlarges the interlayer distance of MoS2 and promotes its partial transformation from 2H phase to 1T phase (this will be proved in the later discussion) [32]. Therefore, the original morphology of MoS2 can be preserved. Though solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) film is inevitably formed for MoS2-0.6 (Figure S1b), its formation is believed to have no drastic effect in changing the morphology due to the fact that, at the potential of 0.6 V (vs. Na+/Na), the electrolyte decomposition is just initiated. Further sodiation to 0.3 V (vs. Na+/Na) induces the conversion reaction and the intermediate of NaxMoS2 starts to be reduced to Na2S and metallic Mo (Fig. S1b). As a result, the fluffy layered structure collapses and a densely-packed film is formed on the surface of CC (Figs. 1e and S2d). Deep discharging MoS2 to 0.1 and 0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na) keeps on substantially changing the morphology of MoS2, leading to generation of well-dispersed nanoparticles (Figs. 1f, g, S2e, and f). The above finding is well in line with the work of Wang et al., who had thoroughly studied the discharge behavior of MoS2 supported on a freestanding carbon paper electrode [33]. To further track the structure evolution of MoS2, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were also carried out. As shown in Fig. 2 a, besides two broad and strong peaks from CC, two weak peaks, located at 14.4° and 33.6°, respectively, are observed in the XRD pattern of MoS2/CC, suggesting the poor crystalline quality of MoS2. These two peaks are ascribed to (002) and (100) planes of hexagonal 2H MoS2 (JCPDS card No. 24-0513). For MoS2-1.0/CC, the (002) peak shifts to a lower angle of 13.8° (Fig. 2b), indicating that the interlayer spacing has been enlarged from 0.615 nm to 0.64 nm according to Bragg's equation ( n λ = 2 d sin θ ), which can also be confirmed by HRTEM results (Fig. 2d and e). Discharging MoS2 to 0.6 V (vs. Na+/Na) will not further increase the interlayer distance (Fig. 2f). However, no XRD peaks belonging to MoS2 can be seen in the XRD pattern of MoS2-0.6/CC, which might be linked to the introduction of structure disorder due to more Na ions insertion [30]. Since the conversion reaction can break materials to sub-10 nm [34], which is too small to be detected, there is also no XRD peaks related to Mo-based materials for MoS2-0.3/CC, MoS2-0.1/CC, and MoS2-0.01/CC. Detailed information of structure evolution at different stage of conversion reaction can be found in HRTEM. The layers of MoS2 are gradually broken (Fig. 2g) and nanoscale crystalline domains are created for MoS2-0.1/CC and MoS2-0.01/CC (Fig. 2h and i). Close inspection suggests that the crystalline domains are indexed to molybdenum oxides, which are formed due to the oxidation of discharge products of metallic Mo (also observed in the latter XPS measurement). In addition, in situ Raman spectroscopy was performed to scrutinize the phase transition of MoS2. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Raman spectrum of MoS2/CC electrode at open circuit voltage (OCV) exhibits seven peaks in the range of 90–2000 cm−1. The five Raman peaks centered at 417 (more clear in Fig. S3), 577, 752, 1346, and 1596 cm−1 are also observed in sodiated MoS2 samples, among which the former three peaks come from the feedback of the in situ Raman electrolytic cell (Fig. S4) and the latter two peaks are ascribed to the D band and G band signal from the carbon support. The remaining two Raman peaks at 379 and 405 cm−1 correspond to the typical in-plane E 2 g 1 and out-of-plane A1g vibration modes of 2H-MoS2, respectively [35]. When the cell is discharged to 1.3 and 1.0 V (vs. Na+/Na), there is a continuous decay of 2H-MoS2 Raman peaks without showing up any new peaks, suggesting no phase transition occurs during this stage. However, 2H MoS2 starts converting to 1T MoS2 at 0.8 V (vs. Na+/Na), evidenced from the appearance of three new peaks at 155, 215, and 332 cm−1 that can be ascribed to the J1, J2, and J3 vibration modes of 1T MoS2 [36] and the disappearance of 2H-MoS2 Raman peaks. These characteristic peaks of 1T MoS2 become more pronounced as the discharge process proceeds. These changes indicate that, with introducing more sodium ions and electrons, hexagonal 2H MoS2 can be transformed to tetragonal 1T MoS2. Due to the gradual decomposition of MoS2 into Mo and Na2S, the intensities of 1T MoS2 Raman peaks decrease and finally disappear at the end of conversion reaction. The phase transition of MoS2 after sodium ions insertion can also be confirmed by running X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 a, Mo 3d spectra of pristine MoS2 and MoS2-1.0 can be deconvoluted into four peaks. The two prominent peaks at 229.3 and 232.4 eV (green curves) are attributed to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 components of 2H MoS2, respectively [37], while the two weak peaks at 232.7 and 235.8 eV (purple curves) are related to Mo6+, which may be produced due to the incomplete sulfidation of MoO4 2−. In the case of MoS2-0.6, additional two peaks located at 228.6 and 231.8 eV, which are characteristic peaks of 1T MoS2, are detected [38]. With a decrease of potential from 0.6 V to 0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na), the 1T phase content will first increase from 9.2% to 31.4% and then decrease to zero, which is consistent with the Raman analysis. These results further corroborate the successful phase transformation of MoS2 within a certain period of time during the discharge process. Note that, for MoS2-0.01, there is a marked rise in the proportion of the composition of Mo6+ and decrease in that of Mo4+. The decrease in the content of Mo4+ can be easily understood because we have mentioned that MoS2 has been converted to Mo at this potential. The emergence of Mo6+ is ascribed to, we propose, the oxidation of the formed metallic Mo during the repeated washing and drying process for sample preparation. The oxidation of discharge products can also be proved by the remarkably increased S4+ species, as presented in the XPS S 2p spectra of Fig. 3b. Furthermore, except for the conventional two peaks at binding energies of 161.9 and 163.1 eV, a new peak is also found for MoS2-0.1, which is usually assigned to the bridging disulfide S2 2−. This kind of S species is widely accepted as unsaturated sulfur edge, which is beneficial for promoting hydrogen evolution [39]. After resolving the structure evolution of MoS2 during the discharge process of sodium ions battery, the geometric HER activities of MoS2/CC and as-prepared MoS2-X/CC were then evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 via a typical three-electrode system. For better comparison, electrochemical measurements were also performed on commercial Pt/C, pure CC, and CC-0.1. CC-0.1 was prepared by discharging the pure CC to 0.1 V (vs. Na+/Na) under the same battery testing condition illustrated in Experimental Section. As shown in Fig. S5, both CC and CC-0.1 present negligible cathodic currents over the entire potential window and their contribution to HER thus can be neglected. Similar to previous reports [40–42], pristine MoS2 exhibits mediocre HER activity, requiring a large overpotential (η 10) of 250 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2. With gradual insertion of sodium ions, the HER activity of MoS2 can be continuously tuned (Figs. 4 a and S6). Specifically, discharging MoS2 to decreasingly lower potentials induces the right shift of LSV curves and the gradual decrease of η 10. At the cut-off potential of 0.1 V (vs. Na+/Na), the as-obtained catalyst shows the best HER performance and the value of η 10 is greatly reduced to 161 mV. However, further discharging MoS2 to 0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na) slightly impairs the catalytic activity and 10 mV larger overpotential is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Though our best catalyst still lags behind the benchmark Pt/C, such a significant improvement is very inspiring. The continuous change of HER activity is also verified by the Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. As shown in Fig. 4b, Tafel slope decreases from 89 mV dec−1 to 55 mV dec−1 and then increase a little bit to 57 mV dec−1, which indicates the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction mechanism predominates the HER process for all the catalysts. The change of Tafel slope may be correlated to modification in the electronic structure of MoS2 induced by sodium ions insertion. Electron transfer resistance obtained from EIS also experience the same change process, first decreasing from 10.8 Ω to 1.3 Ω and then increasing a little bit to 1.5 Ω, which indicates the MoS2-0.1 exhibits the fastest reaction rate (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, to obtain the specific activity of various samples, which can reflect the intrinsic activity, we divided the current by electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). In this work, ECSA was determined from the double-layer capacitance that was probed by cyclic voltammetry within a potential range from 0.04 V to 0.14 V (vs. RHE) at different scan rates (Figs. 4d, S7 and S8). As shown in Fig. S9, the intrinsic activity of MoS2 displays the same change trend as its geometric activity. Combined with the foregoing structural analysis, we try to figure out the reason that can account for the continuous change of HER performance of MoS2 after sodium ions electrochemical tuning. Previous DFT calculation has demonstrated that, with an increase of 0.037 nm in interlayer spacing of MoS2, a decrease of ~0.05 eV of hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy can be detected [43]. Therefore, the slight increase in HER activity of MoS2-1.0 in comparison with pristine MoS2 is ascribed to the enlarged interlayer distance. Since 1T MoS2 has a much better conductivity than 2H MoS2, further increase in HER activity is attributed to the formation of 1T MoS2. When MoS2 was discharged to 0.3 V and 0.1 V, its ECSA had increased by near two times due to the fragmentation of MoS2 after triggering conversion reaction. Therefore, the much better activity of MoS2-0.3 and MoS2-0.1 can be mainly explained by their much larger ECSA. In addition, their better intrinsic activities, which might be induced due to introduction of more defects, also make a contribution. For MoS2-0.01, it still maintains a high HER activity, which is even better than that of pristine MoS2. This is very strange, because molybdenum oxides usually present very bad HER performance. To understand this phenomenon, we take MoO3 as a model and investigate if doping S into its structure can optimize the hydrogen adsorption (Why consider S doping? Because a small portion of S can be found in XPS spectrum). Clearly in Fig. S10, the S-doped MoO3 has an optimizedΔGH of −0.1 eV, which is close to that of Pt and superior to pristine MoS2 with a ΔGH of as high as 2.2 eV. This calculated result indicates that the S-doped MoO3 can possess a higher HER activity. Finally, we resort to gas chromatography (GC) to examine the generated hydrogen amount. As shown in Fig. S11a, the Faradaic efficiency of our best catalyst (MoS2-0.1) approaches the ideal value of 100% by comparing the experimentally determined and theoretically calculated amount of H2, indicating the effective utilization of electrical energy for hydrogen evolution. Constructing a stable catalyst is of vital importance for its practical application. In this regard, the sodiated MoS2 is further explored at a fixed potential of −0.23 V (vs. RHE) for their long-term stability. Unfortunately, only 60.49% and 41.79% of initial current after 75,000 s is achieved for MoS2-0.1 and MoS2-0.01, respectively (Fig. S11b). This is most likely to be ascribed to the poor interaction between the catalyst and the substrate due to the fragmentation caused by deep discharge. For MoS2-0.3, though there is a slight decrease in current before 7500 s, the current gradually increases to 104% of initial current in the end, demonstrating its excellent stability."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we introduced a novel method to continuously tune the HER activity of MoS2 via insertion of sodium ions. Various characterization techniques, such as SEM, XRD, HRTEM, in-situ Raman, and XPS, demonstrated that the structure of MoS2 would experience huge change at different cut-off potentials. In addition, by combining structure analysis and electrochemical measurements, the possible structure-performance relationship was established. Our best catalyst only required an overpotential of 161 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which might inspire the wide application of this Na electrochemical tuning method."
