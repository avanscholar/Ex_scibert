0,Introduction,"Multifunctional reactors are single pieces of equipment in which, besides the reaction, other functions are carried out simultaneously. The other functions can be a heat, mass or momentum transfer operation and even another reaction [1]. These multifunctional reactors make the process more efficient and compact which result in large savings in the operational and capital costs [2,3]. A multifunctional reactor can be used, for example, for coupling exothermic and endothermic reactions. In it, an exothermic (combustion) reaction is used as the heat-producing source to drive the endothermic reaction(s) [4]. The efficient coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions in a single vessel reduces the thermal losses associated with the supply of heat to the energy intensive endothermic processes and reduces the capital and operational costs [2]. Since the exothermic and endothermic reactions take place simultaneously in the same fixed-bed reactor, the equipment size can be remarkably reduced and the utilization efficiency of energy and resources can be significantly improved. A variety of coupling schemes have been reported in the literature [5–9]. The FTS exothermic reaction is coupled with an endothermic reaction to reduce the thermal losses. Dehydrogenation is an attractive endothermic reaction for coupling with FTS, because dehydrogenation reaction is highly endothermic and produces hydrogen."
1,Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS),"1.1 Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) Production of clean fuels by the conversion of synthesis gas into liquid products using FTS attracts increasing attention. The catalytic synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO and H2 mixtures leads to a large variety of products such as paraffins, olefins, alcohols and aldehydes. The most desired products are those with low methane, low oxygen, high alkene/alkane ratio and high C5 + content [10]. The new GTL process based on a single stage fixed-bed FTS is developed in Iran in the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI) to produce high octane and low sulfur gasoline. In this process, the modified bi-functional Fe-HZSM5 catalyst is used [11]. Ahmadi Marvast et al. [12] considered a water-cooled fixed-bed reactor with a length of 12m. The simulation results show a considerable change in temperature and concentration profiles over 7m reactor length. Rahimpour et al. [13–17] performed several investigations to increase the performance of FTS reactor. Espinoza et al. [18,19] proposed the application of hydrophilic membranes to enhance the productivity in FTS reactors. Furthermore, Unruh et al. [20] proposed the application of hydrophilic membranes to enhance the CO2 conversion over WGS of Fe-based catalysts to long-chain hydrocarbons. Focusing on H2O perm-selective membranes under FT conditions, Zhu et al. [21] synthesized a new hydrophilic zeolite membrane."
2,Hydrogen,"1.2 Hydrogen Hydrogen is an excellent clean fuel for the future because of its high conversion and nonpolluting nature, producing only water during its reaction with oxygen [22]. Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier which is considered for future transport, such as automotive applications. Therefore, storage of hydrogen is one of the key challenges in developing hydrogen economy. The relatively advanced storage methods such as high-pressure gas or liquid cannot fulfill future storage goals. Chemical or physically combined storage of hydrogen in other materials has potential advantages over other storage methods [23]. Hodoshima et al. [24–26] studied the system of decalin dehydrogenation/naphthalene hydrogenation as a hydrogen source for fuel cell vehicles using a liquid-film type reactor at around 210°C with carbon-supported Pt and Pt–Re composite catalysts."
3,Dehydrogenation of decalin,"1.3 Dehydrogenation of decalin The combination of cycloalkane/cycloalkene systems, such as the decalin/naphthalene system, has been proposed as an effective way to produce hydrogen. Cyclohexane and decalin were first investigated for the dehydrogenation to produce H2. The product of decalin dehydrogenation, naphthalene, is environmentally favorable in comparison with benzene [27], thus it is more applicable for hydrogen production. A rigorous kinetic model was proposed which was a valid tool for the scale up of this process and a guide for operation [27]. Froment et al. [28] investigated the dehydrogenation of decalin for the production of pure hydrogen for fuel cell applications. Lázaro et al. [29] investigated different platinum catalysts supported on activated carbon for decalin dehydrogenation under several reaction conditions."
4,Membrane reactor,"1.4 Membrane reactor Palladium–silver thin wall tubes are produced by an innovative procedure based on the diffusion welding: these permeators are proposed for separating and producing high-pure hydrogen in both separators and membrane reactors [30]. Basile et al. [31] studied the simulation of a dense Pd-based membrane reactor for carrying out the methane, the methanol and the ethanol steam reforming (SR) reactions for pure hydrogen production. Gallucci et al. [32] compared the performance of different membrane reactor concepts; both fluidized bed and packed bed membrane reactors for ultra-pure hydrogen production via methane reforming. H-SOD membrane shows excellently ideal selectivity of water to hydrogen. In addition, the membrane demonstrates a good thermal and mechanical stability. It can be considered as a capable candidate for water separation in FTS which requires a high H2O/H2 perm-selectivity [33]. The exceptional property of H-SOD membrane in comparison with the other widely studied membranes [33,34] is 100% selectivity of water on the basis of molecular sieving in hybrid processes [35,33]. Moreover, sodalite demonstrates a good stability under the reaction conditions. Thus, H-SOD is a promising candidate for in situ H2O removal during FTS [35]. H2O removal during FTS has certain advantages. In case of Fe catalysts, oxidation and hydrothermal sintering lead to formation of an inactive magnetite core and losing the active surface area, respectively. Moreover, H2O inhibits the FT reaction rate and the WGS reaction can be displaced selectively in favor of CO by in situ H2O removal [36–38]. The WGS reaction is an equilibrium reaction. The WGS reaction can be displaced selectively in favor of CO by in situ H2O removal [33]. Since in situ H2O removal accelerates the reverse WGS reaction of CO2 with H2 towards CO, CO2 is utilized as a constituent in the synthesis gas which reacts in a subsequent step towards long-chain hydrocarbons [33]."
5,Objectives,"1.5 Objectives In this study, the operating conditions of TCMR configuration are optimized via DE method to maximize the gasoline yield in the exothermic side in addition to the hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and to minimize the required hydrogen molar flow rate in the recycled stream. Five decision variables including the exothermic and endothermic inlet temperatures and molar flow rates and the exothermic pressure are considered during the optimization process. Since all hydrogen is consumed in FTS reactions up to 1m left to the end of the reactor, the minimum required hydrogen molar flow rate in the recycled stream is optimized by DE method to compensate the hydrogen lack at the end of the reactor. The optimization results show that the gasoline and hydrogen yields increase considerably in the TCMR configuration under the optimized operating conditions. The optimization results are discussed extensively in the following sections."
6,Process description,"The characteristics of CR configuration were discussed extensively in the previous publication [11,12]. A schematic diagram of TCMR is depicted in Fig. 1 . The TCMR configuration is fabricated as a fixed-bed thermally coupled membrane reactor. The walls of the inner and the outer permeation sides are coated by water and hydrogen perm-selective membrane layers. The internal design of this reactor is such that the inner permeation side, the exothermic side, the endothermic side and the outer permeation side are fabricated in a tubular reactor, respectively. The synthesis gas flows through the exothermic side and the FTS reactions take place on catalysts’ surfaces while the produced water permeates through the H-SOD membrane layer to the inner permeation side. Sweeping gas (i.e., N2) flows through the inner permeation side and carries the permeated water. Since FTS reactions are highly exothermic, a great heat is generated. Therefore, decalin dehydrogenation reaction takes place in the endothermic side in order to absorb heat from the exothermic side and cool the exothermic side. Hydrogen and naphthalene are produced during decalin dehydrogenation reaction. The wall of the endothermic side is coated by the Pd–Ag membrane layer in order to permeate hydrogen through the membrane layer to the outer permeation side. Nitrogen flows as a sweeping gas in the outer permeation side and carries the permeated hydrogen. Some of the permeated hydrogen is separated from nitrogen and recycled to the exothermic side to be utilized in the FTS reactions. Moreover, some of the produced hydrogen in the endothermic side via decalin dehydrogenation reaction is separated from naphthalene and stored. The hydrogen stream is recycled to the exothermic side to compensate the hydrogen lack at the end of the reactor and to provide the required hydrogen for FTS reactions. The inlet molar flow rate to the exothermic side increases by the addition of the recycled stream (0.005mol/s H2) to the inlet feed where the H2/CO molar ratio increases to 1.4. The characteristics and input data for different sides of TCMR are listed in Tables 1 and 2 ."
7,Reaction scheme and kinetics,"The Fischer–Tropsch components include H2, CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, n-C4H10, i-C4H10 and C5 +. The following reactions take place in the exothermic side of TCMR: (1) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O (2) 2 CO + 4 H 2 → C 2 H 4 + 2 H 2 O (3) 2 CO + 5 H 2 → C 2 H 6 + 2 H 2 O (4) 3 CO + 7 H 2 → C 3 H 8 + 3 H 2 O (5) 4 CO + 9 H 2 → n - C 4 H 10 + 4 H 2 O (6) 4 CO + 9 H 2 → i - C 4 H 10 + 4 H 2 O (7) 6.05 CO + 12.23 H 2 → C 6.05 H 12.36 ( C 5 + ) + 6.05 H 2 O (8) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 The reaction rates for the first seven equations are as follows and the kinetic parameters are presented in Table 3 [12]. (9) R i = 0.27 k i exp ( − E i R T ) P CO m P H 2 n i = 1 , 2 , … , 7 Eq. (8), known as the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is reversible and the corresponding reaction rate would be different from others. The following equation is proposed by Wang et al. [39]: (10) R WGS = 15.7 exp ( − 45080 / R T ) ( P CO P H 2 O / P H 2 0.5 − P CO 2 P H 2 0.5 / K WGS ) 1 + 1.13 × 10 − 3 ( P CO P H 2 O / P H 2 0.5 ) The equilibrium constant for the WGS reaction, K WGS, can be calculated using: (11) K WGS = 5078.0045 T − 5.8972089 + 13.958689 × 10 − 4 T − 27.592844 × 10 − 8 T 2"
8,Decalin dehydrogenation reaction,"3.1 Decalin dehydrogenation reaction The dehydrogenation of decalin over Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 includes four reactions. Both cis-decalin (CDC) and trans-decalin (TDC) can be dehydrogenated to form tetralin and hydrogen. Tetralin can be further dehydrogenated to form the final product, naphthalene, thus generating more hydrogen. All of these reactions are reversible. This endothermic reaction has been used as a model in order to present the recuperative coupling process. The reaction scheme for the dehydrogenation of decalin is shown [28]: The overall reaction of these two series reactions can be presented as follows: (13) Decalin ↔ Naphthalene + 5 Hydrogen The dehydrogenation rates of decalin on the Pt active sites can be written as [28]: (14) r 1 = k r 1 K TDC P TDC / Δ 4 (15) r 2 = k r 2 K CDC P CDC / Δ 4 (16) r 3 = k r 3 K TT P TT / Δ 3 (17) r 1 ′ = k r 1 ′ K TT K H 2 P TT P H 2 3 / Δ 4 (18) r 2 ′ = k r 2 ′ K TT K H 2 P TT P H 2 3 / Δ 4 (19) r 3 ′ = k r 3 ′ K NP K H 2 P NP P H 2 2 / Δ 3 (20) Δ = 1 + K CDC P CDC + K TDC P TDC + K TT P TT + K H 2 P H 2 + K NP P NP For the rate coefficient: (21) k i = A i exp ( − E i / R T ) For the adsorption constant (22) K i = A i exp ( − Δ H i / R T ) Table 4 lists the 20 parameter estimates generated by Froment et al. [28]."
9,Mathematical model,
10,Fixed-bed thermally coupled membrane reactor,"4.1 Fixed-bed thermally coupled membrane reactor A heterogeneous one-dimensional model including a set of coupled energy and mass balances as well as kinetics’ equations are taken into consideration. The following assumptions are made during the modeling of a fixed-bed thermally coupled membrane reactor. • The case is investigated under the steady-state condition. • Plug flow pattern is considered in each side. • One-dimensional heterogeneous model is considered. • Gases are assumed to be ideal. • Axial diffusion of water through the membrane is negligible in comparison with radial diffusion. • Ideal condition is assumed for H-SOD membrane (Ideal selectivity of water to hydrogen) [33]. • Axial diffusion of mass and heat are negligible compared with convection owing to the high gas velocity. • The chemical reactions take place on the catalyst particles surface exclusively. • The reactor is assumed to be adiabatic. • The reaction of decalin isomerization is ignored. As shown in Fig. 2 , the element with the length of Δz is taken into consideration. The required heat for decalin dehydrogenation reaction is provided by the generated heat of FTS reactions where heat transfers from the exothermic side to the endothermic side. Water and hydrogen permeate to the permeation side and the sweeping gas (N2) carries the permeated hydrogen and water. Heat transfers from the exothermic side to the endothermic side while mass transfers from exothermic/endothermic side to permeation side. The differential equations describing mass and energy balances in the axial direction of the fixed-bed thermally coupled membrane reactor are discussed in the following subsections. 4.1.1 Solid phase The mass and energy balances for the solid phase are obtained as follows: (23) a v c j k g i , j ( y i , j g − y i , j s ) + η r i , j ρ b = 0 (24) a v h f ( T j g − T j s ) + ρ b ∑ i − 1 N η r i , j ( − Δ H f , i ) = 0 where y i , j s , T j s and η are the solid phase mole fraction, solid phase temperature for component i in j side of reactor and the effectiveness factor, respectively. 4.1.2 Fluid phase The following mass and energy balance equations are developed for the fluid phase: (25) − F j A c , j ⅆ y i , j g ⅆ z + a v c j k g i , j ( y i , j s − y i , j g ) − β J H 2 A c , j − φ · J H 2 O = 0 (26) − F j A c C p j g ⅆ T j g ⅆ z + a v h f ( T j s − T j g ) ± π D i A c U ( T 3 g − T 2 g ) − β J H 2 A c , j ∫ T 3 T 4 C p ⅆ T − φ · J H 2 O ∫ T 1 T 2 C p ⅆ T = 0 where y i , j g and T j g are the fluid phase mole fraction and temperature for component i in j side of reactor, respectively. The energy equation consists of the heat transfer by convection and the heat exchanged between the fluid phase and solid phase. The positive sign of the third term is used for the exothermic side and the negative sign for the endothermic side. β and φ equal 1 and 0 for the endothermic and 0 and 1 for the exothermic side, respectively. The inner permeation side, the exothermic side, the endothermic side and the outer permeation sides are numbered from 1 to 4. J H 2 O and J H 2 are the water and hydrogen permeation rates, respectively. The boundary conditions are as follows: (27) z = 0 , y i , j g = y i 0 , j g , T j g = T j 0 g , P j g = P j 0 g j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , … where y i 0 , j g , T j 0 g and P j 0 g are the fluid phase mole fraction, inlet temperature of the j side of the reactor, and pressure at the entrance of the j side of the reactor, respectively."
11,Hydrogen permeation through Pd–Ag membrane,"4.2 Hydrogen permeation through Pd–Ag membrane In this study, the composite membranes are made of a 6μm thin layer of palladium–silver alloy. The membrane is deposited as a continuous layer on the outer surface of a thermo stable support. The flux of hydrogen permeation through the Pd–Ag membrane is expressed by the following experimental hydrogen permeation flux [40]: (28) J H 2 = A 0 exp ( − E a R T ) · ( P H 2 4 − P H 2 3 ) Ea = 29.16 [ kJ / mol ] Pe 0 = 1.12 × 10 − 5 [ mol m / ( s m 2 Pa 0.5 ) ] A 0 = Pe 0 / δ where δ is the membrane thickness."
12,Water permeation through H-SOD membrane,"4.3 Water permeation through H-SOD membrane The flux of water permeation through the H-SOD membrane, J H 2 O , depends on the water partial pressure difference between two sides of the membrane. (29) J H 2 O = A s V r · Q H 2 O · ( P H 2 O t − P H 2 O sh ) where Q H 2 O is water permeation and it is a specific property of the membrane. Q H 2 O is constant respect to temperature and the H2O permeance is in a range of 10−6 and 10−7 (mol/(sm2 Pa) [33]. Q H 2 O = 10 − 6 mol / ( s m 2 Pa )"
13,Pressure drop,"4.4 Pressure drop In order to calculate the pressure drop along the reactor, the Ergun momentum balance equation has been used as follows: (30) ⅆ P ⅆ z = 150 ( 1 − ɛ ) 2 μ u g ɛ 3 d p 2 + 1.75 ( 1 − ɛ ) u g 2 ρ ɛ 3 d p where the pressure drop is in Pa."
14,Auxiliary correlations,"4.5 Auxiliary correlations The heat and mass transfer between solid and fluid phase have been taken into consideration in TCMR modeling. Physical properties of the components are essential for the calculations. Therefore, the physical properties’ correlations are taken into consideration. The applied correlations used for physical properties, mass and heat transfer coefficient are listed in Table 5 ."
15,Optimization,"The aim of optimization is to find the values of decision variables which provide the maximum or minimum of one or more desired objectives. Without prior optimization of operations, manufacturing and engineering activities will not be as efficient as they are now. Optimization of chemical and related processes requires a mathematical model that describes and predicts the process behavior [41]."
16,Differential evolution (DE) method,"5.1 Differential evolution (DE) method DE method is an exceptionally simple, significantly faster and robust at numerical optimization and is more likely to find a function true global optimum [42]. Simple structure, ease of use, speed and robustness can be counted as DE advantages. It can be used for optimizing functions with real variables and many local optima [43]. The details of DE algorithm and pseudo code are available in literature [44,45]. The operating conditions of TCMR have been optimized using DE method. The strategy used in this optimization process was “DE/best/1/bin” and the number of population was NP=100. The best DE step size was F =1, and the Crossover Probability Constant was CR=0.8. DE method has been used in many processes to optimize the operating conditions [46–50]."
17,Objective function and constraints,"5.2 Objective function and constraints In this study, maximizing the gasoline yield in the exothermic side as well as the hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and minimizing the hydrogen molar flow rate of the recycled stream in TCMR configuration are considered in the objective function. The objective function is defined as follows: (31) F = Y C 5 + + y H 2 − F H 2 R Five decision variables including the inlet temperature of the exothermic side, T 02, the inlet temperature of the endothermic side, T 03, the inlet molar flow rate of the exothermic side (the sum of synthesis gas molar flow rate and hydrogen molar flow rate in the recycled stream), F 02, the initial molar flow rate of the endothermic side, F 03, the inlet pressure of the exothermic side, P 02, are considered during the optimization process. Since the temperature profile changes along TCMR and it has a direct effect on the reaction rates and catalyst activity, it is the main parameter along the exothermic and endothermic tubular reactor which controls the thermodynamic equilibrium. The endothermic side temperature is a controlling parameter which has a predominant effect on the endothermic production rates. Since the heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side depends on the ratio of the exothermic to endothermic side molar flow rates, these two parameters are selected as decision variables. The ranges of decision variables are: (32) 495 < T 02 < 620 K (33) 483 < T 03 < 553 K (34) 17 < P 02 < 23 bar (35) 0.03 < F 02 < 0.15 mol / s (36) 0.03 < F 03 < 0.15 mol / s The temperature of the exothermic side should be less than 620K to avoid catalyst deactivation and should be upper than 520K to satisfy the minimum temperature limit of high temperature Fischer–Tropsch (HTFT) synthesis reactions (520K). The pressure of the exothermic side can vary from 17 to 23bar [12,13]. Decalin dehydrogenation temperature is in the range of 483–553K [28]. Lower and upper bounds for the initial molar flow rate of the exothermic and endothermic sides have been selected with no prior intention. In order to heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side, the temperature of the exothermic side should be upper than that of the endothermic side. Thus, constraints are considered as follows: (37) 520 < T 2 < 620 K (38) 483 < T 3 < 553 K (39) T 2 > T 3 (40) F 02 = F H 2 R + F syn (41) H 2 conversion ( 1 − F H 2 final F H 2 feed ) < 1 In order to prevent hydrogen conversion from reaching one in TCMR, Eq. (41) is considered during the optimization process. Moreover, the minimum required hydrogen molar flow rate in the recycled stream should be determined to satisfy this constraint, because the hydrogen conversion reaches one in 1m left to the end of the reactor without the recycled stream. All constraints are considered during the optimization process. A penalty function method is used to eliminate the unacceptable results automatically. In this study, 105 is considered as the penalty parameter, however, this parameter depends on the order of magnitude of the decision variables. The objective function that should be minimized is: (42) OF = − F + 10 5 ∑ i = 1 7 G i where (43) G 1 = max ( 0 , ( T 2 − 620 ) ) (44) G 2 = max ( 0 , ( 520 − T 2 ) ) (45) G 3 = max ( 0 , ( T 2 − 553 ) ) (46) G 4 = max ( 0 , ( 483 − T 3 ) ) (47) G 5 = max ( 0 , ( T 3 − T 2 ) ) (48) G 6 = max ( 0 , ( F 02 − F H 2 R − F syn ) ) (49) G 7 = max ( 0 , ( − F H 2 final F H 2 feed ) ) The set of abovementioned differential-algebraic equations (DAE) are developed for TCMR modeling. The energy balances for the exothermic and endothermic sides and mass balances for the exothermic/endothermic side and permeation side of the reactor are developed. Moreover, these equations are coupled with non-linear algebraic equations of the kinetic model, transport property correlations and other auxiliary correlations. A backward finite difference approximation is applied to solve the set of equations."
18,Model validation,"The steady-state model validation is performed between the pilot plant data reported by RIPI and the mathematical modeling of TCMR. The TCMR modeling results and the corresponding observed data of the pilot plant are presented in Table 6 . A good agreement is observed between the modeling results and the pilot plant data. Therefore, this mathematical model performs well under the industrial conditions."
19,Results and discussion,"The operating conditions of TCMR configuration have been optimized via DE method. The optimization results are presented in Table 7 . The H2/CO molar ratio of the inlet feed varies by the addition of the recycled hydrogen and this ratio is reported in Table 7. The performance of TCMR configuration under optimized operating condition is investigated in the following figures: The decalin conversion in the endothermic side of optimized TCMR (OTCMR) configuration is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The conversions of cis- and trans-decalin and the total (the sum of two isomers) conversion are illustrated in this figure. CDC, TDC and total decalin conversions reach 98%, 84% and 88% at the end of OTCMR, respectively. Since the inlet feed consists of 23% CDC and 73% TDC, the CDC conversion at the outlet of the reactor is higher than TDC one. The molar flow rate of the endothermic side products is depicted in Fig. 3(b). The endothermic side products are hydrogen, naphthalene and tetralin while hydrogen has the highest molar flow rate (about 0.66mol/s). On the other hand, the naphthalene molar flow rate is 0.13mol/s and the outlet decalin molar flow rate is slight. The hydrogen molar flow rate at the outlet of OTCMR is five times higher than the naphthalene molar flow rate because the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to naphthalene is five. Tetralin molar flow rate is almost close to zero along OTCMR owing to complete consumption of tetralin and its conversion to naphthalene. Owing to the in situ hydrogen removal from the endothermic side, the hydrogenation of naphthalene does not take place and consequently decalin and tetralin are not produced by naphthalene hydrogenation reaction. The mole fractions of the endothermic side products are depicted in Fig. 3(c). Decalin mole fraction (i.e., the sum of cis- and trans-decalin) is very low and the tetralin mole fraction is almost close to zero at the end of OTCMR. Hydrogen and naphthalene mole fractions as the main products of the endothermic side are 0.815 and 0.16 and the remaining 0.025 belongs to decalin and tetralin. Fig. 3(a–c) shows that the hydrogen production rate is the highest among the endothermic side products which satisfies our objective function. A comparison between the gasoline yield in CR and OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 4 (a). The yield of gasoline as the main product of the exothermic side increases considerably in OTCMR in comparison with CR. A remarkable increase in the gasoline yield in OTCMR is due to coupled configuration which improves the heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side. Furthermore, the in situ water removal from the exothermic side enhances the heavy hydrocarbon products. The effect of the in situ water removal on the increase of heavier hydrocarbon production rate is more considerable than the one on lighter hydrocarbon production rate. As shown in Fig. 4(b), hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and gasoline yield in the exothermic side increase along OTCMR. The achievement of a considerably high hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and the gasoline yield in the exothermic side of OTCMR are the main superiority of this novel configuration to CR. The yield of the exothermic side products is depicted in Fig. 5. The methane yield in OTCMR is compared with the one in CR in Fig. 5 (a). The methane production rate increases at higher temperatures owing to its high activation energy. The methane production rate in OTCMR is considerably lower than the one in CR because the temperature of OTCMR is lower than CR mainly due to the coupled configuration and a good heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side. Since the reaction rates of products with high activation energy take place better at higher temperatures, the ethane, ethylene, and propane yield in OTCMR are remarkably lower than CR. As shown in Fig. 5(b)–(d), the ethane, ethylene and propane yield in OTCMR are 7%, 10% and 17% lower than the ones in CR. The normal butane and iso-butane yields along OTCMR are compared with the ones along CR in Fig. 5(e) and (f). The normal butane and iso-butane yields in OTCMR increase 13% and 17% more than the ones in CR, respectively. The production rate of butane in OTCMR increases with temperature decreasing owing to its lower activation energy than methane, ethane and propane. Moreover, the in situ water removal increases the production rates of normal and iso-butane because the in situ water removal has more considerable effect on increasing the heavy hydrocarbon yield than methane, ethane and propane yield. The yields of non hydrocarbon products of the exothermic side are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The CO2 yield in OTCMR is compared with the one in CR in Fig. 6(a). The CO2 yield in OTCMR decreases compared with CR mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, the in situ water removal from the exothermic side shifts the WGS reaction to the reactants side and CO2 is consumed and secondly, high activation energy of the WGS reaction decreases at low temperatures. The water yield along CR and OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 6(b). The water yield in OTCMR is lower than CR along 9 meters of the reactor however the water yield in OTCMR becomes higher than in CR the rest of the reactor. The gradually increasing trend of the water yield in OTCMR indicates that the reactions take place well along the reactor. The water yield increases abruptly at the beginning of CR (along 3m), however, it changes slightly along the rest of the reactor. In OTCMR, reactions take place gradually along the reactor owing to the improvement in the heat transfer along the reactor. In OTCMR, the water permeation rate through the H-SOD membrane layer is less than the water production rate while the reaction rates of heavy hydrocarbons increase by the improvement in the heat transfer and the in situ water removal. The water permeation rate is illustrated further in Fig. 9(a). The hydrocarbon production yield along the exothermic side of OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 7(a). The highest and the lowest yields are related to gasoline and ethylene. The gasoline yield is remarkably higher than the other hydrocarbon products yield. The selectivity of the exothermic side products for OTCMR and CR is depicted in Fig. 7(b). The selectivity of the endothermic side product is depicted in Fig. 7(c) and calculated as follows: (50) Selectivity the Exothermic side = mole of C - atom in product mole of CO consumed × 100 (51) Selectivity the Endothermic side = moles of product i formed moles of Decalin converted × 100 Hydrogen and CO conversions along CR and OTCMR (with and without recycled stream) are depicted in Fig. 8(a) and (b). The consumption rates of reactants in OTCMR increase considerably compared with CR owing to a decrease in the exothermic side temperature and the substitution of the cooling water by the endothermic reaction. Furthermore, the in situ water removal increases the conversion of reactants. The hydrogen and CO conversions in OTCMR increase 8.1% and 24% in comparison with CR. The hydrogen conversion reaches one along 1m left to the end of OTCMR without the recycled stream and the reactions encounter a hydrogen lack for proceeding. The hydrogen lack appears and no reaction takes place at the end of the reactor without the recycled stream. The minimum required hydrogen for FTS reactions that is recycled to the exothermic side to compensate the hydrogen lack is optimized by DE method and provided by the recycled stream. The hydrogen conversion reaches 99.5% at the end of OTCMR because the required hydrogen is provided by the recycled stream and its minimum molar flow rate is optimized. However, the required hydrogen is provided by the recycled stream and CO is reacted with H2 and consequently the CO conversion increases. The CO conversion in OTCMR with the recycled stream increases effectively compared with the one without the recycled stream. The water permeation rate through the H-SOD membrane layer along OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 9(a). The water permeation rate is zero at the inlet of OTCMR, however, it increases gradually along the reactor. The water permeation rate increases along OTCMR mainly owing to an increase in the water partial pressure difference between the exothermic and the inner permeation side. The amount of the produced water increases due to an increase in the in situ water removal which enhances the FTS reactions. However, the water permeation rate increases slightly at the end of the reactor owing to a decrease in the water partial pressure difference between two sides. The hydrogen permeation rate through the Pd–Ag membrane layer along OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 9(b). The hydrogen production rate and the hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and the hydrogen partial pressure in the endothermic side increase along OTCMR owing to a gradual increase in the dehydrogenation reaction. The hydrogen permeation rate increases in the inlet of the endothermic side and the hydrogen partial pressure increases in the outer permeation side. At the end of the reactor, the difference between the hydrogen partial pressure of the endothermic and outer permeation side decreases and the hydrogen permeation rate changes slightly. The in situ hydrogen removal from the endothermic side increases the production rates of naphthalene and hydrogen. It can be justified by the equilibrium reaction of decalin dehydrogenation in which the hydrogen removal shifts the reaction to the products side (naphthalene and hydrogen) according to the Le Chatelier’s principle. 3D plot of hydrogen recovery yield as a function of shell side pressure and the length of OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 9(c). As seen, the hydrogen recovery yield increases with decreasing the outer permeation side pressure because the hydrogen partial pressure difference increases. Consequently, the hydrogen permeation rate and hydrogen recovery yield increase by a decrease in the outer permeation side pressure. The hydrogen recovery yield can be calculated as follows [51]: (52) Hydrogen recovery yield = F H 2 outlet F Decalin feed The ideal value of hydrogen recovery yield equals 4 [51]. The hydrogen recovery yield at 1bar is about 2.19. The hydrogen recovery yield decreases to 3 with decreasing the permeation side pressure. The total hydrogen production is 2359mol/h while 1119.6mol/h (47.46%) hydrogen permeates through the Pd–Ag membrane layer. The temperature profile of the OTCMR configuration is illustrated in Fig. 10(a). The exothermic side temperature decreases abruptly at the beginning of OTCMR which slightly increases the endothermic side temperature. The most heat transfer takes place at the beginning of the reactor due to a high difference in the endothermic and exothermic sides’ temperatures. The endothermic side temperature increases at the beginning of OTCMR due to the heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side, however, it reaches its maximum and decreases at the rest of the reactor due to the increase in the reaction rate of decalin dehydrogenation. The exothermic side temperature decreases along OTCMR due to the heat transfer from the exothermic side to the endothermic side. The exothermic side temperature is almost higher than the endothermic side temperature and the exothermic side temperature reaches 520.36K at the end of the reactor. Lower temperature limit of HTFT reactions is satisfied during the optimization. The temperature profile of CR is higher than OTCMR. The abrupt increase in the temperature profile causes a hotspot at the entrance of the reactor. The heat transfer does not perform well and the temperature is constant along CR which implies that the reactor temperature reaches the cooling water temperature and becomes constant. In OTCMR, the reaction rates of endothermic and exothermic sides’ temperatures increase along the reactor owing to a good heat transfer between the exothermic and endothermic sides as a result of a substitution of the cooling water by the endothermic reaction. The exothermic side temperature as a function of the inlet endothermic side temperature and the length of OTCMR is depicted in Fig. 10(b). As seen, the decrease in the exothermic side temperature increases with decreasing the inlet endothermic side temperature and consequently more heat transfer takes place. However, the exothermic side temperature becomes lower than 520K (the lower limit of HTFT reaction); 538K is determined as the optimized inlet temperature of the endothermic side so that the limit of HTFT reaction in the exothermic side is satisfied. The effect of the variation of the inlet endothermic side temperature on hydrogen and decalin mole fractions is depicted in Fig. 10(c). The hydrogen mole fraction increases while decalin mole fraction decreases with increasing the inlet endothermic side temperature. However, increasing of the endothermic side temperature encounters some limitations. The heat transfer between the endothermic and the exothermic sides decreases with increasing the inlet endothermic side temperature. According to Fig. 10(b), the heat transfer between the exothermic and the endothermic sides does not perform well at high temperatures of the inlet endothermic feed and the exothermic and endothermic temperatures are equal in the most length of the reactor. Therefore, 538K is not only the maximum temperature limit of the inlet endothermic feed to maximize the hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side but also it is the minimum limit of the endothermic side temperature to maximize the heat transfer between two sides and not to allow the exothermic side temperature to be lower than 520K. In fact, the most important parameter in the optimization process is the inlet endothermic temperature."
20,Conclusions,"In this study, the operating conditions of a thermally coupled membrane reactor are optimized via DE method to maximize the gasoline yield and hydrogen mole fraction in the outlet stream of TCMR and to minimize the hydrogen molar flow rate in the recycled stream to the exothermic side. The modeling results demonstrate that no reaction takes place at 1m left to the end of the reactor without the recycled stream mainly due to a hydrogen lack. Therefore, the minimum required hydrogen molar flow rate (0.005mol/s H2) that should be recycled to the exothermic reaction side to compensate the hydrogen lack at the end of the reactor is optimized. Some decision variables are considered during the optimization process to investigate the performance of TCMR. Decalin dehydrogenation reaction is coupled with FTS reactions to improve the heat transfer between the endothermic and exothermic sides. Furthermore, the in situ hydrogen and water removals via Pd–Ag and H-SOD membrane layers shift the equilibrium reactions to the products sides (hydrocarbons and hydrogen). Thus, coupling of FTS reactions by decalin dehydrogenation reaction improves the performances of TCMR and enhances the gasoline and hydrogen production rates. Operating under optimized conditions in OTCMR enhances simultaneously gasoline as the exothermic side product as well as hydrogen as the endothermic side product. Coupling of these two exothermic and endothermic reactions is cost effective from the economical viewpoints and increases the endothermic/exothermic reaction rates. The inlet endothermic feed temperature is optimized in order to maximize the heat transfer between the exothermic and the endothermic side and enhance the hydrogen mole fraction in the endothermic side and also not to allow the exothermic side temperature to be lower than 520K (the lowest temperature limit of HTFT reactions). Moreover, the optimization results show 14.28% increase in the gasoline yield in OTCMR compared with CR. Furthermore, the maximum produced hydrogen mole fraction from the endothermic side via decalin dehydrogenation reaction is about 81.49%. The optimum operating conditions as well as the advantages of the coupled endothermic reaction to FTS reactions (i.e., decalin dehydrogenation reaction) provides a deep insight into the performances of this novel configuration. However, experiments and cost evaluation of this novel configuration should be supplemented to such a theoretical modeling to have an entire judgment for future plant design."
