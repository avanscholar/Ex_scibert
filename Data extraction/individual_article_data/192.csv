0,Introduction,"Molecular hydrogen gathers a rising academic and industrial research attention as a potential fuel of the future. The ultimate research and technological goal over the last decades towards a sustainable coverage of the fuel demands is to generate H2 from renewable sources, and biomass can be regarded as the most abundant environmentally friendly feedstock [1,2]. Going a step further, it is of a great importance the production process also to be harmonized with the green chemistry perspectives, principally in regard to the power consumption. One of the most effective and desired H2 formation process is by direct catalytic water splitting, which can be achieved via various methods, and electrolysis is regarded as a promising candidate [3–5]. Even though it is feasible by this way to produce ultra-high purity H2, the economically viability of the process is still prohibitive due to the high cost of the required infrastructure and the high electrical power consumption. Thermochemical-catalytic process for H2 production, via for instance hydrocarbons steam reforming, is the most adapted pathway, together with pyrolysis or gasification of biomass [6]. A crucial drawback although is that in these processes, the temperature of reaction should be above ca. 700 °C. Considering all the above, it can be concluded that the most crucial drawback arises from the high energy demand of water splitting, a highly endergonic reaction (+237 kJ/mol) [7–9]. To overcome this high energy demand, the utilization of renewable sources can be the solution, with solar energy to be assumed among the best candidates [10–13]. Towards this direction, photocatalytic H2 generation approaches are regarded as an open field of glory and the utilization of a proper semiconductor photocatalyst, the most vital part [14–20]. In general, the absorbed electromagnetic irradiation leads to the photoexcitation of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), leaving behind a hole at the VB [21,22]. The electrons can reduce a compound, while the holes oxidize it [21,22]. TiO2 is known of having an enhanced photocatalytic capability [23]. A key drawback although is that the band gap of the predominant polymorphs (anatase, brookite, or rutile) is quite big (3.0–3.4 eV), so UV light photo-activate TiO2 more readily. Additionally, the lifetime of the photogenerated charges is too short, hence the most essential aspect in TiO2-based photocatalysts design is to confine the e −/h + recombination [24]. The deposition of nanosized phases on the titanium oxide particles or the incorporation of defected sites as well as the formation of composites with carbonaceous materials like graphene-derivatives are well-established approaches to overcome the above-mentioned limitations [11,25–32]. Especially for H2 photo-assisted generation, the TiO2-based materials using noble metals (particularly Pt or Au) for the surface decoration by nanoclusters are assumed as benchmark photocatalyst, although of a high cost [33–35]. Furthermore, the use of lower cost non-noble metals may also lead to similar photocatalytic efficiencies [22]. The addition of the metal nanoparticles induces a better light absorption efficiency and transfer of the photoinduced electrons, leading to a higher reducing activity and preventing the fast recombination of the photoinduced e −/h + pairs by their delocalization within the different in chemical nature parts of the nanomaterial and/or due to the incorporation of a Schottky barrier level between the valence and conduction energy levels [21]. Among the various non-noble metals utilized, copper showed to lead to the most pronounced photoreactivity enhancement. For instance, Castañeda et al. [18] showed that CuO supported on fluorinated TiO2 showed an elevated photocatalytic H2 production from a water/methanol solution, and Montoya et al. [36] that other metals, like Co2+ and Ni2+, can be also used towards this direction, although with a significant lower effect compared to Cu. Clarizia and co-workers showed that photo-deposition of zero-valent copper nanoparticles (of around 30 nm in size) on commercially available Degussa TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles had a clear positive influence on photocatalytic H2 generation upon irradiation by a high-pressure mercury vapor lamp (125 W), due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect [37]. They determined by utilizing a variety of organic compounds as the sacrificing agent that the best performance was achieved by glycerol, followed by methanol with a small difference in H2 production efficiency. J. Yu and J. Ran incorporated different amounts of Cu(OH)2 clusters on P25 by precipitation, using copper nitrate as precursor. The modified materials showed a high rate of H2 formation upon irradiation of ultraviolet (365 nm) produced by four UV-LEDs (3 W), with the optimal loading to be 0.29 mol% of Cu(OH)2 [38]. The most followed synthetic approaches are based on precipitation, photo-deposition and conventional wet impregnation (WI) in which the minimum volume of a solvent is used in order to fill the pores of the material. Although, the latter results many times to inhomogeneous agglomeration of the copper clusters on the TiO2 surface and this had a negative effect on the availability of the active catalytic sites and on a faster catalyst’ deactivation [39]. The main objective of the present work was to design a novel and low-cost TiO2 based photocatalyst in order to eliminate the above-mentioned limitations of WI. Towards this direction, our nanocomposite's design strategy (Scheme 1 ) was focused on the uniform and homogeneous decoration of TiO2 P25 nanoparticles with ultra-nanometric size (< 4 nm) nanostructured oxide(s) of the earth-abundant 3d transition metal, copper. To achieve this, we established an ultrasound-assisted ultra-wet (US-UWet) impregnation synthetic protocol followed by moderate temperature calcination (400 °C) and using copper acetate as the source of Cu. Emphasis was given on studying the physicochemical features of the obtained nano-photocatalyst. Since our ultimately goal was the photocatalyst to be efficient for H2 production under low power light irradiation using methanol as sacrificing agent and to monitor qualitatively in real time the product gasses of the reaction, we built a simple photoreactor which had the LED light source immersed in the reaction dispersion and was connected directly to a GC-TCD. Last but not least, we explored the multifunctionality of our catalyst by studying its photocatalytic efficiency for the additives-free selective partial oxidation (SPOx) of two well established biomass derived model platform chemicals/building blocks, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and benzyl alcohol (BnOH) to the value-added chemicals 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and benzyl aldehyde (PhCHO), respectively. HMF and BnOH are assumed as attracting industrially platform compounds that can be obtained from a widely available natural and renewable resources, biomass, and can be converted to added-value chemicals and products [40–43]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the chemicals and materials were used as received: TiO2 (P25, Evonik), copper(II) acetate monohydrate (abcr GmbH; ACS, 98–102%), HPLC grade acetonitrile (AcN, POCH Avantor Performance Materials Poland S.A), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, Chempur), 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF, Acros Organics), benzyl alcohol (BnOH), and benzyl aldehyde (PhCHO). MiliQ water was used in all cases."
3,Synthesis of the photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of the photocatalyst The P25-CuOx photocatalyst was prepared following an ultrasound-assisted ultra-wet (US-UWet) impregnation approach, using TiO2 P25 Evonik as the support. The synthetic protocol (Fig. 1 ) was the following: The calculated amount of copper(II) acetate monohydrate precursor (75 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of water by the use of 2 min ultrasonication. Then, the solution was used to impregnate 1.425 g of TiO2 P25. The obtained slurry was further sonicated inside a bath for 5 min (Sonorex-digital RC, 37 kHz, 120 W) and afterwards was dried for 16 h at 80 °C. The obtained bright bluish material was ground using an agate mortar towards a fine and homogeneous powder. The mass-yield up to this stage was 98.7% (1.4801 g of blue powder). Finally, the blueish powder was calcined in a muffle furnace under air at 400 °C for 4 h (heating ramp 10 °C/min). The finally obtained brown/gray material is referred to as P25-CuOx. The solid yield of the after calcination was found 97.1%. Assuming that the final decorated phase would be CuO, the targeted amount of CuO nanoparticles per mass of the final obtained catalyst was ~2 wt%. The pristine TiO2 P25 Evonik is referred to herein after as P25, while the calcinated under air at 400 °C counterpart as P25–400 (Fig. 2 )."
4,Materials characterizations,"2.3 Materials characterizations The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy for elemental mapping were carried out on a Model Titan Themis 60–300 equipped with a Cs image and probe corrector and a Super-X EDX system operating at 200 kV. The samples for the electron microscopy analysis were prepared by depositing drops of ultrasonicated suspension of the catalyst in ethanol onto 400 mesh gold grids coated with lacey carbon supports (EM Resolutions Ltd.) after the powder were dispersed in ethanol under ultrasonication. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (40 kV and 40 mA) equipped with a horizontal goniometer (details regarding the determination of the crystallographic parameters can be found elsewhere [44]). Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were obtained in the range from UVB up to near infrared by a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer which was equipped with an integrating sphere (Spectralon [poly(tetra- fluoroethylene)] as the baseline) [45,46]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system ESCALAB250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The base pressure in the system was below 5•10−10 mbar. The XPS spectra were acquired with a hemispherical analyzer with pass energies 20 eV and 200 eV for high resolution and survey spectra, respectively. The XPS spectra were generated by a twin Al/Mg anode non-monochromated X-ray sources operated at 15 keV and power 300 W. XPS spectra were peak-fitted using Avantage (Thermo Fisher Scientific) data processing software. For peak fitting Smart-type background subtraction was used. Quantification has been done using sensitivity factors provided by Avantage library. The surface pH was determined by dispersing 0.1 g of the powder to 50 mL deionized water inside a well-sealed glass beaker and measuring the pH after 16 h of stabilization after stirring in the dark."
5,Hydrogen photocatalytic generation and products analysis,"2.4 Hydrogen photocatalytic generation and products analysis 2.4.1 Specification of the H2 production reactor The herein designed homemade photocatalytic reactor for H2 production (H2-rctr) offered the capability to tune and optimize, apart from the basic catalytic parameters (catalyst loading, concentrations, mixing rpm, duration etc.), the following crucial experimental parameters as well: i) light source frequency and power ii) temperature of the reactor, iii) the inert gas and its flow rate, and iv) the volume of solvent/dispersion in which the reaction would take place, ranging from few mL and up to 50 mL. In addition, the position of light irradiation, i.e. either inside the dispersion or above its surface and as a result the light diffusion, could be easily controlled. The usage of the capillary type connectors eliminate the possibility of leakage, while they provide also protection against overpressure inside the reaction vessel or at the entire setup. The most important feature offered from the design was the capability to continuously monitor the reaction evolution in real-time, since the outlet gas flow was directly connected with a gas chromatographer. The entire setup of the H2-rctr with descriptions of all the parts can be seen in Figure s1. The reactor can be placed on a magnetic stirrer or be immersed inside an ultrasound bath. In this work, Argon was used at the inert gas with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The solvent was a mixture of water and methanol (as the sacrificing agent) of 1:1 vol ratio. In order to minimize the dead-volume of the headspace above the dispersion, the volume of the solution was 50 mL, and the amount of the powder was 50 mg (i.e., 1 g/L) for each photocatalytic experiment. The borosilicate glass tube, in which the light source/optical fibber was placed inside, was immersed within the solvent at 0.5 cm depth. The reaction vessel was covered with 3 layers of aluminum foil during all the tests. The light beam at the herein reported results was irradiated by a LED-based source (45 mW, Omikron laserage, LEDMODx.450.V2, Rodgau, Germany), emitting at 365 nm. The power of the irradiated light beam was determined as 95 W/m2, using a Photo-Radiometer (Delta OHM Model HD2302.0 LightMeter) equipped with a probe (Delta OHM, LP 471 UVA Probe, spectral range: 315–400 nm). The emission spectra of the utilized light beam can be found elsewhere [47]. 2.4.2 H2 production monitoring A gas chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 7820A GC-TCD) was used for the analysis of the product gasses/outlet stream from the H2-rctr. The GC parameters of the analysis protocol were oven temperature 60 °C (hold time 10 min), ramp to 110 °C (rate 25 °C/min) and hold time 2 min (total 14 min run time). For the herein reported results, the Ar flow where set at 20 mL/min using a mass flow controller (maximum up to 75 mL/min). The calibration curves were obtained by measuring mixtures of H2 with argon. Photolysis (PL) tests were also performed."
6,HMF and BnOH photooxidation and analysis methods,"2.5 HMF and BnOH photooxidation and analysis methods The materials’ photocatalytic activity for the selective partial oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and of benzyl alcohol (BnOH) to benzyl aldehyde (PhCHO) was evaluated using the photoreactor setup as can be seen in Figure s2. The initial concentration of HMF or BnOH was 1 mM in acetonitrile. 15 mg of the catalyst powder (1 g/L) and 15 mL of the HMF or BnOH solution (1 mM) were inserted to the glass vial and the light source was applied from the top using also a cap. The reaction was held under constant magnetic stirring (600 rpm) during the whole experiment. Prior to light illumination, stabilization/equilibration was established for 1 h in the dark under continuous stirring (600 rpm). Samples of 0.2 mL were collected for analysis after specific interval of time via the sampling port using a syringe (1.5 mL) and then were immediately filtrated by syringe filter (pore size of 0.20 µm) in order to be analyzed. The temperature was maintained stable at 30 °C during all the process using water bath. The utilized light source was the same UV-LED as above-mentioned. All the experiments were performed more than three times and the standard deviation/error was less than 3%. The oxidative efficiency of the materials in the dark was also explored, while photolysis tests were also conducted. The analysis of the samples for the BnOH photooxidation experiments was performed by a gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-2010) using a capillary column (ZB-5MS, 30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.5 μm film thickness). The chromatograms were obtained by injecting 1 μL of the samples with a split ratio of 8. The column temperature was set at 50 °C for 3 min and increased up to 300 °C at a rate of 9 °C/min with a final holding time of 2 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas. The concentrations were estimated using calibration curves (details can be found at the Supplementary Information). The product analysis in the case of HMF photooxidation was carried out on an Acquity Arc Waters HPLC instrument with 2998 PDA detector. HMF and DFF were well separated by a C18 Thermo scientific column (250×4.6 mm). The compounds were detected by a UV detector at 270 nm. The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and Mili Q water with 55:45 vol ratio. The flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min and the temperature of column oven was kept at 25 ᴼC. The retention time of HMF and DFF was 2.6 and 3.7 min, respectively. The concentration of HMF and DFF was determined by the external standard calibration method. The same formulas as above were sued for the calculation of the HMF, DFF, and FDCA concentrations."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical characterizations,"3.1 Physicochemical characterizations The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) image in Fig. 3 a revealed that the TiO2 P25 nanoparticles are decorated with nanoscaled copper-containing clusters (< 4 nm) with an average size of 1.8 nm (brighter spots indicative of the higher Z contrast of copper compared to Ti). The homogeneous deposition of the copper containing nanoclusters can also be observed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Fig. 3b-d). The chemical nature of the nanoclusters can be validated from the EDX elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 3e-i) in which copper derived spots are clearly observable. Statistical analysis of the nanoclusters’ diameter distribution based on the HR-TEM images (Figure s3) showed an average diameter of 1.68 nm, a value that agrees with the HAADF-STEM analysis. The most challenging aspect was to verify the crystallographic and chemical nature of the copper containing nanoparticles. The surface chemistry analysis was conducted by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For P25-CuOx, the peak centered at 458.7 eV (Fig. 4 ) observed at the high resolution spectra for Ti 2p3/2 is linked to the binding energy of Ti4+, in consistence with previous reports for TiO2 P25 [27,48–51]. The deconvolution of the high-resolution core energy level O 1 s spectrum of TiO2 P25 revealed three contributions, with maxima at 529.9, 531.2, and 532.1 eV [52]. The first one can be assigned to the surface oxide lattice O (Ti–O), the second to the acidic bridging or/and terminal hydroxyl groups (Ti–OH), and the third to the basic terminal hydroxyl groups linked to the adsorbed water moieties [53–56]. Considering also the high carbon content/impurities on the surface [27,52], the binding energies at 532.4 and 531.2 eV can also arise from the CO and CO bonds, respectively [56,57]. In the case of P25-CuOx, three predominant peaks were appeared at 530.2, 531.0, and 533.5 eV (Fig. 4). The surface deposition led to the shift of the binding energies of the hydroxyl surface moieties to a higher energy comparing to pristine P25, as well as in an increase of their content to 34.5% for P25-CuOx (from 15.9% for P25). The C 1 s core energy level deconvolution of P25-CuOx revealed three kind of carbon containing functionalities centered at 284.8 eV (for adventitious carbon), 286.1 eV (for CO bonds), and 288.6 eV (for CO bonds) [58,59]. The same functionalities were detected in the case of P25 [52], although the ratios of the CO and CO bonds were almost half comparing to P25-CuOx. The Cu 2p core-energy level spectra revealed a dominant broad contribution between 937.1–930.1 eV, with the maximum to be at 932.4 eV. This can be linked to the presence of either Cu+ as Cu2O or metallic Cu0. Since their binding energy values are similar, the distinction (even analyzing the Cu LMM Auger spectra) was not achievable, as reported previously for similar materials [39]. The presence of a satellite broad peak at 942.3 eV, in combination with the Cu 2p3/2 shake-up can be assigned to the presence of CuO, being however of relatively low contribution. Considering the above, it can be suggested that copper on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles exists with three different valences, 0, +1, and +2, with the latter two being the predominant ones. The Cu2O and CuO deposited phases is also possible to be formed by oxidation of Cu0 upon exposure to air [39]. The elemental analysis by XPS (Table s1) showed a 2.0% atomic content of Cu (6.5 wt%). The incorporation of the nanoclusters led to a slight increment of the surface pH, from 6.1 for P25 to 6.3 for P25-CuOx. In order to shed light on the nature of the deposited copper-based nanoparticles, powder XRD analysis was conducted. The pattern (Fig. 5 a) of P25 showed the presence of two crystalline phases, anatase (86%) and rutile (14%), and based on the Scherrer analysis, the average crystallite sizes were found 17.5 and 23.6 nm for anatase and rutile, respectively. Thermal treatment at 400 °C did not cause any alteration on the materials crystallinity. The patterns of the two allotropic structures of TiO2 in the case of copper modified sample were presented identical as the ones of the precursor P25; only a small increment of the average crystallite size of anatase by 0.3 nm was observed. With regard to the reflections assigned to possible crystalline phases of the deposited Cu-based nanoparticles, not overlapping with those of TiO2 (Fig. 5b), none of the metallic Cu0 predominant diffraction peaks of (111), (200) and (220) planes at 2θ 43.6°, 50.7° and 74.45° (JCPDS No. 85–1326), respectively, were detected [60,61]. On the contrary, a weak and broad reflection at 35.7° 2θ that is indexed to the (111) plane of standard cubic cuprite Cu2O structure (JCPDF No. 78–2076) [60,61] was clearly identified. Additionally, two reflections at 35.5 and 32.5° 2θ, of very low intensity, were also detected and indicated the presence of the (−111) and (110) planes of monoclinic structure of CuO (JCPDS No. 80-1917) [61–63]. The crystallite size of the Cu2O phase was estimated to around 4.5 nm, with a high level of uncertainty due to the very low intensity of these signals. The crystallite size of the CuO cannot be determined based on XRD due to the low signal intensity. The optical properties were explored by diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from UVB up to near infrared (Fig. 6 ). As it is well known, P25 absorb light in the ultraviolet region, from 400 nm and below. The incorporation of the surface deposited CuOx nanoclusters led to a coloring of the TiO2 powder because of light absorption at the entire visible light region in addition to the ultraviolet. The optical in-direct band gaps were approximately estimated based on the linear extrapolation of the Tauc plots (Fig. 6b) derived from the Kubelka-Munk method [64,65]. For P25, the band gap was around 3.4 eV, a value in a good correlation with those reported in the literature [66]. For P25-CuOx, the band gap was found lower by ~0.2 eV. It should be mentioned that P25-400 showed exactly the same light absorption behavior as P25."
9,Photocatalytic H2 generation,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 generation Within our goals was to explore the H2 formation capability of the new photocatalyst under low power ultraviolet (UV, 365 nm) irradiation generated from a LED source and by using the simple photoreactor setup (H2-rctr) as descripted in detail in the experimental part, with methanol serving as a sacrificial oxidant. The evolution of H2 production can be seen in Fig. 7 . Only P25-CuOx was capable for the photocatalytic H2 production, while P25 or P25-400 did not exhibit any H2 formation. It should be pointed out that H2 formation was also not observed during the photolysis tests. We tested also several other TiO2 based materials, such as the commercially available TiO2 P90, ultrasound hydroxylated TiO2 P25 [27], grafted core-shell titania [52], titania nanotubes pure or doped with Cu, Zn, Fe nanoparticles solely or in combination, as well as various composites of the above with reduced graphite oxide [27]. None of the above showed any H2 generation capability. For P25-CuOx, the photocatalytic H2 formation rate reached a maximum value initially (30 min) followed by a slight decrease towards a plateau after 120 min, a trend also observed in previous reports [37]. After the first 30 min of UV irradiation, the maximum recorded flow of produced H2 was 2.48 μmol h−1 g−1 after 30 min and stabilized at 1.85 μmol h−1 g−1 after 2 h. This value is significant high considering the low light intensity, a feature important towards real-life application to utilize the UV range of solar light even during a cloudy day. A marked change in color of the liquid phase was observed after some minutes of light exposure. The initial white in color colloidal suspension (Fig. 8 a) was turned to purplish (Fig. 8b), suggesting that redox reaction of the copper moieties took place. Analysis of the liquid phase after the experiments did not show any leaching of Ti or Cu, thus revealing the stability of the photocatalyst. The suspension was then left in open air and the color changed gradually back to a white shaded one. The presence of the copper on the surface in different valences give rise to the generation of charge carriers upon the absorption of light, a phenomenon known as Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), which can be the reason behind the color changes during the experiments [37]."
10,Photocatalytic selective biomass valorization,"3.3 Photocatalytic selective biomass valorization Titanium dioxide, and especially the commercially available P25, as well as functionalized materials based on TiO2 are known for possessing an elevated photocatalytic decomposition efficiency against a wide range of organics. However, most of these processes are linked to the unselective transformation/mineralization of the reactant, most of the times organic pollutant. Going a step further, recent research efforts aim to utilize TiO2 based materials for synthetic processes, such as the selective partial photo-oxidation of biomass derived compounds. In order to enhance the sustainability of the process, the addition of hazardous reagents/oxidants has been avoided in the present study. Furthermore, the two model compounds used for studying their selective partial photo-oxidative efficiency, are amongst the most valuable platform chemicals – intermediates derived from lignocellulosic biomass, i.e. 5-hydroxymethylfurfrual (HMF) produced by cellulose derived glucose and the lignin derived benzyl alcohol (BnOH). 3.3.1 Photocatalytic selective partial oxidation of HMF to DFF As it can be seen in Fig. 9 , P25 achieved 100% HMF conversion after 3 h of UV light exposure, exhibiting however low DFF selectivity and yield. The highest values of DFF selectivity (21%) and yield (13%) were observed after 1 h of irradiation. The reactivity of the calcined P25 in converting HMF was similar to that of the parent P25. However, P25–400 showed higher selectivity (and yield) to DFF by about 5–10% compared to P25. These results reveal that the selective partial oxidation of HMF to DFF is not affected by the presence of surface water moieties. On the contrary, the transformation of the formed DFF moieties is affected, since DFF decomposes unselectively, with the latter not to be a desired effect. It should be pointed out that DFF does not get further oxidized to for instance 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) or other detected non-cyclic organics. On the other hand, the copper modified photocatalyst showed a slightly lower HMF conversion at relatively longer reaction times (i.e. reaching 95% HMF conversion after 3 h), but the DFF selectivity was significantly higher in comparison to P25 and P25–400, i.e. 50 and 30% after 1 and 3 h of UV irradiation respectively. As a result, P25-CuOx presented the highest DFF yield of 30% after 3 h. It has to pointed out that no other oxidation products like FDCA was detected, suggesting that the DFF was unselectively decompose to low molecular weight organic compounds not detectable by LC-MS (like levulinic acid) or/and it was mineralized."
11,Photocatalytic selective partial oxidation of BnOH to PhCHO,"3.4 Photocatalytic selective partial oxidation of BnOH to PhCHO Regarding the lignin derived model compound benzyl alcohol (BnOH), P25 showed a high conversion efficiency under UV light irradiation, reaching 97% of BnOH conversion within 3 h and >99% after 6 h (Fig. 10 ). The PhCHO selectivity and yield were moderate, being about 65–70% for the first 2 h of reaction and decreasing to about 32% after 6 h. The maximum PhCHO yield of 60% was observed at 2 h of reaction. P25–400 exhibited 95, 56, and 53% BnOH conversion, PhCHO selectivity and yield, respectively after 6 h. These results reveal that the removal of the strongly adsorbed surface water moieties led to faster reactivity since more catalytic sites are available. Moreover, the smaller amount of water favors the selectivity by lessening the further decomposition of the formed aldehyde to undesirable compounds. It is worth to mention that no other aromatic compounds like for instance benzoic acid were detected. Although, the decoration of the P25 nanoparticles with the ultra-nano CuOx species had a negative impact on the BnOH conversion extend (81% after 6 h) and rate, the final PhCHO yield was 80%, a value more than two times higher than that of P25 and 51% higher comparing to P25–400. This high yield was attributed to the 100% PhCHO selectivity observed during the entire (6 h) photocatalytic experiment. This type of performance, i.e. stable 100% selectivity to the targeted product at conversion ≥ 80%, is capable to support upscaled production processes by utilizing alternative approaches like microflow photoreactors decorated with P25-CuOx which can further boost the BnOH conversion."
12,The role of the CuOx nanoclusters,"3.5 The role of the CuOx nanoclusters The surface incorporated CuOx nanoclusters have a bimodal role, since they can act either as active adsorption centers or/and as catalytic reduction sites. In general, it is well discussed that the photoexcited electron upon light irradiation are transferred from the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 phase to the Cu-clusters (delocalization) [18,36,67]. By this, the predominant drawback of fast charge recombination in the case of pure TiO2 diminishes, while the Cu-clusters can act more reactively as redox catalytic sites. In the case of H2 production, the holes are responsible for the formation of hydrogen ions (H +) from the oxidation of methanol [9,39,67]. The delocalized photoexcited e − on the CuOx phase are responsible for the reduction of H + to molecular hydrogen [9]. Considering that the incorporation of the CuOx cluster led to a significant lower BnOH conversion rate, while in the case of HMF on the contrary the effect on the conversion was almost negligible, it can be assumed that the adsorption/interaction of the formed benzaldehyde on the CuOx is not favorable. This can be a reason behind the fact that no further oxidation/decomposition of the formed benzaldehyde by the delocalized electrons on Cu clusters occurred, suggesting that the interaction of the aromatic benzyl alcohol is not thermodynamically favorable. In previously studies, it was presented that the organic moieties can either “strongly adsorbed” or “weakly adsorbed” on the surface and hence different mechanism of reaction occur [37]. We have presented similar mechanistic aspects in our previous studies [47,52,68], while we are investigating actively the involved oxidation pathways with the results to be presented in a forth coming study. Regeneration of the P25-CuOx nanocatalyst by washing the exhausted powder during filtration by water, methanol, and acetonitrile (100 mL of each sequentially) revealed that the photoreactivity was preserved, since the HMF and BnOH conversion after 3 h was less than 7% lower comparing to the initial experiments. Although, we would like to bring in attention that some defected sites of the materials surface is possible to be poisoned by the interactions of the organic compounds especially UV irradiation and we are actively researching towards this direction. Finally, a material that was synthesized following the same protocol but in silence conditions (no ultrasonication) showed lower HMF and BnOH conversion by ~10 and ~15%, respectively, and more importantly, the conversion deviation between different series of the same experiments ranged at around 15%, suggesting a lower extend of surface homogeneity/nanoclusters dispersion comparing to the ultrasound assisted synthesis."
13,Conclusions,"The deposition of copper (~2.0% atomic content) on TiO2 P25 by the use of an ultrasound-assisted ultra-wet (US-UWet) impregnation method resulted in the formation of homogeneously dispersed Cu nanoclusters of less than 4 nm, with the average diameter being 1.6 nm. These ultra-nanosized particles exhibit predominately as Cu2O crystalline nanostructures, with minor contribution of CuO. The nanoengineered composite photocatalyst was efficient in H2 production by water splitting using methanol as sacrificial agent under ultraviolet irradiation (365 nm) of a very low intensity, while the benchmark TiO2 P25 did not reveal any photoreactivity to produce H2. With regard to the application of the nanoclusters-decorated nanocatalyst in biomass valorization, the additives free partial photo-oxidation of two biomass derived model compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfrual (HMF) and benzyl alcohol (BnOH) to value-added compounds, showed to be more selective and of a higher yield towards 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and benzaldehyde (PhCHO), respectively, compared to P25 and its calcinated counterpart. The elevated photoreactivity can be linked to the synergistic effect originated from the composite formation, with the more crucial derived phenomenon to be the nanosized homogeneous decoration of the spherical nanoclusters. The herein US-UWet impregnation synthesis can be assumed as a prosperous approach for the nanoparticles’ decoration with nanoclusters of different chemical heterogeneities. Additionally, the exploration of the ultrasound effects by studying different frequencies and power can lead to novel multifunctional nano-photocatalysts for green oriented applications."
