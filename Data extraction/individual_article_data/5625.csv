0,Introduction,
1,Two-phase anaerobic digestion for co-production of H2 and CH4,"1.1 Two-phase anaerobic digestion for co-production of H2 and CH4 Dark fermentation (DF) is one of the biological H2 production processes. Acetate and butyrate are its mainly soluble byproducts. Due to the metabolic or microbial population shift, other byproducts such as ethanol [1], propionate [2,3], and valerate and caproate [4], may be formed in various amounts. Without recovering energy from these byproducts, based on the same amount of H2 produced, the energy efficiency (i.e., energy out/energy input) of DF alone is the lowest [5]. To improve the overall energy recovery efficiency, another process after DF is needed to produce more H2 by photo fermentation (PF), bio-catalyzed electrolysis [6], or additional CH4 by anaerobic digestion (AD) [7]. A two-phase process appears to be essential and AD is the current most promising choice as the second process [8]. Using sugarcane as carbohydrate source and the scenario of net energy analysis, Manish and Banerjee [5] predicted that when byproducts of DF were converted into CH4, the overall energy conversion efficiency (of DF+AD) would increase from 9.6% (of DF alone) to 89.1% as the highest among the available energy conversion choices. They also hinted that the DF+AD has the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gases and cost of external energy used. Benemann [8] pointed out that the AD configuration and hardware could be adopted directly by DF, and the DF effluent can be in situ treated by AD. Generally, four sequential steps are involved in AD: hydrolysis, acidogenesis (or fermentation), acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. H2-producing DF is regarded as a special case of acidogenesis as (1) substrate is carbohydrate-rich and (2) the DF inoculum contains enriched anaerobes with high H2-producing capacity, mainly from genus Clostridium, Enterobacteria, and Escherichia [9]. Phase separation of H2-producing acidogenesis from methanogenesis can avoid consumption of H2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. In fact, from the AD point of view, the potential benefits of phase separation are many and mainly include [10]: optimization of environmental conditions for each group of microorganisms to concomitantly increase the substrate turnover rate; improvement of the overall stability by regulating mutual adaption between acidogens and methanogens; direct disposal of relatively fast-growing acidogenic biomass residue without the loss of more valuable methanogenic biomass residue. Cohen et al. [11,12] showed that the additional H2-producing reactor increased the overall conversion efficiency and improved the maximum possible organic loading and stability of the CH4 reactor. Due to the intrinsic high-strength and high-flow nature of DF processes, as reported the maximum substrate concentration and lowest hydraulic retention time (HRT) were 40gL−1 sucrose [13] and 0.5h [14], respectively, the CH4 reactor selected must possess several key characteristics: high organic loading rate (OLR), high hydraulic loading rate (low HRT), ability of retaining high concentration of good settling biomass, ability of rapid acclimation to a change in substrate characteristics, minimum energy and chemical input, and proven record. The CH4 reactors studied in the most two-phase systems for co-production of H2 and CH4 were mostly CSTRs [11,12,15–17]. Klass [18] pointed out that rapid, continuous agitation of anaerobic digesters was not necessary, and in some cases was even harmful [19] to retard the substrate transfer between species. As a mature technology, the upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor has become the most popular high-rate anaerobic treatment system for industrial wastewaters, especially for food processing industries [20] and appears to be a good candidate to treat the DF effluents. It has a fine and proven tracking record to deliver good performances in a two-phase AD, such as the hybrid anaerobic solid–liquid (HASL) system [21–26] for food waste digestion."
2,Characteristics of DF effluents,"1.2 Characteristics of DF effluents Table 1 summarizes the DF effluent pHs, compositions and concentrations of soluble byproducts, and concentrations and properties of DF biomass residue from different operating systems, including CSTRs [10,27–31], fixed/packed beds [32–34], and CIGSB [35]. Generally, the DF effluents were acidic and, to some extent, pHs varied depending on process pH controls. The ethanol–acetate fermentation produced more acidic effluents [36] than the butyrate–acetate fermentation. The compositions of byproducts exhibited a wide variation. In the butyrate–acetate dominating productions, butyrate and acetate were the major acid products. High concentrations of other acids such as propionate [30,32,35] and lactate [27,30], and solvents such as ethanol [27,30,32] were also reported. Some studies [4,37], not presented in Table 1, indicated significant production of valerate and caproate. For AD, acetate, ethanol, and butyrate are considered easy substrates because the rates of acetogenesis of ethanol and butyrate are faster than that of propionate. Production of propionate should be avoided in both DF and AD since its presence in H2 reactor indicated the possible low H2 production [3] and its accumulation in the CH4 reactor may lead to low pH and instability of methanogenesis. The unutilized substrates such as glucose exist at certain concentrations depending on process efficiencies. COD values of the DF effluents normally ranged from 10 to 20gL−1 and were 60–80% of the influent COD. The reductions were mainly attributed to the production of H2 and formation of fast-growing acidogenic biomass. Cohen et al. [10] reported that the fermentation of 10gL−1 glucose resulted in the production of 4.1gL−1 VFAs and ethanol, 1.8LL−1 H2, and 1.1gL−1 biomass and the biomass yield (BY) was 0.11gg−1 glucose. In their two other studies [2,38], the BY was reported to be 0.17–0.18gg−1 glucose at 2.5–30gL−1 influent glucose and 0.12–0.14gg−1 glucose at pH range of 4–8. Fang and Liu [30] calculated that the carbon mass balance of total byproducts (VFAs and solvents) and biomass at different pHs were 42.4–48.6% and 17.6–27.6% of influent carbon, and mentioned BY increased from 0.15gg−1 glucose at pH 4 to 0.22gg−1 glucose at pH 7. Lin and Chang [29] found the COD recovery, in terms of H2, VFA, and biomass were 8.5–16.3%, 66.5–80.6%, and 6.6–11.6% of influent glucose COD, respectively and at pH 6.4, 12.5–28.5% more biomass was produced than at pH 5.7. Chen and Lin [28] found when HRT decreased from 13.3 to 2h, the VSS concentrations decreased from 2.5 to 1.01gL−1 with an influent COD of 20gL−1. The carbohydrate substrate provides relatively more energy than other substrates such as acetate, thus, there is a significantly higher biomass synthesis from carbohydrates [39]. On average, total anaerobic BY is 0.35g-VSSg−1 COD from carbohydrate compared to 0.032g-VSSg−1 COD from acetate [40]. The acidogens have a BY of 0.14–0.17g-VSSg−1 COD [40] as found in Table 2 (0.34–0.54g-VSSg−1 COD elsewhere reported [41]), which is equivalent to 40–50% of overall biomass produced from carbohydrate with the balance going to others such as acetogens and methanogens. In terms of the growth rate, such 40–50% of overall biomass is produced in a very short period of time (hours) because of the intrinsic fast-growth nature of acidogens. Ghosh and Pohland [42] and Massey and Pohland [43] reported higher maximum growths of acidogens by using glucose were 1.25h−1 and 2.70h−1, respectively, responding to the minimum doubling times were 0.56h and 0.26h, respectively. In general, significant amounts of H2 biomass residue were generated in a short period of the DF processes and would impose a heavy duty to the downstream AD processes."
3,Characteristics of H2 biomass residue,"1.3 Characteristics of H2 biomass residue The composition and characteristics of H2 biomass residue are interest of this study. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix allows cooperation and communication among cells in microbial aggregates. Jia et al. [44] showed that acidogens produced more EPS than acetogens and methanogens. Liu and Fang [45] demonstrated EPS of acidogens were mainly composed of carbohydrate, protein, and humic substance and carbohydrate EPS (EPSC) were predominant (62%). In their study, it was found that the EPS of acidogens were as high as 179mgg−1 VSS or around 18% of measured VSS. It was close to that of aerobes and 75% more than that of methanogens. Sheng and Yu [46] revealed the total content of acidogens' EPS could reach a level of 173mgCg−1 VSS. Ironically, the excessive EPS and the high ratio of EPSC/EPSP ratio (EPSP =protein EPS) may have negative effect on the surface charge and hydrophobicity of cells and consequently the properties of bioflocculation and settling. Sludge with increased amount of EPS did not settle well [47]. Sludge hydrophobicity increased with hydrophobic protein EPS [47]. High concentration of hydrophilic EPSC in sludge produced an effluent of high turbidity [48] and had a negative effect on sludge settling [49]. Higher ratios of EPSC/EPSP have been proven to cause sludge bulking and were not favorable for sludge settling [50]. As a result, the poorly settled DF effluents have high contents of H2 biomass residues. Besides, the EPS peeled off from cells and intracellular matters released from the cell lysis (decay rate of acidogens was reported as high as 6.1d−1 shown in Table 2) contributed to insoluble and dispersed colloidal organic matters. It may impose unusual technical challenges to the subsequent AD process. The main objective of this research was to examine the responses of a methanogenic reactor to different fractions of DF effluents by using a two-phase AD system consisting of an upflow fixed-bed H2-producing reactor (RH) and a CH4-producing modified UASB reactor (RM). The fixed-bed configuration for H2 production was proven to be stable at low HRTs and able to retain high concentrations of biomass [32]. The pollutants of RH effluent consisted essentially three components: soluble matters (i.e., VFAs, solvents, and residue substrates), colloidal solids (i.e., insoluble macro-polymers such as peeled-off cell EPS and released intracellular materials of dead biomass), and suspended solids (mainly unsettled H2 biomass residue). To our best knowledge, no study examined the effects of different fractions of fermentative H2 production effluents on RM's CH4-producing performance."
4,Material and methods,
5,Configuration of the two-phase anaerobic system,"2.1 Configuration of the two-phase anaerobic system The H2-producing reactor RH was a fixed-bed reactor (10cm in diameter and 25cm in height) with a working volume of 0.8L. Cylindrical activated carbon pellets (3mm in diameter and 7–10mm in height) were used as biofilm carriers. The void ratio was 60–70% of the total reactor volume. The CH4-producing reactor RM was a modified UASB reactor (10cm in diameter and 70cm in height) with a working volume of 4.5L. All reactors were made of cylindrical plexi-glass. Biogas production was monitored by a wet gas meter (Ritter, Germany). A detailed diagram of the whole set-up is shown in Fig. 1 . All the reactors were operated at 30±1°C."
6,Startup and seed sludge,"2.2 Startup and seed sludge The seed sludge (45gVSSL−1 and pH=7.8) was obtained from the methanogenic reactor of a pilot-scale two-phase AD system established on campus. The system was used to treat food waste collected from nearby restaurants. The seed sludge was first screened through a 4mm sieve to remove big particles. For RH, the sludge was first acidified with 1N HCl to pH 3–4, kept for 24h, and then adjusted to neutral pH by 1N NaOH before heat-shocked at 100°C for 2h. 500ml of the fresh RH substrate seeded with 200ml of the pretreated sludge was circulated through RH at an HRT of 0.5h for cell cultivation and immobilization. The cultivation cycles were repeated 2–4 times. The RM was filled with 2L of the screened seed sludge and topped up with water to the working level."
7,Substrate compositions,"2.3 Substrate compositions RH substrate was prepared daily according to Zhang et al. [14] and Chang et al. [32] with slight modifications. It consisted of organic substrates (gL−1: 20 glucose and 0.2 peptone), buffer (gL−1: 4 NaHCO3), macronutrients (gL−1: 1.5 NH4Cl and 1 NaH2PO4), and micronutrients (mgL−1: 22 FeCl2·4H2O, 20 MgCl2·6H2O, 10 MnCl2·4H2O, 5 CoCl2·4H2O, 6 CaCl2·2H2O, 3.5 CuCl2·H2O, 4.2 ZnCl2, and 4.5 NiCl2·6H2O). The RM substrate composition used during the startup was prepared daily according to our previous studies [21,23–25]. It consisted of organic substrates (gL−1: 1.7 glucose, 0.5 peptone, and 0.35 meat extract), buffer (gL−1: 1.5 NaHCO3), macronutrients (mgL−1: 40 NH4Cl, 100 KH2PO4, 24 CaCl2·2H2O, 27 MgSO4·7H2O, and 20 FeSO4·7H2O), and some micronutrients. The components in micronutrients were H3BO3, ZnCl2, CuCl2, MnSO4·H2O, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, AlCl3, CoCl2·6H2O, and NiCl2 and all were in 50μgL−1. During startup, glucose was the main substrate (65% of total 2.5g-CODL−1) with peptone (20%) and meat extract (15%) as supplementary substrates. In the later stages of RM operation, glucose was replaced by different types of RH effluent. All substrates were stored at 4°C and directly pumped to the reactors."
8,Operation of hydrogen reactor RH,"2.4 Operation of hydrogen reactor RH After successful cultivation of the biomass, RH was operated at an HRT of 4.5h for 21 days to obtain sufficient biomass. Then the HRT was stepwise decreased from 4.5h to 2.0h with a step size of 0.5h. After each HRT decrease, the reactor was left to stabilize for 3 days to achieve a steady performance (less than 5% variation in gas production rates of three consecutive days). Each HRT was maintained at least for 7 days. The collection of RH effluent for RM experiment started at an HRT of 3.5h."
9,Pretreatments on RH effluent for RM,"2.5 Pretreatments on RH effluent for RM The procedure in preparing the various RH effluent fractions is listed in Table 3 . The overnight (20–24h) settled effluent was used to represent the poorly settled effluent, namely EFF3. After it was centrifuged at 3000rpm for 20min, the supernatant contained soluble matters, colloidal matters, and a small amount of suspended solids (<50mgL−1) and was used to simulate an extremely well-settled effluent, namely EFF2, which can be only theoretically achieved after a long settling time (e.g., several days). EFF1, the effluent containing only soluble fraction, was the filtrate collected by filtering EFF2 through 0.45μm membrane filter papers to remove colloidal solids with size >0.45μm and some residual suspended solids. The pretreated effluents were stored at 4°C before use."
10,Operation of RM,"2.6 Operation of RM Throughout the whole experiment, the HRT of RM was maintained at 20h. The change of soluble COD is shown in Fig. 2a. In stage 1 (day 0 to day 28) or the startup stage, RM was fed with the synthetic wastewater of 2.5g-CODL−1 consisting of mainly glucose. In stage 2 (day 29 to day 38), glucose was replaced by diluted EFF1 with the same COD contribution, and the concentrations of peptone and meat extract were unchanged. As a result, the influent still had a COD of 2.5gL−1. In stage 3 (day 38 to day 52), the concentration of EFF1 started to increase on day 38 until the influent COD reached 5.0gL−1 on day 52. The concentrations of other substrates, buffer, and inorganic nutrients were also increased proportionally with EFF1. In stage 4 (day 53 to day 70), the centrifuged EFF2 was used. The substrate contained not only a soluble COD (SCOD) of 4.0gL−1 but also a colloidal COD (CCOD) of 0.2gL−1. In stage 5 (day 71 to day 82), the concentrates of all the components in the substrate started to proportionally increase on day 71 until the substrate contained an SCOD of 7.0gL−1 and CCOD of 0.2–0.3gL−1 on day 82. In stage 6, from day 82 onwards, with others unchanged, untreated EFF3 replaced EFF2. So the resulting RM substrate contained an SCOD of 7.0±1.0gL−1, a CCOD of 0.3±0.1gL−1, and additional suspended solid COD or VSS COD of 1.0±0.2gL−1. In stages 1–3, the total COD (TCOD)=SCOD=COD since all substrates were in soluble form: in stages 4–5, TCOD=SCOD+CCOD; in stage 6, TCOD=SCOD+CCOD+VSS COD. The CCOD value was calculated as the difference between the COD values of EFF1 and EFF2. The VSS COD value (mg-CODL−1) was obtained by multiplying the VSS concentration (mg-VSSL−1) by a COD/VSS factor of 1.5 (pre-determined in this study)."
11,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Compositions of H2, CH4, and CO2 (% v/v) in the gas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) (HP, 5890A). The GC was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a fused-silica capillary column (30m×0.53mm) (Supelco, Carboxen™ 1010 Plot). The operation temperatures were 150°C, 150°C, and 200°C for the injector, oven, and detector, respectively and argon was the carrier gas. COD and VSS were analyzed according to the standard method [51]. Carbohydrate was determined using the phenol–sulfuric acid assay [52]. VFAs and alcohols were determined by another GC (Agilent, 6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m×0.32mm×0.5μm fused-silica capillary column (Agilent, DB-FFAP). Samples were filtered through a 0.2μm membrane filter before GC analysis. The temperature of the column oven was started at 60°C, increased at 20°Cmin−1 to 120°C, and then 30°Cmin−1 to 240°C and maintained for 3min. The temperatures of injector and detector were both 250°C. Helium was the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 103kPa."
12,Results and discussions,
13,Performance of RH,"3.1 Performance of RH 3.1.1 Hydrogen production and biomass yield Table 4 lists the hydrogen yields (HY) and volumetric hydrogen production rates (VHPR). The composition of H2 gradually increased from 25% at an HRT of 4.5h to 44–46% at an HRT of 2.0h. The maximum HY were 1.4molmol−1 glucose consumed. At steady state, the average HY were 1.1molmol−1 glucose consumed. However, HY increased with the decrease of HRT. The shortest HRT used was 2.0h. The VHPR increased with the decrease of HRTs. The maximum VHPR found were 14.6L-H2 L−1-reactord− 1 at an HRT of 2.0h. At steady states of low HRTs, the glucose utilization efficiencies were 50–80%. It may be caused by insufficient biomass residing in the reactor and substrate and product inhibitions. The observed BY (calculated from the effluent VSS concentration) was about 0.1g-VSSg−1 glucose consumed and less than other studies of 0.15–0.18g-VSSg−1 sucrose [53], 0.15–0.4g-VSSg−1 glucose [33], and 0.15g-VSSg−1 sucrose [32]. The low temperature of 30°C used may be the reason behind the low BY and inefficient substrate utilization. 3.1.2 Fermentation pathways Table 4 also lists the molar percentages of the major byproducts. Ethanol was the major solvent product. n-butanol (not shown) was also observed but in small amount (<1mM). Acetate and butyrate were the major VFAs. Caproate appeared at lower HRTs and gradually became the third major VFA. Insignificant amount of propionate (1–3% of total metabolite products) was always detected. After startup, the solvent products were 50–66% of total byproducts at an HRT of 4.5h. As HRT gradually decreased to below 2.5h, the acid products overtook the solvent products and became the majority (>60%). The molar ratio of ethanol/acetate was much higher than that of butyrate/acetate when HRT>2.0h. It indicated that ethanol–acetate type fermentation (Eq. (1)) for H2 production was the dominant pathway over butyrate–acetate type fermentation (Eqs. (2) and (3)). When the HRT was 2.0h, butyrate–acetate (ratio=1.1–1.7) and ethanol–acetate (ratio=1.4–2.0) pathways were equally important pathways responsible for H2 production. The appearance of caproate in significant amount (11–23%) in the later stages indicated that caproate-type fermentation was also important [4]. (1) C6H12O6 +H2O→CH3COOH+CH3CH2OH+2CO2 +2H2 (2) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+4H2 +2CO2 (3) C6H12O6 →CH3(CH2)2COOH+2H2 +2CO2 3.1.3 Characteristics of RH effluent used as RM substrate The characteristics of pretreated RH effluent used as RM substrate of different stages are summarized in Table 5 . The major soluble organic compounds in terms of percentage of SCOD were glucose, ethanol, acetate, butyrate, and caproate. Propionate only contributed less than 1% of SCOD. Due to incomplete glucose utilization, the residue glucose contributed significant COD, which however decreased from 45–50% to 15–17%. In the early RM stages, SCOD contributions of ethanol, acetate, and butyrate were similar and were around 9% and 11% for stage 2 and stage 3, respectively, while caproate contribution was 1–5%. In the later stages, the contributions of butyrate and caproate increased significantly above 20%, while those of ethanol and acetate dropped to below 10%. When RH influent contained around 20gL−1 glucose, RH effluent had an SCOD of 17–19gL−1. The RH effluent CCOD was approximately 5% of the SCOD. The biomass in the slightly settled RH effluent contributed 1g-CODL−1."
14,Performance of RM,"3.2 Performance of RM 3.2.1 Stage 1 (startup) Stage 1 using glucose was successful to startup the RM. After 28 days, the COD removal reached above 80% (Fig. 2a). The effluent VSS increased to 350mgL−1 and then decreased to below 40mgL−1 (Fig. 2b). It meant, at the end of stage 1, the biomass left in the RM was dense and had good settleability, and a large amount of loose and light biomass has been washed out by the increasing upward biogas flow. At the end of the startup period, the biogas production rate reached 100mlh−1 (Fig. 2d) and 80% were CH4 (Fig. 2c). Less than 5% of H2 appeared at the start and completely disappeared after 3 days. On day 28, the total effluent VFA was less than 500mgL−1 (Fig. 2g) and propionate and acetate equally contributed to 50% of the effluent SCOD (Fig. 2h). The methane yield (MY) reached 0.5g CH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e) and implied that around another 50% of COD converted became the new biomass, which was either retained in the reactor or washed out. Due to the nature of substrate – rich in glucose, most of the new biomass was fast-growing acidogens due to higher biomass yields (0.14–0.17g-VSSg−1 COD) and maximum growth rates (7.2–30d−1) (Table 2). By the end of day 28, the reactor was considered at steady state under the OLR of 3.0g-CODL−1 d−1 (Fig. 2f). 3.2.2 Treating membrane-filtered RH effluent – EFF1 in stages 2 and 3 After 28 days, the diluted EFF1 replaced glucose as the main COD substrate without any change of other substrates and inorganic nutrients. Thus the COD and OLR remained unchanged (Fig. 2a). The COD removal efficiency continued to increase to 95% in the next 10 days (Fig. 2a). The biogas production increased to 200mlh−1 (Fig. 2d), and its increase caused more biomass washout, around 300mg VSSL−1 in the effluent (Fig. 2b). MY increased to and was stabilized at 0.75g CH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e). The new biomass produced from 25% of CODremoved still mainly consisted of acidogens because the RM influent of stage 2 contained 50% of glucose on COD basis (Table 4). In addition to that, the influent also contained 8–11% of ethanol, 9–11% of acetate, and 7–9% of butyrate. The total effluent VFAs dropped to below 100mgL−1 at the end of stage 2 (Fig. 2g). The residue VFAs were mainly propionate (45–68%) and acetate (20–45%), with a small amount of butyrate (<8%) (Fig. 2h). It suggested that the acetogenesis of ethanol and butyrate were easier than that of propionate. However, propionate was less than 20mgL−1 (Fig. 2g). From the overall observations in the 10 days of stage 2, the RM fed with EFF1 reached the steady state under an OLR of 3.0g-CODL−1 d−1 in 10 days. In stage 3, the influent COD was stepwise increased by 0.5g-CODL−1 every 3 days from 2.5g-CODL−1 on day 38 and reached 5.0g-CODL−1 on day 52 in 15 days (Fig. 2a). The COD removal efficiency remained above 90%. The biogas production increased linearly to 400mlh−1 with the COD increase (Fig. 2a and d). The effluent VSS concentration continued to increase with the increase of gas flow (Fig. 2b and d). Since the COD contribution of glucose in the influent dropped to 24–30% (Table 5), less COD removed was used to build-up the acidogens. Thus, the MY increased correspondingly to around 0.9gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved at the end of stage 3 (Fig. 2e). The total residual VFA concentration was well below 200mgL−1 during this stage (Fig. 2g). Among the VFAs, the COD contribution of residual acetate decreased from 32% to 5% while that of residual butyrate increased from 3% to 28% (Fig. 2h). Propionate was still the main VFA with a concentration ranging from 12% to 44%. Overall speaking, the RM functioned well and maintained its steady state in stage 3 when the OLR continuously increased from 3g-CODL−1 d−1 to 6g-CODL−1 d−1. From the observations of stages 2 and 3, the RM was capable of converting the residue glucose, ethanol, acetate, and butyrate into CH4 from H2 production process. The acetogenesis of propionate was slow, albeit with very low concentration in the influent (<1% in Table 5 or 70–80mg-CODL−1). 3.2.3 Treating centrifuged RH effluent EFF2 in stages 4 and 5 In stage 4, the centrifuged RH effluent EFF2 was used as RM's main substrate. In addition to soluble matters (expressed as SCOD), the EFF2 contained a small portion of insoluble colloidal matters (expressed as CCOD) with a COD equal to around 5% of SCOD. The SCOD OLR was decreased to 4g-CODL−1 d−1 (Fig. 2f) by lowering the influent SCOD concentration to 4g-CODL−1 (Fig. 2a). The purpose of lowering SCOD OLR was to minimize the potential adverse effect of higher SCOD OLRs (>6g-CODL−1 d−1) and examines the true effect of colloidal matters on the RM performance under low SCOD OLRs (3–4g-CODL−1 d−1). The CCOD OLR was 0.15–0.2g-CODL−1 d−1. The SCOD removal efficiency maintained above 90% during 18 days of stage 4 (Fig. 2a). Due to the performance fluctuation of substrate delivering pump from day 62 to day 67, the slightly decreased HRT caused the SCOD OLR drop to 3g-CODL−1 d−1 (Fig. 2f) before it retained the designed value again on day 68. However this did not deteriorate the RM performance. The biogas production rate was maintained above 430mlh−1 (Fig. 2d) under an SCOD OLR of 4g-CODL−1 d−1, linearly decreased to 300mlh−1 under SCOD OLR of 3g-CODL−1 d−1 and moved back to 400mlh−1 at restored SCOD OLR of 4g-CODL−1 d−1. The washout of biomass followed such trend that decreased to 165mg-VSSL−1 (Fig. 2a) and then increased to the previous level of 350mg-VSSL−1. The SCOD contribution of glucose in the influent decreased slightly to 20–23% in stage 4 (Table 5). Other than ethanol (16–21%), acetate (5–9%), and butyrate (11–16%), caproate started to make more significant influent SCOD contribution of 10–18% compared to 3–5% in stage 3. The total residue VFA concentration was still below 100mgL−1 over the 18-d operation (Fig. 2g) and among them, persistent propionate was the major residue acid followed by acetate and butyrate in decreasing order (Fig. 2h). The degradation of caproate was satisfactory, and there was no trace caproate found in the effluent. It indicated that even-numbered VFAs such as butyrate (C2) and caproate (C4) was degraded more easily than odd-numbered ones such as propionate (C3), and their conversion to acetate (acetogenesis) was not a rate-limiting step. MY maintained at 1.3gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e). It should be pointed out that theoretical MY was less than 1.0gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved because a portion of removed COD would contribute to biomass build-up. The reasons behind the over-estimated MY were probably because: (1) part of the CCOD (around 5% of SCOD) also contributed to CH4 production (MY was calculated by dividing the methane COD by the difference of the SCOD values of influent and effluent) and (2) the decay of inactive biomass, especially large amount of acidogen biomass, provided additional substrate for CH4 production. The effluent CCOD was found very little in stage 4 and hence it was reasonably assumed that a 100% removal efficiency of CCOD. The MY calculated based on the assumption of complete degradation of SCOD and CCOD was only still around 1.05gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved. Therefore, the additional 0.25 (=1.3–1.05)gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved was definitely from other sources such as the dead bodies of acidogens which has the highest decay rate of 6.1d−1 (Table 2) among the anaerobes. Nevertheless, the performance of RM fed with the centrifuged RH effluent EFF2 was found successful in stage 4. It seemed that the colloidal matters were easily converted under the combined OLR of an SCOD OLR of 3–4g-CODL−1 d−1 and a CCOD OLR of 0.15–0.2g-CODL−1 d−1. In stage 5, the influent SCOD was stepwise increased by 0.75g-CODL−1 every 3 days again from 4g-CODL−1 on day 71 and reached 7.0g-CODL−1 on day 82 in 12 days (Fig. 2a). The SCOD OLR correspondingly increased from 4g-CODL−1 d−1 to 8g-CODL−1 d−1 in 12 days (Fig. 2f). Meanwhile, the CCOD increased from 0.2g-CODL−1 d−1 to 0.4g-CODL−1 d−1. The SCOD removal efficiency was maintained at 90–95% (Fig. 2a). The total residue VFA concentration was below 100mgL−1 (Fig. 2g). Propionate remained as the major residual VFA followed by acetate, but the residual concentrations of butyrate and caproate significantly increased in the last 4 days (Fig. 2h). The biogas production rate increased linearly from 400mlh−1 to 750mlh−1 albeit experiencing some fluctuation during the increase (Fig. 2d). On contrast, the biomass in the effluent decreased (Fig. 2b) in spite of the rising upward gas flow rate, indicating that the granulation of biomass has taken place successfully in this stage. Table 5 indicates that the influent composition had a significant change. The influent SCOD contribution of glucose was 17–23% which was similar to that in stage 4. However, the contribution of butyrate and caproate increased to 13–20% and 18–21%, respectively, while that of ethanol has decreased considerably from 16–21% to 9–14% and that of acetate remained the same (6–7%). In spite of such significant change in the influent composition, the total residual VFAs remained below 150mgL−1 (Fig. 2g). Propionate was still the main residual VFA followed by acetate and butyrate, and the degradation of caproate was found satisfactory (Fig. 2h). The MY started to decline from 1.2gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved on day 72 to 1.0gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e). The examination on the effluent CCOD revealed that the CCOD gradually increased to the level of 0.3g-CODL−1 at the last 5 days of stage 5. With the increase of CCOD OLR, the degradation of the influent organic matters was deteriorated. The colloidal matters were either accumulatively retained in the reactor or washed out. The accumulation of organic colloidal matters in a methanogenic reactor was reported [54] prevailingly by adsorption mechanism. The surface of the adsorbent, the sludge in this case, especially the granular sludge, has accessible sites available to the adsorbate (the colloidal matters). The adsorption of colloidal matters by the sludge was proven very rapid. It was reported [55] at a sludge loading rate of 0.17g-CODg−1 VSS with equal COD contributions made by soluble and colloidal matters, 10% of soluble matters and 90% of colloidal matters were absorbed by the sludge in 10min, and the adsorption capacity of the sludge reached a saturation level of 0.08g-CCODg−1 VSS. On the contrary, the anaerobic degradation of insoluble colloidal matters is relatively slow. So the adsorption of colloidal matters (and possibly also some of soluble matters) which resulted in a thickness-increasing film surrounding the sludge, progressively hampered the supply of substrate to the inner microorganisms [55]. This may finally lead to a complete deterioration of methanogenesis as previously reported [56]. In stage 5, the CCOD OLR increased from 0.2g-CODL−1 d−1 to 0.4g-CODL−1 d−1 in 12 days and the accumulation of colloidal matters on the sludge surface inevitably retarded methanogenesis and resulted in the decrease of MY. 3.2.4 Treating slightly settled raw RH effluent – EFF3 in stage 6 To obtain a low VSS content in the RM influent, the glucose concentration of RH influent was reduced to 10gL−1 from 20gL−1, and the resulted RH effluent EFF3 had an SCOD of 6.7–8.3gL−1 and a TCOD of 8.0–10.0gL−1 with a VSS COD contribution of 1.0gL−1 (Table 5). In the first 10 days of stage 6 (day 82 to day 92), the RM influent was a mix of EFF2 and EFF3 and the resulted influent SCOD was still 7gL−1. However, the biogas production rate gradually decreased to 650mlh−1 (Fig. 2d) on day 88 in spite the SCOD removal efficiency remained above 90% in the first 6 days of stage 6 (day 82 to day 87). MY decreased from 0.9 to 0.8gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e) during that period. Although the total residual VFA concentration was quite low (<100mgL−1 in Fig. 2g), the main effluent VFAs were butyrate and caproate (around 30% for each) instead of propionate and acetate (both<10%) in stages 4 and 5 on the SCOD basis (Fig. 2h). Since butyrate and caproate in EFF2 of stage 5 and EFF3 of stage 6 were the major soluble organic components (15–24% and 18–21%, respectively) in the feed to RM (Table 5), their appearance as major residual VFAs indicated that their acetogenesis started to decline. Such decline may be still due to the accumulation of colloidal matters on the sludge surface which limited the supply of soluble substrate to the inner microorganisms. From day 88 to day 91, the performance of RM started to show a sign of failure. A significant H2 portion appeared in the biogas (around 2% on day 91) in Fig. 2c, and the corresponding CH4 composition decreased from 80% to 52%. The biogas production rate dramatically dropped to zero on day 91 (Fig. 2d); so did MY and VMPR (Fig. 2e and f). There was no SCOD degradation (Fig. 2a). The total VFA concentration in the effluent remarkably increased to 2000mgL−1 (Fig. 2g) on day 91. However, from day 92 onward, the RM started to show a sign of recovery. From day 4 of stage 6, EFF3 was directly used as the substrate. The SCOD and CCOD concentrations in the influent remained unchanged, while the VSS COD contribution was increased to 1.0gL−1. It did not affect the recovery of RM performance after day 92. The SCOD removal efficiency slowly increased to 86% on day 120 (Fig. 2a). H2 disappeared and the composition of CH4 rose to the previous level of 80% (Fig. 2c). The biogas production rate increased to 480mlh−1 on day 120 (Fig. 2d) and MY on that day was 0.8gCH4-CODg−1 CODremoved (Fig. 2e). The total effluent VFA concentration decreased but was still as high as 750mgL−1 from day 100 to day 120 (Fig. 2g). In terms of the SCOD contributions of residual VFAs, caproate decreased to 4–5%, butyrate remained at 14%, propionate increased to 10%, and the main VFA, acetate, increased to 20% (Fig. 2h). It showed that the degradation of some VFAs was still limited. The biomass washout became significant, and the effluent VSS concentration reached 500mgL−1 (Fig. 2b) mainly due to the incomplete degradation of the influent suspended solids which was either trapped in the reactor or floated on the top of reactor and was later washed out along with the RM effluent. The entrapment of the influent VSS in RM caused an unusual expansion (>10%) of the sludge bed in the following 2 months after day 120. Cohen et al. [10] used slightly settled effluent from H2 production to directly feed an upflow methanogenic reactor and did not observe the build-up of white sludge (acidogens) in the methanogenic reactor. However, in this study, such build-up of acidogenesis sludge was observed after directly feeding the effluent for more than 1 month. The reasons that Cohen et al. [10] did not observe such build-up were probably due to several factors such as sufficiently long HRT of their methanogenic reactor (100h) which could lead to complete lysis of the white sludge and very short duration of experimentation on CH4 reactor. The RM performed towards steady state at the end of stage 6 and afterwards it remained at a “pseudo” steady state. Some key RM parameters such as COD removal and gas production were maintained at certain high levels instead of the maximum levels for a period of time at the “pseudo” steady state, and suddenly decreased to very low levels at any time. In the following 2 months (results were not shown in this paper), the periodical fluctuation in RM performance was observed the same as stage 6: from failure to pseudo steady state and then to failure. A real steady state could not be reached under the dynamic change: the sludge bed kept fast expanding mainly due to the accumulation of “white sludge” or acidogen biomass from the high-VSS RM influent. Lettinga [41] pointed out, when treating acidified wastewater, significant differences in growth and death/decay rates between acidogenic and acetogenic/methanogenic organisms had been completely ignored in many phase-separation studies. Non-decayed and dispersed acidogenic sludge in the influent not only occupy space set for acetogens and methanogens in methanogenic reactors but also stimulate sludge flotation and therefore negatively affect the granular sludge growth and sludge retention, since finely dispersed particles acting as carrier material for in-growing methanogenic organisms are hardly retained in the reactor. Therefore, Lettinga suggested that the acidogenic sludge not be presented, or at least kept in low concentrations below 300–400mgL−1. In this study, the slightly settled RH effluent EFF3 had a VSS content of 700–800mg-VSSL−1 and caused the CH4-producing performance of RM to deteriorate. The significant amount of H2 biomass residue should be removed or recycled to reduce such risk. 3.2.5 Comparison of CH4 production of different fractions of RH effluent Fig. 3 demonstrates the CH4 production performance of RM fed with different types of RH effluent under different OLRs. The membrane-filtered RH effluent (EFF1) and centrifuged RH effluent (EFF2) were used as major COD substrates in stages 2–3 and stages 4–5, respectively. The OLRs for all stages were calculated based on the SCOD for easy comparison. The corresponding VMPRs were linearly and positively correlated with SCOD OLRs (both R 2 >0.95 and p <0.001) when RM treated EFF1 and EFF2. The VMPR of RM treating EFF2 of SCOD OLRs of 2–6g-CODL−1 d−1 with additional CCOD OLR of 0.1–0.3g-CODL−1 d−1 was much higher than that treating EFF1. However, with the increase of SCOD OLR to 6–10g-CODL−1 d−1, where corresponded to additional CCOD OLR of 0.3–0.5g-CODL−1 d−1, there was insignificant difference between the amount of CH4 produced from EFF2 and EFF1. In other words, colloidal matters started to exhibit inhibition on the RM CH4 production performance. The performance of RM treating raw effluent of RH (EFF3) was much worse."
15,Conclusions,"Due to the intrinsic fast-growth and high-biomass-yield nature of H2-producing acidogens, the effluents from fermentative H2 production, not only contained different types of soluble byproducts such as acids and solvents, but also comprised significant amount of colloidal matters and suspended biomass. The biomass carried a big portion of the influent carbohydrate/COD, for instance, 0.17–0.19gVSSg−1 glucose in Cohen's studies [2,38]. Furthermore, the H2 biomass residues in many studies possessed high contents of EPS and may cause sludge bulking and poor settling later on in the subsequent waste treatment processes. The colloidal matters were considered to be originated from the EPS peeled off from active cells and intracellular matters released from the lysis of dead cells. A two-phase anaerobic digestion system for co-production of H2 and CH4 was set-up to investigate the corresponding RM performance by treating different fractions of H2 production effluent. The results showed that the RM easily converted soluble byproducts under various OLRs, but it had difficulties when treating colloidal organic matters under high loadings. The colloidal matters were thought to have been adsorbed onto the surface of granular sludge and formed a film of increasing thickness which retarded substrate supply into the inner acetogens and methanogens. This study found RM performance treating centrifuged RH effluent was satisfactory under a combined OLR of an SCOD OLR of 2–6g-CODL−1 d−1 with a CCOD OLR of 0.1–0.3g-CODL−1 d−1 but deteriorated under a combined OLR of an SCOD OLR of 6–10g-CODL−1 d−1 with a CCOD OLR of 0.3–0.5g-CODL−1 d−1. The degradation of the suspended solid was slow under the tested RM HRT of 20h. The suspended solids in RH effluent fed to RM reactor were either trapped in the RM causing the expansion of sludge bed or washed out with the RM effluent. The washed out VSS may become carrier for in-growing methanogenic organisms and negatively affect the growth of granular sludge. This study recommended the suspended solid in the RH effluent be removed before RM; be treated elsewhere or recycled such as inoculum for H2-producing solid-fermentation from organic waste. Additional care should be taken to fine tune the RM to facilitate the degradation of colloidal matters by increasing HRT and dilution of influent by internal recirculation."
