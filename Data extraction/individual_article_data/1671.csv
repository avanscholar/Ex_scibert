0,Introduction,"Microplastic pollution has been regarded as a major environmental challenge more than a decade [1]. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its associating restrictions have accelerated the consumption of plastics, especially in the packaging, food, and medical industries [1,2], and some studies have demonstrated that the additives, which are leached from plastics, could aggravate environmental pollution [3]. Therefore, biodegradable polymers, such as poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), have attracted public attention as an alternative to synthetic plastics, which are obtained from fossil fuel (nonrenewable) resources [1]. PVA is a water-soluble, biodegradable polymer that exhibits advanced characteristics, such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and odorless [4,5]. Further, it exhibits good packaging properties, including good film-forming, excellent chemical resistance, and optical properties [6]. PVA also exhibits several disadvantages, such as limited water vapor barrier properties and low water resistance [4,5]. However, the utilization of crosslinking agents (boric acid, glutaraldehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, etc. [7–9]) or fillers (montmorillonite (MMT), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), lignin, etc. [10–12]) are common strategies for improving the properties of PVA. In this study, the properties of a PVA film were improved with PAA and layered double hydroxide (LDH) while still maintaining its biodegradability and nontoxicity. PAA is a biodegradable polymer that contains a carboxyl group (–COOH) on the repeating units; thus, it can crosslink by forming an ester bond with the alcohol group (–OH) of PVA via esterification reactions [5,13]. The intramolecular ester bonds between PVA and PAA can be degraded via natural microbiological reactions [13]. Moreover, PVA/PAA blend films are biocompatible and noncytotoxic because they do not exhibit the leaching of toxic compounds [14]. It is known that PVA/PAA blend films exert enhanced water resistance, thermal properties, and barrier properties compared with neat PVA films [5]. The general formula of LDH is M 1 − x 2 + M x 3 + OH 2 A m − x m ∙ n H 2 O ] , where M2+ (e.g. Mg2+, Ni2+, …) and M3+ (e.g. Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+, …) are the divalent and trivalent cations, whose cationic radii do not differ much from that of Mg2+; they are also known as hydrotalcites, and due to its extraordinary physicochemical properties based on its unique anisotropic structural characteristics, LDH is a promising two-dimensional inorganic nanomaterial with potential applications in a wide variety of fields [15–17]. Additionally, LDH is considered nontoxic enough to be used in drug delivery system studies [16,18,19]. Moreover, MgAl LDH is not only approved as a food contact substance (FCN, NO.633) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) but also as an authorized food contact material (FCM) additive by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [20]. The effective gas barrier filler is oriented parallel to the film's surface and interacts strongly with the polymer matrix to prevent gas permeation [21]. MgAl LDH can be arranged in parallel while it forms hydrogen bonds with the PVA matrix [22]; it can also interact with PAA [23–25]. Thus, LDH is potentilally effective filler to enhance the gas barrier properties of PVA/PAA blend film. Furthermore, several studies have reported that LDH can be applied to remove contaminants, especially from water systems [16]. However, LDH has not been studied as much as other nanoclays in the field of packaging. Moreover, only a few studies have evaluated the properties of LDH by adding it to a PVA blending film. These features of PVA, PAA, and LDH can provide a positive point for reducing environmental pollution that is caused by the leaching of additives and microplastics. This study is aimed at developing an exactly ecofriendly PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite film with improved properties for packaging food in a relatively facile approach. To evaluate the effects of LDH, the structural, barrier, mechanical, thermal, and optical properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were investigated."
1,Methods & materials,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (Mw = 89,000–98,000, 99 + % hydrolyzed) and hydrotalcite (MgAl LDH; Mw = 603.98, carbonate-ion intercalated form) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PAA (average Mw = 5000) was purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation (Osaka, Japan). All the reagents, which were employed for the experiments, were utilized without further purification."
3,Preparation of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films,"2.2 Preparation of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films The PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were prepared via the solution-casting method. Firstly, a mixture of PVA (8.5 g) and PAA (1.5 g) was dissolved in distilled water (DW, 125 g) with continuous stirring for 2 h at 80 °C. Next, different contents of the MgAl LDH (0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt% of the total polymer weight) were added into the solution and stirred for 24 h at 80 °C. The PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite mixture were cooled down for 30 min at 20 °C. Afterward, the nanocomposite solutions were ultrasonicated by an ultrasonic homogenizer (VCX-750, Sonics & Materials Inc., New Town, CT, USA) for 10 min. Thereafter, as-prepared solutions were poured into a petri dish and dried in a thermo-hygrostat chamber (Model TR-001-1, Jeio Tech, Daejeon, Republic of Korea) for 24 h at 25 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 50%. The resulting samples are referred to as LDH0, LDH1, LDH2, LDH 3 and LDH5 with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt% LDH (based on of total polymer weight), respectively, and the average film thickness was 70.42 ± 6.78 μm."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary 630 FTIR spectrometer (Agilent, California, USA) in the attenuated reflectance (ATR) mode to characterize the chemical structure of the nanocomposite films. The FTIR spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm−1 employing an average of 32 scans and a resolution of 2 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, which was performed on an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAZX 2500 V/PC model, Rigaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), was employed to determine the structural changes in the film and dispersion of LDH. The radiation source was operated at 40 kV/200 mA, and the scanning range (2θ) was from 10° to 80° at an interval of 0.02° at a scanning speed of 1.0°/min. The surface morphologies of the nanocomposite films were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL-JSM-7600F, Tokyo, Japan)."
5,Barrier properties,"2.4 Barrier properties 2.4.1 Water vapor permeability (WVP) To evaluate the water vapor barrier properties, the WVP was measured via the cup method, following the modified ASTM E96 method. The internal diameter and depth of the test cup were 46 and 21 mm, respectively (the size of the exposed area was 16.61 cm2). First, 10 g of DW was added to the test cup with an O-ring to prevent leakage. Next, the films were placed on the test cups and fixed to completely cover the O-ring and prevent the leakage of the water vapor. The test cups were stored in the thermo-hygrostat chamber at 25 °C and an RH of 50%, after which the water vapor transmission (WVTR) was measured within 24 h. WVP was calculated via the following equation: (1) WVP g / m ∙ s ∙ Pa = WVTR × d Δ p where d (m) is the average thickness of the five points of the film and Δp (Pa) is the difference between the partial water vapor pressures of both sides of the film. The average value of WVP was calculated by repeating the measurement five times. All the samples were conditioned for 48 h at 25 °C and 50% before the tests. 2.4.2 Oxygen permeability (OP) The oxygen permeability (OP) was measured to evaluate the oxygen barrier properties at 23.0 ± 1 °C. To calculate OP, the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) was measured by MOCON OX-TRAN® 702 (MOCON Inc. MN, USA), following ASTM E3985 at 23.0 ± 1 °C and RH 0%. OP was calculated by the following equation: (2) OP cc / m ∙ day ∙ atm = OTR × d Δ p where d (m) is the average thickness of the five points on the film and Δp (atm) is the permeant pressure. The average value of OP was calculated by repeating the measurements five times. All the samples were conditioned for 48 h at 25 °C and 50% before the tests."
6,Mechanical properties,"2.5 Mechanical properties The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (E) of the films were investigated according to the ASTM D882 method to measure the mechanical properties. TS and E were measured by INSTRON 3366 (INSTRON, Norwood, MA, USA). To calculate the cross-sectional area, the average thickness of the five points of the film was measured. The width of 15 mm, a grip distance of 20 mm, and a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. All the samples were conditioned for 48 h at 25 °C and 50% before the tests."
7,Thermal properties,"2.6 Thermal properties The thermal properties of the film were measured via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA was conducted on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, N-1000, SCINCO, Seoul, Korea) from 25 to 800 °C. DSC was conducted on a DSC Q20 calorimeter (TA Instruments, USA) in a nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate = 50 mL/min, heating rate = 10.00 °C/min, and heat range = 25–250 °C) to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of the nanocomposite films."
8,Optical properties,"2.7 Optical properties In this study, the optical properties were measured, following the modification of previous studies [26,27]. Briefly, all the film samples were cut into pieces (to fit into the cuvette), and the samples were measured at 600 and 230 nm, respectively. The transmittance was measured three times by a UV–visible (Vis) spectrophotometer (OPTIZEN POP, Mecasys, Republic of Korea)."
9,Statical analysis,"2.8 Statical analysis Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA using SPSS software (SPSS 25, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Duncan's multiple range tests were used to indicate the statical differences among mean values. The results were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation for each experiment."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterizations,"3.1 Characterizations 3.1.1 FTIR The FTIR spectra of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposites and raw materials are shown in Fig. 1 . According to previous reports, the characteristic IR peaks of pure PVA were detected at 3600–3000 cm−1 (the –OH stretching vibration) [5–7], 2950–2850 cm−1 (the –CH stretching vibration) [10,12–14], 1269 cm−1 (the CO stretching vibration) [14], and 1089 cm−1 (the C–OH stretching vibration) [12]. Additionally, Xiao et al. reported that the peaks at 1426 and 1324 cm−1 were attributable to the coupling of the secondary OH in-plane bending and CH wagging vibrations of PVA, respectively [28]. Several studies have reported some peak changes that indicated the interaction between PVA and PAA in the PVA/PAA blend film were observed by increasing the PAA content. These changes were thus: at around 1700 (the CO stretching of COOH in PAA) and 1094 cm−1 (the dissymmetry stretching vibration of the CO of PVA), the peaks moved toward higher wavenumbers, and the peak at 3700–3000 cm−1 (the –OH stretching vibration from PVA) was weakened [5,14]. In the IR spectra of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films (Fig. 1(a)), the peak intensity at 3700–3000 cm−1 (the –OH stretching vibration) increased gradually, and the peak at approximately1700 cm−1 decreased gradually, while that at 1089 cm−1 (the dissymmetric stretching vibration of CO) was observed. These changes showed increasing the LDH content affected the interaction between PVA and PAA polymer chains, and hydrogen bonds are potentially increased. Furthermore, the 1563 and 1452 cm−1 (RCO2 −, evidence of the PAA-Mg-Al LDH interaction [24,25]) peaks increased, and the 1360, 765, and 625 cm−1 peaks, which corresponded to the interlayer carbonate groups in MgAl LDH [29], were not detected, indicating that the formed LDH–CO3 2− was not detected in the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films, and these results potentially showed the PAA intercalated into the LDH gallery instead of CO3 2−. Therefore, MgAl LDH was suggested well-dispersed in the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite film. 3.1.2 XRD XRD analysis is a valuable tool for verifying the exfoliation or intercalation of layered structure fillers, as well as determine the changes in the crystal structures. Lim et al. reported two characteristic peaks ((110) and (220) at 19.7° and 40.7°, respectively) in the XRD patterns of PVA/PAA blend films [5,7]. These peaks were attributed to the semicrystalline peaks of pure PVA since their –OH groups could form hydrogen bonds [5–7]. Further, several studies have reported the (003) and (006) diffraction peaks of MgAl LDH at around 2θ = 10° and 20°, respectively [29–35]. Additionally, another study reported that if non-exfoliated LDH (the CO3 2−-intercalated form) existed in the PVA/LDH nanocomposite polymer matrix, the (003) diffraction peak would be detected around 2θ = 11° in the XRD pattern [31,33]. The absence of LDH peaks in nanocomposites could be owing to low LDH content and dispersion in the film production. [36] Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of pristine LDH and the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposites. The XRD patterns of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films (Fig. 2(b)–(e)) revealed that the (003) and (006) diffraction peaks of LDH disappeared around 10° and 20°, indicating that the MgAl LDH was well-dispersed in the PVA/PAA/LDH polymer matrix. Moreover, in Fig. S1 the (110) and (220) peaks at 2θ = 19.5° and 40.7° increased in the PVA/PAA/LDH containing 3% and 5% LDH, respectively. These findings demonstrated that the (110) and (220) crystal structures of the nanocomposite films increased at LDH loadings of ≥3%. 3.1.3 SEM The surface morphologies of the films are shown in Fig. 3 . The LDH 0 and LDH 1 nanocomposite films exhibited smooth surfaces (Fig. 3(a) and (b)), and the LDH 2 film was slightly rough (Fig. 3(c)). However, an uneven surface and slight aggregation were observed when the LDH content was 3% (Fig. 3(d)). Furthermore, PVA/PAA/LDH-5% exhibited the worst uneven surface and aggregation probably owing to the changes in the interaction between PVA and PAA by loading LDH, as supported by the FTIR results (Fig. 1(e)). Agglomeration in the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite film may be a result of the LDH being poorly dispersed in the film matrix during film preparation. Typically, in LDHs/polymer systems, the LDHs are treated with organic anions to improve their interaction with the polymer matrix. [37]"
12,Barrier properties,"3.2 Barrier properties The gas barrier properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH films were evaluated from the WVP and OP measurement results. WVP was measured to investigate the effect of LDH on the water vapor barrier properties of the PVA/PAA films (Fig. 4(a)). The effect of LDH on the water vapor barrier properties has not been extensively researched; thus, it was not clarified. Generally, the gas barrier properties were improved when the nanoclay, which was well-dispersed in the polymer matrix, availed a tortuous pathway [21,22]. Further, the WVP of the PVA/PAA blend film was 1.93 × 10−10·g/m·s·Pa. Furthermore, the WVP of the PVA/PAA/LDH (LDH 1–5) nanocomposite film was reduced to 1.64 × 10−10, 1.61 × 10−10, 1.70 × 10−10, and 1.83 × 10−10 g/m·s·Pa, respectively. Therefore, LDH 2 corresponded to the optimum composition for the water vapor barrier properties in this study, and the WVP value was reduced by 16.32% at optimum composition compared with pure PVA/PAA blend film. Next, OP was measured to evaluate the effect of LDH on the oxygen barrier properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films (Fig. 4(b)). Several LDH-related studies have revealed that LDH could avail a tortuous path toward O2 molecules in many different polymers via the dispersion or layer-by-layer method [34,35,38,39]. Therefore, LDH was expected to enhance the oxygen barrier properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films in this study. The OP of the PVA/PAA blend film was 7.11 × 10−5·cc/m·day. Expectedly, the OP values of the PVA/PAA/LDH (LDH 1–5) films were reduced to 4.04 × 10−5, 3.68 × 10−5, 4.52 × 10−5, and 5.79 × 10−5 ·cc/m·day, respectively. Therefore, LDH 2 was selected as the optimum composition for achieving the oxygen barrier properties of PVA/PAA/LDH, and the OP value was reduced by 48.23% compared with pure PVA/PAA blend film at optimum composition. Moreover, the oxygen barrier properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were significantly improved even at a low LDH concentration. Thus, the reductions in the values of WVP and OP indicated that the well-dispersed LDH in the PVA/PAA matrix could avail a tortuous pathway toward the gas molecules, especially O2. Moreover, the reductions might be due to the new interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, between LDH and the polymer matrix (PVA or PAA). However, the gas barrier properties decreased when the LDH content exceeded 2%. Furthermore, the reduction in the barrier properties at an LDH content of ≥3% could be caused by the decreasing interactions, such as the ester bonds or hydrogen bonds between the –OH and –COOH groups in PVA and PAA, respectively, between the main materials (PVA and PAA), as confirmed by the FTIR results. Moreover, another probable reason for the reduction in the gas barrier properties of the nanocomposite film is the aggregation and uneven surface morphology (Fig. 3)."
13,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties The stress–strain curves for the PVA/PAA blend film and PVA/PAA/LDH composite films are shown in Fig. 5(a). The mechanical properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were better than those of the PVA/PAA blend without LDH. Moreover, to investigate the trend of the mechanical properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films by loading LDH, the TS and E were measured (Fig. 5(b)). The TS and E of the LDH 0 were 73.56 MPa and 151.9%, respectively. The TS values of the LDH 1, LDH 2, LDH 3 and LDH 5 nanocomposite films were 82.08, 85.54, 78.14, and 61.01 MPa, respectively, and their E values were 49.78%, 24.88%, 19.97%, and 8.04%, respectively. As a consequence of the results, TS of LDH 2 increased by 16.29% compared with LDH 0, and then TS of PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films gradually decreased when LDH concentration of ≥3%. Conversely, the E values gradually decreased with the addition of LDH. The increase in TS and decrease in E are attributable to the strong interfacial interaction between PVA and LDH [31,32] and the brittleness of the polymer-based clay nanocomposites, which are generally more brittle than their neat polymer counterparts [31]. Moreover, the significant reduction in TS of LDH 5 is attributable to the aggregation of LDH in the polymer matrix, which is ascribable to the occurrences of debonding and formation of microvoids [31]. Additionally, these observations indicate that the mechanical properties of nanocomposite are related to the crystallinity percentage calculated from XRD data (Table S1). It can be observed that increasing the LDH content in the PVA/PAA matrix results in an increase in the crystallinity of those nanocomposite films, clarifying their brittleness at high LDH content [40]."
14,Thermal properties,"3.4 Thermal properties To gain insight into the thermal properties of the as-prepared PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films, DSC and TGA measurements were conducted. Fig. 6 shows the TGA with DSC, as well as the derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) characterizations of neat PVA and PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposites film. Fig. 6(a) shows the DSC curves of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films with different LDH contents. It was observed that an increase in the LDH content caused a corresponding increase in glass transition temperature (T g ) and melting temperature (T m ) of the obtained nanocomposite films. It might be caused by reduction of free side chain of the polymer matrix. The thermal degradation characteristics of PVA have been typically explained in three stages: water evaporation, degradation of the side chain of PVA, and the degradation of the main chain of PVA along with the degradation of the carbon char [10]. Fig. 6(b) shows that the TGA curve of the neat PVA film exhibited similar characteristics to those of a previous study [10]. A significant weight loss, which was due to the evaporation of moisture, was observed at the initial stage (25–180 °C). The weight loss after this stage (≥180 °C) was attributed to the decomposition of the side chain (200–380 °C). Thereafter, the final degradation stage (380–520 °C) exhibited a weight loss, which corresponded to the degradation of the main polymer chain along with carbon. The TGA characteristics of the PVA/PAA and PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films revealed temperature shifts toward higher values compared with those of neat PVA. Thus, it can be assumed that the interactions between PVA and PAA enhanced their thermal stabilities, as reported by Lim et al. [5]. Compared with the PVA/PAA blend films, the TGA properties of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were somewhat enhanced, but not significantly. This can be attributed to the thermal stability of LDH, as reported by Mallakpour et al. [42]. Fig. 6 (b) shows the following trend for the DTG curves of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films: increasing the LDH content caused the peaks of the degradation area of the side chain (200–400 °C) to shift toward a higher temperature, while the peaks of the region of the degradation of the main chain (400–550 °C) remained unchanged. These findings indicated that the interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, between LDH and the side chain of the PVA/PAA polymer matrix, induced an increase in thermal stability. Owing to the thermal stability of LDH [42] and its interaction with the PVA/PAA polymer matrix, the thermal stability of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite film was slightly increased, and Tm shifted toward higher temperatures."
15,Optical properties,"3.5 Optical properties The optical properties of the film are important factors that affects the appearance and the additive functions of packaging, such as UV – blocking properties. Thus, the optical properties were evaluated from the transmittance (Fig. 7 ) and photographs of the nanocomposite films. Transmittances were investigated at 600 nm (T600) for measuring the transparency and 230 nm (T230) to indicate the UV – blocking property. T600 of LDH 0 were 92.07 ± 0.68%, and T600 of the PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films slightly decreased up to 85.57% However, it still exhibited high transmittance, which was visible to the naked eye . In the case of T230, LDH 0 showed 87.58 ± 3.78%, and T230 of PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films were decreased up to 64.57 ± 4.78%, respectively. Many previous studies reported the UV-absorbing function of LDH [6,33,34], and Shi et al. reported the strong UV-shield function of the LDH/PAA multilayer films at UVC (220–290 nm) [23]. Therefore, PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite films exhibited UV-shielding properties caused by the LDH and still maintained the positive point of PVA (high transmittance under visible light), which can have advantage to protect the ingredient of food or medicine from the UV."
16,Conclusion,"In this study, the properties of a PVA/PAA/LDH nanocomposite film were evaluated based on the different LDH contents. These films were prepared via a relatively facile method with ultrasonication. From the FTIR and XRD results, LDH can affect the interaction between PVA/PAA polymer matrix and can interact with polymer matrix via hydrogen bond or PAA-LDH intercalation. In conclusion, the addition of LDH to the PVA/PAA blend film enhanced its water vapor and oxygen barrier properties and improved its mechanical properties, thermal stability, and UV-shielding properties while maintaining transparency. Moreover, the LDH content of 2% in nanocomposite film exhibited the optimal properties (WVP, OP, and mechanical properties). These nanocomposite films are potentially nontoxic and ecofriendly materials exhibiting enhanced properties; thus, they can be employed in the food or pharmaceutical packaging field for green packaging application."
