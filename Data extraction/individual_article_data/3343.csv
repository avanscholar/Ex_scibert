1,Chemicals and reagents,"1.1 Chemicals and reagents All chemicals used in this study are of analytical grade and without further purification. Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate is purchased from Sinopharm Chemistry Reagent Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). Thiourea (99%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (98%), sodium sulfite (98%), and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (99.9%) are obtained from J&K Chemical Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China)."
2,Preparation of CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions,"1.2 Preparation of CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions A one-pot synthesis method was used to prepare the heterostructure. A certain amount of cadmium nitrate and thiourea (the molar ratio of cadmium and sulfur = 1:1, 1:2, 1:4) are added into mortar and then grind them into uniform powder. Then samples are obtained by heating the mixture in muffle furnace at 200°C for 2 hr at a heating rate of 5°C/min. The obtained yellow materials were washed with ultrapure water and alcohol three times and dried at 60°C for 12 hr. The samples are named by the portion of Cd and S, reaction temperature, reaction time. For instance, CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 means the ratio of Cd to S is 1:2 and the reaction temperature is set at 200°C for two hours."
3,Preparation of CdS with hydrothermal method,"1.3 Preparation of CdS with hydrothermal method The traditional CdS materials were obtained by a hydrothermal method. First, 0.50 g cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate and 0.25 g thiourea were dissolved in 40 mL H2O then the solution was transferred into an autoclave heating at 180°C for 12 hr. After natural cooling, the obtained powder was washed with water and alcohol three times and then dried at 60°C for 12 hr."
4,Preparation of C3N4,1.4 Preparation of C3N4 The bulk C3N4 powder is prepared by pyrolyzing thiourea at 550°C for 2 hr in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°C/min.
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"1.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction We have applied a photocatalytic activity evaluation system to assess the photocatalysis activity of samples which consists of a photocatalysis reactor and gas chromatography (GC) devices aiming to detect the type and amount of the produced gasses. In the photocatalysis process, 25 mg of catalyst was put into 50 mL solution which contains 0.3 mol/L sodium sulfite and 0.25 mol/L sodium sulfate serving as sacrificial agents. Furthermore, 3 wt.% of platinum (related to the amount of catalyst) is serving as a promoter in the reaction system by photoreduction of platinum acid. The whole reaction system was stirred with a magnetic rotor at the speed of 400 r/min. A 300 W xenon light (CEL-HXF300F3, China Education Au-light, China) source was placed 20 cm above the liquid level to stimulate the reaction and light with wavelength below 420 nm was filtered. Circulated cooling water was used to keep the reaction temperature at 20°C. The produced gasses were transferred into GC devices for detection with pure nitrogen as carrying gas."
6,Characterization methods,"1.6 Characterization methods Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Almelo, Netherlands) using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation was utilized to obtain the phrase of the catalysts. The topography of the catalysts was conducted by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU-8020, Hitachi, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) at accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out by Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi equipment (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher, USA), and the X-ray source was Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra in the 4000–400 cm−1 region was tested on a NEXUS 670 infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (NEXUS 670, Thermo Nicolet, USA). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were collected using a Hitachi U-3900 (U-3900, Hitachi, Japan) ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (BaSO4 as a reflectance standard). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient fluorescence lifetime of samples were detected on an FLSP920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, England). Visible-light irradiation was provided by a CEL-HXF300F3 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300F3, China Education Au-light, China). Photocurrent was investigated on a CHI 660B electrochemical analyzer (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) in a standard three-electrode system, using a platinum foil as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was a 0.2 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The working electrodes were prepared as following steps: 5 mg of photocatalyst powder was dispersed in 2 mL of ethanol, which was dip-coated on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. Subsequently, 0.25% (V/V) nafion-ethanol solution was dripped onto the sample film and dried at 60°C. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction condition at 420 nm wavelength. The AQE was calculated according to Eq. (1) (1) QE ( % ) = N Reacted electrons N Incident photons × 100 % = N Evolved H 2 molecules × 2 N Incident photons × 100 % where NX is the number of species X."
7,DFT calculation,"1.7 DFT calculation The density functional theory (DFT) implementation in CP2K/Quickstep (VandeVondele et al., 2005) is based on hybrid Gaussian plane wave (GPW) (VandeVondele et al., 2005) scheme. All electrons were represented by Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) (Goedecker et al., 1996; Hartwigsen et al., 1998) preudopotentials. The Gaussian basis set was double- with one set of polarization functions (DZVP) (VandeVondele and Hutter, 2007) and the plane wave cutoff was set to 400 Ry. The geometries were optimized by Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) minimizer. Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) (Perdew et al., 1996) functional was used to describe the exchange-correlation effects. And the calculation of the charge density difference was based on the optimized structure. The band structure and density of state was conducted mainly by CASTEP module. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) approach and the (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation functional are used. A cutoff energy of 517.0 eV and a Γ-centered k-point sampling of 2 × 2 × 2 is adopted. Self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance is set as 1.0 × 10−6 eV. All structures are fully optimized by CP2K."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Formation mechanisms and properties of CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions,"2.1 Formation mechanisms and properties of CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions At melting state, transitional metal Cd and sulfur would have a strong cohesion with each other to form CdS, which simultaneously elevates the reaction temperature above 400°C (Mukasyan and Manukyan, 2019; Nasir et al., 2019). At such high temperature, the generation of poly (triazine imide) from thiourea is possible. In the present study, we utilize Cd(NO3)2 as metal source and thiourea as both carbon nitrogen and sulfur source. The melting point of Cd(NO3)2 and thiourea is 60 and 177°C, respectively. When the initial temperature is set at 177–230°C, the molten Cd2+ is sealed under liquid thiourea to decrease the chance to contact with air and is protected from changing into CdO before reacting with thiourea. The exothermic reaction between Cd and S causes the thermal decomposition and polymerization of thiourea to generate C3N4. Furthermore, due to the two different gas-producing functional groups (C=S and –NH2), the thiourea is helpful to produce a large amount of gas (NH2CN, H2S, CO2 and NH3), which endows reducing or inert atmosphere of the reaction system and leaves numerous pores in the obtained products. Therefore, the obtained powders are loose and porous and have encountered obvious explosion after reaction for 2–4 hr (Fig. S1). The color of the porous products is yellow to light orange according to the content of CdS phase in the nanocomposites. If only individual Cd(NO3)2 or thiourea powders are heated at this temperature ranges, the powders become white owing to loose of water without explosion. This one-pot facile synthesis method does not require complex pretreatment or any solvent, which makes higher atom utilization and less pollution compared with the traditional solution combustion synthesis technique. The structure and phase of the as-prepared samples are revealed by their XRD patterns. The XRD data presented in Fig. 1 suggest that CdS synthesized with hydrothermal method belongs to the hexagonal wurtzite phase (PDF #41–1049), and the diffraction peaks at 24.84°, 26.56°, 28.20°, 36.62°, 43.76° and 51.88° can be indexed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (112) planes, respectively. The C3N4 derived from thiourea shows two explicit peaks located at ~15° and ~27°, respectively, which can be ascribed to (100) and (002) planes of graphite phase (JCPDS NO. 87–1526) (Zhang et al., 2012). In the XRD patterns of all the CdS/C3N4 nanocomposites, the diffusion peaks at 26.56°, 43.76° and 51.88° are observed, confirming the presence of wurtzite CdS in the nanojunctions. However, the peaks for C3N4 are absent, which might suggest the amorphous state of the C3N4 component. The initial temperature affects the crystalline degree of the nanojunctions. As the temperature is set at 177°C, the crystalline degree of CdS phase is poor, which indicates that this temperature can not efficiently trigger the interaction between Cd(NO3)2 and thiourea. The crystallinity of CdS phase improves obviously as the initial temperature changes from 177 to 200°C, and then becomes worse again when the initial temperature further increases to 230°C. This result suggests that the reaction temperature of 200°C is high enough to ignite exothermic reaction between Cd and S and formation of C3N4. If the temperature is much higher than the melting point of thiourea, the gradual decomposition of thiourea weakens the interaction between Cd(NO3)2 and thiourea, which is adverse to the formation of CdS. Fig. 1 also shows that the nanojunction has bad crystallized CdS phase if the reaction time is 1 hr. As the reaction time increases to 2 hr, the crystallinity of CdS improves obviously; and further prolonging of the reaction time (4 hr) hardly triggers change of the crystalline degree. It is worth mentioning the CdS phase remains un-oxidized even if the CdS/C3N4 powders are heated at 200°C in air atmosphere for several hours. This might be attributed to the strong interaction between CdS and C3N4 phase or special structure of the nanocomposites preventing oxidation of CdS under heat. The molar ratio of cadmium and sulfur in the starting material plays an important role on the successful formation of CdS/C3N4 nanojunction. If the ratio of cadmium and sulfur is 1:1, the obtained CdS/C3N4–1:1–200–2 sample is composed of wurtzite CdS and CdO. The XRD pattern of CdS/C3N4–1:1–200–2 shows that the CdS phase has good crystallinity and the diffusion peaks at about 32.5°, 37.8°, and 55.4° can be indexed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of CdO (PDF#05–0640), respectively. When the ratio of cadmium and sulfur decreases to 1:2 and 1:4, the CdO phase is absent and the diffusion peaks of CdS weaken compared to those of CdS/C3N4–1:1–200–2, which might be caused by the presence of amorphous C3N4. This result suggests that excess thiourea materials are required to trigger the interaction between Cd and S, formation of C3N4, and emission of enough inert or reductive gas to protect CdS from oxidation. The presence of C3N4 in the CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions can be confirmed by the FT-IR spectra. As shown in Fig 2 b, C3N4 presents a main absorption region at about ~1240–1640 cm−1 which can be ascribed to the characteristic stretching vibration modes of C=N heterocycles and a sharp peaks at ~800 cm−1 generated by the characteristic breathing mode of triazine (Fu et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2020) . For pure CdS, the absorption band at 2331, 1630, 1100, and 616 cm−1 can be attributed to Cd-S band (Fu et al., 2013; Ge et al., 2012). Comparing with CdS, the nanocomposites show additional absorption peaks at ~800 cm−1 and absorption region at ~1300–1700 cm−1, proving the existence of C3N4 in the nanojunctions. The intensities of peaks for CN and triazine rings are low in sample CdS/C3N4–1:2–177–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:1–200–2, suggesting that the low yield of C3N4 in these samples due to the deficient interaction between Cd(NO3)2 and thiourea (Fig. S2). In general, both the XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra prove that this simple method can successfully form CdS/C3N4 composites. The morphologies of the nanocomposites are observed with SEM and HR-TEM images. Pores can be clearly observed in the CdS/C3N4–200–1:2–2 samples owing to the production of gas during combustion and interaction of the reaction system. The CdS phase is in cubic structure and inlaid on the surface of C3N4 or embedded into C3N4 component. High resolution SEM image in Fig. 3 c demonstrates that the C3N4 phase is fluffy and firmly wraps the CdS cubes. Element mapping in Fig. 3d-i shows that the fluffy phase is mainly composed of C and N atoms, and the cubic structure consists of Cd and S elements, indicating that the fluffy and cubic phases are C3N4 and CdS particles, respectively. The enclosing of CdS by C3N4 components prevents oxidation of CdS by air in the heating process. HR-TEM is examined to further analyze the morphology and structure of the composite. In Fig. 4 a, the lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21, 0.24 and 0.31 nm should be assigned to the hkl (110), (102), and (101) of CdS, respectively. The lattice fringes of 0.36 nm in Fig. 4b can be ascribed to (002) of C3N4. This result confirms the coexistence of CdS and C3N4 phase in the nanocomposites. XPS analysis is performed to further study the elemental compositions and chemical state of the composite. As shown in Fig 4a, the C 1 s spectrum of C3N4 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at ~284.98 and ~288.66 eV, which is originated from the graphic carbon and sp2 hybridized C−(N)3 bond, respectively (Liu et al., 2015). The N1s spectrum can be fitted into three species centered at ~398.9, ~399.8, and ~400.8 eV, corresponding to sp2 hybridized nitrogen atom in C−N=C, bridging tertiary nitrogen with carbon atom (N-(C)3), and N−H groups, respectively (Jiang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2013), respectively. For Cd, two peaks at 405.35 and 412.0 eV are ascribed to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively (Chu et al., 2012). The S 2p spectrum is deconvoluted into S2− 2p3/2 (161.45 eV), S2 − 2p1/2 (162.62 eV), S n 2− (163.79 eV), and the oxidized S species (168.21 and 169.4 eV). The chemical compositions and state of each element on the surface of other composites are similar with that of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 (Figs. S3 and S4). To find the connection of C3N4 and CdS, we compared the XPS spectrum of the special and crucial element S. For CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2, the high resolution of S2p spectrum is almost the same with CdS. However, for CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2, the binding energy has changed about 0.2 eV, which can be ascribed to the interaction of CdS and C3N4 (produced by thiroea) among the reaction process. The interaction caused by S may be an essential and beneficial factor for electron transfer, which can partly explain the difference of photocatalytic performance. The HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) efficiency of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 is much better than CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2. Meantime, the interaction can make the whole system more stable. Element analysis indicates that the portion of C3N4 in CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 is about 20% and 45%, respectively. The ratio of C/N in thiourea derived C3N4, CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2, and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 is about 0.66, 0.708, and 0.608, respectively, which are close to the ideal C/N ratio of triazine (0.75). The investigations on the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors are favorable to better understand the origin of its photocatalytic activity. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of pure CdS, C3N4 and CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 nanojunctions are shown in Fig. 5 . Compared to C3N4, the adsorption edges of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 are obviously red-shifted with enhanced optical adsorption across the entire tested wavelength range. The energy band gap (E g) can be calculated by the following formula: (2) a h v = A ( h v − E g ) n 2 where a, hv and A represent the absorption coefficient, photon energy, and proportional coefficient, respectively. The integer n depends on the transition characteristics of the semiconductor (n = 4 for direct transition; n = 1 for indirect transition). Both CdS and C3N4 are direct transition materials (n = 1) (Dong and Zhang, 2012). The energy band gaps of the samples can be obtained from the plots of (ahv)2 vs. hv, as shown in Fig. 5b. The band gap of pure CdS, C3N4, CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 is calculated to be 2.25, 2.81, 2.32 and 2.35 eV, respectively. The generation, transfer, and recombination rate of the photoexcited charge carriers are detected by a series of photoelectrochemical characterizations. The comparison for transient photocurrent response of different samples with light on and off is illustrated in Fig. 6 a. The C3N4 exhibits the weakest photocurrent response. The photocurrent density of the CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 nanojunctions electrode produced under visible light irradiation is about 8 and 3 times that of C3N4 electrode, respectively. This result reflects that the formation of CdS/C3N4 nanojunction improves visible light response ability and promotes the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes. Then we use photoluminescence (PL) spectra to detect the recombination rate of photoexcited electrons and holes, whose intensity is positively correlated to the recombination degree (You et al., 2018). The C3N4 shows the highest PL emission intensity among all the samples, indicating the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. The peak intensity in the PL spectra of CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2, CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 and CdS are extremely low, which suggests the weak recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes in these samples. Fluorescence decay lifetime curve can better illustrate the separation, transfer, and recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes. As can be seen in Fig. 6c, the pure CdS (0.268 nsec) and C3N4 (7.877 nsec) exhibit the shortest and longest radiative lifetime, respectively. While, the radiative lifetime of CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 is slight shorter (3.440 nsec) than that of C3N4, and CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 possesses similar short radiative lifetime (0.328 nsec) with CdS. Compared to C3N4, the remarkably shortened exciton lifetime evidently demonstrates promoted exciton dissociation in the CdS/C3N4 photocatalyst. Thus, the declination of photoluminescence intensity together with the shortened radiative lifetime certifies the increased exciton dissociation on CdS/C3N4 nanojunctions (Fu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019)."
10,Photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction,"2.2 Photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction Visible light photocatalytic water splitting to produce renewable H2 is used to evaluate the catalytic performance of as-prepared materials. The photocatalytic HER rate of pristine C3N4 and CdS is 178 and 1833 μmol/(g∙hr) among the first cycle for three hours, respectively. CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 exhibits the highest hydrogen evolution rate (15,866 μmol/(g∙hr)), which is nearly 89 and 9 times those of pristine C3N4 and CdS, respectively. Photocatalytic HER of CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 (7720 μmol/(g∙hr)) is lower than that of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 (Fig. 7 a). As CdS/C3N4–1:2–177–2, CdS/C3N4–1:2–230–2, and CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–1 is adopted as photocatalyst, the photocatalytic HER is only 258, 1899 and 2035 μmol/(g∙hr), respectively, which might result from the poor crystallinity of CdS phase in the nanojunctions. Although CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–4 possesses similar crystallinity of CdS phase with that of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2, the photocatalytic HER (3029 μmol/(g∙hr)) is remarkably lower than that of the latter, which indicates that the lasting heating of the produced CdS/C3N4 nanojunction might lead to the oxidation of CdS phase. The higher photocatalytic HER efficiency of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 than CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 suggests that the CdS phase play a key role on the photoreactions due to its remarkable visible light adsorption and response ability. The improved anti-corrosion ability of the nanojunctions contributes to the far higher HER efficiency than pristine CdS. The recycling experiment in Fig. 7b indicates that the photocatalytic HER efficiency of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 has not shown obvious decline after reused for 6 times. Interestingly, the CdS/C3N4–1:4–200–2 photocatalyst has not exhibited any attenuation but even better photocatalytic activity after 8 times cycles (Fig. 7c). The morphologies, crystalline and surface properties of CdS/C3N4 after reaction are studied. The results show that the XRD pattern of CdS/ C3N4–1:2–200–2 is not changed after 6 hr of reaction under visible-light irradiation. The C1s XPS lines of the used CdS/ C3N4 display the appearance of carboxyl groups, which may be caused by the oxidation of carbon in carbon nitride component during reaction. At the same time, the S atoms on the surface of used CdS/C3N4 are not oxidized compared to the as-prepared samples (Fig. 8 f). This result might suggest that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction take place in g-C3N4. The HRTEM images of the used CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 show that the lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21, 0.24 and 0.31 nm, assigning to the hkl (110), (102), and (101) of CdS, respectively, and the lattice fringes of 0.36 nm, ascribing to (002) of C3N4, are still clearly observed (Fig. 9 ). These results confirm the important function of C3N4 phase on the improvement of stability and reusability of the nanojunctions. In general, the CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 not only possesses powerful photocatalytic performance on HER, but also shows good anti-corrosion ability, which endows CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 the potential for long-term photocatalytic applications. Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 reaches 3.25% at λ = 420 ± 15 nm. The H2 production comparison with other similar photocatalysts is listed in Table S1. It can be seen that CdS/C3N4–1:2–200–2 has excellent photocatalytic performance compared to other similar materials (Fig. 10 )."
11,DFT calculation and mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions,"2.3 DFT calculation and mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions In order to disclose the underlying reasons for the excellent anti-corrosion ability of the nanojunctions, density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations of the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) for C3N4, CdS and CdS/C3N4 are performed. We speculate that the reaction starts from forming the lattice of CdS to pyrolysis thiourea into C3N4 with the released energy. So, we put the trizine structure above the dominant crystal plane with the lowest energy also known as the exposed crystal plane (110) as the main structure shown in Fig. S4. The detailed surface energy calculation can be seen in Appendix A. Supplementary data. For the CdS/C3N4 structure, the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly occupied by S 2p orbital, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of C 2p and N 2p orbitals. There is no PDOS crossing the Fermi level, which meets the characteristics of semiconductors. The work functions of CdS (110) surface and C3N4 (002) surface are calculated to be 5.24 and 4.30 eV, respectively. The difference of work function indicates the presence of charge transfer at the interface of CdS and C3N4. The greater work function of CdS will lead to the charge transfer from C3N4 to CdS until the Fermi level alignment, which will result in the production of interfacial build-in electric field (Fig. 11 ). At the interface, the surface of C3N4 is positively charged, while the surface of CdS is negatively charged. We have also calculated the charge density difference of CdS/C3N4 hybrid structure. The result is displayed in Fig. 12 a. Due to weak Van der Waals interaction between C3N4 and CdS, charge redistribution mainly occurs at the CdS/C3N4 interface, and the charge change is hardly observed on the bulk CdS, which is farther away from the interface. The planar-averaged charge density difference along the Z direction exhibits change of charge density (Fig. 12b). The positive values indicate electron accumulation, and the negative values represent electron depletion. The charge distribution at interfaces indicates that small amounts of electrons transfer from the C3N4 side to the CdS side across the interface when these two materials contact with each other (Li et al., 2018; Liu, 2015). This result proves the existence of the internal electric field from C3N4 pointing to CdS, which can more effectively promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons from CdS to C3N4 (Fig. 11). At the same time, it can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. On the other hand, Fermi level alignment not only causes the internal electric field but also leads to an upward and downward shift in the Fermi levels of CdS and C3N4, respectively. The band bending urges (Fig. 11) the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of CdS and holes in the valence band (VB) of C3N4 to be recombined (Xu et al., 2020). As a result, most HER should occur on C3N4 surface where photogenerated electrons accumulate, which largely protects CdS from conventional photo-corrosion and helps it remain robust and achieve excellent recycle ability."
