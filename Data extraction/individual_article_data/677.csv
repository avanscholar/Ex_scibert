0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the candidates to replace the current main transport energy vectors and it can also be used for power and heat generation on demand. However, nowadays there are some difficulties for hydrogen economy implantation, and one of them is the high purity required for hydrogen. This energy vector is still being mainly produced from fossil fuels reforming, where the main by-product is carbon dioxide. There are three basic methods to separate CO2 from the mixture: with sorbents/solvents, with membranes, and by cryogenic distillation. Among these strategies, the sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) process is attracting a great deal of attention because it combines both hydrogen production and CO2 separation. In the SESR process carbon dioxide is captured by an in situ sorbent, which shifts the reversible reforming and water gas shift (WGS) reactions to the product side beyond their conventional thermodynamic limits, giving rise to a higher hydrogen production [1] and lower cost [2]. The potential benefits of producing H2 by CO2 sorption enhanced reaction are: 1. Reforming at a significantly lower temperature (400−500 °C) than a conventional SR process, while achieving high conversion to hydrogen. 2 Production of hydrogen at feed gas pressure and at relatively high purity directly from the reactor. 3 Significant reduction, or even elimination, of downstream hydrogen purification steps. 4 Reduction of CO in the SESR reactor effluent to ppm levels – elimination of shift reactors. 5 Minimization of side reactions, e.g., coking. 6 Reduction of the excess steam used in conventional SR. Complete environmental advantages of introducing hydrogen will only be possible if this hydrogen is produced from renewable sources. There are different ways of producing “green hydrogen” such as from solar and wind produced electricity surplus or from biomass. If solar or wind energy are employed hydrogen has to be produced decentralized in small installations; whereas in the case of biomass bigger, more centralized and more efficient installations may be built. The use of biomass for hydrogen production is a greener route than the actual one, since its net contribution to the increase of atmospheric CO2 is much lower than employing fossil fuels. Different routes for hydrogen production from biomass can be employed. Flash pyrolysis is presented as an attractive method to produce bio-oils from different types of biomass, which can later be catalytically reformed to generate hydrogen. Bio-oils are complex mixtures and very variable, depending on the raw material being pyrolyzed and on the conditions of the pyrolysis [3]. Acetic acid is the most representative constituent of the water soluble fraction of bio-oils, but also other compounds such as aldehydes, alcohols, carboxylic acid, cresols and ketones, among others, are produced [4,5]. Acetic acid is being widely employed as model compound for hydrogen production from catalytic conventional reforming of bio-oils [6–10]. There are also some works where other model compound or a more complex mixture is reformed [11–15], and even some ones where directly bio-oil is employed [16–18]. As a reference, the overall reforming reaction of acetic acid is shown in Eq. (1), which is a combination of reforming and water gas shift, Eq. (2): (1) C H 3 C O O H g + 2 H 2 O g ↔ 4 H 2 g + 2 C O 2 ( g ) Δ H o = + 184 k J / m o l (2) C O g + H 2 O g ↔ H 2 g + C O 2 ( g ) Δ H o = - 41 k J / m o l This process is thermodynamically limited and it is not possible to achieve complete conversion of reactants. In the SESR process the CO2 is directly removed in the catalytic reactor, employing an appropriate solid sorbent, which shifts the reaction to the products side. Depending on the employed sorbent, this may react with the CO2 to generate a carbonate (chemisorption), or the CO2 may be physically adsorbed on its surface. The most widely employed sorbents in the literature are the calcium-based ones [19]. Xie et al. [20] performed thermodynamic analysis with nine CO2 sorbents in the co-existence of CO2 and H2O and they concluded that CaO had the best capacity in the temperature range (325−727 °C). A detailed sorbents’ review is done already in the work by Dou et al. [21]. The carbon dioxide capture of a CaO-based sorbent is represented in the following reaction: (3) C O 2 g + C a O s ↔ C a C O 3 s Δ H o = - 178 k J / m o l In the carbonation process of CaO there is an initial fast step controlled by chemical kinetics, and a second and slower step controlled by the diffusion in the created product (CaCO3) [22]. This reaction is exothermic and it is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures. The SESR process with CaO-based sorbent could be almost thermally neutral, but energy is required for its regeneration. In spite of considering the energy employed for the regeneration, the supplemental energy required for the whole process is less than that of conventional steam reforming [21]. The CaO-based sorbents present two main advantages: their raw materials are inexpensive and abundant (i.e. limestone or dolomite) and they exhibit good CO2 sorption kinetics and capacities at high temperatures (400−650 °C) [23]. Limestone (CaCO3) has the advantage of wider availability and a higher theoretical capacity of 0.79 gCO2/gCaO compared to the theoretical capacity of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) of 0.46 gCO2/gCaO·MgO [19]. On the other side, dolomite has shown higher stability in sorption/desorption cycles than pure CaO [24]. In addition to an adequate sorbent, highly active and selective catalysts are required for producing high purity hydrogen from the reforming of bio-oils. Ni-based catalysts are widely employed in reforming processes due to their good balance between cost, activity and stability [16,25]. However, nickel is usually affected by deactivation due to carbon deposition and sintering of Ni particles [26]. In order to improve their catalytic activity, stability and avoid or slow their deactivation, different possibilities exist, which may be summarized as follows: modifying the preparation method, changing the support and adding modifiers or promoters. In this work the effect of support and metals’ addition is analyzed. The same Ni-based catalysts were prepared over two different supports: a conventional alumina and a non-conventional olivine, in order to allow a comparison between them and analyze the effect of the support on their catalytic performance. Alumina is often employed as a support for reforming catalysts due to its good structure and chemical characteristics. Olivine sand is widely available and is actually around 10 times cheaper than the employed alumina and has already shown good behavior as support in reforming some bio-oil compounds [12]. Trying to improve their catalytic activity and stability, three different metal configurations were performed: I) only nickel, II) nickel and cobalt, III) nickel, cobalt and palladium. Cobalt addition is expected to promote CC bond rupture [6,27] and Pd addition can improve the stability of the catalyst decreasing the tendency of Ni to carbon formation [8,18,28]. Palladium addition can also increase significantly the reducibility of nickel, and can reduce the CO binding strength, decreasing the poisoning of the metal sites [29]. This tri-metal configuration has shown good catalytic performance in sorption enhanced reforming of acetic acid on hydrotalcite [30], but has never been prepared with olivine support and tested in reforming such a complex mixture. The main objective of this work was the development of different Ni-based catalysts, over conventional and non-conventional supports, to produce high purity hydrogen from CO2 sorption enhanced steam reforming of bio-oils compounds. This process presents environmental benefits compared to the conventional reforming: potentially lower energy consumption for high purity hydrogen production [31,32], and CO2 capture, allowing either its storage or its use to produce other chemicals. Novel olivine supported catalysts were compared with more conventional alumina supported ones. There is a lot of bibliography about acetic acid reforming and alumina catalysts, but our aim was to check if alumina could be replaced by a widely available and cheaper support: olivine sand. The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was tested both with acetic acid and with a more complex mixture, which is closer to the real application. The effect of Co and Pd addition to the catalysts was tested, together with the effect of the complex composition of the feed. The obtained catalytic performance was discussed together with the characterization results, in order to better understand the activity and stability results. Another goal was to determine whether a raw and cheap dolomite could be employed as CO2 sorbent, which was compared to an Arctic Dolomite."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Three different catalyst types were prepared: Ni-based over a conventional support (γ-alumina), Ni-based over an unconventional support (olivine) and Ni-based hydrotalcite. Alumina and olivine supported catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. Olivine sand (48 wt% MgO, 41 wt% SiO2 and 8 wt% Fe2O3) was provided by a casting company “Ilarduya y Cía”. Prior to impregnation supports were calcined at 700 °C during 4 h in air, to minimize structural changes during the tests. With each support three different catalysts were prepared: I) 40 wt% Ni; II) 30 wt% Ni and 10 wt% Co; III) 30 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Co and 1 wt% Pd. The metallic precursors employed were the following: • Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrated (99.999 wt% Sigma-Aldrich). • Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrated (98 wt% Sigma-Aldrich). • Palladium (II) nitrate dihydrated (40 % Pd basis, Sigma-Aldrich). In order to get the desired composition of the catalysts, an appropriate amount of support and metallic precursors were mixed, with 10 ml of distilled water per gram of support. The suspension kept stirring overnight. The excess of water was evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000) at 45 °C and vacuum. Once most of the solvent was evaporated, the resulting solid was introduced in an oven at 110 °C during 12 h, to ensure complete drying. Then, the catalysts were calcined in air atmosphere at 700 °C, with heating rate of 3 °C/min, and keeping this temperature during 4 h. Finally, they were pressed and sieved in order to obtain a particle size of 0.42 < dp < 0.50 mm. This particle size was selected with the aim of maintaining an internal pipe diameter-to-particle diameter higher than 10, to avoid reactants to bypass near the wall [33]. The nickel hydrotalcite catalyst was prepared at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology by the group of Prof. De Chen. It was prepared by co-precipitation of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)3·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and the nominal composition was 20 wt% Ni. Further explanations can be found in Fermoso et al. [34]. The prepared catalysts were named as follows: Ni/Al2O3, NiCo/Al2O3, NiCoPd/Al2O3, Ni/Olivine, NiCo/Olivine, NiCoPd/Olivine and Ni/HC."
3,CO2 sorbents,"2.2 CO2 sorbents Two dolomites were employed as Ca precursors for CO2 sorption. One of them was an Arctic dolomite supplied by Franefoss Miljøkalk A/S, Norway. According to the documentation provided by the supplier, its purity was approximately 98.5 wt% CaMg(CO3)2 and it had no sulphur according to X-ray fluorescence analysis [34]. The other dolomite, named as Castro Dolomite, was a raw dolomite taken directly from the quarry and supplied by “Dolomitas del Norte” in Castrourdiales, Cantabria (Spain), part of the Calcinor group. The Castro Dolomite was analyzed with X-ray Fluorescence and a purity of 99.5 wt% CaMg(CO3)2 and no sulphur was detected. Even though the composition of the two dolomites was similar, their physical aspect was not. Arctic Dolomite was “sugar-type” dolomite, which is converted to fine dust with small pressure. On the other hand, Castro Dolomite was “sand-type” dolomite, which is made by smaller grains with strong bond between grains and very compact. If the same pressure is applied to both dolomites, “sugar-type” dolomite is converted to fine dust while the “sand-type” remains as grains. Both dolomites were calcined in a muffle oven in air atmosphere at 700 °C during 4 h before the sorption tests."
4,Characterization of sorbents and catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of sorbents and catalysts Diverse characterization techniques were employed in order to determine the physicochemical properties of the fresh-reduced materials: inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), CO chemisorption, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3 TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). ICP-OES: With this technique, Ni, Co and Pd contents of the catalysts were determined. The solid samples were firstly disaggregated in acid solution (mixture of HF, HNO3 and HCl) and then analyzed in a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300DV equipment. N2 adsorption-desorption: Textural properties of the catalysts, such as BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter were determined in an Autosorb 1C-TCD. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed at 300 °C during 12 h. The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) method, and pore size distribution is calculated using the Barrett‐Joyner‐Halenda (BJH) method. CO chemisorption: The cumulative adsorbed CO, metal dispersion and active surface area of the previously reduced catalysts were determined by CO-pulse chemisorption in a Micromeritics® AutoChem II. Samples were firstly reduced in a 5 % H2-Ar mixture at 700 °C (8 h), and then CO chemisorption capacity was measured at 35 °C in a 5 % CO-He mixture until peaks were equal. The stoichiometric number for CO chemisorption over Ni, Co and Pd was taken as S = 1. NH3 TPD: Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 was used in order to know the acid characteristics of the calcined and reduced samples. The employed equipment was a Micromeritics® AutoChem II instrument. First of all, samples were reduced at 700 °C in a 5 % H2-Ar mixture, then they were flushed by He for 30 min, followed by cooling at 100 °C and loading of NH3 for 30 min. Then, the physically adsorbed NH3 was removed using He at 150 °C until no further desorption was recorded and release of chemically adsorbed NH3 was collected increasing temperature from 150 °C to 895 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. TPR: The reducible species present in the calcined samples, and their reduction temperatures, were determined in a Micromeritics® AutoChem II instrument. A continuous flow of 5 % H2-Ar (45 N mL/min) was passed over approximately 0.1 g of sieved sample. The temperature of the samples was increased from room temperature to 900 °C at 1 °C/min (the same heating rate employed during the activation of the catalysts in the bench-scale pilot plant prior to the experiments). XRD: Crystalline species and approximation of the average crystal size (by Scherrer equation) of the reduced samples (at 700 °C during 4 h) were calculated with the X-ray diffractograms obtained using a Seifert XRD 3000 P diffractometer, equipped with a PWBragge-Brentano q/2q 2200 goniometer, bent graphite monochromator and automatic slit, using a Cu Kα radiation. XRD technique can measure around 1−2 μm depth of the sample. XPS: Elemental composition at the catalysts’ surface was determined with the XPS patterns of fresh-reduced catalysts in a SPECS (Berlin, Germany) system equipped with a Phoibos 150 1D-DLD analyzer and an Al Kα (1486.6 V) monochromatic radiation source with electrons output angle of 90°. This technique can measure at about 10−20 nm depth of the sample, so compared to XRD it can be considered a surface analysis."
5,Reformer feed conditions,"2.4 Reformer feed conditions Initially acetic acid was used as a model compound of the organic acids present in the aqueous phase of bio-oils, which has being widely studied in the literature. The employed steam to carbon (S/C) ratio was 5 and the weight hour space velocity 0.8 greactants·gcatalyst −1 h−1. The prepared mixture for reforming had the following composition: 24.9 wt% acetic acid (Panreac 100 %) 75.1 wt% distillate water Secondly, a more complex mixture of model compounds was selected for reforming. The aqueous organic mixture feed was fixed in order to keep the same moles of C fed per catalyst mass and time employed in the acetic acid tests (0.0265 molC·gcat −1 h−1). The carbon moles fed are directly proportional to the CO2 produced, and therefore we could ensure that the maximum amount of CO2 arriving to the sorbent in all the performed tests was the same. The composition of pyrolysis bio-oils is very complex and is very sensitive to raw material, pyrolysis conditions and post-treatment of the condensable liquid phase. In this work compounds representative of the main groups usually present in the bio-oils were chosen: acetic acid as representative of the acids, acetone of the ketones, furfural of the aldehydes, 1-butanol of the linear alcohols and phenol [35]. The specific composition of the mixture was decided taking into account its relative presence in the bio-oils and the solubility of each compound [36]. The employed weight hour space velocity was 3.8 greactants·gcatalyst −1 h−1 and a higher S/C ratio was selected (S/C = 7), trying to decrease the coke formation. Steam to carbon ratios selected are higher than the ones to be used in industry, but they are usually employed in order to be able to study the activities in an environment where deactivation by coke deposition is delayed [37–40]. In all the cases, the reactant aqueous organic mixture feed was kept stirring during the tests, in order to ensure a homogeneous mixture feed to the reactor. The complex mixture had the following composition: 3.8 wt% acetic acid (Panreac 100 %) 3.7 wt% acetone (Sigma-Aldrich ≥99.0 %) 1.5 wt% phenol (Sigma- Aldrich ≥99.0 %) 0.3 wt% furfural (Sigma-Aldrich 99.0 %) 4.6 wt% 1-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich ≥99.7 %) 86.1 wt% distillate water The complete reforming reactions of the employed reactants are indicated below. Acetic acid: C 2 H 4 O 2 g + 2 H 2 O g ↔ 2 C O 2 g + 4 H 2 ( g ) ΔH°(25 °C)=181 kJ/mol Acetone: C 3 H 6 O g + 5 H 2 O g ↔ 3 C O 2 g + 8 H 2 (g) ΔH°(25 °C)=247 kJ/mol Phenol: C 6 H 6 O g + 11 H 2 O g ↔ 6 C O 2 g + 14 H 2 ( g ) ΔH°(25 °C)=395 kJ/mol Furfural: C 5 H 4 O 2 g + 8 H 2 O g ↔ 5 C O 2 g + 10 H 2 ( g ) ΔH°(25 °C)=118 kJ/mol 1-butanol: C 4 H 10 O g + 7 H 2 O g ↔ 4 C O 2 g + 12 H 2 ( g ) ΔH°(25 °C)=394 kJ/mol"
6,Sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) experiments,"2.5 Sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) experiments SESR tests were performed in a bench-scale pilot plant (PID Eng&Tech) at atmospheric pressure. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure S1. It consisted of a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor (8 mm internal diameter and 30 cm length) electrically heated in a furnace. The reactor temperature was controlled with a K-type thermocouple located inside the reactor just before the catalyst/sorbent bed. The reactor was fed with 0.5 g of catalyst mixed with 2.5 g of dolomite. They were both fresh before each SESR test. The feed gas flows were controlled with Bronkhorst® mass flow controllers, and the aqueous solution was fed with a Gilson® HPLC pump. The liquid mixture was vaporized when entering to the reactor due to the high temperature. The effluent stream was cooled and condensed, and the gas phase was analyzed online by a Varian MicroGC. The MicroGC was calibrated employing a standard gas mixture at periodic intervals. The flow rates of the outflow species (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) were estimated based on the nitrogen flow rate fed as the inert standard. Description of a typical operation procedure follows. The catalyst was firstly reduced at 700 °C during 8 h, with a heating rate of 1 °C/min, and 40 N ml/min of a N2:H2 1:1 mixture. This procedure was performed directly in the reactor. Then, the temperature was decreased to 575 °C in nitrogen atmosphere, to purge the reactor before starting the SESR tests. Once at 575 °C, the liquid mixture (0.0263 ml/min in acetic acid tests and 0.0324 ml/min in complex mixture tests) plus 16 N ml/min of N2, employed as internal standard, were fed to the reactor and the SESR test started. As soon as the dolomite was saturated with CO2 the conventional SR took place, which was allowed to reach the steady state to compare the SR results with the SESR ones. After the composition of the reaction outflow was kept stable for around 30 min, desorption step was initiated. In order to desorb the CO2 reactor temperature was increased until 750 °C at 30 °C/min under air atmosphere. In these conditions, the CO2 could be desorbed and, if carbon deposition occurred during the SESR process, it could be burned and the catalyst and sorbent could be regenerated. Once all the CO2 had been desorbed (when CO2 was not detected in the outflow during around 15 min), the reactivation step started. In the reactivation step, temperature was decreased back to 575 °C in N2:H2 1:1 mixture during 30 min. Then, hydrogen flow was stopped and only nitrogen was fed during 10 min, in order to be sure that all the hydrogen detected in SESR step was only the one produced in the reactions. The sorption and desorption cycles were repeated three times for each catalyst/sorbent mixture. After the third cycle, some tests were prolonged during around 48 h in order to analyze the stability of those catalysts in SR conditions. During the SESR tests, H2 yield (the produced hydrogen moles divided by the maximum hydrogen that could have been theoretically formed), selectivity to hydrogen (selectivity for hydrogen atoms to form molecular hydrogen instead of forming other hydrogen containing molecules, in our case only methane was detected) and H2 purity in the outflow were calculated according to Eqs 4 and 5, respectively. (4) H 2 y i e l d % = 100 · F H 2 4 F A c e t i c a c i d + 8 F A c e t o n e + 14 F p h e n o l + 10 F f u r f u r a l + 12 F b u t a n o l (5) H 2 s e l e c t i v i t y % = 100 · 2 · y H 2 2 · y H 2 + 4 · y C H 4 Where, FH2 is the molar flow rate of the H2 produced (mol/min) calculated from the effluent gas composition given by the MicroGC with nitrogen as internal standard, and the total exit gas flow measured. Fi is the molar flow rate of the i compound fed (mol/min), and yH2 and yCH4 are the produced molar fractions of H2 and CH4 respectively (N2 free and on dry basis). The turnover frequency (TOF, s-1) of the different catalysts, representing the intrinsic activities at the different tested conditions and two different aqueous organic mixture feeds, was calculated according to Eq. 6. The moles of active metal were calculated taking into account the total metal content corrected by the dispersion obtained with CO chemisorption. The TOF number was calculated following the definition given by Miao et al., among others, [41–43]. (6) T O F = m o l H 2 p r o d u c e d / s ( m o l a c t i v e m e t a l ) The carbon dioxide adsorbed before saturation of the dolomite was estimated in all the tests. The CO2 concentration curve in the reactor outlet during the steam reforming was integrated and the CO2 produced during the SESR was then subtracted."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of sorbents,"3.1 Characterization of sorbents 3.1.1 N2 adsorption-desorption In the current section, the surface structure of both Castro and Arctic calcined dolomites will be analyzed with the N2 adsorption-desorption data. In Table 1 a summary of the main structural information is given and the first critical difference between the dolomites is observed: the BET surface area. This is a method developed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller to derive the surface area from physisorption isotherm data and is a simplification extension of the Langmuir mechanism to multilayer adsorption. Nevertheless, it is widely employed in sorbents characterization, and it will be employed here with comparison purpose. Sorption is a surface phenomenon, intensely affected by the surface area. Therefore, a high area is expected to have a positive effect on its sorption capacity. The surface area of the two dolomites is very different. In the work by Orio et al. they tested different quarries’ dolomites and they also observed high variation in their surface structure [44]. The big difference in area can be related to the physical differences between the two dolomites, described in section 2.2, having the Castro Dolomite (“sand-type” dolomite with compact grains) very small surface area and volume. In Fig. 1 the complete adsorption-desorption isotherms for both dolomites are given. Arctic Dolomite corresponds to isotherm Type IV according to IUPAC classification of adsorption isotherms [45]. This sorption/desorption curve with hysteresis is typical in mesoporous solids. In this type of solids, sorption process is mainly determined by the sorbent-adsorbate interactions and by the condensate molecules interactions. The monolayer-multilayer initial sorption in the porous walls is followed by the condensation in the pores. When hysteresis appears is usually indicating that capillary condensation occurs in the pores. The interpretation of the sorption/desorption curve of Castro Dolomite was not reliable, due to a low surface area of the sample, and therefore the low accuracy of the measurement. As indicated before, analyzing the isotherms can be observed that both dolomites were mesoporous materials, but Arctic Dolomite presented higher volume of pores. In addition, is also interesting to analyze the pore diameter distribution, as it strongly affects the sorption process of CO2 on the sorbent surface. Furthermore, the solid CaCO3 has around double specific molar volume than CaO [46]. Therefore, the particle porosity is reduced as sorption occurs, which can increase the pore diffusion resistance in the sorbent. Hu et al. showed in their work this pore change due to carbonation with SEM images in a Ca-based sorbent [47]. In Table 1, the average pore diameter estimated by BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) method is shown, which were similar for both dolomites. Additional pore diameter analysis can be done comparing the cumulative pore surface change at different pore diameters. The Arctic Dolomite presented a big amount of pores between 30 and 40 Å, which were the ones generating the high surface area (Fig. S2). 3.1.2 CO chemisorption This technique is usually employed to analyze the metal dispersion of catalysts, but in the case of the sorbents it was just employed qualitatively, in order to check if there was a difference in the interaction of the dolomites and CO. The CO adsorbed Cumulative Quantity was 1.2 μmol/gsample in Castro Dolomite and 3.2 μmol/gsample in Arctic Dolomite. Arctic Dolomite presented a higher interaction with CO, which can be in accordance with its higher surface area (explained in previous section). 3.1.3 NH3-TPD Acidity of the dolomites was measured by NH3 desorption technique, which was considered equivalent to the amount of NH3 desorbed. Results are given in Table 2 . The total acidity was very similar for both dolomites, but differences can be noticed in the acidity distribution. In general, Castro Dolomite had stronger acid sites than Arctic Dolomite. Taking into account their high difference in surface area, similar total acidity may indicate that Castro Dolomite is much more acid than Arctic Dolomite. 3.1.4 XRD Arctic and Castro reduced samples (after the reduction step at 700 °C employed in the bench-scale pilot plant prior to all the experimental tests) presented the same XRD pattern, as can be observed in Fig. 2 . In order to analyze the effect of the reduction step in the dolomites, the Arctic Dolomite was also analyzed fresh. The semi quantitative results of the four main components detected in the fresh sample were: 59 % magnesian calcite ((Mg0.064Ca0.936)CO3), 8 % lime (CaO), 25 % periclase (MgO) and 8 % portlandite (Ca(OH)2). The presence of portlandite was due to the hygroscopic nature of the Ca-based materials [48]. After the reduction step, most of the carbonates observed in the fresh sample were lost, as CO2 most probably, and they were not detected in none of the reduced dolomites. After the reduction procedure, the magnesian calcite was reconverted mainly into CaO and MgO."
9,Characterization of catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of catalysts 3.2.1 ICP-OES The content of nickel, cobalt and palladium in the prepared catalysts is shown in Table 3 . All the measures were repeated three times, with standard deviation lower than 0.5 %. The nickel content was in all the catalysts similar to the desired percentage, except in the NiCO/Al2O3 one. Cobalt and palladium percentages were in all the cases lower than the expected ones (10 wt% for Co and 1 wt% of Pd). 3.2.2 N2 adsorption-desorption A general comparison of the catalysts’ structure is given in Table 3. Alumina-based catalysts presented low BET surface area, as the metal content was high and it is known that high metal content blocks the surface. Olivine supported catalysts had a BET surface area of around 3−5 m2/g, indicating a very low porosity in the range of other similar catalysts reported in the literature [49]. In the Ni/HC catalyst, it was noticeable the high BET surface area and the low BJH pore volume. This could be due to small pores in a narrow diameter range. The complete N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 3 . If comparing these isotherms with the IUPAC nomenclature, it is observed that alumina-based catalysts can be identified as Type IV(a) with hysteresis, representing mesoporous materials with initial sorption of monolayer-multilayer in the surface followed by capillary condensation in the meso pores. In the case of olivine supported catalysts, they presented a very small, or not noticeable, hysteresis; and they can be associated with Type III isotherms, which are reversible isotherms. This isotherm indicates that there is not monolayer formation. The interactions between the adsorbed molecules with the sorbent are weak, and the molecules are grouped together in more favored active sites of the solid surface, which can be considered almost non porous. Ni/HC catalyst showed a small hysteresis with higher increase of adsorbed volume rate at lower relative pressures, which usually indicates sorbent-adsorbate interactions in narrow micropores. Comparing for all the catalysts the rate at low relative pressures, it can be concluded that Ni/HC was the only one presenting this; indicating the presence of narrower pores’ diameter or more small pores. This conclusion is in agreement with the one reached in Table 3. The Ni/HC catalyst showed also a small hysteresis, indicating also some capillary condensation. All the catalysts were mesoporous/macroporous materials, with pore diameters starting at around 30 Å (Fig. S3). In the alumina and olivine supported catalysts, the addition of cobalt decreased the surface area, and the addition of both Co and Pd decreased even more the surface; indicating that the metal deposition blocked pores in the entire range of diameters. As it has been previously indicated, in general, olivine supported catalysts presented lower surface area than the rest, but the pore diameters were similar. Regarding the Ni/HC catalyst, an important difference was observed in the figure; pores in the range of 35−40 Å give most of the surface area, which indicates a very homogeneous porosity structure. 3.2.3 CO chemisorption The “Active Metal Surface Area” (AMSA) and the “Metal Dispersion” (MD) were determined by pulse CO chemisorption, and the results for all the catalysts are shown in Table 4 . The stoichiometry of CO adsorption is very sensitive to a number of experimental parameters and the sample itself [50]. In order to compare the prepared catalysts, stoichiometry number of 1 was employed for CO chemisorption over Ni, Co and Pd. The comparison of the AMSA and MD values for the catalysts with more than one metal are descriptive, because it is difficult to attribute each result to the interaction of each metal. In the case of the monometallic catalysts (41 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 43 wt% Ni/Olivine and 20 wt% Ni/HC), the dispersion of Ni over alumina was much higher than over olivine, even though they had similar Ni weight percentage. Ni/HC catalyst showed the best dispersion, indicating a small Ni size in the catalyst. Comparing the monometallic and the bimetallic catalysts over alumina and olivine, the dispersion seemed to be better in the bimetallic ones. However, looking at the “CO adsorbed Cumulative Quantity” (CQ), it is concluded that the adsorbed CO quantity was almost the same for both. This can be due to a smaller total metal weight in the case of the bimetallic, and may be an indication of a different deposition behavior of Ni and Co. Regarding the trimetallic catalysts, in the case of the alumina-based catalyst the CQ was almost half of the other two alumina catalysts. The trimetallic olivine supported catalyst showed higher CO sorption than the monometallic and bimetallic, but in the three cases the values were very small. 3.2.4 NH3-TPD The total acidity of all the catalysts was measured by NH3 sorption technique at temperatures lower than 890 °C, where total acidity of the samples is considered equivalent to the amount of NH3 desorbed. The acidity distribution and total acidity of the other catalysts is shown in Table 5 , and complete NH3-TPD curve is given in Supplementary Material (Fig. S4). As expected, olivine supported catalysts showed no acidity. The highest total acidity was detected for the Ni/HC catalyst. In the alumina-based catalysts acidity decreased in the samples with Co and Pd compared to the Ni one. This is in accordance with the lower surface detected by N2 adsorption-desorption (see Table 3). A higher acidity is expected to produce better activities, as it is known to break CC and CO binding, but it may also favored higher coke formation during the reforming reactions [8,9]. Regarding the type of acidity, in all the catalysts most of the acidity is medium strength (250 °C – 450 °C). This could be a positive indication, as strong acidic sites could enhance coke deposition and polymerization reactions [51]. 3.2.5 TPR In order to analyze the reduction properties of the tested catalysts, which is usually interpreted as different interactions between metals and supports, TPR analysis were performed with small heating rate, 1 °C/min (the same one employed during the reduction step in the bench-scale pilot plant tests). All the samples had been calcined at 700 °C before the TPR analysis. In Fig. 4 the temperature reduction peaks of the catalysts are shown, indicating the temperature at which the main reduction peaks appear. In the alumina catalysts, a main reduction peak at around 300 °C was observed with a second one at higher temperatures of around 700 °C. In the work by Bazyari et al. [52] they analyzed Ni over γ, δ and θ phases of alumina. In the TPR they performed, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, they observed three reduction peaks: a main one at around 317 °C, a second peak at 514 °C and a third small one at 730 °C. Comparing these results with the ones we obtained, the main difference is the second peak, which they attributed to highly dispersed surface NiO particles interacting strongly with the support. This lack of second peak in our case may be due to lower heating rate in the TPR test (1 Vs 10 °C/min), which may improve the reduction of Ni species. The low metal dispersion detected by CO chemisorption may also have influenced this second peak disappearance. The presence of nickel aluminates were not observed, as there were not reduction peaks at temperatures higher than 800 °C [53]. In the olivine supported catalysts wide reduction temperature range was observed. This broad reduction zone may correspond to the reduction of Fe2O3 and MgFe2O4 [49]. The main reduction peak of Ni species were again observed at temperatures around 320 °C. The trimetallic olivine supported catalyst seemed to be completely reduced at lower temperature than the Ni and NiCo catalysts, which may strength the idea of Pd improving the reducibility of the metals. Again, high temperature reduction peaks were not observed, which compared to literature may be due to the slow heating rate during the H2-TPR measurement [54]. The addition of Co had similar effect on both alumina and olivine supports. Co addition shifted the main reduction peak of alumina support to lower temperature, from 320 °C to 280 °C. Regarding the olivine support a peak at lower temperature appeared (280 °C). This shift may be due to Co promoting the reduction of Ni, plus the fact that the reduction temperature of Co is lower than that of Ni at the same conditions. In the work by Tae Hwan Lim et al. [55] pure nickel oxide presented a reduction peak at 354 °C (Ni2+ to Ni°), whereas pure cobalt oxide presented two reduction peaks attributed to Co3+ to Co2+ reduction at 272 °C and Co2+ to Co° at 382 °C. This may explain why, in our case, the bimetallic NiCo catalysts also tend to show a single main reduction peak and shifted to lower reduction temperatures [56]. Finally, the Ni/HC catalyst showed reduction starting already at around 200 °C, with a main peak at 300 °C. These low reduction temperatures are in accordance with the high Ni dispersion observed by CO-chemisorption and the small crystal particle size identified by XRD. The reduction of the catalyst seems to continue until temperatures as high as 600 °C. Therefore, Ni/HC catalyst presented some Ni particles weakly interacting with the support and others with high interaction that make them more difficult to reduce, which was also observed by Wierzbicki et al. [57]. 3.2.6 XRD A fresh and reduced sample of all the catalysts was analyzed by XRD (see Fig. 5 ). The three most characteristic peaks of metallic nickel (01−087-0712, indicated with *) were clearly detected in all the samples except in the Ni/HC. In this catalyst, the peaks at 2Theta values of 44.7 and 52 were less intense and broader, indicating that the crystals seemed to be smaller. Cobalt and palladium crystallites were not detected by XRD in the samples. Metallic nickel and cobalt have a very similar diffractogram. Therefore, nickel had most probably masked the cobalt signs and it made it hard to distinguish from each other [6]. Palladium was most probably in small amount or small crystals (< 1 nm) as to any diffraction peak be detected. In the olivine supported catalysts, signals of olivine (Mg2SiO4, 01−084-1402) can be observed all along the diffractogram. With Scherrer equation the crystallites’ size can be estimated. Nickel crystal’s size was calculated for all the catalysts with the peak at 2Theta value of 44.7. Alumina-based catalysts had an average crystallite size of 120 nm, the olivine supported catalysts 150 nm and the Ni/HC 10 nm. These values were in accordance with the qualitative results obtained from CO-Chemisorption, where the active metal surface was the highest in Ni/HC and the smallest in the Ni/Olivine. 3.2.7 XPS Reduced catalysts were also analyzed by XPS. This technique allows to examine the surface composition and to identify the chemical nature of the elements present there. All the samples showed elemental carbon in the surface, which was most probably due to pollution from atmospheric contamination during the handling of the sample. This carbon percentage on the surface depended on the material, and olivine supported samples presented higher amount than alumina or HC. A summary of the main results is given in Table 6 . In the catalysts containing cobalt, its presence was observed, but it could not be quantified due to superposition with the LMM Auger line of nickel. In Olivine supported catalysts, Si and Mg were identified on the surface and Al and Mg were detected in Ni/HC, as expected from their composition and preparation method. In Fig. 6 , it is shown the XPS results of the fresh and reduced catalysts for the nickel binding energy range. The main nickel specie detected in all the samples was Ni2+ as nickel oxide (853.8–854.3 eV in the literature) with its corresponding satellite peak (∼860 eV). The binding energy of Ni° is referenced at around 852.7–852.8 eV (Ni 2p 3/2), which is not usually observed in samples exposed to air due to passivation layer. In the three alumina-based catalysts, the atomic ratio Al/O was lower than that in alumina (Al/O = 0.666). The surface of these catalysts had more oxygen than that coming from alumina, indicating a quick superficial reoxidation of Ni during the handling of the samples. Most probably, Ni was oxidized in all the catalysts, but it is not possible to check this comparing the atomic ratios due to the complexity of the olivine and HC supports. The peaks observed at around 870−880 eV are from Ni 2p 1/2 and its corresponding satellite peak. The quick reoxidation of the catalysts made necessary the re-activation step between sorption cycles performed during the SESR tests, and explained in section 2.5."
10,SESR operating conditions optimization,"3.3 SESR operating conditions optimization Before the SESR tests for catalysts performance comparison, several operation parameters were optimized. First of all, the two available dolomites were compared in SESR operating conditions. Previously from the characterization results, mainly in the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, it has been concluded that Arctic Dolomite presented surface characteristics that could foresee a better sorption capacity. This was also corroborate by the SESR tests. The sorption capacity of both dolomites in the same conditions can be observed in Fig. 7 A and B. In all the cases Arctic Dolomite presented higher sorption capacity than Castro Dolomite. Therefore, all the forthcoming SESR tests were performed just with Arctic Dolomite. The second parameter to be optimized was the heating rate employed during the activation step prior to SESR tests (700 °C under H2:N2 atmosphere, further details in section 2.5). In the quick activation procedure (Fig. 7A) a heating rate of 5 °C/min was employed, whereas in the slow activation procedure (Fig. 7B) the heating rate was 1 °C/min. It can be concluded from the figures that a high heating rate seemed to damage or modify the sorbents, obtaining less sorption capacity for both dolomites. As a conclusion, in all the SESR performed to compare the catalysts’ behavior, low heating rate was employed during activation stage. Another two operation parameters were optimized to allow enough time before breakthrough curve with the less amount of sorbent involved. Two different feed space velocities were analyzed (0.8 and 1.6 h−1) and better sorption capacity was observed with the lowest velocity, as observed in Fig. 7C. This indicated that, most probably, the external mass transfer problems have been limited and that the kinetics of carbonation is relatively low, decreasing the sorption rate when increasing space velocity. This lowest space velocity was the one employed during the SESR experimental tests for comparison of the catalysts. In Fig. 7D, the employed sorbent weight effect was analyzed. The sorbent weight to be employed was mainly limited by the available sample and the reactor internal volume. Similar sorption capacities were measured with enough breakthrough time for both 2.5 and 5 g of sorbent; therefore, it was decided to employ 2.5 g in all the SESR tests."
11,Thermodynamic analysis,"3.4 Thermodynamic analysis Employing Aspen Plus software, a thermodynamic analysis was performed with a theoretical RGibbs reactor that uses Gibbs free energy minimization to calculate equilibrium and with NRT method for the calculation of thermodynamic properties. The reforming of the two aqueous organic mixture feeds employed in the SESR experimental tests (acetic acid (AA) and complex mixture (CM)) were simulated at the conditions employed in the experimental bench-scale pilot plant, at 575 °C and 1 atm. The thermodynamic results obtained were compared with the experimental results from NiCoPd/Olivine (see Table 7 ). The experimentally yielded concentrations are divided into two columns, the period where the sorbent was shifting the reaction (SESR) and once the sorbent was saturated and we only had the conventional SR process. In the theoretical results, it was observed that the hydrogen production could be higher when reforming the complex mixture, generating higher concentration of hydrogen (70.96 %). With both aqueous organic mixture feeds, AA and CM, the reforming seemed to be almost complete, because the production of CO was quite low, and there was almost no methane. Comparing the theoretical SR with the experimentally obtained values, it can be easily observed that the complex mixture was more difficult than acetic acid to be reformed, as the difference between theoretical and experimental was higher. Regarding selectivity, CO generation was not detected experimentally, which was a very interesting result; whereas there was more methane than the thermodynamic maximum expected. This can be an indication of good selectivity of the employed catalysts in reforming, and also to the presence of some methanation side reaction (CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O). During the experimental SESR period, before reaching sorbent saturation, the equilibrium shift was easily observed both in hydrogen purity and in the generation of products from secondary reactions. Hydrogen purity reached values around 97 %, which was very promising for being directly employed as a hydrogen current, with no presence of CO (critical compound for being employed in fuel cells, for example). Methane generation was much smaller than in conventional reforming, indicating also the diminution of secondary reactions even in the hardest reforming conditions with CM feed."
12,SESR-SR cycles of acetic acid and complex mixture,"3.5 SESR-SR cycles of acetic acid and complex mixture All the catalysts were tested with acetic acid and complex mixture reforming for three sorption/desorption cycles under the following conditions: 575 °C, 1 atm, slow activation heating rate (1 °C/min), 2.5 g of fresh-calcined Arctic Dolomite and 0.5 g of fresh-calcined catalyst. The employed weight hour space velocity was 0.8 h−1 in the acetic acid tests and 3.8 h−1 in the complex mixture tests. The hydrogen purity obtained is shown in Fig. 8 , from where it is remarkable the high hydrogen purity obtained during the SESR with acetic acid (Fig. 8 A/B); as for example 99.96 % for Ni/HC and NiCo/Al2O3 and 99.93 % for Ni/Al2O3 (more detailed composition values can be found in the Table S1). The breakthrough curves are given in Supplementary Material (Fig. S5). In the pre-breakthrough period hydrogen purity was very close to 100 %, while it quickly decreased to 55–60 % when the sorbent started to be saturated (conventional steam reforming). The sorption capacity of the sorbent, in all these tests, was much higher in the first cycle than in the second and third, which was easily observed with the shorter time at which hydrogen purity was close to 100 %. Regarding the hydrogen purity achieved reforming the complex mixture (see Fig. 8 C/D), during the first SESR period before the breakthrough curve, very high purities were obtained again for all the catalysts. The purities were as high as 99.89 % for Ni/HC, 99.88 % for Ni/Al2O3 and 99.86 % for NiCo/Al2O3 (more detailed compositions are given in Table S1). It is a very interesting result to obtain such a high hydrogen purity even though the mixture is much more complex to reformate than the acetic acid. Once the sorbent was saturated, when conventional steam reforming took place, the hydrogen purity was very similar for all the tested catalysts, and higher than the one obtained in the acetic acid reforming (Fig. 8 A/B). This indicated that the prepared catalysts were very adequate for the reforming of the complex mixture. The addition of Co and Pd did not show a clear improve in the produced hydrogen purity at the tested conditions. Comparing the alumina-based catalysts, they all showed similar activity during the SESR period, but after the sorbent reached saturation the hydrogen purity obtained with the Ni/Al2O3 with acetic acid was lower than that obtained with Co and CoPd addition, and further to the thermodynamic maximum (64.87 %, see Table 7). This difference was almost no noticeable in the olivine supported catalysts. This was an interesting result, taking into account that heterogeneous catalysis is a surface process, and the low BET surface area of the olivine supported catalysts. Concerning the Ni/HC catalyst, the obtained purity was very similar to the other ones. However, is worth mentioning that its nickel content was around half of the other catalysts. It is also important to highlight that all the catalysts seemed to be stable for conventional reforming process, during the tested three cycles, as they all presented almost repetitive results in the SR conditions (after sorbent saturation). Hydrogen selectivity was also calculated for all the experiments taking into account the selectivity for hydrogen atoms to form molecular hydrogen instead of forming other hydrogen containing molecules (Fig. S6 and Fig. S7). During the SESR period of acetic acid and complex mixture reforming, almost all the hydrogen atoms were employed for generating only hydrogen (98–99 % selectivity). This is a good indication of the equilibrium shift to hydrogen production due to CO2 sorption, decreasing the secondary reactions. When the sorbent reached saturation, only CH4 was detected as hydrogen containing other molecule (more detailed composition can be found in Table S1). It is also remarkable that CO was not detected during the experiments, a signal of good selectivity of the catalysts for the main hydrogen production reaction. What is worth mentioning, in the case of complex mixture, is the shorter effect of equilibrium shift detected in all these three cycles, compared to the acetic acid results. During the first cycle, it was possible to see the positive effect of sorption in selectivity, but during second and third cycles the effect was almost negligible. Hydrogen yield has been also calculated and is shown in Supplementary Material (Fig. S8). The yield was calculated considering the moles of produced hydrogen divided by the maximum moles that could have been formed if all the fed compounds were completely reformed. In most of the runs it was observed a higher hydrogen yield during CO2 sorption period, reinforcing the positive effect of sorption for enhancing main reforming reactions. Both with acetic acid and with complex mixture the non-conventional olivine-based catalysts showed hydrogen yield values comparable to those obtained with conventional alumina-based catalysts. In order to perform a deeper analysis of the catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts, TOF number was calculated for all the experiments. As far as the knowledge of the authors is concern, there are few works with TOF values published for the acetic acid SESR, whereas no one is been found for the complex mixture reforming. In Table 8 the TOF numbers obtained during the SESR and SR conditions in the three cycles for each catalyst are shown. In catalysts with more than one metal, the correlation between the turnover frequency (TOF) of one kind of active sites with the amounts of others is a method usually employed for discussing their synergy [58,59]. Analyzing the obtained results, the importance of dispersion in the activity is highlighted, as expected from literature [60]. Under the tested conditions, all the catalysts showed quite repetitive activities along the three cycles regardless the employed aqueous organic mixture feed. The first remarkable issue is the big difference in the order of the TOF value depending on the support. The TOF number takes into account the active surface of the catalyst, giving a closer idea of when the deposited metal is active or available for the reaction. Therefore, two catalysts with similar hydrogen production, with similar metal content, but with a very different dispersion result in very different TOF values. This is what happens with the catalysts supported on alumina and olivine. The metallic content is similar, but the low dispersion measured in the olivine supported catalyst means that, producing a similar amount of reaction, the available active centers (which are much less in number than those in alumina) have to be much more active. It is interesting to observe that the TOF values of olivine supported catalysts are much higher than the TOFs of other Ni-, Rh- and Ru-based catalysts reported at 550 °C which are lower than 2 s−1 [61,62] or reach almost10 s−1 [40]. Comparing acetic acid and complex mixture results, similar trend is observed between them. In the alumina-based catalysts by replacing half of Ni with Co (Ni/Al2O3 Vs NiCo/Al2O3, which have the same total amount of metal) the TOF number is quite similar. It could be that not all the Ni is employed in the reaction and therefore less amount would be enough; or that the effect of Co in the reforming is similar to that of Ni, or enhances Ni sites activity. When adding Pd an improvement in activity is observed. This must be due to the effect of Pd, promoting the reaction, since in quantity it is a very low percentage (0.85 wt% of the catalyst, which is equivalent to 1.2 mol% of the total metal content). The strong interaction of Pd in the alumina catalysts observed by TPR appears also contributing to the improvement of the TOFs for the reforming reactions. The addition of Co to Ni in the olivine supported catalysts (again the same total amount of metal with half of the Ni replaced by Co), does not seem to improve the activity of this catalyst. It is important to bear in mind that olivine is a very complex support, and this could explain the differences observed between the effect of the addition of Co to olivine and alumina. Adding Pd, the activity further decreased for the olivine supported catalyst. The Ni/HC catalyst had the lowest TOF values, due to its high dispersion. With similar hydrogen production, as it is a catalyst with a high dispersion of nickel, many active centers are available. Therefore, under the tested conditions, the catalytic activity of each center was lower. In Table 9 the sorption capacity of the Arctic Dolomite during the activity tests is shown. The adsorbed CO2 was calculated from the breakthrough measurements in the fix bed reactor under reaction conditions. The capacity was not strongly affected by the small variations of gas composition and CO2 production that could derive from the performance variations of each catalyst. In all the cases, the sorption capacity showed a high decrease from cycle 1–2. The reasons for this deactivation may be a combination of facts: I) the sorption process was not totally reversible, II) the pore blocking due to thermal sintering [48], III) the desorption step was slower than expected and the complete desorption of CO2 was not achieved between cycles, and IV) the pore blocking that may have occurred due to coke formed on the catalyst and deposited over the sorbent. In the work by Omoniyi & Dupont they analyzed the effect of 20 cycles on SESR of acetic acid, and they also observed a quicker efficiency decrease during the first cycles [63]. This decrease was more remarkable when operating with complex mixture. This may be due to more coke generation, which was not completely removed during the oxidation step between SESR cycles. The sorption capacity was kept much more constant for the forthcoming two cycles, but in values lower than those previously reported for similar sorbents. The small sorption capacities of the second and third cycles were the reason for so short SESR periods observed during the tests and discussed before in the catalytic activity analysis."
13,SR stability tests,"3.6 SR stability tests Some of the tested catalysts were kept under steam reforming conditions for longer time, in order to have some information about their stability (see Fig. 9 ). Reforming of acetic acid was maintained for three catalysts: Ni/Al2O3, Ni/Olivine and NiCo/Olivine and the mixture reforming conditions for the NiCo/Olivine catalyst. During the tested time they all remained very stable, with stable TOF values, indicating that they were not deactivated. The best hydrogen yield was obtained for the NiCo/Olivine catalyst and it was very similar for both aqueous organic mixture feeds, 70–80 % for acetic acid and 70 % for complex mixture. The good stability of this catalyst can be related with its low acidity, avoiding coke deposition and therefore deactivation."
14,Conclusions,"It was possible to obtain hydrogen purities of 99.89 % even with the complex mixture feed and the novel and cheaper olivine support, due to the CO2 sorption. The activity results strength the importance of some physicochemical characteristics in activity of the catalysts for reforming processes. Metal content and dispersion were both very important for comparing the activity, TOF value. During the characterization performed to the catalysts employing different techniques, it was observed that Ni/HC catalyst presented much higher surface area with small pore diameter range, and smaller metal particle size than the rest of the catalysts. Significant catalytic differences were not detected by the addition of Co or Pd to the Ni-based catalysts. Ni/HC catalyst showed comparable catalytic behavior, despite the fact that it contained half of the metal quantity than the others. In the steam reforming stability tests it was observed the good performance of olivine support during the tested period of time, which was very interesting result as it is a natural and much cheaper material than alumina. In general, olivine supported catalysts showed very high activities with TOF values as high as 74 s−1 with acetic acid and 65 s−1 with complex mixture. Therefore, they seem to be promising catalysts that should be further study in order to find the optimum metal ratio and the harder operating conditions they can work with. Between the two tested dolomites, the Arctic Dolomite showed much better sorption properties than the Castro one. Both presented similar behavior during the reduction step in the bench-scale pilot plan and they were both mesoporous materials, but the Arctic Dolomite had much higher pore volume. The sorption capacity of the sorbent strongly decreased after the first cycle, which is something that needs to be further improve."
