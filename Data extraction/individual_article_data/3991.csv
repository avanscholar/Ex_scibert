0,Introduction,"As a solution for the present energy and environmental problems caused by the depleting of fossil fuels, hydrogen has attracted enormous interest due to the characteristics of unlimited supply, high energy efficiency and zero-emission of greenhouse gases [1]. However, safe, cost-effective and practical means of hydrogen storage for transportation applications is still a huge hurdle [2]. Porous carbon materials attracted extensive attention as a candidate for hydrogen storage due to their light weight, fast kinetics, complete reversibility, low cost, and high surface area [3,4]. In general, high surface area and micropore volume are essential for enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity of porous carbon materials [5]. Hence, tailoring pore structures of porous carbon materials for hydrogen storage is an urgent matter. Ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) has exhibited promising results for hydrogen storage (e.g. up to 0.8wt.% at 25°C and 2MPa) at near-ambient temperatures and pressures. Bhat et al. [6,7] UMC is an activated carbon produced by MeadWestvaco (Charleston, SC) through two sequential stages of activation of wood, with H3PO4 and KOH, respectively [8,9]. The heat of adsorption related to the hydrogen uptake process (17–20kJ/mol) is also higher than usually reported for carbon materials. The superior hydrogen uptake behavior was tentatively attributed to contributions from polarization-enhanced physisorption of hydrogen by alkali metals residual from chemical activation [6]. However, how the alkali metals affect the microstructure, pore development, and dispersion of metal particles in activated carbon materials is still not clear. In the present work, we report on the surface area and micropore development in potassium (K)-doped activated carbon obtained from carbonization of polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) followed by physical activation. A controlled set of experiments have been conducted to monitor the structural changes of K-doped PFA-derived carbon (K-PFAC) during activation at different levels of burn-off. The hydrogen uptake measurements were also conducted to prove the enhanced hydrogen adsorption capacity of K-PFAC, which may help to clarify the hydrogen adsorption mechanism and increase our ability to design suitable carbon-based hydrogen storage materials and devices."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis PFA was chosen as the carbon precursor. First, 0.1M p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 10mL tetrahydrofuran (spectroscopic grade Sigma–Aldrich) and the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath. After cooling, this solution was slowly added to 20mL of furfuryl alcohol (99% Sigma–Aldrich) at a rate of 10mL/h, and kept in the ice bath. Upon melting of the ice, the polymerization reaction was allowed to proceed for 48h at 25°C. K-doped and K-free PFA were prepared. For the case of K-doped PFA, potassium carbonate powder (about 35mg) was added to the polymer during polymerization."
3,Carbonization and activation,"2.2 Carbonization and activation After polymerization, the samples with and without K were carbonized and activated. Each one of the resultant polymers was placed in a quartz tube furnace and heated to the carbonization temperature of 900°C with a heating rate of 5°C /min under flowing nitrogen, followed by a heat-soak time of 5h. The K-doped PFAC contains about 0.2wt.% of potassium after carbonization. After the carbonization process, the carbonized samples were ground, placed into the quartz tube; then heated to 875°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min under nitrogen. When the furnace reached the desired temperature, a CO2 gas stream (2L/min) was introduced into the tube furnace. Exposure time was varied to achieve activation levels corresponding to the desired burn-off degrees. Samples with and without K were labeled K-PFAC-X and PFAC-X, respectively, where X denoted the percent burn-off."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization To understand transformations occurring during the thermal treatments, carbonization and activation processes of K-doped PFAC and K-free PFAC were simulated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using thermal analyzer (Q5000) from TA Instruments. Surface area and pore structure were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption at 77K and by CO2 at 273K using an automatic adsorption system (Autosorb 1 from Quantachrome Instruments). The BET surface area was calculated from N2 adsorption data at relative pressures 0.05<P/P0 <0.3. The volume of narrow micropores was calculated by applying the DR equation to CO2 adsorption data. Detailed pore size distributions were calculated by applying non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) equilibrium model to adsorption of N2 (at 77K) and CO2 (at 273K) in slit-shaped carbon pores (using the Autosorb software version 1.5.1 from Quantachrome Instruments) [10,11]. Adsorption of CO2 at 273K and subatmospheric pressure complements data of pore size distributions reduced from N2 adsorption data at 77K [10–12]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEM-2010 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Before evaluation, the samples were dispersed in ethanol with sonication and then transferred to the grids for TEM examination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Philips X’Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å). The power supply was set at a current of 40mA and a voltage of 45kV. The X-ray unit was run in a continue scan mode for all measurements. Raman scattering spectra of the PFAC and K-PFAC were also obtained at room temperature by using a triple monochromator (ISA J-Y Model T64000) with an excitation wavelength of 514nm (Ar+ ion laser). The microscope was used for focusing the laser beam onto the surface of the samples. Hydrogen adsorption measurements (up to 2MPa) were made by the gravimetric method using an IGA-01 microbalance from Hiden Analytical Inc. Prior to measurements, PFAC and K-PFAC samples (∼100mg), were outgassed in situ at 300°C for at least 8h. Measurements were made at three temperatures (25, 40 and 60°C), and the sample was outgassed each time before changing temperature. The sample temperature was maintained constant (±0.05°C) during measurements by using a circulating water bath. Buoyancy corrections were made using the density of the PFAC material estimated from helium displacement. The IGA software uses real-time analysis of adsorption data coupled with a mass transfer model, and estimates the asymptotic sample weight at equilibrium. In the work reported here, an oil-free vacuum system with a turbomolecular pump was used. Research-grade hydrogen gas (99.9999%, Matheson) was used, which passed through a trap maintained at 77K for retention of any traces of condensable impurities in the gas."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a shows the weight loss and the derivative weight loss versus temperature curves during the thermal treatment of K-doped PFA under N2 atmosphere. The sample was heated to 900°C at a constant heating rate (5°C/min) and the N2 was fed with a constant flow rate of 3L/min. A major weight loss corresponding to evaporation of water was observed at 100°C. In the region of 300–400°C, the by-products were primarily H2O and CO [13,14]. A second major weight loss occurred between 400 and 600°C. The production of CO increased, while H2O was slightly suppressed. Generation of CH4 and CO2 was initiated in this region [13,14]. Stable weight was achieved in N2 at about 800°C, indicating the carbonization process was complete. To investigate the activation process of K-doped PFAC powder, the thermal treatments were also conducted in CO2 atmosphere at different temperatures, but otherwise in identical conditions. Fig. 1b shows the weight variation of K-doped PFAC powder in CO2 as function of time at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively. For all three thermal treatments, the weight of K-doped PFAC gradually reduces with time, which is caused by the reaction of carbon gasification with carbon dioxide (C+CO2 =2CO) [15]. This activation process creates internal porosity and develops the internal surface area. The Arrhenius plot is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b, from which the activation energy of K-doped PFAC (178.4kJ/mol) was calculated. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms for activated K-free PFAC and K-doped and at various levels of activation (expressed as percent burn-off) are shown in Fig. 2 a and b. All isotherms are Type I, practically without hysteresis, indicating a dominant microporous character [16]. A summary of the results from the analyses of these isotherms is presented in Table 1 . The data shows that the specific surface area of the K-doped PFAC increased gradually from 940m2 g−1 for 30% burn-off to 1446m2 g−1 for 40 % burn-off to 2096m2 g−1 for 60 % burn-off along with the increase of the activation level. N2 adsorption at 77K and CO2 adsorption at 273K were combined to investigate the pore size distribution of PFAC and K-PFAC samples. Fig. 2c–f shows the differential and cumulative pore size distributions calculated from N2 and CO2 adsorption data by the NLDFT method [17,18]. Adsorption of CO2 at 273K and subatmospheric pressure complements data of pore size distributions deduced from N2 adsorption data at 77K. In this study, adsorption of CO2 provides the reliable information for narrowest micropores (up to 10Å). The software available from Quantachrome Instruments is based on the NLDFT calculation models developed by Neimark and co-workers [11,19]. Generally speaking, the CO2 activation involves not only the reaction between the carbon and CO2, resulting in the removal of carbon atoms, but it also plays an important role in enhancing the microporosity, leading to a higher specific surface area [20]. However, the change of the micropore volume is not consistent with that of the specific surface area, as shown in Table 1. The micropore volume of K-PFAC-60 is a little lower than that of K-PFAC-40, indicating that longer activation time had a somewhat negative effect on creating the micropores. K-PFAC has larger surface area than PFAC with close burn-off degrees, which is presumably explained as the contributions from doped K (0.2wt.%). Comparing the micropore volumes calculated with the two adsorbates provides additional information on the structure of microporosity. At low activation levels, VDR-N2 , and VDR-CO2 indicates uniform porosity, mostly in narrow micropores. As the activation level increases, the difference between VDR-N2 and VDR-CO2 increases, indicating widening of microporosity and development of supermicropores (7–20Å). However, the difference between Vtotal and VDR-N2 does not increase substantially, showing absence of mesoporosity for most of the samples. The variation of BET surface area as a function of activation level is plotted in Fig. 3 . The calculated surface area values of the activated carbon materials increase almost linearly with the burn-off degree. K-PFAC-40 has similar surface area with PFAC-50. It is clear that the development of surface area during activation of K-doped PFAC is faster than in K-free PFAC at equal levels of burn-off. This is a first indication that the presence of K does significantly affect the porosity development in activated carbon. The activation at high burn-off degree levels, although effective in development of large BET surface areas, contributes very little to the increase of pore volumes in the range of narrow micropores. It should be mentioned that K-doped PFAC also shows larger micropore volume than K-free PFAC (Table. 1). With similar surface area, the value of VDR-CO2 for PFAC-50 is 0.14cm3 g−1, whereas K-PFAC-40 has more than twice the value of VDR-CO2, namely 0.35cm3 g−1. To investigate the structural changes induced by K doping and the various activation levels, the samples of K-doped PFAC and pure PFAC were characterized by XRD technique. Collected XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4 . The diffraction peaks (002), (100) and (101) were identified. It should be mentioned that no feature related to potassium was observed, which is probably due to the small amount of potassium in the PFAC, and it may also indicates that the potassium is well dispersed in the carbon structure. The full width at half maximum of the (002) peak increases with the degree of burn-off for both K-PFAC and PFAC samples, indicating a progressive reduction of the crystallite size as the degree of burn-off increases. Raman scattering spectra of PFAC and K-doped PFAC with different activation levels were also obtained at room temperature and are shown in Fig. 5 a. We could observe that there are two main Raman modes at ∼1352cm−1 and at ∼1582cm−1. The peak situated at 1352cm−1 is so-called disorder or D peak which occurs in graphitic materials with small crystallite sizes and associated with defects and impurities in the carbon materials [21,22]. The peak at 1582cm−1 (G peak) corresponds to the G line associated with the optically allowed E2g-zone center of graphite [23]. The D peaks can be observed in all obtained Raman spectra, which means disordered structures exist in all the samples with different activation levels. Fig. 5b shows the G position and the intensity ratio of D to G peak (ID/IG) versus the activation levels. The G peaks of PFAC and K-PFAC gradually shift toward to smaller frequency with the increase of activation level. It could probably be explained by preferential oxidation of carbon in disordered structures, which has higher reactivity for oxidation with CO2. It is noted that the ID/IG value of PFAC is larger than that of K-PFAC with a close burn-off degree, indicating K-PFAC has less disordered structures. And the ratio of ID/IG for both PFAC and K-PFAC decreased with the burn-off degree, which might be attributed to the fact that the disordered structures of the external surface of PFAC and K-PFAC decomposed at a higher burn-off degree. Fig. 6 shows the effect of temperature on hydrogen isotherms of PFAC-50 and K-PFAC-40. We measured two adsorption/desorption cycles at each temperature without outgassing between cycles. Similar results were obtained for both cycles, with only a very small amount of irreversible hydrogen retained after the first cycle. For clarity, Fig.6 only shows the first cycles. Hydrogen adsorption on PFAC-50 reaches 0.98mmol/g (about 0.2wt.%) at 25°C and 2MPa, which is quite close to the values of activated carbon with high microporosity (for example, A20, AX2, and superactivated carbon reported in the literature) [5,24]. The different hydrogen adsorption behaviors at identical conditions can probably be explained by the internal distribution of porosity and surface area of carbons. As expected for exothermic adsorption, the amount of H2 adsorbed decreases with increasing temperature. The hydrogen adsorption capacity of PFAC-50 decreases gradually from 0.97mmol/g at 25°C, 0.71mmol/g at 40°C to 0.60mmol/g at 60°C. However, the uptake on K-PFAC-40 is higher than that of PFAC-50 at equal temperatures, 1.47mmol/g at 25°C, 1.14mmol/g at 40°C and 0.79mmol/g at 60°C. The enhanced hydrogen adsorption capacity of K-PFAC is caused by a combination of pore structure and metal doping effects. According to calculations by Cabria et al. [25] and Pellenq et al. [26], low levels of alkali metals, Li and K in particular, induce strong physisorption of hydrogen. The mechanism involves charge transfer and local polarization in the carbon structure, followed by attractive electrostatic interactions with H2 molecules. Theory models predict that H2 may experience polarization- induced physisorption, triggered by electronic charge transfer from isolated alkali metal atoms to graphene units [25,26]. Because of charge delocalization in graphenes, the area of increased negative charge density around an alkali ion center may extend over several neighboring carbon rings, causing attractive interactions with polarized hydrogen molecules [25,26]. Gravimetric results showed a strong temperature dependence of adsorption at higher pressures, which was used to characterize the energetics of the adsorption process. Fig. 7 shows experimental isosteres corresponding to adsorbate densities between 0.125mmol/g and 0.5mmol/g, and over the temperature range from 25°C to 60°C. The values calculated for the isosteric heat of adsorption (PFAC-50) varied from 16.1kJ/mol (at 0.125mmol/g) down to 14.1kJ/mol (at 0.5mmol/g), whereas the values of K-PFAC-40 varied from 21.7kJ/mol (at 0.125mmol/g) down to 15.3kJ/mol (at 0.5mmol/g). This results show that adding a 0.2wt.% potassium to PFAC increased the isosteric heat of adsorption by 35% at low coverage (0.125mmol/g) and by 8% at higher coverage (0.5mmol/g). The measured heat of adsorption of our samples is about two times larger than the reported values for hydrogen on carbon (4–8kJ/mol) [1]. The difference is caused by the nonequivalence of adsorption sites in activated carbons. Most of reported heats of adsorption were measured at very low temperature (77K) where most of adsorption sites (weak and strong) were occupied by hydrogen, leading to a relatively low average heat of adsorption. In contrast, our measurements were conducted at room temperature or near room temperatures. At these conditions, only the strongest binding sites participate in hydrogen adsorption and the measured heat of adsorption corresponds to low coverage. The measured heat of adsorption for K-free PFAC is in the range of recent theoretical predictions by Peng and Morris [27] for hydrogen adsorption in amorphous carbon (14–18kJ/mol). The value measured for K-PFAC exceeds the first-principles value calculated by Pellenq et al. for a model system of K-doped graphene bilayer (11kJ/mol) [26]. Both heat of adsorption values measured near room temperature are in the range considered optimal, based on thermodynamic considerations, for hydrogen storage on porous adsorbents (15–40kJ/mol) [28]. Meeting the DOE target of 5.5wt.% for practical realization of adsorptive hydrogen storage requires increasing the total hydrogen uptake. The limitation may not be the weak adsorption of hydrogen on carbon and other porous adsorbents known today, but the small volume of narrow micropores available for adsorption (or the small number of surface sites with adsorption energy in the appropriate range)."
6,Summary,"We have demonstrated that a small amount of potassium (0.2wt.%) can effectively increase the surface area, develop micropores and enhance the hydrogen uptake at near room temperature of activated carbon derived from polyfurfuryl alcohol. The specific surface area of the K-doped PFAC increased gradually along with the increase of the activation level. K-PFAC-40 developed similar surface area to PFAC-50; however, K-PFAC-40 exhibited larger volume of narrow micropores (0.35cm3 g−1) than PFAC-50. At equal temperatures, the hydrogen adsorption capacity of K-PFAC-40 is much higher than that of PFAC-50. The heat of adsorption on K-PFAC-40 measured between 25 and 60°C is significantly higher (21.7kJ/mol) than that on PFAC-50 (16.1kJ/mol), and both are in the range considered optimal for efficient storage of hydrogen on engineered solid adsorbents."
