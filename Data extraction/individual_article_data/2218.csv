0,Introduction,"Lately the international community has shown an increasing interest in renewable energy sources. Microorganisms have the potential of converting biomass (including wastes/wastewater) to valuable liquid or gaseous substances that can be used as energy sources and especially as fuels. In March 2003 a new EU Directive has been imposed defining the extended use of biofuels in the transportation sector during the coming years [1]. Production of biofuels will help to cope with the overproduction of agricultural products and will further work for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Ethanol and methane produced through anaerobic processes are among the best-known microbial products and so far extended research has been conducted on their generation. Furthermore, during the last decade, much attention has been paid to the hydrogen gas and its potential use as a fuel for transportation purposes (automobiles) and electricity generation. Hydrogen is a clean energy source, possessing a high-energy yield ( 122 kJ g - 1 ) , and does not contribute to the green house effect [2,3]. Long-term, high-risk research in renewable production, efficient and safe storage and use of hydrogen must be made in order to have hydrogen technology spread out [4]. One of the main drawbacks of hydrogen use, i.e. the difficulty of securing a safe storage, has been overcome by the intense research on metal hydrides, which reversibly adsorb hydrogen at room temperature and low pressures [5,6]. Moreover, extensive research on the use of hydrogen gas in electrochemical power generation devices (fuel cells) is nowadays in progress with very promising developments [5]. Hydrogen can be generated in a number of ways, i.e. through fossil fuels processing or by electrolysis using solar power or by thermic conversion of biomass (gasification). However, these processes are highly energy intensive and therefore expensive and not always environmentally benign, i.e. the fossil fuels processing [7,8]. The biological production of hydrogen is more attractive (and even more attractive if wastes/wastewater could be used as the raw material) since it is carried out at ambient temperatures and pressures and hence is less energy-intensive than chemical or electrochemical processes [8]. Biological fermentative production of hydrogen compared to the biophotolytic/photosynthetic processes has the additional advantages that (a) continuous hydrogen production without light is possible, (b) a variety of carbon sources can be used as substrates including wastes/wastewater, (c) valuable metabolites, i.e. butyric, lactic and acetic acids are produced and (d) there is no oxygen limitation problem since it is an anaerobic process [8]. Clostridia are the most promising fermentative bacteria since they are characterised by a rapid metabolism with a high hydrogen yield [6]. The research concerning production of hydrogen through microbial processes was boosted in Japan in the early 1990s. So far it is well founded that the main source of hydrogen in fermentation processes are the carbohydrates and therefore, wastes/wastewater rich in carbohydrates can be considered as potential sources of hydrogen. Furthermore, many studies exist on hydrogen production by pure cultures and from specific, sugar-based substrates as reviewed by Nandi and Sengupta [9]. So far, critical factors for the optimal production of hydrogen through fermentative processes have been reported to be stirring, pH, nutrients and organic carbon concentration, hydrogen partial pressure and the absence or deliberate inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens [6,10,11]. The production of hydrogen increases with increasing carbohydrates concentration, but there is an upper threshold where the bacterial metabolism shifts to the production of alcohols and where the production of hydrogen is decreased [10,12]. Also, a low hydrogen partial pressure is required in order to achieve a good hydrogen yield [7,13], whereas the absence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is a prerequisite for achieving maximum hydrogen production. The continuous stirring of the anaerobic culture and the removal of the hydrogen by supplying another gas, e.g. nitrogen, help to keep a low hydrogen partial pressure and thus results in enhanced hydrogen production rate and yield [7]. Most studies on biological fermentative hydrogen production from sugars using mixed cultures have been conducted in conventional CSTR under mesophilic conditions [14–17]. Recently, hydrogen production in anaerobic systems with self-granulated hydrogenogenic biomass [18–20] and with attached microbial growth on support material [21–25] received attention as well. Palazzi et al. [21] investigated the hydrogen production from starch hydrolysate using a pure culture of Enterobacter aerogenes grown on a mixture of spongy and glass beads in a packed column reactor. Kumar and Das [22] used immobilised microbial cells of Enterobacter cloacae on lignocellulosic material for continuous hydrogen production from soluble starch. Wu et al. [23] used different immobilisation methods and support materials to produce biohydrogen from sewage sludge. Chang et al. [24] and Lee et al. [25] studied the biohydrogen production in mesophilic fixed-bed bioreactors using different support matrices and operating conditions. However, direct comparison of attached growth systems with conventional suspended growth systems for hydrogen production is not yet available in the literature. In general, attached growth systems, although not suitable for high solids concentration in the influent, allow for better retention of active microbial mass, lower hydraulic retention times, higher substrate conversion efficiency and in many cases suffer from lower product inhibition than the suspended growth systems [26]. Furthermore, there is a lack of direct comparison of the thermophilic with mesophilic hydrogen production. In the studies of Youn and Shin [27] and Shin et al. [28] the biohydrogen production from food waste was investigated in mesophilic and thermophilic temperature range. However, methane was detected in significant amounts during the mesophilic process in both studies and the higher hydrogen production in the thermophilic process was attributed to the methane-free conditions. Thermophilic processes are usually characterized by accelerated biochemical reactions and higher growth rate of microorganisms in combination with less variety in fermentation by-products [13,29]. Yu et al. [30] reported that a temperature increase from 20°C to 55°C favoured both hydrogen yield and specific hydrogen production rate with rice winery wastewater as substrate converted in an upflow anaerobic reactor. The present study examines the biological production of hydrogen from glucose in a continuous stirred tank type bioreactor (CSTR) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor (UASB) at various hydraulic retention times using the same microbial inoculum and growth medium. Two different liquid upward velocities (adjusted by the recycling rate) were tested as well in the UASB reactor. The liquid upward velocity ( V up ) influences the biofilm depth on the granules, which are the biofilm substratum in this study, as well as the mass transfer rate (dependent on the thickness of stagnant liquid layer on the biofilm surface and the value of mass transfer coefficient) between the bulk liquid and the biofilm phase [26]. The above properties may influence the distribution of metabolic products and subsequently the hydrogen yield. The V up tests made in this study focussed only on the qualitative estimation of the V up effect on the process efficiency regarding hydrogen production. Also the biohydrogen production from glucose at mesophilic and thermophilic temperature range was studied and compared in the CSTR."
1,Experimental section,
2,Analytical methods,"2.1 Analytical methods Determinations of dissolved (after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10min and filtration of the supernatant liquid) chemical oxygen demand (COD), total (TSS) and volatile (VSS) suspended solids were carried out according to Standard Methods [31]. For the quantification of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ethanol (EtOH), 1ml of sample acidified with 30 μ l of 17% H 3 PO 4 and 20% H 2 SO 4 , respectively were analysed on a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II) with a flame ionisation detector and a capillary column (Hewlett Packard FFAP 30m, inner diameter 0.53mm, film 1 μ m ). The oven was programmed from 115 ∘ C (hold for 3min) to 125 ∘ C at a rate of 5 ∘ C / min and subsequently to 230 ∘ C (hold for 2min) at a rate of 45 ∘ C / min for VFA analysis and from 60 ∘ C (hold for 1min) to 230 ∘ C (hold for 1min) at a rate of 45 ∘ C / min for ethanol analysis. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at 18ml/min and the injector and detector temperature was set at 175 ∘ C and 200 ∘ C , respectively for both VFA and ethanol determinations. Produced gas composition in hydrogen was quantified with a gas chromatograph (Microlab GC 82-22) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column (Porapak Q, 6ftx3mm, 80/100-mesh) with nitrogen as carrier gas (2bar pressure). Injector, column and detector temperatures were set at 70 ∘ C . Two enzymatic reagent kits were used for D-glucose and D- and L-lactic acid determination (Boehringer Mannheim, cat. No 0986119 for D-glucose and 1112821 for D- and L-lactate)."
3,Synthetic medium,"2.2 Synthetic medium The D-glucose based synthetic medium was prepared from the following stock solutions (chemicals in g l - 1 of distilled water): (A) NH 4 Cl , 100; NaCl, 10; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 10; CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 5; (B) K 2 HPO 4 · 3 H 2 O , 200; (C) resazurin, 0.5; (D) trace metals and selenite solution: FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O , 2; H 3 BO 3 , 0.05; ZnCl 2 , 0.05; CuCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 0.038; MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O , 0.05; ( NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 · 4 H 2 O , 0.05; AlCl 3 , 0.05; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.05; NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.092; ethylene-di-amine-tetra-acetate, 0.5; Na 2 SeO 3 · 5 H 2 O , 0.1; HCl 37% 1ml ( E ) a 10 times concentrated vitamin solution described in Wolin et al. [32]; ( F ) D-glucose, 100. The following volumes of stock solutions were added to 884ml of distilled water: A, 10ml; B, 2ml; C, 1ml; D, 1ml; E, 1ml; F, 100 ml. 2.6g of NaHCO 3 were added as buffer. The medium was gassed with a mixture of N 2 and CO 2 (80/20), dispensed and autoclaved. After autoclaving, the medium was reduced with Na 2 S · 9 H 2 O at a final concentration of 0.25 g l - 1 . Final concentration of D-glucose was approximately 10 g l - 1 ."
4,Experiments with the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at 35 ∘ C and 55 ∘ C,"2.3 Experiments with the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at 35 ∘ C and 55 ∘ C A 500ml active volume CSTR fed with synthetic medium was started up using 500ml of anaerobic sludge from Lundofte wastewater treatment plant, Lyngby. The anaerobic sludge was thermally pre-treated (15min at 100 ∘ C ) in order to inhibit the hydrogen consumers and to harvest the spore-forming microorganisms [3]. The CSTR was allowed to reach steady state at 12, 8, 6, 4 and 2h hydraulic retention time (HRT) under mesophilic conditions ( 35 ∘ C ) . For comparison purposes CSTR experiments also took place in parallel under thermophilic conditions ( 55 ∘ C ) at 12, 6 and 2h HRT using the same original inoculum (thermally pre-treated anaerobic sludge) as described above. pH was not controlled neither in mesophilic nor in thermophilic CSTR. The reactor performance (biogas production and composition in H 2 , pH and VFA concentration) was monitored daily throughout the experimental period. Complete characterisation of the reactor performance took place at each steady state. Steady state means stable effluent characteristics and gas flow rate and composition in hydrogen and usually it was reached after an operation for a time period corresponding to 6–10 HRTs. The steady state was further maintained for a period of 4–6 HRTs in order to determine the mean values and standard deviations of the biogas production and composition in H 2 , pH and TSS, VSS, VFA, EtOH, D- and L-lactic acid, COD and D-glucose concentrations. Gas samples were analysed for methane daily in order to monitor whether methane production took place. Measured versus calculated COD concentrations for each steady state are also presented in this study and COD calculations were done as following: the products (COD-products) and the glucose (COD-glucose) COD concentration was calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. COD-others is the remaining COD after subtracting the sum of the COD-products and COD-glucose from the COD-measured (Eq. (3)). In fact, the COD-others corresponds to the non-identified metabolic products during glucose fermentation. COD-products= (1) a mmole acet . l · 64 mg COD mmole acet . + b mmole but . l · 160 mg COD mmole but . + c mmole prop . l · 112 mg COD mmole prop . + ( d + e ) mmole lact . l · 96 mg COD mmole lact . + f mmole eth . l · 96 mg COD mmole eth . , where a , b , c , d , e and f are the measured concentrations of the acetic, butyric, propionic, D-, L-lactic acid and ethanol, respectively. (2) COD - glucose = g mg glu . l · 192 mg COD 180 mg where g is the measured concentration of the D-glucose. (3) COD - others = COD - measured - ( COD - products + COD - glucose ) ."
5,Experiments with the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 35 ∘ C,"2.4 Experiments with the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 35 ∘ C Experiments were performed in a 210ml active volume reactor fed with the glucose based synthetic medium. The reactor was started up using 88 ml sterilised (three successive times for 30min at 140 ∘ C ) anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale UASB treating pulp industry wastewater. The sterilised granular sludge was inoculated with 60ml of anaerobic mixed liquor from the CSTR. Experiments were performed at 12h HRT and 450 and 600 cm h - 1 liquid upward velocities ( V up ) , at 6h HRT and 450 and 600 cm h - 1 V up and at 2h HRT and 450 cm h - 1 V up and pH was not controlled during the experiments. The liquid upward velocity in the UASB was adjusted by recycling of the effluent. The monitoring of the reactor performance was done as described for the CSTR. Characterisation of each steady state included biogas production and composition in H 2 , pH, VFA, EtOH, D- and L-lactic acid, COD and D-glucose concentration. Measured versus calculated COD concentrations for each steady state are also presented in the sequel and COD calculations were done as described for the CSTR. Finally, gas samples were analysed for methane daily in order to monitor whether methane production took place."

7,Experiments with the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at 35 ∘ C and 55 ∘ C,"3.1 Experiments with the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at 35 ∘ C and 55 ∘ C During the experimental period no methane was detected neither in mesophilic nor in thermophilic process. The yield of hydrogen production under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions is presented in Fig. 1 while Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen production rate at each steady state. In general the yield of hydrogen production per unit of glucose consumed decreased with the HRT whereas the hydrogen production rate increased when the HRT decreased. Thermophilic CSTR exhibited a slightly higher hydrogen yield per unit of glucose consumed. The hydrogen production rate was comparable for both temperature ranges. On the other hand, the specific hydrogen production rate presented in Fig. 3 was 5–10 times higher at the thermophilic CSTR compared to the mesophilic CSTR. This was due to the much lower generation of biomass under thermophilic conditions (VSS content in Tables 1 and 2 corresponds to the microorganisms concentration). The lower biomass production under thermophilic compared to mesophilic conditions observed in this study is in accordance with the literature. In general, the biomass yield of thermophilic bacteria is lower and this can be attributed to higher maintenance energy demands at higher temperatures [33]. The characteristics of the mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR at each steady state, including the concentration of metabolic products measured are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The efficiency of both systems for glucose consumption diminished with the decrease of the HRT and was only 23% at 2h HRT. This implies that an HRT of 2h was very close to both mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR washing-out point. The concentration of hydrogen in the gas phase was slightly higher under thermophilic conditions and again diminished with the decrease of the HRT in both systems, from 46% at 12h HRT to 37% at 2h HRT and from 44% at 12h HRT to 34% at 2h HRT in the thermophilic and mesophilic system, respectively. Based on the above observations and on the hydrogen yield and production rate the optimal operating HRT seems to be between 4–6h and 2-6h for the mesophilic and thermophilic system, respectively. In any case it should be higher than 2h. However, given that the efficiency of the substrate (glucose) consumption diminishes with the HRT an economic with technical aspects assessment is necessary in order to decide for the optimal HRT of a full-scale plant. The hydrogen productivity of the mesophilic CSTR in terms of hydrogen percentage in the gas phase and mmol H 2 /h/l/g VSS is comparable with that of other mesophilic hydrogenogenic mixed cultures fed with glucose medium in continuous suspended growth systems [7,17]. The dominant metabolic products under mesophilic conditions were butyric and acetic acid (Table 1) with the production of butyric acid being double that of acetic acid at higher retention times. Considerable amounts of D- and L- lactic acid were measured as well at 12, 8 and 6h HRT, while ethanol production exhibited a maximum at 6h HRT (Table 1). Propionic and isobutyric acids were not detected at all during mesophilic hydrogen production from glucose in the CSTR. The distribution of metabolic products differed considerably under thermophilic conditions with the dominant metabolic products being acetic and butyric acids at almost equal amounts (Table 2). Furthermore, thermophilic conditions favored the production of L-lactic acid over D-lactic acid while ethanol was detected at very low concentrations (Table 2). It is noticeable that isobutyric acid was not detected at all, while propionic acid was found in small concentration only in the thermophilic system at a steady state of 2h HRT. Measured and calculated COD concentration of the reactor content for each steady state of mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. As already pointed out, the COD-others corresponds to the non-identified metabolic products during glucose fermentation. The COD-others represented only a relatively small percentage of the COD measured (Figs. 4, 5), with the minimum being 1% and the maximum 20% at 6 and 2h HRT, respectively for the mesophilic CSTR and with the minimum being 5% and the maximum 8% at 6 and 2h HRT respectively for the thermophilic CSTR. Therefore it can be assumed that the main metabolic products of glucose metabolism were the compounds already measured (butyric acid, acetic acid, D-, L-lactic acids and ethanol)."
8,Experiments with the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor(UASB) reactor at 35 ∘ C,"3.2 Experiments with the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor(UASB) reactor at 35 ∘ C No methane was detected during the experiments with the UASB reactor. The yield of hydrogen production and the hydrogen production rate at each steady state of the UASB reactor at different HRTs and liquid upward velocities ( V up ) is presented in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. For comparison purposes both figures include the corresponding values for the mesophilic CSTR. The yield of hydrogen production per unit of glucose consumed in the UASB reactor was almost stable for all HRT tested (mean value of 0.7 ± 0.1 mmole H 2 per mmole glucose) and lower than the one of the mesophilic CSTR (mean value of 1.7 ± 0.3 mmole H 2 per mmole glucose). On the other hand, the hydrogen production rate in the UASB reactor increased significantly (from 5.2 to 19 mmole H 2 /h/l) when the HRT decreased at 2h while the hydrogen production rate remained almost the same in the CSTR. It is noticeable that the hydrogen production rate in the UASB reactor exceeded more than two times the one of the CSTR at an HRT of 2h despite the low pH value in the UASB reactor (4.5), which is not the optimal for the hydrogenogenic process compared with the suggested optimal range of pH 5.0/5.5–6.0 by a number of studies [14,16,34]. This implies that the UASB reactor is more suitable for biological production of hydrogen at short HRT compared to the CSTR technology. However, a drawback of the UASB configuration and in general of the attached growth systems in comparison with the CSTR technology is that hydrogenotrophic methanogens could eventually grow even at low hydraulic retention times if a non-sterile feed is used. Thus, the use of attached growth systems is suggested with sterile feed. Such sterile raw material could originate from pre-treatment (wet oxidation or steam explosion) of lignocellulosic biomass like sorghum, straw and crop wastes [35]. Also, no significant effect of the V up on hydrogen production rate and yield of hydrogen was observed for the V up and HRT values tested. The characteristics of the UASB reactor at each steady state, including the concentration of metabolic products measured are presented in Table 3 . The efficiency of the UASB reactor for glucose consumption was impressively high compared with that of the CSTR with a maximum glucose removal of 100% and the lowest percentage of glucose removal being 87% at 2h HRT. This is most probably due to the higher solids retention time (SRT) in the UASB compared to the CSTR. The accumulation of active biomass in the UASB resulted to almost complete consumption of the substrate and consequently to higher hydrogen production rates at low HRT compared to the CSTR where SRT equals HRT. The concentration of hydrogen in the gas produced diminished with the HRT and was between 38% and 29%. Propionic and isobutyric acids were not detected at all. The production of D- and L-latic acid was insignificant at 12 and 6h HRT and the concentration of ethanol remained at low levels (below 100ppm) at all HRT tested. Acetic and butyric acids were the main soluble metabolic products. Their concentration was 2–4 times higher compared with the concentration of acetate and butyrate at the different steady states of the CSTR. The acetate and butyrate concentration and the pH value in the UASB reactor remained noticeably stable with the HRT. On the other hand the pH value of the mesophilic CSTR increased from 4.9 at 12h HRT to 6 at 2h HRT (Table 1). This was mainly due to the reduced degree of glucose biodegradation and consequently to the low concentration of acids generated in the CSTR at short HRTs. Fig. 8 presents the measured and calculated COD concentration at each steady state of the UASB reactor at 450 cm h - 1 V up . COD-products, COD-glucose and COD-others were calculated according to Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), respectively. It is obvious that the fraction of the COD-products corresponded to a great percentage (more than 80%) of the COD measured while the COD-others represented only a relatively small percentage (less than 10%) of the COD-measured. This confirmed that the main by-products of the glucose degradation in the UASB were the compounds already measured, namely the acetic, butyric, D-, L-lactic acids and ethanol. In Table 4 the yields of the metabolic products in the three systems, the mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR and mesophilic UASB, are shown. In general, production of acetic and butyric acid favours the production of hydrogen, according to Eqs. (4) and (5) [9,36]. (4) Acetic acid production C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 . (5) Butyric acid production C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 . Lactic acid is produced from glucose via three metabolic pathways, the homofermentative (Eq. (6)), the heterofermentative (Eq. (7)) and the bifidum pathway (Eq. (8)) [37]. In all three pathways the hydrogen balance is zero, i.e. no hydrogen is consumed nor produced. In general and taking into consideration that the maximum efficiency (yield) of hydrogen production is 4mmole H 2 / mmole glucose in acetic acid fermentations (Eq. (4)) one could say that when the microbial metabolism shifts to lactic acid from acetic or butyric acid production the efficiency of hydrogen production decreases. The same is for ethanol production, where the hydrogen balance is zero as well (Eq. (9)) [37]. (6) Homofermentative pathway C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CHOHCOOH . (7) Heterofermentative pathway C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CHOHCOOH + CH 3 CH 2 OH + CO 2 . (8) Bifidum pathway 2 C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH + 2 CH 3 CHOHCOOH . (9) Ethanol production C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 . Having a look in Table 4, one can observe that the yield of acetic acid was higher in the UASB reactor compared to both mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR. The yield of butyric acid was almost equal in the UASB reactor and mesophilic CSTR while it was higher in the UASB reactor compared to the thermophilic CSTR. On the other hand the yield of lactic acid was much lower in the UASB reactor than in the mesophilic and thermophilic CSTR. Hence, it could be anticipated that the hydrogen yield in the UASB system would be higher than the corresponding yields in the two CSTRs. However, this is not the case as Figs. 1 and 6 show. In fact, the hydrogen yield in the UASB reactor was much lower than the hydrogen yields in the CSTRs. In order to explain this discrepancy, the anticipated hydrogen production was calculated in each system, based on the metabolic products measured, i.e. 2mmole of hydrogen per 1 mmole of acetic acid produced and 2 mmoles of hydrogen per 1 mmole of butyric acid produced. The production rates of acetic and butyric acids and the theoretically calculated hydrogen production rate, r Hcalc , compared to the experimentally measured hydrogen production rate, r Hexp , are shown in Table 5 . One can observe that in the CSTRs the r Hcalc is in accordance with the r Hexp , while in the UASB system the r Hcalc is much higher than the r Hexp . Therefore, the assumption that one mmole of acetic and butyric acids is followed by 2mmole of hydrogen does not seem to be the case in the UASB reactor. It is possible that microorganisms producing acetic acid from glucose with no hydrogen production (Eq. (10)) or producing acetic acid with hydrogen consumption (Eq. (11)) [37] have been established in the UASB system probably due to the attached growth and the resulting long solids retention times. (10) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH , (11) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O . Concluding, thermophilic conditions combined high hydrogen production rate with low production of microbial mass resulting in a high specific hydrogen production rate (104mmole H 2 /h/l/g VSS compared to 12mmole H 2 / h / l / g VSS under mesophilic conditions at 6h HRT). The UASB reactor configuration was more stable than the CSTR at the HRT tested (12, 6 and 2h) regarding hydrogen production, pH, glucose consumption and microbial by-products. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate in the UASB reactor was significantly higher compared to that of the CSTR at low retention times (19.05 and 8.42mmole H 2 / h / l respectively at 2h HRT). On the other hand, hydrogen yield was higher in the CSTR reactor (Fig. 6). So there appears to be a trade-off between technical efficiency (based on hydrogen yield) and economic efficiency (based on hydrogen production rate at low HRT) since UASB configuration combines shorter HRT (and therefore lower capital cost) with higher hydrogen production rates compared to CSTR technology. Also, (although further experimental verification is needed) one could anticipate that immobilized microbial cultures under thermophilic conditions could be an economically more efficient configuration for the treatment of soluble carbohydrate sources for the production of hydrogen since they combine high hydrogen production rate with low generation of biomass and allow operation of the system at high dilution rates."
9,Conclusions,"Biohydrogen production from glucose at mesophilic ( 35 ∘ C ) and thermophilic ( 55 ∘ C ) temperature range in CSTR type bioreactor at different HRTs was investigated. Also the mesophilic biological production of hydrogen from glucose in a UASB reactor at various hydraulic retention times and recycling rates was studied and compared. Thermophilic conditions combined high hydrogen production rate with low production of microbial mass resulting in a high specific hydrogen production rate (104mmole H 2 /h/l/g VSS compared to 12mmole H 2 /h/l/g VSS under mesophilic conditions at 6h HRT). The UASB reactor configuration was more stable than the CSTR at the HRT tested (12, 6 and 2h) regarding hydrogen production, pH, glucose consumption and microbial by-products. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate in the UASB reactor was significantly higher compared to that of the CSTR at low retention times (19.05 and 8.42mmole H 2 /h/l respectively at 2h HRT). On the other hand, hydrogen yield was higher in the CSTR reactor at all HRT tested. This implies that there is a trade-off between technical efficiency (based on hydrogen yield) and economic efficiency (based on hydrogen production rate) when the attached (UASB) and suspended (CSTR) growth configurations are compared."
