0,Introduction,"Molecular hydrogen is currently regarded as a most promising future energy source as it shows clean combustion [1,2] and can easily be converted into electricity via fuel cells [3]. Moreover, it is important as an industrial commodity for the production of several bulk chemicals such as ammonia, alcohols and aldehydes [4]. Technical synthesis of hydrogen mainly relies on fossil resources today [5,6], but on the background of a greener future chemistry production with biological means and renewable resources has started to attract increased attention [7,8]. Biological hydrogen can be formed from carbon dioxide and water by many autotrophic photosynthetic organisms such as algae [9], cyanobacteria [10] and purple bacteria [11], or from organic matter by several heterotrophic, mostly anaerobic bacteria [12,13]. The latter approach is particularly appealing on consideration that growth can be performed on wastewater or solid waste, thus combining generation of a clean energy carrier with decomposition of organic pollutants [14,15]. Heterotrophic production of hydrogen can employ either pure or mixed bacterial cultures [16–18], but high rates of hydrogen evolution are almost always coupled to the predominant presence of diverse strains of saccharolytic clostridia [4,19]. Among these clostridia, a particularly good capability for hydrogen formation can be found in Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium acetobutylicum [17,20]. The rate of hydrogen production in these organisms is highest in the acidogenic growth phase, when acetic acid and butyric acid are produced [21], and seizes upon accumulation of the organic acids. Consequently, hydrogen fermentations employing these bacteria are generally pH-regulated. A major difference between the two organisms is the sole capability of C. acetobutylicum to prolong growth by reassimilation and subsequent conversion of organic acids to organic solvents, i.e. the implementation of a so-called solventogenic phase [21]. This has been extensively used to adapt C. acetobutylicum to solvent production by means of genetic engineering [22–24], and strongly recommends the organism as promising candidate for actual hydrogen production. Interestingly, studies on the metabolic fluxes and bottlenecks of hydrogen formation in C. acetobutylicum are only rare, albeit the organism is the best characterised saccharolytic Clostridium to date, the sequence of the complete genome has been determined [25], and it was one of the first clostridia, for which methods for efficient genetic manipulation were established [26,27]. An indication of intracellular hydrogenase levels being a metabolic bottleneck for clostridial hydrogen production might be the finding of Morimoto et al. [28] that hydrogen yields in Clostridium paraputrificum can be increased ∼1.7 fold by homologous overexpression of the [FeFe] hydrogenase (EC 1.12.7.2), which governs hydrogen production in all clostridia [21,29]. This study thoroughly investigated the influence of intracellular [FeFe] hydrogenase levels in C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 on the formation of molecular hydrogen. For this, the genes coding for the highly active hydrogenases of C. acetobutylicum (HydACa) and C. butyricum (HydACb) were fused to a plasmid vector and separately overexpressed in C. acetobutylicum. As the sequence of the [FeFe] hydrogenase of C. butyricum had not been described before, it was isolated from C. butyricum DSM 10702 and characterised prior to this overexpression. The performance of both recombinant strains with regard to hydrogen formation was evaluated in comparison to the wild type organism."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions","2.1 Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Clostridia were grown at 37°C at anaerobic conditions in clostridial growth medium (CGM) [30] (with glucose at 20gL−1). Media used in fermentations consisted of 20gL−1 glucose, 2.2gL−1 NaAcetate, 0.5gL−1 K2HPO4, 0.5gL−1 KH2PO4, 0.1gL−1 MgSO4 ×7H2O, 0.01gL−1 MnSO4 ×2H2O, 1mgL−1 p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.1mgL−1 biotin, 5gL−1 yeast extract and 10gL−1 peptone. Iron was supplemented as FeSO4 ×7H2O and concentrations varied between 0.01 and 0.06gL−1. For growth of recombinant clostridia liquid media were supplemented with erythromycin (100μgmL−1). In fermentations 0.67mLL−1 Plurafac® antifoam detergent (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) was added to the final medium. All media were sparged with argon or nitrogen for 10min (2Lmin−1). Strains of Escherichia coli were grown aerobically in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C. For hydrogenase expressions LB medium was supplemented with 0.1mM iron citrate. Media were supplemented with ampicillin (100μgmL−1), chloramphenicol (30μgmL−1) and/or streptomycin (50μgmL−1)."
3,DNA and RNA isolation and manipulation,"2.2 DNA and RNA isolation and manipulation Plasmids and PCR products were purified by using the HighPure Plasmid Isolation and HighPure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), respectively. Clostridial chromosomal DNA was isolated following a standard protocol for gram-positive bacteria and is described briefly in the supplementary material. Total RNA was extracted from clostridia by using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). An additional DNase I restriction (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase; Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was performed to remove trace amounts of genomic DNA. Reverse transcription of clostridial mRNA was done by using M-MLV from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). For lyses of clostridia cells all kits’ resuspension buffers were supplemented with lysozyme (10mgmL−1), and incubation times were elongated to 10min. All enzymes used in this study were purchased from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) or Promega (Mannheim, Germany)."
4,Cloning and expression of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from C. butyricum,"2.3 Cloning and expression of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from C. butyricum The gene coding for [FeFe] hydrogenase was cloned from C. butyricum DSM 10702 by genome walking using the Universal GenomeWalker™ Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Heidelberg) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Due to the high A+T content of clostridial DNA, restriction enzymes PvuII, EcoRV and HincII were used for the preparation of the GenomeWalker™ libraries. A more detailed description of the procedure can be found in the supplementary material. The whole hydA gene was amplified from C. butyricum genomic DNA using the primers HYDACB_down and HYDACB_up (Table 2 ). The gene was cloned into MCSI of pETDuet-1 (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany). The genes of the hydrogenase maturation factors hydE, hydF and hydG were PCR amplified from C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 chromosomal DNA. hydE was cloned into MCSII of pETDuet-1 whereas hydF and hydG were ligated into MCSI and MCSII of pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany), respectively. pETDuet-1 containing hydA and hydE was called pETDuetAE, whereas the same plasmid containing only hydE was called pETDuetE and was used as a control. pCDFDuetFG was the expression vector coding for hydF and hydG. Expression of the hyd genes was analysed using E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany). Cotransformation of the generated plasmids led to strains with a complete set of hydrogenase maturation genes each. Protein expression was performed following a protocol by King et al. [31] (see supplementary material)."
5,Construction of shuttle vectors for hydrogenase expression in C. acetobutylicum,"2.4 Construction of shuttle vectors for hydrogenase expression in C. acetobutylicum Construction of shuttle vectors for hydrogenase overexpression in C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 is shown in Fig. 1 . pSOS95 was cut with SalI to remove the ace-operon. By self-ligation the vector pSOS was generated. The hydrogenase genes from C. butyricum DSM 10702 and C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 were PCR amplified including their native promoters and terminator sequences using primer pairs HYDACBF/HYDACBR and HYDACAF/HYDACAR, respectively. The resulting fragments were ligated into the SalI site of pSOS creating the vectors pSOShydACb and pSOShydACa, respectively. To express hydrogenases with a C-terminal 6× His-tag, the same hydA genes were also amplified using primer pairs HYDABHis_down/HYDACBHis_up and HYDACAHis_down/HYDACAHis_up, respectively. The corresponding DNA-fragments were ligated into pSOS95 linearised by PstI and NarI to give pSOShydACbHis and pSOSHydACaHis, respectively."
6,Transformation of C. acetobutylicum,"2.5 Transformation of C. acetobutylicum Electroporation of C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 was carried out according to Nakotte et al. [32] with minor changes using the MicroPulser™ (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) (see supplementary material)."
7,Bio-reactor experiments,"2.6 Bio-reactor experiments Batch fermentations were carried out at 37°C in standard 1L flasks (Schott, Mainz, Germany) equipped with ports for a pH electrode, sampling and gas outlet. The gas was directed to a BCS H2 sensor (BlueSens, Herten, Germany) and a gas counter (Ritter, Bochum, Germany) to measure amount and H2 content, respectively. Cultures were stirred on a magnetic stirrer at a constant speed of 300rpm and pH was set to 6.0 with 3M NaOH."
8,Cell disruption,"2.7 Cell disruption E. coli and C. acetobutylicum cells were resuspended in anoxic 100mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 and suspensions supplemented with lysozyme (1 and 10mgmL−1, respectively). Disruption was achieved by sonication in an anaerobic chamber using the Sonopuls HD200 (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany) in cycles of 15s for 2 and 3min, respectively. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (24,000× g, 20min, 4°C)."
9,Quantitative PCR amplification,"2.8 Quantitative PCR amplification Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using the ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). The gene coding for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapC) was used as a standard. The Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-VDG with Rox (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and primers HYDA_187_down/HYDA_366_up and GAPC_527_down/GAPC_697_up were used to amplify the corresponding cDNA. Each sample subjected to qPCR was run in two different dilutions. The cycling included an initial holding of 2min at 95°C, followed by 41 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15s and annealing plus elongation at 60°C for 1min."
10,[FeFe] hydrogenase activity,"2.9 [FeFe] hydrogenase activity Hydrogenase activity in whole cell extracts of E. coli and C. acetobutylicum was determined by following the reduction of methylviologen (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) with H2 at 604nm. Reactions were run in an airtight lockable 1.4mL cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany). The lid contained a rubber septum allowing the addition of samples by using a syringe. All reactions had a total volume of 1mL and were carried out in 100mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 1mM methylviologen. The solution was saturated with H2 and reactions were started by addition of 2–10μL of whole cell extracts. 1 unit of hydrogenase was defined as the amount of enzyme catalysing the reduction of 1μmol methylviologen per min. The molar extinction coefficient of reduced methylviologen was found to be 8.58mM−1 cm−1. Specific activities were calculated by dividing the measured activities by the cell extracts’ protein contents, which were determined according to Bradford [33]."
11,Analytical methods,"2.10 Analytical methods Soluble fermentation products were detected by HPLC. Samples (2mL) withdrawn from the reactor were centrifuged (14,100× g, 5min) and analysed using the HPLC System Gold® (Beckmann Coulter, Fullerton, USA). The system was equipped with an organic acid-resin-column (300mm×8mm, CS Chromatografieservice, Langerwehe, Germany) and 2mM H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6mLmin−1. The temperature of the column was set to 30°C. All samples were diluted 1:10 with 2mM H2SO4. The injection volume was 20μL and detection of the various compounds was accomplished by an RI detector. Typical retention times were 18.0, 26.4 and 43.0min for acetic acid, butyric acid and 1-butanol, respectively. Glucose concentrations were determined using the HPLC system DX 500 from Dionex (Sunnyvale, USA) equipped with an anion exchange column (Carbopack PA 1) and a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD-ED 40). The temperature of the setup was controlled at 30°C. NaOH and NaAcetate were used as eluents at a flow rate of 1mLmin−1. The profile of the eluent run during HPLC analysis is shown in Table S1 of the supplementary material."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Identification and analysis of hydA from C. butyricum DSM 10702,"3.1 Identification and analysis of hydA from C. butyricum DSM 10702 PCR and nested PCR with the degenerate gene specific primers HYDAD1 and HYDAD2 (Table 2) on GenomeWalker™ libraries of C. butyricum DSM 10702 amplified a ∼1.2kb DNA fragment of the hydA gene. Further walks upstream and downstream of this sequence revealed an open reading frame consisting of 1722bp coding for a protein of 574 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of ∼63.1kDa. The nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number EF627973. Homology studies of the deduced HydACb amino acid sequence showed high similarities to the published sequences of [FeFe] hydrogenases of diverse clostridia. The highest homology of about 80% was found with the enzyme from Clostridium saccharobutylicum DSM 13864, and a sequence identity of ∼67% with the enzyme from Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525, which is the only [FeFe] hydrogenase, whose crystal structure is available to date [34,35], was determined. The alignment with this enzyme demonstrated that all amino acid residues involved in the coordination of iron sulfur clusters are conserved in HydACb emphasising their structural significance and related importance for the catalytic activity of this enzyme. The actual hydrogenase activity of HydACb was confirmed by expression in E. coli after the isolated gene was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pETDuet-1 and transformed into the host organisms E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain which does not display any hydrogenase background activity. As [FeFe] hydrogenases contain a unique active site termed H-cluster, which can only be integrated into the apo-protein by specific maturation proteins [36–38], active HydACb was detected in cell extracts of E. coli after in vitro addition of hydrogenase-free cell extracts from recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the heterologously expressed maturation factors from C. acetobutylicum, according to the method of McGlynn et al. [38]. In contrast, direct expression of active HydACb by co-expression with all three maturation proteins in the E. coli host strain was not possible. Most probably, at least one of the maturation factors was not correctly expressed in this system, which is contrary to the findings of King et al. [31], who reported the active expression of several algal and bacterial hydrogenases in E. coli employing the same clostridial maturation factors."
14,Recombinant expression of hydA from C. acetobutylicum and C. butyricum in C. acetobutylicum,"3.2 Recombinant expression of hydA from C. acetobutylicum and C. butyricum in C. acetobutylicum The hydrogenase genes from C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 (hydACa) and C. butyricum DSM 10702 (hydACb) were cloned into the E. coli–C. acetobutylicum shuttle-vector pSOS (Fig. 1), and the resulting vectors (pSOShydACa and pSOShydACb) were separately transformed into C. acetobutylicum DSM 792. After pH-controlled fermentation of both recombinant strains and a control strain containing the empty pSOS vector, cells were analysed for the transcription of plasmid encoded hydA mRNA and hydrogenase activity. For analysis of hydACb expression by C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACb], mRNA was extracted and reversely transcribed using random nonamers; plasmid derived hydACb cDNA was then detected by PCR using a primer which specifically bound to hydACb (Fig. 2 , lane 2), but not to the host organism's endogenous hydACa. The specificity of the employed primer for hydACb was verified in control PCRs where the whole genomic DNA of the wild type C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 and of the pSOShydACb harbouring strain served as template DNA, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). Samples where reverse transcriptase had been omitted during cDNA synthesis (−RT) served as a negative control to avoid false positive results due to PCR amplification of contaminating pSOShydACb plasmid DNA (Fig. 2, lane 3). Accordingly, the cDNA fragment could not be amplified in the control strains C. acetobutylicum [pSOS] and the wild type C. acetobutylicum (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) and thus clearly demonstrated the successful heterologous transcription of the plasmid encoded hydACb gene in C. acetobutylicum. In C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACa] plasmid encoded hydA mRNA cannot be distinguished from the native endogenous transcript. However, due to the additional copies of the hydA gene, cells harbouring pSOShydACa should reveal a considerable increase in hydA transcript levels compared to the pSOS control strain. In fact, when hydA mRNA was quantified by qPCR in C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACa] and C. acetobutylicum [pSOS] cells withdrawn from fermentations after reaching maximum volumetric hydrogen productivities at the end of the exponential growth phase, a four times higher level of hydA mRNA was found in C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACa] compared to the control C. acetobutylicum [pSOS] (Fig. 3 ). This clearly demonstrates the successful transcription of the plasmid encoded hydACa gene in C. acetobutylicum. Efficiency of hydA expression in both recombinant C. acetobutylicum strains was estimated via the specific hydrogenase activity in comparable growth phases. Corresponding to the results of the transcription analysis, C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACa] displayed considerably increased specific activities (Fig. 4 ) compared to the wild type C. acetobutylicum and C. acetobutylicum [pSOS]. In contrast, the specific hydrogenase activity of C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACb] was only slightly increased. This might indicate a low affinity of the C. acetobutylicum RNA polymerase towards the promoter of hydACb (P hydACb ) applied in this study. A more detailed investigation of the performance of P hydACb was not conducted. Nevertheless, western blot analyses of His-tagged HydACa and HydACb with penta-His antibody also point to the fact that hydACb expression from pSOShydACb is much lower compared to hydACa expression from pSOShydACa in C. acetobutylicum (Fig. 5 ). This result points into the same direction as the activity results. In summary it can be concluded that [FeFe] hydrogenase can successfully be overexpressed in C. acetobutylicum as long as a functional promoter is used. With regard to hydACa this is in accordance with the findings by Girbal et al. [39], who expressed this enzyme for functional characterisation."
15,Hydrogen production by recombinant C. acetobutylicum,"3.3 Hydrogen production by recombinant C. acetobutylicum pH-controlled batch cultures of C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACa] and C. acetobutylicum [pSOShydACb] were finally analysed for volumetric hydrogen evolution, glucose consumption and production of soluble fermentation products. Results are summarised in Table 3 . Glucose was completely consumed and limited hydrogen production as indicated by a sharp decline of the overall gas evolution. Solvent production was generally low and usually lay below the detection threshold. The major soluble fermentation products were acetic and butyric acid indicating that pH regulation and relatively low glucose concentrations prevented the production of cytotoxic concentrations of organic acids and therefore a switch from the acidogenic to the solventogenic growth. Hence, optimal hydrogen evolution rates can be assumed [21]. Interestingly, volumetric hydrogen formation revealed a comparable pattern in all investigated strains despite the obvious differences in specific hydrogenase activities. The maximum volumetric hydrogen production rates of the recombinant organisms were even slightly reduced compared to the wild type C. acetobutylicum. The same result arose for hydrogen yields related to glucose consumption. Supplementation of the fermentation medium with iron, in order to ensure formation of essential iron–sulfur clusters [34] for HydA, had no effect on the hydrogen production or on the formation of any other fermentation products (data not shown). The results clearly demonstrate that hydrogen evolution by C. acetobutylicum is not limited by the availability of active HydA, which is in contrast to the findings of Morimoto et al. [28] for hydrogen production in C. paraputrificum. Consequently, the bottleneck for hydrogen production using this overall promising organism has to be found in a different path of the metabolism. The many possible reasons for the limitation of hydrogen formation make further systematic investigation necessary. Hydrogen production in saccharolytic clostridia is the final step of a pathway that disposes excess electrons from these organisms. This pathway is initiated by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Fig. 6 ) by the very oxygen-sensitive pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR, EC 1.2.7.1). This enzyme transfers electrons to oxidised ferredoxin (a low-molecular-weight, iron–sulfur-containing protein) [21,40], which is in contrast to pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes that generally are NAD+-dependant. Only reduced ferredoxin (and under iron-deficient conditions probably also flavodoxin) can directly be utilized as an electron donor by [FeFe] hydrogenase to generate molecular hydrogen in vivo [20,21]. As less NAD+ needs to be regenerated for the appropriate function of glycolysis, acetic acid production can occur, which leads to higher ATP yields, but does not regenerate any NAD+. In contrast, butyric acid formation regenerates NAD+, but yields less ATP compared to acetic acid formation. The fact that, in this work, volumetric hydrogen production rates cannot be increased by hydrogenase overexpression shows that intracellular levels of this enzyme are not limiting under the applied fermentation conditions. The bottleneck limiting hydrogen production could therefore be anywhere in the glycolytic pathway, including pyruvate oxidation by PFOR. An increase of enzyme activity at the potential bottleneck would accelerate glucose catabolism leading to an increase of electron transfer via ferredoxin to hydrogenase. As in growing clostridia intracellular contents of ferredoxin can account for up to 1.1% of the total protein [41] it can be presumed that levels of this electron transferring protein are not limiting for hydrogen evolution. Additionally, glycolysis could also be limited by NAD+ regeneration, so that every reaction leading from acetyl-CoA to butyric acid could be the rate-limiting step as well, since this is the only way to regenerate NAD+ during acidogenesis. Liu et al. [42] reported an almost two-fold increase of hydrogen production in Clostridium tyrobutyricum upon disruption of the acetate kinase gene, which might point into the same direction: the metabolic block prevents ATP synthesis via this pathway accelerating butyric acid formation to increase ATP production and hence, NAD+ regeneration, glycolysis and hydrogen production. Possibly a combined disruption of the acetate kinase gene with hydrogenase overexpression would achieve additional improvements. The application of excess glucose concentrations in batch cultures would lead to the production of cytotoxic levels of organic acids, which in turn would cause the organism to switch to solventogenesis and therefore would lead to a drastic decrease in hydrogen production. However, the aforementioned metabolic bottlenecks will only have a strong impact, if hydrogenase activity is not overall restricted by thermodynamic parameters, which have to be considered independent of the employed host organism. Many enzymatic reactions can only proceed, if their products are constantly removed, particularly when regulated by feedback inhibition and when in redox reactions the electron acceptor exhibits a more negative reduction potential than the corresponding donor. The first mechanism could considerably contribute to the limitation of [FeFe] hydrogenase activity as against the predictions calculated from Henry's Law the concentration of dissolved hydrogen reaches exceptional supersaturation in fermentation broths [43,44]. The hydrogen concentration could also affect central redox reactions such as the reduction of ferredoxin by PFOR or the electron transfer from NADH to ferredoxin by a NADH ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC 1.18.1.3) (Fig. 6) [45]. Both these reactions are known to depend on the hydrogen partial pressure and particularly the latter is thermodynamically unfavoured due to the aforementioned discrepancy of the reduction potentials between NADH and ferredoxin [46]. A reduction of the hydrogen concentration in the fermentation broth might therefore increase the overall production of hydrogen by technical means. This has been shown in several investigations [47,48]. An ultimate solution and challenging task in the optimisation of biological hydrogen production will therefore probably involve the systematic combination of technical reduction of dissolved hydrogen and biochemical metabolic engineering."
16,Conclusion,"Saccharolytic clostridia are a promising target for metabolic engineering strategies to improve biological hydrogen production. In the present work effects of hydrogenase overexpression on hydrogen evolution of C. acetobutylicum DSM 792 in batch fermentations were investigated. Although overexpression could be clearly demonstrated, no influence on fermentation patterns could be observed at any conditions applied. These results suggest that intracellular hydrogenase concentrations do not limit fermentative hydrogen production in this strain and that difficulties such as hydrogen-supersaturated fermentation broths must be overcome before the use of hydrogenase overexpressing strains can possibly lead to additional improvements."
