0,Introduction,"During the petroleum production, especially the unconventional oils processing, the oil–water emulsions (W/O and O/W) are inevitably formed due to the presence of natural interfacially active materials or added surfactants [1,2]. The natural interfacial-active materials in petroleum mainly contain naphthenic acids, asphaltenes and some resins [3]. In these natural surfactants, asphaltenes are considered as the main components in stabilizing the oil–water emulsions [4]. Actually, the asphaltenes are the most complex substances in petroleum, composed of aliphatic chains, polyaromatic condensed rings, organometallic complexes, and heteroatoms of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur [5]. This fraction is often separated by solvent settling by low-boiling paraffinic solvents such as n-pentane or n-heptane [6]. Because of the rich polar groups in asphaltenes, they show some specific interfacial active properties, including the accumulating at oil–water interface, adsorbing on the surfaces of minerals or equipment wall [7]. The asphaltene stabilized oil–water emulsions not only cause serious corrosion to pipeline and downstream equipment [8-10], but also deteriorate the quality of heavy oil. To effectively separate the asphaltene-stabilized oil–water emulsions, it is a prerequisite to clarify the stable mechanism. Up to now, great efforts have been made on detecting the asphaltene stabilized oil–water emulsions, showing that asphaltenes could form a rigid layer (i.e., interfacial film) at the oil–water interface. This interfacial film can prevent coalescence between water droplets by providing mechanical strength [11-13]. Ortiz et al [14] pointed that this interfacial film is formed by nano asphaltene aggregates at the oil–water interface. It was proposed that the complex intermolecular interactions and bonds, including acid-base interaction, hydrogen bonding, metal coordination complexes, etc., were involved in the aggregation of asphaltenes, resulting in the formation of thicker and more stable films [15,16]. However, Xu et al [17] and later Yang et al [3] found that only the most surface-active subfraction of the asphaltenes contributed to the high stability of the emulsion. Yang et al [3] separated the interfacial-active material from emulsified water droplets and named it as interfacially active asphaltene (IAA). They considered IAA plays the major role in stabilizing the W/O emulsions. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of IAA stabilized oil–water emulsions is not yet clear. Chemical demulsification is the most widely used demulsification method [18]. Generally, the chemical demulsification works in three-stages: (1) Demulsifiers penetrate into stable films at the oil–water interface [19]; (2) Demulsifiers substitute the surfactants in the original interfacial film [20]; (3) Demulsifiers restrict the variations in the gradients of interfacial tension through the Marangoni effect [21] and cause the separation of oil and water. There are many different demulsifiers being produced for the demulsification of oil–water emulsions, such as cationic demulsifiers, ionic demulsifiers and non-ionic demulsifiers. From the environmental protection aspect, the non-ionic demulsifiers, such as ethyl cellulose (EC) [19,22], ethylene oxide-propylene oxide (EO-PO) block copolymers [23-27], and poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers [28], are considered to be the promising candidate for petroleum emulsions. The related research shows that the non-ionic demulsifier possess great demulsification effect in breaking asphaltene stabilized oil–water emulsions [29,30]. It is believed that nonionic demulsifier can break the asphaltene stabilized oil–water emulsions by replacement [30,31], because of that the surface activity of the nonionic demulsifier is stronger than that of asphaltenes. Therefore, it can preferentially adsorb on the oil–water interface, significantly reducing the interfacial tension of oil–water [32], replacing the asphaltene aggregates adsorbed at the oil–water interface [33], and finally demulsifying the oil–water emulsions. According to esterification and polymerization reaction, we synthesized an aliphatic alcohol nonionic polyether (MJTJU-2). This polymer performed well in demulsifying the water-in-oil emulsions, even the IAA-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions [34]. However, limited to the detection method, the detailed molecular mechanisms on how the MJTJU-2 breaks the IAA film and finally separates the water from the oil phase is still not clear. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method is a computational method emerging in past decades [35]. With the help of high speed computer, we can not only investigate the mechanisms of some processes from a molecular level, but also save time and lab forces. In addition, it can also be employed as a tool to predict experimental results, do molecular design, etc. Some researchers applied the molecular dynamics simulation to study how asphaltenes stabilize emulsions [34,36-40]. They found that the asphaltene molecules could form aggregates by π-π stacking interactions at the oil–water interface. The asphaltene molecules are also found to be perpendicular to the oil–water interface [41]. However, because of the lack of heteroatoms in the model asphaltenes during their simulation, little information is reported and discussed on the weak forces, such as hydrogen bonds. The demulsification mechanisms of IAA-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions by nonionic demulsifier at molecular level are also unknown for us. Accordingly, herein, to further reveal the stability and demulsification mechanisms of IAA-stabilized W/O emulsions, we will apply the molecular dynamic simulation method to investigate the molecular interactions between IAAs, demulsifiers and water. Our detailed purposes are to: (i) reveal the stability mechanism of IAA-stabilized W/O emulsions; (iii) understand the demulsification mechanism of the novel oxygen-containing demulsifier in demulsifying the IAA-stabilized W/O emulsion; (iii) find out how the hydrogen bonds play the roles in demulsification. We hope, according to this work, to find a new way to design highly efficient demulsifiers for the demulsification of asphaltene-stabilized water-in-(heavy) oil emulsions."
1,Simulation Methodology,
2,Selection and construction of calculation model,"2.1 Selection and construction of calculation model The selected molecular structures are water, toluene and interfacially active asphaltene (IAA). The IAA is extracted from the Indonesian asphalt rocks. The typical molecular structure of IAA is determined by instrumental characterizations and numerical optimization [31]. See Section 3 of supplementary information for structural characteristics analysis of IAA. The molecular formula of IAA is C72H93NO3S4 with the average relative molecular weight is 1147. The IAA structure of geometry optimization by materials studio software is shown in Fig. 1 . The forcite module in the material studio software is used to investigate the stable mechanism of IAA-stabilized W/O emulsion. The oil–water mixture model was constructed as shown in Fig. 2 a, which is calculated by atomic MD method. To build the initial configuration for this system, a simulation box of 4.0 × 4.0 × 9.3 nm3 were filled with model molecules. The model consists of 400 toluene molecules, 3000 water molecules and 10 IAA molecules. Herein, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation technique in the material studio software has been used to study the demulsification process of the emulsion. The related DPD theory was described in the section 1 of supplementary information. The primary step of using DPD to perform simulation studies is the coarse-graining of the molecular structure [36,40,42]. In this step, the selected molecular structure models were coarse-grained with different beads. As shown in Fig. 2c-2e, IAA molecule was replaced with 8 beads, the toluene molecule was replaced with 2 beads. The three water molecules were replaced with one bead [40]. Since the demulsifier is a polymer with high molecular weight (6842 g/mol) [34], to shorten the calculation time and improve the calculation efficiency, we choose the diblock oxygen-containing demulsifier as the molecular structure model for the demulsifier. In this way, the demulsifier molecule was replaced with 16 beads. The atomic clusters represented by each bead and repulsive force parameters between the beads are shown in Table 1 . The repulsive force parameters between the beads were calculated by the blends module in the material studio software [36]."
3,Forcite simulation details,"2.2 Forcite simulation details Firstly, the geometric configuration of IAA structure was optimized. Calculation accuracy was chosen ultra-fine. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was carried out at NVT-ensemble (constant number of atoms (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) for the established sorption system). Temperature and pressure were set at 298 K and 1 atm, respectively, using the algorithm described by Berendsen et al. (1984). The COMPASS II was selected as the force field. Van der Waals and electrostatic interaction were all based on group based, cut off distance is 1.85 nm. The dynamic time and time step were 500 ps and 1 fs, respectively. Full trajectory was saved and frames were output every 5 ps. The system was equilibrium when the energy and temperature fluctuated around a constant value (Section 4.1 of supplementary information)."
4,Dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation details,"2.3 Dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation details In this paper, the related DPD simulations were carried out using the Mesocite module in Material Studio. The simulations were accomplished in a cubic box (Fig. 2b), the size of box is 5 × 5 × 5 nm3. The number of beads was 1.92 × 105, and the periodic boundary temperature is 295 K in the box. The length scale (Rc), mass scale (m), and time scales (Ʈ) in physical units were 6.46 Å, 54 amu, and 8.8 ps, respectively. According to the real experimental process. The original components of the system were consisted of: 1.02 wt% IAA, 10.20 wt% water, 88.72 wt% toluene and 0.06 wt% demulsifier were added to simulate the demulsification process. To better understand the demulsification mechanisms, the DPD simulated time step is set as 10000 ps. Simulation balance verification was shown Section 4.1 of supplementary information."
5,Analysis of demulsification mechanism,"2.4 Analysis of demulsification mechanism To understand the roles of MJTJU-2 in demulsifying the IAA-W/O emulsion, the mechanism of demulsification is described from two aspects of interaction energy and hydrogen bond. The interaction energy and hydrogen bond function can be described by radial distribution function (RDF) and hydrogen bond energy, respectively. The radial distribution function can be calculated using formula (1)[43-45]. The radial distribution function of the W/O emulsion system and the different demulsifier systems are calculated accordingly. (1) ρ i j r = Δ N ij r → r + Δ r V 4 π ∙ r 2 Δ r N i N j where V is the system volume, Ni and Nj are number of i and j, respectively, and ΔNij (r → r + Δr) is the ensemble averaged number of i around j within a shell from r to r + Δr. The hydrogen bond energy is calculated as follows [46,47]: first, the simulation system was calculated by all atom molecular dynamics, then hydrogen bonds was detected by the hydrogen bond detection module of material studio software, finally the hydrogen bonds energy were calculated by energy dynamics."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Rationality analysis of IAA molecular structure model,"3.1 Rationality analysis of IAA molecular structure model As reported previously, the elemental composition and potential molecular structure of IAA molecules have been determined [48]. To test the rationality of the proposed molecular structure model of IAA, herein, the simulation density was compared with the actual density to verify the rationality of IAA molecular structure model. Firstly, the IAA molecular structure has been evaluated by energy minimization using the force field MS software. Then, the system containing 15 IAA molecules was constructed by using amorphous cell module. The molecular dynamics simulation of 250 ps was carried out in NPT-ensemble (constant number of atoms (n), pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the established sorption system). Finally, the average density of IAA molecular simulation was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the energy minimization of the IAA structure was performed to achieve a stable configuration. Fig. 4 shows the results of molecular dynamics calculation for the periodic boundary system with 15 IAA monomers. Obviously, the energy and temperature of the system eventually tend to be stable in less than 50 ps (Fig. 4c and 4d). Under this equilibrium status, the system reaches the lowest energy. The average density of IAA also finally tends to be 1.1 g/cm3 (Fig. 4e). This density is very close to the experimental data (about 1.15 g/cm3) at room temperature with the relative error less than 4.54% [49-51]. According to the above analysis results, the proposed molecular structure model of IAA monomer is reasonable, which can be further applied to the following atom molecular dynamics and mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulation."
8,Adsorption and accumulation of IAA at oil–water interface,"3.2 Adsorption and accumulation of IAA at oil–water interface Fig. 5 shows the distribution state of IAA molecules at the oil–water interface, which are obtained by atomic MD method. A mixed oil–water model system was constructed (Fig. 5a). After 500 ps, it is found that the IAA molecules diffuse from the oil phase to the oil–water interface and accumulate at the toluene-water interface (Fig. 5b). To further understand how fast the IAA molecules diffuse to the oil–water interface, the diffusion coefficients of IAA molecules in different systems (toluene phase, water phase and oil–water interface) have been calculated. Herein, the mean square displacement (MSD) [52] is used to calculate the diffusion coefficients of IAA molecules in above systems. According to calculation results (Fig. 6 ), the diffusion coefficients of IAA in toluene, oil–water interface and water are 38.3 × 10-10 m2s−1、6.5 × 10-10 m2s−1、4.2 × 10-10 m2s−1, respectively. This result suggests that IAA molecules can diffuse from the oil phase to the oil–water interface, consistent with the experimental results[34]. Notes: Red molecules represent toluene; dark blue molecules represent IAA molecules; wathet blue molecules represent water molecules. After the diffusion to the oil–water interface, the IAA molecules could accumulate at the oil–water interface, forming a stable oil-water interfacial film. Herein, the thickness of the interfacial film increases with the increase of IAA concentration in oil phase (as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2 ). It is reported that asphaltenes accumulate at the oil–water interface mainly through weak forces, such as non-covalent bonds, including the π-π stacking, hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions between asphaltene molecules [7,53]. Under this condition, the association and aggregation between asphaltene molecules will easily occur, forming an interfacial film with specific thickness [54]. The lateral interaction of asphaltene molecules adsorbed at the oil–water interface and the affinity of the oleophilic groups increase the rigidity of the interfacial film, leading to the stabilization of the oil–water emulsion [16]. With the increase of asphaltene concentration, the self-assembly ability of asphaltene molecules at the oil–water interface will be enhanced. The thickness of the interfacial film will increase continuously, which is proportional to the asphaltene concentration [16,38,55]. This increased thick interfacial film allows the oil–water emulsion to be more stable."
9,Molecular interactions of IAA at the oil–water interface,"3.3 Molecular interactions of IAA at the oil–water interface To further understand how the IAA molecules form the interfacial film and stabilize the oil–water emulsion, the molecular interactions between different molecules have been analyzed (Fig. 8 ). After 500 ps, the oil–water system reaches the equilibrium state (Fig. 8a and 8b). The nonpolar fatty chains in IAA molecules are intertwined. It is found that the π-π stacking force presents between different aromatic rings in IAA molecules (Fig. 8c and 8d). In this way, these IAA molecules could self-aggregate at the oil–water interface (Fig. 9 ). To clearly observe the adsorption behavior of IAA molecules at the oil–water interface, toluene molecules are hidden when the calculation of oil–water mixed system reaches equilibrium. As shown in Fig. 10 a and 10b, a number of IAA molecules could stack together and self-aggregate. It is also found that the N、S and O atoms in the IAA molecule can form hydrogen bonds with H atom in the water molecule, shown in Fig. 10c. If the heteroatoms (N、O、S) in the IAA molecule were replaced by H atoms, the distribution form of IAA molecules do not accumulate at the toluene-water interface, but in the toluene phase, shown in Fig. 11 . There is also no hydrogen bond between IAA and water molecules. Therefore, the heteroatoms in IAA molecule play the key roles in generating hydrogen bond with water molecules. This interaction helps IAA molecules accumulate at the oil–water interface, forming the IAA interfacial film. Table 3 shows the hydrogen bonds in IAA molecules and those between IAA molecules and water molecules. It is obvious that there are different types of hydrogen bonding in IAA molecules, including S = O…H-O, R-OH…H-O, N-H…N-R, S-H…S = O, S-H…S-R. It should be noted that the hydrogen bond energies between O、N and H atoms are higher than those between S and H atoms. The strongest hydrogen bond is found between O and H atoms in S = O functional group (28.231 kJ/mol). While the weakest hydrogen bond energy is observed between S and H atoms in fatty sulfur functional group (14.254 kJ/mol). When the IAA molecules are contacting with the water molecules, it is found that the IAA molecules would form some different hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. This interaction would be the major driving force which makes the IAA molecules accumulating at the oil–water interface. However, the hydrogen bond energies between IAA and water molecules are much smaller than the intermolecular hydrogen bond energies in IAA molecules. The hydrogen bond energy between O、N in IAA and H in water are found to be higher than those between S and H atoms. It indicated that the interaction between water molecules and functional groups containing N and O in IAA molecules is stronger than those between functional groups containing S and water molecules. According to above hydrogen bonding analysis, it is clear that the hydrogen bonds play an important role in self-aggregating and accumulating at the oil–water interface. This accumulation behavior leads to the formation of the interfacial film. The interfacial film possesses strong viscoelasticity, which protects the coalescence of the emulsion droplets and finally allows the emulsions to be stable for a long time[34]."
10,Dynamic demulsification process,"3.4 Dynamic demulsification process The experimental tests show that the IAA stabilized emulsions are extremely stable which could be kept for over 2 years without any demulsification. Our synthesized demulsifiers, MJTJU-2, are found to perform well in demulsifying this kind of emulsions[34]. Herein, the DPD simulation method was used to reveal the dynamic demulsification process from molecular level, shown in Fig. 12 . Results showed that the demulsifier could promote flocculation, coalescence and stratification of the water in emulsions (Fig. 12a and 13a). After the demulsification of IAA-W/O emulsion, MJTJU-2 and IAA molecules are clustered together and IAAs are distributed in the oil phase (Fig. 12b). In addition, most of the MJTJU-2 molecules are adsorbed at the surface of water molecules, and only a small part of demulsifiers are distributed in the oil phase, indicating MJTJU-2 is hydrophilic and lipophilic (Fig. 12c and Fig. 13 b). This is consistent with the experimental results ( Section 2 of supplementary information). Fig. 14 shows the relative concentration change of water in X, Y and Z directions. At initial state, the water distributes uniformly in the W/O emulsion system. After the dynamic demulsification process, water molecules finally coalesced on the XOZ flat surface. It indicates that the water molecules have gathered and coalesced. The above results show that the MJTJU-2 demulsifier can promote the aggregation and coalescence of water molecules in IAA-stabilized W/O emulsion, further completing the demulsification of oil–water emulsion."
11,Demulsification mechanism,"3.5 Demulsification mechanism To describe the interaction between molecules during demulsification of IAA stabilized W/O emulsions. A radial distribution function (RDF) was introduced to represent the molecular configuration and orderly molecular combination. The radial distribution function is computed for all pairs of beads or centroids with a distance less than the cutoff value. The radial distribution function peak is larger, the more ordered arrangement between the molecules, the stronger the interaction between the beads. The results are shown in Fig. 15 a. The radial distribution function of demulsifier-water and IAA-water in demulsification system showed strong peaks in the 6.25 nm. Results show that there are specific interactions among MJTJU-2, IAA and water molecules. However, the peak between MJTJU-2 molecules and water molecules is sharper than that between the IAA molecules and water molecules, indicating that there is competition between MJTJU-2 demulsifier molecules and IAA molecules during the demulsification process. According to the curve of RDF changing with distance, the change of mean force potential (PMF) with distance between IAA molecule, MJTJU-2 demulsifier molecules and water molecules were calculated based on formula (2)[56], as shown in Fig. 15b. (2) W r = - k B T l n ρ r where, W(r) is potential of mean force, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10-23 J/K), T is temperature (K), ρ r is probability density (obtained by RDF). The interaction energies between MJTJU-2 and water, IAA and water, MJTJU-2 and IAA are −1.77 kJ / mol, −1.53 kJ / mol and 0.27 kJ / mol, respectively. This result indicates that the interaction between MJTJU-2 and water is stronger than that between IAA and water. In addition, according to the calculation of all atom molecular dynamics, it is found that different hydrogen bonds are formed between the MJTJU-2 and water molecules, as shown in Fig. 16 . According to analysis of the oil–water interface situation (Section 4.2 of Supplementary information). These hydrogen bond energies are further calculated, shown in Table 4 . It is observed that the hydrogen bonds formed by the oxygen in the ester group and carboxyl group in MJTJU-2 and the hydrogen of the water is stronger than the hydrogen bonds formed between the IAA molecules, and the hydrogen bonds formed by the heteroatoms in the IAA molecule and the hydrogen in the water (Table 3). When the MJTJU-2 demulsifier was added to the system, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds energies in IAA molecules, the intermolecular hydrogen bond energies between IAA molecules and water molecules were sharply decreased at least 50% (Table 4). Table 5 shows the intramolecular interactions in IAA molecules before and after the addition of MJTJU-2 molecules. It is obvious that the presence of MJTJU-2 molecules could significantly reduce the intramolecular interactions in IAA molecules from 138.467 kJ.mol−1 to 33.043 kJ.mol−1. According to this result, it is inferred that, at the oil–water interface, the non-bond energy of π-π stacking and interactions between fatty chains in IAA molecules decreased significantly. The above results indicate that MJTJU-2 molecules could replace the IAA molecules adsorbed on the surface of water molecules mainly by hydrogen bond. The oxygen in MJTJU-2 and the hydrogen in water molecules can form new stronger hydrogen bonds (hydrogen bond reconstructing). Under the interaction of hydrogen bonds, MJTJU-2 can adsorb on the surface of water molecules and further dissolve in water, thus promoting the aggregation and coalescence of water droplets, and finally completing the demulsification of IAA-stabilized W/O emulsions."
12,Conclusions,"During the unconventional oil ores production, the oil–water emulsions are frequently formed by the interfacially active materials, including natural substances (i.e., asphaltenes, etc.) and chemical additives (e.g., surfactants). As a subfraction of asphaltenes, the interfacially active asphaltenes (IAA) are found to play the key roles in stabilizing the oil–water emulsions by accumulating at the oil–water interface. In addition to the π-π stacking (forming self-aggregates or clusters), the IAA molecules would form hydrogen bonds with themselves and water molecules due to the presence of heteroatoms (N、O、S). These non-covalent bonds allow the IAA molecules to form strong interfacial film at the oil–water interface. This film hinders the coalescence of water droplets in emulsions. When the oxygen-containing demulsifier (MJTJU-2) is added for the oil–water separation, the IAA interfacial film would be broken. Based on the molecular interaction analysis, during the demulsification process, the oxygen of carboxyl group, ester group, PEO segment and hydroxyl in MJTJU-2 molecule would form stronger hydrogen bonds (35.038 kJ/mol, 32.357 kJ/mol, 30.612 kJ/mol, 29.360 kJ/mol) with hydrogen in water molecule, compared with those (18.936 kJ/mol, 9.427 kJ/mol, 5.467 kJ/mol) formed by heteroatoms (O, N, S) in IAA molecule and hydrogen in water molecule, respectively. The MJTJU-2 molecules also perform well in reducing the interactions between IAA and IAA, breaking some of the π-π stacking and the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the hydrogen will be reconstructed between demulsifier and water. Consequently, the MJTJU-2 demulsifier could break the IAA-stabilized W/O emulsions under the interaction of hydrogen bond reconstruction. These findings not only reveal the mechanisms on the stability and instability of IAA-stabilized oil–water emulsions, but also provide potential way for the demulsification of oil–water emulsions through the hydrogen bond reconstruction."
