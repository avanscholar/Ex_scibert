0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered a promising future clean energy carrier due to its potential applications in transportation and production of electricity and its low negative effect on the environment. However, in order to avoid CO2 emissions during hydrogen production processes, renewable resources should be used. Due to that fact biomass represents an attractive alternative for hydrogen production because it is considered renewable, available and carbon neutral, and as a combination of waste minimization and energy recovery (Cheng et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2014; Medrano et al., 2011; Trane et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, the combination of flash pyrolysis of biomass and steam reforming (SR) of bio-oil seems to be one of the most feasible hydrogen production route (Vagia and Lemonidou, 2008). The flash pyrolysis is conducted in an inert atmosphere at temperatures between 400 and 600°C with high heating and cooling rates (1000–10,000K/s) and low residence time in the reactor (1–2s). Liquid yields up to 75wt% can be achieved by a proper choice of operating conditions in the pyrolysis process (Trane et al., 2012). Bio-oils or pyrolysis liquids owe a higher volumetric energy than biomass. They are complex mixtures of high and low molecular weight, single and multifunctional hydrocarbons where acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ethers, furans, ketones, phenols and sugars can be found (Bridgwater, 2012; Imran et al., 2014; Makibar et al., 2015; Trane et al., 2012). Therefore, in order to gain further insights into bio-oils reforming processes, model compounds have been widely studied in steam reforming conditions, like acetic acid (Medrano et al., 2014; Nogueira et al., 2014; Trane et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014), ethanol (Garbarino et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Medrano et al., 2014), acetol (Medrano et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014, 2013), butanol (Bizkarra et al., 2015; Harju et al., 2015; Medrano et al., 2014) and phenol (Polychronopoulou et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014, 2013), among others. However, there are not many researches focused on the SR of other aromatic model compounds such as xylene (Sarıoğlan, 2012) or furfural (Wang et al., 2013), which are present in the bio-oil and may be responsible for a significant fraction of the carbon deposition (Trane-Restrup and Jensen, 2015). Moreover, studies about SR of model compounds mixtures are scarce to our knowledge. In this work, the steam reforming of m-xylene and a synthetic bio-oil, prepared as an equimolecular mixture of 1-butanol, m-xylene and furfural, were studied using alumina and modified alumina supported nickel based catalysts. All used catalysts were previously tested in 1-butanol SR and showed to be highly active (Bizkarra et al., 2015). The main SR reactions carried out in the present work are: (1) m-xylene SR C 8 H 10 + 8 H 2 O ↔ 8 CO + 13 H 2 Δ H 0 = 1031 kJ / mol (2) 1 -butanol SR C 4 H 10 O + 3 H 2 O ↔ 4 CO + 8 H 2 Δ H 0 = 558 kJ / mol (3) Furfural SR C 5 H 4 O 2 + 3 H 2 O ↔ 5 CO + 5 H 2 Δ H 0 = 322 kJ / mol (4) WGS CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 0 = - 41 kJ / mol At the same time, the thermal decomposition or cracking of unstable compounds competes with the SR reaction (Kechagiopoulos et al., 2009; Vagia and Lemonidou, 2007): (5) Cracking : C n H m O k → C X H Y O Z + gas ( H 2 ,CO, CO 2 , CH 4 … ) + C ( s ) However, carbon deposition can occur by other routes as the Boudouard reaction, CO and CH4 decomposition. Even more, ethane or other olefins may also lead to carbon deposition if they are formed as intermediates (Trane-Restrup and Jensen, 2015): (6) Boudouard : 2 CO ↔ C ( s ) + CO 2 (7) CO decomposition : CO + H 2 ↔ C ( s ) + H 2 O (8) CH 4 decomposition : CH 4 ↔ C ( s ) + 2 H 2 (9) Ethene polymerization : n C 2 H 4 → C ( s ) The above mentioned reactions lead not only to lower hydrogen yield, but it also causes severe catalyst deactivation by coking and it may also cause reactor blockage (Kechagiopoulos et al., 2009)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The preparation of the catalysts and their characterization before being used (N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, chemical composition, Temperature programmed reduction of the calcined catalysts and X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the reduced catalysts) are contained in our previous work (Bizkarra et al., 2015). For the present work catalysts were characterized after their use by several techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."
3,Activity measurements,"2.2 Activity measurements Reactor preparation was described in our previous work (Bizkarra et al., 2015) where a catalyst particle size lower than 10 times the internal diameter of the reactor was used to avoid bypassing near the reactor wall (García-García et al., 2015). Reactor was placed in a Microactivity Reference bench scale plant (PID Eng&Tech), with the same scheme as reported by García-García et al. (2015). Prior to the activity tests a mixture of 45mL of H2 and 180mL of N2 were passed through the catalytic bed at 800°C during 4h to obtain metallic nickel in the catalysts. Bio-oil model compound or the mixture of compounds and deionized water were fed separately to the reactor due to the immiscibility of the liquids. Reaction temperatures ranged from 800 to 600°C for four hours at each temperature and at atmospheric pressure. That temperature range was selected because, as predicted by thermodynamics, highest hydrogen yields are obtained within this interval (Trane-Restrup and Jensen, 2015). Afterwards, the reactor was heated up to 800°C to compare the initial and final activity results. A Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 21h−1 was used in all tests. Liquids products in the gas stream were separated by means of a partial condenser. Then gases and liquids were online and offline analyzed, respectively, using two gas chromatographs equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Gas and liquid flows and their compositions were hourly measured in order to analyze parameters such as: m-xylene conversion : X C 8 H 10 ( % ) = V C 8 H 10 in - V C 8 H 10 out ∗ 100 / V C 8 H 10 in Bio-oil conversion : X Bio-oil ( % ) = V but + xyl + fur in - V but + xyl + fur out ∗ 100 / V but + xyl + fur in Hydrogen yield : H 2 yield ( % ) = V H 2 out ∗ 100 / V H 2 out stoichiometric CO yield : Y CO ( % ) = V CO out ∗ 100 / V Carbon fed CO 2 yield : Y CO 2 ( % ) = V CO 2 out ∗ 100 / V Carbon fed CH 4 yield : Y CH 4 ( % ) = V CH 4 out ∗ 100 / V Carbon fed Hydrocarbon yield : Y HC ( % ) = V HC out ∗ 100 / V Carbon fed where Vi in and Vi out corresponds to the mole flow-rate of reactant i (mol/min). The term hydrocarbon refers to all carbon chain longer than methane. Experiments showed mainly ethane, ethene, propene, propane and butane. The same formulas were used to calculate the equilibrium values of the mentioned parameters. Product gas flows for different temperatures were calculated by means of AspenPlus® software."
4,Catalyst characterization,"XPS patterns of reduced and used catalysts were obtained using a SPECS (Berlin, Germany) system equipped with a Phoibos 150 1D-DLD analyzer and an Al Kα (1486.6eV) monochromatic radiation source. Initial elemental analysis was carried out and the subsequent detailed analysis were also made with an electrons output angle of 90°. XRD patterns were also collected using a PHILIPS X’PERT PRO automatic diffractometer operating at 40kV and 40mA, in theta–theta configuration, secondary monochromator with Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å) and a PIXcel solid state detector. Data were collected from a range of 2θ from 5° to 70° (step size=0.026 and time per step=625s) at room temperature. A fixed divergence and an antiscattering slit giving a constant volume of sample illumination were used. Used catalysts were characterized by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) in a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 thermogravimetric analyzer. Measurements were carried out using approximately 30mg of sample, which was heated from 30°C to 950°C with a heating ramp of 10°C/min using 100mL/min of synthetic air as oxidant."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Activity results,"4.1 Activity results 4.1.1 SR of mxylene at S/C=5.0 Complete conversion was obtained regardless of the reaction temperature and catalyst used when m-xylene SR was studied. However, the catalytic performance resulted in different hydrogen and carbon species yields, as summarized in Fig. 1 . Catalysts achieved similar hydrogen yields, around 80%, at 800°C, which are close to the equilibrium values, as happened with CO and CO2 yields. The presence of methane and some light hydrocarbons in the product stream can explain hydrogen yields lower than equilibrium. When reaction temperature was cooled down to 700°C, the difference between equilibrium and experimental hydrogen yields increased. This behavior was attributed both to the kinetic effect of a low temperature in the reaction rate and to the fact that the main reaction is highly endothermic. Accordingly, undesired reaction products yield, especially hydrocarbons, showed higher values than at 800°C, showing a slight reduction of the reforming capacities of the catalyst in the case of Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. In those conditions, Ni/Al2O3 catalysts showed a hydrogen yield slightly higher than the yield achieved at 800°C, as thermodynamic equilibrium predicts, due to its higher performance in the WGS reaction, probably due to the lower amount of coke present onto its surface (Table 1 ). On the other hand, tests with support modified catalysts resulted in hydrogen yields lower than the obtained at 800°C, indicating the reduction of reforming and WGS capacities. At 600°C, the reduction of catalysts capacity to carry out the WGS reaction was evident, as showed the high CO and low CO2 yields, despite the fact that WGS reaction should be thermodynamically favored. In addition, the presence of hydrocarbons in product gases became important, indicating catalysts started losing their hydrocarbon reforming capacities probably due to a slower kinetics, as a result of the lower temperature and promoted by the presence coke. In consequence, the measured hydrogen yields were low in comparison with previous reaction temperatures. Nevertheless, Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst was able to reform more hydrocarbons, as well as to produce more CO2, than any other catalyst. Therefore, it achieved the highest hydrogen yields during the reaction at 600°C. Activity tests were finished with a final reaction period at 800°C to compare initial and final activities of the catalysts, in order to determine if catalysts were or were not deactivated. Thus, there were not important differences between the initial and final activities, showing that catalysts were stable at the studied reaction conditions. 4.1.2 SR of a three model compound bio-oil mixture (m-xylene, 1-butanol and furfural) at S/C=5.0 A synthetic bio-oil was prepared as an equimolar mixture of m-xylene, 1-butanol and furfural with the aim of studying the combined effect of the different model compounds on the catalysts. An equimolecular mixture was prepared with the aim of having the same concentration of all model compounds in order to compare the reactivity of each kind of compound when they compete for active sites on the catalyst surface. The liquid flow fed to the reactor was adjusted to maintain constant the amount of moles going through the catalytic bed per unit of time as in the case of m-xylene SR. Fig. 2 shows the conversion and yields measured with different catalysts tested in the SR of the mixture. During the reaction at 800 and 700°C all catalysts converted completely the bio-oil. However, at 600°C conversion was drastically reduced. As in the case of m-xylene reforming, a low temperature results in a low reaction rate and some catalysts deactivation, probably due to the difficulty to remove the amount of coke formed at this temperature. As a result, catalysts were not able to completely break the organic structure of the model compounds, as indicated by the unreacted 1-butanol, mxylene and furfural collected as liquid products. Catalysts deactivation was confirmed when the reaction temperature was set up again at 800°C. There initial complete conversions were not reached, although conversions were higher than at 600°C. Among the fed model compounds, m-xylene showed to be the more stable, and then the most refractory to reforming, as it was the main component of the liquid product when complete conversion was not achieved. Regarding the hydrogen yields, at the two highest reaction temperatures, high hydrogen yields were measured, as equilibrium calculation predicted. Nevertheless, at 700°C hydrogen yields were lower than at 800°C, mainly due to the presence of hydrocarbons at 700°C and a lower WGS reaction performance of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. That behavior could be explained by the oxygen storage and mobility provided by ceria lattice (Mamontov et al., 2000), which increases active oxygen species on the nickel surface favoring the hydrogen production and inhibiting coke formation by means of an enhanced water adsorption and effective gasification (Fu et al., 2014). At 600°C, conversions were very low, and in consequence, product yields were also low. Accordingly, the maximum hydrogen yield was around 20% for Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst which produced some CO and CO2, again due to the oxygen storage and mobility capacity. On the contrary, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts showed low hydrogen yields. Among them, bare alumina supported catalyst achieved the lowest conversion at 600°C and the lowest carbon species yields (CO, CO2, CH4 and hydrocarbons). The catalysts with the support modified with La2O3 converted a higher amount of model compounds than alumina supported catalyst, as hydrocarbon yields show. But, it was not able to convert them to reforming products as Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst did. Then, when the reaction temperature was increased to the initial conditions (800°C), hydrogen yields not only did not achieve initial values, but they remained as low as the ones at 600°C. Then, the main bio-oil conversion route could be assigned as cracking due to the high hydrocarbon yields corroborated. In these conditions, CeO2 containing catalyst was the only one achieving a hydrogen yield higher than the one obtained at 600°C. This increase was probably originated by a higher bio-oil reforming ability, as CO and CO2 yields show. Regarding Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts, they also increased their CO yield with the temperature increase. But their CO2 yield was even lower than at 600°C. According to these results, Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst showed to be the most effective catalyst for bio-oil SR among the studied catalysts. Its oxygen storage and mobility capacity showed to be important during the reforming of oxygenated bio-oil model compounds (as it was not evident in m-xylene SR), even though it was also deactivated."
7,Used catalysts characterization,"4.2 Used catalysts characterization The comparison of the XRD patterns of reduced and used catalysts showed different peaks depending on the process. Catalysts tested with m-xylene showed metallic nickel peaks (2θ =44° and 52°), as happens in the reduced counterparts. The use of the equation of Scherrer indicated that the lowest nickel crystal size was estimated for Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, around 30nm. Nickel peaks for the catalysts used with the mixture of model compounds were too low to estimate the crystal size. That fact was related to the presence of a carbon peak (2θ ≈26.6°) in the patterns of the catalysts tested with the mixture of model compounds (Natarajan et al., 2015; Światowska et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015). Accordingly, XPS patterns of catalysts tested in m-xylene SR showed the same nickel species that were identified in reduced catalysts, such as metallic nickel (∼856eV) and nickel aluminate (∼855eV) and the corresponding satellite peak (∼861eV). Apart from that, an important amount of carbon on all catalysts surface was also recorded. However, nickel was not detected on the surface of the catalysts tested with the mixture because they were almost completely covered by carbon deposits. XPS patterns also showed that regardless of the fed bio-oil, the main carbon species present in the catalysts surface are the same for all catalysts, being the most abundant the graphitic carbon (284.6eV) (Bizkarra et al., 2015; García-García et al., 2015). TGA patterns of used catalysts (Fig. 3 ) showed two main weight losses looking at the derivative (d(wt%)/dT). Below 350°C there are small weight losses or increases, which are more evident for catalysts a, b and c. Losses ranging up to around 200°C were attributed to water and organic compounds removal from the catalysts(Roy and Leclerc, 2015). Then, around 300°C, except case b, catalysts showed a weight increment due to the oxidation of nickel (Tanksale et al., 2008). According with these results, metallic nickel was present in deactivated catalysts, and therefore, when the multicomponent bio-oil was fed the main deactivation cause was carbon deposition, which covered nickel active sites. Above 350°C only weight loss took place, which is related with the oxidation of carbon (Iriondo et al., 2010). Between 350 and 500°C the oxidation of filamentous carbon occurs, while at temperatures above 500°C the oxidation of carbon with different degrees of graphitization takes place (Iriondo et al., 2012, 2010). The weight losses of the catalysts tested in m-xylene SR ended at temperatures lower than 800°C. On the contrary, the samples tested with the bio-oil showed weight losses up to 900°C, approximately. In addition, the weight losses at temperatures below 500°C for the catalysts tested in the mixture were less important than for the catalysts tested with m-xylene. Thus, during the tests with the mixture a higher amount of graphitic carbon was formed, justifying the deactivation of the catalysts. Moreover, as the graphitic carbon needed higher temperatures than the last reaction temperature (800°C) to be gasified, catalysts were not able to recover their initial activities. Taking into account the weight losses related to carbon oxidation, carbon grams per gram of catalyst were calculated and summarized in Table 1. There, it can be observed that carbon amounts on the catalysts are approximately doubled when the mixture was tested, even though the carbon amount fed to the reactor was approximately the same. The main cause of the increment in the carbon amount present in the catalysts was identified as the presence of furfural in the mixture. This compound, which is usually present in bio-oils, is known to be a very reactive molecule with a high tendency to produce coke in reforming processes (Remón et al., 2015). This statement was reinforced by the catalytic behavior of the same catalysts in 1-butanol and m-xylene SR processes, where deactivation was not significant."
8,Conclusions,"Despite different catalytic behavior observed during activity tests with different bio-oil model compounds, the high hydrogen yields at 700 and 800°C evidenced that bio-oils can be feasible feedstocks for hydrogen production. The less favorable reaction temperature was 600°C, especially for the synthetic bio-oil where carbon deposition deactivated the catalysts. It has been proved that oxygenated compounds promoted coke deposition, although a non-oxygenated compound was present (m-xylene 33mol%, considered a solvent). Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 showed to be the most adequate catalyst, Ce addition maintained an acceptable hydrogen yield, even when catalyst surface was covered by a considerable amount of graphitic carbon."
