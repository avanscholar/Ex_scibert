0,Introduction,"The steadily rising demand of hydrogen for both chemical and petrochemical use as clean fuel and an energy vector has recently prompted great scientific and technological interest in exploiting new hydrogen manufacturing methodologies. In particular, such attention has addressed: (i) the optimization of current H2 production processes; (ii) the discovery of more efficient technologies with reduced environmental impact; (iii) the use of alternative feedstocks like biomass, heavy oil residues, and RDF (Refused-Derived-Fuels). If attention is focused on the use of hydrogen as clean fuel to produce energy in fuel cell systems, the development of an efficient catalytic process for the production of “CO x -free” H2 is important in order to overcome hurdles associated with the use of a conventional multi-step process. In this context, the catalytic decomposition of natural gas (CDNG) into hydrogen and carbon is attracting much research interest since it appears to be a direct, mildly endothermic, attractive way of producing high purity hydrogen with reduced CO2 emissions [1]. Relevant efforts have recently been devoted for evaluating the catalytic features of supported transition metals in CDNG reaction [2–9]. In particular, investigations have addressed Ni, Co, Fe, Rh and Pd based systems that proved to be the most active among the different catalysts studied [2–7]. Recently, studies carried out using bimetallic systems such as Ni–Cu, Ni–Mo, Fe–Co and Co–Mo [8,9] demonstrated that the appropriated promoter can significantly enhance the performance of metal supported catalysts both in terms of specific activity, hydrogen productivity, and catalyst stability. Ni supported catalysts have been investigated extensively since Ni is extremely active at moderate reaction temperatures (773–873K) [2–4,7,8,10]. The influence of support [3], preparation method [2–4], activation treatment, surface properties, and the addition of promoters on the performance of Ni catalysts has been already highlighted. SiO2 appears to be the most suitable support since it acts as an efficient textural promoter [5,8] while preparation methods do not seem to play a significant role in catalytic efficiency [2–4,7,8,10]. In the CDNG process, particular attention should also be given to the typology and extent of carbon formed during reaction since this phenomenon is the most important parameter to be considered in catalyst and reactor designs. In addition, when the carbon formed is a type of nanofiber recovery of such compounds, recently proposed as efficient, functional materials, should also be taken into consideration [6,10–12]. In this context, this paper aims to outline the features and potential of a new structured multilayer reactor (MLR) housing thin layer catalysts for CDNG reaction. Attention was devoted to evaluating reactor performance in CDNG with a view to designing a new reactor that would operate without a pressure drop resulting from coke formation or hotspot phenomena during the oxidative regeneration step."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni thin layer catalysts (Ni-TLCs),"2.1 Preparation of Ni thin layer catalysts (Ni-TLCs) A commercial silica fabric (OmniSil OS 120, Thermal Material Systems (TMS) product; thickness, 0.15mm; specific weight, 120gm−2) was washcoated with a colloidal SiO2 solution (Ludox LS, Aldrich product; SABET, 215m2 g−1) in order to attain a carrier with an adequate surface area; the SiO2/silica-cloth support was then dried at 393K for 12h. The dipping procedure was optimized in order to obtain at the end of the washcoating a substrate containing about 35% coated SiO2. Ni-TLC samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the SiO2/silica cloth support, shaped in circular form (Φ, 37mm), with a 0.1-M solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 393K for 12h and further calcined in air at 873K for 3h. A series of Ni-TLC samples with Ni loadings ranging from 5 to 50wt%, referring to the weight of the coated SiO2, was prepared. The list of Ni-TLC samples along with Ni loading, Ni dispersion (D Ni), metal surface area (MSA), and average Ni particle size (d s) values is reported in Table 1 ."
3,Catalyst testing,"2.2 Catalyst testing The MLR used to perform CDNG tests is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . It consists of a quartz tube (Φ int, 39mm; length, 600mm) at the ends of which is a metal disc sealed by an O-ring to the quartz tube. Six discs of TLC samples were sandwiched between quartz “spacers” (Φ ext, 37mm; thickness, 4mm) and packed into the reactor. Experiments were carried out at 773, 823 and 873K, with atmospheric pressure and GHSV ranging from 1900 to 9500h−1 using a 10% CH4/5% N2/85% Ar (v/v) reaction mixture flowing in the range of 125 to 625 stp mL/min. The reaction stream was analyzed on-line by an Agilent 3000A micro-GC equipped with two columns (molecular sieve 5Å: film thickness, 12μm; Ф in, 320μm; l, 10m; and OV-1: film thickness, 1.2μm; Φ in, 150μm; l, 8m) and two TC detectors. Prior to each run TLC samples were reduced “in situ” at 773K for 1h in H2 flow (150 stp mL/min). The catalytic behaviour of Ni-TLC samples was evaluated in terms of CH4 conversion, carbon capacity (C/Ni, number of CH4 molecules converted per Ni atom until complete catalyst deactivation) H2 productivity, and ST Y H 2 ( d m H 2 3 g Ni − 1 h − 1 ) ."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Ni loading was determined by the AAS technique using a Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 200 spectrometer equipped with an Ni (λ, 232.0nm) lamp. Surface area (SABET) was determined using a fully automated ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics Instrument) gas adsorption device. Before analysis, all the samples were outgassed at 423K under vacuum for 2h. From isotherms determined according to the BET method, surface area was calculated. Metal dispersion (D) of “fresh” catalysts was evaluated by H2 uptake obtained from H2-TPD measurements in the range of 193–923K after the reduction of samples at 773K for 1h, assuming the chemisorption stoichiometry H/Nisurf of 1/1 [11]; the surface average Ni particle size ( d H 2 - TPD ) was evaluated on the basis of the following equation assuming a spherical shape of the metal particle [11]: d H 2 - TPD ( nm ) = 101 D ( % ) Particle size distribution of “fresh” and “used” catalysts was also evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis using a PHILIPS CM12 instrument with a high resolution (HR) camera for the acquisition and elaboration of TEM images. Specimens were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the catalyst samples in isopropyl alcohol, depositing a drop of suspension on carbon-supported films. The average surface Ni particle size (d TEM) of fresh and used catalysts was calculated by the following statistical formula: d TEM = ∑ n i d i 3 ∑ n i d i 2 where n i and d i are the number and the diameter of particles, respectively. The coke structure was evaluated by TEM analysis of “spent” catalysts. The amount of coke on the “spent” catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analysis (Carlo Erba Instrument CHNS-O EA1108) and TGA/DSC (Netzsch STA 409 C analyzer) measurements while TLC morphology was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis using a PHILIPS FEG XL-30 instrument. SEM micrographs were taken after coating of the TLC samples by gold-sputtering."
5,Features of structured multilayer reactor,"Conventional packed bed reactors are generally characterized by pronounced axial and radial temperature profiles with “cold” or “hot” spots at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic bed. As is well known, temperature control in catalytic reaction is a crucial aspect for high temperatures may damage the catalyst or promote side-reactions while low temperatures negatively affect both the reaction kinetic and the performance of the catalyst. The proposed MLR proposed, housing thin layer catalysts was designed to operate with a negligible drop in pressure throughout the catalytic bed. Furthermore, Reynold's numbers lower than 0.001, calculated according to the well known equation, R = ρ VD/μ, were found, confirming that MLR here proposed operates in laminar flow regime also. Such peculiarities should result, fundamentally, in the development of either an efficient catalytic process based on reaction-regeneration cycles or the development of a single step process to obtain pure hydrogen by the continuous removal of coke formed during reaction. In the first case, the main advantages of using MLR are in the regeneration of catalysts in an oxidizing atmosphere and in avoiding the onset of hot-spot phenomena detrimental to the catalyst: this is possible since heat produced during the combustion step is more efficiently removed in an MLR, consisting of a series of spaced single thin layer catalysts, compared to that of a compact catalytic bed. In the second case, one might speculate that using an MLR, a process for H2 production by catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon based on the continuous separation of coke formed during reaction, could be developed. In fact, in the event that the coke formed during reaction is not strongly bonded to the catalyst surface, employing a device to allow the continuous detachment of such carbon (for example, by the use of micro-waves or mechanical shaking) from the catalyst surface without catalyst deactivation might be feasible."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Textural properties of Ni-TLC samples,"4.1 Textural properties of Ni-TLC samples Textural properties of Ni-TLC catalysts result from both the intrinsic properties of the silica cloth used as carrier and the preparation procedure involving the washcoating of the silica cloth and the subsequent impregnation with precursor solution of the Ni active phase. The evolution of such textural properties from the bare silica cloth to the sample containing Ni was accomplished by SEM analysis. In Fig. 2 , the SEM images of the bare silica cloth (A, 100×), SiO2/silica cloth support (B, 100×) and 5%Ni/SiO2/silica cloth, N1-TLC, (C and D, 600–1000×) are presented. The bare silica cloth (Fig. 2A) consists of huge amounts of small fibres (ca. 10μm) grouped into large fibre aggregates of ca. 0.5mm in diameter. After the washcoating with colloidal silica, the fibres appear stuck to each other by a rather irregular overlayer of silica (Fig. 2B). The thin layer of silica deposited on the fibres is probably due to the high concentration (30wt%) of the colloidal silica solution used for the preparation of the TLC support. The high magnification image of the N1-TLC sample (Fig. 2D) shows that NiO is randomly distributed on the TLC surface. Furthermore, it is clear that larger particles comprised of several NiO particles 8nm in size, group together to form NiO clusters of different sizes (20–40nm) and shapes."
8,Evolution of catalyst coking in the MLR,"4.2 Evolution of catalyst coking in the MLR In order to evaluate reactor behaviour, preliminary experiments were performed by recording the axial temperature profile and the amount of coke deposited on single TLC samples as a function of reaction time. As shown in Fig. 3 , reaction take places under quasi-isothermal conditions, and the amount of coke deposited on each single TLC sample strongly depends upon reaction time (see the comparison of results in Fig. 3A and B). This is due to the fact that on the single TLC sample, as methane is progressively converted, coke accumulates on the catalyst surface until there is full deactivation of TLC. As the reaction proceeds, all TLCs deactivate and at the end of experiment, the amount of coke accumulated on each TLC is similar (see Fig. 3B). It is interesting that in spite of the huge amount of coke formed on each single TLC, any pressure drop phenomenon observed was due to the high gas permeability of the TLC. This is a peculiar feature of the MLR which, to further ensure the possibility of operating with a high catalyst utilization factor (employing thin layer catalyst), overcomes the typical technological problems of conventional reactors affected by intra-particle coke accumulation which, in turn, normally leads to the reactor blocking [4,10,12]."
9,Catalytic performance and coking features of Ni-TLC samples,"4.3 Catalytic performance and coking features of Ni-TLC samples Data obtained under different experimental conditions (T R and GHSV) are summarized in Table 2 in terms of initial CH4 conversion (t 0, 0.5h), carbon capacity (Cat/Niat), and H2 productivity ( s t p d m H 2 3 H 2 / g Ni h ) . As expected, the initial methane conversion increases with T R, while carbon capacity follows the opposite trend. In terms of H2 productivity (STY), results reveal that catalyst behaviour changes significantly with T R and that an optimal T R exists at which H2 productivity is maximized (T R, 823K). Regarding the influence of GHSV on catalyst behaviour, it is interesting to note that in spite of a significant increa of GHSV (from 1900 to 9500h−1), only a modest initial methane conversion decrease was observed (from 35.2 to 17.0mol%). On the contrary, carbon capacity declined significantly to a very low value (Cat/Niat, 3.7) at GHSV close to 9500h−1. Experimental data on CH4 conversion vs time on stream (Fig. 4 ) clearly demonstrate that reaction temperature plays a crucial role both in catalyst activity and stability. In fact, as reaction temperature rises from 773 to 873K, a general increase in the initial CH4 conversion along with a general decrease in catalyst lifetime from ca. 13.6h (773K) to 0.5h (873K) was observed. These results lead to the conclusion that reaction temperatures higher than 823K are inadequate for methane decomposition on Ni based catalysts due to the occurrence of severe deactivation phenomena, caused mainly by Ni sintering and coke formation as discussed below [9,13–17]. Experimental data on the influence of Ni loading on catalyst performance, shown in Fig. 5 , indicate that an optimum Ni loading, ensuring maximum hydrogen productivity exists. Indeed, a typical volcano shape trend with a maximum in STY for a Ni loading of ca. 20–25wt%, irrespective of the reaction temperature used, was obtained. Similar results have been reported [8,17] in that Ni particle size distribution plays a crucial role in the kinetic of coke formation [5,13,15]. As postulated by several authors [5,13,15–21], methane decomposes on the exposed metal particle surface into hydrogen and elementary carbon, which tends to diffuse through the metal particle. As is well known, the solubility of carbon in the metal particle depends upon several factors. In fact, to further consider the influence of reaction temperature, carbon diffusion through the Ni particle depends upon (i) thickness of particle (length for effective carbon diffusion); (ii) metal surface area; (iii) concentration of carbon in metal at the gas side; (iv) concentration of carbon at the back side of the metal particle [19–21]. Therefore, one can deduce that carbon formation is straight, depending on the driving force controlling the carbon diffusion process. At a steady state, that the coking rate equals the rate of carbon diffusion through the metal particle can be assumed. Some authors [22,9,23–26] have found that Ni catalysts characterized by Ni particles >60nm in size feature the longest catalytic life for methane decomposition on Ni/SiO2 system since these particles work at a high carbon diffusion rate, which promotes the formation of filamentous carbon. Even if in our case the best result was obtained on the N3-TLC catalyst, characterized by an average particle size of ca. 14nm, we can infer that both small (<10nm) and large (>50nm) Ni particles cannot achieve methane decomposition reaction since such particles are affected by drastic deactivation phenomena. Very probably, on small Ni particles, the increased saturation concentration of carbon, which leads to a low driving force for carbon diffusion, causes a lowering of the carbon diffusion rate. As such, carbon remains on the Ni surface, polymerises, and encapsulates the particle, which drastically deactivates [22] whereas for large Ni particles, the surface carbon formation rate is higher than the carbon diffusion rate so coke accumulates on the metal surface blocking the Ni active sites. That carbon diffusion is also limited by stronger metal-support interaction between small Ni particles and the carrier should be taken into account as it hinders carbon precipitation on the back side of Ni and, subsequently, growth of the filament [19,20]. Information regarding both the coke formation mechanism and structural changes of the catalyst during the reaction was gathered from TEM images of “used” N3-TLC samples, shown in Fig. 6 . The formation of carbon filaments is prevalent at 773K (Fig. 6A) while at 873K the “encapsulating” carbon prevails with a concomitant rise in marked sintering phenomena, which causes enlargement of the Ni particle up to 300nm (Fig. 6C). At intermediate reaction temperature (823K), both “filamentous” and “encapsulating” carbon formed while metal sintering phenomena is much less evident (Fig. 6B). These results confirm what was inferred regarding the crucial role reaction temperature plays on carbon diffusion through the Ni particle and subsequently on the evolution of carbon formation. In Fig. 7 , the trend of methane conversion as a function of time on stream (t.o.s.) using the N3-TLC catalyst at 773K and GHSV ranging from 1900 to 9500h−1 is shown. As expected, the higher the GHSV, the lower the initial methane conversion level (methane conversion decreases from 35.2% at 1908h−1 to 17.0% at 9540h−1) while the catalyst deactivation rate significantly increases as GHSV increases. These findings clearly indicate that GHSV also affects carbon formation mechanism. To shed light on this result, TEM analyses of catalyst used at different GHSVs were done. The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate that both evolution of the coke formation mechanism and morphological and structural changes of the catalyst depend on the GHSV used. In particular, we can infer that as GHSV increases, the formation of “encapsulating” carbon tends to prevail. If the gradient of carbon concentration is one of the main driving forces controlling the process of carbon diffusion through the Ni particle, then by operating at high GHSV, the concentration of carbon on the Ni surface remains low since the CH4 conversion level is low; in such a case, the carbon tends to aggregate on the Ni surface, thus encapsulating the metal particle. In order to shed more light on the factors affecting both catalyst activity and stability, some useful information addressing the influence of CH4 conversion at different GHSVs on STY and carbon capacity was gathered. These trends refer to the normalized functions of STY and carbon capacity defined by the following equations: (1) G STY = ST Y i − ST Y L ST Y H − ST Y L (2) G C / Ni = C / N i i − C / N i L ST Y H − ST Y L (3) G C H 4 = C H 4 i − C H 4 L C H 4 H − C H 4 L where the suffixes indicate i, the i-esimo value; L, the lower value; and H, the higher value obtained in the GHSV range investigated. As shown in Fig. 9 , both STY and carbon capacity are related to the extent of methane conversion according to both a direct and inverse straight-line relationship, respectively. Indeed, low CH4 conversion values ensure the highest STY, which leads however, to the formation of encapsulating carbon implying a steep loss of activity in spite of a low Cat/Niat value. On the other hand, at high methane conversion levels (low GHSV), the low hydrogen productivity is counterbalanced by a high resistance to deactivation, due to the formation of “filamentous” carbon with Ni particles at the tips which, as is well known, continue to be catalytically active if the Ni surface remains accessible to reactant (CH4)."
10,Conclusions,"The performance of a structured MLR and a series of differently loaded Ni/SiO2/silica cloth thin layer catalysts (Ni-TLCs) in the CDNG reaction for making “CO x -free” H2 in the T R range 773–873K was assessed. A volcano-shape relationship between hydrogen productivity (STY) and Ni loading with a maximum range of 20–25wt% was found. Activity decay, catalyst lifetime, and H2 yield depend on reaction temperature, Ni loading, Ni particle size, and GHSV. The carbon growth mechanism is affected both by reaction temperature and GHSV. At low reaction temperatures and low GHSV, the formation of “filamentous” carbon is prevalent while as reaction temperature and GHSV increase, the formation of “encapsulating” carbon results in a steep decay in activity. A change in the mechanism of carbon deposition implies an inverse relationship between hydrogen productivity and the carbon capacity of the catalyst. Results show the new MLR used to perform experiments is a suitable tool for investigating the CDNG under a quasi-isothermal regime without any pressure drop. The use of such a tool could offer new perspectives on the development of an efficient innovative catalytic process to produce a “CO x -free” hydrogen stream for feeding fuel cell systems."
