0,Introduction,"The development of economic activity and consequent population increase can lead to several environmental problems, especially those related to the accumulation of anthropic wastes. Besides being economically advantageous, the production of biofuels using these wastes can be considered an environmentally friendly approach, due to the possibility of combining the production of energy with the reuse of several agro-industrial wastes, minimizing the environmental impacts of its inadequate disposal. Biofuels can be produced through thermochemical or biochemical reactions, generating by-products such as ethanol, methanol, butanol, biogas, among others, which can be used through the energy released in its direct combustion or for electric energy production [1,2]. Biogas utilization can be indicated to replace oil-based fuels [3]. Its production has been studied from several types of substrates, including wastewater and also solid wastes, such as food waste [4], sugarcane bagasse [5–8], banana waste [9], coffee processing wastes [10], and citrus peel waste [11–14]. Among the emerging energy sources, methane gas, the simplest hydrocarbon and main component of biogas, has been widely studied, since it can produce more heat per unit mass (55.7 kJ g−1) when compared to other hydrocarbons, in addition to producing less carbon dioxide as a by-product. Thus, methane gas can be used to produce electric energy by burning it in gas turbines or steam boilers, in addition to its use in the form of compressed natural gas as fuel in vehicles has also gained attention [15–17]. Besides methane, hydrogen can also be obtained by means of anaerobic digestion. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, comprising approximately three quarters of all matter, with the Earth's surface containing about 0.14% of this element in gaseous form (H2). Since the main product of H2 combustion is water with high energy efficiency (122 kJ g−1), it can be also considered as a non-polluting and promising fuel as an alternative to the use of fossil fuels [18–20]. Although it is not considered a primary energy source, H2 can be used in the storage and transmission of the energy generated in nuclear or solar energy systems, besides other applications none related to fuels. H2 can be produced not only from fossil fuels, but also from residual biomass through electrolysis, photolysis, thermochemical or biological processes [18,21]. Since the use of non-residual organic raw material is still not recommended due to its economic disadvantages [13], one of the most suitable alternatives for the biofuel production in biological processes is using organic wastes, such as agro-industrial wastes from food processing [22]. The orange (Citrus sinensis L.) is one of the most cultivated fruits, and associated with the production of several products, such as jellies, essential oil, orange blossom honey, among others [23], however, its main destination is juice production, comprising 70% of the total of 88 million tons per year [12,24]. After processing, between 50 and 60% of the fruit volume produced becomes waste, including its peels, bagasse, seeds and membranes. The most common destination of citrus peel waste (CPW) is its use as raw material for the manufacture of livestock feed, composting or incineration of the excess waste [23]. There is a high amount of carbohydrates in the composition of these residues, therefore, they are considered as a potential carbon source for the production of biogas and bioethanol [25]. Camargo et al. [14] evaluated the H2 production using untreated CPW in batch reactors operated at mesophilic conditions (37 °C) and pH adjusted to 7.0, obtaining 13.31 mmol L−1, besides 4355 mg L−1 of acetic acid and predominance of Clostridium and Ruminiclostridium genera. The aforementioned authors did not detect methane production under these conditions. Torquato et al. [26] obtained similar H2 values from citrus vinasse (13.4 mmol L−1) as the only substrate in batch reactors operated at 37 °C. Forgàcs et al. [11] obtained a maximum production of 247.7 mmolCH4. L−1 using CPW treated by steam explosion using sludge from a reactor of biogas production plant as inoculum. In the same way, Calabrò et al. [12] evaluated the application of several inocula for methane production from CPW, such as activated sludge, industrial and agro-industrial wastes, obtaining the best results (33 mmolCH4. L−1) in batch reactors operated in mesophilic conditions. Besides the possibility of obtaining H2 and CH4 using CPW as substrate [11–13], its application in two stage systems is still not well documented. It is known that two stage systems have some advantages, since it enables the separation of acidogenic and methanogenic phases, minimizing problems that usually occur in single-phase systems, mostly related to the microbial adaptation phase and acidification [27]. Cremonez et al. [27] evaluated a semi-continuous two-phase anaerobic digestion process of cassava starch-based polymer, concluding that this system presented technical feasibility, with high hydrogen (26.69 mmol L−1) and methane (528.2 mmol L−1) production when using concentrations of 10 g L−1 of substrate and hydraulic retention time of 5 and 20 days, respectively. Braga et al. [28] evaluated the biomass involved in H2 (Stage I) and CH4 (Stage II) production in batch reactors, in which Stage I was fed with sugarcane bagasse and Stage II was fed with the acidified effluent generated in Stage I. Using the massive sequencing of the RNAr 16S gene, the predominance of cellulose-producing genera was observed in Stage I, such as Clostridium and Enterococcus, while in Phase II, Methanoregulaceae and Methanosaetaceae methanogenic archaea families were identified. Although studies on the microbial community involved in the anaerobic digestion process is essential to understand the behavior of anaerobic reactors under different operating conditions, as well as how they affect the predominant metabolic pathways and consequently the metabolites obtained, most of the studies are still based only on physical-chemical data [29,30]. However, it is essential to reconcile physicochemical and biological data to better understand anaerobic reactors, in order to increase its efficiency and to adjust the optimal operational conditions for each stage. This study aimed at evaluating H2 and CH4 production using CPW as substrate in batch reactors operated at mesophilic conditions (30 °C) in two stages, where Stage I is applied to the CPW fermentation, and Stage II is applied to the CH4 recovery using the acidified effluent obtained from Stage I. Additionally, the metataxonomic and metabolic potential were inferred using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on Illumina HiSeq platform and Piphillin tool."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrate,"2.1 Substrate CPW (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck, var. Pera-Rio) used as substrate was obtained and processed in order to obtain residue similar to that of industrial plants, as described in Camargo et al. [14] and Calabrò et al. [12]. Juice and seeds of fresh oranges were removed and then peels and bagasses were separated and dehydrated at 50 °C for 24 h. The dried CPW was ground in a Wiley knife mill (TE-650/1) into particles ≤1 mm and stored in polyethylene plastic bottles at 4 °C. The CPW physicochemical characterization in relation to the composition of macro and micronutrients is described in Camargo et al. [14]."
3,Inoculum,"2.2 Inoculum The allochthonous source of microorganisms used was UASB reactor sludge applied to the thermophilic treatment of sugarcane vinasse, which was operated by Usina São Martinho, located in the city of Pradópolis (São Paulo, Brazil), freshly collected and stored at 4 °C until use. The granules were blended for 30 s before its use. In addition, an autochthonous inoculum was used in Stage I, which was obtained through the autofermentation of 20 g L−1 of untreated CPW (1:1 of peels and bagasse, in particles ≤1 mm) in 500 mL Duhran® flasks, with 250 mL reaction volume (Peptone Cellulose Solution- PCS nutritional medium, 5% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 5% CaCO3 and 5% NaCl) at pH adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH solutions [31]. The flasks were flushed with N2 (100%), closed with a butyl cap and incubated at 30 °C under static conditions for approximately 120 h. In Stage I, a mix of 2.25 g of Total Volatile Solids (TVS) per liter and 3 gTVS.L−1 of autochthonous and allochthonous inoculum was used, while in Stage II only 3 gTVS.L−1 of allochthonous inoculum was used. The mix of autochthonous and allochthonous inoculum was standardized as recommended in a previous study, where the authors find out that these were the best proportions in fermentative processes using CPW [32]."
4,Batch assays,"2.3 Batch assays The assays were separated into two main stages, in order to apply the optimal conditions for each one in accordance with that described in the literature. In Stage I, the same conditions pointed out by Camargo et al. [32] for higher maximum H2 production potential and VFA production were applied in 250 mL Duhran® flasks, with 15 g L−1 of CPW, a mix of 2.25 gTVS.L−1 and 3 gTVS.L−1 of autochthonous and allochthonous inoculum, 5 g L−1 of NaCl, 40% of headspace (N2 -100%) and pH adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH or HCl 1 M. All the batch reactors were operated in triplicates and at 30 °C under static conditions. In Stage II, the acidified effluent (liquid fraction, filtered in ≤0.1 mm membrane, which was the solid fraction discarded in order to prevent methanogenesis inhibition due to the high concentration of polysaccharides) obtained after fermentation in Stage I was used as substrate in 250 mL Duhran® flasks with 50% of headspace. The acidified effluent, was supplemented with Zinder medium [33] (NH4Cl 0.5 g L−1, KH3PO4 0.4 g L−1, MgCl2.6H2O 0.1 g L−1, CaCl2.2H2O 0.05 g L−1, NaHCO3 2 g L−1, yeast extract 2 g L−1, vitamin solution 10 mL L−1 and trace metals solution 10 mL L−1). The vitamin solution consisted of biotin (0.002 g L−1), folic acid (0.002 g L−1), pyridoxine HCl (0.010 g L−1), thiamine HCl.2H2O (0.005 g L−1), (0.005 g L−1), nicotinic acid (0.005 g L−1), calcium d-pantothenate (0.005 g L−1), vitamin B12 (0.0001 g L−1), p-aminobenzoic acid (0.005 g L−1) and lipoic acid (0.005 g L−1). The trace metals solution was composed of nitrilotriacetic acid (4.5 g L−1), FeSO4.7H2O (0.5 g L−1), MnSO4.H2O (0.08 g L−1), CoCl2.6H2O (0.17 g L−1), ZnSO4.7H2O (0.21 g L−1), H3BO3 (0.19 g L−1), NiCl2 (0.02 g L−1) and Na2MoO4.2H2O (0.1 g L−1). All the batch reactors were flushed with N2/CO2 (70%/30%) and operated in triplicates and at 30 °C under static conditions."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu), propionic acid (HPr) and ethanol (EtOH) were determined in a Shimadzu® (GC-2010) gas chromatograph according to Adorno et al. [34], Total Solids (TS) and Total Volatile Solids (TVS) were determined according to the APHA 2540B and 2540E methods, respectively [35]. In addition, total carbohydrates [36], phenols [35,37], limonene [38] and lactic acid (Hlac) were quantified [39]. The elements Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, K, Na and Zn, as well as total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the raw CPW were determined according to the method EPA 6010 D-3051 [40]. Lignin content was determined according to Sluiter et al. [41]. The hydrogen and methane content were analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu® GC-2010), equipped with thermal conductivity detector and Carboxen 1010 PLOT column (30 m × 0.53 mm), with the injector at 220 °C, oven at 130 °C and detector temperature set at 230 °C. The carrier gas was argon, and the column flow and make-up volume were 5.66 mL min−1 and 12 mL min−1, respectively [38]. The batch assays were carried out in 500 mL Duhran® flasks, with 50% headspace, at N2/CO2 atmosphere (70/30%), closed with butyl cap and plastic thread. Biogas samples from the headspace were collected periodically (every 2 h) through the butyl cap using a manual gas-tight syringe, until the biogas (H2 and/or CH4) production was stabilized in the stationary phase."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis The modified Gompertz model [42] was applied in the results to obtain the parameters maximum H2 production rate (Rm), start time of H2 production ( λ ) and maximum H2 production potential (P). The parameters were calculated using the software OriginPro 9.0 (Equation (1)). (1) P a c = P . exp { − exp ( R m . e P [ λ − t ] + 1 ) } where, Pac = cumulative H2/CH4 production, Rm = maximum H2/CH4 production rate (mmol.h−1), e = Euler number (2,71,828,182) λ = start time of H2/CH4 production (h), P = maximum H2/CH4 production potential (mmol.L−1)."
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis Biomass samples were collected at the end of operational time in each assay (Stage I and Stage II) and washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution (NaCl 8%, KCl 0.2%, Na2HPO4 1.44%, KH2PO4 0.24%) [43]. The micromorphological characteristics were observed in fresh 2% agar slides using an Olympus BX60 optical microscope coupled to a camera (Olympus cellSens Dimension software). The FastDNA® SPIN kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals™) was used in order to extract the total DNA, which was posteriorly quantified (ng.μL−1) in a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific®) of 1.80–2.00 (260/280 nm) ratio. The sequencing was carried out at GenOne Biotechnology Solutions (Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brazil) (http://genone.com.br/) by means of high throughput amplicon sequencing of the V3–V4 regions from the16S rRNA gene, on an Illumina HiSeq PE250 platform, with 2 × 250 bp cycles, 100k reads per sample and using primers 341F (5′ CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3′) [44,45]. Bioinformatic primary treatment was done by GenOne Biotechnology Solutions using QIIME (V1.7.0) framework [46]. The clustering was done at 97% identity, using Uparse (v7.0.1001) [47] and taxonomic assignment was performed with Mothur software against the SSUrRNA database of SILVA (http://www.arb-silva.de/) [48], using a 80% threshold. The sequences were deposited at NCBI database under the project accession PRJNA642905. The functional profiles were inferred using the Piphillin pipeline (http://secondgenome.com/Piphillin/) [49] at the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (October 2018) using a 97% identity cutoff. This pipeline was developed to be applied as inference tool based on known information from the genome of the nearest taxonomically organisms observed in each sample [50]. The KO (KEGG Orthology) related to the target pathways (hydrolysis, glycolysis, hydrogen and methane production) were filtered by means of R language (https://www.R-project.org/) and were analyzed using the ggplot2 and phyloseq packages [51,52]. The quantification of each KO per sample was performed as described in Iwai et al. [49]. The KO related to hydrolysis and hydrogen production were filtered in accordance with Mazarelli et al. [9] and Villa-Montoya et al. [10], while the KO related to methanogenesis were filtered in accordance with Macedo et al. [53]. The metabolic pathways maps were inferred based on KEGG Mapper-Reconstruct Pathway tool [54], and the EC numbers (Enzyme Commission Numbers) for each KO were attributed using The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System (BRENDA) platform (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/). The Genetic Information Processing, Environmental Information Processing, Cellular Processes, Organismal Systems and Human Diseases pathways were not considered."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Biogas (H2 and CH4) and volatile fatty acids,"3.1 Biogas (H2 and CH4) and volatile fatty acids After the incubation period of approximately 22 h, P of 13.29 mmolH2. L−1, Rm of 2.46 mmolH2. h−1 and λ of 8.76 h were observed in Stage I, under conditions of 30 °C, pH 8.5, 2.25 gTVS.L−1 of autochthonous inoculum, 3 gTVS.L−1 of allochthonous inoculum, 5 g L−1 of CPW, 40% headspace and 5 g L−1 of NaCl [31,32]. It was not possible to detect methane production at this stage (≤1.17 mmol L−1). The acidified effluent from Stage I was used as a substrate for Stage II, to obtain CH4, in order to simulate a two-stage system, in the acidogenic stage and the methanogenic stage, respectively. The reactors were monitored for a period of approximately 700 h (Fig. 1 ). According to the data obtained (Table 1 ), it is estimated that the maximum CH4 production potential calculated for CH4 was 50.2 mmolCH4. L−1, the maximum CH4 production rate was 0.2 mmolCH4. h−1 and the start time of CH4 production was 281.4 h. In addition, in Stage II, a low H2 production was observed (about 0.8 mmol L−1), probably due to the activity of syntrophic bacteria which consumed the soluble carbohydrates present in this liquid fraction after hydrolysis in Stage I, where polysaccharides were hydrolyzed into oligo/di and/or monosaccharides, and subsequently consumed and converted to VFA and, concomitantly, H2 [27,28]. Also, it was observed that the increase in the Rm started after approximately 240 h of incubation, coinciding with the moment when the hydrogen production ceased, possibly due to the activity of homoacetogenic bacteria and/or hydrogenotrophic archaea. Forgàcs et al. [11] obtained maximum production of 247.7 mmolCH4. L−1 using CPW treated by steam explosion with sludge from a biogas production plant reactor as inoculum. Calabrò et al. [12] used several inocula for the production of CH4 from CPW, such as activated sludge, industrial wastes and agro-industrial wastes, obtaining the best results in experiments at mesophilic range in batch reactors, with a yield of 33 mmolCH4. L−1. Su et al. [13] obtained 0.01 mmolCH4. L−1 using biologically pretreated CPW (using Aspergillus niger and Phanerochaete chrysosporium strains) as substrate and swine manure and sewage sludge as inoculum. When compared to the aforementioned studies, it can be concluded that the methane production observed in the present study was satisfactory (50.2 mmolCH4. L−1), especially considering that the only type of pretreatment applied was fragmentation (≤1 mm), sparing other types of physical or chemical treatments, which can lead to waste generation and can be one of the costliest and time-consuming steps in the process. Since pH < 6.5 and high concentrations of organic compounds can be inhibitory to methanogenic microorganisms, two-stage systems have been explored in order to favor the specific microorganisms in each stage of anaerobic digestion. Thus, it is possible to adjust the operational variables, such as the optimum pH to each stage, the hydrolysis/acidogenesis in Stage I and methanogenesis in Stage II. According to Liu et al. [55], methane production from solid wastes is 21% higher in two-stage processes when compared to single stage, probably due to the advanced substrate hydrolysis during the first stage, where there is hydrogen and organic acids production, while hydrogen production can increase by up to 88%. Cremonez et al. [27] evaluated the separation of the acidogenic and methanogenic stages in reactors fed with cassava starch based-polymer in semi-continuous reactors, obtaining 26.69 mmol H2. L−1 and 528.2 mmol CH4. L−1. Braga et al. [28] evaluated the acidified effluent from the batch fermentation of lignocellulosic waste (sugarcane bagasse), using UASB sludge as inoculum, obtaining the maximum production of 7.6 mmol CH4. L−1 in Stage II. Similarly to this study, the VFA accumulation at the end of the acidogenic stage, especially HAc, favored the CH4 production in Stage II, due to the activity of acetoclastic archaea. Since the CH4 concentration obtained in this study in Stage II was higher (50.2 mmol CH4. L−1) when compared to Braga et al. [28], it is possible to infer that, among other operational parameters, the substrate and operational conditions used at this stage were more favorable to this process. The results regarding the physicochemical analyses are summarized in Table 2 . In the raw CPW, a total of 211.05 g kg−1 and 201.1 g kg−1 of TS and TVS were observed, respectively. Lignin was estimated as 25.3% of TS, while total limonene concentration was 3.65 g kg−1. Macro and micronutrientes were quantified below the inhibitory limits estimated for fermentative processes, such as total nitrogen (7005 mg kg−1) and phosphorus (882 mg kg−1). The elements Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mg, Ni, Ca, K, besides inhibitory both to dark fermentation and methanogenesis in high concentrations, are needed in the system as cofactors to enzymes [56], such as Fe-dehydrogenase, and were also observed on the raw CPW at concentrations below the inhibition limits (46.5, 62.45, 47, 9.48, 1123.5, <1, 5290 and 9570 mg kg−1, respectively). After the statistical analyses at 95% confidence interval, significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) was observed when comparing the TS data (p = 0.01067) and TVS (p = 0.1199) from stages I and II. It is possible to infer that this solid removal occurred due to the hydrolysis of the biomass in the acidogenic phase (Stage I), in the same way that the CODfiltered (p = 0.04405) and the total carbohydrates (p = 0.01547). The pH variation was considered as not statistically significant (p = 0.05614). Regarding the total phenols concentration, higher concentrations were observed in Stage I (20.09 mg L−1) in comparison with Stage II (19.43 mg L−1), where the difference was statistically significant in both stages (p = 0.006931). The higher phenol concentrations in Stage I can be attributed to the lignocellulosic depolymerization during hydrolysis, which can generate lignocellulose-derived compounds, such as furan derivatives, phenolic compounds and lignin [57]. However, it is possible to infer that these concentrations had no effects on H2 production, since its inhibition limits are estimated wihin the range of 800–1000 mg L−1 [58,59]. In Stage II, phenols concentration were lightly reduced, possibly due to its consumption by H2-producing bacteria capable of assimilating phenolic compounds to produce acetic acid and, concomitantly, H2 (Equation (2)) [60]. (2) C 6 H 6 O + 5 H 2 O → 3 C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 According to Camargo et al. [14], the initial concentration of limonene in the raw CPW was 14,700 mg kg−1. And the initial concentration of this compound in Stage I was about 220.5 mg kg−1. Since Calabró et al. [12] stated that concentrations above 200 mg kg−1 of limonene can inhibit the CH4 production, it is possible to infer that the presence of this compound was one of the reasons for the lack of CH4 in the biogas in Stage I. Besides that, Camargo et al. [38] found that the increase in limonene to 50 mg L−1 and 50–100 mg L−1 was not significant for H2 production parameters (P, Rm and λ), in other words, no inhibitory effect caused by this compound was observed at these concentrations, but the inhibitory effect was significant when the concentrations increased from 100 to ≥200 mg L−1. Burt [61] described that several parameters can affect the limonene toxicity and other essential oils, and the pH is one of them, which in acid conditions can increase its toxicity. Since the ideal pH for acidogenesis and H2 production is considerably lower than the ideal pH of methanogenesis, it is expected that the limonene antimicrobial action may be enhanced in the first case. In this study, the initial pH in both stages was adjusted to 8.5, reaching 6.7 after fermentation in Stage I, and 7.4 in Stage II, which may have potentiated the inhibitory effect of limonene at the Stage I. The initial concentration of limonene in Stage II was 0.58 mg kg−1. Since its minimum inhibitory concentration is estimated to be about 200 mg kg−1 [2,12], it can be inferred that there was no methanogenesis inhibition in Stage II, where the acidified effluent came from. However, this compound was not detected at the end of Stage II, which may indicate its volatilization to the headspace or degradation into p-cymene, a less toxic compound commonly generated from limonene degradation in anaerobic environments [12]. Moreover, according to Ruiz and Flotats [62], methanogenic organisms have greater adaptability to limonene due to the presence of a crystalline surface layer in their cells, providing greater resistance to lipophilic compounds, such as limonene. Higher CODfiltered and organic acids concentration were observed at the end of the acidogenic stage (Stage I). As a result, it can be inferred that the combination of H2 production with CH4 production in two stages favored energy recovery [28,63]. Despite the importance of VFA production as intermediates for the anaerobic digestion, its accumulation can lead to inhibition in the process. This inhibition can occur either due to the substrate competition in pathways where there is no biogas production, pH decrease, or when these molecules penetrate the cell membrane and dissociate inside the cell, leading to cytoplasm acidification due to anion accumulation, and it also reduces the growth potential and cellular metabolism [64]. According to Yusof et al. [65], it is estimated that concentrations above 900 mg L−1 of VFA may be inhibitory for methanogenesis, since in concentrations above that mentioned, the high VFA concentration can lead to pH decrease above the optimal for methanogenesis (6.8–7.0). In Stage I, 1498 mg L−1 of VFA was observed at the end of the operational time (Fig. 2 ), in addition to concentrations ≥900 mg L−1 throughout the process, which can justify the inhibition of methanogenesis in this assay. In Stage II, despite initial VFA concentrations of 1439 mg L−1, throughout the process there was consumption of these organic compounds, which may justify the long adaptation period, reflected in the high start time required for CH4 production (λ = 281.4 h) (Table 2). Increasing HAc concentrations were observed throughout Stage I, with 63 mg L−1 at the beginning of the incubation and 1340 mg L−1 at the end of the process. In addition, HBu 907 mg L−1 was observed at the beginning of Stage I, 723 mg L−1 throughout the fermentation process and 31 mg L−1 at the end of operational time, allowing to infer that HBu may have been converted to HAc throughout the incubation period, enabling its use as substrate by acetogenic archaea (Equation (3)) [66]. (3) C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 The predominance of acetogenesis pathway may have contributed to the high production of H2 in Stage I, since 4 mol of H2 are produced for each mole of glucose consumed in this path (Equation (4)), whereas for HBu production, only 2 mol of H2 for each mole of glucose are produced (Equation (5)) [67,68]. In addition, HBu cannot be used directly as substrate for methanogenesis; therefore, it will be converted to HAc (Equation (3)), which in turn can be consumed as substrate in acetoclastic methanogenesis. In Stage II, a reduction in the HAc concentration (1317 to ≤10 mg L−1) was observed, which can be attributed to its consumption in the acetoclastic pathway (Equation (6)) [69]. (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 4 H 2 (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 (6) C H 3 C O O H → C H 4 + C O 2 At the end of Stage I, production of HPr (85 mg L−1) and EtOH (40 mg L−1) was observed. Since in the metabolic pathway of HPr production there is consumption of 2 mol of H2 for each mole of oxidized glucose (Equation (7)) [70,71], high production of this acid is known to be disadvantageous to the process. Likewise, in the solventogenic pathway there is consumption of HAc for the production of EtOH (Equation (8)). Similarly to HBu, HPr cannot be directly consumed by methanogenic archaea, requiring its conversion to HAc (Equation (9)). (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 O (8) C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 → C H 3 C H 2 O H + H 2 O (9) C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + 3 H 2 O → C H 3 C O O H + 7 H C O 3 − + H + + 3 H 2 It noteworthy that in the conversion of the mentioned compounds into HAc, there is a concomitant H2 production, which in turn can be consumed by hydrogenotrophic archaea to reduce CO2 to CH4 (Equation (10)). (10) 4 H 2 + C O 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O Among the observed metabolites, HPr has been reported as the most toxic for anaerobic digestion processes due to its assimilation difficulty [69,72]. According to Shen et al. [73], HPr can be inhibitory for methanogenesis in concentrations above 1000 mg L−1. Thus, it was considered that the concentration of HPr observed at the end of Stage I (85 mg L−1) was not inhibitory for methanogenesis in Stage II."
10,Microbial community characterization,"3.2 Microbial community characterization Micromorphological analyses revealed the presence of rods similar to Clostridium in the biomass collected at the end of Stage II, as well as spores. In addition, it was possible to observe the presence of cocci and rods reactive to fluorescence, a common characteristic in Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium archaea, due to the presence of the electron-carrying coenzyme F420, which absorbs light in the 420 nm range and bluish-green fluoresces (data not shown). After the metabarcoding analyses, the results of Stage I and Stage II regarding the ecological indexes evaluated (Annex 1) were compared. In Stage I, 35,485 sequences of 16S rRNA genes were obtained, while 33,761 were obtained in Stage II. The Taxonomic Operational Units (OTUs) were grouped considering similarity higher than 97% and, after the removal of singletons, 600 OTU were obtained for Stage I and 646 OTU for Stage II. Based on the coverage values obtained (>99%), referring to the proportion of representative sequences, it was observed that most of the microbial populations were accessed, indicating good coverage of the analyzed samples (Annex 2). Based on the ecological indexes, greater diversity was observed in Stage I (3.9) when compared to Stage II (2.9) for the Shannon index, probably due to the selection of methanogenic microorganisms in Stage II (Table A1). The phyla observed in higher relative abundance in both Stage I and Stage II were Proteobacteria (47.83 and 42.34%) Firmicutes (40.55 and 48.32%), Thermotogae (3.04 and 0.72%) and Acidobacteria (2.45 and 2.15%), respectively. Other phyla observed in smaller proportions (≤1.5%) were Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, among others. The greater abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes can be related to the main metabolites observed during Stage I, where HAc (1340 mg L−1) and HBu (723 mg L−1) were the main metabolites produced by organisms of these phyla [74]. The main genera involved in Stage I (Fig. 3 ), where the CPW fermentation occurred, were Escherichia (34.39%), Clostridium (29.83%), Enterobacter (8.52%), Trichococcus (4.18%) and Coprothermobacter (1.89%). Among the mentioned genera, it is worth highlighting the importance of Clostridium in the different stages that involve H2 production, since several species of this genus are known to be cellulolytic, in addition to producing organic compounds and H2 via acetogenesis. Rabelo et al. [75] and Villa-Montoya et al. [76] also observed higher Clostridium relative abundance in anaerobic reactors applied to mesophilic fermentation of sugarcane bagasse and coffee processing wastes, respectively. The presence of Escherichia and Enterobacter in Stage I can be justified due to their affinity with mesophilic temperatures and neutral pH [77], in addition to resistance to limonene, one of the main inhibitors of citrus wastes [12]. These bacteria from the phylum Proteobacteria may have contributed to the HAc accumulation in this stage, since this acid is the main metabolite produced by these organisms [74]. The Coprothermobacter genus is mainly related to the inoculum used, since they have affinity with the thermophilic temperatures [78] used in the operation of the UASB reactor applied to the treatment of sugarcane vinasse (55 °C). In addition, the mentioned genus was observed by Soares et al. [79] with relative abundance of 41.73% in the same inoculum. Trichococcus are also common in sewage sludge, with its optimum temperature between 25 and 30 °C [80], the same temperature used in Stage I. In Stage II, the main genera observed were Comamonas (36.54%), Clostridium (6.30%), Coprothermobacter (4.0%), Tissierella (1.89%), Escherichia (1.81%), Sporosarcina (1.40%), Anaerobaculum (1.36%), Lysinibacillus (1.18%), Paraclostridium (1.14%) and Enterococcus (0.93%). Organisms of the genus Comamonas, although aerobic, have been previously reported in anaerobic reactors, such as Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) [81,82]. In addition, Comamonas may be related to the hydrolysis of HAc [83]. Among the mentioned bacterial genera observed in Stage II, Clostridium (6.30%), Eubacterium (0.00089%) and Thermoanaerobacter (0.000162%) can be highlighted, which can be associated with homoacetogenesis, a process in which H2 is consumed and converted to acetate. Since there was no increase in the concentration of acetate over the operational time, it can be inferred that this process was not predominant in the assays performed in this study. In addition, the growth kinetics of homoacetogenic organisms is lower than the hydrogenotrophic archaea [28]. Methane production was probably absent or under the limit of methane quantification in the method used (1.27 mmol) throughout the operational time in Stage I. However, methanogenic archaea of the genera Methanosarcina, Methanothermobacter and Methanoculleus were observed in relative abundances of 0.16%, 0.08% and 0.02%, respectively. The methanogenesis inhibition in Stage I may be related to the presence of limonene, one of the main inhibitors of CPW, since its concentration was 0.58 mg kg−1, whereas this compound was not detected in Stage II. These low relative abundances are in accordance with the results expected for anaerobic reactors, since generally the copy numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA are roughly 10 times greater than that of archaea 16S rRNA [84]. In addition, according to Cardinali-Rezende et al. [85], bacterial 16S rRNA number of gene copies can be about 360 times higher than archaeal copies per gram of sludge. As expected, higher relative abundance of archaea was observed in Stage II (Fig. 4 ), since this step aimed at obtaining CH4 from the acidified effluent of Stage I. The methanogenic genera (phylum Euryarchaeota) observed were Methanoplasma (0.26%), Methanoculleus (0.25%), Methanosarcina (0.20%), Methanomassiliicoccus (0.15%) and Methanothermobacter (0.083%). Methanoculleus archaea can produce CH4 from the CO2 and H2 produced in the other stages of anaerobic digestion. Despite not being able to use acetate as carbon source, these organisms are more tolerant to high concentrations of organic compounds, such as HAc and HPr, when compared to other methanogenic archaea [86]. According to Zhang et al. [87], about 30% of the methane formed in anaerobic reactors comes from the hydrogenotrophic pathway, which contributes to the maintenance of the partial pressure of the reactor and the establishment of syntrophic bacteria. Except for the genus Methanosarcina, which can be versatile and presents acetoclastic metabolism, the other genera observed can be considered hydrogenotrophic [88]. Thus, the presence of these hydrogenotrophic archaea may be related to the consumption of H2 at the beginning of Stage II. Despite having preferentially methylotrophic metabolism, the genera Methanoplasma and Methanomassiliicoccus have been associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis [89], possibly due to their dependence on H2 for the regeneration of coenzyme-M in methylotrophic metabolism, through CO2 reduction [90]. Koo, Yulisa and Hwang [89] reported an increase in the hydrogenotrophic pathway in anaerobic reactors operated with food waste as substrate, and animal waste as an inoculum. The genus observed in higher relative abundance was Methanoculleus, in addition to Methanoplasma and Methanomassiliicoccus. In Ghosh et al. [91], the authors performed the metataxonomic characterization of the microbial consortium involved in the biodegradation of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge, indicating that Methanosarcina was the most abundant genus, probably due to its greater tolerance to the high concentrations of HAc produced in the acidogenic stage, and variations in pH. In this study, the pH was maintained close to neutrality throughout the operational time in Stage II (~7.0) and the initial concentrations of HAc were (1340 mg L−1). Methanosarcina is a multifunctional genus, capable of producing methane from different metabolic pathways (acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic). Thus, the presence of these archaea in anaerobic reactors may favor the H2 production due to the consumption of intermediate metabolites from anaerobic digestion, generating alkalinity and contributing to the maintenance of the pH [69,87]."
11,Functional characterization,"3.3 Functional characterization After the prediction of functional profiles, a total of 7035 different KO objects was obtained for Stage I and 6917 KO for Stage II, and a total of 6,844,289 in Stage I and 22, 234, 364 in Stage II. It was possible to predict the main metabolic pathways described in the KEGG platform, totaling 24.75% and 22.59%, respectively for Stage I and II for the category “Metabolism”. The main pathways observed in the KEGG category for Metabolism were the carbohydrate pathways (12.70 and 11.48%) and energy (4.66 and 4.71%) (Annex 3). Regarding carbohydrate metabolism, the main subcategories observed were fructose and mannose metabolism (1.61 and 1.59%), pyruvate metabolism (1.60 and 1.58%), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (1.57%), propanoate (1.59 and 0.47%) and butanoate metabolism (1.52 and 1.51%) and starch and sucrose metabolism (0.49 and 0.45%), for Stage I and Stage II, respectively. For energy metabolism, methane metabolism was the main subcategory, in which 2.10% of correspondences was observed for Stage I and 2.20% for Stage II. The main KO related to Stage I are summarized in Fig. 5 , especially in hydrolysis, glycolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis stages. In general, it can be observed that higher proportions of these KO were related to Stage I when compared to Stage II, especially for the cellobiose phosphotransferase system (PTS) EIIA and EIIB component, K02760 (0.03%) and K02759 (0.02%) [EC: 2.7.1.196 2.7.1.205], involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, in the conversion of cellobiose into cellobiose 6-phosphate. Escherichia is one of the genus related to the synthesis of this enzyme [92], observed in relative abundance of 34.39% in Stage I. Likewise, 6-phospho-β-glucosidase K01223 [EC: 3.2. 1.86] is also related to starch and sucrose metabolism, in addition to glycolysis. This hydrolase is responsible for converting cellobiose 6-phosphate to d-glucose. Escherichia is the main genus observed in Stage I also related to the synthesis of this enzyme. The smaller proportions of KO predicted were mainly related to hydrolysis, glycolysis and acidogenesis/acetogenesis, such as endoglucanases (K01179 [EC: 3.2.1.4]), cellobiose PTS system EIIA and EIIB components (K02759 and K02760 [EC: 2.7.1.205]), phosphoglucomutases (K01835 [EC: 5.4.2.2]), glucose PTS system components (K02778 [EC: 2.7.1.199]), acetyl-CoA synthetase and acetate/butyrate ligases (K01895 and K01913 [EC: 6.2.1.1]). These enzymes can be involved in several pathways, especially carbohydrate and pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis. In addition, the presence of KO related to hydrogen production, such as pyruvate synthase (K00169, K00170, K00171 [EC: 1.2.7.1]) and alcohol dehydrogenase (K04072, K13954, K00001 [EC: 1.1.1.1]) is emphasized. As highlighted by Camargo et al. [32], Clostridium (29.83%), Escherichia (34.5%) and Paraclostridium (1.52%) genera are closely related to hydrolysis and glycolysis in Stage I, while Enterobacter (8.55%) and Defluviitoga (1.57%) are also involved in acidogenesis, in addition to the mentioned genera. KO related to lignin and limonene degradation was also observed, both present in CPW. The limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase (K10533 [EC: 3.3.2.8]) and limonene 1,2-monooxygenase (K14733 [EC:1.14.13.107]) were observed in Stage I (0.000012 and 0.00004%, respectively). The vanillyl alcohol oxidase (K20153 [EC 1.1.3.38]) is related to the auxiliary activities for lignin degradation, and this group of enzymes can catalyze the conversion of phenolic compounds with aromatic ring side chains, and were observed in proportions of 0.00005% in Stage I. The main KO related to methanogenesis were filtered according to Macedo et al. [53], and are summarized in Fig. 6 . As expected, higher proportions of all KO predicted involved in different stages of methane production were observed in higher proportions in Stage II when compared to Stage I. The KO observed in higher proportion was the acetyl-CoA synthetase (K01895 [EC: 6.2.1.1], 0.04%), a ligase involved in the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA (Equation (11)) in the acetoclastic pathway, where Methanosarcina was the main genus associated with this reaction [93]. (11) A T P + a c e t a t e + C o e n z y m e A → A M P + d i p h o s p h a t e + A c e t y l C o A The K00925 ([EC: 2.7.2.1]) is a transferase with acetate kinase activity, and the second KO predicted higher proportions in Stage II (0.03%), besides being the main KO predicted in Stage I (0.01%). Acetate kinase is also involved in methanogenesis due to its fundamental role in the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, however, unlike acetyl-CoA synthetase, which can be synthesized by several organisms, only the genus Methanosarcina is able to assimilate acetate by the acetate kinase activity [93]. The phosphate acetyltransferase K00625 [EC: 2.3.1.8] was observed in proportions of 0.03% in Stage II and 0.003% in Stage I. This transferase is related to the Coenzyme A regeneration, and can be related to both Clostridium and Methanosarcina genera, which is also important for acetate metabolism [94]. Only acetyltransferase phosphate (K13788 [EC: 2.3.1.8]) was observed in greater proportions in Stage I compared to Stage II (0.01% and 0.0001%, respectively). This enzyme is related to acetate fermentation, in the reversible reaction between acetyl-CoA synthesis and Coenzyme A regeneration (Equation (12)), both in methanogenesis (acetoclastic) and pyruvate metabolism. The main genera associated with the synthesis of this enzyme are Escherichia and Clostridium [94,95], observed in relative abundances of 34.39 and 29.83% in Stage I, respectively. (12) A c e t y l C o A + p h o s p h a t e ↔ C o e n z y m e A + a c e t y l p h o s p h a t e Among the KO predicted in smaller proportions related to methanogenesis, there is the methyl-coenzyme M reductase gamma subunit (K00402 [EC: 2.8.4.1]), observed in 0.002% in Stage II and 0.0001% in Stage I. This transferase is responsible for the catalysis in the final step of methanogenesis, where the biological methane production occurs. Several methanogenic archaea genera can be associated with this enzyme, such as Methanosarcina (0.20%) and Methanothermobacter (0.083%), observed in Stage II [96–98]. The K00193 [EC: 2.3.1.169] is related to the methyl-Co(III) Fe–S corrinoid protein (CH3–CO(III)FeSP) synthesis, from the Co(I) corrinoid Fe–S protein and acetyl-CoA. The CH3–CO(III)FeSP is then converted to the Co(I) corrinoid Fe–S protein and 5-methyl-tetrahydrosarcinapterin (5-Methyl-H4SPT) by enzymes related to acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (K00194 and K00197 [EC: 2.1.1.245]). Although the KO predicted in higher proportions is related to acetoclastic metabolism, it is worth highlighting the importance of KO predicted in smaller proportions and involved in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic metabolism. Among these, K14128 [EC: 1.12.99.-] stands out, as regards the F420-non-reducing hydrogenase small subunit, which is interconnected with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the reduction of the F420 coenzyme using H2. The possible metabolic pathways and the main genera involved are summarized in Fig. 7 . The simplified methanogenic pathways were based on Park et al. [99]. It is possible to infer that the main pathway involved in obtaining methane using acidified effluent from CPW fermentation is the acetoclastic pathway, since higher proportions of genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway were inferred in Stage II, in addition to a greater relative abundance of archaea known to be acetoclastic, such as Methanosarcina (0.20%)."
12,Conclusion,"In this study, besides the high H2 production in Stage I (13.29 mmol L−1), it can be stated that the metabolites produced contributed to the CH4 production in Stage II (50.2 mmol L−1). Since although the same inoculum was used, there was no CH4 production in Stage I, it is possible to conclude that the two-stage approach could be successfully applied to improve the value-added products obtained from CPW as the main substrate. It is worth highlighting that due to the two-stage approach, the inhibitory effect of limonene in methanogenesis may be overcome, since concentrations above the inhibitory limits (200 mg kg−1) were observed in Stage I (220,5 mg kg−1), but in Stage II this compound was observed below this limit (≤0.58 mg kg−1). Through Next Generation sequencing approaches, it was possible to state acetogenesis as the main pathway at Stage I, with the genera Escherichia, Clostridium, Paraclostridium and Enterobacter being the major contributors in hydrolysis and/or H2 and VFA production in this stage. In Stage II, acetoclastic methanogenesis was considered to play a role for CH4 production, and it is possible to infer that the highly abundant genes in this stage were related with this pathway, such as acetyl-CoA synthetase. In this regard, it was concluded that the results described may contribute to better understand the microbial communities involved in dark fermentation processes of lignocellulosic biomass, and of the preponderant metabolic pathways involved in both, H2 and CH4 production using CPW as substrate. More studies are needed in order to advance the understanding of the relation between physicochemical and biological parameters involved in the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic wastes, with high environmental impact relevance, as well as its metabolic functional dynamics, which is still poorly described in the scientific literature."
