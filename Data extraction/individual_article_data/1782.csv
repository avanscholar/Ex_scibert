0,Introduction,"Biomass is most promising renewable and sustainable source for future energy, which can be utilized for the production of valuable chemical compound [1,2]. Lignocellulosic biomasses are the organic polymeric unit containing second generation feedstock and its major constituents units are cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (15–25%) and lignin (15–35%) [3,4]. These major constituents are structured as: cellulose is glucose monomeric unit containing homo-polymer and crystalline, hemicellulose is an amorphous hetero-polymer, whose repeating monomeric component is C5 unit while lignin is an aromatic unit containing part of biomass whose monomers are sinapyl alcohol, coumaryl alcohol and syringyl alcohol [5]. The carbohydrate composition of the biomass can be transformed into numerous potential fuel such as 2,5-dimethyl tetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), 2,5-dimethyl furan (DMF), 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (Me-THF),γ-valerolactone (GVL), tetrahydrofuran (THF) etc., [6,7]. They can also be accommodating in obtaining fine chemicals such as 2,5-diformyl furan (DFF), 2,5-furandicarboxyllic acid (FDCA), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) furan (BHMF), etc [6–8]. The production of these chemicals can benefited for market value by using as pharmaceutics, perfumery, and polymer etc., [9–11]. However biomass produced compounds has higher oxygen cantinas compounds as biomass consisted of higher oxygen element, which has lower value in chemical industries. The catalytic up-gradation of that bio-oil would be a good for economical and clean transformations for pharmaceutical, and petrochemicals uses [1,8]. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is the most important process for the oxygenated bio-oil up-gradation into valuable fuels/chemicals. Recently have been seen that hydrogenation of HMF into valuable chemicals such as 2,5-dimethyl furan (DMF) might be useful for fuel additive. DMF showed a various advantage over bio-ethanol and butanol as a substitute to gasoline. Chen at al., studied the HMF hydrogenation with Ni was supported on perovskite LaFeO3 catalyst at 230 °C for 6 h under high 725 hydrogen pressure. They obtained high selectivity of DMF (98.3%) with lower conversion [12]. Another research group Yang et al., have seen 76% DMF selectivity with Ni/Co3O4 catalyst at a longer time 24 h, however the conversion was 100% [13]. Yu et al., carried out hydrogenation of HMF with bimetallic catalyst (Ni-Fe/CNT) at 383 K for reaction holding time of 18 h. They found only 91.3% of DMF, while at lower temperature BHMF (96.1%) was the major product [14]. Zhu et al., investigated the HMF conversion under very rash condition at 513 K with Ni/ZrP catalyst in presence of 725 psi hydrogen gas for 20 h under THF solvent. They reported 68.2% of DMF selectivity which is very low compared to the other researcher results [15]. HMF hydrogenation tested by Zhu et al., at lower temperature (443 K) and pressure (145 psi) under 1,4 dioxane solvent. They observed 83.3% selectivity of DMF [16]. Carbon supported Ru metal catalyst test by Jae et al., 2013 at 190 °C for 6 h under 2-propanol solvent. They found a lower selectivity of DMF (81%) [17]. Therefore the catalyst system, reaction temperature, H2 pressure and reaction solvents is the crucial factor to enhance the efficiency of HMF hydrogenation. Some of the above catalytic systems require harsh reaction conditions, such as high catalyst loading, high reaction temperatures and/or long reaction times. This study examined the activity of synthesized over Ru metal loaded on various supports (ZSM-5, Y-zeolite, β-zeolite, COK-12, mordenite, and ZrO2) on 5-HMF hydrogenation. The reaction was carried out at different temperatures (100–200 °C), pressures (100–300 psi), and time (1–5 h), catalyst amount (10–100 mg), and solvents (water, ethanol, methanol IPA and 2-butanol). The details catalytic activity on the 5-HMF conversion and DMF selectivity were explored to identify with the consequence of catalyst acidity and pore size. The catalyst reaction mechanism and recyclability of the catalyst was investigated."

The supports ZrO2, ZSM-5, β-zeolite, Y-zeolite, Mordenite, COK-12 and Ruthenium metal salt (RuCl3.H2O) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."
3,Catalyst and product characterization,"2.2 Catalyst and product characterization Impregnated Ru metal catalysts were characterized by the help of various analytical techniques. The XRD pattern of the catalyst was characterized by using X-ray diffractometry (Smartlab, Rigaku, Japan) in the 2θ-range of 10–80°. The metal phases of the catalysts were identified by their characteristic 2θ values. The particle morphology and elemental composition were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX), respectively. The analysis was performed on FEI Quanta 200F instruments at various magnifications. Specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume were determined from nitrogen adsorption measurements carried out at 77 K in Nova 4200e, Quantachrome, USA, equipment. The samples were first out gassed at 423 K overnight. Calculation of the surface area and pore volume was carried out using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. NH3-TPD experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics-2720 (Chemisoft TPx) instrument. In order to evaluate the acidity of the catalysts, ammonia TPD measurements were carried out by: (i) pre-treating the samples from room temperature to 200 °C under a helium flow rate of 25 mL min−1, (ii) adsorption of ammonia at 40 °C and (iii) desorption of ammonia with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 starting from the adsorption temperature to 700 °C. TPR analysis was carried out on a TPR/TPD 2900 Micromeritics apparatus provided with thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was 5%H2/Ar in flow of 40 mL min−1 and a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Particle size and distribution were studied using a transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), model JEOL 1200 EX. A small amount of the solid sample was sonicated in 2-propanol for 1 min. A drop of the prepared suspension was deposited on a Cu grid coated with a carbon layer, and the grid was then dried at room temperature before analysis. The upgraded products were analyzed by the help of Shimadzu GC-FID (GC-2014) with HP-5 capillary column (quantified). While GC-MS was used for qualitative analysis of the products (Agilent GC (7890B) coupled with a mass spectrometer (5977A MSD)). The bio-oil in acetone was injected into GC-MS using an auto-injector. The temperature used in the oven was from 50 to 300 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and hold temperature at 300 °C for 10 min."
4,HMF hydrogenation reaction procedure,"2.3 HMF hydrogenation reaction procedure The hydrogenation reaction was carried out in 50 mL high pressure autoclave reactor. In the reactor 1 gm HMF, different wt.% of catalyst (10, 25, 50,75 and 100 wt%) with 10 mL solvent for different reaction time (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) at desire temperature (120, 140, 160, 180 and 200 °C) under different hydrogen pressure. The inside solution was stirred at 1000 rpm. After the reaction, the reactor cooled to room temperature. Then, the obtained products analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-FID) with internal standard methods and GC-MS (Agilent-7890B).

5,Catalyst synthesis,2.4 Catalyst synthesis The 1%Ru metal supported catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation method [18]. Ruthenium salt (RuCl3.H2O) firstly dissolved in H2O for 1 h. Then the supports added slowly in the metal solution with continuous stirring for 1 h. After that the catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The obtained dried catalyst calcined at 450 °C with heating rate of 5 °C/min for 5 h in the presence of air. All prepared catalyst are crashed and sieved to 50–55 mesh before use in experiments.
6,Results and discussion,"2.5 Results and discussion 2.5.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD peak pattern of all synthesized ZSM-5 and Ru/ZSM-5 catalysts analyzed and is shown in Fig. 1 . It was observed that the peak pattern of support in catalyst remains unchanged after calcinations. The peak pattern of ZSM-5 observed at 2θ 23.4, 24.1, and 24.7° and it was well matched with reported [19] but after the impregnation of the Ru metal the patterns are shifted and new peaks observed in Ru/ZSM-5 for Ru metal due to the low loading of Ru [20]. The presence of Ru are confirmed by the trace metal analysis of ICP-AES (0.94 wt%). Morphology of all Ru impregnated metal catalyst was investigated by SEM and TEM analysis, which is shown in Fig. 2 . The images of catalyst showed the spherical shape, and Ru/ZSM-5 was found in sheets like surface [21]. The segregation of Ru metal on the surface of support ZSM-5 was confirmed by XRD pattern. Also images are confirmed that the prepared catalyst microporous in nature [21]. The EDX (EDX = energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) confirmed that Ru metal presence which is shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S1. BET analysis is shown that the prepared catalyst microporous in nature and it showed type I isotherm, shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . The TPR analysis showed that the prepared Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst highly stable at high temperature shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S2. Peaks observed at higher temperature for Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst due to the Ru detached in the microporous structure of ZSM-5 [22]. Interaction between the Ru and ZSM-5 (Ru-O) increased the stability, for this at higher temperature peak was shown [20]. The acidity is the main properties for the reaction during hydrogenation reaction. The NH3-TPD analysis was carried out to understand the acidity of the catalyst and shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S3. Two peaks were observed; one at lower temperature and another one at higher temperature. The lower temperature (150 °C–275 °C) peaks are due to weak acidic site whereas higher temperature (375 °C–470 °C) peaks for higher acidity of the catalyst. Moreover total acidity observed for catalyst was 0.70 mmol/gm. 2.5.2 Catalytic screening on HMF hydrogenation The acidic nature of the support used in this study led to the effective deoxygenation which has been reported in the earlier studies [12,23]. In the process of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) a bi-functional catalyst with active metal favors hydrogenation while deoxygenating is favored by the acidic nature. This aids in enhancing the overall hydrogenation process. The behavior of support used is necessary to understand for the process kinetics and thermodynamics. The support behavior for hydrogenation of HMF was thus investigated by incorporating ruthenium (Ru) as an active metal over various acidic supports as shown in Table 2 . The supports used being highly or a little acidic helped in the deoxygenation of HMF via the dehydration pathway. The experimental conditions for hydrogenation of HMF were optimized by carrying out the reaction at different temperatures (120–200 °C), pressures (100–300 psi) over Ru support catalyst. The maximum HMF conversion of 98% and DMF selectivity of 97% was observed with catalyst (50 wt%) Ru/ZSM-5 at 180 °C under 250 psi H2 pressure. The obtained results for the optimization of experimental conditions were used to screen the catalyst activity of all the synthesized catalyst for Hydrogenation of HMF. Ruthenium was found to play a vital role in HMF conversion as ZSM-5 showed only 48% (≈10% DMF selectivity). A conversion in the range of 80–98% was observed in all the catalytic systems except for support. The high acidic nature of mordenite and ZSM-5 among all support limited the conversion to 57–58% due to coke formation and rapidly deactivating the pore. The pore size and the acidic site density are provided in Table 1. In case of the zeolites, both the factors were observed to have essential effects. The DMF selectivity was observed to decreases with the increasing acidic site density and pore size due to the difference in kinetic diameters and interaction of the catalyst with HMF functional group. It is well agreed various researcher group [23,24]. While, the order of DMF selectivity at zeolite-based catalytic systems followed the order Ru/ZSM-5>Ru/Mordenite > Ru/β-zeolite > Ru/y-zeolite. The product distribution was highly affected by catalysts properties of support and metal-supported catalysts [23]. From Table 2, it is seen that for the production of DMF selectively, Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst might be suitable option. 2.5.3 Effect of reaction temperature The different temperature effect was investigated during the hydrogenation of HMF and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . The reaction was carried out at temperature range of 120–200 °C with Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst. The pressure 250 psi, catalyst amount 50.wt% and ethanol as a solvent used as optimum conditions. Fig. 6 shows that the HMF conversion increased from 85 to 98% with increased temperature 120–180 °C while further increase the temperature the conversion found decreases. DMF selectivity rapidly increased from 76 to 97% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 120 °C to 180 °C. The conversion was observed to remain unaffected or slightly decreased by an increase of reaction temperature up to 200 °C. However, with the increased in temperature from 180 to 200 °C the selectivity of DMF decreased from 97 to 92% which may be attributed to the coke formation on the surface of the catalyst because of higher cracking [25]. Similar observation also found by Solanki et al. they concluded that ring hydrogenation was occurred [8]. It was observed that the suitable temperature for the HMF hydrogenation is 180 °C. However at lower temperature the selectivity of BHMF an intermediate compounds observed slightly higher (17%) due to the partially hydrogenation of HMF. 2.5.4 Effect of hydrogen pressure The reaction pressure during the hydrogenation reaction have been seen that pressure influenced the reaction conversion was well as the DMF selectivity. The different pressure was examined at 180 °C with 50 wt% catalyst with ethanol solvent. The conversion of HMF and degree of hydrogenation (DMF yield) with distribution of other products are shown in Fig. 5 . The HMF conversion and yield of DMF was 98% and 97% at 250 psi, however the conversion increased to 99% with increased the pressure but lowered the DMF yield. The conversion of HMF was found to be proportional to the H2 pressure in the system. Hence the suitable hydrogen pressure can prevented the coke formation and showed higher activity [26]. A negative effect was observed in DMF selectivity when the H2 pressure in the system exceeded 250 psi. However, reaction at higher pressure above 250 psi, it can be seen that DMF selectivity decreases. It was may be due to the catalyst under the high pressure cracked the HMF efficiently, for this higher number of products were produced [8]. However with low hydrogen pressure, the cracking of the HMF was not shown dynamically which inhibited the main catalytic path for the product formation. It was observed that with the hydrogen pressure ranging between 200 and 250 psi, the hydrogenation process of HMF mainly produced DMF. 2.5.5 Effect of reaction time The different reaction holding times have been examined on the HMF conversion into product selectivity. Reaction time on HMF conversion and DMF selectivity is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows that the HMF conversion increased from 62 to 99% with increasing reaction holding time from 1 h to 5 h by C=O bond hydrogenation. While, with increasing the reaction time from 1 h to 5 h, the selectivity of the DMF was decreased while higher selectivity of DMF (97%) was found for 3 h reaction time. Further the increasing the reaction time from 3 to 5 h the selectivity of the compounds decreased from 97 to 87% but the conversion increased from 98 to 99%. The lower product selectivity was due to the reversible reaction to some extent or coke formation which ultimately decreased the DMF yield [23]. It can be seen that reaction time 3 h was the sufficient time for the DMF by hydrogenation of BHMF and MFA. Also lowering the reaction time decreased the conversion and product selectivity, which may be increased the dimmer products or partial degradation of HMF during hydrogenation. 2.5.6 Catalyst amount on HMF conversion and DMF selectivity The effect of different amount of Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst on the conversion and product selectivity is given in Fig. 7 . It was observed that the conversion of HMF increased from 85 to 98% with increasing the amount of Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst from 10 to 75 wt%. But, in case of higher amount of catalyst such as 100 wt% of Ru/ZSM-5, the hydrogenation selective products (DMF) of HMF decreased with higher conversion of 99%. It was indicated that 50 wt% was sufficient (Ru/ZSM-5) catalyst amount for maximum conversion of HMF and higher selectivity products. The DMF products selectivity obtained from the conversion of HMF in the presence of different amount 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 wt% of Ru/ZSM-5 was found as 65, 89, 97, 94 and 88%, respectively. It was observed that the higher selectivity of DMF only 65% with byproducts of BHMF (20%), MFA (8%) and MF (7%) formed with 10 wt% Ru/ZSM-5, which showed that 10 wt% Ru/ZSM-5 was not enough for the complete hydrogenation of HMF into selective compound. Again higher amount of catalyst 100 wt% showed that HMF hydrogenation effectively accelerate the rate breaking of HMF (C-O bond) during hydrogenation and produce more products yield and lower selective compound. It was clearly noticed that maximum conversion 98% of HMF and selective compound (DMF) 97% found by 50 wt% Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst. 2.5.7 Effects of solvent The solubility of HMF and hydrogen would influences the HMF conversion and product selectivity, the different solvent effects investigated here and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . Among the all solvents, ethanol proved to be highly proficient which is because of higher tendency of hydrogen donates, low dielectric constant and lower boiling point [27]. When water used as a solvent, the HMF conversion found very low 75% with lower yield of DMF (74%). However, other alcoholic solvent showed significantly higher conversion (79–98%) and selectivity (84–97%) compared to the water solvent. This is due to the lower solubility of hydrogen or hydrogen less effective for hydrogenation reaction under water solvent system [8]. With water solvent the major product was observed BHMF (16%). Hence it can be said that the hydrogen donor solvent influenced the reaction profile. Methanol showed some ester compound which decreased the yield of DMF, due to the lower alcohol enhanced the etherification [8]. While other alcohol IPA and 2-butanol might be produced lower hydrogen or soluble lower amount of hydrogen which is mainly reason of the hydrogenation of HMF."
7,Mechanism of HMF into products,"2.6 Mechanism of HMF into products The conversion of HMF into products occurred by several reaction pathways such as hydrogenolysis, tautomerization, ketonization and partial hydrogenation which breaks the aromatic C=O bond [28]. Further it can be also possible direct hydrogenation of HMF to DMF by the applying of noble metal catalyst due it oxophilic nature by attacking its electron by rich oxygen and reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 9 . During hydrogenation, hydrogen molecule dissociates in existence on Ru/ZSM-5 acid sites, then attacks the electrophilic carbon of C=O, which produced an intermediate of BHMF [8]. Then the BHMF dehydrated into DMF [28]. The dehydration of BHMF was the foremost reason for the sole DMF product formation [29]. It was observed by researchers that the bond dissociation energy of aliphatic C-OH lower (378 kJ/mol) compared to the aromatic C-OH bond (432 kJ/mol) which is suggested that the products are formed by hydrogenation reaction with aliphatic C=O cleavages [30,31]. The formation of BHMF intermediate suggested that aliphatic C-O bond hydrogenation provoked by the Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst compared to the other supported catalyst."
8,Reproducibility and recyclability of catalyst,"2.7 Reproducibility and recyclability of catalyst The Ru/ZSM-5 showed an excellence reproducibility with several time, which is regenerated by calcined at 550 °C in air. Conversion of HMF and selectivity of DMF showed higher extent with five times uses. The product (DMF selectivity) and HMF conversion are shown in Table 3 . When first run carried out, it was seen that like fresh catalyst the reaction goes and similar conversion (98%) and DMF selectivity (97%) obtained. Further second and third run showed the conversion as well as the DMF selectivity slightly decreased to 96% and 94%, respectively. While in fifth run the selectivity decreased to 85%, whereas the conversion showed likely to third and fourth run are 90 and 88%. The decrease of the conversion as well as the selectivity may be due to the coke formation in the catalyst pore which reduced the activity for the products formation. The leaching of Ru metal during experiments is confirmed by the TEM EDX analysis.0.12 wt% leaching was observed after fifth run which is support that the catalyst might be valuable for HMF hydrogenation."
9,Conclusions,"The product formation mainly depends on the catalyst properties and the process parameters. The higher selectivity of DMF (97%) was observed with Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst at 180 °C under 250 psi pressures with ethanol solvent. It was seen that C-O hydrogenolysis reaction provoked when H2 pressure increased. Catalyst leaching was observed after fifth run, which is support that the catalyst might be valuable for HMF hydrogenation. Recyclability and stability observed that Ru/ZSM-5 has an excellence activity in both HMF hydrogenation and DMF selectivity. The hydrogenation with Ru/ZSM-5 catalyst might be open a new pathway for produces valuable chemicals."
