0,Introduction,"Conversion of alcohols into valuable chemical products is of great significance in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical industry [1]. Especially, oxidation of primary alcohols into carboxylic acids is a fundamental and well-established process, which has attracted numerous researchers to conduct extensive and systematic studies [2,3]. Generally, this process was realized in the presence of toxic/expensive oxidants or reagents [4–6]. In some cases, dioxygen gas was applied as a mild oxidant [7–15]. Nevertheless, explosive mixtures may be generated, and air-sensitive functional groups could not be tolerated. In recent years, catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of alcohols and water or hydroxides has been demonstrated as an appealing protocol to access carboxylic acids [16]. This protocol has become one of the research hotspots since it evolves dihydrogen gas as the sole byproduct, avoids the use of external oxidants or additives, and possesses the characteristics of environmental friendliness and high atom economy. As a pioneering example, Milstein et al. reported a well-defined PNN-Ru complex, which efficiently converted a handful of benzylic or aliphatic alcohols into the respective carboxylic acids under alkaline solutions [16]. Inspired by this work, many research groups have been involved in this area and developed a diverse variety of catalytic systems for this process. Despite many other metals including Rh [17], Pd [18], Ir [19–23], Ag [24,25], Fe [26], Mn [26,27], Zn [28], and Co [29,30] have been employed, Ru remains the metal of choice in many situations probably owing to its high activity [31–45]. N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been recognized as a unique class of ancillary ligands in a diverse variety of metal complexes due to their strong σ-donating properties [46–54]. Besides, their electronic and steric profile can be separately modulated. Hence, several monodentate NHC-Ru complexes were prepared and applied to ADC of alcohols with water/hydroxides [33,34,44]. Without extra ligands/additives, relatively high Ru loadings (0.1–1.0 mol%) were required to achieve satisfactory results under inert atmosphere ( Fig. 1a). To further improve catalytic efficiency and practical usefulness, we designed and prepared the first cyclometallated Ru complex bearing a bidentate NHC ligand for this catalytic process [41]. Notably, this catalysis was accomplished in open air at a low catalyst loading (250 ppm) (Fig. 1b). Inspired by this interesting finding, we were eager to conduct further investigations based on this high-performing complex. It was observed that this complex contained several modification sites (X, Y and Z, as shown in Fig. 1c). Hence, this work aimed to introduce various substituents on these sites, and then evaluated the effects of these substituents on the catalytic performance of the resulting NHC-Ru complexes. Through extensive exploration, gram-scale production of various carboxylic acids was realized at an ultralow Ru loading (62.5 ppm), also in open air. Ultimately, we calculated the quantitative green metrics, and compared the values in the present work with those derived from representative catalytic systems in the literature. Gratifyingly, the present study performed better than the literature reports in terms of greenness and sustainability."
1,Experimental section,
2,General considerations,"2.1 General considerations All the catalytic reactions were carried out in open air, while the synthesis of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] and other air-sensitive reactions were accomplished by using standard Schlenk techniques or inside an argon-filled glovebox. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer, with 500 MHz for 1H NMR, 126 MHz for 13C NMR and 471 MHz for 19F NMR, respectively. For the NMR analyses, toluene-d 8, CDCl3, DMSO-d 6 and D2O were used as deuterated solvents. The following abbreviations were used to designate multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, p = pentet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets. Melting points were measured by using a Buchi M-560 apparatus without calibration. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses were done with a Thermo Fisher Q Exactive UHMR Orbitrap instrument. All the solvents (DMSO, THF, m-xylene, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, toluene-d 8, CDCl3, DMSO-d 6 and D2O etc.), reagents (alcohols 1a-1o, KOH, Cs2CO3, Na2SO4, [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2, and the chemicals used for the synthesis of NHC precursors L1-L7 etc.), consumables for column chromatography (silica gel, neutral alumina, silica gel plates etc.) were purchased from commercial suppliers, and they were directly used without further treatment or purification. NHC precursors L1-L3, L5 and NHC-Ru complexes [Ru-1]-[Ru-3] and [Ru-5] were synthesized by using the reported procedure [41]."
3,"General procedure for the synthesis of NHC precursors L4, L6 and L7","2.2 General procedure for the synthesis of NHC precursors L4, L6 and L7 To a 25 mL Schlenk flask, CuI (57.1 mg, 0.30 mmol), KOH (342.6 mg, 6.00 mmol), imidazole (306.4 mg, 4.50 mmol), iodobenzene (0.34 mL, 3.00 mmol)], a stirring bar and DMSO (5.0 mL) were successively added. The flask was subjected to at least three evacuation/argon refilling cycles before it was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h. After the reaction was completed, the flask was cooled down to ambient temperature. The precipitate was filtered off, and ethyl acetate (25 mL) was added to the filtrate. Subsequently, the resulting solution was washed with water (5 × 25 mL), brine (25 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to obtain a black oil, which was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, eluent: petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 2:1) to afford pure 1-phenyl-1H-imidazole (363.3 mg, 2.52 mmol, 84%). Next, a mixture of purified 1-phenyl-1H-imidazole (144.2 mg, 1.00 mmol), ethyl iodide (240 μL, 3.00 mmol) and acetone (2.0 mL) was heated at reflux for 12 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, petroleum ether (10 mL) was slowly added while stirring. The generated precipitate was collected via vacuum filtration, washed with Et2O (3 × 10 mL), and dried under a vacuum pump to afford 3-ethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-imidazol-3-ium iodide (L4, 276.1 mg, 0.92 mmol, 92%). The overall yield in two steps was calculated as 77%. Similar procedures were adopted for the synthesis of 3,4-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-imidazol-3-ium iodide (L6) and 4-bromo-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1 H-imidazol-3-ium (L7), with the overall yield in two steps being calculated as 80% and 66%, respectively."
4,"General procedure for the synthesis of [Ru-4], [Ru-6] and [Ru-7]","2.3 General procedure for the synthesis of [Ru-4], [Ru-6] and [Ru-7] To a 25 mL Schlenk flask, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (61.2 mg, 0.1 mmol), L4 (60.0 mg, 0.2 mmol), a stirring bar, and anhydrous THF (6.0 mL) were added inside an argon-filled glovebox. The flask was sealed with a rubber septum and then taken out from the glovebox. Subsequently, the flask was placed inside an oil bath and the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 12 h. After the flask was cooled to ambient temperature, the resulting suspension was concentrated via a rotary evaporator and subjected to column chromatography (neutral alumina, eluent: petroleum ether/dichloromethane = 1:1) to afford pure [Ru-4] (80.0 mg, 0.15 mmol) in 75% yield. In a similar way, [Ru-6] (74.7 mg, 0.14 mmol) and [Ru-7] (71.8 mg, 0.12 mmol) were obtained in 70% and 60% yield, respectively."
5,General procedure for the Ru-catalyzed synthesis of carboxylic acids from alcohols and KOH,"2.4 General procedure for the Ru-catalyzed synthesis of carboxylic acids from alcohols and KOH 2.4.1 A typical reaction under the optimized reaction condition To a 25 mL Schlenk flask, an NHC-Ru complex (one of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], 1.56 μmol), an alcohol (25 mmol), KOH (1.68 g, 30 mmol), a stirring bar, and m-xylene (3.0 mL) were added. The flask was equipped with a reflux condenser, and the reaction mixture was stirred at a refluxing temperature in open air. After the assigned reaction period, the flask was cooled to room temperature. Water (10 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL) were added, and the two layers were separated. The organic layer was collected, and the aqueous layer was further extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL). Subsequently, the organic layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4, concentrated via a rotary evaporator, dried with a vacuum pump to afford the unreacted alcohol, which was weighed to obtain its yield. Afterwards, 3 N HCl (around 12 mL) was added to the aqueous layer, which was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4, concentrated and dried to afford the desired carboxylic acid, which was weighed to determine its yield. 2.4.2 Special notes for the coupling of 1f, 1g or 1s with KOH For the reaction of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol (1f) or 4-trifluorobenzyl alcohol (1g) with KOH, a mixture of 2f and 2a (or 2g and 2g′) was obtained. The yield of 2f and 2a (or 2g and 2g′) was obtained from the ratio of the two compounds, which was calculated by their respective characteristic peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. For the isolation of 6-aminocaproic acid (2s), a literature procedure was utilized [41]. 2.4.3 Effect of catalyst loadings An analogous procedure with the typical reaction was used, and the variations were listed as follows: For 62.5 ppm of a Ru complex, no variation. For 125 ppm of a Ru complex, an NHC-Ru complex (one of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], 1.56 μmol), an alcohol (12.5 mmol), KOH (0.84 g, 15.0 mmol) and m-xylene (3.0 mL) were applied. For 250 ppm of a Ru complex, an NHC-Ru complex (one of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], 1.56 μmol), an alcohol (6.25 mmol), KOH (0.414 g, 7.5 mmol) and m-xylene (1.5 mL) were applied. 2.4.4 Effect of reaction temperatures An analogous procedure with the typical reaction was used, and the variation was listed as follows: a different temperature (100 ℃, 120 ℃, 145 ℃ or 165 ℃). 2.4.5 Effect of reaction time An analogous procedure with the typical reaction was used, and the variation was listed as follows: different reaction time (1 h, 2 h, 4 h or 12 h). 2.4.6 Effect of different solvents An analogous procedure with the typical reaction was used, and the variation was listed as follows: a different solvent (THF, dioxane, toluene, m-xylene or mesitylene) at its respective refluxing temperature. 2.4.7 Determination of TONs and TOFs An analogous procedure with the typical reaction was used, and the variations were listed as follows: an NHC-Ru complex (one of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], 1.56 μmol), an alcohol (62.5 mmol), KOH (7.00 g, 125 mmol), m-xylene (5.0 mL), 1 h or 36 h. 2.4.8 NMR studies To a screw-capped NMR tube was added an NHC-Ru complex (one of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], 0.01 mmol), benzyl alcohol (1a, 5 μL, 0.05 mmol), KOH (3.3 mg, 0.06 mmol) and toluene-d 8 (0.6 mL), and the NMR tube was heated at reflux at different time invervals to record the corresponding 1H NMR spectra."
6,X-ray crystallography,"2.5 X-ray crystallography The single crystal sample was obtained via slow evaporation of petroleum ether into a solution of [Ru-4] ([Ru-6] or [Ru-7]) in chloroform. Diffraction data of these three orthometallated NHC-Ru complexes were collected with MoKα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. Moreover, numerical absorption corrections were applied, and the structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Protons were refined at the calculated positions using a riding model. The supplementary crystallographic data of [Ru-4], [Ru-6] and [Ru-7] (with the deposition numbers of 2097684, 2097689 and 2097691, respectively) could be accessible from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)."
7,Results and discussion,"As the most active complex in our previous study [41], [Ru-1] was initially prepared. With an aim to have a systematic investigation for the effect of ancillary NHC ligands on the catalytic performance, various substituents were introduced at different positions to tweak the electronic/steric profile of the resulting NHC ligands, which afforded the formation of [Ru-2]-[Ru-7] (as shown in Fig. 2). Originated from [Ru-1], employment of an electron-donating (Me) or electron-withdrawing (NO2) group on the phenyl ring of the NHC ligand resulted in [Ru-2] or [Ru-3]. To tune the steric profile of the NHC ligand in [Ru-1], replacement of the Me group in one N terminus with Et or iPr led to [Ru-4] or [Ru-5]. Moreover, structural modification through the introduction of an electron-rich (Me) or electron-poor (Br) substituent on the backbone of the imidazole framework was also performed to afford [Ru-6] or [Ru-7]. It was worth noting that [Ru-4], [Ru-6] and [Ru-7] (three new complexes) were unambiguously authenticated with X-ray crystallography (Fig. S1 of the Supporting Information). After the above-mentioned complexes bearing distinct electronic and steric properties were obtained, we probed the effects of ligand tuning and a few other parameters in catalytic ADC of alcohols and KOH, with the synthesis of benzoic acid (2a) from benzyl alcohol (1a) and KOH being selected as a model reaction ( Fig. 3). At the beginning, the catalytic activity of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] at varying Ru loadings was evaluated (Fig. 3a). It appeared that comparable results were obtained for each complex regardless of the utilized Ru loading (250, 125, or 62.5 ppm). It was also noticed that the solvent volume did influence the reaction efficiency (as shown in Fig. S2 of the Supporting Information). Therefore, an ultralow Ru loading (62.5 ppm) was enough to achieve gram-scale production of 2a in a facile and efficient manner, and this loading was used for further investigations. Next, the effect of reaction temperatures was assessed (Fig. 3b). It was found that 100–120 ℃ could not efficiently promote this reaction, while 145 ℃ could provide satisfactory results. However, an even higher temperature (165 ℃) led to lower yield of 2a for all the complexes, probably due to the stability issue at such a high temperature. Hence, 145 ℃ was found as an ideal temperature. Subsequently, the effect of reaction time was tested (Fig. 3c). Expectedly, the yield of 2a gradually increased from 1 h to 12 h for all the investigated complexes. Finally, the effect of different solvents was studied at their respective refluxing temperatures (Fig. 3d). To gain more insight into the activity difference among the seven complexes, determination of turnover numbers (TONs) and turnover frequencies (TOFs) was carried out (as listed in Table 1). The results indicated that [Ru-1], [Ru-3], [Ru-4], [Ru-5] and [Ru-7] exhibited comparable TONs and TOFs at either 1 h or 36 h (entries 1, 3–5, 7). For [Ru-6], it displayed comparable or even higher TON and TOF values at 1 h, but provided lower values at 36 h (entry 6 vs entries 1, 3–5, 7). In addition, [Ru-2] gave rise to lower TONs and TOFs at both time intervals (entry 2 vs entries 1, 3–5, 7). With regard to the effect of ligand tuning for the synthesis of 2a, the results from Fig. 3 and Table 1 indicated the approximate order of catalytic activity: [Ru-1]≈[Ru-3]≈[Ru-4]≈[Ru-5]≈[Ru-7]>[Ru-6]>[Ru-2]. Furthermore, several control experiments were carried out (as listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information). These results indicated that no Ru or no KOH was not effective for the acid formation (entries 2–3). Besides, argon atmosphere produced acid 2a in similar yield with air atmosphere (entry 4 vs. entry 1), which further indicated that this coupling was an ADC-mediated process. To have a clearer understanding about the catalytic potency of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7], other aromatic alcohols were also attempted (as shown in Fig. 4). It seemed that the substituent position on the phenyl ring did affect the reaction efficiency. Compared with 1a, 2-methylbenzyl alcohol (1b) provided product 2b in lower yield (probably due to steric hindrance), while 3-methylbenzyl alcohol (1c) afforded acid 2c in comparable yield. To our surprise, the reactivity of 4-methylbenzyl alcohol (1d) under our typical reaction conditions was comparable with 1b, which delivered product 2d in merely 60–70% yield. This observation was quite different with that derived from the reported Ru-based catalytic systems [34,38,40–44]. To provide more convincing reasons for the reactivity difference between 1c and 1d, the [Ru-1]-catalyzed reactions of 1c or 1d with KOH were performed at different reaction time. As shown in Fig. S3 of the Supporting Information, the yield of 2c was merely 14% after 0.5 h, whereas that of 2d was 30% after the same period. It was worth mentioning that the reaction mixture for 2c was still efficiently stirred, while that for 2d was hardly stirrable (Fig. S3a). As the reaction time was elongated, the yield of 2c was rapidly enhanced (51% after 1.5 h, 78% after 6 h, and 93% after 12 h) since the substances in this coupling was efficiently interacted (Fig. S3b-d). In contrast, the yield of 2d was slowly enhanced as time went on (37% after 1.5 h, 56% after 6 h and 70% after 12 h), probably due to the insufficient interaction of the substrates and catalysts (Fig. S3b-d). Expectedly, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (1e) demonstrated similar reactivity with 1a. Apart from electron-rich benzyl alcohols, the electron-deficient counterparts (1f and 1g) were also examined, which afforded a mixture of expected product 2f (or 2g), dehalogenated acid 2a [or p-(difluoromethyl)benzoic acid (2g′)] and unreacted alcohol 1f (or 1g). Since this transformation is a dehydrogenative process, the coupling of an alcohol and a hydroxide generally leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid and two molecules of H2. For halogen-containing alcohols, it has been well-documented that they are prone to undergo dehalogenation in the presence of the generated H2 and a metal-based catalyst [24,28,41]. In addition, other electron-deficient alcohols including 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (1h), 4-cyanobenzyl alcohol (1i), and 4-fomylbenzyl alcohol (1j) were attempted. Unfortunately, these substrates demonstrated rather limited reactivity under our catalytic conditions. For alcohol 1h, expected acid 2h was obtained in 18–25% yield. With regard to alcohols 1i and 1j, no expected products (2i and 2j) were delivered. Instead, the Ru-catalyzed reactions of 1i and KOH delivered acid 2i’ in 28–35% yield, via the hydrolysis of -CN into -COOH. For the reactions of 1j and KOH, a mixture of 2i’ and 2j’ was obtained since the formyl group was proven as a more reactive group than the alcoholic group [30]. Moreover, treatment of alcohol 1k, 1l or 1m (piperonyl alcohol) with KOH delivered desired product 2k, 2l or 2m in low to moderate yield. Overall, the activity trend of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] for most aromatic alcohols is identical as that for 1a. The special cases are the less reactive alcohols (1f-1h), for which no obvious order of activity could be found for [Ru-1]-[Ru-7]. On the other hand, a few aliphatic alcohols were also investigated (as outlined in Table 2). Sterically nonhindered alcohols including 3-phenylpropan-1-ol (1n), 1-hexanol (1o), cyclohexylmethanol (1p) and cyclopentylmethanol (1q) reacted smoothly with KOH to furnish aliphatic acid products 2n-2q in decent yield (80–96%). In addition, heterocycle-containing substrate 1r and amino alcohol 1s were also tested, leading to products 2r and 2s in moderate to high yield. It was worth noting that no formation of lactam 2s′ was observed for the coupling of 1s and KOH, as evidenced from the overlapped 1H NMR spectra of the crude mixture, 2s and 2s′ (as depicted in Fig. S4 of the Supporting Information). The activity order of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] for these aliphatic alcohols follows the trend of [Ru-1]≈[Ru-3]≈[Ru-4]≈[Ru-5]≈[Ru-7]>[Ru-6]>[Ru-2], which is in accordance with that for most aromatic alcohols. Finally, competitive studies between benzyl alcohol (1a) and 1-hexanol (1o) were carried out at several time intervals (as shown in Fig. S5 of the Supporting Information), which indicated that aromatic alcohols were generally more reactive than aliphatic alcohols. To rationalize the activity tendency of the seven complexes, we sought to carry out additional experiments. In our previous study, we monitored the generation and transformation of Ru hydride species (which have been postulated as active species for this transformation) via NMR studies in which 1H NMR spectra at different time intervals were recorded for a refluxing mixture of [Ru-1], benzyl alcohol, KOH and toluene-d 8 [41]. Accordingly, analogous NMR reactions for the other six complexes ([Ru-2]-[Ru-6]) were also performed (as shown in Fig. 5). A small peak at − 9.37 ppm appeared after 5 min for [Ru-2], but the intensity of this peak gradually diminished until disappearance spanning from 5 min to 720 min (Fig. 5a). For [Ru-3], [Ru-4], [Ru-5] and [Ru-7], a few hydride species were clearly detectable even after 720 min (Fig. 5b-d, f), which was similar with the observation for [Ru-1] (as shown in the Supporting Information of our previous work [41]). As for [Ru-6], clear hydride peaks were seen within 300 min, which was in good correlation with the other Ru complexes except [Ru-2] (Fig. 5e). However, the spectra became messy from 600 min onwards since many traces of hydride resonances were detected. As a whole, [Ru-1], [Ru-3], [Ru-4], [Ru-5] and [Ru-7] demonstrated similar phenomenon, so it was understandable that they exhibited comparable catalytic performance for most alcohol substrates. Probably, the worst performance of [Ru-2] under all the circumstances could be attributed to the shorter-lived key intermediates (Ru hydride species) relative to the other Ru complexes. For [Ru-6], the generated Ru hydride species appeared to be stable during the initial moments, but started to decompose at the prolonged periods. This new finding could explain the reason for the results in Fig. 3c and entry 6 of Table 1 ([Ru-6] have relatively good results for shorter reaction times, but worse results for longer reaction periods). Based on the observed hydride peaks, along with our previous article [41] and some related papers [16,34,42,44], we proposed a possible catalytic cycle for this process (as shown in Fig. 6). Initially, a mixture of an NHC-Ru complex, alcohol 1 and KOH delivers Ru-alkoxide species I, water and KI. Subsequently, I is prone to undergo a β-hydride elimination to generate a Ru hydride (II), which reacts with KOH to provide intermediate III and H2. Moreover, another β-hydride elimination occurs to give another Ru hydride intermediate IV, followed by ligand change with 1 to furnish the desired potassium carboxylates and Ru hydride species V. Ultimately, intermediate V evolves H2 to regenerate intermediate I so that the whole catalytic cycle was fulfilled. Specifically, three major hydride peaks (approximately −9.4, −9.2 and −7.8 ppm) were observed for most of the seven complexes (as depicted in Fig. 5). It appeared that the peak at around − 9.4 ppm was gradually transformed into the one at about − 9.2 ppm, which was further converted into the hydride resonance at approximately − 7.8 ppm. Presumably, these three hydride shifts were assigned as intermediates II, IV and V, respectively. With the above investigations in hand, it was concluded that the activity order of the seven Ru complexes was generally observed as [Ru-1]≈[Ru-3]≈[Ru-4]≈[Ru-5]≈[Ru-7]>[Ru-6]>[Ru-2] for most aromatic and aliphatic alcohols. Next, we sought to understand the effect of structural modification at different sites, which was summarized in Fig. 7. Regardless of the different groups (Me, Et and iPr) at site X, minimum effect on the catalytic performance of the resulting Ru complexes was found. For either site Y or Z, an electron-donating group (Me) was detrimental for this catalytic process, as it resulted in lower activity than an unsubstituted (H) or electron-withdrawing group (Br or NO2). It is well known that Huynh’s electronic parameter (HEP), the 13C NMR resonance of NHCcarbene signals, has been utilized to evaluate the electronic nature of NHC ligands [48,55,56]. Generally, NHC ligands exhibiting electron-donating properties have relatively upfield signals for the carbene carbon atoms. Accordingly, the 13Ccarbene-NMR signals of the selected complexes ([Ru-1]-[Ru-3], [Ru-6]-[Ru-7]) were outlined in Table 3. At either site Y or Z, an electron-withdrawing group (NO2 or Br, entries 3 and 6) exhibited higher 13Ccarbene-NMR chemical shifts than an H atom (entry 1) and an electron-donating group (Me, entries 2 and 5), which indicated that the electron-donating ability of the corresponding NHC ligands followed the trend of [Ru-2]>[Ru-1]>[Ru-3] and [Ru-6]>[Ru-1]>[Ru-7]. To have a better understanding about the distinct catalytic performance of the seven complexes during the dehydrogenation process, the following two aspects were discussed. Firstly, it has been reported that a Ru complex bearing an electron-deficient NHC ligand could promote transformation of a Ru halide species (intermediate I in Fig. 6) into the corresponding Ru alkoxide species (intermediate II in Fig. 6) more rapidly owing to the relatively low electron density on the Ru center [44,58]. Therefore, this could be one possible reason why the electron-withdrawing groups were better than the electron-donating counterparts at the Y or Z site (activity order: [Ru-3]>[Ru-2]; [Ru-7]>[Ru-6]). Secondly, the stability of key Ru hydride species should be another pivotal factor. As seen from Fig. 5, detection of the short-lived Ru hydride species for [Ru-2] at all monitored moments and decomposition of key Ru hydride species for [Ru-6] at the prolonged periods also account for the activity order of [Ru-3]>[Ru-2] and [Ru-7]>[Ru-6]. Altogether, both electronic/steric properties of an ancillary ligand and the stability of key Ru hydride species should be considered for further ligand study on alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. To reveal the green and sustainable levels of the present study, quantitative green metrics [59–62] such as atom economy (AE), carbon efficiency (CE), reaction mass efficiency (RME), mass intensity (MI), mass productivity (MP), and E-factor were calculated. Initially, calculation for the current protocol applying [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] was performed (as listed in Table S2 of the Supporting Information), and the [Ru-1]-based catalytic system was selected as a typical example to compare with the representative Ru-based catalytic systems in the literature ( Table 4). Identical AE values were obtained for all the catalytic systems since the same reaction was applied, while 100% of CE values were determined in all the cases as the entire carbon atoms were incorporated into the desired product. Subsequently, calculation of RME values revealed comparable or substantially higher efficiency of our [Ru-1]-based catalytic system over literature systems. For the mass-related parameters (MI and MP) and E-factor, the current catalytic system exhibited considerably better results in comparison with the typical references. Based on these findings, we envisaged that our catalytic systems were relatively greener and more sustainable than the reported Ru-based ones. Furthermore, comparison with the reported catalytic systems based on other transition metals also demonstrated the superiority of our systems ( Table 5). In a word, these results inferred that this work outperformed related literature reports in terms of greenness and sustainability."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, we designed and prepared seven orthometallated Ru complexes comprising distinct C NHC C bidentate NHC ligands, denoted as [Ru-1]-[Ru-7]. Introduction of various substituents at three modification sites was performed to understand the influence of ligand tuning on the catalytic potency of these NHC-Ru complexes. In addition, a few parameters such as Ru loadings, reaction temperatures & time, the utilized solvents were evaluated. Besides, the catalytic activity of [Ru-1]-[Ru-7] for different alcohol substrates was also examined. These results illustrated that the general order of activity followed [Ru-1]≈[Ru-3]≈[Ru-4]≈[Ru-5]≈[Ru-7]>[Ru-6]>[Ru-2], and additional investigations provided rationales for this order. In view of greenness and sustainable levels, this work showed advantages over related works in the literature, as evidenced by evaluation of quantitative green metrics."
