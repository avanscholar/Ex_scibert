0,Introduction,"The exploitation of raw materials depends on the time and scale limitations of the primary industry. Benzaldehyde (BAL) is an important industrial chemical as it is used as a raw material for a wide range of applications (e.g., in pharmaceutical, agricultural and fragrance industries) [1]. The main industrial process for the synthesis of benzaldehyde consists in the air-oxidation of toluene. The process requires high temperature and pressure, uses homogeneous metal-based catalysts and gives low yield and selectivity due to the formation of a variety of by-products [1,2]. Selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) appears as an interesting alternative to the conventional production method, form both economic and environmental standpoints. The process is selective in the sense that the oxidation is only partial, preventing the formation of benzylic acid or other over oxidized products. The photocatalytic process can be carried out under mild conditions of pressure and temperature using benign heterogeneous catalysts that are activated by light [3]. In addition, the process uses water as solvent (as opposed to the typical halogenated hydrocarbons) and does not require any added oxidants which are typically hazardous (generating heavy-metal wastes). The possibility of using solar light in chemical reactions has long been envisaged, owing to the sun’s enormous potential as clean, renewable, and economical source of energy [4]. Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda on photoelectrocatalytic water splitting using TiO2 as catalyst, an enormous attention has been put in the use of this semiconductor material in photocatalytic applications, such as hydrogen production, CO2 reduction into fuels, water remediation and organic synthesis [5–9]. Yet, due to the high oxidation potential of valence band holes (+2.7V vs. NHE, pH=7), TiO2 easily drives the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO ) through direct oxidation of hydroxide ions resulting from water autoionization. The unselective nature of the HO radical, which can drive the oxidation of several organic compounds until their complete mineralization into H2O and CO2, is a draw back when the aim is to develop selective photocatalytic oxidation processes. Thus, the investigation of semiconductor materials with lower valence band potentials is crucial, and a hot topic of research, in photocatalytic organic synthesis. Carbon nitride (C3N4) has been attracting much attention in a variety of catalytic applications [10–12]. This polymeric material may be regarded as “doped” graphite in which carbon atoms are regularly substituted by nitrogen atoms [11,13]. Graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4), is the most stable allotrope at ambient conditions [14–16]. g-C3N4 can be synthesized via thermal polymerization of nitrogen-rich precursors, such as urea, thiourea, cyanamide, dicyandiamide, or melamine [17]. Due to its relatively narrow bandgap (2.7eV), g-C3N4 can be photoexcited using visible light. Moreover, the positions of the valence and conduction bands (+1.4V and −1.3V vs. NHE at pH=7, respectively) make this material appropriate for selective photocatalytic organic synthesis [18–20]. The main bottlenecks for the application of g-C3N4 in photocatalytic processes are the low surface area and the fast recombination of electrons and holes upon photo-excitation [21]. Various strategies have been used for improving the photoefficiency of g-C3N4 such as molecular doping, dye-sensitization and combination with other semiconductor materials [22–24]. The conversion of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes has been previously reported using several carbon nitride based materials such as mesoporous g-C3N4, metal organic framework/g-C3N4 and CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, carbon dots-doped g-C3N4, etc. [21,25–27]. In a previous work by our group, we used noble metal loading to increase the efficiency of bare g-C3N4 towards the conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde [19]. In the present work, our intention was to develop metal-free photocatalysts with improved performances, when compared to bulk g-C3N4, using easy-implemented techniques. An effective procedure used for boosting g-C3N4 activity without adding any other phase is by layer separation and/or etching to form nanosheets, which can be achieved following thermal, chemical and/or mechanical procedures [28–31]. In the present work, bulk g-C3N4 was produced by thermal decomposition of dicyandiamide and subjected to different post-treatments using varying annealing temperatures, ball-milling time and acids (i.e. thermal, mechanical and chemical post-treatments, respectively). The main objective was to seek an increase in the surface area and in the charge separation efficiency. The synthesized catalysts were tested for the selective conversion of BA into BAL in aqueous medium under UV-LED radiation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dicyandiamide (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as precursor for the synthesis of bulk g-C3N4. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sulfuric acid, (H2SO4, 95–98%), nitric acid (HNO3, >65%), benzyl alcohol (≥99%), and benzaldehyde (≥99%), all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, were used as received. Sodium hydrogen phosphate (≥99.0%, Fluka Analytical), phosphoric acid (85%, Fisher Scientific UK) and ultra-pure water (Direct-Q Millipore system) were used for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)."
3,Synthesis of bulk g-C3N4,"2.2 Synthesis of bulk g-C3N4 The synthesis of g-C3N4 was performed by thermal decomposition of dicyandiamide. The precursor was placed in a semi-closed crucible in a muffle furnace (Naberthern, P330) under air atmosphere. The equipment was programed to heat at a 2°Cmin−1 ramp until 450°C, this temperature being maintained during 2h followed by heating until 550°C, which was maintained during 4h. After cooling down, the material was powdered in a mortar, rinsed with ultra-pure water, filtered to remove any soluble by-products, and dried overnight at 100°C. 2.2.1 Chemical post-treatment The procedure used for the acid modification of g-C3N4 was based on previous works, which reported enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for photocatalytic H2 production, pollutant degradation, and aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in organic solvent medium [32–34]. Briefly, 0.5g of g-C3N4 was added to 10 mL of acid (12.2M HCl, 18.1M H2SO4 or 14.4M HNO3) and stirred for 8h. After that, 100mL of water was added and the suspension was sonicated at 0.5cycle and 60% of amplitude during 10min (ultrasonic processor Hielscher UP 400S, 24kHz). Finally, the treated catalysts were rinsed with ultra-pure water and dried overnight at 100°C. Depending on the acid used the materials were labelled accordingly as CHCl, CH2SO4 or CHNO3. 2.2.2 Mechanical post-treatment Mechanical treatment was carried out using a ball mill (Retsch GmbH, MM 200), by placing 0.5g of bulk g-C3N4 in a capsule containing 2 zirconia balls. The capsule was then fixed in the equipment and agitated at 20 rps for 1.5, 3.0 or 8.0h. The resulting catalysts were designated as M1.5, M3 and M8 with the subscript indicating the time (in hours) used for ball milling. 2.2.3 Thermal post-treatment Thermal modification of g-C3N4 was performed at different temperatures: 400, 450 and 500°C. For that, 1g of catalyst was homogeneously spread in an open crucible inside a muffle furnace that was programmed to heat at 2°Cmin−1 until the established temperature, which was kept during 2h. The resulting materials were named T400, T450 and T500 according to the temperature used for the thermal treatment."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques The synthesized materials were characterized by diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectrophotometry (DR UV–vis) in a Jasco V-560 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (Jasco ISV-469). DR UV–vis spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode and converted to equivalent absorption Kubelka–Munk units. Indirect band gap of the photocatalysts was extracted from the respective Tauc plots using (KM.hν)1/2 as a function of the energy (eV) [35]. Solid state photoluminescence spectra (PL spectra) were obtained using a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-8300) with a 150 W Xenon lamp as light source. Measurements were performed using both excitation and emission bandwidth fixed at 2.5nm. The excitation wavelength was set at 370nm and the emission was measured in the 380–700nm range. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of the photocatalysts was calculated from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196°C obtained in a Quantachrome Nova 4200e apparatus. The morphology of the materials was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI Quanta 400FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4M instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a LEO 906E instrument operating at 120kV, equipped with a 4M pixel 28×28mm CCD camera from TRS. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in a PANalytical X’Pert MPD instrument equipped with a X’Celerator detector and secondary monochromator (Cu Kα λ=0.154nm, 50kV, 40mA; data recorded at a 0.017° step size, 100s/step). Elemental analysis was performed using an Elementar Vario MICRO cube equipment. Contact angle measurements were performed using an Attension optical tensiometer (model Theta). The analysis was carried out to evaluate the hydrophobicity of the catalysts using sessile drop method and water at room temperature. The powder catalysts were pressed to obtain thin pellets and the analysis was repeated to confirm three concordant measurements. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements (4000–600cm−1) were performed on a JASCO FT/IR-6800 spectrometer (JASCO Analytical Instruments, USA) equipped with a MIRacle™ Single Reflection ATR (attenuated total reflectance ZnSe crystal plate) accessory (PIKE Technologies, USA). The acquisition performed using 128 scans and resolution was set to 4cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) was carried out in a Kratos AXIS Ultra HAS equipment and Al monochromator operating at 15kV (90W) in hybrid mode."
5,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiments The selective photocatalytic conversion of BA into BAL was performed in a glass photoreactor, filled with 28mL of BA solution (1.5mM) and 28mg of catalyst. The system was purged with argon (5mLmin−1 flow) under dark conditions during 15min. After that period, the argon flow was maintained and irradiation was initiated using a UV-LED emitting at 392nm. Light intensity reaching the reactor was approximately 456Wm−2, determined by using a UV–Vis spectroradiometer (USB2000+, OceanOptics, USA). Samples were periodically withdrawn for determination of BA and BAL concentration by HPLC. The conversion (C) of BA, yield (Y) of BAL and selectivity (S) were determined as function of the initial concentration of BA ([BA]0 in mM), and the concentrations of BA and BAL ([BA] and [BAL] in mM, respectively) at a given time during the photocatalytic reaction: (1) C ( % ) = [ BA ] 0 - [ BA ] [ BA ] 0 × 100 % (2) Y ( % ) = [ BAL ] [ BA ] 0 × 100 % (3) S ( % ) = [ BAL ] [ BA ] 0 - [ BA ] × 100 %"
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques The concentration of BA and BAL was determined by HPLC using a Hitachi Elite LaChrom system equipped with a diode array detector (L-2450), a solvent delivery pump (L-2130) and a Purospher Star RP-18 endcapped column (250mm×4.6mm, 5μm particles). An isocratic method was set at a flow rate of 0.5mLmin−1 during 16min using 20mM NaH2PO4, adjusted to pH 3.2 with phosphoric acid (A) and methanol (B) with a proportion of A:B equal to 30:70."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization The morphology of the synthesized materials was analysed by SEM and TEM. Micrographs of selected samples (Fig. 1 ) reveal distinct morphologies depending on the post-treatment applied to g-C3N4. The bulk material is constituted by g-C3N4 sheets assembled as compact aggregates, which result from the stacking of g-C3N4 layers (Fig. 1a and e) and resulting in a material with extremely low SBET (4m2 g−1, Table 1 ). The typical SBET values of g-C3N4 reported in literature are normally lower than 15m2 g−1 [36,37]. The chemical post-treatments are expected to weaken the interaction of g-C3N4 layers and separate them due to the exothermic effect resulting from adding concentrated acid and applying sonication. However, the materials obtained by direct treatment with concentrated acids are very compact, with defects being created in the g-C3N4 structure, as can be visualized in Fig. 1b for CH2SO4 . This compact structure suggests the reassembling of the exfoliated g-C3N4 sheets, the SBET being just slightly higher (up to 17m2 g−1) than that determined for the bulk material (Table 1), as also reported by Cheng et al. [32]. These authors suggest that both carboxyl and amino groups are created by the chemical treatment with H2SO4, and are responsible for the amphoteric behaviour of the resulting material. At low pH (between 2.0 and 5.0), amino groups get protonated (NH3 +) while carboxyl groups remain neutral (COOH). On the other hand, at high pH (between 9.0 and 11.0), NH2 and COO– groups occur at the surface of the material. Under these extreme pH conditions, the material forms colloidal suspensions, suggesting the separation of the g-C3N4 layers. At near to neutral pH (between 6.0 and 8.0), the suspension of the acid-treated material gets unstable due to the electrostatic reassembling of the g-C3N4 layers, which is probably what occurs after rinsing the materials until neutral pH. After ball milling, the catalysts consist of smaller particle aggregates, as can be visualized in Fig. 1c for the material treated during 1.5h (M1.5). Yet, the mechanical post-treatments didn’t produce any increase in the SBET when compared to the starting g-C3N4 material (Table 1). The thermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 promotes the exfoliation of the material due to simultaneous layer-by-layer thermal oxidation and layer splitting [38]. The stacking interactions between g-C3N4 layers are mainly driven by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are not stable at high temperatures, thus occurring the exfoliation into thinner plates (Fig. 1d and f). This process leads to an increase in the surface area of the resulting materials, reaching values up to 87m2 g−1 for the material obtained at 500°C (T500), contrasting with the SBET of 4m2 g−1 obtained for the starting material (Table 1). Visual analysis (see Supplementary Information, Fig. SD1) of samples with the same weight (50mg) of bulk g-C3N4, CH2SO4 , M1.5 and T500 shows that the treatment with sulfuric acid resulted in a denser material than bulk g-C3N4, while the treatment at 500°C (T500) results in a material almost with the double volume due to the separation of g-C3N4 sheets. The denser the material, the stronger is the assembling of the C3N4 layers, which is induced by the chemical post-treatment, as discussed above. The material obtained after ball milling during 1.5h (M1.5) has a similar density to that of the starting material. These observations in density correlate with the surface area of these materials (Table 1), which was similar in the case of the mechanically treated samples, but was significantly increased after thermal treatment of g-C3N4. It can also be noticed that the yellow colour became paler after treating the bulk-material, which may be indicative of a narrower visible light absorption range. In the XRD pattern of selected catalysts (Fig. 2 a) is clear the presence of a strong diffraction peak at 2θ≈27.6°, characteristic of the inter-layer staking of the conjugated aromatic C3N4 units, identified as the (002) peak of graphitic materials [39]. The intensity of the (002) diffraction peak decreased significantly for all the post-treated samples, which indicated that the interlayer structure of g-C3N4 was modified [40]. Moreover, a peak at 2θ≈13.0°, assigned to the (100) in-plane structure motif of tri-s-triazine polymeric units (JPCDS No. 87-1526), is observed for all samples, with exception of the chemically treated one, which is probably due to the creation of defects in the crystalline arrangement of g-C3N4 [30,38,41,42]. FTIR-ATR spectra of selected materials are represented in Fig. 2b. All post-treated materials present the same absorption bands observed for bulk g-C3N4, implying that the triazine-based chemical structure is preserved. In all spectra, four main regions can be identified: (I) at 3160cm−1, corresponding to NH and NH2 stretching vibrations of primary and secondary amines; [42] (II) 1623cm−1 and 1540cm−1, indicating the presence of CN stretching vibrations; (III) the aromatic CN stretching peaking at 1397cm−1, 1314cm−1 and 1227cm−1 [41,43]; and (IV) the peak at 803cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of CN heterocycles of triazine ring [44]. The chemical composition and chemical states on the surface of g-C3N4 and T500 catalysts were analysed by XPS analysis and the C1s and N1s spectra are represented in Fig. 3 . The C1s spectrum of g-C3N4 (Fig. 3a) shows 4 main peaks. The weak peak centred at 293.8eV (C1) corresponds to the π electron delocalization in C3N3 heterocycles [45]. The C2 peak located at a binding energy of 288.5eV, denotes the major carbon environment in the catalyst, indicating the presence of sp 2-bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (NC N) [46–48]. XPS survey (not shown) indicates that the g-C3N4 catalyst is constituted by 43.24% of carbon, the main contribution (35.96%) being related to C2 type of bonds. The C3 peak, located at 288.5eV, is related to the sp 3-bonded defects on the g-C3N4 surface, as amino functional groups (CNH2) [46–48]. Finally, a C4 peak at 285.0eV was identified for both materials attributed to C(-N)3 planar trigonal carbon geometry [45]. Analysis of g-C3N4 N1s spectrum shows four main peaks (Fig. 3c). The N1 peak located at 405.0eV can be assigned to the presence of NO2 terminal groups and/or to the positive charge localization in heterocycles and cyano group [46,47]. Amino functional groups are confirmed by the presence of a N2 peak at 401.4eV. The N3 peak at 399.9eV reflects the presence of tertiary N in N-(C)3 units, confirming the polymerization of the dicyandiamide polymerization into g-C3N4. The N4 peak predominant in the N1s spectrum is located at 398.9eV, corresponding to the sp 2-bonded nitrogen involved in the triazine ring CNC [45–49]. Although being surface analysis techniques, FTIR-ATR spectra and XPS profiles (Fig. 3) didn’t show any evidence of the presence of CN groups, characteristic of dicyandiamide. Since exfoliated materials are constituted by few layer carbon nitride, these results suggest that most of the precursor was converted into g-C3N4. The atomic percentages of C and N regions of T500 are similar to the values of bulk g-C3N4, indicating that the thermal treatment did not produce a change in the surface chemical composition (Fig. 3). The O1s spectrum was analysed for bulk g-C3N4, T500, M1.5 and CH2SO4 catalysts (Supplementary Information, Fig. SD2). A single peak located at 532.6±0.3eV (O1) is present in all samples and can be assigned to adsorbed H2O and/or to the presence of hydroxyl groups [47]. The M1.5 and CH2SO4 samples have an additional peak (O2) at 531.5±0.2eV, which could correspond to the presence of CO and carbonyl groups [46,50]. This indicates the possibility of using chemical and mechanical post-treatments for the introduction of oxygen functionalities into g-C3N4 surface. In the case of M1.5 catalyst, the presence of carbonyl groups was further confirmed by the occurrence of two peaks in the range of 288–290eV in C 1s region (not shown) [45]. The DR UV–vis spectra of all the synthesized materials are presented as Supplementary Information (Fig. SD3). The band gap energy values (Table 1) were obtained from the respective Tauc plots (Fig. 4 a–c). A slight increase in the bandgap of the post-treated materials was observed comparing with bulk g-C3N4. M8 and CHNO3 are those with higher band gap values (2.84eV), whereas thermal based catalysts have the lowest differences to bulk g-C3N4 (e.g., 2.73eV for T500 and 2.68eV for g-C3N4). To better characterize the optical properties of the synthesized materials, PL analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 4d–f. All PL spectra show a broad peak in the range 400–600nm, with two distinct bands: a very intense one peaking at around 450nm and a weaker band peaking at c.a. 525nm. The first corresponds to the emission of light as a result of direct interband electron–hole recombination, while the second one, with a much lower contribution, is a result of radiative recombination involving charge carriers captured by traps (structural defects) [51]. The wavelength at the maximum PL intensity is listed in Table 1. Significant changes are found on the peak position (all blue shifted) and intensity for most of the prepared catalysts in comparison to g-C3N4, the spectrum shape being maintained. The PLintensity of chemically treated materials increased in the following order: g-C3N4 ≈CH2SO4 <CHCl <CHNO3 . The CHNO3 catalyst shows significantly higher PL intensity than g-C3N4. A blue shift varying from 12 to 26nm was observed for the three chemically treated catalysts, CH2SO4 having the lowest and CHNO3 the highest shift (12 and 26nm, respectively). For the mechanically treated catalysts, the PL intensity increased as follows: M8 <g-C3N4 ≈M3 <M1.5. In addition, the PL spectra of M1.5 and M3 are similarly blue-shifted (c.a. 15nm) with respect to bulk g-C3N4, while for M8 this shift was of 24nm. From PL spectra of thermally treated catalysts, it is observed that the intensity of the PL bands of g-C3N4 and T400 are similar, while it increased for T450 and T500. The increase in PL intensity is attributed to the existence of defects in the C3N4 network, capable of acting as traps of charge carriers [51]. On the other hand, the observed blue shift on both, the bandgap and the PL spectra has been ascribed to a quantum confinement effect, shifting conduction and valence band edges in opposite directions [40,52,53]."
9,Selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde,"3.2 Selective conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde To test the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of the prepared materials, the differently activated g-C3N4 samples were used in the selective conversion of BA to BAL under UV-LED irradiation in unaerated aqueous solutions. Under these conditions, the reaction proceeds by direct oxidation of BA through photogenerated holes producing BAL. Simultaneously, H+ resulting from BA deprotonation, may be reduced by photogenerated electrons, H2 being released as (a valuable) by-product [19]. The activity was evaluated in terms of the conversion of the organic substrate, following the decrease of the normalized concentration of BA with time (Fig. 5 ). For the selectivity, the formation of BAL was monitored in terms of the increase in its concentration with time (Fig. 5). A pure photochemical reaction, in the absence of catalyst, was performed as a control experiment, with no measurable degradation of BA being observed in 240min, thus confirming the photostability of BA under the experimental conditions (392nm, 456Wm−2). The conversion of BA and the amount of BAL formed is significantly enhanced by the majority of the selected post-treatments (Fig. 5). Although chemical treatments did not influence severely the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5a), Fig. 6 a shows that slightly higher conversion and yield were found at 240min when using CH2SO4 (C =31%; Y =27%), contrasting with the results obtained with the bulk catalyst (C =18%; Y =17%). The photocatalytic improvement achieved with the CH2SO4 photocatalyst could be ascribed to the presence of oxygen species introduced by the treatment with H2SO4, as confirmed by XPS analysis, which have been reported to improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 photocatalysts by preventing electron-hole recombination [54]. Additionally, contact angle measurements with water (Supplementary Information, Fig. SD4) demonstrate a higher hydrophobicity for CH2SO4 (62.8°±0.4°) than for bulk g-C3N4 (39.6°±1.2°) and thus the chemical treatment might favour the contact of the catalyst surface with BA molecules rather than with H2O molecules. Moreover, CH2SO4 shows lower PL intensity and has lower band gap than CHNO3 and CHCl catalysts (Fig. 4a and d, respectively), which is in line with the enhanced photoefficiency of this material (Fig. 4a and d). Regarding the materials subjected to mechanical post-treatments, a positive effect in both C and Y was observed when comparing with bulk g-C3N4 (Figs. 5b and 6b). The best results were obtained for the catalysts produced after ball milling during 1.5h (C =44%; Y =36%). Yet, an increase in the mechanical treatment duration had a negative effect in the photoefficiency of BAL production (Fig. 6b), which may be related to a progressive change in the materials structure, thus modifying their electronic properties. In fact, although M8 produced a much less intense PL signal, it was the less efficient among the mechanically treated materials, suggesting that the suppression of electron-hole recombination is not likely to be the solely mechanism accounting for the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 catalysts. Similar to what occurs with the chemically treated samples, an increase in the hydrophobicity of the ball milled samples was observed (ex: 56.9°±1.1° for M1.5, Fig. SD3). A positive effect in conversion and yield was observed for the reactions using the thermally treated catalysts (Figs. 5c and 6c), with a progressive increase in photoefficiency of the process with the post-treatment temperature (26%, 47% and 66% of C, and 26%, 40% and 59% of Y for T400, T450, and T500, respectively). To correlate the reactivity with the structure of the used photocatalyst, it should be noticed that the band gap of this set of materials was not significantly affected (increasing from 2.68eV for bulk g-C3N4 to a maximum of 2.73eV for T500), while the PL intensity being higher for the catalysts obtained at higher temperatures. An increase in the hydrophobicity of the thermally treated materials was also confirmed (with a contact angle of 57.5°±0.8° for T500, Fig. SD3) similarly to the materials obtained after chemical and mechanical treatments. For most of the experiments, selectivity surpassed 80% with the exception of the reaction using in the presence of the photocatalyst CHNO3 for which only S=72% was attained (Fig. 6), showing that, in general, g-C3N4 based catalysts are highly selective, in partially oxidising BA into BAL under the mild reaction conditions used. Post-treatments, although increase activity and yield, have a slight negative effect on selectivity, which is more evident for the chemically treated samples (Fig. 6a), than for mechanically treated (Fig. 6b) or even for thermally treated catalysts (Fig. 6c). The values of selectivity were also compared at iso-conversion level (C =18%, the maximum conversion obtained using bulk g-C3N4). It was observed that the selectivity didn’t change significantly and that the same trend was observed when comparing these results with those obtained at the end of 240min (Supplementary Information, Fig. SD5). Among all the tested materials, T500 was the best performing catalyst. This enhanced photoefficiency can be mainly rationalized in terms of the larger surface area of this material (Table 1), resulting from the markedly separated layers of g-C3N4 (Fig. 1d). As discussed before the photocatalytic activity can be improved by post-treatments that led to g-C3N4 sheets with increased SBET. In the case of thermally post-treated catalysts, the treatment at 500°C promotes an increase of SBET up to 87m2 g- 1, resulting in an evident increase of C and Y at small expenses of S. Three consecutive runs were performed for the best performing photocatalyst, i.e. T500, the reusability being demonstrated (Fig. 6d). Y was similar after catalyst reuse, C slightly increasing (from 66% to 72%), contrasting with a decrease on S (90–81%). Yang et al. [55] reported that the irradiation of g-C3N4 suspensions can lead to some further exfoliation and therefore to an increase in the availability of active sites for adsorption and reaction, which can rationalize the increase in BA conversion into BAL, which is further oxidized into benzoic acid, leading to a decrease in selectivity. The same authors analysed the material by XRD after several utilizations and observed a decrease in the intensity of g-C3N4 peaks which are characteristic of inter layer stacking, supporting the assumption of possible exfoliation of reused g-C3N4. From the above results, it appears that the surface area of the g-C3N4 based materials plays a crucial role in the photoefficiency towards BAL production, which is particularly relevant in the case of the catalysts obtained by thermal exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 (Fig. 7 a). An increase in the SBET indicates the existence of a higher availability of active sites for BA adsorption and photocatalytic conversion to BAL. Moreover, the thin layered structure of the thermally treated materials is expected to reduce the pathway of electrons and holes to the solid-liquid interface, thus reducing the recombination of the charge carriers [54]. Yet, for the materials obtained by chemical and mechanical post-treatments, which present relatively low surface area (<20m2 g−1), the electronic properties of the resulting materials may play a major role in the photoefficiency of the catalytic process, as can be visualized in Fig. 7b, where an increase in the yield of BAL production was observed as the bandgap of chemically and mechanically treated materials progressively decreased. The present work shows the possibility of using facile and efficient techniques for boosting the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 towards the selective production of BAL from BA under mild conditions of pH and temperature, using a benign solvent (water) and a highly-efficient and low-cost irradiation source (UV-LED). The results obtained with the best photocatalyst (T500; C =66%, Y =59%, S =90%) surpassed the previously reported by our group using Ru-loaded on bulk g-C3N4 (C =56%, Y =42%, S =75%) under the same reaction conditions, which evidences the potential of this material for being used as metal-free photocatalyst for selective organic synthesis applications [19]."
10,Conclusions,"Benzyl alcohol can be selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde with good yields using g-C3N4 based photocatalysts, in aqueous solution, at natural pH (5.6) and upon 392nm UV-LED irradiation (UV-A blacklight). Morphological and chemical properties of bulk g-C3N4 are modified upon chemical, mechanical and thermal treatments to different extents, which are reflected on the photocatalytic properties of materials. The mechanical post-treatments resulted in the cleavage of bulk g-C3N4 into smaller particles. Both mechanical and chemical treatments introduced structural and chemical defects (oxygen functionalities) in g-C3N4, changing the electronic properties of the resulting materials. From a spectroscopic point of view, thermal treatments have a reduced effect on the band-gap energy of the prepared photocatalysts, while mechanical and chemical treatments widen-up the already large band-gap. This increase in the band gap has positive effect on the yield of formation of benzaldehyde keeping the selectivity of the process above 80%, which was attributed to the increase in the surface area of the resulting catalysts. The benzaldehyde yield was 3.4 times higher using T500 as catalyst, compared to bulk g-C3N4. The photocatalytic process may represent a valuable advantage for industrial production, since the catalysts are easy to produce, handle and recover. In addition, reutilization experiments evidenced the stability of this material under the tested conditions. The overall process uses water as reaction medium, therefore without the need of hazardous solvents or any added oxidants. Is a clean, safe and effective route for the conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde in non-corrosive conditions, with simultaneous generation of highly valuable H2 as by-product."
