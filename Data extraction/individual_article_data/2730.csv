0,Introduction,"The depletion of global fossil fuels and associated environmental problems are driving the need for the alternative forms of energy [1]. Combustion of hydrogen produces a high energy yield which is 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels [2], and only water as by-product, making it a highly efficient and non-pollutant energy alternative. Hydrogen production techniques include biological, photo-electrochemical and thermochemical processes. Electrochemical or thermochemical processes consume fossil fuel and electricity. They are energy intensive and not environmental friendly [3]. Biological hydrogen production is favoured on the basis of both economic and environmental concerns due to its low costs for process capital and operation [4]. The production of hydrogen by dark fermentation has attracted great attention recently because of its advantages for industrialization. It has very high evolution rate compared to photosynthetic hydrogen production, and is not limited by light and can produce hydrogen constantly [4]. Valuable by-products and biomass also make this application more favoured by commercialization [5,6]. Many renewable waste materials can be used as carbon sources for hydrogen production, including starch and cellulose-containing agricultural or food industry by-products and wastes, carbohydrate-rich industrial wastewaters and waste sludge from wastewater treatment plants [7,8]. Those applications not only produce hydrogen but also can be an environmental friendly waste treatment processes [9–11]. Many previous investigations focused on special waste materials in continuous processes with activated sludge, such as starch wastewater [12] and waste biosolids [13]. Recently, more researches have been afforded to isolation or gene modification of hydrogen producers [5,14,15]. However, a little information on how carbon and nitrogen sources impact on production of hydrogen and associated by-products in hydrogen fermentation is available in the literature. Considering that 30–40% of total production costs are associated with the substrates [16], detailed investigations on searching suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, and evaluating carbon and nitrogen concentrations in fermentation broth for certain bacterial hydrogen fermentation are clearly necessary. The relatively low yield of biological hydrogen production drove researchers focused on seeking highly yielded hydrogen-producing microorganisms, genetically modifying existing microorganisms, or optimizing fermentation process optimization [17–19]. Clostridia have been established as the main hydrogen-producing bacteria in many hydrogen production processes [20,21]. An earlier study from this laboratory has reported the isolation of a Clostridium butyricum W5, an efficient hydrogen producer, from hydrogen-producing activated sludge [15]. Objectives of this study were to select suitable carbon and nitrogen sources for hydrogen fermentation, including waste potato starch (WPS), molasses, glucose, NH4NO3 and yeast extract. A laboratory-scale batch fermentation process was carried out to find out how the carbon and nitrogen sources and their concentrations affect fermentation performances in terms of hydrogen production and yield, bacterial growth and production of by-products."
1,Methodology,
2,Microorganism and maintenance,"2.1 Microorganism and maintenance C. butyricum W5 (GenBank accession number: DQ831124) was isolated from hydrogen-producing sludge and identified by 16S rDNA sequence and the RapID™ ANA II System (Remel, Inc., Lenexa, KS) in our previous research [15]. The strain was routinely maintained anaerobically on blood agar medium (PP2001, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid) at 35°C for 48h, and was monthly transferred in a MK3 Anaerobic Work Station (Don Whitley Scientific Limited, West Yorkshire, England) with a 10% hydrogen and 90% nitrogen gas atmosphere. It was then stored at 4°C within an anaerobic jar (AG0025, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid). The anaerobic gas atmosphere is created by ANAEROGEN (AN2005, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid) in the anaerobic jar."
3,Culture media and cultivation methods,"2.2 Culture media and cultivation methods Tryptone Soya Broth (CM0129, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid) was used as the seed culture medium. It was autoclaved at 121°C for 20min. A 100mL bottle containing 100mL of the broth was inoculated with a single colony picked up from stored blood agar and then cultivated in an anaerobic jar at 35°C for 12h before inoculation into the bioreactor."
4,Preliminary screening of carbon and nitrogen sources,"2.3 Preliminary screening of carbon and nitrogen sources Six carbon sources (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, WPS and molasses) and six nitrogen sources (yeast extract (LP0021, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid), neutralised soya peptone (NSP) (LP0044, Columbia, HBA, Oxoid), urea [CO(NH)2], ammonium sulphate [(NH4)2SO4], potassium nitrate (KNO3) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)) were employed in the screening investigations for hydrogen production. WPS was provided by Smiths Chips Ltd (Australia). The WPS contained 90% (w/w) starch and 0.04055 % total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), as determined by previous research [22]. Molasses was obtained from Magill Grain Store Pty Ltd (Australia). The hexose concentration in the molasses was 44.4% (w/w) and the TKN was 0.7086%. Yeast extract was used as nitrogen source for the carbon source screening experiments. Glucose was used as carbon source for the trials of nitrogen source screening. The fermentation media contained carbon sources equal to 10g/L hexose and nitrogen sources equal to 3g/L yeast extract. Preliminary screening experiments were carried out at 35°C with initial pH 7.0 in refitted 1L bottles, which have two tubes fitted into the rubble stopper to allow inert gas purging and biogas emission. The working volume was 800mL and 10% (v/v) seed culture was used as inoculum. Biogas was collected by the water release method."
5,Comparison of different carbon and nitrogen sources in bioreactor,"2.4 Comparison of different carbon and nitrogen sources in bioreactor Batch fermentation was performed in a laboratory-scale batch bioreactor BioFlo 110 (New Brunswick Scientific, USA), at 35°C, pH 6.5, with a working volume of 1.5-L, to compare the effects of carbon (glucose, molasses and WPS) and nitrogen sources (yeast extract and NH4NO3). The agitation was 300rpm. The anaerobic environment was maintained by sealing all the connections with silicone gel. Temperature, pH and agitation rate were controlled during fermentations according to experimental design. The inoculum was transferred with a sterile hypodermic disposable syringe. Nitrogen purging for keeping the anaerobic environment of the medium was carried out after the inoculation. Biogas produced was collected by the water release method. Carbon and nitrogen source concentrations in fermentation media were determined in the same way as bottle test. Fermentation performed at 35°C, pH 6.5, 300rpm with an inoculum size of 100mL seed culture, and fermentation duration is 20h."
6,Effects of molasses and NH4NO3 concentrations,"2.5 Effects of molasses and NH4NO3 concentrations The effects of molasses and NH4NO3 concentrations were evaluated in the bioreactor. Bioreactor operation conditions were the same as described in Section 2.4. Fermentation was performed with 100mL seed culture at 35°C, pH 6.5, 300rpm. A series of molasses concentrations from 20 to 120g/L were tested to evaluate the effect of carbon source concentration. The optimal concentration was then used afterwards to evaluate NH4NO3 concentration (0–1.5g/L)."
7,Sample preparation and analysis,"2.6 Sample preparation and analysis For the bottle test, total biogas volume and hydrogen concentration were measured and 20mL of fermentation broth in the bottle were collected after 16h for analysis of hydrogen production and biomass. For batch fermentation, biogas volume and hydrogen concentration were measured and 20mL of fermentation broth in the bioreactor were collected at 4h intervals for investigation of the kinetics of hydrogen accumulation, cell growth and formation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Fermentation broth samples were centrifuged at 4°C, 3000rpm for 20min. Pellets were washed twice with Mill-Q water and weighed after drying at 60°C for 4h for biomass measurement. Supernatant (100μL) was diluted 10 times and further filtered through a 0.22μm membrane for analysis of VFAs by HPLC. The HPLC analysis used an ROA Organic Acid Column (Phenomenex, 300×7.8) and a refractive index detector (Varian, Model 350). The mobile phase was 4mM H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.5mLmin−1 and the column temperature was 50°C. The biogas was sampled using a glass syringe and analyzed on a CP-3800 gas chromatograph (Varian Inc. CA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector as described previously [15]. The working temperatures of injector, detector, and column were maintained at 50, 140 and 40°C, respectively. All results were obtained from the means of triplicate determinations."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Screening of carbon and nitrogen sources,"3.1 Screening of carbon and nitrogen sources Glucose was the most commonly used carbon source for determining hydrogen production ability in laboratories [14,23]. WPS and molasses were also considered by previous researchers as a potential fermentation raw material because of their wide availability, low cost, high carbohydrate concentration and high biodegradability [24,25]. In consideration of lowering the production costs for further industrial purposes, several inorganic nitrogen sources were also selected. Among six organic or inorganic nitrogen sources, urea has the highest proportion of nitrogen content (46.7%), followed by NH4NO3 (35%), (NH4)2SO4 (21%), KNO3 (13.9%), yeast extract (9.8%) and NSP (8.7%). To compare the requirement of nitrogen sources, nitrogen content in this study was set up as 0.30g/L, leading to different concentrations of nitrogen sources as shown in Table 1 . Experimental data of screening carbon and nitrogen sources for hydrogen production are given in Table 1. The results from carbon source screening experiments showed that the highest concentration of hydrogen (950mL/L) and biomass (1.45g/L) was measured in the fermentation system using molasses, flowed by WPS which produced 648ml/L hydrogen and 1.35g/L biomass. The high biomass and hydrogen production compared with monosaccharide and disaccharide are possibly due to the bio-accessible nitrogen sources existing in WPS and molasses [22,26,27]. A similar hydrogen production performance was given in the fermentation system using glucose, fructose and sucrose. These showed that the newly isolated C. butyricum W5 has a capability to use those monosaccharides and disaccharides, which also are the main sugar content of hydrolysed WPS and molasses [14]. Lactose fermentation resulted in a poor performance in terms of hydrogen production and bacterial growth, indicating that lactose-containing substrate may not be a suitable carbon source for the hydrogen production by C. butyricum W5. The results of nitrogen source screening revealed that the highest hydrogen production could be achieved by using yeast extract (950mL/L). Inorganic nitrogen sources (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3 also produced a relatively high yield (460 and 483mL/L, respectively), which showed great industrial potential because of their low cost. Urea and KNO3 appeared not to be a favoured nitrogen source for C. butyricum W5."
10,"Effects of glucose, WPS and molasses","3.2 Effects of glucose, WPS and molasses According to the results obtained from carbon source screening, two promising carbon sources, WPS and molasses, were further investigated by batch bioreactor process. As a comparison trial, a batch fermentation using glucose as carbon source was carried out under the same operation condition. Analytical data revealed that lactic acid, acetic acid and butyric acid were end by-products, and other VFAs and alcohols either were measured at a very low level or were undetectable. Fig. 1 presents kinetic profiles of biochemical parameters during 20h fermentation, showing the effect of the three carbon sources on production of hydrogen (A), bacterial biomass (B), lactic acid (C), acetic acid (D) and butyric acid (E). A shorter lag phase and higher hydrogen production and faster biomass growth were given in the fermentation using molasses as carbon source (Fig. 1A and B). The use of WPS corresponded to a relatively longer lag phase but higher hydrogen production and biomass growth than glucose. The shortest lag phase (6h) was obtained by using molasses, followed by glucose (8h) and WPS (12h). VFAs produced along with hydrogen are valuable by-products. In theory, 4 or 2mol of hydrogen per mole hexose can be produced if acetic acid or butyric acid is the sole end-product, respectively [28]. It is worthwhile to note that the hydrogen fermentation using pure culture of C. butyricum W5, as hydrogen producer, produced mainly lactic acid, acetic acid and butyric acid as by-products, and lactic acid was found to be the dominate VFA in the fermentation using molasses and glucose. Compared with glucose, molasses fermentation resulted in a high production of hydrogen and biomass, while accumulating more acetic acid and butyric acid (Fig. 1D and E). Angenent and the co-workers reported that the formation of other reduced organic compounds like lactic acid, propionic acid and ethanol will lead to a much low hydrogen yield [28]. They stated that these metabolic pathways bypass the major hydrogen-producing reaction in carbohydrate fermentations [28]. A small amount of propionic acid (less than 0.1g/L) was observed at 8h when fermented molasses consumed by bacteria (data not shown). No ethanol production was observed during the fermentations using C. butyricum W5. Fig. 1C shows that a higher level of lactic acid was produced by glucose compared to molasses. The WPS fermentation demonstrated an unfavoured performance in terms of hydrogen yield, production of VFAs (Table 2 )."
11,Effects of NH4NO3 and yeast extract,"3.3 Effects of NH4NO3 and yeast extract Using cheap inorganic nitrogen source instead of expensive organic nitrogen sources is favoured in an industrial process. NH4NO3, a widely used inorganic nitrogen source, was tested in comparison with yeast extract. The results from experiments of nitrogen source impact are shown in Fig. 2 . Similar lag phases (8h) were obtained from the fermentation using both nitrogen sources. It is reasonably to note that NH4NO3 fermentation led to a slow bacterial growth. A slightly higher butyric acid concentration was obtained in the fermentation using NH4NO3 than the fermentation using yeast extract. Comparing with the experimental data in the first 12h fermentation, the use of NH4NO3 demonstrated a weaker performance in terms of production of hydrogen (Fig. 2A), biomass (Fig. 2B), and lactic acid (Fig. 2C) and acetic acid (Fig. 2D) than those fermentations using yeast extract. Obviously, yeast extract was the favoured nitrogen source for the growth of C. butyricum W5, leading to a high production of the hydrogen and by-products. Data in experiment E2 and E3 in Table 2 show that the extra nitrogen content in WPS and molasses may be responsible for the high hydrogen yield and VFA production."
12,Effects of molasses concentration,"3.4 Effects of molasses concentration The carbon source concentration is crucial to a fermentation process. It affects both production rate and yield, and the cost of whole process [16]. High carbon source concentration can promote the production rate and improve the efficiency. However, high hexose and oligosaccharides concentration will modify metabolic pathways and lead to production of unwanted by-products [14]. Fig. 3 . shows the hydrogen production and yield, and biomass growth at different molasses concentrations. The hydrogen production increased with the increase in molasses concentration, while the yield reached 1.63molH2/mol hexose at 100g/L molasses and kept a similar level (1.62molH2/mol hexose) at the molasses concentration of 120g/L. Moreover, the lag phase was prolonged from 8 to 18h when molasses concentration increased from 100 to 120g/L (data not shown), which was supposed to be introduced by high hexose initial concentration. Therefore, 100g/L could be regarded as the highest tolerant molasses concentration of C. butyricum W5. Molasses has been used in many previous investigations of hydrogen production and a similar long accumulation time of more than 20h was observed by previous researchers when a molasses concentration was higher than 60gCOD/L [29]. It can be seen that the molasses concentration significantly affected the hydrogen production and bacterial growth. Statistical data analysis showed that the hydrogen production and biomass growth have a lineal relationship with the carbon source concentration. Lineal equations were y =1780.6x −887.42 with R 2 =0.9948 and y =0.9739x −0.2443 with R 2 =0.9872 (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4 , a noticeable variation in VFA portion can be observed using molasses and NH4NO3 as substrates compared with glucose and yeast extract (Figs. 1 and 2). When molasses concentration was 20g/L, butyric acid was the main product, while lactic acid was not detectable. As increasing molasses concentration, the acetic acid and butyric acid increased, but the corresponding hydrogen yield decreased. Comparing the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 with those showed in Fig. 3, a high lactic acid production was found in the fermentations which used either yeast extract as carbon source or a high concentration of molasses. No propionic acid was detected during the fermentation."
13,Effects of NH4NO3 concentration,"3.5 Effects of NH4NO3 concentration NH4NO3 is a cheap and high nitrogen content (35%) nitrogen source and has been widely used for many fermentation processes. As the molasses employed in this research contains 0.7086% nitrogen which is mainly organic nitrogen [30]. NH4NO3 was used as a supplementary nitrogen source. Impact of nitrogen source concentration of hydrogen production/yield, biomass growth and VFA yield is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . Production of both hydrogen and biomass increased with the increase in NH4NO3 from 0 to 1.2g/L. No further production improvement was found as NH4NO3 concentration increased up to 1.5g/L. The lag phase decreased from 16 to 12h as NH4NO3 concentration increased which indicated that a fast cell growth rate needs a high nitrogen source concentration (data not shown). No statistical relationships between NH4NO3 concentration and other biochemical parameters were found. It was noted that NH4NO3 concentration had a little impact on lactic acid production. This confirmed our hypothesis in Section 3.4. Our results indicate that lactic acid formation may be affected by organic nitrogen source, which might be metabolic products of amino acids or other organic compounds [31]. In this case, lactic acids produced in hydrogen fermentation appeared to have a little impact on hydrogen yield from hexose. Acetic acid and butyric acid increased with the increase in NH4NO3 concentrations, while the ratio of acetic acid/butyric acid did not change greatly. Our results suggested that VFA productions were significantly affected by substrates. Further investigation could be done to profile the metabolic pathways of this three VFA and to manipulate the metabolic pathway towards hydrogen production."
14,Conclusion,"The experimental data revealed that the newly isolated C. butyricum W5 is a promising hydrogen producer which can use a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources in either raw or waste basis. Molasses and waste potato starch can be used as carbon sources for a large scale hydrogen production. While yeast extract is the most favoured nitrogen source for bacterial growth and hydrogen fermentation, the NH4NO3 was proven to be a suitable nitrogen source for fermentative hydrogen production. The most suitable molasses and NH4NO3 concentrations for this application were 100 and 1.2g/L respectively. The use of the cheaper carbon and nitrogen sources of molasses, waste starch and NH4NO3 shows great potential for a commercial hydrogen production process. In association with hydrogen production, the fermentation using C. butyricum W5 produced lactic acid, acetic acid and butyric acid as by-products. Differently, lactic acid was found to be the main VFA produced when using glucose as carbon source, while butyric acid was the main VFA produced using molasses and WPS. A high level of acetic acid and butyric acid was associated with a high level of hydrogen and biomass, but the yields of these two VFAs decreased as the hydrogen production yield increased. Preliminary investigation of a laboratory-scale fermentation system using molasses and NH4NO3 as substrates resulted in a comparably high hydrogen yield of 1.63molH2/mol hexose, while a maximum yield of 0.61molH2/mol hexose was given in glucose fermentation."
