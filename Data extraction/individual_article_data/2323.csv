0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, a clean and renewable energy carrier, is recognized as the promising fuel for future. The sustainable generation of hydrogen may be achieved by a range of technologies, including biological processes. Photo-hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria is a promising technology as it could convert organics into hydrogen at the expense of solar energy [1]. Photosynthetic bacteria could be used as the sole microorganisms that digested wastewaters. Zhu et al. [2] reported hydrogen production by Rhodobacter sphaeroides from the wastewater of tofu factory and obtained a hydrogen yield of 1.9mL/mL wastewater and the TOC (total organic carbon) removal ratio in 85h reached 41%. Vincenzini et al. [3] combined two strains of photosynthetic bacteria, which used sugar refinery wastes and straw paper mill effluents as electron donors, to produce hydrogen, more than 30% of the initial COD of the wastes was converted into hydrogen, at a rate ranging from 50 to 139μl H2 per mg cells dry wt per hour. On the other hand, photosynthetic bacteria could be coupled with dark-fermentative hydrogen producing bacteria in a two-step system converting organics into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Dark-fermentative hydrogen producing bacteria can convert monosaccharide to hydrogen and short chain organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, butyric acid), the production of short chain organic acids limit the range of hydrogen production but they can be further utilized by photosynthetic bacteria for hydrogen production. Therefore, the combination of photo and dark fermentation may increase hydrogen production yield and conversion efficiency of monosaccharide, and it has been regarded as an ideal system for clean energy recovery from organic wastewaters [4]. Su et al. [5] improved hydrogen production from cassava starch by combination of dark and photo fermentation, and increased hydrogen yield from 240.4ml H2/g starch in the dark fermentation to 402.3ml H2/g starch in the combined dark and photo fermentation. Chen et al. [6] conducted sequential two-stage process combining dark and photo fermentation processes, and elevated the hydrogen yield from 3.8 (dark fermentation) to 10.02mol H2/mol sucrose (dark/photo fermentation). Thus photosynthetic bacteria play an important role in decomposing wastewaters, meanwhile, the organics could be converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide completely in theory. Photosynthetic bacteria which proved to produce hydrogen were mainly Rhodopseudomonas palustirs [7,8], Rhodobacter capsulata [9,10], R. sphaeroides [11,12], Rhodopseudomonas faecalis [13], Rubrivivax gelatinosus [14]. However, a single type of microorganism [2,7–12] or combined two types of microorganisms [3,15] have been used in the study of hydrogen production and few researches have compared the characteristics of hydrogen production between hydrogen producers on the same conditions. In this paper, the characteristics of hydrogen production by three photosynthetic strains were compared and some suggestions on how to modify the strains were provided based on the results."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and media,"2.1 Microorganisms and media Rhodopseudomonas sp., R. palustirs W004 and Rubrivivax sp. were employed in this experiment and they were isolated from Xingqing lake in Xi'an city. Before hydrogen production, the cells were anaerobically cultured in the medium: Na2HPO4·12H2O (1.26g/L), MgCl2·6H2O (0.43g/L), NaCl (2g/L), ethanol (2g/L), yeast extract (2g/L) and peptone (2g/L) [16]. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.8. The medium was sterilized in an autoclave before being used for the culture."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The media consisting of carbon source (20mM), glutamate (1.6g/L), KH2PO4 (0.5g/L), K2HPO4·3H2O (0.835g/L), MgCl2·6H2O (0.3g/L), CaCl2 (0.072g/L), EDTA (0.02g/L), NaCl (1.8g/L), Na2SO3 (0.2g/L), 4mL of minerals and 1mL of vitamins were used for hydrogen production, which were modified from Zhu et al.[17] 250mL minerals solution contains ZnCl2 70mg, CoCl2·6H2O 200mg, Na2MoO4·2H2O 188mg, H3BO3 500mg, CuCl2·2H2O 20mg, MnCl2·4H2O 100mg, and FeSO4·7H2O 100mg. Vitamin solution (250mL) was constituted of p-aminobenzoic acid 250mg, thiamine hydrochioride 250mg, nicotinic acid 250mg, vitamin B12 12.5mg, and biotin 3.75mg. The media was adjusted to pH 6.6 after sterilizing. Glass syringes (50mL) were utilized for H2 production from individual VFA, acetate or butyrate. Ten millilitres of microbial culture pre-cultured for 2 days were centrifugated for 5min at 4000g, and then the sediment was transferred into 30mL of meida in a glass syringe. No air left in the glass syringes. All the glass syringes were placed in an illumination box at 32°C. Home-made photoreactors (350mL) were employed to produce H2 from mixed VFAs, which contained butyrate, acetate, propionate and ethanol. Thirty millilitres of pre-incubated culture were harvested and inoculated into 320mL medium in a photoreactor. The photoreactor was mixed continuously by magnetic stirrer during the reaction period. After the replacement of gas phase with argon gas, the cultivation was started at 32°C with light irradiation by tungsten lamps. Gas was collected in a volumetric meter."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The amount of biogas produced was recorded daily. The composition of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) (SP-3420, Beifen Co.) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and a 4m×3mm HayeSep column. Argon was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20mL/min. The VFAs and alcohols in the medium were analyzed by a GC (Varian CP-3800) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 15m×0.32mm capillary column (AT-FFAP). Hydrogen gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2mL/min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 220°C and 280°C, respectively. The COD of the liquor samples were mensurated with a COD detector. The liquor samples before testing were fist centrifuged at 5000g for 10min, and were then acidified by sulphuric acid and filtrated through 0.22μm membrane. The concentration of the cells was measured by a spectrophotometer (U4100H, Japan) via the method of colorimetry [18]."
5,Results,
6,Hydrogen production from individual VFA,"3.1 Hydrogen production from individual VFA The tests of hydrogen production from individual VFA were carried out in glass syringes with 30mL culture at 32°C. We monitored the cumulative H2 volume and H2 content during the process, and COD value at the beginning and the end of the process. Acetate and butyrate were chosen as the substrate for they were dominant products of anaerobic fermentation [19]. The theoretical equations of hydrogen production from acetate and butyrate were described as follows [20]: (1) Acetate: C2H4O2 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 (2) Butyrate: C4H8O2 +6H2O→10H2 +4CO2 The concentration of the substrate was set at 20mmol according to Chen [7]. Rhodopseudomonas sp. had better performance in converting acetate and butyrate to hydrogen than R. palustirs W004 and Rubrivivax sp. Besides, the highest H2 amount (2191.7mL/L culture), COD reduction efficiency (85.3%) and H2 yield (468.3mL H2/g COD) were achieved by Rhodopseudomonas sp. with butyrate as carbon source (Table 1 ). Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004 showed high capability to convert butyrate to hydrogen, as shown in Table 1 that when butyrate was fed as substrate, cumulative H2 volume and H2 yield were higher than that when acetate was used. Rubrivivax sp. produced no gas, but the ability of reducing COD value was almost equal to R. palustirs W004, which indicated that Rubrivivax sp. could assimilate acetate and butyrate. As for pH value, the final pH of Rhodopseudomonas sp. (7.644, 7.133) culture was lower than that of R. palustirs W004 (8.418, 7.783) and Rubrivivax sp. (9.311, 8.847) culture. Meanwhile, for the same strain, the final pH of the test using butyrate was lower than that using acetate. Comparing final pH and H2 yield, it is easy to conclude that the lower the final pH value was, the better the hydrogen production ability was."
7,Hydrogen production from mixed VFAs,"3.2 Hydrogen production from mixed VFAs The effluent of dark fermentation contains mainly butyrate, acetate, ethanol and propionate, the concentrations of which were monitored by GC, and the results were as follows: butyrate 2.7g/L, acetate 1.5g/L, propionate 0.27g/L, ethanol 0.56g/L, on the premise that the parameters of dark fermentation were pH 5.0, HRT 8.34h, temperature 36°C, and glucose concentration of 14g/L with cow dung as microorganisms resources. Based on this, we mixed the four organics simulated the effluent of dark fermentation as the substrate for photo fermentation to test hydrogen production abilities of the three strains. For each strain, the tests were repeated for three times. 3.2.1 Lag time The cells were cultivated in a 125mL serum bottle for 2 days, and then harvested and inoculated into hydrogen production reactor. The lag time for Rhodopseudomonas sp., R. palustirs W004 and Rubrivivax sp. was between 12 and 24h while Rubrivivax sp. had the shortest lag time of 12h (Table 2 ). However, when the cells were harvested after growing in the serum bottle for 5 days or longer, the lag time for hydrogen production was about 3–5 days or longer, besides, the cells grew slowly. The reason was that the cells were at exponential phase seen under microscope when they were harvested after two days' cultivation, while pH of the medium rose to 9.0 and spores formed after 5 days' cultivation. 3.2.2 Hydrogen production The process of hydrogen production by Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004 lasted for more than a month, and produced 2044mL and 1866mL hydrogen (Fig. 1 ), which were 56.5, 51.6% of the theoretical value (Table 4 ) according to Eqs. (1)–(4); and the COD removal efficiency were 96.6% and 93.7%, respectively (Fig. 2 ). Each kind of VFA was almost consumed shown in Table 3, so the two strains were desirable for hydrogen production. The process of hydrogen production by Rubrivivax sp. lasted for 3.7 days, and 280mL hydrogen was produced (Fig. 1). The hydrogen yield was 7.7% of the theoretical value (Table 4). The highest rates of Rhodopseudomonas sp., R. palustirs W004, and Rubrivivax sp. were 26.5, 10.3, and 16.4mL/Lh, respectively (Table 4). (3) Ethanol: C2H6O+3H2O→6H2 +2CO2 (4) Propionate: C3H6O2 +4H2O→7H2 +3CO2 The pH value during the experiments is shown in Fig. 3 . The pH value of test 1 (Rhodopseudomonas sp.) and test 2 (R. palustirs W004) maintained below or around 8.0, and the pH of test 1 (Rhodopseudomonas sp.) increased slowly. On the other hand, the pH value of test 3 (Rubrivivax sp.) rose quickly once the cultivation started and rose up to 9.2 at 3.7 days, resulting in the cease of H2 evolution, which will be discussed in the following part."
8,Discussion,"The results obtained above showed that the three strains in this research assimilated the simulated dark fermentation effluents, which includes butyrate, acetate, propionate, and ethanol. By Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004, butyrate and acetate could be converted into H2, and butyrate was more suitable for hydrogen production than acetate, and these four kinds of organics were consumed fast. Thus these two strains are good candidates for wastewater treatment as well as hydrogen production. Rubrivivax sp. could not convert individual butyrate or acetate into hydrogen, but could live on them. With the mixed VFAs as substrate, there were 0.2g/L propionate and 0.05g/L ethanol decomposed (Table 3). Suppose all ethanol and propionate decomposed were converted into H2, the total amount of H2 was 181.72mL which was calculated according to Eqs. (3) and (4). Obviously, the calculated amount of H2 was much lower than the actual amount (280mL), which indicated that butyrate or acetate was converted into H2 during the process with the mixed substrate. In previous reports [23,24], Rubrivivax sp. was used to convert CO and H2O into H2. In 2008, Li [14] isolated a new strain of Rubrivivax gelatinosus that could produce hydrogen from carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose and starch, as well as from lactate and malate, but not from acetate, propionate, butyrate, succinate and glutamate. In our work, we isolated a new strain of Rubrivivax sp. that could convert VFAs into hydrogen only when mixed VFAs used as substrate. The reason for this phenomenon needed to be further studied. Hydrogen evolution by Rubrivivax sp. ceased at 3.7 days after illumination, and the pH at 3.7 days rose up to 9.2. It is known that the proper pH for the growth of Rhodopseudomonas spp. is 5.5–8.5 [25]. When the pH reached 9.2, the cells could not stand the alkaline condition, thus stopped growing and started forming spores, which prevented hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution rate of Rubrivivax sp. increased fast, and had the shortest lag time of 12h, thus Rubrivivax sp. could be used for hydrogen production if the pH was controlled below 8.5. Zhu [2] reported that the increase of pH from 6.8 to 7.5 resulted in 7-fold decrease of hydrogen evolution and 3-fold accumulation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in cells. Li [14] showed that R. gelatinosus L31 could produce PHB with glucose, lactate, malate, acetate, propionate and butyrate, and final pH increased to 9.6–10.5. PHB was a byproduct of hydrogen production [26]. The cells are apt to convert acetate into PHB and produce little hydrogen [27]. Hustede's [27] research showed that PHB synthase deficient mutant had the ability to produce hydrogen while the wild strains didn't. Controlling the pH value around 7.0 could increase hydrogen production and decrease the synthesis of PHB [28]. The future work should be focused on how to decrease PHB synthesis and maintain the pH by molecular biological methods or controlling reaction conditions. Table 1 shows that either for Rhodopseudomonas sp. or for R. palustirs W004, the final pH of the test with butyrate as substrate was lower than that with acetate, and H2 yield of the test with butyrate was higher than that with acetate. This phenomenon indicated butyrate is a better substrate for these two strains to produce hydrogen. “A promising approach for high rate H2 production from wastewater is pretreatment of the wastewater by acidogenic fermentation to produce favorable substrates for H2 production by PSB” [29]. Thus operation parameters of dark fermentation should be optimized for the production of butyrate, since butyrate was more desirable than acetate to produce H2 for Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004. Hydrogen evolution by Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004 did not cease until the substrates were used up, which benefited from stable pH value. The hydrogen evolution ability of Rhodopseudomonas sp. was the best, and R. palustirs W004 was facultative anaerobic which means that cultivation of R. palustirs W004 was cheap. Thus these two strains have promising prospects to be employed in two-step process of dark and photo fermentation, but the hydrogen evolution rate should be improved by one order of magnitude in order to meet a sufficient efficiency for industrialization. Many research reported that the speed limiting factors were as follows (1) the hydrogenase absorbs hydrogen produced by nitrogenase [30]; (2) the self-shading effects [31–33]; and (3) accumulation of PHB [27]. Thus the following work should be decreasing the photosynthetic pigments, and paralyzing hydrogenase and PHB synthesis."
9,Conclusion,"We compared the characteristics of hydrogen production from individual and mixed VFAs among Rhodopseudomonas sp., R. palustirs W004 and Rubrivivax sp. Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004 could decompose butyrate, acetate and mixed VFAs with high COD removal efficiencies and produce hydrogen. Rubrivivax sp. could assimilate butyrate and acetate, but no hydrogen evolved when individual VFA used as substrate. The mixed VFAs could be partially converted into hydrogen by Rubrivivax sp. Butyrate is more desirable substrate to produce hydrogen than acetate by Rhodopseudomonas sp. and R. palustirs W004. Rhodopseudomonas sp. produced more hydrogen than the other two strains, and the highest H2 amount were 2191.7mL/L culture, 2044mL/(320mL culture) and COD reduction efficiency were 85.3%, 96.6%, when using butyrate and mixed VFAs as carbon source, respectively."
