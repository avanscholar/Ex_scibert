0,Introduction,"About 2000Tgyr−1 of organic compounds are emitted into the atmosphere as gases, which represent about 104–105 compounds [1]. Organic aerosols (OA) make a substantial contribution to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), about 20–90% of aerosol mass in the lower troposphere [2]. On the other hand, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounts for a substantial fraction (20–80%) of OA [2,3]. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important SOA precursors, and they may overcome the nucleation barrier to form new particle under certain conditions [4–6]. The identification of the participating particles in atmospheric nucleation is a complicated process. This is due to the difficulties in directly measuring the initial steps. Alternatively, a promising technique is to use the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique combining with quantum chemical calculations [7]. A large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the hydrogen bonding interactions under atmospheric conditions [8–15]. The non-conventional OH⋯π hydrogen bond has been studied in the methanol (MeOH)–ethene complex under experimental and theoretical conditions [13]. The FTIR spectra of the methanol−ethene mixtures were recorded in supersonic expansions, and the fundamental and overtone transitions of the mixed dimer were assigned. A red shift (45cm−1) of the OH-stretching transitions was observed, and the calculated binding energy was −8kJmol−1 (LCCSD(T*)-F12a/VDZ-F12). On other hand, the conventional OH⋯O hydrogen bonds are much stronger than the non-conventional OH⋯π hydrogen bond. Howard et al. combined vapor phase infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations to investigate the complexes of MeOH with dimethyl ether (DME) [14]. A 103cm−1 red shift of the OH-stretching transitions upon complexation were recorded and the calculated binding energy was −18.8kJmol−1 (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ). Similarly, Biswal et al. carried out experimental and computational studies on the H2O–p-cresol [15]. The spectra of the monomers and the complex were recorded with resonance ion dip infrared spectroscopy (RIDIRS). Their experimental findings revealed that the red shift of the OH-stretching transition was 127cm−1 with respect to the water monomer. A competition between conventional OH⋯O and non-conventional OH⋯π binding sites has recently been examined for the 2,3-benzofuran and anisole clusters [8–11]. There are two possible hydrogen bond docking sites for the incoming hydrogen bond donor: the oxygen atom and the delocalized π electron system. The OH⋯O and OH⋯π isomers are almost equally stable, but the observed structures were found to be stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the incoming hydrogen bond donor, with anisole/2,3-benzofuran molecule, acting as an acceptor through the lone pairs of the oxygen atom. This conclusion was derived from both the relative abundance of the two isomers in a supersonic jet expansion and the high-level quantum chemical calculations. In contrast, resonant two-photon ionization and IR-UV double resonance spectroscopy experiment as well as DFT study were carried out to investigate the indole−furan heterodimer. The results revealed that the non-conventional NH⋯π hydrogen bond interaction was found to be more stable than the conventional NH⋯O hydrogen bond interaction [12]. Unsaturated oxygenates in the atmosphere, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters and ethers have received great attention as toxic air contaminants [16–19]. Among them, unsaturated esters have been widely used in the production of pesticides, polymers, resins and cleaning products. They have been emitted into the atmosphere owing to their use in industry [20]. The main source of biogenic emission into the atmosphere is vegetation [21–23]. Many kinds of unsaturated esters, such as methyl acrylate, have been detected in ambient air [24]. The presence of a double bond and a carbonyl group makes unsaturated esters an interesting class of compounds. On the other hand, esters do not absorb significantly at wavelengths >240nm and, hence, do not undergo photolysis in the lower atmosphere [25]. Thus, the expectation is for them to be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Into the bargain, recent studies have also shown that new particle formation (NPF) commonly involves organic spices, such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc. [26–28] Also of importance is to know the atmospheric chemistry of unsaturated esters with atmospheric relevant compounds, so as to assess their potential impact to the atmospheric particle nucleation. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) is a representative of the fluorinated alcohols. The chemistry of halogen in the troposphere has been realized to have a powerful influence on the fate of pollutants and may affect climate [29]. TFE has been used as a solvent in organic chemistry, and industrially TFE is employed as a solvent for nylon and also in the pharmaceutical field [30]. TFE could be emitted into the atmosphere through its use in industry as well. The atmospheric oxidation of ethanol (EtOH) with the hydroxyl radical leads to formation of important secondary pollutants such as acetaldehyde, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), formaldehyde, and ozone [31]. For TFE, the atmospheric oxidation process will be similar. The atmospheric lifetime of TFE is approximately 0.3years against the atmospheric OH radical [32], but only 3.6days for EtOH [25]. Therefore it is interesting to investigate the initial nucleation process of NPF involving TFE. Moreover, it has been noted that the hydrogen bonding interactions are not only electrostatic but an admixture of electrostatic, exchange, repulsion, dispersion, polarization, and correlation interactions [33]. Therefore, it is also important to reveal the hydrogen bonding interactions with regards to their spectroscopic properties, nature of interactions, their relative strengths, etc. In the present work, FTIR and computational study of bimolecular complexes of the TFE with atmospheric nucleation precursors including vinyl acetate (CH3COOCHCH2, VA) and methyl acrylate (CH2CHCOOCH3, MA) has been carried out. VA has the same molecular formula as MA, and they also have the same functional groups: carbonyl group, ester oxygen and CC double bond. These two isomers would be expected to share the similar properties."
1,Experimental and Theoretical Methods,"Methyl acrylate (MA) (TCI, >99.0%), vinyl acetate (VA) (Damas-beta, 99%+), and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) (Aldrich, 99.5%) were used according some standard procedures: purification and degasification with several freeze-pump-thaw cycles on a vacuum line (base pressure <1×10−4 Torr). Tamagawa CDG-800 pressure gauges were deployed to measure all vapor pressures. The infrared spectra of the monomer and mixture were reported at 1.0cm−1 resolution and 128 scans with a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer fitted with a KBr beam splitter and a DLaTGS detector under ambient condition. A 20cm path length glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows was used. The FTIR spectra were analyzed with OPUS 7.2 software. During the experiment, there were two uncertainty factors on the pressures in the cell: the gas adsorption on the cell wall (<10%) and the loss of chemicals during the experiment. Thus, a pressure “calibration” procedure was carried out [34]. A pure TFE spectrum at a certain pressure (nominal) was recorded first. During the spectral subtraction, the pure TFE spectrum was subtracted by a weighting factor. The exactly same procedure was done for the pure MA and VA, respectively. The contribution of the monomer spectrum was then completely cancelled from the spectrum of their mixture. The gas pressures were recorded at room temperature. Geometry optimizations of various possible conformers of TFE–unsaturated esters dimer were performed with B3LYP-D3, as implemented in the Gaussian 09 (Revision E.01) program package [35], using Dunning's correlation-consistent basis set aug-cc-pVTZ on all atoms. A “verytight” optimization convergence criteria and an “ultrafine” numerical integration grid was used for the DFT calculations to obtain reliable results [36,37]. For each stable structure, harmonic frequencies were calculated to confirm that the structures are indeed minima (no imaginary frequency). The binding energies (BEs) of various conformers of the dimer were corrected with zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE). Moreover, BEs were corrected for the basis set superposition errors (BSSEs) by using Boys and Bernardi's counterpoise (CP) method [38]. This method has been shown to improve interaction energies of weakly bound complexes [39–42]. The topological analysis of the electron density by means of the Bader's theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) provides a useful tool in understanding both covalent and non-covalent molecular interactions [43,44]. The topological properties of electron density ρ(r) at the bond critical point (BCP) have been widely used to get deep inside into the nature of the hydrogen bonding [45]. The electron density ρ(r) and the Laplacian of the electron density ∇2 ρ(r) at BCP are used as a criteria for a hydrogen bond. In this study, topological analysis of the charge density was carried out by utilizing the AIM2000 program (version 2) package for the monomers and bimolecular complexes. In the present work, the interaction energies were analyzed by means of the generalized Kohn−Sham energy decomposition analysis (GKS-EDA) method [33]. GKS-EDA allows one to express the interaction energy (EINT) in terms of physically meaningful components such as electrostatic energy (EES), exchange energy (EEX), repulsion energy (EREP), polarization energy (EPOL), Grimme's dispersion energy (EDISP) and correlation energy (ECORR). All GKS-EDA calculations were carried out at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level, with the GAMESS (U.S.) package [46]. (1) ΔE INT = ΔE ES + ΔE EX + ΔE REP + ΔE POL + ΔE DISP + ΔE CORR"
2,Results and Discussion,
3,Geometrical Analysis,"3.1 Geometrical Analysis Due to the internal rotation of the OC bond of both methyl acrylate (MA) and vinyl acetate (VA), there are two stable conformers for each monomer (Fig. 1a–d): a Z-conformer (anti-conformer) in which the CH3 group has the anti-orientation with respect to the CHCH2 group; a E-conformer (syn-conformer) in which the CH3 group has the syn-orientation with respect to the CHCH2 group. The Z-conformer is about 34.4 and 26.7kJmol−1 (B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ, ZPVE corrected) more stable than the E-conformer of MA and VA, respectively. Similarly, the Z-conformers of the three saturated methyl esters (methyl formate, methyl acetate, methyl trifluoroacetate) were calculated to be about 18.7–34.1kJmol−1 (B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ) more stable than the E-conformer in our previous studies [37]. So throughout this paper, the Z-conformers of both unsaturated esters were chosen for the theoretical investigation. As shown in our previous studies, the TFE monomer has two conformers along the CCOH frame (Fig. 1e,f): a trans-conformer (noted as t) and a gauche-conformer (noted as g). The gauche-conformer was calculated to be much more stable than the trans with a relative energy of 7.2kJmol−1 (B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ, ZPVE corrected) [37]. As seen from Fig. 1, there are three important docking sites in the two unsaturated esters for the incoming TFE: carbonyl oxygen (CO), ester oxygen (O) and CC double bond (π). Several orientations of TFE with respect to the docking sites were taken into account. Fig. S1 (Supplementary data) shows the electrostatic potential surfaces (ESPs) of MA (Z), VA (Z), and TFE (g). The distribution of electron density around the monomers is visualized by ESPs [47]. The region of the OH group in the TFE (g) surface shows a positive ESP (blue in color in Fig. S1), which enables TFE to be an electron donor. While the negative ESPs region in MA (Z) and VA (Z) (red in color in Fig. S1) implies the nucleophilicity, meanings that carbonyl oxygen is the best electron acceptor than the ester oxygen and the CC double bond. The computed structure reflects that the two monomers attract each other to form a sequential cyclic structure through two hydrogen bonds: either OH⋯OC, OH⋯O or OH⋯π with CH⋯F. This is due to the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor double character of both the TFE and methyl ester molecules. The selected optimized geometric parameters of the TFE–unsaturated ester hydrogen bonded complexes at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level are given in Table 1 . The predicted structures of hydrogen bonded complexes formed between TFE and the more stable Z-conformer of each unsaturated esters at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level are shown in Fig. 2 . The inter-molecular hydrogen bond distances and the changes of the OH bond length of OH⋯OC (0.0088–0.0131Å) hydrogen bond for the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes are much larger than the corresponding OH⋯O (0.0050–0.0078Å) and OH⋯π (0.0017–0.0032Å) hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond length indicates that the OH⋯OC interactions are the strongest and their length (1.7813–1.8538Å) is in agreement with the OH⋯OC hydrogen bond lengths of formamide2–H2O and formamide−(H2O)3 which were determined to be 1.788Å and 1.778Å from the rotational spectrum as well as 1.761Å and 1.768Å from the ab initio MP2/6–311++G(2d,p) calculations, respectively [48,49]. On the other hand, the OH⋯OC hydrogen bond lengths are much longer (1.969–2.105Å, B3LYP/6–311+G(d,p)) in MeOH−lactone (β-propiolactone, γ-butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone, ε-caprolactone) complexes [50]. This is because that MeOH is a weak hydrogen bond donor than TFE [51]. Furthermore, the formation of a hydrogen bond between the OH group and the carbonyl group leads to a sizable elongation of the CO bond. This elongation is about 0.0015–0.0090Å. This is because the charge transfer (CT) from the hydrogen bond acceptor to the donor is usually observed in the formation of a hydrogen bonded complex [52]. In contrast, the CO bonds are also shortened by 0.0020–0.0101Å for the formation of the OH⋯O and OH⋯π hydrogen bonds. This is due to the inductive effect, where OH is an electron donating group that releases electrons to CO and consequently stabilizes CO. Moreover, the homonuclear hydrogen bonds (OH⋯O) where two oxygen atoms are inter-connected by a π-conjugated double bond are called as the resonance assisted hydrogen bond, which is a strong type of hydrogen bond interaction [53–56]. The distance between two oxygen atoms in the hydrogen bond are known as the contact distance d(O---O), which can be used as a criteria of hydrogen bond strength [53]. The contact distances in the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded conformers (TFE–MA (C, D) and TFE–VA (C, D)) are smaller than 2.80Å, thus they can be classified as medium strong hydrogen bonds."
4,Interaction Energies,"3.2 Interaction Energies The predicted binding energy (BE), enthalpy of formation (ΔH 298K θ ), Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG 298K θ ) and equilibrium constant (K eq calc ) at 298K at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level are presented in Table 2 . The ZPVE reaches as large as 4.8kJmol−1, therefore the ZPVE correction has to be considered when predicting BEs. Moreover, the effect of BSSE estimated by using the counterpoise (CP) correction method is much smaller, below 1.4kJmol−1. The BEs in Table 2 were corrected with both ZVPE and BSSE. The OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded TFE–unsaturated ester conformers are the most stable ones, with BEs of −47.0 to −42.8kJmol−1. Then, the BEs of the OH⋯O conformers are in the range of −37.5 to −33.5kJmol−1, and −36.8to −28.1 kJmol−1 for the OH⋯π conformers. The O H⋯OC intra-molecular hydrogen bonded conformer is more stable (9.3kJmol−1, CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12) than its corresponding OH⋯O conformer in methyl lactate [57]. Similarly, the inter-molecular OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded complex is also more stable than its corresponding OH⋯O hydrogen bonded complex, where the energy difference was calculated to be 9.6–11.0kJmol−1 (B3LYP/6–31+G*) for MeOH−α-hydroxyester (methyl glycolate, methyl lactate and methyl α-hydroxyisobutyrate) [58], and 10–12kJmol−1 for TEF–methyl esters (methyl formate, methyl acetate, and methyl trifluoroacetate) [37]. These are in line with the results in this study, where the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded conformers are much more stable by 5.3–12.4kJmol−1 than those of the OH⋯O hydrogen bonded conformers. In previous studies, the BEs of the OH⋯π hydrogen bonded complexes were calculated to be −22.8 to −19.7kJmol−1 (B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP) for t-butyl alcohol−alkenes (norbornene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene) [59] and −11.0kJmol−1 (B2LYP-D3BJ/VTZ) for MeOH−ethene [13]. Basing on the binding energies, the strength of the hydrogen bonds decreases in the order from OH⋯OC (−47.8 to −42.0kJmol−1) to OH⋯O (−37.5 to −33.5kJmol−1) to OH⋯π (−36.8 to −28.1kJmol−1). Furthermore, the large binding energies and negative Gibbs free energy changes imply that these OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded conformers are very stable and are thermodynamically favorable to form for both TFE–unsaturated ester complexes. Consequently, they may contribute to the reduction of the nucleation barriers, then promote the growth of the initial nuclei into larger particles [4–6]."
5,OH-Stretching Frequencies,"3.3 OH-Stretching Frequencies The gas phase spectra of the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes were measured with a 20cm path length cell, and the spectra in the OH-stretching region (3400–3625cm−1 for TFE–MA; 3350–3610cm−1 for TFE–VA) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . Difference spectroscopic method was applied to identify the formation of the hydrogen bonded complexes, where the individual monomer spectra were subtracted from the spectrum of their mixture. However, the TFE–TFE dimer was also formed during the experiment, but the corresponding spectral influences were eliminated by subtracting the spectra of the dimer from the spectra of the mixture [60,61]. Different pressure combination were performed as seen from Figs. 3 and 4, but the contour of the measurements were the same for the same complex. Moreover, the figures also show that the high pressures have stronger bands. On the other hand, the integrated intensity of the vibrational bands is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the complex. The integrated absorbance of the complex band is plotted against the product of the pressures of the monomers and the results show a linear fit (Fig. S2 in Supplementary data). The integration regions for TFE–MA and TFE–VA are 3391–3639 and 3336–3638cm−1, respectively. As a result, a straight line supports the formation of a 1:1 binary complex. This is similar with previous observations, where a formation of 1:1 complex between free hydroxyl group of alcohol and carbonyl group of acrylic ester (OH⋯OC) [62,63]. The deconvolution fitting of the absorption bands of the complexes have been performed and the best fit would be fitting into two Lorentzian functions (Fig. S3 in Supplementary data). For the strongly hydrogen bonded complexes, the OH-stretching fundamental transition bands are usually broad in the spectra, and then appears side bands [37]. The side bands can be considered as combination bands (sum-and-difference bands) with two parts: the OH-stretching band and a low-frequency inter-subunit hydrogen bond vibration band. The OH-stretching fundamental transition wavenumbers of TFE, TFE–MA and TFE–VA were obtained at 3658, 3545 and 3566cm−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the red shifts of the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonds were also observed in the TFE–methyl ester complexes in our previous study: TFE–methyl acetate (119cm−1) and TFE–methyl formate (93cm−1) [37]. The OH⋯π hydrogen bonding interaction between t-butyl alcohol with bulky alkenes (norbornene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene) was investigated by supersonic jet expansions and DFT [59]. The OH-stretching fundamental transitions of the complexes were observed and computed to be red shifted by 60–90cm−1 with respect to the monomer. Moreover, the red shifts of the OH-stretching fundamental transition in respect to TFE were observed at 113cm−1 for TFE–MA and 92cm−1 for TFE–VA. For the two selected unsaturated esters, there were three different type of docking sites for the incoming TFE. Our experimental values were close to the red shifts of the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonds in the TFE–methyl acetate (119cm−1) and TFE–methyl formate (93cm−1) [37]. Therefore, the CO group was found to be the best docking site and the complexes formed in the gas cell were likely to be the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded ones. As compared with methyl formate, both VA and MA are derivatives of methyl acetate formed by replacing one CH3 with one CC group. In such case, we may notice that the strength of methyl formate as a hydrogen bond acceptor is reduced by substituting CH3 with CC. The CC group is an electron withdrawing group and makes the hydrogen bond acceptor atoms more electron deficient, thus reducing the strength of the hydrogen bond. Based on the red shifts of the OH-stretching fundamental transition with respect to TFE, the order of the hydrogen bond strength can be sorted as TFE–VA (92cm−1)<TFE–MA (113cm−1). This is due to the position of the CC bond, which is one atom closer to CO in MA than that in VA. Meanwhile, the relative shifts (%, ∆ ν ~ / ν ~ monomer ) are 2.5% and 3.1% for TFE–VA and TFE–MA, respectively. The strength of the hydrogen bonds may be classified as weak (relative shift <12%) according the criteria proposed by Novak [64]. The hydrogen bond distance of TFE–VA (1.8199Å) is slightly larger than that of TFE–MA (1.7813Å). This also agrees the relation found by Novak: the longer hydrogen bond, the smaller the red shifts (or relative shifts). The red shifts of the OH-stretching transitions in this study are much smaller than the OH⋯O and OH⋯P hydrogen bonded complexes in several previous studies: TFE–DMA (460cm−1), TFE–TMA (485cm−1), and TFE–TMP (267cm−1) [51,65]. It indicates that the two unsaturated esters as hydrogen bond acceptors are much weaker than DMA, TMA and TMP. Moreover, temperature could also affect the shape of the spectra of a hydrogen bond. The experimental and theoretical studies of the nature of the inter‑hydrogen bond of the carboxylic acid dimers were reported for 3-methylcinnamic acid, 4-phenylbutyric acid, cinnamic acid, and 2-thiopheneacetic acid [66–68]. The shapes of the spectra of the OH-stretching fundamental transition were indisputably different from each other at two different temperatures (298K and 77K). This is because the temperature effect and molecular electronic structure determines the bond characteristics. The predicted red shifts of the OH-stretching fundamental transition wavenumbers of the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes are summarized in Table 4 and the spectral shifts of the CO stretching fundamental transition wavenumbers are listed in Table S1 (Supplementary data). When forming OH⋯OC hydrogen bonds, the electronic charge is released from the CO bond to the OH of TFE upon complexation, and leads to red shifts of the CO stretching vibrational transitions [69]. The CO stretching vibrational transitions of the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonded complexes were calculated to be red shifted by about 29–33cm−1 with respect to the corresponding unsaturated ester monomers. This is similar with a previous FTIR study, where the red shifts of the CO stretching transitions (21–34cm−1) for the phenol derivatives and methyl acetate/methyl chloroacetate complexes in carbon tetrachloride solution [70]. Furthermore, the CO stretching bands were red shifted <40cm−1 (B3LYP/6–311+G**) in the MeOH complexes with various cyclic ketones, lactones, lactams, and N-methyl lactams [50]. They all concluded that the most likely association complex between alcohol and acrylic ester is formed through the hydroxyl group of alcohol and the carbonyl group of esters [50,63,69,70]. Furthermore, the CO stretching vibrational transition of the TFE–unsaturated ester OH⋯O and OH⋯π complexes were calculated to be blue shifted by about 8–23cm−1. Combining our computed results and previous studies, this would suggest that the hydrogen bonds in the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes are OH⋯OC under the experimental condition."
6,Thermodynamic Equilibrium Constant,"3.4 Thermodynamic Equilibrium Constant The thermodynamic equilibrium constant (K eq at a certain temperature) of the complexation between TFE and unsaturated esters can be calculated as follows: (2) K eq = p complex / p θ p TFE / p θ × p MA / VA / p θ = exp − Δ G θ RT where p θ is the standard pressure (1atm). The vapor pressures of MA, VA and TFE were measured during the experiments. The partial pressures of the complexes in Torr, were obtained from the measured integrated absorbance and calculated oscillator strengths (f calc) of the fundamental OH-stretching band, as following: [71]. (3) p complex = 2.6935 × 1 0 − 9 K − 1 Torr m cm T ∫ A v ˜ d v ˜ f calc × l where T is the temperature in K, ∫ A v ~ d v ~ is the integrated absorbance in cm−1, l is the optical path length in meters and f calc is the intensity calculated at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level. We used the full band as the experimental intensity of the OH-stretching fundamental transition. This method has been proved to provide good results in similar studies [40,72]. According to the binding energies, the TFE–MA (D) and TFE–VA (D) conformers (OH⋯OC) are the most stable ones. Consequently, their calculated oscillator strength (1.50×10−4, 1.61×10−4) at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pvTZ level was used to determine the equilibrium constants of the complexes. A plot of p complex against p TFE × p MA/VA is shown in Fig. 5 . The equilibrium constant (K eq ) for the TFE–MA and TFE–VA complexes are determined from the slope of the least-square fitting of these data. There are two major factors which may influence the accuracy of the experimental equilibrium constant: the error introduced in the pressure measurements; the determination of the areas. According to our previous study, we noticed that the uncertainty of the pressure gauges is 5–15%. Then, the experimental K eq values at ambient condition for TFE–MA and TFE–VA were 0.28 and 0.15, respectively. These values were similar to the previously reported thermodynamic equilibrium constants of the TFE–methyl acetate and TFE–methyl formate complexes (0.54 and 0.16, respectively) determined using the same approach [37]. The K eq values revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions in the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes are similar with the TFE–methyl ester complexes. However, the calculated equilibrium constants were significantly underestimated as compared to the measured values. This is because the calculated thermodynamic equilibrium constants were strongly functional dependent. For example, for TFE–EO (g) in a similar study, the predicted values were 2.7×10−3, 1.6×10−2, and 5.5×10−2 with B3LYP, ωB97X-D and B3LYP-D3, respectively [36]. The Gibbs free energies of formation (ΔG expt θ ) can be obtained according to Eq. (2). The ΔG expt θ of TFE–unsaturated ester were found at 3.2 and 4.8kJmol−1 for TFE–MA and TFE–VA, respectively. The ΔG 298K θ values in Table 2 are slightly overestimated by several kJ mol−1."
7,Analysis of AIM and Decomposition of Interaction Energy Using GKS-EDA,"3.5 Analysis of AIM and Decomposition of Interaction Energy Using GKS-EDA In order to characterize the details of hydrogen bonding interactions, Bader's critical point analysis of the electron density (atoms in molecules, AIM) was carried out. AIM involves analysis of the electron density (ρ(r)) and Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρ(r)) in terms of critical points: nuclear critical points (located at the nuclei), bond critical points (BCPs) located between nuclei, ring critical points (RCPs), and cage critical points (CCPs). BCP corresponds to a maximum in ρ(r) characterized by ∇2ρ(r) between two neighboring nuclei, indicating the existence of a bond between them. The molecular graph (Fig. 6 ) shows the BCPs along the lines joining the OH group and the O atom (or the OC bond) as well as the CH and F atoms for the TFE–unsaturated ester complexes, which clearly proves the presence of hydrogen bonds between TFE and unsaturated esters. The topological parameters, including electron density ρ(r) and Laplacian ∇2ρ(r) at the BCPs and changes in atomic charge Δq(H) at the H atom with the B3LYP-D3 method are listed in Table 4. The electron densities at the BCPs are in the ranges of 0.0209–0.0232, 0.0226–0.0262, and 0.0083–0.0100a.u. for the OH⋯O, OH⋯OC and OH⋯π bonds, respectively. The Laplacian of electron density ∇2ρ(BCP) of the complexes is in the ranges of 0.1145–0.1294, 0.1334–0.1670, and 0.0360–0.0432a.u. for OH⋯O, OH⋯OC, and OH⋯π bonds, respectively. In most cases, the values fall in the range of 0.002–0.040a.u. (electron density) and 0.024–0.139a.u. (Laplacian of electron density) [73,74], confirming the existence of hydrogen bonds. The ∇2ρ(BCP) values of the OH⋯OC hydrogen bonds are slightly higher limit of the Laplacian criteria for a hydrogen bond. Also, in hydrogen bonded complexes, the charge transfer (CT) from the hydrogen bond acceptor to the donor is usually observed which causes the decrease in the charge on the hydrogen atom. From the AIM atomic charge difference on the H atoms (Δq(H)) upon complexation (Table 4), we can see clearly charge transfers are much larger when TFE docks at the carbonyl oxygens (0.0580–0.0839a.u.) than the ones at the ester oxygens (0.0415–0.0557a.u.) or at the π system (0.0032–0.0145a.u.). This implies that the hydrogen bond strength is strongest when TFE docks at the carbonyl group. The GKS-EDA analysis was issued to evaluate the contribution of the different energy components to the total stabilization energy of the bimolecular complexes. The total interaction energy along with the individual components are listed in Table 5. The graphical representation of different components of the total interaction energy of the most stable TFE–unsaturated ester conformers calculated at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level using the GKS-EDA method is shown in Fig. 7 . The negative values are the attractive components, i.e., ΔE ELE , ΔE EX , ΔE POL , ΔE DISP , and ΔE CORR , which give contribution to stabilize the bimolecular complexes. The ΔE REP term is positive and is not favorable for the formation of complexes. ΔE EX and ΔE REP are from the anti-symmetrization and normalization of Kohn-Sham determinants, respectively. The sum of the two terms is known as the Pauli repulsion energy (ΔE PAULI ). The relatively large ΔE POL suggests that the OH and CC orbitals in the TFE unit undergo significant changes in their shapes in order to maximize the strength of the hydrogen bond in the complexation process [75]. As seen from Table 3 , the oscillator strengths of the OH-stretching transitions are increased by 3–18 times with respect to the TFE monomer. This indicates polarization of the OH bond of TFE. It should also be noted that the contribution of correlation and dispersion interactions to total interaction, (ΔE CORR + ΔE DISP )/ΔE INT , varies from 0.79 to 1.04 for OH⋯O, 0.53 to 0.67 for OH⋯OC, and 0.88 to 1.32 for OH⋯π. The ratios demonstrate that the type of interaction is mainly n→π* [76]. In addition, ΔE ELE /ΔE INT is in the range of 0.90–1.48. On the other hand, the contribution of ΔE POL to the total interaction energies is much smaller (ΔE POL /ΔE INT =0.31–0.70) than that of ΔE ELE . The values of ΔE PAULI are positive, and ΔE PAULI /ΔE INT ranges from −1.97 to −1.33. This indicates the Pauli energy is not favorable for complexation. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding complexes could be categorized into three groups: electrostatic dominated hydrogen bonded complexes, dispersion dominated complexes and “mixed” complexes comprising of comparable magnitude of electrostatic and dispersion interactions [77,78]. Since GKS-EDA is a new energy decomposition analysis scheme, the ΔE CORR + ΔE DISP is the traditional dispersion energy as the one in the localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (LMO-EDA) scheme [46]. The ratios of ΔE ELE /ΔE INT and (ΔE CORR + ΔE DISP )/ΔE INT suggest a different contribution of ΔE ELE and (ΔE CORR + ΔE DISP ) to the total interaction, thus the OH⋯π conformers are mainly categorized as “dispersion” dominated hydrogen bonding interactions and both the OH⋯O and OH⋯OC hydrogen bonds are categorized as “electrostatic” dominated hydrogen bonding interactions."
8,Concluding Remarks,"In this article, the FTIR spectroscopic studies have carried out on 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and two unsaturated esters (methyl acrylate (MA), vinyl acetate (VA)) binary mixtures. By a combination of FTIR and DFT calculations, we firmly establish that the TFE molecule forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the unsaturated esters, whereas docking onto the ester oxygen and the π system is at least 5kJmol−1 less attractive and therefore hardly observable in the spectra. The observed red shifts of the OH-stretching transitions with regard to that of TFE were measured at 113 and 92cm−1 for TFE–MA and TFE–VA, respectively, confirming the similarity of the two unsaturated esters as a hydrogen bond acceptor. AIM results clearly predict the nature of interaction in TFE-unsaturated ester complexes, and indicate the presence of the hydrogen bond between TFE and the two unsaturated esters. A generalized Kohn−Sham energy decomposition analysis (GKS-EDA) reveals that dispersion energy is the major contributor of the total interaction energy ((ΔE CORR + ΔE DISP )/ΔE INT =0.88–1.31) of the OH⋯π conformers, while, electrostatic energy contribution to the total energy is very large (ΔE ELE /ΔE INT =1.25–1.48) in the OH⋯O and OH⋯OC conformers."
