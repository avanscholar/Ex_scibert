0,Introduction,"The depletion of oil reserves and a rapidly increasing energy demand in the world, together with many countries being interested in reducing their dependence on foreign oil, makes mixed alcohols production of fuels and chemicals via the synthesis gas route (H2/CO) very attractive. Syngas (H2/CO) can be produced by many different raw materials such as natural gas or coal. If biomass gasification (e.g. of wood or organic wastes) is used for the syngas production, it is also possible to produce greenhouse gas-neutral fuels and chemicals, at the same time as domestic energy security can be increased. Fuel alcohols have many good characteristics, for example outstanding anti-knock properties and good miscibility with gasoline, which make them attractive as octane boosters in gasoline. Mixtures of higher alcohols and methanol are preferred over pure methanol because of their higher water tolerance, reduced fuel volatility and lower vapor lock tendency and also because of their volumetric heating values are higher than for pure methanol [1]. Alkali-free MoS2 can be used as sulfur tolerant and coke resistant short hydrocarbon (methanation) catalyst in syngas conversion [2], however, when alkali (e.g. potassium) is added and pressure applied, the selectivity shifts greatly towards alcohols [3]. Promoters such as Co or Ni are often added to the alcohol catalyst to increase the higher alcohol-to-methanol ratio [3,4]. Alkali-promoted molybdenum sulfides have been shown to be among the most promising catalysts for this purpose due to their ability to catalyze the reaction with high selectivity to short alcohols (about C1–C5) as well as being sulfur tolerant. Deposition of coke is not a problem for this type of catalyst even when syngas with low H2/CO ratio is used [2]. This, together with the water-gas-shift activity, makes it suitable for use with syngas derived from coal and biomass gasification, which generally generate a syngas with low H2/CO ratio. Additional information about alkali promoted MoS2 catalysts together with other types of “higher alcohol catalysts” are available in recent as well as classic review articles [5–8]. The alcohol product distribution from alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts as well as the hydrocarbon product distribution from alkali-free MoS2 catalysts has often been deemed to approximately follow the so-called ASF (Anderson–Schulz–Flory) distribution [9]. Significant deviations from the ASF distribution are however often reported, especially for C1 species when promoters like Ni or Co are added [2,10–12]. The ASF distribution is derived from polymerization kinetics with C1 monomers and is valid when the probability of chain growth (α) is independent of chain length [13,14]. According to this model the product distribution can simply be described by a single parameter, the chain growth probability (α). This distribution can mathematically be represented in the following way: (1) S n = n ⋅ ( 1 − a ) 2 a n − 1 where S n is the carbon selectivity for chains with n carbon atoms and α is chain growth probability. A plot of ln(S n /n) vs. n (ASF plot) gives a straight line when the chain growth probability (α) is independent of n: (2) ln S n n = n ln α + ln ( 1 − a ) 2 α In the present paper, results obtained from a potassium and nickel-promoted MoS2 catalyst for alcohol synthesis are evaluated. For comparison, results from a non-promoted MoS2 catalyst are presented. The focus of this study was to investigate the effect of the operation conditions space velocity and temperature on product distribution, since, e.g. secondary reactions of previously produced reaction products seem to be of great importance for selectivity and activity in CO hydrogenation over MoS2-based catalysts. To obtain clues about how these reactions occur and find correlations patterns between the various alcohols, olefins, paraffins, esters, aldehydes, etc., particular effort has been devoted to a well-developed online gas chromatograph system to ensure accurate separation, identification and quantification of as many reaction products as possible. Correlation patterns between different reaction products and how they are affected by the process parameters are discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The unsupported alcohol synthesis catalyst (K–Ni–MoS2) was prepared from two water solutions. The first one was prepared by dissolving 12.25g (47mmol) ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, (NH4)2MoS4, in 450ml of water and the second one by dissolving 11.7g (47mmol) nickel acetate in 250ml of water. The nickel acetate solution was added dropwise under strong agitation to the (NH4)2MoS4 solution. Nickel reacted immediately with the thiomolybdate and a black suspension was formed. The catalyst precursor was matured for 1h under agitation and was then washed with ethanol and water, and centrifuged to remove excess liquid. The precursor was dried and thereafter crushed and sieved to a pellet size of 45–200μm. Finely ground K2CO3 was then mechanically mixed with the “Ni–MoS4” catalyst precursor and calcined/decomposed in a tube furnace at 450°C for 90min under flowing H2 atmosphere. During this process a great amount of sulfur is removed from the catalyst both as elemental sulfur (seen as sulfur deposits when gas was cooled down) and as hydrogen sulfide (measured with a GC equipped with sulfur chemiluminesce detector). For comparison a “pure” MoS2 catalyst was prepared by decomposition of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (NH4)2MoS4 at 500°C and 45h under flowing H2 atmosphere."
3,Catalyst characterization methods,2.2 Catalyst characterization methods Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity measurements were performed in a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 unit. The samples were evacuated and dried at 423K overnight prior to analysis and the BET area and average pore diameter were measured by N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. XRD measurements were performed on a Siemens D5000 over the 2θ range 5–100° with Cu Kα radiation with a step size of 0.02 and 10s per step. The Scherrer equation was used to estimate the crystallite size.
4,CO hydrogenation,"2.3 CO hydrogenation CO hydrogenation reactions were performed in a high-pressure down flow stainless-steel fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 9mm) with 0.65g catalyst (45–250μm) diluted by 3g SiC (average pellet size=77μm). The catalytic tests were carried out at a pressure of 91bar, with temperatures ranging from 330 to 370°C and gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) varying between 2400 and 18,000ml/(gcat h) (STP). The reactor tube was heated by means of a cascade temperature controlled oven with one sliding thermocouple in the catalyst bed and another one placed in the oven. This system together with an aluminum jacket placed outside the reactor, made an even temperature profile in the catalyst bed (set point ±0.5°C) possible. In all measurements a premixed syngas with H2/CO ratio 1:1 and 4% N2 (internal standard) was used. To prevent condensation of the products leaving the reactor, all parts after the reactor were heated to 185°C, i.e. tubes and injection valves, etc. Product analysis was carried out on-line using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detectors (FID). Light inorganic gases (H2, CO, CO2 and N2) and methane were separated on packed columns and quantified with the TCD. A two-dimensional GC system with Deans switch was used for analysis of the organic products. As primary column a polar capillary column (HP-FFAP) which separates hydrocarbons (C1–C7) from oxygenates and also separates the individual oxygenates was used. The oxygenates (alcohols, esters etc.) then continue to the first FID detector while the light hydrocarbons (C1–C7) are sent to a second capillary column (HP-Al2O3) with a capillary flow device (Deans switch). There they are separated and quantified on a second FID. This makes it possible to achieve a very good separation and quantification of most compounds in about 60min. During the first 150h on stream, the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst was run at 340°C and 91bar in syngas to create a stable catalyst, so the activity and selectivity would not change much with time on stream in the second, real, experimental part the study. After the stabilization period, experiments varying the process parameters temperature and space velocity were performed. Four different temperatures, from 330 to 370°C and for each temperature four different space velocities (2400–18,000ml/(gcat h) (STP)) were tested. Every 90min the process parameters were changed and at the end of every cycle the gas composition was measured using the GC (when the reaction temperature was changed the stabilization time was increased, by up to 30min). Temperature and space velocity changes were performed in a random order. The non-promoted MoS2 catalyst reached stable conversion levels after much shorter time on stream, so after 48h on stream, the temperatures and space velocities were varied."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the catalyst The N2 physisorption results from the investigated catalysts are presented in Table 1 and reveal that the surface area is low (3.3–8.6m2/g) and the pore size large (238–329Å) for both catalysts. The promoted catalyst has no micropores (<20Å) and the unpromoted one has very small amounts of micropores so they basically consist of only meso- and macropores. ICP measurements showed that the K/Ni and Ni/Mo molar ratios were the ones aimed for and that the sulfur content was significantly lower than in the precursor material, as expected (Table 1). The XRD diffractogram of the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst (Fig. 1 ) shows peaks typical for MoS2, however, the most intense peak is somewhat shifted towards a lower angle compared to well ordered and crystallized MoS2. This shows that the distance between the MoS2 sheets in the MoS2 sandwich-like structure is somewhat increased, which mean that there is an expansion of the c lattice parameter (Table 2 ). Earlier this expansion has been explained as a mechanism for strain relief, derived from the curvature of the layers [15,16]. The intense peak at 2θ =9.5° and the weaker peak at 2θ =19° we attribute to K x MoS2 which prior to XRD analysis has been hydrated due to contact with humid air (Fig. 1) [17,18]. The potassium is intercalated in between the MoS2 sheets together with water (after air exposure) which leads to an expansion of the c lattice parameter. A similar result was obtained with K–MoS2 prepared by decomposition of pure ammonium tetrathiomolybdate with potassium carbonate at high-temperature long decomposition/calcination times (30h at 500°C+20h at 550°C) and therefore produced strong signals at these 2θ (Fig. 1). It is known that cations or neutral molecules can be inserted between MoS2 sheets but the preparation route is normally quite different from the one used in our work [19,20]. Recently, however, a patent for syngas to alcohols displayed the possibility of producing potassium-intercalated Co–MoS2 [21]. Two peaks at 2θ 29.8° and 30.8° which previously have been proposed to be due to K–Mo–S phase are also visible [22]; even though we do not rule out this possibility, it is more reasonable to believe that the phase is K2SO4 since in addition to the strong intensity peaks at 29.8° and 30.8° also low intensity peaks at 37.0° and 43.6° are observed. Crystalline Ni2S3 is also apparent and this is no surprise since it well known that the MoS2-like phase cannot hold more than about 0.4–0.5molar% Ni/Mo without formation of a separate nickel phase [23]. Table 2 summarizes crystal lattice parameters and crystallite size calculated from XRD patterns for the promoted and non-promoted MoS2 catalysts as well as the corresponding layer stacking heights."
7,Catalytic CO hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic CO hydrogenation 3.2.1 Effect of temperature and space velocity on CO conversion and water-gas-shift In Fig. 2 the CO conversion for the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst at four different space velocities and four temperatures is presented. The CO conversion for the non-promoted MoS2 catalyst is only presented at 370°C (Fig. 2). The product gas composition reveals that the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst is very close to the water-gas-shift (WGS) equilibrium under all tested conditions, while the gas composition with the MoS2 catalyst is quite far from WGS equilibrium at low temperature and high space velocity. The WGS equilibrium favors conversion of H2O and CO, to CO2 and H2, at the studied temperatures, which means that high amounts of CO2 and small amounts of water are produced with a WGS active catalyst (Eq. (3), the WGS reaction): (3) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 From reaction stoichiometry therefore, as a rule of thumb, almost 0.5mol of CO2 would be produced per mol of converted CO in paraffin synthesis from syngas with a WGS active catalyst (an example is methane formation Eq. (4)). This can be compared to ethanol synthesis (Eq. (5)) in which only 0.33mol CO2 is produced per mol CO converted or methanol synthesis where no CO2 at all is produced. (4) 2CO+2H2 →CH4 +CO2 (5) 3CO+3H2 →C2H5OH+CO2 At low space velocity (1800ml/(gcat h)) and high temperature (370°C) the MoS2 catalyst starts to approach equilibrium (0.45 CO2/COconverted) but the higher the space velocity the further away from equilibrium we get (0.29 CO2/COconverted at 18,000ml/(gcat h)). Promoted MoS2 catalysts are used as sulfur-tolerant WGS catalysts and also unpromoted MoS2 is reported to be WGS active [2], therefore it was unexpected that the WGS activity of the non-promoted MoS2 was not enough to reach equilibrium under most reaction conditions. It is well known that promoters like K, Ni, Co increase water-gas-shift activity [24,25], however, as said earlier it should also be pointed out that significantly more water is produced in hydrocarbon synthesis from syngas (if the organic product formation rate is the same), than in short alcohol synthesis. 3.2.2 Selectivity for the non-promoted catalyst (MoS2) The non-promoted MoS2 catalyst produces mainly paraffins, but also minor amounts of olefins and alcohols. Product distribution is to a relatively low extent affected by space velocity changes, while temperature influences the product distribution to a significantly larger degree. In Fig. 3 an ASF plot for paraffins and alcohols at two temperatures (340°C and 370°C) and gas hourly space velocity, 6000ml/(gcat h), is presented. Also the selectivity (in carbon %) for each paraffin and alcohol is presented next to its carbon number in the figure. Significant deviations (non-straight line) from the standard ASF distribution can be seen at lower carbon numbers (C1–C2) for paraffins (compared to the ASF-distributed C3–C6 paraffins) while the alcohols (C1–C3, i.e. methanol, ethanol, propanol) are ASF distributed under all tested conditions (340–370°C and GHSV 2400–18,000ml/(gcat h)). Surprisingly, ethane (C2) selectivity is larger than methane (C1) selectivity under all reaction conditions (examples of this can be seen in Fig. 3) and this has to our knowledge previously only been shown for promoted (but alkali-free) MoS2 catalysts [2]. Increasing the temperature from 340°C to 370°C leads to increased short paraffin selectivity (C1–C2) and decreased longer paraffin selectivity (C3–C6) (Fig. 3). In ASF distribution terms, the chain growth probability is decreased with increased temperature for C3–C6 paraffins. The same trend occurs when space velocity is decreased as when temperature is raised, but to a much lower degree. With decreased space velocity and increased temperature the olefin selectivity (not shown) is decreased from at the most 1% to at the lowest around 0.2%. The selectivity to alcohols is decreased from 4.5% at high space velocity and low temperature (18,200ml/(gcat h) and 340°C), to about 0.5% at low space velocity and high temperature (1830ml/(gcat h) and 370°C). That the alcohol and olefin selectivities for the non-promoted MoS2 are decreased by decreased space velocity or increased temperature indicates that the alcohols and olefins may be consumed in secondary reactions and hydrogenated to paraffins. 3.2.3 Selectivity for the promoted catalyst (K–Ni–MoS2) For the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst, however, the hydrocarbon and alcohol selectivities are to a greater extent correlated to the CO conversion level and the trend is very clear (Fig. 4 ). With hydrocarbon and alcohol selectivities we in practice mean the sum of C1–C7 chains since the level of longer chains is virtually zero. The alcohol catalyst also produces other non-alcohol oxygenates in smaller amounts, below 10% (Fig. 4). They were mainly short aldehydes (largely acetaldehyde) and short esters (e.g. ethyl acetate), but also very small amounts of ketones (e.g. acetone); the “by products” formation will be discussed in more detail later. If the conversion is increased or decreased by space velocity changes or variation in temperature, the selectivity trends are still the same and strongly correlated to the CO conversion level. As the conversion level was increased, the selectivity to hydrocarbons increased while the selectivity to alcohols decreased. D. Li et al. as well as Christensen et al., have earlier, in line with our findings, also noted that an increased reaction temperature leads to decreased alcohol selectivity and increased hydrocarbon selectivity [11,26]. Increased conversion also led to an increased ratio between longer and shorter alcohols. At low conversion level (i.e. high space velocity and low temperature), the selectivity to methanol is high and a small amount of methane is produced (Fig. 5 ). This indicates that methanol is a primary product with this catalyst and that the methane formation is drastically decreased due to the presence of the potassium promoter. When conversion is increased (by decreased space velocity and/or increased temperature) the selectivity shifts towards longer alcohols (Figs. 6–8 ) which are thermodynamically more stable than the shorter ones, but also towards hydrocarbons which are more stable than alcohols (Figs. 9 and 10 ). We consider methane and other paraffins as final products while the alcohols can participate in various secondary reactions in which they can grow into longer alcohols or be hydrogenated and dehydrated to hydrocarbons. There is therefore an inherent difficulty in achieving both high syngas conversion and high alcohol selectivity. Why the selectivity is strongly correlated to conversion can easily be seen by comparing the space time yield to alcohols and hydrocarbons at different temperatures and space velocities (Fig. 11 ), where the alcohol yield is decreased significantly with decreased space velocity while the hydrocarbon space time yield is more or less constant or slowly increasing. On the contrary, the hydrocarbon yield for the non-promoted MoS2 catalyst decreases significantly with decreased space velocity (from 22mmol/(gcat h) at the highest tested space (velocity 18,200ml/(gcat h)) to 10mmol/(gcat h) at the lowest tested (1800ml/(gcat h)) at 370°C). At high temperature and low space velocity the selectivity to isobutanol (and also branched pentanols) (Fig. 7) is surprisingly high, since most previous studies have shown that catalysts based on alkali-promoted MoS2 produce mainly linear alcohols [3,27]. This is most pronounced when the reaction temperature is 370°C and the space velocity 2400ml/(gcat h). Such a high level of isobutanol has to our knowledge never been found even if i-butanol/n-butanol ratios higher than one have been reported [28]. Generally most tests are however performed at somewhat lower temperatures and this may at least partly explain our results. Also branched pentanols are created, but it is not possible to differentiate between 3-methyl-1-BuOH and 2-metyl-1-BuOH (or a mixture), because of the identical retention times in our GC system. The positions of the branching and their relative amounts might have given clues about the formation mechanism for the branched alcohols. The branched hexanols consist mostly of a mixture of different mono methyl-branched hexanols. 3.2.4 Correlation between alcohol, aldehyde and olefin selectivities A large difference between the non-promoted MoS2 catalyst and the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst is not only the great change in alcohol and hydrocarbon selectivities when promoters are added, the hydrocarbon product distribution is also significantly changed. The non-promoted MoS2 produces virtually only paraffins and almost no olefins (<1%), while the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst produces much more olefins (Figs. 9 and 10) and not so much paraffins and the olefin to paraffin ratio therefore becomes much greater. One of the effects of the potassium addition is to greatly reduce the catalyst's hydrogenation ability and this is also in line with what has been identified as a major effect of alkali promoters on CO hydrogenation over transition metal catalysts [29–31]. This fact is also supported by the previous observation that ethylene hydrogenation activity is greatly reduced by potassium addition to a Co–MoS2 catalyst [24]. Reduced hydrogenation activity might be a necessary key step to achieve alcohol formation, since the alcohol (or alcohol precursor) otherwise quickly would be hydrogenated (and dehydrated) to the corresponding hydrocarbon. One hypothesis is that elimination reactions of water from the alcohol (alcohol precursor) might produce the corresponding olefin. In the present study, it was observed that a very strong correlation exists between alcohol and aldehyde selectivities for identical carbon skeletons for both branched and non-branched products (C2–C6). This can be illustrated in an ASF distribution plot of alcohol and aldehyde (Fig. 12a–e). The fact that the n-aldehyde plot is a mirror image of the n-alcohol plot (however with significantly lower levels of aldehydes) under all sixteen tested reaction conditions (four different temperatures and four different space velocities) shows that their formation paths are very strongly linked, meaning that the alcohol might be formed by hydrogenation of the thermodynamically less stable aldehyde (aldehyde precursor). At low temperature and high space velocity (i.e. low conversion) the ASF plots are quite linear for most products (Fig. 12e) meaning the shown reactions follow polymerization kinetics, but as the space velocity was decreased and temperature increased deviations from an ideal ASF distribution are visible (Fig. 12a–d). Also α-olefin selectivity is correlated with the corresponding n-alcohol (and n-aldehyde) selectivity, this can be seen by studying the change in the ASF plots for alcohols and olefins as they progressively change when the space velocity is changed at 370°C (Fig. 12a–d). This is especially clear at low space velocity since C2 alcohol, C2 olefin and C2 aldehyde all are significantly lower than what would be expected according to a straight ASF plot line (with constant chain growth probability based on the C3+ products) (Fig. 12a). The deviation from the ideal ASF line (non-straight line) at 370°C and GHSV=2400ml/(gcat h) might show that the catalyst surface probably becomes depleted in C2 species under these reaction conditions because of low conversion rate from C1 to C2 species and fast conversion of C2 to C2+ species under these reaction conditions. The correlation between n-alcohols and α-olefins is under all conditions quite strong and the slopes of the ASF lines for C2+ alcohols and olefins are similar (the same chain growth probability under the same reaction conditions) (Fig. 12a–e), however, for C2, i.e. ethanol and ethene, there is a significant deviation during all reactions performed at “low temperature” with too little ethene produced to correlate with ethanol in the ASF plot (Fig. 12e). At high temperature (370°C) this deviation was still present at high space velocity (18,000ml/(gcat h)) (Fig. 12d), but as the space velocity was decreased the selectivity to ethanol relative to ethene was decreased, since the ethanol selectivity is decreasing much faster than the ethene selectivity (Fig. 12a–d). At the lowest tested space velocity 2400ml/(gcat h) and 370°C (Fig. 12a) the ethene level was therefore even higher than what would be expected looking at the alcohol selectivity. In line with the earlier presented hypothesis, it can be suggested that ethanol is dehydrated to the thermodynamically more stable ethene on the catalyst, and that this reaction is favored by low space velocity and high temperature and is therefore the reason for the increased ethene to ethanol (acetaldehyde) ratio. Some of this ethene is most probably also hydrogenated to the corresponding paraffin even though potassium slows down this rate significantly. 3.2.5 Alcohol chain growth The reaction mechanism for alcohol synthesis is to a great extent unclear but addition of various alcohols (methanol, ethanol), aldehydes (acetaldehyde), and olefins (ethene, propene) to syngas under reaction conditions has shown that the added molecules can grow into longer alcohols and hydrocarbons [32–35]. In our view, the very similar “shape” (or slope) of the ASF plots for alcohols, aldehydes and α-olefins point to the fact that they derive from the same surface intermediate and that the chain growth occurs through this common intermediate. The linear ASF plots for linear primary alcohols, linear aldehydes and linear α-olefins indicate that the growth occurs according to polymerization kinetics (ASF) with a stepwise insertion of a C1 monomer unit and that the chain growth probability is independent of chain length according to polymerization kinetics, and the termination probability for aldehyde, olefin and alcohol formation also seems to be more or less independent of chain length. This is at least true for molecules containing more than two carbon atoms. Santiesteban et al. performed addition experiments with labeled 13C methanol under reaction conditions containing syngas with a CsOOCH/MoS2 catalyst and showed that the terminal carbon of the C2–C4 alcohols was enriched with 13C which shows that the alcohols were formed by CO insertion at the α-carbon of the growing alcohol chain and no coupling between methanol molecules occurs [36]. For the K/Co/MoS2 catalyst the results for C2–C3 alcohols were presented and for propanol two isotopic species CH3 13CH2CH2OH and 13CH3CH2CH2OH were present, however, no 13CH3 13CH2CH2OH and for ethanol the terminal carbon was enriched. The question of why the two alkali-promoted catalysts show a very different propanol isotope distribution was not answered, however, it was proposed that a “σ-di bonded ethylene” intermediate was responsible for the two different isotope species for the K/Co/MoS2 catalyst. This means that the alcohols could grow by a mechanism, where an intermediate step is similar to “oxo synthesis” (olefin reaction with syngas). This reaction is also known to produce a mixture between branched and straight products, decided by catalyst and reaction conditions used. This mechanism could therefore possibly explain the formation of branched alcohols at high temperature and low space velocity obtained in this work. On the other hand, ethanol co-feed experiments by Christensen et al. showed that coupling between ethanol molecules occurs [33] and an aldol condensation mechanism was proposed. In most earlier reported work the reaction temperature has been significantly lower than 370°C and this could be an explanation of why the reported isobutanol selectivity has been significantly lower. Nevertheless it should be concluded that the alcohol product distribution for linear C2+ alcohols follows ASF distribution even when the isobutanol (branched alcohol) selectivity is high (Fig. 12a). At high temperature and low space velocity (seen best at 2400ml/(gcat h), 370°C) it may be observed that the product gas becomes depleted in ethanol and that the isobutanol selectivity is high (see ASF plot, Figs. 6, 7 and 12a). Similar but more pronounced effects have been shown in work with alkali-promoted high-temperature methanol catalysts (Cr, Zn, Mn), where higher alcohol (isobutanol) formation is favored by higher temperature and lower space velocity (compared to methanol synthesis) and where the alcohol product gas becomes depleted in ethanol [37]. In our view it appears that alcohol chain growth could be thought upon as a combination of two main reaction paths, linear growth (α-growth) and β-growth. In linear growth the carbon is inserted on the α-carbon of the growing chain and this is the most frequently discussed mechanism for chain growth on this type of catalyst; it seems to dominate also in this work at lower temperature and higher space velocities since the alcohol product contains mostly linear ASF-distributed alcohols. In β-growth the carbon is inserted on the β-carbon of the growing alcohol chain and this is needed to explain the formation of branched products; the reaction is favored by high temperature and low space velocity. According to this theory linear growth (α-growth) and β-growth could reflect two quite different alcohol formation mechanisms or just be a small modification of the kinetics for a single formation mechanism. The two mechanisms could, for example, be CO insertion on the α-carbon and aldol condensation. An example of a single chain growth mechanism could be that an α-olefin-like species is involved and that the changed iso-butanol/n-butanol ratio with temperature simply could reflect the fact that isobutanol formation from propene at low temperature is kinetically limited and n-butanol formation favored, but as the temperature increases the thermodynamically more stable product, isobutanol, gains ground. 3.2.6 Ester formation The ester selectivity is between 2 and 8%C under the studied reaction conditions (Fig. 13 ) and there is a strong carbon chain length correlation between alcohol and ester selectivities. An ester can be thought of as a combination of two alcohol chains (Fig. 14 ), part 1 with the carbonyl group (acyl or formyl group) and part 2 containing the alkoxy group; e.g. the selectivity to propyl acetate (C3 +C2) is correlated to the propanol (C3) (part 2, alkoxy group) and ethanol (C2) (part 1, acyl group) selectivities. Since alcohols and aldehyde selectivities for a given chain length are correlated (as explained earlier) also aldehyde selectivity is correlated to ester selectivity. The alkoxy part of the ester molecule (x-axis in Fig. 15a–d) is correlated to the amount of alcohol in an almost linear manner, however, significantly more methyl esters are formed than predicted from the methanol selectivity, which might indicate that the C1 species (a methanol-like species, e.g. methoxy anion) is more reactive than the corresponding longer-chained species. However for the carbonyl part (acyl and formyl parts) (y-axis in Fig. 15a–d) there is an opposite correlation, i.e. much less formate esters (C1 in part 1) are formed than expected, while the acetate (C2) and propionate (C3) esters are correlated almost proportionally to the corresponding ethanol (C2) and propanol (C3) alcohol selectivities. The total ester selectivity is higher at lower temperatures than at 370°C but the correlation patterns between esters and alcohols are easier to show at high temperatures when the esters and alcohols are longer and are therefore used in these figures. Note that we talk about selectivity in terms of molecules, in this part about esters, and not based on carbon atoms as we do in the rest of the paper. This is done to make comparison possible and correlation patterns clear. It was not possible to separate the C3 esters from each other on the analytical system used in these measurements, i.e. methyl acetate and ethyl formate are both counted as methyl acetate, which means that its amount is overestimated since there is also some ethyl formate. The ethyl formate selectivity, however, is expected to be low compared to the methyl acetate selectivity since the methyl formate and propyl formate selectivities are low; significantly less ethyl formate than methyl formate is expected. Co-feed experiments with isotope-labeled methanol (C13) [36] have shown that the methyl group of methyl acetate is enriched with C13 as well as the terminal carbon in the acetate part, while the carbonyl carbon consists of C12 derived from the syngas. For methyl formate the terminal group is also C13 enriched, meaning it is methanol derived while the carbonyl carbon lacks C13 meaning that it is derived from the syngas. These results are in line with the experimental findings of this study."
8,Conclusions,"In the present study, the effect of temperature and space velocity using a K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst for mixed alcohol synthesis from syngas has been described and compared to a non promoted MoS2 catalyst. Together with the detailed product analysis the following conclusions can be drawn. It was found that the non-promoted MoS2 catalyst shows high paraffin selectivity (94.5–99.3%) in the tested temperature and space velocity ranges (340–370°C, 1830–18,200ml/(gcat h)), while the alcohol (0.5–4.5%C) and olefin (0.2–1%C) selectivities were low. The alcohol and olefin selectivities were found to decrease with decreasing space velocity (GHSV) and (especially) increasing temperature which indicates that they were consumed and hydrogenated to the corresponding paraffins. The much greater olefin to paraffin ratio over the promoted MoS2 catalyst compared to the non-promoted one indicates that one function of the potassium promoters is to greatly reduce the hydrogenation function of the catalyst. This makes us believe that reduced hydrogenation activity is a key step to achieve high alcohol and olefin selectivities. Less methane than what could be expected according to the ASF distribution was produced under all reaction conditions, while the alcohols were ASF distributed. With the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst the alcohol and hydrocarbon selectivities were found to depend very much on the CO conversion level. Independently of whether CO conversion is increased with increased temperature (330 to 370°C) or decreased space velocity (2400 to 18,000ml/(gcat h)), the trend is the same, with decreased alcohol selectivity and increased hydrocarbon selectivity. Besides this, increased CO conversion leads to a greater long-to-short alcohol chain ratio and high levels of isobutanol (9%) are formed at low space velocity and high temperature (2400ml/(gcat h) and 370°C). These results point in the direction of shorter alcohols being building blocks for longer alcohols and that alcohols can be converted to hydrocarbons by secondary reactions. Therefore there is an inherent difficulty in achieving both high single-path conversion and high longer-alcohol selectivity over this catalyst. Comparing the aldehyde and alcohol selectivities it is apparent that they are strongly correlated (they display identical deviations and chain growth probabilities) and this indicates that they derive from the same intermediate. In addition, olefin selectivity is correlated to alcohol selectivity but the correlation is not as strong as between aldehydes and alcohols. There are some indications that the olefins might be produced by dehydration of alcohols. Significant amounts of esters are also produced with the K–Ni–MoS2 catalyst (up to 8%) and their chain length distribution is strongly correlated to the alcohol (and aldehyde) chain length distribution. An ester can be thought upon as a combination of two alcohols (with some H2 removed) and in the same way the ester selectivity is correlated almost proportionally to the selectivity of the two corresponding alcohol selectivities. This means that, e.g. ethyl propionate (C5) selectivity is correlated to a combination of ethanol (C2) and propanol (C3) selectivities. Much less (alkoxy) formate esters and more methyl esters are, however, formed than expected according to the methanol content relative to the other alcohols."
