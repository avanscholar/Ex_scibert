0,Introduction,"Solar-driven water splitting to generate H2 and O2 is regarded as one of the most ideal approaches for addressing the increasing global energy demand and environmental issues [1–8]. Photoactive multinary sulfide semiconductors have attracted considerable attention as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation [9–15]. However, the fast recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes, slow kinetics of O2 evolution, photocorrosion from the in situ reactive oxygen species, and the safety requirements for O2/H2 separation all seriously suppress the potential of photocatalytic mass production of H2 [7,16–18]. To address these issues, various sacrificial agents (such as triethanolamine, lactic acid, and S2−/SO3 2−) have been introduced into these photocatalytic systems to achieve rapid consumption of the photogenerated holes for achieving more reliable evaluation of H2 production. However, for practical applications, the addition of sacrificial agents increases the system cost, generates unwanted by-products, and results in under-utilization of the oxidizing power of the photogenerated holes [19–23]. For sustainability, it is highly desirable to replace the half-reaction of water oxidation (or hole scarification) with more favorable organic oxidation reactions, achieving simultaneous solar co-production of H2 and value-added organic chemicals in pure water [24–30]. This, of course, poses new challenges for the photocatalyst design in terms of the active sites, selectivity, and reaction synergy beyond H2 production. Recently, metal chalcogenides have attracted much attention for photo-redox reactions due to their unique optoelectronic and photochemical characteristics [6,10,11]. However, most metal chalcogenides, such as isolated ZnInS4 and CdS, still cannot meet the standard for efficient solar light utilization because of the unsatisfactory charge separation and potentially low stability due to photocorrosion [24,31–35]. In order to solve these problems, rational coupling of heterostructures has been regarded as a promising method of improving the separation and utilization of the photo-generated charge carriers, as well as the light absorption, and improving the photostability of the catalyst [33,36–38]. Apart from charge transfer considerations, structure/morphology engineering of the catalysts also plays a key role in realizing efficient photocatalytic reactions, where a hierarchical porous architecture can offer a high specific area with abundant active sites and efficiently shorten the diffusion distance of the reacting substances to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion [39]. In this field, porous metal-coordination polymers (PMCPs) with controlled architecture have gained prominence for use as sacrificial precursors in the construction of advanced porous materials by controlled chemical/thermal treatment [6,11,12,40–46]. For example, a NiS/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure was synthesized via the sulfurization of Zn- and Ni-doped Cd-PMCP, achieving a H2 production rate of 16.78 mmol·g−1·h−1 with Na2S and Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agents [11]. Integrating ZIF-67-derived hollow Co9S8 nanoparticles with 2D ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been confirmed as an effective method for constructing hierarchical photocatalysts, with a H2 production rate of 6.25 mmol·g−1·h−1, using triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent [6]. Literature reports suggest that various PMCPs may be ideal precursor templates for the construction of efficient photocatalysts with advanced architectures [6,11]. However, most of these reported photocatalytic systems for H2 evolution still require the addition of large amounts of sacrificial agents to overcome the chare separation and hole consumption issues. Therefore, constructing hierarchical heterostructures for efficient solar coproduction of H2 and organic chemicals in pure water still remains a great challenge. Aromatic aldehydes and ketones are important industrial raw materials or intermediates for pharmaceuticals, dyes, perfumes, and other fine chemicals [47,48]. These compounds are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions, requiring toxic chemical oxidants, high temperature, and high pressure, leading to high cost and environmental pollution. Solar-driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) is a promising alternative for coupling with H2 production under mild conditions as it is economically feasible and thermodynamically achievable for simultaneously utilizing the photogenerated holes and electrons [24,30]. However, to date, efficient solar co-production of H2 and oxidation of BA with noble metal-free photocatalysts has rarely been evaluated. Herein, starting from Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived bimetallic sulfide Fe4Ni5S8 (FNS), a series of porous hierarchical structures, i.e., Fe4Ni5S8@ZnIn2S4 (FNS@ZIS) with different FNS loadings (n%) (n = 19, 26 and 32, denoted as FNS@ZIS-1, FNS@ZIS-2, and FNS@ZIS-3), are synthesized by the in situ growth of ZIS nanosheets on FNS nanoparticles (Scheme 1 ). The unique hierarchical porous architecture offers a high specific area with abundant active sites and facilitates interfacial charge separation and bimetallic synergy. The resulting porous hierarchical structures can be used as efficient bifunctional photocatalysts for simultaneous H2 production and highly selective oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde (BAD). A series of control experiments demonstrate that FNS@ZIS-2 affords a photoexcited H2 evolution rate of 10465 μmol·g−1·h−1, along with high selectivity for BA oxidation (>99.9%). The H2 evolution rate is 22, 31, and 13 times higher than those of FNS, ZIS, and CuFeS2@ZIS, respectively, and is even superior to that of the state-of-the-art photocatalysts with various sacrificial agents, further proving the unique advantage of the hierarchical architecture and Fe-Ni synergystic effect [12,14,19,22]."
1,Experimental,
2,"Synthesis of M[Fe(CN)5NO]·xH2O (MFe-PBA) (M = Ni, Cu, Fe)","2.1 Synthesis of M[Fe(CN)5NO]·xH2O (MFe-PBA) (M = Ni, Cu, Fe) A mixed solution of M(Ac)2⋅6H2O (M = Ni, Cu), FeCl3⋅6H2O (0.1 mmol), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) (15 mg) in 8 mL water and 2 mL methanol was added to a solution of sodium nitroferricyanide dihydrate (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 8 mL water and 2 mL methanol under stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with mixed water/ethanol before drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight."
3,Synthesis of FNS,"2.2 Synthesis of FNS The as-synthesized NiFe-PBA (18 mg) was added to 15 mL of an ethanolic solution of thioacetamide (TAA; 30 mg) followed by stirring for 10 min. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (capacity of 25 mL) and heated to 180 °C and kept at this temperature for 3 h. The obtained black precipitate was separated by centrifugation and subsequently washed with ethanol thrice and dried at 60 °C. Finally, the sulfurized samples were heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere and kept for 6 h to obtain the required FNS nanoparticles for the following syntheses."
4,Synthesis of FNS@ZIS,"2.3 Synthesis of FNS@ZIS The hierarchical FNS@ZIS nanostructures were synthesized through a modified low-temperature solvothermal method according to the literature [6]. Certain amounts of FNS (e.g. 12, 18, and 24 mg) were added to 8 mL of H2O (pH = 2.5 adjusted with 1 M HCl) and 2 mL of glycerol, followed by stirring for 10 min. Thereafter, 45 mg of ZnCl2, 98 mg of In(NO3)3·4H2O, and 50 mg of TAA were added to the above solution. The obtained mixture was heated at 80 °C in an oil bath under stirring. After 10 h, the products were separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol four times and vacuum dried at 60 °C. The obtained samples with FNS ratios of 19%, 26%, and 32% are denoted as FNS@ZIS-1, FNS@ZIS-2, and FNS@ZIS-3, respectively. For comparison, pure ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanosheets were synthesized under the same reaction conditions without the addition of FNS. To further demonstrate the bimetallic Ni-Fe synergetic effect, FeS@ZIS and CuFeS2@ZIS were also synthesized by a method similar to that used for FNS@ZIS."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer using KBr disks, in the scanning range of 4000–400 cm−1. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Morphological and elemental mapping analysis of the samples was performed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova Nano SEM 230) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Talos F200X). UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were acquired using a Lambda 750 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, America). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired with a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). The time-resolved PL decay curves were obtained on a Microtime 200 confocal fluorescence microscopy imager (PicoQuant, Germany) and the data were analyzed by using SymPho Time 64 software. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a PHI ESCA-5000C electron spectrometer. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BET surface area were determined using a BELSORP-Max multi-station specific surface micropore and vapor adsorption analyzer (MicrotracBEL, Japan)."
6,Photoelectrochemical characterization,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical characterization Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. A platinum plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 3 mg of the photocatalyst was added to a mixed solution of 210 μL of ethanol, 70 μL of ultra-pure water, and 30 μL of 5% Nafion solution to make a uniform slurry under ultrasonication. Thereafter, 100 μL of the slurry was dropcasted onto FTO glass electrodes (1 cm2). All measurements were carried out in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at the open circuit potential over the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. Mott-Schottky plots were acquired at frequencies of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kHz. Transient photocurrent measurements were performed at 0.4 V with an illumination/dark interval of 10 s. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of BA and BAD was performed by sweeping at 50 mV s−1 in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous in the presence of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M BA and BAD, for which a glassy carbon electrode, a platinum plate, and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The redox potentials of BA and BAD were evaluated from analysis of the voltammograms."
7,Photocatalytic activity measurements,"2.6 Photocatalytic activity measurements Typically, 1 mg of the photocatalysts (FNS@ZIS-1, FNS@ZIS-2, FNS@ZIS-3, FNS, ZIS, FeS@ZIS, and CuFeS2@ZIS), 5 mL of H2O, and 20 μL BA were combined in a 16.5 mL gas-closed glass reactor. The mixture was first bubbled with argon for 30 min and there after irradiated in the visible light region with a 300 W Xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The amount of H2 evolved in the photocatalytic process was quantified using a GC-2014 micro gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Japan) with argon as the carrier gas. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, LC-2030, Shimadzu, Japan) and a digital NMR spectrometer were employed to analyze the liquid products in the photocatalytic process. For comparison, the photocatalytic performance of FNS@ZIS-2 in the dark and under full-spectrum irradiation with a Xe lamp without any filter was also evaluated. Isotopic labeling experiments were conducted by following a similar procedure, except that D2O was used instead of H2O and the gaseous products were analyzed by using an online quantitative mass spectrometer (HPR-20 Q/C Benchtop Gas Analysis System)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and structural characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and structural characterization The porous hierarchical FNS@ZIS structures were synthesized by in situ growth of the ZIS nanosheets on the porous bimetallic FNS nanospheres derived from PBA nanocubes. A series of FNS@ZIS core–shell hierarchical structures FNS@ZIS-1, FNS@ZIS-2, and FNS@ZIS-3 was prepared by adjusting the loading amount of FNS. In this process, the bimetallic NiFe-PBA nanocubes were synthesized by the co-precipitation reaction of K3[Fe(CN)5(NO)]·H2O and Ni(Ac)2·H2O in the presence of PVP in water for 3 h. The obtained NiFe-PBA nanocubes were analyzed via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The characteristic FTIR absorption peaks at 2165 cm−1 can be attributed to the υ(C≡N) vibration, and that at 1946 cm−1 is attributed to υ(N=O), suggesting successful incorporation of the key components for the PBA framework (Fig. S1, Supporting Information) [49]. The PXRD pattern of NiFe-PBA in Fig. S2a(a) is consistent with that from theoretical analysis (JCPDS No. 43-0772). Both results confirm successful preparation of the bimetallic NiFe-PBA solid solution as the FNS precursor to achieve uniform distribution of the two metal cations. In NiFe-PBA, each iron ion is coordinated by five C atoms from five cyano groups and one N atom from NO+, while each nickel ion is coordinated with five N atoms from five cyano groups to achieve uniform distribution of the two metal cations (Fig. S2b, Supporting Information). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the NiFe-PBA samples were dominated by nanocubes with sizes of ~50–150 nm (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). Through solvothermal sulfurization and thermal treatment, the as-synthesized NiFe-PBA was converted to FNS nanospheres, as confirmed by FTIR and PXRD (JCPDS No. 78-0167, Fig. S4b, Supporting Information). After sulfurization, FNS nanospheres of 40-120 nm were obtained, the surface of which became rougher compared to that of the original NiFe-PBA nanocubes (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). The morphological change may be attributed to permeation of sulfur anions into the structure and rapid diffusion of the metal cations from the small particles during the sulfurization process, resulting in the formation of nanospheres with a rough surface. The ZIS nanosheets were then grown in situ on the surface of the FNS nanospheres to form a FNS@ZIS hierarchical core–shell structure via a low-temperature solvothermal method. As shown in Fig. S6, the diffraction peaks of FNS@ZIS at 2θ values of 29.3°, 30.6°, 46.8°, and 51.1° could be identified as those of FNS (JCPDS 78-0167), while the peaks at 27.7°, 37.1°, and 47.4° could be assigned to ZIS (JCPDS 72-0773, Fig. S7, Supporting Information). These results demonstrate the existence of both FNS and ZIS in the composite. Further, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study indicated that the curled ZIS nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 6.4 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of the FNS nanospheres in FNS@ZIS-2 ( Fig. 1 a). When the loading amount (n%) of FNS was varied, ZIS nanosheets with very similar thicknesses were formed in FNS@ZIS-1 (8.7 nm) and FNS@ZIS-3 (5.2 nm) (Fig. S8, Supporting Information). As evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1b), the ZIS nanosheets were coated on the surface of the FNS nanospheres to form a hierarchical core–shell heterostructure. As confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; see Fig. 1c), the d-spacings of 0.23 and 0.32 nm could be indexed to the (200) facet of FNS and the (102) facet of ZIS, respectively, indicating the close interfacial contact of FNS and ZIS in this heterostructure. Elemental mapping images also show the well-defined spatial distribution of Zn, In, S, Fe, and Ni in the composite, where Fe and Ni were mainly localized in the center of the nanospheres, further confirming the formation of the hierarchical FNS@ZIS core–shell structure (Fig. 1d). To confirm the porosity of the heterostructures, nitrogen sorption isotherms of FNS, ZIS, and FNS@ZIS-2 were acquired at 77 K (Fig. 2 ). A type IV isotherm with typical H3 hysteresis was observed, indicating the existence of mesopores in the three samples. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the micropores with sizes of ca. 1.1 nm, derived from the NiFe-PBA framework, were maintained in the FNS nanospheres, along with mesopores with dimensions of 15.96 nm. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of FNS, ZIS, and FNS@ZIS-2 are 136, 80 and 115 m2 g−1, with pore volumes of 0.376, 0.059, and 0.348 cm3 g−1, respectively. Clearly, the FNS@ZIS-2 hierarchical core–shell structure is characterized by porosity, which greatly increased the BET surface area and pore volume compared to those of the pure ZIS nanosheets. This porous feature not only shortens the diffusion distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides efficient transport pathways for both the substrates and products for heterogeneous catalysis. In order to further validate the structure and surface electronic states of the core–shell heterostructure, FNS, and FNS@ZIS-2 were subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for comparison (Fig. 3 ). The full survey spectrum of FNS@ZIS-2 indicates the existence of S, In, Zn, Ni, Fe, C, and O in the composite (Fig. S9, Supporting Information). The C and O originate from the conducting resin and the adsorbed gaseous molecules. The two peaks at 445.1 and 452.7 eV in Fig. 3(a) can be assigned to InIII 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2, respectively. The Zn 2p XPS spectrum showed 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 peaks appearing at 1045.6 and 1022.4 eV, corresponding to Zn2+ in ZIS (Fig. 3b). The high-resolution sulfur XPS spectrum (Fig. 3c) showed 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 peaks at 163.2 and 162.0 eV, respectively, attributed to the characteristic metal–S (M–S) bond of ZIS. The other two peaks at 162.7 (S 2p 1/2) and 161.5 eV (S 2p 3/2) can be assigned to the characteristic bimetallic M–S bond of FNS [6]. In the Fe 2p spectrum of FNS@ZIS-2, the peaks at binding energies of 710.6 and 724.0 eV can be assigned to FeII, while the two main peaks appearing at 713.3 eV and 726.4 eV can be ascribed to FeIII. These results reveal the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the FNS@ZIS-2 heterostructures (Fig. S10, Supporting Information) [50,51]. The two pairs of peaks at 858.0 and 876.0 eV and at 856.5 and 874.1 eV correspond to NiIII 2p and NiII 2p, respectively (Fig. 3d). Notably, the binding energy of the NiII 2p peak of FNS@ZIS-2 was up-shifted by 2.9 eV with respect to that of pure FNS (NiII 2p 3/2 at 853.6 eV and NiII 2p 1/2 at 871.2 eV) [51–53], suggestive of strong electronic interactions between FNS and ZIS, which could enhance the interfacial charge transfer and separation during the catalytic process. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) reveal that the FNS@ZIS composites possess good visible-light harvesting capability (Fig. S11, Supporting Information). The bandgaps (E g) of FNS and ZIS were determined to be 1.30 and 2.29 eV based on the Kubelka–Munk formula (Fig. S12, Supporting Information) [22,31]. Moreover, the conduction band levels (E CB) were estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S13, Supporting Information), with values of −0.23 and −0.28 V vs. RHE for FNS and ZIS, respectively. The E CB of both FNS and ZIS are negative enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Accordingly, by summing the bandgaps, the valence band levels (E VB) of FNS and ZIS were determined to be 1.07 and 2.01 V (vs. RHE), respectively [54,55]. Based on these results, the E CB and E VB levels indicate that the FNS@ZIS composites have potential as visible light active catalysts to efficiently drive photoredox reactions."
10,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of FNS@ZIS was evaluated in the presence of BA in water under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). Compared with pure ZIS and FNS, the photocatalytic activity of FNS@ZIS was significantly enhanced after combining FNS and ZIS into hierarchical core/shell structures. Detailed parallel experiments demonstrated that FNS@ZIS-2 possesses the highest photocatalytic activity among the FNS@ZIS composites with different loadings of FNS. The H2 evolution rate of FNS@ZIS-2 was as high as 10465 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is ca. 22 and 31 times higher than those of isolated FNS and ZIS, respectively (Fig. 4 a and Fig. S14 in Supporting Information). This performance was significantly enhanced compared to that of FNS@ZIS-1 (3870 μmol·g−1·h−1) and FNS@ZIS-3 (4679 μmol·g−1·h−1), indicating the critical role of the ratio of the bimetallic FNS. FNS@ZIS-2 presents excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (10465 μmol·g−1·h−1), coupled with various alcohol oxidation reactions in water to produce organic chemicals (Table S1, Supporting Information) [24,26,28,30,56,57], and the performance even exceeds that of most ZIS-based photocatalytic systems containing large amounts of sacrificial agents (Table S2, Supporting Information) [58–60]. The performance of FNS@ZIS-2 was also evaluated under full-spectrum Xe light to simulate solar light, and in the dark (Fig. 4b). Obviously, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of FNS@ZIS-2 (19750 μmol·g−1·h−1) was significantly enhanced under full spectrum Xe light compared with that under visible-light. No H2 was detected for the reaction in the dark. These results indicate the great potential of the developed FNS@ZIS hierarchical nanostructures for photocatalytic H2 evolution in practical applications."
11,Photocatalytic BA oxidation,"3.3 Photocatalytic BA oxidation Coupled with H2 evolution, BA can be simultaneously oxidized by the photogenerated holes. The liquid products were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 1HNMR (Figs. S15 and S16, Supporting Information). The photocatalytic experiment was performed in the presence of 20 µL BA under Xe light irradiation with a 420 nm filter. The resulting rate of BA conversion to BAD could reach 54.2% in 18 h with high selectivity (>99.9%). To better understand the high selectivity of the catalyst towards the conversion of BA to BAD, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of BA and BAD were acquired with variation of the concentration (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mM). As shown in Fig. 5(a and b), the redox potentials of BA/BAD and BAD/benzoic acid are independent of the concentration, and the onset oxidation potentials were calculated to be 1.92 and 2.52 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that BA can only be oxidized to BAD by photoinduced holes with E VB = 2.01 V (vs. RHE) in ZIS, which is much lower than the oxidation potential for conversion of BAD to benzoic acid. Moreover, photocatalytic BA oxidation was carried out under argon atmosphere to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen [61,62]. Therefore, the photogenerated holes may in fact be the active species for oxidizing BA in this photocatalytic system. On the other hand, the CB potential levels of FNS and ZIS (−0.23 vs. RHE and −0.28 V vs. RHE) are more negative than the potential for proton reduction. Thus, the protons can be effectively reduced by the photogenerated electrons to produce H2 in this photocatalytic system. To explore the source of H2, an isotopic labeling experiment was further performed in D2O. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the peak at m/z = 4 corresponding to D2 was clearly detected when D2O was used instead of H2O, where only H2 (m/z = 2) was observed when H2O was used as the proton source. These results reveal that the H2 is actually derived from water splitting, rather than other BA-related reactions."
12,Charge transfer and mechanistic studies,"3.4 Charge transfer and mechanistic studies Based on the above results, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed. As shown in Fig. 5(d), when FNS@ZIS was irradiated with visible light, FNS and ZIS were both excited simultaneously to generate electrons and holes. The photogenerated electrons are transferred from the CB of ZIS to the CB of FNS via the interface of the heterojunction, resulting in a high concentration of photogenerated electrons on the CB of FNS; these electrons efficiently reduce the protons to release H2 from water, while simultaneously producing OH−. The photogenerated holes on the surface of ZIS can also oxidize BA to BAD; H+ was released and recombined with OH− to form water molecules. This mechanism was evidenced by the isotopic labeling experiment in D2O, where a small amount of HD with m/z = 3 was detected (Fig. 5c). Thus, the introduction of the BA oxidation reaction into this photocatalytic system can maximize the utilization of photogenerated charge carriers by consuming the holes. Moreover, the CV data reveal that the potential for oxidation of BA to BAD was more positive than the VB level of FNS, further confirming that the oxidation reaction occurs on the VB of ZIS (Fig. 5a and d). To further explore the charge separation and transfer behavior, a series of photo/electrochemical characterizations were performed on the FNS@ZIS composites and control samples. First, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of FNS@ZIS-2 was obviously reduced compared with that of isolated ZIS (Fig. 6 a), indicating that charge recombination was greatly suppressed due to improved charge separation induced by FNS in the FNS@ZIS heterostructures. The charge carrier decay dynamics of FNS@ZIS and ZIS were further probed by time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Fig. 6b). The decay kinetics of FNS@ZIS-2 indicated a much shorter average PL lifetime (0.9 ns) than those of ZIS (1.9 ns), FNS@ZIS-1 (1.5 ns), and FNS@ZIS-3 (1.2 ns), highlighting the enhanced photoinduced electron–hole separation [17,19]. Thus, the electron–hole separation is more efficient for FNS@ZIS-2 than for ZIS, FNS@ZIS-1, and FNS@ZIS-3. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response measurements were further performed for FNS@ZIS-2, pure ZIS, and FNS. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the EIS profile of FNS@ZIS-2 showed a smaller high-frequency EIS semicircle than that of isolated ZIS and FNS, demonstrating improved charge transfer in the heterostructure. The effect of interfacial charge transfer and separation in FNS@ZIS was further evidenced by the transient photocurrent response. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the photocurrent of FNS@ZIS-2 was much higher than that of isolated FNS and ZIS, demonstrating that the close contact of FNS and ZIS in the heterostructure can efficiently promote charge separation and transfer. Importantly, the order of the photocurrent densities of these hierarchical structures followed the order: FNS@ZIS-2 > FNS@ZIS-3 > FNS@ZIS-1. This trend is in good agreement with the photocatalytic activity results, indicating that the FNS content in FNS@ZIS plays an important role in the synergetic effect of light harvesting and charge separation and transfer. Together, the results verify the improved separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers in the FNS@ZIS-2 hierarchical structures, which enhances both the photocatalytic H2 evolution and BA oxidation. To prove the key role of bimetallic FeNi in the FNS@ZIS system, FeFe-PBA and CuFe-PBA without Ni were synthesized to prepare monometallic FeS and bimetallic CuFeS2 nanopsheres as control samples. ZIS nanosheets were also grown in situ on the nanopsheres to construct FeS@ZIS and CuFeS2@ZIS hierarchical structures with similar loading amounts of the core. Successful syntheses of all the control samples were confirmed by PXRD and SEM (Figs. S17 and S18, Supporting Information). FeS@ZIS and CuFeS2@ZIS were photocatalytically active for H2 evolution in the presence of BA under conditions similar to those of FNS@ZIS. As shown in Fig. S19, the H2-evolution rate of FeS@ZIS (1740 μmol·g−1·h−1) and CuFeS2@ZIS (792 μmol·g−1·h−1) was much lower (ca. 6 and 13 times, respectively) than that of FNS@ZIS-2. This result strongly indicates the significant contribution of the synergistic effect of the metals in bimetallic Ni-Fe to the efficient H2 evolution in the FNS@ZIS hierarchical structures. Although more detailed studies are still needed to better understand the mechanisms, the proposed hierarchical structure design strategy with a bimetallic core demonstrates the importance of the synergistic contribution in bifunctional photocatalysts towards efficient co-production of solar fuels and/or other valuable chemicals."
13,Stability,"3.5 Stability The cycle stability of the FNS@ZIS-2 heterostructure was evaluated by repetitive photocatalytic experiments with the recycled catalyst at 4 h intervals. The photocatalytic activity of FNS@ZIS-2 did not decrease obviously during four recycling experiments (Fig. 7 a). The structural robustness of FNS@ZIS-2 was also confirmed by PXRD and SEM characterizations. The PXRD patterns of FNS@ZIS-2 before and after the photocatalytic experiments were almost identical, and there was no obvious morphological change after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S20). It can be concluded that the FNS@ZIS-2 photocatalyst is stable during the photocatalytic process. In further continuous photocatalytic tests, the total hydrogen evolution reached 77587 μmol g−1 within 18 h, but the H2 evolution rate clearly decreased with time (Fig. 7b). This decrease is due to the consumption of BA rather than deactivation of the catalyst. To verify this speculation, 20 μL of BA was re-added to the closed reactor after 18 h of reaction. The H2 evolution rate increased markedly (Fig. 7b), confirming the stability of the catalyst and the critical role of BA oxidation for efficient enhancement of the photocatalytic performance."
14,Conclusions,"To develop efficient bifunctional photocatalysts for simultaneous H2 evolution and organic chemical production, a series of FNS@ZIS hierarchical core–shell structures was prepared by growing ZIS nanosheets on PBA-derived bimetallic FNS porous nanospheres. This unique hierarchical architecture of nanospheres/nanosheets offers a high specific area with abundant active sites and excellent photostability, facilitates interfacial charge transfer, and affords bimetallic FeNi synergy. The optimized FNS@ZIS-2 sample affords a H2 evolution rate of 10465 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is 22 and 31 times higher than that of FNS and ZIS, respectively, along with high selectivity for the oxidation of BA to BAD (>99.9%). This performance is even better than the latest photocatalysts with a large amount of sacrificial agents due to efficient charge separation and the bimetallic synergetic effect. Further, mechanistic studies prove the key role of bimetallic FeNi synergy in this system compared to the FeS and bimetallic CuFeS2 nanopsheres, as control samples. This hierarchical structure design strategy using a bimetallic core not only provides an effective and simple method for preparing highly active and stable photocatalysts from PMCPs, but also offers important guidance for the synergistic utilization of photogenerated carriers to achieve simultaneous co-production of solar fuels and/or other valuable chemicals."
