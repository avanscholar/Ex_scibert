0,Introduction,"Because of its abundant source, its low cost, and its renewable and biodegradable nature, starch is widely used in food processing and industrial production (Zhang et al., 2017). However, due to their semi-crystalline structure, native starch granules require energy to gelatinize and dissolve in water (Zhu, Liu, & Gao, 2017). Gelatinization is a very important property of starch. Traditionally, starch is gelatinized by heating in water. In recent years, there have been many reports of using organic solvents and ionic liquids to gelatinize or dissolve starch in order to expand its application range. Mukerjea, Mukerjea, and Robyt (2006) studied the gelatinization behavior of different starch granules in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (85%–95%), and found that potato starch gelatinized in 90% DMSO aqueous solution at 15 °C for 8 h. Moorthy, 1982 reported that glycerol, ethanediol, DMSO, and formalin could be used to solubilize cassava starch, and gelatinization temperature in DMSO (70–85 °C) and formalin (70–85 °C) were lower than in glycerol (130–145 °C) and ethanediol (110–125 °C). Sciarini et al. (2015) reported that when the ionic liquid concentration increased to 50% for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate or 60% for cholinium acetate, the enthalpy decreased and gelatinization temperature of corn starch decreased from around 68 °C to 56 °C or 62 °C, respectively. However, due to disadvantages such as toxicity or high price (Ren, Xie, Luan, Wang, & Wang, 2020), the application of organic solvents or ionic liquids in the food industry is limited. Therefore, in order to expand the application of starch in food industry, many studies have reported the gelatinization behavior of starch in alcohol-assisted alkaline, because ethanol can inhibit the swelling of starch granules and maintain the integrity of starch granules. Kaveh, Azadmard-Damirchi, Yousefi, and Hosseini (2020) studied the effect of different alcohol-alkali treatments on the physical properties of cassava starch and found that the more ethanol solution (40%) added, the stronger the inhibitory effect on granules swelling. In addition, ethanol is used to prepare modified carboxymethyl starch with high substitution. Zhang et al. (2017) reported that a kind of modified starch with a high substitution (0.95%) and reaction efficiency (52.8%) was obtained by using ethanol heating to prepare amorphous starch granules and then modifying them with sodium monochloroacetate. Dries, Gomand, Goderis, and Delcour (2014) have reported the paste characteristics of waxy corn starch in 48%–68% concentrations of ethanol solution. They found that compared with starch gelatinization in water, gelatinization in 48% ethanol occurred at a higher temperature (69.9 °C to 82.3 °C). As the alcohol concentration increased from 48% to 68%, the gelatinization temperature increased from 82.3 °C to 117.1 °C. Furthermore, starch gelatinized in 48%–68% ethanol exhibited a V-type of crystal melting. With the increase of the ethanol concentration, the gelatinization temperature of the V-type crystal increased from 117.6 °C to 157.4 °C. However, the use of low-concentration alcohol (0–20%) to investigate the gelatinization properties of starch is relatively rare. Since pea starch has a wide range of sources, high amylose content and good gel properties (Leite, de Jesus, Schmiele, Tribst, & Cristianini, 2017; Wang & Copeland, 2015), we selected pea starch as a model starch to study the pasting, gelatinization, and rheological properties of pea starch in low-concentration alcohol solution. We used a rapid visco analyzer (RVA) to study the viscosity of pea starch in alcohol solution, combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a rheometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to characterize the structure, properties, and thermodynamics of starch gels. Our research could increase the knowledge of starch gelatinization, pasting, and gelation properties in alcohol solution, and expand the application range of starch."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pea starch (40% amylose content) was purchased from Qingdao Haider Starch Co., Ltd. (Qingdao, China). All other reagents were of analytical grade, and deionized water was used throughout."
3,Method,"2.2 Method 2.2.1 Preparation of starch paste and gel in alcohol solution Pasting starch was made in a rapid visco analyzer (RVA, Model 4D, Newport Scientific, Australia) according to the procedure of (Sun, Dai, Nan, & Xiong, 2014), with some modifications. According to the results of preliminary experiments, we chose the pea starch concentrations as 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w), and the alcohol solutions concentrations as 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (v/v). The pea starch was added to different concentrations of alcohol solution in the RVA aluminum canister and sealed with preservative film. The sample was held at 50 °C for 1 min, heated at a rate of 12.0 °C/min to 95 °C, and then held at 95 °C for 2.5 min. Afterwards, it was cooled to 50 °C in 2.5 min, and then held at 50 °C for 2 min. Constant paddle rotating speed (160 rpm) was maintained throughout entire analysis, except for rapid stirring at 960 rpm for the first 10 s to disperse starch sample. During the pasting process of the starch in alcohol solution, the system was sealed to prevent solvent evaporation. After RVA testing, the starch paste samples were sealed in parafilm and cooled to room temperature. The sealed samples were then stored at 4 °C for 12 h to form gels. The obtained gels were subjected to texture analysis and rheology measurements. In addition, the obtained gel was freeze dried, ground into powder, and subjected to XRD and FTIR analyses."
4,Mechanical properties of starch gels,"2.3 Mechanical properties of starch gels The mechanical properties of starch gels were examined using texture profile analysis (TPA). A texture analyzer (TAXTplus, Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, U.K.) fitted with a P 0.5 probe was used. We removed the gel from the RVA aluminum canister. Then we uniformly cut the gel samples into 1.5 cm height for measurement. The test speed was 0.5 mm/s, and the gels were compressed twice to a strain of 40%. The textural parameters of hardness (g) and springiness were recorded (Ge, Li, et al., 2018). 2.3.1 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The gelatinization properties of starch in a diluted alcohol solution were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC; Mettler Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland), as described by Lu et al. (2019). Starch samples with 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w) concentration were prepared by mixing approximately 4 mg of pea starch with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (v/v) alcohol solutions in aluminum pans, respectively. Then the container was hermetically sealed and stood overnight at room temperature to achieve equilibration. During the testing process, the pans were heated from 25 to 130 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were quenched to 4 °C, then immediately rescanned in the same manner. STARe software (Mettler Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) was used to calculate the onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), conclusion temperature (Tc), and enthalpy change (ΔH). In addition, the retrogradation properties of the gels after 7 days of storage were measured in the same way."
5,Rheological properties of starch gels,"2.4 Rheological properties of starch gels A rheometer (MCR102, Anton Paar, Austria) with parallel plates (50 mm diameter, 0.10 mm gap) was used to carry out dynamic rheological measurement. The starch paste samples after RVA testing were put into petri dishes with thickness of approximately 2 mm and sealed with preservative film. And then they were stored at 4 °C for 12 h to form gels. The obtained gels were cut into pieces with diameter of 50 mm for measurement. In order to determine the storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), and loss angle tangent (tan δ = G'/G″), frequency sweeps were performed at 10–100 rad/s and 1% strain in the linear viscoelastic region. 2.4.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns Before analysis, the powders were equilibrated to 20% moisture content in a saturated relative humidity chamber at ambient temperature for 24 h. The diffraction patterns of the powders were recorded in an angular (2θ) range from 4° to 40° by an X-ray diffractometer (AXS D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), and the relative crystallinity was calculated from the proportion of the crystalline area to the whole area (Ge, Li, et al., 2018). 2.4.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) A scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi Instruments Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was applied to observe the morphologies of starch gels. The starch gels were frozen with liquid nitrogen followed by freeze drying. Then the surfaces and fractured sections were gold sputtered for observations. 2.4.3 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded using an FTIR spectrophotometer (NEXUS-870, Thermo Nicolet Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1, as described by (Yang et al., 2017). OMNIC 8.0 software was used to measure the absorbance of 1047 cm−1 divided by the absorbance of 1022 cm−1 (Yu, Wang, Chen, Li, & Wang, 2018)."
6,Statistical analysis,2.5 Statistical analysis All data were recorded as average values and standard deviations (n = 3). SPSS 16.0 software was used to analyze the data differences via Duncan's multiple range tests. Differences were considered at a significance level of 95% (p < 0.05).
7,Results and discussion,
8,Pasting properties,"3.1 Pasting properties RVA is widely used to record the viscosity of starch during heating and cooling (Kong, Zhu, Zhang, & Zhu, 2020; Xie, Zhang, Xia, & Ai, 2020). The pasting parameters of 15% of pea starch in different concentrations of alcohol solution are shown in Table 1 . Under the same starch concentration, different concentrations of alcohol solution affected the pasting properties of pea starch. We found that the pasting temperature of starch changed slightly when gelatinizing in different solvents. However, with increasing alcohol concentration, the peak viscosity, trough viscosity, and final viscosity of pea starch decreased significantly. In addition, in comparison to gelatinization in water, the breakdown value of gelatinized starch in alcohol solution was significantly higher. The decrease in viscosity was due to the dehydration of the alcohol solution, inhibiting the swelling of the starch particles and amylose leaching, increasing internal bonding forces between the starch chains within the particles (Zhang, Cai, Shan, Zhang, & Dong, 2014). Zhang, Dhital, Haque, and Gidley (2012) also reported that alcohol inhibited swelling of starch granules by reducing effective water concentration or complexation with dissociated starch chains. The setback value indicates the short-term retrogradation of starch (Sun, Fan, & Xiong, 2014). When the concentration of the alcohol solution was 10%, the setback and breakdown values were the largest, indicating that pea starch was easier to retrograde than other alcohol concentrations. Therefore, we fixed the concentration of alcohol solution at 10%, and we studied the effects of different starch concentrations (10%, 15%, and 20%) on the starch gelatinization; the results are shown in Table 2 . The breakdown measures the sensitivity of the gelatinized starch to disintegration due to the loss of starch granule integrity and subsequent disruption, leading to a reduction in paste viscosity (Pongsawatmanit, Temsiripong, & Suwonsichon, 2007). We found that the breakdown values of the samples in the 10% alcohol solution were higher than those in water, which indicates that with increased alcohol concentration, the starch particles were more likely to break during the swelling process, and the stability of the gelatinized starch decreased. Whether in water or alcohol solution, the setback value of the samples was the largest when the starch concentration was 15%, indicating that it was easier to form a strong gel at this concentration than at other starch concentrations. Therefore, according to the results in Tables 1 and 2, the starch concentration of 15% and the alcohol concentration of 10% were the best conditions for gel formation."
9,Texture profile analysis,"3.2 Texture profile analysis The textural properties of 15% starch gel formed in different concentrations of alcohol solution and different concentrations of starch gels formed in 10% alcohol solution are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively. Table 3 shows that the hardness of the gel formed in alcohol was greater than that in water. When the concentration of starch was fixed at 15%, the hardness of the sample of the 15% alcohol solution was the greatest, followed by a 10% alcohol solution. This might be due to the fact that the higher the alcohol concentration, the stronger the dehydration effect and the greater the hardness of the starch after regeneration. However, when the alcohol concentration was 20%, the inhibition effect on starch gelatinization might be stronger than the promotion effect on the formation of gel hydrogen bonds; therefore, the strength of the formed gel was weaker than that of the other alcohol concentrations. In addition, there were few differences in the springiness of the gel formed by different concentrations of alcohol solution. From Table 4, it could be seen that there was almost no difference in the hardness and springiness of the starch gel formed by gelatinization of 10% starch in water or in 10% alcohol solution. However, the hardness of gels formed by gelatinization of 15% and 20% starch in water or 10% alcohol solution were significantly different. Compared to 15% starch hydrogel, the hardness of the gel formed in 10% alcohol increased approximately 2-fold (1696.4 g versus 928.1 g). When 20% starch was used, the hardness of the gel formed in 10% alcohol increased approximately 3-fold (2243.8 g versus 706.6 g) compared to the control hydrogel. This was because the increased starch concentration led to an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds after regeneration, and the dehydration of the alcohol increased the density of the gel hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing the hardness of the gel."
10,Thermal properties,"3.3 Thermal properties The DSC thermograms for pea starch at different concentrations of alcohol solution are shown in Table 5 . The To, Tp, and Tc values of pea starch in the alcohol solution reduced slightly. The To decreased from 59.94 to 58.51 °C, with only a slight decrease. A lower gelatinization temperature indicated that the starch formed a bond that required less heat to break, freely moving amylose molecules and the amylopectin chains present in the crystalline region ((Sun, Nan, Dai, Ji, & Xiong, 2014)). Tp is an index used to measure the stability of crystallization; the higher the Tp value, the more orderly and stable the structure (Liu, Xie, & Shi, 2016). In comparison with gelatinization in water, gelatinization in alcohol resulted in a lower Tp of pea starch. These results indicate that low concentrations of alcohol are good for starch gelatinization. The gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH) reflects the loss of molecular (double helix) order (Sun et al., 2017). As alcohol concentration increased, the ΔH values of starch increased slightly. The increase of ΔH revealed the stabilization of crystalline structure by alcohol. Yang et al. (2016) also reported that ethanol may have a void filling effect to stabilize the crystalline structure of starch and prevent it from swelling under high pressure. The DSC thermograms of samples the in Table 5 after 7 days of retrogradation are shown in Table 6 . During storage, the side chain of amylopectin forms a double helix structure through hydrogen bonds, which leads to starch retrogradation (Yu et al., 2020). The energy required to gelatinize depends on the degree of hydrogen bonding (Farrag et al., 2018). The ΔH of the retrograded samples in the alcohol solution increased and the pasting temperature decreased compared with that of a control sample in water, which indicates that alcohol could promote starch regeneration. This is because alcohol can bind water and increase the concentration of starch in water. Furthermore, the thermal properties of starch at different concentrations in the same 10% alcohol solution differed little (Table 7 ). But compared to the sample of 20% starch, the enthalpies of the samples with starch concentrations of 10% and 15% were significantly higher in alcohol than in water after 7 days of regeneration (Table 8 ). This suggests that alcohol had a stronger effect on the of low-concentration starch (10% and 15%) than on 20% starch."
11,Rheological properties,"3.4 Rheological properties Starch gel is formed due to the rearrangement of starch molecules in the cooling process of gelatinized starch, and the rheological properties of polymer solutions are usually characterized by a dynamic modulus (storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″) (Li, Tan, Xu, Lu, & Wang, 2017; Lu, Luo, & Xiao, 2012). The tan δ value is an important rheological parameter reflecting the relatively viscous or elastic behavior of gel (Li, Sun, Han, Chen, & Tang, 2018; Yu et al., 2018). Tan δ value is the ratio of G″ to G′; when the tanδ value is less than 1, the material shows good elastic properties, and when the tanδ value is greater than 1, the material shows good viscosity (Yu et al., 2018). The G′, G″, and tan δ values of 15% starch gel formed in different concentrations of alcohol solution are displayed in Fig. 1 . The G′ was higher than the G″ at the entire experimental angular frequency, indicating that they were all gels with solid-like behavior, as reported previously (Liu, McClements, Li, Xiong, & Sun, 2019). Furthermore, with the increase in angular frequency, the G′ of the gel remains almost unchanged, which indicates that the gels were strong. This is related to the high content of amylose in pea starch and its easy retrogradation. In addition, alcohol can be combined with water, increasing the concentration of starch molecules in water and therefore promoting the interaction between starch hydroxyl groups, facilitating the formation of hydrogen bonds. Thus, the gels formed in alcohol were stronger than the gel formed in water. In addition, all the gelatinized pea starches in 5–20% alcohol solutions had tan δ values lower than 0.1, which indicates that the gels’ network structures were strong (Ribotta, Colombo, & Rosell, 2012). Combined with the RVA results, we selected a 10% alcohol concentration to study the effects of different starch concentrations on rheological properties, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . As can be seen from Fig. 2B, when the starch concentrations were 10% and 20%, the tan δ values of the gel formed in water were less than the tan δ values of the gel formed in 10% alcohol solution, which indicates that compared with the gel formed in water, 10% alcohol solution did not enhance the gel network. But for 15% starch, the tan δ value of the gel formed in 10% alcohol was less than that in water. This shows that alcohol enhanced the gel network of 15% starch, and the strength of the gel was second only to that of 20% starch in water. When the concentration of pea starch was 20%, it was more difficult to gelatinize in water, so we can obtain starch gel with a strong network structure by gelatinizing 15% starch in a 10% alcohol solution."
12,XRD pattern,"3.5 XRD pattern Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of 15% starch gels formed in different concentrations of alcohol solution and different starch concentration gels formed in a 10% alcohol solution. Obviously, these samples had a single peak at 17–18° and a single peak at 22–24°, with a typical B-type structure (Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). Fig. 3A shows that the relative crystallinity values of the gels formed in alcohol were all larger than that in water because the action of the alcohol hydroxyl groups and the dehydration of alcohol promoted the formation of hydrogen bonds. In addition, Fig. 4 shows that when the alcohol concentration was 15%, the relative crystallinity of starch was the greatest, which indicates that it was beneficial to the retrogradation of starch under this condition and formed a better gel, followed by a 10% concentration alcohol. The higher the alcohol concentration, the stronger the promotion of crystallization, but when the alcohol concentration is too high, it may lead to an incomplete gelatinization of the starch granules. Therefore, the relative crystallinity of starch gelatinized in 20% alcohol was less than that of starch gelatinized in 15% alcohol. Moreover, when starch was gelatinized in alcohol at different concentrations, the relative crystallinity of the gel obtained from the 15% starch was the largest. This result is consistent with the DSC results. Amylose can form a complex with polar organic matter (Kong, Perez-Santos, & Ziegler, 2019), but the absence of a V-type peak might be due to the fact that the V-type complex was unstable. The alcohol concentrations used were less than 20%, so there was still a large amount of water in the system, and the hydration and swelled crystals destroyed the single helix structure of the starch. Shi, Liang, Yan, Pan, and Liu (2018) reported that the V-type diffraction peaks of starch complexes disappeared when starch samples were treated with 10% and 20% alcohol solutions."
13,Microstructure of starch gels,"3.6 Microstructure of starch gels The morphologies of starch gels formed in different concentrations of alcohol solutions are shown in Fig. 4. Notably, the 3-dimensional network of the starch gels formed in an alcohol solution (Fig. 4c, e and h) appreciably differed from the surface microstructures of the starch gel formed in water (Fig. 4a). With increasing alcohol concentration, the surface roughness of the gel increased. Similarly, Gonzalez et al. (2018) observed that the surface exposed by water-extracted rice bean starch was mainly smooth, while the surface of ethanol-extracted rice bean starch was rough and had some dents. The gels formed in alcohol solutions exhibited more pores and showed a honeycomb feature, which indicates that alcohol molecules can interact with water and then modulate the structure of gels. Furthermore, the surface structure became looser with increasing alcohol concentration. The pore size of the gel's cross-sections became uneven as the alcohol concentration increased (Fig. 4b, d, f, g, and I), but the structure appears to be denser than that of the starch gel formed in water. In addition, the structure of the gels was more uniform and compact with increasing starch concentration (Fig. 5 ) because the increased starch concentration promoted the formation of hydrogen bonds. However, the hardness of the gel formed with a 20% starch concentration was too great, and the elasticity was poor. The results show that the surface and internal structures of the gel formed under 15% starch and 10% alcohol were best, and the gel had higher strength."
14,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,"3.7 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy In contrast to the long-range order measured by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy is a quantitative determination of the short-range ordered structure of starch. The absorption band at 1047 cm−1 is related to the amount of ordered or crystalline starch, whereas the absorption band at 1022 cm−1 is associated with the amorphous starch; their ratios indicate the ratio of the ordered (crystalline) and amorphous regions of starch (Li, Ward, & Gao, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). In addition, the broad peak at 3000–3500 cm−1 is linked to the presence of hydroxyl groups, reflecting the presence of hydrating structures (Lopez et al., 2019). The FTIR spectra of a 15% starch gel formed in different concentrations of alcohol solution and different starch concentrations gels formed in a 10% alcohol solution are shown in Fig. 6 A and B, respectively. The corresponding ratios of 1047:1022 are shown in Table 9 and Table 10 , respectively. The samples formed in alcohol solution did not have a new peak, indicating that no new chemical bonds were formed. The ratios of starch gels formed in alcohol were generally larger than that of the starch hydrogel, indicating that the short-range structure of starch gels formed in alcohol was more regular (Wei et al., 2020, p. 1900275). As shown in Table 9, when the starch concentration was 15% and the alcohol concentration was 10%, the ratio of 1047:1022 was the greatest. The results indicate that the relative crystallinity was the highest under this condition, which was beneficial to the retrogradation of starch compared to that in gel formed in water. As already reported (Lopez et al., 2019), the ratio of 1047: 1022 in sweet potato starch pretreated with alcohol was higher than that obtained with pre-alkali treatment. In addition, starch concentration was also an important factor affecting the ratio of 1047:1022. We could see from Table 10 that the greater the starch concentration, the greater the ratio of 1047:1022. When the starch concentration was 15%, the ratio was the greatest among the samples of starch gelatinized in 10% alcohol solution. These results suggest that starch gelatinization in low-concentration alcohol was an effective method for promoting starch regeneration to form orderly crystalline structure and further formed a strong gel."
15,Conclusion,"In summary, we investigated the pasting, gelatinization, and rheological characteristics of different concentrations of pea starch in low concentrations (≤20%) of alcohol. The SEM results show that gels treated with alcohol had much denser microstructures than those of the water-treated specimens. The gelatinization properties revealed that when the starch concentration was fixed at 15%, the viscosity of the gelatinized starch decreased significantly with increasing alcohol concentrations. When the alcohol concentration was 10% and the starch concentration was 15%, the setback value was the largest—5296.7 cP—compared with other samples. Furthermore, the TPA results showed that, compared with the hydrogel formed in water, the hardness of the gel formed by 15% starch in 10% alcohol was significantly greater (1696.4 g versus 928.1 g). However, the XRD results suggest that when the alcohol concentration is increased to 20%, the inhibitory effect of alcohol on starch gelatinization might lead to the incomplete gelatinization of starch. Moreover, the rheological properties indicate that the gel strength formed by 15% starch in a 10% alcohol solution was second only to the gel formed by 20% starch in water. Our study complements existing knowledge of the pasting characteristics of starch in low alcohol concentrations. In the future, the behaviors and applications of starch alcohol gels gelatinized in dilute alcohol solutions will be further investigated."
