0,Introduction,"The global interests in hydrogen as a clean energy carrier remain due to its unique properties and the high efficiencies of hydrogen fuel cells in converting hydrogen to electricity. The development of advanced technologies for producing hydrogen from renewable energy resources that minimize environmental impacts is now given high priority. Microbial electrohydrogenesis provides a completely new approach for hydrogen generation from biomass, such as biowaste and wastewater, and accomplishing waste treatment at the same time (Cheng and Logan, 2007; Ditzig et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2005; Logan, 2007; Rozendal et al., 2006, 2007). Its overall process is similar in principle to the electrolysis of water, except that microbes are used at the anode to decompose organic matter into CO2, electrons, and protons. Low energy consumption is one of multifold advantages of this system over water electrolysis. As low as 0.2V is needed to produce hydrogen in microbial electrohydrogenesis, while a theoretically minimum applied voltage of 1.23V is required for water electrolysis (Kinoshita, 1992; Rozendal et al., 2007). Other benefits include no expensive catalysts needed on the anode and the potential achievement of waste reduction simultaneously. This process also has multiple advantages over the fermentative hydrogen production, such as higher hydrogen recovery and more diverse substrate. More than 90% of hydrogen can be harvested by microbial electrohydrogenesis versus 33% by fermentation (Chaudhuri and Lovely, 2003; Cheng and Logan, 2007; Liu and Fang, 2002). Various biodegradable organic materials, such as carbohydrates, protein, amino acids, alcohols, and fatty acids can potentially be utilized for hydrogen production by microbial electrohydrogenesis compared to mainly carbohydrates by fermentation (Heilmann and Logan, 2006; Logan, 2007; Li and Fang, 2007). While microbial electrolytic hydrogen production has tremendous potential, the development of this technique is still in its infancy. In spite of the fact that information about the anode materials and microorganisms used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) might be applicable to this system due to their similar anodic process, efficient and scaleable designs are critical for the successful applications of the microbial electrolysis. Membranes were employed in all the studies reported up to date (Cheng and Logan, 2007; Ditzig et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2005; Logan, 2007; Rozendal et al., 2006, 2007) to separate anode and cathode. However, membranes, such as Nafion membranes are expensive, and can increase the internal resistance especially at neural pH. Rozendal et al., (2007) reported considerable potential losses associated with cation exchange membrane (CEM, 0.38V) and anion exchange membrane (AEM, 0.26V), which increased the optimal value of the applied voltage and significantly decreased the energy recovery. The removal of membrane not only can simplify the construction, operation and maintenance of MECs, but also can decrease the internal resistance, thus increase the hydrogen production rate. In this study, single-chamber membrane-free microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) were designed and used to investigate hydrogen production by one mixed culture and one pure culture: Shewanella oneidensis MR-1."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Construction of single-chamber membrane-free MECs,"2.1 Construction of single-chamber membrane-free MECs Two kinds of single-chamber membrane-free MECs were constructed to investigate the hydrogen production efficiency of the systems (Fig. 1 ). The first system was made from wide mouth glass bottles (500mL) and used to investigate hydrogen production by a mixed culture (Fig. 1a). The anode (3.5×4cm2) and cathode (4×5cm2) were held together by plastic screws with electrodes spaced 2cm apart. The second system was made from clear borosilicate glass serum vials (100mL) and used to investigate hydrogen production by S. oneidensis (Fig. 1b). Serum vials were chosen for the pure culture test mainly because they are easily sealed and autoclaved, and maintaining anaerobic condition after autoclave. The anode and cathode (both in 3×3cm) in this system were separated by a layer of J-Cloth (4×4cm, First Brands Corporation, USA) to avoid short circuit. For both systems, the anodes were made of type A carbon cloth (without wet-proofing; E-Tek, USA) and the cathodes were type B carbon cloth (30% wet-proofing; E-Tek, USA) containing 0.5mg/cm2 Pt catalyst. The cathode was prepared as follows: (i) a commercial Pt catalyst (20 wt% Pt/C, E-TEK) was mixed with Nafion (5%, Sigma–Aldrich) for 10h in a ratio of 7μL Nafion per mg of Pt/C catalyst to form a paste; (ii) the paste was then applied on both sides of cathode; (iii) the cathode was dried at room temperature for 24h. Titanium wire was used to connect the electrodes with the circuit for both systems."
3,Operation of MECs with mixed culture,"2.2 Operation of MECs with mixed culture The bacteria used in the MECs were enriched in conventional single-chamber MFCs using local domestic wastewater as the inoculum (Liu and Logan, 2004). When the voltage output of the MFCs reached over 0.5V at 1000Ω external resistor, the anodes were removed and placed in MECs containing a pH 7 medium solution (300mL). The medium solution contained following (per liter): NaH2PO4, 10.2g; Na2HPO4, 33.8g; NH4Cl, 0.31g; KCl, 0.13g; and mineral (12.5mL) and vitamin (12.5mL) solutions as reported (Bond and Lovley, 2003). Sodium acetate (20mM) was used as carbon source for all experiments with mixed cultures. After purging the MECs with N2 gas for 10min, a voltage ranging from 0.3 to 0.6V was applied to the MECs by connecting the positive pole of a programmable power supply (3645A, Array Elec. Co. Ltd.) to the anodes, and the negative to the cathodes. A high-precision resistor (1.1Ω) was incorporated in the electrical circuit, and the voltage (V) over the resistor was recorded using a multimeter with a data acquisition system (2700, Keithly, USA) to calculate current density. Experiments were conducted in batch mode and solutions in MECs were replaced when the generated current decreased to less than 50μA or methane concentration in the headspace was higher than 5%. A biotic control with microorganisms but without applied voltages was conducted to investigate the possibility of hydrogen generation via mesophilic syntrophic acetate oxidation (Schnürer et al., 1999). Since methane was detected during the hydrogen production process, another control experiment was conducted to investigate the possibility of methane generation from H2 and CO2 through the Sabatier process catalyzed by metal catalysts on the surface of cathodes. The MEC without microorganisms was first purged with hydrogen for 10min, injected with CO2 to reach 25% in the headspace, and then operated at an applied voltage of 0.6V. In addition, three methods were employed to suppress the growth of methanogens, including: (i) lowering the environment pH by using a medium solution (pH 5.8) containing phosphate buffer: NaH2PO4, 25.4g/L; Na2HPO4, 4.25g/L; (ii) exposing the cathode to air for 15min when the methane content in the headspace was higher than 5%; (iii) boiling the anodes from MFCs at 100°C for 15min before placing them in MECs."
4,Operation of MECs with S. oneidensis,"2.3 Operation of MECs with S. oneidensis Since high current density was obtained in an MFC with S. oneidensis cultured under aerobic condition (Ringerisen et al., 2006), S. oneidensis MR-1 (ATCC) was cultured aerobically in this study using a soy broth medium solution (30g/L) as suggested by ATCC. The serum vial MECs were filled with a medium solution (40mL) containing following (per liter): soy broth, 30g (Becton, Dickinso and Company); lactic acid, 1g; NaH2PO4, 10.2g; Na2HPO4, 33.8g. The solution pH was adjusted to 7 using NaOH. The MECs were sealed with rubber serum stoppers and crimp style aluminum seals (Miller Analytical), purged with N2 gas to remove oxygen and autoclaved. The MECs were then inoculated with 40mL cell solution and operated at an applied voltage of 0.6V. Experiments were conducted in triplicate with one control experiment without inoculums. The experiments were operated in a semi-continuous mode; half solutions (40mL) were replaced with fresh medium using a sterile syringe without opening the MECs when the produced current started to decrease. All experiments were conducted at 30°C in a temperature controlled chamber. And all the reactors were covered by aluminum foils to eliminate the possibility of hydrogen production by photo-fermentation."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The volume of biogas produced by the mixed culture was measured using water replacement method by connecting a gas tight gradual cylinder with the MECs through plastic tubing. The gases produced by S. oneidensis in serum vial MECs were measured and released using a glass syringe. All biogases were sampled regularly and the composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 6890N; J&W Scientific, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a column (113-3133 CARBONPLT, 30m×0.32mm×3μm, J&W Scientific, USA) with argon as the carrier gas. The actual biogas production was calculated from the total gas production and their specific gas fractions as following: (1) V t = ( H s + V T , t ) G f where, Vt and VT,t , are the cumulative volume in mL for a specific biogas such as H2, CH4, and CO2 and the total cumulative volumes for all gases at sample time t, respectively, G f the gas fractions measured by GC, and H s headspaces of reactors, equaling 20 and 200mL for reactors with pure and mixed cultures, respectively. The expected biogas production based on the integrated current over time was calculated as: (2) V E, t = C t V M 2 F where, V E,t (mL) is the expected specific biogas production at sample time t based on integrated current over time in coulombs (C), F Faraday's number (96,485C/mol), C t the total Coulombs by integrating the current over time, and V M the molar gas volume (25,200mL/mol at 30°C). The cathodic hydrogen recovery (R CAT), which indicates the conversion of electron to hydrogen on the surface of cathode was obtained from the ratio of Vt over V E,t . The Coulombic efficiency (C E) based on total added substrate, energy recovery (η W) based on electricity input and overall energy recovery (η W+S) based on both electricity input and substrate added were calculated as previously described (Cheng and Logan, 2007; Logan, 2007). And the overall hydrogen recovery (R H2) was obtained as R H2 = C E R CAT. The Hydrogen yield (Y H2) was the amount of hydrogen produced based on total substrate added. The hydrogen yield based on the consumed substrate should be higher than the reported Y H2. The hydrogen production rate, Q H2 (m3/day/m3 or m3/day/m2) was calculated based on the measured hydrogen production rate normalized to the solution volume or anode surface area."
6,Results,
7,Hydrogen production by the mixed culture,"3.1 Hydrogen production by the mixed culture Hydrogen was produced right after the anodes from MFCs were placed in the MECs at an applied voltage of 0.6V. A total of 110mL of hydrogen was collected by the end of the first batch. The hydrogen production rate and current density continuously increased throughout the second batch. In the third batch, a stable current output (9.3A/m2) (based on anode surface area) was obtained and a total of 372mL hydrogen was collected by the end of third day with an average hydrogen production rate of 0.4m3/day/m3 based on the liquid volume of reactor and 0.086m3/day/m2 based on anode surface area (Fig. 2 ). Reducing the applied voltage from 0.6 to 0.4V resulted in about 56% decrease in both average current density (4.1A/m2) and hydrogen production rate (0.17m3/day/m3). The hydrogen production was accompanied by the production of CO2. The volumetric CO2 production rates were 0.1m3/day/m3 at 0.6V and 0.03m3/day/m3 at 0.4V in the third batch, which were about 18–25% of the hydrogen production rate. No CH4 were detected in first two batches (data not shown) and the first day of the third batch at both applied voltages. CH4 was started to accumulate in the second day of the third batch and its concentration increased to 3.5% and 5.5% by the end of third day at applied voltages of 0.6 and 0.4V, respectively. Accumulation of methane negatively affected hydrogen production when its content was beyond 1.5%. At applied voltage of 0.6V, hydrogen production rate was decreased from 0.53 to 0.25m3/day/m3 at the 43rd hour where the methane content was about 1.1% as shown in Fig. 2. When a voltage of 0.3V was applied to the MEC, no significant amount of biogas was produced with an estimated hydrogen production rate less than 0.01m3/day/m3. And no hydrogen was detected in the biotic control experiment during three-week operations. Applied voltages significantly influenced the hydrogen conversion efficiency of the single-chamber membrane-free MECs as summarized in Table 1 . The cathodic hydrogen recovery increased from 5% at 0.3V to 72% at 0.4V and further increased to 82% at 0.6V. Assuming all the substrate was consumed, the overall hydrogen recovery was 62% and 23% with a Coulombic efficiency of 75% and 32% at 0.6 and 0.4V, respectively. Correspondingly, the hydrogen yield was also reduced from 2.5 to 1.0mol of H2 per mol of acetate when applied voltage decreased from 0.6 to 0.4V. The energy efficiencies based on voltage input (η W) were 204% and 267% at an applied voltage of 0.6 and 0.4V, respectively. The fact that η W was bigger than 100% was resulted from the contribution of bacterial oxidation of acetate. Theoretically, η W will decrease to 100% when the applied voltage increases to around 1.45V (Logan, 2007). When the energy efficiency was evaluated on the basis of both the applied voltage and substrate oxidation (assuming all acetate was consumed), the overall energy efficiency (η W+S) were 58% and 27% at the applied voltages of 0.6 and 0.4V, respectively."
8,Inhibition of methanogenesis,"3.2 Inhibition of methanogenesis Methane produced in previous tests could be resulted from anaerobic methanogensis using acetate or H2/CO2 as substrates. It is also possible that methane could be produced through a well-known Sabatier process, catalyzed by metal catalysts on cathode (Brooks et al., 2007): (4) CO2 +4H2 →CH4 +2H2O The presence of methanogens using acetate as carbon sources would lower the Coulombic efficiency and hydrogen recovery by competing with the electrochemically active bacteria for substrates. Methane production from H2 and CO2 through methanogens or Sabatier process would lower the cathodic hydrogen recovery. The fact that no methane was detected in the first two batches using enriched bacteria from MFCs with acetate as carbon source indicates that the acetotrophic methanogens was not able to compete with the electrochemically active bacteria on the anode. Another fact that no activity was detected in the control experiment that run for 3 weeks using an autoclaved electrolysis cell (no inoculum) with H2 and CO2 in headspace indicates that the methane produced in the previous tests was not through the Sabatier process either. Therefore, the methane should be produced mainly through the catalytic activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Since methanogens are obligate anaerobes and sensitive to pH, oxygen, heat, and chemicals (Li and Fang, 2007), the following three approaches were applied to eliminate the methanogenesis in the system. 3.2.1 Operation of MECs at pH 5.8 It was reported that methane production rate would drop sharply at pH below 6.3 in fermentation processes since neutral pH is preferred by most of the methanogens (Chen et al., 2002; Van Hanndel and Lettinga, 1994). Experiments were conducted using pH 5.8 medium solution to investigate whether methanogens can be inhibited at lower pH without affecting the electrochemically active microorganisms. Although no methane was produced in the first two batches at the applied voltage of 0.6V, about 1.4% of methane was detected in the headspace by the end of the second day of the third batch. Such a concentration is comparable to the 1.5% at pH 7, indicating that methanogens were not suppressed by lowering the pH in the tested system. Similar results were also reported in fermentation systems where a high methanogenic activity was still found at pH 4.5 (Kim et al., 2004). 3.2.2 Exposure of cathodes to air Since methanogens are obligate anaerobes and sensitive to oxygen, experiments were conducted by exposing cathodes to air for 15min during medium replacement process to suppress their growth. Without exposure of cathodes to air, the content of methane kept increasing in the first four batches. About 9% of methane was detected in the headspace of the MEC operated with pH 5.8 solution by the end of the third batch, and 22% by the end of the fourth batch (Fig. 3 ). Hydrogen production rate decreased with the increase of methane accumulation. At the fifth batch, exposure of cathode to air for 15min significantly decreased the methane content to less than 1% in the following two days operation. Correspondingly, the hydrogen production rate was increased from 0.18m3/day/m3 in the fourth batch (26th–56th hour, Fig. 3) to 0.69m3/day/m3 in the fifth batch (56th–94th hour, Fig. 3). However, the hydrogen production rate started to reduce after 94th hour due to the decrease of current density caused by the decreased substrate concentration and the slightly increase in methane production. This decline was accompanied with a drop in CO2 production from 0.206 to 0.076m3/day/m3 in the same period. The current density was in the range of 13–15.7A/m2 in the fifth batch (56th–94th hour) with an overall hydrogen recovery of 64% at pH 5.8 (Table 1). 3.2.3 Heat treatment of anodes Heat treatment of seed sludge (75–121°C for 15min–2h) has been commonly used in fermentative hydrogen production processes to screen spore-forming hydrogen-producing bacteria and inhibit methanogenesis (Li and Fang, 2007; Logan et al., 2006). In this study, heat treatment was also applied to suppress methanogens. Anodes with bacteria enriched in MFCs were boiled at 100°C for 15min before being placed in the MECs. No biogases were produced in the first-week operation at an applied voltage of 0.6V. Less than 2% of hydrogen was detected at the end of first batch (14 days) in comparison to the 40% without heat treatment, suggesting that electrochemically active microorganisms were affected by the heat treatment. On the other hand, about 1% of methane was still detected in the headspace, indicating that the methanogens present in the mixed culture were not completely suppressed."
9,Hydrogen production by S. oneidensis,"3.3 Hydrogen production by S. oneidensis Fig. 4 represents hydrogen production from lactic acid by S. oneidensis in the single-chamber membrane-free MEC at an applied voltage of 0.6V. A hydrogen content of 0.7% was detected in the headspace after the MEC was inoculated with S. oneidensis for 18h. A total of 2.5ml (about 12% in the headspace) of hydrogen was accumulated in the first batch. After half solution (40mL) was replaced with S. oneidensis medium solution around the 500th hour, hydrogen production rate was increased significantly from less than 0.005m3/day/m3 in the first batch to about 0.025m3/day/m3 with a total of 23mL hydrogen collected by the 1400th hour. Carbon dioxide was also accumulated but no methane was detected over two-month operation. No activities were detected in the control experiment during three-week operations."
10,Discussion,"By using a single-chamber MEC without a membrane, it was possible to produce hydrogen as much as 0.53m3/day/m3 at pH 7.0 and 0.69m3/day/m3 at pH 5.8 with a mixed bacterial culture at an applied voltage of 0.6V. These values are 76% and 130% higher than that (0.3m3/day/m3) of using a gas-cathode-chamber MEC at applied voltage of 1.0V (Rozendal et al., 2007), but lower than the 1.1m3 H2/day/m3 reported by Cheng and Logan (2007) using a two-chamber MEC. The current density (9.3A/m2 at pH 7.0 and 14A/m2 at pH 5.8) generated in this study, however, is over three times higher than that reported in a two-chamber system (3A/m2) reported by Liu et al. (2005) and 18 times higher than that of the gas-cathode-chamber MEC (less than 0.5A/m2) (Rozendal et al., 2007) at same applied voltage of 0.6V. Furthermore, it is also 69% higher than the current density of 5.5A/m2 (calculated based on the hydrogen production rate and energy efficiency) reported by Cheng and Logan (2007). The high current densities achieved here was possibly resulted from the removal of membrane, which could contribute 38% of total resistance using CEM and 26% using AEM at an applied voltage of 1.0V (Rozendal et al., 2007). While high current density should result in high hydrogen production rate, the relatively low hydrogen production rate reported here was mainly due to the large MEC volume/electrode ratio employed in this study. If the MEC volume reduces to a similar size as the electrode set, the hydrogen production rate has the potential to increase to 4–7m3/day/m3. Since the electrodes were spaced 2cm apart in the MECs of this study, further reducing the distance between anode and cathode would decrease the ohmic resistance, which in turn would increase the current density and hydrogen production rate. Unlike the single-chamber membrane-free MFCs, in which decreasing the anode and cathode spacing to less than 1cm would lead to a decrease in current densities due to the effect of oxygen on anode bacteria (Cheng et al., 2006), the spacing between the anode and cathode in MECs can be very small since no oxygen is present in the system. In addition to high current density and potential hydrogen production rate, the single-chamber membrane-free systems also possess other advantages, such as, simplifying system design, lowering the cost of operation, maintenance and construction, preventing problems specifically associated with membranes, and avoiding concerns on water pressure of cathode if one side of the cathode facing to the gas phase. The potential loss of hydrogen due to the growth of hydrogenotrophic microorganisms remains a challenge for this single-chamber membrane-free system using a mixed culture. It might be the main reason for the low cathodic hydrogen recovery (72% at 0.4V and 82% at 0.6V at pH 7) obtained in this study in comparison with the 92–101% recovery reported in two-chamber systems (Liu et al., 2005; Rozendal et al., 2007; Cheng and Logan, 2007). However, by employing suitable approaches, such as exposure of cathodes to air combined with control of retention time less than two days, it is possible to suppress the hydrogenotrophic bacteria, resulting in a decrease of CH4 production. Another approach of avoiding the consumption of hydrogen is to use pure bacterial culture. Here we demonstrated the hydrogen production from lactic acid by S. oneidensis MR-1 without the formation of CH4, although its current density and hydrogen production rates are quite low in comparison with the mixed culture. Screening of highly efficient microorganisms from the mixed culture and/or engineering the microorganism through genetic modification would significantly increase the feasibility of this technology with a single-chamber membrane-free design."
11,Conclusions,"• Single-chamber membrane-free MECs were designed and successfully produced hydrogen from organic matter using one mixed culture and one pure culture: Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. • At an applied voltage of 0.6V, a hydrogen production rate of 0.53m3/day/m3 was obtained using a mixed bacterial culture by the single-chamber MECs operated at pH 7.0. Higher hydrogen production rate (0.69m3/day/m3) was obtained when the MECs were operated at pH 5.8. • High current densities of 9.3A/m2 (pH 7) and 14A/m2 were achieved with the mixed culture in the single-chamber MEC system, attributing to the reduced potential losses associated with membrane. • Applied voltages exerted significant influences on MEC's performance. The performances at 0.6V were more than two times higher than those at 0.4V in terms of hydrogen production rate, overall energy efficiency, hydrogen yield, Coulombic efficiency and current density. While 0.3V was the minimum applied voltage to achieve measurable hydrogen production rate in the MEC system. • Hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the mixed culture systems adversely affected hydrogen production. However, their activities can be effectively suppressed by exposing cathodes to air for 15min combined with control of retention time less than two days. Lowering solution pH (5.8) and heat treatment (100°C) for 15min) of electrode did not effectively inhibit the activities of methanogens. • Methanogenesis was avoided by using the pure bacterial culture S. oneidensis in this MEC system. However, the current hydrogen production rates were much lower than those with the mixed culture systems. • The current density and volumetric hydrogen production rate of this system have potential to increase significantly by further reducing the electrode spacing and increasing the ratio of electrode surface area/cell volume."
