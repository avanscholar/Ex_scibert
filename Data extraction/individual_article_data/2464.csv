0,Introduction,"Selective catalytic hydrogenation of naturally appearing sugar molecules such as glucose, fructose, xylose, and lactose to the corresponding sugar alcohols is an environmentally benign route to the production of alternative sweeteners based on renewable sources. The preparation of sugar alcohols is based on the following principle: heterogeneous solid, metal-based catalysts, such as sponge nickel and supported ruthenium are used in an aqueous environment and the hydrogen addition is materialized through molecular hydrogen. Thus the use of stoichiometric reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride, is avoided and the hydrogenation process produces no inorganic salts as waste material. The conventional production technology of sugar alcohols is based on the use of batchwise operating slurry reactors: finely dispersed, supported or sponge metal catalyst (catalyst particles smaller than 0.1mm) are immersed in a batch of an aqueous sugar solution, to which hydrogen is continuously added so that the pressure is kept constant. Among the reported operating conditions, it can be found that hydrogen pressure is typically kept at 30–180bar and the temperature ranges from 80°C to 150°C [1,2]. The batchwise production technology is well-established, but as the production volumes of sugar alcohols are expected to increase, continuous production technology should be regarded as a serious option. Continuous reactor technology is a well-established process for the production of bulk chemicals as well as components in fossil and renewable fuels. The most common continuous reactor in catalytic processes is fixed bed, its main benefit being that it is a proven technology and modeling of two-phase fixed beds (gas or liquid+a solid catalyst) is principally well known. However, as a third phase enters the scene, the picture is essentially complicated but, in general, three-phase fixed beds are reliable and sustainable. Furthermore, the catalyst activities can easily be monitored, since the decline in the activity is directly revealed and both the pressure drop and the retarding effect of internal diffusion are illustrated by carrying out experiments with different particle sizes. In recent years, the continuous operation in sugar hydrogenation has been demonstrated, for instance, for glucose hydrogenation in fixed beds, in monoliths and on activated carbon cloths [1,3,4]. Furthermore, it is possible to carry out sugar hydrogenation in loop reactors, where the liquid, containing the catalyst, is recirculated through an external loop system [1]. Since the sugar molecules are large and the solubility of hydrogen is limited, the diffusion limitation inside the porous catalyst layer becomes severe in porous catalyst layers, as has been demonstrated experimentally and by numerical simulations [5,6]. Therefore, egg-shell catalyst pellets and structured catalysts can be considered as feasible alternatives to slurry technology. The basis of any kind of technology development is the intrinsic reaction kinetics, which has been measured experimentally and modeled mathematically for several sugars [7]. However, as incursion into more complex production technologies progresses, the need to measure physical properties arises. Density, viscosity and hydrogen solubility data is of high importance when dealing with systems prone to internal and external mass transfer limitations (such as conventional fixed bed reactors)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Density measurements,"2.1 Density measurements Density measurements for aqueous sugar solutions (l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-maltose, l-rhamnose) were carried out in an Anton-Paar DMA-512P oscillating U-tube density meter equipment (±0.0001g/cm3), operating at a pressure range of 1–20bar and between 60 and 130°C. A Grant GP-200 (±0.1°C) thermostatic bath with oil as heating fluid was used to control the temperature within the measuring cell. To recognize inaccuracies in the temperature, due to heat loss, a thermocouple (±1°C) was inserted directly into the measuring chamber to monitor the temperature. The system was pressurized with nitrogen (AGA 99.999%) at 5bar to prevent evaporation of the solutions fed at high temperatures. The density values were obtained directly from the device. Sugar solutions of 25 and 50wt.% were prepared for each sugar sample. Before feeding the samples into the equipment, the measuring cell was cleaned several times with hot water and ethanol to wash out any impurity that could compromise the reliability of the measurement. The cell was flushed with nitrogen (AGA 99.999%) to dry it. The solution was fed in excess to evacuate gas bubbles using sterilized syringes. At this instant, all the valves were closed, the system was pressurized and it was considered to be the starting point of the measurement. Once the density values were recorded, the system was purged with water and ethanol several times."
3,Viscosity measurements,"2.2 Viscosity measurements The viscosities of the different aqueous sugar solutions were measured by using an Ostwald glass capillary viscometer, operating between 60 and 90°C and at atmospheric pressure. Solutions of 25 and 50wt.% were prepared for each of the studied sugars (l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-maltose, l-rhamnose). The Ostwald viscometer was filled with the different solutions and placed vertically in a Heidolph Ekt 3001 water thermostatic bath with a ±1°C precision. Once the thermal equilibrium was reached, the efflux times of the liquids were recorded with a digital stopwatch with a precision of ±0.01s. The measurements were performed in quintuplets at the different conditions of temperature and composition to minimize the experimental error. The viscosity determination by using Ostwald viscometers is an indirect technique, i.e. the measured variable is not the viscosity itself but the efflux time of the liquid through the capillary in the viscometer. Once the efflux times are determined, the kinematic viscosity is obtained from v 1 = ( t 1 t 0 ) ⋅ v 0 , where ν0 [m2/s] is the kinematic viscosity of a known fluid; t0 [s] is the efflux time of the known liquid through the viscometer; t1 [s] is the efflux time of the sample through the viscometer and ν1 [m2/s] is the kinematic viscosity of the sample. The dynamic viscosity (μ) of the sample is then obtained with the aid of the previously determined kinematic viscosity and the density of the solution: μ=νρ. The reference fluid was de-ionized water and its viscosity values were obtained from the literature [8]. This calibration of the viscometer with pure water was carried out for all the studied temperatures. To verify that the test solutions remained at their nominal concentrations within reasonable limits, solution samples were withdrawn before and after the determinations and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). No significant changes in the concentrations were observed."
4,Hydrogen solubility measurements,"2.3 Hydrogen solubility measurements The hydrogen solubility of different aqueous solutions of sugars were measured in-situ with a Fugatron HYD-100 equipped with a polymeric perfluoro-alkoxy copolymer (FPA) hydrogen-permeating probe, operating between 90 and 130°C and 10–60bar. Table 1 shows the different sugar solutions used for the hydrogen solubility measurements. The Fugatron probe was attached to a pressurized batch reactor (Parr 4561, 300mL) equipped with baffles, a gas entrainment impeller, a heating jacket, a temperature and stirring rate controller (Parr 4843), a Brooks Instruments pressure controller and microprocessor (Brooks 5866 and Brooks 0154 respectively), and a bubbling chamber for the sugar solution pre-treatment. After feeding the different sugar solutions to the system, the reactor was purged with nitrogen for 15min to evacuate oxygen. The gas inlet was switched to hydrogen and the Fugatron instrument was switched on. Subsequently, pressurizing with hydrogen and heating were carried out simultaneously until the desired operating conditions were reached. The stirring speed was set to 1000rpm to suppress external mass transfer limitations in the system [9]. At the given temperature, pressure and stirring conditions, the system was left to stabilize during 15min to guarantee that the solution was saturated with hydrogen and then the values of the hydrogen concentration were recorded. Calibration of Fugatron HYD-100 is an essential part of the measurement. The Fugatron HYD-100 instrument gives information about the concentration (inppm) of the permeated hydrogen from the problem solution into the carrier gas. Hence, a calibration of the equipment needs to be done before each measurement to estimate the calibration constant (f), which correlates to the concentration of hydrogen in the liquid bulk via the following equation, (1) C L , H 2 = f . x where f is the equipment calibration constant; CL,H2 [mol/L] is the concentration of hydrogen in the bulk; and x [ppm H2] is the concentration of hydrogen permeated in the carrier gas. The calibration constant was calculated as follows. The system was loaded, heated and pressurized, following the procedure described in previous section. The amount of the sample fed (VL) and the first state of pressurization (P0) were arbitrary, although these values were registered. The temperature of the calibration was the same as in the measurements, since the calibration is highly temperature dependent. Subsequently, the Fugatron equipment and stirring (1000rpm) were turned on and the system was let to stabilize. Once the reading at Fugatron was constant, the stirring was switched off, and a step disturbance of the hydrogen pressure (P1) was introduced into the system. Stirring was turned on (1000rpm) and the system was let to stabilize to guarantee the saturation of the sample with hydrogen. After 15min, the hydrogen absorption had certainly reached the equilibrium at pressure P2. At this moment, P2 and the value reported by Fugatron (x*), was registered. The registered values of VL, P0, P1 and P2, were used to calculate the Henry’s constant [9], (2) 1 H e = ( P 1 − P 2 ) V G ( P 2 − P 0 ) V L R T where He is the Henry’s constant [Latm/mol]; P1 is the initial pressure before absorption; P2 is the equilibrium pressure after absorption; P0 is the equilibrium pressure of the lower initial pressurization state; VG is the volume of the gas phase; VL is the volume of the liquid phase; R is the universal gas constant [0.082Latm/molK]; and T is the absolute temperature of the system [K]. Once the Henry’s constant was obtained, the saturation concentration of hydrogen in the bulk was calculated from Eq. (3). Finally, the calibration constant was calculated from (3) C L , H 2 H e = P * (4) f = C * L , H 2 x * where f is the calibration constant, C L , H 2 * is the saturation concentration, and x* is the equilibrium concentration in the Fugatron after the absorption (P2)."
5,Catalyst preparation,"2.4 Catalyst preparation A summary of the catalysts employed throughout this study is presented in Table 1. The details about the synthesis of the catalyst are given in the following sub-sections. The active metal present in all of the catalysts was ruthenium. 2.4.1 Preparation of Ru/Active carbon cloth (Ru/ACC) catalyst Before beginning the impregnation process, a batch of the clothes (KYNOL™ ACC-5092-15, Fig. 1 ) was pre-activated in solutions of HNO3 and H2O2 while the remaining batch was not pre-activated at all. The pre-activation consisted of a treatment with 5wt% HNO3 aqueous solution at 80°C for three hours to introduce oxidic surface groups. Afterwards, the cloth was carefully washed and placed in a solution containing 2ml of H2O2 30 w% in 100ml of de-ionized water at 60°C for two hours. Finally, the support was removed from the bath and left to cool down in the solution for two more hours. After pre-activation, the clothes were washed first in ethanol and then left to dry overnight at 60°C. Afterwards, a solution of RuCl3 in either ethanol or acetone was prepared (the amount of RuCl3 was calculated aiming at a 5wt% of Ru loading on the support) and the clothes were submerged in this solution and rotated by means of a mechanical stirrer. The beaker containing the solution and the support was submerged in a cooling bath (−10°C) for 20h to prevent the evaporation of ethanol and to promote the exothermic adsorption process. Once passed the impregnation time, the cloths were removed from the solution and washed with abundant de-ionized water. To guarantee a complete removal of the chlorine ions, the active carbon cloths were submerged in a basic (pH=13.20) NaOH solution under mild stirring for 24h. The clothes were washed with water and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Ultrasound irradiation during the impregnation was tested, too. 2.4.2 Preparation of Ru on carbon washcoated steel (Ru/CSS) structures The CSS structures (Fig. 2 ) were obtained from University of Eastern Finland (Joensuu, Finland). No pretreatment was applied and the deposition of ruthenium was achieved by either one of two methodologies: the first one resembles that of the Ru/ACC, only that water was used as a solvent, thus eliminating the need to chill the precursor solution. The second technique was based on the incipient wetness method as it will be explained in the following. A concentrated RuCl3 solution, containing the incipient wetness amount of solvent (maximum liquid volume that can be taken up by the support without overflowing), and a calculated amount of ruthenium (5wt.% of the support) was prepared. The solution was added to the support and it was left to dry overnight at room temperature and then in the oven for three hours at 80°C. To guarantee a complete removal of water, the sample was further heated in a quartz oven under nitrogen flow at 120°C for 1h. Subsequently, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of 10% H2/N2 for two hours at 400°C. Finally, passivation was carried out by exposing the catalyst to a mixture of 2mol-% oxygen diluted in nitrogen and increasing the O2 concentration by 1mol-% every 5min up to 20mol-% O2/N2."
6,Hydrogenation of l-arabinose in continuous mode,"2.5 Hydrogenation of l-arabinose in continuous mode Catalytic hydrogenation of l-arabinose was carried out in a continuous three-phase system using three types of catalysts: carbon nanotubes supported on random stainless steel sponges (Ru/CSS), discs of activated carbon clothes (Ru/ACC), and crushed extrudates of a commercial catalyst (Ru/C 0.7wt.% Ru, Engelhard). For a summary of the catalysts employed in the continuous reactor refer to Table 2 . The set-up consisted of a high pressure liquid metering pump (Eldex Optos 1SMP), an ohmic resistance for heating, and controllers for backpressure (Brooks 5866), gas mass flow (Brooks 5850S) and temperature (CAL Controls 9500P); the backpressure controller was located downstream whereas the mass flow controller was located at the inlet. The temperature was measured using two thermocouples: one placed inside the tube and the other on the outer core of the reactor (Fig. 3 ). The experiments were performed in a tube reactor having a length 120mm and an inner diameter of 12.5mm. Fig. 4 shows the inner structure of the reactor and how the different catalysts were loaded. The operating conditions are described in Table 3 . For the structured catalysts (Ru/ACC, Ru/CSS) only one set of parameters were tested, whereas for the commercial ground extrudates a more thorough screening was carried out by the means of a 2 I V 4 − 1 fractional factorial design (refer to Section 5.2 for further information on the design of experiments). The aim was to reveal the potential of the new structured catalysts and compare their performance with that of classical supported catalyst particles. Prior to every experiment, the reactor was purged during 15min with argon to evacuate the oxygen from the system. The catalyst was reduced in-situ with H2 flow (AGA 99.999%) at 200°C for 150min. After reducing the catalyst, the operating conditions, i.e. temperature and pressure were adjusted. The feedstock was bubbled with hydrogen for 10min before each experiment to eliminate the oxygen in solution and guarantee hydrogen saturation. Subsequently, the solutions were fed through the piston pump. At this moment, the reaction was considered to commence and samples were taken at intervals of 15min during two hours. The samples were analyzed with HPLC."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods 2.6.1 Chemical analysis: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) The off line concentration analysis of sugar and sugar alcohols was performed by using a high performance liquid chromatograph (HP 1100 Series LC) equipped with a Biorad Aminex HPX 87C carbohydrate column and coupled to a refractive index detector (HP 1047A). The eluent was HPLC grade water with 0.005M CaSO4 for the rejuvenation of the column. The column was heated at 80°C and the flow rate was adjusted to 0.4ml/min. The analysis results were recorded with HP Chemstation software. The injection volume was 1μl. The analysis results were recorded with the HP Chemstation software. The analysis time for a sample was 45min. 2.6.2 Surface area: nitrogen physisorption The specific surface area was measured with nitrogen adsorption using a sorptometer (Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1900). The surface area was calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. 2.6.3 Morphology: transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) An energy filtered transmission electron microscope (EFTEM LEO 912 OMEGA, 120kV) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM/EDS, Jeol JSM 6400) were used to study the microstructure of the support as well as the distribution, the size and the concentration of the catalyst. Images of the catalyst were obtained with a Leo Gemini 1530 scanning electron microscope equipped with a thermoNoran Vantage X-ray detector. The images were taken by using Secondary Electron and Backscattered Electron detector at 15kV, and the in-Lens Secondary Electron detector at 2.70kV. 2.6.4 Metal dispersion: pulse chemisorption The ruthenium metal dispersion was measured by chemisorption. An AutoChem 2910 instrument (Micromeritics) was used for the pulse chemisorption measurements of CO. The weighed sample was reduced under hydrogen at 200°C during 150min, and then cooled down to 50°C. Subsequently, pulses of a mixture of 10% CO in He were introduced. The chemisorption stoichiometry CO:Ru=1:1 was assumed [10]. 2.6.5 Metal content: induced current plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) A PerkinElmer SCIEX ICP Mass Spectrometer Elan 6100 DRC Plus was used to measure the ruthenium contents of the catalysts."
8,Physical properties of sugars – reaction and diffusion in porous catalyst layers,"Throughout this section, the discussion will be approached in a generic manner since the four studied sugars (l-arabinose, d-galactose, l-rhamnose and d-maltose) exhibit the same behavior in each of the studied physical properties (density, viscosity and hydrogen solubility). The interaction between reaction and diffusion in porous catalyst layer will be evaluated quantitatively to judge the perspectives of continuous operation and structured catalysts."
9,Density of aqueous sugar solutions,"3.1 Density of aqueous sugar solutions Experimental results are presented in Fig. 4. The dependence of the density on the temperature of the system can be described as linear, i.e. the higher the temperature, the lower the density. The densities of the sugar solutions increased strongly with increasing sugar concentration. This behavior is rather typical. The density values were correlated by multivariable nonlinear regression, which resulted in an empirical polynomial expression that represents the behavior of density as a function of the temperature and the sugar concentration, (5) ρ [ k g m 3 ] = − A ⋅ T ⋅ C S + B ⋅ C S 2 + C ⋅ C S + D − E ⋅ T + F ⋅ T 2 where A, B, C, D, E and F are regressed constants, T [°C] is temperature of the system and CSugar (wt.%) is the concentration of the solution. The parameters are summarized in Table 4 . Fig. 5 shows how the behavior of the density of l-arabinose changes with temperature and concentration. It is also possible to observe that there are no unexpected irregularities that could arise due to the empirical and polynomial nature of the model. Nevertheless, extrapolations outside the given ranges should be done carefully given that the applicability of the correlation has yet to be validated."
10,Viscosities of aqueous sugar solutions,"3.2 Viscosities of aqueous sugar solutions An exponential decline of the dynamic viscosity with increasing temperature was observed. The sugar concentration had an enormous impact on the viscosity as revealed by Fig. 5. Viscosity can be correlated as a function of temperature and concentration by the following expression proposed in the literature [11]: (6) ln ( μ ) = a + b ⋅ C S 1 + c ⋅ C S + ( α + β ⋅ C S 2 ) ⋅ ( 1 T − 1 T 0 ) where a, b, c, α and β are constants, CSugar is the concentration of the solution in molal units [mol/kg H2O], T [K] is the temperature of the system and T0 is an assumed reference temperature (298K). The parameters are listed in Table 5 . A numerical regression was performed and the best parameters were estimated by minimizing the value of the square sum of errors (SSE). A very good agreement was found between the measured and calculated values. Fig. 6 shows how Eq. (6) represents the tendencies of the dynamic viscosity with respect to the temperature and the sugar concentration. As with the expression for the prediction of the sugar density, care should be taken when extrapolating outside the ranges of temperature and concentration since its applicability outside such intervals remains yet to be validated."
11,Hydrogen solubility,"3.3 Hydrogen solubility The hydrogen solubility in the 10wt.% l-arabinose aqueous solution showed to have a tendency to increase exponentially with respect to the temperature of the system, whereas a linear dependence of the hydrogen solubility with the pressure was observed. It is generally known that the hydrogen solubility increases in aqueous solutions with increasing temperature, which is caused when water looses its polarity as the temperature is increased. The following empirical expression is proposed to represent the values of hydrogen solubility as a function of temperature and pressure: (7) C H 2 = A ⋅ P H2 ⋅ T+B ⋅ T 2 +C ⋅ T+D+E ⋅ P H2 +F ⋅ P H 2 2 where A, B, C, D, E and F are empirical constants; T [K] is the temperature of the system; P [bar] is the pressure of the system; and C H 2 [mol/L] is the hydrogen concentration in the liquid bulk. The model fitting was again carried out by built-in multivariable non-linear regression, resulting in the empirical polynomial expression, Eq. (7), which represents the hydrogen solubility as a function of temperature and sugar concentration (Fig. 7 ). A good agreement between the generated and experimental values of hydrogen solubility was obtained by using the proposed empirical correlation (Eq. (9)). Care should be taken in extrapolating the results outside the experimental domain (Table 6 )."
12,Modelling of reaction and diffusion in porous catalyst layers,"3.4 Modelling of reaction and diffusion in porous catalyst layers The measured and modeled data for the dynamic viscosity were used to estimate the molecular diffusion coefficients of hydrogen and the sugars in aqueous solutions. The well-known correlation of Wilke and Chang [6] was used in the estimation of the molecular diffusion coefficients, after which the molecular diffusion coefficient was corrected for the porosity and tortuosity of the catalyst particle. The kinetic model was taken from our previous publication [7], in which finely dispersed Ru/C catalyst were studied in the absence of mass transfer limitations and the rate parameters were determined. At 90°C, the dynamic viscosity of an L-arabinose solution can vary between 0.44cP and 1.1 cP, depending on the strength of the solution (Fig. 8 ). The estimation of the molecular diffusion coefficients of hydrogen and the sugar by using the experimental viscosity data and Wilke-Chang equation reveals, that the diffusion coefficients are within the range of 5.1–12.4 10−9 m2/s for hydrogen and 0.84–2.1 10−9 m2/s for the sugar. The effective diffusion coefficient was assumed to be about 25% of the molecular diffusion coefficient. The concentration profiles inside the porous catalyst particle were computed by solving numerically the reaction-diffusion model for a porous catalyst layer [12]. Some simulation results are displayed in Fig. 8, which clearly reveals the strong diffusion limitation inside the catalyst layer, if the layer thickness (the catalyst particle diameter) exceeds 0.5mm. On the other hand, if the catalyst layer thickness is 0.2mm or less, the operation at the kinetic regime, the highest possible hydrogenation rate is guaranteed. For fixed beds operated in large scale, the catalyst particle diameter should exceed 1mm, which implies that the process becomes heavily controlled by internal mass transfer as revealed by Fig. 8. For catalyst particles having suitable diameters for continuous large-scale operation (>2mm), in order to avoid extensive pressure drop, the internal part of the catalyst is not used because of strong diffusion limitation. Thus the development of alternative technologies, such as structured reactors is highly motivated for sugar hydrogenation processes."
13,Catalyst characterization results,"The characterization results of the catalysts are summarized in Table 7 . SEM and TEM images of the structured catalysts are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 . Out of the two support materials, the most promising was the active carbon cloth (ACC). This material is by far superior in regards of surface area to the more common active carbon powders employed in previous studies [7]. Despite the low metal content, the ACC-based catalysts exhibit an efficient deposition of the active metal (small metal clusters and relatively high dispersion), which is comparable with commercial catalysts. Ultrasound had a detrimental effect on the metal cluster size and its distribution on the surface of the support. The same can be concluded about the effect of support pretreatment, though in this later case the effect is much less evident. The best conditions for impregnating the active carbon clothes seem to be those for which no pretreatment and no ultrasonic irradiation are involved and only the precursor solution and the support are left to interact. When it comes to the precursor solution, RuCl3 dissolves readily in ethanol and acetone and with much more difficulty in water. Of the previously named two organic solvents, it surfaces that the ethanol solutions produced a catalyst with a richer metal content albeit a lower dispersion and larger metal clusters. The impregnation technique proved to be inappropriate for the deposition of ruthenium on the carbon nanotubes grown on the metallic structures. Although the amount of ruthenium that adhered to the support surface was comparable to that of the carbon clothes, the dispersion and ruthenium cluster size were evidently worse. Moreover, and due to the nanoporosity of the carbon nanotube coating, it was not possible to determine the surface area of the support with the available techniques (Table 8 )."
14,Hydrogenation results from the continuous reactor,
15,Hydrogenation of l-arabinose on ACC and CSS supported Ru catalysts,"5.1 Hydrogenation of l-arabinose on ACC and CSS supported Ru catalysts The activities of the synthesized catalysts were determined according to the conditions listed in Table 3. The average conversion (i.e. the average of the discrete samples withdrawn at the outlet of the reactor throughout a time on stream of 150min) and turnover number (TON) are summarized in Table 9 . In all the cases, except CSS#1, all the catalysts were active in sugar hydrogenation, and, moreover, 100% selective towards l-arabitol as no by-products were detected by HPLC. A detailed comparison of the performances of the structured catalysts is provided by Fig. 11 . It must be noted that conversion is a direct result of, among others, the residence time, which can be adjusted by increasing the size of the catalyst bed. The difference in the activity of the catalysts, the turnover number (TON) cannot be explained by the properties of the metal clusters as no clear trend could be established for the experiments carried on the ACC/Ru catalysts. However, it was observed that CSS#2 exhibited a higher TON than the ACC counterparts but, in general, and considering the average conversion, ACC catalysts turned out to be superior to the CSS catalysts, the latter’s main problem being their inability to support higher ruthenium loads. Alternative deposition methods for CSS should be investigated in future. Regarding the endurance of the catalysts to deactivation under operating conditions, both catalyst groups exhibited a decrease in their activity during the first two hours of the experiments, but as a steady state was reached, the catalyst deactivation rate strongly decreased."
16,Hydrogenation of l-arabinose on commercial catalyst particles,"5.2 Hydrogenation of l-arabinose on commercial catalyst particles A total of eight experiments were executed in order to assess how the performance of the continuous hydrogenation system with a commercial catalyst is affected by the studied parameters (temperature, gas flow, liquid flow and catalyst particle size, see Table 3). The change of more than one parameter simultaneously follows a 24−1 fractional factorial design of experiments with resolution IV (main effects are only confounded with higher level (negligible) interactions). Thus, an overall description of the response from the system can be extracted by statistically analyzing the obtained results as a whole. The selectivity was 100% in all the experiments and the l-arabinose conversion levels are summarized in Table 9. In every case, catalyst deactivation was observed as exemplified in Fig. 12 with two extreme cases of high and low conversions. As shown in Table 9, average conversions up to 13.7% were achieved. No by-products were yielded according to HPLC. In the studied ranges, the temperature and liquid flow rate were the governing factors, which become evident in both the average effect and in experiment #6. The reaction was promoted by low liquid flow rates, which enabled the highest liquid residence times. The positive effect of the temperature is tied to two factors: the Arrhenius nature of the rate constants as well as the increase of the hydrogen solubility with increasing temperature. However, it should be taken into consideration that sugars tend to decompose at higher temperatures, thus restricting the freedom at which the temperature can be manipulated. Finally, it can be seen that the catalyst particle size had evidently no effect in these experiments. This is in correspondence with performed mathematical modeling of porous catalyst particles and numerical simulations of sugar and hydrogen concentration profiles inside the particle, which suggest an optimal particle size of ca. 200μm [12]. For larger catalyst particles, the internal diffusion of hydrogen and the sugar molecule start to retard the reaction rate (Fig. 8). For smaller particles, on the other hand, the pressure drop becomes high in continuous operation. Moreover, the detrimental effect of the lower size fraction is related to the stability of the packed bed, as the smallest particles tend to be dragged along the flow thus slightly reducing the catalyst load. From these drawbacks, it becomes evident that structured catalysts in the form of Ru/ACC are to be preferred, as they exhibited a remarkable stability with no catalyst particles being transported downstream."
17,Conclusions,"Density, viscosity and hydrogen solubility of four different sugars in aqueous solutions (l-arabinose, d-galactose, l-maltose and l-rhamnose) were determined. These data provide the primary information for the simulation of diverse process, including design and scale-up/number-up of hydrogenation reactors. Hydrogenation of l-arabinose in a continuous three-phase reactor using three different types of catalysts was successful. Deposition of Ru on ACC and CSS supports yielded active catalysts. Of these two supports, ACC proved to be superior as it is easily handled, structurally more stable than CSS and able to bond higher ruthenium loads. A commercial catalyst was employed for screening different operational conditions. It was demonstrated that catalysts particles below 200 micrometers are indifferent to internal mass transfer resistance and that l-arabinose hydrogenation thrives at relatively lower hydrogen and liquid flows, 100ml/min and 1ml/min respectively. Higher temperatures will yield an increased conversion but care should be taken in regards to the point at which sugar molecules start to decompose by caramelization. The work shows that continuous hydrogenation of sugars to sugar alcohols has a perspective over structured ruthenium catalysts. Moreover, the best structured catalyst (ACC) produced conversions, which very well compete with conventional catalyst particles."
