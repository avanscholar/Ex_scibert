0,Introduction,"The processes for converting petroleum fuels into hydrogen-rich gas products include steam reforming [1,2], partial oxidation [3,4], auto thermal reforming [5,6], dry reforming [7,8] or a combination of two or more [9,10]. Despite their advantages, each of these processes has disadvantages such as the design, fuel, and operating temperature. Suitable fuels include gaseous hydrocarbons, such as methane, propane, LPG, and butane and liquid hydrocarbons such as alcohols, gasoline, and diesel. Particularly, steam reforming has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production. Gaseous hydrocarbons can reduce the catalyst life and degrade the performance of the hydrogen production because of the catalytic poison that results from the CO generation during the oxidation reaction. To solve these problems, methanol, acetic acid, and dimethyl ether, which include oxygen, have been used as raw materials in order to manufacture hydrogen [11–13]. These are completely oxidized to CO2 during the reforming reaction and the reformation of ethanol in the presence of steam has been a general practice for hydrogen production. Recently, ethanol has been used for steam reforming because of its non-toxicity and ease of transport and storage. However, the oxidation temperature of ethanol is higher than that of methanol or dimethyl ether, making its decomposition difficult. One advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol that is reformed because hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam. C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 ( Δ H 298 0 = 174 kJ / mol ) Nickel-based catalysts that were supported on Al2O3, SiO2, and various zeolites containing alkali metals have been investigated for the ethanol-reforming reactions. However, the coke formation that occurs through the rapid sintering between the Ni and the supports is a serious problem [14–16]. Additionally nickel-based catalysts are susceptible to deactivation resulting from the deposition of carbon, even when operating at steam-to-carbon ratios predicted to be thermodynamically outside of the carbon-forming regime. Both reforming and coke deposition are believed to be initiated by the same elementary hydrocarbon activation step. Under steam-reforming conditions, the intermediates to CO and H2, and the adsorbed CHx species on the Ni surface can undergo further dehydrogenation, polymerization, and rearrangement into highly stable carbon species that not only show low reactivity toward the gasification reaction, but also rapid catalytic deactivation. An especially serious problem in NiAlO4 catalysts is the abrupt catalytic deactivation that occurs at high temperatures above 650°C, due to the formation of a NiAlO3 spinal structure resulting from the strong sintering between Ni and Al, and this deactivation leads to reactor shutdown and the reversal of the feed gases [17,18]. To overcome these problems, Sato et al. [19] reported that after reductive and oxidative treatment, Ni/MgO and Co/MgO were active for H2 production, with Ni/MgO exhibiting particularly high and stable activity. On Ni/MgO, the extent of catalytic degradation (coking on the catalyst, oxidation of metal, and sintering of metal particles) was minimal, thus confirming the formation of fine Ni0 particles that interacted strongly with MgO. Aksoylu et al. [20] reported that the Pt–Ni catalyst was very prone to catalytic deactivation at low steam/CO ratios accompanied by high C/O2 ratios. However, some problems remain in terms of the catalytic activity and lifetime. Therefore, we suggest herein that if there is a metal component which having abilities of hydrocarbon cracking, hydrogen attraction from hydrocarbon, and depressing the sintering between Ni and Al support as adding between them, the hydrogen production in hydrocarbon steam reforming will be improved. Thus, Ga component is introduced to the Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y catalyst to improve the conversion of ethanol into CO and CO2 by dehydrogenation in this study. Maybe the degradation of the catalyst enables the conversion to methyl groups of intermediates over the Ga component, because of its hydrogen spillover property and the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon [21]. Additionally, we are expecting that the Ga component was impregnated between Ni and Mg/Zeolite Y in order to reduce the extent of catalytic deactivation caused by the strong sintering between Ni and Al support during ethanol steam reforming. The ethanol steam-reforming reactions were conducted in the temperature range of 200–800°C at intervals of 50°C. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) analyses."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts Four catalysts, Ni/Ga-loaded Mg/Zeolite Y batches with various Ga (wt.%) contents, were prepared by impregnation method, as shown in Fig. 1 . For Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y, 1.0g of Zeolite Y (0.8–1.5μm, 680m2 /g) was impregnated with magnesium chloride (MgCl2·6H2O, 30wt.% MgO, Junsei Co., Japan) in 25ml of ethanol. The slurry was stirred for 2h and evaporated at 50°C for 3h. Mg/Zeolite Y was calcined at 500°C for 3h in air, followed by impregnation with nickel nitrate (15wt.%, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Junsei Co., Japan). To the previously prepared Mg/Zeolite Y was added 10, 20, and 30wt.% of gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3, Junsei Co., Japan) by incipient wetness impregnation. After being impregnated with Ga, the sample was dried in ambient air, heated in flowing air at a rate of 10°C/min to 500°C, and then held isothermally at 500°C for at least 3h. Finally 10wt.% of nickel nitrate was impregnated over Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y to attain the Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y. The weight contents of the metal oxides were calculated versus 100wt.% of Zeolite Y. In preliminary experiments, Ga/Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y exhibited a hydrogen production of only 40% from ethanol steam reforming at 650°C. Thus, the Ga/Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts were omitted in this paper. The reduction of the four catalysts, Ni(10)/Ga(x)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y (x =0, 10, 20, 30), involved reducing with H2 at 700°C for 2h, followed by cooling to room temperature under argon gas."
3,Characterizations of Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts,"2.2 Characterizations of Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts The prepared catalysts were identified through powder XRD (MPD model, PANalytical, Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center, Korea) analysis with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (30kV, 30mA) at 2-theta angles of 5–100°. The scan speed was 10o/min and the time constant was 1s. The shapes and surface atomic compositions of the Ni/Ga/Mg/Mg/Zeolite Y particles were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; S-4100, Hitachi, Yeungnam University Instrumental Analysis Center, Korea)/energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS-EX-250, Horiba) operated at 120kV. The Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area was measured using a Micrometrics ASAP 2000 instrument. All of the catalysts were degassed before BET surface measurement. The degassing was carried out under vacuum at 120°C for 1h, after which the samples were thermally treated at 300°C for 30min. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen gas adsorption using a continuous flow method with a mixture of nitrogen and helium as the carrier gas. XPS measurements of Mg2p, Ni2p, Ga2p, Al2p, C1s, and O1s were recorded with a model AXIS-NOVA (Kratos Inc., Korea Basic Science Institute Jeonju Center, Korea) system, equipped with a non-monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6eV) X-ray source. The powders were pelletized at 1.2×104 kPa for 1min and the 1.0-mm pellets were then maintained overnight in a vacuum (1.0×10–7 Pa) to remove any water molecules from the surface prior to the measurement. The base pressure of the system was below 1×10–9 Pa. The experiments were conducted with a 200-W source power and an angular acceptance of ±5°. The analyzer axis made an angle of 90° with the specimen surface. A Shirley function was used to subtract the background in the XPS data analysis. The Mg2p, Ni2p, Ga2p, Al2p, C1s, and O1s signals were fitted using mixed Lorentzian–Gaussian curves. NH3–TPD measurements were carried out on a conventional TPD system using an N-1000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA; Scinco, Korea). To remove any water and impurities on the surface, 40mg of the catalysts were exposed to N2 gas at 500°C for 50min. After pretreatment, the samples were exposed to ammonia gas (1mol% ammonia diluted in helium gas) at 80°C for 30min, and heated to 600°C at a programmed heating rate of 10°C/min. The amount of desorbed gas was continuously monitored by the TGA N-1000 instrument. H2–TPR was conducted as follows. About 0.3g of the catalysts was pre-treated under helium flow (30ml/min) at 700°C for 2h and then cooled to room temperature. The analysis was carried out by flowing 30ml/min of H2 (10vol.%)/N2 and raising the temperature of the catalyst from room temperature to 700°C at 5°C/min. The change in the hydrogen concentration was measured with a gas chromatograph (GC series 580, GOW-MAC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In order to study the formation of carbon species on the catalyst surface, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was performed using the TGA N-1000 instrument by introducing high purity oxygen gas into the system after purging it with N2. A 7.0mg sample was placed in a sample pan and heated from 50 to 900°C at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min. The high purity O2 gas was flowed at 20–40mL/min into the TPO system for the combustion of the carbon accumulated on the catalyst after the reaction. The profiles were obtained in the same manner as that described for TPD, and the coke contents were calculated from the weight loss in the temperature range from 50 to 900°C. Calcium oxalate monohydrate was used as the reference."
4,Apparatus for ethanol steam-reforming reaction,"2.3 Apparatus for ethanol steam-reforming reaction Fig. 2 shows the reactor for the ethanol steam reforming, and the catalytic activities were measured in the temperature range for 200–800°C for 1h reaction time intervals at steam-to-ethanol ratios of 1:3 with gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 6740h−1. These conditions were optimized in a previous paper [22]. The catalyst (0.2g) was pelletized to 20–24 mesh and then packed with a small amount of quartz wool to prevent its movement in the fixed-bed quartz reactor, which was vertically mounted inside the furnace. First, all of the catalysts were reduced in situ under hydrogen (10ml/min) for 2h at 700°C prior to each run. An ethanol/water solution (mol/mol) was then introduced into the vaporizer. Typically, according to most articles [23–25], the ethanol and water were mixed at a desired weight percentage and vaporized at a boiling point temperature at once before the mixture was sent to the reactor. However, in this study, the amount of steam was adjusted by regulating the temperature, according to the following partial pressure law: ln P 1 / P 2 = - Δ H / R ( 1 / T 1 - 1 / T 2 ) Here P 1, P 2, T 1, T 2, ΔH, and R correspond to the pressure at 760mm Hg, the pressure at an arbitrary boiling point, the temperature (in Kelvin) at P 1, the temperature (in Kelvin) at P 2, the enthalpy, and the gas constant (8.3145kPadm3/molK), respectively. First, the enthalpy was obtained at all of the known two-point pressures, and then the pressure (P 1, mmHg) was calculated corresponding to the arbitrary volume (or mol)%. Finally, the temperature T 1 was determined. Based on this equation, ethanol and water were vaporized at 30°C and 36°C, respectively, for an ethanol to steam ratio of 1:3, which corresponded to 10vol.%/carrier gases. The vaporization temperatures were affected by the ethanol and steam concentrations. The flow rate was held constant at a rate of 10 and 30mL/min for both ethanol and steam. Argon gas was used to transport the vaporized mixture to the reactor. The reaction products were measured using on-line GC on a Donam DS6200 (Donam company, Korea) that was equipped with a TCD (Ed – this acronym has already been defined above) and a flame ionizing detector (FID). The TCD was used to detect H2, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CO, and CO2, and the FID to detect CH4, C2–C5 hydrocarbons, and other products. The ethanol conversion (XEtOH) and the selectivity of the C-containing products (SC) of the various samples were calculated using the following equations: X EtOH = ( mol EtOH in - mol EtOH out ) / mol EtOH in × 100 % SC H 2 = mol H 2 / [ ( mol EtOH in - mol EtOH out ) - ( mol H 2 O in - mol H 2 O out ) ] × 100 % SC others = mol others out / ( mol EtOH in - mol EtOH out ) × 100 % In this study, the GHSV was calculated based on the total flow rate of the feed mixture in the gas phase."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of the Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts,"3.1 Characteristics of the Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts The two catalysts, both pre-treated and untreated by H2 gas at 700°C before the reaction, were characterized by XRD. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3 . The special peaks of Zeolite Y, acting as the catalyst support, were observed at 2-theta angles of 32°, 23°, and 7° in all of the samples. Almost all of the diffraction lines of the NiO phase [26] at 2-theta angles of around 37°, 42°, 62°, and 75° Could be seen in the XRD patterns of all the catalysts, but the peaks were slightly split after the H2 reduction, which may have indicated the reduced phase of Ni. The peak assigned to MgO decreased with increasing loaded Ga concentration. The GaO peak at 35° [27,28] was seen except for Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y, and the peak intensity was increased by the H2 reduction. These results suggested that the oxidation states of the main metal components existed between the oxidized and reduced forms. Here, we examined the sintering phenomena from the FESEM images. The results showed no significant difference, but did reveal the dispersal of small metal particles on the surface of the Ga-added Zeolite Y catalyst. Therefore, the FESEM micrograph was omitted from this study. Table 1 summarizes the physical properties of the pure Zeolite Y and the four catalysts. The EDS analysis revealed variation in loaded metal concentrations, with the Ni and Ga surface concentrations being relatively higher and lower, respectively. For example, the atomic ratio of each metal component in Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y was 3.45/2.23/11.37. The surface areas and pore volumes were depressed by the Ga addition to the catalyst, which was attributed to the melting of the Ga particles at high temperature and their subsequent interference with the Mg and Zeolite Y pore space. The addition of Ga components during the ethanol steam-reforming reaction between the Ni and the support prevented abrupt sintering. However, the surface area was slightly improved in Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y, despite the higher Ga concentration, which may have been due to the wide distribution of the Ga components on the surface of the Zeolite Y and Mg particles. To determine the relation between the catalytic performance and the Brønsted acidic properties, the NH3–TPD profiles of the five catalysts were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4 . Solid catalytic materials possess many acid sites and certain acidic strengths that are attributed to their high Al contents and tetrahedral Al sites, respectively. A broad peak around 100–200°C, which is attributed in this study to the presence of Al in Zeolite Y. The reactions of ethanol reforming, ethanol oxidation by oxygen from the injected water, and reduction of carbon oxides in the former and of hydrocarbons by proton ions at the Brønsted acid sites all occur simultaneously. The latter reaction affects the absolute performance of the catalyst. Consequently, the number of acid sites and their strength are both important. In general, the NH3–TPD profiles of the porous catalysts consist of two peaks: one in the low temperature range of 150–250°C and the other in the high temperature range of 400–500°C. These low and high NH3-desorption peaks correspond to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively [29]. In Fig. 4, the three of the four catalysts, with the exception of pure Zeolite Y, had a weak peak at a low temperature around 120°C. The two significant points were the shift in the acid sites to low temperatures with the addition of the Ga component, and the greater acidity decrease in the Ga-loaded catalyst. This was attributed to the pores in Zeolite Y almost being closed by the metal presence, particularly by alkali metals such as Mg and Ga, so that the ammonia molecules could not infiltrate into the internal surface of the Zeolite Y. Ninety percent of acid sites are distributed on the internal surface of cavities in porous aluminosilicate particles like Zeolite. In our results, the ethanol-reforming reaction was further improved at low temperature and the activation point was shifted to a lower temperature in the Ga-loaded samples. The H2–TPR profiles of the four catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . Various changes corresponding to the reduction of the Ga2O3/GaO/Ga [21,30] and NiO/Ni [31,32] components were observed in the H2–TPR profiles. In general, the H2–TPR results indicated that: (1) the peak area corresponds to the hydrogen uptake and (2) the peak at high temperatures corresponds to the catalytic reaction involved in the reduction mechanism. A reduction type for the Ni component was seen in all catalysts at 750–820°C, which considered to NiO→Ni, respectively. The reduction peak of Ni oxides was gradually shifted to lower temperatures with increasing Ga content and the greatest reduction was observed in the case of Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y. Otherwise the reduced peaks of Ga2O3 to GaO and Ga0 were shown at around 650 and 860°C, respectively, and these were also slightly shifted to a lower temperature with increasing Ga addition."
7,Ethanol steam-reforming reaction over Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts,"3.2 Ethanol steam-reforming reaction over Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y and Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts Ethanol steam reforming was carried out with 0.5g of each of the four catalysts under the reaction conditions of temperature=200–800°C, GHSV=6740/h, and H2O/EtOH=3.0. Fig. 6 compares the time-on-stream activity of the four catalysts. In (B), in which only the ethanol conversion is compared, the conversion over the three Ga-loaded catalysts occurred at a lower temperature than that over the non-Ga-modified catalyst. The ethanol conversion was maximized over the Ni(10)/Ga(10)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst at above 90% over the whole temperature range. On the other hand, the hydrogen production gradually increased over Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y in the temperature range of 500–700°C to a maximum of 87% at 700°C. However, the peaks were shifted to the higher temperature of 750°C over the other catalysts. The hydrogen evolutions at 750°C were decreased with increasing Ga content. This may have been caused by the methanation of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide on the Ni, as reported in many papers [14–18]. Here the Ga-loaded catalysts provided a significantly higher reforming reactivity than the conventional Ni(10)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst. This suggested that the Ga particles prevented sintering between the Ni and the support, and was further attributed to a synergy effect between Ni and Ga. Fig. 7 shows the product distribution over the Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst that was obtained from ethanol steam reforming at 700°C after 1h. The product distributions are represented relative to 100% ethanol conversion. The reactions were conducted under conditions of EtOH:H2O=1:3 and GHSV=6740h−1. Six species were present in the product distribution: H2, CO2, CH4, C3H8, i-C4H10, and i-C5H12. As shown in this figure, the conversion of ethanol to hydrocarbons like C3–C5 prevailed over the hydrogen synthesis at the lower temperature of 200–350°C, and the reaction products were distributed according to the ratio of 74% i-C5H12 : 18% CH4 : 8% H2 at 300°C, compared to 68–78% CH4: 12–32% H2:10–0% CO2 at the medium temperature of 400–550°C. Finally, the synthesis of hydrogen from ethanol steam reforming prevailed over the hydrocarbon synthesis at the higher temperature of 600–800°C, and the reaction products were distributed in the ratio of 40–87% H2: 60–13% CH4. Most importantly, the CO selectivity was near to zero percent over the whole temperature range, and the CH4 production was slightly increased compared to that over the catalysts loaded only with Ni. The presence of CO degrades the active catalyst, due to catalyst poisoning by CO molecules [33]. Therefore, our results demonstrated the synergistic effect of the introduction of Ga between the Ni and the support on the catalytic performance and the decreased sintering phenomenon and consequent reduced catalytic deactivation."
8,Characteristics of catalysts after ethanol reforming,"3.3 Characteristics of catalysts after ethanol reforming Fig. 8 compares the XRD patterns of the four catalysts after 10h of reaction at 700°C. The Zeolite Y skeletal structure was not destroyed after the reaction. The diffraction lines of the Ni metal phase shown at 2-theta angles of 44° were clearly different after the reaction in all four catalysts, and the peaks assigned to Ni oxides were smaller relates to before reaction. This indicated that the Ni components acted as active sites in the ethanol steam-reforming reaction. The MgO peak decreased after the reaction, automatically implies a comparison with before the reaction except for the Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst. Additionally, the peaks of the Ga phases were rather sharper after the reaction. A strong peak at around 50° was also evident for carbon from the coke formation after reaction. Fig. 9 presents the typical survey and high-resolution spectra obtained from the quantitative XPS analyses of the four catalysts. The survey spectra of the particles contained the Mg2p, Ni2p, Ga2p, Al2p, C1s, and O1s peaks, which were analyzed based on an XPS handbook [34]. The Al2p3/2 spin–orbital photoelectron, which was assigned to the Al component in Zeolite Y, was located at a binding energy of 74.5eV. Generally, however, it was separated into two types at 64.50–65.20eV for 2p1/2 and 71.62–72.22eV for 2p3/2 at the maximum points before reaction. However, the peaks for the Al2p1/2 spin disappeared after the reaction. Additionally the binding energies for the Al2p1/2 spin were shifted higher and the peak widths were larger after the reaction for all four samples. The Δ values were decreased with increasing Ga content of 0–30wt.%. In general, a large binding energy indicates a more oxidized state [35]. The same phenomenon occurred for Mg2p (at 50.5eV for MgAl2O4), which was distributed at 47.80–49.20eV for the four samples and was assigned to Mg(OH)2. These results indicated that the Al and Mg ions were oxidized to higher oxidation states after the ethanol reforming and confirmed the involvement of the Al and Mg ions in the reduction of ethanol or other hydrocarbons that were evolved during the ethanol-reforming reaction to afford the production of H2 or hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the Ga2p region in the spectra of Ga oxide was decomposed into two contributions, which were assigned to Ga2p3/2 and Ga2p1/2 at 1115.81 (for Ga metal)–1117.08 (for Ga2O3) and 1142.3–1144.8eV, respectively [34]. The Ga components were transferred to the more oxidized form of Ga2O3 after reaction, and the Δ values were larger after the reaction in all samples. Generally, the same phenomenon occurred for Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 at binding energies of 853.8 and 871.29eV, which were assigned to NiO [34]. In this study, Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 were expressed at 852.15 (for Ni metal)–853.67 (for NiO) and 870.08–872.00eV, respectively, in both samples before and after reaction. However, the peak intensities were largely decreased with no change of peak position after reaction. This means that Ni components were strong played as a catalyst to the ethanol steam reforming and then deactivated. On the other hand, the O1s region of the metal oxides [34] was observed at 529.2–529.50eV in all samples, but the peaks were largely shifted to higher binding energies (for metal-OH) for three of the catalysts, with the exception of Ni(10)/Ga(20)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y. These results indicated that the Ga ions were oxidized after the ethanol reforming and, consequently, confirmed that the Ga ions were involved in the reduction of ethanol or other hydrocarbons that were evolved during the ethanol-reforming reaction to afford the production of CH4 from CO or CO2 molecules. To determine the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts, we carried out TPO measurement (A) and C1s XPS analysis (B), as shown in Fig. 10 . The deposited amount (peak area) and species of carbons (decomposed temperature) are closely related to the catalytic deactivation. Generally, the extent of catalytic deactivation is reduced when a smaller amount of carbon is deposited. When the Ni-only component was exposed to the outside surface of the Mg(30)/Zeolite Y sample, the deposited carbons underwent greater oxidation at high temperatures compared to the sample with the Ga component, indicating the deposition of heavy carbons. The amounts of carbon were similarly deposited in the Ni(10)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y and Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalysts, but the peak position was shifted to a lower temperature in the latter. We therefore concluded that the Ga addition helped to retain the stability of the Ni crystallites and avoided their conglomeration in the ethanol steam-reforming reaction, which corresponds to the better stability demonstrated by the Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts compared with Ni/Mg/Zeolite Y. On the other hand, although one C1s orbital is generally seen at 284.5eV for bulky carbons [34], the peak in this study could be split into three peaks at around 281, 282, and 283eV, due to the mixture of carbide and carbon species in the coke deposition over the catalyst. Except for Ni(10)/Ga(10)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y, the carbon deposited patterns were similar, and these data were in agreement with the TPO profiles."
9,Investigation of the catalytic lifetime of Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y,"3.4 Investigation of the catalytic lifetime of Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y Finally, the catalytic deactivation was tested for the Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst, and the results are shown in Fig. 11 . In a dramatic result, the H2 production exceeded 80% mol with 100% ethanol conversion depending on the presence of Ga. This result is very significant compared with the H2 production of 70% at 600°C when Pd component of high cost was used in previously reported [21]. The catalyst lifetime was greatly improved in the Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y catalyst compared to that of the catalyst without Ga. The catalytic deactivation was retarded till 59h over the former, in contrast to the rapid deactivation over the latter, indicating that the initial catalyst deactivation may have resulted from a combination of steam-induced nickel sintering and carbon deposition. However, the apparent deactivation rate was far lower for the Ga-promoted catalyst and its higher ethanol conversion was maintained for up to 59h. After 60h, the used catalyst was very black, and was very tense. XRD peaks of the Carbon and Ni metal were too enlarged; otherwise the other peaks which assigned to metal or metal oxides species were very small compared to the peak strength of the peaks, respectively. However zeolite structure did not collapse, however, probably the catalyst surface was covered by the carbon coke species, and resulted that the active metal and metal oxide peaks that look like seem to have disappeared. Thus, the improved stability at the slower deactivation rate achieved with the Ni/Ga sample could not be unequivocally attributed to carbon formation."
10,Conclusion,"The two key study findings are the effects of the Ga presence on the variation in H2 production and on the retardation of the catalytic deactivation. On the basis of the performance results and a variety of physical measurements, we proposed that the Ni components played a role in the oxidation of the feed gases during ethanol reforming, otherwise during ethanol reforming, which allowed the Ga component to be used to synthesize CH4 from the reduction of CO and CO2. The simultaneous addition of Ni/Ga may have depressed the sintering between the Ni and the support, and retarded catalytic deactivation. Consequently, their synergistic effect increased the ethanol conversion and H2 production over the Ni/Ga/Mg/Zeolite Y catalysts to 100% and 87%, respectively, over Ni(10)/Ga(30)/Mg(30)/Zeolite Y. This high performance was maintained for up to 59h. The operation conditions, as identified by a parametric study, were a reaction temperature of 700°C, GHSV of 6740h−1, and feed ratio of ethanol: H2O of 1:3."
