0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols, usually referring to oxygenates containing two or more carbon numbers, have a wide application as gasoline additives, fuels, intermediates for pharmaceuticals synthesis and commodity products synthesis [1,2]. Compared with other synthesis routes including olefins hydroformylation and methanol homologation, direct production of higher alcohols from syngas has attracted more and more attentions due to its simplified operation and low energy consumption [2]. However, challenges still exist for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from syngas due to the low activity and low oxygenates selectivity. Generally, there are four major types of catalysts for HAS from syngas: Rh-based catalysts, Mo-based catalysts, modified methanol synthesis catalysts and modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts. Although Rh-based catalysts exhibit high selectivity to C2+ oxygenates (especially ethanol), the expensive cost and scarcity for Rh metal make it difficult to realize industrialization [3–5]. Mo-based catalysts have high tolerance to sulfur but the catalytic activity is rather low and high reaction temperature is needed [6,7]. For modified methanol synthesis catalysts, large amount of methanol and hydrocarbons are always generated as byproducts [8–11]. Among them, modified FTS catalysts have attracted extensive attention owing to its relatively high selectivity to alcohols at mild reaction conditions with low cost [12–15]. The Cu-modified FTS catalysts including CuCo-based and CuFe-based are always used as modified FTS catalysts for HAS, and the Cu component is common regarded as an active site for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion, while the FT component is responsible for CO dissociative adsorption and chain growth [1,2,16–19]. For CuCo-based catalysts, the enrichment of Cu on the catalyst surface is usually unavoidable and would block the metallic Co active sites during reaction process, resulting in a rapid deactivation for CuCo-based catalysts [12,20–22]. The CuFe-based catalysts possess the advantages including cheap cost and high catalytic activity [17,23,24]. However, high activity for water-gas shift (WGS) was typically found for CuFe-based catalysts, leading to the excessive production of CO2 [22,25–27]. In addition, phase separation between Cu and iron carbide may happen during reaction process and thus hinder the formation of alcohols [24,28]. It is desirable to fabricate another type of site instead of Cu for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion. A lot of recent studies strongly revealed that the formation of Co2C could promote alcohols formation and can function for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion [29–31] in spite of the fact that cobalt carbide (Co2C) will lead to catalytic deactivation for Co-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction [32,33]. For example, Pei et al. reported that the formation of Co-Co2C interface is highly efficient for oxygenation production over a Co/AC catalyst by combining DFT theory calculation [31]. Xiang et al. found that the oxygenates selectivity can reach about 50 wt% for CoMnK catalysts [30]. They claimed that the synergistic effect between Mn5O8 and Co2C was responsible for the high oxygenates selectivity. Zhao et al. introduced Mn and La promoter to Co/AC (active carbon) systems by impregnation method, and found that the Mn or La promoter could promote the formation of Co2C, resulting in high oxygenates selectivity [34,35]. HAS for modified FTS catalysts generally requires synergistic effect of dual active sites. The balance between function for CO dissociative adsorption and CC coupling and function for CO non-dissociation adsorption and CO insertion play a vital role in promoting oxygenates formation [2]. Under the HAS conditions, the formation of olefins, paraffins and oxygenates as well as CO2 are competitive. Meanwhile, theoretical calculation indicated that the energy barrier of CO insertion was higher than hydrogenation [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the intimacy between dual sites and achieve an appropriate ratio between the two active sites during catalysts design [2]. A recent work from Luk et al. [16] suggested that the CO2 can effectively boost the vicinity of Cu and Fe, and the CO insertion into growing hydrocarbon chains will thus prevail on hydrogenation. Li et al. [17] reported that a high degree of Cu-Fe5C2 interface can be obtained by changing ratio of Cu and Fe over CuFeMn-layered double hydroxide catalysts, which greatly favor the production of long chain alcohols. Prieto et al. investigated the influence of Cu/(Cu + Co) atomic ratio on the product selectivity and found that a Cu/(Cu + Co) atomic ratio of 3.5 with a surface of Co enrichment was suitable for oxygenates synthesis based on theoretical calculation [36]. The experiment results also confirmed that the time yield of alcohols reached the highest at this atomic ratio. These studies strongly indicated that the ratio of dual active sites is a key factor for regulation of product distribution. However, there are still lack of systematic study about the synergic behavior of the Co0/Co2C dual active sites for HAS. In addition, numerous works indicated that the AC is an excellent support for promoting the formation of Co2C and enhancing the production of oxygenates compared with metal oxides support [37,38]. We herein chose AC as support and aimed to study the effect of Co0/Co2C ratio on catalytic performance in HAS. The Co0/Co2C ratio was controlled by tuning the content of Na additive based on Na-Co/AC catalytic systems. The catalytic activity and product selectivity were investigated in detail for the catalysts with different Co0/Co2C ratio. The synergism effect and structure-performance relationship of Co0/Co2C dual active sites were also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The xNa-Co/AC catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method with active carbon (AC) as support. Before impregnation, the active carbon support was first dealt with 50 % HNO3 and washed using deionized water for several times, and then dried at 120 °C for 12 h in vacuum oven. Typically, 6.96 g of AC was impregnated with 6.76 mL mixed aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and NaNO3 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The weight loading of Co was fixed at 20 % with respect to the sum of Co, Na and active carbon support. The loading of Na was fixed at 0%, 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.4 %, 0.6 % or 1%, which can accelerate the carburization rate of Co to Co2C and promote the formation of Co2C according to previous works [39–41]. After impregnation, the samples were dried at room temperature for 8 h, and then dried at 120 °C for 24 h in vacuum oven. Finally, the samples were calcined at 350 °C in N2 atmosphere for 4 h."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Nitrogen adsorption experiments were performed to study the pore structure of xNa-Co/AC catalysts on a Micromeritics 2420 instrument. About 150 mg of calcinated catalyst was degassed at 300 °C for 6 h before the test. The special surface area (SBET) of catalysts was determined by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm studies, and calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume and the pore size were calculated by using nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) analysis method. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out to study the reduction behavior of xNa-Co/AC catalysts with a Micromeritics Autochem-II 2920 instrument. Before reduction, about 50 mg of sample was first dealt with a He flow at 200 °C for 2 h, and then the temperature dropped to 60 °C under He flow. Finally, the temperature was raised from 60 °C to 800 °C with rate of 10 °C/min under a 10 % H2/Ar flow, and the signal was recorded by TCD. Temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem-II 2920 instrument. Typically, about 50 mg catalyst was first treated with 30 mL/min of He flow at 200 °C for 2 h, and then the temperature was dropped to 50 °C. Subsequently, a flow of CO2 with 30 mL/min was introduced to the system for 2 h. After full adsorption, the system was purged with He flow for 30 min. Finally, the temperature was raised to 400 °C with 10 °C/min, and the signal was recorded by TCD. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα source. The experiments of calcinated and spent catalysts were carried out in the range of 20−70° with a scanning speed of 2°/min. In this work, the relative content of Co species for spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts was calculated according to the RIR method. Typically, the strongest peaks of each phase were first chosen from the XRD patterns. Then the chosen peaks intensities were integrated after fitting, and the obtained integrated intensities of x phase was denoted as Ix . From the Eq. (1), the weight percentage of each phase was calculated as follows: (1) W x = I x R I R x ∑ i = 1 N I i R I R i × 100 % The RIR values were obtained from the JCPDS standard cards. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained from a JEOL JEM 2011 electron microscope equipped with a 200 kV accelerating voltage. For samples preparation, the powder was first dispersed in ethanol and then dealt with ultrasonication for 2 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with an Al Kα source. The XPS spectra were analyzed through the Advantage software. Before fitting, all the spectra were corrected according to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic test was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with 8 mm inner diameter. 1.0 g of 40–60 mesh calcinated catalysts were diluted with 3.0 g silica of the same mesh. The catalysts were firstly in situ reduced at 400 °C in flowing H2 with a WHSV of 8000 mL g−1 h-1 for 5 h. After reduction, the temperature was dropped to 120 °C. Then the syngas (H2/CO = 2, v/v) was introduced to the reactor. After the pressure was increased to 30 bar, the reactor temperature was increased into 220 °C at an average heating ramp of 2 °C/h with a WHSV of 2000 mL g−1 h-1. The outlet gas was on-line analyzed by Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph after transiting the cold trap (0 °C) and hot trap (120 °C). The liquid products including oil and aqueous solution were off-line analyzed by Shimadzu GC2010 plus after separation. The wax products were dissolved with CS2 before GC analysis. All the data was determined after 24 h of reaction when the reaction condition was reached. The CO conversion and product selectivity were calculated by the following equations: (2) C O c o n v e r s i o n = n C O , i n l e t - n C O , o u t l e t n C O , i n l e t × 100 % (3) S C O 2 = n C O 2 n C O , i n l e t - n C O , o u t l e t × 100 % (4) S i = N i × n i ∑ ( N i × n i ) × 100 % The CO conversion was calculated by the Eq. (2), where the nCO,inlet and nCO,outlet denote the moles of CO at the inlet and outlet. The selectivity of individual product Si was determined by the Eq. (4), where the Ni and ni denotes the moles and C number of product i, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure characterization,"3.1 Structure characterization 3.1.1 Textural properties Textural properties were investigated for the calcined xNa-Co/AC catalysts and presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1. As shown in Fig. S1a, type I isothermal curve and type H4 hysteresis loop indicated that the calcined samples belonged to microporous structure [42]. Combined with pore size distributions (Fig. S1b), it was clear that the samples channels mainly composed of two types of micropores. As shown in Table S1, both the SBET and pore volume of the calcined catalysts increased with the addition of Na. Simultaneously, the addition of Na slightly decreased the most probable pore size of catalysts (Fig. S1b), while the mean pore diameter almost did not change. These variation tendencies, however, were not consistent with the previous reports [41,43]. The reason may be that NaNO3 was employing as the precursor of sodium additive in this work. The decomposition of NaNO3 at high temperature during calcination process could lead to the partly collapse of supports pore channels. Therefore, new smaller pores were formed, resulting in the increase of special surface area and pore volume. The textural properties of spent xNa-Co/AC were also measured as showed in Fig. S2 and Table S2. The isothermal curve of spent catalysts was still similar to that of the fresh catalysts with slight decrease of adsorption quantity. The Table S2 showed that both SBET and pore volume significantly decreased after reaction for all of the catalysts due to the aggregation of nanoparticles during the reaction process, in agreement with the literature [40]. In addition, the surface basicity of various catalysts was characterized by CO2-TPD as showed in Fig. S3. It was found that CO2 adsorption amount increased with the increase of Na concentration, suggesting that the surface basicity increased with Na content. 3.1.2 XRD The XRD patterns of xNa-Co/AC catalysts, which were calcined at 400 °C under N2 flow, are showed in Fig. 1 a. It is clear that both Co3O4 (PDF#No.80-1536) and CoO (PDF#No.75-0418) phases were observed, similar to that reported from literatures [34,44]. No diffraction peaks ascribed to Na species were found in the XRD patterns. We speculated that the minor amount of Na was highly dispersed over the catalyst and cannot be measured by XRD diffractometer. After the HAS reaction, only crystallite Co0 and Co2C phases for Co species were observed by XRD (Fig. 1b) for all of the studied catalysts. The characteristic peaks of FCC Co (PDF#No.01-089-4307) located at 2 θ of 44.2°, and Co2C phase (PDF#No.72-1369) located at 2 θ of 37.0°, 40.5°, 41.3°, 42.6°, 45.7°, 46.3°, 56.7°, 64.3° were observed. The relative content of Co species for spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts was calculated from Co2C(111) and Co0(111) according to the RIR method and the relative content ratio of Co0/Co2C were also calculated. As shown in Table 1 , the ratio of Co0/Co2C consistently decreased with the addition of Na promoter. When the Na loading reached 1 wt%, the Co species in the system are almost in the form of Co2C phase, resulting in the lowest Co0/Co2C ratio. These results were consistent with the previous reports that the Na additive could promote the formation of Co2C [39–41]. It is obvious that we can adjust the Co0/Co2C ratio of the catalyst by changing the amount of Na promoter. In order to facilitate the discussion of the relationship between catalysts performance and the Co0/Co2C ratio in Section 3.2, the Na loading was correlated with the Co0/Co2C ratio after the reaction as shown in Table 1. 3.1.3 H2-TPR H2-TPR experiments were performed to study the reducibility of calcined xNa-Co/AC catalysts as shown in Fig. 2 . There were three main peaks observed for all catalysts around 205 °C, 295 °C, 447 °C. According to the literatures [39,44], the first peak around 205 °C involved the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, and the second peak around 295 °C was attributed to the reduction of CoO to Co0. The last reduction peak around 447 °C may be contributed to the removing of organic groups on the AC [44]. In addition, when the Na loading was less than 0.6 wt%, the reduction temperature almost did not change with the increasing Na content. However, the reduction behavior was slightly suppressed when the Na loading reached 1 wt%. 3.1.4 TEM The TEM characterization was carried out to study the morphology of the spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S4, Co2C nanoparticles were observed in all spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts. When the Na loading was lower than 1 wt%, there were two phases of Co0 and Co2C in the samples (Fig. 3a–e). The Co species of the spent catalyst mainly existed in the form of Co2C phase with higher Na loading and it was difficult to find the Co0 nanoparticles for the spent 1Na-Co/AC catalyst (Fig. 3f). These observations were consistent with the XRD results. In addition, as seen from the HRTEM images, a clear boundary between Co and Co2C was observed for the spent catalysts, which was significant for HAS [31]. 3.1.5 XPS The valence state of surface Co element of various spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts were obtained from the XPS experiment as shown in Fig. 4 . The XPS spectra of Co2p were compiled for the spent xNa-Co/AC catalysts. The binding energy of 777.9 eV was associated with Co0, while 781.1 eV was attributed to Coδ+ (Co2+ or Co3+) [44]. It can be clearly observed the area of Co2p 3/2 peak for Co0 gradually decreased with the increase of Na loading. The relative surface atomic content of the Co species and the atom ratios of different Co valence states were also listed in Table 2 . Clearly, both of the relative surface atomic content of the Co0 and the surface ratio of Co0/Coδ+ ratio decreased with the increase of Na amount."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The xNa-Co/AC catalysts were evaluated at the conditions of 220 °C, 30 bar and a space velocity of 2000 mL· g−1 · h−1. The effect of Na loading on the activity and selectivity of AC supported catalysts was summarized in Table 3 and Fig. S5. It was found that CO conversion over the xNa-Co/AC catalysts gradually decreased with increasing loading of Na. With the addition of Na, the metallic Co was partly transformed to Co2C via carburization at the initial reaction stage. As a result, the introduction of Na decreased the numbers of Co0 active sites and led to a decreased activity. Catalytic performance as a function of time-on-stream for 0.4Na/Co-AC was showed in Fig. S6. It was found that the catalytic performance changed significantly once syngas was introduced into the reaction system. After 48 h of reaction, the catalytic reactivity tended to remain stable, suggesting that the active sites almost kept unchanged. We further compare the oxygenates selectivity, and found it increased firstly and then decreased with further increasing the amount of Na. The oxygenates selectivity reached the maximum of 35.1 % for the sample with 0.6 wt% of Na loading. Note that Xiang et al. observed that the addition of the K promoter could enhance the oxygenates selectivity for the CoMn catalysts in HAS reaction [30]. Our previous studies also found that the Na additive in the CoMn [39] and Co/SiO2 catalysts [41] showed similar promotion effect for oxygenates. The catalytic performance of various Co-based catalysts involved Co2C active site was compared and showed in Table S3. It can be found that the 0.1Na-Co/AC sample was superior to most reported results in terms of the yield of oxygenates. As for the hydrocarbons, the olefin selectivity was improved, whereas the paraffin selectivity decreased with increasing Na loading. Harris et al. reported that the basic metals could donate electrons to the transition metals on the surface [45]. This would increase the reaction barrier for H2 activation at the surface. Therefore, the electron donation via Na additive probably inhibited H2 adsorption at the surface of catalysts. Many studies indicated that alkali metals could enhance the CO adsorption on the catalyst surface [46,47]. The enhanced CO adsorption and inhibited H2 adsorption resulted in a higher C/H ratio on the catalysts surface. As a result, the surface with rich C species and deficient H species was beneficial for the formation of olefins. In addition, the generation of methane was restrained while CO2 selectivity slightly increased with the addition of Na. This result indicated that the activity of water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was enhanced. It was mainly ascribed to the existence of Co2C, which showed high WGS activity under the reaction conditions [32]. In order to further understand the synergetic behavior of the Co0/Co2C dual active sites, we established the relationship between the Co0/Co2C ratio and catalytic performance. The Co0/Co2C ratio was calculated from the XRD results by RIR method. The correlation curve of the catalyst activity and product selectivity with the Co0/Co2C ratio were shown in Fig. 5 . As for the activity, it was clear that the catalytic activity steadily increased as increasing Co0/Co2C ratio (Fig. 5a). This is because the Co0 exhibited lower CO activation energy barrier than Co2C [48]. When the Co0/Co2C ratio was large, the content of Co0 in the system was higher and the content of Co2C was relatively lower, resulting in higher CO conversion. With respect to the product selectivity, it can be seen that the correlation curve between the oxygenates selectivity and the Co0/Co2C ratio showed a volcano trend shape. The oxygenates selectivity increased firstly with the increase of Co0/Co2C ratio. However, the further increase of Co0/Co2C ratio led to the decrease of oxygenates selectivity. The detailed ASF distribution of oxygenates and hydrocarbons was also plotted and compared, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Both of the oxygenates and hydrocarbons followed the classical liner distribution. As a whole, the chain growth factor (α) for oxygenates decreased with the decrease of the Co0/Co2C ratio, while the chain growth factor of hydrocarbons seems to remain unchanged."
8,Mechanism discussion,"3.3 Mechanism discussion Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a very complicated catalytic reaction process with co-production of paraffins, olefins, alcohols and other products. CHx* species are generated via CO dissociative adsorption. The formed surface alkyls from chain growth of CHx* are terminated to form olefins via dehydrogenation or paraffins via hydrogenation. In addition, higher alcohols can be obtained via CO insertion into the surface alkyls. According to theoretical calculations, the energy barrier of CO insertion was much higher than that of CHx* hydrogenation [2], resulting in a great challenge for alcohols formation with high selectivity. It was well known that synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas usually required both strong CO dissociation adsorption and strong CO non-dissociation adsorption for CO insertion. For the Co0/Co2C dual active sites (Scheme 1 ), Co0 and Co2C showed strong CO dissociation adsorption and strong CO non-dissociation adsorption, respectively. As oxygenates were mainly formed on the contact boundaries between Co0/Co2C dual active sites, the content of contact boundaries will determine the oxygenates selectivity. When the Co0/Co2C ratio was particularly low, Co2C was the main Co species in the system. When the Co0/Co2C ratio was particularly large, the Co species existed mainly in form of Co0. For the above two cases, poor contact boundaries between Co0/Co2C dual active sites can be predicated, and the balance between CO dissociation adsorption ability and CO non-dissociation adsorption ability are greatly limited, leading to low selectivity to oxygenates. When the Co0/Co2C ratio was in a suitable range, a strong synergistic effect and rich contact boundaries between Co0/Co2C dual active sites can be reasonably obtained. The CO insertion rate was thus promoted, while the chain-growth and hydrogenation properties was hindered to some extent. The match between CO dissociation adsorption and CO non-dissociation adsorption ability favored the production of oxygenates and increased the corresponding selectivity."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, we controlled the Co0/Co2C ratio through altering the Na loading amount and studied the effect of Co0/Co2C ratio on the catalytic performance for HAS. The results showed that the Co0/Co2C ratio decreased with increasing Na loading, and there was a positive correlation between the catalyst activity and the Co0/Co2C ratio. As the ratio of Co0/Co2C increased, the catalytic activity increased gradually, while the oxygenates selectivity exhibited a volcano trend. At Co0/Co2C ratio of 8.1(x10−2), a maximum selectivity to oxygenates (35.1 C%) was obtained with CO conversion of 12.8 %. Characterization results suggested that the Co and Co2C co-existed in the spent samples and constituted the dual active sites for HAS. The Na promoter can be used to tune and obtain the optimum ratio of Co/Co2C, thus creating a local environmental with relative rich contact boundaries. Therefore, the CO insertion rate is strengthened and could be comparable to hydrogenation rate and the chain growth rate. The strong synergistic effect of Co0/Co2C finally benefits the enhancement of oxygenates selectivity."
