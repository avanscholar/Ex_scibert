0,Introduction,"At present, fossil fuels are the main source of energy worldwide. However, the burning of fossil fuels generates large amounts of greenhouse gases and causes environmental problems, such as global warming and climate changes [1]. The shortage of energy resources is considered to be a significant problem, and it is generally agreed that fossil fuels will be in short supply within the next decades. Reducing the dependence of fossil fuels as energy sources and increasing the use of alternative energy sources have become urgent global concerns. H2 is considered to be one of the most forward-looking energy sources because it is environmentally friendly and its use generates almost no pollutants [2,3]. Even though most H2 is currently produced via the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons, processes that use wastes as raw material for the production of H2 are more attractive because of their promising economic and environmental benefits [4–6]. Waste plastics account for 20–30 % of the total global waste, and their amount increases every year [1]. In addition, waste plastics are not easily biodegradable, and their improper handling could cause environmental pollution and ecological damage. According to the statistics reported by Plastics Europe [7], the amount of global plastic produced in 2017 reached 348 million metric tons, and Asia, which produced 50.1 % of the total quantity of plastic, was the largest contributor. Plastics mainly comprise hydrocarbons, and thus, waste plastics could be converted into high value-added chemicals, such as H2, CH4, CO, and CO2, via thermal conversion. Among the thermochemical conversion processes, gasification is considered to be one of the most promising transformation methods. The syngas generated via the gasification of waste plastics could be used as fuel for direct combustion to generate heat or power. Therefore, syngas could represent a renewable energy source and gasification could solve the waste plastics disposal problems [8–10]. The choice of reactor type plays an important role in the gasification of waste plastics. Several types of reactors, such as fixed, spouted, and fluidized bed reactors have been tested for the gasification of waste plastics. According to Lopez et al. [11], the selection of different reactors for plastic gasification could result in several advantages, including high heat transfer efficiency, provide appropriate residence time for tar cracking, and facilitate good interaction between catalyst and plastics. The wide usage of fixed bed reactors is related to their low cost and convenience of operation; however, these reactors present drawbacks, namely poor heat transfer, limited gas-solid contact, and scaling up difficulties [12–14]. The advantages of fluidized bed reactors include their uniform bed temperature, high heat transfer, and mass transfer efficiency. In addition, the fluidized bed heat treatment is a current research trend, and countries worldwide are planning to gradually implement the use of fluidized bed incinerators to treat waste [15–18]. When using two-stage fluidized bed reactors, different catalysts could be added during each step, and the operating conditions could be changed and optimized [19]. However, the catalysts used in fluidized bed reactors could easily become spent during the fluidization process, the catalyst particle size needs to be controlled, and the direct contact of the catalyst with the reactants facilitates the deposition of C on the catalyst and catalyst sintering. Therefore, the development of suitable catalysts for fluidized bed reactors is key for the fluidized bed thermal cracking technology [20–22]. To date, many research groups have reported the decomposition of the catalysts used for H2 production [23–25]. In industry, the most commonly used catalysts for the recombination of H2 are Ni-based, because Ni is less expensive than precious metals and presents high catalytic activity and selectivity, which are comparable to those of precious metals. However, Ni-based catalysts present shortcomings, as follows. Ni is prone to sintering; moreover, carbon deposits on these catalysts during reactions, it coats the active phase, and thus, it deactivates the catalysts, and clogs the reactors [26,27]. Therefore, inhibiting Ni sintering and hindering carbon deposition are key for improving catalyst activity and stability. The most common methods to prevent carbon deposition involve the addition of alkaline or alkaline earth metal oxides to catalysts as modifiers [28,29]. Studies have revealed that the use of metal oxides with high oxygen storage capacity could enhance the dispersion of Ni and participate in the oxidation of the surface carbon, which would reduce the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts [30]. Ceria (CeO2) is often used for catalytic reactions to form oxygen vacancies or provide lattice oxygen by changing the valence state of Ce between Ce3+ and Ce4+, and thus, it has good redox capability [31–33]. However, CeO2 could affect the redox capacity and could be sintered at high temperatures owing to its poor thermal stability, and therefore, it would be necessary to improve the thermal stability of the catalysts and reduce their surface acidity using ZrO2 doping to reduce the formation of carbon [34,35]. To maximize the H2 yield of syngas, it is very important to synthesize highly active, low cost, and coking-resistant catalysts that could be used for the production of H2 in fluidized bed reactors. Recently, core–shell catalysts have been considered to be forward-looking catalysts, owing to their high structural variability and high flexibility. In addition to solving the metal sintering problem, the core-shell catalyst also has a significant effect on the resistance to carbon deposition under high temperature conditions [36]. The excellent performance of the SiO2–CeO2 sandwiched Ni core–shell catalyst was attributed to its excellent coking resistance owing to the confinement effect and redox capacity of the CeO2 shell. Lucchini et al. [37] studied and compared the difference between Ni nanoparticles and Ni@SiO2 core-shell catalysts. From the results, it is known that the core-shell structure has the ability to resist sintering and carbon deposition, and the limited effect of the shell is effective for carbon deposition on the surface of the active phase and prevents the deactivation of the catalyst. To date, most researchers have used traditional supported Ni-based catalysts to produce H2 from waste plastics. The deactivation of the supported catalyst was determined to be caused by metal sintering and carbon deposition, which are responsible for the poor stability of the catalyst and blockage of the reactor. Compared to conventional porous catalysts, core–shell ones present several advantages, namely low internal diffusion resistance, strong materialized bonding force, and high specific surface area. In our previous work [38], we reported on the fabrication of core-shell structured catalyst and its performance on coking resistance and hydrogen production in a batch reactor. In this research, taking advantage of the high stability and activity of the core-shell catalyst, it is further applied to a pilot-scale fluidized bed with a continuous feed of plastic waste. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the use of core-shell catalysts for the decomposition of plastic in fluidized bed reactors. Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts with different shell thicknesses were synthesized, and were subsequently tested for the catalytic decomposition of waste plastics in a fluidized bed reactor. In addition, the Ni@CeO2 core-shell and supported Ni/CeO2 catalysts were also tested to evaluate their long-term stability for H2 production, and the effect of different equivalence ratios (ERs) was also investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of Ni@CeO2 catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni@CeO2 catalysts In this study, the Ni@CeO2 core–shell catalysts were prepared as follows. First, 0.1 g Ni nanoparticles were dispersed in 40 mL deionized water. Subsequently, 5 mL (0.5 mmol) cerium nitrate aqueous solution and 5 mL (0.5 mmol) hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) aqueous solution were added to the dispersion, and the mixture was magnetically stirred at 95 °C and 300 rpm for 2 h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, and washed four times with alcohol. Afterward, the washed solid was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C to obtain the Ni@CeOOH catalyst. The next day, the Ni@CeOOH catalyst was ground into powder and the powder was heated to 600 °C for 2 h (temperature ramp of 5 °C/min) to obtain the Ni@CeO2 catalyst. Lastly, the Ni@CeO2 catalyst was added to 40 mL NaOH (2 M aqueous solution) for etching. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, centrifuged, washed with alcohol four times, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C. Different amounts of cerium nitrate, namely 0.5, 1, and 2 mmol, and corresponding amounts of HMT were used to synthesize Ni@CeO2 catalysts, and the obtained catalysts were denoted Ni@CeO2-0.5, Ni@CeO2-1, and Ni@CeO2-2, respectively. For comparison, supported Ni/CeO2 was synthesized via aqueous incipient wetness impregnation."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts A JEM-2100 (JEOL) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) instrument that used a high voltage electron beam of 120 keV to penetrate the samples was used to analyze the size, internal structure, and morphology of the catalysts. When the electron beam of the TEM instrument penetrates the sample, it is affected by the atoms of the sample, and the atomic arrangement could be observed at different magnifications. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the crystal phase, grain size, structure, and crystallinity in materials science. In this study, the crystal structure of the Ni@CeO2 catalysts was analyzed using XRD with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154 nm); the diffraction angle ranged from 10° to 80° and the diffraction rate was 2°/min. XRD analysis could also be used to measure the grain size of nanomaterials, their crystal phase structure, and to identify the presence of different elements. The phase structure ratio of nanomaterials could affect the C production performance of catalysts. Furthermore, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is related to the phase content of powder materials, and therefore, the crystal phase ratio of the Ni@CeO2 catalysts could be determined using XRD analysis. In the temperature-programmed reduction step used in this research, first, in order to avoid the interference of water vapor in the analysis of the instrument, pre-processing will be carried out. The catalyst sample of 0.1 g is taken into the U-shaped tube, and Ar gas is first introduced and held at 100 °C. After 1 h, when the analysis signal of the instrument is stable, the reducing gas 10 % H2 is introduced, and Ar gas is used as the carrier gas, the total flow is 30 mL/min, and the temperature is programmed to reduce in the temperature range of 100–800 °C. The thermal conductivity detector analyzes the hydrogen consumption before and after the reduction, and finally obtains the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction spectrum, which can compare the effect of the difference in the bonding force between different samples on the catalyst activity. The deposition of carbon on the used catalysts was measured using an STA 6000 (PerkinElmer) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instrument. Samples of 10 mg were placed in a white Au crucible and were heated to 850 °C (temperature ramp of 30 °C/min) (20 mL/min) environment, and different weight losses were recorded for different temperature ranges. We can identify carbon material species and determine the carbon quality and carbon production."
4,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.3 Experimental apparatus and procedure A two-stage fluidized bed system (Fig. 1 ) was used for the catalytic production of H2 from waste polyethylene (PE). The equipment included a primary chamber fluidized bed, feed system, gas cleaning system, and secondary chamber catalyst reaction bed. The PE waste (2−3 mm virgin pellets) was obtained from Formosa Chemical and Formosa Chemicals and Fibre Corporation. The ultimate elemental and proximate analysis results are presented in Table 1 . The catalyst was mixed with the silica sand (silica sand: catalyst = 32:1). During the gasification process, all the stainless steel tubes were heated by the heater or the heating tape to prevent the gasification vapors from condensing. When the system detected the approximate target temperature (700 °C), the feedstock materials were continuously fed into the reactor through a hopper, and the feeding rate was adjusted according to the design ER ratio of 0.1∼0.3. Input air was provided by the blower at normal conditions and was used as the gasifying agent at a flow rate of 20 L/min. After the reaction, the gas was filtered to remove impurities, and was subjected to gas chromatography analysis. The H2 production rate and yield were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2), and the carbon production rate was calculated using Eq. (3).The furnace body of the primary chamber fluidized bed was approximately 670 mm long, and its furnace tube was made of 3 mm thick stainless steel (AISI 316SS). The inner diameter of the furnace tube was approximately 60 mm, and it is matched with the dispersion plate of stainless steel perforated plate. To maintain a stable reaction temperature, we used an electric heating furnace; moreover, the temperature was measured using a thermocouple and was regulated using a temperature indicator controller. The average particle size and mass of the bed material were approximately 463 μm and approximately 330 g, respectively, and therefore, these were Group B particles according to the Geldart classification.

(4)):"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts To evaluate the relationship between the properties and performance of the catalysts for the production of H2 from plastic wastes, the as-synthesized catalysts (Ni@CeO2-0.5, Ni@CeO2-1, and Ni@CeO2-2) were characterized using XRD, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and H2-TPR. XRD analysis was used to elucidate the crystal structure and grain size of the catalysts. Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of the Ni@CeO2 core–shell catalysts with different shell thicknesses. The peaks at 2θ = 37°, 43°, and 64° in the XRD profile of the catalysts were attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively, of face-centered cubic nickel oxide (NiO), and the peaks at 2θ = 44°, 52°, and 76° represented the (111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively, of reduced Ni (Ni°). Because the Ni core was calcined in air, the catalyst core mostly comprised face-centered cubic NiO. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.4°, 59.4°, 69.6°, 76.7°, and 79.2° represented the (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) planes, respectively, of CeO2 with face-centered cubic fluorite structure. The diffraction peaks of NiO were present in the XRD profiles of all Ni@CeO2 catalysts, regardless of their shell thickness. The NiO grain size of the Ni core was 27.9 nm, and the Ni crystallite size of the Ni@CeO2-0.5, Ni@CeO2-1, and Ni@CeO2-2 catalysts were 9.8, 10.4, and 11.5 nm, respectively. The catalyst grain size determined using XRD measurements was consistent with the results obtained from the TEM images, and the Ni dispersion and the proportion of Ni and NiO has been listed in Table 2 . From the results, the shells of the core–shell structure could act as barrier between particles during calcination and reaction, and therefore the Ni particles were more dispersed. This prevented their agglomeration and facilitated the formation of smaller particles, which could provide more active catalytic sites. Besides, due to the redox ability by ceria shell, the NiO would reduce to Ni more easily. The TEM images of the Ni@CeO2 core–shell catalysts with different shell thicknesses (Fig. 3 ) revealed that the catalysts comprised Ni cores and CeO2 outer layers, and the thickness of the CeO2 layer gradually increased as the amount of added Ce precursor used to synthesized the catalysts increased (Ni@CeO2-0.5 < Ni@CeO2-1 < Ni@CeO2-2). XPS analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between the thickness of the CeO2 shell of the catalysts and the amount of Ce precursor used to synthesize them. Fig. 4 illustrates the Ni 2p3/2 XPS profiles of the Ni@CeO2 core–shell catalysts. The characteristic peaks at the binding energy of 854.9 ± 0.2 eV corresponded to Ni 2p3/2 and the convoluted peaks at the binding energy of 861.0 ± 0.3 eV were ascribed to the Ni 2p3/2 seismic companion. Because XPS is a surface analysis technique, the intensity of the surface Ni 2p3/2 spin peak and that of the accompanying peak decreased as the thickness of the CeO2 shell increased. Therefore, these results confirmed that the thickness of the CeO2 shell of the Ni@CeO2 core–shell catalysts could be controlled by adjusting the amount of Ce precursor used for their synthesis. The synthesized Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts with different shell thicknesses were analyzed by H2-TPR analysis to investigate the redox ability of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , two peaks could be found in the profile which can be divided into low- and high-temperature reduction peak. With the increasing amount of CeO2 shell, the high temperature peaks were shifted to higher temperature. This indicated that the reduction of NiO to Ni was more likely to occur when the amount of Ce increased. On the other hand, the core-shell structure could disperse the Ni nanoparticles and make the nickel oxide more easily reduced due to the redox properties of CeO2 shell."
7,Performance and stability of Ni@CeO2 catalysts,"3.2 Performance and stability of Ni@CeO2 catalysts Table 3 summarizes the compositions of the gaseous products obtained from the decomposition of PE over the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst, Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts, and SiO2 sand, which were determined using gasification tests in a fluidized bed reactor. Significant differences were observed in the compositions of the gaseous products obtained when the supported Ni/CeO2 and Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts were used. The fraction “N2+CnHm’ stands for N2 and hydrocarbons with more than 5 C atoms including tar and char. From the results, the concentrations of H2 and CO obtained when the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts were used were higher than those recorded when the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst was utilized, and the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and C2-C5 hydrocarbons presented the opposite tendency. It could be speculated that when the gasification of waste plastics was catalyzed using the Ni@CeO2 catalysts, the dry reforming of CH4 and that of hydrocarbons were favored [31]. Dry reforming of CH4 and the reaction is the process of converting methane and carbon dioxide into synthesis gas (H2 + CO). Among the catalysts prepared in this study, Ni@CeO2-0.5 could effectively promote the dry reforming of CH4 and that of tar owing to its small metal active phase and good metal dispersion. The concentration of CH4 was significantly reduced, which consequently increased the concentration of H2 and CO. In addition, the H2 yield was calculated, and the results are presented in Fig. 6 . As observed from the gas composition data, all catalysts were active for the gas production reaction, but the performance of the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts was superior to that of the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst. The gap between the core and shell of the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts provided a homogeneous reaction environment for heterogeneous catalysis, facilitated gas diffusion, and ensured sufficient exposure of the catalyst active sites, and thus, the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts presented better catalytic ability than the supported Ni/CeO2 one. The highest H2 yield of 730.6 mmol/(h g was achieved when the Ni@CeO2-0.5 was used at 700 °C. In addition to the effect of the catalyst, the air ER is an important parameter for the processes that occur in fluidized bed reactors. The ER represents not only the O content of the reactor but also the feed material with thermal reactions that affect the temperature of gasification. According to the gas compositions obtained at different ER values ​(see Table 4 ), as ER increased from 0.1 to 0.2, the H2 concentration slightly increased. The concentrations of other gases, such as CH4 and CO2 decreased from 5.46 to 4.85 and from 7.37 to 5.20 mol%, respectively. The C2-C5 hydrocarbon concentration also significantly decreased as ER increased. Therefore, it was concluded that the higher ERs indicated that the proportion of air introduced into the unit feed material increased. Consequently, more oxidation reactions occurred and the product residence times decreased, and thus, the concentrations of CH4 and CO decreased. At the same time, the concentration of CO2 presented an increasing trend. The carbon production rate of the products obtained at different ERs when Ni@CeO2 catalysts were used in the fluidized bed reactor is also included in Table 3. When ER increased, the proportion of air blown into the feed material increased, the carbonaceous material reacted with air to form CO2, and thus, the proportions of precursor compounds (CH4 and C2-C5 hydrocarbons) decreased. From the above results, it was concluded that increasing ER increased the oxidation reaction, which resulted in an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the gaseous product. When the air ER was 0.1, H2 was produced after the Ni@CeO2-0.5 catalyst reaction. The rate is lower than the ER value of 0.2, but the ER value of 0.1 gas composition of CH4 and C2-C5 hydrocarbon concentration is higher than the ER value of 0.2, so there is a higher production of H2. To test the thermal stability of the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts, long-term catalytic tests were further carried out. Fig. 7 shows the H2 yield and carbon production of the conventional supported Ni/CeO2 and Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts after approximately 3 h of testing under the condition of 700 °C and ER 0.2. The catalyst was in-situ reduced in the first 10 min of the test, and the maximum H2 yield was reached after 10 min of reaction. The H2 yield gradually decreased after 1 h of reaction when the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst was used; moreover, after approximately 3 h, the H2 yields of the reactions catalyzed by the supported Ni/CeO2 and Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts were 60 % and above 95 %, respectively. From the calculated carbon yield values, we inferred that as the amount of generated H2 increased, the amount of synthesized carbon also increased. Compared with the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst, the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalyst exhibited better catalytic ability during long-term testing. By constructing the core-shell catalyst, it can effectively inhibit metal sintering, prevent catalyst deactivation, and exhibit high catalytic stability. In addition, it can be used as a barrier to prevent the agglomeration of nickel particles and improve the dispersion of the active phase nickel, so it has high catalytic activity in terms of catalytic activity."
8,Characterization of used catalysts,"3.3 Characterization of used catalysts The spent catalysts were further characterized by using TGA and SEM analysis. The amounts of different pore-opening agents changed significantly with respect to the catalytic activity of the catalysts, and the carbon deposition reaction was further analyzed using TGA. Almost no carbon deposit was detected when no pore-opening agent was added to the catalyst (Fig. 8 ). When Ce was added, the weight loss of the initial adsorbed moisture occurred in the temperature range of 200−300 °C. Some slight increase is the result of oxidation of Ni, and the thermal weight loss of amorphous carbon begun in the temperature range of 300−400 °C; moreover, the thermal weight loss of highly crystalline carbon occurred in the temperature range of 400−600 °C. As the amount of added Ce increased, the thermogravimetric weight loss in the high crystallization zone increased, the higher the crystallization zone, the higher the crystallization zone is. The opportunity to contact the active phase enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalyst. However, the catalytic activity of the Ni@CeO2-0.5 catalyst was greatly improved and the amount of formed carbon was much lower. As the Ce content was increased, the peaks attributed to carbon were much higher. SEM analysis was used to elucidate the structure of the catalysts and carbon deposition patterns for different catalysts after the reaction (Fig. 9 ). The SEM image of the conventional supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst is presented in Fig. 9(a). Because the active Ni phase was supported on the surface of CeO2 and it was directly exposed to high temperatures and high carbon amounts, the active Ni phase is prone to occur. Ni sintering and carbon coating caused the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst to be gradually deactivated, and therefore, the H2 yield of the reaction catalyzed by the supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst was low. Conversely, Fig. 9(b) and (c) present the SEM images of the Ni@CeO2-0.5 and Ni@CeO2-1 core-shell catalysts after the catalytic gasification reactions. Owing to their core-shell structure, high thermal stability shells were obtained. For the Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts, the active Ni phase was coated with CeO2 to effectively prevent the Ni metal particles from agglomerating and sintering; furthermore, the carbon that formed could prevent the coating and inactivation of the active phase, and therefore, the catalytic activity of the Ni@CeO2-0.5 and Ni@CeO2-1 core-shell catalysts exceeded that of the conventional supported Ni/CeO2 catalyst. The core-shell type catalyst not only provides better activity but also a longer lifetime of the catalyst."
9,Conclusions,"Ni@CeO2 core-shell catalysts with different shell thicknesses were successfully synthesized and were subsequently used for the catalytic decomposition of waste plastics. The CeO2 shell protected the Ni core from being covered by the coke that formed during the reaction. The highest H2 yield of 730.6 mmol/(h g was achieved when the Ni@CeO2-0.5 was used at 700 °C. Different fluidized bed reactor operating conditions were also discussed, and the H2 yield decreased as the ER increased. Moreover, when the Ni@CeO2-0.5 catalyst was tested at high temperature for approximately 3 h, the H2 yield exceeded 95 %. This was attributed to the CeO2 shell protecting the Ni core and prevented the sintering agglomeration of Ni at high temperature. The Ni@CeO2-0.5 catalyst was not easily deactivated during long-term reaction testing and presented good tolerance under high coking conditions. From the results, it is noticed that the core-shell catalyst exhibited significantly better performance on both stability and reactivity. In addition, the close contact between the shell and core of the Ni@CeO2-0.5 catalyst could increase the synergistic effect of the metal, and thus, could contribute to the increase in its catalytic performance. Comparing with hydrogen production from fossil fuels, this idea provides a green way to deal with the energy crisis and waste management."
