0,Introduction,"The scientific community agrees that hydrogen will play an important role as a secondary energy carrier in the near future. Due to its high gravimetrical energy density of 141,800 kJ kg−1, hydrogen is a universal energy carrier suitable for transport purposes such as fuel cell commercial vehicles (FCCV), combined heat and power plants or for zero-emission industrial applications like iron ore reduction [1]. Today nearly 96% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels by conventional techniques such as steam reforming, dry reforming, catalytic partial oxidation or autothermal reforming [2]. Biomass provides a promising alternative for hydrogen production in terms of saving fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2019, the worldwide capacity of biogas reached 19.45 GW, 70% contributed by Europe alone [3]. The Reformer Steam Iron Cycle (RESC) [4] offers an efficient way for decentralized on-site hydrogen production from biogas [5] and provides additional savings in the effort and cost of transporting biogas or hydrogen. Furthermore, the sequestration of high purity carbon dioxide is possible and leads to a negative carbon footprint [6]. Biogas is usually produced by anaerobic digestion of biogenic matter like energy crops, agriculture residues, manure or municipal solid waste. Three types of anaerobic bacteria break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids by hydrolysis to sugars, amino acids and fatty acids. Acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis reactions eventually produce methane and carbon dioxide. Apart from these reactions, hydrogen sulfide is also formed from organically bounded sulfur present in proteins or from SO4- by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Sulfur compounds can enrich in biogas up to a concentration of 5400 ppm depending on the type and composition of the feedstock [7,8]. It is well known that sulfur compounds deactivate metal catalysts even at trace gas levels [9–12]. Most of the relevant literature reported on the deactivation of iron catalysts by hydrogen sulfide refer to ammonia synthesis and the Fischer-Tropsch reaction [13–15]. Furthermore, the influence of sulfur impurities on fuel conversion in chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping oxygen uncoupling(CLOU) processes is indicated in several studies [16–20]. In addition, the reformation of hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen in the presence of xylene and methane are proposed in literature [21,22]. However, no literature is available on the influence and fate of hydrogen sulfides in chemical looping hydrogen processes as well as on the deactivation of applied oxygen carriers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of hydrogen sulfide on the reactivity of a Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier material and the influence of sulfur compounds in different concentrations on the chemical looping process. A qualitative characterization of the reaction mechanisms in the reduction and oxidation phase is given. Fundamental effects and the consequences for purity and yield of the released product hydrogen are shown, as they are of great importance for the upgrading of real biogas to hydrogen."
1,Chemical looping for hydrogen production,"In recent years, many investigations on decentralized hydrogen production have been carried out in the Working Group Fuel Cells and Hydrogen at Graz University of Technology. The Reformer Steam Iron Cycle (RESC), proposed by Hacker et al. [4] is a fixed-bed chemical looping process for the production of high purity hydrogen from renewable feedstock such as biogas, gasified biomass or bio-alcohols [23,24]. Hydrocarbons are converted in a first step to a synthesis gas by steam reforming (Eqs. (1)-(2)). Subsequently, the syngas is used to reduce an iron-based oxygen carrier (Eqs. (3)–(5)). In the oxidation step, iron is converted back to magnetite by steam and high purity hydrogen is released (Eqs. (6)–(7)). Processes of this kind were formerly denoted as steam iron process. The newer designation chemical looping is a more flexible designation and can also include an additional air oxidation step (Eq. (8)). This is necessary to produce carbon dioxide in the product gas of the reduction phase and subsequently utilize carbon capture and storage/utilization [6]. (1) C x H y + H 2 O ↔ x C O + y H 2 Δ H R , 298 = + 247.0 k J mol - 1 (2) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H R , 298 = - 41.1 k J mol - 1 (3) 3 Fe 2 O 3 + H 2 / C O ↔ 2 Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 O / CO 2 Δ H R , 298 = - 43.3 / - 40.4 k J mol - 1 (4) Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 / C O ↔ 3 F e O + H 2 O / CO 2 Δ H R , 298 = + 74.7 / + 33.6 k J mol - 1 (5) FeO + H 2 / C O ↔ F e + H 2 O / CO 2 Δ H R , 298 = + 25.4 / - 15.7 k J mol - 1 (6) 3 F e + 4 H 2 O ↔ Fe 3 O 4 + 4 H 2 Δ H R , 298 = - 151.1 k J mol - 1 (7) 3 F e O + H 2 O ↔ Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 Δ H R , 298 = - 74.7 k J mol - 1 (8) 4 F e 3 O 4 + O 2 ↔ 6 F e 2 O 3 Δ H R , 298 = - 485.1 k J m o l - 1 A fixed-bed reactor system was preferred to enable (i) a simple process design without moving parts, (ii) the opportunity of a process-integrated energy storage with high volumetric density and (iii) a high scalability for demand-based decentralized hydrogen production. Thermodynamic investigations showed a process efficiency (LHV-based) of up to 75% depending on the feedstock [25]. Furthermore, a concept for a small-scale production of pure pressurized hydrogen was reported. It includes the sequestration of a pure carbon dioxide stream throughout the reduction step, enabling a negative carbon footprint. A delivery pressure of 95 bar was achieved, which significantly reduces the energy demand for compression to the final filling pressure [26,27]. The operation of an enlarged 10kWth laboratory prototype system was investigated to gain knowledge of the temperature and gas distribution and their influence on hydrogen purity. An experimental study showed that hydrogen purity exceeding 99.999% is attainable from methane and biogas depending on feed gas flow rate and steam to carbon ratio [28,29]. Several other studies have been conducted on hydrogen production via chemical looping [30–33]. Lachen et al. [34] proposed methane dry reforming of synthetic biogas combined with the steam–iron process for high-purity hydrogen production. In the experiments, small amounts of steam were added to the feed gas to avoid carbon deposition in a fixed-bed reactor setup during reforming. Another investigation by Galvita et al. [35] showed a two-step chemical looping process for hydrogen production. Here, the immediate reduction of iron oxide to iron is carried out by methane or biogas, followed by a steam oxidation step. However, in all studies synthetic biogas was used for the experiments. The utilization of real biogas, taking into account the interaction of sulfur impurities with the oxygen carrier used, has not yet been investigated."
2,General mechanisms of sulfur deactivation,"The chemisorption of hydrogen sulfide on the surface of catalysts and thus the loss of activity and/or selectivity, is a problem of great importance in industrial chemical processes. In the past few decades, many investigations have been performed to determine the effects of catalyst deactivation. In this chapter, possible deactivation mechanisms of the oxygen carrier material in chemical looping hydrogen processes are discussed in detail. In general, six different deactivation mechanisms are given in literature: (i) poisoning, (ii) fouling, (iii) thermal degradation, (iv) vapor compound formation, (v) vapor-solid and/or solid–solid reaction and (vi) attrition/crushing [36]. Based on the literature on chemical looping given above, poisoning and thermal degradation through sintering in particular are expected to have the most significant influence on reactivity and stable hydrogen yields over the lifetime of the oxygen intermediate."
3,Poisoning,"3.1 Poisoning Poisoning of active metal occurs through favored chemisorption of impurities, products or reactants on active sites that would otherwise be available for the favored reaction. This results from the higher adsorption strength of the impurity compared to the favored reactant. In case of sulfur poisoning of iron catalysts, three to four atoms of iron are physically blocked three-dimensionally by one atom of sulfur [36]. Hence, even very small sulfur quantities lead to significant deactivation of the iron surface. In general, the deactivation of metal catalysts is quantified by the normalized activity. It represents the ratio between the reaction rate constant of the favored reaction with impurities to the reaction rate constant without impurities. In the case of hydrogen sulfide poisoning, the chemisorption strength decreases with increasing temperature and thus the normalized activity of the favored reaction also increases [37]. Apart from physical blocking, the electrical modification of neighboring iron atoms also leads to a lower adsorption ability of the reactants [36]. Due to the temperatures of up to 950 °C in the RESC process, a high diffusion resistance of gases in the pores can be expected. Hence, the larger hydrogen sulfide molecules adsorb at the outer surface in hydrogen atmosphere. As a consequence, the diffusion of reactants into the inner pores is blocked, leading to an additional reduction in the reactants consumption."
4,Sintering,"3.2 Sintering In high temperature processes, thermally induced deactivation by sintering is a common issue. The loss of active surface area is primarily caused by crystallite growth of the catalytic active sites. In addition, crystal and atom migration leads to agglomeration of the fine particles. This effect can be intensified by impurities that act as promoters, such as chlorine, fluorine and sulfur, as these increase the atomic mobility. In general, sintering rates increase exponentially with increasing temperature. Considering all sintering mechanisms separately, however, is a gross oversimplification ignoring the simultaneous occurrence and possible interactions between them [36]."
5,Thermodynamics of sulfur chemisorption,"3.3 Thermodynamics of sulfur chemisorption The thermodynamic behavior of gas-metal adsorption is strongly influenced by the strength of the binding forces between reactants and the active surface of the catalyst, depending on the number of available valence electrons in the respective system. In the event of dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen sulfide on iron (Eq. (9)), strong binding forces lead to a highly exothermic reaction behavior [38]. (9) Fe + H 2 S ↔ F e S + H 2 Δ G R , 1073 = - 59.4 k J mol - 1 Δ H R , 1073 = - 69.6 k J m o l - 1 At the respective process temperatures of chemical looping, typically between 700 and 900 °C, a sufficiently high concentration of H2S in the gas phase is a prerequisite for the molecular formation of iron sulfide. Thermodynamic simulations in FactSage suggested that for the reduction of magnetite with hydrogen including trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide, at least about 5700 ppm of H2S would be required in the atmosphere to form pyrrhotite at a temperature of 850 °C (see Fig. 1, red line). Hence, associative (molecular) chemisorption of H2S at the oxygen carrier surface and thus physical blocking of iron atoms without pyrrhotite formation is to be expected in the experimental investigation."
6,Experimental,
7,Materials,"4.1 Materials The investigated oxygen carrier material consisted of 80%Fe2O3 and 20%Al2O3 (Alpha Aesar) with a particle size of 20–60 µm. The powders were dry-mixed with an intensive mixer and pelletized to a pellet size of 2–5 mm using water as a binder. The pellets were heat treated in air at 900 °C for 6 h. To ensure a homogeneous gas distribution in the reactor, the oxygen carrier material was placed between fixed beds of 1 mmquartz glass beads (Sigmund Lindner)."
8,Experimental setup,"4.2 Experimental setup For the experimental investigation of the oxygen carrier material, a test rig consisting of a gas supply unit, a fixed-bed reactor and an analysis system was used (see Fig. 2 ). The experiments were carried out in a quartz glass reactor (di = 17 mm, L = 900 mm) which was heated in a cylindrical furnace (Gero) up to a process temperature of 850 °C. The fixed bed comprised of 35 g oxygen carrier was imbedded by quartz glass beads. A thermocouple was positioned in the center of the reactor to measure the temperature in the oxygen carrier bed. Mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst EL FLOW) supplied all gases. High purity water for the oxidation step was provided by a HPLC pump. A bypass line was installed upstream of the reactor for feed gas composition analysis. To avoid the condensation of steam and thus dissolution of sulfur components in the outlet gas, a heating line (Winkler WAKW) was installed at the reactor outlet. To increase flexibility in the gas conditioning system, a 4-way valve was used to direct the outlet gas flow into the respective wash bottle for the reduction and oxidation phase or a bypass for reactor purging. The wash bottles were filled with onemolar sulfuric acid and cooled to 4 °C to condense steam in the product gas, but at the same time avoid the dissolution of H2S. All gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (InficonµGCFusion). In addition, an infrared gas spectrometer (ABB) was used to permanently monitor H2 in the outlet gas."
9,Experimental procedure,"4.3 Experimental procedure To ensure meaningful data in the experimental investigation, the entire system needs to be chemically inert to sulfur compounds. Dedicated preliminary-tests were performed for each subsystem to minimize the loss of H2S or SO2 in the gas phase. In general, the feed gas flow was set to 1.135 NL min−1 during the reduction phase, which equals a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 800 h−1. To ensure similar flow conditions, the same GHSV of previous investigations in a large-scale 10 kWth RESC prototype system was applied [28]. For the oxidation phase, 200 NmL min−1 of N2 was used as an internal gas standard. To characterize the basic effects of hydrogen sulfide occurrence, several redox cycles were performed using a reductive feed gas mixture of 100 ppmH2S, 20 vol%H2 and 80 vol% N2 as internal standard. The rather small amount of hydrogen in the feed gas was intended to extend the reduction and oxidation phase. This allowed an improved visualization of the underlying reaction mechanisms and oxidation states of the oxygen carrier during the reaction. To quantitatively investigate the impact of H2S on the reactivity of the oxygen carrier material, redox cycles were performed for different H2S concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 ppm. The feed gas mixture consisted of 50 vol% N2 as gas standard and 50 vol%ofH2 as reducing agent including the specified H2S. At the beginning of each cycle, the feed gas composition was analyzed using the reactor bypass line. After reaching the desired H2S concentration, both the bypass line and the reactor were purged for 5 min. The reduction step was performed until the hydrogen content in the product gas was equal to the hydrogen content in the feed gas. The entire system was then purged with N2 for 15 min. The oxidation step was carried out for 20 min until no more H2 was released. Furthermore, experiments of 10 redox cycles with 100 ppmH2S in the reductive feed gas were performed to gain knowledge about the long-term reactivity behavior. In Table 1 all feed gas compositions are summarized."
10,Physical characterization of oxygen carrier,"4.4 Physical characterization of oxygen carrier Due to the expected low adsorbed sulfur quantity per mass of oxygen intermediate, ICP–OES analysis was applied for the quantitative characterization of sulfur present in the tested material. Four independent analyses were performed. For each, a sample of 5 g was ground and dissolved in a solution of HNO3/HCl. The ionized sulfur atoms were detected by an optical emission spectrometer. Furthermore, BET analysis was performed to investigate the influence of sulfur on sintering of the oxygen intermediate. The surface area was estimated by nitrogen adsorption and calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of fundamental effects,"5.1 Characterization of fundamental effects The experimental results show three different effects during a redox cycle. In Fig. 3 , the volume flow of hydrogen and the trace gas components are given for one representative reduction cycle. The three different part reduction reactions can be seen in the course of hydrogen. It shows a complete conversion of hydrogen in the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, a high conversion of hydrogen in the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and the rather low conversion of hydrogen in the reduction of FeO to Fe. The first effect indicates a release of H2S during the reduction phase. The part reduction reaction of Fe3O4 to FeO is strongly endothermic, leading to a significant decrease of the temperature in the oxygen carrier bed. After the reaction is completed, the temperature approaches the original level again. At this point, a large quantity of H2S is released (see Fig. 5). During the oxidation phase, the strong exothermal behavior leads to a rise in temperature, followed by a renewed release of hydrogen sulfide (see Fig. 4 ). In addition, SO2 is formed in the very first reduction reaction of the first redox cycle for each experiment. The hematite oxidation state of iron only occurs in fresh oxygen carrier material and forms SO2 with sulfur according to (Eq. (10)). The formation of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide in the reduction phase was also explored in chemical looping combustion processes with Fe2O3 as oxygen intermediate by Chung et al. [39]. (10) 6 F e 2 O 3 + H 2 S ↔ 4 F e 3 O 4 + SO 2 + H 2 Δ G R , 1073 = - 87.7 k J mol - 1 Δ H R , 1073 = + 211.7 k J m o l - 1 Throughout all experiments the sulfur was generally adsorbed accumulatively on the surface. During the steam oxidation reaction, all the accumulated sulfur was released again. This fact was proved by the fullfilment of the sulfur mass balance (see Table 2 ). This leads to significant sulfur contamination in the product hydrogen. Formation of SO2 during oxidation with air was not explored throughout the test series (see Fig. 5 )."
13,Temperature dependency of sulfur adsorption,"5.2 Temperature dependency of sulfur adsorption To describe the influence on the reaction mechanisms, the temperature in the oxygen carrier bed was monitored using a type k thermocouple. The course of the temperature (Fig. 5) indicates a release of hydrogen sulfide after a sharp increase of temperature during the reduction phase as well as the oxidation phase. In the following oxidation with air, no sulfur compounds were released. This effect was also seen by Arabczyketal. [40], who reported a lower strength of sulfur bonds and thus an increasing catalyst activity with increasing temperature. Further investigations were made to validate this hypothesis. At a temperature of 700 °C, the reduction of iron oxide to iron using a feed gas concentration of 50 vol% H2 and 50 vol% N2 including 140 ppm H2S was carried out. Under a reductive hydrogen atmosphere without hydrogen sulfide contaminants, the furnace was heated to 950 °C. At a temperature of about 920 °C, the adsorbed hydrogen sulfide was released again. Fig. 6 shows the course of temperature and H2S concentration. In Fig. 7 , the desorption of H2S during the oxidation phase is given for three different temperatures. For these experiments, the reduction of iron oxide to iron using a feed gas concentration of 50 vol% H2 and 50 vol% N2 including 50 ppm H2S was carried out at initial temperatures of 650 °C, 750 °C and 850 °C. The samples were reoxidized with steam after each reduction phase at the respective temperature. It can be seen that hardly any sulfur contamination occurs at 650 °C, what fits to the theory of temperature dependence discussed above. Instead, the whole amount of hydrogen sulfide entering the reduction phase at 650 °C and 750 °C was released in the steam oxidation phase at 750 °C. At a process temperature of 850 °C in the RESC, also a significant H2S contamination occurs. As consequence, a pre-treatment step for the separation of H2S is needed for the processing of real biogas via the RESC process."
14,Impact of H2S on oxygen carrier reactivity,"5.3 Impact of H2S on oxygen carrier reactivity The influence of hydrogen sulfide on the reactivity of the applied oxygen carrier material is a major aspect in processing real biogas in chemical looping hydrogen production. Quantitative investigations showed that H2S leads to a significant decrease of the hydrogen consumption in the reduction phase and thus the released product hydrogen in the oxidation phase. Fig. 8 shows the volume of consumed hydrogen in the reduction phase with and without 100 ppm hydrogen sulfide for ten consecutive reduction cycles.. In the first three cycles, the deactivation through sulfur poisoning would appear to have a strong impact on the reactivity of the oxygen intermediate. A 12% loss of the hydrogen consumption was ascertained compared to a reference experiment without trace gases after four cycles. From cycle four to ten, constant difference was determined."
15,Mass balance of hydrogen sulfide,"5.4 Mass balance of hydrogen sulfide In order to increase the significance of the investigation, the mass balance of hydrogen sulfide was established. The H2S quantity entering the process during reduction and the H2S quantity leaving the system in the oxidation phase were calculated according to (Eqs. (11)-(12)). The deviation of the H2S amounts was calculated according to (Eq. (13)). (11) N H 2 S , I N = V ̇ Feed ∗ t red ∗ ν H 2 S v m [ m m o l ] (12) N H 2 S , O U T = V ̇ prod ∗ t oxid ∗ ν H 2 S v m m m o l (13) Dev = N H 2 S , I N - N H 2 S , O U T N H 2 S , I N ∗ 100 % In Table 2 the results for five redox cycles are given. The mean deviation of 3.72% can be explained by inaccuracies in the calibration of the used mass flow controllers and thus the mass balance is fulfilled."
16,Oxygen carrier characterization,"5.5 Oxygen carrier characterization The results of ICP-EOS analysis (Table 3 ) show a mean sulfur loading of 644 mg S kg−1 oxygen carrier after a reduction cycle including 140 ppm H2S in the reductive feed gas. Hence, the theory of deactivation through sulfur poisoning and the loss of reactivity of the regarding material is feasible (see Table 4 ). The hypothesis of enhanced particle sintering through sulfur was proved by BET analysis. Two samples in Fe3O4 oxidation state were analyzed (see Table 4): Sample A represents oxygen carrier material after five redox cycles without sulfur impurities in the reductive feed gas. Sample B is an oxygen carrier material after five redox cycles including 100 ppm H2S in the reductive feed gas. It can be seen that no significant decrease of the active surface area occurs due to the presence of sulfur in the process."
17,Conclusion,"The impact of H2S on the reactivity of Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier material in chemical looping hydrogen production has been discussed in this paper. A fundamental temperature dependency of the H2S chemisorption process was observed in preliminary experiments. The release of H2S in the event of increasing process temperatures due to weakened sulfur bonds was registered. A high process temperature of 850 °C, a maximum H2S concentration of 140 ppm and the release of sulfur in form of hydrogen sulfide assumed an associative (molecular) chemisorption of H2S on the materials surface. An ICP-EOS analysis confirmed the adsorption of sulfur on the regarding oxygen intermediate. The released hydrogen sulfide leads to a significant contamination of the product hydrogen and thus a pre-treatment step is necessary in processing real biogas. A correct quantification was confirmed by a fulfilled mass balance within a mean deviation of 3.7%. It could be seen that the presence of 100 ppm H2S in the reductive feed gas led to a 12% loss of reactivity of the applied oxygen carrier in chemical looping hydrogen production via the RESC."
