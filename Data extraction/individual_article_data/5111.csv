0,Introduction,"Bimetallic catalysts always exhibit different properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The bimetallic structure could strongly affect the catalytic performance. Pd-based catalysts are commonly used in hydrogenation reactions because of the robust activity. Among the Pd-based catalysts, CuPd catalysts have been reported extensively in various reactions, such as selective hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes [1–3], CO2 hydrogenation [4–6], hydrogenation of succinic acid [7], etc. The Cu/Pd ratio could result in different bimetallic structures over the supported catalyst. When Cu/Pd ratio is low, the catalyst mainly consists of Cu-Pd alloy structures as well as the monometallic phases [5]. When Cu/Pd ratio is high, the emergence of single atom or cluster sites of Pd would occur [3,8]. The catalysts with high Cu/Pd ratio especially draw attention due to the lower loading of Pd which results in a reduction of catalyst cost. In the previous studies, by adding a small amount of Pd into the Cu-based catalyst, the catalytic properties could be significantly enhanced for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes [3,8–10]. The characterization suggested that the coordination of Pd-Pd almost disappeared when the Cu/Pd ratio was close to 40, and the unique catalytic properties could be explained by the local chemical environment of the isolated Pd sites. In the hydrogenation of CO2, Pd was reported to enhance the methanol formation rate over the Cu-based catalysts [4,11], where the Pd1Cu3 and Pd1Cu1 alloy structure was found to correlate with the promotion of methanol synthesis [2]. As reported by Xiao et al. [4], the optimum Pd/(Pd + Cu) ratio was 0.34 (Cu/Pd = 2). Although the Pd/(Pd + Cu) ratio has been studied from 0.43 to 0.48, a much higher ratio of Cu/Pd has not been investigated. Therefore, the bimetallic CuPd catalyst with high Cu/Pd ratio is reported in the current study for the hydrogenation of CO2. Catalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals is an effective way to address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions as well as the utilization of renewable energy. By the catalytic hydrogenation, CO2 could be converted into CO, CH4, methanol and longer chains of alkane and alcohol. The bimetallic CuPd catalyst and the corresponding monometallic catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method. An inert support SiO2 was chosen in order to eliminate the metal-support interaction. The Cu/Pd atomic ratio was 33.5, which has been evidenced that isolated Pd sites could be formed [8]. The catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programed reduction (TPR), CO-pulse titration, N2O-chemisorption, temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, and were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor. In addition, a model surface of Pd1Cu(111) was investigated by DFT calculations to understand the electronic effect with the comparison of Cu(111) and Pd(111) surfaces."
1,Experimental and theoretical methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The supported catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. The support in this study was SiO2 (44741, Alfa Aesar), which were screened to 180–250 μm prior to use. The precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving Pd(NO3)2·xH2O (Alfa Aesar) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) in an amount of water just sufficient to fill the pores of 3 g of the support. The precursor solution was then added to the support by dropwise addition and was stirred thoroughly between droplets. The samples were aged for 0.5 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the impregnated samples were dried at 353 K overnight and were calcined at 673 K in air for 5 h. The Pd and Cu loadings on the supported catalysts were 0.8 wt% and 16.5 wt%, respectively, with a Cu/Pd atomic ratio of 33.5."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 N2-physisorption The surface areas of the support and catalysts were analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K using a BELSORP-max (BEL Japan, Inc.) instrument. The samples were degassed at 573 K for 3 h prior to analysis. The surface areas were estimated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distributions were obtained by applying the B.J.H. formalism to the desorption branch of the isotherms. 2.2.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the reduced catalysts were obtained using a JEM2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to perform elemental analysis on alloy particles to understand the dispersion of copper and palladium. 2.2.3 Temperature programed reduction (TPR) The temperature programed reduction (TPR) were performed on a Quantachrome chemisorption analyzer in order to determine the reduction properties of the supported catalysts. Approximately 50 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor and was pretreated in He at 623 K for 1 h to remove water and other impurities on the catalyst surface. After cooling to room temperature in He, the temperature program reduction started from 303 K to 1073 K at the ramping rate of 10 K/min in 10% H2/Ar. 2.2.4 CO-pulse titration To determine the number of available Pd active sites on the catalysts, carbon monoxide (CO) uptake was measured using the Quantachrome chemisorption analyzer. Approximately 50 mg fresh catalyst was packed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and was reduced at 623 K in 10% H2/Ar for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in He, pulse CO chemisorption was performed at room temperature using pulses of CO. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the flow of CO out of the quartz reactor. The amount of adsorbed CO was calculated by summing the absent peak areas based on the saturated peak area. It was assumed that one Pd atom would adsorb one CO molecule; therefore the uptakes of CO would display positive correlation with the quantity of exposed Pd sites on the catalysts. 2.2.5 N2O-chemisorption N2O-chemisorption [12] was performed to determine the Cu dispersion and the exposed Cu surface area of the catalysts. Approximately 50 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor and was pretreated in He at 623 K for 1 h to remove water and other impurities on the catalysts. After cooling to room temperature in He, the first TPR process was performed in 10% H2/Ar to 623 K at the ramping rate of 10 K/min and the temperature was held at 623 K for 10 min in order to fully reduce the samples. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to 323 K in He. The surface copper atoms were allowed to be oxidized in N2O at 323 K for 0.5 h. Before the second TPR process, the sample was flushed with He to remove the physisorbed oxidant. The peak areas of the first and the second TPR profiles were denoted as X and Y, respectively. The dispersion of Cu (D) and the exposed Cu surface area (S Cu) were calculated based on the equations: (1) D = ( 2 × Y / X ) × 100 % (2) S Cu = 2 × Y × N av × C u w t % / ( X × M Cu × 1.4 × 10 19 ) = 223.245 × Y / X ( m 2 - C u / g - c a t ) where N av is the Avogadro’s constant, M Cu is the molecular weight of copper (63.546 g/mol), and 1.4 × 1019 is the average copper surface atom area of 0.0711 nm2, which is equivalent to 1.4 × 1019 copper atoms per square meter). 2.2.6 Temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 for the investigated catalysts was measured by the Quantachrome chemisorption analyzer. Prior to measurement, the catalyst was reduced at 623 K under a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar for 1 h. After cooling in He, the catalyst was purged with CO2 at 303 K for 60 min, and was flushed with He flow to remove the physisorbed molecules. Afterward, the TPD experiment was performed with a heating rate of 10 K/min in He. 2.2.7 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to measure the adsorption sites of CO on different catalysts. The FT-IR spectra were recorded with 4 cm−1 resolution using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT-A) detector. The design of the IR cell was based on a design reported elsewhere in the literature [13]. The details of the cell structure and the sample preparation procedure have been previously reported [2,14]. The catalysts of ~20 mg were loaded in the cell by pressing the catalyst powder onto a tungsten mesh (1 × 2.4 cm, 100 mesh, 0.025 cm wire diameter, Alfa Aesar). Before experiment, the IR cell and gas manifold were evacuated to a pressure below 5 × 10−3 Pa for 0.5 h in order to remove water and other impurities. The catalyst was reduced at 623 K in 4 kPa of hydrogen for 0.5 h. The cell was evacuated again, and a high-temperature flash (623 K) was performed to remove any surface species generated during the reduction period. The reduced catalyst was lowered into the IR beam in order to collect the surface background spectra. Then ~4 kPa of CO was introduced into the IR cell and kept there for 0.5 h at room temperature before evacuating the cell. Surface spectra of adsorbed CO were then collected."
4,Computational details,"2.3 Computational details The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of surface density of states were performed using the vdW-DF2 functional [15,16], a plane-wave basis set with a cut-off kinetic energy of 450 eV, and the projector-augmented wave method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [16–18]. Three surfaces of Pd(111), Cu(111), and Pd1/Cu(111) were used in the current study to investigate the surface properties of isolated Pd sites on the Cu surface. The surfaces were modeled using a periodic 2 × 2 unit cell, and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a (3 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack grid. The Pd1/Cu(111) surface was derived by replacing one Cu atom with Pd atom on the Cu(111) surface. The surfaces were then modeled by adding six equivalent layers of vacuum onto five layers of the corresponding metals, in which the bottom three layers were frozen, while the top two layers were allowed to relax to reach the lowest energy configuration. The density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) were obtained by a non-self-consistent calculation after the relaxation and self-consistent calculations. PDOS and DOS spectra were obtained by processing the molecular orbital information in p4vasp program."
5,Catalytic evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic evaluation The hydrogenation of CO2 was performed in a fixed-bed reactor to evaluate the catalytic performance under steady-states conditions. Prior to reaction, 0.30 g of catalyst was loaded in the middle of the reactor and was reduced at 623 K in H2 for 2 h. After cooled to room temperature, the catalyst was exposed to the reactant stream which consisted of 75% H2 and 25% CO2, with a CO2 to hydrogen ratio of 1:3. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of reactant flow was 4000 mL/(gcat∙h). The reaction was performed at the temperatures of 493–633 K and at the pressure of 4 mPa. Samples were left on stream at each temperature for 2 h. (3) Conversion % = 1 - C C O 2 , o u t C C O 2 , i n × 100 % (4) Selectivit y P % = C P C C O 2 , i n - C C O 2 , o u t × 100 % The TOF based on the total surface sites was calculated by the following equation: (5) TOF ( s - 1 ) = X C O 2 × V C O 2 / ( m cat × M v × t o t a l s u r f a c e s i t e s ) (6) Total s u r f a c e s i t e s = N exposed P d s i t e s + N exposed C u s i t e s where Mv is the molar volume of the ideal gas (22,400 mol/L). V CO2 is the flow rate of CO2 (mL/min). N exposed Pd sites is the moles of exposed Pd sites, and N exposed Cu sites is the moles of exposed Cu sites. The CO uptake value was used for the mole of exposed Pd site by assuming one exposed Pd atom adsorbs one CO molecule. The TOFs reported in the supplementary materials were calculated by replacing the total surface sites in Eq. (5) with total metal loading, Cu loading, and Cu surface sites, respectively. In order to eliminate the effect of support and other experimental factors, the performance of bimetallic CuPd catalysts in the current work are compared with literature by the enhancement factor, which is defined as: (7) Enhancement F a c t o r = S T Y CuPd / S T Y Cu"
6,Results,
7,Physiochemical properties,"3.1 Physiochemical properties The texture properties of the supported catalysts are shown in Table 1 along with the support. The surface areas and pore volumes of Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pd/SiO2 are lower than SiO2, while those of Pd/SiO2 do not decrease significantly. The decrease in surface area and pore volume over the Cu-containing catalysts probably stem from the relatively high loading of Cu (16.5%) compared with the low loading of Pd (0.8%). The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 1 . The crystalline phase of Pd(111) is present at 40.1° [19]on Pd/SiO2 and the crystalline facets of Cu(111), (200) and (220) are observed at 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.0° on Cu/SiO2 [20]. On the bimetallic catalyst Cu-Pd/SiO2, the peaks for Pd crystal phase are absent, implying that most of the Pd atoms interact with Cu atoms. The peaks for Cu phases are present however broader than the monometallic Cu/SiO2. The Cu crystalline sizes were calculated by Scherrer Equation as exhibited in Table 2 . The Cu crystalline size decreases from 36.6 nm to 22.5 nm with Pd addition, indicating an increased dispersion of Cu. Moreover, the peak at 43.3° over Cu-Pd/SiO2 is asymmetric, and could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 42.8° and 43.3°, respectively. The peak at 42.8° could be ascribed to the Pd1Cu3 phase as reported by Xiao et al.[4], and the alloy phase was reported to be responsible for the enhancement of methanol production. The TEM images were taken under normal mode as shown in Fig. S1. Because the metal particles overlap with the support, the identification of metal particles is difficult. Therefore, the HADDF TEM images of the reduced Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pd/SiO2 are presented in Fig. 2 . Both large and small metal particles are observed over Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pd/SiO2. Because the Pd loading is low, the Pd particles could not be identified in the TEM images possibly due to the low exposure of Pd on the catalyst surface (Cu/Pd surface atomic ratio by XPS = 54.0) and the higher Pd dispersion with low crystallinity. Moreover, the EDS analysis Cu/Pd ratios of selected regions in Fig. 2(d) over the reduced Cu-Pd/SiO2 are summarized in Table S1. In multiple regions, only Cu was detected; while in other regions, the Cu/Pd ratio varies from 1.2 to 48.5. Despite the measurement error, the data could still indicate that both Cu and Cu-Pd bimetallic phases are present on Cu-Pd/SiO2, which is consistent with the XRD result. The high Cu/Pd ratio from EDS analysis also indicates that highly dispersed Pd atoms or clusters possibly exist in the Cu bulk phase. The reduction behaviour of the supported catalysts are explored by TPR as exhibited in Fig. 3 . A small negative peak was observed at ~100 °C over Pd/SiO2, which could be assigned to the decomposition of Pd hydrides. Lower reduction temperature peak is observed over Cu-Pd/SiO2 than over Cu/SiO2, implying the facilitated reduction property by the interaction of Pd and Cu. A shoulder peak is present over the spectrum of Cu-Pd/SiO2, which suggests the existence of different oxide species over the bimetallic catalyst in consistence with the XRD result. The absences of the Pd diffraction peaks and the negative peak for PdHx over Cu-Pd/SiO2 suggest that most Pd atoms interact with Cu atoms on the bimetallic structure."
8,Surface properties,"3.2 Surface properties In order to explore the surface sites of Pd and Cu, the CO uptake values are obtained by CO pulse titration, and the exposed surface Cu atoms and the Cu dispersion are obtained by N2O chemisorption. As shown in Table 2, the CO uptake value increases significantly by the interaction of Pd with Cu, implying that the Pd atoms are better dispersed over the bimetallic catalysts. Similarly, Cu atoms are better dispersed over the bimetallic catalysts compared with the monometallic catalyst as evidenced by the increased exposed surface area of Cu and the increased Cu dispersion. The CO2-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 4 to understand the surface adsorption properties. A significant desorption peak is observed over Cu-Pd/SiO2 at ~380 K, implying a considerable amount of weak-adsorbed CO2 over the bimetallic catalyst. A small desorption peak at ~400 K is observed over Pd/SiO2, while no obvious peak for weak adsorption is found over Cu/SiO2. In the medium adsorption range (500–650 K), a minor peak is observed over Cu-Pd/SiO2, and the monometallic catalysts exhibit mostly baseline. In the strong adsorption range (>650 K), the three catalysts exhibit similar desorption peaks. Because we did not observe any adsorption peaks in the FT-IR spectra of CO2 adsorption (Fig. S3), it is inferred that the strong desorption peaks might be the surface desorption of the support rather than CO2 desorption. The bimetallic catalyst shows distinctive CO2 adsorption properties compared with the monometallic catalysts. It possesses significantly higher amount of weak adsorption sites compared with Cu/SiO2 and Pd/SiO2. Because the weak adsorption arises due to the Pd addition, it could be inferred that the weak adsorption might be on the Pd site or on the site of the Pd-Cu interface. The significantly larger weak desorption peak over Cu-Pd/SiO2 is probably due to the better dispersion of Pd atoms or the presence of Cu-Pd interaction. Therefore, the rise of weak adsorption sites could attributable to the Cu-Pd interaction and the rise of bimetallic sites or the isolated Pd sites. The surface properties of the Cu-Pd bimetallic structure was further characterized by in-situ FT-IR of CO adsorption as shown in Fig. 5 (a). Five major intensity bands are observed for Pd/SiO2 [21]. The band at 1703 cm−1 is assigned to the hollow sites; the bands at 1805 cm−1 and 1920 cm−1 are assigned to the bridged adsorption on the crystal planes of Pd(111) and Pd(100)/(210), respectively. The peak around 2062 cm−1 is attributed to the linear sites. The band at 2163 cm−1 is considered as the linear adsorption site at Pd cations which implies the interaction between Pd and the support [22]. No obvious peak was observed on Cu monometallic catalyst, implying that the CO is very weakly adsorbed under the environment that the gas phase was removed from the IR cell. One minor peak appears at 2120 cm−1 for Cu-Pd/SiO2. According to literature [3,23], a similar peak at ~2130 cm−1 was found over Cu/SiO2, and a red shift was observed for the bimetallic CuPd catalyst, implying a stronger adsorption, which is consistent with the current work. The adsorption peak at 2120 cm−1 should be attributed to a linear adsorption on the site formed by Cu-Pd interation. Moreover, the in-situ FT-IR of N2O adsorption was also performed. As shown in Fig. 5(b), two main peaks are observed for Pd/SiO2 at 2226 cm−1 and 1226 cm−1. No peak are found over Cu/SiO2. Although N2O is normally used to characterize the exposed surface area of Cu, the surface adsorption other than the surface oxidation reaction is difficult to occur at room temperature. The surface of Cu-Pd/SiO2 exhibit similar adsorption peaks with Pd/SiO2 at 2226 cm−1 and 1226 cm−1, whereas the peak at 2226 cm−1 is much smaller. The distinctive adsorption properties of N2O also indicate that the bimetallic catalyst has a different surface structure other than the two monometallic catalysts."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.3 Catalytic performance The prepared catalysts are evaluated for the hydrogenation of CO2 in a fixed-bed reactor. The CO2 conversion and the Arrhenius plots of TOF based on the total surface metal sites are shown in Fig. 6 , along with the regressed activation energies. Cu-Pd/SiO2 exhibits slightly higher activity than Cu/SiO2; however, if normalized by the exposed Cu surface site, the activities become similar (Fig. S6). The regressed activation energies of the Cu-based catalysts are also similar. The product selectivities are shown in Fig. 7 . The CO selectivity is lower over Pd/SiO2, which corresponds to the higher selectivity of CH4. Although the RWGS reaction is suppressed over Pd/SiO2, the activity hinders its application in methanation. The selectivities of CO are similar over Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pd/SiO2, and the selectivity of MeOH is only slightly higher over Cu-Pd/SiO2. The similarities in activity and selectivities imply that the electronic effect induced by Pd-Cu interaction is weak for the catalytic performance. The STYs of methanol are below 1 g. kgcat -1. h−1 for Pd/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 over the investigated temperature range, and Cu-Pd/SiO2 exhibits significantly higher STY of methanol. Specifically, the highest STY is obtained at the temperature of 553 K over Cu-Pd/SiO2, which is more than three times higher than those over the monometallic catalysts. The enhanced STY of methanol mainly originates from the enhanced CO2 hydrogenation activity as exhibited in Fig. 7. In order to investigate the intermediates over the bimetallic catalysts, the FT-IR spectra were recorded after 100 °C and 280 °C reaction with the gas phase evacuated as shown in Fig. S3(b) and (c), respectively. However, only adsorption peaks are observed over Pd/SiO2, while the adsorption spectra are mainly baseline over the Cu-based catalysts, implying that intermediates are weakly adsorbed over the Cu-based catalysts."
10,Discussion,"The physical chemical properties of the CuPd bimetallic catalyst with high Cu/Pd ratio is different from that of the PdCu alloy structure. The XRD patterns for Cu-Pd bimetallic structure in the literature [3] exhibit Pd1Cu3, Pd1Cu1 and Cu crystal phases, while in the current study, the bimetallic catalyst exhibits Pd1Cu3 and Cu phases. High Cu/Pd ratio has been investigated for CuPd/SiO2; however, no obvious phase separation was reported at a similar Cu/Pd ratio of 40 [3]. The different result may stem from a lower metal loading of ~5% in the literature, and the XRD measurement may not precise enough to detect the minor Pd1Cu3 alloy phase. Although the XAFS result [24] reveals that the coordination of Pd-Pd almost disappeared when the Cu/Pd ratio was close to 40 and isolated Pd sites mainly exist over the catalyst, the phase separation should not be neglected. Moreover, the CO adsorbs stronger over Cu-Pd/SiO2 than over Cu/SiO2, possibly due to the formation of Cu-Pd alloy and highly dispersed Pd clusters or single atoms over the Cu-rich particles [25] that could bear some positive charge due to the interaction with Cu. The presence of Pd1Cu3 alloy phase and the isolated Pd sites at the Cu-rich particles generates two types Pd-Cu interactions. The bimetallic interaction could modify the adsorption and activation of H2 and CO2. Nie et al. [26]. investigated the adsorption and activation energies over the Cu-Pd alloy surfaces. It was found that the stable adsorption of H2 occurred on the Pd site over Pd1Cu3(111), and Cu sites were unable to stabilize molecular H2, implying that the dissociation of H2 mainly occurs on the Pd site. However in our work, Cu/SiO2 exhibits obvious activity to convert CO2, implying that the H2 dissociation could also take place without the assistance of Pd. While Cu-Pd/SiO2 shows higher activity than Cu/SiO2, it is inferred that the interaction of Cu-Pd could enhance H2 dissociation. Jiang et al. [5]. investigated the CO2 adsorption and activation over the bimetallic models with varied surface Pd content (Cu/Pd = 1.3–8) by substituting top-layer Cu atoms of Cu(111) with different numbers of Pd atoms. CO2 weak physisorption was found on Cu-Pd or Pd-Pd metal sites. In the activation of CO2, HCOO* species might be a key intermediate for CH3OH formation, while COOH* species might be a key intermediate for CO formation. When the Cu/Pd surface atomic ratio is higher than 1.3, HCOO* formation is more favorable than COOH* formation on both the monometallic Cu and Cu-Pd bimetallic surfaces, while the monometallic Pd surface prefers COOH* formation rather than HCOO*. In this work, the surface Cu/Pd atomic ratio is 54 for Cu-Pd/SiO2 obtianed by XPS analysis; however Cu/SiO2 and Cu-Pd/SiO2 both exhibit higher CO selectivity than Pd/SiO2. The inconsistency from the DFT results may stem from the unrealistic model. Over the high Cu/Pd ratio catalyst, the sublayers also consist of Pd while the sublayers in the DFT model only consist of Cu, and the real catalysts contain step and corner sites which were not taken into account in the DFT calculation. The sublayers and step/corner sites could also significantly affect the activation of CO2. The interaction between Cu and Pd generates both geometric effect and electronic effect. The electronic effect could be inferred by DFT modelling. Cu-Pd/SiO2 contains Pd1Cu3 alloy phase and Cu monometallic phase, as well as isolated Pd sites. Previous work [26] has verified the electronic effect of the Pd1Cu3 alloy phase; however the electronic effect of the isolated Pd sites remains unknown. Therefore, model surface of Pd-doped Cu (Pd1Cu(111) as shown in Fig. S4) is established for the isolated Pd sites. As shown in Fig. 8 , the Cu(111) and Pd1Cu(111) surfaces exhibit different density of states, verifying the existence of electronic effect. The geometric effect is also present over the bimetallic catalyst, which could be verified by the characterization results that Cu crystalline size is smaller over the bimetallic catalyst than the monometallic catalyst, and that the Pd sites could disperse the Cu sites over the metal particles. The electronic effect may play a role in tuning catalytic activity and product selectivity; however this effect is not significant in the current work. Xiao et al. [4] reported that the alloy phase accounts for the enhancement of methanol selectivity; the alloy phase over Cu-Pd/SiO2 may contribute to the slightly higher selectivity, therefore exhibiting weak electronic effect. On the contrary, the geometric effect prevails over Cu-Pd/SiO2 with regard to the catalytic performance. The geometric effect normally contributes to higher amount of active sites, and leads to higher overall activity. Cu-Pd/SiO2 exhibits mostly Cu-like surface with higher amount of active sites, and meanwhile Pd stabilized the Cu chemical states against CO2 oxidation [27]. In order to eliminate the influence of various experimental conditions, the STY of methanol is compared with the data in literature by the enhancement factor (STYCuPd/STYCu) as shown in Table 3 . The optimum Cu/Pd ratio of ~2 was reported for methanol synthesis; with increasing Cu/Pd ratio up to 6.7, the methanol formation rate decreases [5]. However, the current study verifies that the methanol formation rate does not follow a monotonic relationship with the Cu/Pd ratio. The enhancement factor falls between the Cu/Pd ratio of 2.9 and 6.7. This indicates that by adding a small amount of Pd could enhance the performance of Cu-based catalyst."
11,Conclusions,"The surface structure and catalytic properties Cu-Pd bimetallic catalyst with a high Cu/Pd ratio of 33.5 was investigated. The interaction between Cu and Pd results in a better dispersion of both Cu and Pd atoms and facilitates the reduction properties. Moreover, phase separation of Pd1Cu3 alloy and Cu appears over the bimetallic catalyst, while at some part of the catalysts, isolated Pd sites exist over the Cu-rich particles. The Cu-Pd surface resembles the Cu surface however exhibit different electronic properties as evidenced by the DFT results as well as the characterization results. CuPd/SiO2 shows higher activity than Cu/SiO2 mainly due to the geometric effect; the selectivities and the normalized activity are similar for the two Cu-based catalysts, implying that the electronic effect is weak in the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation."
