0,Introduction,"Fuels are in high demand for a variety of activities, including transportation, not only in urban areas but also in rural areas these days. Meanwhile, crude oil prices are rising, and fossil fuel resources are diminishing, all of which have a significant environmental impact. As a result, researchers are currently paying attention to an alternative for fossil fuels in order to meet society's demands through renewable resources. Presently 4.7 percent of the output of liquid transport fuel comes from regenerative sources. Biodiesel, bio-oil, and biogas production are prioritised on this list. [1] According to the 2017 medium-term report on renewable of IEA, global output of biofuels is expected to rise by roughly 16% to higher than 2.7 Million Barrels Oil every day (MMbed) in 2023. Asia is the leading consumer growth for biofuels as a result of growing transport fuel use. Biofuels are the major drivers for biofuel usage in the worldwide transport industry. Brazil, China, Europe and the US, which constitute around 90% of worldwide biofuel use, according to the IEA, are the leaders in biofuels consumption. While Asian consumption will grow in the early 2020 s, several nations across the world take measures to enhance their overall energy mix using biofuels. [2] The concept of biofuel production and use, has been debated for many years, but is less efficient to produce and use because advanced techniques are not incorporated in easy steps[3]. Fermentation, transesterification, gasification, quick and slow pyrolysis are involved. Typically, gasification includes the incomplete oxidation of biomass into high-temperature fuel vapours (>800 °C). It generates a combination of CO, H2, CO2 and certain light hydrocarbons generally using air or steam. The thermal pretreatment of biomass in a temperature variation between 200 and 300 °C in an oxygen-free environment is the torrefaction. [94] Fast pyrolysis is used for procedures with an intensive heat treatment duration of extremely brief residency at 400–600 °C from 0.5 to 3 s. Biomass is quickly cooked to a high temperature when there is no oxygen in the quick pyrolysis process. Typically, quick pyrolysis generates 60 percent to 75 percent of oils with 15percent to 25 percent of the solids (mostly charcoal) and 10 percent to 20 percent of the gas phase according to the feedstock implemented.[4] Since thousand years, slow pyrolysis has been utilised to elevate production of biofuels at small temperatures and poor heating rates. The vapour residence period is therefore excessive (5 min to 30 min) and components continue to react with one other throughout the vapour phase, which leads to solid char and other fluids production.[4]. Catalysts play a very crucial role in all of these processes. The presence of catalysts usually improves the manufacturing process in order to easily access the desired product. There are two classifications of catalysts: homogeneous catalyst bases / acids and heterogeneous base / acid. In the production of biofuels, homogeneous catalysts like KOH , H2SO4 and NAOH are used. However, the disadvantage of using this type of catalyst is that it is difficult to recover and the separation process involves a large number of steps. To overcome this limitation, heterogeneous base/acid catalysts are used. The benefits of using a heterogeneous catalyst include easy separation, little or no corrosion, and low environmental pollution (Wang et al., 2019). Researchers are currently focusing on green catalysts. Green catalysts are those that are made from biomass and are typically inexpensive and reusable. Biochar-based catalysts and nanocatalysts realise researchers dreams of producing biofuels that are both effective and friendly to the environment and society [5,6]. Biochar can be turned into a catalyst for the production of biofuel as a porous carbonate compound formed from different biomass. Biochar-based catalysts are useful because they contain inorganic groups such as K and Fe on their surface, which can be used in tar cracking, as well as other functional groups that aid in the adsorption of metal precursors. As a result, the emphasis is shifted to nano catalysts and biochar-based catalysts. The advantages of using nano and biochar-based catalysts include simple catalyst synthesis, low cost, easy disposal, reusable properties, and increased biofuel yield[3,7,8]. Biochar can be generated from lignocellulosic biomass, non-lignocellulosic biomass, and lignin-based biomass. All of these biomasses are converted to biochar via pyrolysis, carbonization, and gasification. Biochar-based materials and nano catalysts are used for refinery process catalysis, biofuel production, and air pollution control[9,10]. As a consequence, this review provides a clear picture of the purpose of selecting biochar-based catalysts and nano catalysts for biofuel production, as well as the various techniques for producing these catalysts and their effective role as a catalyst."
1,Synthesis techniques of novel nano catalysts,
2,Source,"2.1 Source Nano catalysts are valued for their ease of manufacture, adaptability, unique properties, and, most importantly, their role as a catalyst in the production of biofuels. Magnetic nanoparticles are frequently used in the synthesis of nanocatalysts. Fig. 1 depicts how they are generally classified into four classes. Several modifications are made to the surfaces of nano catalysts in order for them to be effective in biofuel synthesis processes [11,12]. The sizes and techniques of synthesis of various magnetic nanoparticles (Metals, Alloys, Metaloxides, Ferrites) utilised in biofuel generation are mentioned below. 2.1.1 Metals/Alloys based nanoparticles for biofuel production : A few examples of metal-based magnetic nanparticles are Cu-Co, Au/Ag, and Mg/Al. Chen has shown that Cu-Co is active with a catalytic dimensions of 60 nm for direct heating, with reaction rates of up to 99.40 percent[13]. In the same vein Au/Ag with catalyst dimensions of 28 nm was active with reaction rates of up to 86.90 per cent[14]. Deng has shown that the co-precipitation method is used with Mg/Al catalysts with size of 7.3 nm with reaction rates of up to 95,20%.[15] 2.1.2 Metal oxide based nanoparticles for biofuel production : A few instances include CaO,MgO, MgO–AlO3, CaO–Al2O3 based on metal oxide magnetic nanoparticles. CaO or MgO are often doped with base mixed metal oxide to enhance their catalytic activity. The catalysts are showing enhanced activity in the conversion to biofuel. The sol–gel techniques were used to generate the MgO–AlO3 and CaO–Al2O3 catalysts. These catalysts have been shown to be efficient during the transesterification of lipids from microalgae. [16] 2.1.3 Iron based nanoparticles for biofuel production: 90 percent of the response yield was reached with Fe3O4 as a catalyst and 11.2 nm dimension and co-precipitation.[17]Feyzi also produced a ferrite-based Cs/Al/ Fe3O4 catalyst dimension of 30–35 nm utilising the precipitation technique, with reaction yields up to 94.80%. [18]"
3,Techniques,"2.2 Techniques Novel nanocatalysts are created using techniques like co-precipitation, the sol–gel process and metal impregnation. The vast majority of them are solid acid homogeneous/heterogeneous nanocatalysts and solid base homogeneous/heterogeneous nanocatalysts[19]. Table 1 lists recently manufactured nano catalysts derived from various feedstock sources."
4,Characteristics,"2.3 Characteristics For numerous applications, including catalysis, the unique physics and chemical characteristics of nanoscience make nanoparticles highly attractive. Magnetic nanoparticles are characterised by a high volume-to-surface ratio, quantum properties, and other chemicals because of their tiny size. An extra feature of Magnetic nanoparticle is that the particles that are immobilised may be readily removed without harmful impact by using appropriate magnetic fields as a very helpful catalyst [20]. Electronic structure: The energy level of a nanocrystal is distinct, and its density and distance are much bigger and less than the appropriate levels of a single atom or a minute atomic cluster. They are also known as quantum points due to their different amounts of energy. The nanocrystals Valance band (VB) consists of atomic interactions of the highest concentration. [2120] Geometric structure: The structure of nanoclusters is the first and most important problem to be determined. In most situations, the bulk crystallography of a material cannot explain the structures of NPs. When examining nanometric dimensional atomic clusters, they are often thickly packed; consequently, they are anticipated to exhibit high uniformity and consist of atomic shells appropriate to the related symmetry. When interpreting a cluster with a limited atoms, the bonding (maximum compactness) and surface energy should be maximised and reduced. Small groups containing tens of atoms of various shapes (tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron). . [20] . [22] Melting temperature: Because surface atoms are co-ordinatively unsaturated, they have a high surface energy in a system with only a few hundred atoms. The feature that the surface energy in fluid state is always lesser than in solid state is the key to understanding this melting point . Surface atoms move in dynamic fluid phase to reduce area of the surface and undesirable surface links. Strong, solid-state binding geometries create step by step surfaces with edge and corner high energy atoms. The entire surface energy is decreased by melting. The smaller the nanocrystal, the greater the contribution of surface energy to system’s total energy, and greater the melting temperature reduction. The link between the nanoparticles dimensions and melting point strongly verifies the concept that the melting point drops as the particle size falls.[22] The surface of nanoparticles can be changed with acid groups such as –SO3H to produce solid acid homogeneous/heterogeneous nanocatalysts. Solid base heterogeneous nano catalysts were proven to be effective for industrial biofuel production because they can be recycled three to five times. Nano catalysts are unique in that they have stronger magnetic properties, can be easily isolated, recycled. Sulfoalkylating agents increase the surface activity of nano catalysts.[11]. The salinization process, chemical treatments, polymer grafting, ligand exchange technique, and ozonolysis can all be used to increase the pore size of prepared nano catalysts. Since the esterification and transesterification reaction rates are temperature dependent, high fatty acid methyl esters yields are easily obtained. These nanocatalysts are easily recovered from reaction products and by-products, and they can be again used over four times in a row without losing catalytic activity.[23]; Konwar et al., 2014)."
5,Synthesis techniques of biochar-based catalyst,"Given its potential and eco-friendliness, biochar is abundantly used in a variety of fields, especially biofuel production, by modifying its surface. Biochar has recently been identified as a green catalyst for the development of biofuels. Because of the potentials of biochar-based catalyst, it would be a viable alternative to metal-based catalyst and fossil fuel-driven carbon catalyst.[9,24]."
6,Source,"3.1 Source Any simple raw biomass can be converted into useful biochar, which can be used in diverse fields like agriculture, biofuel processing, and catalysis. Contents such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and ash content can differ depending on the form of feedstock. Biochar with a high content of lignin , like pine and spruce wood, will have a high porosity and a strong carbon fixed material , while lignocellulosic biomass with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content will have a high graphite structure and stability.[25]. Examples of lignocellulosic biomass are agricultural wastes, forest residue and non-lignocellulosic biomass are animal and poultry manure, sewage sludge and algae[26]. The kind of biomass used for producing biochar is given in Table 2 ."
7,Techniques,"3.2 Techniques Torrefaction, hydrothermal carbonization and liquefaction, Pyrolysis and gasification are the main techniques used in the processing of biochar, as shown in Table 3 . Torrefaction is a moderate pretreatment process carried out before pyrolysis or gasification at temperatures preceding 200 to 300 °C. The heating process for biomass in the absence of Oxygen, over 300 °C for biochar production, is characterized by pyrolysis. Carbonization of biomass occurs at 300–800 °C in the ancient technique slow pyrolysis, and biochar is obtained as a main product with a 35–50 percent yield. However, it has disadvantages such as high time consumption and poor energy efficiency. The thermal breakdown of low-energy biomass takes place in the rapid pyrolysis process with bio-oil the principal product at temperatures of 400–600 °C.In either case, pyrolysis is a low-cost process with low emissions of greenhouse gases.[9,3]. Slow pyrolysis nevertheless has some technical implications, which have made good quality bio-oil production improbable. The sluggish process of cracking the primary product is a result of a high time spent residing and might have severe effects on the production and quality of bio-oil. In addition, lengthy stay and minimal heat transmission require an additional amount of energy[27,28] Similarly fast pyrolysis also has some technological restrictions • Low thermal stability and oil corrodibility and oil solids • Increased viscosity over time by char catalysis • Char dissolved alkali are concentrated in oil and pyrolytic water generation occurs Hydrothermal carbonization is a process that takes place in a reactor that is shut, at temperatures between 180 and 250 °C when water is present. Hydrothermal carbonization produces biochar with a larger number of functional groups on its surface and spherical particles of micro scale and few pores. In the gasification process, carbon-based feedstock is heated to temperatures greater than 800 °C when steam, air or CO2 are present [3]. The most effective biochar processing methods are slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization that delivers high biochar output. The production of bio-oil and synthetical gas uses generally for flash carbonization, torrefaction and gasification technology.[29–30]. After making minor changes to the surface groups, the resulting biochar proves to be an effective catalyst that can be used in biofuel production. Physical activation, chemical activation, gas activation, metal impregnation, sulfonation, surface amination, and surface oxidation are all methods for activating biochar.[10]. Physical activation of biochar is done by gasifying agents such as CO2, steam exceeding temperature 700 °C to boost the pore size and area of surface. Chemical activation of biochar is done by adding activators such as alkali metal activators, H3PO4, H2O2, ZnCl2 and K2CO3 [31]. This form of activation can result in active pores even at low temperatures. Another process for producing porous biochar by hydrothermal carbonization is nano casting[3]. Metal compounds co-calcinated biomass like platinum, copper, and ruthenium is performed by the process of impregnation of metals to bind metals atpowered positions on biochar. Sulfonating is a surface activation method in which biochar with both strong and weak sulfonic acid groups can improve catalyst efficiency in acid-driven reactions. Sulfonation can be used to create solid-acid catalysts. Steam treatment can also be used to enable biochar by heating it for 1 h at 700–850 °C[10]. Catalysts for biochar can be made using one of three methods: one-step, two-step, or preformed metals are covered with biomass, and carbonized."
8,Characterization,"3.3 Characterization Biochar-based catalysts are favored because they produce a very good metal support interaction between the metal and the carbon. It has the ability to regenerate, to provide continuous operation and effectiveness at high temperatures, and it is also inexpensive and suitable. The biochar's surface functionality results in catalytic efficiency. Its catalytic activity in tar cracking is primarily due to inorganic groups such as potassium and iron.[7,32,10,3]. Catalytical activity in biochar is influenced by factors such as pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis duration, transition metals and biomass to water mass ratio. Biochar-based catalysts are thermally and mechanically stable, have a stable structure, are chemically inert, and biodegradable[33,34]. Fig. 2 depicts the methods used to prepare biochar and biochar-based catalyst. Modification is done by gasifying agents such as steam, CO2 for physical modification and by activators such as H3PO4, ZnCl2, H2O2, alkali metal activators for chemical modification. 3.3.1 Characteristics of diverse biochar catalysts Heterogeneous biochar catalysts are easily distinguishable from other reactant mixtures. Bifunctional catalytic agents Processes both esterification and transesterification. Reuasble type biochar catalysts can be used more than once .Highly porous biochar catalsyst have a higher number of pores on their surface. Even when exposed to high temperatures , non –graphitizable biochar catalysts do not form crystals (Chi et al., 2020),[35]a)."
9,Novel nano catalysts and biochar-based catalyst in biofuel production,"We are facing increased depletion of fossil fuels due to unplanned use of energy resources for transportation and industry. The use of biologically available feedstocks for biofuel production has gained traction in scientific circles in this regard. At the intersection of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, the use of nanocatalysts is revealing fresh effective ways to manufacture sustainable environment friendly biofuels[36,37]. Their solid state makes them modifiable and their particle size which is nanometric allows them to have high activities comparable to homogeneous catalysts, as well as novel and special catalytic conduct not possible with solids larger than nanometers. In addition, the usage of active magnetic materials has resulted in the creation of nano catalysts that can be recovered using magnetic fields. The most recent advances in the development of highly active, durable advanced biofuels, inexpensive, and recyclable nanocatalysts and biochar-based catalysts are discussed in this context.[38,39]."
10,Biofuel production in presence of nano catalysts,"4.1 Biofuel production in presence of nano catalysts 4.1.1 Biodiesel Biodiesel has proven to be an effective fuel candidate to meet the world's potential demand for power due to its characteristics. Biodiesel's promising specific features include biodegradability, environmental friendliness, low toxic levels, high combustion effectiveness, and lower sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions when burned[40].There are three major classes of feedstock which are relatively quick to plan and protective to the environment is represented in Table 3 and the different strategies for biodiesel production is given in Table 4 . 4.1.2 Bio-oil Because of its high density of energy and easiness of storage or transport compared to gasoline, Bio-oil is seen as an appealing feedstock to replace fossil fuel for generation of power .Bio-oil is also biodegradable, CO2 or greenhouse gas neutral, and contains far less nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide when combusted in an engine than petroleum-based fuel. As a result, bio-oil is a green fuel that is also good for the environment [41]. The main constituents of wood, cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin have distinct bio-mass compositions. The potential of biomass to generate high heating value (HHV) bio-oil is determined by its elemental composition such as Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Sulphur, ash content, moisture content[42,43]. Various kinds of feedstocks used to produce bio-oil are given in Table 5 . The thermochemical techniques used for producing bio-oil is illustrated in Fig. 3 . Thermochemical techniques such as pyrolysis and liquefaction transform biomass into bio-oil .The main difference in the temperature range for pyrolysis and liquefaction are 400–600 °C and 250–400 °C respectively. 4.1.3 Biogas Nanoparticles are dissociated in a controlled manner in an environment in the absence of oxygen and fed to micro biotic organisms that are responsible for depletion of organic matter, a function that they are well suited for. As a result, the production of biogas can be increased by up to 200%[44]."
11,Nano catalyst role in biofuel production process,"4.2 Nano catalyst role in biofuel production process 4.2.1 Biodiesel Researchers have applied numerous catalysts in the development/synthesis of biodiesel, including catalytic acids homogeneous/heterogeneous, uniform/heterogeneous basic catalyst biocatalysts and nanocatalysts. Despite being the method of choice, when oil of low-grade is used, transesterification of acid catalysts requires higher oil molar ratios of alcohol[45]. Because of its reusability, wide availability, ease of separation from product, and longer life time, transesterification using heterogeneous base catalysts has been found to be cost effective in mild conditions[46,47]. However, solid alkaline catalysts must be extensively investigated and optimized in order to minimize saponification and overcome diffusion limitations, resulting in higher yield. In comparison to acid-catalyzed transesterification, base-catalyzed transesterification is extensively used in industrial output because of the high fatty acid methyl esters yield in a brief reaction time[48]. Recent biodiesel production formed with ionic liquids that are supported by nanoporous materials with special focus on the use of IL-nano porous materials tunable characteristics.[49]. To have a more environmentally friendly process and meet environmental needs, enzyme catalysts must be created. The process has the ability to produce a high-quality commodity comparable to Petro-diesel fuel which highlight the use of carbon-oriented catalysts to produce biodiesel from carbohydrate or biomass precursors[50]. Table 6 highlights the comparison of homogenous/ heterogeneous/bio/nano catalysts. Various nanocatalysts such as zeolites, single metal oxides, hydrotalcite, and assisted alkalimetal/metalion have been shown to have high biodiesel production performance. Metal-oxide catalysts mixed with solids are those that have more than two metal oxides in their composition.[51] To improve catalytic efficiency, metaloxides mixed with base catalysts are usually coated with MgO or CaO. In the development of biodiesel, catalysts are very active. The use of raw materials with free fattyacid content is considered important in these catalytic processes; otherwise, base catalyst poisoning will occur.[52]. In transesterification, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and sodium methoxide are utilised. It is an alcohol-oil reaction that occurs in the collaboration of a base catalyst. To get the best biodiesel yield, reaction temperature is maintained at 500–600 °C. The temperature of reaction should be below than the point of boiling of methanol. Methanol will otherwise be discarded due to vaporization. The stirring method with 1300 rpm is used in the process to increase the rate of reaction through dynamic mixing. It will take nearly an hour to complete the reaction [53]. Catalysts used in transesterification process, co-precipitation process and mixing process are shown in Tables 7– 9 respectively. To begin with prepare a two-component complex carrier, the use of co-precipitation is to create elevated acidic or simple catalysts. To make a mesoporous basic nanocatalyst, the carrier is impregnated with a solid salt. This method produces nanocatalysts that easily detach from the final product[54]. Metal oxide mixture catalysts are made by mixing metal oxide mixtures. Oxides are combined with a significant amount of the active component such as metals. This results in a catalyst with a less surface area and more basic active sites concentration. Impregnation is often used to ensure the formation of more active catalysts. Mixed oxide of Calium and Nickel , for example, was first packed as a carrier before being impregnated with KF to create an improved nanocatalyst[55]. 4.2.2 Bio-oil In general, bio-oil is strongly acidic pH of 2–3 and oxygenated. As a consequence deoxygenation of bio-oil is needed to boost its properties, such as lowering acidity and increasing both the higher heating value and stability (Nagoles-Delgodo et al., 2020). The oxygenates in bio-oil vapors would be catalytically converted simultaneously with pyrolysis in catalytic quick pyrolysis (CFP).[56])published a comprehensive analysis of catalytic quick pyrolysis, highlighting the importance of the catalytic reactions that may occur in catalytic quick pyrolysis. HZSM-5 is a zeolite catalyst that has been extensively researched for catalytic pyrolysis. Nonetheless, the use of the ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst resulted in a reduction in emissions. Thus, less acidic materials may be more beneficial in upgrading bio-oils[57]. Many studies have recently centered on basic metal oxides in biomass catalytic quick pyrolysis. (Bhandari et al., 2014b). Even when only 5 wt% Calcium Oxide was used, the Calcium Oxide catalyst displayed the most positive acid reduction physical results of the bio-oil among the three catalysts used. The use of CaO, on the contrary, resulted in an gain in water content. Despite the fact that all three catalysts were capable of deoxygenation, the MgO catalyst performed slightly better. The amount of hydrosugars decreased the most and the amount of furan compounds increased after the introduction of 10 wt% MgO catalysts[58]. At 350 °C, different heterogeneous catalysts were used to hydrothermally liquefy the microalgae nannochloropsis sp. Hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae with heterogeneous catalysts, for example, improved product consistency. Except for zeolite, the crude bio-oils formed by these catalysts were easy to flow than the biocrudes produced by noncatalyzed liquefaction [59]. An effective hydrodeoxygenation catalyst on silica combined as a hydrodeoxygenation substratum of cyclohexane in a batch reaction extremely scattered palladium and ultra-fine molybdenum phosphate nanoparticles under mild conditions which gives 100% conversion and 97.5% selectivity. Importantly, using timber and feedstocks from bark, the synthesized catalyst could efficiently hydrodeoxygenate biomass with proven efficiency and oil yields.[60]. 4.2.3 Biogas A documentation was made on the anaerobic digestive process of livestock manure and its effect on metallic oxide productivity and biogas. (Luna del Risco et al). CuO nanoparticles had a greater impact on the experiment beyond the other research compounds. Day 14 is regulated by the whole biogas generated and was reduced by 30% due to a Cu concentrate of 15 mg/L. At concentrations ranging between 120 and 240 mg/L,CuO reduced biogas production by 19 and 60 percent . [61]. Methane formation can be boosted by a iron nano oxide because of the presence of Fe3C and (Fe3O4 NPs).Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of 7 nm were applied to an garbage digester in the absence of oxygen at 100 ppm for 60 days at 37 °C. Methane generation was increased by 234% and 180% increase in biogas production was achieved using nanoparticles[62]. Abdelsalam et al. found that Ni nano particles with 2 mg/L and 17 nm were the most successful nano particleswith methane yield of 78.53% and biogas output of 116.76%. At 28 nm size and 1 mg/L concentrate , CO increased biogas production by 71% and methane production by 45.92%[63]. Gasification of Asphodelus tenuifolius and Chenopodium album using nanomaterials as catalysts. Nanocatalysts made of nickel and cobalt nanoparticles were used to speed up biochemical reactions and generate these products at lower temperatures of 400 °C in a muffle furnace. Biodiesel was found to contain 65.47% esters, indicating that it is of higher quality than commonly processed biodiesel, which contains 15–20% esters. Biogas derived from mixed weed biomass resulted in yield of 3.76% methane, 8.32% propane, 50.16% ethene, 3.12% propyne, and 34.64% methanol, according to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry research. The current findings clearly demonstrated increased quality of the product and efficiency in terms of energy in the gasification of weed biomass [64]. 4.2.4 Advantages of nanocatalysts Nanocatalysts have some distinct benefits compared to normal catalysts, for example an improved mix with reactives and simple segregation from the reaction mix, because of their insolubilities in different solvents. In addition, the catalytic reactions and selection of nanocatalyst is facilitated by the adaptation of the chemical and physical characteristics[65]. Nanocatalysts use can contribute to better energy and economic efficiency. For example, a cellulose hydrolysis nanocatalyst has been shown to be stable, economical, very active, and selective. Nanocatalysts have also been used to achieve much lower chemical waste and an improved use of feedstock. In the light of the many potential benefits of nanocatalysts, refineries, petrochemical plants, pharmaceutical industries, chemical industry, food processing and environmental applications have been applied. The worldwide nanocatalyst market is projected to hit 6 billion USD by 2019, according to the Global Industry Analysts.[66] 4.2.5 Disadvantages of nanocatalysts In contrast to conventional catalysts, the risks of nanomaterials have not been systematically characterised and the safety standards for using such catalysts are generally lacking which causes nanotoxicity to humans and ecosystem. Almost all nanocatalysts generally generate both in vitro and in vivo harmful effects at a particular level. The main reasons for nanotoxicity seem to be Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and cell signaling disturbances. Furthermore, the toxicity of nanoparticles is determined by the variables of particle size and the surface functionality. (Polshettiwa et al.,2010)"
12,Biofuel production in presence of biochar-based catalysts,"4.3 Biofuel production in presence of biochar-based catalysts Biochar-based materials have recently been researched for refinery catalysis such as syngas cleaning and conversion, biodiesel processing, and air pollution control. Important characteristics can depend on the application, such as particulate pressure, porosity and composition of minerals[9,67]. 4.3.1 Biodiesel/Bio-oil Biodiesel has been generated using biochar-based catalysts. Esters are biofuels made from free fatty acids, alcohol and glycerides. Bio-oil formation process is shown in Fig. 4 . Dong et al studied that for three runs at 100 °C, sulfonated biochar maintained a high free fatty acids transition of 97–98 percent from 19 distilled microalgal oil in methanol. Major chlorophyll and phospholipids in specific biomass, such as microalgae, can impair the catalyst and reduce biodiesel efficiency, so they have to be extracted beforehand. [668]. These findings demonstrated the biochar catalyst's suitability for biofuel production through esterification. Another study found that after sulfonation by 99% H2SO4, powered carbon had elevated esterification activity than biochar catalysts which has 97 vs 70% conversion, owing to the more volume of pore. [69]. The transesterification method is more reliant on heavy Bronsted acidity than esterification. Fuming H2SO4-modified biochar with more –SO3H groups resulted in significant amounts of products, a match for gross biodiesel output of 10%[6]. It was also discovered that as the area of the catalyst surface increased, so did the output. This suggests that energy supply will boost transesterification activity, which may be related to triglyceride miscibility in methanol at elevated temperatures. It was shown that after sulfonated biochar was used to pre-esterify microalgal oil, CaO was applied for subsequent transesterification, resulting in a 99% fatty acid methyl ester yield. It is easier environmentally friendly to use biochar made from biomass rich in CaCO3. According to an optimization and kinetic analysis, the latter can produce nearly 100% fatty acid methyl ester under ideal conditions[68,70]. 4.3.2 Biogas Tar reformation involves converting a hydrocarbon blend including phenolic, olefin and polycyclic aromas that will inevitably become useful syngas during biomass and pyrolysis gasification. Biochar, along with traditional catalysts, can be efficient for the tar reform, including calcium magnesium carbonate dolomites, olivins.[71]. Hydrogen is another sustainable alternative to fossil fuels given its minimal emissions, which may be created by biogas reforms. During biomass pyrolysis/gasification, Biochar improves the hydrogen generation. [72]. Biogas production using gasification of different lignocellulosic biomass has been addressed in Fig. 5 . The addition of unmodified biological biochar as catalyst during the pyrolysis of microalgae facilitated the synthesis and selectivity of hydrogen by 1.37 and 1.59 and is seen in Table 10 . respectively. 4.3.3 Advantages of biochar based catalysts The goal is to make the production of biofuels ideal for low costs, broad-scale areas, functional group adaption etc. as a heterogeneous catalyst. Biochar has a robust structure, outstanding thermal and mechanical stability, chemical hierarchies of the biomass structure are not very inherent to biochar as a superior catalyst for diverse catalytic applications. Biochar is also very stable. [3] Biochar based catalysts may be i) easily isolated from other reactive compounds ii) bifunctional catalytics i.e. esterification and Transesterification iii) extremely porous (iv) not crystal forming even when exposed to high temperatures. Biochar stands high, because of its low cost, eco-friendly, easy manufacturing method, re-usability and biodegradable compatibility in comparison with other commercially available, strong catalysts.[73] 4.3.4 Disadvantages of biochar based catalysts Disadvantages include i) Research data are only limited available, ii) Process control is relatively complex, iii) High operating temperatures, iv) Energy intensive drying before pyrolysis, v) The necessity to treat flue gas vi) The vapour phase lose of Nitrogen vii) Potential organic contaminant formation in biochars, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furan[73]"
13,Future perspectives,"In spite of many applications, biochar-based catalysts and nano catalysts development are still found in early stages only. So, there is a need for developing a method that can increase catalytic performance. In order to build up in a large scale, researchers are focusing on the modification that can be carried out in biochar-based and nano materials for their application in future fields including catalysis, energy storage and conservation, environmental pollution and even in chromatographic separation [74]; Mian et al., 2019). i) New species or biomass can extend the spectrum of accessible raw materials in biofuel production (including algae, mushrooms, yeast and other microbes). [3] ii) In addition, it was noted that during development of NBCs the researchers focused mainly on Fe3O4 NMs. Additional new magnetic materials like ferrofluids can be explored for the same results. iii) Toxicological issues regarding nano catalysts, on the other hand, are a hot topic of debate, and overcoming the toxicity effects will necessitate comprehensive research in future.[75] iv) In addition to this, the industrial manufacture of biochar-based catalysts in a biomass refinery may be linked with the biofuel production, to ensure a more integrated and sustainable use process of biomass. However, most case studies have not conducted a comparison between the synthesised biofuels and the conventional fuels. This component of research should also be focused in future since this characteristic is important in order to gain an insight into the functioning potential of prepared biofuels.(RuiShan et al., 2020) v) At the level of laboratory study are still biochar catalysts. For future industrial application, a purpose-based synthesis and modification is required. This may be done through the combination of sophisticated material characterisation and theoretical catalytic mechanism simulation. vi) Secondly, the impact of experimental parameters and feedstock on the characteristics of the resulting biochar is equally crucial to disclose. This study is highly tough because of the complex composition of biomass and the intricate method of biochar production. A crucial role is expected to be played by advanced characterisation technologies like Pyrolysis, Gas chromatography, Mass spectrometry and Thermogravimetric analyzing. [3] The development of catalysts can meet at least one of these objectives: (1) the more efficient production of biochar by lowering the reaction temperature or duration; (2) the production of biochar with the desired properties in one pot rather than in two phases, in the form of synthesis, modified and modified. In future, hopefully, a catalyst can in one step translate biomass into biochar in order to generate biochar-supported catalysers, with the necessary functional groups and pore structure and subsequently mix them with biochar. [76] To accomplish all of these, three main areas must be prioritised. i. The need for a more efficient method of fine-tuning the surface functionality, porosity, and composition of biochar. ii. Creating an eco-friendly and effective tuning system iii. Investigating surface functionalization mechanisms and the relationship between surface functionalities and catalytic functions in biochar.[77,78]."
14,Conclusion,"Nano catalysts have the ability to improve overall performance in biofuel and biochemical production. They have a large region and catalytic functionalities, which aids in the resolution of issues like resistance to mass transfer, accelerated disabling and inefficiency. Overall, the nano catalysts are important not only for producing commercial biofuel, but also for manufacturing, through the flexible bio-refinery model, cellulosic combustibles, green chemicals and other bio-based materials. The latest nano catalysts have many benefits, including their ability to improve the performance of heterogeneous traditional catalytical approaches as the best catalyst for heterogeneous catalytic analysis. Nanocatalysts used in biofuel processing are numerous in terms of toxicity, but there is no question that further extensive study is necessary on the toxicity of different biofuel nano catalysts. Nanoparticles have the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively revolutionise biofuel production in order to meet the next energy demands. The cost of the synthesis of nanoparticles must also be weighed in order to produce economic biofuels. This expense could modify the whole manufacturing process of biofuels."
