0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, and they are becoming increasingly scarce. In addition, their combustion products contribute to global warming [1]. Due to these problems, researchers are looking for possible sources of energy to replace these fuels. Of the several existing alternative energy sources, thermonuclear, solar, wind and geothermal energy can be highlighted. However, hydrogen remains the best alternative due to its unique characteristics compared to other fuels [2]. The biological production of hydrogen can use the organic fraction present in wastewater and is less harmful to the environment because it does not consume fossil fuels [3]. The production of hydrogen from this type of process can occur in two ways, photosynthesis and fermentation. The latter is technically simpler because the hydrogen (along with volatile acids and alcohols) is mainly derived from the carbohydrates present in wastewater, it requires no light or pure cultures, and the operating costs are relatively low [4]. Several factors, such as temperature, pH, the type and operating conditions of the reactor, the form of inoculation, the inoculum source, the treatment of the inoculums (thermal, acid or alkaline), and the characteristics of the wastewater, are known to affect hydrogen production in anaerobic reactors [5]. The degree of back-mixing is one of the main factors that affect hydrogen production because it affects reaction rates and mass-transfer fluxes. The degree of mixing can be altered in a fixed-bed bioreactor by changing the external circulation of the liquid phase. The flow patterns in fixed-bed reactors, which are intended to behave as plug-flow reactors, can be changed into mixed flows by applying liquid recycle rates (R). According to Levenspiel [6], the recycle reactor is a convenient method for approaching a mixed flow with what is essentially a plug-flow device. Besides to provide the achievement of different degree of back-mixing in a fixed-bed reactor, recycling affects the mass transfer rates from the bulk liquid to the biocatalyst and the liquid-to-gas mass transfer, mainly for poorly soluble gases, such as hydrogen [7]. While the liquid-to-solid mass transfer resistances can reduce the organic matter uptake rates and worsen the performance of the reactor [8], the liquid-to-gas mass transfer resistance may result in the over-concentration of poorly soluble gases, such as hydrogen, in the liquid medium. The positive effect achieved by increasing the degree of mixing in packed-bed reactors can be contrasted with the disadvantage of having a mixture when the desired product is an intermediate in the reaction, such as hydrogen. The quantitative treatment of irreversible reactions in series in ideal reactors demonstrates that plug-flow reactors always require less time than mixed reactors for achieving the maximum concentration of the intermediate. Moreover, the maximum obtainable concentration of the intermediate in a plug-flow reactor is always greater than that which is obtainable in a mixed reactor [6]. Thus, by considering the conflicting effects of altering the degree of back-mixing in the reactor, this study hypothesized that a fixed-bed reactor has an optimum operating point for the flow pattern, which will maximize the production of hydrogen. This optimum point can be achieved by varying the recycle ratio that is applied to the bioreactor. In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the recycle ratio on the biological hydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor fed with sucrose-based synthetic wastewater. This study aimed to achieve the optimum operation point as a function of the degree of back-mixing in the reactor."
1,Material and methods,
2,The up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor,"2.1 The up-flow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor This study was performed in a bench-scale anaerobic fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 1 ). The reactor was built using acrylic tubes with an inner diameter of 80 mm, an outer diameter of 88 mm and a length of 750 mm, a bed volume of 2.5 L and a total volume of 3.5 L. Each reactor was divided into three compartments (the entrance of the influent, the effluent exit and the fixed-bed), which were separated by a stainless steel mesh (5-mm aperture) that was fixed using 5-mm rods made from the same material. The reactor was fed using a positive displacement pump (Prominent® Concept Plus), and the liquid was recycled from the top to the bottom of the reactor using the same type of pump."
3,The support material for biomass immobilization,"2.2 The support material for biomass immobilization The material used to attach the biomass was recycled low-density polyethylene, a non-porous material with a surface area of approximately 7.94 m2 g−1."
4,Synthetic wastewater,"2.3 Synthetic wastewater The reactors were fed with a synthetically prepared affluent, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 2000 mg L−1, sucrose (1781.24 mg L−1)as the main carbon source, urea (11.50 mg L−1)as the nitrogen source and an optimal carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 140, as determined by Rojas [10]. Micronutrients were amended according to Del Nery [9], as: nickel sulfate (0.50 mg L−1), ferrous sulfate (2.50 mg L−1), ferric sulfate (0.25 mg L−1), calcium chloride (2.06 mg L−1), cobalt chloride (0.040 mg L−1), selenium oxide (0.036 mg L−1), potassium phosphate monobasic (5.36 mg L−1), potassium phosphate dibasic (1.30 mg L−1) and sodium phosphate dibasic (2.70 mg L−1). In addition, sodium bicarbonate (500 mg L−1) and hydrochloric acid (0.45 ml L−1/10 mol L−1) were added to adjust the influent pH to 6.5."
5,The inoculum,"2.4 The inoculum The inoculum was obtained by the natural fermentation of the feed, which was prepared with tap water, and stored in an open container for three days. This process favored the fermentation of the feed by the microorganisms present in the atmosphere [11]."
6,The operation of the reactor,"2.5 The operation of the reactor Before starting the operation of the bioreactor, hydrodynamic stimulus–response studies were performed for a wide range of recycle ratios (R), which are the relationships between the flow rates of the liquid returned to the reactor entrance and the flow rates leaving the reactor, in order to choose a suitable range of R based on the changes in the hydrodynamic pattern. A theoretical hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 h was applied, and recirculation rates of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 were evaluated in abiotic experiments. The reactors were fed with tap water, and the flow patterns were assessed by analyzing the response curves obtained from a pulse input of blue dextran, using the technique presented by Levenspiel [6]. The system was operated continuously at a controlled temperature of 25 °C. The HRT was set for 2 h by applying a flow rate of 21 mL min−1, and each experiment lasted for 60 days."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The flow rate of biogas was recorded using a MilliGascounter (Ritter®) gas meter. The composition of the biogas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane) were determined by gas chromatography (GC 2010 Shimadzu) using a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were maintained at 30 °C, 200 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The concentrations of the organic acids and the solvents were measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 2010, model AOC 5000) and an HP-INNOWax column with a length of 30 m, an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a film thickness of 25 μm. The chromatograph was equipped with a FID (flame ionization detector), which employed the static headspace method with crotonic acid (a standard for the acids) and isobutanol (a standard for the alcohol and acetone) in an acidic medium containing sulfuric acid. The sucrose concentrations were determined using a colorimetric method [12]. The volatile suspended solids (VSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH values were recorded in accordance with the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [13]."
8,Results and discussion,"The recycle ratios that were applied in the experiments were chosen via hydrodynamic studies. The results for the real HRT were 86 min, 75 min, 55 min, 59 min, 56 min and 54 min for R of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Such values are much lower than those that were theoretically estimated, indicating the presence of stagnant backwater, mainly in the entrance of the reactor. To evaluate the flow patterns in the reactor, the tanks-in-series model was adjusted to the response curves and the number of completely mixed reactors in series (N) was obtained (Fig. 2 ). The recycle ratio that was applied in these experiments was chosen by trying to use values that would cover the hydrodynamic behavior from plug flow (high values of N) to perfect mixing (low values of N). The chosen values of R were 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, for which the value of N ranged from 16 to 4. The reactor was not evaluated without liquid circulation, because this condition could not be compared to the others. When the liquid phase is recycled, the feed is subjected to intermediates (organic acids and solvents), other than the primary substrate (sucrose); without the recycle ratio, only sucrose fed the reactor. Fig. 3 depicts the temporal variation of the sucrose conversion (3A), the biogas flow rate (3B), the hydrogen molar flow (3C) and the hydrogen yield (3D). The sucrose conversion showed average values of 67.2%, 79.2%, 70.8% and 70.3% for R equal to 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. As the recycle ratio increased, the liquid superficial velocity in the bed also increased, thereby improving the liquid- and solid-phase mass-transfer fluxes. Thus, the overall reaction rate tends to increase as the mass transfer resistances are reduced. In contrast, as the recycle ratio rises, the hydrodynamic pattern shifts from a plug flow to a mixed flow, with a marked tendency to decrease substrate conversion. Such conflicting phenomena resulted in superior conversion obtained when the recycle rate was increased from 0.25 to 0.5 and decreased with higher values of R. Substrate conversion was used to define the ending of the transient phase and the beginning of the steady-state phase of the process, which occurred at day 23 for each of the experiments. However, the behavior of the gas phase was quite unstable, with the values of H2 and CO2 generation rising to their maximum values and decreasing to zero by the end of the operation. This instability conflicts with the stability observed for sucrose conversion, and this behavior can be related to the development of hydrogen-consuming microorganisms in the reactor. Given that methane was not detected in the gas phase and that the sulfate concentration was low in the synthetic wastewater, it is improbable that the hydrogen and carbon dioxide were consumed by the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Therefore, it is probable that an anaerobic homoacetogenic microorganism is involved in the uptake of H2 and CO2. While operating their reactor under conditions similar to those that were applied in this study, Fernandes et al. [14] and Peixoto et al. [15] concluded that the microorganisms involved in hydrogen production in a fixed-bed reactor belong to the genus Clostridium. However, some microorganisms related to hydrogen production can also use Wood–Ljungdahl pathway to reduce CO2to acetate. Tanner et al. [16] described a species of Clostridium, Clostridium ljungdahlii, an anaerobic homoacetogenable to ferment sugars, other organic compounds, or CO2/H2 and synthesis gas (CO/H2). According to Köpke et al. [17], C. ljungdahlii grows heterotrophically in sugars (hexoses or pentoses), or autotrophically on gases (CO or CO2 + H2). Acetate and methanol are the main end-products from the autotrophic pathway. In fact, the data for the soluble products of the operation with R equal to 0.5, which showed the best hydrogen production results, indicated that the decrease in biogas production coincided with a simultaneous increase in acetic acid production. When comparing the maximum point reached and the last day of operation, hydrogen showed a decrease of about 10.2 mmol L−1 and carbon dioxide showed a decrease of about 6.5 mmol L−1. In turn, acetic acid showed an increase in production of approximately 3.0 mmol L−1 in the same period. These values are based on the stoichiometry of the metabolic pathway used by C. ljungdahlii: (1) 4H2 + 2CO2 → CH3COOH + 2H2O The average (avg.) and maximum (max.) results obtained for the biogas flow rate, the percentage of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the biogas, the hydrogen flow rate, the hydrogen yield and the hydrogen produced are shown in Table 1 . The average values were calculated from the values recorded during 60 days of operation. The influence of the recycle rate on hydrogen generation can clearly be observed in this table. Statistical test ANOVA (ɑ = 0.05) was performed for yield and hydrogen production data. For the hydrogen yield, the F value found was 3.72 while the critical F was 2.70, thus showing that there was a significant difference between the recycle rates tested. This difference was also found for the hydrogen production rate, which showed an F value of 4.38 and a critical F of 2.70. The hypothesis of an optimum operating point for hydrogen production with respect to the degree of back-mixing could be confirmed by correlating the hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) and the hydrogen production rate (HPR) with the number of continuously stirred tanks in series (N), which is defined as a function of recycle rate (Fig. 2). The HPR was obtained by dividing the hydrogen flow by the useful volume of the reactor, which was calculated using a flow rate of 21 mL min−1. This should be applied to the useful volume of the reactor (2.55 L) to obtain the theoretical HRT of 2 h and the real HRT that is obtained in hydrodynamic assays. Fig. 4 depicts the behavior of the maximum values of Y H 2 (4A) and the average value of the HPR (4B) as a function of N. A polynomial function was fitted to the experimental data to obtain an N value that provides the optimum values of Y H 2 and HPR. The polynomial functions were derived to search for the maximum point that could be obtained from an N value of 8, given optimum values of 4.22 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose and 128.13 mL H2 h−1 L−1. This value of N is related to a recycle ratio of 0.6, which was obtained from the relationship between N and R (Fig. 2). Such optimum values correspond to 53% of the theoretical values predicted by the stoichiometric relationships that would be obtained if sucrose was only converted into acetic acid. The optimum operating point was obtained as a conjugation of three factors related to the various degrees of back-mixing to which the reactor was subjected: mass transfer from the bulk liquid to the biocatalyst, liquid-to-gas mass transfer and the kinetic behavior of the irreversible reactions in series. The last factor is influenced by the flow pattern, mainly when an intermediate is the desirable product, as previously discussed. Although the quantitative influence of each interfering factor was impossible to obtain, the sum of all of these kinetic and transport phenomena optimized the process by only manipulating a simple operating parameter, the recycle ratio. The distribution of the intermediate products did not clearly differentiate among the various operation phases. Acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol were the main intermediate products under all the recycle ratios tested, and the first two are indicators of maximum hydrogen production [18] (Table 2 )."
9,Conclusions,"This paper demonstrates the relevant role of the back-mixing on hydrogen production in anaerobic fixed-bed reactors. A value for the degree of back-mixing that optimizes hydrogen production in such reactor was found. There was a tendency to increase the production of hydrogen by increasing the recirculation until a peak was reached, after which the production decreased. The optimum hydrogen yield (4.22 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) was obtained for an R of 0.6 when the reactor behaved as 8 continuous stirred-tank reactors in series. This point was inferred from an empirical mathematical model as a result of mass transfer and kinetic effects due to the application of various degrees of back-mixing. The reduction in biogas production observed in all of the operation phases may have been caused by the presence of anaerobic, homoacetogenic microorganisms, which are involved in the uptake of H2 and CO2."
