0,Introduction,"Chitosan, an amino polysaccharide also known as deacetylated chitin, is the second abundant natural polysaccharide in nature which can be widely found from the shells of crabs and shrimps [1]. In resent year, chitosan has captured much attention for applications ranging from biocompatible coatings to drug delivery systems due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity. Additionally, the versatile pH-dependent solubility, abundant reactive groups (eg. hydroxyl and amino groups) and great film-forming properties make chitosan the most promising natural biopolymers. Therefore, massive efforts have been devoted for the approaches to rapid produce the chitosan-based composites with controllable structures [2] and functions [3], such as direct casting, spraying and filtration, physical or chemical deposition, etc [4–6]. Among these, electrodeposition as one of the most popular versatile approach has been proposed to controllably form a chitosan film on a conducting substrate [7,8]. The short imposed electrical signals can be employed to direct assembly of chitosan and yield hydrogel film with spatially varying structure and properties based on the electrochemical reduction induced pH gradient near the cathode electrode surface [9,10]. Owing to these significant features of electrodeposition, there has been a continuously growing interest in utilizing chitosan biopolymeric coating specifically for improving the biointerface of medical implants. In our previous study, the use of chitosan and other biopolymeric films from electrodeposition often limited with poor mechanical strength, low entrapment efficiency and sudden release behavior, which significant affect the therapeutic efficacy and long-term application of the film in drug release systems. To address these problems, co-deposition of chitosan with various inorganic materials, eg. 0D materials for the mesoporous silica nanoparticle [11], bioactive glass [12]; 1D materials for the hydroxyapatite [13], carbon nanotubes [14]; 2D materials for the layered double hydroxides [15] and graphene oxide [16] has been proved to be an effective way for enhancing their bioactivity, thermal, mechanical, corrosion resistance and barrier properties. Particularly, nanofiber-based materials with unique one-dimensional nanostructure that always been considered as advanced and effective reinforcing materials due to its large length to diameter ratio, high surface area, large porosity and excellent mass permeability [17,18]. By integrating nanofiber into polymer films, it is possible to obtain better interaction filler matrix, and usually result in a large matrix/filler interfacial area, which changes the molecular mobility, the relaxation behavior, and the consequent thermal and mechanical properties of the polymeric films [19]. Screen et al. have reported the tensile strength and modulus of the Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel film were significantly improved by incorporating with short fibers of poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) in the PEG bulk hydrogel matrix [20]. Yingyi Liu et al. have demonstrated that the electrospun nanofibrous membrane also can be integrated onto a microfluidic chip to confer higher protein absorption property for multiple immunoassays [21]. Despite the versatility of electrospinning method and may incorporate most of the nanofiber-based materials, the drawbacks of time-consuming and specific requirement of high-voltage limit its application in industry [22,23]. Thus, a green and versatile approach to allow massive preparation of poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE) nanofiber has been developed by our group [24,25]. The PVA-co-PE nanofiber was fabricated by using the cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) as the immiscible matrix through a conventional co-rotating twin-screw extrusion equipment which is able to be prepared in a large scale. The PVA-co-PE as a commercial polymer possessing abundant active hydroxyl groups has been widely applied in the fields ranging from smart wearable devices to electrochemical sensors [26–28]. Therefore, coupling of the PVA-co-PE nanofiber and facial electrodeposition approach with the expectation to the massive production of nanofiber reinforced chitosan nanocomposite films for the industry application. As illustrated in Scheme 1 a, we demonstrate that chitosan can mediate electrodeposition of the PVA-co-PE nanofibers at addressable locations to form a nanocomposite film with specific shape that corresponding to the conductive substrates. In this work, the films with different content of nanofibers were prepared, and the structure and properties of the nanocomposite films were fully discussed. The nanofibers were well incorporated throughout of chitosan film. Importantly, the electrodeposition process was achieved from mild condition and thus allows protein (eg. insulin) to be loaded and then electrochemically guided release from the deposited films (Scheme 1b) indicating the great potential application in drug control release system. In summary, we believe the significant of this work is the broad concept of transducing the electrical signals into multiple biology information: i) supramolecular structural information (eg. complex fiber/polymer architecture); ii) optical information (eg. cumulative release of protein molecules) for the short-term purpose of providing a generic approach to assemble nanocomponents into functional device and long-term bridging the information processing capabilities of electronics and biology."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan with a degree of deactylation of 85% (molecular weight 200 kDa) and PVA-co-PE (44% ethylene unit) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CAB (butyryl content 35–39%) was purchased from Acros Chemical Pittsburg, PA, USA. All other reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of PVA-co-PE nanofibers,"2.2 Preparation of PVA-co-PE nanofibers In briefly, the PVA-co-PE nanofiber suspensions were prepared following a melt phase separation method according to our previously reported work [29]. Firstly, the blended PVA-co-PE and CAB pellets (w/w = 20/80) was fed into a Leistritz corotating twin-screw (18 mm) extruder (Model MIC 18/GL 30D, Nurnberg, Germany) with a feed rate of 12 g/min. Twin-screw extruder processing temperature parameters ranged from 190 to 230 °C. Secondly, extruded the blends with a draw ratio of 25 (the area of die cross section to that of extrudate) and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the continuous yarns of PVA-co-PE nanofiber was prepared by the Soxhlet extraction of CAB matrix via acetone for 24 h. After being dried, the prepared nanofibers were dispersed in water with a high speed shear mixer for 6 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Details of the fabrication process were schematically showed in the supporting information (Fig. S1)."
4,Electrodeposition of chitosan/PVA-co-PE nanocomposite film,"2.3 Electrodeposition of chitosan/PVA-co-PE nanocomposite film Chitosan solution (1%, w/v) was prepared by dissolving chitosan flakes in dilute HCl to achieve a final solution with pH about 5.5 as described previously, and filtering with a porous glass filter (~40 μm) to remove undissolved particles. Vary amounts of PVA-co-PE nanofibers were added into chitosan solution and stirred for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous mixture with the fiber concentration of 1 w/v %, 1.5 w/v %, 2 w/v %, respectively. The electrodeposition was carried out by using a CHI620E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, TX) with a titanium plate (1 cm × 2 cm × 100 μm) as a working electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode. The titanium plates were cleaned by acetone, alcohol and water consecutively under sonication for 5 min before the deposition. In initial experiments, we partially immersed the two electrodes into the blends to a depth (H) of 0.8 cm and applied a cathodic potential to obtain a constant current density of 20 A/m2 for 5 min. The resulting films from the blends with fiber concentration of 1 w/v %, 1.5 w/v %, 2 w/v % were coded with CS/NF1, CS/NF1.5, and CS/NF2, respectively. The bare chitosan film (coded as CS) was prepared by the same method. The bare PVA-co-PE nanofiber film (coded as NF) prepared by a high-pressure assisted spraying method were used for experimental comparisons. After electrodeposition, removed the titanium plate from the solution, briefly rinsed with distilled water and then stored at room temperature for the following measurements."
5,Characterizations and measurements,"2.4 Characterizations and measurements Morphologies of the deposited films were observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F). The surface chemical group changes were measured by using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Tensor 27, Bruker) analysis with the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Contact angles were tested by the sessile drop method on a Contact Angle System (Dataphysics, Germany KRUSS Co.). All the samples were dried sufficiently before the measurement and the measurements were performed as follows: a dangling droplet of 1 μL of deionized water was carefully deposited on the sample surface for certain times, and the contact angle was recorded by the accompanied software. Each sample measurement was carried out for at least 5 times at different locations and the contact angle was obtained from the average values. Tensile tests of the dried films were measured by a universal testing machine (H5K–S, Hounsfield)) with a tensile rate of 1 mm/min. Swelling ratio (SR) of the deposited film was tested according to a previous reported method [30]. The swelling ratio was determined using the following equations: SR = (W1–W2)/W2 × 100% Where the W1 and W2 are the weight of the film at wet and dry state, respectively. Water permeability was characterized by testing the film under the RO mode. The RO filtration apparatus applied is a stainless steel cell with an effective film area of 1 cm2. The water permeability coefficient was calculated from the pure water permeation fluxes with a trans-film pressure of 1 bar."
6,Drug release performance,"2.5 Drug release performance For the spontaneous release of protein, the deposited chitosan/PVA-co-PE film was immersed in the PBS solution (0.1 mol/L, pH = 6, 7.4 and 10) and the absorption of protein was measured by UV–vis at each predetermined time. For the electrochemically guided release of protein, the titanium plate coated with deposited film was immersed in 0.1 mol/L PBS solution with a platinum wire used as counter electrode. The electrochemically controlled protein release was activated by applying a specified potential that was described in the text. Furthermore, the “N–P” mode has been employed by using an electrical signal sequence that consisted of 12 rounds of “N” (+3 V for 1 h) and “P” (−3 V for 1 h) steps. For the absorption measurements, 200 μL of the release medium was withdrawn and 200 μL of fresh buffer was added to obtain a constant volume. Each measurement was carried out in triplicate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Chitosan-mediated electrodeposition of PVA-co-PE nanofiber,"3.1 Chitosan-mediated electrodeposition of PVA-co-PE nanofiber In this part, we demonstrate the capability of integrating PVA-co-PE nanofibers onto polymeric film based on chitosan's electrodeposition. Fig. 1 a presents a typical SEM image of the PVA-co-PE nanofibers used in our investigation. Insert figure indicates the nanofibers were fabricated with an average diameter of 320 nm and have a broad distribution ranging from 100 to 600 nm. For electrodeposition, various amounts of PVA-co-PE nanofibers were first suspended into a chitosan solution (1 wt%, pH ≈ 5.5) along with vigorous ultra-sonication to procure well-dispersed suspensions (Fig. 1b). Next, a conventional electrochemical cell was employed to perform the electrodeposition by using a titanium plate (1 cm × 2 cm × 100 μm) as the working electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Finally, a cathodic potential was applied to achieve a constant current density of 20 A/m2 for 5 min. The experimental setup was shown in Fig. 1c. Based on chitosan's unique pH-dependent solubility (pKa~6.3) and great film-forming property, above conditions would allow the amino groups of chitosan to be deprotonated in response to the high localized pH that induced by the electrochemical reduction of water. Chitosan chains would as expected to undergo the sol-gel transition to form a hydrogel film with nanofibers embedded on cathode electrode surface [31]. After deposition finished, the cathode electrode was disconnected from the power supply, removed from the solution, and briefly rinsed with distilled water for several times. The photographs in Fig. 1d show a uniform and fully opaque nanocomposite coating was produced on the cathode surface which seemed mechanically flexible and able to be easily peeled off as a free-standing film. Whereas, as a control, the chitosan film prepared in the absence of nanofibers was observed highly transparent (Fig. S2). This initial experiment provides strong evidence for that chitosan can mediate assembly of nanofiber to the electrode surface. To assess the spatial selectivity of nanofiber electrodeposition, we switched the working electrode from the titanium plate to a letter-shaped one and applied with the same potential, the nanocomposite films with specific shapes that correspond to the topography of the conductive surface are quickly formed (Fig. 1e). Taken together, these results indicate the nanofibers can be well assembled at addressable locations using pH-responsive aminopolysaccharide chitosan and provides a simple approach to construct a free-standing, patterned nanocomposite film."
9,Quantitative study on film growth and transfer charges,"3.2 Quantitative study on film growth and transfer charges Next, we examined the influence of current density and nanofiber concentration on the film growth. Experimentally, after deposition finished, the chitosan-coated electrode was removed from the suspension and immersed in the distilled water where it was imaged by microscopy for the film thickness measurements. To avoid producing more gas bubbles and confirm the uniform film structure, we prepared the films at each specified current density within 10 min. The plots in Fig. 2 a show the growth rate of the deposited film is accelerated at higher current densities, which is well agree with the more rapid cathodic base generation at higher current densities condition. Moreover, the growth rates were observed progressively decrease when the film growth away from the electrode surface indicating the pre-existed thick polymeric coating would influence the further gelation processes. Fig. 2b shows all the films appeared a similar trend that grew continuously with the cumulative transfer charge which is consistent with previous report [32]. Interestingly, the thickness of the deposited film grows rapidly when deposition is performed with dilute nanofiber concentration: presumably there are more nanofibers have been embedded into the thin polymer film and which was supported from the later microstructure observation. Moreover, the slightly decrease of growth rate which can be explained by the excess addition of nanofibers would lead to in a high viscosity of suspensions, low efficient mobility of chitosan chains and restrict the hydrogel formation. To quantitatively analyze how the imposed electrical signal controls the film growth, a previously reported moving front model that provides semi-quantitative framework for chitosan's electrodeposition has been applied [33–35]. Details of the moving front model are schematic illustrated in Fig. 2c. This moving front model is based on several simplifying assumptions: (i) based on chitosan's primary amines conferred unique pH-responsiveness (pKa~6.3) [31], chitosan is modeled as having two states: at low pH the protonated amines make chitosan a soluble polyelectrolyte (as a fully protonated sol state, brown curve) while at high pH the amines become deprotonated allowing chitosan self-assemble into a hydrogel network (as a fully deprotonated gel state, blue curve); (ii) chitosan's neutralization is responsible for gelation and gelation is rapid such that the growing pH-front and growing gelation-front are co-localized; (iii) the charge transfer associated with proton consumption at the electrode is equated to the chitosan's deprotonation (i.e., the added nanofibers are non-conductive that should have little influence on the proton consumption and no other buffering species are present); and (iv) chitosan chains undergo no net migration in response to the electrical field thus the total concentration of chitosan (black curve) is the same everywhere in the bulk solution (More details are provided in Fig. S3). The upper equation in Fig. 2c shows the imposed current is integrated to determine the cumulative charge transfer (Q deposit) that is responsible for the pH front and extent of chitosan's deprotonation (N deposit). The middle equation shows the volume of the film is obtained from the latter imaging of growing film front (N Gel). Importantly, the field-induced chain migration was not considered in moving front model. Thus, the bottom equation may indicate the pH and chitosan's gelation fronts are co-localized. When re-plotted the data from Fig. 2a and b into the moving front model and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. All the samples observed with an approximately linear relation from the moving front model suggesting both of the chitosan and nanocomposite film can be controllable fabricated via the electrical signal inputs. What's more, the slower growth rate was observed from the nanocomposite film and appeared 35% lower to that of the pure chitosan film. This discrepancy could be assigned to the following points: the excess addition of nanofibers would result in a lower efficient mobility of chitosan chains and the field-induced chain migration was not considered in the moving front model. Actually, this model may not suitable for all the relevant physics electrodeposition, however such quantitative operational models are essential for understanding the uncertainties in the underlying physics of polymer networks and polyelectrolytes [36,37]. In summary, we believed above results is encouraging because it does provide a semi-quantitative framework to relate the imposed electrical inputs to the output structure (i.e. deposited hydrogel film) and reveal the potential capability of the idealized moving front model to a complex system of fabricating chitosan-based nanocomposite materials."
10,Morphologies and characterization of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film,"3.3 Morphologies and characterization of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film In this section, we show the influences of embedded nanofibers on the microstructure and properties of the deposited films. For the measurements, the films were peeled off from the electrodes, briefly rinsed with distilled water and then vacuum dried at room tempreture for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the tight nanocomposite film with nanofibers embedded in the matrix is clearly visible from the side view. The average diameter of the entrapped nanofibers shows no statistical difference to that of the pristine fiber presented in Fig. 1a confirms the nanofibers presence with no observable change and side chemical reaction from chitosan gelation process. Additionally, the surface morphologies become coarser and well-defined fibrous morphology were observed from the top view suggest more nanofibers were randomly distributed throughout of the nanocomposite films. Next, the water contact angle tests were carried out to further investigate the wettability of the films and corresponding nanofiber content in each film was quantified from the extraction of the nanofibers by dissolving in alcohol-water solvent (1:1) at 80 °C for 10 min (Fig. 3b). The CS film prepared in absence of nanofiber displayed with water contact angle of about 106° indicating the bare chitosan film is smooth and relatively hydrophobic. The nanocomposite films were observed of a distinct change on the hydrophilicity with the water contact angle decreasing from about 106° to 78°, which correspond to the amounts of nanofiber increasing from 0% to 61.2%. These results indicate that the structure and wettability of the electrodeposited film can be tailored by the contents of the incorporated nanofiber. FTIR measurements were performed to investigate the formation of intermolecular bonds between nanofiber and chitosan chains in the nanocomposite films. As shown in Fig. 3c, the characteristic peaks of both controls were observed in the deposited films. All the nanocomposite films show strong bands at 1325 cm−1 and 1451 cm−1 (–C–H bending vibration), 2852 cm−1 and 2927 cm−1 (–C–H stretching vibration), 3340 cm−1 (–O–H stretching vibration) which are characteristic peaks of PVA-co-PE nanofiber [38,39]. The absorption peaks at 1565 cm−1 and 1652 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of –N–H bond and the peak at 1413 cm−1 is attributed to the amide bonds in chitosan [40,41]. Relatively strong and broad absorption characteristic peaks of PVA-co-PE nanofiber at 3330 cm−1 (corresponds to the –O–H bond) were observed to gradually increased indicating the strong hydrogen bonding were formed between the nanofibers (eg. abundant hydroxyl groups) and chitosan chains (eg. active amine groups) [42]. By incorporating the nanofibers within polymeric network with a complex fiber/polymer architecture is expected to result in a reinforcement of the film mechanical property. Tensile tests of the films at dry state were conducted on a universal testing machine according to the standard of ASTM D5034. As expected, Table 1 shows the tensile strength and elasticity modulus increase accordingly with the nanofiber loading contents, reaching 2.7 ± 0.8 MPa and 2.4 ± 0.6 MPa in the CS/NF2 film, respectively. This reinforced mechanical properties presumably due to the uniform dispersion of the nanofibers within polymer network, as well as the good fiber-polymer adhesion interactions that confer the capability to transfer the load from the polymer chain to the nanofibers and avoid micro-crack formation [43]. In addition, the higher cross-linking density (e.g. physical cross-linking) may formed between the nanofibers and chitosan network through hydrogen bonding, fiber entanglement and interpenetrations. Such internal network junctions could serve as mechanically active physical cross-links to enhanced the mechanically property."
11,pH-dependent permeability of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film,"3.4 pH-dependent permeability of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film The swelling test was conducted to evaluate the film adsorption capabilities. Experimentally, we immersed all the films (1 × 1 cm2) in the 0.1M PBS solution with varied pH values for more than 24 h and recorded the weight changes at each specified time point until the film obtained constant weight. The bare CS and NF films were prepared as controls. Considering chitosan's pH-dependent solubility (pKa≈6.3), as expected, we failed to obtain the swelling ratio of bare chitosan film at pH = 5.5 because of which would gradually dissolve at the low pH condition. However, the nanocomposite films seemed much stable and able to maintain the film structure for more than 30 min in such specific faintly acid environment (Fig. S4). As indicated from the typical dynamic swelling results of CS/NF1.5, the film shows a considerable pH-dependent swelling property (Fig. S5). The swelling capacities were summarized in Fig. 4 a and from which we can observed all the films swell substantially upon their intrinsic moderate hydrophilicity and porous microstructure. As the pH value decreased/increased, the bare chitosan and nanocomposite films both showed distinct swelling ratios while no difference was observed from the bare NF sample. These results indicate the significance role of chitosan polymeric matrix for their pH-dependent swelling properties which is known as the polyelectrolyte effect [44]. The swelling ratios are gradually diminished by successive increasing of nanofiber concentrations could be explained by the higher cross-linking density (eg. hydrogen bonding) formed between nanofibers that would restrict the polyelectrolyte effect of chitosan [45]. In addition, the more nanofibers embedded in chitosan film with the expectation to reduce their permeability. Typically, the water flux measurements of the CN/NF1.5 were carried out by immersing the samples into 0.1M PBS solution with different pH values and allowing the film to swell and attain equilibrium states. Next, briefly rinsed films with distilled water and recorded the average water flux within 5 min under the pressure of 0.1 MPa. As shown in Fig. 4b, the water flux of CS/NF1.5 is progressively increased from 24.9 L*(m2*h)−1 to 30.6 L*(m2*h)−1 with the pH value decreased from 14 to 5. With further decreased the pH, a sharp increase of the water flux was appeared suggests the microstructure of the nanocomposite film has been destroyed in the strong acidic environment. Fig. 4c compares the water flux of the nanocomposite film during four sequential swelling and shrinking steps. As shown, the results in about a fourfold decrease in the water flux were repeatable when switched the solution from the acidic to alkaline condition. The values of water flux at each state did not diminished during the four cycling tests provide further evidence for the enhanced mechanical property and no significant ejection of the nanofiber was observed within the chitosan film. These results reveal that the embedded nanofibers interlaced in the pores and dispersed within the walls lead to a compact film with lower mass transport property and which could be further adjusted by the external pH condition. In summary, the great pH responsibility and tunable permeation property make the nanocomposite film to be a potential candidate for drug control release system."
12,Application of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film on drug release system,"3.5 Application of PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film on drug release system Electrodeposition of polymeric hydrogel film onto the conductive surface has been extensively studied with the advantages of improving the bioactivity and functionality especially for the implant technology. However, owning to the macro-porous internal structure and high water content assigned to the nature of hydrogel film often been limited by the burst release behavior and low drug entrapment efficiency in practical applications. Thus, the insulin with confined particle size was chosen as a typical protein to demonstrate the nanocomposite film's potential application on drug release system. The protein loading process was performed by adding 0.1 wt % insulin into the PVA-co-PE/chitosan suspension with magnetic stirring for a certain time before the co-deposition. The drug loading capacity was evaluated by dissolving the film in HCl solution (pH = 1.2) and then measured by its absorbance at 406 nm. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the amount of protein entrapped per cm2 in the nanofiber-containing film was increased with increased of nanofiber concentrations, reaching to a maximum of 1.38 μg for the CS/NF2 sample (estimated 2.5 folds compared to the pure chitosan film). This phenomenon could be attributed to the strong physical adsorption of protein on the incorporated nanofibers and confined fiber/polymer microstructure. Fig. 5b shows the cumulative release of protein from the nanocomposite films over 24 h. It is obvious to find a burst release from the bare chitosan film, reaching to 52.3% at initial 2 h which is about 30% higher than that of the nanocomposite films. After release over 24 h, the cumulative release of protein from the bare chitosan achieves a maximum of 77.6%, while the CS/NF1, CS/NF1.5, CS/NF2 films are 73.5%, 62.6% and 51.2% respectively. This relatively slow release rate of protein from the nanocomposite film was caused by its compact microporous structure as showed in Fig. 5c, leading to the slow diffusion rate of protein molecules from the nanocomposite films. Numerous studies have proved that the electrochemical method was an effective and green approach to provide acid or alkaline stimuli for controlled drug release from polymeric hydrogel film [46–48]. In this part, we have evaluated the drug release performance of the nanocomposite film triggered by imposing electrical signals. Experimentally, the measurements were carried by immersing the titanium plate with deposited nanocomposite coating into the phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH = 7) and imposing with different potentials. As shown in Fig. 5d, the protein spontaneously released from the film without applied potential displayed with the release rate of 41% in 2 h, which is mainly depends upon the concentration gradient of the film. By contrast, when applied a typical positive potential (+3 V), the protein rapidly released to a maximum cumulative release value of 90% within 2 h. This result could be ascribed to the opened microporous structure induced from the swelling and partially dissolving of the chitosan matrix in the relatively strong acidic condition and allowing for the rapid diffusion of protein from the internal film. As shown in the Fig. 5d, when switching the potential from positive to negative, the cumulative release values of protein within 2 h are significantly decreased from 90% to 36% and 23% with applied a negative potential of −1 V and −3 V, respectively. The relatively slow release of insulin may cause by the shrinkage of nanocomposite film in the alkaline environment provided by the electrochemically hydrolysis of water. Above results suggest the release behavior of the protein can be tailored by the nanofiber loading contents and external stimulus (eg. pH) which could be provided by the imposing electrical potentials. Our final experiment is illustrated in Fig. 6 a, and shows the capabilities of electrochemically guided release of protein from the nanocomposite film along with the use of an externally-applied electric potential to switch the release rate of protein. The alternating potential mode (N–P) was performed by applying the negative potential of −3 V for 1 h (designated “N” step) and then following with a positive potential of +3 V for another 1 h (designated “P” step), and which were conducted for 12 rounds. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, sometimes the measurements of cumulative release were made when a positive potential was applied to allow the swelling and partially dissolving of the nanocomposite film with accelerated release rate of protein. Other times, measurements of the cumulative release were made when a negative potential was applied to trigger the shrinking of the nanocomposite film with substantially restricted release rate of protein. All the experimental results were summarized in Fig. 6b and both showed with an obvious pulsed release patterns of protein associated with the polarity between the two electrodes. The release rates of protein are observed to increase rapidly during each “P” step consistent with the relatively higher permeation property of the nanocomposite film at low pH. During each “N” step, Fig. 6b shows abrupt decreases in the release rate of protein consistent with the relatively lower permeation property of the nanocomposite film at high pH (Fig. 4). Over the 24 h measurement, a steadily increase in the bare chitosan film is also observed consistent with the cumulative release of protein. Overall, Fig. 6 demonstrates that electric potential can be applied to program release of protein from the chitosan-based polymeric film, and the embedded nanofibers can be coupled with the enhanced performance for sustained release of protein."
13,Conclusions,"In this paper, the PVA-co-PE/chitosan nanocomposite film were successfully constructed via a green and facile electrodeposition method. From the microstructure observations and characterizations, the nanofibers were proved uniform dispersed throughout of the film and formed with a novel fiber/polymer architecture. Several measurements have proved that the nanofiber is confirmed to influence greatly on the film structures and properties. On the one hand, the good fiber-polymer adhesion interactions and strength hydrogen bonding confer higher mechanical property to the nanocomposite film: the tensile strength and elasticity modulus increase accordingly with the nanofiber loading contents, reaching 2.7 ± 0.8 MPa and 2.4 ± 0.6 MPa in the CS/NF2 film. On the other hand, combined the filler interaction of complex nanofiber network and the natural polyelectrolyte effect of chitosan matrix, the nanocomposite film showed with great pH-dependent permeation property: the water flux of CS/NF1.5 is progressively increased from 24.9 L*(m2*h)−1 to 30.6 L*(m2*h)−1 with the pH value decreased from 14 to 5. In addition, the mild reaction environment enable the nanocomposite film to be functionalized with the biological molecules (eg. Insulin) through a simple co-deposition approach. Importantly, the film forming process (eg. thickness, nanofiber concentration) is observed linearly correlate to the imposed charge transfer and can be further quantified by using a moving front model suggesting the new possibility to produce the nanocomposites with controllable structures and functions. Importantly, the confined internal micro-porous structure and/or pH-dependent permeability of the nanocomposite film would allow a sustained release of insulin over 24 h, and which can be further regulated according to the imposed electrical signals. Thus, coupling chitosan-mediated electrodeposition of nanofibers with the electrochemically enabled manipulated drug release system provides great possibilities for the multi-functional coatings and drug elution on conductive implants. In summary, we believe the significant of this work is the broad concept of transducing the electrical signals into multiple biology information: i) supramolecular structural information (eg. novel fiber/polymer architecture); ii) optical information (eg. cumulative release of protein molecules) for the short-term purpose of providing a generic approach to assemble nanocomponents into functional device and long-term bridging the information processing capabilities of electronics and biology."
