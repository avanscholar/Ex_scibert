0,Introduction,"The foreseeable depletion of fossil fuels, the increase in their price and the growing concern over global warming in recent years have forced the search for renewable alternatives [1]. Biomass derived fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, are already contributing to the solution, although other non-food-based fuels will be the predominant renewable energy source in the future [2]. Hydrogen derived from any biomass resource (bio-hydrogen) is among the alternatives for use as a transportation fuel. In combustion engines, it has a rapid burning speed, a high effective octane number and no toxicity or ozone forming potential. It is also expected that in the coming years its use in fuel cells will increase significantly [3]. Nowadays, only 5% of hydrogen is obtained from non-fossil fuels such biomass or electrolysis [4]. A promising way and one currently under study is the use of crude glycerol (CG), a byproduct of biodiesel (obtained mainly from oleaginous plants such as canola, sunflower, palm, etc), to produce hydrogen by a steam reforming processes. Steam reforming is the most widely used process to obtain hydrogen-rich mixtures from natural gas [5] and its use to process CG would require few changes in the industrial processes [6]. For all of the above, the production of H2 from glycerol could contribute to solving the significant problem concerning CG final disposal. At the same time, the production cost of biodiesel could be lowered [1,7,8]. Several studies performed with pure glycerol showed that hydrogen production by steam reforming is attained at temperatures between 580 °C and 702 °C, water to glycerol ratios of 9–12 and atmospheric pressure [8]. As in other reforming reactions, noble metal-based catalysts are the most active and resistant to deactivation, but such catalysts are not common in industrial applications because of their high cost [9]. Nickel-based catalysts are particularly attractive for promoting steam reforming reactions because of the high activity of Ni and its lower cost compared with noble metals but they often suffer from coke deposition and metallic sintering leading to catalyst deactivation [10–15]. However, very few studies have been conducted using CG in the feed. This is probably because the catalyst is rapidly deactivated by the impurities contained in the CG. The CG composition varies and is mainly determined by the oil used, the molar ratio of oil and methanol, and the type of catalyst, but it always contains impurities such as water, methanol, inorganic salts from the transesterification catalyst, free fatty acids, mono-, di- and triacylglycerols and fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) making it a low value product [4]. Slinn et al. studied CG steam reforming (CGSR) for hydrogen production over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [16]. A comparison between crude and pure glycerol was established. Hydrogen yield was lower than that obtained with pure glycerol. This is explained by fatty acid impurities that were harder to reform and a higher amount of carbon was deposited onto the catalyst surface. Dou et al. investigated CGSR in a temperature range of 400–700 °C over a commercial Ni-based catalyst with and without in situ CO2 removal by carbonation of calcined dolomite [17]. This in situ CO2 sorption process was effective for removing CO2 and the purity of hydrogen was nearly 90%. Fermoso et al. also studied CGSR with in situ CO2 removal but over Ni–Co catalyst derived from hydrotalcite-like material and calcined dolomite was used as CO2 sorbent [18]. They concluded that the main challenges in this process were carbon formation due to the presence of non-volatile heavy compounds and accumulation of alkaline salts due to the presence of transesterification catalysts in the CG. Remón et al. investigated the effect of acetic acid, methanol and potassium hydroxide on the CGSR [19]. The results show that the aforementioned impurities strongly affect the carbon to gas and carbon to solid conversions, but the composition of the gas was only slightly affected. The nature of the support plays an important role in the catalyst properties including its deactivation behavior. Al2O3 is the most used support in reforming reactions because of its high specific surface area and its mechanical and chemical resistance under the reaction conditions [11]. Nevertheless, several authors have verified the formation of coke deposits over Ni/Al₂O₃ catalysts [11,12]. Other supports tested in nickel-based systems are La2O3 [13], SiO2 [14], ZrO2 [15], activated carbon [20], CeO2 [21], attapulgite [22], sepiolite [14], zeolite [23], SBA-15 [24], perovskites [25], etc. In the case of MeO2–La2O3 solid solutions (Me: Ce or Zr), a high concentration of defects in the structure improves the O2 mobility which can facilitate coke removal and improve catalyst stability [26,27]. In a previous work by our group, Ni–La–Zr (15 wt%) catalysts were characterized and evaluated in pure glycerol steam reforming and showed good performance and low deposition of carbonaceous deposits [28]. The Ni–La–Zr catalyst calcined at 700 °C showed in X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization an amorphous homogeneous mixture of the three metal oxides, while the catalyst calcined at 850 °C showed a biphasic mixture of NiO and La2Zr2O7 phases. This paper is a continuation of that work. In the present study, we report the performance of Ni–La–Zr catalysts that were characterized in the previous studies. Their catalytic activity will be tested using a more realistic feedstock of glycerol that was obtained directly from an industrial biodiesel plant as a by-product. The aim is to evaluate the activity and stability of the aforementioned catalysts using CG without any purification treatment."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts were synthesized by a coprecipitation technique. The selected precursors were: lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3.6H2O, purity: 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, purity: 99%, Merck) and zirconium n-propoxide Zr(OC3H7)4, purity: 70% in 1-propanol, Sigma–Aldrich) which were dissolved in absolute ethanol. Afterwards, anhydrous oxalic acid (purity: 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the mixture. The precipitates were washed with absolute ethanol, dried at 110 °C, and calcined first at 550 °C for 24 h and then for 2 h at 700 °C or 850 °C. The resulting Ni–La–Zr catalysts contained 15 wt% of Ni and a La:Zr atomic ratio 1:1.25. Catalysts will be denoted as Ni-X, where X is the final calcination temperature. For Raman characterization, lanthanum-zirconium mixed oxide calcined at 700 °C (LaZr-700) and 850 °C (LaZr-850) were synthesized using the same technique."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The fresh and reduced catalysts were characterized by XRD using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer working in Bragg–Brentano configuration utilizing CuKα radiation in the 2θ = 20–60° range using Δ2θ steps of 0.02° with an 8 s integration time per step. The Scherrer equation [29] was used to estimate the volume mean primary crystallite size of the La2Zr2O7 pyrochlore oxide and that of the reduced Ni metal phase before and after the CGSR test. Textural properties of reduced and used catalysts were studied by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements at liquid N2 temperature on a Beckman Coulter surface area analyzer (Coulter SA model 3100). The catalyst was degassed at 100 °C for 10 h prior to N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. The specific surface area was calculated from the BET model and the total pore volume was estimated at a relative pressure of 0.98. After use in reforming tests, catalysts were subject to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Shimadzu TGA-50) under 50 mL min−1 air flow with the temperature increasing from 20 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Carbon build-up on the spent catalysts was analyzed for its C and H contents (Termo Scientific Flash 2000). Confocal Raman spectroscopy was performed using a WITec Alpha 300-R confocal Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser wavelength. The laser power used was 30 mW and confocal Raman spectra were collected by averaging a set of 4 spectra of 0.05 s integration time in different areas."
4,Crude glycerol,"2.3 Crude glycerol The main composition of the CG provided by ALUR (Alcoholes del Uruguay) is given elsewhere [20] and it consists of 64 wt% of glycerol, methanol and water lower than 5 wt%, 5.7 wt% of ash (gravimetric method) and 26 wt% of organic matter that is not glycerol or methanol. Potassium methylate was used as the transesterification catalyst. Other CG characterizations were also reported elsewhere [30]. The calculated average elemental molar formula for the CG was C3.5H9.0O3.1 and was used to calculate conversion and yield parameters."
5,Catalytic tests,"A tubular stainless-steel fixed bed reactor (inner diameter = 12 mm, length = 30 cm) enclosed in a temperature-programmed furnace was used for CGSR tests under atmospheric pressure. Fig. 1 a shows the schematic diagram of reaction set-up. Before the test, the prepared catalyst powders were sieved to particles with the diameter of 120–170 mesh. The catalyst bed configuration consists of a 2 g SiC (30–40 mesh) bed placed above 0.2 g of the catalyst. Prior to reaction, the sample was reduced in situ at 650 °C for 1 h using pure H2 flow (20 mL min−1). Following reduction, the hydrogen flow was stopped, and the reactor purged with argon for 30 min. Then the reactor was brought to the reaction temperature under argon. After that, the water:CG solution (30 wt% of CG) was fed at 2.0 mL h−1 with a peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer 74900 Series) through a device that was explained in a previous work consisting of two concentric tubes [30]. Water:CG solution was injected into the internal tube and argon through the external one (Fig. 1b). With this device the solution was sprayed into the catalyst bed. Effluent gas was passed through a cold trap (composed of ice and NaCl) maintained at −10 °C. The gaseous products were quantitatively analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with FID and TCD detectors in series and the columns were Supelco CarboxenTM-1000 and Porapak Q. The experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure with time-on-stream (TOS) of 10 h and a reaction temperature of 500 °C or 650 °C. The steam-to-carbon (S/C) molar ratio was equal to 3.7. Under these conditions the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 20,000 mL h−1 g−1 and WHSVCG, defined as the ratio between the mass flow rate of CG fed and the mass of catalyst, was 3 h−1. Each experiment was repeated at least three times to confirm its repeatability and an average was taken into consideration to calculate performance parameters. The carbon balance was ±5% for all catalytic runs. Carbon balance does not include carbon deposited on parts other than the catalyst, e.g., reactor walls. The stability test was performed at 650 °C under more severe conditions (GHSV = 40,000 mL h−1 g−1 and WHSV = 6 h−1). After 20 h of operation, a regeneration step was performed at 650 °C under 20 mL min−1 of O2 (50%, v/v in Ar) in order to oxidize the carbon deposited. After regeneration step, the catalyst was reduced in pure H2 (20 mL min−1) at 650 °C for 1 h. At the end of reaction, the content of the cold trap was analyzed by an HPLC (Shimadzu Prominence) equipped with a Rezex RHM-Monosaccharide H+ (8%) column and a refractive index detector. Catalytic activity was evaluated in terms of glycerol conversion (XGLY), carbon conversion to non-condensable products (XC,GAS), carbon conversion to liquid products (XC,LIQ), hydrogen yield (H2 yield) and product distribution (on a dry basis) according to the following equations: (1) X G l y ( % ) = 100 ∗ G l y i n − G l y o u t G l y i n (2) X C , G A S ( % ) = 100 ∗ ∑ F C , i ∗ n i F C , I N X C , L I Q ( % ) = 100 ∗ C l i q . p r o d u c t s ( g ) C F E D ( g ) (3) H 2 Y i e l d ( % ) = 100 ∗ ( F H 2 8.4 ∗ F C G ) (4) P r o d u c t s e l e c t i v i t y ( S i ) = 100 ∗ moles of gaseous product i moles of all gaseous product where FC,i is the molar flow of product i (i = CO, CO2, CH4, C2, C3) and ni is the number of carbon atoms in product i. FC,IN is the molar flow of carbon atoms in the CG-water solution fed to the reactor and calculated over the 94.3% of the total weighted amount of CG used for its preparation (5.7% corresponds to the ash fraction determined by calcination). Cliq, products is the total mass of carbon in products retained in the liquid aqueous solution in the cold trap (excluding glycerol). CFED is the total mass of carbon in the CG/water solution fed during the test. FH2 is the molar flow rate of H2 (mol min−1), FCG is the molar flow rate of CG (mol min−1) and 8.4 is the theoretical maximum of H2 per mol of CG according to stoichiometry of equation (5): (5) C 3.5 H 9.0 O 3.1 + 3.9 H 2 O → 8.4 H 2 + 3.5 C O 2"
6,Results and discussion,"Raman spectra (Fig. 2 a) provide structural details of the prepared catalysts which complement those already obtained by XRD and that were reported in a previous work [28]. For LaZr-850 mixed oxide, the Raman spectrum presents four bands corresponding to the pyrochlore-type structured La2Zr2O7, as confirmed by XRD results. One Raman band at 302 cm−1 is the Eg mode associated with O–Zr–O bending vibrations, the A1g mode at 508 cm−1 is associated to Zr–O6 octahedra bending vibrations, and two T2g modes at 397 cm−1 and 590 cm−1 are associated with Zr–O and La–O bond stretching with bending vibrations [31,32]. For LaZr-700 there are no Raman bands between 200 and 600 cm−1, which confirms that no pyrochlore structure were formed at this calcination temperature. A band located at 1080 cm−1 can be assigned to OH bending vibrations and/or symmetric stretching vibrations of carbonates [33]. The Raman spectrum of Ni-850 catalyst showed the presence of the pyrochlore structure and a broad band at 1056 cm−1 probably can be attributed to the oscillation of Ni–O bond in NiO phase, also identified in Ni-700 catalyst [34]. For Ni-700 relatively low intensity bands appear between 200 and 600 cm−1, thus suggesting an incipient process of crystallization that leads to the formation of the pyrochlore. A clear broadening and shifting of Raman bands towards lower wavenumbers is observed for Ni-850 compared to LaZr-850, this probably indicates an increase in localized disorder across the La2Zr2O7 structure. This disorder could be related to the formation of defects in the material as a consequence of the partial substitution of Ni ions into Zr sites due to their similar ionic radius (Ni2+ 0.069 nm vs. Zr4+ 0.072 nm) and the subsequent production of mobile oxygen vacancies [32]. This observation is consistent with the results of XRD analysis that show a slight shift of the pyrochlore peaks (Fig. 2b) to higher two theta values, which was explained by the substitution of a portion of Ni into the lattice of La2Zr2O7. A similar behavior was observed by Haynes et al. in Ni-substituted lanthanum-strontium-zirconate pyrochlores [31]. Table 1 shows the results of CGSR tests with both catalysts at 500 °C and 650 °C. Glycerol conversion, calculated from HPLC analysis of the liquid effluent, is almost complete at both temperatures for the 10 h test. Glycerol is not a thermally stable molecule and its decomposition occurs at nearly 300 °C; so, its amount in the liquid effluent is expected to be negligible [35]. Liquid intermediates such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethane-1,2-diol, propane-1,2-diol were detected for both catalysts at the two temperatures tested. These intermediates were the consequence of decarbonilation and dehydrogenation reactions due to the cleavage of C–C and C–H bonds and were mainly in agreement with those reported in the literature for glycerol steam reforming [36,37]. Carbon conversion to the gas phase is also shown in Table 1. For both catalysts it increases considerably with temperature suggesting that, in addition to glycerol, FAMEs could also react under these experimental conditions and lead to the typical gaseous products of the reforming reactions [38]. Carbonaceous deposits also decrease with the increase in temperature as a consequence of the increase in the reaction rate of carbon gasification with steam and/or the CO2 produced. Comparing the above results with those of pure glycerol steam reforming using the same catalysts and similar experimental conditions [28], lower values of carbon conversion to gas were observed in this work. For pure glycerol experiments XC,gas values were above 99% at both temperatures. At 500 °C, in CGSR experiments, XC,gas was 70.2 and 72.4 for Ni-700 and Ni-850 catalysts respectively. At this temperature reactions involving FAME's can give low volatile polymeric intermediates that remain into the reactor. Increase the temperature to 650 °C allows gasification of the most reactive components (methanol and glycerol) and FAME's could also react under these reaction conditions leading to gaseous products. This lower XC,gas compared to pure glycerol experiments over reaction time was also attributed either to a higher degree of active site poisoning by alkali and/or carbonaceous deposits. In this sense, pyrolysis reactions of CG impurities such as FAMEs lead to coke formation as reported by Dou et al. [17]. Fig. 3 shows H2 evolution as a function of time for the 10 h tests. The SiC bed without catalyst has some activity in glycerol reforming leading to H2 yields not higher than 10%. At 500 °C no significant differences in H2 yield were observed for both catalysts which were in the range of 30–40% and mainly related to dehydrogenation reactions. At 650 °C, Ni-700 allows an initial H2 yield of 88% which continuously decreases until a final value of 60%. On the contrary, H2 yield remains almost constant with Ni-850, thus revealing a higher resistance of this catalyst to deactivation. The best performance for Ni-850 catalyst is consistent with the lower amount of carbon deposits in this catalyst as shown in Table 1. A greater exposure of Ni species and higher nickel reducibility, as observed in our previous work [28], could favor carbon gasification reactions. Oxygen vacancies formed as a consequence of the partial substitution of Zr4+ by Ni2+ atoms during the formation of the bi-phasic system can also have a very important role in gasifying carbon deposits, as has been demonstrated in other studies [39,40]. Indeed, oxygen vacancies are proposed to activate CO2 and H2O, favoring their reactions with carbon to yield gas products (CO, CO2, H2) [41]. Gaur et al. [42] explain this phenomenon based on the reduction of the bond energy of La–O and Zr–O lattice bonds, which results in the release of oxygen from the lattice. Fig. 4 shows the product distribution obtained in the reforming tests. The main products for both temperatures were H2, CO2, CO and CH4 as expected from thermodynamics calculations [43]. The increase in the reaction temperature allows the increase of CO and the decrease of CH4, which is consistent with the shift of the equilibrium position of the exothermic water gas shift reaction ( C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 ) and the endothermic methane reforming ( C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + 4 H 2 ) . The same behavior is observed when comparing Ni-700 and Ni-850 catalysts (Fig. 4b), thus confirming the greater ability of Ni-850 to catalyze the various reaction paths of the mechanism and mainly methane steam reforming. Light hydrocarbons (ethylene, ethane, propylene and propane) were also present in the effluent gas. These can be produced by thermal cracking of the glycerol molecule or by cracking of fatty acid chains. The lowest content of light hydrocarbons with Ni-850 also reveals the better reforming performance of this catalyst. Spent catalysts were analyzed by TGA experiments and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . The weight loss is due mainly to the combustion of carbon deposits. As can be seen in the derivative TG curves (dW/dT) of the inset figure, three stages of carbon removal were observed: one at a low temperature range (200–350 °C), the second in the range (350–500 °C) and the last one at a high temperature range (550–750 °C). It is well known that carbon chemical reactivity is highly affected by its structural properties with amorphous carbon being the most reactive and graphitic being the least reactive. In the case of amorphous carbon, its oxidation takes place below 550 °C, while more crystalline carbon does it at higher temperature [44,45]. Carbon deposition in steam reforming reactions is a quite complex process because different mechanisms may be responsible for carbon formation. In particular, in glycerol steam reforming, several reactions play a fundamental role for example, glycerol decomposition, glycerol oligomers formation and production of carbon precursors such as acetol, acrolein, acetaldehyde and ethylene [46]. The first combustion stage at low temperature could be attributed to the existence of organic fragments on the catalyst surface. The second one is usually associated with highly reactive carbon species closer to the metal particles or amorphous carbon [47]. The third stage could be attributed to filamentous and graphitic carbon [48]. TGA results show that significant carbon deposition occurred in both catalysts. Nevertheless, Ni-850 derivative peaks are shifted towards a lower oxidation temperature indicating less ordered carbon than the Ni-700 catalyst. Raman spectroscopy was also used to investigate the formation of carbon on used catalysts after 10 h of TOS (Fig. 6 ). The presence of two bands in the range between 1000 and 2000 cm−1 was noticed; these are associated with the D and G vibration modes of carbon materials. The D band (1350 cm−1) is characteristic of disordered aromatic structures, while the G band (1590 cm−1) refers to condensed, ordered or graphitic aromatic structures [40,49]. The relative intensity of the D-band divided by G-band (ID/IG) can be regarded as a good indicator of the degree of disorder in the carbon structure. According to Fig. 5, the Ni-700 catalyst presents lower ID/IG value (0.41) compared to Ni-850 (0.68), indicating that the carbon deposits in Ni-700 are more ordered than those in Ni-850, which agrees with the TGA results. Differences in carbon structure could be related to differences in the catalysts deactivation behavior. In this sense, the presence of more ordered carbon in Ni-700 could lead to a higher degree of active site poisoning thus preventing the adsorption of gasifying agents (H2O and CO2). Reduced and used catalysts have been analyzed by adsorption-desorption of N2. The results of BET area, pore volume, and pore diameter are shown in Table 2 . Compared to reduced catalyst, reduction of BET area (approximately 13–21%) was observed in the used catalyst. In addition, carbon deposition seemed to have more adverse effect on the pore volume (reduction of approximately 50.0%) from the reduced catalyst. Fig. 7 presents the stability test that was obtained for the Ni-850 catalyst during two cycles of 20 h with a regeneration step before the second cycle. As explained above, these experiments were undertaken at more severe conditions (GHSV = 40,000 mL h−1 g−1 and WHSV = 6 h−1). After this, the first cycle regeneration step was performed at 650 °C under 20 mL min−1 of O2 (50%, v/v in Ar) in order to oxidize the possible carbon deposited. Before the second cycle the catalyst was reduced in pure H2 (20 mL min−1) at 650 °C for 1 h. Fig. 6 shows the decrease of H2 yield from 75% to 60% in the first cycle of the fresh catalyst for 20 h. After catalyst regeneration, the initial H2 yield is partially recovered (68%) thus showing that the regeneration procedure by carbon oxidation was not sufficient to recover the initial catalytic activity of the catalyst. Another possible cause of deactivation is physical deposition of the ash contained in the CG onto the catalyst surface. This can result in blockage of sites and/or pores with the subsequent loss of catalytic activity [50]. Nevertheless, alkali deposits can also exert a catalytic effect on the gasification of the carbon deposits [30]. Other catalyst properties can also be affected under these experimental conditions. Ni crystallite size can be enlarged by sintering [51]. Alkali compounds can also react with metal oxides thus leading to changes in chemical composition and textural properties (surface specific area, pore diameter, and volume). To investigate nickel particle sintering, XRD analysis of the spent Ni-850 catalyst was performed. Fig. 8 shows the diffractograms of Ni-850 after its reduction and after its use in the stability test shown in Fig. 7. No significant changes were observed between the reduced catalyst and the used one. Ni remained in its metallic form under the reaction conditions. The pyrochlore phase was also found to be without significant changes. Just a graphite diffraction peak was observed in the spent catalyst. This corresponds to carbon deposits already reported by the other characterization techniques. The crystallite size of the pyrochlore and the metallic Ni increased by only 1 nm thus suggesting a high chemical and thermal stability of the bi-phasic system found in this catalyst."
7,Conclusions,"In the present work, the catalytic activity of Ni–La–Zr catalysts (15 wt%), calcined at 700 °C and 850 °C, was studied in the steam reforming of crude glycerol that was obtained directly from an industrial biodiesel plant as a by-product without any purification process. The tests performed at 500 °C with both catalysts showed low conversion of carbon to gaseous products. Increasing temperature to 650 °C allows to Ni-850 catalyst to reach a carbon to gaseous products value close to 96%. This catalyst presents the lowest amount of carbon deposits and lowest oxidation temperature for its combustion as revealed by TGA and Raman spectrocscopy. The best performance observed for Ni-850 catalysts is mainly associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies that are generated by nickel substitution into La2Zr2O7 lattice during calcination, resulting in higher oxygen ion mobility that favors the oxidation of carbon deposits during the reaction."
