0,Introduction,"Currently, sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is one of the most important crops in the world. According to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1844 million tons of sugarcane was produced on average per year from 2014 to 2016 (OECD/FAO, 2017). Specially in tropical countries, sugarcane can be a replacement for oil because of its high energy density (Grassi and Pereira, 2019). The world's leading sugarcane producers are Brazil (41.7% of the total global production), India (18.9%), China (6.7%) and Thailand (4.7%) (OECD/FAO, 2017). In 2018, 620.4 million tons of sugarcane were produced in Brazil, and the forecast for 2019 is 615.9 million tons (Conab, 2019). Because of the high sucrose content (approximately 200 g L−1, (Plangklang et al., 2012)), sugarcane juice is widely used in the production of sugar and ethanol in Brazil (Dias et al., 2015). Several microorganisms are able to grow in media containing sucrose, using it as an energy source for producing metabolites of commercial interest, such as short-chain organic acids (acetic, butyric, lactic and propionic), ethanol, H2 and CH4 (Ferreira et al., 2018). Nualsri et al. (2016a) suggested that apart from ethanol production, other valuable renewable energy like H2 and CH4 can be produced from sugarcane juice. These authors evaluated the sequential H2 and CH4 production from sugarcane juice (25 g COD L−1) in batch assays (30 °C) and estimated a total energy yield of 13.44 kJ g−1 COD for H2 and CH4 production, in comparison to 10.72 kJ g−1 COD for ethanol production in the study by Dhaliwal et al. (2011). Despite the remarkable scientific findings reported in study by Nualsri et al. (2016a) and other studies of hydrogen production from sugarcane juice in batch reactors (Plangklang et al., 2012) and continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) (Nualsri et al., 2016b; Pattra et al., 2011), the possibility to enhance the total energy recovery from sugarcane juice depends of high H2 production rates that can only be achieved by using high-rate reactors. The greatest advantage of high-rate reactors is the separation of solids retention time and hydraulic retention time (HRT), allowing the application of lower values of HRT. This enables the design of smaller and more efficient reactors, decreasing the capital costs (Schmidt and Ahring, 1996). The upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) (Gavala et al., 2006; Mota et al., 2018), the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) (Shida et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2018) and the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor (Cisneros-Pérez et al., 2015) are examples of the most used high-rate reactors in industrial applications. The EGSB reactor is considered an improvement of the UASB reactor, because the application of higher upflow velocities diminishes the occurrence of dead spaces, bypass flow and short-circuiting linked to the UASB operation that can decrease the reactor performance (Dinsdale et al., 2000). EGSB reactors rely on the self-immobilization of microrganisms without the need for support medium like in the case of the AFBR (Dinsdale et al., 2000; Seghezzo et al., 1998). The high mixing intensity and efficient substrate-biomass contact in EGSB enables the application of high organic loading rates (OLR) and low HRT, allowing high H2 production rates (Cisneros-Pérez et al., 2015). Fermentative hydrogen production can be obtained by using mixed and pure cultures. The studies that applied continuous reactors to produce hydrogen from sugarcane juice used pure cultures (Pattra et al., 2011; Nualsri et al., 2016b). In contrast to pure cultures, the use of mixed cultures in anaerobic systems exhibits greater metabolic adaptability and eliminates the need for sterilization, thereby reducing operational costs (Park et al., 2018; Wang and Wan, 2009). However, microbial diversity may hinder the metabolic control of the fermentative process because of interspecific competitions that affect, for example, the H2 production yield (Cabrol et al., 2017; Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Therefore, the selection of operational conditions that increase metabolic control is the key to process optimization in systems containing mixed cultures (Kraemer and Bagley, 2007). The syntrophic or competitive relationships that delay H2 production are exemplified by the action of lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB), propionic acid-producing bacteria (PAB) and homoacetogenic bacteria. LABs and PABs can reduce the H2 yield by acidifying the medium, producing antimicrobials or consuming H2, for example, in the conversion of lactic acid to propionic acid and the direct conversion of glucose to propionic acid (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Gomes et al., 2015; Noike et al., 2002). Furthermore, homoacetogenic bacteria consume H2 and CO2 to form acetic acid (Si et al., 2015) and, unlike methanogenic archaea, are tolerant to extreme environmental conditions (Saady, 2013) and cannot be inhibited by heat treatment and proper pH control (Wang and Wan, 2009). Therefore, they require other control or improvement methods, depending on the metabolite to be produced. This study addresses the gaps previously highlighted, e.g., the absence of studies of hydrogen production from sugarcane juice and mixed culture in high-rate reactors, and the role of metabolic pathways on dark fermentation of this substrate. For this purposes, three mesophilic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors (30 ± 1 °C) were operated with sugarcane juice at concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 g sucrose L−1 (EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively) decreasing the HRTs from 24 h to 1 h."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum and granular bed,"2.1 Inoculum and granular bed The inoculum used to start the EGSB reactors was granular sludge from a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB), used for treatment of wastewater from the Dacar poultry slaughterhouse (Tietê, SP, Brazil). The sludge had a pH of 7.06, a total solids concentration of 9.1 g L−1 and a volatile suspended solids concentration of 7.8 g L−1. The sludge used as inoculum (10% v/v) was blended and subjected to heat treatment according to Kim et al. (2006) with a subsequent thermal shock as specified by Maintinguer et al. (2008). The EGSB reactor beds consisted of granules from the same sludge used as the inoculum. For application as a granular bed, the sludge was subjected to sieving, and the granules 3.0 to 5.0 mm in diameter were heated at 100 °C for 1 h under constant stirring. After the heating step, the granules were subjected to a thermal shock as specified by Maintinguer et al. (2008)."
3,Fermentative medium preparation,"2.2 Fermentative medium preparation The sugarcane juice used in the reactor operation was collected from the distillery plant Ipiranga (Descalvado, SP, Brazil). The physical-chemical characteristics of the raw sugarcane juice are presented in Table 1 . Table 1 The raw sugarcane juice was diluted to concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 g sucrose L−1 for continuous reactor feeds named EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively. As described in the previous studies that used sugarcane juice as a substrate (Pattra et al., 2011; Nualsri et al., 2016a, b), a nutritional medium was added to EGSB reactors feeds (in g L−1): NH4HCO3 0.32; K2HPO4 0.125; MgCl2.6H2O 0.015; CuSO4.5H2O 0.005; and CoCl2.5H2O 1.25 10-4 (modified according to Endo et al. (1982))."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup Three EGSB reactors were constructed of transparent acrylic with an internal diameter of 4.1 cm and a total volume of 1961 cm3. These reactors had an external jacket for recirculating water from an ultrathermostatized bath, keeping the temperature constant at 30 °C. The recirculation rate in the reactors was adjusted to 6 l h−1 to maintain a bed expansion of 30%. Fig. 1 shows the setup of the experimental apparatus."
5,EGSB startup and operational conditions,"2.4 EGSB startup and operational conditions Initially, the reactors were operated in batch mode for 18 days, promoting adaptation of the hydrogen-producing biomass to the substrate. Carbohydrate consumption analysis was performed during this period. After the adaptation step, the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors were operated in continuous mode for 196, 206 and 213 days, respectively, in 6 operational steps. The reactor operational strategy consisted of decreasing the HRT from 24 h, 16 h, 8 h, 4 h, 2 h to 1 h after stabilization of the H2 productivity, i.e., variation of less than 10% for 10 days."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods For liquid samples, the parameters analyzed in the effluent and the influent were pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), sucrose concentration, total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS) and both organic acids and alcohols. Analysis of TSS and VSS were carried according to Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater by APHA et al. (2005). Analysis of COD and pH were performed five times a week and daily, respectively, also according to Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater by APHA et al. (2005). The sucrose concentration was determined according to the colorimetric method proposed by Dubois et al. (1956). The organic acids and alcohols were analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu®) following Penteado et al. (2013). For gaseous samples, the parameters analyzed five times a week were the volume of biogas produced and its composition (H2, CH4 and CO2). The volumetric biogas production was performed according to Walker et al. (2009) using a column displacement method with an acidified saline solution. The composition of the produced biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography according to Rosa et al. (2014). The detection limits (μmol) for the biogas composition analysis by gas chromatography were 0.902 for hydrogen, 1.039 for methane and 0.474 for carbon dioxide. Sample gas injection volume was 1 mL. The hydrogen content (%H2) was the amount of H2 (expressed in moles), divided by the total amount of all constituents (H2, CH4 and CO2) (also expressed in moles)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Fermentative performance,"3.1 Fermentative performance The pH values of the effluents of the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors ranged from 4.52 to 4.68, 4.26–4.69 and 3.76–4.51, respectively. The COD removal ranged from 13.5 to 26.4 %, 16.7–30.3 % and 9.6–21.8 % for the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors, respectively. Abreu et al. (2007), using a mesophilic EGSB reactor (37 °C) for H2 production from glucose and L-arabinose with a final concentration of 5 g COD L−1 and an HRT of 13 h, observed approximately 20% COD removal. In a mesophilic EGSB (30 °C) used for H2 production from cheese whey (15 and 25 g COD L−1) and HRTs from 8 to 0.5 h, Ramos and Silva (2017) observed COD removals lower than 9.9%. Fig. 2 shows the sucrose conversion values of the EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactors. In the EGSB-5 and EGSB-10 reactors, the sucrose conversion remained stable and higher than 93.0%; however, in EGSB-15, it decreased from 93.7 ± 5.3% to 73.8 ± 5.6% with the decrease in the HRT from 4 h to 1 h (OLRs of 182.9 and 348.0 kg sucrose m−3 day-1, respectively). Other studies in the literature observed that OLRs greater than 100.0 kg m−3 day-1 can inhibit H2 production (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Nasr et al., 2012). The relationship between the HRT reduction (and consequent OLR increase) and the decrease in carbohydrate consumption has also been observed in other studies (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017, 2016). Similarly, Lin et al. (2009), using a three-phase fluidized bed reactor (FBR) to produce H2 from sucrose while reducing the HRT from 6 to 2 h, observed carbohydrate conversions higher than 94.0% for influent concentrations of 5 and 10 g L−1 (OLRs less than 120 kg COD m-3day−1). These authors also observed a decrease in carbohydrate conversion from 98.5% to 71.7% and from 86.9% to 61.8% for influent concentrations of 20 g L−1 (an OLR increase from 80 to 240 kg COD m-3day−1) and 40 g L−1 (an OLR increase from 160 to 480 kg COD m-3day−1), respectively. Ferraz Júnior et al. (2014), using an upflow anaerobic packed-bed reactor (UAnPBR) (35 °C) fed glucose (2.2–17.1 g L−1) with a fixed HRT (8 h), found that carbohydrate consumption decreased from 100.0 to 85.0% with the increase in the OLR from 6.5 to 51.4 kg COD m-3day−1."
9,Performance of hydrogen production from sugarcane juice in mesophilic EGSB reactors,"3.2 Performance of hydrogen production from sugarcane juice in mesophilic EGSB reactors During EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 reactor operation, CH4 was not detected in the biogas, indicating that the heat treatment and maintenance of pH between 4.0 and 5.0 were effective methods for inhibiting methanogenic archaea. Fig. 3 shows the %H2, based on mole, and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of the reactors as a function of the HRT. In EGSB-5, H2 was observed in the biogas (6.8 ± 1.9%) only at the HRT of 1 h. In EGSB-10, the %H2 increased from 3.83 ± 1.4% to 20.1 ± 2.8% as the HRT decreased from 8 h to 4 h. With the further reduction in HRT from 4 h to 1 h, the %H2 in the biogas decreased from 20.1 ± 2.8% to 8.5 ± 1.4%. H2 was observed in the biogas in EGSB-15 only at the HRT of 4 h (14.1 ± 2.8%) and remained relatively constant at 21.2 ± 3.1% and 17.2 ± 2.1% at HRTs of 2 h and 1 h, respectively. In the literature, %H2 values similar to those of EGSB-15 were observed by Pattra et al. (2011) in a CSTR (37 °C) using sugarcane juice (25 g L−1) for continuous H2 production by Clostridium butyricum under nonsterile conditions. These authors observed %H2 values of 24.2%, 17.0% and 19.1% at HRTs of 24, 12 and 4 h, respectively. Shida et al. (2009) used an anaerobic FBR (AFBR) (30 °C) fed a synthetic substrate glucose-based (2 g L−1) while reducing the HRT from 8 to 1 h and observed constant %H2 values between 28.0 and 38.0%. In EGSB-5, the HPR was 6.96 ± 2.40 l d−1 L−1 at the HRT of 1 h. The HPR in EGSB-10 increased from 11.74 ± 4.60 l d−1L−1 to 19.14 ± 2.74 l d−1L−1 with an HRT reduction from 4 h to 1 h. The HPR in the EGSB-15 increased from 4.91 l d−1L−1 to 52.49 l d−1L−1 with an HRT reduction from 4 h to 2 h. In EGSB-15, a stable HPR was observed as the HRT decreased from 2 h to 1 h (46.36 ± 6.96 l d−1L−1). The HPR increase was associated with an increase in the OLR due to the increase in the amount of substrate available for conversion to H2 (Kumar et al., 2017). In general, the HPR showed a tendency to increase with decreasing HRT and consequent OLR increase, increasing from 59.6 to 233.0 kg sucrose m-3day−1 for EGSB-10 and from 91.8 to 348.0 kg sucrose m-3day−1 for EGSB-15. The HPR increase as a result of HRT reduction with a fixed influent concentration (resulting in an increase in the OLR) has been reported by other studies (Lin et al., 2009; Shida et al., 2009; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Pugazhendhi et al. (2017) investigated H2 production in an anaerobic fixed-bed reactor (37 °C) fed with glucose (15 g L−1). The authors observed an HPR increase from 5.46 to 78.40 l d−1 L−1 with decreasing HRT from 12 to 1.5 h (an OLR increase from 30.0 to 240.0 kg m-3 day−1). Salem et al. (2017) operating a CSTR (35 °C) with a fixed HRT (12 h) cited the increased substrate availability as a justification for the increase in the HPR from 9.9 to 16.5 l d−1L−1 with an increase in the sucrose concentration from 10 to 30 g L−1 (equivalent to an OLR increase from 20.0 to 60.0 kg m-3day−1). The HPRs observed in EGSB-10 and EGSB-15 at low HRT may be associated with biomass immobilization because in EGSB reactors, the HRT is independent of the cell retention time (Schmidt and Ahring, 1996). Compared to EGSB reactors, CSTRs may exhibit lower H2 production due to biomass washing (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). Nualsri et al. (2016b) applying 25 g COD L−1 of sugarcane juice in a CSTR (37 °C), observed an HPR increase from 1.18 to 17.50 l d−1L−1 as the HRT decreased from 12 to 3 h. However, further decrease in the HRT from 3 to 2 h caused H2 production instability, and the HPR decreased to 17.40 l d−1L−1. In the present study, the maximum HPRs observed at low HRTs in EGSB-10 (19.14 l d−1L−1) and EGSB-15 (52.40 l d−1L−1) were higher than those of Pattra et al. (2011) and Nualsri et al. (2016b). Ferraz Júnior et al. (2014) evaluated the OLR impact on H2 production in a UAnPBR (35 °C) with glucose concentrations ranging between 2.2 and 17.1 g L−1 and observed an increase in the HPR from 1.70 to 6.50 l d−1 L−1 in response to an OLR increase from 6.5 to 51.4 kg m-3 day−1. In the UAnPBR case, the packed bed provides resistance to mass transfer and instability in H2 production. In EGSB-10, with a higher upflow velocity (0.153 cm s−1) than in the UAnPBR and an OLR similar to that of Ferraz Júnior et al. (2014) (59.6 kg sucrose m-3day−1), the HPR was 11.74 l d−1L−1."
10,Composition and distribution of metabolic products,"3.3 Composition and distribution of metabolic products Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show the metabolite concentrations detected as a function of the HRT applied to EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively. In EGSB-5, the main metabolites produced were acetic acid (HAc) (47.0–59.0 %), butyric acid (HBu) (10.0–25.0 %) and propionic acid (HPr) (8.0–23.0 %). Valeric acid was observed at mass fractions of between 2.0 and 11.0%. In EGSB-10, the continuously produced metabolites in all HRTs were restricted to HAc (35.0–50.0 %), HBu (15.0–44.0 %) and HPr (8.0–21.0 %). The main metabolites produced in EGSB-15 were lactic acid (HLa) (13.0–52.0 %), HAc (10.0–25.0 %), HBu (5.0–43.0%) and HPr (5.0–13.0 %). HLa was detected in the reactors EGSB-5 and EGSB-10 only at the HRT of 24 h, with concentrations of 0.17 g L−1 and 1.36 g L−1, respectively. At this HRT in both reactors, H2 production was not observed. Rosa et al. (2016), using an AFBR (30 °C) for H2 production from cassava wastewater (4–30 kg COD m-3day−1), observed a maximum hydrogen yield (HY) of 2 mmol g-1 COD when applying an OLR of 10 kg COD m−3 day−1 and explained the absence of HLa at other OLRs via HLa metabolization and production of HPr (Eq. (1); (Saady, 2013)), HAc (Eq. (2); (Saady, 2013)) and ethanol (EtOH) (Eq. (3); (Saady, 2013)). (1) 3CH3CHOHCOOH → 2CH3CH2COOH + CH3COOH + HCO3 ¯ + H+ (2) CH3CHOHCOOH +2H2O → CH3COOH + HCO3 ¯+ 2H2 (3) C6H12O6 → CH3CHOHCOOH + CH3CH2OH + CO2 The heterolactic route, i.e., the conversion of glucose into HLa and EtOH (Eq. (3)), is a metabolic strategy to recover NADH by reoxidizing it to NAD+ (Budinich et al., 2011; Fuess et al., 2018). This pathway may explain why HLa and EtOH represent 72.0, 61.0, 57.0 and 53.0% of the total metabolites in the EGSB-15 reactor at HRTs of 24, 16, 8 and 4 h, respectively. A similar composition was observed by Pattra et al. (2011), with HLa and EtOH accounting for 63.0% of the total metabolites at an HRT of 4 h in a CSTR fed with sugarcane juice (25 g COD L−1). In the heterolactic route, the H2 yield is null (Gavala et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2018), explaining the absence of H2 at HRTs of 24, 16 and 8 h in EGSB-15. Jo et al. (2007) observed inhibition of the genus Clostridium bacteria and favoring of the heterolactic route after 17 days of operation using food residues, resulting in low H2 production and high HLa and EtOH production. In EGSB-15, when the HRT was reduced from 24 to 2 h, the HLa concentration decreased from 4.73 to 1.99 g L−1, the HY increased from 0.21 ± 0.07 to 0.73 ± 0.07 mol H2 mol−1 hexose, and the HBu concentration increased from 0.83 to 4.07 g L−1. Nualsri et al. (2016b), using a CSTR (37 °C) for H2 production from sugarcane juice (25 g COD L−1) at HRTs from 12 to 3 h, observed a decrease in the HLa concentration from 7.20 g COD L−1 to 2.20 g COD L−1 and increases in the HY and HBu concentration from 0.30 to 1.30 mol H2 mol−1 hexose and 3.00 to 6.70 g COD L−1, respectively, with decreasing HRT. Mota et al. (2018) used three UASB reactors and a structured fixed-bed reactor for H2 production from sucrose-based substrate (4.45 g L−1) under mesophilic conditions (30 °C). These authors attributed the superior performance of the UASB reactor with disaggregated granules (1.68 mol H2 mol−1 hexose - OLR of 25 kg m-3 day−1) relative to the other reactors in their study to the change from limited lactate production to greater acetate production. Fig. 7 shows the relationships between the HY and the HLa yield (LaY) (selectivity) as a function of the applied OLR in EGSB-15. The increase in the OLR from 14.5 to 47.7 kg sucrose m−3 day-1 resulted in HLa and EtOH production, probably through the heterolactic route, with no H2 production. The LaY (0.89 mol HLa mol-1 hexose) observed under the OLR of 45.7 kg sucrose m−3 day-1 was close to the maximum LaY of the heterolactic route (1.00 mol HLa mol-1 hexose), wherein HLa formation from glucose occurs via the phosphochelatase pathway (Cubas-Cano et al., 2018). For OLRs of 91.8 to 348.0 kg sucrose m−3 day-1, the HY values were equal to the LaY values. When applying an OLR of 182.9 kg sucrose m−3 day-1 (HRT of 2 h), the HY was higher than the LaY. According to Baghchehsaraee et al. (2010), the EtOH and HLA production route changes to favor HBu and H2 production under HLa concentrations lower than 650 mg L−1. Usually, under substrate deficiency conditions, bacteria use HLa in association with another carbon source, such as HAc (Cabrol et al., 2017), to produce H2 and HBu (Eq. (4)) (Matsumoto and Nishimura, 2007). However, in the present study, HBu and H2 production increased with increasing substrate availability, that is, at OLRs higher than 91.8 kg sucrose m-3 day−1. As NADH reoxidation of NAD+ causes H2 production, the NADH excess obtained when there is an imbalance and accumulation of HLa may be beneficial (Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009). (4) CH3COOH + 2CH3CHOHCOOH → H2 + 3/2CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + H2O For OLRs greater than 91.8 kg sucrose m−3day-1, which were associated with H2 production, the relationship between BuY and LaY was greater than 1.0 mol HBu mol-1HLa. Similarly, a study by Pugazhendhi et al. (2017) observed HY values higher than 1.7 mol H2 mol-1 hexose when the ratio between BuY and LaY was greater than 2.0 mol HBu mol-1 HLa for the range of applied OLRs (60 to 240 kg m−3 day-1). Similar to the present study, Palomo-Briones et al. (2017) observed that smaller OLRs (20 - 40 kg m−3day-1) favored HLa production, while higher OLRs (40 - 80 kg m−3day-1) improved H2 production. The maximum HY of 0.73 mol H2 mol−1 hexose obtained in EGSB-15 was coincident with the maximum HBu concentration of 4.07 g L−1 at an HRT of 2 h. Similar to EGSB-15, the EGSB-10 maximum HY was 0.54 mol H2 mol−1 hexose at an HRT of 4 h, coinciding with the maximum HBu concentration detected (2.03 g L−1). The butyric route was suggested by Plangklang et al. (2012) and by Nualsri et al. (2016a) in batch assays under mesophilic conditions (37 °C/30 °C) using a pure culture and sugarcane juice (25 g COD L−1). Nualsri et al. (2016b), applying sugarcane juice at a concentration of 25 g COD L−1 in a CSTR (37 °C), observed that the butyric route was dominant during reactor operation. Similarly, Pattra et al. (2011), using a CSTR (37 °C) with a pure culture for H2 production from sugarcane juice (25 g L−1), observed that HBu was the predominant metabolite at the optimal HRT (4 h) (9.5 g COD L−1). However, the HAc/HBu ratio in their study was 1.02, unlike the relation pointed out by Muñoz-Páez et al. (2013) to define the predominance of the butyric route (HAc/HBu <0.79). Therefore, HAc, with a theoretical yield higher than that of HBu, may explain why the HY observed by Pattra et al. (2011) (0.97 mol H2 mol−1 hexose) was greater than the maximum HY obtained in this study in EGSB-15 (20.07 g COD L−1). To compare the results, the HY and HPR values of the present study and of other studies using sugarcane juice as a substrate are listed in Table 2 . Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the HY and HAc/HBu ratio for EGSB-10. In EGSB-10, the HY maximum (0.54 mol H2 mol−1 hexose) was coincident with the butyric route occurrence at an HRT of 4 h (HAc/HBu of 0.78). The decrease in HY had a high correlation (R2 = 0.9845) with the HAc/HBu increase, indicating that, contrary to expectations, the increase in HAc concentration by decreasing the HRT was not favorable to H2 production. In EGSB-15, HAc/HBu ratios of 1.11, 1.80 and 4.32 were observed at HRTs of 24, 16 and 8 h, respectively; under these conditions, H2 was not observed in this reactor. At HRTs of 4, 2, and 1 h, under which H2 production occurred, the HAc/HBu ratios were 0.55, 0.53 and 0.77, respectively."
11,Homoacetogenic process,"3.4 Homoacetogenic process Different literature studies indicate that the HAc production pathway (Eq. (5)) is responsible for the maximum theoretical H2 yield (Palomo-Briones et al., 2017). (5) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2C2H4O2 + 2CO2 + 4H2 The absent or limited H2 productivity in EGSB-5 and EGSB-10, despite the high HAc percentage at all applied HRTs, may be linked to the occurrence of homoacetogenesis in these reactors (Eq. (6); (Saady, 2013)). (6) 2CO2 + 4H2 → C2H4O2 + 2H2O The stoichiometric molar H2 yield (H2-theoretical) (mmol L−1) and the HAc production by the homoacetogenesis process can be estimated by performing mass balances, according to Eq. (7) – (8), respectively (Arooj et al., 2008a; Luo et al., 2011). For this purpose, the HAc concentration should be considered the sum between HAc concentrations formed directly from the glucose fermentation [HAcg] and HAc formed from homoacetogenesis [HAcH]. The following premises must be adopted: i) HAc is formed only through fermentation; (ii) H2 is only consumed in HPr formation; and (iii) the only H2-producing routes are those producing HAc and HBu (Castelló et al., 2018). To estimate homoacetogenesis predominance in the reactors, the %Homo, i.e., the relationship between [HAcH] (Eq. (8)) and the [HAc] detected, was calculated. (7) H2-theoretical = 2 [HBu] + 2 [HAc] – [HPr] (8) [HAcH] = (2 [HAc] + 2 [HBu] – [HPr] – HY) / 6 where [HBu], [HAc] and [HPr] are the measured HBu, HAc and HPr concentrations (mmol), respectively. In EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, the mean HAcH concentrations relative to the HAc concentrations detected in the reactor effluent ([AcH]/[Ac]) (%Homo) remained between 39.0 and 50.0%, evidencing the occurrence of homoacetogenesis. The phenomenon is not entirely unexpected because heat treatment does not exclusively select H2-producing bacteria (Kraemer and Bagley, 2007). In addition, other studies have reported homoacetogenesis based on HY and analyses of detected metabolites during reactor operation (Castelló et al., 2018; Muri et al., 2018; Si et al., 2015). Fig. 9, 10 and 11 show the %Homo, H2-theoretical and HY for EGSB-5, EGSB-10 and EGSB-15, respectively. In the present study, the H2-theoretical was 2 to 8 times higher than the HY for EGSB-10 and 2 to 5 times higher than the HY for EGSB-15 at HRTs of 4 to 1 h. Gavala et al. (2006) evaluated H2 production in a UASB reactor (35 °C) from glucose (10 g L−1) at HRTs from 12 to 2 h and observed that the H2-theoretical values were 2 to 4 times higher than the HY values. The other results of those authors, such as high carbohydrate consumption (> 87.0%), low HY (0.80-0.50 mol H2 mol−1hexose) and HAc, HBu and EtOH as the predominant metabolites, were similar to those of the present study for EGSB-10 (10 g L−1). EGSB-10 showed carbohydrate removal values greater than 93.0%, a maximum HY of 0.54 mol H2 mol−1hexose and HAc and HBu as the predominant metabolites. Castelló et al. (2018), using a CSTR (30 °C) for H2 production from cheese whey (30 g COD L−1) at a fixed HRT of 24 h, verified the occurrence of homoacetogenesis when observing H2-theoretical values 7 times higher than the maximum HY (0.90 mol H2 mol−1 lactose). The authors also observed an average %Homo of 46%, similar to the reactors in the present study. Arooj et al. (2008a), using a CSTR (35 °C) for H2 production from starch (20 g COD L−1), observed a mean %Homo of 41% for HRTs ranging from 18 to 4 h, and similar to the present study, reported low HY values (maximum of 0.92 mol H2 mol−1hexose). The authors suggested that the butyric route was responsible for the H2 detected in the reactor, similar to the EGSB-15 reactor. Arooj et al. (2008b), using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) (35 °C) for H2 production from starch (20 g COD L−1), observed a mean %Homo of 40.0% for HRTs ranging from 18 to 4 h. The HY followed similar pattern as that in Arooj et al. (2008a), with a maximum value of 0.51 mol H2 mol−1hexose (0.52 mol H2 mol−1hexose, considering consumption of 97.8%) at an HRT of 12 h."
12,Conclusions,"Decreasing the HRT was beneficial to H2 production from sugarcane juice. The highest HPRs were observed at the HRT of 1 h in EGSB-5 (6.96 l d−1L−1), 1 h in EGSB-10 (19.14 l d−1L−1) and 2 h in EGSB-15 (52.40 l d−1L−1). In EGSB-15, the HPR remained constant with the further reduction in the HRT to 1 h. The results corroborate the claim that high-rate reactors, such as EGSB reactors, can withstand high OLRs. In this study, the maximum HY was observed in EGSB-15 at an HRT of 2 h, equivalent to an OLR of 182.9 kg sucrose m-3day−1. In EGSB-15, the application of higher HRTs and lower OLRs (14.5, 23.2 and 45.7 kg sucrose m-3day−1) benefited the heterofermentative production of HLa, with a molar fraction of this metabolite between 48.0 and 52.0%. Because homoacetogenesis may have been the cause of the high HAc concentrations in the reactors, the H2 detected was attributed to the HBu production route. The maximum HY values for EGSB-10 (0.54 mol H2 mol−1hexose) and the EGSB-15 (0.73 mol H2 mol−1hexose) were observed at HRTs where HBu was the predominant metabolite, with molar fractions equal to 44.0 and 43.0%, respectively."
