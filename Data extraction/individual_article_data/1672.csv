0,Introduction,"The World Energy Outlook 2016 forecasted in the main scenario a 30% rise in global energy demand by 2040 [1]. Nowadays, we strongly depend on the exploitation of fossil sources; however, the depletion of non-renewable oil urges the study of alternative and sustainable pathways. Among others, the utilization of biomass seems one of the most promising ways to reach this fundamental goal [2]. Biomass is commonly classified according to three generations [3]. First generation is related to edible crops (e.g. sugar cane, palm oil): it is an important commercial reality for the production of bioethanol and biodiesel, but embraces critical ethical drawbacks; second generation is referred to lignocellulosic materials (e.g. agricultural residues, purpose-grown vegetative grasses) [4,5]: it overcomes the food competition, but requires high land use; third generation is referred mainly to microalgae and macroalgae [6]. Compared to the previous generations, it has the important advantage not to interfere neither with food production nor with agriculture land [7]. Focusing in particular on macroalgae, the beneficial effects linked to their exploitation–rapid growth, efficient cultivation, CO2 sequestration – encourage the scientists, who look at them as a renewable source of biofuels and chemicals [8,9]. Macroalgae are classified as brown, red or green algae. Their composition is poor in lipids, lignin-free, but with a high content in carbohydrates [10]. Alginate is one of the most abundant carbohydrates in the outer wall cell of brown macroalgae [11]. It is constituted by two different units (mannuronic acid and guluronic acid) linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. It is used in several sectors, for example as food additive, drug delivery system, or for textile printing. Recently it has been studied also as a possible source of biofuels and with the aim to produce valuable compounds [12]. Aida et al. studied the hydrothermal treatment of sodium alginate into added-value organic compounds such as lactic, malic or succinic acid from 150 to 400°C [13]. They found that increasing the reaction temperature enhanced the conversion of alginate to smaller organic acids, whereas at 150°C they found compounds with rather high molecular weight. The authors concluded that the alginate containing marine algae could be an interesting feedstock for biomass refinery processes, in particular, for liquid products. In another study, it was investigated the influence of some reaction conditions (pH, temperature) on the products distribution [12]. For example, furfural and glycolic acid were in acidic conditions, while lactic, fumaric and malic acid were in basic conditions. In addition, the increase in temperature influenced the molecular weight distribution of the final products. They stated that alginate could be an alternative to cellulose for the production of furfural and value added organic acids. Recently, Ban et al. investigated the selective conversion of alginate into its two monomers by mean of sulfonated glucose-derived carbon catalyst [14]. However, they observed a consecutive degradation, obtaining humins and isomeric uronic acids, that lowered the yield of the target products. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the previous works were focused only on the characterization of the liquid phase produced by the reaction. The microalgae and marine macroalgae have been considered as feedstock with high potential for their use in a biorefinery, replacing the terrestrial biomass-based biorefinery [15]. Looking at a possible application in a biorefinery, it would be interesting to investigate the possibility to produce, apart from valuable compounds obtained in the liquid phase, a worthwhile gas phase. The previous mentioned works are carried out in water, taking advantage of the peculiar characteristics of “high-temperature water”, working in a system that is cheap, sustainable and eco-friendly. Therefore, we were interested in exploring the possibility to obtain also a valuable gas phase from alginate, that is one of the main component of the cell wall. During the last decade, the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of oxygenated compounds was one of the most investigated processes [16]. It allows to obtain a gas mixture rich in hydrogen working at milder temperature (about 500K) compared to the more severe conditions (typically higher than 800K) of the conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons. Up to now, these studies have been carried out mainly using simple molecules: ethylene glycol [12–16,21], glycerol [22–24], sorbitol [25,26]. These studies are fundamental because they allowed to have an insight on the reaction mechanism. However, it is required to gradually increase the level of complexity of the feed, by testing a compound closer to those present in the aqueous stream coming out from hydrothermal processes in a biorefinery: this is, in principle, the main target of aqueous phase reforming, as suggested from the first work in which the APR was indicated as useful for the generation of hydrogen rich fuel gas from carbohydrates extracted from renewable biomass [16]. In this work, in order to valorize a promising feedstock in terms of biorefinery, dealing with an environmental-friendly system, we explored the catalytic APR of alginate. In this case, the stoichiometric reaction would be (1) C 6 H 9 O 7 + 5 H 2 O → 6 C O 2 + 9.5 H 2 With this stoichiometry, the alginate is actually an anion, and the corresponding cation is sodium, in this work. Moreover, we referred to the molecular formula of the repetitive unit of alginate (mannuronic or guluronic acid), without considering the first step of hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. We tested the influence of the catalyst and alginate loading, temperature, reaction time, pH and hydrogen pressure in the head gas phase of the batch reactor over three output parameters under evaluation: carbon conversion to gas (CtoG), hydrogen yield (Y-H2) and hydrogen selectivity (S-H2). This work mainly focused on the investigation of the yield towards gas phase, whereas, as mentioned, some previous papers looked at the alginate solution as a feed to obtain just liquid products [27]. The achieved results helped to validate the previous APR works done on simpler molecules, verifying its robustness in the case of a more complex feed; moreover, it allowed to move a step towards the industrial application of this thermochemical process trying to apply it with a much more complex feed that is significantly more similar to what expected in practical contexts, looking to a carbohydrate based biorefinery."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium alginate was purchased from Carlo Erba. Deionized water was obtained in laboratory. 3% Pt/C catalyst was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Gas cylinders were supplied by SIAD S.p.A., Bergamo (Italy). All the chemicals were used as received."
3,Aqueous phase reforming tests,"2.2 Aqueous phase reforming tests The APR tests were conducted in a 300mL 4560 series mini bench top reactor (Parr) equipped with a 4848 model reactor controller (Parr). The reactor was loaded with 100mL of aqueous solution with different alginate concentration (0.5, 1 and 2wt.%) and the catalyst was added in the desired amount (0–0.8g depending on the run) without any pretreatment. In fact, preliminary tests in which the catalyst was subjected to a reducing environment did not affect the catalytic properties. The atmosphere was purged from the oxygen by nitrogen five times; then it was pressurized with 0.3MPa of N2. The temperature was programmed to reach the desired set value, and kept constant for the prefixed time. The stirrer was set at 500rpm. The heating time was approximately 30min, and the reaction time was considered starting when the set temperature was reached. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled thanks to the internal water-cooling coil. The pressure value obtained by the transducer was recorded. The gas phase was collected in a sampling bag and analyzed by micro-GC, to evaluate its composition. The liquid product was recovered from the reactor and filtered by gravity to remove the catalyst; then it was subjected to TOC and HPLC analysis. The filtered solid phase was put in an oven at 90°C overnight, recovered and weighted. In the tests where the purge was carried out, after the collection of the gas phase, the reactor was again purged with nitrogen and then set at the temperature desired."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The analysis of the gas phase was performed with a SRA Micro-GC, equipped with a Molsieve 5A column (for the analysis of permanent gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide) and Argon as carrier (column temperature: 100°C); a PoraPLOT U column was used for the separation of carbon dioxide, ethane and propane, with Helium flow as carrier (column temperature: 80°C). The detection of the species was due to a TCD detector. The injection temperature was fixed at 90°C and the pressure at 30psi. HPLC analysis (Shimadzu) was performed with a Rezex ROA-Organic acid H+ (8%) column (300mm*7.8mm). The mobile phase was 5mM H2SO4 in water. The flow rate was fixed at 0.6mL/min and the temperature of the column at 50°C. The products were determined by means of a photodiode array detector (PDA) set at 200nm. Total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu TOC-VCSH analyzer equipped with a nondispersive infrared detector. A Micromeritics Tristar 3020 instrument was used to measure the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the fresh and spent catalysts at 77K. Prior to the characterization, the samples (about 0.1g) were degassed at 200°C under nitrogen flow for 2h by means of a Micromeritics Flow Prep 060 degassing system. The specific surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) equation, whereas the pore size distribution and the pore volume in accordance to the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by means of a Panalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation, 2h range 10–70, step 0.01, time per step 240s) on a fresh and spent catalyst sample to assess any structural change. The effective platinum loading of the catalyst before and after the reaction was measured via a Thermo Scientific iCAP Q ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in air using a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument in the temperature range 25–900°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min on a fresh and spent catalyst. The curves were normalized to the unit weight of the sample. The performance of the process was estimated according to parameters frequently applied in the evaluation of aqueous phase reforming [28]: the carbon conversion to gas (CtoG), defined as the ratio between the carbon atoms in the gas product (Cgas) and the carbon atoms in the feedstock (Cfeed) (Eq. (2)); the hydrogen selectivity (S-H2), defined as the ratio between the hydrogen and the carbon dioxide moles in the gas phase ((H2/CO2)gas), divided by the stoichiometric reforming ratio (RR): it is commonly defined as the ratio between hydrogen and carbon dioxide moles in the reaction stoichiometry and therefore, according to the Eq. (1), is equal to 1.58 (Eq. (3)); the hydrogen yield (Y-H2), defined as the ratio between the moles of produced hydrogen in the gas phase ((H2)gas) and the maximum moles that could be obtained according to the reaction stoichiometry (i.e. 9.5 times the initial moles of alginate, 9.5*nalg) (Eq. (4)). According to the composition of the gas phase, the relevant calorific value was calculated, in order to have an information on the energetic quality of the obtained gas. (2) CtoG ( % ) = 100 * C gas C feed (3) S − H 2 ( % ) = 100 * ( H 2 / CO 2 ) gas RR (4) Y − H 2 ( % ) = 100 * ( H 2 ) gas 9.5 * n alg"
5,Results and discussion,"In this chapter, the impact of several reaction conditions on the performance of catalytic APR of alginate (carbon conversion to gas, hydrogen selectivity and hydrogen yield) will be discussed. The tests are labeled according to the weight concentration of the starting solution (0.5, 1 or 2wt.%) and the amount of catalyst (no cat, 0.4 or 0.8g); when the effect of the pH was investigated, the starting pH value was also added. Each test was performed at least in duplicate and the reported values are the average value; the standard deviation between the measures was always less than 5%."
6,Effect of the catalyst amount,"3.1 Effect of the catalyst amount Table 1 shows the influence of the catalyst amount on the APR of 1wt.% alginate solution after 6h at 225°C. The uncatalyzed test had 8.5% of carbon conversion to gas, with 1.3% of hydrogen yield. The obtained gas phase is mainly constituted by carbon dioxide (77.8%). According to Aida et al. [27], the uncatalyzed decomposition of alginate occurs under hydrothermal conditions through an acid hydrolysis pathway. At the beginning, mannuronic acid is formed and it starts to decompose to give water-soluble organic acids and gas species. The monomeric acids can be further subjected to decarboxylation or decarbonylation reactions: in the first case, the oxygen from the molecule would be eliminated directly as carbon dioxide, in the second case as carbon monoxide: for example, the selective decarboxylation of the carboxylic group in the monomers would give xylose. The CO produced via decarbonylation could react with water, giving hydrogen and carbon dioxide via water gas shift reaction (WGSR). However, the WGSR would be thermodynamically favored in these conditions of temperature, but not kinetically favored, being without catalyst. It is highlighted the presence of hydrogen, although very small (17.4% of the gas phase, with nitrogen being excluded). In a previous work in which the non-catalytic APR of glycerol was investigated, the gas phase obtained at 250°C was entirely constituted by carbon dioxide [29]. Making a comparison between the non-catalytic test and the test with 0.1g of catalyst, there was an increase both in conversion and hydrogen production. This can be attributed to the more favorable CC cleavage reaction when a group VIII metal is used [30]. It is worthy to underline that the methane was particularly sensitive to the presence of the catalyst, increasing its concentration by one order of magnitude (from 0.3 to 3.9%): this is probably due to the methanation reactions (Eqs. (5) and (6)) that were not kinetically favored without the use of the catalyst, but thermodynamically favoured at low temperature with the respect to H2 and CO2. This phenomenon suggests that the presence of the catalyst has for sure a benefic effect in the hydrogen production; at the same time, however, it increases also the production of methane, whose presence was already thermodynamically favoured. This is an important issue dealing with aqueous phase reforming processes, because these reactions would consume the produced hydrogen, decreasing at the same time the S-H2. (5) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O (6) C O + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O With the increase of the catalyst loading, a constant increase in the carbon conversion to gas and hydrogen yield was observed. The improvement of the results is more evident if we ideally try to subtract the contribution of the non-catalytic reactions. In this way, removing the homogeneous part of the carbon conversion, going from 0.1 to 0.2g of catalyst the conversion doubled and the hydrogen had a production 1.5 times higher. It is worth nothing that the carbon monoxide was detected only in the uncatalyzed test: this is an important indication because it confirms the benefic effect of water-gas shift, leading to an APR gas phase poor in carbon monoxide, allowing its use in particularly sensitive environments (e.g. fuel cells). Looking at the results, it is reported that the highest yield of hydrogen was obtained with the highest amount of catalyst used; however, there was a trade-off between the maximum conversion (obtained at 0.8g) and the maximum selectivity (obtained at 0.4g): this reflects that the gas with the best quality (i.e. with the highest calorific value) was obtained when 0.4g of catalyst were used. The benefic effect of the increasing in the catalyst loading and the correspondent increase in the conversion can be explained with the increase of the number of active sites, as reported in literature [31,32]. On the other hand, this greater availability could favour, and in a greater extent, the formation of alkanes (e.g. methane, ethane and propane), whose increase can be seen also moving from 0.4 to 0.8g. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a classic competition problem; we can assume that the reactions (methanation and Fischer-Tropsch reactions) that lead to the formation of alkanes have a greater dependence to the catalyst amount compared to the reactions that lead to the production of hydrogen; similarly, we can say that, looking at the fact that platinum is an excellent hydro-dehydrogenation catalyst, a greater number of active sites could favor preferably these hydrogenation reactions, compared with the APR reactions."
7,Effect of the alginate concentration,"3.2 Effect of the alginate concentration In Table 2 the results obtained with three different levels of catalyst amount (0, 0.4 and 0.8g) are reported. When no catalyst was added, there was a constant decrease in the hydrogen yield and selectivity with increasing the alginate initial concentration, whereas the CtoG had a less evident decrease. In particular, at the highest value of alginate concentration investigated, the APR tests showed the worst performance in terms of hydrogen production, with only 0.3% of Y-H2. When the catalyst was added, the carbon conversion to gas had a more evident decrease with the increase in the alginate solution both with 0.4 and 0.8g of catalyst, as represented in Fig. 1 : this is a sign that the positive effect of adding the catalyst progressively disappears with the increase of the concentration of the alginate solution. Making a comparison between two tests with the same alginate concentration and different catalyst amount, it was reported a higher conversion when 0.8g of catalyst was used. This phenomenon can be explained thinking to the beneficial influence of the higher ratio active sites/feed molecules. Looking at the hydrogen selectivity, there was a maximum reported at 1% of alginate both with 0.4 and 0.8g of catalyst. But in this case, at the same level of concentration, the higher the amount of catalyst, the lower the hydrogen selectivity. Therefore, it seemed that the catalyst has the positive effect to increase the carbon conversion to gas, but at the same time to decrease the hydrogen formation. As reported in the previous paragraph, this behavior can be due to the promotion of parallel reaction pathways that consume the produced hydrogen. For this reason, it is important to find a catalyst that is able to selectively activate the production of hydrogen, without promoting other reactions. Looking at the hydrogen yield, it was reported a decreasing trend when 0.4g of catalyst was used; on the other hand, a maximum in the yield was found with the test 1%-0.8. It was observed a strong dependence of carbon monoxide from alginate concentration in the uncatalyzed test, whereas it seemed insensitive in the case of the catalytic runs, remaining in each test not detectable. The production of methane followed a trend similar to the one of carbon dioxide, with a minimum at 1wt.%; on the other hand, ethane showed a decreasing behavior with the increase in the alginate concentration. It is reported in literature that in the case of APR of ethylene glycol with Pt/Al2O3 the rate of H2 production has a fractional order with respect to feed concentration (0.4 order) [19]. The reason can be ascribed to the participation of the molecules in homogeneous reactions forming other species that collaborate to reduce the hydrogen selectivity and promote catalyst deactivation [33]. For instance, glucose in aqueous system at the investigated temperature interval, it is subjected to homogeneous decompositions reactions that are first order in the glucose concentration, whereas the desirable reforming reactions are fractional order on the catalyst surface: therefore, high glucose concentration lead to lower hydrogen selectivity. They noted a difference also in the liquid product distribution: again, it can be due to the difference in the order of reaction between the main and the parallel undesired reactions [34]. In our case, it seems that is −0.5 order the rate of hydrogen production in the homogeneous case, whereas it is 0.6 and 0.7 when 0.4 and 0.8g of catalyst are added, respectively. This issue seemed very stringent in this case even if we are in every dilute system, with a H2O/C molar ratio equal to 50 in the most concentrated case, whereas it is 15 in most of the cases present in literature, but with simpler compounds [16]. The rate of hydrogen production is higher order in methanol (0.8) than ethylene glycol (0.4), indicating that the surface coverage by species derived from ethylene glycol is higher than from methanol under APR reaction conditions [30]. In Table 3 , we have re-elaborated the experimental results obtained: the contribution in the production of CO2 were ideally splitted into two pathways. The first one, named APR-CO2, is thought to come from the occurrence of the alginate APR and therefore calculated according to ideal reaction stoichiometry starting from the amount of hydrogen detected at the end of the test; the second one, named Excess CO2, is obtained as a difference between the total production of CO2 and the aliquot coming from the APR stoichiometry. Consequently, such a quantity should be connected to the proceeding of all the other reactions that lead to the production of carbon dioxide (e.g. decarboxylation), except though APR. In order to understand the influence of the catalyst on the excess CO2 production, we reported in Table 3 also the values of the “catalytic excess CO2”, calculated as the difference between the excess CO2 in a catalytic test and its uncatalytic homologous (e.g. 0.5%-0.4 and 0.5%-no cat), as percentage fraction. Looking at the results of such an elaboration, we observed that there is just a slight contribution of the catalyst in the fraction of excess CO2. In particular, it reaches a maximum when 1% of alginate solution is used. When the 2% alginate is used, there is a minimum difference between the catalyzed and uncatalyzed test: this is probably due to greater incidence of homogeneous pathways when a high reactant concentration of the feed is used. Moreover, as it is easily understood, the catalytic excess CO2 increased when the amount of catalyst increased, working at the same initial concentration."
8,Effect of the temperature,"3.3 Effect of the temperature The APR of oxygenated hydrocarbons is thermodynamically favored in the investigated temperature range (between 200 and 235°C). In Table 4 the influence of the temperature on the process performance is shown, both in uncatalyzed and catalyzed tests. When no catalyst was added, a clear influence of the temperature was not observed in the studied range. The carbon conversion to gas was always around 9%; at the same way, the hydrogen yield was about 1.5% with a hydrogen selectivity of about 18%. Looking at the gas phase composition, it is noted that carbon monoxide was not present only at the lowest investigated temperature. Apparently, this phenomenon could be due to the fact that the water gas shift reaction, which is the main responsible of the low presence of carbon monoxide in the system, is exothermic; therefore, it becomes less favored with the increase of the temperature. However, this reason is not completely satisfactory, because it was not detected when the catalyst was added, and this adding would not have any influence on the thermodynamic of the system. Therefore, the reason for the increase in the presence of carbon monoxide without the catalyst should be ascribed probably to its enhancement due to the negative thermodynamics, together with the slow kinetics of the WGS reaction. No detectable change was observed for the composition of the small alkanes in the gas. When the catalyst was added, it was observed an increase in the hydrogen yield with the increase of the temperature, from 3.9 to 5.9 when temperature is moved from 200 to 235°C: this phenomenon is due to the fact that higher temperature promotes CC and CO bond cleavage [35]. However, the dependence from the temperature seemed smaller compared to what is reported in literature: for example, Dumesic et al. found an increase in the CtoG in the case of ethylene glycol APR with 6% Pt/SiO2 from 8.6 to 21.0 moving from 210 to 225°C, together with a four times higher hydrogen turnover frequency [18]. The dependence of the conversion showed a maximum at 225°C with 22.5% of conversion, and then a decrease to 20.5% at 235°C. Making a comparison between the results obtained at 200 and 235°C it appeared that, at almost the same level of conversion, an increase of temperature favored the production of hydrogen with respect to carbon dioxide. The reason could be ascribed to a positive effect of the higher temperature to hinder side reactions that consume H2, together with favorable APR kinetics. The increase in the hydrogen yield is coherent with [32], but this is not true for the carbon conversion to gas. Because of the small dependence of the temperature the possible effect of any transport limitation was considered. In fact, if the external or internal mass transfer would be the kinetic determinant step, the dependence from the temperature would be very small, because the apparent kinetic constant would be linked to a mass transport coefficient, that has a slight dependence on the temperature. For this reason, we performed first an unstirred test. In this case, we observed the same results as in the case in which the stirrer was used: this observation led us to exclude the presence of external transport limitations, being the mass transport coefficient from the bulk to the catalyst surface high enough also in the unstirred case. The possible internal transport limitations may be generally evaluated in an empirical way, running the reaction on progressively smaller particle sizes [36]. In our case, the catalyst is present in a powder form, so we could not follow this criterion. However, looking at the typical values of reaction rate obtained in the case of APR, it can be inferred that the internal mass transport is fast enough not to limit the intrinsic kinetic. It should be observed, moreover, that we are focusing just on the gas phase: the change in temperature could have an influence on the liquid product distribution and this issue will be assessed in a future work."
9,Effect of the reaction time,"3.4 Effect of the reaction time The Table 5 reports the results of the APR tests of 1wt.% of alginate solution as a function of the reaction time, from 1 to 6h. A reference test, in which the reaction was stopped when the temperature set-point was reached, showed a negligible carbon conversion to gas and hydrogen yield. The heating time necessary for reaching the set point was about 30min. It was observed that the hydrogen had an increasing yield up to 6.4% after 2h, and this value was almost constant also at longer reaction time. The carbon conversion to gas reached 23.2% after 2h, and then there was a plateau. Focusing on the composition of the gas phase, after 2h, it was constituted mainly by hydrogen (33.3%) and carbon dioxide (57.6%); this composition was almost maintained throughout all the reaction time, leading to the same quality of the gas per different investigated time (in terms of calorific value). In literature, many researches have carried out the APR tests in continuous system. For this reason, it is difficult to make a comparison with previous results reported on the influence of the reaction time. Nevertheless, it was reported also in some precedent works that an apparent plateau in the conversion to gas and liquid products appears after 2h of reaction [32,37,38]. More importantly, a plateau was observed also when an actual biomass was tested at 225°C in aqueous environment, leading to a stabilization of the pressure after 2h [39]. The Fig. 2 shows the evolution with time of the amount of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the two species most present in the gas phase. The figure underlines in a clear way that after 2h the production of hydrogen was apparently terminated. This phenomenon could imply several explanations. The first one is due to a thermodynamic constraint, i.e. the observed plateau could be determined by the achievement of an equilibrium condition, so that no more hydrogen can be produced; however this hypothesis does not seem completely satisfactory, because the thermodynamic analysis carried out on compounds with such a C:O ratio showed that the APR reaction is strongly favored at the temperatures investigated in this work [30] up to completely produce CO2 and H2 or small alkanes that are more favoured (their formation is only limited by kinetic constraints); another possible reason to explain the observed phenomenon could be ascribed to a block of the reaction due to the deactivation of the catalyst: this argument will be extensively investigated and discussed in Section 3.8. However, another hypothesis is that, hidden in this flat reaction profile, there is the simultaneous production of hydrogen by aqueous phase reforming and consuming of hydrogen by hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, methanation and Fischer-Tropsch reactions. Regarding the latter supposition, the study of the liquid phase that will be presented in Section 3.6 may give a hint on the causes of the phenomenon."
10,Effect of the hydrogen pressure,"3.5 Effect of the hydrogen pressure The influence of the hydrogen pressure was investigated carrying out two tests with different H2 partial pressure, using gas cylinders with pure hydrogen and 5% hydrogen in argon. The results obtained, together with the comparison without initial hydrogen, are reported in Table 6 . In this case, the hydrogen yield was defined considering the amount of hydrogen produced, that is the difference between the moles of hydrogen at the end and the moles being present in the gas headspace at the beginning of the reaction. The Table shows that the increase in the hydrogen partial pressure caused an important decrease of the hydrogen yield, whereas the carbon conversion to gas remained almost constant. The latter result was unexpected looking at what is present in literature. The reason for the difference in the results may be ascribed to the fact that we are working at lower hydrogen pressure compared with the literature, so the amount of dissolved hydrogen is small. Using the Henry’s law, we estimated that 3bar of hydrogen would dissolve in the liquid 1mol of H2 per 50mol of alginate, maybe too low to have a “kinetic influence” on the conversion of the feed in carbon-containing gaseous species. Despite of this, it can be gradually consumed, participating to hydrogenation reactions that involve the intermediate products, in a “series-reaction” selectivity, worsening the selectivity, and globally diminishing the initial amount present in the headspace. The characterization of the liquid phase, assessed in a future work, should help to valorize this hypothesis showing a higher presence of hydrogenated compounds. It is highlighted that the Y-H2 decreased slightly up to 5.1% with 5% of H2 in the initial gas, but it was less than the initial amount when the initial atmosphere was constituted only by H2 (about 10% of the initial hydrogen was consumed). Reaction studies on the kinetics of APR of ethylene glycol with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have shown that H2 inhibits the rate of H2 production (−0.7 order) indicating that surface H could block reaction sites under reaction conditions [17]. Moreover, it would hinder the equilibrium of the water-gas-shift reaction, globally reducing the production of hydrogen [19]. In this sense, Neira D’Angelo et al. performed the APR of sorbitol with a continuous stripping of hydrogen in a microchannel reactor, using nitrogen as stripping agent. They thought that what is limiting is the removal of hydrogen from the catalyst surface to the gas phase via mass transfer. They observed the increase of the conversion thanks to the benefic effect of reducing the hydrogen partial pressure, that was doubled in the fixed bed reactor and almost three times higher in the case of a microchannel reactor [26,40]. Confirming this hypothesis, they observed a decrease in the liquid hydrogenated products. This is thought as an alternative to the development of the aqueous phase reforming process, not with the goal of the hydrogen production, but the production of alkanes from oxygenated biomass. In fact, Huber et al. observed that increasing the hydrogen partial pressure increases the rate of hydrogenation compared to the CC bond cleavage, increasing the conversion of carbon to liquid products, instead of gas species [41]. Dealing with a batch reactor, we tried to approximate the conditions of a stripping carrying out a series of tests purging the produced gas within a time interval of two hours. The Fig. 3 compares the amount of hydrogen produced with and without the purge steps. It was observed that, thanks to the first purge step, there was an increase in the hydrogen production, moving from 3.2 to 3.8mmol, whereas without the purge step the production seemed stopped at 3.2mmol. Such an occurrence would indicate that the block that appeared after 2h should not be connected to a rapid deactivation of the catalyst, but more likely to a complex reaction scheme and kinetic constraints. Therefore, the kinetic constraint would be overwhelmed because the purge of the gas atmosphere helped eliminate the block due to the adsorption of hydrogen on the active sites. The second purge, performed after 4h from the beginning, gave no apparent effect, and the amount of produced hydrogen remained approximately constant. However, this behavior can be due to the lower concentration of alginate in the solution, which influences directly the kinetic of the reaction. This occurrence confirmed that the block cannot be due to thermodynamic constraints, because the removal of the products should have pushed the reaction towards the conversion of the substrate. At the same way, it cannot be only due to a kinetic control linked to the concentration of hydrogen in the gas atmosphere, as suggested from literature. Indeed, maintaining a high hydrogen concentration may lead to dehydration and hydrogenation with the formation of intermediate species, that will not further react by reforming reactions. For this reason, we could infer that after 4h there was an important conversion of the starting feed in other liquid products that are not subjectable to give hydrogen with consistent kinetics, as carboxylic or dicarboxylic acids. This hypothesis is further explained in the next paragraph."
11,Characterization of the liquid phase,"3.6 Characterization of the liquid phase HPLC analysis was performed on the liquid phase collected in each test carried out at different reaction time. Aqueous phase reforming can produce a plethora of oxygenated compounds (aldehydes, alcohols, carboxylic acids) as a result of series/parallel reactions such as dehydration or isomerization [20]. Because of the complexity of the mixture, there was a frequent peak overlapping in the chromatograms. For this reason, the results cannot be considered as fully quantitative, neither it was possible the identification of each compound present in the liquid phase. Nevertheless, it was important to identify some key components, looking also at previous works that where focused only on the condensed phase derived from the hydrothermal treatment of an alginate solution [13,27]. Their presence, even if not fully representative of the possible species present in the liquid phase, may give an indication of the complex reactions pathways that are involved during the aqueous phase reforming. In Fig. 4 it is reported the evolution with time of four simple compounds recognized in the chromatograms. They were chosen both because of their simple identification and because they can be considered representative of class of compounds present in the liquid phase. It was observed that acetic acid and propionic acid maintained almost a constant concentration once formed, and this seems particularly true for the latter. This is a known phenomenon in literature, because they are stable in aqueous environment at this temperature. This behavior would explain what we reported in the previous section: indeed, because a fraction of the initial alginate molecule is converted in these stable species, we lose the possibility of further (and full) production of hydrogen that is “locked” in these molecules that are unreactive from a kinetic point of view, even if thermodynamically unstable. Therefore, even if the thermodynamic analysis suggests us the conversion to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the kinetic constraints linked to the slow APR kinetics for these intermediate compounds led to a block in the hydrogen production. Nozawa et al. studied the APR of acetic acid over Ru/TiO2 catalyst, and they observed that at 200°C the H2 formation stopped after 200min; together with this result, they reported that it is generally accepted that the selective conversion to H2 and CO2 is easier starting from alcohols, in which the CC bond is activated by an adjacent OH group; conversely, the non-activated methyl group is transformed to CH4 [42]. Maleic and succinic acid are two dicarboxylic acids, the former with an unsaturated bond. The formation of dicarboxylic acids was studied in basic aqueous systems [43], where they are formed by β-elimination, Lorby de Bruyn–Alberta van Ekenstein Transformation (LBET) and other reactions (hydrolysis/dehydration). Even if we worked at neutral pH, their presence could be explained by the higher value of the ionic product of water in comparison with ambient conditions. It was observed that the maleic acid decreased after the first hour: this could happen because the unsaturated bond may be hydrogenated by the hydrogen coming from the APR, and this could be a general trend for all unsaturated species. Conversely, this decrease was not observed in the evolution trend of succinic acid, whose concentration is one order of magnitude higher than the concentration of the maleic acid: the reason may be ascribed to the fast hydrogenation of the double bond in the presence of the Pt-based catalyst. Instead, it is highlighted that the succinic acid tended to accumulate over time, because of its stability in hydrothermal conditions. The trends observed for these species may be similar for other stable compounds (not recognized in the HPLC chromatograms) and would partially cause the appearance of the plateau in the production of hydrogen. These results lead the interesting path for a deeper characterization of the liquid phase, that will be assessed in a future work. As stated in the introduction, the combination of the value-added compounds obtained in the liquid phase and the energetic value of the gas phase, together with an improvement of the performance, would leave an interesting path for the exploitation of the alginate."
12,Effect of the pH,"3.7 Effect of the pH The importance of the pH of the feed solution for addressing the product distribution is well noted in the study of APR of model compounds [30]. For this reason, three tests at different pH were carried out to evaluate this effect also in the case of the catalytic APR of alginate. The pH of the solution was equal to 6.3 when no other reagents were added but the alginate aqueous system. The Table 7 shows that the conversion slightly decreased with the increasing pH, going from 24.3% at pH=3 to 20.4% at pH=12; on the other hand, the hydrogen yield increased by one order of magnitude, moving from 1.2% to 10.9%. At the same way, the hydrogen selectivity has a disruptive increase, going from 5.7% at pH=3 to 70.9% at pH=12. The lowest performance at acidic condition can be explained following the mechanism proposed by Dumesic et al. for ethylene glycol: the acid environment promotes dehydration reactions of the feed, followed by hydrogenation (at expense of the produced hydrogen) on the metal sites to give alcohols; the latter can further react, leading to the formation of alkanes, reducing in a drastic way the hydrogen yield and selectivity [30]. This suggested path becomes still more difficult and challenging starting from a complicated feed as alginate, where several side reactions can occur, giving a considerable number of products. Because of the already mentioned complex characterization of the liquid phase, it was not possible to investigate the change of the liquid product distribution, giving in this way a clearer understanding of the pH effect on the APR. Further studies focused on the condensed phase would be interesting to be aware of the mechanisms regarding alkanes and value-added compounds formation."
13,Catalyst reutilization and characterization,"3.8 Catalyst reutilization and characterization The results obtained studying the influence of the reaction time suggest that a possible deactivation of the catalyst may occur. For this reason, we performed three tests of reutilization and the results are reported in Fig. 5 . As it is clearly observed, when the catalyst was reutilized, there was no sign of losing of the catalytic activity, as it was expected instead. The carbon conversion to gas remained constant, and an increase in the hydrogen selectivity was noticed, that was maintained also at the third use. This is an important result because it means that no morphological or chemical modification was induced on the surface, such to affect the outcome of the process. In general, this would be a fundamental feature because the resistance to deactivation is one of the most important characteristics that a heterogeneous catalyst must have to ensure its application in the industrial reality. In order to definitely exclude the possibility of catalyst deactivation, we performed a test in which the liquid product obtained in a test was subjected to a new test of APR using a fresh catalyst. The results are reported in Fig. 6 . As it is clearly observed, a very small carbon to gas was obtained (4.9%), together with 2.4% of hydrogen selectivity. This result seems to state clearly that the catalyst is not responsible for the observed plateau, because otherwise we should have seen better performance in the second test. On the contrary, it suggests that the organic compounds present in the liquid phase are not prone to the production of hydrogen, and globally recalcitrant to APR. XRD analysis were performed on the fresh and spent catalyst in order to assess any structural change in the catalyst and the results are reported in Fig. 7 . The characteristic peak of Pt is located at 40°. From the results, it is observed that the peak was not present in the case of the fresh catalyst; on the other hand, it appeared when the spent catalyst was used. This result can be seen as an indication of sintering of the particles. In fact, the absence of the peak can be ascribed to a good dispersion of the active sites, that can become worse when the catalyst was recovered after the reaction. The hydrothermal stability of the heterogeneous catalysts is a fundamental issue in the study of suitable catalysts for promoting the APR [44]. For this reason, BET measurements of the fresh and spent Pt/C catalysts were carried out to investigate any modification in the textural characteristics. The spent catalyst is the one recovered after the six hours test. A substantial decrease of the surface area was observed, moving from 1271 to 903m2/g, together with a decrease of the pore volume, from 0.987 to 0.703m3/g; however, the pore size remained constant at 3nm. Despite of these modifications, we did not observe a decrease in the performance during the reaction time, as discussed before. The leaching of platinum from the support was investigated by ICP-MS analysis in order to generally assess the stability of the catalyst under the challenging hydrothermal conditions. The analysis showed an effective 3.2wt.% Pt loading with the fresh catalyst; after the reaction, the loading of the active metal remained almost constant (just 0.0036% of the initial platinum was lost), therefore leaching was excluded as a possible mechanism of worsening of the catalyst performance. This result is also coherent with the tests of reutilization, where a possible leaching would have hindered the production of hydrogen in the second and third use. Globally, these outcomes suggest that the kinetic difficulty of the intermediate compounds is the main cause of the plateau observed in the gas phase. As reported previously, further efforts will be addressed to characterize deeper the liquid phase, helping to better understand this phenomenon. Finally, the deposition of coke on the catalyst is another possible deactivation mechanism, responsible for the progressive worsening of the performance during the reaction time [18]. A small carbon deposition was reported on the first work on aqueous phase reforming and it is generally considered as a possible cause of deactivation, even if it should be minimized working at such low temperature [16,28]. On the other hand, Luo et al. in their work on APR of glycerol with alumina supported Pt-based catalysts observed on the used platinum catalyst carbon content up to 7.18wt%, indicating that carbonaceous entities formed on the catalyst. These information were used to account for the deactivation in their investigation [45]. A clear influence of the nature of the support on the obtained results has been accepted, and this is true also in the case of the sensitivity to the deactivation by coke [28]. In fact, alumina-supported catalysts, despite of high initial reaction rate, are prone to deactivation by sintering and carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface; conversely, carbon supported catalysts, despite of lower performance than alumina, show slighter deactivation. Working with a carbon supported catalyst it was difficult to characterize this issue. Nevertheless, we performed a thermogravimetric analysis on a fresh and spent catalyst, and the results obtained are reported in Fig. 8 . It can be observed that the spent catalyst started to lose weight before than the fresh one, at around 170°C. This can be due to the volatilization of small organic compounds that remained on the catalyst surface. Then, at 300°C, both the catalysts started to lose a quantitative amount of weight, and it is due to the combustion of the support. From this analysis, we cannot state whether there is coke (because it would be hidden in the strong slope at 300°C), but we can presume the presence of small organics that start to volatilize at temperature below 200°C. Together with this information, at the end of the reaction we recovered 0.83g of solid phase (after the drying step described in the paragraph 2.2), compared to 0.8g of catalyst put at the beginning of the reaction. This means that there is at least a slight increase of the weight and, therefore, some species are present on the catalyst. Together with organic depositions, the presence of carbonates due to the sodium and carbon dioxide in the aqueous reaction environment (confirmed by the results of inorganic carbon analysis) may lead to inorganic deposits. In fact, water at high temperature is a less polar solvent, therefore the salts are less soluble and may interfere with the catalytic activity. An overall carbon balance of the system was achieved within 10% deviation from the carbon in the inlet solution. Despite the apparent high value this result was obtained also elsewhere [18] and can be attributed to the carbon deposited on the catalyst and to the inevitable loss during the experimental procedure."
14,Conclusions,"The catalytic aqueous phase reforming of alginate was investigated for the production of hydrogen. The variations of several parameters were analyzed (effect of alginate, catalyst loading, temperature, time reaction, pH, hydrogen partial pressure) to examine their influence on the carbon conversion to gas, the yield and selectivity of hydrogen. It was observed that there is an increase of the CtoG with the increasing catalyst amount and that the maximum hydrogen selectivity was reached at 0.4g of catalyst; at the same way, there was a benefic effect of the increasing temperature, with a maximum of performance at 225°C. On the other hand, there was a negative effect increasing the alginate concentration, since the carbon conversion to gas decreased because of side reactions that take place in the liquid phase. The analysis of the evolution of the gas products with time showed a plateau after 2h for hydrogen: this phenomenon was ascribed mainly to the formation of products that have low tendency to react and give hydrogen, even though its production would be thermodynamically favoured. The variation of pH showed a strong benefic effect when the APR is carried out in basic conditions, increasing by one order of magnitude the hydrogen selectivity. Therefore, it was confirmed what is present in literature, where working at low pH gave rise to problems of competitivity of the produced hydrogen with other reactions, such as dehydration/hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis. Finally, the characterization of the catalysts showed a modification of the surface area and pore volume under hydrothermal conditions, together with a slight deposition of coke and sintering of the Pt particles; on the other hand, leaching of the active metal was not observed. Our study confirmed the dependence of the typical reaction conditions on the performance obtained by the APR of a more complex feed respect to the typical ones investigated, giving validation also to previous results in terms of representability of complex systems. With this work, we tried to enlarge the portfolio of molecules that can be investigated for the production of hydrogen. Even if the results are less positive than the ones present in literature, further research efforts will be assessed to have a better comprehension of the phenomena involved in the catalytic aqueous phase reforming of alginate: the sustainable exploitation of both the liquid (with value-added molecules) and gas phase (with a high energetic value) would be essential with the aim of developing a biorefinery for a carbohydrate-based economy."
