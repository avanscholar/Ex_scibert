0,Introduction,"The increasing demand of energy in the developing countries has led to the depletion of fossil fuels at a high rate. The primary energy consumption has increased worldwide by 1% in 2016 following a growth of 0.9% in 2015 as well as 1% in 2014 [1]. In the present scenario fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal are the world's leading energy sources. The excess consumption of these fossil fuels further creates greenhouse gas emission and poses threat to human life. Thus it becomes a challenge for governments, engineers, scientists and economists so as to mitigate the ill effects of these gases. To overcome these challenges lower alcohols such as 1-butanol as an alternative fuel is gaining importance [2]. Butanol is conventionally produced through the ABE (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation where bacteria like clostridium acetobutylicum and clostridium bjerinkci ferment biomass under anaerobic conditions thereby producing acetone, butanol, and ethanol with a proportion of 3:6:1 [3–5]. Bio-butanol obtained by ABE fermentation process is now considered as a potential biofuel. Bio-butanol like 1-butanol have similar properties as 1-butanol obtained from petroleum products. It has a higher calorific value (29.2 MJ/dm3) as compared to ethanol (19.6 MJ/dm3) and has a lesser flammability and lower hydrophilicity values. The RON and MON numbers of butanol are also close to petrol while at the same time less corrosive than ethanol. All these features make 1-butanol as a useful additive to gasoline and as biofuels [3, 5–7]. However the separation of lower chain alcohols such as 1-butanol is difficult as it forms azeotropic mixtures with water [8–10]. Hence it becomes essential to separate 1-butanol from water, so as to lessen the effect of azeotrope formation. It should be noted that a high concentration of 1-butanol inhibits the growth of microbes and bacterial cell in the fermentation broth. Hence a systematic removal of this compound is essential [3, 11]. Methods such as extraction, adsorption, pervaporation, gas striping and membrane separation have been conventionally used for the separation of 1-butanol during fermentation broth [3, 12–18]. Membrane separation and pervaporation are expensive due to its low mass transfer rates and requirement of low pressure. Adsorbents for butanol have low capacity which discourages its use in industrial or semi-industrial plant. On the other hand membrane reactors immobilizes the microorganisms, but in industrial scale the cell immobilized technique possess more disadvantages due to poor mechanical strength and an increase in mass transfer resistance. The leakage of cells from the matrices is also a frequent problem [3, 13, 14]. In pervaporation, polydimethylsiloxane membranes are generally used for separating 1-butanol. The drawback of the method is higher cost of production in the lower pressure side of the membrane. Selection of a suitable polymer forming the active part of the membrane is another crucial issue in this case [2]. Pure distillation process is not economical as the difference of boiling point of 1-butanol (117.7 °C) is almost similar to that of water (100 °C) [19]. Previous authors have suggested hybrid extractive-distillation separation process, which include distillation column coupled with liquid-liquid extraction making the separation economical and efficient [19, 20]. Groot et al. [13] and Qureshi et al. [21] have used the hybrid downstream process for the separation purpose because of its inherent high selectivity and operational advantages [13, 21]. Further Liu et al. [22] have also used extraction in combination with distillation. Looking at the disadvantages as mentioned above, solvent extraction is considered an effective method for the separation especially when certain hydrophobic organic solvents possess high affinity for 1-butanol and low solubility with water. Conventional solvents such as mesitylene and oleyl alcohol are nowadays used for extraction of alcohols [3]. Mesitylene is a derivative of benzene which is produced from coal tar and thus is easily available. However on the other side it is known as a pollutant or VOC when combusted. The extraction experiments if considered at ambient conditions, can reduce the harmful effects of mesitylene, thereby approving their use as potential solvents. On the contrary the other solvent, oleyl alcohol is eco-friendly in nature and also occurs naturally in fish oils. It is known to be completely hydrophobic in nature. Looking at the hydrophobic nature of both the solvents, a need is thus felt to evaluate the effectiveness for extraction by measuring the Liquid Liquid Equilbirum (LLE) data with 1-butanol and water. The LLE data so obtained will then be regressed using NRTL and UNIQUAC model through ASPEN and then confirmed further by the prediction of their tie lines by COSMO-SAC model. Thereafter a conceptual design of the entire extractant system using the ASPEN suite of program shall be explored. This has been achieved by the incorporation of a hybrid extractor flowsheet which will be discussed in the concluding section."
1,Experimental details,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Table 1 shows the chemicals used in the present study along with their purities. Purities of mesitylene, oleyl alcohol and 1-butanol were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and analysis of peaks indicated negligible impurities. The NMR solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide‑d 6 (DMSO‑d 6 ≥ 99.8%) supplied by Merck, Germany was used as received. All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. In order to check its purity, the densities were measured by Anton Paar Density Meter (DMA 4500 M) so as to compare the manufacturer specification. Further the viscosities were measured by a viscometer (Anton Paar Phsica MCR301). The water content of mesitylene and oleyl Alcohol were measured by Karl Fischer Titrator (870 KF Titrino plus). The measured densities of all the chemicals were within ±1% of their literature values."
3,Procedure and composition analysis,"2.2 Procedure and composition analysis For the generation of LLE data, a number of LLE experiments were carried out. In each experiment, known quantities of components were added in 15–30 ml size glass vial. Feed compositions were prepared in such a way that the mixtures of solvent, 1-butanol and water formed heterogeneous regions. The sealed glass vials were kept in a thermostatic shaker bath which was operated at 200 rpm and 298.15 K (uncertainty of ±0.01 K). The sample was stirred for 6 h at this condition and then kept undisturbed for 12 h to ensure the equilibrium of the two phases. The samples were collected from each phase using syringe for composition analysis. The characterization of both the phases was carried out by 1H NMR (400 MHz, Make Bruker). DMSO‑d 6 and CDCl3 were used as NMR solvents, for the raffinate phase and extract phase respectively. The raffinate phase consisting predominantly water is not miscible with CDCl3, thus DMSO‑d 6 was used as 1H NMR solvent for characterization of raffinate phase [23, 24]. The 1H NMR spectra of pure components of mesitylene, oleyl alcohol, 1-butanol and water were obtained by using both DMSO‑d 6 and CDCl3. For checking the accuracy of NMR spectra, we prepared some known mixtures (water + 1-butanol + mesitylene) in the homogenous region which were close to the binodal curve and then obtained their 1H NMR. The measured results were found to be in good agreement with the actual compositions with an uncertainty level of 0.001. For 1H NMR analysis, sample of 0.1 ml from each phase was mixed with 0.5 ml of NMR solvent in NMR tube (Sigma-Aldrich). Reference peak for each 1H NMR solvent, namely DMSO‑d 6 (2.5 ppm) and CDCl3 (7.27 ppm) were recorded. Peaks from each 1H NMR sheet were then used for the calculation of mole fraction of each component in respective phase. In extract phase (Fig. 1 ), three independent hydrogen atoms (>CH-) at ~6.95 ppm was considered to quantify mesitylene. Similarly, in case of oleyl alcohol (Fig. 3), two independent hydrogen atoms at ~5.34 ppm quantified oleyl alcohol. The methyl group (-CH2-) having a peak at ~3.75 ppm was considered as the corresponding peak for 1-butanol. Due to the shifting of the peak in the mixture [25], water shows a peak at ~5.0 ppm in CDCl3 solvent. In raffinate phase (Fig. 2 ), three independent hydrogen displayed peak at ~6.79 ppm, which was considered to quantify mesitylene. Similarly, in case of oleyl alcohol two independent hydrogen atoms at ~4.77 ppm was considered to quantify oleyl Alcohol (Fig. 4 ). Methyl group (-CH2-) having a peak at ~3.40 ppm was again considered as the reference for computing the concentration of 1-butanol. As before water shows a peak at ~3.97 ppm [26] in DMSO‑d 6. The concentrations of each individual component were then calculated by Eq. (1). (1) x i = H i ∑ i = 1 n H i where, H i = the peak area of a single hydrogen for sample (s); x i = the mole fraction of component in the mixture."
4,Results and discussions,
5,LLE experimental data,"3.1 LLE experimental data The LLE experimental data for the systems, mesitylene (1) + 1-butanol (2) + water (3) and oleyl alcohol (1) + 1-butanol (2) + water (3) are reported in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. The distribution coefficient (β) and selectivity (S) of 1-butanol are calculated using Eqs. (2) and (3) as follows [27]: (2) β butanol = x butanol E x butanol R (3) S = β butanol β water where, x butanol and x w are the mole fractions of 1-butanol and water, respectively. The superscripts E and R denote the extract (E) and raffinate (R) phase, respectively. Higher values of selectivity indicate a better ability for the extraction of 1-butanol from water. The distribution coefficient refers to the amount of solvent (mesitylene and oleyl alcohol) used to effect the separation. Since both solvents are hydrophobic in nature, mole fraction of mesitylene and oleyl alcohol in aqueous phase was limited to 0.001 and 0.002 respectively. The corresponding mole fraction of water in solvent rich phase or extract phase was also found to be 0.089 and 0.066 (Tables 2 and 3 respectively). In both the systems, type I LLE behavior can be observed. NMR spectra for raffinate phase are found to be almost free of solvent but predominantly water (Figs. 2 and 4). From this it can be confirmed that the points of raffinate phase lie in the extreme corner of the binary axis of water and 1-butanol. From Figs. 5–8 , it can be observed that the points are nearer to 100%, i.e. water which indicates that the entire 1-butanol is transferred to extract phase. It also confirms a higher distribution coefficient due to a large difference of 1-butanol concentration in both the phases. It is to be noted that the concentration of 1-butanol inside the fermentation broth is only 2% (mass). Tables 2 and 3 show the comparison of selectivity and distribution coefficient values at lower concentrations of 1-butanol. It reports a value close to infinity and ~6367 for mesitylene and oleyl alcohol respectively. This is higher than the previous reported work with ionic liquids such as 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,3-dimethylimidozolium tetra fluoroborate (S = 30) [28]. This is also higher than that reported for hydrophilic or hydrophobic ILs [5]."
6,Thermodynamic modeling,"3.2 Thermodynamic modeling Once the LLE data are available, we can then use these data to regress the binary interaction parameters in NRTL and UNIQUAC. Further steady state simulation studies are proposed for the recovery of solute and reusability of solvent. This has been performed using the commercial software Aspen Plus V8.8®. The NRTL and UNIQUAC interaction parameters as listed in the ASPEN-LLE database [29, 30] were used to predict the tie lines. Aspen built in model parameters, ASPEN-LLE database [29, 30] have been used for the binary pairs where it is available. In case of missing parameters, the NRTL model parameters were estimated via UNIFAC group contribution method in Aspen Plus itself [30] using “R-PCES”, which means utilizing Property Constant EStimation (PCES) regression. PCES provides the Bondi method for estimating the R and Q parameters for UNIFAC functional groups. The Aspen Plus physical property system then uses these parameters in the UNIFAC, Dortmund UNIFAC, and Lyngby UNIFAC model. The Bondi method here requires the molecular structure as an input. It should be noted that the binary NRTL interaction parameters for mesitylene-butanol has been carried out by R-PCES regression (Table 4a ). In a similar manner binary UNIQUAC interaction parameters were predicted using R-PCES for mesitylene-butanol system (Table 4b ) [29, 30]. Quantum-chemical based solvation models such as COSMO-SAC [31] is another pathway which provides an alternative mean of predicting activity coefficients and other thermodynamic properties using a statistical mechanical framework. The geometry optimization was carried out with Gaussian 09, from at least three initial geometries of component. The geometries were drawn by Gauss View 5.0 visualization package. Frequency analysis was carried out on each complex at the same level of theory. An absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies determined the true energy minimum structures. The COSMO files once generated were then used to generate the sigma profile [32–35] of the molecules, which were then used in the statistical framework namely SAC or Segment Activity Coefficient (SAC) in order to obtain the activity coefficient. The activity coefficients were then used with the modified Rashford Rice Algorithm [33, 36] to generate the tie lines. This solves the isofugactiy problem. Assuming the process to occur isothermally, the compositions of the extract and raffinate phases are calculated using a flash algorithm as described by the modified Rashford-Rice Algorithm [33, 36]. Also assume that the effect of pressure (P) on LLE calculations is assumed to be negligible. To start with, the feed concentration (z i ) is calculated using the following Eq. (4) (I, II: Phases): (4) z i = x i I + x i II 2 In the next step, the values of distribution coefficient (K i , i = 1,2,3) are calculated using Eq. (5): (5) K i = x i II x i I = γ i I γ i II Here γ i I and γ i II are predicted using the COSMO-SAC model. With the values of K i the isothermal flash Eq. (6) is solved using: (6) f Ψ = ∑ z i 1 − K i 1 + Ψ K i − 1 = 0 subject to, (7) Fz i = L 1 x i I + L 2 x i II (8) and Ψ = L 1 / F Here F, L 1 and L 2 represents the flow rate of the Feed, extract and raffinate phases respectively. Eq. (8) which is non-linear in nature is first solved for Ψ. This equation is solved in ASPEN for NRTL and UNIQUAC model using Aspen Properties Default Regression System.This uses the Britt-Luecke Algorithm with Deming Initialization and Maximum-likehood objective function [37, 38]. Thereafter, the mole fractions in both phases are calculated via Eqs. (9) and (10). (9) x i I = z i 1 + Ψ K i − 1 (10) x i II = K i x i I The interaction parameters so obtained are also checked and verified by the ASPEN property bank i.e. ASPEN-LLE and ASPEN-VLE. Binary interaction parameters which are not available are estimated using UNIFAC or R-PCES group contribution method [30]. Further as before for NRTL and UNIQUAC, the ternary tie lines so obtained are then compared with experimental tie lines for butanol using COSMO-SAC (Figs. 9–10 ) model. The goodness of fit is usually measured by root mean square deviation (RMSD) defined as (12) RMSD = ∑ k = 1 m ∑ i = 1 c ∑ j = 1 2 x ik j − x ̂ ik j 2 2 mc 1 / 2 where, m refers to the number of tie lines and c refers to the number of components (viz. 3 for the present system). Here x ik j and x ̂ ik j are the experimental and predicted values of composition (mole fraction) for component i in the k th tie line for phase l, respectively. This requires all the experimental of Tables 2 and 3. Overall the NRTL, UNIQUAC and COSMO-SAC models gave root mean square deviation (RMSD) values as (0.21%, 0.34% and 1.34%); and (0.16%, 0.21% and 0.83%) for the systems mesitylene (1) + 1-butanol (2) + water (3) and oleyl alcohol (1) + 1-butanol (2) + water (3) respectively. It has been observed that among the NRTL, UNIQUAC and COSMO-SAC models, the average root mean square deviation (RMSD) values obtained were lesser than unity for NRTL and UNIQUAC models. This is expected as in NRTL [39] the interaction parameters have been regressed using the experimental data, while for COSMO-SAC [31, 39] this is predicted using a statistical mechanical framework. After successful thermodynamics modeling we shall now initiate a flowsheet to scale-up the laboratory scale data to an industrially feasible unit using Aspen Plus V8.8®. This will include optimization of the extractor and distillation unit and then coupling it to get the final TAC or the Total Annual Cost."
7,Hybrid extraction-distillation unit,"3.3 Hybrid extraction-distillation unit In an earlier work [40], a hybrid separation processes is found to be an effective tool for reducing the energy intensive step of distillation. In the hybrid extraction, extraction column operates at ambient temperature and pressure which implies that there is no requirement of additional energy. It hence provides significant savings in the operating cost as well as the Total Annual Cost when compared to explicit extractive distillation. In the present case, feed is highly aqueous as 1-butanol is <5 mol% (0.8 water and 0.2 1-butanol w/w). Extractive distillation will be not economical in these cases, as it will require a huge amount of steam to vaporize the water portion due to that fact that 1-butanol has a higher boiling point. Hence hybrid extraction−distillation system has been proposed in this work. In such a scenario, the entire water gets extracted from the raffinate phase of the extractor unit due to the LLE operation. This also reduces the energy consumption in the subsequent distillation column. Hybrid separation processes can be effective for reducing the demand of energy [40], as previous authors [41, 42] have concluded that the solvent mesitylene can be used efficiently for the separation of 1-butanol from ABE fermentation products. This further needs to be compared with a conventional solvent such as oleyl alcohol. Hence in the present study, a hybrid extraction-distillation processes has been adopted. The operating conditions for the process design were selected in order to lesser cost while respecting the requirement of an elevated purity of the raffinate. It is a well-known fact that both cost and purity rise when the solvent/feed flow ratio in the column and the purity of the solvent stream increase. Further the process costs for solvent recovery grows when the purity required is high. In this case we have considered solvents to be 100% pure which is close to the manufacturer specification. A similar strategy has been used by previous authors [42] and is explained in Figs. 11 and 12 concisely. In our work the cost factor has been kept to a minimum by performing the simulation at 298.15 K and 1 atm pressure. For performing the solvent extraction process, a minimization of the production cost is necessary in order to recover the extracting solvent. Further this needs to be reused and recycled in the extraction flowsheet [29, 43]. In our work we have optimized the extractor (Fig. 13 ), followed by the distillation column (Fig. 14 ). The overall flow sheet as given in Fig. 15 consists of a liquid–liquid extractor (Extractor) and a component separator (Distillation). Together the whole flow sheet was optimized where the operating conditions similar to the feed composition (0.2 w/w fraction 1-butanol), which corresponds to the first tie line of the LLE data (Table 2) was used in this study. A novel hybrid downstream process (Fig. 15) has been proposed for the production of 1-butanol at the rate 5000 kg/h (4.38 × 104 ton/yr). In the feed stream it is assumed that the feed which is the mixture of 1-butanol and water has a flow rate 25,000 kg/h containing 0.2 w/w 1-butanol. The binary interaction parameters used are given in Tables 4a and 4b. The study has been carried out for a solvent purity rate ranging from 98 to 100%. The NRTL thermodynamic model has been used for the simulation and the missing binary interaction parameters were estimated by UNIFAC or via R-PCES as per ASPEN protocol [30]. It should be noted that the NRTL model here refers to the NRTL interactions parameters as listed in ASPEN-LLE database and should not be confused with this work. Table 5 shows the empirical correlations and parameters used for economic sizing. The optimum diameter of distillation column is based on vapor velocity [44]. For calculating the heat exchanger area these parameters are required. Heat duties and reboiler duties are determined by overall simulation. The payback period has been assumed to be three years. We shall now discuss the optimization of the extractor (Section 3.3.1) followed by the extractor (Section 3.3.2) in the ensuing sections. A comparison of selectivity and distribution ratio for 1-butanol extraction using Ionic Liquids and other solvents are given in Table 6 . 3.3.1 Optimization of extractor Fig. 13 depicts the sensitivity analysis, which eventually helps in optimizing the extraction cost via optimization of number of stages in the extractor column on the basis of f.o.b. purchase cost (Freight on board cost) for the azeotropic mixture (1-butanol + water), using mesitylene as solvent. The feed stream contains water 0.8 (w/w) and 1-butanol 0.2 (w/w) with a mass flow rate 25,000 kg/h. Mesitylene here has been used as a solvent for the extraction of 1-butanol. The operating conditions for the extractor column used was p = 1 atm and T = 25 °C. The Design Spec (DS-1) configuration in Aspen Plus V8.8® has been invoked so as to achieve a recovery of 100% 1-butanol. This is performed by keeping the solvent flow rate as variable. Total number of stages has been varied from 5 to 20 (Fig. 13b). The f.o.b cost for each stage is also mentioned. It has been observed that the f.o.b cost is minimum in case of total number of stages 7 (Fig. 13b). After optimization of solvent flow rate for extractor, selectivity analysis has been used to optimize the solvent flow rate keeping number of stages as 7 for the extractor. Once the optimized number of stages is known we then varied the solvent flow rate via Design Spec configuration(DS-1) and calculated the f.o.b cost as given in Table 5. Overall the sensitivity analysis shall provide us information with respect to 1-butanol recovery and solvent (mesitylene) flow rate for a fixed total number of stages in extractor. Fig.13c shows the sensitivity result i.e. 1-butanol recovery with solvent flow rate in the extract stream. A total of 7 stages have been used in Fig. 13c. Fig. 13c predicts the change in yield of butanol by varying the solvent feed rate. In such a situation, the number of stages i.e. 7 is fixed along with a fixed feed rate. It has been observed that 76,000 kg/h mesitylene flow rate is required for a full recovery of 1-butanol. In order to lessen the cost of solvent, the optimal solvent rate was kept at ~30,000 kg/h for a recovery of 0.99 w/w 1-butanol. 3.3.2 Optimization of distillation column Distillation column (RadFrac) has been used for the recovery of solvent (mesitylene) from 1-butanol in the extract stream where the feed is the optimized extract flowrate as obtained in case of extraction (Section 3.3.1). The total height of distillation column is 20% more than the actual height, while the spacing between the two plates is 0.61 m. Eq. (13), shows the height of the vessel required in case of the distillation column [44, 45]. (13) H = 1.2 × 0.61 × N T − 2 where N T − 2 represent total number of stages minus one stage for condenser and one for reboiler. Fig. 14 reports the TAC which includes both capital and energy cost. Here capital cost includes the shell and heat exchange cost. It is found that lesser the number of stages, higher the reboiler heat duty which in turn increases the column diameter and heat exchanger areas. Table 5 shows the basis of economics and equipment sizing equations used for the present cost estimation. For optimizing the distillation column two DESIGN SPEC have been used namely: (a) fix the mass fraction of 1-butanol in the distillate stream at 0.975; and (b) fix the mass fraction of 1-butanol as 0.01 in the bottom stream. The solvent recovered by distillation is then fed back to the extractor after cooling it to 25 °C. Thereafter the distillate rate followed by reflux ratio was varied as per established procedure [44, 46]. The Total Annual Cost, operating cost and capital cost have been calculated for the total number of stage varying from 25 to 65 (Fig. 14b). Here invoking the approach as per Luyben et al. [44, 45], where on the basis of TAC the optimum number of stages is selected. As observed, operating cost is continuously decreasing with increasing number of stages. Now, in the present simulation, reflux ratio (RR) is used to optimize the distillation column, hence the number of stages is considered optimum or economical when the reflux ratio value is the least [47]. An increase in reflux ratio results in a decrease in column height, but on the other hand it leads to an increase of column diameter. This is due to the fact that a large quantity of liquid needs to recycled which necessitates a larger condenser, reboiler and reflux pump [44, 47]. This is the very reason that the fixed cost falls through a minimum and then again rises to infinity at total reflux ratio. At the minimum reflux ratio as per definition, an infinite number of stages are required. It implies fixed cost will be infinite but operating cost will be least in this case. Overall the heating and cooling requirement is found to increase directly with the reflux ratio, as evident in Fig. 14b. Hence from Fig. 14b, the number stages in the distillation column is fixed as 48. This will also help us in obtaining an itemized equipment sizing and its related cost in the next section. 3.3.3 Hybrid extraction-distillation coupled with recycled solvent process flow-sheet In the concluding system, the optimized flow rates from both extractor and distillation column has been connected as per Fig. 15. The extraction column contains seven equilibrium stages (Section 3.3.1) and the distillation column possesses forty eight stages (Section 3.3.2). Mesitylene has been added as a make-up solvent for the material balance (Fig. 15). More than 99% w/w of 1-butanol was extracted using mesitylene as a solvent with a weight fraction ~0.98 w/w, 1-butanol is recovered as a distillate product from the distillation column after the separation of the solvent by distillation. A total condenser has been used in the distillation column. The separated solvent from the distillation is recycled back to the extractor after cooling it to 25 °C. The final purity of 1-butanol from the distillate has been obtained as ~0.98 w/w, when using a fixed distillate and feed rate. It can be seen that the raffinate phase (in extractor) is dominated by water which is inline with our experimental results (Table 2), while the extract phase after solvent separation (via distillation), consists mainly 1-butanol. Distillation of the extract stream gave a recovery of ~99% solvent and the recovered solvent is recycled back to the extractor column after cooling it to 25 °C. Table 7 shows the mass as well as energy balance for the complete process flow sheet. It shows the extraction as well as solvent recovery for the production of 1-butanol at 5000 kg/h using mesitylene as a solvent. After the extraction of 1-butanol,the solvent is recycled back to the extractor again. Presently ~98% of 1-butanol recovery is possible from the distillation column,while at the same time 99.97% 1-butanol is recovered from the extractor by using optimum amount of solvent. Overall the total number of stages is kept as seven in the extractor and 48 in the distillation column. A reflux ratio 2.46 is obtained via individual optimization of extractor (Section 3.3.1) and distillation column (Section 3.3.2). Fig. 16 shows the overall Total Annual Cost with total number of stages of distillation column. In this case, number of stages of the distillation column is varied by keeping the number of stages of extractor and feed rate constant. The overall cost is then calculated using the empirical relationships and design parameters as given in Table 5. The results are shown in Table 8 . It has been observed that for an overall optimum cost (i.e. for a complete process), the optimum number of stages in extractor is eight while the number of stages of the distillation column is 50. This reason is due to the fact that initially we have optimized the extractor cost on the basis of 100% recovery of 1-butanol which shall require a very high solvent mass flow rate (~60,000 kg/h as per Fig. 13b). In order to compromise on the yield but save on the huge solvent cost, we have adopted an optimum amount of solvent flow rate (~30,000 kg/h) from the sensitivity analysis (Fig. 13c).This corresponds to a yield of 97.5% 1-butanol. With this we have conducted the overall TAC as given in Fig. 16 for a complete process setup. Table 8 reports the itemized equipment sizing and its related costs. In this the number of stages in the extractor has been varied while keeping the total number of stages in the distillation column as 48 (as per Fig. 14b)."
8,Conclusions,"Mesitylene and oleyl alcohol has been used for the separation of 1-butanol from their aqueous solution. Improved mass transfer rates coupled with high separation efficiency was observed with mesitylene and oleyl alcohol for the separation of 1-butanol - water mixtures. Larger values of selectivity (399-2591) for both the solvents indicate easier separation of 1-butanol from water. The raffinate phase from the experiment and simulation was found to comprise mainly water with mass composition as high as 99.9% w/w. The slopes of the tie lines and the spread of two-phase region indicated higher separation as it covered a large part of the ternary plot. The ternary system was then correlated by NRTL, UNIQUAC and also predicted by our in house COSMO-SAC model. RMSD values less than unity for NRTL and UNIQUAC model shows an excellent fit to the experimental data. A hybrid extraction-distillation system was proposed so as to effectively separate 1-butanol using mesitylene. An optimized 1-butanol recovery of ~ 98% w/w was obtained for a solvent/feed ratio of 1.16. Thus the current work provided a perfect example of experimental data generated in laboratory scale to process scale-up along with the Total Annual Cost."
