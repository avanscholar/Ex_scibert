0,Introduction,"Many of the agricultural by-product streams in Egypt are not economically used, i.e. 3 million tons of rice straw is burned in the field, creating serious environmental problems (air pollution; smog formation). The well-known “Black Cloud” is a yearly health problem covering all over Cairo. Moreover, in view of the actual rising food prices, high population growth rate, and energy prices in Egypt, H2 production from rice straw wastes via dark anaerobic fermentation process is economically profitable for the country, and environmentally sound by providing better use of biomass (bio-based energy). Rice straw consists of lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose where in lignin linkage with hemicellulose and cellulose creates the impermeable barrier for the entry of enzymes during dark anaerobic fermentation process. The acidic pretreatment at high temperature of 100 °C for 30 min is known to be one of the most effective delignification methods [1]. The loose structure of fiber bundles in rice straw created by the acidic pretreatment would lead to a higher conversion of cellulose and xylan into bio-hydrogen [2,3] because enzyme could easily penetrate into the rice straw structure for hydrolysis [4,5]. Cui et al. [6,7], found that the content of total reducing sugar (TRS) was 3.12% in raw beer lees. After HCl (4%) pretreatment, the TRS significantly increased, up to 37.39% and a high H2 production rate was achieved. The initial pH is one of the most important parameters that influence H2 production from waste materials [8–13]. Ferchichi et al. [14], investigated the effect of initial pH, between 5 and 10, on fermentative H2 production from organic wastes. They found that; H2 production rate and H2 yield (HY) were substantially increased at pH 6 and then steadily decreased as the pH increased. Nevertheless; sugar consumption was unaffected between pH 5 and 9 and remained at 97%. The maximum H2 production rate and H2 potential at an optimal pH of 6 were 47.07 ml/h and 1432 ml respectively. Retention time (RT) is one of the important control parameters affecting continuous production of H2, since its control can avoid the H2 utilization by hydrogen-consumers, such as methanogens [15]. However, the reported optimum RT for H2, production are rather inconsistent and varies from 8 h, for sucrose [16] and 12 h, for glucose [17] to 18–24 h, for brewery wastewater [18,19]. Differences in retention time (RT) optima reported for H2 production could be attributed to the composition of the medium or waste, the fermentation conditions and the microorganism(s) used. Zhang et al. [20], found that the RT appears to be a significant hydrodynamic selection on the mixed-microbial populations. A stable microbial population could be established by washing out propionate producing bacteria as the RT is shortened from 12 to 6 h. The highest achieved H2 yields were found at an optimum RT of 14–15 h. A further reduction in the RT to 12 h, reduced H2 yields [21]. The effect of substrate concentration on the biohydrogen production rate and yield was investigated by Chen et al. [22], Van Ginkel et al. [9], Wang and Wan [23], and Fan et al. [24]. They found that an increase in the substrate concentration could enhance the H2 yield, but the excessive substrate concentration would result in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and a drop of pH value in the reactor, and subsequently, inhibited the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria. This study was conducted to assess the influence of 1. acidification process on the H2 production from rice straw via mesophillic UASR and 2. environmental factors such as pH, substrate concentration and contact time on the specific H2 production potential and the maximum production rate from pre-acidified rice straw waste."
1,Materials and methods,Batch experimental tests were carried out in a mesophilllic up-flow anaerobic staged reactor (UASR) (Fig. 1 ). Two experiments were conducted 1. assessment the influence of pre-acidification process on the H2 production from rice straw wastes 2. to study the effect of environmental factors such as initial pH; contact time and substrate concentration on H2 production rate and hydrogen potential from pre-acidified rice straw.
2,Up-flow anaerobic staged reactor (UASR),2.1 Up-flow anaerobic staged reactor (UASR) A mesophillic up-flow anaerobic staged reactor (UASR) was designed and manufactured from poly-acrylate as shown in Fig. 1. The dimensions of the reactor are 0.2×0.2 × 2 m with a pyramid-shape at the bottom. The total volume of the reactor is 80 l. The reactor consists of seven compartments and ends with a settler. The opening between each gas–solid separator and reactor wall was 0.012 m. The liquid gas interface of each compartment is controlled by a central water seal. The reactor was fed with either untreated rice straw wastes or acidified rice straw using a peristaltic pump. The rice straw was obtained from met fares village during harvesting season (October) and ground by a local vegetation disintegrator to pass 0.6 mm mesh screen. The grinding wastes were employed as substrate for H2 production in the batch experiments. The seed sludge for H2 production experiments was collected from a local anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) for H2 production from municipal food waste (MFW). 50 l of the anaerobic H2 producing bacteria was inoculated to the reactor. The volatile solids (VS) and pH for the inoculated sludge was 38 g/l and 5.8 respectively.
3,Strategy of UASR operation,"2.2 Strategy of UASR operation Prior starting the experiments, the UASR was continuously fed with pretreated rice straw for a year. The feeding was then stop and the supernatant was withdrawn leaving H2 producing bacteria in the reactor. Afterwards; the UASR was fed at t = 0 with 40 l of either raw or pre-acidified rice straw. The feed was continuously recycled (closed cycle) for 30 h, as shown in Fig. 1. The pH of the feed was controlled and adjusted using 10% conc. NaOH. H2 production was measured at t = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 h. The experiments were repeated three times. 2.2.1 1st batch experiments for studying the effect of acidification pretreatment of rice straw waste on H2 production The ground rice straw was diluted with HCl at different concentrations i.e. 0; 0.36; 0.72; 1.08; 1.44; 2.16 and 2.88%. The mixture was boiled (100 °C) in a stainless steel tank with a capacity of 100 l for 30 min and neutralized to pH 6.3 with dilute NaOH (10%). Contact time (30 h); and substrate concentration of 50 g COD/l was kept constant throughout the whole experimental period. 2.2.2 2nd batch experiments to study the influence of pH; contact time and substrate concentration on H2 production from pre-acidified rice straw wastes at optimum HCL concentration of 0.72% (mol%) 2.2.2.1 Effect of contact time Five experiments were carried out, to assess the effect of contact time on the H2 production rate as follows; (1) 0; 2; 4; 6; 8 h (2) 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 20 h (3) 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 20; 22; 24 h (4) 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 20; 22; 24; 26 h (5) 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 20; 22; 24; 26; 28 and 30 h. Substrate concentration of 50 gCOD/l; and pH value of 6.3 were kept constant. 2.2.2.2 Effect of pH values The control of pH is crucial to the H2 production, in dark anaerobic fermentation process, due to the effects of pH on the hydrogenase activity and on the metabolism pathways. In the present experiments, the effect of the pH on H2 production was investigated by varying the pH between 5.6 and 9.5. H2 gas was measured over the range of pH (5.6; 6.3; 6.7; 7.3; 8 and 9.5) studied. The pH of the feed was controlled and adjusted using 10% conc. NaOH. H2 production was measured at constant contact time with 30 h and for a substrate concentration of 50 g COD/l. 2.2.2.3 Effect of substrate concentration At different substrate concentrations of 5; 10; 20; 30; 40 and 50 g COD/l; H2 production rate (R m) and H2 potential (P) was calculated at constant parameters (contact time = 30 h and pH = 6.3)."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis The modified Gompertz equation was applied to determine the H2 production potential (H), and maximum hydrogen production rate (R m). In this study, cumulative H2 production curves with respect to time were obtained first from the H2 production experiments. In these experiments; the UASR reactor had been continuously operated for six month prior starting the batch experiments. Therefore; lag phase period was neglected (λ = 0) in equation (1). (1) H ( t ) = H exp 〈 − exp [ R · e H ( λ − t ) + 1 ] 〉 Accordingly; Eq. (1) can be modified as follows; (2) H ( t ) = H exp 〈 − exp [ R · e H ( t ) + 1 ] 〉 where H (t) is cumulative H2 production (ml) at time t; H is H2 production potential (ml); R is H2 production rate (ml/h); and e is exp. (1), i.e. 2.71828."
5,Analytical techniques,"2.4 Analytical techniques Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and sludge analysis were measured according to APHA [25]. The carbohydrate concentration was measured according to the phenol–sulfuric acid method, using glucose as the standard. The volumes of biogas were measured by a water locks and wet gas meters (Model LML-1, Changchun Filter Co., LTD.). The biogas constituents (H2, CO2 and CH4) were analyzed by a gas chromatogram (GC, Agilent 4890D) with a thermal conductivity detector(TCD) and a 2 m stainless column packed with Porapak TDS201 (60/80 mesh)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,1st batch experimental results concerning the effect of acidification pretreatment of rice straw on H2 production rate and H2 yield,"3.1 1st batch experimental results concerning the effect of acidification pretreatment of rice straw on H2 production rate and H2 yield Table 1 and Fig. 2 depict the effects of the changes in the HCl concentrations on H2 production rate (R m); hydrogen potential (P) and H2 yield (HY) from rice straw. The results showed a good correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.8–0.998) between HCL concentrations and H2 production (HP), indicating that the pre-acidification process is playing a big role for H2 production from rice straw wastes. As can be seen from Table 1, the H2 production rate (R m) increased with the increase of HCl concentration in the range of 0.36–0.72%, and then significantly dropped with increasing HCl concentration up to 2.88%. Maximum H2 production rate (R m) of 136.4 ml H2/h was obtained at 0.72% HCl concentration for the substrate of acidification pretreatment. The results showed that direct conversion of untreated rice straw into bio-hydrogen gas by H2 producing bacteria was low because of its complex polymer structure [6]. H2 production rate (R m) was 4.77 ml H2/h for raw rice straw. This value is in agreement with what was found in the literature; the maximal H2 production rate (R m) of 3.16mlH2/g total volatile solids (TVS) was recorded in conversion of the raw corn stalk into biohydrogen and increased up to 149mlH2/gTVS with pre-acidification process [26]. Moreover; they found that pre-acidification of corn stalk wastes increased the soluble sugar content from 0.9% to 3.11%, and the cellulose and hemicellulose contents from 37.3 to 40.51% and from 10.89 to 19.41% respectively. Their results implied that the enhanced H2 yield very nearly coincided with an increase in the soluble sugar in the composition of the substrate. Also the trends observed in this study are similar to those reported by Cui et al. [6], who used raw beer lees as a substrate. The H2 volume from raw beer lees was only 3.79 ml, however, maximal H2 volumes of 62.59 ml was recorded at HCl concentrations of 2%. In another study; Cui et al. [7], found that the cumulative H2 volume from raw poplar leaves was 15.04 ml but that the cumulative H2 volumes continued to increase from 27.56 to 33.45 ml; when the HCl concentration increased from 0.5 to 4% respectively. Compared to the result reported by Sivaramakrishna et al. [27], the results obtained in this study are less acidic (0.72%). This discrepancy may be due to the difference in substrate compositions and/or the pretreatment conditions of substrate. It should be noted that, on the one hand, HCl pre-treatment of rice straw wastes can effectively promote the degradation of carbohydrate; volatile solids and COD (Fig. 2); on the other hand, a too higher HCl concentration was not favorable for H2 production at concentration over 0.72%. This may be due to the fact that high chloride concentration might heavily inhibit the growth-metabolism of the H2-producing bacteria and lead to the decrease of H2 production capacity and possibly because HCl pretreatment produced some inhibitors such as furfural [28]. The H2 content in biogas from raw rice straw was 20%. The increase in H2 content in the biogas was found after HCl pretreatment, and a maximum H2 content of 52% was achieved at an HCl concentration of 0.72%. Indeed, our results show that the pretreatment of rice straw under acidic condition was able to significantly enhance carbohydrate hydrolysis and degradation efficiency; thereby H2 production yield and specific H2 production were markedly increased as shown in Fig. 2. The maximum H2 yield (HY) of 44.64 mmol H2/gVS hydrolyzed; 17.76 mmol H2/gCOD removed (R) and 43mmol H2/g carbohydrate degraded were obtained at HCL (0.72%), the values are significantly higher as compared with that of raw rice straw wastes (Fig. 2). This is somewhat expected, as similar trends have been reported in other work [19] who found that the maximum HY of 68.1 ml H2/g TVS was observed at 126.5 h, the value was about 136- fold as compared with that of raw wheat straw wastes."
8,2nd batch experiments results studying environmental factors affecting on hydrogen production rate from pre-acidified rice straw wastes at optimum HCL concentration of 0.72%,"3.2 2nd batch experiments results studying environmental factors affecting on hydrogen production rate from pre-acidified rice straw wastes at optimum HCL concentration of 0.72% 3.2.1 Effect of contact time The results presented in Table 2 show the changes of H2 production rate (R m); H2 potential (P) vs. contact time and the average of H2 yield (HY) is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The results obtained revealed that H2 yield increased gradually from 12.16 to 44.64 mmol H2/g VS hydrolyzed with the increase of contact time from 8 to 30 h, respectively. This indicates the shift of metabolic flux might occur after transition from 8 to 30 h, where more substrate is shunted to reaction end products instead of bacterial growth or maintenance, leading to an increased of H2 yield. Likewise; Fan et al. [19], found that the H2 yield increased rapidly from 7.4 ml H2/g TVS at 16 h, to 40.8 ml H2/g TVS at 31.5 h, for anaerobic digestion of wheat straw wastes. Despite consistency in the trends observed, the maximum H2 yield seen in this work (44.64 mmol H2/gVS hydrolyzed, 17.76 mmol H2/gCOD R and 43.5mmolH2/g carbohydrate degraded) is substantially lower than that reported by Zhang et al. [26], who found that the H2 yield (HY) from cornstalk wastes with acidification pretreatment by mixed anaerobic cultures increased up to 143.81and 144.4 mlH2/gTVS at 96 and 150.5 h respectively. According to the data in Table 2, all R 2 values were more than 0.966, indicating that the fitted curves matched well with the experimental points. The cumulative H2 production curves were generated for each trial by fitting each of the replicates to the Gompertz model and the parameters of interest (R m, P) were calculated by averaging the individual results from the triplicates. The results showed that all data fit the model well (R 2 > 0.996 for all curves) (Table 2). 3.2.2 Effect of pH Fig. 4 shows carbohydrate degradation; COD removal (CODR); volatile solids conversion at different pH values. The results obtained revealed that carbohydrate conversion remained high at 43.5–43.26 mmol H2/g carbohydrate degraded between pH 6.3 and 6.7, suggesting that the ability of the H2 producing bacteria to consume carbohydrate was not altered within this pH range; conversion decreased to 9.69 mmol H2/g carbohydrate degraded at pH 9.5. The results obtained here are in agreement with the findings that increasing pH values results in a decrease in H2 yield [11–13,29] i.e. low biodegradation of carbohydrate was observed at pH’s higher than 6.7 and lower than 6.3 suggested a switch in the metabolism of carbohydrates. This mainly can be due to C. saccharoper butylacetonicum produces alcohols and acids from carbohydrates during anaerobic digestion process [30]. The formation of alcoholic metabolites will destroy the cells ability to maintain internal pH [26]. Moreover; it might have resulted in lowering of intracellular level of ATP, there by inhibiting substrate uptake. Complete inhibition in H2 production was reported in the pH range of 4–5 [14]. Initial pH values of 5–7 were used in H2 fermentation by microflora, which are believed to be suitable against methanogens in various fermentation systems [8]. A similar trend was observed between the pH and the CODconversion and VS hydrolyzed (Fig. 4). The respective highest H2 yield of 17.76 mmol H2/gCOD R and 44.64 m mol H2/g VS hydrolyzed were both obtained at pH 6.3–6.7, which suggested that maximum H2 production was located in the region of this pH. The highest H2 production rate of 136.6 ml/h obtained in this study (Table 3 ) was lower than 149.69 mlH2/gTVS for corn stalks wastes at pH 7 [26], 745 ml/h for pineapple waste at pH 7.5 [31] but higher than 8.61 mmol/g cellulose and 24.1 ml H2/g TVS from acid pretreated wheat straw at pH 7 [32]. This high difference between the results reported here and other studies was mainly due to the mass transfer between H2 producing bacteria and substrate at pH 6.3–6.7. The kinetic effect of the pH on the H2 potential, P (ml), and the maximum H2 production rate, R m (ml/h), was determined using a modified Gompertz bacterial growth model (Eq. (2)) [32]. This model was used to fit the cumulative H2 production data obtained from batch experiments as shown in Table 3. The results revealed that H2 production occurred within the pH range investigated but the volume produced was pH dependent. H2 production peaked at 3900 ml at pH 6.3 and steadily decreased to 760 ml at pH 9.5. A similar trend was observed between the pH and H2 potential, P (ml), and the maximum H2 production rate, R m (ml/h). The hydrogen potential (7018.6 ml) and the maximum hydrogen production rate (136.64 ml/h) peaked at pH 6.3, and then decreased with increasing pH between 6.7 and 9.5 (Table 3). Contrary to the results obtained with a 66 h, time lag by Cheng et al. [33], for anaerobic fermentation, we found a negligible time lag, which may be attributable to the fact that the inoculums was directly derived from the H2 producing reactor. Moreover; the UASR was operated at an HRT of 1.25 d, and OLR of 21.4 g COD/l.d for twelvemonths prior starting batch experiments [34]. Based on the results of this study, pH 6.3 was identified as the optimum for H2 production from pre-acidified rice straw. This value is comparable to the optimum pH reported for similar investigations for corn stalks [26] and glucose substrate [35]. However, it differs from an optimum pH of 7–8.5 obtained for glucose medium [14]. This mainly can be due to the different organism species of H2 producing bacteria. 3.2.3 Effect of substrate concentrations Table 4 depicts the H2 production and yield from pre-acidified rice straw in an UASR at different initial substrate concentrations in terms of COD. The results obtained revealed that when the substrate concentration increased from 5 to 30 g COD/l, the amount of H2 produced was significantly increased. However, when a substrate concentration of 50 g COD/l was used, the increase in H2 volume was not proportional to the increase in the amount of substrate added. The maximum H2 production rate peaked at 30 g COD/l and slightly increased when substrate concentration was increased up to 50 g COD/l. This trend is thought to be due to substrate inhibition, since similar behavior was also observed by Chen et al. [22]. The H2 production appeared to be kinetically favorable at 30 g COD/l, giving a maximum H2 production rate of 141 ml/h. However; this H2 value is relatively low as compared to H2 production from sugarcane bagasse [36]. Van Gingle [9] found that under high substrate concentrations (e.g., 40 and 50 g COD/l), some facultative anaerobic H2 producers (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae) may become active. Klebsiella sp. strains are known to produce 2, 3 butanediol as a major metabolite which inhibits H2 producing bacteria. Moreover; formation of alcohols would consume more free electrons from NADH, and is thereby unfavorable for H2 production [37]. Conversely, at low substrate concentrations bacteria are thought to utilize the carbon source mainly for biomass growth and not biogas production. Therefore, from the foregoing discussion, 30 g COD/l seems to be the most suitable substrate concentration for fermentative H2 production from pre-acidified rice straw in an UASR. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Zhang et al. [26], who found that the H2 yield decreased slightly from 1.19 to 1.10 mol-H2 /mol-glucose as influent glucose concentration increased from 10 to 30 g/l, with an average of 1.16 ± 0.05 mol-H2 /mol-glucose. Moreover; the trends observed in this study are similar to those reported by Fan et al. [19], who found that the cumulative H2 yield increased from 13.8 to 52.7 ml H2/g TVS, when the concentration of the acid pretreated wheat straw rose from 5 to 30 g/l. A further increase in the substrate concentration up to 35 g COD/l; leads to a slight decrease of the cumulative H2 yield of 44.1 ml H2/g TVS. Fig. 5 shows that there was a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.999) between the H2 potential and the maximum H2 production rate at different substrate concentration. Overall, the magnitudes of the regression coefficients, R 2 = 0.988–0.996, indicated a strong correlation between the experimental and the modeled data as shown in Table 3."
9,Conclusions,"The results obtained revealed that the acid pretreatment plays a key role for enhancement of bio-hydrogen production from rice straw wastes via mesophillic UASR inoculated with H2 producing bacteria. Maximum R m of 136.64 mlH2/h was achieved for pre-acidified rice straw waste (0.72%), which was approximately 28.64-fold greater than that in raw rice straw. In addition, the bio-degradation efficiency of the COD and carbohydrate were strongly dependence the pre-acidification process. Based on these results; the pre-acidified rice straw was used for subsequent experiments concerning the environmental factors affecting on H2 production such as pH; contact time and substrate concentration. Contact time was changed from 8 to 30 h, pH from 5.6 to 9.5; and substrate concentration from 5 to 50 g COD/l. The results showed that H2 was produced over the range of pH studied (5.6–9.5). However; the H2 yield (HY) peaked at pH 6.3–6.7 and then steadily decreased as the pH increased. Similarly; H2 yield was increased gradually from 12.16 to 44.64 mmol H2/g VS hydrolyzed with the increase of contact time from 8 to 30 h, respectively. Increasing substrate concentration gives rise to increasing conversion efficiency. In the range studied, the highest H2 yield (HY) of 17.76 mmol/gCOD R and 43.5 mmol/g carbohydrate degraded were observed at a substrate concentration of 30 gCOD/l which corresponds to 1.02 l H2/gVS hydrolyzed. The maximum H2 production rate of 140.66 ml H2/h, was obtained by a modified Gompertz equation. The hydrogen content in the biogas was 52.0% and there was no significant methane observed in this study. Trends indicate that both high- and low-end pH is unfavorable and substrate concentration of 30 gCOD/l and contact time of 30 h is recommended for H2 production from pre-acidified rice straw."
