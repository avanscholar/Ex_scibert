0,Introduction,"Glycerol (C3H8O3) is an alcohol obtained as a residue from biodiesel production via the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils and animal fats [1]. One way of adding value to this by-product is through glycerochemistry. Examples of existing catalytic chemical routes are dehydration of glycerol, oxidation, hydrogenolysis, etherification, acetylation, halogenation, and steam reforming of glycerol [2–5]. Some studies have investigated ways of converting glycerol into products such as acetol [6], formaldehyde [6], fuel additives [7], acrolein [8], alkyl-aromatics [9], olefins [10–14], and hydrogen [3,15–19]. The hydrogen production from glycerol has been proposed as a viable option with the great advantage of being a carbon neutral process with less impact on global climate [20]. In this process, with a catalytic reaction based on equation (1), for each 1 mol of glycerol, 7 mol of H2 are produced, thus making it very attractive [21–23]. (1) C3H8O3 + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2 (ΔH° = 128 kJ) This reaction is obtained as a result of the decomposition reaction or pyrolysis of glycerol (Eq. (2)) and the water gas shift reaction (Eq. (3)) [21–23]: (2) C3H8O3 → 3CO + 4H2 (ΔH° = 251 kJ) (3) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 (ΔH° = −41 kJ) The glycerol steam reforming may be accompanied by a series of secondary reactions, for example, methanation (Eq. (4) and (5)), dry reforming of methane (Eq. (6)), steam reforming of methane (7), and possible carbon-forming routes (Eq. (8) - (10)) [21–23]. (4) CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O (ΔH° = −206 kJ) (5) CO2 + 4H2 ↔ CH4 + 2H2O (ΔH° = −165 kJ) (6) CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 2H2 (ΔH° = 247 kJ) (7) 2CO ↔ CO2 + C(s) (ΔH° = −172 kJ) (8) CH4 → 2H2 + C(s) (ΔH° = 75 kJ) (9) CO + H2 → H2O + C(s) (ΔH° = −131 kJ) (10) CO2 + 2H2 → 2H2O + C(s) (ΔH° = 306 kJ) In this process, several metals have been investigated to be used as the active phase, the main ones being Ni, Pt, Co, Ru, Re, Ir and Zr [21–28]. Supported Ni catalysts have been extensively studied due to their good intrinsic activity in reforming reactions, especially when Ni is highly dispersed on the support [4,5,15–19,21,22,29–31]. It is known that the nature of the support mainly affects the stability of the active phase [32]. Due to its mechanical and physical properties, alumina is the most used catalytic support considering its mechanical stability, moderate high surface area, sintering resistance over a wide temperature range and also a high degree of metallic dispersion [21]. It has been demonstrated that supported Ni catalysts exhibit good performance in the glycerol steam reforming [16,17,22,33]. Ni containing γ-Al2O3 type catalysts can be employed in a wide variety of chemical reactions [34]. The main disadvantages of Ni-based catalysts are the deactivation by carbon formation and sintering of the metal particles. The insertion of Mg into these catalysts leads to the formation of the MgAl2O4 spinel that improves the dispersion of NiO on the support [30]. However, alumina is also known to promote carbon deposition [35]. The formation of coke deposits takes place on the acid sites of alumina. To overcome this problem, doping with basic metals as La and Mg have been used [29,36]. Menezes et al. [35] prepared Ni catalysts by wet impregnation of three different supports: alumina, niobia, and 10 wt% niobia/alumina, prepared by precipitation. The catalysts were evaluated on a glycerol steam reforming at 500 °C for 30 h. The catalyst supported on Nb2O5/Al2O3 presented the best performance, with higher gas conversion (80%) during all the reaction time and a hydrogen yield of 50%. Dieuzeide et al. [36] investigated the glycerol steam reforming, using Mg doped Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with the aim to efficiently produce hydrogen. Catalytic experiments were performed in the range 500–600 °C. Characterization results revealed that Mg brings a basic character to the catalyst and promotes Ni dispersion. The catalytic activity was mainly dependent on Ni dispersion, while the amount and morphology of coke formed during the reaction was affected by Mg loading. The size and structure of carbon filaments changed as a function of Ni particle size and Mg loading. A comparative study of the glycerol steam reforming performance for Ni/CaO–MgO–Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts is reported by Charisiou et al. [37]. It was proven that the use of CaO–MgO as alumina modifiers leads to smaller nickel crystallite size and increases the basicity and the surface amount of the Ni0 phase. Thus, it increases the conversion to gaseous products by enhancing the water gas-shift (WGS) reaction, favoring the H2 and CO2 production at the expense of CO. Regarding the results of the catalytic tests, the Ni/CaO–MgO–Al2O3 catalyst presented glycerol conversion and conversion into gaseous products values close to 90% in the temperature range 550–750 °C. This catalyst also exhibits a markedly higher production of H2 in comparison to the Ni/Al2O3 sample for the whole temperature range and with H2 selectivity values greater than 60% over the entire range and greater than 90% between 550 and 750 °C. A series of Ni nano-structured catalysts on supports of Al2O3, MgO and their mixture were prepared through the co-precipitation technique by Bastan et al. [38]. The catalytic activity of Ni/MgO and Ni/Al2O3 samples were both lower than that of the corresponding mixed oxide supports. Amongst the different prepared mixed oxide materials, the catalytic activity increased by enhancing the Al/Mg ratio. The Ni/Al2Mg1 catalyst possessed highest catalytic activity of 92% glycerol conversion and selectivity towards hydrogen production of 76%. Mixed oxides from the thermal treatment of hydrotalcites have several interesting properties, such as high thermal stability, large surface area, and high dispersion of the active phase. In a previous work, Ni–Mg–Al mixed oxides were successfully applied to the dry reforming of methane, in which the Ni/Mg ratio was demonstrated as determinant to control the carbon deposition [39]. Wang et al. [40] evaluated Ni–Mg–Al catalysts on the steam reforming of glycerol, focusing on the operating conditions such as the ratio of steam to glycerol, glycerol inlet concentration, and flow rate of the carrier gas. These materials have a high surface area and demonstrate greater thermal stability as well as lower carbon formation than that of Ni–Al mixed oxides due to the presence of Mg in their structure [41,42]. As may be noted, although studies using supported or co-precipitated Ni catalysts are found, no articles were found comparing both types of catalysts for the glycerol reforming. Furthermore, the effect of activation on the catalyst activity and for the hydrogen production by glycerol reforming has not been studied. In a previous work of our group over methane decomposition [43], it was verified a great influence of the activation conditions on the catalytic stability for the hydrogen production. In this context, the objectives of the present work were: a) Compare Ni-based catalysts prepared by impregnation and co-precipitation in the glycerol steam reforming; and, b) Evaluate the influence of reduction step on the catalyst activity and for the hydrogen production by glycerol steam reforming."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Supported catalysts Supported catalysts were prepared using a commercial support (γ-Al2O3) from Degussa (149 m2/g) and different amounts of Ni (10, 20, 30%). One sample was prepared with the partial substitution of Ni by Mg (25% Ni and 5% Mg). The impregnation of metals on the Al2O3 support was performed using the incipient wetness method [44,45] with nitrates of Ni (Ni(NO3)2 P.A. - Vetec) or Mg (Mg(NO3)2 P.A. - Vetec) as the precursor. For the sample containing Ni and Mg, the metals were co-impregnated. The samples were kept at room temperature for 2 h and then dried at 80 °C. In the sequence, they were calcined at 600 °C in an oven for 2 h under a 50 mL min−1 rate of air flow. 2.1.2 Co-precipitated catalysts The co-precipitated catalysts were prepared following a previously described procedure [39] by a continuous co-precipitation of a 1 M solution containing the nitrates of the metals: (Ni(NO3)2, Mg(NO3)2 and Al(NO3)3), using an alkaline solution of Na2CO3 (2 M), at constant temperature and pH (50 °C and 8.0 ± 0.1, respectively). The precipitated material was collected and maintained under agitation for 1 h at 50 °C and then vacuum filtered and washed with deionized water until a conductivity lower than 50 μS was reached. The material was dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 600 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a 50 mL min−1 rate of synthetic air."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements, Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR), Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and Electron Microscopy (SEM/TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to verify the structure of the prepared materials or changes due to their use in the catalytic tests. The diffractograms were obtained using a diffractometer Bruker D2 phaser with Cu-Ka radiation. The mean crystallite size was determined at 2θ = 43.3° for NiO and at 2θ = 44.5° for Ni°, using the Scherrer equation [18,39]. The specific surface area of the catalysts was obtained from nitrogen physisorption measurements. Previously, the samples were subjected to a pretreatment at 250 °C under a 30 mL min−1 flow rate of N2. The analysis was performed in a multipurpose system SAMP3 (Termolab Equipment Inc.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) under the flow of a mixture of 30% N2 in helium. The specific surface area was determined by the BET method (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller). Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) analysis was performed in order to observe the catalyst activation temperatures as well as the result of interactions between the different metals and support-metal. The analyses were obtained in the SAMP3 multipurpose system. The samples were subjected to a 30 mL min−1 flow rate of a gas mixture consisting of 5% H2 and 95% N2, for the supported catalysts, and 10% H2 and 90% N2, for the co-precipitated catalysts. The samples were heated from 100 to 900 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C.min−1. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) to check the acidity of materials was performed in the SAMP3 multipurpose system. Firstly, the samples were subjected to a pretreatment at 100 °C for 30 min with a 30 mL min−1 flow rate of helium. The adsorption of NH3 was performed at 100 °C for a period of 30 min, using a 30 mL min−1 flow rate of a mixture containing 5% (v/v) NH3 and He. Before the heating, the system was purged with He flow for 30 min. Then, the temperature was raised to 750 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C.min−1 under a 30 mL min−1 flow rate of He. The amount and type of carbon deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was determined by Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO), using a thermobalance (TA Instruments Q600). A sample of 10 mg was heated from room temperature to 800 °C under a 100 mL min−1 flow rate of synthetic air at a rate of 10 °C.min−1. The type of carbon produced also was investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (FEI Inspect F50, in a secondary electron beam), with samples coated with a thin gold film prior to the SEM, and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 T20). The samples were prepared by dispersing carbon in acetone via ultrasonication and placing a droplet onto the surface of a copper grid covered with amorphous carbon."
4,Catalytic activity,"2.3 Catalytic activity The glycerol steam reforming reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a tubular quartz microreactor, heated in a resistive electric oven. A water-glycerol solution with a concentration of 10% (wt) of glycerol was fed to the reactor through a syringe-type metering pump (KD Scientific) with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/h. The fed solution was vaporized in a heated tube prior to the inlet of the reactor. Nitrogen was fed at 100 mL/min through a mass flow controller (Sierra Instruments). The catalyst (0.15 g) was arranged in fixed bed supported by quartz wool. For the previously reduced samples, the activation was carried out at 700 °C during 1 h with a 10 mL min−1 flow rate of H2 and a 100 mL min−1 flow rate of N2. The reduction temperature of 700 °C was adopted based on the TPR profiles of the samples to reduce NiO in both catalyst types (supported and co-precipitated). The unreduced samples were heated up to the reaction temperature under nitrogen flow. The catalytic activity tests were performed in a stepwise mode in the temperature range from 500 to 650 °C, in which they were maintained for 1 h at each temperature while online analyzes by GC were performed. Four GC analyses were taken at each temperature. The results were obtained from the mean of these analyses. Condensable products were retained in an ice trap at the reactor exit and analyzed after the reaction by gas chromatography (Varian 3600cx) using a Porapak Q column maintained at 200 °C, and by Flame Ionization Detector (FID) to determine the glycerol conversion. The gaseous products of the reaction were analyzed by online gas chromatography (Varian 3600cx). These analyses were carried out at 50 °C using a Porapak Q column with nitrogen as the carrier gas and a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). The amount of H2 produced was obtained through the percentages calculated for the gaseous products using the response factors for the TCD. Selectivities for the formed products and glycerol conversion were calculated based on the following equations: (12a) % H 2 s e l e c t i v i t y = H 2 m o l e s p r o d u c e d ∑ C i m o l e s x 100 (13) % S e l e c t i v i t y o f C i = C i m o l e s p r o d u c e d ∑ C i m o l e s x 100 where species i = CO, CO2, and CH4. (14) G l y c e r o l c o n v e r s i o n = G l y c e r o l i n − G l y c e r o l o u t G l y c e r o l i n x 100 ."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization Table 1 shows the prepared catalysts with the adopted nomenclature, the BET specific surface area results, and the crystallite size of NiO phase obtained from the XRD patterns. The supported catalysts were named according to the amount of metal (wt%) and the used support (A = alumina). The co-precipitated catalysts were labeled according to the metal followed by their molar percentage. For the supported catalysts, it was observed that the impregnation with 20% of Ni content caused a decrease of the specific area due to the blocking of pores by the metallic particles and possible sintering of NiO. This result was also observed by Cheng et al. [17], where the support area went from 229 m2/g to 175 m2/g when 15 wt% Ni was impregnated. Among the coprecipitated catalysts, a slightly larger surface area is observed for the sample containing Mg. This result can be expected because the addition of Mg cations increases the thermal stability of the material, leading to an increase in the exposed surface of this catalyst [46]. Fig. 1 shows the results of the X-ray diffraction for the prepared catalysts. All the impregnated samples show the presence of peaks characteristic of γ-Al2O3 at 37.2, 45.7 and 66.8°, and NiAl2O4 at 37.0, 45.1, and 65.7° as also noted by Cheng et al. [17]. The NiO phase at 37.3, 43.3 and 62.9° is most evident with the increase of the Ni content. In addition, the crystallite size increases with increasing Ni content, which is in agreement with the specific surface decrease (Table 1). The partial substitution of Ni by Mg decreases significantly the crystallite size of 25Ni5Mg/A in comparison with 30Ni/A, indicating that Mg promotes a better dispersion of Ni on the support [36,39,47,48]. The co-precipitated samples exhibited only NiAl2O4 and NiO peaks. From Table 1, it is also observed that both co-precipitated samples presented a smaller crystallite size than that of the supported samples, indicating that even with a higher Ni amount the co-precipitation method favors the formation of small crystallites [39]. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles, whereas Fig. S1 shows the deconvolution of these curves. Supported samples show a strong interaction between the dispersed Ni species and the Al2O3 used as support, which means that higher temperatures are required to reduce the oxides phases to Ni°. For the 10Ni/A sample, only a single reduction peak is observed, centered at around 770 °C, which corresponds to the reduction of the mixed oxide NiAl2O4. As the Ni content is increased, a second reduction peak appears at a lower temperature. This second peak is more pronounced for the sample 30Ni/A and corresponds to the bulk phase of NiO. The deconvolution showed that the main peak is formed by two reduction peaks, whose positions may be related to different interactions of Ni with the support or to different Ni2+ coordinates in the spinel structure [21]. Interestingly, the partial substitution of Ni by Mg shifted the main reduction peak of 25Ni5Mg/A to a higher temperature, around 50 °C. According Dieuzeide et al. [30] these results can be related to the reduction of Ni alongside a strong interaction with MgAl2O4, which favors the dispersion of Ni°. Co-precipitated samples showed a single reduction peak with a maximum at around 650 °C, which corresponds to the reduction of NiAl2O4. The broadness of this peak was fitted by deconvolution in two overlapping peaks. The first peak can be related to the reduction of Ni2+ on inverse spinel Ni2AlO4, whereas the second peak corresponds to the reduction of normal spinel NiAl2O4. This new phase can be attributed to the excess of Ni [43,49]. For the Ni66Al33, the reduction of these phases occurs at 607 and 687 °C, respectively. The partial substitution of Ni by Mg increases the reduction temperature of both peaks by approximately 50 °C for sample Ni55Mg11Al33, indicating that Mg increases the Ni dispersion and the thermal stability of Ni [47]. It is also noted that even with the high Ni content, bulk NiO formation was not observed in the co-precipitated catalysts, indicating that all Ni is in the mixed oxide structure, unlike the 30Ni/A catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles in which a broad and asymmetric peak is observed with a maximum around 200 °C for all the samples. The increase of impregnated Ni amount increases the number of acid sites for the supported samples. However, the partial substitution of Ni by Mg in 25Ni5Mg/A decreases noticeably the acid sites density of 30Ni/A from 320 to 267 μmol/gcat (Table 2 ). Among the co-precipitated samples, the difference was higher because the Ni66Al33 catalyst showed a strong and broader peak, indicating a higher acidity than that of the Ni55Mg11Al33. The partial substitution of Ni by Mg, which resulted in the Ni55Mg11Al33 catalyst, leads to a significant decrease in the acidity of the material for the co-precipitated catalysts, as it was also observed by Casenave et al. [41]. For a better analysis of the results, the deconvolution of the NH3-TPD profiles using the Gaussian Method was performed. The deconvolution results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S2. The results of the deconvolution show two overlapped peaks, indicating two types of sites. The first peak, centered at 220–250 °C, is attributed to weak acid sites, whereas the second peak at temperatures above 300 °C may be related to the moderate acid sites. Among the impregnated samples, it is observed that the amount of total acid sites as well as their acid strength increase as the Ni content increases. The first and second peak temperatures were 244 and 355 °C, respectively, for 10Ni/A, and then shifted to 263 and 466 °C, for 30Ni/A. However, the partial substitution of Ni by Mg, in the 25Ni5Mg/A catalyst, shifts these peaks to lower temperatures, notably for the second peak from 466 to 343 °C, thus decreasing the acidic strength of these sites. In addition, the total amount of acid sites was decreased from 320 μmol/gcat for 30Ni/A to 267 μmol/gcat for 25Ni5Mg/A, which corresponds to the same decrease of the Ni amount on the catalysts. The Ni66Al33 co-precipitated catalyst showed the highest density of total acid sites among all the samples. However, it is evident from the deconvolution that the acid strength of this catalyst is weak compared to the other samples, since desorption temperatures of both peaks were significantly lower. The partial substitution of Ni by Mg led to a strong decrease (around 60%) in the total amount of acid sites of Ni55Mg11Al33 compared with Ni66Al33 [41]. It should be noted that in the samples prepared by co-precipitation, the partial replacement of Ni with Mg had a greater effect on the decrease of the acidity than that on the impregnated samples."
7,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Fig. 4 shows the product distribution obtained for the 20Ni/A sample previously reduced with hydrogen. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of H2, CO, and CO2 with increasing reaction temperature. It is noted that the production of H2 and CO2 increases with the increase of the reaction temperature because the glycerol steam reforming (Eq. (1)) is an endothermic reaction. A small amount of CH4 appears due to the methanation reaction. Furthermore, CH4 and CO may have been formed from the hydrogenolysis reaction [50]: (12b) 2C3H8O3 + H2 → 3CH4 +3CO + 3H2O It is observed that there is a greater amount of CO in relation to methane, indicating that it has also been produced by the pyrolysis reaction of glycerol (Eq. (2)). CH4 decreases with increasing temperature, which can be related to the methane decomposition (Eq. (8)) and/or to the CH4 steam reforming (reverse of Eq. (4)). At the reactions conditions adopted in this work, all the samples led to the complete conversion of glycerol over the studied temperature range (500–650 °C). Fig. 5 presents the hydrogen selectivity for the catalysts previously reduced at 700 °C, whereas Table 3 shows the selectivity of products obtained for these catalysts. The selectivity values presented are results of the average of four GC analyses that were performed at each temperature. Fig. 5 shows that the H2 selectivity increases with the increase of the reaction temperature for all samples. This result can be related to the glycerol steam reforming (pyrolysis of glycerol combined with the water-gas shift reaction) and, to a lesser extent, to the methane steam reforming. The catalyst 10Ni/A was outstanding in the production of hydrogen at 550 °C, reaching a selectivity value of 42% and superior than 48% at 650 °C. This result may be related to the low crystallite size and the largest surface area among all the samples. From the results presented in Table 3, it is observed that the selectivity to CO decreases at higher temperatures, indicating that this product is consumed by other secondary reactions. Considering that the increase of the reaction temperature favors the formation of H2 and CO2, it is evident that CO is consumed by the water gas shift reaction to form these products. In addition, the selectivity to CH4 was lower than 1%, except for the Ni66Al33 that showed a CH4 selectivity of 6% at 500 °C. However, this selectivity decreases strongly with the temperature increase, thus evidencing the methane decomposition reaction and/or CH4 steam reforming. The glycerol steam reforming reaction was also carried out with samples without the activation with H2, i.e., using the unreduced catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the results of the hydrogen selectivity for these catalysts and Table 4 shows the selectivity of products obtained with the unreduced samples. It can be observed that the unreduced catalysts have high activity for this reaction. At a temperature of 500 °C, all the samples presented selectivity to hydrogen higher than 35%. It is also noticed that the H2 selectivity increases strongly when the reaction temperature is increased to 550 °C, reaching a selectivity of around 43%. This behavior can be ascribed to the activation of the catalyst with the reaction mixture, when the reaction temperature increases. In comparison, the H2 selectivity of the reduced catalyst was practically constant within this temperature range (Fig. 5). A maximum of almost 55% of selectivity for H2 was obtained for the 20Ni/A sample at a temperature of 650 °C. These results exceed those obtained with the previously reduced samples. In addition, a comparison of the samples with the same composition shows that the unreduced samples showed higher hydrogen selectivity than that of the reduced samples. This good performance of the samples without previous reduction demonstrates that these materials are already active for this reaction even though they are in the oxide phase, and, during the reaction, the reduction is occurring with the hydrogen being formed. These results indicate that the catalyst reduction step is unnecessary for glycerol reforming. The results of hydrogen selectivity for the unreduced 20Ni/A sample are similar to the obtained by Sanches et al. [16] and Menezes et al. [35]. The obtained gaseous products distribution is similar to that found by Veiga et al. [51] with Ni–La–Ti catalysts, where the concentration pattern was H2 > CO2 > CO > CH4. Suffredini et al. [52] found the same gaseous products distribution with NiAl2O4-based catalysts."
8,Catalysts characterization after the reaction,"3.3 Catalysts characterization after the reaction Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffractograms for the samples after the reactions. Fig. 7 (a) shows the results for the previously reduced samples, whereas Fig. 7 (b) shows the results for the unreduced catalysts. Table 5 shows the comparison of the crystallite sizes for samples before and after reaction. Fig. 7 shows the main peaks related to Ni° (44.5 and 51.9°). For impregnated samples, the intensity of these peaks increases with increasing Ni content. However, both co-precipitated samples exhibited intense reflections related to Ni° due to the high Ni content in these samples. The crystallite size determined from the XRD results was compiled in Table 5. In some cases, where other crystalline phases overlapped, it was necessary to perform a deconvolution to separate the Ni0 peak from other overlapping peaks, in order to calculate the size of the Ni0 crystallites. It can be noticed that the crystallite size increases as the Ni content increases in the impregnated samples, which is in agreement with the respective XRD pattern (Fig. 7(a)). Interestingly, the 25Ni5Mg/A shows a smaller crystallite size than that of the 30Ni/A, revealing a higher thermal resistance with the partial substitution of Ni by Mg. A similar effect is observed in the samples prepared by co-precipitation, Ni66Al33 and Ni55Mg11Al33, respectively. These results show that Mg stabilizes the Ni particles, despite the method of preparation. Previous works have shown this same behavior, for supported [36,47] or co-precipitated catalysts [39,53]. On the other hand, the co-precipitated catalysts showed to have a higher thermal stability than that of the impregnated samples, since after the reaction they presented smaller crystallites, indicating lower sintering. Among the impregnated samples, only the sample 10Ni/A showed resistance to sintering, since it presented a smaller crystallite size. The crystallite size after the reaction for the unreduced samples in Fig. 7 (b) and Table 5 points the same behavior observed for previously reduced samples. That is, the crystallite increases with the Ni amount for impregnated samples, co-precipitated catalysts have a smaller crystal size than that of those supported, and the partial substitution of Ni by Mg improves the sintering resistance for both types of catalysts. However, comparing the catalysts activation method, it is observed that the unreduced catalysts had smaller crystallite size than that of the previously reduced catalysts (Table 5), demonstrating that the previously reduced samples were more susceptible to sintering or perhaps the sintering occurred during the activation process with H2. Moreover, the crystallite size can be influenced by the H2 selectivity. Unreduced samples before reaction showed a smaller crystallite size and a higher H2 selectivity. Zamzuri et al. [54] also observed that smaller crystallite size was one of the causes of the produced higher hydrogen selectivity. The influence of Mg on the thermal stability for both supported and co-precipitated catalysts was noticeable by comparing Fig. 7 (a) with Fig. 7 (b). The peaks related to Ni° and the values in Table 5 points that the samples submitted to the reduction step presented larger crystallite sizes, indicating sintering of the catalyst due to the high temperature used in this step. Table 6 , together with Fig. 8 , shows the results of the TPO analysis after the reactions for the previously reduced samples. The weight losses for impregnated samples were approximately similar and indicate a similar amount of carbon formed. An exception occurs with the 25Ni5Mg/A catalyst, which showed the lowest weight loss among the impregnated samples. These results can be explained by the lower total amount of acid sites and by the lower acidic strength of 25Ni5Mg/A compared to the 30Ni/A sample observed in the TPD-NH3 analysis (Table 2). The type of carbon or formed coke can be identified from the oxidation peaks of Table 6. The 25Ni5Mg/A sample showed two peaks at 420 and 580 °C, whereas the other samples containing only Ni showed three peaks between 450 and 670 °C. The sample with the highest Ni content (30Ni/A) shows a fourth peak around 300 °C, which can be attributed to amorphous carbon. The peak at around 670 °C can be ascribed to graphitic carbon, whereas the other peaks at lower temperatures may be related to less hard carbon. This effect of Mg was similar to that observed by Kousi et al. [55] through La2O3 addition on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The weight loss for the co-precipitated samples was very different. The Ni66Al33 sample shows weight loss mainly at low temperatures, around 300 °C, whereas the Ni55Mg11Al33 sample showed weight loss at high temperatures, around 700 °C, indicating different types of the produced carbon. The data in Table 6 shows three oxidation peaks for the two co-precipitated samples. Ni66Al33 has the main peak at 310 °C, which is attributed to amorphous carbon, and the other two peaks at temperatures above 500 °C that is related to harder carbon. The Ni55Mg11Al33 sample has two main oxidation peaks at temperatures between 650 and 680 °C, which correspond to the oxidation of graphitic carbon and/or carbon nanofibers. These differences are related to the acidic properties and to the size of Ni0 crystallites. The Ni66Al33 sample shows a high amount of acid sites, most of them being weak acid sites that favor the formation of amorphous carbon. This result also explains the formation of amorphous carbon in the 30Ni/A sample. On the other hand, the Ni55Mg11Al33 catalyst presented lower total acidity and a smaller crystallite size (Table 5), which favors the formation of carbon filaments [43]. Table 7 , together with Fig. 9 , shows the results of the TPO analysis for the unreduced samples after the reactions. The weight loss for the impregnated samples increases with the amount of Ni, except 10Ni/A sample. However, these results cannot be related to the acidity of the samples because these differences were small. On the other hand, if one considers the crystallite size of the samples (Table 1), a clear relationship between the amount of formed carbon and crystallite size is observed, since the samples that presented the highest carbon formation also presented the largest Ni0 crystallite size. Moreover, the partial substitution of Ni by Mg decreases strongly the carbon amount formed by the 25Ni5Mg/A sample, which is related to the decrease of the acid sites on this sample (Table 2). Among the co-precipitated samples, the carbon formation of the Ni55Mg11Al33 sample was slightly lower than that of the Ni66Al33. However, considering the temperature at which the carbon oxidizes (Table 7), there is a significant difference between the co-precipitated samples. Ni66Al33 shows a peak of oxidation at 310 °C, which can be related to amorphous carbon, and another at a higher temperature, between 630 and 675 °C, which is attributed to graphitic carbon. On the other hand, the sample containing Mg (Ni55Mg11Al33) shows a single peak of oxidation at 510 °C, which is related to carbon nanotubes [43]. Fig. 10 shows the SEM micrographs for the 10Ni/A sample previously reduced (Fig. 10 (a)) and unreduced (Fig. 10 (b)). It is observed that there was predominant formation of carbon filaments for previously reduced sample, as found in the work done by Dieuzeide et al. [47]. On the other hand, there is no appreciable formation of carbon filaments for the sample without reduction. Fig. 11 shows the SEM micrographs for the previously reduced supported catalyst. It is observed that exposure to reaction conditions results in the deposition of large amounts of carbon, which covers practically the entire catalyst surface. Still, it is observed that for higher Ni contents, 20 and 30%, amorphous carbon formation was predominated, differently from that observed for the 10Ni/A sample. In addition the samples 20Ni/A and 30Ni/A show that the catalyst sintering occurred during the reaction, corroborating the results of the average Ni metal crystallite size determined by XRD (Table 5). Figs. 12 and 13 show the TEM images for the spent coprecipitated catalysts. For the two samples tested, with and without activation step, the formation of carbon filaments is observed, as well as the presence of nanotubes and nanofibres of low purity that grew from the metallic particles [46]. For samples without reduction, platelet and fishbone type structures were observed for the carbon produced. These results are in agreement with what was observed in the TPO analysis, through the carbon oxidation temperatures. In addition, it is possible to observe the occurrence of the sintering of the metallic Ni crystallites in the darkest points of the micrographs."
9,Conclusions,"Samples prepared by impregnation show an increase of the Ni0 crystallite size with the increase of the Ni amount impregnated on alumina. The partial substitution of Ni by Mg decreases the crystallite size and improves the dispersion of Ni. Samples prepared by co-precipitation presented lower crystallite size than that of samples prepared by impregnation. The results of TPR showed the reduction of Ni with strong interaction with the support, but for the content of 30%, a fraction of Ni is found as NiO bulk. Co-precipitated samples showed a single reduction peak corresponding to the NiAl2O4 phase. The presence of Mg increases the Ni reduction temperature for both the co-precipitated and the supported catalysts. NH3-TPD of the samples showed that the acidity increases with the Ni content for both the supported and co-precipitated samples. The presence of Mg decreases considerably the acidity of these catalysts. The gaseous products obtained were H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. The selectivity for H2 increases with the increase of the reaction temperature for all the catalysts, because both reforming and pyrolysis reactions of glycerol are favored by the temperature. A maximum of almost 52% of selectivity for H2 was obtained for the 25Ni5Mg/A sample at a temperature of 650 °C. The unreduced catalysts presented higher selectivity for H2 than the previously reduced catalysts. The best selectivity of approximately 55% was obtained for the 20Ni/A sample at a temperature of 650 °C. The largest differences were observed in the amount and type of carbon produced and the size of the crystallites after the reaction. The size of the crystallites after the reaction increased with the Ni content for the supported catalysts. The presence of Mg promoted resistance to sintering, increasing the stability of both the supported and co-precipitated catalysts. The unreduced catalysts presented smaller crystallite size compared to the reduced catalysts. The impact of the activation was greater on the supported catalysts. Unreduced catalysts exhibited higher carbon formation than previously reduced catalysts. The presence of Mg decreases the amount of carbon and influences the type of produced carbon. Among the co-precipitated samples, the catalyst containing Mg produces graphite carbon in the form of nanotubes whereas the catalyst without Mg mainly produces amorphous carbon. The catalyst reduction step is thus unnecessary for this reaction. In summary, Mg affects catalyst properties by decreasing the acidity and promoting a greater dispersion of Ni. As a consequence, there is a greater resistance to sintering and a decreased amount of formed carbon. Activation mainly alters the size of crystallites. Unreduced samples and samples prepared by co-precipitation presented smaller crystallite size after the reaction."
