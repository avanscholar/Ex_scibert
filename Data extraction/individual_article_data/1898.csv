0,Introduction,"Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have been steadily increasing due to the combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation, thereby causing climate change, global warming, and related environmental issues [1–8]. Current research works are mainly focused on large-scale CO2 sequestration and converting CO2 into fuels, however a validated technology is still lacking [9–10]. Also, research efforts on the capture of CO2 and its conversion into clean and renewable fuels through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic methods are presently too low [11–13]. The catalyst assisted hydrogenation process is a promising route for converting CO2 to selective production of methanol, aromatics, gasoline, olefins, and other chemicals [14]. Specifically, methanol as a fuel is used as the major hydrogen source in hydrogen fuel cells for transportation purposes [15]. Notably, catalytic approaches are particularly desirable for converting CO2 into fuels, including methanol, which provides a promising avenue for alternative energy sources as well as to mitigate the problem of CO2 emission [16]. The practical use of these processes depends on the selection of robust and economical catalytic materials that effectively convert CO2 into the desired products. Many active heterogeneous catalysts such as Cu, Ni, Mn, Co, Zn, Fe, Zr, and combinations thereof, have been reported as efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into methanol [17]. Specifically, Cu-ZnO-ZrO2, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, Co–O–SiOn, FeO–CeO2, Co4N, Cu/CeO2, and Cu/TiO2 catalysts show good activities for CO2 conversion with high activity [3,16]. However, these catalysts still suffer from capturing CO2 and limited methanol selectivity at high activity [18]. Despite recent progress, the noble catalysts of Pd, Ru, Pd-Pt, and Ru-Pd alloy nanoparticles are known to be the high performing catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into selective formation of methanol, formate, CH4 and CO by changing the reaction conditions [19]. In these cases, these catalyst nanoparticles usually suffer from deactivation caused by severe aggregation of nanoparticles under harsh hydrogenation conditions [19,20]. Consequently, inert supports, such as silica, zeolite, activated carbon, 2D ceramic nanomaterials, graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and metal oxides have been explored [3,16,21,22]. These two dimensional (2D) metal-supports prevent the severe aggregation of the metal alloy nanoparticles, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity of the desired products. A family of 2D materials, transition metal carbide (MXene, Ti3C2Tx) have recently emerged as high performing support systems for catalytic applications due to their unique properties of large specific surface areas, tunable compositions, surface hydrophilicity, higher acid-base density, and high metallic conductivity [23,24]. MXene (Mn+1XnTx) is derived from MAX (Mn+1AXn) phases by selective A layer etching. The Ti3C2Tx (where Tx denotes surface terminated functional groups of –O, –OH, and –F) based 2D MXene nanosheets are derived from the selective etching of Al-layer from Ti3AlC2 via hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching process [25,26]. Recent studies show that the hydrophilicity of MXenes prepared via HF etching is mainly due to the surface termination groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy and –F. These surface termination groups are responsible for providing the anchoring sites for the Ru, RuO2, and Pd nanoparticles [27–30]. Moreover, MXene nanosheets possessed a higher acid-base density due to its higher surface area which can potentially enhance the formation of desired products during CO2 conversion. To take full advantage of these dual functionalities, MXene has been combined with Ru-Pd alloy nanoparticles to form Ru-Pd/MXene hybrids with potentially enhanced conversion of CO2 into desired methanol production at mild reaction conditions. This investigation depicts the design and importance for the development of Ru-Pd/MXene based hybrid catalyst toward conversion of CO2 into methanol. On the other hand, CO2 capture and conversion based integrated technology is an area of immense interest [31,32]. Over the past few years, a number of recent studies have reported the capture of CO2 and the conversion of CO2 into methanol, formate, CO, and CH4. Notably, an alkali hydroxide-based system was used to capture and convert CO2 to CH3OH in the temperature range of 100–140 °C using ethylene glycol solution in the presence of a Ru-PNP catalyst [33]. It was found that the proposed hydroxide-based novel system exhibited a higher capture efficiency and is thermally stable compared to the conventional amine-based CO2 capture system. However, it is important to mention that compared to other 2D nanomaterials, the development of the CO2 conversion reaction over MXene-based catalysts is still in the initial stage, and extensive research is required to explore the performance of MXene-based 2D materials for catalytic conversion reactions [34]. On the basis of the above, the Pd-and Ru-supporting MXene, with the aid of ethylene glycol (EG), was used as a catalyst for capturing and hydrogenating CO2 into CH3OH. In the present study, incorporation of alloyed Pd50-Ru50 NPs with 2D MXene (Pd50-Ru50/MXene) based hybrid catalyst was developed for the catalytic conversion of CO2 into selective formation of methanol. The CO2 hydrogenation process involved the hydrolysis of NaBH4 (H2 facilitator) and ethylene glycol (EG) solution (capture agent). EG was chosen as the alcohol solvent due to its lhigh boiling point and non-toxic nature. Furthermore, a plausible catalytic mechanism for the conversion of CO2 into CH3OH under specified operating conditions is also presented."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%), ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O, 99.98%), acetone (CH3COCH3, 99.8%), N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.7%), palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2, 99.99%), hydrofluoric acid (ACS reagent, 48%), hydrochloric acid (ACS reagent, 37%), methanol (99%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.8%), ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH, 99.8%), ethyl laurate (99%), formic acid (98%) were received from Sigma Aldrich and were used without further purification. The multilayer MAX was purchased from the Jiangsu XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd., China. Deionized water was used for the materials synthesis as well as hydrogenation experiments."
3,Preparation of MXene nanosheets,"2.2 Preparation of MXene nanosheets HF etching is a promising process for the preparation of MXene nanosheets from Ti3AlC2 powder as described elsewhere [35–37]. In a typical synthesis, 5 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was added to 50 mL of the HF (48%) and H2O mixed solution. This mixture was stirred at 300 rpm inside a fume hood for 30 h at 35 °C. Afterward, the suspension was separated from the mixture solution via centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Initially, the obtained suspension was re-dispersed into 5% HCl and 95% 2-propanol mixed solution under sonication for 10 min at 35 °C to remove the Al impurities in the sample. Then, the sample was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for overnight."
4,Synthesis of Pd50-Ru50/MXene nanocomposites via microwave irradiation,"2.3 Synthesis of Pd50-Ru50/MXene nanocomposites via microwave irradiation Initially, 0.5 g of as-obtained MXene nanosheets were dispersed in 30 mL of deionized water via sonication to form a stable MXene colloidal solution. Then, 0.25 M of PdCl2 and 0.25 M of RuCl3·xH2O salts were added to the MXene colloidal solution under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Further, 5 mL of NaBH4 (0.1 M) reducing agent was slowly (1 mL per min) added to Pd(II)/Ru(III)-MXene suspension and vigorously stirred for 10 min. Then, the complete suspension was kept in a microwave oven at an operating power of 1100 W and 2.45 GHz for 30 s. Especially, microwave process is rapid, very simple and energy savings process for preparation of small and narrow sized metallic alloyed nanoparticles [38]. Further, the solid Pd50-Ru50/MXene precipitate was separated via centrifugation and washed with double distilled water and ethanol for five times. Finally, the obtained solid precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization SEM (JEOL JSM-7610F FEG-SEM) with EDS and HR-TEM (Titan TEM 300 kV) with SAED pattern was used to examine the morphological, compositional and structural studies of the samples. The crystallography studies of the as-obtained samples were determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab Mk2) was used to study the chemical compositions and chemical states of the nanocomposites. Inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to estimate the elemental composition of the nanocomposites. Quantachrome Autosorb 06 surface area analyzer was used to estimate the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene at 77 K using high purity N2 gas (99.99%). Prior to the surface area analysis, the Pd50-Ru50/MXene was degassed at 250 °C for 4 h. Moreover, CO2-TPD analysis of the catalysts were carried out through Autosorb-iQ-C analyzer in the temperature ranges of 50–650 °C with a uniform heating rate of 10 °C min−1."
6,Hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol,"2.5 Hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol The CO2 hydrogenation experiments were conducted in a lab-made 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave reactor equipped with gas inlet and outlet, thermocouple, and magnetic stirrer. The various catalysts such as Pd50-Ru50, MXene, and Pd50-Ru50/MXene were used to evaluate the hydrogenation effect of CO2 under the following optimized experimental conditions. In a typical CO2 hydrogenation experiment, the catalyst (20 mg), 1 M NaBH4, and solvent mixture of ethylene glycol and deionized water in a volume ratio of 18:2 mL (EG:Water) were added into the catalytic reactor. Furthermore, the reactor was sealed tightly and pressurized with the desired amount of CO2 under magnetic stirring for 5 min and followed by a rotary shake for 10 min. At this condition, the solubility of CO2 was estimated to be 193 μg L−1, as provided in the supplementary information. The catalytic reactor was then heated to 120 °C for the optimized reaction time of 12 h (as determined experimentally). After the completion of the reaction, the concentrations of CH4, CO2, and CO were monitored by a Gascard NG infrared gas sensor and the excess pressure was slowly released through the fume hood. The effects of the catalyst dosage (5–30 mg), solvent composition (EG:Water ratio of 20:0, 19:1, 18:2, 17:3, 16:4, 15:5 mL) and time duration (1–24 h) on the hydrogenation performance of the catalyst were studied over the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst. HPLC (Agilent 1200 equipped with column of Bio-Rad Aminex HPX87H) and GC-MS (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC and GC-FID) analyses were used to determine the yield of the desired products, while the concentrations of CO2, CO, and other gas products were estimated through carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) packed column which is connected to a TCD. For the recyclability test, the post-reaction Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed several times with acetone and ethanol to remove the catalyst's impurities such as coke, carbon and oxides. Then, the collected catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. Prior to the recyclability test, the dried post-reacted sample was thermally reduced at 300 °C for 2 h under an H2 pressure of 10 bar. The thermally reduced catalyst was then used up to five cycles with the same regeneration procedure before every cycle. The replenished catalyst at the end of fifth cycle was then analyzed for its morphology and chemical stability through SEM and EDS characterizations."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physico-chemical properties of the nanocatalysts,"3.1 Physico-chemical properties of the nanocatalysts 3.1.1 Microscopic characteristics The microscopic analyses were carried to obtain the alloying information of the as-prepared Pd50-Ru50 NPs and Pd50-Ru50/MXene nanocomposites (NCs). Fig. 1 a shows a typical FE-SEM micrograph of pure Pd50-Ru50, exhibiting the uniform morphology without any agglomeration effects. Besides, HR-TEM micrograph of Pd50-Ru50 NPs in Fig. 1b shows the size and shape of the particles. The individual Pd50-Ru50 particles displayed a highly homogeneous dispersion with a mean diameter of 5.2 nm. Attainment of NPs with such smaller diameter implies that the microwave process can effectively control the Pd50-Ru50 NPs' size. Especially, wet-chemical co-reduction methods, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, and polyol methods, are less evidenced for the rapid formation of alloy NPs. In the microwave process, the Pd2+ and Ru3+ ions are rapidly reduced by NaBH4 which leads to preferential metal seeding followed by the rapid nucleation growth of alloy NPs [38]. Especially, fast initial reduction under the microwave field caused the simultaneous formation of metallic Pd and Ru nucleation seeds that favored the formation of Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs by quick diffusion. The SAED pattern in Fig. 1c confirmed the formation of alloyed Pd50-Ru50 NPs as a single-phase without any additional separate phases for Ru and Pd [39]. The displayed diffraction planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) correspond to the hexagonal close pack (hcp) crystalline phase of Pd50-Ru50 and the d-spacing of (Pd-Ru111) plane was assessed to be: a = 0.1891 nm and c = 0.3103 nm [40–41]. These studies confirmed the formation of the hcp phases of Pd-Ru alloy NPs via microwave irradiation. Further, EDS analysis results in Fig. 1d displayed that the Pd50-Ru50 NPs consists of Ti, C, O, Pd, and Ru elements alone, which revealed the formation of pure Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs under microwave process. The morphology of the pristine Ti3AlC2 (MAX) exhibited a flake-like layered microstructure with the particles sizes of 3–5 µm, as shown in Fig. 1e. The HF etching method was effectively applied in the preparation of MXene nanosheets from pristine MAX. The morphology of as-obtained MXene particles displayed the expanded interlayers between the metal-carbides frameworks with 2D sheet-like morphology, as depicted in Fig. 1f. Moreover, Fig. 1g & h show the FE-SEM micrographs with different magnifications images of as-prepared Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs. The micrographs showed the formation of ultra-small Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs on the surfaces of the agglomeration-free homogeneous 2D MXene nanosheets. Further, TEM analysis displayed the uniform dispersion of the individual Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs over the surfaces of the MXene monolayers as depicted in Fig. 1i. The high resolution HR-TEM images in Fig. 1j & k depicted the homogeneity and sizes of the individual Pd50-Ru50 on the MXene nanosheets. The average particle size of the Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs was observed to be 3.2 nm based on the size distribution histogram of HR-TEM as displayed in inset Fig. 1j. This confirmed the formation of smaller diameter Pd50-Ru50 NPs over the surfaces of the MXene nanosheets under microwave process. Notably, the average size of the Pd50-Ru50 in the composite sample was smaller than in the pure Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs, which suggested that the MXene sheets can prevent the aggregation of the individual Pd50-Ru50 nuclei during the nucleation growth process at microwave process. Thus, the smaller sizes of Pd50-Ru50 in the composite can enhance the catalytic activity due to larger availability of catalytic sites on their surfaces. Fig. 1l shows the crystalline structure and phases of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs. The SAED pattern showed the diffraction peaks of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) corresponding to the hcp Pd50-Ru50 such that d-spacing of Pd-Ru111 was assessed to be: a = 0.1893 nm and c = 0.3011 nm, whereas, the peak at (0 0 2) attributed to the crystalline phase of the MXene in the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs [39]. This results depicted the formation of tiny Pd50-Ru50 NPs over the surfaces of the MXene nanosheets via microwave process. 3.1.2 Structural characteristics The crystallographic structures of the Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs, MAX powder, MXene, and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2 a. The Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs exhibited major diffraction peaks of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) at 40.8°, 46.2°, and 68.1° which corresponded to the hcp crystalline structure of the bimetallic alloy. The lattice constants of the major diffraction peak (1 1 1) in the Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs were estimated to be: a = 0.2022 nm and c = 0.3127 nm for the hcp Pd-Ru lattice using Rietveld refinement [39,40]. The XRD pattern of MAX (Ti3AlC2, JCPDS 04-012-0632) displayed two high intensity peaks at 9.5 and 39.1° representing a higher degree of crystallinity [26]. MXene nanosheets exhibited major diffraction peaks at (0 0 2), (0 0 4), (0 0 8), (1 0 1), and (1 1 0) planes that are attributed at 8.2°, 18.7°, 34.5°, 42.6°, and 60.5°, respectively [25]. Peak widening with lower 2θ value was observed for the HF etched MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets at (0 0 2) plane of 8.2°, compared to the pristine MAX powder. This showed that the HF etching technique was effective in the preparation of MXene from pristine MAX powder. The characteristic XRD pattern of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs displayed two crystalline phases, a lower crystalline phase of hcp Pd50-Ru50 and a higher crystalline phase of MXene. The diffraction peaks at 7.2°, 15.7°, 32.5°, 41.6°, and 61.5 are assigned to the (0 0 2), (0 0 4), (0 0 8), (1 0 1), and (1 1 0) planes of pure MXene, whereas the major diffraction peaks at 40.8°, 46.2°, and 68.1° corresponded to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) crystal planes of hcp Pd50-Ru50, respectively [20]. The lattice constants of the (1 1 1) plane in the composite were estimated to be: a = 0.1851 nm and b = 0.3011 nm for the hcp Pd50-Ru50. These values were lower than that of pure Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs. Additionally, the average crystallite sizes of the Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs and Pd50-Ru50 in the composite were estimated to be 5.5 and 3.2 nm, respectively using Debye- Scherrer equation. This result was consistent with the HR-TEM results (Fig. 1b and j). The smaller values of lattice cell parameters and crystalline sizes of the Pd50-Ru50 in the composite were due to the MXene which prevented the nuclei aggregation during the formation of ultra-fine Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs over the surfaces of MXene sheets. 3.1.3 Textural characteristics The BET specific surface area (SSA) and pore size distributions of the HF etched MXene sheets and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were estimated through N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms as depicted in Fig. 2b. Both samples exhibited the IUPAC type III isotherm which indicated the existence of mesopores in the as-prepared Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs and MXene nanosheets [42,43]. The Brunauer − Emmett − Teller (BET) SSAs of the HF etched MXene sheets and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were estimated as 68 and 128 m2 g−1, respectively from the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms. Notably, Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs possessed a higher SSA than the HF etched MXene nanosheets due to the incorporation of Pd50-Ru50 NPs, which prevented the re-stacking of the individual MXene nanosheets, resulting in the formation of MXene monolayers. TEM micrograph in Fig. 1i showed the formation of transparent MXene monolayers with dense dispersion of Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs, thus enhancing the specific surface area. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size of the MXene nanosheets and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were estimated to be 2–3 nm and 1–2 nm, respectively, using desorption isotherms as depicted in inset Fig. 2b. This revealed that the HF etched MXene sheets and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were dominantly composed of mesopores structure (<3 nm). A mesopores structure and larger SSA of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs indicate the availability of a larger number of active catalytic sites for the conversion of CO2 into methanol. 3.1.4 Chemical composition characteristics The chemical composition and elemental valence state of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs were studied using XPS analysis and the results for the same is presented in Fig. 3 . The survey scan of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs in Fig. 3a showed observable high intense peaks of O 2 s, Ru 3d + C 1 s, Pd 3d, Ti 2p, Ru 3p, O 1 s, and Ti 2 s, which indicate the composition of Pd, Ru and MXene in the composite. The deconvolution XPS spectra was used to estimate the chemical valance state of the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s in Fig. 3b showed the existence of four deconvoluted peaks for C-Ti-Tx, C-Ti-Tx, C=C, and C–C attributed to the binding energies of 281.6, 282.4, 283.6, and 284.7 eV, respectively. These results depicted the presence of MXene in the composite without the presence of Al. This again confirmed the effective etching of MAX powder by the HF. The deconvoluted Ru 3d in Fig. 3c shows the existence of two metallic state peaks, such as Ru03d3/2 and Ru0 3d5/2 at binding energies of 287.5 eV and 282.8 eV, respectively, with an energy gap of 4.7 eV [44]. Further, the RuO2 3d5/2 and C 1s (C–C) peaks were observed at the binding energies of 279.3 and 288.2 eV, respectively in the deconvoluted Ru 3d spectrum, which indicated the mild surface oxidation of Ru. Fig. 3d shows the deconvoluted XPS spectrum of Pd 3d which exhibited two spin–orbit split peaks of Pd0 3d3/2 and Pd0 3d5/2 at the binding energies of 341.90 and 336.49 eV, respectively, with an energy gap of 5.4 eV. The less intense deconvoluted state of oxidized Pd peaks such as Pd2+ 3d3/2 and Pd2+ 3d5/2 were located at 342.57 and 336.94 eV, respectively. The presence of Pd2+ 3d3/2 and Pd+ 3d5/2 would have arisen from the surface oxidation of Pd atoms under atmospheric exposure during the XPS analysis [45]. Fig. 3e shows the deconvoluted O 1s peak which was split into three main peaks at binding energies 531.2, 530.6, and 529.2 eV corresponding to Ti5C2(OH)x-H2Oads, C-Ti-Ox, and Ti-O (TiO2), respectively. Especially, -O and OH signals in the deconvoluted O 1 s indicated the bounded H2O on the surface of the MXene [46]. Fig. 3f shows the high resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, which possess two spin–orbit split peaks at 457.3 and 462.5 eV attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. Further, these peaks are deconvoluted into Ti bound to O (Ti-O), Ti bound to C (Ti-C), Ti2+, and Ti3+ at binding energies of 462.7, 457.1, 457.9, and 459.5 eV, respectively. Especially, Ti-C is associated with the chemical state of the MXene nanosheets (NSs) [46]. In summary, XPS analysis systematically elucidated the surface composition and chemical state of various elements present in the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs."
9,Formation mechanism of MXene and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs,"3.2 Formation mechanism of MXene and Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs As shown in Fig. 4 , MXene (Ti3C2Tix) sheets were extracted from MAX (Ti3AlC2) by removing the interlayered Al atoms via HF etching process [37]. Mostly, the Ti-C bond exhibits multiple features of metallic, ionic and covalent characters, thus enabling much stronger binding energy between Ti and C atoms than the metallic bond of Ti-Al. During the etching process, the HF directly extracted Al atoms from the weak Ti-Al bond which led to the formation of Ti3C2 [25,35]. Further, the HF, H2O, and O2 molecules reacted with Ti3C2 which led to the formation of Ti3C2Tix (x = O, F and OH). The complete etching process are expressed as follows: T i 3 A l C 2 + 3 H F → T i 3 C 2 + A l F 3 + 3 / 2 H 2 (2) T i 3 C 2 + 2 H 2 O → T i 3 C 2 OH 2 + H 2 T i 3 C 2 + 2 H F → T i 3 C 2 F 2 + H 2 (4) T i 3 C 2 + O 2 → T i 3 C 2 O 2 Notably, the XPS analysis in Fig. 3e confirmed the formation of Ti5C2(OH)x-H2Oads during the HF etching, which provided the necessary anchoring sites for the Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs. The formation of Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs over the surfaces of 2D MXene is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. The equimolar concentrations of RuCl3 and PdCl2 (1:1) released the Pd2+ and Ru3+ ions, which were electrostatically attached on the surfaces of MXene nanosheets. Further, the Pd2+/Ru3+ ions were reduced into metallic Pd0-Ru0 nuclei using NaBH4 as the reducing agent under microwave process. Afterwards, Pd0-Ru0 nuclei underwent a second stage of growth on the MXene, resulting in the formation of Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs on the surfaces of MXene nanosheets. Importantly, Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs prevented the re-stacking effect of the individual MXene nanosheets that resulted in higher specific surface area and acid-base density, while MXene nanosheets provided the effective platform for the agglomeration free Pd50-Ru50 NPs dispersion, thus enhancing the availability of catalytic active sites. Therefore, the as-prepared Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs could be regarded as an active hybrid nanocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into methanol towards climate change control."
10,Hydrogenation of CO2,"3.3 Hydrogenation of CO2 Hydrogenation of CO2 into various chemical products offers an effective approach for sustainable liquid fuel production and control of the climate change caused by the CO2 emissions in the energy and environmental sectors. Recently, the development of an alkali hydroxide-based process for CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over MXene-based catalyst system has been spearheaded by us as well as others [33,47,48]. Interestingly, EG is used as the solvent for CO2 capture and NaBH4 produces the in-situ H2 within the reactor in the efficient conversion of CO2 into methanol over the as-prepared catalyst as schematically depicted in Fig. 5 . For this catalytic study, a 100 mL lab-made stainless-steel autoclave with gas inlet and outlet was designed as the hydrogenation reactor for the CO2 conversion. To evaluate the catalytic activity of the MXene, Pd50-Ru50, and Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalysts, the CO2 conversion efficiency and methanol yield are displayed in Fig. 5a. The catalytic performance was tested for the MXene, Pd50-Ru50, and Pd50-Ru50/ MXene catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol at 120 °C for 12 h in EG:Water as the solvent (ratio = 18:2 mL) and 1 mol NaBH4 as the hydrogen donor for this reaction. The exfoliated MXene NSs catalyst exhibited a noticeable conversion efficiency of CO2 (28%) and the main products yields of CH3OH (23%), CH4 and CO (4%), and formic acid (2%) [48]. The observed conversion ability of the MXene NSs catalyst can be attributed to the high-density acid-base sites available on the catalytic surface and the higher surface area of the 2D MXene NSs. The CO2-TPD profile in Fig. S1 displays two significant TCD signals including 100–195 °C can be associated to the physical adsorption peaks of CO2 and a signal attributed at 530–590 °C can be related to the strong basic sites of the catalyst. Hence, the Pd50-Ru50 catalyst displays a CH3OH yield of 52%, CH4 and CO yield of 3%, and formic acid yield of 2% for the total CO2 conversion of 57% at the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst exhibits the highest CH3OH yield of 76% at the highest CO2 conversion of 77% along with a negligible (0.5%) yield of CH4 and CO and of formic acid. These results demonstrate that the combination of MXene NSs and Pd50-Ru50 catalyst is effective for the conversion of CO2 into selective synthesis of CH3OH under mild reaction conditions. In particular, the in-situ generation of H2 by NaBH4 in the reactor plays a key role in the hydrogenation process [49]. Moreover, the selectivities of the MXene, Pd50-Ru50, and Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalysts were estimated as 88%, 87% and 99%, respectively, and the total turnover number (TON) values of the these catalysts were determined as 120, 1810 and 2932, respectively. It is clear that well-dispersed Pd50-Ru50 NPs on MXene NSs possess a higher TON number due to the remarkable density of basic sites, thus enhancing the hydrogenation of CO2. Based on the catalytic activities over the Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst, the effects of the catalyst dosage, solvent composition and the time of the reaction on the conversion of CO2 into CH3OH and other byproducts were investigated. Fig. 5b shows the catalyst dosage effect versus CO2 conversion efficiency and product yields at 120 °C for 12 h in 1 M of NaBH4 and EG:Water ratio of 18:2 with CO2 pressure of 10 bar. At 5 mg of catalyst dosage, 31% CO2 conversion with 27% CH3OH yield, 1.5% CH4 and CO yield, and 2.5% formic acid yield are achieved. Further, CH3OH yield increased up to 77% along with a smaller (0.5%) yield of CH4, CO, and formic acid, while the conversion efficiency of CO2 approached 78% at 20 mg catalytic dosage. Nonetheless, with a further increase of catalyst dosage from 25 to 30 mg, the CH3OH yield decreased from 74% to 65%, while the yield of CH4 and CO increased from 3% to 8% with a negligible amount of formic acid. These findings led to the conclusion that the selective formation of CH3OH and higher CO2 conversion efficiency can be attributed to the optimal catalyst dosage of 20 mg. Furthermore, reaction medium also plays a significant role in the capture of CO2 under basic conditions. In this hydrogenation reaction, CO2 was actively captured by ethylene glycol and water based mixed solvents while NaBH4 generates hydrogen in-situ for the effective and selective conversion of CO2 into CH3OH over the Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst. Specifically, Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst dispersed mixed solvent (EG:Water ratio of 18:2) displayed a higher efficient of CO2 capture than pure EG and MXene based catalyst as presented in Table S1. Further experiments were conducted for the investigation of the solvent effect on the selective hydrogenation of CO2 into CH3OH along with byproducts under the optimal reaction conditions. Various solvents with the concentrations of ethylene glycol to water (EG:Water) ratios of 20:0, 19:1, 18:2, 17:3, 16:4, and 15:5 mL were used as the reaction media for the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH3OH [49]. Fig. 5c shows the CO2 conversion and products yields obtained using different EG:Water solvent ratios at 120 °C for 12 h over the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst. Notably, the solvents with the EG:Water ratio of 20:0 afforded 61% CH3OH yield with 67% CO2 conversion along with 3% yield of CH4 and CO, and 3% yield of formic acid. Furthermore, the CH3OH yield increased to 76% at 77% CO2 conversion for the EG:Water ratio of 18:2, and then for the EG:Water ratio of 15:5, the CH3OH yield decreased to 62% while the yields of formic acid (17%) and of CH4 and CO (4%) increased. Interestingly, the excess amount of the water molecules leads to the formation of formic acid instead of CH3OH production. On the other hand, the in-situ H2 generation from NaBH4 depends strongly on the EG:Water ratio of the solvent [49]. The specific hydrogen generation rates over the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst at room temperature were 183, 200, 230, 233, 240, and 240 mL min−1 for the EG:Water ratios of 20:0, 19:1, 18:2, 17:3, 16:4, and 15:5 mL, respectively. This gives rise to the hydroxylation of borohydride due to the water molecules, promoting the H2 generation over the catalyst. The higher specific hydrogen generation rate for the EG:Water ratio of 18:2 indicates that this solvent is a suitable catalytic medium for the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH3OH with negligible formation of the side products. These results demonstrated that the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalytic system in the solvent medium with the EG:Water ratio of 18:2 mL is more effective for the selective production of CH3OH at mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the CO2 conversion and the products distribution are displayed as a function of time in Fig. 5d. The CO2 conversion and the products yields increase with increasing reaction time (1 to 24 h) at 120 °C in the solvent with the EG:Water ratio of 18:2 and 1 mol NaBH4, as depicted in Fig. 5d. For the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at 1 h, 10% CO2 conversion with 9% CH3OH yield, 0.5% CH4 and CO yield, and 0.5% formic acid yield are achieved. Furthermore, the CO2 conversion efficiency increases to 78% with the CH3OH yield increasing to 77% when the reaction time is increased to 12 h. However, the CH3OH yield decreases to 60% at 78% CO2 conversion, while the yields of formic acid (13%) and CH4 and CO (5%) increase at the final reaction time of 24 h. The longer reaction time leads to an enhanced formation of formic acid instead of CH3OH formation. This result shows that a higher CO2 conversion efficiency with higher selective production of CH3OH were obtained at the reaction time of 12 h under mild reaction conditions over the Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst. Table S2 displays the comparison of the performance characteristics of CO2 hydrogenation into CH3OH for various reported catalysts. Importantly, the Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst showed better catalytic performance similar to that of catalysts such as Pd/In2O3/SBA-15, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, Ru-PNP, Re(1)/TiO2, Cu/Mo2C, and other catalysts analyzed in this work [33,50–53]. In addition to the promising CO2 conversion characteristics and the selective formation of CH3OH, the chemical stability and reusability of the Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst are the key factor for its long-term utilization and its possible industrial application."
11,CO2 hydrogenation mechanism,"3.4 CO2 hydrogenation mechanism To illustrate the excellent catalytic activity on the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst simply, Fig. 6 displays a graphic of the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. Two important factors – (i) composition ratio of the metallic alloyed Pd50-Ru50 NPs and (ii) availability of higher reactive sites on the 2D MXene sheets imparted an excellent catalytic activity of CO2 conversion into selective production of CH3OH for the nanocomposite. Obviously, the monometallic Pd ability is superior to H2 adsorption and decomposition than Ru and many other metals, which potentially enhance the formation of CH4 at higher reaction temperature due to the availability of high electron cloud density in the Pd shell [54,55]. Conversely, Ru is potentially involved in the selective production of formate at lower temperature, which is the key step in achieving a higher methanol yield. Therefore, the combined effects of Pd50-Ru50 NPs possessed a higher ability to dissociate H2 molecules to atomically activated H* atoms, which further spillover to the MXene surfaces at a lower temperature [56]. The diffused reactive H* atoms react with adsorbed CO2 molecules over the MXene surfaces to generate HCOO* followed by the further formation of H2COO*. The H2COO* would then react with excessive H* atoms to form H2CO* associated with water molecules over MXene surfaces resulting in methanol formation [18]."
12,Reusability studies,"3.5 Reusability studies A series of five consecutive recycle runs was investigated for the CO2 conversion and selective yield of CH3OH using both Pd50-Ru50 and Pd50-Ru50/ MXene catalysts at 120 °C using EG:Water solvent in the volume ratio of 18:2 and with 1 mol NaBH4. The results of this study are displayed in Fig. 7 . The post-reacted Pd50-Ru50 and Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalysts were recovered by centrifugation and were recycled five times. TON of CH3OH in different runs was estimated for post-reacted catalysts. Fig. 7 displays the progressive deactivation for the Pd50-Ru50 catalyst, with a decrease in TON of CH3OH from initial 2006 to 1659 through the five consecutive runs. Particularly, 8.9% leaching of Pd and 10.2% leaching of Ru were observed through ICP-OES after the five recycles, which indicated the loss of metallic catalytic sites on the Pd50-Ru50 surfaces during the hydrogenation. On the other hand, post-reacted Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst displayed no considerable loss in the catalytic activity of CO2 conversion with a consistent total TON number of 2930 after 12 h of reaction over five consecutive recycles. Elemental leaching for these nanocomposites was estimated to be 1.1% of Ru, 0.3% of Pd, and 1.7% of Ti through ICP-OES at the end of five cycles. This result demonstrates that unlike the previously reported catalysts, the as-developed Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst showed remarkable chemical stability even after prolonged use for CO2 hydrogenation. Additionally, the post-reaction catalyst was collected and washed several times with acetone and ethanol and dried at 120 °C for 6 h to investigate its structural, morphology and elemental compositions using SEM and EDS. Fig. 8 a shows the XRD pattern of the post-reaction Pd50-Ru50/MXene nanocatalyst exhibits the diffraction peaks at 7.1°, 15.6°, 32.6°, 41.5°, and 61.5° are assigned to the (0 0 2), (0 0 4), (0 0 8), (1 0 1), and (1 1 0) planes of pure MXene, while diffraction peaks at 40.7°, 46.3°, and 68.2° corresponded to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) crystal planes of hcp Pd50-Ru50, respectively [20]. Fig. 8b–d display the SEM micrographs and EDS spectra of the post-reaction Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst, respectively. The SEM image presented in Fig. 8b and c shows that the post-reacted Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst remain unchanged in structure and the agglomeration-free Pd50- Ru50 NPs dispersed individual 2D MXene sheets were observed throughout the micrograph, suggesting the long-term chemical stability of the post-reacted catalyst. The EDS spectra presented in Fig. 8f display the elemental composition of the spent Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst, indicating the presence of the Ti, N, C, Pd, and Ru elements with no impurities. Due to such excellent recyclability and chemical stability, the as-prepared Pd50- Ru50/MXene catalyst is a promising candidate catalyst for CO2 conversion that is key for sustainable liquid fuel production and control of climate change."
13,Conclusion,"A microwave synthesis method was used for the production of Pd50-Ru50/MXene at an operating power of 1100 W and 2.45 GHz for 30 s. For this synthesis, MXene nanosheets were derived from the MAX phase through selective HF etching of Al-layers. The SEM and TEM analysis results showed the uniform dispersion of Pd50-Ru50 NPs on the surfaces of individual MXene nanosheets. Further, the formation of tiny hcp Pd50-Ru50 alloy NPs with an average size of 3.2 nm on the transparent MXene nanosheets was confirmed. XPS studies established the exact chemical composition and chemical states of various elements in the as-obtained Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs. Surface analysis revealed that the Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs possessed a higher specific surface area of 120 m2g−1 with a 2–3 nm pore size distribution. In addition, a plausible formation mechanism was described for the HF etching process as well as the synthesis of Pd50-Ru50/MXene NCs by microwave process. The H2-TPR and CO2-TPD studies demonstrated that the developed Pd50-Ru50/MXene possessed higher H2 dissociation ability and a wider distribution of the moderate acid-basic sites, which favored the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol at lower reaction temperature. Furthermore, CO2 was successfully converted into CH3OH over the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst using a reactant solvent with the EG:Water ratio of 18:2 and NaBH4 that generated H2 in-situ at 120 °C for 12 h. It was found that the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst exhibited 76% yield of CH3OH with a 78% CO2 conversion under optimal reaction conditions. The recyclability and morphology of the post-reaction sample demonstrated that the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst was chemically stable even after prolonged usage. Hence, the Pd50-Ru50/MXene catalyst is a promising high-performance catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol with a possible industrial application."
