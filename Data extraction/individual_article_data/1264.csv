0,Introduction,"Although the strong effects on our societies by COVID-19 pandemic crisis, renewables have revealed a strong resilience. Indeed, according to the latest report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable capacity additions are on track for a record expansion of nearly 10% in 2021. Renewables will overtake coal to become the largest source of electricity generation worldwide in 2025, leading the global electricity sector [1]. This can be explained from simultaneous increase of both renewables and energy demand. Currently, the renewable energy share in the global final energy consumption is about 10%. In the Planned Energy Scenario proposed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the share of modern renewable energy in the final energy supply would increase to 17% by 2030 and 25% by 2050. Moreover, in the Transforming Energy Scenario, this share would increase to 28% by 2030 and 66% by 2050. Therefore, the share would need to increase six times compared to today, and two-and-a-half times compared to the Planned Energy Scenario. To achieve this, the reduction of CO 2 emissions related to energy production, needs to fall by 3.8% per year on average until 2050, to 70% below 2019 level [2]."
1,Hydrogen policies across the World,"1.1 Hydrogen policies across the World In this global energy scenario, hydrogen is experiencing an unprecedented historical moment for its future key role. In fact a great and widespread enthusiasm is growing up towards it, as indicated by the current worldwide economic and political strategies, which endorse the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the access to clean energy. The appeal of hydrogen comes from being a carbon-free fuel. This means that there are no CO 2 emission when hydrogen is burned to produce either heat or electricity or both of them. Aiming to accelerate on decarbonisation, the Industry and Academia interest towards hydrogen is growing more and more. Hydrogen could replace conventional fossil-fuels and reduce their related carbon emissions, above all in those hard to abate sectors (e.g., cement farms, iron and steel production). Moreover, hydrogen offers one solution to the seasonal storage issue associated to renewable electricity generation which peaks in summer, whereas the demand peaks in winter. Despite this technical promise, hydrogen still remains prohibitively expensive. The rapidly falling cost of electricity from renewables and the considerable amount of investments by Countries is creating excitement in research field to find new solutions to obtain low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen production. As depicted in Fig. 1 , a considerable number of countries are currently engaged in adopting hydrogen policies at different levels (R&D programs, vision documents, roadmaps and strategies). It can be clearly noticed how, in the last period (2020–2021), several countries have already mature strategy proposal; however, these differ in scope (e.g., with a focus on green hydrogen, fossil-based hydrogen, or a combination of both) and scale (from no targets to very ambitious, quantified hydrogen as well as electrolyser targets). Obviously, this is a snapshot of the current situation, which does not represent at all the end of the path and it is a result of investments (dated back to 1970s) in energy application researches, which now are culminating in more concrete policies. For example, Japan was one of the earliest supporters of hydrogen and has already translated its strategy into actual cost and efficiency targets per each application. For instance, Japan is involved in different projects for international trade in hydrogen with their first liquid hydrogen ship delivered in 2019 [3]. According to the roadmap of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan expects hydrogen technologies to become profitable by 2030. METI has set specific targets for green hydrogen in terms of electrolyser cost ( USD 475 / kW ), efficiency (70%, i.e. 4.3 kWh / Nm 3 ) and finally production cost ( USD 3.3 / kg ) by 2030 [5]. Australia aims to be one of the major player by 2030 in the global hydrogen economy following its “hydrogen under 2” main goal, i.e., reaching a production cost below AUD 2 / kg ( USD 1.4 / kg ) for hydrogen to be competitive across various applications. The national strategy was launched in 2019 with a commitment of about AUD 500 million ( USD 355 million) to support hydrogen projects. Moreover, the government has announced an investment package of AUD 70.2 billion ( USD 49.8 billion) dedicated only to hydrogen export hubs [6]. Chile has proposed a strategy exclusively dedicated to the green hydrogen and exports, having some of the best renewable sources in the world, both in solar (desert in the north) and wind (Patagonia in the south). Chile expects to achieve 25 GW of electrolysis, with the cheapest hydrogen cost in the word ( USD 1.5 / kg ) and exporting USD 2.5 billion per year of hydrogen and derivatives. Four main scopes have been identified to achieve this objectives: (i) promotion of both home and foreign markets, (ii) standards, (iii) social and local developments, (iv) and capacity building and innovation [3]. In June 2020, Morocco signed a partnership agreement with Germany that aims to develop the production of green hydrogen and to set up related research and investment projects [3]. The European Union has fixed both short and long term targets. One of these is the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, dated back to 2016, which aims at reducing the CO 2 emission by 40% with respect to the 1990’s level [7]. Another is the European Green Deal which aims to transform the EU in the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Share of hydrogen in Europe’s energy mix is projected to grow from the current 2% up to 13–14% by 2050 [8]. Moreover the Clean Hydrogen Alliance has been created with the aim to bring together industry, national and local public authorities, civil society and other stakeholders for the deployment of hydrogen technologies [9]. Member States are adopting this strategic vision and, some of them (such as France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands), have already set targets for either 2030 or 2050 and have identified the main use cases within the most relevant sectors, such as industry and transport. Among them, Germany has been a key proponent of hydrogen, having already invested around EUR 700 million between 2006 and 2016 under the National Innovation Programme in Hydrogen. Germany plans to deploy up to 5 GW of hydrogen generation capacity using water electrolysers coupled to onshore and offshore wind farms by 2030, with this rising to 10 GW in total by 2035–2040. This corresponds to 14 TWh of green hydrogen production and would require 20 TWh of renewables [3]. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands presented the government strategy on hydrogen in March 2020 [10,11]. Portugal’s strategy focuses especially on green hydrogen. Targets for 2030 include an explicit goal for electrolysers ( 2 - 2.5 GW ) and various blendings that can drive demand uptake: 10 - 15 % blending in the gas grid; 2 - 5 % green hydrogen for industry; 1 - 5 % for transport, 3 - 5 % for shipping and 1.5 - 2 % in final energy demand. This strategy foresees investments in the order of EUR 7 billion by 2030. The “Green Flamingo” project covers the export from the Port of Sines in Portugal to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The project established a size of 1 GW of electrolysis and requires an investment of EUR 57 billion (including the renewable capacity). As a final example, aware that there are many other Countries working on these aspects, Italy has presented its national hydrogen strategy, which aims at reaching 2% of hydrogen penetration in final energy demand by 2030 and foresees investments of up to EUR 10 billion between 2020 and 2030 in order to launch the low-carbon hydrogen economy and meet the aforementioned hydrogen penetration demand target [12]. Recently Snam spa and Edison spa have signed a memorandum of understanding together with Saipem spa and Alboran Hydrogen srl for the joint development of the “Apulia Green Hydrogen Valley project”. This project aims to build three photovoltaic power plants in Apulia region for a total capacity of 220 MW . It is estimated that, once fully operational, the three plants will be able to produce up to about 300 million m 3 of renewable hydrogen per year [13]. Low-carbon hydrogen production, especially the green hydrogen produced by renewable sources, is fundamental to achieve these targets because currently 96% of all hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels (either brown hydrogen by coal gasification or grey hydrogen from natural gas) and the remainder from electrolysis. Indeed, currently the large share of hydrogen is produced by means of Steam Methane Reforming (SMR). Being this technology largely employed, recent works show novelties with the purpose to increase the efficiency process. Zhang [14] proposed a review of the main novelties in the field of SMR. This technology is usually matched with a carbon capture and storage system (CSS), namely a system to separate and stock CO 2 and H 2 , which are the main products of the reforming-shift processes. Typically, CO 2 is captured by chemical absorption methods (e.g., amine-based or hot potassium carbonate solvents). A lot of work is needed on different aspects of the SMR-CCS, new materials for the reactor, new more resistant and efficient catalysts and cycle innovations [14]."
2,Towards a low-carbon hydrogen production,"1.2 Towards a low-carbon hydrogen production The aforementioned strategies will help the growth of a low-carbon hydrogen production in the next years. As depicted in Fig. 2 , a marked increase is expected for the production trend after a last 9 years period (2010–2019) characterized by a stable, constant and low level of production. The forecast, provided by IEA, takes into account mainly the two main low-carbon production paths: coupling conventional technologies (SMR) with carbon capture and utilization or storage (CCUS); and hydrogen generation by electrolysis. All the aforementioned strategies will let the market grow in all those fields where it is possible to reach climate objectives: vehicle fuelling; hydrogen injection into the gas grid; using hydrogen as a cleaner input for industrial processes; electricity storage; and synthetic fuel manufacturing. To reach these objectives, the number of projects and installed electrolyser capacity have been expanded considerably, from less than 1 MW in 2010 to more than 25 MW in 2019. Moreover, several projects have been announced to be started in the next period (2021–2025), as reported in the IEA hydrogen project database [15]. Green hydrogen production has the potential to create a virtuous cycle for renewables-based electricity grids, as hydrogen can provide much-needed flexibility to power systems, acting as a buffer to non-dispatchable renewable generation [2]. For example, Thapa et al. [17] studied the potential of green hydrogen production from hydraulic energy not exploited in Nepal. Jovan et al. [18] analysed possibilities for hydrogen cogeneration in one of the run-of-river hydropower plants in Slovenia. Regarding solar-hydrogen coupling, Ramadan [19] reviewed the main coupling systems (parabolic trough-hydrogen, solar tower-hydrogen, photovoltaic hydrogen and solar chimney-hydrogen). Qolipour et al. [20] carried out a techno-economic feasibility analysis on a hybrid photovoltaic-wind power plant to produce electricity and hydrogen. Singh et al. [21] proposed a hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) and solar photovoltaic (SPV) hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for stand-alone applications. Ayodele et al. [22] investigated the capability and viability of hydrogen production from the wind energy resources of South Africa. Tebibel [23] studied the exploitation of wind energy for clean hydrogen production for a small-scale decentralized plant by means of a multi-objective optimization of wind-hydrogen production system while satisfying multiple technical constraints based on a dynamic power and hydrogen management strategy. The EU roadmap foresees that during the first years of 2020’s (2020–2024) 6 GW of electrolysers will be installed in Europe to produce hydrogen with renewable energy, producing 1 Mt / year of green H 2 , which will replace the ones currently in use in the chemical sector, also facilitating the introduction of the hydrogen energy carrier in other industrial sectors and for the sustainable mobility. In this scenario, the creation of “Hydrogen Valleys” is foreseen to further boost the H 2 penetration. In the next five years (2025–2030), 40 GW of electrolysers and 10 Mt of green H 2 are expected to extend their application to the steel sector and heavy mobility (trucks, ships, trains). In the third phase, beyond 2030, the goal for renewable hydrogen is to reach maturity to be applied on a large scale [24]. Actually, in order to achieve this important goals, this roadmap need to be well structured on three main pillars (i.e., (i) production, (ii) storage, transport and distribution and (iii) end uses). This will allow the Countries to be ready in facing the incoming carbon neutral energy demand. Indeed, IRENA expects a considerable penetration of hydrogen in our future energy mix: about 3900 TWh of renewable hydrogen would be consumed in the industrial sector in 2050, mainly in the iron and steel industry, in chemicals and also for ammonia production. The transport sector would be the second largest user of renewable hydrogen with 1100 TWh consumed per year by 2050. In the transport sector, hydrogen can be used in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), mostly for heavier freight transport, or to produce synthetic fuels for shipping or aviation. In the buildings sector, hydrogen can be blended with natural gas or used to produce synthetic methane and injected in the gas grids, although this application is limited to around 1 EJ (277.8 TWh) [2]. Furthermore, as a proof of fervent enthusiasm and serious preparation to this new energy era, a growing group (currently composed of 23 European gas infrastructure companies) has presented a document for the construction of a unique European Hydrogen Backbone for a hydrogen distribution network. This document outlines the development strategy for the transport of this new energy carrier, which will extend for 11600 km in 2030 and 39700 km in 2040, connecting the different European hydrogen valleys [25]. In this scenario, it is important to understand what benefits could derive from the use of hydrogen. For this reason, the present work not only aims at reviewing the recent updates on hydrogen economy (in terms of the main advantages and drawbacks) but also focuses on determining the impact that this hydrogen may have in various sectors (transport, industry and power generation) in terms of renewable source exploitation and reduction of CO 2 emissions. Initially the reader is guided through a global overview with recent updates in terms of strategies, which contemplate hydrogen as the future energy carrier towards the climate-neutrality. Retracing the guidelines of the hydrogen roadmap, the work initially gives an overview on hydrogen production, mainly focusing on conventional and low-carbon technologies (Section 2); then a description of the storage as a key enabling technology is proposed in Section 3. Proposals on hydrogen distribution are analysed in Section 4. Afterwards, Section 5 continues analysing the main potential application areas where hydrogen could be used with emphasis on their actual contribution in terms of CO 2 emissions. Section 6 deals with the implications of the hydrogen use in a real Combined Cycle Power Plants focusing on the energy required to produce hydrogen and the abatement of the CO 2 production. Subsequently several aspects regarding environmental impact and safety issues are covered in Section 7. Finally, in Section 8 emerging technologies with a low TRL level are investigated in order to determine how much research is still needed to reach even higher levels in terms of energy sustainability."
3,The hydrogen palette – Hydrogen production,"Actually, hydrogen cannot be considered a novel energy carrier, since its discovery as a fuel dates back to 1783, when Antoine Lavoisier together with Laplace reproduced the Cavendish’s experiment, showing that the combustion of hydrogen generates water vapor. Indeed, this intrinsic characteristic, which is hidden in its name (from the Greek “water generator”), is the basis of the current growing public interest in this “clean fuel”, useful for the global decarbonization process. The first fundamental step to achieve this objective is the ability to produce a significant amount of clean hydrogen, i.e., the so-called green hydrogen. Actually hydrogen is not a primary energy source, but it can be produced in different ways and each identifies it with a different colour. Conventionally, hydrogen produced from renewable sources through electrolysis is called green hydrogen; when it comes from coal gasification with water vapor, it is called brown hydrogen; if produced from a generic fossil fuel (e.g., natural gas), it is called gray hydrogen; whereas, when hydrogen is produced from methane with a process of capture and storage of CO 2 (CCS - Carbon Capture and Storage), it is called blue hydrogen [26]. Hydrogen is already employed in industry, and currently around 120 Mt per year of grey hydrogen is produced and consumed, mostly in the refining industry and for the ammonia production. Moreover, dedicated hydrogen pipelines have been in operation for decades [27]. Although hydrogen production is already “at scale”, it is not yet clean. In fact, as depicted in Fig. 3 , currently 96% of all the hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels (natural gas 48 %, oil 30%, coal 18%) and the remainder 4% from electrolysis. This means that associated to the hydrogen production there are still significant CO 2 emissions. For this reason, green hydrogen will be more and more important in the transforming energy scenario, where it will have the potential to supply nearly 29 EJ ( ≃ 8000 TWh ) of the global energy demand by 2050. Two-thirds of that would come from renewable sources, requiring at minimum around 7500 TWh of renewable electricity, roughly equivalent to 30% of current global electricity generation [2]."
4,Steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS),"2.1 Steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS) Nowadays, the main hydrogen production in the world is carried out by means of the Steam Methane Reforming (SMR). Reforming basically consists in making methane and water vapor react at a temperature around 700–1100 ° C , with pressure ranging from 20 to 30 bar to produce syngas (a gas mixture consisting essentially of carbon monoxide and hydrogen): (1) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 - 206 kJ / mol The heat required to activate the reaction is generally provided by a methane combustion with further CO 2 emissions. In this process, further hydrogen can be obtained from carbon monoxide by a water shift reaction, especially in presence of a metal oxide catalyst: (2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 + 41 kJ / mol The coupling of SMR and CCS is advocated to avoid CO 2 being vented into the atmosphere. This happens through chemical absorption systems; recently physical absorption like pressure swing adsorption (PSA) has been introduced. Evaluating the CO 2 produced by the entire SMR process, only 60% results from the shift process (Eq. 2), while the remaining 40% is associated to the combustion necessary to generate the heat for the reforming process (typically methane combustion). On average, the energy required to produce 1 kg of H 2 is about 46 kWh [28,29], consuming 2 kg of methane, and producing 5.5 kg of CO 2 with a cost of about 1–2.3 USD / kg H 2 [30]. Being the most employed technology to produce hydrogen, many works can be found in the literature aiming to increase the SMR efficiency. For instance, Pashchenko proposes the application of an on-board thermochemical waste recovery system not only to produce hydrogen already available, but also to increase the global efficiency of the system [31]. In other works, Pashchenko [32,33] also proposed the use of Ni- Al 2 O 3 catalyst with different shape to increase the methane production of 1–2%. Other authors, investigated the possibility to use different metals, both noble and no-noble [34]. More promising solutions have been shown in recent years. The aim is to develop advanced technologies, which increase the efficiency and the selectivity of the process. Proposals are basically upgrades of the conventional SMR, for instance: SESRM (99% CH 4 conversion using CaO - Ca 9 Al 6 O 18 as the sorbent) [35], OSRM (100% CH 4 conversion over doped noble metal Ni - Al 2 O 3 ) [36], CLSRM (99.8% CH 4 conversion using Y-doped NiO/SBA-16 as the oxygen carrier) [37], and the newly reported thermo-photo hybrid, plasma and electrical field enhanced SRM technologies [38–40]. Finally, one of the first large-scale pilot plant to produce hydrogen retrofitted with a carbon dioxide capture and storage system has been built at Port Arthur (Texas). This has demonstrated to capture 1 million t / year of CO 2 in view of 120000 Nm 3 / day of hydrogen production [41]."
5,Electrolysis,"2.2 Electrolysis Green hydrogen is currently more expensive (2.50–6.80 USD / kg H 2 ) than conventional grey hydrogen. However, the cost of green hydrogen is falling rapidly due to the combined effects of reduced electrolyser cost and cheaper renewable energy, to the point where it can compete with blue hydrogen in the near future. The cost of renewable power generation (to produce the green hydrogen), the cost and performance of electrolysers, and the electrolyser load factor determine the green hydrogen production cost. Considering suitable locations, production costs of around 2–3 USD / kg of green hydrogen will be feasible in the coming decade. Low cost can be also achieved earlier at sites characterized by good renewable energy resources [2,3]. Among these alternatives, electrolysis (in the hypothesis of exploiting RES) is the most promising technology for the future at least until the CCS technology can be used effectively on a large scale [42]. 2.2.1 Electrolysis technologies Different types of electrolysis technologies have been developed to produce H 2 . Among them, the main technologies are based on alkaline electrolysis, polymer exchange membranes (PEM), and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). Alkaline electrolysis is the most mature and widely marketed technology, but it shows many drawbacks with respect to others, such as lower gas purity, lower operational pressures and higher energy consumption [43]. As a result of low operational pressures, additional hydrogen compression is required for downstream applications. Researchers are currently working on different aspects to improve the performance. For example, Poimenidis et al. [44] founded that hydrogen production efficiency can be increased with laser nanostructured Ni electrodes as cathodes. Amores et al. [45] studied alkaline water electrolysis for off-shore applications in order to analyze the influence of marine conditions on the performance of an electrolyzer. Jang et al. [46] and Burgos et al. [47] analyzed the influence of temperature on an alkaline water electrolysis system. Polymer exchange membranes (PEM) systems allow higher operating pressure levels than those in alkaline processes. Furthermore, the main characteristic consists in their flexibility in a wide range of operating conditions. This facilitate the coupling of these systems with RES [48]. Although they have a marginal market penetration, PEM systems are expected in upcoming years to achieve hydrogen production in the order of GW [49]. This will be achieved by facing techno-economic issues, such as the content reduction of noble materials (e.g., Ir, Pt), substitution of critical raw materials with less expensive and more workable ones [24]. Further research into catalyst and membrane materials is encouraged to enable the cost-effective, wide-spread application of this technology [50–52]. Though still operating at a lab-scale capacity (10 to 100 kW) [53], SOECs can work at temperatures higher than other electrolytic systems. This feature makes them suitable for the waste heat recovery in many industrial processes [43]. Moreover, SOECs systems can be used also in reverse mode (as a fuel cell) and show the potential to be used in co-electrolysis to produce syngas [54]. Up to date, several research activities need to be carried out in order to improve their TRL (2–3) by facing many issues related to the corrosion of materials at high temperature and poor long-term cell stability and the improvement of the thermal management in the co-electrolysis systems for syngas production [55,24]. For example, Ye et al. [56] examined high-temperature electrocatalysis and key materials in SOECs, whereas Nechache et al. [57] and Tucker [58] reviewed alternative and innovative SOEC cell materials. Khan et al. [59] investigated the degradation behaviour of different air electrodes used for solid oxide electrolysis cells. Further information regarding the main parameters of each electrolytic technology are summarized in Table 1 . Herein two useful parameters are introduced to characterize the electrolysis performance, namely the system energy demand [ kWh / kg H 2 ], i.e., the amount of energy [ kWh ] necessary to produce 1 kg H 2 , and the efficiency of the electrolytic system, η electrolysis , defined as follows: (3) η electrolysis = m ̇ H 2 LHV H 2 P in where m ̇ H 2 [ kg / s ] is the mass flow rate of hydrogen produced, LHV H 2 [ J / kg ] its lower heating value and P in [ W ] the electric power entering the system. New technologies are rising [61], demonstrating that the energy required by electrolysis with biomass derived alcohols, namely bio-ethanol in substitution of oxygen, is more efficient than that with pure water. Indeed, with this technology the energy rate decreases to 18.5 kWh / kg H 2 with respect to the average of about 64 kWh / kg H 2 . 2.2.2 Examples of applications An example of the application of the electrolysis technology combined with a wind energy production plant is the case of the Prenzlau plant (Germany) inaugurated in 2011 [62]. This plant features three wind turbines (2.3 MW each) connected directly to a 600 kW alkaline-based electrolyser capable of producing 120 Nm 3 / h of hydrogen. The hydrogen is then stored in a 42 bar tank capable of containing 1350 kg of H 2 (for instance, at 288 K and V = 380 m 3 ). In addition, there are two cogeneration units, 366 kW el and 409 kW th each, capable of burning hydrogen/biogas mixtures with maximum hydrogen concentrations of 70%. To complete the system, a plant produces up to 350 Nm 3 / h of biogas. Another example of an industrial-scale electrolysis plant is the plant built in Linz (Austria). The plant, financed by the European Union through the H2Future project, was designed for powering the electrolyser exclusively by means of RES and to study its network balancing capacity. Furthermore, this plant was built in the vicinity of a steel plant aiming at reducing the dependence on fossil fuels in the steel production. The plant has a power of 6 MW and produces 1200 Nm 3 / h of H 2 [63]. Further comments can be done if we consider the production of hydrogen through electrolysis with electricity provided by different kinds of power plants, as shown in Fig. 4 . This analysis is important, since each power plant is characterized by an inherent production of CO 2 equivalent ( CO 2 , eq ), associated to its Life Cycle in addition to their direct CO 2 production. The comparison is carried out by considering: a power plant fuelled with either coal or natural gas (e.g., Coal fired power plants and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), a nuclear plant, and a renewable power plant (which could be a wind farm, a solar photovoltaic system or a hydroelectric power plant). Each of them is supposed to supply the electrical grid with 1 kWh as energy output, but bringing along different quantities of CO 2 , eq . Indeed, the power plants fueled with either coal or natural gas are characterized by an equivalent carbon dioxide equal to 1 or 0.5 kg of CO 2 , eq , respectively [64]. On the other hand, renewables and nuclear power plants are marked by 0.040 kg of CO 2 , eq and 0.065 kg of CO 2 , eq , respectively [64]. For the electrolysis process it has been assumed an average efficiency of 0.0156 kg H 2 / kWh and 0.2 g CO 2 , eq per kWh produced. Regarding the CO 2 , eq associated to the electrolyzer, the equivalent carbon dioxide CO 2 , eq stands for CO 2 that is not directly produced by the electrolyzer during its operation, but it is related to its entire life cycle. As a result, it can be said that a sustainable impact in terms of CO 2 emissions is obtained when the energy is provided by either RES or a nuclear power plant. This is a valuable information especially when the energy cost is not profitable and variable quantities of energy need to be stored. Nowadays, when the energy produced exceed the demand (low energy demand period), the RES are preferably stopped instead of regulating a gas turbine power plant and letting it work at part-load, with a reduction of the power plant global efficiency. To avoid this, the energy can be still produced and the non-dispatched energy can be delivered to an electrolyzer and chemically stored as hydrogen. Taking a look at the scheme in Fig. 4, the right choice, with the less environmental impact, can be done."
6,Biomass gasification,"2.3 Biomass gasification Hydrogen can also be produced from biomasses through the gasification process. Indeed, the biomass gasification is a process used to convert biomass into syngas by means of oxygen and/or steam at temperature greater than 700 ° C [29,65] with an efficiency of about 46 % and an energy requirement of 72 kWh / kg H 2 [28]. Thanks to the water–gas shift reaction, carbon monoxide reacting with water forms CO 2 and H 2 . If combined with a Carbon Capture and Storage technology, hydrogen production from biomass gasification could be carbon negative. It is foreseen that the use of this kind of technology could involve a reduction of about 45 Mt CO 2 per year by 2050 [66]."
7,The hydrogen storage,"The storage of hydrogen is a key enabling factor to promote the hydrogen economy. Due to its low volumetric energy density (see Table 2 ), this is the main issue for many researches."
8,"Gaseous, liquid and cryo-gaseous hydrogen storage","3.1 Gaseous, liquid and cryo-gaseous hydrogen storage There are different ways to store hydrogen. Starting from the conventional and less complicated one, the storage in compressed vessels as a gas shows a limit since hydrogen is characterized by a high energy density on a mass basis, but not on a volumetric basis compared to conventional fuels (see Table 2). Hence, elevated pressure and large vessels are required. This is not an issue when the application contemplates large vehicles (e.g., trucks and ships) and it might be indicated as a near-term solution for short distances. Differently, for aircraft or small cars applications, this can not be the right solution. For this reason, less volumetric solutions have been investigated. Different materials have been proposed to manufacture these vessels: full metallic, glass fiber composite overwrap, full composite wrap with metal liner and fully composite. These materials can resist from 50 MPa (full metallic) to 100 MPa (fully composite) reducing the weight by 50%, but increasing considerably the costs [68]. In general, when either small amounts of hydrogen are produced or the limits of the storage systems are reached, gaseous hydrogen can be injected in the exiting NG domestic or industrial grids (pipelines) with mixtures ranging from 5 to 10 % in volume of hydrogen, considering this as a good compromise for the natural gas network (see Section 4). More elevated volumetric density based solutions have been developed, for instance, the physical-based storage of hydrogen as a liquid and the cryo-gaseous storage. On the material-based, the storage on surface of solids (adsorption) or within solids (absorption) [69]. The hydrogen stock as a liquid is possible at low temperature, namely −250 ° C , but it is very expensive (15 USD / kg ) and requires a lot of energy. Thus, this solution is suited only for large storage applications. Furthermore, the safety is guaranteed by installing a vacuum shell on the vessel. Another way is the cryo-gaseous storage. The gas is stored in its super-critical cryo state at −233 ° C . This application allows the storage of large amount of hydrogen even higher then at pure liquid state, with a surplus of 10 g / l with respect to the liquid storage. Eventually, another promising application is the transport of hydrogen in the guise of ammonia that will be discussed in the next Section 3.2."
9,Ammonia as energy carrier,"3.2 Ammonia as energy carrier Ammonia ( NH 3 ) is proposed, by the most in particular for transportation, as a useful energy carrier as it is characterized by chemical properties, which allows an easier storage process than for the pure hydrogen. Indeed, at ambient temperature NH 3 has a vapor pressure close to 9 bar, which is close to the propane ( C 3 H 8 ) one, allowing the storage of liquid ammonia. Compared to this, hydrogen reaches the same vapor pressure at a temperature equal to 31 K (see Table 3 ) [70]. This means that a more complex apparatus is needed to store cryogenic hydrogen and at the moment this is not cost-effective. For instance, over 182 days ammonia storage would cost 0.54 USD / kg H 2 compared to 14.95 USD / kg H 2 of pure hydrogen storage [71]. Moreover, as for hydrogen, ammonia can be used directly as a fuel. Its properties as a fuel are discussed in Section 5.3. The first shipping of 40 t of blue ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan happened in 2020. For Japan, the aim was to use ammonia in power station to produce electricity without carbon emissions. Blue ammonia is so called when it is produced by a combination of nitrogen and hydrogen produced by steam methane reforming. The Saudi ARAMCO claimed to had produced ammonia by hydrocarbons, via hydrogen with a carbon dioxide capture system [72]."
10,The hydrogen distribution,"Creating an efficient transport system over long distances, storing for short or seasonal period of time, and developing a hydrogen distribution network suitable for the various types of applications, are fundamental elements of the H 2 supply chain. For applications such as large industrial processes (refineries, steel mills, paper mills, chemical industries) a massive and continuous supply of hydrogen is required. This requires the integration of clean hydrogen (produced on site) to H 2 distribution systems (in blend with natural gas, or in dedicated hydrogen pipelines) and to storage systems that allow the safe storage of large quantities capable of ensuring continuity of operations. Moreover, these high demanding industrial areas could lead to a potential aggregation of different hydrogen applications, which will bring to the creation of the so-called “hydrogen valleys”, where supply and demand can coexist, and cooperation at a local level could be the basis of the hydrogen economy model. Certainly, this kind of systems will require H 2 supply by means of distribution networks. As aforementioned in the introduction, there is a strong effort by the the main European management authorities of gas transport and storage networks in the strategic planning of the construction of a unique European backbone of the hydrogen distribution network [25]. The document outlines the development strategy for the transport of this new energy vector, which in 2030 will extend for 11600 km connecting the European hydrogen valleys. This network is set to expand in 2040 to reach a total length of at least 40000 km , with a total investment estimated between 43 and 81 billion €. In particular, these investments should cover the costs of converting part of the existing gas networks to hydrogen pipelines (for 75 % of the total extension of the European Hydrogen Backbone - EHB) and the costs of building new interconnecting hydrogen pipelines (for the remaining 25 % extension of the EHB network). The costs of transporting hydrogen, in the aforementioned EHB, are expected to be between 0.11 and 0.21 €/ kg H 2 every 1000 km . In the conversion of gas pipelines to hydrogen pipelines, at the same nominal operating pressure of 85 bar , it is planned to use existing pipeline diameters of 122 cm with an equivalent transported power in hydrogen of 13 GW and a diameter of 92 cm for a transported power of 7 GW [25]. Considering that hydrogen is currently used, it is estimated that about 4500 km of hydrogen pipelines are installed worldwide with diameters of 25 - 30 cm and operating in a pressure range of 10 - 20 bar . Moreover, some of them, have been in operation for over 60 years [73,27]. However, as highlighted by Hu et al. [74] and Edwards et al. [27], hydrogen pipelines construction is more expensive than natural gas ones. Indeed, an average construction cost of hydrogen pipelines is about of 854 USD / m for a pipeline with a diameter of 30 cm [75,76], which is around 10 % - 20 % more expensive than natural gas pipelines [77]. This can be related to the need of greater diameters and other additional costs regarding welding procedures, leak testing and compression due to the low molecular weight of hydrogen and its associated diffusivity [78]. Nowadays the main idea to promote hydrogen penetration consists in employing the existing natural gas network by adding hydrogen. This solution, not only allows a reduction of capital costs of the infrastructure, but also can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, especially if the added hydrogen is a green hydrogen. In several projects around the world there is already an injection of hydrogen into the gas grid. The largest ( 6 MW of electrical input) has been operational in Germany since 2015, and being this a sector in continuous expansion, more projects will be launched in the early 2020s. A growing number of countries is interested in gas grid hydrogen-blending because the increasing use of variable renewable electric generation leads to periods of surplus and curtailment. Although interest was initially limited to Europe, since 2017 other countries (such as Australia, Canada and the United States) have become curious about how to make use of their robust gas grids to boost low-carbon hydrogen demand. Installations that can blend roughly 2900 tonnes of hydrogen per year into the gas grid are currently in place around the world [16]. This has involved a great effort by Academia and Industry to investigate the technical issues of H 2 / CH 4 blends regarding operation, management and safety of the networks [77,79–95]. According to these studies, a mixture ranging from 5 to 10 % in volume of hydrogen is considered a good compromise for the natural gas networks, since additional modifications are not required both for the supply infrastructure and for domestic and industrial end-users systems. Indeed, with high levels pf added H 2 , issues like ignition risks, mechanical fatigue of the pipes, leakage risks can be avoided [79,96–100]. Pinchbeck and Huizing [74] suggested different safe hydrogen addition limits into existing natural gas facilities, such as 6 % and 10 % for natural gas pipelines at 40 and 8 bar, respectively; 12 % for burners; and 18 % for in–house appliances. According to [101], when the H 2 is greater than 10 % , modifications to the measuring instruments, control stations and compressor are required. In addition, the mechanical characteristics of the piping have to be taken into account, since hydrogen transportation can involve phenomena such as include hydrogen blistering, hydrogen embrittlement, and hydrogen-induced fracture [102–106]."
11,Fields of hydrogen application,"Hydrogen will occupy a unique position to contribute to international environmental objectives, above all in those sectors where it is important to reduce the significant levels of emissions. Regarding this aspect, McWilliams et at. [107] have reported an overview on the main potential sectors for H 2 application with their current contribution to total emission in EU, as summarized in Table 4 . According to this table, it is possible to notice how the main hydrogen demand will pertain to three wide sectors: transportation, industrial applications and residential heating."
12,Transportation,"5.1 Transportation 5.1.1 Automotive In the last decade, the automotive industry has gone through a period of transformation after the so-called Dieselgate emissions scandal [108]. This scandal opened the way to the electric vehicles lead by Tesla Inc. [109]. In the recent years, the rising of plug-in hybrid and full electric cars opened another question: is the electric energy used for mobility as clean as everyone believes? The electric energy exploited by cars and its related production of CO 2 and NO x is now centralized in conventional power plants generally fuelled with fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and RES to a small extent. In this scenario, hydrogen can play an important role. First of all, hydrogen can be directly used as fuel instead of conventional fuels in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Another way is the use of hydrogen in fuel cells with the purpose to convert the chemical energy directly into electricity quickly exploitable for traction (e.g., cars, trucks, trains, maritime applications). In the last decades, many research groups investigated the combustion of hydrogen with either port-fuel-injection (PFI) or direct injection (DI) in the combustion chamber. Hydrogen is characterized by peculiar chemical-physical properties, low density (14.4 lower than air), high diffusivity (3.8 times higher than methane) and temperature inversion when it is subjected to a rapid expansion (Joule–Thomson effect). Therefore, direct-injection stands out as the most promising solution. The reasons are various: the minimum auto ignition energy of hydrogen at stochiometry is of an order of magnitude lower than the standard hydrocarbons as well as the quenching distance, and the flame speed in air is higher than standard hydrocarbons. Thus, PFI are prone to pre-ignition, which leads to knock and to backfire in the intake manifold [110]. Conversely, the high molecular diffusion and the wide flammability range of hydrogen facilitate the development of efficient combustion of hydrogen inside ICE. In this framework, DI is preferred; however, the injector cap, its location and the injection timing are critical parameters that are under investigation [111,112]. Nevertheless, further studies are needed on the wall heat losses, since the quenching distance of hydrogen is really low, and on the fresh mixture formation and stratification inside the cylinder. Both aspects can play a role in the control of the NO x emissions. Lets have a look at the energy provided by fuel cells and Li-ion batteries to a car. Fig. 5 compares in terms of supplied energy and life cycle CO 2 , eq two scenarios where a car could be supplied either by fuel cells or a Li-ion battery. The comparison is carried out by referring to 1 kWh I N , i.e, 1 kWh of energy produced by RES and available for the transportation. When considering a car with fuel cells, the energy should be firstly converted and stored as hydrogen via electrolysis, then used again to produce electric energy at the occurrence. This process considers two energy conversions (an average power-to-gas conversion in the electrolyzer 64 kWh I N / kg H 2 (from Table 1) and a gas-to-power conversion with a Fuel cell, 33 kWh OU T / kg H 2 [159]). Regarding the electrolysis, a PEM based technology has been considered for calculations with an average hydrogen production rate of about 40 Nm 3 / h and a mean life-time of 40000 hours [27]. Moreover, an average production of 40 t H 2 / m 2 over its lifetime with an emission factor of about 1.8 t CO 2 , eq / m 2 have been considered [160]. Regarding dimensions, a typical PEM cell surface of about 0.125 m 2 and 30 cells has been considered [161]. All these assumptions lead to an emission factor of about 0.2 g CO 2 , eq / kWh OU T for the electrolyzer. Regarding the Fuel Cell, the analysis has been carried out by considering an average mileage of 150000 km with a typical H 2 demand of 0.93 kg H 2 /100 km and emissions per km of 0.06 kg CO 2 , eq /km [114]. All these assumptions lead to an emission factor of about 0.195 kg CO 2 , eq / kWh OU T for the fuel cell. For Li-ion battery an average efficiency of 0.85 is considered [162,164]. Moreover, in the case of Li-ion batteries, calculations have been carried out by considering a battery with a mean capacity of 45 kWh , with an average emission factor equal to 275 kg CO 2 , eq / kWh related to its manufacturing [113]. In addition, a vehicle mileage equal to 150000 km with an energy demand of about 0.15 kWh I N /km have been considered [163]. As a result, the energy output available to the car in the case of electrolyzer and fuel cell is lower than the energy provided by a Li-ion battery (-40%). The interesting point instead regards their life-cycle CO 2 emissions. For the Li-ion batteries this quantity is roughtly 4.5 times higher than the fuel cells, namely an average of 0.1 kg CO 2 , eq vs 0.468 kg CO 2 , eq per kilowatt-hour provided by RES. A final comment can be done on the specific energy per vehicle unit weight ( kWh / kg v w ), which is 4 times lower for the Li-ion batteries, see Table 5 [115]. All these analyses suggest the positive effect that the application of hydrogen technologies could have in the automotive sector. Anyway, as will be discussed in the Section 7, the use of fuel cells requires a portable hydrogen storage system installed on the vehicles with related space and security issues [116]. 5.1.2 Trains Railway sector is another interesting sector for hydrogen, especially considering the large amount of diesel train currently employed. In the next decade, trains powered by fuel cells will become more competitive in terms of costs than the diesel ones. In some European Countries (e.g., Germany), H 2 passenger trains are fully operational and used regularly by travelers. For example, at the end of 2018, two fuel cell trains produced by Alstom Ltd. became operational in Germany, and successful trials led to the announcement that other 14 would have put into service in 2021. In Milan (Italy), the first trains will be available in 2023. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have also shown interest in Alstom hydrogen trains [117,12], and a fuel cell tram began operating in Foshan (China) in 2019, with China exploring further possibilities for H 2 -fuelled rail [16]. 5.1.3 Medium and heavy-duty trucks H 2 could help to reduce emission related to Medium-heavy duty trucks. For these vehicles, fuel cells are considered more appealing with respect to electric batteries, which cannot guarantee long distances without stopping and recharging. Although much research is required on the subject, at the moment, a valid option seems to be using dual fuel combustion engines that can operate on both hydrogen and diesel [118–120]. 5.1.4 Maritime and aviation applications The aviation and shipping sectors can also be an important fertile ground for hydrogen. Hydrogen-based “e-fuels” (such as e-kerosene in the aviation sector and e-ammonia in the maritime industry) are made through the chemical synthesis of hydrogen and are less binding than biofuels as regards the availability of raw materials, therefore they are expected to play a role in the decarbonization path after 2030 [12,158]. Moreover, Hydrogen could be used as a direct fuel. For instance, it has been studied that a transoceanic ship fueled with H 2 could emit about 0.98 g CO 2 , eq per tonne-kilometre in comparison to approximately 5.33 g per tonne-kilometre CO 2 , eq emitted from conventional heavy fuel oil tankers [121]. Regarding Hydrogen Fuel Cells in maritime field, there are groups which are exploring the application of this technology [122]. In the aviation sector, electric and pure H 2 aircrafts could become important drivers for sky decarbonization, especially for short-distance routes. For instance, Airbus has recently announced three concept designs for hydrogen planes which could fly by 2035 [123]. These airplane concepts are powered by hybrid systems which contemplates the combustion of hydrogen in modified gas turbines and the electricity production by means of fuel cells. On the other hand, longer distance flights require fuels with higher energy densities and for this reason many research groups are working on bio and synthetic fuels derived from H 2 . In any case, as sustained by the analysis of McWilliams et al. [107], aviation is a field hard-to-decarbonize, with technologies at a very immature stage of development. It will take many years of research and development before the potential of hydrogen relative to alternatives is clarified. Moreover, there are several challenges to be addressed in order to make hydrogen technologies ready to be used in the aviation sector. As highlighted by Edwards et al. [27], it must be considered currently the lack of H 2 supplying infrastructure in the aviation industry, the required modification to aircraft design and airport operations, the longer refueling time of hydrogen in comparison to conventional fuels, the low power densities of fuel cells, the need for further investigation on load, structure and aerodynamics due to the large volumes of hydrogen tanks [124–126]."
13,Industry,"5.2 Industry Hydrogen can support the decarbonization of “hard to abate” sectors characterized by high energy intensity and the lack of scalable electrification solutions. Two of these are the chemical and petroleum refining sectors, in which hydrogen is already used as a raw material both in the production of basic chemicals such as ammonia and methanol and in a series of refining processes. Currently, over 90 % of hydrogen produced in Europe is used as a feedstock in oil refining, ammonia and methanol production, which represent about the 41 % of the EU’s industrial emissions [27]. Moreover, about 55 % of the global hydrogen demand is for ammonia synthesis, 25 % in refineries, 10 % for methanol production, and 10 % for others [127]. Currently grey H 2 (specially that derived by natural gas) is the most convenient for the ammonia and methanol production. It is worth to consider that green hydrogen could help this sector to reduce drastically emission by producing ammonia, which could be used also as an energy carrier from areas of renewable energy abundance to areas of demand, see Section 3.2. In the primary steel industry, hydrogen represents the only zero-carbon alternative in the production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), which can be progressively used to avoid the high-emission production of cast iron in the blast oxygen furnaces or electric arc furnaces. Currently, DRI technology uses natural gas as a preferential raw material: with the drop in the cost of hydrogen compared to natural gas, steel mills will be able to consider mixing hydrogen for the production of DRI. The EU produces 177 million tonnes of steel a year, 11 % of global output. Currently, the most feasible solution in EU for the decarbonization sector consists in producing DRI by using H 2 for electric arc furnaces [107]."
14,Power generation,"5.3 Power generation Hydrogen could have also an important role in the gradual decarbonization process of the current conventional power plants, which are fueled with fossil fuels, even thought synthetic and bio fuels are rising. Hydrogen, being a carbon-free fuel, represents a valid substitute of the fossil fuels with the aim to reduce the CO 2 production and the pollutants emissions (CO, soot, NO x , etc.) in combustion systems. On the other hand, hydrogen has peculiar chemical and physical properties such as: high flame speed, slightly higher adiabatic flame temperature compared to methane (see Fig. 6 ), and a different flame stabilization (different length, exhibiting different dynamics). These characteristics are completely different from the heavier fossil fuels (methane, gasoline, propane, etc.) usually employed. These features inside a real combustor can alter the heat loading, the combustor exit pattern, the ignition and blow-off, combustion instability limits and the pollutant and noise emissions. Thus, considering a gas turbine with a premixed burner, two different strategies can be proposed when working with conventional fuels enriched with H 2 by keeping roughly constant the system power output: • at low volume percentage of hydrogen ( 0 - 30 % v ), the combustor can work at constant equivalence ratio ( ϕ ) without compromising the operating temperature limits of the users. In this range, the air–fuel ratio (A/F) does not change significantly and the quantity of hydrogen on mass basis is low ( < 5 % m ); • at high volume percentage of hydrogen ( > 30 % v ), a constant mass flow rate and accordingly decreasing equivalence ratios are suggested to control the temperature by dilution. Recently, the combustion of hydrogen in the form of ammonia ( NH 3 ) or mixed with it has been investigated. This topic opens to further discussions as ammonia is characterized by different chemical properties, namely a lower flame speed and narrower flammability limits ( ϕ = 0.63 - 1.4 ) than hydrogen ( ϕ = 0.1 - 7.1 ). Thus, its mixing with hydrogen needs to be investigated. To point out the differences between hydrogen, ammonia and familiar fossil fuels, the results of collected 1D premixed laminar flames have been compared. Figs. 7 and 8 compare the laminar flame speed ( s L ) and the flame thickness ( δ ) of the three fuels: hydrogen, methane and ammonia are represented when burnt in air. The laminar flame speed, s L , is proportional to the thermal diffusivity, D th ( m 2 / s ) , of the fresh gases and the reaction rate ( R r ): (4) s L ∝ ( D th R r ) 1 / 2 whereas, the flame thickness, δ , is defined as [128]: (5) δ = D th s L The data reported have been calculated with CANTERA, which is an open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes [129]. The operating pressure and temperature correspond to atmospheric conditions, and the flammability limits of the three fuels are indicated in Table 6 . To perform these calculations, a kinetic scheme is required and for this analysis, the one developed by the CRECK Modeling Group [130] has been employed. Fig. 7 highlights the great differences in terms of laminar flame speed, in fact the hydrogen flame speed, s L H 2 , is roughly 10 times higher than the one of methane and 15 times than the one of ammonia. This means that including ammonia in hydrogen-air mixture can help to reduce its reactivity, but into certain flammability limits. Conversely, while the flame thickness δ of methane and hydrogen are comparable inside certain limits, ammonia shows a 3 times higher thickness, see Fig. 8. The analysis of these graphs shows up the necessity of further investigations. Ammonia can be a valid alternative for the storage of hydrogen and then burnt with it to generate a mixture as reactive as a fossil fuel, but with a narrow stability range. In this way the flame thickness could be reduced as well. Also mixtures of CH 4 - H 2 - NH 3 can be considered as a near-term solution to contrast the greenhouse gas emission. Conversely, it must be kept in mind that the combustion of ammonia is critical for the high production of NO x [131]. 5.3.1 PEMFC and SOFC Combustion is not the only way to obtain power from hydrogen. Electrochemical process by means of fuel cells is another solution to exploit hydrogen. Fuel cells generate electricity and operate on the opposite principle to electrolysis, which consumes electricity. Stationary fuel cells are used for commercial, industrial and residential primary and backup power generation [132,133]. Fuel cells still produce waste products in form of heat and exhaust gases as outcome of redox reaction. However, this heat can be exploited by cogeneration to produce additional power [134]. Fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations and in certain spacecraft and military applications. A fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight, and have no major moving parts. Different types of fuel cells have been developed, but among them Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are considered the most efficient and researched [135]. The substantial difference between these two types consists in the electrolyte, which is a special proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane in the case of PEMFCs and a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte for SOFCs. Table 7 compares the two technologies in terms of several parameters (operating temperature, power output, and efficiency). PEMFCs are characterized by lower temperature ranges (50 to 100 ° C ) and this makes them suitable in application where portability is a priority (e.g. for e-vehicles), whereas SOFCs work at higher temperatures (up to 1000 ° C ). Moreover, it can be seen that PEMFCs has a higher efficiency percentage (53–60 %) as compared to SOFCs (35–43%). This could be explained on the basis of high working temperatures of SOFC, which involve longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues. Despite this short coming, SOFCs have higher stack size power output (up to 2000 kW ) when compared to PEMFCs (up to 100 kW ). To make the gaseous hydrogen and oxygen react, suitable catalysts are required. Splitting the hydrogen molecule is relatively easy with a platinum catalyst. Unfortunately, splitting the oxygen molecule is more difficult, resulting in significant efficiency losses. A particularly efficient catalyst has not yet been found for oxygen, and platinum remains the best choice. There are two main lines of research on PEMFC for the purpose of improving catalysts. One of the main objectives of research on these catalysts is to increase the catalytic activity of platinum to reduce its content and therefore its cost. Another field of research regards increasing the resistance of platinum catalysts to CO poisoning. Indeed, the presence of impurities in the fuel, and particularly the presence of even very small quantities of carbon monoxide (CO), significantly reduce the catalysts activity [138,139]. Regarding SOFC, the main problem is related to their high operating temperatures. The reduction of operating temperature (at 400–600 ° C ) is a fundamental step for a widespread commercialization, but it is important to note that lower temperatures involve lower SOFCs performance, as high temperatures are usually required to promote ionic conductivity. For this reason, the scientific community and the industry are committed to find novel and inexpensive electrode and electrolyte materials able to maintain their conductive and catalytic properties even at reduced temperature achieving similar or higher efficiency than conventional high-temperature materials [21]. Nowadays, a selection of high performing material is already available [140]. The electrolyte material is the real core of the cell, affecting its performances significantly."
15,Hydrogen in domestic,"5.4 Hydrogen in domestic In the civil sector, with particular reference to residential and commercial heating, hydrogen can also contribute to decarbonization, as a competitor of heat pumps and other low-carbon technologies to replace methane and petroleum products. In some circumstances, small quantities of hydrogen can be injected in the civil NG grid or stored and transported in rural areas. Indeed, many researchers are proposing hydrogen as fuel for domestic cooker [141]. Moreover, in homes, hydrogen could be used to power fuel cell micro-CHP systems, direct flame combustion boilers, catalytic boilers and gas-powered heat pumps. For instance in Japan, CHP devices are widely deployed [142]. Moreover, the GRHYD project in France, which began by 2018 blending 6 % hydrogen into the natural gas grid, already reached 20 % on a volumetric basis in 2019, demonstrating the technical feasibility of this approach for domestic use [16]."
16,A case of study – Combined cycle gas turbine power plant,"It is of utmost importance to evaluate the impact of the hydrogen employment in real applications. For this reason, a real Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant has been selected as a case study, in order to assess the impact of the hydrogen employment (to enrich the conventional fuel) in terms of fuel consumption and GHG emissions. The analysis is based on an unfired CCGT power plant based in the Apulia region (Italy). The topping cycle is characterized by two gas turbine units up to 509 MW el and 1300 MW th , while the bottoming cycle is a Rankine cycle of 266 MW el . The power plant is currently fueled with natural gas (NG), with a combined cycle efficiency η cc = 0.568 [143]. Having few data available on the power plant, such as the power, it was necessary to make some assumptions in order to asses the effects of H 2 enrichment. Indeed, in this discussion we will consider a realistic NG composition (96.7% CH 4 , 0.3% CO 2 , 1.7% C 2 H 6 and 1.3% N 2 ) with a lower heating value (LHV) around to 47000 kJ / kg and an air fuel stochiometric ratio A / F st = 16.5 . Moreover, considering a combustion efficiency η comb = 0.99, a fuel mass flow rate of 106600 kg NG / h and 8000 working hours per year, the total fuel mass consumed is 850000 t / year , resulting in 2.3 Mt / year of CO 2 emitted. As discussed in Section 5.3, for gas turbine combustors already in operation, a threshold value of the maximum hydrogen volume percentage can be set at 30% to avoid significant changes to materials, designs, control and protection systems [144]. Under the hypothesis that a large quantity of hydrogen produced by RES during the peak periods is available, the authors want to show the impact of a 70% CH 4 and 30% H 2 fuel mixture on this CCGT. The aim has been to preserve the optimal operation of the turbines, being a critical component of the power plant. To do this, in the following calculations and discussion, the thermal load have been kept constant to avoid hazardous operating conditions. By considering a fuel composition of 70% of NG and 30% of hydrogen, the LHV and the A / F st rise to 50600 kJ / kg and 17.5, respectively. The higher LHV reduces the mass flow rate of the NG/H2 blend by 7.2% with respect to pure NG. This leads also to a reduction of the power absorbed by the compressors acting on the fuel system reducing the power absorbed by the auxiliary systems. Since hydrogen is characterized by a low molecular weight (2.016 g / mol ), a volume mixture so defined 70% of NG and 30% of hydrogen, means 95% of NG and 5% of H 2 on a mass basis. Specifically, this impacts on the NG mass flow rate supplied, which will be cut down on 12% (i.e., 0.95(1-0.072) ), and on the CO 2 production that will be decreased in the same way (-12%) by 35 t CO 2 / h (0.28 Mt CO 2 / year ). All these results impact positively on the environment. Another important aspect is how the new mixture affects the emission of NO x . Looking at Fig. 6, the adiabatic flame temperature for lean conditions, like in this case, is slightly higher for the pure hydrogen compared to methane, thus the thermal path will not impact excessively the NO production. For lean mixtures, like the one discussed in this section, the N 2 O intermediate and the NNH paths play a major role, but it is off the topic of this paper [145,146]. The question now is how can this hydrogen be produced, stored and transported? Looking at the data presented in Section 2.2, the energy necessary to produce that amount of hydrogen is variable in the range of 125 and 300 MW el depending on the technologies and efficiencies available on the market. Another important point, usually neglected when talking about hydrogen, is the water vapor production. Fig. 9 shows the effects of a progressive substitution of the NG with rising volume percentage of hydrogen (+10% per year in ten years) in terms of CO 2 and H 2 O production. Looking at the starting point, with 100% of NG, the mass flow rates of CO 2 and H 2 O are comparable. By substituting year by year part of the NG with H 2 , the CO 2 produced decreases slowly during the first years and it halves around 2028. This is a remarkable advantage provided by hydrogen in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, the water vapor produced slowly increases during the years. At the end of the fuel transition (100% H 2 ), the quantity of water vapor released in the atmosphere is increased of 55%, while the carbon dioxide is null. Globally, the amount of greenhouse gas produce is cut down by 30% if we look at the cumulative gray curve in Fig. 9. As we know, water vapor is another important GHG, but differently from CO 2 , it is controlled by the Earth’s temperature. The cumulative curve of both water vapor and CO 2 suggests that in the end a large amount of water vapor can be easily separated by condensation and reused for example for wet combustion [147]."
17,The hydrogen employment drawbacks,"The climate change is shocking the public opinion growing its consciousness towards the environmental issues. To cite one in the last years, a new Sweden word flygskam has been coined, which means “flight shame”, with the aim to reduce the environmental impact of aviation based on fossil fuels [148]. Today, many are the nations involved in different projects to elevate the amount of hydrogen employed in their production systems, energy production power plants (electricity and heat), domestic usage and mobility. As usual, when a new technology comes up, a wide view of the pros and cons has to be taken into account."
18,Environmental impact,"7.1 Environmental impact Recently, many researchers have pointed out that the rise of hydrogen leakages in the atmosphere due to the growing of its production, can be detrimental for the life on earth being a concern over the climate change. Indeed, today the level of hydrogen present in the atmosphere is 4% higher than 10 years ago. The issue is that hydrogen links to hydroxyl radicals, which can be found in the atmosphere, reducing their capacity to contrast the green house gas emissions [149]. In fact, these radicals usually help to decrease the level of free CH 4 in the atmosphere, which is together with the H 2 O a powerful GHG. Thus, the community should be aware of this risk and counteract to avoid excessive hydrogen emissions/leakages connected to the future development described in this review. When talking about aviation, the use of hydrogen can bring some drawbacks. It is known that using hydrogen as a fuel instead of fossil fuels removes the production of CO 2 , but increases of +150% the water vapour production. Thus, even with hydrogen, the contrails still represent a danger for the planet [150]."
19,Safety,"7.2 Safety Even though, today hydrogen is favorably accepted from the majority of the people especially for mobility (aircraft, cars and buses), it requires safety systems comparable to the ones used for conventional fuels. There are different aspects to take into account when talking about hydrogen [151,152]. Two parameters are of practical importance. Firstly, hydrogen is characterized by a high molecular diffusivity, hence when liquid or gaseous reservoirs leak hydrogen in a closed/opened space, this avoid build-ups, which could be in any case physiological hazardous. On the other hand, the wide flammability range ( ϕ = 0.1 - 7.1 ) and its low minimum ignition energy (20 times lower than methane, 0.017 MJ) increase the risk of explosions, when hydrogen is released. For this reason, electric and heating systems should be opportunely isolated."
20,Scarcity of fresh water,"7.3 Scarcity of fresh water As discussed in Section 2, water is the primary green source to produce hydrogen on our planet. Since the demand of hydrogen is going to rise in the next years, increasingly quantity of water will be necessary to produce hydrogen. The fact is that fresh water is precious, so many researcher are study new solutions to produce hydrogen starting from seawater [153]."
21,Emerging technologies,"As presented in this paper, there are different technologies that can be used for the hydrogen production. These can be classified on the basis of the market readiness as: near, mid and long-term solutions. This classification is based on the feedstock, energy source and production scale [154]. Herein a collection of the long-term technologies will be shown. Those currently represent solutions with low TRLs, hence they need considerable investiments in the future years, and theoretically they will produce zero-low greenhouse gas emissions and low environmental impact. Among them, thermochemical production is the one that merges either the heat recovery (e.g., nuclear or chemical power plants) or the production from RES (e.g., solar concentration technology to focus the sunlight and reach elevated temperatures 500 - 2000 ° C ) with the chemical dissociation of water [155]. During the years, two kinds of cycles have been investigated: the direct two-step or the hybrid cycles. The first one is less complex, but it requires high temperatures. The ongoing challenge is the research of material resistant to corrosive conditions. A step forward, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production is based on the splitting of water in oxygen and hydrogen by means of light and special semiconductors. The light is captured by material, which might be characterized by both high efficiency and durability. It exists in two forms: panels (as in photovoltaic panel systems) and electrodes. Compared to the thermochemical production it does not require elevated temperatures [156]. Finally, the biological or photobiological hydrogen production is another long-term technology. It is based on the harnessing of energy derived by biological processes [157]. The researchers are working on microbes, microalges or cyanobacteria, which split the water in oxygen and hydrogen ions. Due to the high worldwide daily request of energy, the near-term technologies are currently represented by those ones, which can quickly produce high quantity of hydrogen (e.g., electrolysis). This is one of the great limit of these novel technologies, which still work on small quantities of water."
22,Conclusions,"The awareness that a great change of direction must be carried out to achieve a sustainable future is worldwide evidenced by the continuous effort of different players in political, industrial and social spheres. Many countries are ahead of others with strategies already planned but they all seem now united by common goals like the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the access to clean energy. The future energy scenario will need more and more energy produced by renewable sources and hydrogen, above all the green hydrogen, will play an important role in this transition. Given the current great and widespread enthusiasm growing up towards hydrogen, the present work aims to provide recent updates on hydrogen, by focusing on the effects that it can entail in different sectors in terms of renewable source exploitation and reduction of CO 2 emissions. Each roadmap aiming at deploying hydrogen is constituted by three main milestones (production, storage and distribution, final use). Regarding the production, currently most of the hydrogen is produced from conventional fossil fuels (the so-called gray hydrogen) by means of SMR-CSS plants. Nowadays, these plants are effective only for large applications. This means that much more green hydrogen should be produced as production technologies become more and more mature with more competitive costs. At the same time, storage and distribution will be the key enabling technologies for this zero-emission scenario. Indeed, in a future where much more renewable sources will be exploited, more clean energy input will be available for a green hydrogen, which requires to be stored and transported on demand. The field of hydrogen storage proposes a variety of solutions, suitable for specific applications. Some are still voluminous and expensive (e.g., liquid hydrogen), but new solutions as the chemical storage via ammonia can promote the spread of the hydrogen economy. The proposal of the European Hydrogen Backbone represents an incredible project that sums up the strong desire to continue in this direction, where hydrogen could find several areas of application (transport, industry and power generation). Regarding these aspects different assessment have been proposed in order to evaluate the positive impact by hydrogen deployment. For green hydrogen production by electrolysis, it has been shown how the hydrogen produced starting from RES (0.0402 kgCO 2 , eq / kWh ) or Nuclear energy (0.0652 kgCO 2 , eq / kWh ) is less polluting than the one produced using power plants fueled with conventional fossil fuels (1.0 kgCO 2 , eq / kWh ). Moreover, a similar analysis has been reported for the e-vehicles sector, with means of transport connected to a RES grid (green hydrogen or electricity by RES). Indeed, means of transport with fuel cells are less efficient than cars equipped with Li-ion batteries (−40% of energy available), but less polluting ( 0 . 1402 kgCO 2 , eq / kWh I N vs. 0 . 508 kgCO 2 , eq / kWh I N ). Finally, a real Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant (located in the Apulia region, Italy) has been selected as a case study, in order to assess the impact of the hydrogen employment in terms of fuel consumption and GHG production with respect to the current status of the plant fueled with natural gas. As a result, using a mixture with 70% CH 4 and 30% H 2 a remarkable reduction of CO 2 can be achieved (0.28 Mt CO 2 / year ). In addition a trend of GHG is foreseen for the next ten years by assuming a constant increase of 10% H 2 per year. The remarkable reduction of CO 2 even with a small amount of hydrogen enrichment, point out the potentiality of this molecule and the necessity of focused investments to make the hydrogen economy come true. Obviously, hydrogen penetration in our future energy scenario need to be treated with great caution, also thinking about what the negative effects could be (environmental issues, safety and water scarcity for electrolysis). These are challenges that must push all the actors involved in completing current projects and continuing research in cutting-edge technologies in order to reach ever higher levels in terms of energy sustainability."
