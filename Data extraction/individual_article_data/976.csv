0,Introduction,"The utilization of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen to replace natural energy resources is a great challenge to the researcher for the minimization of air pollution and global warming problems [1,2]. The fabrication of hydrogen gas storage tanks is very important to utilize hydrogen energy for various engineering and industrial applications including hydrogen fuel cells, petroleum recovery and refining, production of biodiesel, food and chemical processing, aerospace, power generation, etc. [1–5]. Nowadays, polymeric materials are given special attention for a variety of packaging applications (food, pharmaceuticals, electronics and hydrogen storage tank) due to their lightweight, flexibility, low cost and ease of processing as compared with traditional materials such as glass, wood, metal and ceramics [1–3]. However, the application of commercially available polymers as gas barrier materials (packaging materials) is often limited due to their higher gas permeability for different gases (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) and higher transparency [1]. The fabrication of a hydrogen gas barrier polymeric material is extremely challenging due to the very small size and low density of hydrogen molecules. It is reported that the barrier properties of polymers are expected to be significantly enhanced due to the creation of “tortuous paths” for diffusing molecules by the addition of impermeable nanofillers (nanoclays, exfoliated graphite, and graphene and metal nanoparticles) to a polymer matrix [3]. However, the difficulties in exfoliating clay aggregates during melt-state processing limit the use of clay materials for the preparation of barrier materials. The appropriate polymeric materials for the fabrication of hydrogen storage tank should have good mechanical and film-forming properties, with good thermal stability as well as high gas barrier properties. Graphene, a two-dimensional atomically thin honeycomb lattice having very high aspect ratio, has generated intense amount of interest for nearly a decade due to its outstanding chemical, mechanical, thermal, gas barrier, electron transport and thermoelectric properties [1–8]. Therefore, incorporation of graphene to a polymer matrix has achieved a number of improved properties with promising applications in many areas, such as fuel cell, solar cell, aerospace, antifouling coatings, gas barrier (packaging), electronics, medicine [1–13]. Molecular simulations and experimental studies have revealed that graphene (defect free) is impermeable to all gas molecules [1,7]. Therefore, graphene based polymer nanocomposites have gained wide acceptance as high barrier polymeric materials, although homogeneous dispersion of graphene within the polymer matrix and effective interfacial interaction with the polymer matrix are the key factors to utilize of the appealing properties of graphene in the polymer/graphene nanocomposites. Graphene oxide (GO) has the widest potential to achieve the high-performance nanocomposite because GO can be prepared on a large scale to meet the demand for nanofillers for composite preparation, and chemically tailored to maximize its interaction with the polymer matrix [4,5,8]. GO contains many oxygen containing functional groups, which promote the complete exfoliation in different solvents and uniform dispersion of graphene oxide with the polymer matrix [3,4,6]. However, the inherent defects and holes in GO sheets diminish the gas barrier properties of the composites, and GO is also unstable in water where it slowly converts to small humic acid structures [9]. Therefore, other stratagems are needed to prepare graphene-based polymeric composites. One feasible solution is to use reduced GO (rGO) because it has less defects [1]. However, it is very difficult to prepare rGO-based polymeric films because rGO is incompatible with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers, and rGO sheets tend to form agglomerate by π–π stacking and van der Waals attractive interactions. The surface modification of GO sheets before or during reduction is expected to play a very important role in tailoring its structure and properties and it enables excellent dispersion of reduced graphene with the polymer matrix in different solvents. Therefore, proper surface functionalization of GO is needed to produce well exfoliated and high-quality graphene sheets which can form high-performance nanocomposites for diverse applications [5,8]. It is highly desirable to prepare high-performance graphene/polymer nanocomposite in an ecologically-friendly solvent such as water. In this regard, polyethyleneimine (PEI) is unique because it can simultaneously modify and reduce GO and form water dispersible and high quality graphene sheets (PEI-mGO) [8,10]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a highly polar, semi-crystalline and water-soluble biodegradable polymer, has several applications in the areas of packaging, fuel cells and coatings, etc. [1,4,11–14]. The hydrophilic and water-dispersible nature of PEI-mGO and PVA can make excellent compatibility between them in water, and hydroxyl groups of PVA can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the amine moieties and remaining oxygenated groups of PEI-mGO. Therefore, the special properties of PVA as polymer matrix and PEI-mGO as nanofiller motivated us to choose them for the fabrication PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposite films as super hydrogen barrier films (PEI-mGO/PVA). This work reports the synthesis, characterization and gas barrier properties of a series of novel nanocomposite films (PEI-mGO/PVA) fabricated from different feeding amounts (wt%) of PEI-mGO with a fixed amount of PVA. Analogous GO/PVA nanocomposite films were also prepared for comparison with the PEI-mGO/PVA films. Structure and morphology of the nanocomposites have been determined by different characterization techniques. It was attempted to understand the effects of the GO and PEI-mGO fillers on the properties of the respective composites, i.e., GO/PVA and PEI-mGO/PVA. Also, the gas barrier properties of these PEI-mGO/PVA films were systematically investigated and compared with GO/PVA nanocomposites to study the effect of addition of PEI-mGO toward the hydrogen gas barrier properties."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Expanded graphite was obtained from TIMCAL, Ltd. (Switzerland). Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Samchung Pure Chemical Co. Ltd. (Korea). Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was obtained from Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd. (Japan). Sodium nitrate (NaNO3), PVA (∼88% hydrolyzed, Mw ∼ 74,800) and polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mn ∼10,000) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (USA). The materials were used without further purification. The polyethyleneimine modified GO (PEI-mGO) was prepared according to the method reported in literature [10]."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Company, USA) at room temperature over a frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D/Max 2500V/PC diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with Cu-Kα targets (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scanning rate of 2°·min−1 under a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 100 mA. Tensile tests were carried out on a universal testing machine (Instron model 5567A, USA) equipped with a 100-N load cell with an extension rate of 5 mm min−1 and gauge length of 25 mm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) measurements were carried out in a JSM-6701F (JEOL, Japan) to determine the morphology of the fracture surface. After mechanical testing, samples were coated with a thin layer of gold prior to FE-SEM characterization. Hydrogen gas barrier properties of the pure PVA, GO/PVA and PEI-mGO/PVA films at 25 °C were determined using a GDP-C gas permeability tester (Brugger Feinmechanik GmbH, Germany). A hydrogen flow at 100 kPa and 80 cm3 min−1 was fed to one side of a 2.5 cm diameter film sample."
4,Fabrication of PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA composites,"2.3 Fabrication of PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA composites A controlled amount of the PEI-mGO dispersion was added to the PVA solution, and the mixture was sonicated for 2 h. The homogeneous PEI-mGO/PVA dispersion was then cast into a Petri dish for film formation at 50 °C until its weight equilibrated. The obtained composite films were kept at 50 °C under vacuum for three days to remove entrapped water from the films. The composite films with different wt% of PEI-mGO were prepared by the same procedures. The composite films with PEI-mGO contents of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 wt% were denoted as PEI-mGO0.5/PVA, PEI-mGO1.0/PVA, PEI-mGO1.5/PVA, PEI-mGO2.0/PVA, PEI-mGO2.5/PVA and PEI-mGO3.0/PVA, respectively. The films with neat PVA and GO/PVA nanocomposites (GO0.5/PVA, GO1.0/PVA, GO1.5/PVA, GO2.0/PVA, GO2.5/PVA and GO3.0/PVA) were prepared by a similar procedure. The probable structure of PEI-mGO/PVA composite with hydrogen bonding interaction site between PEI-mGO and PVA is shown in Scheme 1 ."
5,Results and discussion,
6,FTIR analysis,"3.1 FTIR analysis FT-IR analysis was performed to confirm the structure of PEI-mGO as well as to monitor the interaction between the PVA and the PEI-mGO in the PEI-mGO/PVA composites, as shown in Fig. 1 . The PEI-mGO showed new peaks at 1463 (C–N stretching) and 1535 cm−1 (bending vibration of N–H groups) [8,11] compared to GO. In comparison with the broad O–H stretching peak of GO, the PEI-mGO showed a less broad peak at 3430 cm−1. This is attributed to the hydrogen bonding between the N–H of PEI and the remaining oxygenated groups of modified GO. The above peaks confirm the simultaneous modification and reduction of GO by PEI. PVA exhibited a broad peak at 3443 cm−1 due to free and hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups. The characteristic peaks of the hydroxyl group for PVA shifted to a lower wavenumber as the amount of PEI-mGO increased in the PEI-mGO/PVA. This behavior has been attributed to the inhibition of hydrogen bonding among the hydroxyl groups in the PVA, and formation of new hydrogen bond between the –OH groups of PVA with the –NH groups and remaining oxygenated groups in PEI-mGO. Similar trends in FTIR spectra were found in the GO/PVA composites [15]."
7,XRD study,"3.2 XRD study Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the GO, PEI-mGO, PVA, GO/PVA, and PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposites. In the case of GO, the characteristic diffraction peak appeared at 2θ = 10.36°. The disappearance of the peak at 2θ = 10.36° and the appearance of a new broad peak at 2θ = 24° in PEI-mGO indicate the conversion of GO to modified graphene oxide (PEI-mGO) [10,16]. The typical peaks of PEI-mGO and GO disappeared in the PEI-mGO/PVA and PVA-GO composite films, respectively. This is attributed to the disorder and loss of structural regularity of the PEI-mGO and GO in the PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA composites, respectively. Therefore, the PEI-mGO and GO were fully exfoliated and dispersed at the molecular level in the PVA matrix for their respective composites. The PVA, which is a semi-crystalline polymer, showed an intense diffraction peak (101) at 2θ = 19.4° in XRD [11]. With addition of PEI-mGO into PVA, the intensity of the (101) diffraction first increases and then decreases with increase of PEI-mGO loading, which means the crystallinity of composite with 0.5 wt% loading of PEI-mGO is higher compared to others PEI-mGO/PVA composites. When more PVA chains are packed together, due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PVA repeat units, the intensity of the (101) diffraction peak of PVA becomes higher and more prominent. Therefore, at a lower loading level, the well-dispersed PEI-mGO acts as a nucleating agent, and thus the crystallinity of the nanocomposite is improved. On the other hand, the higher loading (greater than 0.5%) of PEI-mGO might hinder the regular arrangements of the PVA chains and decrease the crystallinity of the PEI-mGO/PVA composites. This is attributed to the restacking or reduction of surface area of the PEI-mGO sheets in the PEI-mGO/PVA polymer matrix at higher loadings [11]. The strong hydrogen bonding interaction between PEI-mGO and PVA chains at higher PEI-mGO loadings is also considered as an important factor to impede the crystallization of PVA. Similar diffraction patterns were also observed for GO/PVA composites."
8,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis TGA and the corresponding differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) plots of the PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA composites are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA nanocomposites showed different thermal stability. GO/PVA composites began to decompose slightly around 100 °C. This might be due to the contamination of moisture due to hydrophilic nature of the composites. However, PEI-mGO/PVA composites started to decompose above 240 °C, except for PEI-mGO0.5/PVA, which started to decompose above 135 °C. A large number of labile oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyls, carboxyls and epoxides are present in GO sheets, but when GO is modified by PEI, these functional groups of GO are reduced or eliminated. Therefore, the thermal stability of PEI-mGO/PVA composites was improved compared to the PVA and GO/PVA nanocomposites. Wang et al. also reported the higher thermal stability of reduced graphene oxide/PVA composites as compared to graphene oxide/PVA composites [17]. The disappearance of the weight loss in the range of 150–250 °C for the PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA composites demonstrated their better thermal stability compared to neat PVA. The temperature of the maximum degradation rate (obtained from the derivative of the TGA curve) of PVA started around 305 °C. The GO/PVA and PEI-mGO/PVA composites showed higher maximum degradation temperatures compared to that of neat PVA. Therefore, thermogravimetric analyses suggested that PEI-mGO played an important role in improving the thermal stability of PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposites. These phenomena have been attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between PVA and PEI-mGO in PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposites [13,15,18]. The higher thermal stability of the composites might also due to the physical barrier effects of the GO and PEI-mGO sheets, which slowed down the diffusion of pyrolysis of their respective composites."
9,Morphology,"3.4 Morphology Cross-sectional FE-SEM was performed to investigate the fracture surfaces of the PVA composites after the tensile tests. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of PEI-mGO0.5/PVA in Fig. 4 a and of GO0.5/PVA in Fig. 4e depict relatively smooth surfaces as compared to the FE-SEM images of other composites with higher loadings of fillers. Most of the PEI-mGO and GO nanosheets were ruptured rather than just being pulled out from the PVA matrix in their respective composites. The appearance of these surfaces might be due to the good interfacial interaction between PEI-mGO and PVA in PEI-mGO/PVA and between the GO and PVA matrix in GO/PVA [15,19]. However, few restacks of PEI-mGO and GO sheets were observed at higher loading levels in their respective composites. Therefore, combined with the XRD results, FE-SEM images also indicated the restacking effect which caused the decrease in crystallinity of the composites with the higher loading of fillers [16]. Representative AFM images of GO and PEI-mGO are depicted in Fig. 5 . The average thicknesses of GO and PEI-mGO were 1.0 and 2.0 nm, respectively, as obtained from AFM images, and the size distribution of the sheets was wide. The increase in thickness of PEI-mGO is ascribed to the introduction of PEI onto the graphene surface [10]. The lateral sizes of GO and PEI-mGO were almost same (around 1.0 µm)."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties The stress–strain curves of the PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. The mechanical properties of the composites improved as the amount of filler increased. The tensile strength of PEI-mGO0.5/PVA was increased by 22% and elastic modulus was increased by 20%, as compared to the PVA. When the PEI-mGO content was increased further up to 3.0 wt%, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the composites were 122.6 MPa and 3.12 GPa, respectively. The increases in the tensile strength and elastic modulus are due to the strong interfacial adhesion between the PEI-mGO and PVA matrix [12]. Elongation at break values of the PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA nanocomposites decreased with increasing filler content and the values were lower in comparison to PVA. The large aspect ratio of the fillers and the strong interaction between PEI-mGO or GO with the PVA matrix restricted the movement of the PVA chains and lowered the elongation at break of these composites (PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA) [12,20]. The mechanical properties of the polymeric films depend on humidity to some extent. The GO/PVA composites exhibited higher elongation at break and lower tensile strength values for higher GO loadings, as compared to the PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposites. The presence of moisture, which acts as a plasticizer, helps to increase the elongation at break but decrease the tensile strength [17,21]. Both GO and PVA are hydrophilic and, therefore, there may be contamination of some moisture at higher loading of GO in GO/PVA composites. Lower elongation at break and higher tensile strength of the PEI-mGO/PVA composite might also be due to the better dispersion of PEI-mGO sheets in PVA matrix compared to GO/PVA composites."
11,Gas barrier properties,"3.6 Gas barrier properties Fig. 7a and b shows the hydrogen gas transmission rates (GTRs) and permeability coefficients (P) of hydrogen through the PVA, GO/PVA and PEI-mGO/PVA composite films. The introduction of PEI-mGO caused the GTR values of the PEI-mGO/PVA composites to decrease dramatically as compared to that of pure PVA; e.g., the GTR value of PEI-mGO3.0/PVA was 8.8 as compared to the GTR value of 156.5 cm3 per m2 per day per atm for pure PVA. Hence, PEI-mGO3.0/PVA exhibited a 95% decrease in GTR as compared to a pure PVA film. The PEI-mGO3.0/PVA film also showed a 94% decrease in the permeability coefficient as compared to that for pure PVA. It was found that, as the PEI-mGO content was increased in PEI-mGO/PVA composites from 0.5 wt% (PEI-mGO0.5/PVA) to 3.0 wt% (PEI-mGO3.0/PVA), the GTR values decreased from 42.3 to 8.8 cm3 per m2 per day per atm. The introduction of GO also decreased the GTR values dramatically in the GO/PVA composites as compared to pure PVA; e.g., the GTR value of GO3.0/PVA was 15.1 as compared to the 156.5 cm3 per m2 per day per atm for pure PVA. It is reported in literature that the introduction of the impermeable filler increases the barrier properties of the composites [1]. GO and PEI-mGO have high aspect ratios, and it has been reported that large aspect ratio fillers can create more tortuous paths which can hinder the permeation of gas molecules [1,22]. The increase in barrier properties by the impermeable graphene sheets in the composites compared to PVA film is attributed to the increased tortuosity of the permeation path travelled by hydrogen molecules inside the composites. There may be also the possibility of forming “brick wall” structures in GO/PVA and PEI-mGO/PVA composites systems, where GO or PEI-mGO acts as the bricks, while the PVA chain acts as the mortar in their respective composites, and this type of structure can produce super tortuosity and diffusion length for gas molecules [1,23]. The GTR and permeability values of PEI-mGO/PVA and GO/PVA showed that the barrier properties increased as the amount of fillers (GO/PVA and PEI-mGO) increased in the composites. Therefore, it is reasonable that the construction of more tortuous paths for permeating molecules at higher loading of graphene sheets can greatly decrease the GTR values. PEI-mGO3.0/PVA having highest PEI-mGO loading exhibited a 95% decrease in GTR, and GO3.0/PVA having highest GO loading exhibited a 90% decrease in GTR compared to PVA. More decrease in barrier properties of PEI-mGO3.0/PVA compared to GO3.0/PVA with similar filler content is really a striking achievement. Furthermore, GO is unstable in presence of moisture in comparison to PEI-mGO, and thermal and mechanical stabilities of PEI-mGO/PVA were higher compared to GO/PVA nanocomposites. Therefore, the present study shows a new possibility to use PEI-mGO/PVA for the preparation of barrier materials in the near future. The chemical oxidation of graphite to produce GO results in defects and holes on its basal plane of GO, which allow the permeation of very small molecules like hydrogen. In addition, the hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups easily absorb moisture from the air, resulting in an increase of the interlayer gallery spacing. However, the gallery spacing and defects present in the GO film are mostly filled with PEI in PEI-mGO [10]. The –NH2 functionalities of PEI react with the epoxide functionalities of GO and form reduced and compact PEI-mGO. The improved gas barrier performance of the PEI-mGO/PVA composite films is attributed to the PEI-mGO sheets, which produce a highly impermeable material with PVA that increases the barrier properties compared to GO/PVA. The permeability coefficient depends on the solubility (S) and diffusion (D) coefficients of a gas for a polymer film. The incorporation of graphene nanosheets to a polymer matrix reduces solubility of the gas in the nanocomposite, due to the insolubility of gas in the nanosheets. The diffusivity of the gas also decreases because the gas molecules have to move around the newly introduced impermeable two-dimensional nanofiller to diffuse through the polymer [5]. Thus, the diffusing molecules will be forced to follow longer and more tortuous pathway in order to pass through the nanocomposite film, resulting in a significant decline in D value [3]. The change in gas solubility generally depends on the concentration of the nanofillers (φ c ) and diffusivity depends on the aspect ratio (α) of the two-dimensional fillers for a nanocomposite film [5]. The modified Nielsen and Cussler models incorporating the above parameters (φ c and α) are given as equations (1) and (2), respectively [5]. The equations have been used to determine the relative permeability values (P/P m , where P m is the permeability of the neat polymer film and P is that of the composites). (1) P P m = 1 − ϕ c 1 + 1 3 × α 2 × ϕ c (2) P P m = ( 1 + α 2 ϕ c 2 1 − ϕ c ) − 1 The Nielsen model is applicable for randomly distributed fillers with limited interaction between filler and polymer matrix, while the Cussler model is suitable for composites with highly ordered array (align parallel) of fillers. The experimental relative permeability values (P/P m ) were compared with the data obtained from the Nielsen and Cussler models (Fig. 8a and b). The experimental relative permeability data (P/P m ) were located in between the Cussler model and the modified Nielsen model. However, comparatively good agreement was found between the experimental relative permeability data obtained for the PEI-mGO/PVA nanocomposites and the theoretical data obtained from the Cussler model (highly ordered distribution of fillers). This might be due to the PEI-mGO sheets have somewhat similar morphology to that described in the Cussler model. However, the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical results might be attributed to the different distribution and orientation of GO or PEI-mGO in the PVA matrix compared to Nielsen model and Cussler model and it is also difficult to determine the exact aspect ratio of graphene in the respective nanocomposites. According to Nielsen and Cussler models, P/P m is a function of φ c and α of the nanofiller. However, the contribution of the polymer matrix and its permeability value are not incorporated in the modified Cussler model or the Nielsen model. So, further optimization of Nielsen and Cussler models may provide P/P m data closer to the experimental relative permeability values [3]."
12,Conclusions,"An ecologically-friendly, novel and valuable solution casting method for the preparation of a series of novel highly impermeable hydrogen gas barrier composite films using different wt% of modified and reduced graphene (PEI-mGO) with fixed amount of poly(vinyl alcohol) as the base polymer has been developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in situ reduced and modified graphene (PEI-mGO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) based nanocomposite films for hydrogen gas barrier study. The crystallinity of the PEI-mGO/PVA composites decreased with the increase of filler loading (PEI-mGO). This is attributed to the restacking effect of PEI-mGO sheets in the PEI-mGO/PVA, and also to the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the PEI-mGO and the PVA chains at higher PEI-mGO loadings. The PEI-mGO/PVA composites showed higher thermal stability, yield strength and elastic modulus compared to neat PVA. The hydrogen gas transmission rate (GTR) test revealed that PEI-mGO played a crucial role in enhancing the gas barrier properties of the composites, as compared to pure PVA films. The GTR value of the PEI-mGO/PVA composite loaded with 3.0 wt% of PEI-mGO declined to 8.8 from 156 cm3 per m2 per day per atm of pure PVA. The properties of PEI-mGO/PVA composites were compared with those of GO/PVA composites. The comparison of different properties between PEI-mGO/PVA and mGO/PVA revealed that PEI-mGO can be used as a very effective filler to improve the thermal stability, mechanical properties and gas barrier properties of the polymeric composites. The present study shows a new possibility to use PEI-mGO/PVA for the preparation of barrier materials in the near future."
