0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil resources like oil, natural gas, and coal with negative impacts on climate change has inspired academic and industrial researchers to find alternative energy carriers based on renewable raw materials [1]. Nowadays bioethanol, biodiesel, and biogas are more perspective and environmentally friendly substitutes of gasoline, diesel and natural gas. Biodiesel is essentially produced through transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats by acid or basic catalysts, with glycerol as the principal byproduct of the process (Scheme S1) [2]. Production of biodiesel grows every year, but according to transesterification reaction stoichiometry, 1 mol of triglyceride gives 3 mol of esters and 1 mol of glycerol. Therefore for every 9 kg of biodiesel produced, about 1 kg of a crude glycerol byproduct is formed [3]. It was predicted [4] that almost 3.7 million tons of glycerol from biodiesel industry will enter the international market by 2020. At the same time, the market price of glycerol has dropped rapidly with the increase of glycerol supply on the markets. Therefore, catalytic conversion of the enormous quantity of glycerol to valuable products is an essential task and it will be of great importance for the biodiesel economy [5]. Besides the widely studied products of glycerol valorization in a packed-bed reactor to acrolein [6], acrylic acid [7], dihydroxyacetone [8], hydroxyacetone [9], lactic acid [10], glycidol [11] and ethanol [12] only few research groups [13–23] have recently started to focus on allyl alcohol production in the gas-phase, which is known as a valuable material in the chemical industry and can be used for the synthesis of glycidol, polymers, amines, esters and ethers. Table 1 shows the list of the most important compounds with price and application, which can be synthesized from glycerol. Allyl alcohol is an industrially important substance, mostly used for the production of chemical intermediate in organic synthesis. Current industrial processes for the production of allyl alcohol are fossil fuel-based routes from hydrogenation of propylene-derived acrolein (Scheme S2a) or propylene oxide isomerization (Scheme S2b) [22]. In addition, the allyl alcohol can be produced by the catalyzed acetoxylation of propylene over noble metal catalysts (Scheme S2c). All these methods have many disadvantages such as environmentally unfriendly route, multistep synthesis, unsustainable process, expensive and toxic feedstocks. These disadvantages in the current industrial processes have stimulated researchers to develop new sustainable routes for production of allyl alcohol from glycerol. Nowadays, there is no industrial process for the large-scale production of allyl alcohol from glycerol. The market size of allyl alcohol is 0.1 Mt/year with price 2.2–3.2 USD/kg [4], making it much more commercially attractive in comparison to glycerol (0.1–0.6 USD/kg) [24]. During the past few years, the one-step deoxydehydration (DODH) reaction of glycerol in a liquid phase batch reactor has received increased interest, where typically heterogeneous Re catalysts are used (Scheme 1 a) [25,26]. Moreover, many homogeneous catalysts with different reducing agents for DODH reaction have been published in the literature (Scheme 1b-c) [27,28]. The main disadvantages of DODH reaction are expensive catalysts, low reaction rates, low feedstock concentration, liquid phase reaction, batch-type reactor operation, high pressure, limited recyclability. Moreover, H donor and solvents are necessary. The glycerol conversion and allyl alcohol selectivity in the gas-phase reaction in a packed-bed reactor can be easily modified with parameters such as GHSV and temperature reaction, in comparison with the batch, liquid-phase reactor [29]. The pioneering work on the catalytic synthesis of allyl alcohol from glycerol in the gas-phase was performed in the Schüth group [13] (Scheme 1d). The reaction is catalyzed by Fe2O3 with a remarkable allyl alcohol yield of 20 mol%. The catalyst showed good stability after 24 h time-on-stream (TOS). It was also proposed that the hydrogen transfer mechanism is responsible for allyl alcohol formation, although the details of how the hydrogen transfer takes place are still under investigation. Tago et al. [14] studied the reaction routes for direct conversion of glycerol to allyl alcohol over ZrO2-FeOx catalyst. The highly active ZrO2-FeOx catalyst was stable in the reaction of a 50 wt% glycerol solution for 6 h. The highest yield of allyl alcohol production over ZrO2-FeOx catalyst was 20 mol% within 2 h on stream. The same authors further studied the same reaction over ZrO2-FeOx catalyst modified with different alkali metals, including Na, K, Rb, and Cs [16,23]. The glycerol dehydration was efficiently suppressed due to partial elimination of acid sites. The K-ZrO2-FeOX catalyst showed a remarkable allyl alcohol yield of 27 mol% when K content of 3–5 mol% was deposited. Thereafter, the gas-phase conversion of glycerol to allyl alcohol was carried out over Fe-ɤ-alumina catalyst by the Stockenhuber group [15,17]. It was found that Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs modification increased the allyl alcohol yield and lowered the rate of catalyst deactivation. The FeOx plays an important role in providing redox sites for this reduction reaction. It was established that increasing basicity leads to allyl alcohol formation and higher catalytic activity. Also, alkali metals lead to the formation of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, but the latter was not stable at the reaction conditions and decomposed into H2 and CO. The formation of higher quantities of formaldehyde and H2 enhanced allyl alcohol yield. The most active catalysts were the Fe-ɤ-alumina and Fe-Rb-ɤ-alumina which showed a yield of 4.0 mol% and 11.6 mol%, respectively with TOS = 3 h. Later, Sánchez et al. [22] reported the study of the Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts with SiO2/Al2O3 = 30, modified by Rb deposition, as stable materials for the conversion of glycerol to allyl alcohol. It was established that modification of Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst by Rb metal led to additional improvement in the allyl alcohol yield with a simultaneous decrease in acrolein yield. The 13 wt%Fe-Rb-ZSM-5(30) zeolite catalyst exhibited the highest allyl alcohol yield among all other synthesized catalysts, namely 11.8 mol%. The Perez-Ramirez group [21] reported the study of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite in the gas-phase glycerol dehydration to acrolein and reduction of the latter to allyl alcohol by using a continuous packed-bed reactor at 400 °C in the presence of hydrogen under 40 bar. ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst with SiO2/Al2O3 = 20 was chosen for modifying by facile alkaline and acid treatments, which decreased the amount of Lewis acid centers while preserving the Brønsted acid centers and introduced an auxiliary network of intracrystalline mesopores. After the post-synthetic modification step, different metals such as Pt, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Au were deposited by incipient wetness impregnation. Upon optimization of the metal loading, temperature, pressure, and contact time, it was established that the 5 wt%Ag-ZSM-5 was a superior hydrogenation catalyst among studied and showed the synergistic effect which led to 15 mol% yield of allyl alcohol at TOS = 2 h. In the same year, Lan et al. [18] published their work on the effect of adding Fe-Mo bimetal species to KIT-6 silica. This catalyst was used for the direct catalytic conversion of glycerol (35 wt%) to allyl alcohol in the gas-phase without hydrogen donor at 340 °C. It was demonstrated that the bimetallic FeMo-KIT-6 catalyst has much higher selectivity than monometallic. This was explained by the strong synergistic effect between Fe2O3 and MoO3 which alters the surface moderate acid strength, the number of acid sites and reducibility of catalysts, following a hydrogen transfer mechanism. The 3.84 wt%Fe1.16 wt%Mo-KIT-6 catalyst exhibited a high allyl alcohol yield of 26.8% at 94.0% glycerol conversion. Nevertheless, this catalyst rapidly deactivated after 2 h time on stream. Recently, H. Lan et al. [19] established the promotional effect of CeO2 support on FeMo-KIT-6 catalyst for allyl alcohol production from glycerol at the same reaction conditions as studied previously. The highest allyl alcohol yield was 22.6% at 97.1% glycerol conversion. As in previous work, the catalyst started to deactivate after 2 h time on stream. Very recently, R. Almeida et al. [20] investigated the Cs-V-BEA zeolite catalyst (Si/Al = 25, V – 3.7 wt%, Cs – 7.4 wt%) for the direct gas-phase conversion of glycerol to allyl alcohol. It was shown that addition of Cs and V increased the allyl alcohol selectivity to 30% with the glycerol conversion reaching 20%. The highest allyl alcohol yield was 10.5% during a 4 h catalytic test. This catalytic behavior was explained by a decrease of strong acid sites, resulting from the introduction of Cs-induced basicity. The main unresolved issues of the studied catalysts in one-step allyl alcohol production from glycerol in the gas-phase are the low yield of allyl alcohol and fast catalysts deactivation at the studied reaction conditions. In addition, it is clear that the allyl alcohol selectivity and glycerol conversion are strongly dependent on the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst [30]. This study focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of the FeMo-ZSM-5 and CsFeMo-ZSM-5 catalysts for the direct gas-phase conversion of glycerol to allyl alcohol in a packed-bed reactor without any additional reducing agent. Fe, Mo and Cs were deposited by wet-impregnation method in different amounts over mesoporous HZSM-5 zeolites with a different SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios. The effect of metal loading on the number and type of acid sites, morphology, catalytic activity and stability were studied. The aim is to identify the active site requirements for selective transformation of glycerol to allylic alcohol."

3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis The synthesis of metal-promoted zeolite catalysts involved wet impregnation of commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (molar SiO2/Al2O3 = 30, Zeolyst Int., CBV 3024E) and HZSM-5 (molar SiO2/Al2O3 = 1500, Tosoh Corp., HSZ-890HOA) zeolites with aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and cesium nitrate CsNO3. The NH4-ZSM-5 and HZSM-5 commercial zeolites were calcined at 550 °C in air for 6 h to convert the ammonium to a protonated form and/or to completely remove any organic residues from the protonated form. Samples containing both molybdenum and iron were prepared by a two-step impregnation procedure: an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.001 M) was introduced first and stirred for 2 h, followed by an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.01 M) under stirring during 2 h. The temperature of the solution was raised up to 80 °C. Samples containing Cs, Fe, and Mo were prepared by a three-step impregnation procedure. At the beginning, an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (1 × 10-3 M) was introduced to the ZSM-5 zeolite powder under vigorous stirring (500 rpm) during 2 h at 80 °C. Then, an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 × 10-2 M) was added under stirring for 2 h. Finally, an aqueous solution of CsNO3 (1 × 10-2 M) was introduced and stirred during 2 h. The different Cs loading was achieved by varying volume of 0.01 M CsNO3 solution. The temperature of the solution was kept at 80 °C. Thereafter, the sample was dried overnight at 110 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. All prepared catalyst samples were pressed into a pellet, crushed and sieved to obtain a particle fraction of 250–400 μm in size before to put into the packed-bed reactor. The total of six different catalysts were synthesized: 2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(30), 2.5wt%Cs2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(30), 2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(1500), 2.5wt%Cs2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(1500), 5 wt%Cs2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(1500), and 10wt%Cs2.5wt%Fe2.5wt%MoZSM-5(1500). The number in parenthesis indicates the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio in the catalyst support."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 N2 Physisorption The specific surface area measurements were performed by using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. 150 mg of catalyst was placed into the sample tube, degassed in vacuum and heated to 200 °C overnight. Afterward, the BET surface area, microporous surface area, mesopore surface area, micropore volume, total pore volume, mesopore volume, and average pore diameters were measured at −196 °C by N2 adsorption/desorption. The pore-size distributions were calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherms by the BJH method. Micropore volumes were derived from t-plots using model isotherms as reference that were calculated by the Harkins-Jura formula. 2.3.2 Powder X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) XRD analysis was carried out by PANalytical XpertPro diffractometer using CuKα1 radiation (1.54056 Ǻ) in Bragg-Brentano geometry. XRD data were obtained in the 2θ range from 5 to 70°, with a measurement step of 0.034°. The crystallite size was determined by the Scherrer equation: (1) D = K λ β cos θ where D is the mean crystallite size, K is a dimensionless shape factor with a value of 0.9, λ - the X-ray wavelength (1.5406 Å), β - the full width at half maxima and θ - the Bragg angle. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak between 7.7 and 7.8° from the scan of each sample was obtained and was used to estimate the crystallite size [31]. The crystallinity of the samples was calculated using 7.5–9.5° and 22.5–25.0° 2 theta ranges [32,33]. 2.3.3 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis The catalyst samples were fumed with a mixture of HF and HClO4. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of HCl and H3BO3. The quantification of Fe and Mo was determined by ICP-AES (Varian, model 715-ES), quantification of Cs by ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, Model 7500ce). The amounts of Si and Al were determined for the parent ZSM-5 zeolites. 2.3.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis SEM analysis of each synthesized catalyst sample was performed on FE-SEM SUPRA 35-VP (Carl Zeiss) which operated at accelerating voltage of 2 kV [34]. 2.3.5 Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) - energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis First, the catalyst sample was dispersed in absolute ethanol and sonicated to limit particles agglomeration. Thereafter, this suspension was placed onto commercial lacey-carbon Ni or Au support grids. Scanning transmission electron microscope (Jeol, ARM 200 CF, 200 kV) was equipped with a cold field-emission gun and analysis was carried out in the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was carried out by the Jeol Centurio EDXS system with 100 mm2 silicon drifted detector (SDD). 2.3.6 NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis The acidic properties of the catalysts were analyzed by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) in an Autochem 2920 II instrument from Micromeritics system with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to measure the NH3 desorption and an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, model ThermoStar™ GSD 301 T) to detect various species (ions of m/z = 17, 18, 28, 30, 32 and 44 for NH3, H2O, N2, NO, O2 and N2O, respectively) the effluent stream during the NH3-TPD experiment. The Quartz U-tube reactor was loaded with 100 mg of the catalyst sample and heated to 500 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 100 °C in He atmosphere to remove moisture·NH3 adsorption was carried out at 100 °C for 30 min by flowing 10 vol% NH3/He under a flow rate of 20 ml/min to saturate the acid sites of the catalyst. The system was then flushed with He at 100 °C for 60 min to remove the weakly or physically adsorbed NH3 from the surface of the catalyst sample. The NH3-TPD profiles were recorded in the range between 100 and 600 °C at 10 °C/min heating rate. 2.3.7 CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) analysis Number and strength of basic sites were evaluated using CO2-TPD analysis. Tests were performed on an Autochem 2920 (Micromeritics) apparatus, connected to a mass spectrometer (Thermostar by Pfeiffer Vacuum). For the analysis, 100 mg of powdered sample was used. First, the sample was heated to 300 °C for 10 min in 5% O2/He stream (20 ml/min) to clean their surface. After cooling to 10 °C, the sample was saturated with CO2 (50% CO2/He, 20 ml/min) for 20 min, followed by degassing and desorption of weakly bound CO2 at 10 °C. During temperature programmed desorption, the samples were heated to 800 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min in He flow (20 ml/min). CO2 desorption was analyzed by following the m/z = 44 fragment. 2.3.8 Pyridine diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis (LAS) acid sites of different ZSM-5 based catalysts were differentiated by DRIFTS analysis using Frontier IR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer), DiffusIR® accessory from Pike Scientific and pyridine as the probe molecule. 10 mg of the investigated sample was pretreated in N2 with a flow rate of 50 ml/min at 500 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the sample was cooled to 125 °C and saturated with pyridine vapors for 10 min. The degassing was carried out under vacuum pressure 2 × 10-5 mbar for 30 min. Spectra recording was carried out with 16 accumulations and spectral resolution of 4 nm in the range of 800–4000 cm−1. The absorption band at 1445 cm−1 relates to pyridine coordinatively adsorbed on LAS, while the second band at 1545 cm−1 corresponds to pyridinium ion bound with BAS. The BAS/LAS ratio was calculated as follow: (2) C BAS / C LAS = 1.73 / 1.23 × I BAS / I LAS where IBAS and ILAS - intensity of absorption bands at 1545 and 1445 cm−1; 1.73 and 1.23 - relevant extinction coefficients. 2.3.9 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on PHI-TFA XPS spectrometer (Physical Electronics Inc., USA) equipped with Al-monochromatic X-ray source and hemispherical analyzer of energy of emitted photoelectrons. The sample was excited by X-ray radiation from monochromatic Al-Kα source at the photon energy of 1486.6 eV. The high-energy resolution spectra were acquired with an energy analyzer operating at the resolution of approximately 0.6 eV and a pass energy of 29 eV. Analyzed area was 0.4 mm in diameter. Neutralizer gun was used to avoid charging of the surface. XPS spectra were aligned to C1s peak at 284.8 eV related with adventitious carbon on the surface. Accuracy of binding energy was ± 0.3 eV. Quantification of surface composition and assignments of oxidation states was performed by means of data base. 2.3.10 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermogravimetric analysis on a DynTHERM (High pressure TGA with Magnetic Suspension Balance, Germany) instrument was carried out to determine the amount of carbonaceous deposits accumulated on the catalyst samples. The analysis of the spent catalysts were performed in the temperature range from 40 to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an air stream of flow rate 100 ml/min."
5,Catalytic evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic evaluation The direct gas-phase conversion of glycerol into allyl alcohol (Scheme 2 ) was studied in an automated laboratory packed-bed microactivity reactor (Microactivity-Reference, PID Eng&Tech) under atmospheric pressure. The aqueous solution of 10 wt% glycerol was kept at room temperature in a reservoir tank outside of the hot box. The feedstock was injected into the hot box by the 307 HPLC Piston Pump (Gilson Inc.). The N2 gas was introduced into the hot box with mass flow controllers (FT1) at a flowrate of 10 ml/min. The glycerol aqueous solution entering the hot box was vaporized, since the temperature inside was held at 140 °C, with the assistance of an electric convection heater, controlled by the temperature controller, TIC. Afterward, the glycerol solution vapor was mixed with an N2 carrier gas. It is known from the literature data [35] that boiling point of 10 wt% glycerol water solution is 100.9 °C, which is much lower than set up working temperature in the hot box. 1 – N2 gas storage tank; 2 – inlet glycerol tank; 3 – HPLC pump; 4 – convection heater, 5 – hot box; 6 – reactor; 7 – oven; 8 – packed-bed; 9 – quartz wool; 10 – steel porous plate; 11 – six port bypass valve; 12 – Peltier cooling cell; 13 – condenser; 14 – GC-FID (Agilent-7890A); 15 – GC–MS (Shimadzu, QP2010); 16 – personal computers. The inlet stream was then passed through a six-port VICI reactor standard bypass valve and was either introduced into the reactor or sent out of the reactor. The reactor was a stainless steel tube (9 mm internal diameter, 305 mm long). The catalyst (500 mg) was packed inside of the tubular reactor and insulated with a 15 mm layer of quartz wool at the top and bottom. The temperature of the packed-bed was measured with a thermocouple with the TIC controller. After leaving the reactor tube, the outlet stream was conducted through the six-port bypass valve and redirected into the Peltier cooling cell. The products were cooled inside the cell to 0 °C. The liquid level in the cooling cell was controlled with a level controller (LIC). Thereafter, the products were sent into the condenser placed below the reactor. All mass flow, temperature, pressure, and level controllers, as well as the pump and reactor operational parameters were directly programmed and controlled by the computer. The collected liquid samples were then analyzed by gas chromatography GC (Agilent GC-7890A) with a measurement repeatability of the relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 5% equipped with FID detector. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The capillary column was 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm DB-WAX Ultra Inert. To achieve effective product separation, the column was held at 40 °C for 4 min before the temperature was ramped up to 200 °C at a rate of 12 °C/min and remained there for 10 min. The split ratio was 1:150. All products were quantified via an external calibration method verified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (Shimadzu GC–MS QP2010) with the capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5um Zebron ZB-WAX-Plus. The typical glycerol conversion liquid products detected were allyl alcohol, hydroxyacetone, acrolein, 1,2-propanediol, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, ethanol, 1,3-dioxan-5-ol, formaldehyde, methanol, acrylic acid, propionaldehyde, and propionic acid. Calibration curves were measured in the 0.1–10 wt% range by using the chemicals mentioned above in the chemical used paragraph. The conversion of glycerol, XGL, the selectivity, and yield to the product i, Si, Y i , respectively, calculated using the equations below: (3) X GL mol % = n GL in - n GL out n GL in × 100 (4) S i mol % = n i n GL in - n GL out × Z i Z GL × 100 (5) Y i mol % = n i n GL in × Z i Z GL × 100 where n GL in and n GL out are the input and output moles of glycerol, n i is the moles of the products i, ZGL = 3 (the number of carbon atoms in the GL molecule), and Z i represents the number of carbon atoms in the products. The values in this article are in mole percent. The reaction of glycerol reforming was not detected. The mass balance of liquid products was calculated for each experiment and was usually above 94%. The difference in mass balance was in the range of the experimental error. The studied conversion and selectivity figures were calculated as average values of three measurements."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis The XRD patterns of the HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(1500), 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The patterns represent distinct sharp diffraction peaks in 2θ ranges of 7.5–9.5 and 22.5–25.2°. All samples exhibit the typical diffraction peaks of the monoclinic ZSM-5 structure, indicating that the crystalline nature of zeolites was maintained without any structural change after incorporation of Cs, Fe, and Mo species [36–38]. In addition, no diffraction peaks indicating the presence of cesium, iron, and molybdenum oxides were detected in the ZSM-5, which may be due to several factors such as a low metal loading and/or their high dispersion [39–41]. The intensity of the zeolite diffraction peaks decreased after the addition of Fe, Mo, and Cs in comparison to the parent zeolite due to progressively lower fraction of zeolite in the analyzed samples. Also, when Cs addition of 5 and 10 wt% was reached, splitting of the 133 and 13–3 peaks (2 theta = 24.5°) was observed, which is characteristic of the gradual transition from the orthorhombic to the monoclinic symmetry [42]. Such a structural transition was not observed in the aluminum rich samples because of the lower Cs loading (Fig. 1). The change in symmetry from orthorhombic to monoclinic in the highly silicious ZSM-5 zeolite series has been observed previously upon ion-exchange or calcination [43,44]. The splitted peaks for the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts at 23.3° indicates that ZSM-5 framework due to alkali treatment is partly dissolved [45]. 3.1.2 N2 Physisorption analysis The Cs, Fe, and Mo content, BET surface area (SBET), micropore surface area (Smicro), mesopore surface area (Smeso), micropore volume (Vmicro), mesopore volume (Vmeso), total pore volume (Vtotal), average pore diameters (PD), hierarchy factor (HF) and crystallite size of the studied catalysts are presented in Table 2 and Figs. S1 and S2. Mesopore volume was calculated as the difference between Vtotal and Vmicro [46]. The hierarchy factors were calculated according to the following equation: HF = S meso / S BET × V micro / V total [47]. The deposition of Cs, Fe, and Mo species onto the HZSM-5 zeolite supports progressively decreased the BET surface areas, Smicro and Vmicro. Total pore volume remained stable until Cs loading of 2.5 wt% and decreased after it reached 5 and 10 wt%. On the other hand, Smeso and Vmeso increased when the amounts of modifying species was increased over both HZSM-5 supports. These trends are consistent with partial filling of micropores, formation of a new amorphous mesoporous phases and/or dissolution of the zeolite framework with an amorphous silica layer formation which was also confirmed by SEM analysis, chapter 3.1.3 [48]. Hierarchy factor (HF) can be applied for distinguishing between conventional microporous zeolites (HF ≤ 0.1) or and hierarchical mesoporous zeolites (HF > 0.1). The HF values for all samples were in the range of 0.102–0.212, suggesting high relative mesoporosity of the studied catalysts [36,37,47]. For the promoted samples based on HZSM-5(30), the HF decreased from 0.162 to 0.143 with an increasing quantity of deposited metal species. A reverse trend was found for the HZSM-5(1500) based samples. It was observed that HF increased from 0.102 to 0.212 with increasing the amount of Cs. This difference suggest different association of Fe, Mo and Cs species in aluminum rich and aluminum poor HZSM-5 supports: namely formation of segregated mesoporous. It was found that crystallinity of studied samples decreased with increasing amount of metal loading. The 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst exhibited the lowest value with 52.8% of crystallinity, which can be related to desilication of ZSM-5 framework. In the case of the crystallite size, no significant difference after metals loading was detected. Only commercial parent HZSM-5(30) and HZSM-5(1500) zeolites showed the difference with crystallite size of 57 and 92 nm, respectively. When Cs was added to HZSM-5(1500) zeolite as a third metal, the crystallite size decreased from 92 to 79 nm. 3.1.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM analysis for the catalyst samples with SiO2/Al2O3 = 30 are presented on (Fig. 3 A–C). Zeolite particle sizes in the range of 50–200 nm were observed. The small particles were detected on zeolite surface for the 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30) catalyst which can be attributed to the iron oxide species [38]. This will be substantiated further with TEM-EDXS analysis in chapter 3.1.4 [36]. In the case of the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30) catalyst, the iron oxide species were observed along with the slight destruction of zeolite framework. The latter effect can be explained by the impregnation of CsNO3 salt, since it was previously reported that the alkali treatment leads to the dissolution of the zeolite framework [48]. SEM images obtained from the catalyst samples with SiO2/Al2O3 = 1500 (Fig. 3D-H) showed much bigger crystallites; in the range of 1–2 µm. Similarly to the ZSM-5(30) based samples, deposition of Fe and Mo species over the 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst (Fig. 3E) resulted in the formation of segregated iron oxide particles which is also supported by TEM-EDXS analysis. After Cs deposition, the MFI structure of zeolite was slightly modified due to the extraction of Si atoms resulting in a secondary network of interconnected mesopores [21]. 3.1.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) - energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis Fig. 4 shows TEM micrographs of the 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalysts. In the 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30) sample (Fig. 4A-B), the surface of zeolite crystals is decorated with nanoparticles (5–15 nm), as well as larger aggregates (~100 nm) of iron oxide (Fig. 4B, Fe elemental map). The 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst (Fig. 4C) shows an extensive coverage of HZSM-5 crystals with elongated iron oxide particles with size range distribution of approximately 10–65 nm. In the 10Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst (Fig. 4E), large agglomerates of iron oxide particles were observed on the surface of the zeolite crystals. The spatial distribution of Fe, Mo, and Cs phases was analyzed by EDXS mapping (Fig. 4B, 4D and 4F). The iron-rich nanoparticles are located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, regardless of the aluminum content in the zeolite and absence/presence of Cs. These were evident also from SEM analysis. On the other hand, Mo and Cs appear more homogeneously dispersed, suggesting they are predominantly located inside of the channels of the zeolite support. This is in line with extensive body of literature data [49–51] reporting that Mo species can easily diffuse inside the zeolite’s pore channels and anchor to the Brønsted acid sites (BAS). Also, high basicity of Cs favors its association with Brønsted acid sites [52,53] located inside the ZSM-5 channels. Briefly, TEM-EDX analysis suggests the outer surface of the analyzed HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is covered with FeOx rich clusters 5–100 nm in size, whereas Mo and Cs appear to be finely dispersed and predominantly associated with BAS inside the zeolite pores. 3.1.5 CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) analysis Fig. 5 shows the CO2-TPD results of the parent HZSM-5 and metal-promoted zeolites by transition and alkali metals, which exhibit basicity behavior. Total basicity, calculated based on CO2-TPD results is shown in Table 3 . Small desorption peaks centered at 45 and 135 °C are seen for the parent HZSM-5(30) and HZSM-5(1500) zeolites (traces a and b, respectively). These peaks indicate the presence of minute amounts of weak surface basic sites in the HZSM-5, very likely as a result of CO2 interaction with the framework of HZSM-5 [11,12,54]. All modified zeolite samples exhibit two main desorption peaks in region I: 10–120 °C, and region II: 235–560 °C, representing medium and strong basic sites, respectively. Addition of 2.5% Fe and Mo caused the appearance of strong basic sites (traces c and d), which were more abundant in the HZSM-5(1500) based sample. The progressive increase of Cs loading in the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5 samples increased the intensity of the CO2 desorption peak and increased the surface basicity, which is in good agreement with the literature data [55,56]. Increase of Cs loading to 10 wt% resulted in increase of the intensity of the CO2 desorption peak at 52 °C in comparison to 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) samples. On the other hand, for the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) sample increase of the strong base at 350 °C was observed, which may be assigned to the interaction between CO2 and Cs-containing species [57]. Thus, the appropriate amount of CsNO3 in the trimetallic zeolite catalysts would lead to the formation of an increased amount of surface basic sites from 0.9 to 16.7 µmolCO2/gcatalyst. 3.1.6 NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis The acidity was investigated by NH3-TPD (Fig. 6 ) and quantification is exhibited in Table 3. The two peaks in HZSM-5(30) desorption profile at 200 °C and 450 °C correspond to weak (Lewis) and strong (Brønsted) acid sites, respectively. These peaks are typical for HZSM-5 zeolite and are in agreement with literature data [36,37]. 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) profile shows also one peak located at 200 °C, which is ascribed to physisorbed NH3, and the second one is related to strong Brønsted sites of hydroxyl groups and/or strong Lewis iron sites [58]. It is evident that the total acidity was unchanged when Fe and Mo species were incorporated to the parent HZSM-5(30) zeolite. In the case of CsNO3 addition to bimetallic zeolite, the strong Brønsted acid sites disappeared and the total acidity decreased twofold. This behavior can be explained by the basic nature of Cs and its association with BAS. HZSM-5(1500) parent zeolite shows very low acidity, which is a consequence of low aluminum content and thus low amount of acid sites. Interestingly, after Fe and Mo addition HZSM-5(1500) zeolite the total acidity increased from 0.08 to 0.53 mmolNH3/gcatalyst. This phenomenon analyzed in more detail by Pyr-DRIFT in the following paragraph. In the case of 2.5% Cs addition to the HZSM-5(1500) parent zeolite, the total acidity decreased from 0.53 to 0.03 mmolNH3/gcatalyst, which was expected due to the basic nature of Cs dopant. 3.1.7 Pyridine diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (Pyr-DRIFTS) analysis The HZSM-5(30) parent zeolite sample (Fig. 7 a) contains both LAS (0.13 mmol/g) and BAS (0.50 mmol/g), suggesting that ~20% of aluminum is present as extraframework species. Addition Fe and Mo resulted in a slight decrease of BAS, whereas LAS is slightly increased. This indicates an electrophilic (LAS) character of formed Fe(Mo)Ox species, which are likely present as positively charged, coordinatively unsaturated species. Addition of 2.5 wt% Cs decreased the number of BAS but increased the amount of LAS. The increased content of LAS can be ascribed to weak Lewis acidity of Cs+ which is also supported by the literature data [59,60]. In the HZSM-5(1500) parent zeolite sample BAS was not detected and only a small number of LAS was identified (Table 3 and Fig. 7b) indicating aluminum is present as the extra-framework AlOx phase. The addition of Fe and Mo resulted in a notable increase of LAS and BAS which is correlated also with NH3-TPD results: a similar effect was previously observed also after FeMo modification of the Al-richer HZSM-5(30) sample (Fig. 7a). By increasing Cs amount in the FeMo modified HZSM-5(1500), BAS and LAS amounts are progressively decreasing. In the samples containing 5 and 10 wt% of Cs, only LAS is present and the 19b pyridine vibrational mode shifts to lower vibrational frequency (1448 → 1440 cm−1) suggesting lower strength of the remaining Lewis acid sites [61,62]. Briefly, addition of Cs to FeMo modified zeolite reduces the amount of total acidity. At the same time, the amount of LAS was higher for trimetallic zeolites, which include Cs in comparison to the parent HZSM-5(1500) zeolite. 3.1.8 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis The chemical state and relative concentration of the components of the most active 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst was obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectra (Fig. 8 a and Table S1). The obtained analytical data was in agreement with the data base values of binding energies (BE) reported by Moulder [63]. Surface composition of the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst (about 5 nm in depth) quantified from XPS spectra are the following (Table S1): 15.4% of C; 57.8% of O; 23.1% of Si; 1.6% of Fe; 0.8% of Mo and 1.2% of Cs. Fig. 8b shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Cs3d region with revealed duplet peaks. The peak at 724.5 eV is corresponding to the Cs3d5/2 while the peak at 738.3 eV is assigned to Cs3d3/2. According to Larichev et al. [64] BE of the Cs3d5/2 at 724.5 eV corresponding to CsNO3 and Cs2O2. This observation is correlated with our recent studies of the high Cs loaded ZSM-5 catalyst by XRD analysis [11,12]. Fig. 8c presents the Fe2p3/2 peak with BE values at around 710.3 ± 0.3 eV which is attributed to Fe species mainly to Fe2O3 [39,65]. In Fig. 8d the Mo3d spectra exhibit the characteristic doublet centered at 232.6 eV (Mo3d5/2) and 235.4 eV (Mo3d3/2). These BE values are ascribed to the Mo6+ oxidation state and may be attributed to MoO3 compound which in agreement with the literature [18,66]. The O1s peak at 532.9 eV may be attributed to the oxygen in Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al [67], while the shoulder at 530 eV can be assigned to Cs-O-Si from CsNO3 and/or surface cesium peroxide Cs2O2 [60,64,68]. In Fig. 8e the Si2p spectra at 103.7 eV is ascribed with silica in zeolite structures [67]. Finally, the C1s spectra of the studied catalyst at 284.8 eV is shown in Fig. 8g. This peak may be attributed to C–C/C–H bonds and originated from the surface catalyst contamination [60,69]."
8,Catalytic evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation Fig. 9 shows the typical chromatogram of product mixture. Allyl alcohol, hydroxyacetone, 1,2-propanediol, acrolein, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acetone, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, acrylic acid, propionic acid, and 1,3-dioxan-5-ol are the principle reaction liquid products, with more than 91% of total mass. The conversion of glycerol was investigated over 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts. The most stable glycerol conversion was achieved over the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) and 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts at 97.6% and 79%, respectively after 56 h (Fig. 10 ). This phenomenon can be explained by the addition of Cs and thus, decreasing the Brønsted acid sites (BAS). This statement is supported by NH3-TPD and Pyr-DRIFT results. At the same time, it was observed for the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst the increasing of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) and the total acidity by Pyr-DRIFT analysis (Table 3) which is corresponded to weak Lewis acidity of Cs+ [59,60]. It is known [13,18,20,22] that BAS are favored coke formation and leads to catalyst deactivation and increases undesired selectivity for acrolein. Thus, the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst showed high stability in the gas-phase conversion of glycerol due to the low number of BAS, while the low allyl alcohol selectivity is related to the high total acidity in particular of LAS. For the bimetallic catalysts without Cs addition, quick deactivation was observed (from 97.7% at 27 h TOS to 45.7% and 48.3% at 51 h TOS, respectively). This indicates the important role of Cs modification and its influence on the acid-base properties and thus catalytic stability of the studied materials. The highest achieved conversion for the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst was 98.1% at 27 h on stream. In the case of the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst the maximum conversion was the same as the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst but at the time-on-stream of 23 h. Interestingly, the conversion over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst with Cs loading of 2.5 wt% is higher than that with 10 wt% Cs loading but lower over the catalyst with Cs loading of 5 wt% (Fig. 10b). Indeed, the 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst showed the lowest conversion of glycerol at 54 h. It decreased from 94.3% (TOS = 5 h) to 34.1% at 54 h. At the same time, the glycerol conversion over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst exhibited 98.1% (TOS = 23 h) with following conversion decreasing to 65.4% with TOS = 52 h. Fig. 11 a shows the allyl alcohol selectivity for the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), and 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst samples. The highest allyl alcohol selectivity was detected for the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) sample with 16.7 mol% after 24 h time-on-stream. For the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst the selectivity was 14.5 mol% within 29 h. The lowest selectivity but quite high stability was achieved over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst with 8.0 mol% within 56 h. Fig. 11b show the allyl alcohol selectivity for the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts. For these samples, the allyl alcohol selectivity was stable during the whole reaction period. The highest achieved selectivity was 52.4 mol% over 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst within 52 h. Lower Cs loading resulted in a decrease of allyl alcohol selectivity. The catalytic performance difference in the allyl alcohol selectivity after Cs loading to the bimetallic 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) and 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) can be explained by the significant difference in the number of acid and basic sites. It was detected by NH3-TPD and Pyridine-DRIFTS analyses that HZSM-5(30) zeolite support is more acidic in comparison with HZSM-5(1500) due to the difference of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. When 2.5 wt% Cs was incorporated to 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) the BET surface, mesopore surface area, and mesopore volume significantly decreased and the total basicity of 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) was much lower (1.8 µmolCO2/gcat) than for the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst (4.2 µmolCO2/gcat). At the same time, we can see the opposite effect for the total acidity, where the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst exhibited the highest value (0.70 mmol/gcat) in comparison with all studied catalysts. Thus, because of relatively low basicity and the highest acidity, the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) showed the lowest allyl alcohol selectivity (Fig. 10a). In the case of the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst the total basicity was almost in 2 times higher (3.1 µmolCO 2/gcat) and the total acidity in 2 time lower (0.42 mmol/gcat) in comparison to the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst. For the same TOS the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts showed the selectivity to allyl alcohol of 46.5 mol% and 41.7 mol%, respectively. The correlation between Cs loading and allyl alcohol selectivity can be explained by the modified ratio in acid-base properties after incorporation base metal onto the acid bimetallic zeolite catalyst. Table S2 shows comparison of allyl alcohol selectivity for all studied catalysts at the same glycerol conversion (94%). It was found correlation between catalyst performances, Cs loading and acidity (LAS, BAS and total). The 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst exhibited the highest allyl alcohol selectivity (52 mol%) in comparison with other studied catalysts. The allyl alcohol yield up to 16.6 mol% and 14.2 mol% was obtained over 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30), respectively (Fig. 11c and Table 4 ). When Cs metal was loaded to 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst the allyl alcohol yield decreased to 7.8 mol% but was more stable than the 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) and 2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) samples. Fig. 11d and Table 4 show the allyl alcohol yield over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts. The highest allyl alcohol yield achieved was 48.8 mol% over 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) with TOS = 6 h. The most stable allyl alcohol yield was 45.2 mol% over 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) within 26 h. These results exhibit that the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst sample is more active and stable in the gas-phase glycerol conversion into allyl alcohol compared to the catalysts known from the literature data (Table 4). Fig. 12 and Fig. S3 show the selectivity distribution and conversion of the principal products over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) and 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts. As is shown in Fig. 12, acrolein was the main product over 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) catalyst. The maximum selectivity was 53.6 mol% and conversion was more than 92.1% (Fig. S3) which supports the fact that strong Brønsted acid sites have the major influence on acrolein formation [70]. Allyl alcohol and hydroxyacetone were the main byproducts. For the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst sample, the main product was allyl alcohol, followed by hydroxyacetone, acrolein, and 1,2-propanediol. Fig. 12 and Fig. S4 present the comparison of the selectivity distribution and conversion of the principal products over 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts. For both catalysts the main product observed was allyl alcohol but the glycerol conversion was decreased faster over 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst from 93.7% to 76.0% within 7 h (Fig. S4). Hydroxyacetone, acrolein, and 1,2-propanediol were the main byproducts for both catalyst samples. Thus, the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst shows promising results in the reaction of glycerol conversion into allyl alcohol. This achieved performance can be explained by the appearance of the basic sites, suitable balance between acidity-basicity of the studied catalyst and high mesopore surface area and volume. Reaction pathway of catalytic allyl alcohol formation, as well as all other identified reaction products is proposed in Scheme 3 . The reaction pathway for glycerol conversion into allyl alcohol is a sequence of consecutive and/or parallel dehydration, dehydrogenation, oxidation, transfer hydrogenation reactions and radical decomposition with the participation of acid, base, and redox sites [30]. Over CsFeMo trimetallic HZSM-5 based catalysts, we have succeeded in conversion of glycerol into allyl alcohol as the main reaction product. Hydroxyacetone, acrolein, 1,2-propanediol, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, ethanol, 1,3-dioxan-5-ol, formaldehyde, methanol, acrylic acid, propionaldehyde, and propionic acid were the remaining identified byproducts. Based on the literature data [23,71] we can speculate that allyl alcohol was obtained directly from glycerol over basic sites of CsFeMo-ZSM-5 catalyst through the dehydration and transfer hydrogenation mechanism. There are several possible hydrogen sources of hydrogen in the system, as was confirmed previously, such as glycerol [13,20] and other hydroxyl group containing reaction products, as well as water (10 wt% glycerol and 90 wt% water in the feed stream), the latter probably through the aqueous phase reforming route [71]. At the same time, the hydroxyacetone and acrolein production proceeded on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively. It was found that these both reactions were suppressed due to the addition of Cs to FeMo-ZSM-5(1500). The induction period of 5 h is required for all catalysts in order to reach ˃90% glycerol conversion. Considering the large variance in their number and type of acidic sites, and the fact that according to Scheme 3, dehydration is the universal initial reaction step, this phenomenon is likely related to establishing of flow and hydrothermal conditions inside the catalytic layer. Additional reason of the existence of an induction period can be a modification of the catalyst surface (acid-base property) by steam (water) from the reaction feed (10 wt% aqueous glycerol solution), which is also supported by the literature data [72,73]. The high (˃90%) glycerol conversion is maintained for about 20 h (except for 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(30) which does not deactivate and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mi-ZSM-5(1500) which starts to deactivate rapidly already at 8 h TOS). The product selectivities (Fig. 11a-b and Fig. 12) are much less time-dependent than glycerol conversions, indicating negligible change in the nature of active sites, but rather a decrease in the active site abundance. This could be related to pore blocking by the carbonaceous deposits, since many of the identified reaction products are highly reactive under the employed reaction conditions. It is known [13,18,20,22] that the surface acid sites are responsible for the glycerol dehydration reaction and necessary for the first reaction step of allyl alcohol formation. At the same time, the strong acid sites favor coke formation and increases undesired selectivity for acrolein. Thus, the studied catalysts with different total acidity lead to the diverse catalytic activity in the gas-phase reaction of glycerol conversion into allyl alcohol. The selectivity of identified dehydration products hydroxyacetone and acrolein were correlated with different acid site types (LAS or BAS) and total acidity (Fig. 13 ). A relatively good correlations for acrolein, hydroxyacetone could be found for both LAS and BAS, indicating these are predominantly active for the dehydration reaction. On the other hand, the situation with 1,2-propanediol and allyl alcohol selectivity is more complex. It scales inversely with BAS abundance. This suggests the Cs modification of the FeMoZSM-5 catalysts attenuates the total number of BAS, thus decreasing the dehydration reaction rates, giving more time for the hydrogen transfer reaction to proceed, thus favoring the 1,2-propanediol and allyl alcohol selectivity. In addition, the highest allyl alcohol yield was observed (Fig. 14 ) over trimetallic ZSM-5 catalysts, which according to Pyridine DRIFTS analysis have no BAS and the lowest total acidity, suggesting the existence of a parallel reaction pathway. This would also explain the intermediate allyl alcohol yields observed over catalysts that exhibit no intrinsic Brønsted acidity. Thus, the present work shows that dehydration of glycerol proceeds on acid sites of catalysts while the allyl alcohol formation is realized through the direct glycerol dehydration and hydrogen transfer mechanism over basic sites of the CsFeMo-ZSM-5(1500) catalyst."
9,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted for the spent catalyst samples during catalytic tests after 50–77 h TOS. The onset of weight loss was observed in the temperature range from 80 to 120 °C (Fig. 15 ). This weight decreasing in the low-temperature region can be attributed to the desorption of physisorbed water and volatile organic species which is in line with literature reports [74,75]. For the 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500), 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) samples (Fig. 15b, Table 5 ), the weight loss was initiated at 260–310 °C, which is due to the presence of carbonaceous deposits. In the case of the 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30), 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) and 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30) catalysts the weight loss was observed at 330 °C. Interestingly, the gasification of carbonaceous deposits in HZSM-5(30) based catalysts exhibiting the higher amount of acid sites (Table 5) is brought to completion at higher temperatures (~600 °C) in comparison to HZSM-5(1500) based samples containing Cs. This would suggest a more oxidation-resistant nature of carbon formed during acid sites. At the same time, the initial carbonaceous decomposition occurs over HZSM-5(1500) supported catalysts at lower temperatures. Fig. 15b shows that the largest amount of deposited coke was 14.3 wt% over 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalyst which can be explained by the highest TOS in comparison to other studied samples. 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(30) sample has coke deposition of 12.1 wt% within 50 h due to the highest amount of Brønsted acid sites, which are responsible for coke formation. This statement is supported by NH3-TPD and Pyr-DRIFTS analyses. 2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500), 2.5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500), and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) catalysts show increasing deposition resistance which can be attributed to the low amount of Brønsted acid sites or their total disappearance due to the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and Cs base metal addition. Moreover, we have regenerated based on the literature data [11,12] the most active 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) spent catalyst in the air at 550 °C for 6 h. After the regeneration process, the 5Cs2.5Fe2.5MoZSM-5(1500) (fresh and regenerated) catalysts were characterized by XRD analysis. The XRD patterns showed (Fig. S5) no differences in the MFI framework between fresh and regenerated catalysts which proves its ability to preserve the crystal structure and catalytic activity after the regeneration process."
10,Conclusions,"The catalytic reaction of glycerol conversion into allyl alcohol was carried out in the gas-phase packed-bed continuous flow reactor at 350 °C over FeMo and CsFeMo promoted zeolite HZSM-5(30) and HZSM-5(1500) catalysts. XRD analysis could not confirm presence of crystalline phases related to Cs, Fe and Mo promotors. TEM-EDX analysis revealed that Cs and Mo are finely dispersed and probably associated with Brønsted acidic sites, whereas iron forms surface patches of aggregated FeOx phase. Progressive Cs addition causes a continuous rise of surface basic sites, as probed by CO2-TPD, yet their number is about 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to the total number of acidic sites. Cs addition also causes the attenuation of BAS and LAS, as probed by pyridine DRIFT spectroscopy. The 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) and 10Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) catalysts showed promising stability and catalytic performance such as 98.1 mol% and 93.8 mol% conversion of glycerol with 46.1 mol% and 52.0 mol% selectivity to allyl alcohol, respectively. The most stable yield (45.2 mol%) was achieved over 5Cs2.5Fe2.5Mo-ZSM-5(1500) which is a benchmark that still has to be surpassed in the published literature. The key parameters to the high yield for the desired allyl alcohol production are the basic sites, suitable balance between acidic-basic sites of the synthesized catalyst, high mesopore surface area and volume. The reaction pathway based on the direct glycerol dehydration and transfer hydrogenation is proposed. The further optimization of metals loading and operating conditions is necessary in order to improve catalyst stability and activity."
