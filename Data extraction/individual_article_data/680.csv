0,Introduction,"The growth in population together with the increased need for energy, chemicals and pharmaceuticals are the main drives towards a bio-based economy [1]. The shift away from non-renewable petroleum and natural gas resources has a significant impact on the chemical industry’s reliant on them [2]. As a result, the development of novel catalytic processes is crucial to transform raw bio-based resources into sustainable fuels and chemicals. One of the biomass-derived platform chemicals identified by the U.S. Department of Energy is furfural [3], a molecule of crucial interest from the pyrolysis of hemicellulose components in lignocellulosic biomass waste [4–7], where ∼62 % of its global consumption is selectively hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol [8]. Furfuryl alcohol is a transient molecule used to synthesise ascorbic acid and anti-corrosive coatings but primarily for furan based resins [9,10]. Over the past 90 years, current industrial processes for the selective hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol have used copper chromite catalysts [9,11–13] operating energy-intensive conditions of 200 °C, and hydrogen pressures up to 30 bar [2]. However, such chromite-based catalysts over time deteriorate and release chromic oxide, a highly toxic compound that causes severe environmental problems and contamination of the resulting products. Therefore, there is motivation to develop an environmentally friendly, energy-efficient catalytic materials which adapt to milder reaction conditions. Many alternatives to the currently utilised chromite-based catalysts have been investigated in the literature for the hydrogenation of furfural including Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Co and Mo [2,6,14–30]. In most cases, only the surface atoms of the nanoparticle are the active sites, while those in the nanoparticle bulk are spectators. For example, in a 5 nm particle, only about 22 % of the atoms are available for catalysis, leading to an inefficient use of precious metals. However, when more abundant elements (e.g. Cu) are used, they often require harsher conditions such as temperature/pressure or augmenting their catalytic activity with precious metals [6]. A method of improving atom efficiency is to increase the dispersity of catalysts up to the atomic limit. This is where single-atom catalysis exists, blurring the lines between traditional heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis [31]. Several studies have been reported whether a single atom attached to the support would work as an efficient catalyst for various catalytic processes [32–34] such as the water-gas shift reaction. Flytzani-Stephanopolous et al. [35] found that single atoms of Au, present as surface Au-Ox species could be used for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction. During this investigation, the authors found no evidence of Au nanoparticles taking part as the active species. Various other studies have investigated single-atom catalysts (SAC) both theoretically and experimentally looking for new preparation methods and catalytic/redox processes [36–41]. Additionally, various Pd ensemble sizes have also been studied previously ranging from nanoparticles to clusters to single atoms which were used for the transformation of aldehydes [42,43]. Typically, introducing high Pd content on the host metal surface leads to a distribution of Pd ensembles, in which single Pd atoms coexist with dimers, trimers, and even higher Pd clusters [44]. Advantages of single atoms include incredible activity [45] with chemoselectivity towards the desired products (for example, hydrogenation of nitroarenes) due to their isolated active sites. As one can expect, there is better active site control compared to a nanoparticle where there are different surface planes each exhibiting different electronic and chemical environments and thus leading to different reactivities. A subclass of SACs supported on typically a base metal such as copper were reported initially by Kyriakou et al. [44]. Here, Pd atoms were deposited on a Cu (111) surface under Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) conditions, where they observed stable isolated Pd species via Low Temperature-Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (LT-STM), naming the structure a single-atom alloy (SAA). Various DFT studies also supported their findings that the isolated Pd atoms present can act as entry and exit sites for hydrogen dissociation and recombination with the reported activation energy falling from 0.4 eV (Cu 111) to ∼0.02 eV with the SAA [39,44,46,47]. These fundamental experiments in UHV led to the development of practical SAA catalysts used in various catalytic reactions [38,41,48,49]. In an earlier investigation we reported the use of a range of supported PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles including Ultra Dilute Alloy (UDA) for the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of furfural. In the case of UDAs alloying was achieved by the galvanic replacement of Cu atoms by Pt atoms on host Cu nanoparticles. In the case of UDA catalysts, despite the very low content of Pt (atomic ratio between Pt:Cu ∼ 1:20), displayed minimal clustering of Pt on the surface of the nanoparticle and were found to exhibits exceptionally high initial rates of hydrogenation rivalling the catalytic turnover of the monometallic Pt nanoparticles. The present work investigates the development of atom efficient PdCu SAA catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid phase. In this case the Pd content in the nanoparticle is minimised to the extent that Pd exists as single atomic entities on the Cu host nanoparticle. We have used copper as the host nanoparticle since it is well known that these catalysts are very selective due to the η1(O)-aldehyde binding mode [50,51] of furfural to the surface promoting C = O hydrogenation. As the result of hydrogen dissociation being an activated process on Cu surfaces, the isolated Pd atoms enhance hydrogen dissociation spillover onto the copper surface, increasing the activity of the catalyst. Experiments will also be conducted to optimise the catalytic behaviour by adjusting synthetic parameters. Due to the lack of experimental studies on whether the isolated surface Pd atoms can sink into the nanoparticle, XAS experiments will be used to give insight into this. While various combinations of non-toxic catalysts have previously been investigated, including PdCu [52], the implementation of single palladium atoms at trace amounts on copper host nanoparticles provides advancements in sustainability, efficiency and reactivity for the hydrogenation of furfural."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Colloidal Cu nanoparticles were synthesised using a method reported earlier by Kanzaki et al. [53]. DL-1-Amino-2-propanol (AmIP, 2.93 mL, 99.9 %, Acros Organics) was added to 7.73 mL of ethylene glycol. Cu (II) acetate (0.6811 g, 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to the mixture, forming a dark-blue solution after ultra-sonication. Once the Cu (II) acetate was dissolved, hydrazine monohydrate (1.83 mL, 98 %, Alfa Aesar) was added under vigorous stirring (1100 RPM) and was left to react for ∼24 h at room-temperature. The Cu nanoparticle mixture was then precipitated out by adding it to 25 mL of N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 99 %, Acros Organics) under gentle stirring. The copper nanoparticles were collected via centrifugation and then purified using 25 mL of DMA, toluene (HPLC grade, Fisher Chemical) and hexane (HPLC grade, Fisher Chemical). The resulting nanoparticles were then suspended in 10 mL of ethanol (HPLC grade, Fisher Chemical) by sonication. Al2O3 (9.9 g, 99.5 %, 32-40 m2 g−1, NanoArc, Alfa Aesar) was then impregnated with the nanoparticle solution (6.6 mL) after the support was mixed with 60 mL of ethanol. The ethanol was then evaporated at room temperature. Finally, the resulting solid was calcined at 300 °C (5 °C/min) for 4 h in a muffle furnace to remove residual synthetic components and reduced at 245 °C (5 °C/min) for 3 h under flowing H2 (40 mL/min). Supported Pd nanoparticles on Al2O3 were synthesised using a method previously reported for Pt nanoparticles [6,54]. Briefly, 10 mL of ethylene glycol and 50 μL of aqueous NaOH (1 M) was refluxed at 120 °C. To the hot ethylene glycol, a solution of Na2PdCl4 (10.6 mM, 99.99 %, Sigma Aldrich) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (91 mM, 40,000 MW, Alfa Aesar) in a 9:1 per volume of ethylene glycol:water was added slowly over the course of an hour. The mixture turned black and was stirred for an additional 20 min. and cooled to room temperature. The nanoparticles were then isolated and cleaned with multiple acetone washes and centrifugation, the resulting solid residue was dispersed in EtOH. The support (Al2O3, NanoArc™) was impregnated with the nanoparticle suspension and dried overnight. Finally, the Pd rich catalyst, Pd100/Al2O3, was calcined at 300 °C (5 °C/min) for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The PdCu single atom alloy catalysts were synthesised using galvanic replacement (GR) [6,38]. The Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was initially reduced in situ at 245 °C under flowing H2 for 3 h in a round-bottom flask. The vessel was then cooled to room temperature under flowing H2. The flask was then purged with N2 and heated to 100 °C, followed by the addition of deionised water (18 mL) and stirring at 700 RPM. The desired amount of Pd (II) nitrate hydrate (99.9 %, Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in an aqueous 2 mM HCl solution and 2 mL of this solution was added to the reduced Cu/Al2O3 mixture and allowed to react/reflux for 20 min under an N2 atmosphere. Specifically, 0.28 mg, 0.53 mg and 1.38 mg of Pd nitrate (II) hydrate was added to the reduced host Cu/Al2O3 (1 g) mixture to make the Pd1Cu234, Pd1Cu216 and Pd1Cu53 catalysts, respectively. The subsequent mixture was cooled to room temperature where the catalysts were washed with deionised water (300 mL) and dried under vacuo followed by further drying in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The monometallic Cu/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were denoted Cu100 and Pd100, respectively. While the bimetallic catalysts were denoted Pd1Cun where n indicates the proportion of Cu atoms per Pd atom present. The calcination temperature was chosen based on previous works with carbonous capping agents [2]. An initial lower reduction temperature (245 °C) for the Cu catalyst was chosen for an extended duration of 3 h as it was reported to be suitable for the subsequent Pd galvanic replacement [41]. It should be noted before catalytic tests all the catalysts were in-situ reduced at 300 °C, to ensure the metallic phases are present."
3,Material characterisation,"2.2 Material characterisation Samples were analysed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using a Cs aberration-corrected JEOL 2100 F microscope at 200 kV. Images were collected using a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 digital camera operated by Digital Micrograph software. Samples were dispersed in methanol (HPLC grade, Fisher Chemical) and deposited on 300-mesh carbon-supported copper grids and dried at 60 °C. ImageJ 1.52a software was used for image analysis. TEM images were also recorded on a JEOL, JEM-2100 high-resolution system (HR-TEM). Metal contents were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7400 Duo in both axial (increases sensitivity at low concentrations) and radial mode for Pd and Cu content, respectively. To prepare the samples for ICP-OES analysis, 3 mL HCl (37 %, VWR Chemicals), 1 mL HNO3 (68 %, VWR Chemicals) and 5 mL H2SO4 (>95 %, Fisher Scientific) were added to ∼10 mg of the catalyst. The mixture was then heated to 250 °C for 1 h to ensure the complete dissolution of Al2O3. After cooling to room temperature, the digestate was topped to 10 mL with distilled water to account for any evaporation losses. Surface area of the support was analysed via N2 physisorption using a Quantachrome Nova 4000 instrument, after sample outgassing at 120 °C for 2 h before analysis at –196 °C. Surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method over the range P/P0 = 0.03–0.18, where a linear relationship was maintained. H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) data was collected on a Quantachrome ChemBET Pulsar equipped with a TCD detector (150 mA). The catalyst (∼100 mg) was loaded into a quartz wool plugged u-shaped glass tube and degassed/dried under N2 flow at 100 °C for 30 min. TPR analysis was subsequently conducted under 5%H2/95 % N2 (40 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 6 °C min−1 to 300 °C. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC1 Star System under a N2 purge gas (60 mL min−1) interfaced to a ThermoStar TM GSD 301 T3 mass spectrometer. The colloidally capped Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (20 mg) was loaded into alumina crucible and heated from 40 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 and the dead time between the TGA and MS was assumed to be negligible. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray excited Auger spectroscopy (XAES) spectra were acquired on a Kratos AXIS Supra spectrometer equipped with a charge neutraliser and monochromated Al Kα excitation source (1486.7 eV) with energies referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV using CasaXPS version 2.3.19PR1.0 and a U 2 Tougaard background. The modified auger parameter α’ was defined as the sum of the photoelectron binding energy and the auger electron kinetic energy [55]. The extra-atomic relaxation energy was defined as half the change in the modified auger parameter compared to bulk Cu [56]. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance Bragg–Brentano diffractometer equipped with a Lynxeye PSD detector and with Cu Kα1,2 radiation (40 kV and 40 mA, 0.2 mm Ni Kβ absorber, 2.5 ° Soller Slits, 10 − 80 ° 2θ range, a virtual step scan of 0.02 ° 2θ, virtual time per step of 8 s). The arithmetic mean domain size of the nanoparticles was determined via the Whole Powder Pattern Modelling (WPPM) method [57,58], utilising the PM2K software [59] and described in our previous work [22]. The complex background was partially removed using OriginPro and then synthesised using a Chebyshev polynomial. The crystalline domains were assumed to be spherical and distributed according to a log-normal size distribution. The volume-weighted crystallite size was estimated with the integral breadth method (see supplementary information). X-ray absorption spectra were collected at B18 XAS beamline at Diamond Light Source, United Kingdom. A double-crystal Si(311) monochromator was used to scan X-ray energy from –200 to 800 eV relative to the Pd K-edge (24,350 eV). Following ex situ reduction, samples were loaded into 3 mm capillaries and the XAS measurement was conducted in fluorescence mode (multi-element Ge detector at 45 ° to the sample) with five scans. Pseudo-in situ XAS was conducted using a gas-tight cell with aluminised Kapton windows; the catalysts were pelletised and reduced in 5%H2/95 %He at 300 °C, and transferred into the cell without exposing the catalysts to atmospheric oxygen in an N2 filled glove box. Spectra of 35 scans were collected in fluorescence mode. XAS data were analysed with Athena and Artemis, FEFF6 code [60], the accompanying reference spectra were calibrated to 24,350 eV via the 2nd derivation method, aligned and merged before analysis. FEFF scattering paths were calculated using Cu and CuO CIF files, and with the absorber replaced with Pd. Samples denoted re-oxidised and reduced were analysed ex situ using a capillary and a gas-tight pellet cell, respectively."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing In situ reduction and all catalytic reactions were carried out in a Hel DigiCAT high-pressure parallel reactor system, housing a bank of two 50 mL stainless steel reactor vessels. The reaction conditions used in this work were similar to those used in earlier studies in the literature [2,6,22] and provide a benchmark to compare the catalytic activity and make correlations with the nanoparticle structure, catalyst composition and recyclability. The vessels were loaded with ∼30 mg of the catalyst, heated under flowing H2 to 300 °C at 5 °C min−1 and held for 0.5 h before cooling to room temperature under flowing H2. The autoclaves were subsequently sealed and purged with H2 to prevent the oxidation of the catalyst. While H2 was flowing, 10 mL of the reaction mixture comprising of methanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.99 %), furfural (0.02 M, Sigma Aldrich, 99 %) and butanol as the internal standard (0.02 M, Alfa Aesar, 99 %), were injected into each reactor. The weight percent of the catalyst, reactant, internal standard and solvent at the starting point were 0.38 %, 0.24 %, 0.18 % and 99.20 %, respectively. The mixture was degassed for 10 min before pressurising under H2 (1.5 bar, BOC, 99.995 %), followed by heating to 50 °C and stirring at 600 rpm. The reactions were all carried out for 7 h at 50 °C before being cooled and depressurised to atmospheric pressure. The external mass transfer was assessed by changing the stirring speed from 600 to 900 rpm and no appreciable differences were detected within this range. The internal mass transfer was considered negligible as the catalyst is in non-porous and in powder form (40 nm), which means that all the active sites are accessible in the external surface of the support. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (0.2 mL) were periodically taken and analysed with 1:10 dilution in methanol on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a Zebron ZB-WAX capillary column (5%-phenyl-95 %-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m ×0.53 mm ×1.50 μm). The concentration of the products was determined through the normalisation of the individual peak areas with the internal standard, as well as the use of 5-point calibration standards of the pure compounds. Reaction mixtures were further analysed by GCMS on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 SE."

6,Characterisation of alumina supported catalysts,"3.1 Characterisation of alumina supported catalysts 3.1.1 Elemental, surface area, particle size and TGA-MS analysis Bulk elemental analysis of the catalytic materials (Table 1 ) shows that the Cu and Pd monometallic catalysts with an approximate loading of 1 wt% were successfully synthesised. Bimetallic PdCu/Al2O3 catalysts show trace quantities of Pd being incorporated into the monometallic host Cu/Al2O3 catalyst giving Pd:Cu atomic ratios of 1:234, 1:216 and 1:53. In Fig. S1 a type II isotherm was observed for the bare support with a surface area of 38.2 m2 g−1 showing that the support material is non-porous. The TGA-MS of the 1-amino-2-propanol (C3H9NO) capped Cu nanoparticles showed it mainly decomposed into NO, and CO2 under N2 flow (Fig. S2). 3.1.2 H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) The H2-TPR profile shown in Fig. 1 (a) of the Pd100 catalyst shows that Pd can reduce at room temperature under flowing H2, which has also been reported earlier [14]. The Pd100 catalyst shows a sharp negative peak at 94 °C. The physical meaning of the negative peak indicates H2 is being released from the sample while a positive peak is H2 consumption detected via changes in the thermal conductivity of the gas [14,61–63]. However, this negative decomposition peak is not observed for the SAA catalysts which suggests that such features are below the detection limit (trace Pd loading) and possibly due to the hydride species needing extended Pd surfaces to form [64]. TPR profiles also show that the Tmax for reduction (positive peaks) of the catalysts is observed to decrease with increasing Pd loading. It is also worth noting that for SAA catalysts the hydrogen consumption starts at a relatively lower temperature for the Pd1Cu53 (80 °C) compared to the Pd1Cu216 catalyst (100 °C). Similarly, the beginning of H2 consumption in the case of Pd1Cu234 (120 °C) is lower compared to Pd1Cu216 (100 °C). This shows a strong dependency between the Pd content of the surface and temperature at which the SAA starts to consume hydrogen. The higher the concentration of single Pd entities on the Cu surface allows for easier hydrogen adsorption and spillover onto the Cu surface [44,47]. 3.1.3 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and selected area Electron diffraction (SAED) Fig. 1 (b) shows ex situ XRD diffractograms of the catalytic materials after reduction at 300 °C for 0.5 h. The diffractograms show broad but discernible reflections characteristic of nano-crystalline γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS card No. 29-0063) and δ-Al2O3 (JCPDS card No. 46-1215), and a small impurity arising from the θ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS card No. 11-0517). A quantitative examination of the diffractograms shows that the lattice parameters of the alumina phases remain unaltered (Table S1), suggesting that the copper/palladium phase onto the alumina did not significantly affect the overall morphology of the support. The spots forming rings observed in the SAED images of the catalysts (Fig. S3) suggest the support is largely polycrystalline, as amorphous materials will form more noticeable diffused rings. It should be noted that only spots relating to the γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3 could be distinguished. Examining the diffractograms, the host Cu100/Al2O3 catalyst did not show any diffraction peaks arising from the Cu phase, inferring that the Cu nanoparticles are very small, and/or lacking long-range order, leading to very broad diffraction peaks. In contrast, after galvanic replacement of the Cu with Pd atoms (PdCu catalysts), a broad Cu (111) reflection is observed at 43.4 °, with an estimated lattice parameter of 3.623 Å (Table S1). The appearance of the Cu (111) reflection after Pd is incorporated can be attributed to the effect of the galvanic replacement (GR) process in the increase of the order of the Cu nanoparticles in such a way that it is detectable. This effect has been reported earlier [65], suggesting that the GR process can cause the Cu ions produced directly from GR or nanoparticle dissolution to be reduced again onto the Cu nanoparticle. Thus, increasing Cu’s apparent crystallinity. On the other hand, increasing the Pd loading in the catalysts did not show any significant changes in the lattice parameters, and the absence of any Pd reflections suggests the Pd atoms have been incorporated into the Cu phase without forming detectable Pd ensembles or identifiable changes in the Cu structure. As another benchmark catalyst, the monometallic Pd100/Al2O3 catalyst showed Pd reflections consistent with that of an FCC Pd crystal structure (JCPDS card No. 05-068). In the diffractograms, Pd (29.5 ° for PdO, JCPDS 41–1107) and Cu oxides (36.4 ° and 38.8 ° for Cu2O, 05–0667 and CuO, JCPDS 45−0937, respectively) were not detected, implying the nanoparticles are predominately in their metallic state with an amorphous oxide passivation layer. 3.1.4 Scanning and transmission Electron microscopy (STEM/TEM) Investigation of the Cu100 catalyst with STEM showed the presence of very small Cu nanoparticles with an average size of 2.7 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 2 a, Fig. S4). This is in stark contrast to our previous studies [22] where a wet impregnation synthesis gave rise to isolated and dimer copper atoms embedded onto Al2O3 surface. Therefore, wet impregnation typically gave a range of nanostructures, while the colloidal synthesis formed monodisperse nanoparticles ideal for understanding the formation of single-atom alloy catalysts. Nevertheless, incorporation of low levels of Pd atoms via galvanic replacement (Pd1Cu234 and Pd1Cu216 catalysts) causes an insignificant difference in the nanoparticle size (Fig. 2f and Table 1). Once the Pd concentration was quadrupled (Pd1Cu53 catalyst), the nanoparticles appear to grow in size to 7.0 ± 4.4 nm (Fig. 2d). Particle sizes using STEM and assuming particles are monocrystalline were compared to the integral breath and WPPM methods determined via XRD (Table 1). Particle size analysis from simple line profile analysis (integral breath method and the Scherrer equation) differed from the values obtained with the WPPM calculation and STEM data. This can be explained as a volume-weighted crystallite size average is determined using the integral method, which can overestimate crystallite size by rogue larger particles. In contrast, values calculated using the WPPM method give an area-weighted average which is influenced less by large particles. WPPM and STEM results support our observation that Cu particle size increase with a large increase Pd concentration, which is hypothesised to be attributed to the reduction of Cu ions onto the existing nanoparticles [65]. TEM images of the benchmark Pd100 catalyst (Fig. 2e) synthesised colloidally show that the average nanoparticle size is 5.1 nm ± 2.7 nm with the presence of larger 10 nm particles supporting the dissimilarity between the TEM and XRD particle sizes. 3.1.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray excited auger spectroscopy (XAES) Fig. 3 a shows X-ray photoelectron spectra of the ex situ reduced catalysts along with the reference spectra of Cu, CuO, Cu2O, Pd and PdO. The characteristic Cu 2p doublet is observed with the Cu 2p3/2 transition centred at 932.8 eV (Table S2). The absence of strong shake-up satellites at 942.6 eV and 962.3 eV, shows the absence of Cu2+ species so, the Cu is largely in its Cu0 or Cu+ oxidation state due exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Minimal differences in the Cu 2p3/2 transition are observed between the catalysts. It should also be noted that the binding energies of Cu+ and Cu0 are very similar, making deconvolution problematic. With this in mind, the composition the Cu species were determined according to the Cu 2p3/2 and satellite peaks [66–68]. Surface compositional analysis (Table S2) shows 1–3 % Cu2+ in the SAA catalysts with the Cu species being largely in the Cu0 or Cu+ state. The Cu L3VV Auger transitions of the catalysts are found to be attenuated and significantly shifted to lower kinetic energies compared to the Cu2O reference. Such observations in the shifts in the Auger transitions and the modified Auger parameter, α’ are not without precedent for supported catalysts [22,61,69]. The modified Auger parameter is dependent on both initial and final state effects, providing an estimate of the relaxation/screening energies due to the presence of core-holes [70], while being independent of sample charging and energy calibration problems [71]. It is observed that the α’ of the Cu100 catalyst to be 1847.4 eV, which is drastically lower than bulk Cu (α’bulk = 1851.4 eV). The shift is attributed largely to the polarizability of the support [72] which can withdraw electrons from the Cu nanoparticles; reducing the ability of the Cu atoms to screen the core-hole after photoemission. It is reported that the Cu atoms in a PdCu bimetallic systems can act as electron donors to Pd atoms [73], whereby a further decrease in screening efficiency of the conduction electrons is observed by the decrease in α’ with Pd introduction. Theoretically, the heterometallic Cu-Pd bond is formed by charge loss in Cu(4sp) and, to a lesser degree, Pd(4d) bands, with a rise in the population of Pd(5sp) but no change in the occupancy of the Cu(3d) band. As a result, the electronic configuration of the alloy cannot be viewed as a mere superposition of pure metals [74]. The spectra in Fig. 3 suggest the surface oxide is most likely comprised of Cu2O for the catalysts due to the surface composition analysis and the shift in the Cu L3VV transition. The Pd 3d5/2 transition of the monometallic benchmark Pd100/Al2O3 is found at 335.1 eV consistent with that of bulk metallic Pd (335.2 eV, Table S2). In addition, PdO could not be detected/deconvoluted via fitting suggesting the Pd present is in its metallic state. A severely attenuated Pd 3d5/2 transition centred at 335.3 eV is observed for the Pd1Cu53 catalyst due to the trace concentration of Pd. The slight observed shift compared to Pd100 catalyst correlates well with earlier literature [41,75] due to the Pd-O-Cu interaction on the surface after the passivation of the Cu nanoparticles. A further shift of 0.19 eV with the lower Pd loaded Pd1Cu216 catalyst compared to the Pd1Cu53 catalyst suggests the Pd atoms have a greater O-Cu interaction suggesting a larger ratio of Pd surface atoms compared to atoms sinking into the bulk. Fig. S5 shows the XPS derived dispersion calculations and, as mentioned earlier, it can give an insight into the location of the Cu and Pd atoms present in the catalysts. For the monometallic Cu100 catalyst, a dispersion value of 71.0 ± 7.1 % is determined which equates to a spherical nanoparticle size of ⁓1.5 nm (Fig. S6). The lower equivalent nanoparticle size can be attributed to the fact that XPS can detect Cu atoms irrespective of them being present in small nanoparticles or large nanoparticles while with STEM/TEM it is difficult to distinguish very small particles from the support because of the Z-contrast. As observed in the STEM/TEM and XRD data the low replacement levels of Cu atoms with Pd atoms appear not to decrease the dispersion of the Cu phase. However, with significantly higher Pd loading (Pd1Cu53 catalyst) the dispersion slightly decreases. The significantly increased Pd dispersion of the Pd1Cu216 catalyst supports the idea mentioned earlier related to the positive shift of the Pd 3d5/2 transition of the Pd1Cu216 compared to the Pd1Cu53 catalyst, which was linked to an increased proportion of the Pd atoms sunk into the bulk of the nanoparticle for the latter. 3.1.6 X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Pseudo-in situ and ex situ EXAFS (Figs. 4 and 5 ) suggest that Pd atoms have successfully galvanically replaced the Cu atoms on the nanoparticles while remaining atomically dispersed, confirming the formation of the single-atom catalysts. The tabulated (Table 2 ) first shell Pd-Cu bond lengths for the reduced Pd1Cu53 and Pd1Cu216 catalysts were found to be 2.562 ± 0.011 Å and 2.551 ± 0.015 Å, which coincides with a Cu-Cu bond (2.551 ± 0.054 Å). The Pd atoms determined to be missing Pd-Pd (2.742 Å, Pd metal) and bulk alloyed Pd-Cu (2.63 Å, Cu3Pd) coordination supporting theoretical calculations [39] that Pd can form a stable single-atom catalyst on Cu (111) surfaces. In addition, the sinusoidal waveform of the EXAFS in k-space (Fig. 4a) is consistent with the absence of multiple different scattering species in the measured local coordination environment [76]. Coordination numbers of the Pd-Cu shell were found to be 5.4 ± 0.8 (Pd1Cu53) and 3.7 ± 0.9 (Pd1Cu216), much lower than the typical FCC bulk and surface (111) coordination numbers of 12 and 9. This suggests the Pd atoms are incorporated on/near the surface in very small nanoparticles with dangling bonds. The Pd1Cu53 catalyst has 340 % more Pd compared to the Pd1Cu216. This extra Pd is accommodated throughout the nanoparticle, and therefore, significant portion of it is populating the bulk of the nanoparticle. This statement is further supported by the difference in coordination numbers of Pd as seen in Table 2. Pei et al. [48] also reported Pd-Cu bond length and coordination of 2.58 Å and 11.6 respectively for a PdCu SAA synthesised via co-impregnation. However, co-impregnation distributes Pd atoms throughout the nanoparticle while galvanic replacement selectively replaces surface atoms explaining the difference in coordination numbers since in one case Pd atoms are distributed homogeneously and the other heterogeneously. Typically, EXAFS alone does not provide insight on whether the Pd atoms are on the surface or in the bulk since the technique gives the average local environment across the whole sample. Any attempts to determine such information will usually result in the use of highly correlated parameters producing unreliable results. The presence of Pd surface atoms is important for the increasing the hydrogen dissociation capability of the catalyst [39,44,46,47]. In-situ FTIR methods exist [77] utilising CO as a surface probe molecule, but such experiments rely on an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. In this method it is crucial to determine whether the absence of bridged CO vibrational modes is due to the presence of single atoms or the lack of signal caused by the trace loading of the dopant. DFT calculations suggest Pd and Pt are stable on a Cu surface due to their relatively lower surface energies and higher deformation energies [39]. To examine this experimentally, the samples were reduced and re-oxidised at room temperature by exposing them to atmospheric oxygen. Selectively altering the surface Pd atoms with oxidation allows to easily differentiate surface Pd species from any Pd diffused into the bulk which will be largely unaffected. Pd-O coordination is observed in the Pd1Cu216 catalyst with a reduction in the Pd-Cu coordination from 3.7 to 2.5 suggesting a significant portion of the Pd atoms remain on the surface via selective oxidation. In contrast, the Pd1Cu53 catalysts seem to be largely unaffected by the surface oxidation (a slight drop in Pd-Cu coordination of 0.2), suggesting a significant portion of the atoms have diffused below the topmost layer of the nanoparticle, supported by our XPS findings. We propose this phenomenon is due to the increased population of the Cu surface with Pd atoms promoting diffusion into the bulk. It should be noted also that this method is not entirely ideal, as in actual reaction conditions adsorbed hydrogen can stabilise surface Pd atoms bringing more atoms up to the surface [39,78,79]. The Pd-O bond length of the Pd1Cu216 catalyst was found to be 2.003 ± 0.044 Å, which is reminiscent of bulk PdO (2.01 Å). This indicates the surface Pd atoms can distort the Cu oxidised phase, as the Cu-O bond lengths are 1.88 Å and 1.96 Å for Cu2O and CuO, respectively. Additionally, an increase in the Pd-Cu bond lengths can be observed with copper oxidation, the largest increase been detected in the Pd1Cu216 catalyst. This can be correlated to the increased perturbation of the underlying Cu lattice of the nanoparticles by the oxide layer. In Fig. S7 and Table S3, we compare the XANES spectra and Pd K-edge energy. After reduction, the Pd atoms are slightly negatively charged [48] (discussed previously) while after oxidation the edge is shifted to higher energies due to oxygen withdrawing electron density from its surrounding atoms. The XANES also suggest the Pd species are in their zeroth oxidation state due to the presence of the 2nd peak after the edge appearing only after reduction for the Pd1Cu216 catalyst [80]."
7,Catalytic testing,"3.2 Catalytic testing Mild reaction conditions were chosen as low temperatures and pressures are critical for the future of sustainable chemistry, especially for batch reactions. Additionally, the use of higher temperatures is known for reducing the selectivity away from furfuryl alcohol and towards decarbonylation reactions [4]. The catalytic data reveal that adding trace amounts of Pd to the Cu nanoparticles has significantly improved the hydrogenation of furfural at 50 °C with 1.5 bar of hydrogen (Table 3 ). The Pd/Cu catalysts show higher activity than Cu and higher selectivity than Pd. In the absence of any solid catalyst, neither decarbonylation nor hydrogenation reactions were observed. The parent Al2O3 support was also found to be inactive towards the hydrogenation of furfural, favouring mostly the acetalization of furfural with methanol, with negligible conversion (Table S4). The major product observed for all catalysts were furfuryl alcohol (FA) while other side products were 2-furaldehyde dimethyl acetal (FDMA, MS spectrum in Fig. S8) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). It should be noted, the lower carbon balance of the Pd100 catalyst is attributed to unquantifiable decomposition/ether products [81]. Fig. 6 a indicates an induction period of approximately 1 h where the Cu-based catalysts are inactive in terms of conversion. This behaviour is thought to be due to the limited catalytically available adsorbed hydrogen at the start of the reaction either through the formation of surface oxide (from O2 contamination) or Cu’s inability to adequately chemisorb hydrogen. However, the presence of Pd with the SAA catalysts seems to lessen its effects. This is in stark contrast to the monometallic Pd100 catalyst which lacks any such induction period due to its increased resistance to oxidation, higher reducibility and likely also due to the extended Pd surface to store hydrogen as β-hydride species during the in situ reduction treatment [14,61–63]. However, the Cu rich catalyst’s low activity is offset by its high selectivity. The increased selectivity is due to furfural binding to the surface via the lone pairs in the carbonyl functional group (Eads = -0.91 eV, [51]), promoting hydrogenation of the C O bond instead of the C C bond [82]. Pd surfaces are very reactive, allowing η2(C, O)-aldehyde bonding modes (Eads = -1.91 eV, [83]), in which both O and C are bound [4,83,84]. As a result, unidentified decarboxylation/ethers products are promoted, creating higher discrepancy in the carbon balance (Fig. 6b), and the THFA formation is also favoured. The lower selectivity of the Pd100 catalysts towards furfuryl alcohol could be associated with the presence of larger Pd flat surfaces which can lead to more ring hydrogenation products (THFA). Such behaviour has been reported for Pd catalysts by Li et al. [4]. Such sides products observed for Pd catalysts are not observed with the SAA catalysts since it requires extended Pd surfaces for such side reactions to occur, so the selectivity is provided by the Cu surfaces. This is also supported by previous DFT studies [52], where the Cu in PdCu alloys reduce the stability of the η2(C, O)-aldehyde adsorption present on Pd (111) indicated by the decrease in the heat of adsorption from 55.4 kJ/mol to 9.6 kJ/mol, thus the rate of decarbonylation reduced and hydrogenation is promoted. However, in the case of bimetallic PdAg alloys [29], Ag addition was reported to reduce the adsorption strength of furfuryl alcohol from -1.44 eV to -1.01 eV, reducing its further hydrogenation, thus improving the selectivity. Isolated Pd atoms are also reported to act as entry sites for hydrogen to dissociate and adsorb after which they Hads spill over onto the Cu surface [39,41,44,46,47,85–87] where they react with the adsorbed substrate. Fig. 7 a demonstrates the initial rates of furfural consumption for the PdCu SAA and the monometallic catalysts normalised for the Pd and the Cu metal content. This is of particular importance as the mechanistic action of the two metals in the reaction is most likely different with Pd being responsible mostly for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface while Cu providing the surface upon which the hydrogenation reaction takes place [38,41,44,47]. Clearly when the initial rates of the PdCu SAA are normalised for the Pd metal content, they appear to outperform the monometallic Pd catalyst as the amount of Pd present in these catalysts is significantly lower. Particularly, the Pd1Cu216 catalyst demonstrates an eleven-fold increase in activity compared to the monometallic Pd100 catalyst due to the aforementioned difference in Pd content. More interestingly, improvements are also observed over the Cu100 catalyst, showing that trace amounts of Pd atoms can augment the catalytic surface by promoting hydrogen adsorption. The improvement in activity with Pd loading has a diminishing return, with the Pd1Cu216 catalyst being the superior atom-efficient catalyst. It is proposed this trend is due to the Pd atoms being inaccessible to be used as hydrogen dissociation entry sites since the EXAFS suggests a significant portion of Pd atoms have diffused under the surface of the nanoparticle. Analysing the furfuryl alcohol production profile normalised to the total metal (Fig. 7b) shows that the atomically dispersed Pd1Cu216 catalyst can improve the performance of the Cu host surface to that of the benchmark monometallic Pd100 catalyst. While it can be clearly seen that both systems follow drastically different reaction mechanisms, explained earlier through the different reactant binding modes/hydrogen storage capability of Pd and Cu majority surfaces. To determine if the active sites are better instead of the contributing effect of increased active sites due to the higher dispersion of the catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) was determined in Fig. 8 . The TOF clearly shows that the introduction of the atomically dispersed Pd atoms increases the catalytic activity of the surface Cu sites with the optimal Pd1Cu216 SAA catalyst increasing Cu TOFs by ⁓85 %. Further increasing the Pd loading with the Pd1Cu53 comes with diminishing returns as the TOFs are not seen to increase which is also observed in the normalised initial rates (Fig. 8). When comparing TOFs of the monometallic Pd100 catalyst to a SAA catalyst shows that the atomically dispersed Pd sites are ⁓173 % more catalytically active than the typically equivalent surface sites found on Pd nanoparticles. Supporting the previous data, it can be noticed that initially as the Pd loading is increased the activity of the Pd sites also increases to a maximum TOF of 813 ± 81 h−1. Further drastic increases in the Pd loading with the Pd1Cu53 catalyst appears to begin to render the Pd sites less effective, possibly changing their properties to be more like that of a monometallic Pd catalyst. It should be noted that due to the inability to determine the Pd dispersion for the Pd1Cu234 catalyst (lack of Pd 3d signal) it was assumed to be 100 % for this TOF calculation. For comparison Fig. S9 shows the TOF calculation for all the catalysts using the total metal sites (both Cu and Pd). Interestingly the TOF values in this for the SAA catalysts show again a significant improvement compared to the monometallic Cu catalyst. As expected, in this comparison the Pd100 catalyst showed the highest TOF values due to its high content of Pd. Fig. 9 shows the produced furfuryl alcohol/metal mole ratio per hour (Equation 12 in supplementary information) under mild to moderate reaction temperatures and pressures. The catalysts synthesised in this work and those reported in the literature are compared. Table S5 gives the relevant conditions of operation that the experiments from literature were performed. The advantages of comparing the furfuryl alcohol mole ratio/metal per hour are that all the active metal content, yield, and reaction time are considered quantifying the best selective atom efficient catalysts. Comparing the monometallic Cu100/Al2O3 to the industrial used Cu-Cr [88] shows the Cu-Cr catalyst is 38 % more active but, requires higher temperatures and pressures of 110 °C and 10 bar of hydrogen. The optimal atom efficient catalyst under mild conditions (90 °C, 1 bar) reported in the literature is a Pd1/C3N4 single-atom catalyst [89] with a mole ratio of 158 h−1 while at more moderate conditions (120 °C, 6 bar) it is a Pd-Cu/C [90] catalyst with values of 289 h−1. The single-atom alloy catalysts synthesised in this work is shown to make the most efficient use of the precious metal atoms when compared against the literature (Pd1Cu216 = 601 h−1) demonstrating the surface replacement of Cu atoms with Pd can create superior atom efficient catalysts. 3.2.1 Spent catalyst characterisation and recycling experiments Comparing the XPS spectra of the spent and fresh Pd1Cu216 catalysts (Fig. S10) shows that after recovery, the spent material is significantly oxidised to CuO which is observed by the strong shake-up satellites and the shift of the Cu 2p3/2 transition by +0.82 eV. Note that the surface copper in the fresh catalyst appears to be in the metallic state after pre-treatment with hydrogen. However, the recovery of the spent catalyst involves centrifugation, washes and drying in air at 60 °C, causing the oxidation of the copper surface at the time of the analysis. Surface compositional analysis in Table S5 confirms the Cu species are largely in their Cu2+ oxidation state (77.5 %). As observed for the unused catalyst, the modified Auger parameter is found noticeably lower than bulk Cu (α’bulk = 1851.38 eV) or that of bulk CuO (α’CuO = 1851.40) for the spent material. Though, the α’ is also shifted by +0.63 eV, like that of Cu2O, though due the satellite structure/compositional analysis it can be presumed the shift arises from the presence of CuO while the overall negative shift of the parameter is due to Cu’s close contact to the polarisable support. However, the XPS calculated Cu dispersion values show that there may be some loss in Cu dispersion through nanoparticle sintering. The recyclability of the optimal PdCu SAA catalyst was investigated. The catalysts were recovered after the reaction via centrifugation followed by washing with methanol. Once dried at 60 °C overnight, the spent materials were weighed and retested. Due to losses of catalyst during sampling and recovery, a reaction cycle at 75 % of the original scale was used in the spent catalyst run to keep weight percentages of catalyst, reactant and solvent consistent with the fresh catalyst run. Table 4 shows that the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst was within error minimally affected after reuse. Which is consistent with the ICP-OES analysis of the filtered supernatant fluid as the elemental analysis ruled out Cu leaching."
8,Conclusions,"A series of bimetallic PdCu catalysts were tested for the selective hydrogenation of furfural under mild conditions. The catalyst morphology and electronic properties were thoroughly studied utilising XRD, XPS, STEM, EXAFS, XANES, TPR and ICP-OES. Catalyst characterisation confirms that Pd atoms were atomically dispersed on the host copper nanoparticle surface, confirming the formation of a single atom catalyst. With the combination of pseudo-in situ and ex situ EXAFS suggests that as the Pd loading increases, Pd atoms diffuse into the bulk reducing their catalytic effectiveness. The augmentation of the copper surface with trace amounts of Pd (0.0067 wt%) was found to improve the host Cu catalyst to that of a Pd catalyst in terms of normalised furfuryl alcohol production. Also, when compared to the Cu100 catalyst 1.7 and 1.9 times in performance is observed in the conversion and Cu TOFs, respectively. While the largest benefit of the SAA catalysts is based on atom efficiency, improvements are also observed in yields such that the Pd1Cu216 (Y% = 36.9 ± 1.8) catalyst performs almost as well as the Pd100 (Y% = 40.4 ± 2.0) benchmark catalyst and considerable better than the Cu100 catalyst (Y% = 20.9 ± 1.0). The synthesised atom efficient catalysts retain Cu’s high selectivity attributed to the incredible control of the Pd active sites since they are isolated, which eliminates competitive side-reactions that require more than one Pd neighbouring atoms. This work also shows the formation of a single atom alloy catalyst is not enough, but such isolated atoms need to be present on the surface to be ensure maximum efficiency. Finally, when compared against the literature, it was found that these materials are, to the best of our knowledge, the most competitive atom efficient catalysts implemented for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, especially when using both low H2 pressure and reaction temperature."
