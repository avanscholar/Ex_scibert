0,Introduction,"The concern in petroleum reserves and the environmental depletion due to the over consumption of the fossil fuels, drawn much attention in recent years and led to an intensive research interest for renewable fuels and to improve the energy conversion efficiency. A consensus has been reached in the past two decades that the most efficient and environmentally benign route to transform the chemical energy stored in the fuels into transportation energy is the application of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, which has the highest theoretical efficiency and can realize zero pollution except for the emissions during the process of hydrogen production [1,2]. However, the mature fuel cells require high purity hydrogen as the fuel, which is extremely difficult to store and transport. One of the possible solutions is on board generation of hydrogen from liquid fuels [3]. Methanol possesses a number of advantages for on board hydrogen production compared to the other fuels such as ethanol, glycerol, dimethyl ether, liquefied petroleum gas and other hydrocarbons. Methanol has higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio than the other alcohols, and except for formic acid, methanol is the easiest molecule for reforming to produce syngas because it has no carbon–carbon bond [4], which makes it convertible at a low temperature and leads to a less concern of coke formation [5–7]. Furthermore, methanol can be easily removed by biological processes although it is toxic [8,9]. Hydrogen can be generated from methanol through four major routes, i.e. direct decomposition (DP), partial oxidation (POX), steam reforming (SR) and oxidative steam reforming (OSR) [10]. DP is an endothermic process in which ideally pure methanol is converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide [11]. POX is an exothermic reaction and can be employed to build a fast reforming system [12]. SR is endothermic and requires additional heat but provides high hydrogen productivity [13]. OSR is the combination of POX and SR and can be run at a thermal neutral (TN) condition as to save the effort of heat management [14,15]. Extensive research efforts have been paid into different catalyst systems for hydrogen production from methanol. Various active components such as noble metals, Pt, Pd, Rh, and non-noble metals, Ni, Cu, Zn, on different supports, such as Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, Pr2O3, ZrO2 and activated carbon have been investigated [16–28]. All the reported works aim at the maximization of hydrogen production, the minimization of by-product formation and the stabilization of the catalyst and the reaction [29–34]. The results indicate that the yields of the different products largely depend on the catalyst used and the operating parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis to provide a guideline for choosing the appropriate reaction conditions. A few works dealing with the thermodynamic limitations of POX, SR and autothermal reforming (ATR) of methanol processes have been published [23,35–40]. However, to our knowledge, a thermodynamic investigation on OSR of methanol which evaluates the influence of temperature, the adding of H2O and O2 simultaneously has not been available. Based on the reported experimental facts [7,28,41], CH3OH, H2O, CO2, CO and H2 are the primary species in the system of hydrogen generation from methanol. However, CH4 [4,42], HCOOH [43,44], HCOOCH3 [45], HCHO [46,47], CH3OCH3 [47] and carbon [48,49] have also been found to exist in this system. Therefore, the chemical species considered here are CH3OH, H2O, CO2, CO, O2, H2, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, HCHO, CH3OCH3, CH4, and C. Carbon is taken as graphite, the others are all in the gas phase. This work employs a direct Gibbs free energy minimization method and focuses on the OSR of methanol for the hydrogen-rich feed production for fuel cells. The influences of H2O/MeOH (0.0–10.0) and O2/MeOH ratios (0.0–1.0) on the equilibrium composition of OSR at four different temperatures (200°C, 400°C, 600°C, 800°C) are examined. The pressure is kept at 0.1MPa. Hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon formation under oxidative conditions are presented. Finally, the operation conditions which maximize hydrogen and minimize carbon monoxide yields, suppress methane formation and avoid carbon deposition are proposed."
1,Models and methodology,"The most commonly used function to identify the equilibrium state is Gibbs free energy. For a system with multiple species and phases, equilibrium calculations can be performed through the Gibbs energy minimization method. In this work, because the pressure is fixed and the system is assumed as a closed system, the equilibrium composition depends only on the temperature, regardless of the specific reaction and catalyst performance. The total Gibbs free energy of a system is expressed as (1) nG = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i G ¯ i can be substituted by (2) G ¯ i = G i 0 + RT ln f ˆ i f i 0 Here, G i 0 represents the standard Gibbs function of the formation of species i. f ˆ i and f i 0 are the fugacity of i species at operating conditions and the standard condition. Then the total Gibbs free energy is (3) nG = ∑ ( n i G i 0 ) + RT ∑ n i ln f ˆ i f i 0 For the reaction equilibrium in gas phase, (4) f ˆ i = y i P ϕ ˆ i y i = n i / n Therefore, applying Lagrange multiplier principle, the minimum Gibbs free energy of the gaseous system can be expressed as (5) ∑ i = 1 N n i Δ G f i 0 + RT ln P + RT ln y i + RT ln ϕ ˆ i + ∑ k ( λ i a ik ) = 0 The Gibbs-energy of the solid carbon in the system can be considered as (6) G ¯ c ( s ) = G c ( s ) ≅ Δ G f c 0 ( s ) Then, the minimum Gibbs free energy of the overall system is (7) ∑ i = 1 N - 1 n i [ Δ G f i 0 + RT ln P + RT ln y i + RT ln ϕ ˆ i + ∑ k ( λ i a ik ) ] + n c Δ G f c 0 = 0 All the equilibrium calculations here employing the Gibbs-energy minimization method were done with a commercial software Outokumpu HSC Chemistry 4.0 [50]."
2,Results,
3,Hydrogen yield,"3.1 Hydrogen yield The effects of H2O/MeOH and O2/MeOH ratios on hydrogen yield in H2/MeOH at four temperatures (200, 400, 600, 800°C) are plotted in Fig. 1 a–d. The conversion of methanol is always 100% in the condition range examined. For all the four temperatures, the yields of hydrogen increases monotonically with the increase of H2O/MeOH ratio, but decreases with the increase of O2/MeOH ratio especially at high temperature and high H2O/MeOH ratio. Moreover, it is important to note that the increase of hydrogen yield with the drop of O2/MeOH ratio is much more obvious than the increase of H2O/MeOH ratio. This observation is in good agreement with the OSR of ethanol [51] and propane [52]. At a given O2/MeOH and H2O/MeOH ratio, the yield of hydrogen first increases drastically with the increase of the temperature but after 600°C a slight decrease occurs. Specially, the yield of hydrogen produced at 200°C is much lower compared to 600 and 800°C, indicating high temperature is necessary for enhancing the capacity of hydrogen production. In general, moderate high temperature, high H2O/MeOH ratio and low O2/MeOH ratio are appropriate for hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield in methanol OSR approaches the maxima about 2.9 at a condition set O2/MeOH=0.0, H2O/MeOH=10.0 and 600°C."
4,Carbon monoxide yield,"3.2 Carbon monoxide yield As is known, carbon monoxide is not a favored product in the hydrogen production for fuel cells, as it is a poison to the platinum cathode in the low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Fig. 2 a–d reveals the equilibrium yield of carbon monoxide in CO/MeOH according to O2/MeOH and H2O/MeOH ratios at the four different temperatures 200, 400, 600, 800°C respectively. The carbon monoxide yield is close to 0.0 at 200°C and increases quickly with the rise of the temperature. At 400°C, carbon monoxide yield exhibits the highest point at H2O/MeOH=0.5–1.0 for O2/MeOH ratios of 0.0–0.6, after the maxima, it remains almost constant. While for the higher O2/MeOH ratio, the yield of carbon monoxide decreases along with the increase of the H2O/ MeOH ratio. At 600°C, it shows a similar trend as that at 400°C, the highest yield is approached at H2O/MeOH=0.5–1.0 for O2/MeOH ratios of 0–0.2. After the maxima, carbon monoxide yield diminishes with the further increase of the H2O/MeOH ratio for all the O2/MeOH ratios. For the data of 800°C, carbon monoxide yield drops sharply with the increase of the H2O/MeOH ratio. The influence of the O2/MeOH ratio on carbon monoxide yield is complex. At 200 and 400°C, higher O2/MeOH ratio lead to higher carbon monoxide yield. However, this trend is reversed for the data at 600 and 800°C. This phenomenon indicates the effect of O2/MeOH ratio is affected by the temperature. Wang and Wang [39] pointed out that methanol combustion, decomposition, steam reforming and water gas shift are the major reactions in ATR of methanol and the total oxidation is preferential in the system. Oxygen has a great potential to oxidize thus always leads to a preference for total oxidation of any hydrocarbon species. Only when there is excess methanol, decomposition and steam reforming have their chance. From this point of view, an increase of the O2/MeOH ratio doesn’t make a real contribution to the elimination of carbon monoxide at high temperatures (600 and 800°C), as it reduces the yield of carbon monoxide and hydrogen simultaneously through the total oxidation pathways."
5,Methane yield,"3.3 Methane yield Methane is also an unwanted product in this system since its formation deprives hydrogen of H atoms which will inevitably lower the hydrogen yield. The yield of methane in CH4/MeOH as a function of H2O/MeOH and O2/MeOH ratios at four different temperatures (200, 400, 600, 800°C) is shown in Fig. 3 a–d. It is clear that methane yield reduces quickly as the temperature increases. While at a fixed temperature and H2O/MeOH ratio, methane yield keeps on decreasing with the increase of O2/MeOH ratio. For the effect of H2O/MeOH ratio, methane yield exhibits a complex profile. At 200°C, methane yield increases with the increase of the H2O/MeOH ratio and reaches the peak at H2O/MeOH=1.0–1.5, after the peak, it remains almost a constant value. At 400°C, the yield of methane approaches the maxima at H2O/MeOH ratio from 1.0 to 0.0, the maxima moves to a lower H2O/MeOH ratio, accompanied by a rise in O2/MeOH ratio. After the peak, the response surface drops with the further increase of H2O/MeOH ratio. For 600°C, the methane yield approaches zero quickly with the increase of the H2O/MeOH and O2/MeOH ratios. At 800°C, only the first point presents an appreciable amount of methane. Almost no methane can be formed with O2/MeOH ratio⩾0.4 and H2O/MeOH ratio⩾4.0 at 600°C, while at 800°C, with O2/MeOH ratio⩾0.2 and H2O/MeOH ratio⩾2.0 no methane needs to be cared. In general, methane formation can not be efficiently suppressed by the increase of H2O/MeOH ratio at low temperatures (200°C, 400°C) and the further increase of temperature is necessary for lowering the methane selectivity as well as improving hydrogen selectivity."
6,Coke formation,"3.4 Coke formation Carbon deposition has been recognized as one of the major reasons for the rapid deactivation of methanol steam reforming catalyst [53]. Fig. 4 a–d depicts the potential of coke formation. It can be seen that at 200°C, coke formation is suppressed by the increase of H2O/MeOH ratio. However, the carbon yield in C/MeOH shows maxima with the rising of O2/MeOH ratio at low H2O/MeOH ratio. For H2O/MeOH ratio⩾1.5, no coke can be formed for the range of O2/MeOH ratio examined; For H2O/MeOH ratio=1.0, no carbon deposited for the O2/MeOH ratio 0.6–1.0. There is a great potential for coke formation for H2O/MeOH ratio 0–0.5. At the other three temperatures, the increase of O2/MeOH ratio inhibits the formation of coke. For higher temperatures, the suppression of carbon formation becomes easier. For 400°C, when H2O/MeOH ratio⩾1.0, no carbon can be formed, while at H2O/MeOH ratio=0.5, coke can merely be formed when O2/MeOH ratio⩽0.2. At H2O/MeOH ratio=0, no carbon formed when O2/MeOH ratio⩾0.8. Coke can only be formed for the points H2O/MeOH ratio⩽0.5, O2/MeOH ratio=0 at 600°C; H2O/MeOH ratio=0, O2/MeOH ratio=0 at 800°C. Generally, coke can be efficiently removed by merely addition of H2O for OSR of methanol. As mentioned above, hydrogen production can be maximized at the temperature of 600°C, while coke can not form when H2O/MeOH ratio⩾1.0. As a result, the influence of carbon formation in methanol OSR can be ignored at optimal conditions."
7,Other possible products,"3.5 Other possible products Besides the basic species set (CH3OH, H2O, O2, CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and C), the products HCOOH, HCOOCH3, HCHO, CH3OCH3 are also involved in this work. H2O/MeOH ratio=3.0 and O2/MeOH ratio=0.2 are chosen as the operation conditions for the evaluation of the four possible species. The equilibrium yields of them as a function of temperature ranging from 200–800°C are shown in Fig. 5 . As is seen, formaldehyde exists in this system over the temperature range examined, while formic acid appears above 400°C. Both of their yields are below 2.00E−7 which means the concentrations of them are under ppm level. Furthermore, the yields of formaldehyde and methyl formate are suppressed at essentially zero (lower than 1.00E−14). As a result, although HCOOH, HCOOCH3, HCHO, and CH3OCH3 are observed in some experimental reports [43–47], they are likely to exist as the intermediates."
8,Discussion,"The novel aspect of this work is the examination of the effects of H2O and O2 as well as the temperature simultaneously, and the conditions involved in this study include the cases of DP, POX, SR and ATR of methanol. It composes as a thorough thermodynamic evaluation of the hydrogen production from methanol. The operating conditions of hydrogen production for fuel cell are often optimized to achieve the maximum hydrogen yield, the minimum carbon monoxide and methane formation as well as no carbon deposition. The excess water has a beneficial effect on the formation of hydrogen as well as the suppression of carbon monoxide, methane and coke formation. Further, coke can be totally removed by only addition of H2O. However, more water leads to more heat supply and larger reactor volume. Consequently, an appropriate H2O/MeOH ratio is necessary for the OSR of methanol. The addition of oxygen lowers the energy input as well as the yields of the main products simultaneously especially at high temperatures. An appropriate O2/MeOH ratio has the advantage of reducing the potential of coke formation at low H2O/MeOH ratio, but it does not make a real contribution to the suppression of carbon monoxide. For the purpose of producing hydrogen-rich gas, no or a small amount oxygen addition is preferred as a result. From the thermodynamic analysis above, SR of methanol seems to be the best way to produce hydrogen-rich gas for fuel cell. However, OSR process is also meaningful for H2 production in practical application as the addition of O2 lowers the energy demand of the system [14] and may even favor selective removal of CO [54] as well as H2 production due to the elimination of CO which can strongly chemisorbed on Pd catalyst [55]. Temperature has a decisive influence on the yields of the main products. It is evident the conditions for high hydrogen yield are somewhat in coincidence with high carbon monoxide yield. For hydrogen production, 600°C is better than the other three temperatures. While carbon monoxide yield increases monotonically with the increase of the temperature. However, the optimal temperature (600°C) obtained in this thermodynamic analysis is much higher than the typical operating temperatures (200–400°C [56]) often used in literature for the hydrogen production from methanol. The main reason for this difference is the great potential of methane formation which drastically reduces the hydrogen yield at low temperatures (200°C, 400°C). As is known, catalyst systems can have great impact on the selectivity of different products. In order to operate this reaction at a low temperature, the catalysts with high ability of resisting methane formation should be chosen. Some catalysts such as Ni-based ones that are active in methanation reaction show high methane selectivity in the process of hydrogen production from methanol [57,58]. As a result, such catalysts should be designed carefully for production of pure hydrogen from methanol."
9,Conclusions,"A thermodynamic evaluation of the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of methanol has been done through a Gibbs free energy minimization method. The effects of H2O/MeOH (0.0–10.0) and O2/MeOH ratios (0.0–1.0) at four fixed temperatures (200°C, 400°C, 600°C, 800°C) are examined. The conversion of methanol is 100% in the condition range evaluated. The compound basis involved in this calculation are CH3OH, H2O, CO2, O2 CO, H2, CH4, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, HCHO, CH3OCH3 and C (graphite). Based on the thermodynamic calculation results, the following conclusions can be reached. Thermodynamically, CH4 and C (graphite) are important products coexisting with H2O, CO2, CO and H2, while the formation of HCOOH, HCOOCH3, HCHO and CH3OCH3 are negligible. Evaluation of the OSR of methanol indicates that high H2O/MeOH ratio, low O2/MeOH ratio and relatively high temperature are favored for this process. High hydrogen yield, low carbon monoxide yield and trace amount of methane and coke formation can be achieved simultaneously. The optimal operation conditions for the OSR of methanol are proposed as 600°C, H2O/MeOH ratio=6.0–8.0 and O2/MeOH ratio=0. With this condition, a hydrogen yield of 2.77–2.84 and a carbon monoxide yield of 0.13–0.17 with trace yield of methane (0.0070–0.017) can be obtained without the danger of coke formation. Methane is the most occurring products at low temperature (200°C, 400°C) and the potential of its formation is surprisingly high even with a rather high H2O/MeOH ratio. From a practical point of view, the catalyst systems should be designed to prevent methane formation in order to operate this reaction at a low temperature and to improve hydrogen and carbon dioxide selectivity."
