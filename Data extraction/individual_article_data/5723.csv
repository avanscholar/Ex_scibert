0,Introduction,"Surfactants stand out as an important class of raw materials used in the manufacture of everyday consumer goods, especially detergents. The global demand for surfactants in 2018 has been estimated as 17 million tones, with a corresponding USD 39 billion market value. Moreover, the production of household detergents was the most usual application for this production good, being responsible for 46% of total demand in 2018 (Bland, 2019). Detergent manufacturing chains present great complexity considering the various inputs used for their production. In addition, environmental impacts can also be associated to these arrangements due to asset consumption from both vegetable and petrochemical origin and emissions. This scenario has motivated the emergence of industry regulations and initiatives based on Cleaner Production (CP) principles, aiming for the implementation of preventive environmental strategies to industrial processes, while still maintaining product effectiveness (Van Lieshout et al., 2015). The possibility of achieving both environmental and financial benefits due to the implementation of CP practices have been discussed in the context of a variety of sectors, such as electricity production through decentralized microgrids (Aghdam et al., 2018), machining processes (Krolczyk et al., 2019) and industry (Oliveira et al., 2019). Companies can also attain competitive advantage through CP practices due to improved corporate image towards stakeholders (Guimarães et al., 2018). On the other hand, cleaner production proposals for chemical processes comprising green chemistry principles restricted to product formulation may lead to unexpected increase of environmental impacts on a systemic level. Therefore, actions recommended in this domain should be assessed from a comprehensive perspective, such as that provided by the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique (Secchi et al., 2016). Likewise, holistic investigations such as LCA of products are beneficial in the context of widening the application of CP practices and should be preferred (Hens et al., 2018). In this context, a prioritized list of actions to be considered during the development of cleaning products with better environmental performance should preferably (i) focus on the active ingredients (i.e. others than water): with higher percentage contributions in product formulations; (ii) encourage reduced water consumption during product usage; and (iii) investigate alternative feedstocks and suppliers with strong agricultural land use management and environmental practices (Van Lieshout et al., 2015). The coupling between the LCA and CP approaches for the assessment of cleaning products is a theme addressed under different perspectives by the literature, comprising initiatives varying from those focused specifically on environmental performance due to product usage, to some others considering the design of improved formulations under a systemic approach. LCA has been applied in order to identify improvement opportunities regarding high-pressure cleaners in terms of resource consumption, environmental impacts and consequences on the work environment. In that initiative, the ecotoxicity potential due to cleaning detergents usage was one of the most important impacts for this product category, along with the consumption of copper in order to manufacture the cleaning machine engine (Caspersen and Sørensen, 1998). The relevance of usage was also highlighted when investigating the importance of consumer habits, detergent manufacturing parameters and electricity grid mixes for 23 European countries as variability drivers in life cycle greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of laundry washing products. The study concluded that usage is more relevant only for countries applying fossil-based mixes. Conversely, manufacture parameters were more significant for determining GHG emissions in a context of low-carbon electricity grids (Shahmohammadi et al., 2018). These findings could even support footprint improvement initiatives based on alternative formulations. Alternatively, the environmental profiles of five different laundry detergents produced by Procter & Gamble considering washing and infrastructure conditions in the United Kingdom have been compared under the LCA perspective. The investigation pointed out that concentrated detergents, both in powder and liquid form, are environmentally preferable to the corresponding diluted ones, given the lower use of active ingredients per wash. In addition, expressive gains provided by these agents were verified in terms of Eutrophication, Aquatic Toxicity, Ozone Depletion and Photochemical Smog (Van Hoof et al., 2003). Likewise, LCA was also applied to verify the environmental performance of a new laundry detergent formulation to be used in cold washes compared to its traditional alternative. The benefits of this new product were investigated in terms of energy savings during its usage and a comprehensive perspective was considered in order to identify the main environmental impacts influenced by changes in the detergent formulation and in its usage. The results substantiated a promotion of changes in clothes washing habits with the development of the new product (Dewaele et al., 2006). This systemic perspective was also assumed for the comparison of conventional (concentrated and ready-to-use) versions of cleaning products, and their Green Seal-compliant counterpart, in order to support customer decisions. In that case, Green Seal-compliant alternatives implied in 5.4% and 14% reductions, respectively, in terms of Climate Change and Fossil Depletion. Conversely, conventional ready-to-use detergents presented the worse results for all impact categories considered in the study (Kapur et al., 2012). Following a different approach, implications deriving from the substitution of synthetic triglycerides with an alternative obtained from by-products of olive oil industry were assessed when investigating eco-innovation options for a cosmetic. It was observed that formulations based on renewable raw materials could lead to up to a 23% abatement for the Climate Change indicator and a 75% decrease for Resource Depletion when the substitution is coupled to the implementation of all suggested life cycle improvements (Secchi et al., 2016). Similarly, environmental effects due to the substitution of a palm oil kernel-based intermediary fatty alcohol with a fossil-based alternative were also assessed by means of LCA. The authors observed that such an initiative implies environmental trade-offs, as the Climate Change indicator decreased in 44%, whereas Fossil Depletion increased in 207% (Shah et al., 2016). Moreover, the LCA technique was applied to study outcomes of the substitution of sodium tripolyphosphate with methyl glycine diacetic acid in automatic dishwashing detergents, due to legal restrictions on the use of phosphate in the European Union. In that case, it was observed that the new formulation implied better performance for all environmental impact categories. Noticeable improvements were obtained especially in terms of Eutrophication (99% reduction), Climate Change (44%) and Fossil Depletion (10%) (Van Hoof et al., 2017). Although the scientific community is interested in improving the environmental performance of cleaning products, the research identified in the literature is mostly focused on consolidated detergents formulations or assessing the effects arising from the disposal of cleaning agents in the environment. An alternative perspective, however, was offered by the research partnership known as ERASM (Environmental & Health Risk Assessment and Management of Surfactants) which compiled data from 14 major European companies and structured Life Cycle Inventories (LCI) for 15 commercially relevant surfactants and 17 precursors intending to promote the application of LCA by industries, and also the development of new policies. Although such LCI allow the assessment of different impact categories, results were informed only in terms of Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential, as these categories are of interest to many stakeholders and the results could be calculated based on robust methods (Schowanek et al., 2018). As far as observed in the literature, no other initiatives specifically discussing the environmental performance of the manufacturing of assets used in the composition of such products were found. This study was developed with the aim of contributing to this area, investigating the environmental and energy effects of applying cleaner production proposals to the production chain of Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate containing 3 mol of ethylene oxide (SLES 3EO). The option for SLES 3EO is due to an association of two factors. The first is related to marketing and application aspects. This organic compound is one of the most commonly applied anionic surfactants to the formulation of laundry detergents, cosmetics and personal care products (Janshekar et al., 2013). This is due to its low sensitivity to water hardness, high solubility and suitable stability in liquid formulations stored at low temperatures (Smulders and Sung, 2000). Moreover, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate market is expected to surpass USD 1.5 billion by 2024, as a result of an increase on the global demand for personal care products (IPS-Ingredis, 2018). The second factor is academic, since scientific developments regarding the assessment of actions for improving the environmental performance of this product are still sparse. For instance, the technical literature is restricted to a study which investigated the effects of Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate in cleaning product formulations in the context of the Netherlands (Van de Plassche et al., 1999). However, although the authors proposed the establishment of a basis for the identification of cleaner production opportunities, the analysis was restricted to verifying aquatic toxicity impacts concerning the release of this substance in water bodies, disregarding the production steps. Regarding the Brazilian context, there is a lack of formal registers including companies that apply CP in that country (Oliveira et al., 2019). The process carried out for the preparation of cleaner production proposals was based on the Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP) philosophy. RECP comprises the continuous application of preventive environmental strategies to processes, products and services in order to increase their efficiency and reduce risks to humans and the environment (UNEP-UNIDO, 2010). This study proposes to make a further contribution to the theme by investigating the effect of potential improvement proposals on the environmental and energy performance of the SLES 3EO production chain. The analysis takes into account technological and operational conditions practiced in Brazil. From this approach, the initiative intends to contribute to the inclusion of environmental indicators among parameters adopted in decision-making processes carried out in the domestic domain of this production chain. In order to describe how this purpose was achieved, four sections have been structured. This Introduction places the context in which the study has developed, presents academic initiatives similar to those addressed by this research, and defines its conceptual bases (CP and LCA) and objectives. The Material and Methods section presents the main assumptions regarding the conduction of the LCA study, as well as the process for definition of the alternative scenarios. At the Results and Discussion, environmental and energy indicators are assessed considering their relevant precursors. Finally, conclusions, limitations and the hierarchization of RECP proposals are addressed at the fourth section."
1,Material and methods,"The methodological structure established to meet the purposes of this study comprised six major steps. Fig. 1 depicts a summary of the research procedure considered in this initiative. The first step consisted in identifying and collecting data and updated information regarding resource extraction, intermediate production, processing routes and logistic aspects, as well as other aspects that allowed for the creation of robust models of the process from a life cycle point of view. This was followed by the specification, at the quantitative level, of material and energy resource consumption and emissions, as well as by-products throughout the SLES 3EO production chain. This procedure provided a representative model of the interactions between such a productive arrangement and the environment, or with other anthropic systems. In the third step, the LCA technique was then applied to the model in order to define the environmental performance concerning the manufacturing cycle. After identifying the main sources of environmental impacts in the SLES 3EO chain, an approach based on the RECP concept was applied, in order to identify alternatives potentially capable of improving the environmental performance of this product. RECP aims for the improvement of synergies regarding: (i) production efficiency, through optimization of the productive use of natural resources; (ii) environmental management, by conserving resources and minimizing adverse impacts of industrial systems on the natural environment; and (iii) human development, providing jobs and protecting the well-being of workers and local communities (Ashton et al., 2018). Such approach is also highlighted by Hens et al. (2018). From a practical point of view, RECP initiatives includes strategies such as raw material substitution, enhancement of process control, implementation of new technologies and recovery and reuse of industrial by-products (UNEP-UNIDO, 2010). The alternatives that were not mutually exclusive were then combined, giving rise to theoretical performance improvement scenarios. In the fifth stage, the LCA technique was re-applied for each improvement scenario, in order to test its environmental effectiveness. For this purpose, the same conceptual framework, criteria and methodological structure applied to the baseline scenario were adopted, assuming the reference condition for analysis purposes. Finally, reflections resulting from the previous step were carried out, in order to provide practical subsidies for the incorporation of environmental variables into the management decision-making process of organizations belonging to the cleaning products and specialty chemical sectors."
2,System description,"2.1 System description The life cycle of the analyzed product begins in the palm cultivation stage, which, in the present case, takes place in agricultural sites located in Malaysia and Indonesia. After harvesting, palm kernel seeds serve as the raw material for palm kernel oil (PKO) extraction and processing (PORAM, 2010; FAOSTAT, 2010). In this stage, the energy comes from cogeneration as a result of burning the organic leftovers of the agricultural stage itself (palm bark and bagasse) (Jungbluth et al., 2007). The PKO arrives in Brazil via the Aratu port, in the Brazilian state of Bahia (BA). A lauryl acid with carbonic distribution from C8 to C18 is obtained from the PKO. This production, as well as its distillation, consumes thermal energy available in the form of steam. Such activities are carried out in the municipality of Camaçari (BA). Lauryl alcohols with carbonic distribution C12 through C18 are obtained by esterification and hydrogenation of its corresponding fatty acids. When submitted to the distillation unit, these alcohols result in the generation of an intermediate: Lauryl alcohol (C12 to C14). This alcohol is then combined with ethylene oxide (EO) obtained from petrochemical origin under controlled conditions, in the same industrial plant located in the municipality of Camaçari (BA). This transformation results in ethoxylated lauryl alcohol containing 3 mol of EO. The next stage is the production of sulfated ethoxylated alcohol, which takes place in a chemical plant located in the city of Tremembé, in the state of São Paulo (SP). This stage consumes liquid sulfur and ethoxylated lauryl alcohol (3EO) in order to synthesize SLES 3EO in an alkaline medium, at a concentration of 70%w/w in water. The determination of system boundaries led to the inclusion of unit processes in the Product System (ISO, 2006), which, for the present study, comprised: (i) the palm cultivation and PKO extraction and processing stages, both in Asia; (ii) the transoceanic transport of treated oil to Brazil; (iii) the industrial processing of PKO to SLES 3EO by means of the intermediate stages of lauryl acid and lauryl alcohol production, as well as ethoxylation and sulfation. The transportation stages involved in this arrangement were also considered, along with the production of industrial utilities. The Product System also includes losses to the environment in the form of process waste, described in terms of wastewater and atmospheric emissions, including their final destinations. The final form assumed by the Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate Product System is depicted in Fig. 2 ."
3,Goal and Scope definition,"2.2 Goal and Scope definition This study was carried out in line with the conceptual framework established by the ISO 14044 standard (ISO, 2006), which provides LCA concepts and operational and structural aspects. SimaPro software version 9.0.0.35 was used to calculate the environmental impact indicators. The aim was to assess the environmental performance of SLES 3EO considering an attributional approach. The initiative is restricted, in terms of the LCA application, to a ‘cradle-to-gate’ approach. Thus, environmental aspects and their respective post-production impacts were not observed. In this context, the Reference Flow (RF) established for this investigation was: “the production of 1.0 ton of Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate containing 3 mol of ethylene oxide (SLES 3EO)”. Primary data collection regarding industrial activities was carried out for twelve months in 2011. It should be highlighted that the technological concept of the industry sector considered in this study remains the same until today. Therefore, these data can still be considered representative for the current processing arrangement regarding amounts and operating conditions related to SLES 3EO manufacturing at the present time. Geographical coverage regarding industrial stages considers the processes that occur in the Brazilian states of Bahia and São Paulo, including processes carried out, respectively, in the Camaçari Petrochemical Complex and in the municipality of Tremembé. As per the agricultural activities, palm cultivation in Malaysia and Indonesia were also considered. Any other geographic variations were introduced from databases used to complement the study. Multifunctionality situations were managed by means of allocation. This occurred in the palm kernel oil production stage that takes place in Malaysia and Indonesia, following the economic value allocation criterion as previously applied in inventories used as reference for this product in the Ecoinvent database (Jungbluth et al., 2007). Allocation factors attributed to Crude Palm Oil, Palm Kernel Oil and Palm Meal were, respectively, 81.3%, 17.3% and 1.4%, as informed by Jungbluth et al. (2007)."
4,Life Cycle Inventory,"2.3 Life Cycle Inventory Quantification of environmental aspects related to palm cultivation were provided by PORAM (2010) and also by Jungbluth et al. (2007). Valuable statistical data were also obtained from FAOSTAT (2010). Oil extraction and refining, oil derivates production and natural gas extraction and transportation, as well as electricity generation and distribution were described by secondary data. It should be noted that in all situations where the use of such kind of information was necessary, a preliminary analysis of relevance and significance was performed. In addition, adjustments were also applied to harmonize such data and increase their representativeness to the countries where the processes occur, while maintaining consistency within acceptable limits. Data regarding the industrial stages of SLES 3EO production, the utilities used in the process and the transports involved in the Product System were obtained from primary sources. Nevertheless, confidentiality restrictions avoid that such operation could be presented in more details than the information depicted in Fig. 2. On the other hand, the consolidated Life Cycle Inventories related to the scenarios investigated in this study are indicated in Table 1 . Further details concerning the scenarios are discussed in Section 2.5."
5,Life Cycle Impact Assessment,"2.4 Life Cycle Impact Assessment The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was carried out on two levels. The first attempted to quantify the effects of GHG emissions on the environment. In this case, the analysis was performed taking into account two different conceptual approaches: (i) the method proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, 2013 – v 1.03 (IPCC, 2013), which, in order to estimate contributions related to Global Warming (GW) admits a neutrality between natural carbon capture and emission at the Technosphere and Biosphere interface; and (ii) the approach taken by the ISO 14067 standard (ISO, 2018), for which the rates of carbon removed from the atmosphere (through photosynthetic processes carried out by plant sources) and emitted into the air (via burning of derived products) should be considered for the purposes of assessing GW contributions. The second approach adopted by the LCIA considered impacts related to natural resource consumption. It was decided that these depletions would be described in terms of Primary Energy Demand, not only for comparison purposes, but also so that these effects could be assembled in the form of a single indicator. The situation was equated with the application of the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) v 1.10 method (Frischknecht et al., 2007). According to Huijbregts et al. (2006), the CED of a product represents direct and indirect energy use throughout the entire life cycle of raw and auxiliary materials. Estimates obtained by the CED predispose that the Lower and Higher Heating Value (LHV and HHV) of primary energy sources may be chosen. In addition, the method allows for the distinction between energy requirements of renewable (biomass: RB; wind: RWD; water: RWA) and non-renewable (fossil: NRF; nuclear: NRN; biomass: NRB) resources (Frischknecht et al., 1998). This investigation was restricted to the production chain of SLES 3EO. Therefore, only the impact categories related to that arrangement, and those affected by the cleaner production perspective were assessed. Categories typically related to the usage of cleaning products, such as Ecotoxicity and Eutrophication, were not considered, and Primary Energy Demand replaced Fossil Depletion although this approach has been applied in similar studies. The preference for Global Warming and Primary Energy Demand is also due to the fact that such impact categories would allow the comparison of results with more recent studies, particularly the initiative conducted by Schowanek at al. (2018). Additionally, the relevance of such categories was also highlighted by Yang et al. (2018) in their investigation on the use of biomass as a promising way to mitigate the energy crisis and global climate change."
6,Alternative scenarios proposal,"2.5 Alternative scenarios proposal The potential solutions for improving environmental performance were outlined from the identification of the main contributions in terms of environmental impacts for SLES 3EO processing. The propositions derive from the prioritized list of environmentally cleaner production actions suggested by Van Lieshout et al. (2015) and the increasing trend outlined by Secchi et al. (2016) and Marcon et al. (2017) regarding the substitution of fossil-based inputs for bio-based alternatives. Yang et al. (2018) also discuss the effects of using biomass as energy source. Following RECP directions, the selected possibilities were projected from economic, technological and operational criteria, before having their environmental validity evaluated by the LCA technique. The scenarios defined for analysis are summarized in Table 2 . The first proposal for the SLES 3EO life cycle intervention (S1) comprises replacing the palm growing site. In this case, the PKO used in the industrial stages would be supplied by farms located in the Northern Brazilian state of Pará, which is considered the main national producer of this input. The agricultural practices that characterize S1 were modeled respecting the agroecological zoning restrictions for palms in Brazil, a regulation that prohibits the cultivation of this commodity through the deforestation of new areas. Secondary data from Queiroz (2011) were used as reference during the elaboration of Life Cycle Inventory regarding palm cultivation in Brazil. Palm processing and refined PKO production were modeled using additional data collected from Jungbluth et al. (2007) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (2015). Such information was adapted to Brazilian conditions concerning electricity and thermal energy generation, and modal and transport distances before being incorporated to the LCI. After being refined, the PKO should be transported by barge tankers along 2810 km until arriving at the industrial plant, where it would be transformed into lauryl alcohol by a process arrangement identical to that adopted for the Baseline Scenario. In S2, the proposal comprises the replacement of Lauryl Alcohol obtained from the processing of PKO extracted from palms cultivated in Malaysia and Indonesia by a synthetic congener derived from olefins and ethylene produced from petroleum. This process would occur in the USA and result in a mixture of fatty alcohols with 82% consisting of assets produced from the Oxo process, and 18% by others generated through the Ziegler process. The inventory used as reference was obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Zah and Hischier, 2007). The predominance of the Oxo process was also highlighted by Schowanek et al. (2018). In this context, synthetic lauryl alcohol would serve as an input of the industrial stage already carried out in Brazil. Regarding the modeling of the synthetic lauryl alcohol transportation, a 100 km average distance was assumed between the production unit and the port of Houston (USA), from which the asset would be distributed to Brazil. In addition, it was defined that the transoceanic route would extend to the Port of Aratu (BA), along an 8791 km distance (SEARATES, 2015). In S2, synthetic lauryl alcohol could be directly used as an input in the ethoxylation stage where it would combine with ethylene oxide to produce ethoxylated lauryl alcohol containing 3 mol of EO, obeying the same conditions established for the Baseline Scenario for obtaining SLES 3EO. The data related to synthetic lauryl alcohol processing were essentially secondary and obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Zah and Hischier, 2007). Although the reference inventories used to represent the production of fatty alcohol were based on average European technologies, it was accepted that similar procedural operating conditions were valid in the development of identical technologies practiced in the USA. In order to verify the influence of fossil fuel substitution in the industrial processing stages that occur in Brazil, thermal energy generation from biomass was proposed. This alternative was set up as S3. The aim was to gauge trends that have become recurrent in the chemical sector, increasing the fraction of energy inputs from renewable sources for heat generation in places where firewood, sugarcane bagasse and straw are available at lower costs (CNI, 2012). The Product System defined for S3 should follow the same orientations of Baseline Scenario regarding palm cultivation practices and locations. Likewise, the arrangement used for industrial processing would follow the same approach until SLES 3EO production, except for the use of biomass to generate thermal energy in all industrial processes occurring in Brazil, replacing the fossil fuels used in the original situation. In this case, wood chips with average moisture rate of 40%w/w should be burned in a modular boiler aiming to generate superheated steam under high pressure conditions (20 bar and 350 °C). The steam then would leave the unit towards a turbine, transferring energy to an electric generator during its expansion. Expanded steam would also fit into potential industrial process uses, according to thermodynamic specifications. Therefore, the fluid would be extracted from the turbine at different pressure levels and taken to other sectors of the industrial plant in order to meet thermal demands. In case of phase changes, condensates would be collected and sent to a boiler to initiate a new thermodynamic cycle (Rankine cycle). Losses that occur during the route, in the form of purge, drag, or evaporation, would be supplied by demineralized water replenishment actions. The ashes resulting from biomass burning should be disposed in a landfill. Finally, S4 presents the substitution of ethylene oxide with an alternative derived from ethylene produced from sugarcane ethanol. The purpose of this advance was to measure differences in terms of the environmental impact profile of the substitution of a petrochemical origin input with a renewable alternative. It should be noted that the remaining steps would remain unchanged with respect to the Baseline Scenario. Ethylene oxide would be produced when ethylene and oxygen react in the presence of a silver catalyst. The process should occur at relatively low temperature conditions (200–300 °C) but under high pressures (10–20 bar), reaching product yields of about 80% (Rebsdat and Mayer, 2000). The ethylene consumed in the process would result from ethanol dehydration, a reaction that, although catalyzed, occurs favorably only at elevated temperatures due to its selectivity (Kosaric et al., 2011). In the synthesis of ‘green’ ethylene oxide, ethanol would derive from sugarcane. Regarding system boundary definitions, unit processes related to sugarcane cultivation, ethanol production were based on data provided by Moore et al. (2017). Information regarding the synthesis of ethylene via catalytic dehydration of ethanol derive from Kagyrmanova et al. (2011) and were adapted to the Brazilian context based on considerations from Hansen et al. (2015). Transports from the agricultural region, located in the municipality of Terra Nova (BA), to the ethylene processing unit, were also took into account, in addition to the respective utilities. Scenarios S1– S4 were structured from independent interventions. This opened up the prospect so the pool of possible proposal combinations for improving the environmental SLES 3EO manufacturing chain performance could be expanded without breaching RECP concept requirements. Thus, two (or more) proposals were rearranged, giving rise to the sequencing indicated in Table 2 in the form of the scenarios S5 – S11. The procedure followed in order to combine the proposals that were not mutually exclusive was based on the investigation conducted by Leis et al. (2017)."
7,Environmental and energetic indicators integration,"2.6 Environmental and energetic indicators integration The decision-making context in which the results of this study can be applied led to a joint analysis of the environmental and energy indicators of each scenario, in order to provide more conclusive results regarding the CP proposal effects on the SLES 3EO processing cycle. Thus, a procedure similar to that adopted by Moore and Kulay (2019) was used in the treatment of a related situation. This consists in normalizing the impact indicators of each scenario, using the corresponding values obtained for the Baseline Scenario as reference, as indicated in Equations (1) and (2). (1) E I i = ( I G W P , i I G W P , b l ) (2) E n I i = ( I P E D , i I P E D , b l ) where: E I i : environmental indicator for scenario i; I G W P , i : Global Warming Potential for scenario i; I G W P , b l : Global Warming Potential for the Baseline Scenario; E n I i : energy indicator for scenario i; I P E D , i : cumulative Primary Energy Demand for scenario i; I P E D , b l : cumulative Primary Energy Demand for the Baseline Scenario. Once the normalization of the indicators was completed, a Combined Indicator ( C I i ) specific to each scenario was then calculated via Equation (3). (3) C I i = E I i × E n I i The determination of ( C I i ) goes beyond the formulation of a single performance index for each scenario under study. By associating normalized results for the environmental and energy scales of each situation, it is also expected to identify synergies and incompatibility that the CP proposals are able to provide on the manufacturing cycle of SLES 3EO. After testing different options, the multiplication of ( E I i ) by ( E n I i ) proved to be a more adequate way of describing the effect of magnitude of this interaction, than the sum of the same indicators, or the geometric mean between them."
8,Results and discussion,"This section presents the outcomes of the research procedure depicted in Fig. 1. Comparison of each alternative proposal is also performed, in order to help future decision-making."
9,Environmental impact profile for the baseline scenario,"3.1 Environmental impact profile for the baseline scenario The application of the LCA technique considering the ‘cradle-to- gate’ approach and both the IPCC and Cumulative Energy Demand impact assessment methods led to the results presented in Table 3 . In terms of the Global Warming category, the largest cumulated contribution share is associated to the lauryl alcohol manufacturing chain, at 1.21 t CO2eq/RF representing about 65% of the accumulated result. In addition, 13% of the contributions for the category (239 kg CO2eq/RF) were derived from the EO supply chain, while the other 15% (278 kg CO2eq/RF) are due to the production of the steam consumed for the synthesis of SLES 3EO. A discrete analysis from the same performance revealed that land use changes for palm cultivation represent 22% of the total impact in terms of Global Warming (410 kg CO2eq/RF). Activities regarding palm cultivation represent about 20% (367 kg CO2eq/RF) and around 16% come from the exploitation and burning of fossil fuels for thermal energy generation. Road transport along the entire production chain contributes with 10% (196 kg CO2eq/RF), and 7.6% (142 kg CO2eq/RF) are inherited from electricity generation in Brazil. Finally, almost 3.7% (69.2 kg CO2eq/RF) come specifically from the EO synthesis, in addition to another 2.8% (53 kg CO2eq/RF) due to transoceanic PKO transportation from Asia to Brazil. The results obtained for Primary Energy Demand indicate that 44% of the impacts for this category originate from non-renewable sources (fossil, nuclear and biomass). The most significant contributions within this compartment (∼82%) occur in the form of Primary Energy Demand intrinsic to Non-renewable, fossil. Approximately 69% (17.8 GJ/RF) of this total is associated to the natural gas life cycle, whose utilization by the productive arrangement occurs in the form of EO processing inputs and heat generation sources. Another 29% of the effects of Non-renewable, fossil (7.46 GJ/RF) refers to crude oil extraction, which is applied to the fuel processing used by this productive chain, mainly with regard to terrestrial and transoceanic transport operations. Finally, it is also important to highlight the adverse effect of deforestation actions on palm production, which are fully responsible for the system performance in relation to Non-renewable, biomass. Regarding the renewable compartment, the prevalence of Primary Energy Demand inherent to Renewable, biomass is noted, which, in fact, represents the higher individual contribution (51.6%) to the total impact of the category. The energy demand related to Renewable, biomass is almost totally linked to photosynthetic processes, which, therefore, occurs naturally during palm and sugar cane cultivation. In 2011, the temporal coverage applied for this study, the Brazilian electricity matrix presented 6.6% biomass participation, obtained mainly from sugarcane bagasse (EPE, 2012). Results achieved by this research are compatible with those obtained by Schowanek et al. (2018) for the production of 1.0 t of C12–C14 sodium alkyl sulfate and C12–C14 sodium alkyl ether sulfate 2EO, despite differences regarding scope definition for each study. In those cases, impacts related to Global Warming reached, respectively, 1.63 and 1.18 t CO2eq/t, while Primary Energy Demand contributions were of 66.8 and 55.1 GJ/t. Part of the existing gap between performances can be explained by the specific geographic coverage of each study which, for the situation explored by Schowanek et al. comprised the European Union (EU-28) domain. Furthermore, the trends observed herein are in accordance to those reported by Shah et al. (2016) and Van Lieshout et al. (2015). Both initiatives highlighted the influence of agricultural practices and thermal energy production on the final results. In general, taking into account both analyzed impacts, the main contributions related to the SLES 3EO supply chain have their origins associated with three production stages: (i) Lauryl alcohol synthesis from PKO (renewable), with respective contributions from land use changes and activities regarding palm cultivation in Asia, and the transoceanic PKO transport to Brazil; (ii) Thermal energy generation, due to the impacts from fossil fuel burning for steam production; and (iii) Ethylene oxide manufacturing, due to its fossil origin."
10,Environmental impact profile for the alternative scenarios,"3.2 Environmental impact profile for the alternative scenarios With the definition of alternative scenarios, the LCA technique was once again applied under a ‘cradle-to-gate’ approach. The performances expected for each situation regarding Global Warming and Primary Energy Demand impacts, updated from the incorporation of the improvement proposals are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 . An examination of the results depicted in Fig. 3 points to S4 as the worst among the analyzed options in relation to Global Warming. This is followed by the S10 and Baseline scenarios as unfavorable performance benchmarks. On the other hand, S6 and S8 are positive highlights among the CP proposals presented to reduce SLES 3EO production impacts. A closer analysis of the same parameters suggests that the lauryl alcohol origin would still exert an important influence on the performance of the system in terms of Global Warming. This finding is justified by the fact that scenarios comprising PKO imported from Malaysia (specifically in the Baseline Scenario and S4) presented the worst expected results. The use of natural gas as a heat production source would revert in significant Global Warming contributions. This option may, albeit in part, be held accountable for the unfavorable performances of Baseline Scenario, S4 and S10 for this category. Still within the same sphere, and contrary to what might be supposed beforehand, EO processing from petrochemical source would provide benefits to the SLES 3EO manufacturing chain. The use of this alternative dampened the adverse effects of PKO imports and the use of natural gas to the Baseline Scenario performance, thus justifying its prevalence in a direct comparison with S4. EO synthesis via a fossil source would also be decisive in the impact generated by S6 in the form of Global Warming, 8.8% lower than that obtained for S8. On the other hand, in case PKO would be processed in Brazil, in S1, S6 and S8, Global Warming impacts would always reduce when compared to Baseline, S3 and S11, whose composition differed from the former only due to the PKO origin. This positive result derives from two factors, which culminate in the reduction of GHG emissions from some of these systems. These include: (i) the lack of deforestation for the installation of palm plantations in Brazil, and (ii) a shorter distance between the oil producing areas and the petrochemical industry plant. Thus, synergies could be noted in S6 and S8, resulting in 55% and 52% reductions in Global Warming contributions in relation to the Baseline Scenario, respectively. The values obtained for Primary Energy Demand (Fig. 4) suggest an opposite behavior. In this case, the lowest accumulated impact amount would refer to the scenario with most contribution of fossil inputs (i.e., S2 comprising 95% of non-renewable PED). Moreover, scenarios comprising predominance of fossil resources demand presented better expected performances. That would be the cases of S9, S10 and S11, comprising respectively 85%, 86% and 68% of non-renewable PED. Such results reinforce the discussion presented by Secchi et al. (2016), who pointed out the possibility of increasing environmental impacts due to the substitution of fossil inputs with their renewable counterparts. The influence of the Lauryl Alcohol origin is again a decisive element. This is relevant, as S11 still would accumulate an advantageous result in relation to Primary Energy Demand in spite of adopting biomass for heat generation and EO production from a renewable source. In this case, S11 (52.0 GJ/RF) would occupy the same level of PED as S2 (51.4 GJ/RF), whose productive cycle would be mostly fossil dependent. This is because the Lauryl Alcohol would derive from a fossil source in both cases, despite this transformation being carried out in the USA. Considering this impact category, the use of natural gas for heat generation and of renewable assets in the EO productive cycle are expected to present less influence than that exerted by the Lauryl Alcohol life cycle on the overall result. This can be proven by comparing the S2 performance to S3 (76.5 GJ/RF), S4 (86.0 GJ/RF) and S7 (79.6 GJ/RF), which presented the worst results of the whole series. S3 and S4 differ from each other precisely in relation to thermal energy sources and the EO processing, while have in common the PKO origin. As it would still be imported from Malaysia, this asset would remain generating significant contributions to the overall Primary Energy Demand. This would not be observed in S2, as this latter scenario would demand fossil Lauryl Alcohol. S7 displays a structural similarity to S4, except for the PKO origin. When comparing their profiles, it is possible to conclude that, at least in relation to energy demand, obtaining PKO from crops grown in Brazil would be a more favorable alternative than importing this asset from Malaysia. As highlighted for the Baseline scenario, the performance of PKO produced in Malaysia would be affected again by deforestation practices occurring during palm cultivation, accounting for 4.1 GJ/RF in terms of non-renewable energy demand also in S3, S4 and S5. On the other hand, such results would not be observed in the scenarios comprising palm cultivation in Brazil, as a result of compulsory agroecological restrictions. Scenarios including the substitution of natural gas with biomass for the purpose of heat generation (S3, S5, S6, S8, S9 and S11), would present an invariable increase in Primary Energy Demand contributions. This oscillation would be largely due to the lower efficiency of solid fuel burning, with a comparison carried out to its congener in the gas phase. Such a discrepancy predisposes the consumption of high amounts of biomass to meet the thermal demands of the process, which is reverted to equivalent Primary Energy Demand depletions. Finally, Fig. 4 also highlight the energy demand in terms of the category Renewable, water. Contribution to this category would be mainly due to the high share of hydropower on the electricity consumed by the industrial activities occurring in Brazil, and also the production of steam. Therefore, scenarios comprising the production of Lauryl Alcohol in the USA would present a slightly better result regarding this category."
11,Carbon Footprint considerations,"3.3 Carbon Footprint considerations The impact assessment model proposed by the IPCC to estimate impacts in terms of Global Warming assumes the concept of ‘neutral natural carbon’. According to this approach, the CO2 rates absorbed by crops from the environment due to photosynthetic action (CO2,fix), as well as contributions of the same nature (as CO2) of biogenic origin (CO2,bg) are not considered (IPCC, 2013). Alternatively, an evaluation has been carried out on how the environmental performance of Global Warming would be recorded if the CO2,fix and CO2,bg contributions were also considered. This approach is based on the guidelines presented by the ISO 14067 standard (ISO, 2018), which deals with the determination of product Carbon Footprint. In this context, Fig. 5 presents the absolute Global Warming Potential results for the SLES 3EO production scenarios analyzed herein, as well as the adjusted result from the accounting of the portions associated to biogenic activity. In order to carry out these estimates, an impact factor for CO2,fix = (−) 1.00 kg CO2eq/kg CO2,fix and CO2,bg = 1.00 kg CO2eq/kg CO2,bg was taken into account. This decision was based on three hypotheses: (i) CO2 is considered a standard substance by the model and, therefore, receives an impact factor IF = 1.00 (IPCC, 2013); (ii) the same substance (CO2) is considered in both cases, although from different origins (air and agricultural crops); and (iii) the reference framework for emission quantification was placed in the environment; therefore, withdrawals receive a negative signal. By incorporating CO2,bg and CO2,fix, contributions, the analysis demonstrates a change in the Baseline Scenario impact profiles, as well as the scenarios presenting increases in biomass use, resulting in significant CO2eq emission reductions in the adjusted Carbon Balance compared to the values obtained according to the original IPCC approach. For the Baseline Scenario, this reduction was of about 51%, driven by CO2 removal (– 2.67 t CO2,fix/RF) due to the palm cultivation used as raw material. This decrease was not higher because the thermal energy used for PKO extraction and processing originates from biomass burning, which led to a 1.72 t CO2,bg/RF increase of the final result. Regarding S1, the replacement of the palm cultivation site would resulted in a 1.31 t CO2eq/RF reduction in relation to the original result obtained according to the IPCC method. Aforementioned factors such as the prohibition of palm cultivation in Brazilian forest areas due to agroecological palm zoning restrictions and concentrations of agricultural and industrial complexes in contiguous regions explain not only the magnitude of this decrease, but also, the advantage of S1 compared to the Baseline Scenario. Regarding S2, the accounting of the CO2,bg and CO2,fix contributions did not influence the Carbon Balance results. This behavior was observed because the PKO substitution by petrochemical lauryl alcohol would lead to a drastic reduction of contributions associated to biogenic activity. In this case, CO2,bg and CO2,fix would result only from the electricity consumed over the life cycle under analysis. Adjusted Carbon Balance indicator for S3 was 75% lower than the value originally obtained according to the IPCC approach. Although the use of biomass for thermal energy generation as a substitute for natural gas would imply in an increase of 37% in terms of the CO2,fix indicator, (resulting in – 3.64 t CO2,fix/RF), promoting biomass combustion could also lead to a 45% increase in CO2,bg emissions, which ended up mitigating the benefits of this scenario. In S4, the incorporation of renewable ethylene oxide would result in a 66% decrease in the Carbon Balance indicator compared to the initial result of the same scenario. This can also be explained by the increase in the renewable asset fraction in the life cycle compared to the Baseline Scenario, implying in higher carbon sequestration rates. On the other hand, CO2,bg emissions associated to the sugarcane cultivation and ethanol production stages (2.69 t CO2,bg/RF) would be relevant for the Adjusted Carbon Balance composition. Results presented in Fig. 5 also indicate the possibility of a strong synergy when two (or more) Cleaner Production proposals are considered within the SLES 3EO production cycle. However, this is valid only when the surfactant would be produced from vegetable oil (S5, S6, S7 and S8, respectively). For such circumstances, the Adjusted Carbon Balance would always result negative. It is worth noting that the best result for the entire set would be the one by S8, a scenario that registers the maximum biomass participation and association with Brazilian PKO manufacture. On the other hand, it is not surprising that the scenarios involving SLES 3EO production from lauryl alcohol of a petrochemical origin (S2, S9, S10 and S11) would lead to low impact results for Global Warming when these effects were estimated by the method proposed by the ISO 14067 standard. This is due to the fact that, in these situations, the difference between CO2,bg and CO2,fix would be insignificant when compared to the total impact value without these plots being computed."
12,Environmental and energy indicators coupling,"3.4 Environmental and energy indicators coupling The fact that no proposal prevailed over any other in both verified environmental impacts only reinforces the importance of evaluating the environmental ( E I i ) and energy indicators ( E n I i ) for each scenario together. The results of this action are represented in Table 4 in the form of Combined Indicators ( C I i ) referring to all the situations assessed herein. Considering this set, S6 and S8 would present the best results due to their CP proposals resulting in significant reductions in Global Warming impacts without significantly compromising performance in terms of Primary Energy Demand. This condition is based on PKO processing in Brazil and the adoption of biomass for generation of the steam consumed in the industrial units. As a result, the normalized Energy Demand results remained close to those of the Baseline Scenario. Another possibility that would also result in promising ( C I i ) values arises from the performance balance of both analysis dimensions. This level of improvement could be achieved by S1, S2, S9 and S11. S1 displayed greater dissonance between Global Warming and Primary Energy Demands compared to the other assessed scenarios. While S1 grounded its advances in the use of Brazilian PKO and in the application of fossil assets for heat generation and EO synthesis, the other scenarios – whose individual results are more harmonic – have in common the fact that lauryl alcohol would come from a petrochemical source. It should also be noted that ( E n I i ) improvements in these scenarios would result from a restricted biomass consumption due to their approximations with the petrochemical chain. The values displayed in Table 4 also suggest that the use of a lauryl alcohol production route using PKO as an intermediate tends to present the highest ( E n I i ) values. This behavior is potentiated when PKO is associated with the consumption of renewable EO as in S4, S5, S7 and S8, due to the high Primary Energy Demand for biomass cultivation. Finally, S4 results reinforce the environmental and energy disadvantages of considering PKO production in Asia, making use of sugarcane as an input for EO production and applying natural gas to thermal energy generation."
13,Conclusions,"This study evaluated the environmental and energy effects of Cleaner Production proposals applied to the SLES 3EO production chain. To do so, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique was applied considering an attributional perspective and with a cradle-to-gate’ scope for a Reference Flow of 1.0 ton of surfactant. Results deriving from the Baseline Scenario enabled the creation of eleven proposals whose structuring was based on the Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP) philosophy. The environmental dimension was represented by impacts in the form of Global Warming, determined by two distinct approaches: (i) the one proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and (ii) formulated through the ISO 14067 standard. Energy dimension performance was quantified as Primary Energy Demand applying the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) method. It was observed that the SLES 3EO environmental performance is largely influenced by: (i) Lauryl alcohol production from palm kernel oil, with contributions from palm cultivation in Asia, and transoceanic transport from PKO to Brazil. This supply chain accounts for 62% of the Global Warming indicator results; (ii) Thermal energy production, due to the burning of fossil fuels for steam generation in industrial processes occurring in Brazil. It was observed that this is the main driver for non-renewable Primary Energy Demand impacts; and (iii) Ethylene oxide supply chain, due to the use of ethylene from fossil origin in its processing. This chain was responsible for 13% of the Climate Change final result, as well as significant fossil resource demands. From these indications, it was then possible to delineate potential solutions to improve the environmental performance of SLES 3EO. These were then modeled based on the Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production philosophy and organized in the form of scenarios. The Carbon Footprint assessment according to the ISO 14067 standard indicates the possibility of beneficial change in the impact profiles between the scenarios presenting renewable source assets participating in their life cycle, with a strong reduction in relation to the results obtained by applying the IPCC approach. The expected improvement was not more significant due to CO2,bg emissions resulting from biomass burning. The combined assessment of environmental and energy indicators points out that the best alternative proposals would be those comprised respectively by S6, S8, S9 and S11. These scenarios share the common assumptions of both: (i) consider biomass as the main source for thermal energy; and (ii) refrain from consuming PKO from Malaysia and Indonesia. Conversely, two of the scenarios including palm cultivation in these countries (Baseline and S4) presented the worst results. Such observations endorse the idea that the substitution of natural gas with biomass, as well as the interruption of PKO demand from Malaysia and Indonesia should be treated as priority actions to be implemented by this sector in Brazil. Moreover, the results presented in this study also suggest an advantage of the PKO produced in Brazil over the importation of lauryl alcohol synthesized in the USA. It could also be observed that the production of ethylene oxide from ethanol from sugarcane would lead to poor results in the combined evaluation of environmental and energy indicators. This implies that adopting such a production route would not be a good strategy at this time, considering the level of maturity of the technology. On the other hand, it should be noted that the production of ethanol from sugarcane is a recognized practice of Cleaner Production, and that is also considered as a symbol of industrial symbiosis in many situations. Therefore, this finding may be conditioned to the circumstances of the study, making premature the conclusions derived from it. In this way, it is recommended that such aspect be investigated in more detail. By investigating an intermediary surfactant widely demanded for cleaning product formulations through a systemic point of view instead of consolidated detergent production, this study presents an unusual approach. Nevertheless, this perspective acknowledges the importance of SLES 3EO as a relevant input of the Specialty Chemical Industry, so that a variety of research initiatives regarding other consumer goods formulations can benefit from the results of this study. Additionally, this is a pioneer initiative considering the Brazilian context, as the results presented in the present study represent current industrial practices occurring in Brazil. Therefore, further extrapolations to other countries should not be performed without proper assessment and adaptations."
