0,Introduction,"In terms of production volume, polymeric materials pertaining to all technical materials currently constitute the greatest proportion of manufacturing and consumption. Their enormous utilization by industries and consumers has resulted in significant environmental pollution; these materials rank among the most widespread foreign particles discovered in the environment (Horton and Dixon, 2018). To place them in context, they are referred to as polymeric xenobiotics in environmental literature (Moore, 2008). For substances of this type, it is useful to discern whether they are comprised of the following: a) Plastics - This term generally relates to materials formed primarily of organic macromolecular substances (polymers). In addition to substances that are polymeric in nature, plastics contain additives so as to elicit a specific modification to a process or subsequent property. A range of publications concern the environmental fate of these additives and their impact on the ecosystem, often confirming that such substances are persistent and bio accumulative (e.g., phthalates or brominated flame retardants) (Rist et al., 2018). Other negative impacts exerted by plastics and micro-plastics on ecosystems should not be ignored; for instance, if such plastic waste occurs in seas and oceans, it may be colonized by organisms that attach themselves to it, potentially leading to these organisms being introduced by marine currents into areas outside their native ranges, thereby distorting biodiversity and threatening native species. Additionally, the accumulation of plastics at the bottom of oceans and seas, or rivers and lakes, may restrict the diffusion of gases between the liquid and solid state of the bottom of said body of water, resulting in the inhibition of benthic organisms (Wright et al., 2013; Moore, 2008). b) Polymers – these relate to organic macromolecular substances that are applied in pure form in real life, i.e., without additives. Of these, water-soluble synthetic polymers form a specific group, one often ignored since they are essentially “invisible”. The majority of these have been subject to a number of clinical and toxicological studies. However, information of an environmental nature is completely absent, in contrast to compounds of the type referred to as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), because synthetic polymeric substances appear to be biologically inactive and generally non-toxic. Important examples include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Since the second half of the twentieth century, both have been widely adopted by the industrial sector due to their physico-chemical and toxicological properties, recently entering into use in households, too. While they exhibit no direct toxic effect on organisms in the concentrations applied, the potential exists for them to increase the mobility of toxic metals or organic pollutants in the individual constituents of the environment; made possible through the complexation characteristics and surfactant effects of the said polymers. Furthermore, such xenobiotics may disturb the natural cycle of substances in the ecosystem. The current state of pollution affecting ecosystems by polymer xenobiotics means that society has become aware in recent decades that necessary measures have to be taken. Data on the extent of the danger posed, if combined with study and analysis conducted in a holistic manner, shall afford the opportunity to either cease or slow down the current negative trend and formulate acceptable measures to ensure that the matter is under control. Although it is beyond the scope of the present study to detail every issue associated with water-soluble polymeric xenobiotics, it can still serve as a guide to discerning an economically viable solution, thus providing a foundation for further research."
1,Basic characteristics and the environmental importance of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mowiol®, Poval®, Sloviol®, Elvanol®, E 1203) was discovered in 1915 by F. Klatt. Under conditions of normal temperature and pressure, it takes the form of powdery white crystalline matter, usually produced by alkaline hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate. From a chemical perspective, PVA primarily has the structure of 1,3-glycol and is classified as a polyvinyl acetate. Core variables affecting the behaviour of PVA in the environment comprise the extent of polymerization and hydrolysis/re-esterification, in addition to stereo regularity (Fukae et al., 1994) and crystallinity. The solubility of PVA in water and resistance to organic solvents stand out as the most important and interesting qualities. However, it is important to realize that not every kind of PVA is soluble in water to the same extent. Such solubility depends upon various factors: the size of the macromolecules; the number of OH groups that remain free in the molecule; how many acetate groups (Fig. 1 ) and aldehyde radicals are bound to it; and the extent to which etheric bonds are created in the molecule. In general, PVA that possesses a higher molecular weight is less soluble than derivatives at a lower stage of polymeration. The solubility of PVA is highly reliant upon the quantity of acetate groups in the molecule. Products with 5% content of acetate groups are insoluble in cold water, and only dissolve at 65–70 °C. When the content of acetate groups equals 12%, the said PVA is highly soluble in cold water. Where the content of acetate groups measures 20%–30%, the precipitation of PVA from the solution occurs at 30–35 °C. If the content of acetate groups is more than 50%, such a PVA becomes insoluble in water. Numerous products exist commercially that boast different degrees of hydrolysis and various molecular weights. For instance, to permit easier orientation, the German manufacturer Clariant GmbH labels its range of products by number, as follows: Mowiol® X-Y; where X indicates viscosity (Pa.s) corresponding to molecular weight, and Y denotes the degree of hydrolysis (SH) of the said PVA. PVA is also interesting from a biological perspective, as it is highly reminiscent of gelatine in behaviour. Consequently, it has been widely adopted in the medicinal sphere, among others, because the human organism is able to tolerable it without difficulty. Nevertheless, it has been reported that in such medicinal use, under certain circumstances, products boasting a high degree of polymeration may prove toxic to the human organism. In terms of environmental protection, the aforementioned stereo regularity is also crucial, i.e., the arrangement of the polyvinyl alcohol chain that affects PVA synthesis. This was investigated by Fukae et al. (1994), who monitored the biodegradation of syndiotactic and isotactic PVA by micro-organisms present in activated sludge and by cultures adapted to PVA and identified as Pseudomonas sp. A-41. The said authors confirmed that enzymatic systems are more efficient in attacking arranged sequences and lesser polymeric fractions. PVA with high isotacticity (prepared in a laboratory) was easier to degrade in comparison with commercial PVA (Poval®HC, Kuraray Co. Ltd, Japan). It is worth emphasizing the capacity PVA to adsorb into soil particles and naturally occurring minerals (Chiellini et al., 2000). Indeed, such naturally occurring minerals are often used as nano-fillers when preparing nano-composites based on PVA. According to research by Spiridon et al. (2008) and Tang et al. (2008), the given content of nano-fillers of the montmorillonite/diatomaceous earth type may negatively affect the biodegradability of such a nano-composite. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Povidone®, Polyvidone®, Povidonum®, Kollidon®, E 1201) was patented by W. Repp in 1939. Under conditions of normal temperature and pressure, PVP takes the form of a white or pale yellow powdery material, varied in particle size. Chemically, it is a polymeric lactam with an internal acid bond and is classified as a poly-N-vinylamide. Its amphoteric characteristic (Antić et al., 2011) is an important quality, which is determined by the structure of the monomer unit (Fig. 1). The heavily polar amide group boasts hydrophilic and polar properties. Non-polar methylene groups in the main chain and ring possess hydrophobic properties. The substances in which PVP dissolves well include water. Indeed, as molecular weight increases, the rate of dissolution decreases and the viscosity of the solution also rises (Robinson et al., 1990). How various industrial sectors actually apply PVP is determined by the given molecular weight, which varies from 2500–1,200,000 g/mol, as well as particle size and pH. PVP is also important from a biological perspective because its structural characteristics are similar to those of proteins; it is also a bio- and haemocompatible agent with low toxicity. Initially, PVP was used in World War II as a substitute for blood plasma. Numerous studies on PVP metabolization and excretion after intravenous administration have showed that both the rate and scope of exclusion from the body via urine depend on molecular weight. The polymer is not metabolized by the organism; instead it has been observed, after intravenous administration, that a modest amount of high molecular weight compounds accumulate in the body without any apparent toxicological effect. For this reason, it ceased to be used as a substitute for plasma shortly after the war, even though its characteristics made it ideal for this purpose. Today, PVP is contained within a number of medicines, foodstuffs and food supplements. The acute, sub-chronic and chronic toxicity of PVP is extremely low if administered orally. In fact, merely a laxative effect was observed if the dosage was high. In addition, accumulation of PVP in the mesenteric lymph nodes was uniquely observed, but without any toxicological significance. From 1987 onwards, the World Health Organization established the value for acceptable daily intake for soluble PVP in foodstuffs as 0–50 mg/kg of body weight. In the European Union, soluble PVP, labelled E1201, and with a nominal K-value of 25, 30 and 90, is utilized to produce food supplements, pills, and sweeteners. The only toxicological effect to have been observed was for repeated applications under the skin of large doses of such a polymer with a high molecular weight. Cytotoxic dermal tests carried out on rabbits (using a compress manufactured from hydrogel) have shown that hydrogels containing PVP do not exert a toxic effect upon direct contact with skin. This finding contributed to the decision to incorporate PVP in cosmetics. From the perspective of environmental protection, the capacity of PVP to bind phenolic substances - including humic acids - is notable, as is potential sorption into naturally occurring minerals. This is confirmed by studies focused on PVP sorption into smectites, illites, kaolins and montmorillonites (Blum and Eberl, 2004). A description has also been made as to the mechanism of binding PVP by Van der Waals forces/hydrogen bonds to kaolin saturated with sodium chloride (Israel et al., 2001); indeed, the influence of the salinity of the solution also was duly noted. This goes to shows that, as with PVA, the sorption of PVP into minerals could prove significant in the preparation of nano-composites. Such findings are a consequence of the aforementioned physico-chemical and toxicological properties of PVA and PVP, which is why the materials have been applied in industry and other areas of human activity since the mid-twentieth century. Both polymers comprise components of a multitude of products commonly utilized by industries and households. This implies that such a massive use of PVA and PVP could pose a considerable and major environmental problem. In fact, it may particularly affect the very environmental constituents in which PVA and PVP might accumulate, depending on the entry routes and transformation processes underway in such a constituent of the ecosystem."
2,Threats to individual constituents of the ecosystem and description of a solution,"The very production and distribution of PVA and PVP (Fig. 2 ) constitute their primary input into the entire ecosystem. Although the treatment of these substances is governed by law, it cannot be excluded that contamination of the environment occurs as a result of improper use on the premises of production facilities. The gravity of the situation was highlighted by the Fabbri scientific team when monitoring in 2000 (Fabbri et al., 2000) and 2001 (Fabbri, 2001). The scientists gauged the content of synthetic polymers - including PVA - in samples of soils collected at Pialassa Baron, an industrial estate in Italy. In order to detect the given substances, they used pyrolysis gas chromatography with mass detection (Py-GC/MS). The results raised concerns; out of all the samples, at least one of the surveyed polymers was detected, including PVA. Fig. 2 hints at possible entry routes of these substances into the environment from various spheres of anthropogenic activity. Looking at each of the entries in more detail, it is evident that the greatest quantity of PVA and PVP comes from mass-consumed materials. In this regard, the following can be considered the most important sources of transference: 1. Agriculture, where there is direct application of products to any environmental constituent, i.e., direct entry (I). In agriculture (A1), PVA and PVP form a proportion of certain pesticide products or fertilisers, developed for either gradual release of the active substance or for treating seeds by applying the active substance to the same; they are also used in materials for so-called seeding tapes. In addition, fishing or angling should be mentioned, since PVA is frequently used in the production of nets, bags and special packages for the preparation of bait. 2. A wastewater treatment plant (II) receiving waste water from households or industries. In industrial applications (A2), PVA and PVP help make-up various types of adhesives, paints and other materials. In households (A3), they are frequently found in everyday articles such as detergents, coatings on capsules or tablets of washing and cleaning products utilized by washing-machines and dishwashers. They are also found in a wide range of personal care products (B1), to which they are added for concentration purposes or to serve as dispersion and film-forming substances. They can be even found in foodstuffs (B2) as stabilizers for polymeric colouring agents in confectionery products and drinks or as antioxidants. Last but not least, both polymers find applications in the pharmaceutical industry (B3), where they have been adopted as a coating material for capsules and enzymatic/vitamin stabilisers; they also appear in contact lens solutions or solutions for dental hygiene. Robinson et al. (1990) stated that, after ingestion, the substances pass through the organism unchanged and are eliminated (1) via faeces (PVP) or urine (PVA), thus combining with household waste water. In locations with a drainage system, the water is drained away into a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), where combination with PVA/PVP in industrial wastewater occurs (A2). The presence of PVP in urban waste water was confirmed in a report by Antić et al. (2011), who analysed samples of the same entering a WWTP in Achen in 2007–2008 by Py-GC/MS. The PVP levels ranged from 0.9 to 7.1 mg/L. However, the process of treatment may not eliminate PVA and PVP effectively; in many cases, both substances pass through the plant unchanged (Trimpin et al., 2001; Bühler, 2005). The same was confirmed in a monitoring study by Antić et al. (2011), which focused on the PVP content in the River Ruhr (Düren, Germany). While samples of analysed river water collected prior to the outfall from the WWTP did not contain PVP, those collected 10 m and 50 m downstream of the outfall from the said WWTP contained 0.18 and 0.16 mg/L of PVP, respectively. On this basis, two possible routes of contamination of the ecosystem can be assumed. Route 1 (2) is supported by the capture (sorption) of both substances in the biomass of the activated sludge that is subsequently stabilized. Usually, synthetic polymers are not prone to anaerobic processes that take place when stabilizing activated sludge, so they can be found unchanged in the subsequently digested sludge (4), even following the treatment procedure. If stabilized sludge is utilized as a secondary fertilizer in agriculture, these substances directly enter the soil. If the sludge is disposed of at landfills, both PVA and PVP may enter landfill waters, which later drain into the WWTP. Route 2 (3) involves the passage of PVA and PVP throughout the treatment process with minimal capture occurring in the biomass of the activated sludge. As a result, both of the substances enter surface waters, where they can accumulate, ultimately posing a potential risk to the ecosystem. 3. Unconsumed products (III) represent the last remaining possible source of transference of both polymers, happening through municipal waste being dumped at a landfill. In the case of controlled landfills, polymers enter leaching landfill waters, which always drain into a WWTP. At uncontrolled landfill sites, or when the bed of the refuse site is damaged, landfill waters soak into the environment of the bedrock, causing contamination of both soil and groundwater. A secondary risk relates to excessive dust levels. Both polymers can, through their capacity for sorption, stick to particles of dust that enter suspension. Thus, the polymers add to air pollution and constitute a possible source of direct entry of PVA and PVP not only into the soil, but also into the water and air. It is clear that these substances pose a certain risk to the environment. Therefore, it is logical to endeavour to reduce the transmission of PVP and PVA into constituents of the ecosystem in order to reduce the burden of xenobiotics on the ecosystem. The previously provided information would permit the following options to tackle the situation: a) Legislative restrictions on the use of these substances. Such a solution is currently not realistic, as insufficient data is available on their accumulation in the environment and the harm they cause; b) Compensation for other substances that do not pose a risk to the environment. Considering the excellent physico-chemical and technological properties of these polymers, hence their widespread use by certain branches of industry, neither producers nor consumers are forced to seek alternatives to them; c) Blending polymers with a biodegradable substrate/substance supporting biodegradation of the polymer itself (Verma and Fortunati, 2018). From the perspective of environmental protection, this seems the most viable technological solution for particular applications. It could be introduced relatively quickly, at minimal cost and with little modification to existing processing equipment. Numerous environmentally acceptable substances exist, from substrates sourced from renewables, to media of secondary raw materials. However, prior to selecting any such biodegradable substrate for the mixture, it is necessary to discern the relevant physico-chemical and processing properties. This knowledge could inform the procedure for ascertaining any suitable applications of such systems (referred to as “mixtures”), as well as the fate of materials produced within individual constituents of the ecosystem. Choosing an appropriate biodegradable substrate for mixing with the polymer should neither be carried out randomly nor be subject to external pressures of economic or technological natures."
3,Solution for PVA – the said polymer is not biodegradable in all environmental compartments,"Over the decades, the biological degradation of pure PVA has received much worldwide attention. Since 1973, a number of bacterial strains have been isolated, with PVA constituting the sole source of carbon and energy. While initially these cultures were identified as members of the Pseudomonas genus, degradation strains are now also known to belong to the Alcaligenes, Bacillus, and Sphingomonas genera (Měrková et al., 2018; Yamatsu et al., 2006). However, unlike micro-organisms involved in activities such as degrading aliphatic polyesters that are polyhydroxyalcanoate or poly-lactic acid in nature, PVA-degrading micro-organisms are not found in every constituent of the ecosystem, as reported in the literature (Yamatsu et al., 2006). Studies have reported on isolating PVA-degrading bacteria from a setting previously contaminated by PVA, such as waste water stemming from the textile industry (Fukae et al., 1994; Mori et al., 1996; Qian et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006, 2017). Generally, in uncontaminated environments, such bacteria are either considered to occur to a minimal extent or are simply not present. As a result, in uncontaminated environments, PVA degradation happens only following a certain period of adaptation, or does not even take place in the worst possible scenario (Chiellini et al., 2003). Even in settings where the appropriate micro-organisms are present, the process is slow (e.g., in WWTP), which is why much endeavour has been directed towards determining how to speed up such degradation; most frequently, the suggestion is to prepare mixtures of PVA with natural polymers (a biodegradable substrate). However, for these mixtures to be adopted commercially, they must prove easy to process, have characteristics comparable with conventional types of plastic and be competitively priced. In this regard, polysaccharides are considered prospective substrates for PVA that originate from waste materials (e.g., lignin cellulose) or renewable energy sources (e.g., starch, cellulose, chitin and derivatives thereof). Also of interest commercially are polysaccharides of microbial origin (xanthan gum, gellan gum and dextran, or pullulan and glucan). This particular topic has benefitted from a great deal of attention in recent years (Teodorescu et al., 2018). Most often, the properties of mixtures comprising PVA and starch have been studied; in addition to which, the following combinations have been prepared and tested: PVA and chitin (Mok et al., 2017); chitosan (Vega-Cázarez et al., 2018); pectin (Kaczmarek and Vuković-Kwiatkowska, 2011); chitosan and gelatine/oxidized pectin (Chetouani et al., 2017; Tripathi et al., 2010); nanospherical cellulose (Ibrahim et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011); and cellulose nanocrystals and chitosan (El Miri et al., 2015). However, not all of these authors investigated the biological degradation of the said PVA mixtures. Indeed, if it was examined (Zhang et al., 2011), then the percentage of degradation of the mixture generally equalled the actual content of polysaccharide. The said authors noted that a mixture with approximately 23% cellulose brought about ca 20% biodegradation. Similar results were recorded by Ramesan et al. (2018), who analysed mixtures prepared on the basis of poly(vinyl alcohol), cashew tree gum and pumice particles. In the case of the above substrates, PVA is only partially replaced in the finished material, which unfortunately does not address its poor biodegradability. In this context, an option suggested in the literature (Spiridon et al., 2008; Yun et al., 2008) is to carry out enzymatic hydrolysis of PVA by α-amylase, which is produced by micro-organisms during the decomposition of starch. Yun et al. (2008) stated that more than 5% of the degradation of pure PVA was achieved over 48 h through enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of α-amylase; the degree of hydrolysis (SH) equalled 99%. The same percentage of PVA degradation (SH 98%) was achieved by Corti et al. (2002), when PVA was biologically degraded in a soil environment, albeit during a period of 50 days. The positive influence of α-amylase was also indicated in results announced by Julinová et al. (2010). This study (Julinová et al., 2010) investigated the effect of starch within mixtures - composed of PVA (SH 88%), corn starch and glycerol - on the biodegradation of PVA in an aerobic aqueous medium of activated sludge originating from a WWTP. Prior to commencing the biodegradation experiments, the sludge was first adapted to PVA under laboratory conditions. The extent of elimination of PVA (in percent) was evaluated by the spectrophotometric determination of PVA alone in the reaction suspension. It was found that the presence of starch in the mixture positively influenced the rate of degradation of PVA solely (evaluated by a formula for first-order kinetics); concurrently, a significant reduction was witnessed in the overall period of degradation. According to these observations, starch can be considered more than just a filler in a polymer mixture, as it even contributes to inducing the biodegradation of PVA. Despite such promising findings, the direct effect of starch on the degradation of PVA has yet to be studied in depth. Starch is usually added to the PVA matrix for reasons of economy, thereby diminishing the price of the resulting material. From this perspective, aspects relating to the technology applied and demands of the end-user outweigh the environmental impact of PVA/starch mixtures. This approach is evident from a paper by Lawton (1996), for example. Although this paper details the impact of individual types of starch (with varying ratios of amylopectin and amylase) on the mechanical properties of mixed PVA-based films (SH 98%) prepared under cold conditions, the biodegradability of the mixtures is completely ignored. In the case of PVA/starch mixtures, the physico-chemical properties of starch and the technological requirements for preparing the mixture may significantly affect the biodegradability of the mixtures. In this regard, the following factors play a substantial role: (a) starch grain morphology and particle size; (b) the additives used; (c) the crystallinity of the polymers, fillers and additives; (d) thermal treatment of the fillers; (e) chemical alteration of the starch; (f) PVA-starch cross-linking. (a) Starch grain morphology and particle size - small grains disperse better in the polymer and are more easily accessed by micro-organisms (Kupec et al., 2003). This is especially important for mixtures comprised of starch and high molecular weight PVA (SH exceeding 98%) that are insoluble in water and incredibly difficult to degrade biologically. For instance, granules of starch sourced from the Chenopodium quinoa and Amaranthus paniculatas plants, wherein grain size stands at less than 1 μm, appear to be suitable “starch” substrates. This type of starch would probably enable a more homogenous distribution in the polymeric matrix than starch from maize. On the basis of such an assumption, materials with a homogeneous distribution of starch might be expected to have a greater tendency to degrade. (b) Additives utilized - this primarily pertains to plasticizers that are assumed to easily undergo biodegradation. This group of substances includes compounds of both low and high molecular weights. The most frequently used substances are glycerol and water (Luo et al., 2012); others include sorbitol (Tian et al., 2017), urea (Tudorachi et al., 2000), citric acid (Zhou et al., 2009), polyols (Aydın and Ilberg, 2016) and glutaraldehyde (Ismail and Zaaba, 2011); additionally, comprehensive plasticizers exist, e.g., those made up of glycerol/urea (Zhou et al., 2009) or urea/formamide (Yan et al., 2015). Russo et al. (2009) studied the enzymatic degradation of thermo-plasticized starch (TPS) in extruded blends with PVA, which were plasticized with glycerol, sorbitol and mannitol. Degradation of the mixture was carried out by α-amylase and amyloglucosidase sourced from Bacillus licheniformis and Aspergillus niger, respectively. Their research showed that the type of plasticizer present in the PVA-TPS mixture significantly influenced the rate of hydrolysis of starch, while the rate of degradation of starch dropped in accordance with the type of polyol applied; the ranking was as follows: sorbitol > glycerol > maltitol. This fact also influenced the time in which the PVA-TPS mixture degraded. Yun and Yoon (2010) investigated the effect of plasticizers on the biodegradation of mixtures comprising PVA (SH 99%) and starches, which were mixed at the ratio 1:1 and subsequently plasticized by 40% glycerol or citric acid (expressed as a percentage by weight). Films were cast from the mixtures under cold conditions and left in the soil for 180 days. Utilizing data sourced from measurements, the authors found that citric acid achieved a higher percentage of degradation (an increase of up to 10%) compared with films that were plasticized with glycerol. (c) Crystallinity of polymers, fillers and additives – a primary factor affecting the biodegradability of polymers. Increasing the content of the amorphous phase in the polymer boosts the degree of biodegradation, since the amorphous structures of polymers are more easily accessed by biological agents. For example, Chiellini et al. (2003) stated that bacteria of the P. chrysosporium fungus clearly prefer amorphous sequences to crystalline sequences during the degradation of PVA. This is consistent with the conclusion reached by Yun and Yoon (2010), who observed a concurrent drop in the percentage of biological degradation of a mixture as the degree of crystallinity increased. They studied the effect exerted by the content of amylase in a starch on the biodegradability of mixtures of PVA (SH 99%) and starch in a soil environment; these were mixed at the ratio of 1:1. The extent of biological degradation was evaluated using a gravimeter. The results of the work make it apparent that the growing content of amylase in the samples boosted the degree of crystallinity of the PVA-starch mixtures. As for those containing starch with 74% amylase, the extent of biodegradation equalled approximately 60%, while mixtures containing starch with 21% amylase were degraded by approximately 80% during 180 days of study. (d) Thermal treatment of fillers - another factor influencing the biodegradability of polymer-starch mixtures. This procedure is applied to prepare thermally altered and extruded starches (starch plasticizing). Heating starch to a temperature exceeding 100 °C while applying high pressure in the extruder leads to the destruction of starch grains (due to the distortion of hydrogen bridges), elimination of molecular water and the total collapse of the alignment of higher-level molecular structures. As reported by Kupec et al. (2003), starch altered thermally in this manner is a source of organic carbon that is more available to microorganisms than native starch. (e) Chemical alteration of starch enables the production of hydrophobic films comprising biodegradable composites applicable for humid environments (Šárka et al., 2013). Under certain reaction conditions, starch can be prepared with a high degree of acetylation that reduces the rate of biodegradation of the mixture, thus negatively affecting overall biodegradation of the material significantly. For instance, Yun et al. (2008) examined the biodegradability of mixtures containing PVA (SH 99%) and corn starch cross-linked by polyphosphates prepared under cold conditions. The authors investigated enzymatic degradation of the mixtures by both α-amylase and β-amylase and amyloglucosidase, as well as degradation by pure cultures of the Bacillus subtilis bacterium and the Aspergillus niger sponge. The work included soil burial tests. For all biodegradation tests, a lower percentage of degradation was recorded for mixtures of PVA with chemically modified starch. (f) PVA-starch cross-linking is the last factor to be described herein that influences the biodegradation of PVA-starch mixtures. Despite a multitude of studies (Tang et al., 2008; Maiti et al., 2012; Kader et al., 2018) primarily addressing the potential of cross-linking PVA-starch mixtures by agents such as glutaraldehyde, borax, boric acid, epichlorohydrin or hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine, any relevant data on the biodegradability of the prepared materials is not included. One of the first write-ups to focus on the topic was released by Chen et al. (1997). The authors investigated the biodegradability of PVA-starch mixtures prepared at the ratios of 1:9, 2:8, 3:7 and 4:6, which had been cross-linked by 5% hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine. Tests were carried out at 25 °C in a soil environment, with compost as the soil inoculum. Therein, the release of carbon dioxide by micro-organisms constituted the evaluative criterion, specifically the volume of gas produced. Unfortunately, the results given cannot be used to derive any exact conclusion as to whether or not cross-linking exerted any effect on degradation of the mixtures. However, the data reported by the authors showed a slight increase in the release of carbon dioxide in the said cross-linked mixtures, in comparison with mixtures without such cross-linking. The authors concluded that this difference was negligible, and that cross-linking merely influences biodegradation to a marginal extent. Detailed research on the impact of cross-linking agents on the biodegradation of PVA-starch mixtures was conducted by Maiti et al. (2012), utilizing epichlorohydrin, ZnO2, formaldehyde and borax as such agents. The said authors found that the process of biodegradation of both non-cross-linked and cross-linked PVA-starch mixtures always entailed two stages. In the first of these (until approximately day 15 of the test), the mixtures were subjected to biological degradation in the following order: non-cross-linked mixture (biodegraded from 35%) > mixture with epichlorohydrin > formaldehyde > borax = ZnO2 (biodegraded from 20%). When applying formaldehyde, biodegradability was seen to increase for the PVA-starch mixtures, due to the evaporation of the formaldehyde during gelatinisation of the mixture at the operating temperature of 80 °C. This led to a lesser degree of cross-linking in comparison with other agents. Stage 2 of the degradation took place during days 15–30. Conclusions were drawn after this period, with the following being determined as primary factors influencing the speed of biodegradation of the cross-linked mixtures: the presence of free OH groups (as they diminish, reduction is recorded for adsorption of moisture); the content of the crystalline phase in the mixture; and the rate of the biodegradation of the cross-links in the mixture. While these experiments by Maiti et al. (2012) examined various aspects of biodegradation of cross-linked mixtures, they cannot be regarded as crucial since the test period of 30 days was inadequate for such materials. In all probability, no degradation of PVA in compost at 25 °C - 30 °C happens during this time frame (Chiellini et al., 2003); therefore, it is not possible to assess the influence of cross-linking on the biodegradation of PVA. The percentage of degradation observed (approx. 50%–55%) corresponds to the content (50 percent by weight) of the readily biodegradable components in the mixtures, i.e., starch and glycerol. Moreover, the mixtures may have been prepared from PVA that was soluble in water. Indeed, the values reported for the molecular weight of 14,000 g/mol correspond to a form of PVA with the capacity for release into the soil environment under the given test conditions. Consequently, biased results might have been recorded during the gravimetric evaluation of such biodegradation, and thus the data is irrelevant for drawing any clear conclusions. The research described above has effectively only investigated the most crucial factors impacting the biodegradation of PVA-starch mixtures. However, information remains scant on how the thermal process applied when preparing the mixture informs any outcomes, i.e., inter- and intra-molecular PVA and starch interactions; indeed, the aforementioned papers have proven insufficient in this regard. Note that the creation and intensity of polymer to filler interactions may be influenced by various aspects: the temperature when preparing the mixture; the molecular weight of the PVA; the degree of PVA hydrolysis; and the type of starch used. Extracellular polysaccharides of microbial origin produced on an industrial scale make for a comparable substrate in mixtures with PVA such as the starch detailed thus far. Primarily, these comprise xanthan gum (E 415) and gellan gum (E 418), which are chiefly produced for the food and pharmaceutical sectors, although their inherent properties mean they are suitable for other industrial purposes. Xanthan gum (XG) is a natural polysaccharide produced by the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris through the fermentation of saccharides. It is often used as a thickener or gelatinisation agent due to its capacity to form pseudo-plastic solutions of stable viscosity. In comparison with other natural polymers, xanthan gum is relatively resistant to the actions of acids, alkalis and electrolytes; in addition, it is largely impervious to UV degradation (Gajdziok and Vetchý, 2012). These properties make XG applicable in mixtures with PVA, wherein it functions as both the filler and plasticizing agent. In fact, a number of such mixtures have been applied in agricultural chemistry, e.g., in pesticides or fertilisers which have to undergo gradual release into the soil (Rosalam and England, 2006). XG was also found to be a suitable intercalation agent for nano-fillers based on clays, as currently utilized in methods for preparing PVA-based nano-composites (Bhattacharya et al., 2012). Gellan gum (GG) is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Sphingomonas elodea (formerly Sphingomonas paucimobilis and/or Pseudomonas elodea). A mixture can be formulated by using it either in natural form, i.e. highly acylated, or in deacylated form. If the former is employed, the substance creates soft, plastic and transparent gels, whereas the latter generates hard, inflexible and fragile gels. Conversion of the solutions into a gel occurs at approximately 50 °C, depending on the given concentration. Unlike other polysaccharide gels, transparent GG gels are resistant to heat and acids. Similarly to XG, the favourable film-forming properties of GG enable its application in agricultural chemistry, in controlled-release pesticides or fertilisers (as encapsulation/a binder), and other sectors such as the food industry. Little has been published on utilizing XG and GG in a mixture with synthetic water-soluble polymers. Nevertheless, a paper on the subject was penned by Sudhamani et al. (2003). Their results suggested that increasing the content of GG in the mixture decreased the tensile strength and elongation of the mixtures. However, biodegradation of the mixtures was not examined. A detailed analysis of the biodegradation of mixtures containing PVA (SH 88%) and XG or GG was made by Kopčilová et al. (2013); the study assessed the properties (pertaining to technology and end-users) of films prepared on an extruder (mixed in a melt). As expected, and in accordance with a previously mentioned paper (Julinová et al., 2010), the greatest extent of biodegradation of the mixtures was achieved in an environment of unadapted activated sludge (between 70% and 80%). The biodegradability of the same in soil, compost and an aqueous anaerobic medium was affected by the limited degradability of PVA itself in the studied environment. All the results showed that the rate of mineralisation of the mixture was consistent with the proportion of extracellular polysaccharide therein. Similar results for the biodegradation of mixtures under anaerobic conditions were attained by Hrnčiřík et al. (2010). Despite promising findings from biodegradability tests, the act of blending PVA with XG/GG led to significant deterioration in tensile strength and elongation, in comparison with pure PVA and mixtures containing starches. Hence, XG and GG are not as well suited to certain applications, e.g., in the preparation of packaging materials, to the same degree as other substrates. However, they are applicable in systems in which mechanical properties are not essential but reasonable miscibility and favourable rheological properties are required. As of now, both of them can be utilized in the preparation of hydrogels, super absorbents and solid polymeric electrolytes (Bhattacharya et al., 2012; Aijun et al., 2016; Caldeira et al., 2018), in systems for the controlled release of active substances into a target environment or organism (Ray et al., 2010)."
4,Potential solution for PVP – the said polymer is biologically resistant,"Despite the widespread use of PVP in the real world, little has been published with reference to its biodegradability. The first study on aerobic biological degradation of PVP was written by Suzuki et al. (1978). As the inoculum, the authors used biomass derived from the waters of the river Yamato (Japan), which the authors claimed had been contaminated by a number of anthropogenic substances; thus, it presented an inappropriate blend of microbial culture and an immense diversity of micro-organisms. The authors chose to monitor the loss of DOC as the evaluative criterion of PVP biodegradation (Mw = 27,000 g/mol). Testing lasted a period of 30 days, confirming that no biological degradation of PVP occurred during the said time frame (Suzuki et al., 1978). The fate of PVP in river water collected from the River Rhine, wherein a high industrial load is typical, was studied by Trimpin et al. (2001). Testing was conducted on an FBB reactor (a laboratory-scale, fixed-bed, bioreactor set-up). They monitored the extent of biodegradation by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. After 30 days, none of the PVP samples exhibited oxidation of the end groups or structural changes in the polymer chain. However, the authors recorded a slight reduction in the molecular weight of the PVP samples during the period. This led to research involving adsorption testing and fractionating samples by gel permeation chromatography, and the discovery that PVP oligomers were prone to adsorption on suspended particulates. The authors concluded that PVP was resistant to biological degradation. As part of a study by Loraine (2008), biodegradation of PVP was monitored in an aqueous aerobic environment in the presence of a mixed microbial culture in the form of activated sludge; no data was given by the author on the source of the activated sludge or the molecular mass of the PVP under analysis. This work also corroborated the resistance of PVP to microbial degradation. Eubeler (2010) investigated the biological degradation of PVP in a marine aqueous environment; this involved examining the degradation of samples with molecular weights ranging from 2000 to 1,500,000 g/mol, pertaining to man-made seawater inoculated with micro-organisms from a sea-life aquarium. Evaluative criteria comprised the monitoring of DOC and production of carbon dioxide. When conducting Zahn-Wellens tests, the author observed a decline in DOC values, which he attributed (in the conclusions section) to the sorption of PVP onto biomass, since no production of carbon dioxide was detected during respirometer tests that could confirm biodegradation of the material. As with the aforementioned studies by Suzuki et al. (1978), Trimpin et al. (2001) and Loraine (2008), the said work confirmed the inherent resistance of PVP to micro-organisms. The degradation of PVP by various types of activated sludge was examined in the framework of the above-mentioned study by Julinová et al. (2012). The aim was to test the biodegradability of PVP with a molecular weight of 10,000 g/mol, applying different types of activated sludge in an aerobic aqueous environment, by means of a respirometer monitoring biological oxygen demand (BOD). With regard to the possible sources of PVP in waste waters, the following forms of aerobic activated sludge were selected: activated sludge from an urban WWTP; activated sludge from a WWTP of a pharmaceutical factory manufacturing pharmaceuticals of a morpholine type; and activated sludge from a WWTP connected to a pharmaceutical plant; these were collected during a period of penicillin production and again once such production had ceased. Aerobic sludge sampled at the time of the penicillin production showed positive results (the only sample to do so), for which BOD values exceeded those for the endogenous respiration of sludge (Julinová et al., 2012). Moreover, this paper also covered the biological degradation of PVP in the presence of the micro-organisms of Penicillium chrysogenum . However, biodegradation was not observed in this case. El-Mohdy and Ghanem (2009) studied the biodegradation of PVP films prepared by casting, with subsequent gamma-irradiation at a dose of 40 kGy. The samples underwent degradation tests in a soil environment (soil-burial tests), using sandy/clay soils as the soil matrix. After 6 months, they noted approximately a 10% degradation. Nevertheless, the action exerted by gamma-irradiation during the preparatory stage of the samples might have initiated the degradation of the PVP; subsequently, this very degradation may be behind the aforementioned partial biodegradation. As suggested by such studies, PVP does not undergo biodegradation, under standard conditions, at a WWTP or in river waters or soils. This implies that PVP represents a significant environmental burden, and hence it is necessary to minimise its transmission into the environment. This could be achieved, similarly to PVA, by utilizing a suitable biopolymeric substrate and/or another initiator of biodegradation to facilitate the same. However, it has proven exceedingly difficult to find substrates suitable for mixing with PVP that would potentially support such biodegradation. While a multitude of information exists in scientific databases on the preparation of mixtures comprising PVP and various types of biopolymers, there remains a complete absence of studies on the biological degradation of such mixtures. These have been described, for instance, with lignin (Silva et al., 2005), chitosan (Prathab and Aminabhavi, 2007), cellulose (Khalil et al., 2017), collagen (Sionkowska et al., 2006), gelatin (Basha and Hassan, 2018), pectin (Nešić et al., 2017) and starch (Al-Bader, 2004); however, lignin and chitosan rank as substrates that prove difficult to degrade. As for mixtures containing cellulose, collagen and starch, degradation is only witnessed for the readily degradable component therein (Al-Bader, 2004). This is why alternatives are being sought to initiate the biodegradation of PVP, of which abiotic factors are notable. Applying these could realistically accelerate the biodegradation of PVP and its mixtures. Certain progressive ideas stem from the fact that PVP includes a lactam ring (γ-lactam) in its structure; in theory, this ring could be subjected to attack by the respective enzyme (γ-lactamase), causing the structure of the polymer to distort, thereby triggering biodegradation of the main chain in turn. Even though a number of micro-organisms have been identified as capable of producing γ-lactamase (Toogood et al., 2004), e.g., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sulfolobus solfataricus MT4, Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans, Rhodococcus sp. ENZA1, Aureobacterium sp. ENZA25, Pseudomonas solanacearum ENZA20, Pseudomonas cepaecia and Comomonas acidovorans, creating γ-lactamase within a broader spectrum of micro-organisms has not been studied in detail. As such research pertains to an enzyme that is not commercially available, and data on its potential for PVP biodegradation is lacking, it is necessary to discern how to source it at a viable cost and in sufficient quantity and quality. One practical solution might be to add inductors that promote production of the enzyme by the micro-organisms present in the mixed cultures of the activated sludge. Line et al. (2004) stated that some soil bacteria are capable of utilizing a compound with the N-acyl group as the sole source of carbon and energy, hence enabling the generation of γ-lactamase, by cleaving the amide link in the heterocyclic ring of (−) γ-lactam to produce the said acid. Another substance tested by Hickey et al. (2009) was acrylamide, which served as a substrate for cultivating micro-organisms that generate γ-lactamase in a micro-reactor. It can be inferred that the possibility exists to use certain substances as inductors of PVP degradation in aqueous aerobic environments, in the presence of a mixed microbial culture in the form of activated sludge sourced from an urban WWTP. Julinová et al. (2013) tested N-acetyl phenylalanine (APhA), acrylamide (AC) and a substance structurally similar to the monomer of PVP, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (1M-2P). The biodegradability of PVP in the presence of the proposed inductors (simultaneous degradation) was assessed on the basis of BOD in a closed respirometer, of type MicroOxymax O2/CO2/CH4. The total concentration of the substrate in suspension equalled 400 mg/L, while the ratio of PVP and the inductor stood at 1:1, and the dry matter of the activated sludge was 500 mg/L. Concurrently, the authors studied the biodegradation of pure PVP and the inductors themselves. From the perspective of respiration of the activated sludge, expressed as BOD, acrylamide exhibited the greatest effect on the degradation of PVP. Indeed, the curve of biodegradation, i.e., the combination of PVP with AC, exceeded the curve of AC itself; the extent of PVP biodegradation achieved was 21.19 ± 10.09%. Nevertheless, there was a decrease in the curve of biodegradation over time during the experiment. This finding suggests that the primary decomposition of PVP had been initiated, producing metabolites that inhibited the micro-organisms of the activated sludge. Adding APhA into the PVP sample did not induce the degradation anticipated. The BOD values corresponding to the degradation of PVP in the presence of APhA were only slightly higher than the BOD values corresponding to the degradation of APhA itself. In this case, the extent of PVP biodegradation achieved measured only 8.97 ± 6.14%. Similarly to acrylamide, reduction was witnessed in the course of biodegradation curves over time, but the said decline was not as extensive. 1M-2P constituted one the last of the inductors to be studied. Although this substance most resembles the PVP monomer in structure, no production of γ-lactamase or other enzymes was exhibited during biodegradation that were capable of decomposing PVP. However, adding 1M-2P did not exert a negative impact on the micro-organisms of the activated sludge (Julinová et al., 2013). These results confirm, in an aerobic environment, the likelihood that the partial cleavage of the PVP lactam ring occurs as the combined result of activity by the micro-organisms and the influence of the AC and APhA inductors; clearly, though, this cleavage is not accompanied by a degradation of the polymeric chain. In contrast with the paper by Julinová et al. (2012), where a favourable effect of 1M-2P was observed on the biodegradation of PVP, Julinová et al. (2013) found that 1M-2P was an inappropriate inductor for PVP degradation. The decreasing trend of curves suggested that metabolites had been created, which inhibited the micro-organisms of the activated sludge; this study did not identify the intermediate products generated. As part of the research conducted by Julinová et al. (2012), an investigation was made into the effect of 1M-2P on the degradation of PVP in the presence of various types of activated sludge: activated sludge from an urban WWTP; activated sludge from a WWTP of a pharmaceutical factory manufacturing pharmaceuticals of morpholine type, and activated sludge from a WWTP connected to a pharmaceutical plant; samples were collected during a period of penicillin production and once such production had ceased. This time, though, a different procedure was employed for the tests. Firstly, the types of aerobic activated sludge under study were adapted to 1M-2P. Biodegradation of 1M-2P by the activated sludge was left to progress for a duration corresponding to the time needed to degrade a readily biodegradable compound (e.g., ethylene glycol, aniline and other materials). Subsequently, using sludge thus adapted, the biodegradation of PVP itself was monitored. The results of the experiment were evaluated according to BOD values. In the cases of activated sludge from the WWTP of the pharmaceutical factory manufacturing pharmaceuticals of a morpholine type and activated sludge from the WWTP connected to the pharmaceutical factory, collected when penicillin was being produced and once manufacture had ceased, approximately an 8% PVP degradation was observed within 350 h; while for the sludge from the urban WWTP, this degradation figure rose to approximately 14%; however, the progress of biodegradation indicates the possibility of metabolites being formed at the same time that inhibit the micro-organisms. It is necessary to verify these findings through further experiments, so as to identify the metabolites and intermediates stemming from such PVP degradation. When comparing the results of the two studies from 2012 and 2013 (Julinová et al., 2012, 2013) investigating the impact of 1M-2P on the degradation of PVP, adaptation to the inductor proved to be a crucial factor. When “pre-adaptation” was carried out first, primary degradation of PVP was observed. However, the inductor was fed to the reaction suspension simultaneously with PVP and the “concurrent” degradation of both 1M-2P and PVP was underway, hence causing the probable inhibition of the primary biodegradation of PVP. This finding could be highly significant in terms of the biodegradation of mixed films, when both of the substances enter the respective environment at the same time. Therefore, the indication is that future research into PVP biodegradation is likely to focus on the search for suitable biodegradable substrates. In this context, positive results were obtained in a study by Paula and Mano (2012), which looked into the biodegradation of hydrogels intended for the launch of medicinal products prepared by casting mixtures of PVP (25,000 g/mol) and poly(D,L-lactic acid) in the presence of soil micro-organisms (soil extract). The mixture containing 50% PVP and 50% poly(D,L-lactic acid) achieved levels of CO2 2.5 times higher than pure poly(D,L-lactic acid). This indicates that a degradation of PVP itself also occurred. However, results published by Vaňharová et al. (2017) on the biological degradability of films prepared from polyvinylpyrrolidone, polylactic acid and the following additives, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1-octyl-2-pyrrolidone, acrylamide and N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, failed to confirm the above finding."
5,Conclusions,"As described in this paper, since polymerised xenobiotics present a considerable risk to all constituents of the environment, it is necessary to look for new ways and procedures to achieve efficient biodegradation of the same. For PVA, this can be achieved through such methods as utilizing polysaccharides in mixtures with PVA. This would be both an economically and technologically acceptable solution with the potential to significantly reduce PVA transmission into the individual constituents of the environment. When formulating the optimal composition of PVA-starch mixtures, it is always necessary to consider the resulting properties of the material and to select the appropriate type of starch in order to achieve the highest possible degree of biodegradation. In addition, economic and processing criteria should be taken into account, so that the material produced is customised to fit the needs of the specific application or product. This kind of mixture, as described herein, has the potential to be applied by the technological, pharmaceutical and food sectors, since extracellular polysaccharides such as xanthan gum and gellan gum are found in numerous foodstuffs and supplements. In the case of PVP, the problem is much more complex - mainly due to the high capacity of the substance to resist biological processes. The results of existing research suggest that the initial hypothesis of the biological resistance of PVP is unlikely to be linked with the absence of micro-organisms that produce γ-lactamase in the degradation environment. Indeed, it is more probable to focus on its chemical structure and morphology, as well as the physico-chemical processes taking place in the given setting (sorption, complexation and so on)."
