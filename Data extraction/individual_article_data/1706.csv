0,Introduction,"Numerous researchers have focused their work during the last two decades on the valorisation and production of the second generation of biofuels and chemicals from bio-oils, originating from biomass resources. Various processing routes for the non-feed biomass residue conversion to fuels and chemicals were proposed [1,2] in order to avoid the competition with food. Biomass consists of three key building blocks, namely cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are thermally and chemically unstable [3,4]. Bio-oils, produced by thermochemical methods, are a complex mixture of the compounds with very high oxygen content, being the main reason for their low heating value, high viscosity and chemical instability. Therefore, hydrogenation and/or hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) are applied either to improve their properties [5–7] for their further use in the co-processing in traditional refineries or as a valuable source for the production of the bio-based chemicals by catalytic hydrogenation /hydro-deoxygenation reactions. These reactions usually take place in a slurry reactor with the three phases present, namely liquid (reactants, solvent and products), solid (catalyst) and gas (hydrogen as co-reactant). The solubility of hydrogen in a solvent and in oxygenated components that act as a precursor towards the desired bio-chemicals is of great importance, since it affects selectivity, reaction rates and catalyst activity. Reaction rates are thus often limited by a poor solubility of gas (hydrogen). Cellulose and the hexoses (C6 sugars) from hemicellulose can be transformed to various bio-based chemicals, such as 5- hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and levulinic acid (LA), by acidic hydrolysis or dissolution, and further deformylation to levulinic acid (LA) [7]. Both have received meaningful attention as the platform chemicals for the further synthesis of a wide range of chemicals and bio-based fuels. Levulinic acid was recognized as one of the top value added bio-chemicals by the U.S. Department of Energy [8] some years ago, which can be manufactured in high yields using the “Biofine” process. Levulinic acid can serve as a source for high-energy-density fuels production by hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone and catalytic upgrading to hydrocarbons. Lignin, as the third biomass building block represents an origin of a large amount of bio-based chemicals to replace those chemicals derived from oil, such as lignin monomers guaiacol, catechol, phenol, cresol, syringol, etc. Guaiacol is very often used in the hydrodeoxygenation process studies as a model compound, because it contains both, hydroxyl (-OH) and methoxy (-OCH3) groups, which are characteristic for lignin-derived phenolic monomers [9]. To be able to effectively design and optimize the reactions, thermodynamic properties such as gas solubility play a very crucial role and determine the feasibility of a certain process. In spite of the relative maturity (two decades) of this research field on the conversion of biomass to higher added-value bio-chemicals, there is still a huge lack on the data regarding the solubility of hydrogen in bio-derived precursors and bio-chemicals. A series of reviews [10–14] on systems investigated at high pressures and reported during a specific period, including the solubility of gasses, have been published, but very rare data were found on the solubility of hydrogen in bio-based chemicals. Table 1 presents the binary systems studied so far with the references, together with other relevant information, such as experimental methods, temperature range, pressure range and models used. Qureshi et al. [15] reported the solubility of hydrogen in three industrially relevant bio-based compounds, allyl alcohol, furan and eugenol. Low solubility of hydrogen was observed in all studied compounds and the solubility was shown to increase with increasing temperature and pressure. The phase behavior of the systems was modeled using the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS) model. The hydrogen solubility in furfural was measured and modeled by Jaatinen et al. [16], and very recently by Ivaniš et al. [17]. In the latter work, the solubility of hydrogen in furfuryl alcohol was also reported for the temperature and pressure range from 323 K up to 423 K and from 5.2 MPa up to 26.3 MPa, respectively and modeled by Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS, PR EOS and perturbed-chain statistical association (PC-SAFT) EOS model. Hydrogen was found to be more soluble in furfural than in furfuryl alcohol for about 15%. The solubility of hydrogen was investigated lately in lactones, such as γ-heptalactone and γ-nonalactone, model compounds that represent lignocellulose, by Escobedo et al. [18] using a synthetic method. Hydrogen solubility increased with respect to temperature, and was greater in γ-nonalactone than in γ-heptalactone. Hydrogen solubility was also measured in ten organic solvents thirty-five years ago by Brunner [19], and among the others also in a very important furan based solvent tetrahydrofuran, in the temperature range from 298 K up to 373 K and pressure range from 2.9 MPa up to 9.7 MPa. Trinh et al. [20] gave a review on the hydrogen solubility in oxygenated molecules and water few years ago, where the solubility of hydrogen in 42 organic compounds were investigated, namely in alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, glycols, n-alkanes and water. They have performed data inventory to be able to develop a group contribution method with an equation of state and to evaluate the hydrogen Henry's constants as pertinent descriptor of the hydrogen solubility. A comparison of Henry's constants across different organic families was made and discussed. Very limited data were found for acids and linear ketones and for high temperatures. Monte Carlo molecular simulation was recognized as an efficient method to estimate pseudo-data of hydrogen solubility, also at higher temperature with the average statistical uncertainty between 3 and 8%. Phase behavior of guaiacol alone and some mixtures with it, was studied by Pereira et al. [21] by using several thermodynamic approaches, namely Group Contribution-Polar Perturbed Chain- Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (GC-PPC-SAFT) and Molecular Simulation using the Anisotropic United Atoms force field and new experimental data of guaiacol mixture with methane was reported. Guaiacol, very often used in the studies as a model compound, exhibits due to its molecular structure and two oxygen-containing functional groups quite complex behavior with polar and association interactions. The authors have investigated the liquid phase structure of guaiacol by molecular simulation and by proposing two association schemes in the GC-PPC-SAFT model. Some predictive calculations with gasses (H2S, NH2, H2 and CO) were also performed by both GC-PPC-SAFT and molecular simulation. Higher solubilities of H2S, H2 and CO in guaiacol were predicted by GC-PPC-SAFT compared to molecular simulation. This work reports on hydrogen solubility in two additional bio-based chemicals, namely guaiacol and levulinic acid, the latter with an addition of approx. 10% (w/w) of water. Guaiacol, a model compound of bio-oil, has a molecular structure with two oxygen-containing functional groups, namely phenolic OH-group and methoxy -OCH3-group, see Fig. 1 , while levulinic acid, a precursor for fuels, possesses one carbonyl and one carboxylic functional group. According to our knowledge, no hydrogen solubility data is available in the literature for guaiacol and levulinic acid + water, except the predictive calculation of H2 solubility in guaiacol at 573.15 K using GC-PPC-SAFT and molecular simulation by Pereira et al. [21]. The solubility experiments in this study were performed on the high-pressure view cell applying isothermal analytical method. Measurements, carried out at temperatures between 322 K and 425 K and pressures from 5 MPa up to 20 MPa for H2 in guaiacol, and at temperatures between 323 K and 372 K and pressures up to 19 MPa for the solubility of H2 in the latter system levulinic acid + water are presented. These conditions may be used in catalytic hydrogenation/hydro-deoxygenation of the mentioned bio-compounds. The data measured for both systems are modeled using Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK), Peng-Robinson (PR-BM) equation of state and Perturbed Chain Statistically Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). The latter model was successfully applied only for the first two-component system (H2 + guaiacol). For the three-component system, namely H2 + levulinic acid + water, three binary systems had to be evaluated, and some difficulties occurred during the regression of binary interaction parameter kij , between H2 and levulinic acid (LA), from the measured three component system data. It is believed that this issue occurred mostly due to the lack of the knowledge and data on association behavior of levulinic acid and acids in general, needed in the PC-SAFT EOS model."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals used,"2.1 Chemicals used Hydrogen of high purity (0.999995), supplied by Messer Griesheim was used in this solubility study. Guaiacol from Sigma-Aldrich, purity of ≥ 99% (Lot#STBH2119) as well as levulinic acid from Sigma-Aldrich (Lot#STBD2042V) with purity of ≥ 97% were both employed in our experiments without further purification. In experiments with levulinic acid, bi-distilled water was added to prepare the binary aqueous solution. Eugenol, which was used to check the experimental procedure on the high-pressure apparatus, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, purity of ≥ 99% (Lot#STBF3347V) and used without any purification process as well. In the cleaning procedure of the cell, acetone from Merck of purity 99.9% as well as nitrogen from Messer Griesheim with initial weight fraction purity of 0.99999 were both utilized. Table 2 lists all the chemicals used performing experiments in this work. An amount of water present in chemicals, guaiacol, eugenol and levulinic acid was determined by Karl Fisher titration and for this determination, HydranalTM Coulomat AG (Honeywell Fluka) was used as a reagent. Water standards (Aquastar Certified Reference Material) 0.1% and 1% for coulometric KF titration, purchased from Merck, were measured before each set of water analysis. The determined water contents in guaiacol, levulinic acid and eugenol were 0.331%, 0.654% and 0.117%, respectively."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure 2.2.1 Apparatus High-pressure apparatus, which was described in more detail elsewhere [22], was used to perform the solubility experiments of hydrogen in pure guaiacol and in a binary mixture of levulinic acid and water, with about 10% by weight of water. The high- pressure view cell, which is the core of the apparatus, was constructed of Hasteloy C4 in cylindrical form with an inner diameter of 50 mm and surrounded by an insulating (double) jacket, and the constant volume of the cell (150 cm3) was used for the gas solubility experiments. The cell was closed on both sides with sapphire windows with two different dimensions, on the front side with a diameter of 70 mm to allow a better view of the inside of the cell, and with a smaller sapphire window with a diameter of 50 mm on the back of the cell. Special seals (O-rings) made of black high-temperature perfluoroelastomer of hardness 70 were used to prevent any leakage of hydrogen from the cell, and they were regularly replaced with new ones. The temperature of the cell was controlled by the thermostat Julabo Presto LH46 and by circulating thermal oil LH 40 through the pipes to the double jacket of the cell and back, all of which were additionally thermally insulated by using glass wool and polyurethane foam. A Pt-100 platinum resistance thermometer was used to measure the temperature inside the cell. It was calibrated by the accredited metrology laboratory LMK according to the international temperature standard ITS −90 against the reference thermometer at a triple point and at different temperatures along the measuring range. The immersion depth of the thermometer during calibration was 50 mm and the reported expanded uncertainty of the measurements was ± 0.1 K, with a confidence level of 0.95. The pressure measurements in the cell were performed with the Omegadyne PX1004L1–5KAV high temperature pressure transducer (serial number 53,387) using the strain gage principle, which was calibrated on site against the reference pressure transducer by the accredited pressure measurement laboratory IMT. The determined expanded uncertainty for the coverage factor 2, for the pressure range from 0 to 300 bar, was 0.08% of the measured value. The mixing in the cell was ensured by inserting a small magnetic stirring rod into the cell and switching on the electromagnetic field generated by four stationary electromagnets Meyle, which were located around the cylinder of the cell. The mixing intensity was kept low by using the LabView 2010 program interface (National Instruments). The cell and all surrounding capillaries for the transfer of components into the cell as well as the sampling system were evacuated via the insulated double-jacketed cold trap by a hybrid chemical pump Vacuumbrand RC6. For the vacuum measurements a Pirani vacuum gage VAP5 with a measuring range between 1000 - 10−3 mbar (measurement uncertainty ± 10% of the specified value) was used. Since an analytical method was used to determine the solubility of hydrogen in the liquid phase under certain operating conditions (T, P), a sampling system was used to take samples of the liquid phase from the cell. The liquid sample was drawn off through the valve and the capillary located at the bottom of the cell. The sampling was carried out according to the suggestions of Peper and Dohrn [23]. A small amount of a liquid released from the cell was trapped between two valves and then expanded into a glass cold trap (157 mL) in the Dewar flask, which was immersed in a cooling medium (ice), while the gas dissolved in the liquid expanded further via the subsequent trap (gas mouse of volume 172 mL). Before each withdrawal of the liquid phase from the cell, the sampling system was thoroughly evacuated and the pressure increase after sampling was recorded by a high-precision digital manometer Keller LEX −1 with the pressure range of 0–0.2 MPa (absolute pressure) and an accuracy of 0.05% FS. The manometer was calibrated against DH Instruments RPM3 with an uncertainty of 0.01% + 5 Pa by the accredited pressure measurement laboratory IMT. The temperature of the cold trap as well as the gas temperature were measured with a digital precision platinum resistance thermometer (Hart Scientific, model 1506), calibrated according to ITS −90 with a resolution of 0.0001 K and an uncertainty of ± 0.01 K by the accredited metrology measuring laboratory LMK. The volume of a cold trap (157.16 mL) and a gas ‘mouse’ (172.56 mL) was measured by thoroughly filling it with degassed water at room temperature, weighing it with a Tehtnica® Exacta balance with an uncertainty of 0.05 mg and using the density of water at the same temperature. The uncertainty of the calibrated volume was better than 0.01%. 2.2.2 Experimental procedure The hydrogen was introduced into the thoroughly cleaned and evacuated cell (10−2 mbar) from the gas cylinder up to a certain pressure without the use of a compressor. The cell was then left for a while to reach a desired temperature and stable pressure of the hydrogen to ensure that there was no leakage in the cell. The liquid component (guiaiacol, levulinic acid-water, eugenol) was degassed approximately 2 h under vacuum at room temperature with the Normag vacuum batch rectification column at total reflux ratio and then transferred under vacuum with a manually operated SITEC screw pump with a working volume of 15 mL (0.3 mL per revolution, with an uncertainty of 0.12% per revolution, max. 100 strokes). In this way, the hydrogen was compressed in the cell and the system reached a certain pressure, normally over 250 bar. The contents of the cell were mixed for several hours until the temperature and pressure in the cell were constant and equilibrium was reached. A sampling system was evacuated and checked that the pressure in the sampling system was not higher than 2–3 mbar before sampling to ensure that it was clean and tight. Sampling was carried out quickly not to disturb the equilibrium too much, although the pressure decreased, but the temperature was not very much affected (max 0.1 °C) and remained stable. The pressure in the sampling device before and after sampling was recorded, together with the temperature of the cooling medium in the Dewar flask and the temperature of the gas in the gas trap. The liquid part of the sample was collected in the glass trap, while hydrogen has expanded over the sampling system (capillaries, upper part of the glass trap for liquid and the gas trap). After releasing hydrogen out of the sampling device, the glass trap was closed and disconnected from the sampling system, wiped from outside with acetone and left to the room temperature, then weighed on a balance. A mass of a liquid collected in the glass trap was calculated from the mass difference after and before sampling. After each sampling the components system in the cell was mixed for approx. 2.5–3 h to take another sample. The capillaries were first stripped with nitrogen, then rinsed thoroughly with acetone, and in the case of levulinic acid first with distilled water followed by acetone. Both traps were also cleaned with acetone or distilled water followed by acetone and dried. Then they were mounted together, and evacuated to be prepared for the next sampling. 2.2.3 Density and vapor pressure calculation NIST density data for guaiacol (combined uncertainty of 1%) at measured temperature in the glass trap was used to calculate the volume above the liquid in the trap that was occupied by hydrogen. The contribution of the guaiacol to the vapor pressure above was calculated by DIPPR [24] vapor pressure correlation (uncertainty of 0.2% at coverage factor of 2). Hydrogen isothermal properties (density (T,P)) was taken from NIST Chemistry Webbook, SRD 69 [25] that uses standardized equation for hydrogen densities to calculate an amount of hydrogen dissolved in a liquid under investigation, taking all volumes (capillaries, upper part of the glass trap and gas mouse) at appropriate temperature into account. The density uncertainty for this equation was estimated as 0.2% (combined uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2). From both, mass of liquid and mass of hydrogen, mole fraction of hydrogen dissolved in a liquid was calculated with an uncertainty of 1.04% (at coverage factor of 2). In the case of eugenol, the liquid molar volumes were calculated according to the equation (1) Y = A B [ 1 + ( 1 − T C ) D ] Where Y is the molar volume in kmol/m3 and T is the temperature in K. Constants A, B, C and D were taken from Qureshi et al. [15]. For the system levulinic acid + water, an amount of water was determined by KF titration in the sample (relative uncertainty of 0.18%) and DIPPR equation [24] was used to calculate water density at measured temperature (uncertainty of 0.1%). The density (T,P) of levulinic acid was calculated using TRIDEN equation given by Guerrero et al. [26], which uses the Tate equation for isothermal compressed densities combined with a modified Rackett equation for the liquid saturation densities, using the following parameters of the TRIDEN equation given in Table 3 with the corresponding relative root-mean-square deviation of 0.00855%. One data for levulinic acid density at 297.15 K was measured in this work and the value of 1.13677 g/mL was in line with the TRIDEN density correlation at 1 bar. The molar density of the mixture was calculated as: (2) 1 ρ m i x = x h 2 o ρ h 20 + x L A ρ L A Where ρ states for molar density. The calculated uncertainty for levulinic acid density from the TRIDEN equation is less than 0.00855% and the estimated relative uncertainty of the molar mixture density is 0.21%. The vapor pressures of pure levulinic acid vs temperature were reported some time ago by Stull [27], and Antoine constants given by NIST (TRC) [25] were used in our calculation. The pressure at x (H2) =0 was calculated by SRK EOS for system containing only water + levulinic acid."
4,Thermodynamic modeling,"To be able to design hydro-processes, the solubility of hydrogen in liquid systems has to be known. Industry is mostly relying on experimental data, but in some cases e.g. in preliminary studies of techno-economic viability of a certain process, also predictive models are much appreciated. The solubility of hydrogen in the organic solvents is generally very small and therefore Henry's constant is a valuable descriptor of the solubility [20]. The binary systems of hydrogen with n-alkanes and with alcohols are well described, less data are found for hydrogen solubility in esters, and practically none for carboxylic acids, except acetic acid. Limited data are also available for ethers and aldehydes, and some more data for ketones. The authors have shown that Henry's constant is a function of the chemical family with the order of Hdiols > Halcohols > Hesters >Haldehydes > Hethers > Halkanes and that in a chemical family the higher the molecular weight the lower the Henry's constant, which means higher hydrogen solubility. The Henry's law constant Hi of hydrogen in solvent is defined as: (3) H i = lim x i → 0 ( f i L x i ) Where f i L denotes the fugacity of hydrogen in the liquid phase and x i the mole fraction of hydrogen in the liquid phase at infinite dilution. By using an equation of state, the fugacity of hydrogen in the liquid phase ( f i L ) can be calculated and from the diagram representing the ratio f i L / x i vs x i , and its extrapolation to infinite dilution (zero concentration), the Henry's constant can be evaluated. It can be also obtained from: (4) H i = P s σ . φ i L , ∞ ( P s σ ) Where φ i L , ∞ represents the fugacity coefficient of hydrogen in the liquid at infinite dilution, calculated at solvent vapor pressure P s σ . In our work, three equations of state, Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), Peng-Robinson with Boston-Mathias alpha function (PR-BM) and Perturbed-Chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) were used to represent the thermodynamic phase behavior (solubility) of hydrogen in both studied liquids, namely guaiacol and levulinic acid + water (approx. 10 wt%). Aspen Plus Software V11 [28] was applied for modeling in this work."
5,SRK EOS,"3.1 SRK EOS The Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state is based on the equation of state of Redlich-Kwong-Soave [29], but with several differencies and is of the form: (5) P = R T V m − b − a V m ( V m + b ) Where: (6) a = a 0 + a 1 a 0 is the standard quadratic mixing term given by: (7) a 0 = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n x i x j a i a j ( 1 − k i j ) a 1 is an asymmetric polar term given by: (8) a 1 = ∑ i = 1 n x i ( ∑ j = 1 n x j ( ( a i a j ) 1 / 2 l j , i ) 1 / 3 ) 3 (9) b = ∑ i x i b i (10) a i = α i 0.42747 R 2 T c i 2 P c i (11) b i = 0.08664 R T c i P c i Where alpha function is calculated by: (12) α i ( T ) = [ 1 + m i ( 1 − T r i 1 / 2 ) ] 2 with the parameter m i correlated with the acentric factor: (13) m i = 0.48508 + 1.55171 ω i − 0.15613 ω i 2 (15) k i j = k i j ( 1 ) + k i j ( 2 ) T + k i j ( 3 ) T (14) with k i j = k j i (16) l i j = l i j ( 1 ) + l i j ( 2 ) T + j i j ( 3 ) T Where (17) l i j ≠ l j i , l j w = l w j = 0"
6,PR-EOS,"3.2 PR-EOS For Peng Robinson model [30], all upper equations are applied, except an Eqs. (5), (10), (11) and (13). Instead of Eq. (5), the following equation is used: (18) P = R T V m − b − a V m ( V m + b ) + b ( V m − b ) And instead of Eqs. (10) and (11), the equations below are applied: (19) a i = α i 0.45724 R 2 T c i 2 P c i (20) b i = 0.07780 R T c i P c i In Eq. (20), the alpha function was adopted by Boston-Mathias extrapolation [31], for temperatures higher than critical: (21) α i ( T ) = [ e x p [ c i ( 1 − T r i d i ) ] ] 2 Where (22) d i = 1 + m i 2 (23) c i = 1 − 1 d i m i is correlated with the acentric factor: (24) m i = 0.37464 + 1.54226 ω i − 0.26992 ω i 2"
7,PC-SAFT EOS,"3.3 PC-SAFT EOS The perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) developed by Gross and Sadowski [32,33] is based on a well-established model SAFT EOS, with modifications on the expressions for the dispersion forces. This equation of state is able to represent the thermodynamic properties of polymer systems as well as fluid systems with small and/or large molecules over a wide range of temperature and pressure. The perturbation term takes into account the attractive (dispersion) interactions between segments that are connected to chains and is expressed as a sum of two terms, first- and second-order perturbation terms: (25) A p e r t R T = A 1 R T + A 2 R T Where A states for the Helmholtz free energy. The coefficients A1 and A2 depend on density, composition and molecular size. Three pure-component parameters for each substance are necessary, namely segment number, m, segment diameter, σ and segment energy, ε. These parameters are normally regressed from vapor pressure data and liquid molar volume of pure components. For an association species, two additional parameters are necessary, namely the effective association volume k ( A B ) and the association energy ε ( A B ) and for polar species, the dipole moment μ and the segment polar fraction x p . 3.3.1 Mixture parameters For mixtures with different structures and polarities, combining rules are defined as presented in Pereira et al. [21] and two types of interaction parameters, namely dispersive binary interaction parameters and cross-association parameters can be considered. Dispersive binary interaction parameters The dispersive binary interaction parameter k ij can be fitted from the phase equilibrium data and can be expressed as temperature dependent parameter. Three types of binary interactions in copolymer systems can be applied: solvent-solvent, solvent-segment and segment-segment. Van der Waals one fluid-model and the modified Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules are applied for the parameters ε ij and σ ij between segments of molecules i and j: (26) ε i j = ( 1 − k i j ) ε i i ε j j (27) σ i j = ( σ i i + σ j j ) / 2 Association interaction parameters The cross association energy and the cross effective association volume parameter can be estimated by combining rules as: (28) ε A α B β = ε A α + ε B β 2 (29) k A α B β = k A α k B β [ σ α σ β ( σ α + σ β ) / 2 ] 3 The model called 2B is commonly used, which means that an associating species has two association site types [34,35]. Association scheme used in the present work is: Hydrogen - none, Guaiacol (2B type, 1- proton donor site and 1- proton acceptor site), Levulinic acid (2B type, 1- proton donor site and 1- proton acceptor site), Water (4C type, 2- proton donor sites, 2- proton acceptor sites). Pure components parameters, namely critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc) and acentric factor (ω) required for EOS calculations as well as pure component parameters used in the PC-SAFT EOS are listed in Table 4 , giving also the source of the data. Guaiacol, as a model compound of bio-oil, has a molecular structure with two oxygen-containing functional groups, namely phenolic OH-group and methoxy -OCH3-group, therefore quite complex polar and association interactions can take place. For modeling with PC-SAFT, we have followed the article of Pereira et al. [21] and based on their group contribution approach and parameters available for the main constituents (groups) of the guaiacol molecule, the segment number m i , the segment diameter σ i as well as the segment energy εi/k were calculated. The latter was used as an estimate that was refitted after on the vapor pressure data of guaiacol. Association energy ε A B as well as an effective association volume k A B were both calculated with the combining rule for the cross-association parameters from the Scheme 1, proposed in the GC-PPC-SAFT model, with smaller number of association sites to represent guaiacol as recommended by the authors. PC-SAFT segment number, m i, segment diameter, σi/Ǻ, segment energy, εi/k/K as well as an association energy and effective association volume for levulinic acid were all taken from the articles published recently [38,39] and are given in Table 4. Next, we have performed a regression on density and vapor pressure data to calculate segment dipolar fraction, x p μ · m , reported in Table 4."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Experimental data and solubility modeling,"4.1 Experimental data and solubility modeling Experimental procedure was checked on a known measured solubility of hydrogen in eugenol [15] at 403 K (403.25 K and 403.42 K). Two solubility values were measured at mentioned temperatures, one at pressure of 10.03 MPa (x(H2)= 0.0395) and the other at pressure of 13.02 MPa, which was 0.0512. Both values agree satisfactory (within 4%) with the literature data, taking into account that both temperatures were higher (for 1.35 K and 1.52 K, respectively) compared to the temperature (401.9 K) from the literature [15]. 4.1.1 Hydrogen solubility in guaiacol Experimental solubility data of hydrogen in guaiacol at various temperatures and pressures are given in Table 5 and are presented in Figs. 2-4 , together with the description of the hydrogen solubility by using SRK and PC-SAFT EOS at one temperature. All experimentally measured T, P, x data given in data sets (D-1 to D-3) were used in the regression cases (shown in Table 6 ) to determine binary interaction parameters and average absolute deviations (AAD) in% of various EOS models for H2 solubility in guaiacol. The solubility was modeled also using the Peng-Robinson EOS and Boston-Mathias (BM) alpha function and all the results of the regression cases are listed in Table 6, where binary interaction parameters of the used EOS models, together with the average absolute deviations AAD (%) for temperature, pressure and hydrogen solubility are given. With all the models the hydrogen solubility in guaiacol is well described and correlated. Binary interaction parameters kij are temperature dependent and kij for different regression cases was calculated for SRK and PC-SAFT EOS. For PR-BM EOS only the regression on all three data sets at different temperatures was performed, but with an inclusion of two additional parameters lij and lji to take into account asymmetric polar interactions. The inclusion of two additional asymmetric interaction parameters into SRK EOS has lowered the value of binary interaction parameters kij/1 (dispersive interaction), but with comparable average absolute deviations in T, pressure and hydrogen solubility. We may say that the mixture is highly asymmetric, therefore using only dispersive interaction most probably results in unusual negatively high values of kij. The solubility of hydrogen in guaiacol is increasing linearly with pressure at constant temperature and is increasing with increasing temperature. Such behavior was also predicted by Pereira et al. [21] using GC-PPC-SAFT EOS and molecular simulation. Since the solubility of hydrogen in the organic solvents is generally very small, Henry's constant defined in Eq. (2) may serve as a relevant descriptor of the solubility. For the evaluation of Henry's constants of hydrogen in guaiacol, SRK EOS was used to calculate the fugacity of hydrogen in guaiacol at infinite dilution for all average temperatures of the experiments. By plotting (f1/x1 ) vs. x1 , where 1 stands for hydrogen, the Henry's constants were obtained from the limit, where x1 approaches zero, and are listed in Table 7 below. With increasing temperature Henry's constants of hydrogen are decreasing, which means that the solubility of hydrogen is increasing in guaiacol with temperature increase. The solubility of hydrogen, which is a very light gas and does not form hydrogen bonds with guaiacol, mainly depends on the free volume available in the solvent and this free volume is increasing with temperature. The evaluated Henry's constants in our work are below the predicted values by molecular simulation [21], but with the same temperature trend observed. From the temperature dependence of Henry's constant, the enthalpy of dissolution of hydrogen in guaiacol as well as the entropy of dissolution were calculated according to the equations below: (30) Δ H d i s s = R ∂ ln ( H ( T , p ) p 0 ) ∂ ( 1 T ) (31) Δ S d i s s = − R ∂ ln ( H ( T , p ) p 0 ) ∂ l n T (32) Δ G d i s s = Δ H d i s s − T Δ S d i s s p 0 is the standard pressure of 0.1 MPa. It can be noticed, that the enthalpy of dissolution of hydrogen in guaiacol is positive, which means that the dissolution of hydrogen is endothermic process and with an increase in temperature, the solubility of hydrogen in guaiacol will increase. At higher temperatures more free volume is available for hydrogen to dissolve in guaiacol. Hydrogen does not form hydrogen bonds with guaiacol and no such interactions with guaiacol are expected that would cause a release of energy. The entropic part, which represents the disorder degree in the two-component system, is positive, which means more chaos in the solution. From both contributions, the Gibbs free energy of dissolution can be evaluated (Table 7), and positive value shows the dissolution of hydrogen is non-spontaneous process, therefore such low hydrogen solubility. 4.1.2 Hydrogen solubility in levulinic acid + water Measured solubility data of hydrogen in levulinic acid with water (approx. 10 wt%) at various temperatures and pressures are given in Table 8 and are presented in Fig. 5 . It can be noticed that the solubility of hydrogen in a binary mixture is increasing linearly with pressure at constant temperature and is increasing with increasing temperature. All experimentally measured T, P, x data in data sets (D-4 to D-6) were included in the regression cases (shown in Table 9 ) to determine binary interaction parameters and average absolute deviations (AAD) in% of various EOS models for H2 solubility in levulinic acid/water. To perform the calculations, the levulinic pure component data TC, PC, VC, acentric factor ω and TB were taken from NIST (TDE) [36], while molar volumes at boiling point and standard molar volume were calculated by using TRIDEN equation by Guerrero at al. [26]. The constants for Antoine equation were retrieved from NIST (TRC) [25], based on the vapor pressure data measured by Stull [27]. Since the three-component system consists of three binary pairs, namely hydrogen + water (H2 H2O), levulinic acid + water (LA-H2O) and hydrogen + levulinic acid (H2-LA), all binary pairs were considered in performing the calculations by EOS models. First, the literature database was checked for H2 H2O binary system and quite some data was found [40–45], and the last one published recently, was found to be the most reliable. Eight data sets from the Supporting Information of the article of Rahbari et al. [45] seemed to be the most accurate. They gave the best results in regression in terms of average absolute deviations AAD (%) in T, P, x(H2), covering a very wide temperature as well as pressure range, from 273.15 K – 422.94 K and 1.013 bar – 1013 bar, respectively. Therefore, these data sets were used to calculate the binary interaction parameters of SRK, PR-BM EOS and PC-SAFT for H2 H2O system. See Table 9. SRK model for H2 H2O system, using only binary temperature dependent kij parameters gave good description of the binary system phase behavior. Three VLE data sets [46,47] were available in the literature for the binary system LA-H2O, but only the last data set (most reliable) at one temperature of 333.15 K (TPX data, N = 24, BIVLE004) [47] was used to regress binary interaction parameter kij for this subsystem and satisfactory agreement was obtained between calculated and literature data. These parameters were applied further in the regression of binary interaction parameters for the binary system H2-LA from measured experimental data. As can be seen from the Table 9, using only kij binary interaction parameters (SRK EOS) without additional asymmetric lij, lji parameters for H2-LA system, has given a good description of the system's behavior. A bit higher average absolute deviations AAD (%) in the temperature, pressure and hydrogen solubility x(H2) and a bit lower AAD (%) for compositions x(H2O) and x(LA) were obtained compared to the SRK EOS using asymmetric binary parameters (l ij, l ji) as well. The solubility was modeled also using the Peng-Robinson EOS with Boston-Mathias (BM) alpha function and all the results of the regression cases are listed in Table 9 as well. Binary interaction parameters of the used EOS models, together with the average absolute deviations AAD (%) for temperature, pressure and hydrogen solubility as well as mole fraction of water and levulinic acid in the liquid phase are shown. The thermodynamic behavior of the binary pair H2 H2O was better described by including additional asymmetric polar interaction parameters lij, lji , besides temperature dependent binary interaction parameters kij. Three vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) data sets from the literature for H2O-LA were used [46,47] in the regression of the binary interaction parameters (kij, lij, lji ) for H2O-LA of the PR-BM model. The average absolute deviations AAD (%) in temperature for the first two data sets are quite high (see Table 9), but the latest data set measured by Resk et al. [47] was well correlated by PR-BM model with kij and lij parameters regressed. Further, all these parameters were fixed in the regression of binary interaction parameters of the PR-BM model for the binary pair H2-LA from the measured data in this work, with dispersive and asymmetric polar binary interaction parameters being considered as temperature dependent. This way the phase behavior of the system H2 + levulinic acid was relatively well correlated in terms of average absolute deviations for temperature, pressure and the composition x(H2), while higher discrepancy was shown for x(H2O) (AAD up to 10%) and x(LA) (AAD up to 5.6%) in the liquid phase. Comparing the SRK and PR-BM EOS models it seems that SRK EOS is more robust, easier to use and does not need so many binary interaction parameters to describe the phase behavior of the three- component system. Modeling the three-component system using only PR model without Boston-Mathias alpha function was not successful (not shown here). In the PC-SAFT model, the association type of 4C was applied for water, while for levulinic acid an association type of 2B was used. PC-SAFT parameters found in the recent literature [38,39] for levulinic acid were further used in the calculations. Only a segment dipolar fraction, x p μ · m for levulinic acid, reported in Table 4, was regressed from the vapor pressure data of levulinic acid [27] from 374 K up to 519 K and density data [26] in the temperature range from 308.15 K up to 338.15 K and pressure from 0.10 MPa up to 60.00 MPa. At first, PC-SAFT binary temperature dependent interaction parameters for H2 H2O subsystem were evaluated from the regression on the eight literature data sets [45]. As noticed from the Table 9, the hydrogen solubility in water can be reasonably described (AAD (%) for hydrogen solubility is around 3%). For the subsystem H2O-LA only the best dataset (T = 333.15 K, PTX data) [47] was used for the regression of the binary interaction parameter kij, applying an association type of 2B for levulinic acid. The mentioned binary interaction parameters for the two subsystems were fixed and the regression of binary interaction parameter for H2-levulinic acid from the experimental data sets D-4, D-5, D-6 (H2 solubility in H2O-LA) was performed. The regression was not successful, probably mainly due to the complexity of the system. On one side there is hydrogen, which does not form hydrogen bonds and on the other side solvent system containing carboxylic acid and water. Systems consisting of carboxylic acids and/or water are very complex and are susceptible to specific interactions, such as hydrogen bond formation, dipolar interactions, and chemical association, which affect their thermodynamic properties. The association energy and effective association volume of levulinic acid were taken from the literature [38,39], where one stable conformation of levulinic acid was considered, out of six possible at 298.15 K. We may say that PC-SAFT model which in fact provides better physical background of the systems, requires more knowledge on the behavior of the molecules, on the dipoles and interactions inside the molecules as well as with the other components and on association schemes that need to be applied. The solubility of hydrogen in a binary mixture of levulinic acid and water (approx. 10 wt%) is increasing linearly with pressure at constant temperature and is increasing with increasing temperature. The Henry's constants were evaluated with the help of the SRK EOS, calculating the fugacity of hydrogen in a binary mixture at x(H2) approaching zero, from the diagram (fi/xi ) vs. xi (i-H2) and are reported in Table 10 . Enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs enthalpy of dissolution of hydrogen in the mixture of levulinic acid + water were evaluated and are listed in Table 10 as well. Based on the SRK EOS model, Henry's constants for hydrogen solubility in pure water as well as hydrogen solubility in pure levulinic acid at three different temperatures 323.15 K, 353.15 K and 373.15 K were calculated. The evaluated hydrogen Henry's constants in water agree very well with the literature data [20], within 0.3% to 3%. It can be noticed that hydrogen solubility in pure levulinic acid is of the order of magnitude of the hydrogen solubility in guaiacol. By adding around 10 wt% of water to levulinic acid, the Henry's constant increases for about 30% in the temperature range from 323 K up to 373 K. The enthalpy of dissolution of hydrogen in a mixture of levulinic acid with water is positive, which means that the dissolution of hydrogen in a mixture is endothermic process. Normally the enthalpy of gas dissolution reflects the interactions (dispersive, polar, hydrogen bonding, etc.) of a gas with the solvent, and in this case, no interactions that would favor hydrogen dissolution exist. Energy is needed to form cavities in the solvent to be able to place the hydrogen molecules and at higher temperatures more free volume is available for hydrogen to dissolve in the liquid. With an increase in temperature, the solubility of hydrogen in both liquids (levulinic acid + water and levulinic acid) is increasing. The entropic part, which represents the disorder degree in the two-component and three-component system, is positive, therefore less order or more chaos by hydrogen dissolving in solvent. As in the case of guaiacol also here the Gibbs free energy of dissolution (Table 10) shows, that the dissolution of hydrogen is non-spontaneous process."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen solubility in two bio-based chemicals, guaiacol and levulinic acid, the latter with an addition of approx. 10% (w/w) of water is reported in this work at temperatures and pressures, from 322 K to 422 K and 5 MPa to 20 MPa, respectively. The solubility experiments were performed on the high-pressure view cell applying isothermal analytical method. The data for the measured systems are new and to our knowledge not available in the literature so far. The solubility of hydrogen in both, guaiacol as well as in a binary mixture levulinic acid + water is small, as expected, and is increasing linearly with pressure at constant temperature and is increasing with temperature. Such behavior was also predicted for hydrogen solubility in guaiacol by Pereira et al. [21] using GC-PPC-SAFT EOS and molecular simulation. The solubility was modeled quite successfully using SRK and PR-BM EOS for both systems, while PC-SAFT EOS was effectively applied only for hydrogen solubility in guaiacol. In modeling hydrogen solubility in guaiacol, the absolute average deviations in temperature and pressure was always lower than 1% and 0.1%, respectively and absolute average deviations in hydrogen solubility varied from 2.5 to 5.5%. SRK successfully performed modeling of hydrogen solubility in levulinic acid + water system with the absolute average deviations in temperature below 0.5%, in pressure and in x(H2) around 2%, in x(H2O) below 1.9% and x(LA) up to 1%. Using PR-BM EOS, higher absolute average deviations were obtained for x(H2O) (AAD up to 10%) and x(LA) (AAD up to 5.6%) in the liquid phase. SRK EOS was found to be more robust and easier to use, with less binary interaction parameters, therefore it was used to evaluate hydrogen Henry's constants in guaiacol, in the mixture of levulinic acid + water, in pure water and in pure levulinic acid. With increasing temperature Henry's constants of hydrogen in both investigated systems are decreasing, therefore the solubility of hydrogen is increasing with temperature increase. The solubility of hydrogen, which is a very light gas and does not form hydrogen bonds with guaiacol, levulinic acid and water, mainly depends on the free volume available in the solvent and this free volume is increasing with temperature. The evaluated hydrogen Henry's constants in water agree very well with the literature data [20], within 0.3% to 3%, while the hydrogen solubility in pure levulinic acid is of the order of magnitude of the hydrogen solubility in guaiacol. By adding around 10% (w/w) of water to levulinic acid, the Henry's constant increases for about 30% in the temperature range from 323 K up to 373 K. For both systems, the evaluated enthalpy of dissolution of hydrogen in solvent is positive, meaning that the dissolution of hydrogen is endothermic process. The entropic part, which represents the disorder degree in dissolving hydrogen to solvent system, is positive as well, which means more chaos in the solution after hydrogen dissolution. From both contributions, the evaluated Gibbs free energy of dissolution, which is a positive value shows the dissolution of hydrogen is non-spontaneous process in both studied systems."
