0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is an environmentally friendly energy resource and an ideal alternative to fossil fuels, and has the highest energy content per unit weight (142kJ/g or 61,000Btu/lb) of all the naturally occurring fuels (Das, 2009; Das and Veziroglu, 2008; Ren et al., 2009a). H2 can be produced by geological and biological processes in natural environments (Boyd et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2005). Biological hydrogen production using microorganisms is a promising method of utilizing low-value waste as raw materials (organic wastewater and biomass) to produce an energy source which requires a lower energy supply and has many other benefits compared with chemical–physical methods (Abreu et al., 2010; Chu et al., 2011; Das, 2009; Das and Veziroglu, 2008; Xing et al., 2008b). Dark-fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria (dHPB) such as Clostridium, Ethanoligenens, Enterobacter and Bacillus have been isolated from bioreactors and natural environments (Das, 2009; Das and Veziroglu, 2008; Ren et al., 2007, 2009a; Xing et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010). Clostridium is one of the highly-effective hydrogen producers within the Firmicutes phylum, and many strains of which have been isolated and studied (Jo et al., 2010; Lin and Shei, 2008; Morimoto et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Wang and Wan, 2008). Clostridium beijerinckii, which received much attention as a useful microorganism for butanol production (Ezeji et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008), recently has been found to be capable of hydrogen production (Hatch and Finneran, 2008; Kim et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008). Previous studies have shown that culture conditions or operating parameters can significantly affect cell growth and hydrogen production. For example, Wang and Wan (2008) studied the effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen production in a mixed culture, and found that glucose utilization decreased with Fe2+ concentration from 0 to 1500mg/l, and a maximum hydrogen yield of 311.2ml/g glucose was obtained at the Fe2+ concentration of 350mg/l. Li et al. (2008) investigated the effects of pH and glucose concentrations on hydrogen production by sludge in batch culture. Lin and Lay (2004) found that optimal concentrations of carbonate and phosphate enhanced the hydrogen production rate by 1.9-fold. Chong et al. (2009) studied the effects of pH, glucose and iron sulfate concentration on hydrogen yield by Clostridium butyricum EB6. Although culture conditions have been investigated widely, the optimal culture conditions for different species or strains vary. The aim of this study was to isolate, characterize and identify a hydrogen-producing bacterium from a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and assess hydrogen production. To determine the optimal conditions for maximum hydrogen production, the effects of culture temperature, pH, substrate concentration, nitrogen source and inoculum volume on hydrogen production were investigated."
1,Methods,
2,Isolation of hydrogen-producing bacterium,"2.1 Isolation of hydrogen-producing bacterium Anaerobic sludge was collected from a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) used for biohydrogen production. A bacterial suspension was produced by vortexing the sludge in an anaerobic tube containing 10ml of sterile anaerobic 1% NaCl and glass beads (2mm diameter). After serial dilution of the bacterial suspension, isolation was performed by the Hungate roll-tube technique (Hungate, 1969) with PYG medium (1l) containing 10g glucose, 3g peptone, 1g yeast extract, 21.5g Na2HPO4·12H2O, 8.1g KH2PO4·2H2O, 0.1g MgCl2·6H2O, 0.2g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1g l-cysteine, 10ml mineral salt solution (containing 0.01g/l MnSO4·7H2O, 0.05g/l ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01g/l H3BO3, 0.01g/l CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01g/lNa2MoO4, 0.2g/l CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01g/l AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.001g/l NiCl·6H2O, 2.0g/l N[(CH2)COO]3) and 10ml vitamin solution (containing 0.01g/l cobalamin, 0.025g/l vitamin C, 0.025g/l riboflavin, 0.02g/l citric acid, 0.05g/l pyridoxal, 0.01g/l folic acid, 0.025g/l creatine and 0.01g/l P-aminobenzoic acid). Single colonies were transferred to the same broth and incubated at 35°C for 2days. The roll-tube procedure was repeated several times until a pure culture was obtained. Routine cultivation was in anaerobic tubes (18×150mm) sealed with butyl rubber stoppers under a gaseous atmosphere of 99.999% N2 (200kPa) at 35°C."
3,Morphological test,"2.2 Morphological test Gram staining was performed as previously described (Beveridge, 2001). Morphological examinations were performed with a light microscope BX51 (Olympus, Japan), an atomic force microscope (AFM) (DI Bioscope, Veeco, USA) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (TECNAIG2, Philips). A small drop of 10 times diluted RZF-1108 suspension was placed and then smeared on the ethanol and HCl pretreated glass slide using an inoculating loop, and examined using AFM after air drying. A 5μl cell suspension of RZF-1108 was placed on a 200 mesh formvar carbon-coated copper grid, and wicked off after 3min. The sample was soaked in 5μl of uranyl acetate (2%) for 30s, then drained, air-dried and examined using TEM."
4,Identification and phylogenetic analysis,"2.3 Identification and phylogenetic analysis Total genomic DNA was extracted from strain RZF-1108 using the Bacterial DNA Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc., China). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified as previously described (Xing et al., 2006). The PCR product was purified using the Gel Extraction Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc, China), and cloned with the pMD19-T plasmid vector system (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The 16S rRNA gene sequence was aligned and identified against existing sequences in the GenBank database using the BLAST program."
5,Hydrogen production in batch culture,"2.4 Hydrogen production in batch culture The PYG medium, as described above, was dispensed anaerobically into 100ml anaerobic culture bottles. Prior to testing, the bottles containing 50ml liquid medium were flushed with ultra high-pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for 5min, sealed with rubber plugs, and autoclaved at 121°C for 15min. The bottles were shaken in an air bath at 140rpm. The gas was collected by the draining method after culturing for 20h. To determine the effects of culture conditions on hydrogen production, temperature, pH value, substrate concentration, nitrogen source and inoculum volume were alternately varied. The culture temperature of 25–40°C and initial pH of 4–10 (adjusted by 1mol/l HCl or 1mol/l NaOH solution) were set. The glucose concentration of 5–15g/l was fixed in the experiment in order to study the effect of substrate concentration. The nitrogen sources at a concentration of 4g/l, included peptone, yeast extract, beef extract or urea which was supplemented in the medium. The inoculum volume varied in the range of 2–15% (v/v)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Glucose was measured by a glucose assay kit (Rongsheng Biotech, Shanghai, China) using the peroxidase method. Biomass was measured as cell dry weight (CDW) according to a previously described method (Ren et al., 2009b). The hydrogen content, volatile fatty acids and alcohol were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 4890) as previously described (Xing et al., 2008a)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Identification of a hydrogen-producing isolate,"3.1 Identification of a hydrogen-producing isolate A strain designated as RZF-1108 was isolated from the anaerobic sludge in the CSTR. RZF-1108 is a gram-positive motile rod with a terminal flagellum. The bacterial cells occurred singly or in pairs and had a diameter of 0.7–1.0μm and a length of 3.0–5.0μm (see supplemental material Fig. S1). Spores were observed when the conditions were unfavorable for RZF-1108. A colony of strain RZF-1108 was milk-white in color, circular, opaque and slightly concave with a ring margin, and had a diameter of about 2.0mm after cultivation on agar medium at 35°C for 24h. Its main byproducts from glucose fermentation were acetic acid, butyric acid, H2, CO2, and lower concentrations of ethanol and butanol. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of 1504bp (GenBank accession number GQ375085) was amplified from the genomic DNA of strain RZF-1108, and showed 99% identity with C. beijerinckii NCIMB8052 (Fig. 1 ). The physiological and morphological characters were also consistent with C. beijerinckii. Thus, RZF-1108 was identified as a new strain within the species C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis and physiobiochemical characteristics."
9,Effect of culture temperature on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of culture temperature on hydrogen production Growth and hydrogen production of strain RZF-1108 were observed at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 40°C with an optimal temperature of 35°C. The hydrogen production and yield, and cell dry weight (CDW) increased with increasing temperature (from 25°C to 35°C) and decreased at temperatures >35°C. The maximum hydrogen yield and CDW were 1.86mol H2/mol glucose and 1.07g/l at 35°C, respectively (Fig. 2 ). Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) showed the same trend as cell biomass and hydrogen production. Final pH corresponded negatively with VFAs production. The hydrogen production rate was low at 25°C, similar to hydrogen evolution, yield, CDW and VFAs, then increased and changed slightly when the temperature was between 30 and 38°C, then decreased. Lower or higher temperatures inhibited the growth and hydrogen production of strain RZF-1108."
10,Effect of initial pH on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of initial pH on hydrogen production Hydrogen production and bacterial growth were not observed at the initial pH of 4.0. When the initial pH increased from 5.0 to 7.0, the hydrogen yield increased from 0.53mol to 1.75mol H2/mol glucose, and then decreased gradually when pH was increased further (Fig. 3 ). The CDW, accumulative hydrogen production and VFAs had a similar trend to that of hydrogen yield. The hydrogen production rate was increased with increasing initial pH, with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 187.72ml H2/g CDW·h−1 at pH 10.0. The final pH values in different initial pH were almost in an oblique line as hydrogen production rate, with the exception of the initial pH of 7.0. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.75mol H2/mol glucose and maximum CDW of 0.95g/l were obtained when the initial pH was 7.0 and 6.5, respectively. These results were consistent with previous studies in which hydrogen production and cell growth were dependent on initial pH (Li et al., 2008; Li and Fang, 2007; Pan et al., 2008). Low pH usually results in a lower level of ATP in the cell and inhibition of bacterial growth and activity (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985; Ferchichi et al., 2005)."
11,Effect of glucose concentration on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of glucose concentration on hydrogen production The initial glucose concentrations affected hydrogen production and growth of strain RZF-1108 (Fig. 4 ). The hydrogen yield and production rate increased with increasing glucose supplementation from 5g/l to 9g/l, reached a maximum of 1.80mol H2/mol glucose and 117.30ml H2/g CDW·h−1 at 9g/l, and then decreased. The hydrogen evolution and CDW showed the same trend as that of hydrogen yield and production rate, however, the maximum of 1891ml H2/l medium and 0.99g/l were obtained when the glucose concentration was 10g/l. Substrate utilization and final pH decreased with increasing glucose concentration, and some substrate remained when the glucose concentration was over 9g/l. Enhancement of cell growth and VFAs slowed when the glucose concentration was higher than 10g/l, implying that pH decreased due to the accumulation of VFAs, and inhibited hydrogen production when the concentration was over a certain threshold."
12,Effect of nitrogen source on hydrogen production,"3.5 Effect of nitrogen source on hydrogen production C. beijerinckii can utilize various organic and inorganic nitrogen sources such as beef extract, peptone, yeast extract, urea, NH4NO3 and NaNO3 (Pan et al., 2008). The medium supplemented with yeast extract showed the highest hydrogen yield of 1.26mol H2/mol glucose, hydrogen evolution of 1417ml H2/l medium, CDW of 1.14g/l, VFAs, and lowest final pH of 4.81 of the four nitrogen sources tested (Fig. 5 ). The hydrogen yield and hydrogen evolution when cultured with beef extract were better than those obtained in peptone and urea. Our experimental results indicated that a suitable nitrogen source could facilitate cell growth and hydrogen evolution, and yeast extract was found to be a favorable organic nitrogen source for cell growth and hydrogen production in strain RZF-1108. The lower hydrogen yield in the presence of single nitrogen source indicated that combined nitrogen sources may be benefit for enhancing cell growth and hydrogen production. The effects of different nitrogen sources combination need to be further investigated in the future."
13,Effect of inoculum volume on hydrogen production,"3.6 Effect of inoculum volume on hydrogen production The inoculum volume in the range of 2–15% (v/v) influenced the hydrogen yield, hydrogen evolution and CDW. Although the VFAs, final pH and CDW changed little with different inoculum volumes, glucose utilization increased about 10% with the inoculum volume increased from 2% to 15% (see supplemental material Fig. S2). This implied that excessive inoculum volume led to substrate over-consumption and cell overgrowth in a short time, which resulted in a rapid decrease in pH and hydrogen production. The hydrogen yield and evolution were a little higher when the inoculum volume ranged from 6% to 10%, and the highest hydrogen yield of 1.91mol H2/mol glucose occurred with an inoculum volume of 8% (v/v)."
14,Hydrogen production under optimal conditions,"3.7 Hydrogen production under optimal conditions A hydrogen evolution of 2209ml H2/l medium, a yield of 1.97mol H2/mol glucose and a production rate of 104.20ml H2/g CDW·h−1 were obtained under the following optimal conditions: 9g/l of glucose, initial pH of 7.0, inoculum volume of 8% and 35°C. The CDW and final pH were 1.06g/l and 4.68, respectively. The hydrogen yield of C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 was comparable with that obtained by other clostridia (Chen et al., 2001; Heyndrickx et al., 1986; Pan et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006)."
15,Conclusion,"A hydrogen-producing strain was isolated from anaerobic sludge in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), and was identified as C. beijerinckii RZF-1108. Yeast extract was the most favorable nitrogen source for cell growth and hydrogen production in strain RZF-1108. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.97mol H2/mol glucose and production rate of 104.20ml H2/g CDW·h−1 were obtained under optimal condition of 9g/l of glucose, 35°C, initial pH of 7.0 and an inoculum volume of 8% (v/v)."
