0,Introduction,"2-Phenylethanol, which can be generated from the hydrogenation of styrene oxide, has an aroma that is similar to the essence of rose petals and is thus used primarily in the perfume industry. 2-Phenylethanol (commonly referred to 2-phenylethyl alcohol) is one of the main components of the natural essence that is known as rose oil and can be obtained naturally from the extracts of this flower [1,2]. Commercially, this alcohol is considered a valuable product, because it has many applications. Due to its pleasant smell, it is used as a fragrance in the perfume, soaps, and food industries. Given its bactericidal and fungicidal properties, it is used to prepare antiseptics and deodorants. It appears in the formulation of various cosmetics, especially hair dyes and shampoos. It is also used as a local anesthetic agent [3–6]. In the chemical industry, 2-phenylethanol is used to prepare phenylethyl ester, phenylacetaldehyde, and benzoic acid, which are widely used in the fragrance industry. Because 2-phenylethanol contains an aromatic ring, it is applied in nitration, sulfonation, and halogenation processes to produce nitrobenzene, benzenesulfonic acid, and byproducts from aromatic nitration—compounds that have tremendous significance in the chemical industry. Benzenesulfonic acids are used in the synthesis of detergents, dyes, and sulfa drugs. Benzenesulfonyl chloride is a precursor of sulfonamides, which are used in chemotherapy [7–9]. 2-Phenylethanol is conventionally prepared by Grignard process, in which phenyl magnesium chloride reacts with ethylene oxide to produce phenylethoxy magnesium chloride, which reacts with sulfuric acid to generate 2-phenylethanol [10]. However, the main by-products (eg, biphenyl) are difficult to remove, even by vacuum distillation. In the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, 2-phenylethanol is obtained as a low-purity by-product in the production of styrene monomer and propylene oxide [11]. 2-Phenylethanol also arises in small quantities by ultraviolet irradiation of styrene in the presence of such acid materials as zeolites and ethanol as the reaction medium [12]. These methods have serious drawbacks, including the high amounts of catalysts that required [13], the generation of corrosive substances [8], the irrecoverability of the catalyst [14], and the insufficient quality of the alcohol with regard to the requirements for its use in the perfume industry [15]. The use of these types of reagents produces a mixture of primary and secondary alcohols and other byproducts that require subsequent separation steps. Thus, new viable and cleaner processes are being developed to obtain 2-phenylethanol to address environmental problems and minimize costs, underscoring technology that is based on the catalytic hydrogenation of styrene oxide [16–19]. Heterogeneous Pt-, Ni-, and Pd-supported catalysts have been tested in the hydrogenation of styrene oxide to obtain 2-phenylethanol [16]. In these processes, competition arises between the hydrogenation and isomerization reactions, influencing the resulting products. In the hydrogenation reaction, 2-phenylethanol and 1-phenylethanol are the main reaction products, whereas during isomerization, aldehydes or ketones are synthesized. The selectivity toward any of these products is influenced significantly by the acid-base properties of the catalytic support, the metal, and the reaction conditions. An Ni/MgO-supported catalyst has been tested in the hydrogenation of styrene, effecting 100% selectivity toward phenyl ethanol. The basic characteristics of MgO minimize the formation of ethylbenzene [14]. With Pd as the metal and Al2O3 as the acid catalytic support, the main products were 1-phenylethanol and phenylacetaldehyde [20], whereas the Pd/MgO catalyst (basic support) favored the production of 2-phenylethanol [20]. In the case of Pt metal that is supported on Pt/γ-Al2O3 (a solid acid), the selectivity led to the formation of 1-phenylalcohol and phenylacetaldehyde, whereas Pt on basic support (Pt/MgO) favored the formation of 90% 2-phenylethanol [21]. Notably, the surface acid-base properties of the catalytic support are essential in the selectivity of the hydrogenation of styrene oxide. The mixed TiO2-ZrO2 oxide was tested as a catalyst in the decomposition of isopropanol [22]. In this oxide, an acid-base duality co-existed on its surface, and the selectivity to reaction products depended on the acid-base properties. Conversely, metallic Pt catalysts are used widely in hydrogenation reactions. Thus, in this study, we have proposed Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of styrene oxide. We aimed to determine the surface acid-base properties of the TiO2-ZrO2 catalytic support and their influence on the hydrogenation of styrene oxide and the selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol production to identify an economical and environment-friendly process using heterogeneous catalysis. To this end, the catalytic support (TiO2-ZrO2) was first prepared by sol-gel method and then impregnated with a platinum solution with various molar percentages of platinum. Several physiochemical techniques were used to characterize the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts. High selectivity to 2-phenylethanol was achieved using the catalyst that contained less platinum and 60 °C as the ideal temperature."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium n-butoxide (98%, Aldrich), zirconium n-butoxide (99%, Aldrich), n-butanol (Baker, 99%), nitric acid (70%, Aldrich), and H2PtCl6, (99%, Aldrich) were used."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation The amounts of chemical precursor in the preparation of the various samples are reported in Table 1 . 2.2.1 TiO2-ZrO2 Appropriate amounts of the titanium and zirconium alkoxides were added simultaneously dropwise to n-butanol (previously cooled at 0 °C). Then, the pH was adjusted to 3.0 with nitric acid. Next, the temperature was increased to reflux the mixture at 70 °C, and water was added for the hydrolysis. Immediately after the onset of gelation, the samples were dried under a vacuum for 24 h at 70 °C. Finally, the powders were annealed at 400 °C for 4 h in an air atmosphere. 2.2.2 TiO2-ZrO2 (X % Pt) The powder that was obtained above was divided into 4 aliquots, 3 of which were impregnated with various amounts of platinum; the remainder was used as a reference. The molar percentages were 1%, 2%, and 3% platinum, using H2PtCl6 as the platinum precursor. The 3 Pt catalysts were prepared by impregnation method [23]. Finally, the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts were dried and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in a conventional muffle."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms The textural properties (specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size) of the catalysts were analyzed by nitrogen physisorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2405. The surface area was calculated from the adsorption isotherms per the BET equation, and the volume, diameter, and distribution of the pores were calculated by BJH method from the desorption isotherms. All samples were degassed at 300 °C under a vacuum for 6 h before analysis. 2.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts were obtained on an Empyrean multipurpose research x-ray diffractometer (PANalytical) with a Cu-Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) source. Diffraction intensity was measured between 4° and 70° with a 2θ step of 0.02°. 2.3.3 FTIR spectroscopy The FTIR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer GX spectrophotometer that was equipped with an ATR detector. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature on a computerized Spex 1403 that contained a double monochromator spectrophotometer with 1 cm-1 resolution, in combination with an argon laser at 514.5 nm (Lexel Lasers) at a power level of 40 mW in the laser head. The spectra were acquired directly from the powder samples in retro-scattering geometry. 2.3.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) graphics of all catalysts were obtained using a Quanta 3D FEG microscope. 2.3.5 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) A JEM-ARM200CF microscope with atomic capacity was used, which operates in TEM or STEM mode, using acceleration voltages of 80-200 kV. It has a cold-cathode electron gun and a spherical aberration corrector for STEM mode, with a resolution limit of up to 78 ppm. The microscope has coupled detectors for chemical analysis by EDS with a spectral resolution of 0.3 eV. The samples were suspended in isopropyl alcohol and then deposited onto a copper grid that was fixed to a sample holder with double-sided Cu-tape. They remained in the prechamber for 1 h. 2.3.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS spectra were recorded at room temperature on a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) that was operated at 150 W and a voltage of 15 kV in constant analyzer energy (CAE) mode. The peak deconvolution and curve fitting were performed with XPS Peak, version 4.1 2.3.7 Pyridine adsorption-FTIR study For FTIR-pyridine adsorption, transparent tablets were placed in a stainless steel sample holder; then, the holder was placed in a quartz cell. This latter had embedded calcium windows, and vacuum and heating systems. The samples were pretreated at 400 °C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature. Then, the pyridine was introduced into the cell, maintaining contact with the sample for 30 min until it was adsorbed. Excess pyridine was removed with a vacuum, and pyridine desorption was achieved by heating at 40 °C and 60 °C. The resulting spectra were obtained in a Nicolet FTIR 710SX spectrometer. Only the Lewis acidity of the catalysts at 40 °C and 60 °C was quantified. 2.3.8 Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) The total acidity of the catalysts was determined by NH3-TPD test using a Belcat B (Bel Japan) that contained a thermal conductivity detector, which records the changes in NH3 concentration in the outlet gas stream. An NH3-He gas mixture (Praxair Inc., certified 5% mol concentration of NH3) was used as the analytical gas. A total of 50 mg of each sample was first pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow and then cooled to 50 °C. Next, the material was exposed to an NH3-He flow (50 mL min-1) for 1 h and heated at 10 °C min-1 between 30-300 °C. NH3 in the effluent gas was continuously recorded by a TCD detector as a function of temperature. A calibration measurement was performed to quantify the NH3 that was chemisorbed, by pulse method. Both TCD detector and temperature were stabilized for 90 min under helium flow, after which 10 pulses of NH3 (5% mol fraction) was injected for 10 s at a flow rate of 50 mL/min into an empty cell."
5,Hydrogenation of styrene oxide,"2.4 Hydrogenation of styrene oxide Previously, the catalysts (Pt/TiO2-ZrO2) were treated thermally at 350 °C for 2 h at a hydrogen flow rate of 55 ml/min. The reaction was performed in the liquid phase, using 1 g of catalyst, 150 ml absolute ethanol, 2 mmol of styrene oxide, a hydrogen flow of 2 ml/s, and magnetic stirring, at 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively, for 2 h. The reaction products were analyzed and quantified on a Varian Star 3600 CX gas chromatograph, equipped with a flame ionization detector and an HP-5 capillary column (50 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 microns). The reaction products and the degree of conversion were calculated, assuming first-order kinetics. The following equation was used to determine the reaction rate: - r a = F a o X a m where -ra is the reaction rate in mol/sg, Fao is the molar flux of styrene oxide, and m is the mass of the catalyst. X a ( C o n v e r s i o n o f s t y r e n e o x i d e % m o l ) = ∑ i n Y i C o u t + ∑ i n Y i Cout is the moles of styrene oxide, and Yi is the moles of the various reaction products. The selectivity was determined per the following equation: S i ( m o l % ) = Y i ∑ i n Y i × 100"
6,Results and Discussion,
7,N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms,"3.1 N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for each catalyst. Per the IUPAC classification, all are type IV isotherms, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. The adsorption-desorption isotherms present a broad hysteresis cycle of type H2. The TiO2-ZrO2 catalytic support had the largest area, at 174 m2/g. With the addition of platinum, the surface area decreased slightly, perhaps due to the partial filling of the pores with platinum particles (see Table 2 ). Nevertheless, all catalysts had similar surface areas. The textural values for each catalyst are shown in Table 2, which shows that the average pore diameter also fell slightly with the addition of platinum. However, based on the distribution of pore sizes (inset in Fig. 1), there were low quantities of different pore sizes, but all fell within the mesopore interval. The pore diameters for the 2%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 and 3%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 samples were similar; however, both had the same distribution of pore sizes."
8,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 2 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared catalysts. All materials exhibited diffraction lines at 2θ = 25º, 37º, 48º, 54º, 55º, 62º, 71º, and 75º, which characterizes the anatase (tetragonal) phase from titanium dioxide. The only difference between diffractograms was that with the addition of platinum, the peak (101) decreased. Notably, platinum and ZrO2 peaks were not observed, suggesting that platinum nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly throughout the network of the catalytic support or that the amount of platinum was below the limits of detection of powder x-ray. In a similar study, Basahel et al. examined iron nanoparticles that had been loaded onto zirconium oxide. They observed that to detect certain phases of iron oxide on zirconium oxide, concentrations of iron above 5% were necessary [24]. Although they used iron, their results agree with our XRD data, because we used 3% Pt as the maximum concentration. Conversely, ZrO2 has 3 important polymorphic structures—monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic—which depend on the temperature treatment [25]. In zirconium-silicate composites, a high temperature of 1250 °C is necessary to form the crystalline tetragonal ZrO2 phase [25]. Although our catalysts contain 10% ZrO2, they were thermally treated at 400 °C, which is a relatively low temperature. At this temperature, the ZrO2 phase might have been amorphous; thus, no crystalline ZrO2 phase was observed."
9,FTIR spectroscopy,"3.3 FTIR spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of the ZrO2-TiO2 and Pt/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The bands at 1440-1450 cm-1 correspond to the vibrations of the organic groups of nonhydrolyzed zirconium and titanium precursors. The vibration bands of the -CH2- and -CH3 functional groups appeared at 2850 and 2920 cm-1, respectively. The vibration band at 462 cm-1 is attributed to the Zr-O bonds, and the vibration at 606 cm-1 is related to Ti-O-Ti bonds. The band at 536 cm-1 can be assigned to the vibration of the Zr-O-Ti mixed bonds [26,27]. Because the support is ZrO2-TiO2 and because the Pt content is low, all spectra were similar, and even the intensities of the bands were identical, but due to the low content of the Pt, this element can not be observed using this technique [28]."
10,Scanning electron microscopy,"3.4 Scanning electron microscopy The morphology of Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 was also observed by scanning electron microscopy, as seen in Fig. 4 . All materials had a rough surface that was characterized by many small and agglomerated particles. Porous plate-like structures with channels were observed on the addition of platinum. Granules adhered to the surface, some of which were larger than 100 nm, and could have been metallic aggregates, because they increased in size as the amount of Pt rose. The high rate of aggregates favors the catalytic activity, because platinum metallic particles are essential for opening the rings of the epoxide in the hydrogenation of styrene oxide [29]. Yet, the increase in the formation of channels and holes can favor the generation of structural defects that, in turn, improve the activity of the catalyst. The EDS graph for the catalytic support (TiO2-ZrO2) shows no presence of platinum—only bands that belong to oxygen, titanium, and zirconium atoms were observed (Fig. 4a'). A low concentration of platinum was seen in the EDS graphs for the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts (Fig. 4b'-d'), in addition those that correspond to the catalytic support (Ti, O, and Zr signals)."
11,High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM),"3.5 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) HR-TEM images of the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 samples are shown in Fig. 5 . In the 2%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 image (5a), black and thick particles can be seen on the catalytic support, corresponding to platinum nanoparticles, approximately 10-20 nm (Fig. 5b). Further, the catalytic support is a mixture of amorphous and crystalline phases (Fig. 5c). To determine to TiO2 or ZrO2 phase this crystallinity belongs, the DigitalMicrograph software was used. Fig. 5c shows the selected area of TiO2 and ZiO2 in the 2%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst. In Fig. 5c, you can see the TiO2 network lines (as expected) appear in the selected region. However, ZrO2 network lines were also observed. Fig. 5c shows the interplanar spacing d = 0.340 nm corresponding to the (110) plane of the TiO2 and the ZrO2 network spacing d = 0.244 nm, which belongs to the (111) plane of the ZrO2 [30]. The spacing of the crystal lattice indicates the presence of crystallinity of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the prepared catalysts. The crystalline phase of Pt was not observed, although the dispersed particles are seen. The 3%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 image shows Pt nanoparticles that are smaller and more dispersed than in the previous sample (Fig. 5d). The platinum nanoparticles are roughly 5 nm (Fig. 5e). Fig. 5f shows the same amorphous-crystalline phases mixture seen in Fig. 5c."
12,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"3.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The surfaces of the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts were analyzed by XPS. The deconvoluted curves that identify the Pt atom are presented here. The deconvolution (Fig. 6 ) showed peaks at 70.9, 71.4, and 74.4 eV, corresponding to Pt° (Fig. 6a). The peak at 75.3 eV is attributed to Pt4+. The intensity of the Pt peak increases with the amount of Pt, as shown by the scale (see Fig. 6b and c, respectively). The results show the coexistence of platinum oxide (PtO4) and elemental Pt (Pt°) in the Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts. Fig. 7 a shows the XPS spectra for TiO2 and ZrO2, respectively. In the case of TiO2, 2 peaks were observed at 459 eV (Ti 2p3/2 ) and 464 eV (Ti 2p1/2 ), both corresponding to Ti4+ species of the anatase phase of the 3% Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 7a). The other spectra were omitted, because TiO2-ZrO2 was the catalytic support in all samples, and because they were similar. In the case of ZrO2 (see Fig. 7b), Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 species can be seen, with band energies in the range of 182.3–184.7 eV, belonging to Zr+4. The band energy values for Zr 3d and Ti 2p did not change with the addition of Pt, thus indicating the integrity of the support structure."
13,Pyridine adsorption by FTIR for the determination of Lewis acidity,"3.7 Pyridine adsorption by FTIR for the determination of Lewis acidity FTIR-pyridine adsorption is used widely to determine the surface acidity type on solid oxides. Infrared spectroscopy of pyridine that is linked to acid Bronsted sites (acid hydroxyl), Lewis centers (metal-coordinated pyridine), and cations (such as alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth, and transition metal ions) is a useful tool for determining surface acidity in solids due to the sharp bands that can be observed in the region of deformation in the spectrum infrared [31]. For example, Brönsted acid sites give rise to bands at approximately 1540 cm-1, whereas those at 1450 cm-1 are indicative of Lewis sites. Fig. 8 shows the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption on the surface of the various catalysts. The band at 1600 cm-1 behaves identically to that at 1445 cm-1, and both are assigned to strong Lewis-type sites, whereas the band at 1576 cm-1 is assigned to weak Lewis sites. These catalysts did not show Bronsted-type acidity, because no characteristic band that is related to Brönsted sites was found. The quantification of adsorbed pyridine is reported in Fig. 9 . Lewis acidity increased considerably as the amount of Pt rose, consistent with [32]. The activity in hydrogenation has been attributed primarily to noble metals, whereas the selectivity has been associated with the acid-base properties of the support. Also, changes in selectivity foster new Lewis acid properties or promising redox properties [33]. Fig. 8 also shows the quantification of Lewis sites at 40 °C and 60 °C. Fewer Lewis sites were seen at 60 °C due to the effect of temperature."
14,Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD),"3.8 Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia is another method for determining the total acidity of solid catalysts and the strength of the acidity [34]. Fig. 10 shows the deconvoluted thermographs of ammonia desorption, and the acidity values are shown in Table 3 . The acidity increased with platinum content in the catalytic support (TiO2-ZrO2), with a maximum value of 1682 mol/g for the catalyst that contained the most platinum (3%Pt-ZrO2-TiO2). As seen in Fig. 10, the acidity corresponded to the desorption of NH3 in 2 regions that were associated with moderate (120 °C) and medium (239 °C) acidity. These results suggest that Pt/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts have remarkable acidic properties with moderate strength. Further, the maximum desorption temperature changed according to the platinum content—as the Pt concentration increased, the desorption peak shifted at slightly higher temperatures, indicating stronger acidic sites. The thermodesorption showed a higher acidity for the 2%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 and 3%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts versus the other solids. In the 3%/ PtTiO2-ZrO2 thermogram, a sharp peak was observed at 100 °C, indicating that most of the acidic sites were weak, but at 169 °C, a small shoulder appeared, due to the existence of stronger sites; the small peak at 269 °C indicates acid sites with greater strength. Comparing the acid strength, as measured by NH3-TPD and the pyridine adsorption by FTIR, we conclude that the solids have remarkable acidity that increases as the amount of platinum rises, and this acidity is a moderate Lewis-type."
15,Catalytic activity,"3.9 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the Pt/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts was tested in the hydrogenation of styrene oxide in a liquid phase. The hydrogenation of styrene oxide was performed at 40 °C and 60 °C. The maximum conversion of styrene (85%) at 40 °C was attained using the 3%Pt/ZrO2-TiO2 catalyst (Fig. 11 ). The conversion decreased as the platinum content fell from 80% to 51% when the catalytic support was tested. The rise in activity might have been due to the high distribution of Pt° on the surface of the catalytic support and the significant generation of surface acid sites in the catalysts. However, the catalytic support was active. As seen in Fig. 12 , the main reaction products were 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylacetaldehyde at 40 °C. Greater selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol was observed using the catalyst with lower platinum content. As a function of time, selectivity for 2-phenylethanol decreased slightly, and greater production of 2-phenylacetaldehyde was seen. When the catalytic reaction was carried out at 60 °C, the conversion increased (Fig. 13 ). Unlike the reaction at a lower temperature, at 60 °C, the conversion at 180 minutes reached nearly 100% for all samples (see Fig. 13). Conversely, the selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol decreased over time (Fig. 14 a), peaking with the 1% Pt/ZrO2-TiO2 catalyst. At high temperature, the effect of Pt was negligible. However, the linear conversion remained as a function of time using the 3 catalysts and catalytic support, whereas the selectivity was altered. The higher selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol was achieved using the catalyst that contained less platinum and a temperature of 60 °C. The catalyst with more platinum became more selective for 2-phenylacetaldehyde at 60 °C (see Fig. 14a and b), consistent with Bergada et al. [14]. The acidity results show that as the amount of platinum increased, the Lewis-type acidity and strength of these acid sites rose. Although the TiO2-ZrO2 catalytic support did not show surface acidity (by FTIR-pyridine), it harbored weak acidic sites by NH3-TPD. This catalytic support effected moderate catalytic conversion, toward 2-phenylethanol, at 40 °C. The higher selectivity for 2-phenylethanol with the less acidic catalyst is consistent with a previous study, in which neutral and basic catalytic supports, such as Pt/MgO and activated carbon, were selective toward the formation of 2-phenyl alcohol, whereas acid catalytic supports, such as Pt/Al2O3, favored phenylacetaldehyde [35]. The more acidic catalyst is this study favored the formation of the aldehyde, whereas the catalyst with the lowest platinum content was the least acidic and the most selective toward the alcohol. However, the reaction temperature also influenced the selectivity and surface acidity. The acidity surface decreased as the temperature rose. Similarly, the selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol increased as the temperature climbed. Conversely, the x-ray photoelectron spectra revealed 2 oxidation states for platinum (Pt0 and Pt4+), and the oxides on the catalytic support maintained their integral oxidation states for all catalysts. These results suggest that Pt0 corresponds to the metallic nanoparticles that were seen on the surface of the catalytic support by atomic force microscopy. Another Pt4+ is perhaps forming surface oxide species. In the production of 2-phenylethanol using heterogeneous catalytic processes, 2 important reactions are in competition: hydrogenation, to form alcohols, such as 2-phenylethanol, and isomerization, which yields the corresponding phenylacetaldehyde. Selectivity toward any of the products depends on the acidity of the catalysts. Mitsui et al. have suggested that this elementary reaction in basic medium decreases the interaction between the oxygen in styrene oxide and the catalytic surface, minimizing the formation of ethylbenzene and favoring 2-phenylethanol [14,36]. Based on our results, we propose the platinum atoms (Pt4+) as Lewis acid sites, which perhaps form a surface oxide, as suggested in Fig. 15 a. Initially, styrene oxide is strongly adsorbed onto Lewis acid sites through the epoxide ring, which is opened by a reaction between the oxygen atom and the hydride ion (Hδ+) that is formed by the absorption of onto the surface of the platinum nanoparticles. Subsequently, the phenyl acetaldehyde is formed according to Fig. 15a. In the catalysts with few and weak acid sites, styrene oxide reacts directly with the H2 that is superficially attached to Pt nanoparticles through the oxygen atom of the epoxide ring, as suggested in Fig. 15b."
16,Conclusions,"The morphology of the TiO2-ZrO2 catalytic support consists of mixed amorphous-crystalline phases. On its surface, nanoparticles, black and approximately 5-20 nm, were identified, which were related to metallic platinum particles, the size of which decreased as the amount of platinum rose. Crystalline anatase was the only phase that was observed in both the catalytic supports and all catalysts by XRD. However, crystalline zirconium oxide was also identify by HR-TEM. The surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter were slightly affected by the addition of platinum, declining when platinum was added, but all samples had high surface areas. The incorporation of platinum into the TiO2-ZrO2 catalytic support led to the development of superficial Lewis acid properties of weak to medium strength. The catalytic activity and selectivity were affected by the surface acid properties of the catalysts. Greater conversion was achieved with the more acidic catalyst. However, the selectivity toward 2-phenylethanol was enhanced when the acidity decreased. The catalytic activity was also affected by the reaction temperature. At a higher temperature, the conversion and selectivity to 2-phenylethanol improved. The 1%Pt/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst and a temperature of 60 °C were the optimal conditions for obtaining the highest conversion of styrene oxide and better selectivity for 2-phenylethanol."
