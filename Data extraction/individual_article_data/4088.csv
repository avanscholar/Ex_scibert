0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines is highly valued by researchers for its wide usefulness in the production of numerous chemicals, such as drugs, pigments, agrochemicals, and polymers [1–4]. Among the available methodologies, metal catalysts or supported metal catalysts (e.g., Raney nickel, Pd/C) are frequently employed [5,6]. However, owing to the excessive cost, limited abundance, and environmental hazards of these catalysts, their application in large-scale production is limited. Further, developing a facile approach to synthesizing excellent catalysts for hydrogenation remains a great challenge. Therefore, considering the need to protect the environment, conserve resources, and reduce costs, it is essential to develop good methods of substituting active and inexpensive catalysts for traditional metal catalysts. In recent years, metal-free catalysts have attracted much attention because they were found to be potential alternatives to metal catalysts in many important catalytic reactions (e.g., the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction, oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation) [7–11]. Either a metal-free catalyst contains no metal elements or its metal impurities do not participate in catalytic reactions [12]. Carbon materials are regarded as ideal metal-free catalysts owing to their excellent physical and chemical properties and abundance. However, direct use of carbon materials as catalysts has often failed to meet the requirements for application because of a lack of active sites. Hence, efforts have been made to improve the activity of carbon catalysts by modifying the surface or doping heteroatoms (N, P, S, B, etc.) into the carbon skeleton [13–16]. Doping N into carbon materials was demonstrated to be effective for surface property improvement, defect formation, and redistribution of electrons [17]. N atoms, with comparable atomic size and hybridization of orbitals similar to those of C atoms, can be doped into carbon materials of diverse types and act as electron donors. Although doping with N can feasibly improve the catalytic activity of carbon materials, the type of nitrogen that plays a critical role in diverse catalytic reactions is still under debate. In recent years, many studies have been conducted to investigate this subject. Because pyridinic N is preferentially embedded on the edge of the carbon layer, Guo and his coworkers prepared edge-patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite with dominant pyridinic N by Ar+ etching of the surface through a Ni mask, followed by pyrolysis in NH3. ORR results demonstrated that active sites were created by pyridinic N, more specifically, by C atoms with Lewis basicity next to pyridinic N [18]. He et al. prepared catalysts in which the type and amount of N species were tuned by varying the ions in ionic liquids [19]. In another case, nitrogen-doped layered carbon with different nitrogen contents was prepared, and graphitic N was found to be essential for oxidation of arylalkanes. Analogously, the carbon atoms adjacent to the doped N were found to play a key role in both oxidation of ethylbenzene [20] and reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) by sodium borohydride [21]. The mechanism of the hydrogenation reaction is still unknown. The exact roles that different nitrogen species in N-doped carbon catalysts play in hydrogenation remain unclear. N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are frequently used for hydrogenation of nitro compounds. However, they have been employed mainly as supports for metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, Ni, Co) [22–25]. NCNTs are seldom used alone as catalysts for hydrogenation. In this study, we used two biological reagents, melanin and protoporphyrin IX, as nitrogen dopants to prepare NCNTs with different outer diameters (ODs) through a facile pyrolysis route. Further, hydrogenation of nitroarenes over these metal-free catalysts was systematically investigated. For comparison, N-doped graphene (NG) and N-doped acetylene carbon black (NACB) were also prepared by the same procedure, and their hydrogenation performances were tested. The results of hydrogenation catalyzed by NCNTs under relatively mild reaction conditions were comparable to those of hydrogenation catalyzed by supported metal catalysts [26–28]. Interestingly, pyridinic N contributed little to the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts, whereas graphitic N played a key role in hydrogenation."

3,"Synthesis of NCNTs, NG and NACB","2.2 Synthesis of NCNTs, NG and NACB Carbon supports (180.0 mg), 114.0 mg of melanin or 108.5 mg of protoporphyrin IX, and 16 mL of absolute ethanol were mixed in a flask; the final mass fraction of nitrogen relative to the carbon materials was 6%. The solution was stirred for 10 h at room temperature, and then the solvent (ethanol) was evaporated. The residue was scraped off and transferred to a ceramic crucible, where it was pyrolyzed in N2 for 2 h at 600, 700, 800, or 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The NCNTs obtained using melanin and protoporphyrin IX as the nitrogen source are denoted as m-NCNTs and p-NCNTs, respectively. The as-synthesized catalysts and their abbreviations are listed in Table S1."
4,Synthesis of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) at different heating rates,"2.3 Synthesis of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) at different heating rates MWCNTs (180.0 mg, ODs 10–20 nm), 114.0 mg of melanin, and 16 mL of absolute ethanol were mixed in a flask. The solution was stirred for 10 h at room temperature, and then the solvent (ethanol) was evaporated. The residue was scraped off and transferred to a ceramic crucible, where it was pyrolyzed in N2 for 2 h at 800 °C at a heating rate of 0.5, 1, or 10 °C min−1. The as-synthesized catalysts and their abbreviations are listed in Table S3."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For sample preparation, the powders were dispersed in ethanol under sonication, and one drop of the solution was dropped onto a microgrid and washed three times with one drop of ethanol each time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 10°–80°. Raman spectra were obtained using a commercial Renishaw inVia Reflex confocal microscope and a 532 nm laser. The samples were measured without pretreatment under ambient conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with monochromatic Al Kα radiation at ambient temperature, and the C1s line at 284.8 eV was used as the binding energy reference. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was conducted using an Altamira AMI-300 instrument. A weighed amount of the sample (90 mg) was loaded into a U-type quartz tube, which was placed in an electric heating furnace. Samples were pretreated under a stream of He (25 mL min−1) at 100 °C for 1 h and then exposed to a flow of CO2 for 1 h. Next, they were purged by He (25 mL min−1) for 30 min at 25 °C to remove most of the physically adsorbed CO2. Then, the experiment was started by linearly heating the reactor at 5 °C min−1 to 700 °C. This temperature was maintained for 30 min before the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature. Gas chromatography (GC, SHIMADZU 2010 plus) and GC with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Agilent 5975/7890) were employed to monitor the reaction conversion and selectivity."
6,Hydrogenation of nitroarenes,"2.5 Hydrogenation of nitroarenes Typically, a reactant solution at a certain concentration (0.025 or 0.125 M) was prepared using tert-amyl alcohol as a solvent. Next, 10 mL of the solution was transferred into a flasket, and the corresponding amount (42 or 105 mg, respectively) of the catalyst was added. Then the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to ensure that the catalyst adsorbed the reactants to saturation; the solution was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining catalyst was dispersed into 10 mL of a reactant tert-amyl alcohol solution at the same concentration with 20 μL of n-dodecane (C12) as an internal standard. Next, the reactant solution was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave. After sealing, the reactor was evacuated by N2 and H2 three times and once, respectively. The autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature under stirring at 800 rpm, and then hydrogen gas was bubbled into the reactor. The reaction conversion and selectivity were determined by GC (SHIMADZU 2010 plus) and GC-MS (Agilent 5975/7890) analyses. For the kinetic experiment, 200 mg of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm), 5.0 mmol of 4-NP, 40 μL of C12, and 40 mL of tert-amyl alcohol were placed in a stainless-steel autoclave. After sealing, the reactor was evacuated by N2 and H2 three times and once, respectively. The autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature (70, 80, 90, or 100 °C) under stirring at 800 rpm, and then hydrogen gas was bubbled into the reactor. At 20 min intervals, 1.0 mL of the mixture was removed. After centrifugation and filtration, each sample was analyzed by GC. To test the reusability of the N-doped carbon catalyst, m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) were recycled six times in hydrogenation of 4-NP. After each reaction, the m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) were separated by centrifugation and then used again as the catalyst in a new reaction."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Preparation of N-doped carbon materials,"3.1 Preparation of N-doped carbon materials Two fabrication methods are generally considered to dope nitrogen atoms into carbon materials [29]. One is post treatment, such as electrical Joule heating in an ammonia atmosphere, thermal treatment in an ammonia atmosphere or hydrothermal reaction with urea. The other method, which was employed in this work, is direct synthesis. The carbon support (MWCNTs, graphene, or carbon black) and nitrogen precursor (melanin or protoporphyrin IX) were adequately mixed in ethanol solution. After the solvent was removed, the residue was directly carbonized under nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 1 illustrates the preparation process using MWCNTs as the support. Both nitrogen dopants used in this process can be obtained from a wide variety of resources. In particular, melanin is a biological pigment formed by tyrosine or phenolic compounds through oxidation and polymerization [30]. Hence, the raw materials used in this method are inexpensive, abundant, and renewable. During the preparation of N-doped carbon materials, the pyrolysis temperature was confirmed to be crucial [31,32]. To investigate the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the hydrogenation activity, a series of experiments were performed. Melanin was used as the dopant, and MWCNTs with ODs of 10–20 nm were selected as the carbon support. Various NCNTs were prepared under pyrolysis temperatures of 600, 700, 800, or 900 °C, and are denoted as m-NCNTs (10–20 nm)-600, m-NCNTs (10–20 nm)-700, m-NCNTs (10–20 nm)-800, and m-NCNTs (10–20 nm)-900, respectively, as shown in entries 1–4 of Table S1. The pyrolysis time was 2 h for all the samples. Then the obtained catalysts were evaluated for the hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol under 2 MPa of H2 at 120 °C (Table 1 ) to obtain the relationship between the pyrolysis temperature and hydrogenation activity of the catalysts. The reaction catalyzed by pristine MWCNTs showed no conversion (Table 1, entry 1). Further, the catalyst pyrolyzed at 600 °C also did not show any catalytic activity (Table 1, entry 2). A conversion of 23.5% was achieved over the catalyst pyrolyzed at 700 °C (Table 1, entry 3). The catalysts pyrolyzed at 800 and 900 °C displayed significantly increased catalytic activity, showing a 4-NP conversion of nearly 90% (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Therefore, efficient catalysts for hydrogenation should be pyrolyzed at temperatures of ≥800 °C using this method. To reduce energy use, 800 °C was selected as the optimal pyrolysis temperature for preparing active catalysts. All the metal-free catalysts were pyrolyzed at 800 °C in later experiments. As a control experiment, pristine MWCNTs (10–20 nm) were also pyrolyzed directly at 800 °C (Table S1, entry 5) and evaluated (Table 1, entry 6) for hydrogenation. Small amounts of metal impurities in the MWCNTs clearly had no effect, because MWCNTs (10–20 nm)-800 had no catalytic activity. Moreover, the catalytic activity of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm)-800 for hydrogenation was much better than those of two previously reported metal-free catalysts (PV-900 and graphene, Table 1, entries 7 and 8) and was even better than those of previously reported supported metal catalysts (Table 1, entries 9–11) [1,16,26,28,33]. These results show that the N-doped carbon materials synthesized by this method are promising metal-free catalysts for efficient hydrogenation."
9,Hydrogenation performance of various N-doped carbon catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogenation performance of various N-doped carbon catalysts After the optimal pyrolysis temperature was determined, we studied the catalytic activity of different N-doped carbon catalysts. Different nitrogen dopants (melanin and protoporphyrin IX) and supports (MWCNTs with various ODs, graphene, and carbon black) were selected to prepare various N-doped carbon catalysts (Table S1, entries 6–13). The activities of the as-prepared catalysts for hydrogenation are compared in Fig. 2 . The catalytic activity of the NCNTs decreases with an increase in ODs of the MWCNTs regardless of the nitrogen precursor. Further, the conversion increases dramatically when the ODs are reduced from 20–30 nm to 10–20 nm. A possible explanation is that the surface curvature of MWCNTs strongly affects adsorption of the reactant, dissociation of hydrogen, or desorption of the product. Further studies of this hypothesis are currently underway. Graphene and acetylene carbon black were also used as carbon supports (Table S1, entries 14–17). However, both NG and NACB display low activity (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that MWCNTs with ODs of <8 nm and 10–20 nm are suitable supports for the preparation of N-doped carbon catalysts for efficient hydrogenation. For the same carbon support, the catalytic activity of the melanin-doped carbon catalyst is higher than that of the catalyst doped with protoporphyrin IX, except for the MWCNTs with ODs of <8 nm (similar activity was observed on melanin-doped CNTs and protoporphyrin-doped CNTs with ODs of <8 nm). The reason may be that melanin is more likely to bind to the carbon support than protoporphyrin IX during mixing or pyrolysis, ultimately resulting in a higher nitrogen content in the catalyst, which will be verified in a later section."
10,Characterization of the as-synthesized NCNTs,"3.3 Characterization of the as-synthesized NCNTs Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of two active catalysts, m-NCNTs (<8 nm) and m-NCNTs (10–20 nm), and pristine MWCNTs. TEM images of the pristine MWCNTs show the typical CNT morphology (Fig. 3a and d). Straight nanotubes with a hollow channel and smooth inner and outer walls are observed. In contrast, the outer walls of the NCNTs are uneven, with much bending and wrinkling, as presented in Fig. 3b. Magnified TEM images reveal obvious protrusions on the surface of the NCNTs (Fig. 3c, e and f). These are caused by partial destruction of the original intact carbon skeleton of the CNTs by doped nitrogen atoms during carbonization at high temperature. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3f, the NCNTs show a typical bamboo-like structure, which was reported in the literature when nitrogen atoms were doped into the carbon matrix [34–36]. All these features can also be observed in the TEM images of p-NCNTs (<8 nm) and p-NCNTs (10–20 nm) in Fig. S1. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of MWCNTs (10–20 nm) and m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) show that the thickness of the amorphous carbon on the outer wall of the CNTs is significantly larger after doping with nitrogen (Fig. S2), which may be one reason for the high hydrogenation activity. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping reveals that N atoms are uniformly doped into the MWCNTs by the strategy developed in this work (Fig. S3). The structural properties of NCNTs with different ODs were determined by XRD at room temperature. The XRD patterns of all the catalysts (Fig. 4 ) show two distinct peaks at 26.2° and 43.4°, which correspond to the (002) and (004) graphitic planes, respectively [37]. Further, the intensity of the peaks increases as the ODs of the MWCNTs increases. In addition, the peaks of the pristine MWCNTs are much sharper and more intense than those of the corresponding NCNTs, as shown in Fig. 4c. These results indicate that nitrogen doping does not change the crystal type of MWCNTs, but it does significantly decrease their crystallinity. This is consistent with the TEM observations (Fig. 3). Raman spectroscopy was also employed to investigate the effect of incorporation of N atoms into CNTs. As shown in Fig. 4d, two notable characteristic peaks of CNTs at approximately 1345 and 1582 cm−1, the D and G peaks, respectively, are observed. The D peak is caused by disorder and structural defects in the graphite sheets, whereas the G peak indicates the presence of graphitic crystalline structure [38,39]. Therefore, the ratio of the two peaks’ intensities (I D/I G) indicates the defect density in the carbon catalyst [40,41]. Both m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) and p-NCNTs (10–20 nm) clearly have much higher I D/I G values than that of the pristine MWCNTs, indicating that doping with N atoms can effectively create defects in carbon materials. The surface atomic composition and N atom distribution of NCNTs (<8 nm) and NCNTs (10–20 nm) were investigated by XPS and are shown in Figs. 5 and S4 and Table 2 . The N1s spectrum of the NCNTs (Fig. 5 ) exhibits four peaks with binding energies of 398.5, 400.1, 401.1, and 403.2 eV, which correspond to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidic N, respectively [31,42–46]. The graphitic N content is the highest in all four catalysts, with a value of close to 50%. Pyridinic N is the second most abundant component, whereas the pyrrolic N and oxidic N contents are very low in all the catalysts. As shown in Table 2, oxidic N is absent from p-NCNTs (<8 nm), and pyrrolic N is absent from p-NCNTs (10–20 nm). Notably, the percentage of nitrogen atoms in m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) is much higher than that in p-NCNTs (10–20 nm) (5.6% and 1.9%, respectively; Table 2). This finding explains why the catalytic activity of m-NCNTs is higher than that of p-NCNTs (100% and 73.2%, respectively; Fig. 2). It has been proposed that C atoms adjacent to N atoms serve as active sites in N-doped carbon catalysts in the reduction of 4-NP by sodium borohydride [21,41]. The situation is still not clear for NCNTs in the hydrogenation reaction by H2. Moreover, there is no agreement regarding which type of doped N species plays the major role. Oxidic N is generally not considered to contribute to the catalytic activity. Further, in this work, so little doped pyrrolic N is present in the catalysts (Fig. 5) that it cannot contribute to active hydrogenation. Thus, we focus on pyridinic N and graphitic N to reveal the active sites for hydrogenation by N-doped CNTs. It has been demonstrated that carbon atoms next to pyridinic N can serve as Lewis basic sites [18,31], which is the specific function of pyridinic N. Therefore, CO2 TPD was conducted to characterize the Lewis basic sites on the NCNTs obtained in this work (Fig. S5). Carbon dioxide adsorption experiments can be used to determine the pyridinic N content by counting the Lewis basic sites. Considering the results in Fig. 2, we can conclude that the catalytic activity of various NCNTs is not correlated with the area of the CO2 absorption peak. Therefore, it is assumed that pyridinic N does not affect the hydrogenation activity. To verify this assumption, we performed two comparative experiments, in which 4-NP was hydrogenated in the presence of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) with or without the addition of 1 mL of acetic acid (Table S2). If Lewis basic sites dominate the reaction, the catalytic activity should be decreased significantly by neutralization of the basic sites after acetic acid is added [33]. As shown in Table S2, the addition of 1 mL of acetic acid does not change the conversion of 4-NP. These results confirm that pyridinic N is not the active center in hydrogenation. It has been demonstrated that doping with graphitic N could lead to charge redistribution of the surrounding carbon atoms. Furthermore, the carbon atoms adjacent to graphitic N possess a metal-like d-band electronic structure, leading to metal-like catalytic performance [20,47]. It is quite possible that the unique properties of graphitic N endow the NCNTs in this work with their excellent catalytic activity for hydrogenation. To verify this hypothesis, three new samples of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) were prepared at different heating rates (Table S3) and evaluated for the hydrogenation of 4-NP (Table 3 ). Further, the contents of the four nitrogen species were characterized by XPS (Figs. S6–S8 and Table S4). The heating rate was found to change the distribution of the four doped N species. There is an optimal heating rate that supports the formation of more graphitic N. As much as 57% of the total doped N can be transformed to graphitic N in the NCNTs. An excessively slow heating rate (0.5 °C min−1) results in a very long pyrolysis time, which may cause a portion of N to decompose, decreasing the total N content of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. S9, good linear correlation between the catalytic activity and the content of doped graphitic N is observed. In contrast, the pyridinic N content is not related to the hydrogenation activity, which further confirms our conclusion. Hence, it can be determined that graphitic N in the NCNTs plays the predominant role in the hydrogenation reaction."
11,Reaction kinetics of 4-NP hydrogenation over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm),"3.4 Reaction kinetics of 4-NP hydrogenation over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) Kinetic data for catalysis over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) were also collected to investigate the catalytic process and calculate the apparent activation energy (E a). Fig. 6 shows the fitting results of the kinetic data, and Table S5 summarizes the reaction rate constants at different temperatures. The concentration of 4-NP (C 4-NP) clearly has a good linear relationship with the reaction time (t) at temperatures of 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C, indicating a zero-order reaction [26]. The reason may be that the adsorption rate of 4-NP is much greater than the desorption rate, and the real concentration of the reactant is determined by the limited number of active sites on m-NCNTs (10–20 nm), not by the concentration in bulk solution [21]. Finally, E a was calculated using the Arrhenius equation (k = Ae −Ea/RT ), as shown in Fig. 6b. The apparent activation energy of 4-NP hydrogenation over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) is 35.69 kJ mol−1. This value is lower than those of previously reported metal-based catalysts [48–51], as shown in Table S6. This result again demonstrates the outstanding performance of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) in catalytic hydrogenation."
12,Catalytic activity and chemoselectivity of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) for hydrogenation of various nitroaromatics,"3.5 Catalytic activity and chemoselectivity of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) for hydrogenation of various nitroaromatics To explore the general applicability and chemoselectivity of the N-doped carbon catalysts, m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) were used to convert other nitroaromatic compounds. A variety of substituted nitroarenes containing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at different positions were selected as substrates. As shown in Table 4 , m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) show both high activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes containing sensitive groups, such as Cl, CHO, OCH3, CN, and COCH3. The products over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) are the corresponding anilines without dehalogenation or competitive hydrogenation on the substituent groups (Table 4, entries 1, 2, 4, 5, 8–12). However, for I at the para position of the nitro group, deiodination also occurred during preferential hydrogenation of nitro groups into amino groups, leading to formation of o-chloroaniline with a selectivity of 64.3% (Table 4, entry 3). Furthermore, substrates containing heterocyclic rings can also be chemoselectively hydrogenated into the corresponding anilines (Table 4, entries 6 and 7). Note also that the catalyst can reduce nitro groups in the presence of CC bonds with high chemoselectivity (Table 4, entry 14), which is difficult to achieve using metal catalysts [27,52]. Preferential adsorption of the polar nitro group by polar attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions could account for the excellent selectivity of NCNTs for hydrogenation of various substituted nitroarenes [26]. On the basis of these results, we conclude that m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) display excellent catalytic activity and chemoselectivity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes."
13,Recycling experiments of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm),"3.6 Recycling experiments of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) The stability and recyclability of a catalyst are crucial issues in heterogeneous catalysis and large-scale industrial production. To demonstrate the durability of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm), we reused them six times for hydrogenation of 4-NP. The conversion of 4-NP and selectivity of 4-aminophenol remained almost constant at 100% in all runs (Fig. 7 ), which indicates that the activity of m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) was not lost during the reaction. Hence, the high stability of the metal-free catalyst demonstrates that it could be a promising replacement for metal catalysts in selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes."
14,Conclusions,"A facile strategy was developed for the preparation of N-doped carbon materials using melanin or protoporphyrin IX as a nitrogen dopant via a pyrolysis process. The obtained metal-free catalysts were employed to catalyze the hydrogenation of nitroarenes under mild reaction conditions. NCNTs with ODs of ≤20 nm were found to be most active for hydrogenation. The characterization results clearly show that the N dopants can significantly destroy the originally intact carbon skeleton of CNTs, leading to a decrease in the crystallinity. The content of doped graphitic N can be effectively controlled by varying the heating rate during pyrolysis. As much as 57% of the total doped N can be transformed to graphitic N in the NCNTs. Good correlation between the catalytic activity and graphitic N content of the catalyst was observed. The activity of the NCNTs for hydrogenation was dominated mainly by doped graphitic N. Moreover, hydrogenation of 4-NP over m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) was zero order with an apparent activation energy of 35.69 kJ mol−1. The m-NCNTs (10–20 nm) developed in this work exhibited outstanding activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of 14 types of nitroarenes. These NCNTs and their mechanism for catalytic hydrogenation will promote further research in the applications of metal-free catalysts in hydrogenation."
