0,Introduction,"Globally, the problems of environmental pollution are increasing at an alarming rate due to the usage of fossil fuels as an energy source. At this point of time there is an immediate requirement for an alternate energy source which can replace the fossil fuels and reduce the pollution load. Hydrogen (H2) is considered to be an ideal clean energy source, producing water as its only by-product when it burns [1]. Producing H2 (bioH2) via fermentative route is more environmental friendly and less energy intensive, thereby being competitive to conventional H2-producing methods (e.g., thermo-chemical means) [2,3]. BioH2 can be produced by dark fermentation of organic feedstock [4]. Organic matters like glucose, xylose and sucrose, as well as starch and cellulose may be fermented to produce H2 [1,5–7]. In addition to H2 production, dark fermentation also produces a significant amount of alcohols (such as ethanol) [8]. Although formation of alcohols that would consume free electrons from NADH is usually unfavorable for H2 production, it might be feasible to allow a balanced production of both gaseous and liquid biofuels (i.e., H2 and ethanol) through proper operation of dark fermentation processes toward an optimal total energy gain [8,9]. At present the biomass from crops like sweet sorghum, potatoes, cassava, corn and palm oil are used as raw materials for bioethanol and/or biohydrogen production [8,10–14]. Very few studies have been carried out on H2 production from sweet potato. Asia is a potential producer of bioethanol from crop residues and wasted crops, and its bioethanol production reached 291GL/y. The industrial processes for bioethanol production mainly use grain, tuber and root starches [15]. Sweet potato can be considered as a suitable substrate for the production of biohydrogen and bioethanol because it is a starch-rich (sugar content is more than 35%), cold-resistant, fast-growing crop and could grow on a poor soil. In order to balance the prices of crops, about 220,000 hectares of farm land is being set aside annually in Taiwan [16]. If these set aside farm land is used to grow sweet potato, it will not only help in the usage of the natural resource but also to produce bioenergy. Based on the above observation, the present study was aimed to optimize the operating conditions for biohydrogen and bioethanol production from sweet potato using Response-Surface Methodology (RSM). RSM is a collection of statistical techniques for designing experiments, building models, evaluating the effects of factors and searching for the optimum conditions, and has been successfully used in the optimization of bioprocesses [17]. The individual and interactive effects of initial cultivation pH and sweet potato concentration on biohydrogen production were investigated by heat-treated seed sludge inoculums."
1,Material and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate Anaerobic sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and cow dung collected from central Taiwan were used as seed inoculum. The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the sewage sludge were 7.5, 35.2g/L and 65.1g/L and for cow dung were 8.0, 40.0g/L and 78.8g/L, respectively. The collected seed sludges were heat-treated (100°C for 45min) to inhibit the methanogenic activity and to select H2-producing spore-forming bacteria [18]. The tested sweet potato procured from a local market had moisture content of 70%. The sweet potato was washed by tap water and sliced to particle size of about 5cm, then mixed with deionized water and stirred to make the substrate concentration in the range of 50–250g/L. The total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and sugar concentration of the sweet potato solution (150g/L) were 52gCOD/L and 55g/L, respectively."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in serum bottles (volume of 125mL) with anaerobic head space. Argon gas was purged into the serum vial after adding 10mL of sludge-inoculum, 40mL of sweet potato solution, 5mL of pH adjusting solution (1N HCl or 1N NaOH) and 5mL nutrient medium containing sufficient inorganic supplements in the following composition (g/L): NH4HCO3 5.24, K2HPO4 0.125, MgCl2·6H2O 0.1, MnSO4·6H2O 0.015, FeSO4·7H2O 0.025, CuSO4·5H2O 0.005, CoCl2·5H2O 0.000125 and NaHCO3 6.72 [19]. The vials were placed in a reciprocal air-bath shaker (150rpm) with a cultivation temperature of 35±1°C. The tested pH values were 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, and substrate concentrations from 50 to 250g/L. The volume and composition of biogas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), carbohydrate and COD concentrations were determined after 52h cultivation. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. A full-factorial central-composite experimental design [20] was employed in planning the batch assays to optimize the initial cultivation pH and substrate concentration for efficient H2 production (Table 1 )."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The analytical procedures of Standard Methods [21] were used to determine pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), and total COD (TCOD). Biomass taken from the batch enrichment assays at the initial cultivation was also analyzed as volatile suspended solids (VSS) according to the Standard Methods [21]. Ethanol and VFA concentrations were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas tight syringe at room temperature (20°C) and pressure (1.01325bar). The composition of biogas in the batch enrichment assays was measured with a CHINA Chromatography 8700T gas chromatograph equipped with a packed (packing, Porapak Q), stainless steel column, and a thermal conductivity detector. Oven, injector and detector temperatures were 55, 90 and 90°C, respectively, and argon as the carrier gas. The concentrations of organic acids and alcohols were measured using a Shimadzu GC-14A GC equipped with a glass column (packing, FON) and a flame ionization detector. Oven, injector and detector temperatures were 145, 175 and 175°C, respectively, and N2 as the carrier gas. Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to measure the hexose concentration [22]."
5,Data analysis,"2.4 Data analysis RSM was used to point out the relationship between the response functions and variables. The optimization of H2 production can be analyzed by means of the relationship existing between the response functions and process variables. In this study, the H2 production potential (P, mL), maximum H2 production rate (Rm , mL/h) and lag phase time (λ, h) obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [23] were used as the response variables. STATISTIC Software (version 6.0, Statsoft Inc., USA) and Sigmaplot Software (trial version 9.0, Systat Software Inc., USA) were used for regression and graphical analyses of the data obtained, respectively. (1) H ( t ) = P · exp - exp R m · e P ( λ - t ) + 1 H(t) is the cumulative H2 production (mL); P is the H2 production potential (mL); Rm is the maximum H2 production rate (HPR) (mL/h); e is 2.71828; λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the cultivation time (h)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen generation,"3.1 Hydrogen generation The H2 generation values obtained with the various experimental conditions are given in Table 2 . The H2 production and content depended on the initial cultivation pH, sweet potato concentration and seed inoculum. The H2 quantity varied from 0 to 280.6mL with final ORPs from −19 to −456mV. The H2 content in the biogas ranged from 5.4% to 47.5% and methane was below the detectable limit. The peak H2 content of 43.0–47.5% was obtained from 150g/L sweet potato at pH 6.5–6.6 using sewage sludge seed. The cow dung seed also resulted in the maximum H2 content of 35% at the same pH condition. The H2 content was lower at both high (8.5–8.6) and low (4.4–4.5) pH conditions with the sewage sludge and cow dung seeds when compared with others. The H2 production decreased with the increase in pH which is in agreement with the works carried out with other substrates [24,25]. Table 3 summarizes the modified Gompertz equation parameter values and calculated maximum H2 production rates (HPRm), specific H2 production rates (SHPRm) and H2 production yields (HYm). The peak HPRm of 189.8mmol/L/d and SHPRm of 38.6mmol/gVSS/d were obtained from sweet potato with a concentration of 150g/L using cow dung seed at an initial cultivation pH of 6.5. Sewage sludge seed resulted in peak HPRm (160mmol/L/d) and SHPRm (33.7mmol/gVSS/d) at pH 8.5; these values were 15% lower than those of the cow dung seed. This may be due to the availability of the suitable microorganisms in the cow dung which were capable of degrading the sweet potato-starch component. Moreover, the optimal initial cultivation pH of 6.5 vs. 8.5 indicates that the sweet potato-starch degrading bacteria in these two seeds were different in growth pH. The main operating factors affecting fermentative H2 production include inoculums, substrate, reactor type, nitrogen, phosphate, metals, temperature and pH [26]. According to the response surface analysis, the optimal initial cultivation pH value for H2 production potential from sweet potato concentration of 150g/L using the sewage sludge and cow dung seeds were 7.0 and 6.5, respectively (Fig. 1 a). However, the optimal Rm (higher than 8mL/h) was obtained at higher pH (>8.0) with a sweet potato concentration of 175g/L using sewage sludge seed. With cow dung seed Rm was observed at pH 6.5 from 150g/L concentration of sweet potato (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c indicates that long lag phase time was necessary at low substrate concentration and high pH. It has been reported earlier that H2 potential, maximum H2 production rate and the duration of the lag phase are all pH-dependent [27]. The H2 content varied with sweet potato concentration. High concentration (250g/L) resulted in low H2 content which might be due to low final pH caused by volatile fatty acid accumulation. A previous study also showed that H2 yield increased from 1.8 to 2.6molH2/molglucose when glucose concentration decreased from 10 to 2.5gCOD/L [28]. The total carbohydrate degradations were in the range of 5–89% with minimum and maximum values being obtained at the sweet potato concentrations of 100g/L and 250g/L, respectively."
8,Productions of ethanol and volatile fatty acids,"3.2 Productions of ethanol and volatile fatty acids The main soluble metabolic products (SMP) in a dark fermentation process are ethanol, acetate, butyrate and propionate. Table 4 shows the main SMP from sweet potato with sewage sludge and cow dung seeds which were ethanol, acetate and butyrate in the range of 10–70, 3–38 and 4–46% of SMP, respectively. The maximum SMP concentration of 34.6gCOD/L including ethanol (24%), acetate (23%), propionate (2%) and butyrate (51%) was obtained at pH 7.5 from 200g/L of sweet potato with the cow dung seed. The peak ethanol concentration was obtained from 150g/L of sweet potato at initial cultivation pH 8.5 by the cow dung seed (Run 18). The H2 production values were less when maximum SMP or ethanol concentrations were observed. High SMP or ethanol concentration leads to decreased intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio which results in a poor H2 production. The VFA and ethanol concentration distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring H2 production. However, the environmental factors such as pH and substrate concentration could affect the metabolic pathways [26]. Increasing the substrate loading is also found to increase the relative production of VFA and decrease the pH, which can shift the reaction in the reactor to solvent production, as seen in case of acetone-butanol fermentation [28]. To investigate the relationships between the productions of H2, ethanol, acetate, butyrate and soluble metabolic product, contour lines against pH and substrate concentrations were plotted using the response surface analysis (Fig. 2 ). High ethanol concentration (ca. 8gCOD/L) was obtained at high sweet potato concentration and low pH by sewage sludge seed. However, higher ethanol concentration of about 20gCOD/L was obtained at low pH and sweet potato concentration by cow dung seed (Fig. 2a). Propionate concentration was higher at high and low sweet potato concentrations with sewage sludge and cow dung seeds, respectively, at high pH values (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, the acetate and butyrate concentrations had similar trends during substrate and pH effect experiments using the two seeds. The higher acetate and butyrate concentrations were obtained at pH 6.5–8.0 but from high substrate concentration (ca. 250g/L) by sewage sludge seed and substrate concentration of 100–160g/L by cow dung seed, respectively (Fig. 2b and d). High SMP concentration was about 16gCOD/L at high substrate concentration and pH by sewage sludge seed but higher SMP concentration of 25gCOD/L was at pH 7.0–8.0 and substrate concentration of 100–140g/L. Similar observation has been reported that an ethanol concentration of 31g/L was obtained in the fermentation of potato hydrolyzate prepared under the optimal hydrolysis conditions by commercial bakery yeast at 28°C [15]. Higher ethanol concentrations were observed when final pH values were less than 4.0. In the case of initial pH 4.5, the ratio of ethanol concentration to SMP was 69.5%. Similar result of microbial shift from H2 and acids production to solventogenesis has been reported at a pH level below 4.1 [29]."
9,Energy efficiency analysis,"3.3 Energy efficiency analysis It is very useful to know the energy efficiency of a material which is being used as a substrate to understand the potential for commercial scale purpose. The details of the energy efficiency values at various experimental conditions with pretreated seed cultures are given in Table 5 . The peak total energy production yield of 389.7J/gsubstrate was obtained from a sweet potato concentration of 150g/L at pH 6.5 with cow dung seed. The response surface analysis shows that the higher total energy production (>300J/gCODsweet potato) was obtained at an initial cultivation pH of 7.0 and sweet potato concentration of 120g/L using the sewage sludge seed (Fig. 3 a). However, the optimal initial cultivation pH of 7.25 and sweet potato concentration of 100g/L for total energy production (>300J/gsweet potato) using the cow dung seed was obtained (Fig. 3b). In 2008 the sweet potato production was 25 tons per hectare in Taiwan. It means the bioenergy production yield from sweet potato is 9.7 GJ per hectare annum. This value is small when compared with the bioethanol and biomethane production yield from other crops (16.3–217.3GJ/ha annum [30]). However, the effluent of biohydrogen and bioethanol production from sweet potato could be used to produce methane and this could increase the total bioenergy production yield of sweet potato."
10,Significance of the experimental results,"3.4 Significance of the experimental results From the experimental results it is known that cow dung is a better seed source than sewage sludge for fermentative H2 and ethanol production from sweet potato. Both H2 and ethanol are good gaseous and liquid bioenergy resources, respectively, although their utilization is different. Notably, the experiment results showed that H2 and ethanol production depends on the cultivation pH and the seed source. The results indicate the need for proper selection of seed and operation conditions for selective production of the gaseous or liquid bioenergy from sweet potato. Moreover, sweet potato can be directly used as a feedstock for H2 and ethanol production without the need to extract the starch before fermentation. Starch production from sweet potato is energy- and time-consuming. The potential of direct fermentation makes bioenergy production from sweet potato attractive. Table 6 shows that sweet potato gives higher HPR than sweet sorghum. This indicates that there is another potential for using the sweet potato to produce H2. The energy efficiency analysis also gives the information regarding the potential of sweet potato. If the 220,000hectares of the set aside farm land in Taiwan is used to grow sweet potato, 5.5×106 tones of sweet potato can be produced (25 tones/ha, the 2008 statistics from Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan). It means 2144 GJ of energy can be produced from sweet potato (assuming that the energy production yield from sweet potato is 389.8J/g, Run 16, Table 5)."
11,Conclusions,"Initial cultivation pH and sweet potato concentration have an individual significant influence on HPRm and SHPRm. Peak HPRm of 189.8mmol/L/d and SHPRm of 38.6mmol/gVSS/d were obtained from sweet potato at 150g/L using cow dung seed at an initial cultivation pH of 6.5. The main soluble metabolites production from sweet potato fermentation by sewage sludge and cow dung seeds were ethanol, acetate and butyrate and represented 10–70%, 3–38% and 4–46% of SMP. The peak ethanol concentration obtained from sweet potato 150g/L at initial cultivation pH 8.5 was 12.2gCOD/L by cow dung seed. From the response surface analysis, the optimal sweet potato concentration and initial cultivation pH for Rm were 110–190g/L and 6.0–7.7, respectively, by sewage sludge seed. Nonetheless, the highest Rm could be obtained at sweet potato concentration 120–180g/L and pH 6.2–7.6 by cow dung seed. The acetate and butyrate concentrations were similar in the substrate concentration and pH experiments with sewage sludge and cow dung seeds. Higher acetate and butyrate concentrations were obtained at pH 6.5–8.0 and at high substrate concentration of ca. 250g/L with sewage sludge seed and ca. 100–160g/L with cow dung seed, respectively."
