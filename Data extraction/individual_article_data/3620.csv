0,Introduction,"In recent years, the fluctuating crude oil price and the growing world population have created the energy security and environmental emission issues, thereby leading to the growing interest in renewable and environmental-friendly bioenergy. Owing to its advantages of carbon neutrality and abundant availability, biomass has been broadly considered as one of the most promising substitutes for traditional fossil fuels for the production of energy and chemicals [1,2]. However, some conventional technologies such as pyrolysis, gasification and combustion are not economically viable for high water-containing biomass feedstocks since an energy-intensive drying pre-treatment is normally required for these technologies. In contrast, water can be applied as an effective reaction medium in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion of biomass, producing biocrude oil with an HHV of 25–35 MJ/kg, which can be used as a feedstock for producing bio-fuels after upgrading or value-added bio-based chemicals [3–6]. In addition, when compared with fast pyrolysis, HTL process generally has higher energetic efficiency and produces oil products with more desirable quantities [7]. In the last decade, extensive research has been reported dealing with reaction mechanisms and the effects of varying reaction variables on biomass liquefaction [8–10]. Nevertheless, there are still several challenges relating to biomass HTL, e.g., low biocrude oil yield and quality, harsh reaction conditions (in terms of pressure) and the difficulties in recovering and using aqueous phase by-products [11,12]. To address the challenge as mentioned above, organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and acetone, have been adopted as the reaction medium in the direct liquefaction of biomass [13,14]. The beneficial effects of using organic solvents can be summarized as follows: (i) better dissolution and stabilization of weak polar or non-polar reaction intermediates in the process; (ii) moderate operating conditions; and (iii) biocrude oil products with improved energy density of and meanwhile reduced acidity [15]. However, biomass liquefaction in pure organic solvents exhibits limitations, as hydrolysis is the first step in the biomass conversion [16]. Instead, the mixed reaction mediums consisting of organic solvents and water have gained popularity for biomass liquefaction, among which ethanol–water mixed solvents were extensively utilized owing to the advantages of low cost, low toxicity and renewability [14,17]. For example, Pan et al. [18] liquefied camphor tree sawdust in ethanol–water mixed solvents at 280 °C for 30 min, a very high yield of biocrude oil (61.5 wt%) and conversion (98.4 wt%) were obtained when compared with those obtained from liquefaction in pure water or ethanol, implying a synergistic interaction between ethanol and water during the liquefaction process. In another study, Feng et al. [19] examined the roles of water and ethanol in the mixed solvents during lignocellulose biomass liquefaction, where the results showed that subcritical water could promote hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, while ethanol could dissolve the lignin-derived intermediates and prevent their re-polymerization or condensation reactions to form high molecular-weight solids (i.e., char). Zero-valent metals such as zinc (Zn), aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) were recently employed in biomass liquefaction process to enhance biocrude oil yield and quality, where the promotion effects were attributed to the depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation reactions facilitated by the in-situ hydrogen generated through metal hydrolysis [20–22]. Yang et al. [21] proposed a novel deoxy-liquefaction method for cornstalk employing subcritical water and metallic Al at 370 °C, achieving 26.54 wt% yield and 47.92% deoxidation of bio-oil. In addition to water, Al was also found to react with supercritical ethanol to produce in-situ hydrogen and promote biomass liquefaction at 300 °C [23]. Besides, as an earth-abundant and low-cost metal, Fe powder demonstrated similar positive effects in HTL of oak wood, i.e., improving the yield and quality of biocrude oil, again attributed to the supply of in-situ hydrogen and the generated Fe3O4 could act as a catalyst in biomass liquefaction [24]. As an interesting feature, Fe and Fe3O4 could be easily recovered by magnetic operation. Moreover, in the studies by Miyata et al., hydrothermal liquefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunch was performed with Fe as the hydrogen donor, and the oxidized Fe could be regenerated by reduction with the bio-char byproducts derived from the HTL process [20,25,26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, by far Fe addition were only tested in biomass HTL in sub-critical water, and no study has investigated the interaction between ethanol–water mixed solvents and Fe in biomass HTL. To address this knowledge gap, in this study, cornstalk was liquefied in water, ethanol and ethanol/water mixed solvents with or without Fe powder under various reaction conditions. In addition, this work aimed to elucidate the role of Fe in the liquefaction process by comparing the performance of Fe, Fe3O4 and Fe/Fe3O4 mixture in the process. The physiochemical properties of the biocrude oil products were also comprehensively characterized by elemental analysis, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The evolution of metallic Fe during the liquefaction process was probed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cornstalk (CS) used in this article was provided by Ontario Federation of Agriculture collected from South Ontario, with pre-drying at 105 °C in an oven for 24 h and then grounded into particles of 40 mesh. ACS reagent-grade acetone and ethanol were purchased from Caledon Laboratory Chemicals (Georgetown, Canada). In addition, Fe (purity ≥ 99%) and Fe3O4 (purity > 97%, nano powder) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The proximate and elemental analyses of the CS feedstock are summarized in Table 1 ."
3,Biomass liquefaction experiments,"2.2 Biomass liquefaction experiments All biomass liquefaction experiments were performed in a 100 mL stainless autoclave reactor with a magnetic stirrer (Parr 4590 Micro Bench-top reactor, Illinois, USA). In a typical run, 4.0 g of the dried cornstalk (CS), 40 mL of solvent (pure water, pure ethanol, or ethanol–water mixed solvents) were loaded into the reactor. For the experimental runs with Fe-based additives, a certain amount of Fe, Fe3O4 or their mixture were loaded into the reactor with cornstalk. The reactor was then tightly sealed and the residual air inside the reactor was removed through N2 flushing and vacuuming for at least five times. After pressurizing with 2 MPa nitrogen as the initial pressure, the reactor was heated up to the desired temperature under constant stirring (~200 rpm) and maintained at this temperature for a specified residence time. Then, the reactor was quickly quenched in a cold water bath to ambient temperature (25 °C) within 10 min. The temperature and pressure curves during hydrothermal liquefaction of cornstalk without additives at typical conditions (300 °C, 30 min) in pure water, ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) and pure ethanol are shown in Fig. S1. The method adopted for products separation and biocrude oil recovery can be illustrated in Fig. 1 . In brief, after the experiment, the gaseous product in the reactor was directly released into a fume hood through the exhaust valve. In this work, gaseous products were not collected and analyzed as our previous tests demonstrated that the yield of gaseous product mainly CO2 was negligible, being <1–3%. Afterward, the reactor was slowly opened and the solid/liquid products were transferred into a 500 mL beaker. The reactor and stirrer were then carefully rinsed by acetone and the resulting washing was combined with the reaction mixture, followed by vacuum filtration over a pre-weighted VWR No. 413 filter paper to separate the solid residue (SR) from the liquid products. SR was then rinsed with acetone until the filtrate became colorless, and the solid recovered on the filter paper was oven-dried at 105 °C for 12 h. The Fe-based additives remained in the SR were carefully recovered using magnet before calculating the SR yield. In the next step, the filtrate containing biocrude oil was transferred into a 500 mL pre-weighed round-bottom flask and evaporated under reduced pressure at 50 °C using a rotary evaporator to remove acetone and ethanol. After this, biocrude oil was precipitated and attached to the inner wall of the evaporation flask, and the remaining water-phase byproducts was simply dumped. The biocrude oil was air-dried in the fume hood for at least 12 h until constant weight was achieved before calculating the oil yield. The yields of SR, biocrude oil and others as well as the biomass conversion are defined by wt.% of respective product in relation to dry CS loaded in the liquefaction experiment, calculated using the following equations. It should be noted that in this work, the total yield of gaseous product, water phase byproduct as well as pyrolytic water was lumped together into “yield of others”, calculated by difference. (1) Yield o f S R = W SR W CS × 100 % (2) Yield o f b i o c r u d e o i l = W Oil W CS × 100 % (3) Yield o f o t h e r s = 100 % - Y i e l d o f S R - Y i e l d o f b i o c r u d e o i l (4) Biomass c o n v e r s i o n = 100 % - Y i e l d o f S R where WSR is the oven-dried weight of solid residue (g), WCS is the oven-dried weight of cornstalk (g) and WOil the weight of biocrude oil. The biomass conversion refers to the liquefied fractions of cornstalk, which were converted into biocrude oil, water soluble or gaseous products. All the liquefaction experiments were repeated at least three times and the mean values are reported together with error bars, which represent the standard deviation of the results from parallel experiments."
4,Products analyses,"2.3 Products analyses The elemental compositions (CHNS) of the CS feedstock and biocrude oil samples, all on a dry basis, was measured on a Vario EL Cube elemental analyzer (Elementar, Germany), and the oxygen content was calculated by difference (100% - C% - H% - N% - Ash%). The higher heating value (HHV) was determined based on Dulong’s formula [27]: (5) HHV M J / k g = 0.3383 C + 1.442 ( H - O / 8 ) The volatile compositions of biocrude oil products were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) (Agilent 7890B GC, 5977AMSD) equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.64 mL/min. In each run, 1 μL of pre-filtered (pore size 0.45 μm) oil sample was injected at 280 °C and the split ratio was 10:1. The temperature program of GC was as follows: 60 °C (held for 2 min) → 120 °C (10 °C /min) → 280 °C (8 °C/min, held for 5 min). Moreover, the functional groups of the biocrude oil products were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) using a PerkinElmer spectrometer over the wavelength range of 4000–600 cm−1. Furthermore, the crystalline structure of the Fe-based additives recovered from the SR products was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku RINT 2500, Tokyo, Japan) with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (1.5406 Å) at 30 kV and 15 mA."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Liquefaction products distribution,"3.1 Liquefaction products distribution 3.1.1 Effects of solvents and the addition of Fe Effects of water/ethanol ratio (v/v) on products distribution and biomass conversion obtained from liquefaction of cornstalk at 300 °C for 30 min without any additives were presented in Table 2 . As shown in the table, the yield of biocrude oil in pure water (28.28 wt%) was lower than that in pure ethanol (35.34 wt%). Nevertheless, the biomass conversion in pure water (64.97%) was apparently higher than that obtained in pure ethanol (59.45%), which was likely due to the lack of water in pure ethanol medium, limiting the extent of biomass hydrolysis [16]. It is obvious that the yield of biocrude oil and conversion obtained in ethanol–water mixed solvents were all higher than those obtained in either pure water or ethanol, demonstrating apparent synergistic interaction of ethanol and water in the liquefaction process. According to the study by Feng et al. [19], degradation of biomass could be accelerated by hydrolyzing cellulose/hemi-cellulose in hot-compressed water, while ethanol could promote the conversion of lignin by dissolving the de-polymerized products and prevent the repolymerization reactions. Specifically, the yield of biocrude oil increased significantly from 28.28 wt% to 40.91 wt% when the amount of water decreased from 100 vol% to 50 vol% in the reaction medium. However, the yield of biocrude oil decreased slightly with further increasing the ethanol percentage from 50 vol% to 75 vol% in the ethanol–water mixed solvents. As such, the water–ethanol mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) appeared to be the most effective for liquefaction of CS into biocrude oil, as similarly reported in some literature work [18,19]. The effects of Fe addition on products distribution and conversion in pure water, pure ethanol and ethanol–water cosolvents (50/50, v/v) are also comparatively shown in Table 2. All the experiments were conducted at 300 °C for 30 min, while 10 wt% of the cornstalk of Fe was added. In pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents, the yield of biocrude oil was significantly enhanced by the Fe addition, from 28.28 wt% to 43.18 wt%, and from 40.91 wt% to 50.46 wt% respectively, resulting in a much lower SR yield. The biomass conversion in the ethanol–water (50/50, v/v) mixed solvents in the presence of Fe attained as high as 95.29 wt%, indicating the promoting effect of the Fe addition on the liquefaction of CS in both water and ethanol–water mixed solvents. Such promotion effect could be possibly attributed to the dual roles of Fe in the biomass HTL process: (i) the reaction between Fe and water generates in-situ hydrogen, which would stabilize the unstable reaction intermediates and suppress their repolymerization reactions, hence increasing oil yield and inhibiting the formation of char; and (ii) Fe would be converted into Fe3O4 which might act as a catalyst for cellulose and lignin degradation [20,28]. The catalytic effect of Fe3O4 was investigated and the results are presented and discussed in Section 3.1.4. In contrast, in the CS liquefaction in pure ethanol, the effects of Fe on biomass conversion or biocrude oil yield were negligible, as clearly shown in Table 2, which might be due to the difficulty for Fe to react with pure ethanol (thus no in-situ hydrogen was generated) at such mild temperature (300 °C). The reactions between Fe and different solvents were further confirmed by XRD analysis to be discussed in the subsequent section. 3.1.2 Effects of the dosage of Fe Effects of the Fe dosage (5 wt%-25 wt%) on products distribution and biomass conversion were investigated at 300 °C for 30 min in ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) and the results are displayed in Fig. 2 . As expected, a higher yield of biocrude oil was achieved in the presence of Fe, and the yield increased from 46.24 wt% to 50.46 wt% when increasing the Fe dosage from 5 wt% to 10 wt%. However, the increase of the biocrude oil yield and biomass conversion reached a plateau at a Fe loading above 10 wt%, suggesting that 10 wt% of Fe loading to be optimum taking into account of both oil yield and economics, as also observed by Caprariis et al. [24] in HTL of oak wood biomass in pure water, where the optimum dosage of Fe additive was found to be 10 wt%. 3.1.3 Effects of reaction temperature and time As discussed above, Fe was confirmed to be efficient in promoting the yield of biocrude oil in ethanol–water mixed solvents at 300 °C for 30 min. It is necessary to determine the effects of other liquefaction conditions, in particular reaction temperature and time on products distribution and biomass conversion in the mixed solvents with Fe addition. Accordingly, liquefaction tests were performed in ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) with/without Fe addition (10 wt%) at various temperature (260–340 °C) with fixed time of 30 min (Fig. 3 a) or for different lengths of reaction time (15–75 min) at fixed temperature of 300 °C (Fig. 3b). In the tests without or with Fe addition, the yield of biocrude oil increased with the temperature until 300 °C when the oil yield peaked at 40.91% (without Fe addition) or 50.46 wt% (with Fe addition). At all temperatures particularly at above 260 °C, the biocrude oil yield from the tests with Fe were higher than that without Fe, suggesting apparent promoting effect of metallic Fe in the biocrude oil yield. This result could be attributed to the higher reactivity of Fe with water at high temperatures [24]. Whereas, the biocrude oil yield in the tests without or with Fe decreased when the temperature was above 300 °C, e.g., it dropped from 40.91 wt% at 300 °C to 34.91 wt% at 340 °C (without Fe), as similarly observed by Hu et al. and Lai et al. in biomass HTL using ethanol–water mixed solvents [3,27]. The reduced oil yield at higher temperatures could be attributed to the thermal cracking of the biocrude oil into water soluble or gaseous products [29], which is supported by the increase in the yield of others fraction (as illustrated in both in Fig. 3a). Fig. 3a also clearly shows that the yield of SR in the tests without or with Fe addition continuously reduced while increasing the temperature from 260 °C to 340 °C, and the SR yield was markedly lower in the tests with Fe at all temperatures, indicating that the hydrolysis and thermal decomposition of biomass macromolecule were favored at higher temperatures [30] and by the Fe addition. The effects of reaction time were studied at 300 °C for 15–75 min in ethanol–water (50/50, v/v) mixed solvents with or without Fe addition (10 wt% loading), and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3b. For the experiments without Fe addition, the yield of biocrude oil peaked at 30 min (40.91 wt%) and started to decrease with increasing the reaction time. Similar effects of reaction time on biomass liquefaction were observed previously by Xu et al. and Zhu et al [31,32]. It is believed that the reduction of the biocrude oil yield for extended residence time might be attributed to: (i) the cracking of oil components to form gaseous and/or water soluble compounds, and (ii) the repolymerization of biocrude oil to form solid char, which was evidenced by the slight increasing of SR and others when elongating the reaction from 30 min to 75 min. The loading of Fe promoted the production of biocrude oil in all tests, accompanied with a decreased SR yield. The oil yield firstly increased with reaction time until 30 min but then remained stable from 30 to 60 min. The promotion effects of Fe in the biomass liquefaction process were likely attributed to the suppression of repolymerization reactions of the reaction intermediates by the in-situ hydrogen produced by Fe-water reaction [20,25]. Hence, the biocrude oil generated with Fe was more stable with prolonging the reaction time. As such, a residence time of 30 min appeared to be the optimum time for liquefaction of CS in ethanol–water mixed solvents if considering both the biocrude oil yield and the economics. 3.1.4 Effects of different Fe-based additives As described in previous studies, the promotion effect of Fe on biocrude oil production in biomass liquefaction could be attributed to the in-situ hydrogen generated by Fe-water reaction and the catalytic effect from oxidized Fe (mainly Fe3O4) [20]. In order to better understand the role of Fe in the HTL of cornstalk in ethanol–water mixed solvents, the effects of the different Fe-base additives including Fe, Fe3O4 and Fe/Fe3O4 mixture were examined in this study. The liquefaction experiments were conducted at 300 °C for 30 min in both pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v). In each run, Fe, Fe3O4 or the mixture of Fe/Fe3O4 was added at an amount of 0.4 g Fe (10 wt% of cornstalk), 0.55 g Fe3O4 (containing 0.4 g of Fe) or 0.2 g Fe/0.275 g Fe3O4 (containing a total of 0.4 g of Fe). As clearly illustrated in Fig. 4 a, the yield of biocrude oil obtained in pure water follows the order of Fe (43.18 wt%) > Fe/Fe3O4 (42.76 wt%) > Fe3O4 (33.29 wt%) > None (28.28 wt%). As expected, Fe has a significant promotion effect on biocrude oil production due to its ability to generate in-situ hydrogen that stabilize the reaction intermediates, while Fe3O4 was reported in the literature to exhibit catalytic activity for the production of biocrude oil from HTL of biomass [24,25,33]. However, the biocrude oil yield obtained from Fe/Fe3O4 was almost the same with that from Fe, indicating that the effect of metallic Fe on increasing the biocrude oil yield was dominant in the biomass liquefaction process. The products distribution from the liquefaction in the ethanol–water mixed solvents without and with various Fe-based additives is displayed in Fig. 4 b, from which the yield of biocrude oil follows the order of Fe (50.46 wt%) > Fe/Fe3O4 (47.02 wt%) > None (40.91 wt%) ≅ Fe3O4 (39.54 wt%). This suggests that the catalytic effect of Fe3O4 was negligible in the ethanol–water mixed solvents, which further proves that the in-situ hydrogen generated by metallic Fe and water should be the main mechanism in enhancing biocrude oil production in HTL of biomass in either pure water or ethanol–water mixed solvents. The utilization of ethanol in the liquefaction solvent significantly increased the biocrude oil yields when compared with those obtained in pure water under the same conditions, and the metallic Fe was effective on further promoting the production of biocrude oil in the mixed solvents. Notably, in ethanol–water mixed solvents with metallic Fe addition, the yield of biocrude oil increased drastically to 50.46 wt% from 28.28 wt% (in pure water without Fe), which was also much higher than that in the ethanol–water mixed solvents without Fe (40.91 wt%) or in pure water with Fe (43.18 wt%), suggesting a synergistic effect between Fe and ethanol–water mixed solvents in HTL of biomass in biocrude oil production."
7,Characterizations of liquefaction products,"3.2 Characterizations of liquefaction products As mentioned in the previous sections, the metallic Fe proved effective for production of biocrude oil by HTL of cornstalk in both pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents. Therefore, representative biocrude oil samples collected from the tests in water and mixed solvents were analyzed to further elucidate the roles of metallic Fe in the liquefaction process. 3.2.1 Elemental analysis of biocrude oils The elemental analysis results of the biocrude oils produced in water or ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) at 300 °C for 30 min, with or without Fe-based additives are summarized in Table 3 . As expected, with a much higher carbon content and lower oxygen content, biocrude oils have a much higher HHV (26.22–30.86 MJ/kg) than the feedstock - cornstalk (16.53 MJ/kg). In pure water reaction medium, the metallic Fe not only promoted the oil yield, but also increased the carbon content and the H/C ratio of the oil, accompanied with a greatly reduced O/H ratio, resulting in an increased HHV (29.54 MJ/kg). In ethanol–water mixed solvents without any additive, the carbon and hydrogen contents of the biocrude oil were comparable with those from pure water with Fe loading. Liquefaction in the mixed solvents with Fe additive produced a bio-crude oil with the highest carbon (70.63 wt%) and hydrogen (7.49 wt%) contents as well as the lowest oxygen content (21.24 wt%), and hence the highest HHV of 30.86 MJ/kg. Employing Fe3O4 in the liquefaction in pure water also led to slightly improved HHV of the oil product (26.51 MJ/kg), whereas using Fe3O4 in the mixed solvents only had a minimal effect on the oil’s compositions and HHV. The Van Krevelen diagram of the biomass feedstock and the biocrude oil products is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The O/C and H/C atomic ratios can be used to evaluate the deoxidation and hydrogenation degree of the biocrude oils. [21] Employing metallic Fe in pure water or the mixed solvents significantly increased the biocrude oil’s H/C ratio and reduced the O/C, owing to the in-situ hydrogen generated by the Fe-water reaction, which promoted the hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of the reaction intermediates. Besides, biocrude oils obtained in ethanol–water mixed solvents have obviously higher H/C ratio and lower O/C ratio than those obtained in pure water. Ethanol can be an efficient hydrogen donor solvent and has the ability to promote deoxygenation reactions (i.e. decarbonylation, and decarboxylation, etc.) of the reaction intermediates, hence leading to a higher HHV of the oil products [15,27]. 3.2.2 GC–MS analysis of biocrude oils The volatile compositions of the biocrude oils produced in pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) at 300 °C for 30 min, with or without Fe-based additives were qualitatively analyzed by GC–MS, and the detailed compounds are listed in Table S1 (pure water) and Table S2 (ethanol–water mixed solvents). It should be noted that only the compounds which are volatile at the temperature of the column (approx. 20–30 wt% of the biocrude oil) could be detected by the MS detector, and some light compounds in the biocrude oil might be lost during the oil recovery process by evaporation [33,34]. As shown in Table S1 and S2, the main components in all biocrude oils can be approximately divided into the following categories: phenolics, esters, acids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, nitrogenous compounds, ketones, ethers and aldehydes. Although some compounds contain multiple functional groups, for simplicity, each compound in the biocrude oils was assigned to only one category. The relative contents, which refer to the peak area percentage of all categories, are displayed in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6a, liquefaction in pure water medium without Fe addition, the most abundant compounds in the biocrude oil are phenolic compounds (32.62%), followed by alcohols (21.67%), acids (14.46%) and aldehyde (9.01%). As described in previous researches, the phenolic compounds were formed from the degradation of lignin in the feedstock as well as the decomposition of furfural derivatives, while the alcohols, acids and aldehydes were mainly originated from the hydrolysis and hydration reactions of cellulose and hemicellulose components in the feedstock [18,33,35]. When metallic Fe was applied in pure water, the contents of phenolic compounds and hydrocarbons increased from 32.62% to 38.08% and 4.30% to 9.03%, respectively, indicating the positive effects of Fe on lignin degradation and hydrogenation reactions of the reaction intermediates, while the content of acids in the oils was reduced by the Fe addition from 14.46% to 10.35%, reducing the corrosiveness of the oils and increasing the beneficial use of the oils. Similarly, liquefaction of cornstalk in ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) reaction medium, as shown in Fig. 6b, produced oils rich in phenolic compounds. For instance, the biocrude oil obtained in the mixed solvents without Fe addition contains phenolic compounds (42.49%), mainly phenol, 4-ethyl- (17.31%), phenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy- (6.69%), and phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy- (4.34%), which is consistent with the results by Liu et al. [36] and Ye et al [37]. Moreover, the content of esters in the ethanol–water mixed solvents is as high as 24.04% compared with only 5.29% in the oil obtained in pure water without Fe addition, including mainly hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester (6.30%), trisporic acid, methyl ester (5.52%) and androsterone acetate (3.17%), etc., due to the esterification reactions between the ethanol in the reaction medium and organic acids in the oil [27]. The biocrude oil obtained in the mixed solvents with the presence of metallic Fe contains mainly phenolics (49.03%), esters (21.01%) and hydrocarbons (13.57%). The use of metallic Fe increased the contents of phenolics and hydrocarbons in the oil, again suggesting the positive effect of Fe on lignin depolymerization and hydrogenation of the reaction intermediates in the ethanol–water mixed solvents. Whereas, the addition of Fe3O4 in the liquefaction showed almost no effect on the compositions of oil products, while the addition of Fe/Fe3O4 had similar effect with using metallic Fe alone, which is consistent with the results on biocrude oil yield (as shown previously in Fig. 4). In summary, the synergetic effect of ethanol–water mixed solvents and metallic Fe on the biomass liquefaction process led to the production of high-quality biocrude oil consisting mainly of phenolics, esters and hydrocarbons, making them more suitable for downstream utilization as fuels or chemicals. 3.2.3 FT-IR analysis of biocrude oil The functionality of some typical biocrude oil samples was characterized by FT-IR, although it might be difficult to draw any definite conclusions from the differences between the FTIR curves due to the complexity of lignocellulosic biomass [29]. Fig. 7 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the biocrude oils derived from cornstalk liquefaction in pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents with/without Fe-based additives at 300 °C for 30 min. Apparently, all spectra are similar, suggesting all biocrude oils obtained from the lignocellulosic feedstock have similar functional structures [33,38]. For instance, the broad peak at around 3350 cm−1 is corresponding to OH stretching vibration, which can be attributed to the presence of phenols, alcohols, carboxylic acids as well as the water contained in the oil samples. The peaks between 3000 and 2840 cm−1 are related to the symmetrical and asymmetrical CH stretching vibration of alkyl groups, and the absorbance at 1370 cm−1 can be ascribed to the CH blending of methyl and methylene groups. The presence of CH stretching vibration and the CH blending indicates the alkane groups in the biocrude oils. Besides, the adsorption peaks at 1611 cm−1, 1516 cm−1 and 1456 cm−1 imply the presence of the aryl groups in aromatic compounds, and the adsorption peak at 1612 cm−1 indicates the stretching vibration of aromatics. Meanwhile, the peak at 1700 cm−1 is ascribed to the CO stretching vibration of carbonyl groups mainly from carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and their derivatives. The IR absorption peaks at 1203 cm−1, 1112 cm−1, and 1047 cm−1 are attributed to the CO stretching vibrations from alcohols, ethers and esters. Finally, the bands between 690 and 950 cm−1 indicate the presence of single, polycyclic, and substituted aromatic groups. The FT-IR spectra of the biocrude oils derived in pure water and ethanol–water mixed solvents are compared in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b. The absorption peaks at 1700 cm−1 (CO) are more intensive in the oils obtained in pure water than those in ethanol–water mixed solvents, indicating higher contents of carboxylic acids, ketones as well as aldehydes compounds, which is in good agreement with the results from the GC–MS analysis (Fig. 6). Besides, the peaks at 3350 cm−1 are more intensive in the biocrude oils obtained in ethanol–water mixed solvents, especially in the oils produced from the experiments with Fe or Fe/Fe3O4 additives, which further confirms the promotion effect of metallic Fe on the decomposition of lignin forming more phenolic compounds in the resulted oils. 3.2.4 XRD analysis of recovered Fe-based additives As discussed in the previous sections, it is clear that HTL of lignocellulosic biomass in ethanol–water mixed solvents could be significantly promoted in presence of Fe, while the metallic Fe could be easily oxidized into Fe3O4 by the reaction medium to produce in-situ hydrogen under the liquefaction conditions [25]. To prove the reaction between metallic Fe and the reaction media, the SR products were collected from the liquefaction experiments of cornstalk in pure water, pure ethanol and ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v) at 300 °C for 30 min with Fe or Fe/Fe3O4 additives, respectively. Subsequently, XRD analysis was performed on the Fe-based additives recovered from SR products and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . As illustrated in Fig. 8a, the intense XRD signals at 2θ = 30.1°, 35.4°, 43.0°, 57.1° and 62.6° are attributed to Fe3O4, while the signals at 44.6°, 65.0° and 82.3° are derived from Fe [24]. As presented in Fig. 8b and Fig. 8d, only Fe3O4 signals were detected in the additives obtained from the tests in pure water or ethanol–water mixed solvents, which suggests complete conversion of metallic Fe into Fe3O4 due to the Fe-water reactions. In contrast, no Fe3O4 was detected in the additives from the liquefaction in pure ethanol with metallic Fe addition. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8c, both Fe and Fe3O4 were detected in the additives recovered from liquefaction in pure ethanol employing Fe/Fe3O4 mixture. The above observations suggest that metallic Fe could not react with ethanol under the liquefaction conditions. As a result, it could be concluded that the promotion effect of metallic Fe on biocrude oil production in ethanol–water mixed solvents was primarily owing to the in-situ hydrogen formed by the reaction between Fe and water."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, effects of metallic Fe on HTL of cornstalk for biocrude oil production were investigated in ethanol–water mixed solvents under various conditions. Pure water or ethanol reaction medium and Fe3O4 were also used as references to elucidate the role of Fe in the liquefaction process. This work demonstrated that metallic Fe promoted the yield and quality of the biocrude oil during HTL of cornstalk in pure water or ethanol–water mixed solvents. Fe3O4 only had slight catalytic effect in pure water, indicating that the in-situ hydrogen generated from the reaction between metallic Fe and water was the main cause to the promotion effect of metallic Fe in biomass HTL. The highest yield of biocrude oil (50.46 wt%) and biomass conversion (95.29 wt%) were obtained at 300 °C for 30 min with 10 wt% Fe loading in ethanol–water mixed solvents (50/50, v/v). The produced oil had an HHV of 30.86 MJ/kg. Elemental analysis of the obtained biocrude oils suggested that the in-situ hydrogen generated in the liquefaction with the metallic Fe could promote the hydrogenation and deoxygenation of biocrude oil, leading to biocrude products with a higher H/C and lower O/C and hence a greater HHV."
