0,Introduction,"Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), called as biodiesel, have attracted considerable attention for substituting fossil fuel and reducing the emission of CO2 because it can be made from bio-oil, such as vegetable oil, algae oil, and animal fat, through transesterification with methanol. Among the oils, vegetable oil is the main source for biodiesel because it has the most production all around the world and good cold flow properties due to the high degree of unsaturation [1,2]. Especially, monounsaturated FAMEs such as methyl oleate (C18:1), methyl palmitoleate (C16:1) have been identified as ideal components of biodiesel because of better oxidative stability as well as good cold flow properties than highly unsaturated FAMEs [3]. In addition to biodiesel, FAMEs that have a double bond can be utilized to a bio-refinery based on olefin metathesis to produce valuable products like lubricants, surfactants, and polymers [4,5]. C18:1, in particular, is preferred as a model compound for the olefin metathesis because products for the metathesis of C18:1 are simple [6,7]. Also, methyl linoleate (C18:2), and methyl linolenate (C18:3) that could be hydrogenated to C18:1 accounts for a high portion of FAMEs from vegetable oil so that C18:1 can be easily obtained [4]. Therefore, C18:1 is useful and valuable as biodiesel and raw materials for the biorefinery. For the production of C18:1, vegetable oil with high unsaturation is transesterified to FAMEs and the FAMEs are converted to C18:1 by partial hydrogenation in addition to using vegetable oil with high C18:1, such as camelia oil and olive oil. The reactions for increasing the portion of C18:1 have been usually conducted step by step [8], but a one-pot process combining transesterification and partial hydrogenation was suggested [9,10]. Hempseed oil was used and reacted with methanol at 180 ℃ under H2 of 3 MPa for 3 h using Cu/SrO. The FAMEs yield of 96 % was achieved and the content of C18:1 was increased from 10.1 % to 46.7 % without the increase of saturated FAMEs, methyl stearate (C18:0). Consequently, the transesterification and the partial hydrogenation has been simplified to one process. Similarly, conversion of unsaturated fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) to C18:1 was attempted by simultaneous transesterification and partial hydrogenation at 40 ℃ under H2 for more than 20 h using a recyclable polymer-supported Pd [11] and fatty acid was also done at 270 ℃ under H2 for 2 h using Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 or SiO2-ZrO2 [12]. However, the rate of hydrogenation was so slow that it took a long time to obtain a high portion of C18:1. Meanwhile, many researchers have paid attention to catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) where hydrogen donor is used instead of H2 gas. This is because it is not required to use explosive H2 gas in CTH. Tetralin [13], isopropanol [8,14], and glycerol [15,16] were used as hydrogen donor with catalysts such as Pd, Ni, Cu, and Co. Like the one-pot process described above, CTH can also be conducted along with transesterification or esterification. Researches for CTH along with transesterification have mainly focused on the conversion of fatty acid and oil to hydrocarbons and alcohol [13–19] and pyrolysis bio-oil to biofuel [20–22], not a preparation of useful C18:1. Also, they did not consider the effect of reaction variables on the reaction and conducted experiments in a limited condition. On the other hand, Shin et al. [23] suggested a simultaneous reaction for partial CTH and transesterification using methanol as a hydrogen donor with Cu powder under supercritical condition. The FAMEs yield of 90 % was achieved and the content of C18:1 was increased from 24.6 % to 54.3 % with the increase of C18:0 of only 2.7 % within 30 min. Even though enrichment of C18:1 was accomplished in the simultaneous reaction without addition of H2 in a brief time, the reaction has been not well understood because the research utilized the only Cu in one condition (320 ℃ and 20 MPa) and claimed that hydrogen for hydrogenation was donated by decomposition of methanol on Cu. According to previous researches [15,16], it is thought that glycerol that is made from transesterification of oil could be used as a hydrogen donor for the reaction. Therefore, this study will examine the possibility of Pd/Al2O3 and Ni which are mostly used for hydrogenation, and oxide forms of Cu and Ni as a catalyst for the one-pot reaction combining transesterification and partial CTH under supercritical methanol in order to concentrate C18:1. Also, a change of an amount of glycerol obtained from the reaction will be identified and the contribution of glycerol and methanol as hydrogen donor will be verified. Furthermore, the effects of reaction variables (temperature, pressure, a molar ratio of methanol to oil, and reaction time) will be investigated according to the catalysts of Pd/Al2O3, Cu, and Ni. Finally, the fuel properties of FAMEs from the one-pot reaction and characteristics of the catalysts for the reaction will be evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials Soybean oil (Beksul, CJ Co., Korea) which has high polyunsaturated fatty acid content was used in this study. Methanol (99.5 %) and n-heptane (99.0 %) were purchased from Samchun Pure Chemical Co. (Seoul, Korea) for reagent and analytic solvent, respectively. Methyl heptadecanoate (C17:0, Sigma-aldrich Co., Seoul, Korea) was used as the internal standard FAMEs for gas chromatography (GC) analysis Copper (Cu, 99.7 %, Product No. 357456), copper (II) oxide (CuO, 98 %, Product No. 208841), nickel (Ni, 99.7 %, Product No. 266981), nickel (II) oxide (NiO, 99 %, Product No. 399523) were provided by Sigma-aldrich Co. (Seoul, Korea) and commercial palladium-doped alumina (Pd/Al2O3, 5 % Palladium, Product No.46-1950) was purchased from Stem Chemicals, Inc. (Newburyport, USA). The materials were stored at a desiccator and used without any treatment."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure A batch-type reactor system was used for the one-pot reaction as described from [24,25]. A stainless steel (SUS 316) reactor with an internal volume of 22 ml was used. Before the reaction, Soybean oil and methanol were injected into the reactor with an amount corresponding to the desired reaction condition based on density data from NIST Chemistry Webbook. After the injection of soybean oil (1.23 g–8.32 g) and methanol (2.03 g–8.47 g), a metal catalyst (123 mg–832 mg) of 10 wt% of the oil was put to the reactor. Subsequently, the reactor was immersed in a preheated molten salt bath containing KNO3, NaNO3, and Ca(NO3)2 to heat the reactor to the desired temperature. Then, it was shaken horizontally at a frequency of 0.85 Hz for a reaction time using a tailor-made shaker. Before the experiment, the temperature inside the reactor was measured by inserting a thermocouple inside the reactor in advance. The time when the temperature reached the desired value was set to the reaction time of 0 min. After the reaction time, the reactor was rapidly quenched in cool water bath to stop the reaction. The reaction temperature was set to 250 ℃, 300 ℃, and up to 320 ℃ to avoid thermal decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acid, such as C18:2, C18:3. Pressure was set at 10 MPa, 20 MPa, and 30 MPa. A molar ratio of methanol to oil was changed from 15:1 to 60:1. An amount of catalyst was fixed at 10 wt% of soybean oil. Reaction products obtained from the reactor were centrifuged to remove the catalysts from products. After that, residual methanol was evaporated at 80 ℃ under vacuum for 10 min by using a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, FAMEs and glycerol were separated by centrifugation. The FAMEs were acquired from an upper layer and analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). All of the experiments were performed three times and data from the experiments was documented with the mean average values."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis 2.3.1 Catalyst characterization The metal catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, JP/D/MAX-2500H, Rigaku Co., Japan) with Cu Kα radiation at 50 kV and 200 mA. A detection angle was from 10° to 90° at a scanning speed of 10°/min. In order to determine a specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used with N2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K in BELSORP-mini II (MicrotracBEL Co., Japan). The catalysts were pretreated at 150 ℃ under vacuum before BET analysis. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to figure out a shape and a size of the catalysts using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55 V P. 2.3.2 FAMEs analysis Based on European standard [26], FAMEs were analyzed by GC-FID (Agilent, HP-6890) with a capillary column (Agilent, HP-INNOWAX, 30 m ×0.32 mm ×0.25 μm). Carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Temperatures for inlet and detector were set to 260 ℃ and oven temperature was elevated at a rate of 5 ℃/min from 150 ℃ to 250 ℃, which was then maintained at 250 ℃ for 10 min. Split ratio was set to 100:1. Methyl heptadecanoate was used as the internal standard to calculate an amount and a yield of FAMEs in the products. Although the yield is defined as a ratio of the weight of FAMEs to the weight of FAMEs that can be made from the used vegetable oil, we calculated the yield as the ratio of the weight of FAMEs obtained by GC to the weight of products in the upper layer. This is because a washing step is skipped in the supercritical transesterification process, which means that weight loss is negligible during the reaction and separation. The type and the retention time of FAMEs were identified by GC–MS and the amount of each FAMEs was calculated from the fraction of area under the peak. During the reaction, isomerization and double bond migration of unsaturated FAMEs could occur because of the high temperature and the active surface of catalysts [27,28]. In this study, FAMEs were sorted by the number of double bonds and carbons of FAMEs, not the location and moiety of them. Selectivity for C18:1 was defined as the ratio of increase of C18:1 to decrease of C18:2 and C18:3 during hydrogenation. In order to check availability of the FAMEs as biodiesel fuel, oxidation stability and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) were estimated by using the relationships of these properties and fatty acid composition of FAMEs [29]. Also, cetane number for the FAMEs was predicted by using the correlation between the numbers of carbon atoms and double bonds and the cetane number [30]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns for the catalysts provided from manufacturers were obtained to characterize composition and crystalline morphology of the catalysts (Figs. 1 and 2 ). XRD pattern of Cu, CuO, Ni, and Ni exhibited their intrinsic peaks and other peaks were not detected (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the XRD pattern for commercial Pd/Al2O3 had peaks for Pd and Al2O3 and a small peak for PdO (Fig. 2). Although there was a peak for PdO, Pd/Al2O3 was also used like other catalysts without a pretreatment because it was a commercial catalyst and the intensity of the peak was weak. Surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter of the catalysts were determined by using the BET method (Table 1 ). Pd/Al2O3 had the largest surface area because it is supported on γ-Al2O3. The surface areas of Cu and Ni were similar to each other. The surface area and the total pore volume of Pd/Al2O3 were much bigger than that of Cu, Ni, and their oxides (CuO and NiO), but the average pore diameter of every catalyst did not show any big difference. A difference of the surface areas of catalysts could have an effect on reactivity. However, it was thought that the effect would be negligible for confirming a characteristic of the catalysts in the reaction because Pd loading for Pd/Al2O3 was as low as 5 wt% and a large amount of catalyst was used. In order to figure out size and shape of the catalysts, SEM images were obtained (Fig. S1). The particle sizes of Pd/Al2O3 and Cu were bigger than other catalysts, but the sizes were not significantly different. The shape of particles of most catalysts had an uneven sphere, but the shape of Cu looked like a branch."
7,Effect and characteristics of catalysts on the one-pot reaction,"3.2 Effect and characteristics of catalysts on the one-pot reaction 3.2.1 Effect of catalysts on the one-pot reaction In order to verify an effect of the catalysts on the reaction, a series of simultaneous reactions of transesterification and hydrogenation under supercritical methanol without H2 were conducted at 20 MPa, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 with a catalyst of 10 wt% for 30 min by changing reaction temperature (250 ℃, 300 ℃, and 320 ℃) and the catalysts (Pd/Al2O3, Cu, CuO, Ni, and NiO) (Fig. 3 ). Herein, the yield of FAMEs and the reduction of C18:2 and C18:3 to C18:0 and C18:1 mean the degree of transesterification and hydrogenation, respectively. Supercritical transesterification of soybean oil was conducted at 20 MPa, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 without a catalyst for 30 min by changing reaction temperature (250 ℃, 300 ℃, and 320 ℃) (Fig. 3(a)). The result was used to confirm the effect of catalysts on transesterification and hydrogenation by evaluating a change of FAMEs yield and FAMEs composition. In the absence of a catalyst, the yield of FAMEs increased rapidly from 250 ℃ to 300 ℃ and decreased at 320 ℃. Probably, the decrease would be owing to the thermal decomposition of polyunsaturated FAMEs [31,32]. The composition of FAMEs did not change although C18:3 decreased slightly from 6.2 % (250 ℃) to 5.4 (300 ℃) and 4.5 % (320 ℃) because of the thermal decomposition. Pd/Al2O3 had the highest reactivity in both transesterification and hydrogenation among catalysts (Fig. 3(b)). However, Pd/Al2O3 showed low selectivity for C18:1, which is in agreement with references using Pd as a catalyst for hydrogenation [28,33]. Especially, Pd/Al2O3 hydrogenated most of polyunsaturated FAMEs to C18:0 and C18:1 with low selectivity for C18:1 at 320 ℃. Also, the FAMEs yield doubled at 250 ℃, which would be attributed to the acidity of Al2O3 that can be used as an acidic catalyst in supercritical transesterification [34,35]. Generally, Cu-based systems have been utilized for hydrogenation of FAMEs due to their high selectivity for the reduction of polyunsaturated FAMEs to C18:1 without affecting remaining C18:1 [3,36]. In accordance with the high selectivity of Cu-based systems for C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 were converted to C18:1 without increasing C18:0 (Fig. 3(c)). However, the FAMEs yield of about 4 % decreased when it was compared to the non-catalytic reaction. On the other hand, Ni showed big reduction of the yield of FAMEs and lower reactivity of hydrogenation than Cu although the selectivity was similar (Fig. 3(e)). Oxide forms of Cu, Ni did not hydrogenate FAMEs, but CuO made a little enhancement of the yield of FAMEs (Fig. 3(d), (f)). Probably, the weak basicity of CuO played the catalytic role in supercritical transesterification. In the previous research [23], it was reported that hydrogen is supplied by decomposition of methanol on Cu during partial hydrogenation of unsaturated feedstock in supercritical methanol and the yield of FAMEs in the simultaneous reaction could be reduced by a decrease of the molar ratio of methanol to oil because of the decomposition of methanol. However, the molar ratio was just changed from 45 to 44.37, which was calculated by measuring the amount of generated gases. To check a decrease of methanol on Pd/Al2O3 and Ni in supercritical methanol, methanol and the catalysts were reacted at 300 ℃ and 20 MPa for 30 min without soybean oil. When the amount of remained methanol was measured, the methanol of 1.7 % decreased on Pd/Al2O3. For Cu and Ni, the reduction amounts of methanol were the same as 0.8 %. The molar ratios of methanol to oil were slightly reduced from 45 to 43.34, 44.29, and 44.24 for Pd/Al2O3, Cu, and Ni, respectively. The molar ratio decreased by Cu was similar with 44.37 obtained from the previous study [23]. Although the reduction of methanol on every catalyst was observed, it seems to be negligible for the reduction of FAMEs yield because the reduction of the molar ratio was just less than 2. Thus, it was supposed that the reduction of FAMEs yield in this one-pot reaction would be affected by other factors than the methanol decomposition such as adsorption of unsaturated FAMEs on a catalyst. This is possibly because unsaturated FAMEs were adsorbed on the catalyst before hydrogenation and then hydrogenated with absorbed hydrogen according to Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism that explains a mechanism of hydrogenation [27,36]. However, it is thought that further research is needed to identify other factors. In this work, transesterification and hydrogenation need to occur simultaneously because this work is trying to combine the two processes and focusing on the simultaneous reaction. Therefore, only Pd/Al2O3, Cu, and Ni were used in experiments for the change of different reaction variables because CuO and NiO did not exhibit any activity for hydrogenation. Also, 300 ℃ appeared to be more appropriate than 320 ℃ and was used in the experiments because the yield of FAMEs was reduced by the thermal decomposition at 320 ℃. The relatively low reactivity of hydrogenation at 300 ℃ could be enhanced by supporting the metals on a porous supporter to increase a surface area of the metals because hydrogenation is a surface reaction [27]. 3.2.2 Glycerol decomposition during the one-pot reaction Shin et al. [23] identified a formation of H2, CO, and CO2 by analyzing a gas product after the one-pot reaction with GC and suggested that that hydrogen for hydrogenation would be supplied by decomposition of supercritical methanol on Cu. Meanwhile, glycerol has been used as a hydrogen donor in hydrogenation and deoxygenation under Pd- and Ni-based catalysts at 250 ℃–300 ℃ [15,16]. Thus, glycerol made during transesterification could also be used as a hydrogen donor for the one-pot reaction. In order to identify a change of glycerol in the reaction, the amounts of glycerol obtained after the one-pot reaction were compared (Fig. 4 ). Samples were made at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 60:1 with a catalyst of 10 wt% for 30 min. In the condition, yields of FAMEs were similar to each other. If glycerol was not influenced by the catalysts in the one-pot reaction, the amounts of glycerol should be similar to each other. However, Pd/Al2O3 decreased glycerol of 94.2 % compared to glycerol in the absence of a catalyst. Cu and Ni also decreased the glycerol of 82.9 % and 67.2 %, respectively. Therefore, it was confirmed that hydrogen in the one-pot process was generated by decomposition of glycerol as well as methanol under the supercritical condition. Also, the decomposition of glycerol would also supply hydrogen to the one-pot process. 3.2.3 Mass balance for hydrogen In order to identify contributions of methanol and glycerol as the hydrogen donor to the one-pot reaction, a mass balance of hydrogen obtained by the decomposition of glycerol and methanol and used by hydrogenation of FAMEs was evaluated. The amount of hydrogen which was generated by the decomposition was calculated through the measured amounts of the decomposed methanol and glycerol in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Also, an amount of hydrogen used for hydrogenation in the one-pot reaction was calculated based on the amount of hydrogenated FAMEs at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, and a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 with Cu of 10 wt% of oil for 30 min. It was assumed that soybean oil was completely transesterified to FAMEs in the one-pot process. When soybean oil was fixed at 1 mol, the amounts of H2 from methanol and glycerol on Cu at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, and a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 were 0.72 mol and 1.66 mol, respectively. The amount of H2 required for the partial hydrogenation was 0.92 mol. If FAMEs were fully hydrogenated, the amount of H2 was 4.97 mol. The total amount of H2 supplied by the decomposition was enough to partially hydrogenate FAMEs. However, it was deficient for the decomposition of methanol to supply hydrogen to the one-pot process because the decomposition of methanol made less H2 than the required H2. Therefore, it was thought that the decomposition of glycerol would also supply hydrogen to the one-pot reaction. Moreover, the decomposition of glycerol produced more hydrogen at the condition despite the plentiful amount of methanol. Therefore, it was supposed that glycerol could be easier to decompose than methanol. H2 which can be obtained by decomposing all of the glycerol made from oil was 2.00 mol. In the case of Pd/Al2O3, most FAMEs were hydrogenated and the required H2 was 4.97 mol which was more than the H2 obtained from the decomposition of all glycerol. As a result, it was thought that the decomposition of glycerol would supply hydrogen for the one-pot reaction in an initial step rapidly and methanol would provide the hydrogen for the one-pot reaction steadily. 3.2.4 Change of the metal catalysts in the reaction Pd/Al2O3, Cu, CuO, Ni, and NiO were analyzed by XRD after the reaction at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 with a catalyst of 10 wt% for 30 min. XRD data of Cu, CuO, Ni, and NiO showed that these catalysts did not change after the reaction by observing unchanged peaks (Fig. 1). On the other hand, after the reaction, a decrease of intensity of PdO and an increase of intensity of Pd were identified in XRD data of Pd/Al2O3 with the peaks for Pd, PdO, and γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 2). It could be thought that PdO on Al2O3 was reduced to Pd during the one-pot reaction in supercritical methanol. In order to confirm a reduction of a catalyst in supercritical methanol, CuO/SiO2 that was synthesized by the incipient wetness method [37] was tested in the supercritical methanol at 300 ℃ and 20 MPa for 30 min. As a result, diffraction peaks of CuO disappeared and peaks of Cu and Cu2O were detected by XRD analysis of CuO/SiO2 after the reaction. This means that the reduction of a catalyst in supercritical methanol was not confined to Pd and Al2O3. Also, the reduction rate was much faster than the conventional reduction method for a catalyst where it takes several hours to reduce a catalyst at a specific temperature under H2. However, it remains to be seen whether other metals that cannot decompose methanol in the supercritical condition can also be reduced in supercritical methanol."
8,Effect of reaction conditions on the one-pot reaction,"3.3 Effect of reaction conditions on the one-pot reaction 3.3.1 Pressure An effect of reaction pressure on the simultaneous reaction was identified with experiments at 300 ℃, and a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 with a catalyst of 10 wt% of oil for 30 min by varying pressure (10 MPa, 20 MPa, and 30 MPa) and the catalysts (Fig. 5 ). Generally, the change of pressure is of minor importance in the transesterification of oils under the supercritical condition provided that pressure is higher than 20 MPa [38,39]. In this study, the yield of FAMEs also did not change remarkably with pressure but was slightly high at 20 MPa (Fig. 5(a)). The yield of FAMEs for Pd/Al2O3 was similar to that in the absence of a catalyst (Fig. 5(b)). In the case of hydrogenation, more unsaturated FAMEs were hydrogenated by Pd/Al2O3 at lower pressure. Especially, most of polyunsaturated FAMEs were hydrogenated at 10 MPa and the composition of polyunsaturated FAMEs was less than 1.0 % without selectivity for C18:1 after the reaction. Meanwhile, Cu showed lower FAMEs yield at a higher pressure and the degrees of hydrogenation of unsaturated FAMEs were almost constant at larger than 20 MPa (Fig. 5(c)). Ni had the higher reactivity for hydrogenation with selectivity for C18:1 at lower pressure, but the yields of FAMEs were low at all pressure, not exceeding 60 % (Fig. 5(d)). Among the catalysts, Ni showed higher reactivity for hydrogenation with higher selectivity for C18:1 at low pressure than Pd/Al2O3 and Cu although the yield of FAMEs was low. If the yield of FAMEs for Ni is enhanced by supporting Ni on alkaline metal oxide or other materials that can improve the transesterification of oil, Ni could be utilized as a catalyst in the one-pot process at low pressure. In the case of Pd/Al2O3 and Cu, 20 MPa seems to the proper pressure for the one-pot reaction of Pd/Al2O3 and Cu because of high FAMEs yield and appropriate reactivity for hydrogenation at the pressure. 3.3.2 Molar ratio of methanol to oil Experiments of the one-pot reaction at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, a catalyst of 10 wt% with varying a molar ratio of methanol to oil from 15 to 60 for 30 min were conducted to confirm how the molar ratio influences the one-pot reaction (Fig. 6 ). In supercritical transesterification of vegetable oil, the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 40:1 to 45:1 was recommended as an optimal condition [40]. This is because transesterification is a reversible reaction and an excess of methanol promotes the forward reaction. In our research, it was identified that the yield of FAMEs in the absence of a catalyst increased slightly with the rise of the molar ratio of methanol to oil and was constant after 45:1 (Fig. 6(a)). Pd/Al2O3 showed a similar yield of FAMEs in the absence of the catalyst. The degree of hydrogenation increased and the slight increase of C18:0 was observed according to the rise of the molar ratio (Fig. 6(b)). In the case of Cu, the yield of FAMEs increased as the molar ratio increased, but the degree of hydrogenation decreased (Fig. 6(c)). The yield of FAMEs for Ni was low until the molar ratio of 45:1, but it increased dramatically at 60:1 (Fig. 6(d)). The degree of hydrogenation increased as the molar ratio increased and was maintained after the molar ratio of 45:1. Like the supercritical transesterification, the molar ratio of 45:1 also appeared to be appropriate in the simultaneous reaction because there was not a big difference for reactivity of both the transesterification and hydrogenation in the simultaneous reaction at higher than the molar ratio of 45:1 except for Ni. It was suggested that much more methanol was needed for the transesterification of oil in the one-pot reaction on Ni catalyst because the FAMEs yield for Ni exhibited the dramatic rise at the molar ratio of 60:1. 3.3.3 Reaction time By increasing reaction time from 15 min to 60 min, the one-pot reaction was conducted at 300 ℃, 20 MPa, and the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 45:1 with a catalyst of 10 wt% (Fig. 7 ). Supercritical transesterification reached the FAMEs yield of higher than 90 % at 30 min, but the yield increased slightly as time goes on (Fig. 7(a)). With Pd/Al2O3, the FAMEs yield of higher than 90 % was obtained from the reaction time of 15 min and unsaturated FAMEs were hydrogenated according to the reaction time (Fig. 7(b)). The composition of C18:1 was maintained at about 45 %, but it probably would decrease when more time passed. The yield of FAMEs for Cu approached 90 % after 45 min and unsaturated FAMEs were hydrogenated with selectivity for C18:1 (Fig. 7(c)). However, the amount of C18:1 did not exceed 60 % after 45 min. It was thought that agglomeration of Cu powder may lead to slowing down the reaction rate of hydrogenation as time goes on because agglomeration was observed after the reaction and hydrogenation is a surface reaction [27]. In the case of Ni, the FAMEs yield was less than 70 % even at 60 min and the change of composition of FAMEs was not regular according to the time (Fig. 7(d)). It was supposed that the irregular change of composition of FAMEs may mean the reversibility of hydrogenation over Ni. The yield of FAMEs for Pd/Al2O3 increased remarkably within 15 min compared to other catalysts. This is because Al2O3 would play a catalytic role in the transesterification as described in 3.2.1. Consequently, highly hydrogenated FAMEs could be gained by using Pd/Al2O3 within a shorter time than the other catalysts. On the other hand, Cu concentrated C18:1 which can be utilized as a bio-refinery resource and has good quality as fuel [3–7]. In terms of C18:1 production, Cu seems to be suitable for the purpose. For Ni, the appropriate reactivity for the one-pot reaction was not obtained despite the long reaction time of 60 min. Therefore, it was presumed that Ni would be more effective in the hydrogenation of oil or FAMEs than the one-pot reaction. By changing the reaction variables, the effects of the variables on the reaction were confirmed according to the catalysts. However, it seemed to be inadequate to control the reaction only by changing the variables. Therefore, an attempt to synthesize an appropriate catalyst appears to be essential. Also, the reaction rate of transesterification was usually faster than hydrogenation, so the gap of their reactivities must be overcome to reduce the reaction time for the one-pot process although hydrogenation in the simultaneous process was already faster than conventional hydrogenation [41] due to high temperature."
9,Biodiesel properties of FAMEs produced by the one-pot reaction,"3.4 Biodiesel properties of FAMEs produced by the one-pot reaction Cold-flow properties (Cold Filter Plugging Point, CFPP), oxidative stability, and cetane number of biodiesel are regarded as important properties in fuel. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the fuel properties are directly related to compositions of unsaturated FAMEs in biodiesel and correlations between the properties and the compositions have been developed [29,30]. For this reason, the properties of the biodiesel can be improved by controlling the degree of unsaturation of FAMEs through hydrogenation. To see if the FAMEs obtained from this study were appropriate as biodiesel, their fuel properties were calculated by the correlations between the properties and the compositions of FAMEs (Table 2 ). FAMEs made from supercritical transesterification of soybean oil had good CFPP of -4.6 ℃, but it had lower oxidative stability and cetane number than the standard oxidative stability of 6 h and cetane number of 51. On the other hand, FAMEs gained by the simultaneous reaction showed satisfactory fuel properties compared to the biodiesel standard specification except for CFPP in Pd/Al2O3 and oxidative stability in Ni. FAMEs produced from the one-pot reaction for Pd/Al2O3 had a higher CFPP of 3.3 ℃ than the biodiesel standard of 0 ℃ because Pd/Al2O3 hydrogenated too much unsaturated FAMEs to saturated FAMEs, which have higher melting points than unsaturated FAMEs. FAMEs from Cu showed good fuel quality for the standards of CFPP, oxidative stability, and cetane number. Ni did not produce FAMEs with sufficient oxidative stability. Cu produced FAMEs with good fuel qualities due to good selectivity for C18:1 which has good quality as fuel. On the other hand, Pd/Al2O3 produced FAMEs with higher CFPP than the standard owing to high reactivity for hydrogenation without selectivity for C18:1. The one-pot process using Pd/Al2O3 needs to control the reactivity of hydrogenation by changing the reaction variables. FAMEs from Ni would be difficult to be used as fuel because of low FAMEs contents even if the FAMEs can be purified by a distillation process."
10,FAMEs yield and selectivity for C18:1 according to catalysts,"3.5 FAMEs yield and selectivity for C18:1 according to catalysts FAMEs yield and selectivity for C18:1 from all of the data were plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively (Fig. 8 ). Pd/Al2O3 had the highest yield of FAMEs, but the selectivity for C18:1 was very low because it produced much-saturated FAMEs such as C18:0. Ni had a low yield of FAMEs although the selectivity for C18:1 was high. On the other hand, Cu showed both the high yield of FAMEs and the selectivity of C18:1. Therefore, it was thought that Cu could be a more appropriate catalyst in the one-pot reaction for the production of C18:1 for bio-refinery and biodiesel with high fuel quality than the other catalysts."
11,Conclusions,"This study confirmed that Pd/Al2O3 and Ni, as well as Cu, have been active for the one-pot reaction of transesterification and hydrogenation under supercritical methanol without addition of H2. In the one-pot reaction, it was identified that the glycerol produced from the transesterification of oil decomposed on the catalysts like methanol and mass balance for hydrogen between hydrogenation and the decomposition suggested that glycerol could also supply hydrogen to hydrogenation like methanol. During the reaction, the reduction of PdO on Pd/Al2O3 was observed in supercritical methanol, which was verified by reducing CuO/SiO2 in the same condition. By changing the reaction variables, the effects of the variables on the reaction were confirmed according to the catalysts. However, it appeared to be inadequate to control the reaction only by changing the variables. Therefore, an attempt to synthesize an appropriate catalyst appears to be essential. Despite the limitation, biodiesel with high fuel quality was able to be obtained by the one-pot reaction. Consequently, this result could be helpful to understand the characteristics of the reaction according to catalysts and conditions and determine a proper metal catalyst for the production of C18:1 as a raw material for bio-refinery and biodiesel with improved fuel quality."
