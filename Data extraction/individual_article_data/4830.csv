0,Introduction,"Fast-growing eucalyptus trees have the potential to be a source of biomass for biofuel production in several countries (Shepherd et al., 2011), and in Brazil some factors suggest that this hardwood tree can be used for jet fuel production. Perhaps the most important factor is that Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers are interested in expanding their business towards the bio-economy (Mariano, 2015a). In this regard, renewable jet fuel is compelling because of the high market potential value created by the commitment of the aviation industry to reduce their CO2 emissions by 50% (compared to 2005 levels) by 2050. In support to this ambitious target, eucalyptus planted forests have been recognized as a greenhouse effect mitigation activity for combining advanced silviculture practices and expansion in pasture lands (Boeing et al., 2013; Fibria, 2016). Moreover, eucalyptus forests are harvested year-round. This is an advantage over sugarcane, which is not harvested during the summer rainy season. Therefore, eucalyptus pulp companies could offer a renewable jet fuel not affected by price variations related toharvest and off-season periods. On the technology side, the choice among different process alternatives is not trivial. Technologies are at different development stages (Wang et al., 2016), and a good fit with a pulp mill is site- and company-specific. Thermochemical pathways (pyrolysis-to-jet, syngas-to-jet) are suitable for recalcitrant, heterogenous feedstock (e.g. forest residues, black liquor, and kraft lignin). Biochemical pathways (sugars-to-jet, alcohols-to-jet), on the other hand, are adequate for eucalyptus wood chips and especially interesting to companies aiming organosolv lignin-based products. The competitiveness of these products certainly depends on the value created from the sugars fraction. Moreover, the alcohols-to-jet (ATJ) pathway makes it possible for pulp companies to mitigate market and technology risks. In fact, this technological pathway allows for a phased approach to investment, and in the first phase pulp companies can adopt the conservative strategy of selling existing products in existing markets (e.g. ethanol). Meanwhile, the second investment in the alcohol conversion would be subject to technology maturity, favorable market prices, and policy incentives for renewable jet fuel. For the first phase of investment in a eucalyptus alcohol-to-jet fuel plant, ethanol and n-butanol plants are promising candidates. Both could generate attractive and similar economic returns for pulp companies that decide not to invest in the alcohol conversion unit (Pereira et al., 2018). However, it is not obvious which production pathway gives better economic advantages to eucalyptus jet fuel. Using agricultural residues for feedstock, Atsonios et al. (2015) reported that renewable jet fuel can have a slightly lower selling price if derived from n-butanol instead of ethanol. Nevertheless, it is possible that this result cannot be extrapolated to pulp companies planning to produce jet fuel from eucalyptus using a lignin-centric pretreatment process, the organosolv technology, and a phased approach to investment. Furthermore, in this article we argue that this competition should not only be assessed by conventional economic metrics, but also by carbon footprint, and a set of criteria that measure competitiveness and technology risk. The aim of this research, therefore, was to propose a multi-criteria decision-making framework to elucidate the competition between the ethanol and butanol pathway in the context of the suggested phased implementation of eucalyptus-to-jet fuel plants."
1,Material and methods,
2,Process design,"2.1 Process design The host eucalyptus pulp mill is a modern site that produces 1.25 million adt (air dry ton) pulp per year, and its energy and mass balance (Fig. 1 ) was implemented in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. In the mill, recovery and power boilers produce high-pressure steam (85 bar) that is converted to power in back pressure and condensing steam turbines. In its original configuration (i.e. before annexing the jet fuel plant), the mill has excess steam (113 t/h at 2.5 bar) and sells power to the grid (133 kWh/adt or 19 MW). The waste water treatment (WWT) unit processes 3400 m3/h. The pulp mill supplies steam and power to the jet fuel plant, whose energy and mass balance was included in the Excel model of the mill to calculate variations in the steam and power balance of the cogeneration system. The jet fuel plant receives 2000 dry ton eucalyptus wood per day (Eucalyptus urograndis; 45.5% cellulose; 20.3% hemicellulose; 29.7% lignin; 4.5% extractives and ashes on dry basis; 45% moisture content). The wood is chipped and 97% of the chips are fed to the jet fuel plant; the remaining part (64 dry t/d) falls out of specification and is sent to a power boiler. The core process steps of the jet fuel plant are organosolv pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, alcohol separation, and catalytic oligomerization of the alcohol followed by hydrogenation (Fig. 2 ). We assumed that the organosolv pretreatment of eucalyptus has the same yield and utility consumption factors reported by Nitzsche et al. (2016). The organosolv pretreatment uses ethanol (50% aqueous solution; 4 ton solution per wet ton biomass) as solvent to remove lignin. After pretreatment, ethanol is recovered by distillation and recycled at a rate of 99.5% (Mesa et al., 2016). The organosolv lignin stream (moisture content of 5%) has 60% of the lignin present in the wood. This lignin is used as fuel in the cogeneration system in the first five years of operation and then sold to the market in the following years. The stream sent to enzymatic hydrolysis has 100%, 29%, and 34% of the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin present in the eucalyptus, respectively. Consequently, the major portion of the hemicellulose (71%) and the remaining lignin are in a dilute aqueous stream, which is sent to the WWT unit of the mill. The enzymatic hydrolysis runs with solids loading of 20 wt% and enzymes loading of 6 mg/g cellulose. Enzymes, purchased from an off-site supplier, convert 77% of the cellulose to glucose and 26% of the hemicellulose to xylose (Nitzsche et al., 2016). In the resulting sugars stream, glucose (181 g/L) and xylose (8 g/L) account for 96% and 4% of the total sugar available for fermentation (33 ton/h), respectively. Non-converted solids (50% moisture content) are burned in a power boiler purchased to this end (150 t/h HP steam production capacity). In the fermentation step, three options were considered: (1) conventional ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (scenario EtOH), (2) ABE (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation by regular Clostridium strain (scenario But), and (3) ABE fermentation by genetically-modified (GM) Clostridium strain with improved butanol yield (scenario But-GMO) (Fig. 2). In scenario EtOH, glucose at 160 g/L is completely consumed, and ethanol yield is 0.48 ton ethanol/ton glucose (theoretical yield is 0.51). Eleven percent of the ethanol production (hydrous ethanol, 95 vol.%) is used as makeup for the organosolv pretreatment. In scenarios But and But-GMO, initial sugar concentration in the fermentation is 58 g/L glucose and 2 g/L xylose. The regular Clostridium strain converts 95% and 80% of glucose and xylose, respectively. Butanol, acetone, and ethanol yields are 0.20, 0.10, and 0.02, respectively (ABE theoretical yield is 0.41). The GM Clostridium strain converts 95% and 90% of glucose and xylose, respectively. Butanol, acetone, and ethanol yields are 0.28, 0.08, and 0.01, respectively (Mariano et al., 2013). All ethanol produced in the ABE fermentation supplies part of the makeup for the organosolv pretreatment. The other part comes from the market (sugarcane ethanol), and the amount depends on the scenario. Low pressure steam demand by the distillation was calculated using consumption factors reported by Nitzsche et al. (2016) and Mariano and Maciel Filho (2012). Distillation stillage (wastewater) is sent to the WWT unit of the mill. Design parameters for the last step of the process (alcohol-to-jet) were obtained from Crawford et al. (2016) (scenario EtOH) and Atsonios et al. (2015) (scenarios But and But-GMO). In scenario EtOH, the ethanol is dehydrated to ethylene (0.58 ton ethylene/ton ethanol; theoretical yield is 0.61), and the ethylene stream is oligomerized and then hydrotreated to yield jet fuel (paraffinic kerosene; 0.96 ton jet fuel/ton ethylene; theoretical yield is 1.01). Jet fuel production is 7.6 ton/h, and wood consumption is 11 dry ton eucalyptus wood/ton jet fuel. In scenarios But and But-GMO, butanol is dehydrated to butene (0.72 ton butene/ton butanol; theoretical yield is 0.76) and then hydrotreated to yield jet fuel (paraffinic kerosene; 0.99 ton jet fuel/ton butene; theoretical yield is 1.04). Jet fuel production is 4.4 (But) and 6.2 (But-GMO) ton/h, and wood consumption is 19 (But) and 13 (But-GMO) dry ton eucalyptus wood/ton jet fuel. In all scenarios, hydrogen (0.04 kg H2/L jet fuel; jet fuel density is 750 kg/m3) is produced on-site by reforming natural gas (0.347 kg H2/kg of natural gas) (Crawford et al., 2016). To meet the natural gas demand, the existing supply to the mill (âˆ¼40,000 t/y or 1.6 GJ/adt pulp) must be increased by 25% (EtOH), 15% (But), and 20% (But-GMO)."
3,Economic analysis,"2.2 Economic analysis The economic analysis considered a phased approach to investment. In the first phase, the alcohol facility runs for 5 years before the ATJ plant is installed in the second phase. The phased approach also guided the marketing strategy for organosolv lignin. The lignin is burned in the cogeneration system in the first phase of the project while applications for this product are developed. After five years of operation, organosolv lignin is sold for US$ 520/ton (Nitzsche et al., 2016) even in scenarios in which the jet fuel plant is not installed. The economic model developed in Microsoft Excel was connected to the energy and mass balances. We used the discounted cash flow analysis to calculate internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), and the minimum selling price (MSP) of jet fuel at the mill gate that ensures an IRR of 20%. Single-point sensitivity analysis assessed the effect of technical and economic parameters on jet fuel MSP. Parameters with larger effects were included in a Monte Carlo risk analysis (5000 iterations implemented as an Excel macro) to measure the probability of (i) jet fuel MSP be lower than 2.00 US$/l, and (ii) IRR (without implementing phase 2) be greater than 20%. The sensitivity of jet fuel MSP was also assessed against installing an anaerobic digestion unit to process the sugar stream sent to the WWT unit. This analysis assumed that 1 kg of sugar yields 0.35 Nm3 biogas (21.3 MJ/Nm3) (Mariano et al., 2013), which is sent to the power boiler. Main assumptions of the economic analysis are presented in Table 1 ."
4,Carbon footprint assessment,"2.3 Carbon footprint assessment The carbon footprint of eucalyptus jet fuel was calculated using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method based on the cradle-to-gate approach according to the ISO 14040 (2006), ISO 14044 (2006), and ISO 13065 (2015) standards. â€˜Cradleâ€™ was defined as eucalyptus wood at the pulp mill gate (TrÃªs Lagoas, MS, Brazil), and â€˜gateâ€™ was defined as the eucalyptus jet fuel delivered to airports in SÃ£o Paulo city (SP, Brazil). System boundary considered the eucalyptus-to-jet fuel plant and has the following inputs: (i) feedstock, (ii) electricity produced at the mill, (iii) natural gas to produce hydrogen, (iv) sugarcane ethanol (as makeup ethanol for the organosolv pretreatment in scenarios But and But-GMO), and (v) enzymes produced off-site. The outputs of the system are (i) wastewater sent to the WWT unit of the mill, (ii) co-products, and (iii) eucalyptus jet fuel. Output of CO2 from fermentation, combustion of non-converted fibers (cogeneration), and combustion of jet fuel was considered biogenic and not included in the inventory. The LCA was conducted using the software openLCA (v.1.5.0) in combination with the Ecoinvent 3.3 database. Impact category is Global Warming Potential (IPCC 2013 - GWP 100a) expressed as equivalents of carbon dioxide emissions (g CO2 equivalent). The functional unit is 1 MJ of jet fuel delivered to airports in SÃ£o Paulo, SP. The CO2 emission factor for enzymes production (9 kg CO2 eq./kg enzymes) is not available in the Ecoinvent database and was obtained from Liptow et al. (2013). Transport distances were calculated based on the assumption that eucalyptus jet fuel is shipped (650 km) from the mill to the largest Brazilian oil refinery (Replan-Petrobras in PaulÃ­nia, SP), and the blend with fossil jet fuel is consumed at airports in SÃ£o Paulo city (200 km from the oil refinery). Enzymes produced by Novozymes in AraucÃ¡ria (PR, Brazil) are shipped to the mill (800 km). We used four methods to account for co-products in the calculation of the carbon footprint of eucalyptus jet fuel: i. Displacement: co-products generate carbon emissions credits as they substitute for conventional products. Cogenerated electricity substitutes for power in the Brazilian electricity grid (70% hydropower, 11% natural gas, 8% biomass, 4% oil, 3% nuclear power, 3% coal, and 1% wind; EPE, 2014). Organosolv lignin substitutes for phenol (Wanmolee et al., 2016). Acetone replaces its fossil counterpart, and the ethanol recycled to organosolv pretreatment (makeup ethanol) substitutes for sugarcane ethanol. ii. Mass allocation: carbon emissions are proportional to the mass flow of each product. iii. Energy allocation: carbon emissions are proportional to the energy flow of each product based on the lower heating value [44.1 (jet fuel), 26.0 (organosolv lignin), and 29.6 (acetone) GJ/ton]. iv. Economic allocation: carbon emissions are proportional to the revenues of each product. In the mass, energy, and economic allocation methods, we considered that cogenerated electricity and recycled ethanol generate carbon emissions credits."
5,Multi-criteria analysis,"2.4 Multi-criteria analysis The three process options (EtOH, But, But-GMO) for jet fuel production were compared in a multi-criteria decision-making framework focused on economic and environmental performance, and competitiveness (Table 2 ). The environmental criterion is the carbon footprint abatement (Î”GWP). It measured reduction of carbon emissions (g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel) in relation to fossil jet fuel according to the displacement method. In the economic performance category, the NPV criterion measured the profitability of the project in case phase 2 (jet fuel plant) is implemented. For the calculation of the NPV, we used market prices for the alcohols during phase 1 (Table 1) and the minimum jet fuel selling price during phase 2. In contrast, the IRR-1 criterion is the IRR of the fallback plan in case phase 2 is not implemented. IRR-1 was incorporated into the decision-making process to account for the risk-averse profile of the pulp industry. The third economic criterion, the return on capital employed (ROCE), measured the efficiency of the investment considering the revenues from jet fuel and co-products (lignin and acetone). In the competitiveness category, the minimum selling price (MSP) of jet fuel is a parameter that shows decision makers the price premium (in relation to fossil jet fuel)that provides acceptable economic returns. As such, the higher the premium, the lower the competitiveness of renewable jet fuel. Other important competitiveness factor is the sensitivity of the margins of jet fuel production to uncertainties in costs of raw materials (including eucalyptus) and energy. In other words, the higher the ratio between EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) and production cost (ratio expressed in the RTMU criterion), more robust is the investment against market oscillations (Sanaei, 2014). The third competitiveness criterion (TR) measured technology risk. If either eucalyptus ethanol- or butanol-to-jet pathway performs not as expected at commercial scale (e.g. lower yields), it affects the minimum jet fuel selling price. While technology risks can be found across all process steps, the major difference between the process options is in the fermentation step. As a result, we developed a quantitative scale from 1 to 5 that considers the yeast-based fermentation in scenario EtOH less risky than the bacteria-based fermentation in scenario But. This classification was based on the fact that microbial contamination has been a major problem in industrial ABE fermentation facilities (Jones et al., 2000). The use of a genetically modified microorganism in scenario But-GMO was considered the riskier situation (Mariano, 2015b). For the multi-criteria decision analysis, we used a trade-off ranking method based on the Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) (Keeney and Raiffa, 1993). According to this method, the three process options were ranked in order of increasing overall utility values (Uj ): (1) U j = âˆ‘ u k Â· w k , with j = 1 , 2 , 3 , and k = 1 to 7 where j is the number of process options; uk is the utility function, a linear function that normalizes values of criterion k (Table 2) between 0 and 1; and wk is the weight of each criterion (0 â‰¤ wk â‰¤ 1; âˆ‘wk = 1). To calculate the weights, we adapted the trade-off method conducted by panels of decision makers reported by Sanaei (2014). The adaptation consisted of using Monte Carlo simulation instead of a panel of decision makers. The method has the following steps: Step 1: Definition of decision criterion. MSP was the decision criterion (k = 1; i.e. the criterion considered the most important) in all Monte Carlo iterations. Step 2: Calculation of utility values. For each process option, u2 to u7 were calculated using as bounds the respective worst (lower bound = 0) and best (upper bound = 1) criterion values found among the three process options. For iteration 1â€“5000: Step 3: Definition of target value. The target for MSP (i.e. threshold for investment) was randomly sampled from the interval 0.50 to 1.00 US$/l. The target gives the upper bound of the utility function of MSP (u1 = 1). The lower bound (zero) of u1 corresponds to the worst value of MSP among the process options. Step 4: Pair-wise comparison. The decision criterion (k = 1) was traded-off against the other criteria (k = 2â€“7). This step simulates how much panelists would be willing to compromise the target value to give the other criterion a utility value equal to 1. Therefore, in each of the 6 pair-wise comparisons, a percentage increase in MSP was randomly sampled from the interval 0 to 100%. Utility values of the adjusted MSP (u1,2 to u1,7 ) were calculated using u1 . Step 4: Calculation of weights. Weights were calculated by matrix multiplication: (2) 1 - u 1 , 2 - 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 - u 1 , 3 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 1 - u 1 , 4 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 1 - u 1 , 5 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 1 - u 1 , 6 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 1 - u 1 , 7 0 0 0 0 0 - 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 w 7 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Finally, to calculate Uj (Eq. (1) the utility value of MSP (u1 ) and w1 to w7 are the average values of distributions generated by the Monte Carlo simulation, and u2 to u7 are non-stochastic (calculated in step 3)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Economic analysis,"3.1 Economic analysis The economic analysis showed that eucalyptus jet fuel produced from either ethanol or butanol is not economically competitive with fossil jet fuel. The main reason is that the average wholesale price of fossil jet fuel in Brazil [0.43 US$/l or 13 US$/GJ in the period 2006â€“2015 (ANP, 2016)] is almost half the price of hydrous ethanol on energy basis (22 US$/GJ) and almost one third the price of butanol (34 US$/GJ). As a result, eucalyptus jet fuel must be priced at 2.10 (EtOH), 3.01 (But), and 2.08 (But-GMO) US$/l to ensure that the IRR of the project increases after the investment in phase 2. Accordingly, the investment in either the ethanol or butanol plant yields returns of 13â€“17% (IRR-1, Table 3 ), and the jet fuel MSP offers an improved IRR of 20%. However, the MSP of eucalyptus jet fuel is at least five times the price of fossil jet fuel. Consequently, the price paid by airlines would increase to more than 0.90 US$/l if eucalyptus jet fuel is mixed with fossil jet fuel at a volumetric ratio of 30:70. This is the maximum blending ratio approved by ASTM International in the case of the ATJ pathway. Therefore, the economic success of the investment in the alcohol conversion step (phase 2) depends on policy incentive and price premium. Nevertheless, that condition is not exclusive to eucalyptus jet fuel. For example, the jet fuel MSP was estimated to be about 1.00 US$/l if produced from either wheat straw-based butanol or corn stover-based ethanol (Atsonios et al., 2015). However, this price gives an IRR of 10%. Note that the IRR target in the present study cannot be 10% because this value is lower than IRR-1 (Table 3). But for the sake of comparison, the MSP of eucalyptus jet fuel for an IRR target of 10% is lower than one dollar per liter: 0.90 (EtOH), 0.94 (But), and 0.72 (But-GMO) US$/l. Other studies also considered an IRR target of 10%, and the MSP was above 1.00 US$/l in most of the cases. For example, Michailos (2018) estimated that the MSP of jet fuel produced from sugarcane bagasse (sugars-to-jet pathway) is 2.78 US$/l. Diederichs et al. (2016) found MSP values of 2.54 US$/kg (1.90 US$/l) and 2.22 US$/kg (1.66 US$/l) for jet fuel produced from sugarcane juice (ATJ pathway) and vegetable oil (hydroprocessing pathway), respectively. For an IRR target of 15%, Bann et al. (2017) found MSP values between 0.91 and 2.78 US$/l for different feedstock (in order of increasing MSP: used cooking oil, tallow, municipal solid waste, soybean oil, sugarcane, corn stover, corn grain, woody biomass, and herbaceous biomass). Interestingly, although the cited studies considered different assumptions and technologies, they agree that renewable jet fuel cannot compete with its fossil counterpart on price basis. Despite that, eucalyptus can be considered competitive among other renewable sources. The need for incentive and premium programs can decrease under certain conditions. However, the goal of exceeding the IRR of the alcohol plant keeps the selling price of eucalyptus jet fuel still above the market price. Focusing on scenario EtOH (MSP = 2.10 US$/l for an IRR of 20%), the following examples show how the selling price could decrease: (1) MSP decreases to 1.39 US$/l (variation of 33%) if the IRR target is 15%, which is still advantageous to the project; (2) if the capital investment of phase 1 decreases from 5.4 (calculated value) to 2.5 US$/gal ethanol capacity, IRR-1 is 24%. The MSP decreases to 1.95 US$/l (variation of 7%) for an IRR target of 30%; (3) should the lignin price increase from 520 to 650 US$/t, the MSP decreases to 1.90 US$/l (variation of 9%). However, for prices above 1100 US$/t, IRR-1 exceeds 20% and the MSP must be greater than 2.10 US$/l to improve the economic returns of the project; (4) if the selling of lignin starts in the first year of ethanol production, IRR-1 is 21% (Fig. 3 a) and the MSP decreases to 1.23 US$/l (variation of 41%) (Fig. 3b). However, the production of jet fuel does not improve the IRR of the project; (5) if the project is executed in a single phase and the selling of lignin starts in the 3rd year of operation, the MSP could decrease to 1.44 US$/l (variation of 31%) and the IRR of the project would still improve from 16% to 20%. Nonetheless, the single-phase project is riskier and less effective than only aiming an IRR target lower than 20%. In fact, the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the IRR target is the variable that most affects the jet fuel MSP (Fig. 4 ). The sensitivity analysis also showed that technical and economic parameters related to phase 1 are more important than those of phase 2. The investment cost of phase 1 accounts for 75â€“85% of the total expenditure; furthermore, 60â€“70% of the operating costs are associated with eucalyptus and enzymes (Table 4 ). Thus, we considered only variables related to phase 1 in the Monte Carlo risk analysis. The risk analysis showed that the most probable IRR-1 values are 10% (probability IRR-1 > 20% = 0.5%, EtOH), 12% (prob. = 3%, But), and 15% (prob. = 13%, But-GMO). And when the second phase is implemented, the risk analysis showed that the probability is small that the jet fuel MSP will be lower than 2.00 US$/l for an IRR target of 20%. The most probable values are 2.97 (probability MSP < 2.00 = 7%, EtOH), 3.89 (prob. = 4%, But), and 2.69 US$/l (prob. = 21%, But-GMO). In contrast, the most probable MSP drops to 1.90 US$/l (prob. MSP < 2.00 = 60%, EtOH) when the IRR target for scenario EtOH is 15%. Moreover, the probability is low (10%) that IRR-1 will exceed 15%. Therefore, the risk analysis shows that there is a higher chance that the ethanol pathway can be more competitive than the butanol pathway. The competition ethanol versus butanol pathway is also affected by advances towards hyper-producing butanol microorganisms. By suppressing the production of co-products (acetone and ethanol) and increasing the butanol yield to 0.40, IRR-1 (But-GMO) increases from 17.4% to 20%. Consequently, the jet fuel MSP should increase by 13% (from 2.08 to 2.36 US$/l) to yield an IRR of 25%. Thus, suppression of acetone production in the current context is not interesting because its price (35 US$/GJ) exceeds almost three times the price of jet fuel. These results and other studies (Pereira et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2018) also suggest that developments by companies such as Gevo (CO, USA) towards the homofermentative production (i.e. single-product production) of iso-butanol by yeasts and its conversion to jet fuel is possibly economically attractive only under government policy scenarios. Technological advances related to the organosolv pretreatment also need attention. If the recovery of hemicellulose is improved, additional 10 t/h xylose could be sent to the butanol fermentation, for example. As a result, the IRR-1 of scenario But-GMO increases to 24%, and the jet fuel MSP should increase by 39% (from 2.08 to 2.90 US$/l) to secure an IRR of 30%. Thus, a better recovery of hemicellulose creates competitive advantage for the ethanol pathway because it improves the economic returns from the butanol plant (phase 1), thereby affecting negatively the MSP of butanol-based jet fuel. In contrast, any additional supply of xylose in scenario EtOH does not affect the jet fuel MSP because the conventional S. cerevisiae cannot convert this sugar. Alternatively, the hemicellulose stream could be anaerobically digested to produce biogas and cut energy costs. However, the investment cost we estimated for a digestion unit (15 MMUS$) is three times the break-even point (5 MMUS$) below which the jet fuel MSP lowers. In fact, the MSP increases by 5%âˆ’7% across the three scenarios if the estimated investment value is considered. Therefore, the anaerobic digestion of the hemicellulose stream seems not to be economically advantageous."
8,Carbon footprint assessment,"3.2 Carbon footprint assessment The organosolv pretreatment also affects the competition ethanol versus butanol with regards to carbon footprint. One aspect related to this technology is the co-product organosolv lignin. However, its effect on the competition was negligible. Lignin generates emissions credit as a substitute for phenol (Fig. 5 a), but the credit is offset by the reduced production of cogenerated electricity. It decreased by 15 (EtOH), 18 (But), and 20 (But-GMO) MW. In contrast, the makeup ethanol for the organosolv pretreatment had strong effect on the competition. The annual demand for ethanol is 13,600 t/y (or 8.4 MMUS$/y), and its on-site supply in scenario EtOH cuts emissions by 18 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel. Conversely, in the butanol pathway the major fraction of the makeup [62% (But), 81% (But-GMO)] is sugarcane ethanol purchased from the market. As a result, the makeup in this case is responsible for emissions of 7 (But) and 13 (But-GMO) g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel (given by the difference between makeup ethanol and recycled ethanol in Fig. 5a). Thus, the self-sufficiency in ethanol used as makeup for the organosolv pretreatment is crucial to make the ethanol pathway slightly more efficient in terms of carbon emissions. In fact, the difference in carbon emissions between scenarios EtOH and But is small because the latter benefits from emissions credit from the co-product acetone according to the displacement method. The credit from acetone alone (37 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel) exceeds by 30% the total emissions credits (from recycled ethanol, and lignin) of the ethanol pathway. Acetone, along with the makeup ethanol, also explains why the emissions of scenario But-GMO are higher than those of scenario But: the acetone output of the GM Clostridium strain is 20% lower (or a difference of 5100 t/y) than that of the regular strain. Indeed, while in scenario But the ratio between emissions credits and emissions is 0.7, in scenario But-GMO the ratio is 0.3. Nonetheless, the effect of the acetone on the carbon footprint of the butanol pathway becomes less important when the carbon emissions are calculated by the mass, energy, and economic allocation methods (Fig. 5b). According to the economic allocation method, the carbon emissions of scenarios But and But-GMO are practically the same, 38 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel. It is explained by two factors: (i) the difference in emissions between the two scenarios is small (6%) prior to the adjustment for revenues; and, (ii) jet fuel accounts for 63% of the total revenues in both scenarios (Table 4). Overall, the mass, energy, and economic allocation methods reinforce the conclusion that the ethanol pathway is more efficient with regards to carbon footprint. Moreover, if compared with sugarcane, eucalyptus jet fuel can be considered competitive as far as CO2 emissions are concerned. Based on the ethanol pathway, the carbon emissions of eucalyptus jet fuel are 85â€“93% (depending on the allocation method) lower than the emissions of fossil jet fuel (Fig. 5b). Although contextual differences and methodological choices make it difficult to compare the findings of different LCA studies, that level of reduction is similar to values (71%âˆ’85%) reported for sugarcane jet fuel (ethanol pathway) by Staples et al. (2014) and Jong et al. (2017). Despite that, if jet fuel produced from either eucalyptus- or sugarcane-based ethanol is mixed (30/70 blend) with fossil jet fuel, the aviation industry will only be able to cut their carbon emissions by values below their target of 50%. Such target requires a renewable jet fuel with negative carbon footprint (âˆ’55 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel), but the positive carbon emissions of eucalyptus jet fuel (6.7 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel) restricts the reduction toa maximum of 28%. Although still important, the reduction comes at a high price. The market price (0.43 US$/l) increases by 0.02 US$/l for each 1% reduction in carbon emissions. From another perspective, the carbon credits should be worth 625 US$/t CO2 eq. to decrease the selling price of eucalyptus jet fuel from 2.10 to 0.43 US$/l (or 360 US$/t CO2 eq. for an IRR target of 15% and MSP of 1.39 US$/l). Because of the high price level for the carbon credits, it could be argued that the long distance (650 km) between the pulp mill and the oil refinery is a disadvantage of the eucalyptus jet fuel. The Central-West region of Brazil, where the pulp mill is located, is an area of expansion of the eucalyptus pulp industry because of low land prices and government incentives (Mariano, 2015a). In contrast, most of the sugarcane mills are in SÃ£o Paulo state and closer to the oil refinery. In fact, the transport of eucalyptus jet fuel and enzymes accounts for 35% of the carbon emissions in scenario EtOH; and, if these emissions are hypothetically eliminated, the carbon footprint decreases from 6.7 to âˆ’5.5 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel. However, this variation has small impact on the carbon emissions of the 30/70 blend. They decrease from 63 to 60 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel, and the desired price of carbon credits decreases by 13% (from 625 to 543 US$/t CO2 eq.). While the desired price is still unrealistic, the more competitive price of eucalyptus in the area of the mill site can arguably compensate for the higher carbon emissions and increased freight costs."
9,Multi-criteria analysis,"3.3 Multi-criteria analysis The ethanol pathway outperforms the butanol pathway in four (ROCE, RTMU, TR, Î”GWP) out of seven criteria (Table 3). And even though the jet fuel MSP of scenario EtOH is not the most competitive, the ethanol pathway presents the best overall utility value (Fig. 6 ). The choice for the ethanol pathway rather than scenario But is clearly given by the difference in the jet fuel MSP. With regards to scenario But-GMO, the advantage of scenario EtOH is given by TR, Î”GWP, and three criteria (ROCE, RTMU, NPV) that depend on the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). As expressed by the higher value of IRR-1, the EBIT of scenario But-GMO (99 MMUS$/y) exceeds the EBIT values of scenarios EtOH (66 MMUS$/y) and But (77 MMUS$/y) during phase 1 of the project. This advantage allows scenario But-GMO to have a more competitive jet fuel MSP, but at the expense of having the lowest EBIT during phase 2 [149 (EtOH), 156 (But), and 138 MMUS$/y]. Scenario But-GMO also has the least attractive investment cost (Table 4) and highest cost of raw materials and energy [74 (EtOH), 77 (But), and 83 MMUS$/y]. Consequently, the utility values of ROCE, RTMU, and NPV are zero for scenario But-GMO. This confirms that the variation of IRR from 17.4% (for the butanol plant only) to 20% (if butanol is converted to jet fuel) found in scenario But-GMO is the least attractive. Therefore, although the butanol pathway can offer a small advantage in terms of minimum jet fuel selling price, the multi-criteria analysis shows that the ethanol pathway is more promising. Moreover, although the butanol plant with a GMO provides the best economic returns (IRR-1) in case the alcohol-to-jet step is not implemented, this advantage was not enough to rank this alternative above scenario But. The main reason was the combination of lower technology risk and carbon emissions in scenario But, as demonstrated by running the multi-criteria analysis without TR and the Î”GWP criterion (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the lower IRR-1 of scenario But also allows for a more competitive jet fuel MSP. For instance, if jet fuel is priced at 2.08 US$/l (same price as in scenario But-GMO), IRR is 16.3% and phase 2 still improves the economic returns of the project. For that reason, hyper-producing butanol microorganisms should be preferentially reserved for single-phase projects focused on butanol production."
10,Conclusions,"Eucalyptus jet fuel produced from either ethanol or butanol cannot compete with fossil jet fuel on price basis. Nevertheless, eucalyptus jet fuel is competitive in the renewable market, especially if derived from ethanol. The ethanol production based on the organosolv pretreatment generates lower returns (IRR = 13%) than butanol produced by genetically engineered microorganisms with enhanced yield (IRR = 17.4%). This allows the ethanol-based jet fuel to be priced at 1.39 US$/l and the IRR of the project still increases to 15%. In contrast, if derived from butanol the price must be 2.08 US$/l to secure an IRR of 20%. The ethanol pathway also has a lower carbon footprint (6.7 against 24.6 g CO2 eq./MJ jet fuel). However, only unrealistic carbon prices above 360 US$/t CO2 could make eucalyptus jet fuel be competitive with fossil jet fuel."
