0,Introduction,"Producing green and renewable hydrogen energy from water by using photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) water splitting strategies have received extensive attention [1]. The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the PC and/or PEC catalysis highly depends on the intrinsic properties and structures of the semiconductor-based photocatalysts and photoelectrodes [2,3]. One dimensional (1D) metal oxide semiconductor nanoarrays photocatalytic film, which usually grows on transparent conductive substrate, is considered to be one of the most appropriate candidates either as photoelectrode in PEC systems and/or as free-stranding photocatalyst in PC systems [4–6]. Because the vertically 1D ordered nanostructure can provide direct electrons diffusion pathways that can facilitate electron transport and suppress the charge recombination [7–10]. However, compared to stereotyped nanoparticles materials, the 1D nanoarrays photocatalysts have small surface areas and limited reactive sites [11–13]. Therefore, in recent years, branching the 1D nanoarrays with others nanostructures to form novel three dimensional (3D) photocatalytic films has attracted great attention. Such a 3D branched photocatalytic film is expected to possess larger surface area by increasing the surface-to-volume ratios, and it can also improve the light absorption capability caused by the scattering effect [14–16]. For example, Zheng et al. proved that, under a 380 nm monochromatic light irradiation, the branched TiO2 nanorods arrays (NRs) exhibited nearly two times higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) than that of pure TiO2 NRs [11]. Mao et al. demonstrated 3D ZnO nanoforest had better electrical conductivity and improved light absorption performance than that of pure ZnO NRs [17]. However, most of the previous reported 3D branched nanostructures usually share the same composition between the branches and the fundamental 1D nanoarrays, induced by the mismatched lattice surface between different crystal structure. Thus, the intrinsic drawbacks of these photocatalysts (such as the limited light absorption ranges of TiO2 or ZnO) are still unsolved. To address these problems, many groups have proposed that combining these 3D branched photocatalysts film with other small band gap semiconductors to form 3D branched heterogeneous photocatalytic films is an advisable strategy to further improve the PEC or PC hydrogen production efficiency. For example, Gong et al. sensitized the typical branched TiO2 nanoarrays with CdS quantum dots, which remarkably enhanced the photocurrent density to 3.98 mA cm−2 (at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl) under solar light irradiation (300 W xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter). Rao et al. used CdS/CdSe co-sensitized branched anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays and received a 4.2% photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In our previous reports, we also synthesized 3D branched TiO2 NRs (B–TiO2 NRs) and CdS/H-3D-TiO2/Pt-wire photocatalysis systems to investigate their visible-light driven H2 evolution property, respectively [18,19]. Moreover, by using branched TiO2 nanorods film (B–TiO2 NRs) and CdS loaded B–TiO2 NRs as photocatalytic film, we firstly revealed how the cocatalyst loading position affect the PC hydrogen production property of the film-like photocatalysts [20]. Nevertheless, according to earlier reports and our recent works, it is worth noting that most of the 3D branched heterogeneous photocatalytic films are usually synthesized through a relatively complex synthetic procedure, which directly resulted in slow kinetic processes and great power density losses. In addition, the presence of visible light responsive semiconductors is crucial for exploring the potential capability of these heterojunction photocatalytic films, but their loading amount is limited by the finite surface-to-volume ratios of the 3D branched structures. Therefore, the development of new strategies to reasonable design and fabricate novel 3D branches heterojunction photocatalytic film with optimal composition and abundant exposing surfaces are expected to further enhance their solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency for either PEC or PC water splitting. In this work, for the first time, we synthesized a novel rods-on-rods heterojunction 3D branched nanoarrays photocatalytic film, in which CdS nanorods were directly grown on the 1D TiO2 nanorod arrays forming the 3D branched nanoarrays. By simply controlling the alcohol/water ratio during the synthesized procedure, the surface-to-volume ratios of the CdS nanorods can be easily adjusted. The novel CdS branched TiO2 nanoarrays photocatalytic film (denote as CBT) exhibits several advantages: (i) the unique 1D/1D rods-on-rods structure combining with the intimated connection between CdS nanorods and TiO2 nanorods facilitate the charge separation and transmission; (ii) the controllable surface-to-volume ratios of CdS nanobranches ensure that sufficient surfaces can be exposed to the electrolyte solution, thus increased the active reaction sites; (iii) possessing an open structure, the largely increased loading amount of visible light responsive CdS nanobranches enhance both the solar light scattering and absorption properties. These synergistic effects enable the 3D CdS nanorods branched TiO2 nanorod nanoarrays film to be a high-performance photocatalyst in PEC hydrogen production. Furthermore, we also propose a ‘cocatalysts-separated-loading’ strategy to form a self-bias photocatalytic film, which has been demonstrated to be an efficient solution to further improve the PC hydrogen production property of such film-like photocatalysts. As a result, this 3D rods-on-rods CdS branched TiO2 nanoarrays photocatalytic film exhibits advantageous efficiency and stability in both PEC and self-bias PC hydrogen production systems."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of TiO2 nanorod arrays,"2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanorod arrays TiO2 nanorods arrays were synthesized on the FTO glass substrate via hydrothermal process. In a typical procedure, concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5–38 wt% HCl) was first mixed with distilled water in the volume ratio of 1 : 1, then 0.8 mL of titanium butoxide was added into 30 mL of the mixed solution under stirring. After stirring for 3 min, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and a pre-cleaned FTO (3 × 6 cm2) substrate was placed at an angle against the Teflon-lined with conducting side facing down. In this process, keeping half of the FTO substrate immerged in the synthesis solution, so that the TiO2 nanorod arrays could only grow on one half (3 × 3 cm2) of the FTO substrate, while leaving the other half of FTO substrate vacant. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 180 °C for 7 h in an oven. Then, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the obtained samples were washed with flowing water and dried in air."
3,Preparation of CdS branched TiO2 nanorod arrays,"2.2 Preparation of CdS branched TiO2 nanorod arrays The CdS nanorods branches were grown on the as-prepared TiO2 nanorods arrays by another hydrothermal treatment. Briefly, distilled water and absolute ethanol with different water volume ratios from 0% to 100% were prepared, then Cd(NO3)2, thiourea and glutathione (GSH) were added into the solution with the concentration of 20 mM, 20 mM and 8 mM, respectively. Then, 30 mL of the mixture solution was transferred into a clean 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and a piece of above treated FTO glass was placed with the as-prepared TiO2 nanorods arrays part immerged in the growth solution. the Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave was kept at 210 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained sample was taken out and rinsed with distilled water. According to the ratio of distilled water in the reaction solution, the CdS branched TiO2 nanorod arrays were named as CBT-x (x indicates the percentage of deionized water in the reaction solution)."
4,Syntheses of self-bias CBT-x photocatalytic films and the compared traditional photocatalytic film,"2.3 Syntheses of self-bias CBT-x photocatalytic films and the compared traditional photocatalytic film The self-bias CBT-x photocatalytic films were synthesized by a cocatalysts-separated-loading strategy. In a typical processor, the sampled part of the as-prepared CBT-x films were firstly wrapped by Teflon tapes, and then Pt nanoparticles were loaded on the vacant part of FTO substrate by ion beam sputtering deposition (IBSD) method. The IBSD were performed on a Sputter Coater (Q150T Quorum Technologies), using Ar+ ion beam (1.0 KeV, 0.3 mA/cm−2). The deposition time was kept at 60 s, during the sputtering process, the chamber was kept at a constant pressure (3 × 10−2 Pa), and the ion beam intensity was up to 10 mA. For comparison, in the synthesis of traditional Pt loaded photocatalytic films, the vacant part of FTO substrate were wrapped by Teflon tapes, so that the Pt nanoparticles could be spurted on the CdS branched TiO2 samples. Then same operation procedures were performed as above."
5,Material characterization,"2.4 Material characterization The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, D/max 2500 v/pc), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Philips FEI Quanta 200 FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (JEOL- 2010 microscope operated at 200 kV). A Shimadzu spectrophotometer (model 2501 PC) equipped with an integrating sphere was used to record the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a VG ESCALAB250 surface analysis system using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (300 W, 5 mA, and 15 kV). The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The shift of the binding energy owing to relative surface charging was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a LS 50B (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical measurements of the samples were measured by using an electrochemical analyzer (BAS100 Instruments) in a standard three-electrodes system by using the samples (1 cm2) as the working electrode, a Pt flake as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. A 300 W Xe-lamp served as a light source, which was placed 15 cm away from the electrode. Linear sweep voltammograms and photocurrent testes were carried out at −0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO3 and 0.5 M Na2S solution under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5) illumination. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the samples in the three-electrode system were recorded via a computer controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV under same condition in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. Mott-Schottky plots were carried out at an AC frequency of 1 kHz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under dark condition."
7,Photocatalytic H2 generation experiments,"2.6 Photocatalytic H2 generation experiments Photocatalytic H2 generation was carried out in a Lab Solar H2 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system (Perfect light, Beijing) including a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech). In a typical reaction, a piece of 3 × 6 cm2 CBT-x film was placed in a Pyrex glass reactor containing 100 mL of 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 mixed solution. Then, the system was sealed in vacuum to keep the pressure at −0.1 MPa. Afterwards, a circular cooling water system was turned on and the reactor was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 filter. The gases were analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, TCD, Ar as carrier gas)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Morphology and structure of CdS branched TiO2 nanoarrays,"3.1 Morphology and structure of CdS branched TiO2 nanoarrays The morphology evolution process of the CBT-x samples was investigated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) firstly. As shown in Fig. 1 A, pure TiO2 nanorods with diameters range from 300 to 500 nm were grown on FTO substrate after the first hydrothemal process, and these TiO2 nanorods exhibited smooth and clean surfaces. For the growth of CdS branches, as shown in Fig. 1B, when the synthesis solution was pure ethanol, it is found that there are merely numbers of small nanoparticles covered on the surface of TiO2 nanorods. With volume rate of water/ethanal increased to 30% in the growth solution, the TiO2 nanorods are fully covered with agminated nanoparticles (Fig. 1C). Further increasing the water percentages to 50%, interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1D, the TiO2 nanorods are covered by a large amount of short nanorods branches. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping reveals that these nanobranches are composed of CdS nanorods with 50 nm in diameter and approximately ∼100 nm in length. Moreover, according to Fig. 1E and F, the density and surface-to-volume ratios of CdS nanobranches are obviously increased along with the additional water/ethanal rate over 50% percentages. Especially for the CBT-100 sample, the length-diameter ratio of CdS branches have been reached about 300–400 nm vs 60 nm. It is worth declaring that these CdS nanorods branched TiO2 nanoarrays catalytic films are significantly different from the previous reports CdS–TiO2 samples [21–29], as the directly connections between these CdS nanorods on TiO2 nanorods structures are theoretically favorable for the photogenerated charges migration and transportation, during to the axial transmission characteristics of the electrons on 1D nanomaterials. Moreover, with the branched open structures and controllable surface-to-volume ratios of CdS nanorods, our synthesized photocatalytic films exhibit great potential to improve the utilization efficiency of the incident scattered light in per unit area. The phase purity and structure of the hydrothermal samples were further characterized by XRD measurement. As shown in Fig. 2 A, except for the character diffraction peaks of FTO and rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays (JCPDS: 21–1276), for the CBT-x samples, the other diffraction peaks at 24.8°, 26.5° and 28.2° are consistent well with the (100), (002) and (101) facets of hexagonal greenockite phase CdS (JCPDS: 41–1049). Moreover, the peak intensities of CdS gradually increased from CBT-0 to CBT-100, indicating that the content of CdS in per unit area increased with the increase water percentages in the synthetic solution. The purities of our prepared samples were also proved, since there are no other uncertain peaks appeared. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were acquired to further reveal the composition and chemical valence status of the as-prepared sample. The XPS survey spectrum of CBT-50 demonstrates the presence of Ti, O, Cd, and S (Fig. 2B). In the Ti 2p high resolution spectrum (Fig. 2C), two strong peaks at around 458.6 and 464.3 eV can be respectively attributed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+ in TiO2. In Fig. 2D, the O 1s spectra can be de-convoluted into two peaks at 529.7eV and 531.6 eV, which are related to the crystal lattice oxygen of Ti–O (OL) and the surface adsorbed hydroxyl group (OC), respectively [30]. The Cd 3d peaks locating at 405.0 eV and 411.7 eV (Fig. 2E), together with the binding peaks of S 2p3/2 (161.4 eV) and S 2p1/2 (162.5 eV), which have the similar peaks position to previously reported CdS materials [31,32], further verify the existence of CdS in the CBT-50. These XRD and XPS analyses combining with the SEM and TEM results strongly confirm that the 1D/1D CdS nanorods branched TiO2 nanorod arrays catalytic films have been successfully synthesized on FTO conductive substance by a very simple tow-step hydrothermal procedure."
10,Growth mechanism,"3.2 Growth mechanism According to the preparation process and the characterization results, the formation mechanism of the CBT-x nanorod arrays were well investigated. As clearly shown in Fig. 3 , the CBT-x samples were synthesized without any other reaction parameters changed except for controlling the water/alcohol ratio from 0% to 100%, during the second hydrothermal process. Thus, it seems that the alterable water/alcohol ratio directly results in the formation of CBT-x samples. However, here we need to point it out that the intrinsic changing glutathione (GSH) solubility should take the leading responsibility for the formation of different surface-to-volume ratios CdS nanorods: Firstly, the GSH mainly plays two key roles in our synthesis system. On one hand, using as a typical capping agent for the synthesis of 1D CdS nanorods, the synergetic effect of the thiol and dicarboxyl groups in GSH can efficiently shape CdS into nanorod structures [33,34]. On the other hand, the GSH here also acts as a crosslinking agent to anchor the CdS nanorods on TiO2, as the dicarboxyl groups in GSH can be easily absorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanorods [35]; Secondly, due to the presence of lipophobic thiol and the dicarboxyl groups in GSH, in our synthesis systems, the changing water/alcohol ratio affects the solubility of GSH in the CdS grown solution. As a result, for the CBT-0 sample, the growth of the CdS crystal was hardly affected by the GSH because only few of the GSH dissolved in the absolute ethyl-alcohol solution. Therefore, most of the CdS remain the irregular particle shape and only few CdS particles are anchored on the TiO2 nanorods. While, increasing with the water/alcohol ratio, the dissolution of GSH is increased, thus, more GSH selectively adsorbs on the low-index faces of CdS nanocrystals [34], and facilitate the formation of 1D CdS nanorods which directly grow on the surface of TiO2 nanorods, forming the novel 1D/1D CdS nanorods branched TiO2 nanoarrays structure."
11,Photoelectrochemical catalytic (PEC) activity,"3.3 Photoelectrochemical catalytic (PEC) activity The PEC performance of the CBT-x samples was carried out in a three-electrodes system, using Na2S and Na2SO3 mixed solution as the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were firstly measured by varying the applied bias. In the potential window from −1.2–0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the pure TiO2 NRAs shows a relatively low photo-response with only few hundred milliamps photocurrent density under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight irradiation. While upon introduction of the CdS branches, the photocurrent densities of CBT-x samples increase obviously and the CBT-50 achieves the highest photocurrent density of ∼4.2 mA cm−2 at the sweep range of −0.8 V to −0.4 V. However, with more CdS nanorods branched on the TiO2 nanoarrays, take the CBT-70 and CBT-100 as examples, the photocurrent density decreases again. The notable broad peaks at around −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl recorded in each LSV curve were attributed to the oxidation of sulfide in the electrolyte during the photoelectrochemical process [36]. Moreover, the applied bias photo to current conversion efficiency (ABPE) of the as-synthesized samples were calculated in Fig. 4B, according to the following Equ. 1 [37,38]. (1) ABPE ( η ) = | J ph ( m A c m − 2 ) | × ( ( 1.23 − |V b | ) ( V ) ) P total ( m W c m − 2 ) × 100 % where the Jph and Vb are the photoinduced current density and the corresponding applied bias (vs. NHE), respectively, both of which can be observed from the LSV results, and Ptotal is the power density of the illumination. Accordingly, the CBT-50 photoelectrode reaches a maximum photon to current conversion efficiency with the best ABPE value of ∼1.5%. The transient photocurrent measurement records that CBT-50 sample has the best photoelectric performance with a photocurrent density of 4.21 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V bias (vs. Ag/AgCl). Fig. 4C and D shows the PEC stability of this photoelectrode, and it can be seen that the corresponding transient photocurrent density of the CBT-50 remains stable over a long time period (Fig. 4D). We further investigated the photoresponse capability of CBT-x photoelectrodes under different monochromatic light irradiation from the UV to visible light region. As shown in Fig. 4E, the CBT-50 has the highest photocurrent density of 1.23 mA cm−2 under the 450 nm wavelength light irradiation, and it still maintains a weak photocurrent response under 550 nm wavelength light irradiation (∼0.1 mA cm−2). The wavelength-dependent incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated using the following Equ. 2 [39]. (2) IPCE ( % ) = 1240 × J λ ( m A · c m − 2 ) λ ( n m ) × P λ ( m W · c m − 2 ) × 100 % where λ is the wavelength of the irradiated monochromatic light, Pλ is the monochromatic light intensity and Jλ is the photocurrent density under corresponding λ. According to the data in Fig. 4E, the calculated IPCE of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4F. Obviously, compared with pure TiO2 NRAs, the CBT-x samples increased the photon to electron conversion efficiency in both UV and visible light region, and the CBT-50 exhibits the maximum IPCE of approximately 34% under 450 nm wavelength light irradiation. In addition, the IPCE spectra also reveals that the enchantment of photo-responded activity for CBT-x samples is mainly induced by the introduction of CdS specials, as the main part of IPCE peak located in the visible light region. Under 0.1V applied bias (vs Ag/AgCl) and solar light irradiation, the PEC H2 production rates were also measured, as shown in Figs. S1A and S1B, CBT-50 photoanode exhibited an expected highest H2 of 51.6 μmol cm−2 h−1 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 95.6%."
12,Self-bias photocatalytic (PC) H2 production property,"3.4 Self-bias photocatalytic (PC) H2 production property Encouraged by our previous report, in this work, we used a ‘cocatalysts-separated-loading’ strategy to prepare a self-bias photocatalytic system to investigate the PC H2 production properties of CBT-x samples (see the experiment section) [20]. The photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of all the samples was evaluated in a consecutive 4-h reaction under visible light irradiation, using a 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 mixed aqueous solution as hole sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 5 A, all the synthesized samples exhibit relatively stable PC H2 production rates, and the CBT-50 sample exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate of 11.9 μmol cm−2 h−1 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, from Fig. 5C, it is found that after four reaction cycles, the average H2 production rate of CBT-50 sample can still maintain at 10.5 μmol cm−2 h−1. This result demonstrates the favorable photostability of this kind of 1D/1D CdS nanorods branched TiO2 nanoarrays photocatalyst. Besides, a contrast test was further carried out via controlling the load position of co-catalysis Pt, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5D. Obviously, with the cocatalysts Pt nanoparticles directly loaded on the surface of CdS nanorods, the formatted photocatalyst (denote as traditional model) only has a ∼5.5 μmol cm−2 h−1 hydrogen production rate, which is just about as half PC activity as the established self-bias photocatalyst film. This phenomenon was also found in our previous work, which can be attributed to the ion mobility properties in the conductive Na2SO4 and Na2S mixed solution [20]."
13,Discussion about the PEC and PC mechanisms,"3.5 Discussion about the PEC and PC mechanisms Based on the above results, such unique 1D/1D rods-on-rods CdS branched TiO2 nanoarrays can be used as both photocatalytic anode and self-bias photocatalytic film in either PEC and PC hydrogen production systems. Moreover, as far as we know, the PEC and PC properties of our synthesized CBT-50 sample is much better than that of most of previously reported CdS modified TiO2 film-like photocatalysts, as shown in Table S1, S2 and S3 (Supplementary Material). The photocatalytic charge separation and transmission process in these two systems are respectively illustrated in Fig. 6 . It is well known that CdS can generate photogenerated electron-hole pairs spontaneously under visible light illumination. Based on the classical charge carrier transport routes in CdS–TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst, the photogenerated electrons would like to transport from CdS to TiO2 through their heterojunction, as the conductive bands (CB) of TiO2 is much lower than that of CdS. Thus, in the PEC hydrogen production system, under the effect of external electric field caused by the applied bias, these electrons are further transmitted to the Pt counter electrode through the conductive FTO layer and the external circuit, and then take part in the H+ reduce reaction. In the meantime, the lifted holes on the valence bands of CdS nanorods are consumed by the sacrificial agent (Fig. 6A). In the PC hydrogen production system, a similar charge transfer process as in the PEC system takes placed with the self-bias instead of additional applied potential. Specially, it is worth to note that according to the PEC and PC performance measurand results, all the CBT-30, CBT-50, CBT-70 and CBT-100 samples exhibited much higher catalytic activities than that of CBT-0 sample. This phenomenon demonstrates that the unique 1D/1D rods-on-rods structure efficiently accelerates the charges separation and electrons transport properties. But there is still an unsolved scientific problem that is why the surface-to-volume ratios and the loading amount of CdS specials in CBT-70 and CBT-100 are obviously larger than that in the CBT-50 sample, while the PEC and PC performance of these two samples are decreased comparing with that of CBT-50. To further research the intrinsic photocatalytic mechanism, the optical properties of light harvesting and absorption efficiency (LHE and η abs ), as well as charge separation efficiency (η sep ) for all the synthesized samples were investigated (calculation details were given in the Supporting Information) [40,41]. Fig. 7 A displays the UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, it can be seen that pure TiO2 nanorod arrays exhibits a typical absorption range with the peak edge lasting to 410 nm. For the CBT-x samples, there are another absorbtion peaks appeared at around 500 nm, which can be attributed to the introduction of CdS nanobranches. According to the light absorption intensity in Fig. 7A, the wavelength dependent LHE of the photoanodes were calculated and displayed in Fig. 7B. Therefore, associated the LHE spectra with the calculated theoretical maximum water oxidation photocurrent (J max, Table S4) for the CBT-x samples under the AM 1.5 solar light illumination (Fig. S3), the η abs for all the measurement photoanodes were determined in Fig. 7C. Obviously, the above results reveal that the light adsorbtion capacities for the CBT-x samples are increased along with the increasing content of CdS nanobranches. Although the increasing CdS nanobranches effectively enhance the visible light absorbtion properties of CBT-x samples, the PEC and PC properties of CBT-70 and CBT-100 are decreased comparing with CBT-50. Therefore, there must be some other reasons for the highest catalytic property of CBT-50 sample. The light absorption and charge separation efficiencies (η abs × η sep ) were further calculated based on the practical photocurrent (Fig. 4A) and the J max. As shown in Fig. 7D and E, both the η abs × η sep and the corresponding η sep spectra demonstrated that the CBT-50 has the highest charge separation efficiency. This result was further confirmed by photoluminescence measurement (PL) as shown in Fig. 7F. With all the samples excited by a 400 nm monochromatic light, the emission spectrum of TiO2 nanoarrays exhibits two emission peaks at 364 and 466 nm, which can be corresponded to the transition of self-trapped excitons and oxygen vacancies of TiO2, respectively [42,43]. And the introduction of CdS branches brings a new emission peak at around 530 nm for the CBT-x samples, which can be assigned to the near band edge emission arising from the recombination of the excited electron-hole pairs [44]. Moreover, all the emission peak intensities of TiO2 and CdS in CBT-x samples decrease significantly, indicating an efficient separation of the photoexcited electrons and holes caused by CdS–TiO2 heterostructures. Thus, it can be concluded that the highest charge separation efficiency of CBT-50 should take the main responsibility for its excellent PEC and PC performances. As both photocatalytic oxidation reaction in PEC and self-bias PC hydrogen production systems were all take place on the surface of CdS nanorods branches, we further investigated the interface properties and the charge transfer kinetics of the various CBT-x samples by Mott–Schottky (M − S) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The M − S plots were carried out to estimate the carrier density of samples in 0.5 M Na2SO4 under dark condition. In Fig. 8 A, the positive slope in the Mott-Schottky plots for all the samples suggest their n-type semiconductor assemblies. The carrier density of the samples were estimated according to the following Equ. 3 [45–47]. (3) N d = 2 × ( ε · ε 0 · e 0 ) − 1 × [ d ( 1 / C 2 ) / d V ] − 1 where Nd is the donor density, ɛ0 is the permittivity of the vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), ɛ is the material's dielectric constant (55 for TiO2) [48], e0 is the electron charge and V is the applied potential to the electrode. d (1/C2)/dV is the straight slope that is obtained from the plot. As the CBT-x samples exhibit smaller positive slopes than the pristine TiO2, it can be concluded that after the CdS nanorods branched the TiO2 nanorods, the carrier densities of CBT-x photoanodes were effectively enlarged [49]. The calculated carrier density values are 3.22 × 1018, 4.54 × 1018, 6.11 × 1018, 2.83 × 1019, 1.58 × 1019 and 1.72 × 1019 for TiO2 NRAs, CBT-0, CBT-30, CBT-50, CBT-70, CBT-100, respectively. It is well known that the carrier density accounts for the photogenerated electrons-hole pairs and their transport to the current collector and electrolyte properties. In this case, CBT-100 should theoretically have the highest charge density, as the increasing CdS nanobranches and the light absorption capability. However, this is inconsistent with the actual results, Thus, it is proposed that the highest charge density of CBT-50 is mainly attributed to its excellent charge transfer properties of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Flat band positions of TiO2 NRAs and CBT-x samples were calculated based on the M − S results and displayed in Fig. S4. The slightly increased flat band values for the CBT-x samples can be attributed to the higher conductive band energy of CdS than TiO2. These results demonstrated that the photoelectrons prefer to transport from CdS to TiO2, which is a typical electrons transmission path. The EIS was conducted at a frequency interval of 0.01∼105 Hz under visible light illumination in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. Fig. 8B shows the Nyquist plots of the CBT-x samples, where Z″ vs. Z′ are the real and imaginary part of the impedance, respectively [50]. Fitted with the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 8B), the corresponding series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), chemical capacitance (CPE) and the calculated electron lifetime (τn = Rct × CPE) for each sample were listed in Table S5 [51–54]. The calculated τn values of each photoanode increases first and then decreases, and the CBT-50 possesses the highest τn of 651 ms. This phenomenon consistent well with the above discussed ηsep results, which demonstrated the well charge separation efficiency for CBT-50 sample. In contrast, the Rct values reveal a reversed tendency with CBT-50 exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance of 1751 Ω cm2. Generally, a small Rct value indicates a rapid charge transfer between the photoanode and the electrolyte. Thus, the decreasing Rct from TiO2 to CBT-50 illustrates that the electrolyte diffusion of these samples is gradually increased. While, the increasing Rct of CBT-70 and CBT-100 samples revels the suppresses charge transfer between these two photoanodes with the electrolyte. The intrinsic causes of the above phenomena may be induced by a fact of that the high-density CdS nanobranches in CBT-70 and CBT-100 are almost completely full-filled the interstices of the TiO2 nanoarrays, which could result only the outermost surface of the photoelectrode can provide active surfaces to the electrolyte. In another word, the CBT-50 sample has the most photo-oxidation reaction active sites. This point of view was further confirmed by comparing the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of each CBT-x sample. According to the previously reported methods [55], the ECSA was estimated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans (Fig. S5 and Fig. 8C), and it was calculated as the following Equ. 4: (4) ECSA (cm2) = Cdl/Cs Where the Cdl is derived from the plot of non-Faradaic capacitive current densities (jc) against the scan rates (ν), jc = ν Cdl; Cs is the specific electrochemical double-layer capacitance, which is a general specific capacitances of Cs = 0.04 mF cm−2, as the samples are measured in an alkaline solutions [56]. As shown in Fig. 8D, the CBT-50 exhibits the highest ECSA value than that of other samples, meaning that this sample exposed the most efficient active sites for the electrolyte oxidation reaction. In summary, according to the above measurements, it is proposed that, (i) the CdS nanobranches can effectively enhanced the visible light response abilities of the CBT-x photoanodes, (ii) with an optimal surface-to-volume ratio and sufficient exposing CdS surface, the mass transfer performance of the CBT-50 sample determine its highest PEC and PC hydrogen production property. Additionally, the structure and composition stability of CBT-50 after the corresponding long time PEC process were well investigated by XRD and SEM. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD and SEM patterns of the used sample still has the rod-like core@shell structure with nearly the same length and diameter as the fresh ones. Thus, the composition and morphologic stability of the CBT-50 sample was confirmed by these results."
14,Conclusion,"In this work, novel 1D/1D rods on rods CdS branched TiO2 films were successfully synthesized on conductive FTO glass. The surface-to-volume ratios and the loading amount of CdS nanobranches can be easily adjusted by varying the water/alcohol ratio in the CdS grown solution. The growth mechanism reveals that the intrinsic changing glutathione (GSH) solubility takes the leading responsibility for the formation of the CdS branched TiO2 rods on rods nanoarrays structure. This unique 1D/1D structure combining with the intimated connection between CdS and TiO2 endowed the as-prepared CBT samples with broaden visible light absorbtion ranges and fast charge transport efficiency. As a result, with a suitable CdS nanobranches density, the CBT-50 sample receives the highest catalytic performance either in PEC or PC systems. Finally, it is also anticipated that such an advantaged 1D/1D rods on rods CdS branched TiO2 hybrid film could be used in a wide range of practical applications including energy storage and energy conversion."
