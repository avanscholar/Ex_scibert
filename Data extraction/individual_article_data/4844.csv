0,Introduction,"Cascade reactions consisted of multistep sequential reactions in a single synthetic operation for the fine chemicals synthesis have attracted great interest, because they minimize the solvent waste, avoid the separation and purification of the intermediates, and consume low-energy [1]. The synergistic process often utilizes a catalyst with multifunctional active sites, in which the first type of active site is involved to activate the reactant with lower activation energy barrier or create a new reaction pathway to produce the reaction intermediate, and the second type of the active site is involved in producing the target product [2]. Several solid bifunctional catalysts have been utilized recently for cascade deacetalization-Knoevenagel condensation [3,4], oxidation-Knoevenagel condensation [5,6], and Knoevenagel condensation-hydrogenation (C = C and NO2) reactions [7–9]. Chemoselective reduction of nitroarenes is one of the most essential and challenging processes in the chemical industry because the resulting amines are important raw materials and intermediates to make various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, and pigments [10,11]. This selective reduction has been reported over various supported metal catalysts [10,12–16]. For instance, Fountoulaki et al. reported a mesoporous titania-supported Au nanoparticle for reduction of nitroarenes in the presence of hydrosilane [15]. Qiu et al. reported an Ag@BCN colloid-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitroarenes using NaBH4 [13]. Jiang et al. reported silica-supported Ni nanoparticles for reduction of nitroarenes with N2H4 at 100 °C [10]. Leng et al. reported Ru@C60-catalyzed chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes with 30 bar H2 at 80 °C [14]. Furukawa et al. reported a bimetallic RhIn/SiO2 for chemoselective reduction of nitroarenes with H2 gas at 75 °C [12]. Trandafir et al. prepared a bimetallic Au and TiO2 nanoparticle supported on mesoporous UVM-7 for reduction of 4-nitrostyrene with 25 bar H2 at 140 °C [16]. However, these catalytic systems faced problems such as the generation of inorganic wastes, high-pressure H2 gas, high temperature, high-cost catalyst, high energy consumption, and poor chemoselectivity especially in alkene, carbonyl, and nitrile-substituted nitroarenes. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH as a hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative method for hydrogenation of organic molecules including nitro-compounds, owing to its simplicity, nontoxicity, and easy availability of HCOOH [17,18]. This transfer hydrogenation process can avert the use of explosive H2 gas and autoclaves, and thus, it is much safer with easy handling and cost-effective [17]. Several catalytic systems were reported for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes [11,19,20]. These systems, however, required external amine/ligand and high temperature. Therefore, it is strongly desired to develop a cost-effective, safe, and more efficient heterogeneous bifunctional catalyst for the green cascade Knoevenagel condensation-chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of nitroarene. Porous organic polymers often possess large surface areas with high chemical stability and can be easily synthesized, and diverse functionalization schemes are available [21,22]. As an example, amine-functionalized porous polymer support improves the catalytic activity of the Knoevenagel condensation [3] and transfer hydrogenation reaction [23]. Herein, we have synthesized an aromatic porous polymer having carbonyl groups via a facile Friedel-Crafts reaction, and triamine was grafted post-synthetically on the polymer (DETA-APP). The obtained porous polymer was then employed as a support for Pd nanoparticles. The Pd/DETA-APP catalyst thus obtained was applied for the two-step sequential cascade Knoevenagel condensation-chemoselective transfer hydrogenation with HCOOH under mild reaction conditions, and their activity and selectivity, as well as recyclability, were examined."

2,Materials,2.1 Materials All chemicals used in this study were received from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and used without any additional purification.
3,Preparation of aromatic porous polymer (APP),"2.2 Preparation of aromatic porous polymer (APP) Terephthaloyl chloride (0.81 g; 4 mmol) and tetraphenylethylene (1.00 g; 3 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL) in a round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Anhydrous AlCl3 (1.06 g; 8 mmol) was charged into the solution, and the mixture was refluxed overnight. The brown color solid was filtered off and washed successively three times with dichloromethane, ethanol, and water, and dried at 130 °C under high vacuum overnight to obtain solvent-free APP."
4,Preparation of diethylenetriamine-functionalized APP (DETA-APP),"2.3 Preparation of diethylenetriamine-functionalized APP (DETA-APP) APP (1.00 g) was dispersed in methanol (100 mL), and diethylenetriamine (DETA; 4 mL) was added slowly into the solution and refluxed for 1 day. Then, NaBH4 (⁓2.00 g) was added slowly to reduce the Schiff-base imine bonds at room temperature and stirred overnight. The solid mixture was filtered and washed several times with methanol and water. The obtained DETA-APP was dried at 130 °C under high vacuum overnight."
5,Immobilization of Pd nanoparticle on DETA-APP (Pd/DETA-APP),"2.4 Immobilization of Pd nanoparticle on DETA-APP (Pd/DETA-APP) DETA-APP (0.500 g) was dispersed in methanol (40 mL) followed by the addition of 0.1 M Na2PdCl4 solution (1.0 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting solid Pd2+-anchored DETA-APP was filtered and washed with sufficient distilled water to remove the unbound Na2PdCl4. Then, the Pd2+-anchored DETA-APP was dispersed in methanol (40 mL) and reduced with 0.1 M NaBH4 solution (2.0 mL) added dropwise under constant stirring for another 2 h. Finally, the resulting solid was filtered and washed with methanol and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 10 h to obtain the Pd/DETA-APP catalyst. To study the influence of amine-groups on the present catalytic system, Pd/APP was also prepared similarly using the same procedure."
6,Characterization methods,"2.5 Characterization methods Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral analysis was conducted with the Bruker VERTEX 80 V spectrometer (Germany). Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer was used for solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The C, H, and N content in the synthesized materials were determined using an elemental analyzer EA1112 (Italy). Hemispherical analyzer (Thermo Scientific, USA) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used for X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The palladium content in DETA-APP was estimated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on PerkinElmer Optima 7300DV (USA). Rigaku diffractometer (DMAX 2500) with Cu Kα radiation was used for powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The N2 isotherm measurements were recorded at 77 K with a BELsorp-max analyzer (Japan). Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were recorded using a Hitachi S-4300 and a Philips CM200, respectively."

In a typical procedure, NO2-substituted aldehyde (1 mmol), active methylene compound (1 mmol), Pd/DETA-APP (60 mg), and ethanol (3 mL) were added into the pressure tube and heated at 60 °C under the stirring condition to complete the Knoevenagel condensation. After 1 h, HCOOH (3 mmol) was added into the pressure tube at room temperature to commence the hydrogenation reaction. The reaction mixture was further heated at 60 °C for 5 h under stirring condition. The catalyst was removed by centrifugation and the aliquot of the solution mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and then analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent Technologies 7890A) and GC-mass spectrometry (Varian 1200 L single quadrupole GC–MS system with 3800GC) to determine the conversion of aldehydes and the selectivity to the target amine product."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Physicochemical properties of the Pd/DETA-APP catalyst,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the Pd/DETA-APP catalyst The catalyst support DETA-APP was prepared through the Friedel-Crafts reaction of tetraphenylethylene and terephthaloyl chloride followed by DETA functionalization as shown in Scheme 1 . The physicochemical properties of the obtained amine-functionalized support material were examined with FT-IR, nuclear magnetic resonance, elemental analysis, XPS, powder XRD, and N2-sorption isotherm. Fig. 1 (a) displays the FT-IR spectra of APP and DETA-APP. The characteristic stretching bands of CO from ketone and CC from the aromatic group appeared at 1717 and 1661 cm−1, respectively, in APP. After DETA functionalization, complete disappearance of CO peak and the appearance of new peaks at 2832, 3292, and 3361 cm−1 ascribed to the aliphatic C–H bond and the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of amine (NH bond), respectively, was observed, suggesting the successful formation of DETA-APP. The solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (Fig. 1(b)) of APP showed the ketone carbon peak at ⁓197 ppm and the substituted and non-substituted aromatic carbon peaks at ca. 141 and 131 ppm, respectively. The ketone carbon peak disappeared and new aliphatic carbon peaks ca. 50 and 44 ppm were observed after amine-functionalization, which also proved the formation of DETA-APP network. The APP was found to be made of 85.94% C and 4.26% H, whereas the DETA-APP was found to be 76.51% C, 7.24% H, and 12.83% N. The amine content in the DETA-APP was estimated to be 9.16 mmol/g from elemental analysis. The chemical bondings in APP and DETA-APP were also investigated using XPS (Fig. 2 ). The C 1s of APP (Fig. 2(a)) was deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energy at 283.3, 284.9, 287.0, and 289.3 eV that related to the C–C, C–H, C=O, and π-π* transition, respectively. Whereas DETA-APP (Fig. 2(b)) showed four deconvoluted peaks with binding energy at 283.5, 284.7, 286.1, and 289.0 eV ascribes to the C–C, C–H, C–N, and π-π* transition, respectively [24]. Further, the N 1s of DETA-APP (Fig. 2(c)) exhibited two deconvoluted peaks with binding energy at 398.7 and 399.6 eV attributed to the secondary and primary amines, respectively [25]. These results proved that DETA was successfully grafted on the carbonyl group of APP. The powder XRD pattern of APP and DETA-APP in Fig. 3 revealed their amorphous nature with broad peaks at 2θ = 10.6°, 21.7°, and 43.5° owing to their intrinsic flexibility, disordered linkage, and direct π-π interactions [26]. FESEM images (Fig. 4 (a & b) of APP and DETA-APP showed the spherical particles with aggregation in size range from 2 to 4 μm. The textural properties of APP and DETA-APP were inspected by N2-sorption isotherm analyses at 77 K. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), APP and DETA-APP showed steep N2 uptakes at P/P0 < 0.05 related to the type-I isotherms, reflecting the permanent microporosity of the networks. Further, distinct hystereses were displayed in the whole pressure range between adsorption and desorption branches, which are a consequence of elastic deformation after gas sorption [27]. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of APP and DETA-APP were estimated to be 1050 and 593 m2/g, respectively, and the decreased surface area of DETA-APP reflected the post-synthesis amine-functionalization on APP. The pore size distribution of APP and DETA-APP (Fig. 5(b)) showed the average pore size of 1.76/2.58 nm and 1.46/1.88 nm, respectively, as determined by non-local density functional theory. The as-synthesized DETA-APP was used as a solid platform for the immobilization of Pd nanoparticles. Pd/DETA-APP was produced through a NaBH4 reduction method using a Pd precursor of Na2PdCl4 (Scheme 1), which was characterized by XPS, N2-sorption isotherm, powder XRD, TEM, and ICP-OES analyses. The N 1s of Pd/DETA-APP (Fig. 2(c)) showed a new binding energy peak at 399.6 eV and slight diminished primary amine peak compared to N 1s of DETA-APP, which indicated that the Pd nanoparticles are attached to the amine group of DETA-APP through electrostatic interactions [28]. The Pd 3d deconvolution spectra (Fig. 2(d) displayed four binding energy peaks, in which the strong peaks at 335.1 and 340.2 eV were for Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2, respectively, and the weak peaks at 336.9 and 342.3 eV were for Pd2+ 3d5/2 and Pd2+ 3d3/2, respectively [29]. The surface area of Pd/DETA-APP was 449 m2/g, which was lower than that of DETA-APP due to the high-molecular-weight Pd nanoparticles dispersed on DETA-APP. The average pore size of Pd/DETA-APP was 1.76 nm. The powder XRD pattern of Pd/DETA-APP (Fig. 3) did not show any diffraction peak for the metallic Pd particle, indicating that the formed Pd particles are highly dispersed with small particle size on the amine-functionalized support of DETA-APP. The TEM images of Pd/DETA-APP (Fig. 4(c–d)) also showed that the Pd nanoparticles are highly dispersed uniformly with the size of 1–3 nm on the DETA-APP support, whereas Pd/APP image (Fig. 4(e)) showed substantially bigger particles with the size in the range of 5–10 nm. The Pd loading amount on the APP and DETA-APP supports determined by ICP-OES were 1.79 and 1.87 wt%, respectively."
10,Catalytic cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction over Pd/DETA-APP,"3.2 Catalytic cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction over Pd/DETA-APP The catalytic performance of Pd/DETA-APP was investigated for the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-chemoselective transfer hydrogenation reaction (Scheme 2 ) using 1 mmol of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (A1) and 1 mmol of malononitrile (B1) as model substrates, and 3 mmol of HCOOH as a hydrogen source. When the reaction was conducted initially with Pd/DETA-APP and HCOOH, full conversion of A1 was detected with the target product of 2-(4-aminobenzylidene)malononitrile (D1) in 74% selectivity and side products of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-aminobenzyl alcohol, 2-(4-nitrobenzylidene)malononitrile (C1), 2-(4-nitrobenzyl)malononitrile (E1), and 2-(4-aminobenzyl)malononitrile (F1). In order to omit the formation of side products during the reaction, the reaction procedure was changed as follows for further studies and the results are listed in Table 1 . The reaction was carried out initially for 1 h using A1 and B1 to proceed the base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation, which produced C1 having CC and NO2 groups. Then HCOOH was added into the reaction mixture to carry out the subsequent Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation reaction. To determine the role of amine and Pd nanoparticles, the reaction was also conducted in the absence catalyst and in the presence of either APP (without amine and Pd particles) or DETA-APP (without Pd particles) only. Under these conditions with ethanol as a solvent and HCOOH as a hydrogen source at 60 °C, 19%, 20%, and 100% of Knoevenagel product of C1, respectively, with no hydrogenated product were detected (Table 1, entries 1–3). These results indicate that the basic amine group is involved in the Knoevenagel condensation. When the reaction was performed with Pd/DETA-APP (Table 1, entry 4), the Knoevenagel condensation followed by hydrogenation with a selectivity of the target product of D1 (95%) and side products of E1 (3%) and F1 (2%) was obtained, which suggest that the Pd nanoparticles are involved in the hydrogenation process. Further, in order to study the influence of amine in the hydrogenation process, we conducted the reaction with Knoevenagel product C1 as a substrate over Pd/APP, which gave only 18% conversion of C1 (Table 1, entry 5). These results indicated that the high catalytic efficiency and selectivity must be owing to the synergistic effect between the uncoordinated amine and Pd sites located close to each other in the catalyst. When the reaction solvent was changed to methanol and/or ethanol:H2O (v/v), the conversion of C1 decreased to 84% and 71%, respectively (Table 1, entries 6–7), which indicated that ethanol is the most suitable solvent to produce the high yield of the target product D1. The influence of HCOOH in the hydrogenation step was also examined at 60 °C. With increasing HCOOH from 2 mmol to 3 mmol (stoichiometric amount), the conversion of C1 increased from 62% to 98% with ca. 97% selectivity of D1 (Table 1, entries 4 & 8). With further increasing the HCOOH to 5 mmol (excess of stoichiometric amount), the full conversion of C1 was detected, but the selectivity to the target product D1 decreased to 79% (Table 1, entry 9), because the excess H species (after complete reduction of nitro group) in the reaction system promoted the hydrogenation of CC group. The stoichiometric amount of HCOOH produced the highest yield of the target product D1 in the present catalytic system. When the reaction was performed with H2 gas in a stainless steel autoclave, 100% conversion of A1 to C1, followed by 89% conversion of C1 with 71% selectivity of D1 was detected (Table 1, entry 10). The temperature effect on the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction was also studied over Pd/DETA-APP. Fig. 6 (a) showed the 76% conversion of A1 to C1 at 40 °C in 1 h. When the temperature was raised to 60 °C, the conversion of A1 to C1 increased to 100%, followed by hydrogenation with 98% conversion of C1 and 95% selectivity to the target product D1. Further increasing the temperature to 80 °C, the selectivity to D1 dropped to 82% due to the C=C hydrogenation. Fig. 6(b) displays the effect of Pd/DETA-APP catalyst loading on the present cascade reaction. When the reaction was carried out with 40 mg of Pd-DETA-APP, 100% conversion of A1 to C1, followed by 73% conversion of intermediate C1 with 99% selectivity to D1 was observed. Interestingly, the conversion of C1 increased to 98% with 95% selectivity to D1 when the amount of Pd/DETA-APP was increased to 60 mg. Further increasing the Pd/DETA-APP loading to 80 mg, the selectivity to D1 decreased significantly to 80% due to the fast production of H species through the decomposition of HCOOH. The reaction kinetics was then examined (Fig. 7 (a)) after fixing the reaction conditions (1 mmol of A1, 1 mmol of B1, 60 mg of Pd/DETA-APP, and 60 °C). The conversion of A1 increased linearly and reached a maximum (100%) within 1 h, which gave the Knoevenagel product C1. After 1 h, 3 mmol of HCOOH was added into the reaction mixture to carry out the hydrogenation reaction. The conversion of C1 increased from 25% to 98% with ca. 95% selectivity to D1 as the time elapsed from 2 h to 6 h. Therefore, the best reaction conditions for the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction between A1 (1 mmol) and B1 (1 mmol) were found as Pd/DETA-APP (60 mg), 3 mmol of HCOOH, 60 °C, and 6 h. To investigate the potential Pd leaching from the DETA-APP support during the reaction, a hot filtration experiment was conducted under optimized condition (Fig. 7(a)). The Pd/DETA-APP catalyst was isolated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation after 4 h, then extra HCOOH (3 mmol) was added into the supernatant solution, and the reaction was continued under the same reaction condition for another 2 h. The conversion of C1 did not increase after catalyst removal until the termination of the reaction, which revealed that the catalytically active Pd on the DETA-APP network was not leached into the reaction solution consistent with the ICP-OES result (practically no Pd was detected in the final solution). To examine the potential utility of Pd/DETA-APP catalyst for industrial purpose, a gram-scale reaction and catalyst recycling experiments were performed in the Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction. The reaction was conducted in a stainless-steel autoclave under the optimized temperature and time conditions with A1 (10 mmol), B1 (10 mmol), Pd/DETA-APP (0.6 g), HCOOH (30 mmol), and ethanol (30 mL), which showed a 99% conversion of A1 followed by 94% conversion of C1 with 93% selectivity to the target product D1. The Pd/DETA-APP catalyst recycling experiment was then conducted under the optimized condition. The Pd/DETA-APP was recovered by centrifugation after completion of each cycle, washed with dichloromethane, dried under vacuum condition for 1 h, and used again for the next cycle. Fig. 7(b) showed that the conversion of C1 decreased from 98% to 93% with constant selectivity of D1 after 5 successive cycles, proving the stability of Pd/DETA-APP. The reused Pd/DETA-APP was subjected to XPS, N2 isotherm, and TEM characterization, and comparison was made with the fresh Pd/DETA-APP. The obtained XPS and N2 isotherm results of the reused Pd/DETA-APP (Fig. 2(d) & 5) closely matched with those by the fresh Pd/DETA-APP. The TEM image of used Pd/DETA-APP (Fig. 4(f)) showed that only a few Pd nanoparticles were aggregated. These results reveal that the Pd/DETA-APP catalyst maintained excellent stability and activity during the Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction. We next explored the catalytic activity of Pd/DETA-APP for the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction with different aldehydes bearing NO2 group (A) and active methylene compounds (B; Table 2 ). Pd/DETA-APP catalyst enabled the Knoevenagel condensation for all the substrates with an excellent yield of Knoevenagel product C. However, the position of NO2 group on the phenyl ring affected the subsequent hydrogenation reaction to produce the desired amine product D. The para-substituted intermediates C was hydrogenated more easily with a high yield of respective target amine products (Table 2, entries 1–2) than the meta-substituted intermediates C (Table 2, entries 3–4). The catalytic performance of Pd/DETA-APP for the chemoselective hydrogenation of C1 was compared with those by the previously reported catalytic systems (Table 3 ). Our Pd/DETA-APP catalytic system gave high turnover frequency (TOF) compared with others. The Pd/DETA-APP catalyst was also highly stable during the reaction and prepared easily from low-cost precursors. It plays the following three different crucial roles in the present cascade reaction: base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation, H2 production from HCOOH, and hydrogenation. A two-step reaction mechanism was proposed for the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction as described in Fig. 8 . In the Knoevenagel condensation (step 1), the substrate A1 reacts with amine moiety of the Pd/DETA-APP catalyst to form an iminium ion complex 1 and hydroxyl anion. Another moiety of amine in the catalyst abstracts a proton from B1, and the resulting carbanion attacks the iminium carbon to form complex 2 followed by a hydroxyl anion abstracting a proton from the active methylene carbon-containing complex 2 to yield C1 and the regeneration of Pd/DETA-APP catalyst. In the hydrogenation process (step 2), HCOOH was added into the reaction mixture after step 1. C1 is adsorbed on the Pd surface of the catalyst via electrostatic interaction. Simultaneously, the amine moiety of the Pd/DETA-APP abstracts a proton from HCOOH for the dehydrogenation process and gives a palladium formate complex 3, which leads to the formation of H¯ species with the liberation of CO2. The H¯ species from Pd surface and H+ from ammonium ion attack the electron-deficient N and electron-rich O of –NO2 group, respectively, followed by H2O molecule elimination to form a 2-(4-nitrosobenzylidene)malononitrile-Pd complex 4. Then, the second molecule of HCOOH decomposes on the Pd surface into H+, H¯, and CO2. The generated H¯ and H+ species attack the N and O of nitroso (-N = O) group, respectively, to form a 2-(4-(hydroxyamino)benzylidene)malononitrile-Pd complex 5. Finally, the H¯ and H+ species generated from the third molecule of HCOOH attack the N and O of hydroxylamine (−NH−OH) group, respectively, to yield a target amine product D1 by the elimination of H2O molecule and the regeneration of Pd/DETA-APP catalyst for next cycle."
11,Conclusions,A multifunctional Pd/DETA-APP catalyst with the Pd particle size of 1–3 nm was synthesized via a facile synthetic route. The resulting highly dispersed Pd nanoparticle on DETA-APP showed excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity to the target product of 2-(4-aminobenzylidene)malononitrile in the cascade Knoevenagel condensation-transfer hydrogenation reaction using HCOOH as a hydrogen donor under mild reaction conditions without any external base/additives. The superior catalytic activity of Pd/DETA-APP in the present cascade reaction was attributed to the combined effects of the amine support and the nano-sized Pd particles. The amine group in the catalyst not only leads to the homogeneous dispersion of Pd particles and promotes Knoevenagel condensation but also aids the activation of HCOOH in the transfer hydrogenation process. The catalyst could be separated easily and reused without activity and selectivity decline for at least five runs.
