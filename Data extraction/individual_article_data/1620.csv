0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation catalysts play a key role in many industrial processes, such as catalytic hydrocracking [1,2], selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes for production of polymers [3] and hydrogenation of nitroarenes to amines [4]. Considerable number of these processes is based on supported noble metals (Pt, Pd and Rh) [5,6]. Most common ways of such catalyst preparation include either encapsulation of the active metal nanoparticles in a porous matrix [7] or dispersing them on a high-surface support. Nevertheless, the high price for production and recovery of these noble metal nanoparticles, alongside with the green chemistry aspect of avoiding using noble metals are major drawbacks of these catalysts. Thus, developing alternative routes for hydrogenation catalysts preparation by replacing these metals with other non-noble metals, can reduce their production costs and harmful ecological impact through a more efficient use of energy. Transition metals such as iron and copper stand out as promising replacement candidates. Iron is a non-toxic, inexpensive transition metal, which is abundant in nature and potentially amenable to magnetic recovery [8–10]. Iron-based catalysts are already applied in a number of important catalytic processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [11,12] and water-gas shift reaction [13]. Furthermore, supported Fe metallic nanoparticles serve as environmentally friendly and active catalysts in hydrogenation of double and triple carbon-carbon bonds, carbonyl groups and CO2 reductive conversion into useful organic molecules [14,15]. Similarly, copper-based catalysts are active in selective catalytic reduction of NOx [16], hydrogenation of nitro groups to amines, and hydrogenolysis of esters to alcohols [17]. Synergistic effect of these two metals in catalytic applications provided enhanced reaction rates in copper promoted iron oxide-based catalysts for water gas shift reaction [18], as the copper provided new Cu0 active sites and Cu/Fe-oxide interfacial sites [19]. Binary copper-iron system was also proved to be an efficient catalyst for photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to methane. DFT studies of this reaction energetics showed that synergy of these metals is vital in reducing the high energy barrier by stabilizing reaction intermediates and favoring CO2 activation [20]. Additionally, Fe-Cu/γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts enhance olefin-rich C2-C7 hydrocarbon formation in CO2 hydrogenation [21]. All these findings justify the importance of further studies of these bimetallic transition metal catalysts. Choice of a matrix or a support is another crucial factor, besides the active phase composition, which affects the activity of the metal nanoparticle catalysts. Zeolites, among other catalytic supports, have the advantage of high surface area, high thermal and chemical stability and of providing shape selectivity and molecular sieving effects. In particular the molecular sieving effects can contribute to increasing the selectivity to the target product in comparison with other (less ordered) types of supports. Zeolites are microporous crystalline siliceous solids (typically aluminosilicates) that comprise of three dimensionally connected frameworks of TO4 tetrahedra, where Si, Al and other elements are the T atoms, and contain extra framework charge balancing cations. Notably, Fe3+ ions can also be these T atoms thus generating sites bearing negative charge on framework (Brønsted acid sites while compensated by protons) [22,23]. Iron incorporation in zeolites for tuning of their catalytic properties remains a field of extensive studies [24–27]. Specifically, Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown activity in multiple industrially relevant reactions, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx [28–32] by NH3, oxidation of benzene to phenol [33,34] and selective catalytic oxidation (SCO) of ammonia to N2 [35]. In a recent study, Román-Leshkov and co-workers [36] proposed a method for preparation of PtZn@MFI catalysts, through Pt ion-exchange of Zn-MFI, where Zn is in position of framework T atoms, and subsequent demetallation of Zn and it’s alloying with Pt upon reduction with hydrogen. Herein, we explore a similar approach, combining copper ion-exchange and reductive demetallation of Fe-zeolites, to make metallic Fe and bimetallic Fe-Cu MFI supported catalysts. We investigated in depth the process of the Fe-MFI zeolite reductive demetallation using an Fe57 Mössbauer spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (STEM-EDX) studies. Further, we explored introduction of copper into Fe-zeolite by ion exchange and we demonstrate its positive effect on both reducibility of framework Fe species and catalytic activity in p-nitrotoluene hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of Fe-MFI The Al-free, Fe-MFI samples (denoted as Fe-MFI(x), where x stands for Si/Fe molar ratio determined by ICP-MS in the synthesized zeolite), were prepared using a procedure previously described by Ratsanamy and Kumar [27]. In a typical synthesis, a solution I was prepared by mixing 13.5 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and 3 g of ethanol (Technical grade - 96,5%) at room temperature under stirring. Similarly, a solution II was obtained by mixing 1 g of iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) and 20 g of distilled water under stirring. After full dissolution of the iron salt, solution II was added to solution I dropwise under continuous stirring. The obtained lemon pale solution with pH around 1–2 was stirred for 1 h and then 11.775 g of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, Merck, 40% aq. solution) was added dropwise. Upon the TPAOH addition, the liquid solidified, but after mechanical stirring with a spatula and addition of another 7.45 g of distilled water it became liquid again. The final synthesis gel had pH 11 and molar composition 100 TEOS: 100 Ethanol: X Fe(NO3)3: 40 TPAOH: 4000 H2O (X = 2.0, 3.8, 4.7) was homogenized for 1 h and then it was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and the hydrothermal synthesis occurred under agitation at 175 °C for 120 h. After the synthesis, the autoclave was cooled and a white solid product was filtered and washed with distilled water until pH 8 and dried at 60 °C overnight. During calcination to obtain H+ form, the samples were first heated at 482 °C for 1.5 h under N2 and then kept at 550 °C under air for 10 h. Temperature ramping rates were 2 °C/min. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Cu/Fe-MFI and Cu-silicalite-1 Cu/Fe-MFI samples (denoted as Cu/Fe-MFI(x), where x stands for Si/Fe molar ratio, see above) were prepared by ion-exchange of corresponding Fe-MFI(x) samples following a modified method from ref. [37]. 1 g of calcined zeolite was stirred in 100 mL of 0.01 M aqueous solution of copper acetate (pH=6) for 1 h at ambient temperature. Then the sample was centrifuged to separate zeolite from the solution, washed with distilled water and the procedure was repeated 6 times to achieve at least 95% reduction in the observed BAS concentration. Finally, the solid product was thoroughly washed with distilled water and centrifuged until the washing solution reached pH 7. Cu-silicalite-1 (Cu-S-1) and Cu-ZSM-5 were obtained by copper impregnation of Silicalite-1(pure silica aluminum-free MFI zeolite) and copper ion-exchange of ZSM-5 zeolites using the same procedure as for Cu/Fe-MFI. Both parent Silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 (Si/Al=25 molar ratio) were of commercial origin. The ion-exchanged Cu/Fe-MFI(x), Cu-ZSM-5 and impregnated Cu-S-1 were dried overnight at 60 °C and finally calcined at 450 °C for 6 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min prior to further characterization and use. 2.1.3 Synthesis of Fe@MFI and CuFe@MFI Fe@MFI(x) catalysts were prepared by reduction of corresponding Fe-MFI(x) samples in a tubular oven in a flow of H2/N2 mixture 50/50 mL/min at 900 ℃ for 10 h with a temperature ramp of 2 °C/min (the reduction time is given at the final temperature). CuFe@MFI(x) catalysts were obtained from corresponding ion-exchanged Cu/Fe-MFI(x) samples using the same reduction procedure at 800 ℃ for 10 h. The Cu@S-1 and Cu@ZSM-5 were also obtained by reduction of their precursor materials Cu-S-1 and Cu-ZSM-5 at 800 °C for 10 h. The reduction temperatures were selected based on TPR analyses and Mössbauer spectroscopy study (see Section 3.1 and Section 3.2). Samples for the Mössbauer spectroscopy study (Fig. 3 . a–e) were reduced at different temperatures (350 °C, 650 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C). Other conditions were the same as these above. The spectrum of a sample after TPR analysis up to 1000 °C (Fig. 3.f) was added for comparison and this only sample differs for the others in the reduction procedure."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Linxeye XE-T detector in the Bragg–Brentano geometry using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. Data were collected in continuous mode over the 2θ range of 5–50 ° with a time per step of 0.8 s Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics 3Flex volumetric Surface Area Analyzer at −196 °C to determine surface area and pore volume. Prior to sorption measurements, all samples were outgassed under the turbomolecular pump vacuum using a Micromeritics Smart Vac Prep instrument; starting at an ambient temperature up to 110 °C with a heating rate 1 °C/min until the residual pressure of 13.3 Pa was reached. After heating at 110 °C for 1 h, the temperature was increased to 250 °C (1 °C/min) and maintained for 8 h. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated by the BET method [38,39] using adsorption data in the range of a relative pressure p/p0 = 0.05–0.20. The t-plot method [38,40] was used to evaluate the volume of micropores (Vmic) and external surface area (Sext). The adsorbed amount at relative pressure p/p0 = 0.95 reflects the total adsorption capacity (Vtot). Mössbauer spectroscopy of 57Fe was carried out on a Wissel spectrometer using transmission geometry and a proportional detector at ambient temperature without an applied magnetic field. The calibration was performed by the standard (α-Fe foil) measurement and the fitting procedure of the spectra was done using the Wissel NORMOS program. For Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) studies, samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers with a density of 10 mg/cm2 and evacuated in a quartz IR cell under vacuum (10−4 Pa) at 550 °C for 2 h. Spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR Spectrometer equipped with an AEM module with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. The concentrations of Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis (LAS) acid sites were determined by quantitative adsorption studies of pyridine (Sigma Aldrich) as a probe molecule. The samples were saturated with pyridine vapors (465 Pa) at 150 °C and later evacuated at the same temperature to remove the gaseous and physisorbed pyridine molecules. Number of Brønsted acid sites was calculated using the intensity of the 1545 cm−1 band of the pyridinium ions (PyH+) and the number of Lewis acid sites was calculated using the intensity of the 1455 cm−1 band of pyridine coordinatively bonded to Lewis sites (PyL). The values of the extinction coefficients were 1.09 cm2 μmol−1 for the PyH+ band and 1.71 cm2 μmol−1 for the PyL band [41]. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired using JEOL NeoARM 200 F microscope equipped with a Schottky-type field emission gun operated at an accelerating voltage of at 200 kV. EDS maps were collected using an EX-37001 energy dispersive X-ray analyzer. Microscope was aligned using standard gold nanoparticles sample method. Elemental analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique using Agilent 7900 ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA.). To obtain Fe, Si, Cu content in the sample 50 mg of catalyst were dissolved in 1.8 mL of HNO3 (67–69%, ANALPURE®), 5.4 mL of HCl (34–37%, ANALPURE®) and 1.8 mL of HF (47–51%, ANALPURE®) and placed into a closed Teflon vessel, which was then transferred in the microwave (Speedwave® XPERT, Berghof) and heated at 210 °C (5 °C/min) for 25 min. After cooling down, the complexation of the surplus HF was done by adding 12 mL of H3BO3 and further treatment in the microwave at 190 °C (5 °C/min) for 10 min. Finally, the obtained cooled down solutions were diluted with distilled water for analysis. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analyses were performed using AMI-300 LITE (Altamira Instruments) chemisorption instrument. Approximately 100 mg of sample were placed into a quartz U-shaped measurement tube with a thermocouple. Prior to each experiment, sample was dried under 30 cm3/min Ar flow at 240 ℃ for 2 h and then cooled down to room temperature. In a TPR run the sample was heated from 50 ℃ to 1030 °C with a 10 °C/min temperature ramp under 15 cm3/min flow of 5.02% H2/Ar mixture as a reducing gas. The final temperature was held for 20 min more before the data acquisition was stopped. After cooling down the sample to ambient temperature, the same program was repeated to verify that the sample was fully reduced."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Catalytic activity of Fe@MFI(x), CuFe@MFI(x), Cu-S-1 and Cu-ZSM-5 were tested in p-nitrotoluene hydrogenation. The reactions were performed in 50 mL stainless-steel high-pressure reactors (PID - Micromeritics). In a typical catalytic test 400 mg of a reduced catalyst were transferred to a reactor, followed by 39 mL of toluene (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%), 0.35 mL of mesitylene (Alfa Aesar, 98%, serving as internal standard), and 1.234 g of p-nitrotoluene (Sigma Aldrich, 99%). After full dissolution of the substrate, the reactor was sealed and flushed with N2 3 times. When a reaction temperature of 120 °C stabilized the initial sample was taken and H2 was introduced to the reactor keeping H2 partial pressure of 7 bar and stirring speed was set to 1000 rpm. After 6 h of the reaction stirring was stopped and a sample was taken via a reactor sampling probe, centrifuged to separate the catalyst and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B with FID detector equipped with non-polar HP-5 column 30 m x 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm)."

6,Reductive demetallation of Fe-MFI zeolites,"3.1 Reductive demetallation of Fe-MFI zeolites The key idea of the present study was to prepare a metal-zeolite composite hydrogenation catalyst by reductive demetallation of Fe-MFI zeolite. That is to remove Fe atoms present originally as zeolite T atoms from zeolite framework under reducing conditions and turn them into metallic nanoclusters (d < 1 nm) or nanoparticles (d > 1 nm) [6]. Accordingly, Fe-MFI(50), Fe-MFI(36) and Fe-MFI(27) zeolites (with Si/Fe molar ratio 50, 36 and 27, respectively) were prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis and reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperature. The process of reductive demetallation was studied particularly by H2-TPR combined with Fe57 Mössbauer spectroscopy study. X-ray diffraction patterns of the calcined Fe-MFI(x) and Silicalite-1 parent samples together with MFI reference pattern [42] are shown in Fig. 1. All the prepared Fe-MFI samples and the Silicalite-1 have a well-developed MFI crystalline structure, without any additional diffraction lines, proving phase purity of the prepared zeolites. Note the color of all the Fe-MFI(x) materials was white, evidencing Fe species being present in the framework T positions [27]. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for Fe-MFI(x) samples exhibited ( Fig. 2) two broad hydrogen consumption peaks at 350 °C and 650 °C, respectively, followed by a sharp maximum between 800 and 1000 °C. Second run of the TPR program for each sample, did not result in any additional hydrogen consumption, indicating that all reducible species were fully reduced during the first run. A representative sample Fe-MFI(36) was reduced at different temperatures, representing different points on the TPR curve, and subjected to XRD (Fig. 4) and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis ( Fig. 3). When the Fe-MFI(36) was reduced at 350 °C and 650 °C, the Fe species remained in the oxidation state + 3 only extending their coordination at 650 °C from tetrahedral to octahedral ( Fig. 3(b-c), Table 1 ). No Fe2+ species were observed in Mössbauer spectra after reduction at these temperatures. Intensity of the hydrogen consumption at these temperatures is growing with the increase in the iron loading and gives the highest detector response for the Fe-MFI with the lowest Si/Fe ratio (27). Since the Mössbauer spectra showed preservation of Fe oxidation state 3+ up to 650 °C this hydrogen consumption may result from H2 chemisorption on the Fe sites (and the chemisorbed is spent in the site reduction later at higher temperature) or it results from reduction of some minor Fe species, e.g., extra-framework cationic Fe ions, which were not detected in the Mössbauer spectra. An additional TPR experiment, consisting of Fe-MFI(36) TPR under H2 flow up to 650 °C, temperature programmed calcination under Ar flow up to 550 °C (temperature corresponding to sample calcination) and repetitive TPR under H2 up to 650 °C, showed no hydrogen consumption in the repeated TPR run (Fig. S1 , supplementary information). The zero H2 uptake in the repeated run means that the hydrogen uptake below 650 °C is irreversible and thus we can conclude that these hydrogen consumption peaks are resulting from reduction of minor extra-framework iron species [43]. Additionally, Mössbauer spectroscopy study of Fe-MFI(27) has shown that Fe species are present in octahedral coordination in the parent sample and upon reduction up to 650 °C their number increases, which also confirms the theory that the H2 consumption around 350 °C and 650 °C results from reduction of Fe3+ in extra-framework positions. (Supplementary info, Table S1). The reduction peak above 800 °C was attributed to the demetallation of the framework, that is the iron Fe3+ → Fe2+ → Fe0 reduction (see discussion below). Higher iron content in the sample (that is lower Si/Fe ratio) lead to a shift of the high temperature peak position to lower temperature (Fig. 2). Integration of the complete TPR profiles gave hydrogen consumptions corresponding to an initial Fe loading of 1.4, 2.6, 3.0 wt%, respectively, for samples Fe-MFI(50), Fe-MFI(36), Fe-MFI(27), which was in good agreement with the Si/Fe ratios obtained by ICP-MS (giving a difference of approximately 10%). Fe57 Mössbauer spectroscopy at ambient temperature (Fig. 3 , Table 1) provided a deeper information on iron oxidation state and iron coordination in the samples reduced at different temperatures. The Mössbauer spectrum of the calcined parent Fe-MFI(36) (Fig. 3 .a) was refined with a single subspectrum described with the singlet shape. The obtained value of an isomer shift (IS) δ = 0.24 mm·s−1 indicates the presence of the iron in the oxidation state Fe3+ in tetrahedral coordination state, which is in good agreement with previously obtained data [44–46]. Initial presence of any other Fe species was excluded by this measurement. The shape of the subspectrum (singlet) corresponds to a paramagnetic state of Fe. Spectra of the sample reduced at 350 ℃ for 10 h (Fig. 3 .b) was described by singlet corresponding to Fe3+ in paramagnetic state with isomer shift of 0.25 mm·s −1, which indicates that no change occurs in the Fe oxidation state at these reduction conditions. Reduction at 650 ℃ for 10 h (Fig. 3.c) resulted in doublet shape spectra with an δ = 0.33 mm·s −1 and quadrupole splitting (QS) EQ= 0.87 mm·s-1. These values of the hyperfine parameters of intense central doublets were previously attributed to paramagnetic Fe3+ in octahedral coordination [44]. The Mössbauer spectrum of the Fe-MFI(36) reduced for 10 h at 850 ℃ (Fig. 3.d) contains three different contributions (two doublets and one singlet) showing presence of 3 different species of iron in the sample. Two doublets with different isomer shifts of δ = 0.37 mm·s−1 and δ = 1.32 mm·s−1, correspond to the oxidation states of iron Fe3+ and Fe2+, respectively. The doublet shape of both subspectra points to a magnetically non-ordered state (paramagnetic state) of both iron species. The last subspectrum was described by a singlet with an isomer shift of δ = 0 mm·s−1, which points to the iron in the oxidation state Fe0 in superparamagnetic state (relaxation time of the superspin ~ 10-9 s). The mass percentage of different iron contribution in the sample was calculated by following Eq. (1) (see results in Table 1 and Table 3): (1) W mass fraction = A Fe 3 + A Fe 3 + + A Fe 2 + + A Fe 0 Eq. (1),where AFe 3+, AFe 2+, and AFe 0 are the depths of the signals for Fe3+, Fe2+, and Fe0 subspectra, respectively. Reduction of Fe-MFI(36) at 900 ℃ led to almost full reduction of Fe into oxidation state 0 (Fig. 3.e), where the spectrum was described by a singlet with isomer shift of δ = 0 mm·s−1 (Fe0) and a small doublet with IS of 1.21 mm·s−1 and QS of 0.77 mm·s−1 corresponding of Fe2+ species representing 11% of all iron. These observations are in good agreement with TPR data, since final reduction peak for this sample had a maximum at 912 ℃. Temperature programmed reduction of Fe-MFI(36) sample up to 1030 ℃, led to a full reduction of the iron present in the sample into the oxidation state of Fe0 and its sintering to larger nanoparticles. This is confirmed by Mössbauer spectrum (Fig. 3 . f), where a typical sextet with an isomer shift of δ = 0 mm·s−1 and hyperfine field of Bhf= 33 T is observed. These values correspond to the α − Fe particles, which are in the magnetically ordered state. The different magnetic state of α − Fe (Fe0) particles in comparison with the previous sample is most likely caused by a larger particle size, where magnetic energy overcomes the thermal energy term causing that α − Fe are in the blocked state with a ferromagnetic order. This is in a good agreement, with XRD data ( Fig. 4) and the theory that particle size grows due to sintering with the increasing annealing temperature. Based on the above observations, a reduction temperature of 900 °C, giving 90–100% of Fe0 species without very strong sintering, was chosen for reduction of Fe@MFI(x) samples subjected to catalytic tests. Mössbauer Spectroscopy analysis of Fe-MFI(27) sample (Supplementary info, Table S1) showed it contains 21% of Fe3+ in octahedral coordination state, likely in cationic positions (cf. the above discussion of TPR low temperature maxima). Upon reduction at 650 °C the Fe-MFI(27) gave already 100% of Fe3+ in octahedral environment. Comparison of these results with data for Fe-MFI(36) and observations for Cu ion-exchanged samples (see below) allows us to conclude that the presence of cationic metal species provides more easy extraction of Fe atoms from the framework positions, which is why the final reduction peak in the TPR curve shifts into lower temperature region (Fig. 2, Fig. 7). This theory is in contradiction, with state-of-the-art knowledge on, e.g., zeolite Y framework stabilization with rare-earth metals. Nevertheless, we speculate the cationic species are reduced first and once the original cation is no more a cation but its oxidation state is 0, it supports the framework atom extraction instead of the framework stabilization. Upon reduction, all Fe-MFI samples changed their color from white to black. Fig. 4(A-B) shows XRD patterns of parent Fe-MFI(36), Fe-MFI(36) reduced at 900 °C for 10 h prior to catalytic testing and resulting Fe@MFI(36) sample after the TPR measurement. The MFI structure was preserved upon the reduction treatment while Fe was extracted from the framework and sintered forming particles, which was confirmed by the color change and appearance of α-Fe (110) reflection at 2θ = 44.6° in the XRD of Fe-MFI(36) after TPR analysis. In the magnified version (Fig. 4B) we can only see formation of a tiny peak at 2θ = 44.6° after reduction at 900 °C, however upon reduction up to 1000 °C the peak is growing due to particle sintering. The observation of α-Fe is consistent with data from Mössbauer Spectroscopy study of this sample (Fig. 3.f, Table 1 ). Textural properties and elemental analysis of the parent and reduced (at 900 ℃) Fe-MFI(x) catalysts are presented in Table 2 . The parent Fe-MFI(x) materials have similar BET area in range 383–406 m2/g, and micropore volume 0.12–0.13 cm³ /g. Reduction of Fe-MFI(27), having the highest iron content, led to a visible decrease in the BET area value (304 m2/g) and micropore volume (0.09 cm³/g) while the total pore volume was preserved. This can be attributed to slight damage of the structure due to Fe extraction. Comparison of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of parent and reduced (at 900 ℃) Fe-MFI(36) samples is shown in Fig. 5 . In the calcined Fe-MFI(36) zeolite, iron is uniformly dispersed in the material (Fig. 5.a). In contrast, the same sample reduced with hydrogen at 900 ℃ (Fig. 5.b) prior to catalytic testing, shows formation of Fe nanoparticles of various diameters, which finally proves the concept of reductive demetallation of Fe-zeolites as a method to make metal-zeolite composite materials. Majority of Fe particles (approx. 85%) has relatively small diameter (1–6 nm) and the nanoparticles are well spread in the porous support, while few bigger sintered agglomerates (>20 nm) are present on the external surface of the zeolite crystals (Supplementary information, Fig. S2)."
7,Preparation of CuFe@MFI catalysts,"3.2 Preparation of CuFe@MFI catalysts Framework Fe3+ atoms in zeolites represent ion-exchangeable sites. Therefore, a second metal can be introduced via ion exchange in a defined ratio to the Fe and upon subsequent reduction bimetallic nanoparticles can be formed. This approach is demonstrated on Cu incorporation. Cu/Fe-MFI(x) zeolites were prepared by ion-exchange with a solution of copper (II) acetate. Copper ion-exchange level in the prepared zeolites was estimated by FT-IR pyridine adsorption study of Cu/Fe-MFI(50) and Cu/Fe-MFI(27) ( Fig. 6). In addition, commercial Silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 samples were treated in the same way as reference materials. After activation at 550 °C, all the zeolites show complex IR adsorption bands in the region 3800–3300 cm−1 (Fig. 6 . A). The intense band at 3745 cm-1 (with visible shoulder at lower wavenumbers observed for Fe-MFI (27)) represents the isolated silanol groups mainly located on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. The broad absorption band at ~3500 cm-1 indicates the presence of silanol groups interacting via H-bond in so-called silanol nests [47], which can be associated to the internal defects in the MFI structure. In both parent Fe-MFI samples, strongly acidic bridging Si(-OH)Fe groups are represented by the band at 3635 cm−1 [25,26,48]. Typical band related to strong acidic Brønsted sites (BAS) in Al-MFI (ZSM-5) sample appears around 3613 cm−1, which shows that Fe-MFI samples possess BAS of a lower acidity strength in comparison with Al-MFI zeolite [27,49]. In addition, a broad band at 3666 cm−1 present in the spectra of parent Fe-MFI(27) can be attributed to a small amount of Fe in extra-framework octahedral positions [48,50]. A spectroscopic evidence of successful ion-exchange is the negligible intensity of the band at 3635 cm−1 in spectra both Cu/Fe-MFI samples in comparison to the parent materials (Fig. 6.A). The decrease in the intensity correlates also with the concentration of BAS obtained for parent and ion-exchanged samples, determined by pyridine (Py) adsorption (Fig. 6.B , Fig. S3, supplementary information). Only 4% of BAS present initially in both parent Fe-MFI were still available for Py molecules after the ion exchange thus proving more than 95% of BAS were converted into the Cu-form. For Cu/Fe-MFI(27) the concentration of BAS changes from 265 μmol/g to 11 μmol/g; for Cu/Fe-MFI(50) from 211 μmol/g to 8 μmol/g. Thus it can be assumed that practically all the Si(OH)Fe groups are balanced by copper cations after the ion exchange. Speciation of copper depends on organization and localization of iron heteroatoms in the zeolite framework [51,52]. A band at 3673 cm−1 arising after ion exchange procedure can be ascribed to [CuOH]+ moiety [51,53]. This interpretation is consistent with values of Cu/Fe ratio obtained from chemical analysis (Supplementary information, Table S2) for Cu/Fe-MFI(27) and Cu/Fe-MFI(50) (Cu/Fe=0.84 and 2.33, respectively). A value higher than 1 indicates the partial impregnation, which correlates with increased concentration of Lewis acid sites compared to parent sample (Supplementary information, Fig. S3). TPR profiles of the copper ion-exchanged Cu/Fe-MFI(x) and Cu impregnated silicalite-1 (Cu-S-1) samples are presented in Fig. 7 . The Cu-S-1 curve shows three H2 consumption peaks in low temperature region, each corresponding to reduction of individual copper species. Peaks centered at 232 ℃, 274 ℃ and 317 ℃ correspond to reduction of Cu2+ to Cu +1, CuO directly to Cu0 and reduction of Cu+ to Cu0 respectively [54–56]. Introduction of the copper leads to the formation of two H2 consumption peaks at the temperatures between 200 ℃ and 400 ℃ on curves of Cu/Fe-MFI(50) and Cu/Fe-MFI(27), which were not observed in the parent Fe-MFI materials. These peaks are attributed to the Cu+2→Cu+1and Cu+1→Cu0 reduction [56]. Moreover, addition of copper leads to broadening and shift of iron reduction peak to the lower temperature region, indicating interaction between two metals. Metal cations typically stabilize zeolite framework in comparison with its proton form, nevertheless once the original Cu2+ is reduced to metallic Cu0 this effect cannot exist anymore. Instead, the copper has a positive effect on the iron reducibility which has already been observed [57,58]. Conditions for reductive demetallation of Cu/Fe-MFI, Cu-S-1 and Cu-ZSM-5 were chosen to be 800 ℃. XRD patterns of Cu/Fe-MFI samples after ion-exchange and activation (Supplementary information , Fig. S4) did not show formation of any additional peaks, which means that no big CuO domains were formed as an additional phase. Upon, reduction to FeCu@MFI a broad diffraction line at 2θ = 43.4° and a weak one at 50.6° appeared, which can be identified as (111) and (200) lines of copper with cubic symmetry, respectively (Supplementary information, Fig. S4). This result is consistent with previously reported data for copper nanoparticles synthesized by different methods [59,60]. Textural properties of copper ion-exchanged Cu/Fe-MFI(x) and ZSM-5 samples (Supplementary information, Table S2) show a slight decrease in BET surface area and lower micropore volume compared to their parent materials (Table 2) which can indicate that copper cations have entered into the micropores. ICP-MS analysis shows Cu/Fe and Cu/Al molar ratio for Cu/Fe-MFI(x) and Cu-ZSM-5 materials lying between 0.84 and 2.33, thus suggesting that samples were slightly over-exchanged (Supplementary information, Table S2). Decrease in the BET area of reduced CuFe@MFI(x) catalysts is in a good agreement with reductive demetallation and formation of Cu-Fe particles, as the bimetallic particles partially sinter (Supplementary information, Table S2). Again, decrease in the micropore volume of CuFe@MFI(27) can be explained by structure damage due to high amount of Fe removed from the framework ( Fig. 8 . c). STEM images and EDX mapping in Fig. 8(a-c) illustrate the preparation of CuFe@MFI catalysts via copper ion-exchange and reductive demetallation of Fe-MFI zeolites. Parent sample with the highest Fe loading Fe-MFI (27) is presented in (Fig. 8.a). Closer look at the material (top left image) showed it has a well crystalline structure without any additional phase. Analysis of the Cu/Fe-MFI(27) demonstrated that copper is well dispersed in the material after ion-exchange, however it’s also present as an additional phase due to over-exchange and partial impregnation (Fig. 8.b). This is in agreement with FT-IR study and ICP-MS data (see Fig. 6 above and Table S2, Supplementary information). Finally, EDX-mapping and STEM imaging of the same sample after reductive demetallation (Fig. 8.c) showed that after iron was extracted, it alloyed with copper in form of bimetallic Janus conjugate nanoparticles, while siliceous MFI framework was preserved. Prior to the catalytic testing, Fe57 Mössbauer spectroscopy study of CuFe@MFI(36) and (27) samples, which were obtained by reduction at 800 ℃, was performed ( Table 3). Both samples gave 2 subspectra (spectra not presented): doublet shaped subspectrum with isomer shift δ = 0.83–0.87 mm . s-1and quadrupole splitting value 0.27–0.29 mm . s-1 corresponding to Fe2+ and a singlet shaped subspectrum with IS 0 mm . s-1 indicating presence of Fe0 being the major species (almost 80%). Absence of Bhf field for Fe0 is related to rather small particle size, which is in agreement with XRD pattern of CuFe@MFI(36) (Fig. S4, supplementary information), where α-Fe (110) reflection at 2θ= 44.6° is not observed."
8,Catalytic data,"3.3 Catalytic data The ultimate goal of the presented research is to make a hydrogenation catalysts. Therefore, the prepared Fe@MFI and CuFe@MFI materials together with Cu@S-1 and Cu@ZSM-5 reference catalysts were tested in hydrogenation of p-nitrotoluene to p-aminotoluene in toluene at 120 °C ( Table 4). The pure Fe catalysts (Fe@MFI) were reduced under H2 atmosphere at 900 ℃ degrees, while all the Cu containing catalysts were reduced at 800 ℃ for 10 h. The Fe@MFI catalysts gave conversion ranging from 3.5% to 9%, after 6 h of reaction, being proportional to the Fe content. p-aminotoluene was the only observed product. The FeCu@MFI catalysts provided conversions 13–32%, after 6 h, also keeping the linear dependency on the metal content. In contrast, the Cu@ZSM-5 gave only 1.7% conversion although having similar Cu content to the FeCu@MFI (27), which is also similar to the Fe content of Fe@MFI (27). The Cu@S-1 catalyst provided 5.5% conversion evidencing that majority of the Cu, present in the FeCu@MFI catalysts, comes from ion-exchange of Fe sites and not from simple impregnation of the material with Cu precursor (cf. also the above IR data, Fig. 6, and Cu/Fe ratio being close to 1, Supplementary information, Table S2). Blank experiment showed zero conversion evidencing the observed results are intrinsic to the used catalysts. Previous studies of nitroarene hydrogenation in our group were performed using noble metal impregnated MFI catalysts [61]. Full conversion (>99%) of p-nitrotoluene (at 100 ℃ and 6 bars of H2) using Pt@MFI was reached after 15 min. Comparison of this catalytic data with Fe@MFI and CuFe@MFI shows that their activity is lower compared to the noble metals. For example, conversion > 99% was reached over CuFe@MFI(27) only after 24 h of reaction. Nevertheless, the presented synthesis approach of reductive demetallation leads to the formation of composite materials with the ability to activate molecular hydrogen and thus catalyze hydrogenation reactions and we believe their activity can be increased by tuning the synthesis procedure."
9,Conclusions,"Fe@MFI and CuFe@MFI catalysts were prepared through reductive demetallation of pure Fe-MFI and copper ion-exchanged Fe-MFI zeolites. Reductive demetallation of Fe from zeolite framework positions was studied in detail using Fe57 Mössbauer spectroscopy combined with H2-temperature programmed reduction. Reduction of Fe-MFI zeolites at 900 ℃ for 10 h has led to formation of Fe0 metallic nanoparticles with mass fraction of almost 90% (among all present Fe species). STEM-EDX study of Fe@MFI materials revealed that Fe nanoparticles with 1-6 nm diameter were well-dispersed in the zeolite MFI siliceous framework, which was preserved under these reduction conditions. Introduction of copper into Fe-MFI was analyzed using FT-IR pyridine sorption study, ICP-MS chemical analysis and STEM-EDX, which allowed to conclude that Fe-MFI was successfully ion-exchanged with Cu and partially impregnated. Mössbauer spectroscopy and TPR analysis of copper-modified Fe-MFI has shown positive effect of copper on iron reducibility, since reduction of Cu/Fe-MFI at 800 ℃ resulted in 80% of Fe0, which is almost 3 times higher, than the Fe0 fraction value obtained for Fe-MFI at 850 ℃. STEM-EDX mapping showed that reduction of Cu/Fe-MFI, has led to Fe extraction from the framework and alloying with copper in form of bimetallic Cu-Fe Janus nanoparticles. Catalytic activity of reduced Fe@MFI and CuFe@MFI was tested in p-nitrotoluene hydrogenation to p-aminotoluene. Both catalysts were active giving conversion values of 3.5–9% for Fe@MFI and 13–32% for CuFe@MFI. Growth of substrate conversion was proportional to increase in metal content for both catalysts. Thus, studied synthesis method can be used to prepare hydrogenation catalysts with zeolite supported metallic Fe and bimetallic Cu-Fe nanoparticles although these do not reach activity of, e.g. Pt@MFI catalysts yet."
