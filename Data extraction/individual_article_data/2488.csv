0,Introduction,"To address the increasing serious environmental and energy crisis, much attention has been paid to the development of renewable energy. As an eco-friendly energy carrier, hydrogen promises to be one of the most significant fuel sources in the future, due to its high energy yield and non-polluting combustion. Nowadays, hydrogen is mainly produced by reforming methane, leading to the strong dependence of hydrogen economy on fossil resources. The emerging techniques for the renewable hydrogen production include reforming renewable resources (Kimberly et al., 2002), photo electrochemical-splitting water (Deutsch et al., 2008), solar thermal water splitting (Weimer et al., 2009) and fermenting sugar-rich feedstock (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). The dark fermentation using anaerobic organisms is more advantageous than other bio-hydrogen production methods for its low energy requirement and the formation of energy-rich end-products (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). The hydrogen production capacity of anaerobic facultative bacteria culture of Enterobacter aerogenes has been widely studied (Lu et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). In 2001, Kumar et al. reported that the double mutants of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08, with defects in both alcohol and organic acid formation pathways, produced 3.4molH2 mol−1 glucose (Kumar et al., 2001). The Clostrida species, which dominate 64.6% of the mesophilic hydrogen producing bacteria diversity, can produce hydrogen from carbohydrate containing organic wastes during the exponential-growth phase (Collet et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2002). Ren et al. reported that Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 produced 2.42molH2 mol−1 glucose at 12.9mmolH2 l−1 h−1 using glucose in batch fermentation (Ren et al., 2008). An isolated strain T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 can produce H2 with the maximum H2 yield of 2.53molH2 mol−1 hexose at a rate of 12.12mmolH2 l−1 h−1(O-Thong et al., 2008). Recently, d’Ippolito reported that anaerobic batch fermentation of Thermotoga neapolitana at 80°C reached the maximum H2 yield of 3.85molH2 mol−1 glucose, which was very close to theoretical values of 4molH2 mol−1 glucose (d’Ippolito et al., 2010). Comparing with mesophilic fermentation, the thermophilic fermentation attracts considerable concerns due to several advantages (O-Thong et al., 2008; Sommer et al., 2004): (1) the high hydrogen production rate at high temperatures; (2) the high molar yield by reducing by-products; (3) the ability to ferment cellulosic biomass, including glucose and xylose, into chemicals and fuels; (4) suppression of the hydrogen consuming bacterium at elevated temperatures; and (5) narrower spectrum of end-products. The bio-production of hydrogen from sugar is significantly affected by the fermentation pathway and liquid end-products. For example, the accumulation of organic acid, such as lactic acid would reduce the H2 yield. The regulation of hydrogen metabolism may overcome the limitations to increase the hydrogen yield and production rate (Mathews and Wang, 2009). Yoshida et al. modified the glucose metabolism to pyruvate formate lyase and resulted in an increase of hydrogen yield from 1.08 to 1.82molH2 mol−1 glucose (Yoshida et al., 2006). Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2010) obtained an engineered bacteria by cloning the NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase gene into the ldh-deleted mutant of Enterobacter aerogenes to rewire NADH regeneration, which increased the hydrogen yield from glucose by 86.8%. In this work, a newly isolated thermophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium from a hot spring in China was used to produce hydrogen. Effects of the medium temperature, initial pH and substrate concentration on the hydrogen production were investigated. Because lactate was the dominant liquid end-product, whose production consumes an amount of NADH, a genetic manipulation was addressed on the wild strain to delete the ldh gene encoding lactate dehydrogenase. It was demonstrated that the hydrogen production on the mutant strain was improved significantly."
1,Methods,
2,Micro-organisms isolation and medium composition,"2.1 Micro-organisms isolation and medium composition The sludge sample was collected from a geothermal spring located in Enping, Guangdong Province, China. A modified MTC medium was used for strain enrichment and preparation of the inocula (Shaw et al., 2008a). The base medium contained (per liter): 5.0g urea, 2.0g citric acid tripotassium salt, 1.25g citric acid monohydrate, 1.0g sodium sulfate, 1.0g potassium phosphate, 2.5g sodium bicarbonate, 1.0g magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 1.5g ammonium chloride, 1.0g cystein-HCl monohydrate, 0.2g calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.1g ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, 0.02g pyridoxamine 2HCl, 0.004g p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.002g d-biotin, 0.002g cobalamin, 0.004g thiamine chloride and carbon source of certain concentration. The pH of the oxygen-free medium was adjusted to 6.3. The medium was poured into the serum bottles and then autoclaved. The strain enrichment was achieved anaerobically in 120ml bottles containing 50ml modified MTC medium and 5g sludge samples at 50°C for 6days. The suspensions acquired were plated on modified DSMZ 640 medium plates by using xylose instead of cellobiose with 1% trace elements solution, which contained (per liter of distilled water): 10ml 25% HCl, 1.5g FeCl2·4H2O, 0.07g ZnCl2, 0.1g MnCl2·4H2O, 0.006g H3BO3, 0.19g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.002g CuCl2·2H2O, 0.024g NiCl2·6H2O, 0.036g Na2MoO4·2H2O. Morphologically distinct colonies were re-isolated by transferring to fresh agar plates a few times to obtain pure cultures verified through microscopic examination of Gram-stained cultures. The morphology of the isolated strain in their exponential-growth phase was studied with an optical microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a digital camera. Gram staining of cells was performed following standard method. For biochemical characterization, the utilization of mannose, cellobiose, glucose, xylose, trehalose, maltose, lactose, arabinose, galactose, cassava starch, fructose, yeast extract, rhamnose, sucrose, tryptone, glycerol, kerosene and mannitol at a concentration of 5gl−1 were tested in 10ml of serum tubes at 55°C for 24h cultivation."
3,Strain identification (16S rDNA),"2.2 Strain identification (16S rDNA) The genomic DNA was extracted and purified by Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the technical manual. The 16S rDNA genes was amplified by PCR using 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCT GGCTCAG-3′) (Asubel et al., 1987) and 1492R (5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) (Lane, 1991) as primers, which correspond to the positions of Escherichia coli (E. coli) rDNA. PCR amplification was performed by exTaq polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) in a total volume of 50μl. The PCR products were purified using TIANquick Mini purification Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and cloned into the pMDTM18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), then transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells. The plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones with TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The 16S rDNA gene was sequenced by Sangon Company (Shanghai, China) using M13 universal sequencing primers. The resulting sequences were aligned manually using the BLAST algorithm with all nucleotide deposited in the GenBank database of NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Alignments for phylogenetic analysis were performed via Clustal X (Thompson et al., 1994). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007) and evaluated by bootstrap resampling with 1000 replicates (Fig. 1 ). The accession numbers of reference strains used in polygenetic tree mapping were as follows: L09170, L09171, L09172, L09169, EU563363, AB544080, AY350594, AY140670, X76743, NR026296, NR029186, NR029301, NR026458, NR025897, NR025688, FJ360438 and DQ115806."
4,Construction of Δldh mutant of Thermoanaerobacterium SCUT27,"2.3 Construction of Δldh mutant of Thermoanaerobacterium SCUT27 The ldh-deleted mutant of isolated Thermoanaerobacterium strain was constructed as previously described (Desai et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2008b). The adenine methylase gene conferring erythromycin resistance (erm, Genebank No. Y00116) (Brehm et al., 1987) was synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China) and inserted between the BamH I and Not I sites of pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene, CA, USA), yielding the plasmid pBlue-erm. The 539-bp promoter of kanamycin resistance gene (aph promoter, Genebank No. V01547) was amplified by PCR using exTaqTM polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) from the plasmid pBlue-Kan (this laboratory) with primers of 5′-GATACGAATTCGTCGATAAACCCAGCGAACCATTTGA-3′ and 5′-GTATCGGATCCGCCATTTATTATTTCCTTCCTCTTT-3′ (the underlined nucleotides indicate EcoR I and BamH I sites, respectively). The aph promoter and pBlue-erm were both digested with EcoR I and BamH I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), then ligated to obtain pBlue-aph-erm. The ldh-up (∼1kb) and ldh-down (∼0.4kb) fragments were generated by PCR from the genomic DNA of T. aotearoense SCUT27 with the primer pairs of ldh-upF/ldh-upR and ldh-dnF/ldh-dnR, respectively. The primer pairs sequences were 5′-ACATCGGTACCTAACTCCAAGGAAACGAATAGTAAA-3′ (ldh-upF), 5′-GTAGAGAATTCCAGCAGTGCTTGCTTAAAAGGTAT-3′ (ldh-upR), 5′-ATAGAGCGGCCGCCAGAGTTTGCAGCATGGAGCAT-3′ (ldh-dnF), and 5′-GAGAGGAGCTCAGCCTCCCAACATAATTTGATTA-3′ (ldh-dnR) (the underlined nucleotides indicate Kpn I, EcoR I, Not I and Sac I sites, respectively). The homologous recombination vector pLuKELd was obtained by inserting the ldh-up and ldh-down fragments between the Kpn I–EcoR I and Not I–Sac I sites of the plasmid pBlue-aph-erm, respectively. The transformation was carried out by electroporation with erythromycin (5μg/ml) as described previously (Mai et al., 1997)."
5,Hydrogen production by fermentation of glucose/xylose,"2.4 Hydrogen production by fermentation of glucose/xylose In the batch fermentation study, 5ml of inoculum acquired during the late exponential-growth phase was transferred into a 125ml serum bottle containing 50ml modified MTC medium with a nitrogen gas headspace in the pressure of 0.14×106 Pa. The initial medium pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 8.0. The fermentation temperatures were set at 35–70°C. The concentration of sugar in modified MTC medium varied from 5 to 20gl−1. All experiments were manipulated in duplicate. In all these tests, cell dry weight (CDW), hydrogen production quantities were determined. The H2 yield (molH2 mol−1 consumed sugar) was calculated for the different substrate concentration."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Cell cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10min at 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50mM Tris–HCl with 5mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, then frozen in liquid N2 for 1min, and thawed in a 25°C water bath (repeated three times). Then 30 pulses of sonication (3s each with a 3s interval) in an ice-water bath were applied, and the sonicants were then centrifuged at 15,700 g for 4min for enzyme activity assay. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured at 40°C by the spectrophotometric methods reported by Turunen et al. (1987). Cell density in the liquid medium was monitored by measuring turbidity at 600nm using visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific GENESYS 10, Bremen, Germany). After neutralization of the fermentation broth with calcium carbonate and filtration, the residual glucose and xylose were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters 2695, Milford, MA) using an Aminex HPX-87P column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with distilled water as the eluent and a refractive index detector (Ehrman and Himmel, 1994). Liquid fermentation metabolites were determined by HPLC equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after pH adjustment by adding 10% H2SO4 with distilled water as the eluent. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentration were measured by gas chromatography (Fuli 9790, China) equipped with a TDX-01 column and an AE electric insulating oil analysis column, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame inoization detector (FID). CO2 was converted to CH4 by a methanator before entering the FID detector. The oven temperature was isothermally set at 60°C. H2 production quantity (nH2 , mmol) was deduced as: (1) n H2 = n N2 × R H2/N2 n N2 initial N2 quantity evaluated as 4.310mmol R H2/N2 molar ratio of H2 to N2 in the fermentation headspace gas H2 yield (Y H2, molH2 mol−1 sugar) was calculated as: (2) Y H2 = n H2 / n sugar n H2 H2 production quantity, mmol n sugar consumed sugar, mmol H2 generation rate (R H2, mmoll−1 h−1) was described as: (3) R H2 = ( n H2 ( t2 ) - n H2 ( t1 ) ) / ( t2-t1 ) n H2 (t2) H2 quantity at time of t 2, mmol n H2 (t1) H2 quantity at time of t 1, mmol Carbon balance calculation was based on the following equation (Shaw et al., 2008b): (4) C t = 0.4 sugar + 0.4 Lactate + 0.6 Acetate + 0.78 Ethanol + 0.47 CDW where Ct , total carbon, sugar=glucose, xylose or glucose/xylose mixture, CDW=cell dry weight. All units are in grams per liter. In this equation, carbon dioxide was estimated by stoichiometric correlations to ethanol and acetate formation. The carbon in biomass was estimated using the general empirical formula for cell composition of CH2N0.25O0.5. Carbon contained in yeast extract and extracellular protein was not included in the carbon recovery calculation."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Identification and characterization of strain SCUT27,"3.1 Identification and characterization of strain SCUT27 The screened SCUT27 strain was rod-shaped, gram-positive with width from 0.6 to 1.0μm and length from 2 to 15.0μm, and exhibited tumbling motility as observed in optical microscopy (not shown). The bacteria were strictly anaerobic. 16S rDNA gene sequence (1470bp) analysis of the SCUT27 strain revealed that it is a member of the genus Thermoanaerobacterium. Seventeen 16S rDNA gene sequences were used for the construction of the phylogenetic tree with the similarity from 81.0% to 97.0% (Fig. 1). The closest phylogenetic relative was Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense strain JW/SL-NZ613 (Liu et al., 1996) at an identity of 97.0%. Phenotypic characteristics of the isolate SCUT27 strain were also consistent with those of the Thermoanaerobacterium sp. and most of them have been reported to produce H2 anaerobically at thermophilic temperature (Liu et al., 1996; Romano et al., 2010). Thus, the isolated strain was designated as Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27."
9,Effects of operating parameters on H2 production,"3.2 Effects of operating parameters on H2 production At 55°C and pH 6.3 of initial culture medium, different carbon substrates were screened for their capacity to support the growth and hydrogen accumulation of T. aotearoense SCUT27. After 24h batch fermentation in a 25-ml serum tube, most of the common disaccharide, including cellobiose, trehalose, maltose and lactose, except sucrose, can support the growth. Some hexose and pentose, such as mannose, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose can also serve as carbon source for the cell growth. Other substrates, such as fructose, rhamnose, yeast extract, tryptone, glycerol, kerosene and mannitol, did not support the growth (see the Supporting materials). Among these substrates, glucose, xylose, maltose, mannose, cellobiose, cassava starch, fructose and trehalose can serve as the substrate for hydrogen production (Supporting materials). A strong correlation existed between cell growth and H2 production quantity, similar to that reported by other investigators (Ren et al., 2008). As determined, the H2 production quantity and yield were closely related with the fermentation temperature, pH, carbon source and concentration. The effects of temperature (35–70°C) and pH (3.0–8.0) on the cell growth and hydrogen production of Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27 were studied using 5gl−1 glucose as substrate. The maximum values of cell dry weight and hydrogen production were achieved at 55°C as 0.812±0.013gl−1 and 1.91±0.06mmol, respectively. At the optimal temperature (55°C), the maximum of cell density and hydrogen production were achieved at pH=6.5. The cell growth and H2 production declined dramatically when the pH value was higher than 7.0, indicating that T. aotearoense SCUT27 is acid resistant and low alkali tolerance, and moderate acidophilic environment may be more favorable than the alkali microenvironment for the fermentative hydrogen production (see Supporting materials). The effects of the glucose/xylose concentration on the cell density, hydrogen quantity and hydrogen yield were investigated (Supporting materials). The glucose/xylose concentration played an important role on the yield of hydrogen. The maximum values of cell density, H2 quantity (n H2) and H2 yield (Y H2) were reached at the initial substrate concentration of 10gl−1 for both glucose and xylose, indicating that the higher substrate concentration may inhibit the cell growth and hydrogen production. It is worthy to be noted that the H2 quantity and yield were higher using glucose as the sole carbon source than that using xylose as substrate, indicating that the isolated T. aotearoense SCUT27 strain preferred to utilize glucose over xylose. To sum up, the optimized fermentation conditions of T. aotearoense SCUT27 for H2 production are 55°C, pH 6.5 of initial culture and under a substrate concentration of 10gl−1 glucose or xylose. Although the hydrogen production was demonstrated over the SCUT 27 strain, the hydrogen yields were lower than those using Thermoanaerobacterium sp. reported by other researchers (Table 1 ). After the 24h batch fermentation using 10gl−1 sugar as substrate at 55°C, pH 6.5, the hydrogen yield for the SCUT 27 strain was only about 1.19molH2 mol−1 glucose and 0.96molH2 mol−1 xylose. An analysis of metabolic flux for the carbohydrate fermentation of T. aotearoense SCUT27 was used to help understanding this. The molar fraction of the metabolites was determined by HPLC and GC after a batch culture for 24h at 55°C, pH 6.3 using 15gl−1 of glucose and xylose as substrate. The molar product percentages relative to pyruvate in 50-ml cultures for 24h were typically 38–63% lactate, 13–19% acetate, 23–38% ethanol, 36%–70% CO2 and 26–49% hydrogen (Supporting materials). It is indicative of that more than half of the carbon was used to synthesize lactate, which consumed a large amount of NADH in the flux from pyruvate toward lactate. According to the theory of hydrogen-producing pathway reported (Gray and Gest, 1965), the hydrogen production of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. falls into the oxidative decarboxylation pathway of pyruvate, which is NADH-dependent. The NADH-pathway evolves hydrogen by hydrogenase through the re-oxidation of NADH that is produced via the glycolysis. During this process, the intracellular NADH regenesis could affect the H2 releasing. Because the production of lactate and ethanol in the metabolites also consume NADH, decreasing the amount of lactate and ethanol could indirectly increase the hydrogen yield. For T. aotearoense SCUT27, the lactate occupied the majority of the liquid metabolites and consumed large amount of NADH, thus we attempted to conduct a gene manipulation for blocking the lactate metabolic pathway (Fig. 3)."
10,Chromosomal integration and isolation of strain with ldh deletion,"3.3 Chromosomal integration and isolation of strain with ldh deletion The ldh knockout vector pLuKELd was transformed into T. aotearoense SCUT27. Electropulsed cells were cultured in liquid medium containing 5μg/ml of erythromycin for 4h and then plated on agar plates with erythromycin. After 5days incubation in anaerobic jars at 50°C, hundreds of single colonies grew out. Four presumptive chromosomal integrant isolates of T. aotearoense were picked and cultured in liquid medium containing 5μg/ml erythromycin. Colony PCR was used to identify the recombinants using primers ldh-upF/ldh-dnR. The wild-type SCUT27 was used as control. Amplification yielded a 2.8-kb fragment for these four isolates, which is the expected size for chromosomal recombination with double-crossover event (Fig. 2 , lane 2, 3, 5, 6). Whereas, negative control with wild-type genomic DNA as template obtained a 1.5kb-fragment (Fig. 2, lane 1, 4). One of the four isolates was chosen for further study and designated as Δldh strain."
11,Alteration of anaerobic metabolism of ldh-deleted strain,"3.4 Alteration of anaerobic metabolism of ldh-deleted strain For the Δldh T. aotearoense mutant, neither the activity of l-lactate dehydrogenase nor the metabolites of lactate was detected in the Δldh strain for 48h cultivation. Whereas for the wild-type strain, approximate 50mM lactate was measured (Fig. 3 A). It suggests that the lactate pathway was interrupted completely on the Δldh strain, demonstrating the success of ldh gene manipulation. Based on the above analysis to the metabolic flux, the carbon flux would also be re-directed to the other metabolites, such as ethanol and acetate. It is supported by the fact that the production of acetate and ethanol was increased by 2.8 and 2.4 folds compared to the wild T. aotearoense SCUT27 strain, respectively. The results imply that the Δldh strain is a strong candidate for an engineering strain with high ethanol yield using carbohydrate as substrate. The related study is undergoing and will be reported elsewhere. Fig. 3B compares the fermentation characteristics of the wild type and Δldh mutant strains of T. aotearoense SCUT27 using 15gl−1 xylose as the carbon source. With the consumption of xylose, the cell dry weight and H2 accumulation entered a plateau after 24h cultivation when the fermentation medium pH was not controlled. The formation of metabolites can be reflected by the pH value, because the accumulation of various organic acids will increase the acidity. During the course, the higher cell dry weight and the lower xylose residues were obtained in the culture of the mutant strain, meanwhile the pH value of the culture system with the mutant was always higher than that of the wild-type strain. It is indicative of the higher substrate utilization and lower organic acid production of the ldh-deleted strain. The dynamics of hydrogen production showed that the rapid evolution of hydrogen appeared to start after the middle-phase of exponential growth (about 9h) for both wild and mutant strain (Fig. 3C). Significant improvement of the H2 production was observed on the mutant strain compared to the wild one. The H2 quantity produced by the Δldh strain was 2.7 times higher than that by the wild type T. aotearoense SCUT27 after 48h cultivation, although the substrate utilization was only higher by 26%. The maximum H2 yields of the wild and ldh-gene deleted strains were 0.73±0.04 and 1.45±0.05molH2 mol−1 xylose, respectively. Except for the high yield due to the alteration of the metabolic pathway, the H2 production rate was also enhanced dramatically, as shown in Fig. 3C. The H2 production rate of the Δldh mutant reached the maximum value of 10.29±0.85mmoll−1 h−1 at 9h cultivation, which was 2.5 folds as high as the H2 production rate of the wild strain. In addition, the hydrogen production per cell increased by 2.4 times from 0.134 to 0.328mmol CDW−1, indicating that the hydrogen-producing increment was assigned to the ability of single cell. For the Thermoanaerobacterium, the hydrogen evolution through the re-oxidation of NADH: (5) NADH + H + → NAD + + H 2 Thus, if more residual NADH were produced, the hydrogen yield will be increased. Assuming the carbon substrate is transformed to pyruvate through glycolysis, and the produced pyruvate is completely used for formation of organic acids and alcohols, the generated and consumed NADH can be calculated as reported (Tanisho et al., 1998).Then the NADHexcess can be estimated from the molar concentrations of soluble metabolites: (6) [ NADH ] excess = [ NADH ] generated - [ NADH ] consumed = 2 [ acetate ] Based on Eq. (6), the excess NADH concentrations were calculated from the molar concentrations of soluble metabolites at different incubation time. The ratios of Y H2 and Y NADH for the wild and mutant strain were calculated at different fermentation time. All the values were in the range of 100±20%, except for the value at 6h cultivation. This may be attributed to the low concentration of H2 at the initial fermentation. The results indicated that the measurement of H2 quantity agrees well with the theory calculation. Up to now, most genetic modifications of metabolic pathway to enhance hydrogen yield were based on E. coli and E. aerogenes, and few metabolically engineered strains of Thermoanaerobacterium for increasing hydrogen production were reported. In 2001, Kumar et al. increased the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes IIT-BT 08 from glucose by 62% through redirection of metabolic pathways by blocking the formation of alcohol and some organic acids (Kumar et al., 2001). Recently, by over-expression of fdh1 in the ldh-deleted mutant of Enterobacter aerogenes IAM1183 strain, the hydrogen yield per mole glucose increased 86.8% (Lu et al., 2010). Maeda et al. introduced multiple, stable mutations into E. coli to direct the metabolic flux toward hydrogen production. The highest hydrogen production and hydrogen yield of engineered strain were increased by 4.6 and 2 times on glucose basis, respectively (Maeda et al., 2007). Herein, the ldh-deletion mutant of T. aotearoense SCUT27 made the hydrogen quantity and yield increased by 2.7 and 2-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, differing from the work of Lu et al. (2010), the mutant reached a higher cell density after 48h fermentation compared with the wild strain, implying the more vigorous vitality for the commercial hydrogen production than the wild-type strain."
12,H2 production from xylose/glucose mixture for the Δldh mutant strain,"3.5 H2 production from xylose/glucose mixture for the Δldh mutant strain To further improve the hydrogen production, the Δldh mutant of T. aotearoense SCUT27 was subjected to glucose, xylose and a glucose/xylose mix to produce hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the final hydrogen production yield were 2.71±0.03 and 1.45±0.05molH2 mol−1 sugar using 15gl−1 pure glucose and xylose as substrates, respectively. The maximum hydrogen accumulation rate on glucose was about twice that on pure xylose (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that glucose can be converted into hydrogen more efficiently than xylose by the strain. Moreover, the residual sugar concentration on xylose is also higher than that of glucose with the fixed initial sugar concentration of 15gl−1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the strain prefers to utilize glucose over xylose. This can be further supported by the values of R G/S, defined as: (7) R G / S = consumed glucose consumed xylose = initial glucose - residual glucose initial xylose - residual xylose After 6h fermentation, the values of R G/S were 2.57 and 94.00 for pure and mixed cultivation, respectively. The high R G/S using glucose/xylose mixture (50–50 wt.%) as carbon source was attributed to the slower xylose consumption in the presence of glucose, demonstrating that glucose in the mixture is preferentially consumed by the strain and the utilization of xylose may be restrained due to the existence of glucose. These results indicate that glucose is the suitable substrate of the T. aotearoense SCUT27 mutant. To the best of our knowledge, the H2 yield and production rate on glucose are among the most efficient Thermoanaerobacterium for bio-hydrogen production (Table 1). The simultaneous realization of high H2 yield and production rate shows a promising bio-hydrogen production in the future. The excellent performance of the Δldh mutant of T. aotearoense SCUT27 demonstrates the potential of gene engineering in modifying the Thermoanaerobacterium for renewable hydrogen production. Levels of carbon recovery for the wild and mutant strain from glucose, xylose and glucose/xylose mixture at different fermentation time were all in the range of 100±10% (Fig. 5 ). This indicated that the metabolites quantification and the yield data for H2 production were convincible."
13,Conclusions,"The metabolic characteristics of a newly isolated, thermophilic, H2-producing bacteria, designated as Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27, were investigated. The block of the lactate metabolic pathway changed the carbon flux and total cellular NADH distribution, leading to an increase of 2 and 2.5-folds for hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate, respectively. The maximum cumulative H2 yield and production rate of the Δldh mutant strain in glucose were 2.71molH2 mol−1 glucose and 20.89mmoll−1 h−1, respectively. In the glucose/xylose mixture, the Δldh mutant strain can produce hydrogen with the yield of 2.28molH2 mol−1 sugar at 12.65mmoll−1 h−1."
