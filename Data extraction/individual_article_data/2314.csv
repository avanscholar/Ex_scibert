0,Introduction,"Solar hydrogen production as a promising candidate for the renewable energy resources by photocatalyzed water splitting is an appealing approach, which can to some extent alleviate the pressures of environmental and energy crisis [1,2], but the key is to develop and design a low cost, efficient and stable semiconductor photocatalysts. Up to now, most reported photocatalytic materials for H2 evolution are mainly based on ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light-responsive photocatalysts which can utilize the 4% and 43% of solar energy, respectively [3–5]. Nevertheless, the utilization of near-infrared (NIR) light that occupies nearly additional 53% of the solar spectrum is still in its infancy [6–8]. Previous works of NIR light-active photocatalysts have been mainly focused on the up-conversion of rare earth materials (e.g. Yb:Tm:YF [9] and BiErWO6 [10]) that convert NIR light into Vis and UV light for showing remarkable NIR photocatalytic performance. Another novel mechanism was proposed to form a nanostructure with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect for increasing the utilization of optical power efficiency. For instance, the core-shell structured up-conversion nanoparticles-Pt@MOF/Au composites were designed by Jiang’s group, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity from UV to NIR [11]. Cui et al. reported a highly efficient photocatalyst comprised of Cu7S4@Pd heteronanostructures with strongly plasmonic absorption in the NIR-range, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and oxidation of benzyl alcohol during the NIR irradiation [12]. However, the radioactivity rare earth materials and high cost of precious metals will limit their practical application. Therefore, it is a high priority to rationally design and develop broad spectrum (Vis-NIR) light-induced photocatalyst with low-cost and high efficiency for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Therefore, it is a high priority to rationally design and develop broad spectrum (Vis-NIR) light-induced photocatalyst with low-cost and high efficiency for H2 evolution. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), as one of the most important semiconductor materials, has been the widespread application in the photocatalytic field, benefitting from its moderate bandgap of around 2.4 eV for matchable well with the visible spectral range of solar irradiation. Meanwhile, its conduction band (CB) is more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2, which makes it suitable for the production of H2 [13,14]. However, the low photocatalytic hydrogen production and poor stability of pure CdS severely obstructs its further application due to the charge carrier recombination and its photo-corrosion [15,16]. To overcome above two drawbacks, significant modification approaches have been attempted in the past few decades, such as fabricating nanostructured CdS, modifying surface defects [17], constructing heterojunction [18], or loading cocatalysts [19]. Among of which, loading co-catalysts, especially for carbon materials, on the surface of CdS is considered as an attractive method to suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs for significantly improving the photocatalytic activity and the stability of single CdS photocatalyst [20–23]. Regrettably, although outstanding progress has been made in the field of photocatalytic H2 evolution over CdS under the visible light irradiation, there are few works focusing on the designed CdS-based photocatalysts for H2 production under NIR-infrared light irradiation. Carbon dots (CDs) with the sizes of around 5 nm have been of considerable current research interest owing to their fascinating physical and chemical properties, including good aqueous solubility, hypotoxicity, and redox properties, etc [24–27]. Significantly, CDs possess both up- and down-converted photoluminescence (PL), as well as excellent photo-induced electron transfer properties, which infers to construct CDs-based NIR light composite photocatalysts for harvesting NIR light, such as CDs/Cu2O [28], CDs/g-C3N4 [29] and CDs/TiO2 [30]. Additionally, it is reported that the photocatalytic H2 activity of N-doped or P-doped CDs/semiconductor composite photocatalysts is of great potential to be improved in comparison with that of N-free or P-free CDs/semiconductor composite photocatalysts, the main reason for which is because N-doping or P-doping can efficiently induce charge delocalization and lower the work function of CDs [31,32]. Considering the further expanding the utilization range of the solar light spectrum of CdS and the superiority of the N-CDs, the interaction of N-CDs with CdS may be an ideal strategy to design an infrared-responsive N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst for the photocatalytic H2 production. To the best of our knowledge, no relevant report has been available on the construction of N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst. In this paper, a novel broad Vis/NIR light response N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst was prepared via a facile one-step solvothermal method. The as-obtained N-CDs/CdS exhibited obviously superior photocatalytic H2 production activity compared with pure CdS photocatalyst under the visible light irradiation owing to the notable synergetic effect between N-CDs and CdS. Especially, the NIR induced H2 production was achieved by the N-CDs/CdS at a rate of 20.1 µmol h−1 g−1 under infrared light irradiation, which is mainly attributed to the overlapping of UV–Vis absorption of CdS and the up-conversion emission spectrum of N-CDs. Moreover, the corresponding NIR-driven photocatalytic mechanism was also discussed."

2,Synthesis of N-CDs powders,"2.1 Synthesis of N-CDs powders The preparation method of CDs solution is consistent with that of previous report [33]. N-CDs solution was synthesized by ammonia hydrothermal treatment of CDs solution. The specific steps are as follows: the CDs solution and ammonia water are mixed into the reactor at the volume of 1:1. In the oven, the mixed solution was heated to 150 °C for 6 h. Then the reactive solution was filtered for 3 times to obtain the golden N-CDs solution. Finally, the N-CDs solution was freeze-dried into a solid powder."
3,Synthesis of N-CDs/CdS composites,"2.2 Synthesis of N-CDs/CdS composites N-CDs/CdS composites with different mass ratios of N-CDs (1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt% and 7.5 wt%) were prepared using the following procedure: 0.213 g Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and different mass ratios of N-CDs (0.576 mg, 1.728 mg, 2.88 mg and 4.32 mg) were added to 80 mL of DMSO. Next, the homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 m L Teflon-lined autoclave and held at 180 °C for 12 h after vigorous stirring and sonication. The formed powders were washed with ethanol three times and finally dried at 70 °C in an oven. The resulting products were abbreviated as N-CDs/CdS-1, N-CDs/CdS-3, N-CDs/CdS-5 and N-CDs/CdS-7.5, respectively. The pristine CdS sample was fabricated under the same conditions in the absence of N-CDs."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of materials were recorded using an X’Pert-Pro MPD (Holand) D/max-γA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). Transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-SEM) were performed with a FEI-Tecnai F20 microscope operating at 200 kV, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a KRATOS Axis ultra-DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. UV–vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded on a Lambda 750 (Perking Elmer) spectrophotometer in the tested range of 200–800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared samples were detected by Fluorolog-TCSPC Luminescence Spectrometer. The photocurrent-time (i-t) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), measurements were performed on a CHI 920C workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) using a standard three-electrode cell with a platinum wire as reference electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as counter electrode. The i-t curves were gained at open circuit potential in in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and a 300 W Xe lamp with UV–Vis-cutoff filter (λ > 760 nm) was used as the near-infrared light source. The EIS was recorded by using an alternating voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production reactions were carried out in a photoreactor vial with a total volume of 50 mL. A xenon lamp (XD-300, Nanjing Yanan Co. Ltd., China) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) or UV–Vis-cutoff filter (λ > 760 nm) was used as a visible light source or near-infrared light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic reaction was performed in 20 mL water suspension of photocatalyst (5 mg) with or without addition of 2 mL lactic acid. An online GC-7900 gas chromatograph (GC) setup with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 5 Å molecular sieve columns was employed for evolved gas detection."
6,Results and discussion,"From the images of TEM (Fig. 1 a) and HRTEM (inset of Fig. 1a), it can be seen that as-prepared N-doped CDs presented a quasi-spherical morphology with the lattice spacing of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (1 0 0) lattice plane of graphitic carbon [34]. The diameters of N-CDs ranged from 2 to 8 nm, and mean diameter is around 5 nm (Fig. 1b). The optical properties of N-CDs were explored by the UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1c), which displayed two absorption band peaks at the 200–300 nm region. The adsorption peak at 230 nm is attributed to π-π* transition of the aromatic CC bond in sp2 hybrid regions and a shoulder peak around 300 nm comes from the n-π* transition of the carbonyl/amine functional groups on the surface [35,36]. Additionally, The XRD pattern of the N-CDs in Fig. 1d shows that the broad peak centered at about 26° can be detected, which is accordance with the graphic carbon in the previous report [37]. The microstructure, morphology and formation of the synthetized photocatalysts are investigated and shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2a, pure CdS exhibited the spheroidal shape with the rough surface. And the average diameters of CdS particles were ∼150 nm. After the attachment of N-CDs on the surface of CdS, the morphology and the size of CdS have not obviously change (Fig. 2b). The TEM image of individual N-CDs/CdS (Fig. 2c) reflected that many small particles were on the surface of CdS nanosphere. In order to ascertain the existence of N-CDs in the composite system, high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) investigation in Fig. 2d shows the N-CDs on the edge of spherical CdS particles, which affirms the resolved lattice fringes of the CdS (1 1 1) plane matching with the lattice spacing of 0.34 nm and the N-CDs (1 0 0) reflection plane with the lattice space of 0.21 nm [38,39]. This intimate contact between N-CDs and CdS creates active sites on the surface of CdS nanospheres, which is good for photocatalytic activity [40]. Additionally, the HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images of N-CDs/CdS hybrid materials were also performed (Fig. 2e). The results confirmed C, N, S and Cd elements were distinctly observed in the synthetized composite photocatalyst, further showing that the desired N-CDs/CdS hybrids were successfully prepared. In Fig. 3 a, the XRD pattern clearly displays that three distinct peaks of pure CdS at 26°, 44°and 52.1° can be indexed to the diffractions of the (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of CdS (JCPDS 80-0019), respectively [39]. For N-CDs/CdS-5, it should be noted that no relevant diffraction peaks of N-CDs are detected in the composite photocatalyst, which corresponds to the low weight loading and relatively low diffraction intensity of N-CDs [40]. Interestingly, all the diffraction peaks in the CdS and N-CDs/CdS-5 samples seem to be relatively broad owing to the small crystallite sizes of CdS nanoparticles [41]. To further explore the existence of N-CDs in the N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalysts, the FT-IR spectra of as-prepared materials was performed (Fig. 3b). It can be seen that the peaks centered at between 1200 cm−1 and 1650 cm−1 are attributed to the CN heterocycle stretching modes [42]. The wider bands at around 3430 cm−1 correspond to O-H and N-H stretching vibrations, respectively, which implies the presence of hydroxyl and amino groups on the surface of N-CDs [43]. For N-CDs/CdS, all the characteristic peaks of N-CDs appeared in the composite, indicated that N-CDs are successfully coated onto the surface of CdS. The chemical composition and surface electronic state of N-CDs/CdS-5 photocatalyst were investigated by XPS analysis as displayed in Fig. 4 . The XPS survey spectrum of N-CDs/CdS-5 was shown in Fig. 4a. It can be observed that five element peaks were mainly detected, including C, nitrogen, cadmium, sulfur and a small amount of oxygen. The presence of oxygen mainly derives from oxygen functional groups on the surface of N-CDs. In the high-resolution spectra of Fig. 4b, the C 1s peak of N-CDs/CdS can be deconvolved into four peaks at the binding energies of around 284.6 eV, 286.3 eV, 287 eV and 288.3 eV, which are attributed to the CC, CN, CO and CO bonds, respectively [24]. Fig. 4c mainly shows the high-resolution spectrum of Cd 3d, which originates from 404.5 eV (3d5/2) and 411.3 eV (3d3/2), respectively, suggesting the existence of Cd2+ in the N-CDs/CdS composite [44]. It is particularly pointed out that the N 1s spectrum with low peak intensity located at 401.3 eV could be ascribed to the N-H in the N-CDs (inset of Fig. 4c). In addition, as shown S 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 4d, the binding energies of 160.3 and 161.5 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 [23]. In conclusion, the XPS analysis further implied the composite is composed of N-CDs and CdS. In order to study the functions of N-CDs, the light absorption property of pure CdS and the N-CDs/CdS-5 composite were examined through UV–Vis DRS. As shown in Fig. 5 , pure CdS can absorb solar energy in Vis light regions up to 530 nm. Notably, after the introduction of N-CDs, although the absorption spectrum of the composite photocatalyst is similar to that of pure CdS, the absorption curve of N-CDs/CdS-5 composite exhibited an obvious red-shift and extends distinctly to the entire light absorption range up to about 800 nm, which might help to excite more photo-induced charges, further improving the photocatalytic activity. To further explore optical properties of N-CDs, the PL spectra of the as-prepared N-CDs at the different excitation wavelengths were investigated and depicted in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6a, it displays the down-converted PL spectra (300–800 nm) of N-CDs under the 300–500 nm excitation. And the most intense PL emission peak appears at 530 nm with the excitation wavelength at 450 nm. In Fig. 6b, it can be seen the superior up-converted PL spectra (400–700 nm) of N-CDs with excitations at 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 nm (NIR light region), which can make N-CDs act as excellent NIR light harvesters to improve the NIR light utilization of semiconductor photocatalysts [45]. Notably, due to the partially overlap upconverted luminescence spectra of N-CDs with the absorption bands to produce a dramatic spectral coupling to CdS, N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst can generate more photogenerated electron-hole pairs for the H2 evolution reaction under the broad solar spectrum (Vis and NIR light irradiation). The photocatalytic H2-production activity of as-prepared N-CDs/CdS nanocomposites was evaluated under Vis and NIR irradiation using lattice acid as a sacrificial reagent, which can provide sacrificial electron donors to consume the photogenerated holes. N-CDs exhibited a positive impact on the photocatalytic activity in the N-CDs/CdS composite system under Vis light irradiation (Fig. 7 a). Even with a small amount of N-CDs (1–7.5 wt%), the H2-production rate was extremely improved. For pure CdS, a low visible light photocatalytic H2-evolution rate (14.8 mmol h−1 g−1) owing to the fast recombination of conduction band (CB) electrons and valence band (VB) holes. The introduction of N-CDs could effectively separate electron-hole pairs of CdS, thus improving the visible photocatalytic activities of N-CDs/CdS heterostructures. And the highest photocatalytic activity was obtained when loading 5 wt% N-CDs, possessing the maximum H2 evolution rate of 58.9 mmol h−1 g−1, which is around 5 times higher than that of CdS alone. After further increasing the amount of N-CDs, the H2 production rate was a drop, which is attributed that an excess of N-CDs covers the surface of CdS, causing less active sites for H2 production [46,47]. The NIR photocatalytic activity of as-prepared samples was also investigated by photocatalytic H2 production from lattice acid aqueous solution at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 7b, both no catalyst or pristine CdS exhibit negligible H2 generation ascribed to the incapable NIR response of CdS. detected in the absence of the introduction of N-CDs/CdS catalyst or pure CdS in the system under the NIR light irradiation. Additionally, to confirm the photocatalytic activity of N-CDs/CdS induced by the NIR light instead of the photothermal effect, thus the control experiment in a 40 °C oil bath in the dark was tested, which drives from the reached temperature of catalyst solution exposed under the NIR irradiation for 2 h. The result shows that no H2 was detected after 2 h heating, demonstrating that the catalyst cannot be excited to generate H2 only by increasing the temperature without the help of light irradiation. After N-doped CDs assemble onto the CdS nanospheres, the N-CDs/CdS composites can respond to NIR light, originating from the excellent up-conversion photoluminescence property of N-CDs. Similarly, with increasing the decoration content of N-CDs on the CdS, the photocatalytic hydrogen production in the NIR field over the N-CDs/CdS composites is also improved, and N-CDs/CdS-5 exhibited the highest H2 production rate of ∼20.1 mmol h−1 g−1, which is safely concluded that the N-CDs/CdS composite does achieve the efficient utilization of the broad spectrum of sunlight. As shown in Fig. 7c, the transient photocurrent response curves of pure CdS and N-CDs/CdS are measured. In comparison with the less obvious changes of photocurrent of bare CdS, the photoelectrodes of N-CDs/CdS-5 displays a quick response under NIR irradiation with several 50 s light on/off cycles, proving that the catalyzed H2 production is indeed driven by the NIR field. Besides, the H2 production durability of photocatalysts is another important factor to evaluate whether N-CDs/CdS possesses practical application value. Therefore, the photocatalytic durability experiment of N-CDs/CdS composite under the NIR irradiation was carried out. As depicted in Fig. 7d, the experimental result demonstrated that as time prolonging, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of N-CDs/CdS composite only shows a slight decrease after 80 h of the NIR irradiation, which may be attributed to the consumption of lactic acid. When adding 1 mL of lactic acid to the system, the photocatalytic activity was restored rapidly with 17 mmol H2 obtained after 160 h of irradiation. This result illustrate that N-CDs/CdS composite is quite durable under the photocatalytic reaction conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were applied to explore the efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [48–52]. In general, a smaller semicircle radius in the EIS Nyquist plot revealed a smaller electron transfer resistance. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of pure CdS and N-CDs/CdS composite. Clearly, it can be seen that the semicircle radius of N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst was much smaller than that of pure CdS, implying that the introduction of N-CDs could effectively strengthen the interfacial transfer of charge pairs and improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. This also confirms the strong interaction between N-CDs and CdS [53,54]. On the basis of the above experimental data analysis, a tentative photocatalytic mechanisms of N-CDs/CdS composite were proposed in Fig. 9 . Under light irradiation, electron-holes pairs were formed with the photo-excitation of the CdS by absorbing Vis light, with a wavelength of less than 530 nm. Moreover, the less than 760 nm of NIR light can be converted to 400–700 nm light by N-CDs owing to their up-converted PL behaviors, which was subsequently absorbed by CdS. Due to the relatively strong electron affinity of N atoms in N-CDs, electrons in the CB could be easily transferred to N-CDs, leading to the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. Next, the electrons in N-CDs may be captured by H+, resulting in the generation of H2, simultaneously, the holes reacts with lactic acid to yield H2O and CO2."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, a N-CDs/CdS composite photocatalyst was successfully constructed with Vis and NIR light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution using a one-step solvothermal method, in which N-CDs anchored onto the surface of CdS nanospheres. In comparison to pristine CdS, N-CDs/CdS displayed excellent photocatalytic photocatalytic H2 evolution under broad spectrum (Vis light and NIR light), and The highest photocatalytic activities were detected with the hydrogen evolution rates of 58.9 mmol h−1 g−1 and 20.1 mmol h−1 g−1 for the N-CDs/CdS sample under the Vis and NIR light irradiation, respectively. The prominent improvement of the photocatalytic activity mainly comes from the unique up-converted PL property, photoinduced charge separation, and wide range absorption of N-CDs. Additionally, N-CDs/CdS heterostructure displays the outstanding durability, which can continue to generate hydrogen over 160 h with high photocatalytic activity. This work not only confirms that N-CDs acted as a promising metal-free co-catalyst can improve the photocatalytic activity and durability of pure CdS under the wide spectrum irradiation, but also offers more probabilities to design the highly efficient, durable and broad spectrum responsive CdS-based composite photocatalysts in the photocatalytic field."
