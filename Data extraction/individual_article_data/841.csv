0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is a zero-emission, clean green fuel that is considered an attractive “energy carrier” for mitigating energy and environmental crises. In the recent decades, Photocatalytic hydrogen production has been one of the major interesting research subjects [1–5]. Recently, researchers are increasingly interested in the development of low-cost and high-efficiency photocatalysts [6,7]. Therefore, researchers have shown an increased interest in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which can be a substitute for noble metals due to its low cost and near zero Gibbs free energy. Recent advances in photocatalytic hydrogen production have shown that MoS2 with 2D layer characteristics can serve as a platform for photocatalyst loading, enhancing the exposed surface area of photocatalysts during hydrogen production [4–8]. However, compared with noble metals, MoS2 as a cocatalyst has the disadvantage of easy agglomeration and less reactive sites, which limits its application in the field of photocatalysis. Therefore, it is very meaningful to develop a method to increase the active site of MoS2. A number of study analyses have examined the relationship between atomic structure and catalytic activity [4,9,10]. Insertion of oxygen atom into MoS2 sheet has been proven to be an effective method to improve its catalytic activity [11,12]. In recent years, several common treatment methods have been used in the field of photocatalysis to modify MoS2, such as mechanical exfoliation [13], lithium-ion intercalation [14] and liquid ultrasonic method [15], which main purpose of these studies was to prepare MoS2 with few or even single layers to expose more active sites at its edge and thus improve its catalytic effect [4–6,13–19]. According to our known literature, the heterojunction formed by MoO3 and MoS2 has a synergistic effect, so it has a strong light absorbing ability in the visible light region and the near infrared region. Zhu [20] demonstrated a simple method for preparing MoS2-MoO3 hybrid materials. It has been shown that the formation of a suppression junction between MoS2 and MoO3 improves the photocatalytic properties. Hwang and coworkers [21] prepared a new hexagonal MoO3 microrods from bulk MoS2 and used as carrier materials for MoS2 and TiO2 nanoparticles. The MoO3@MoS2/TiO2 composites exhibit rapid degradation of methylene blue solution and good photocatalytic ability. Most of the research in the field of MoS2 and MoO3 heterojunctions only focused on the laminar recombination of MoS2 and MoO3 nanosheets [17,22–29]. Although there are many researches about heterojunction and doping in MoS2 [17–19], few of them focused on the synergistic effect of heterojunction and doping, so it is significance to conduct research on this aspect. The charge transfer rate of MoS2 is anisotropic, and the rate of charge transfer in the internal layer is much higher than that of interlayers [5,22–31]. In this study, based on the in situ formation of MoO3 on the surface and edges of MoS2 in the internal layer, a novel MoO3@MoS2/TiO2 photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency was prepared via a hydrothermal followed by quenching method. The results show that the partial oxidation of MoS2 in high temperature air can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of the prepared composites was also proposed."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti), acetic acid (CH3COOH), thiourea (CH3CSNH2) and absolute ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), diethanolamine (C4H11NO2), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were purchased from McLean biochemical technology co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of MoS2,"2.2 Synthesis of MoS2 MoS2 powder was prepared via a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 454 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 281 mg CH3CSNH2 were placed in a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 30 ml of 0.9 g/L CTAB solution. After stirring for 30 min, the autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 24 h and then cooled naturally to room temperature. The final black powder was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. After vacuum drying at 60 °C for 6 h, MoS2 was quenching at temperatures 300–380 °C. 0.1 g of MoS2 was packaged in tin foil paper in a small 10 ml crucible and sealed with a lid. After rapid pushing into the reactor and maintaining the temperature for 2–50 min, the sample was quickly taken out and quenched in deionized water to obtain molybdenum disulfide crystals having different degrees of oxidation. The samples obtained at 300 °C and 380 °C for 30 min are denoted as MoS2-300 °C and MoS2-380 °C; the samples treated at 350 °C for 2 and 50 min are denoted as MoS2-350 °C-2 and MoS2-350 °C-50, respectively."
4,Synthesis of MoS2/TiO2 composites,"2.3 Synthesis of MoS2/TiO2 composites Composites photocatalyst of MoS2/TiO2 was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In the first step, 9 mL ethanol was fully mixed with 8 mL acetic acid, then 1.2 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added with stirring for 30 min to ensure fully dissolution. After then, MoS2 (10 mg) was added to above solution with ultrasonic crushing (Ultrosonic cell grinder 1000 W) of 45 min. In another beak, tetrabutyl titanate (3.7 mL) and diethanolamine (1 mL) was dissolved into anhydrous ethanol (7.5 mL). After stirring for 30 min, the solution was slowly dropped to the MoS2 dispersion with ultrasonic shaking for 30 min. The resulted solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (30 mL) and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After that, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with distilled water and two-time ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, a MoS2/TiO2 composite was obtained. Similarly, a series of the MoS2/TiO2 composites with quenching at different temperatures was prepared by the same method."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Thermal analysis by synchronous thermal analyzer (STA 409 PC, NETZSCH). The crystal structure was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKa radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 401 kV, 40 mA). The ultraviolet (UV)–visible (vis) absorption spectra were determined using a UV–Vis Spectrophotometers (SolidSpec-3700, Japan). Raman measurements were performed using an in Via Reflex micro-Raman spectrometer at 532 nm. The laser beam was focused with a 50× objective lens to a ~1 μm spot on the surface of the sample. A Hitachi SU8230 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to image samples at 2–10 keV via the in lens SE (U) detector. EDX spectra were recorded with an Ametek Instruments ELECT SUPER EDX system at 5 keV in the SEM. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi-9000) was operated with accelerating voltage of 200K eV to observe the microstructures of photocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo-Fisher Escalab 250Xi spectrometer. The samples were measured at 77 K with JW-BK132F instrument and analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. The pore size distribution plots were obtained by the Barret Joyner-Halenda (BJH)."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production measurements were conducted in an online hydrogen energy system (AuLight, Beijing, CEL-SPH2N) at the ambient temperatures (20 °C). The sample powder (20 mg) was suspended in an aqueous solution (50 mL) of triethanolamine (TEOA, 20 vol%). Prior to irradiation; the suspension was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 20 min to remove O2 in the reactor. The reaction was carried out by irradiating the mixture with light from a 300 W Xe lamp (AuLight, CEL-HXF300). Gas evolution was observed only under photoirradiation, and the evolved gases were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (SP7800, TCD, 5 A molecular sieve, N2 carrier gas). To evaluate the photocatalytic stability, after the first 8 h hydrogen production run, the photocatalyst was separated from the suspension, washed with water, and dried at 60 °C. The recovered photocatalyst was then used for the next hydrogen production run under the same conditions."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 Thermal and XRD analysis The discussion of the results begins with the thermal analysis of MoS2. Fig. 1(a) show that the oxidation begins at 315 °C in air, with the increase of temperature, the oxidation reaction of MoO3 is hastened [32]. The released gas during the oxidation reaction was tested with wetting pH paper and compared with standard color card (showed in Fig. S1(a)), indicating the released gas was SO2. The reaction equation of MoS2 in high temperature quenching process is listed as follow: 2MoS 2 + 7O 2 = 2MoO 3 + 4SO 2 The XRD pattern of synthesized MoS2 was shown in Figs. 1(b) and S1(b), The sample shows a peak at 13.9°, 33.3°, 39.4°, 49.4° and 58.8°, which can be attributed to (002), (101), (103), (105) and (110) crystallographic planes of MoS2 phase [5,17,18,22]. Compared with MoS2, MoS2-360 °C completely corresponds to the characteristic peak of MoS2 and additionally exhibits a particularly sharp crystal diffraction peak. The most obvious finding is that the (020), (110), (040) and (060) characteristic peaks have high intensity. The results show that the layered MoO3 crystal has high purity and highly anisotropic growth [23]. Moreover, MoS2 was quenched at 340 °C for 30 min and the phase was changed from amorphous to crystalline, partially oxidized to form MoO3 in final. 3.1.2 Raman spectroscopy and UV–vis spectrophotometer The composition and phase change of the MoS2 sample were also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 2(a). As shown in the figure that the characteristic peaks of MoS2 at 377 and 406 cm−1 represent the vibrational modes of E1 2g and A1 g [29], and the presence of 1T-MoS2 in unquenched MoS2 is confirmed by the additional Raman peak appearing at 195, 221, 306, 337 cm−1 [26]. In addition, the presence of 1T-MoS2 was also confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. 6). The 532 nm laser and low power (0.5 W) are used in most cases to suppress the possibility of flux due to high low point shifts. The peak of Raman shift is 284, 817 and 995 cm−1 belonging to the characteristic peak of MoO3 [18,26]. Respectively corresponding to the asymmetric vibration, symmetric vibration and OMoO asymmetric vibration of MoO double bond [22–26]. This also proves that MoO3 has been successfully prepared on the surface of MoS2, which was consistent with the results of XRD. And Raman spectroscopy shows enhanced signal intensity corresponding to the characteristic 2H peaks (Fig. 2(a)) only results in the ordered restacking of the MoS2, but also transforms MoS2 nanostructures from the 1T polymorph back to the 2H polymorph. Interestingly, this quenched sample still exhibits higher photocatalytic activity compared to the unquenched MoS2 nanostructures, due to residual 1T polymorph. The UV–vis absorption spectra of these prepared composites are shown in Fig. 2(b), the bandgap of MoS2/TiO2 is dramatically influenced by the MoS2 quenched at different temperatures. The quenched MoS2/TiO2 composites show an enhanced absorption from 380 to 450 nm compared with unquenched MoS2/TiO2, due to strong coupling of the quenched MoS2 and TiO2. As the quenched MoS2 has more surface defects, these uncoordinated sites of MoS2 would be nucleation sites for TiO2 growth. 3.1.3 SEM and TEM images SEM image of unquenched MoS2 in Fig. 3(a) reveals that the MoS2 microspheres were composed of nanosheet with the dimension in the range of 200–300 nm assembled by densely packed petals. The morphologies of the quenched MoS2 samples are shown in Fig. 3(b). The nanosheets of microspheres become crimped gradually with increasing the temperature, because the intermolecular interaction on the surface of MoS2 is accelerated at the high-temperature air. The morphology of the microsphere was turned into a blossom as increasing the quenching temperature to 340 °C (Fig. 3(c)), in which nanosheets are already unfolded during surface oxidation. At the same time, the EDX analysis of MoS2-340 °C shows that O is uniformly distributed on the surface of MoS2 in Fig. 4(a) [28]. The calculation of EDX data shows that the mass ratio of MoO3 in MoS2-340 °C sample is 16% (Fig. 4(c)). In addition, EDX analysis was performed on MoS2/TiO2 composites synthesized using MoS2-340 °C. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 4(b) that TiO2 grows uniformly on the surface of MoS2. However, due to the low content of MoS2 in the composite material, the S element mass was not displayed. Through the theoretical calculation of Mo element, the MoS2 content in the composite material is consistent with the theoretical mass ratio. The effect of quenching temperature on the MoS2 nanosheets can also be observed more intuitively from the TEM of Fig. 5 . The TEM image of MoS2-340 °C (Fig. 5(b)) confirmed the partial oxidation of MoS2 surface. In the figure, clear lattice fringes are shown on the MoS2 surface, and the lattice interplanar spacing is 0.68 nm and 0.33 nm, which represent the (002) plane of MoS2 and the (021) plane of MoO3, respectively [29,30]. It was confirmed that the O2 molecules initially adsorbed on the surface and edge portions of MoS2 and O atoms reacted with partially S atoms therein to produce SO2 (Fig. 5(b)) [4]. Thereby, a gradual oxidation reaction is carried out on the surface of MoS2 to produce MoO3. MoO3 on the surface and edges of large layered MoS2 creates more traps adjacent to the joint. More photogenerated electrons can be enriched during the photocatalytic reaction, which achieve the purpose of exposing more active sites. The present findings also suggest that SO2 produced by high temperature quenching effectively opens the interval MoS2 layers and increases the specific surface area (Table 1 ). An important factor affecting the co-catalytic activity of a MoS2 sample is its surface area. Specific surface areas were calculated by applying the BET method to the nitrogen adsorption isotherms obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature for samples. The data in Table 1, it is apparent that the surface area of 30.6 m2/g was detected for unquenched MoS2. However, as the temperature reaches 340 °C, the specific surface area sharply increases to 202.2 m2/g. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the morphology of MoS2 changes at different temperature. The morphologies of the microspheres are gradually ruptured and unfolded as the temperature increased, which may increase the specific surface areas. However, it is shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d) that the oxidation rate of MoS2 is accelerated, resulting in the layer structure of MoO3 curled into a hollow rod. And the reaction activity site was reduced due to the layered structure of MoS2 was further destroyed, thus reducing the co-catalytic effect of MoS2. 3.1.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the composition of MoS2 and chemical state of different elements. The XPS results of Mo 3d, S 2p, O 1s and C 1s (Fig. 6 ) indicate that the chemical state of MoS2 before and after quenched at 340 °C for 30 min. The binding energy of the C1s peak at 284.8 eV was calibrated in Fig. 6(a), the high-resolution (HR) XPS spectrum of O1s can be deconvoluted into three peaks (Fig. 6(b)), the peaks located at 530.95 eV and 531.12 eV can be assigned to the water molecule for the MoS2 or the amorphous, while the peak at 533.12 eV could be attributed to the OMoO in the MoO3 [23,26]. The XPS of Mo 3d (Fig. 6(c)) presents the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks at 228.70 eV and 231.89 eV in MoS2 [26,27], which are assigned to Mo4+ in 1T-MoS2 respectively. As Fig. 6(c) shows, there is a significant difference between the two groups, the deconvolution of the MoS2-340 °C peak showed additional peaks, and the movement of these peaks indicated an increase in binding energy. The fitted results indicate that the peak from Mo 3d5/2 is 2H-MoS2 at 229.23 eV [26]. The XPS data fit of MoS2 fixed the peak spacing between Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 to 3.1 eV [26]. The peak value of 235.72 eV is attributed to Mo6+ in MoO3. And for S 2p data fitting, the peak spacing of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 is fixed at 1.18 eV. As shown in Fig. 6(d), in addition to the bimodal peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 known in 2H-MoS2, the S 2p regions in the spectrum were found to have two peaks of 163.31 and 162.12 eV, respectively. Confirm that these additional peaks are from 1T-MoS2. Among the plausible explanations for these results is that a portion of 1T-MoS2 is gradually quenched to form a 2H phase and partially oxidized to MoO3 with increasing temperature [24]. Although 1T-MoS2 gradually decreases with increasing quenching temperature, the formation of MoS2@MoO3 heterojunction increases the photocatalytic activity as the quenching temperature increases."
9,Photocatalytic H2 production of MoS2/TiO2,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production of MoS2/TiO2 In order to more intuitively understand the effect of quenching process on the photocatalytic activity of MoS2, the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment of MoS2/TiO2 composites was carried out with Xe lamp as the light source. Fig. 7(a) presents the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of the sample. Previous studies have shown that no hydrogen is produced when MoS2 is used alone as a photocatalyst, which indicates that pure MoS2 cannot satisfy the conditions of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The pure TiO2 without MoS2 loading shows low H2 evolution 176 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S3(a)) because of fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The hydrogen evolution rate of 1.3 wt% MoS2/TiO2 composites is significantly enhanced to 798 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 4.5 times of that over bare TiO2 under same condition. The formation of a heterojunction between TiO2 and MoS2 in the MoS2/TiO2 composites can effectively increase the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs, thereby achieving a more effective hydrogen evolution effect. And the H2 evolution rate increases to 1780 μmol g−1 h−1 when loaded with MoS2-300 °C. The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency increased with a rise of MoS2 quenching temperature. When the quenching temperature of MoS2 at 340 °C for 30 min. The photocatalytic activity was increased to 4669 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 5.9 times greater than that of the 1.3MT composites material. The results shown in Fig. 7(b), it is apparent that the active site of MoS2 was significantly increase with the increase of quenching time at the quenching temperature of 350 °C, and the maximum hydrogen evolution efficiency of M-10/T was 4691 μmol g−1 h−1. As shown in Figs. 7(b) and S3(b), the same quenching time is carried out under the protection of N2 atmosphere. The hydrogen production rate of M-10⁎/T composites is only 2234 μmol g−1 h−1. In Fig. 7(a, b) there is a clear trend of decreasing when the quenching temperature is greater than 340 °C for 30 min or the quenching temperature is 350 °C for more than 10 min, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is significantly reduced. The stability of M-340/T composites was tested by a recycling test. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the three-photocatalytic hydrogen production cycle test of the MoS2/TiO2 composites concluded that the hydrogen production efficiency was only reduced by 10%. It is confirmed that the MoS2/TiO2 composites has good stability in the photocatalytic process. Our findings indicate that MoS2 after quenching can absorb light more efficiently while providing additional photogenerated electrons. MoS2@MoO3 supports TiO2 as shown in Fig. 8 . When TiO2 is excited by light, electron hole pairs can be produced, and the excited electron transition of TiO2 on the surface is quickly transferred to the MoS2 conduction band (CB). The photoelectrons are then transferred from the CB of MoS2 to MoO3 CB. The MoS2@MoO3 heterostructure obtained by a small amount of oxidation can effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers and improve the interface charge transfer ability. The MoO3 modified MoS2 surface and edge sites produce high concentrations of electrons that combine with H+ in the water to form H2. At the same time, the sacrificial reagent consumes photogenerated holes. Therefore, under the heterogeneous MoS2@MoO3 structure, the synergy between MoS2@MoO3 and TiO2 can improve the photocatalytic efficiency, thereby achieving more efficient hydrogen production. However, excessive oxidation will also destroy the integrity of the MoS2 structure and reduce the transmission efficiency of photogenerated electrons, thereby reducing the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, the novel MoO3@MoS2/TiO2 photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency was successfully prepared via a hydrothermal followed by quenching method. MoO3 produced on the surface and edge of MoS2 after high temperature partial oxidation produces more traps at the interface between MoS2 and MoO3, and more photogenerated electrons can be enriched in the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the reactive sites of MoS2 are greatly increased, and these defect sites act as adsorption sites for hydrogen ions, thereby realizing more efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production of MoS2/TiO2 composites materials. This result of surface partial oxidation of MoS2 nanosheets maybe provides an idea for the preparation of two-dimensional layer catalytic materials."
