0,Introduction,"Hydrocarbons such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil derived from fossil fuels are currently in common use. However, strict and rigorously implemented environmental protection will eventually require that fossil energy sources, which are considered to be responsible for the deterioration of air quality and the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, should no longer be exploited or combusted. Therefore, in future sustainable energy systems it will be necessary to switch to other energy carriers which are convenient, clean, safe, efficient and versatile. Hydrogen possesses these characteristics, since it can be produced and converted into electricity at a relatively high efficiency and may easily be stored in large quantities. These properties allow an increased number of intermittent renewable energy sources to be integrated into the power generation mix [1–6]. The hydrogen production from several sources and via different techniques has been reported over the last few decades. For example, hydrogen could be produced from the biomass by gasification or pyrrolysis [7–9] and also by the steam gasification as reported in [10]. Hydrogen can be also obtained through the catalytic reforming of bio-oil [11] and via the photo-catalyzed water splitting [12]. The hydrogen productivity by the catalytic decomposition of methane has been extensively studied lately. Methane could be counted as one of the simplest hydrogen containing compounds however from the economic perspectives it might be inefficient source for the hydrogen production in terms of being an individual source of energy itself. The technology of converting methane to hydrogen is based on the catalytic breaking of C-H bond in order to release hydrogen and to get in-situ carbon materials; usually CNTs [13–15]. Based on the same concept of the C-H bond cleavage, a valuable source for the hydrogen production has been introduced through this research study; namely long chains n-paraffin. This type of material; is highly rich of hydrogen, can be acquired from waxes which usually come out as by-product of the dewaxing stage during the manufacture of lubricating oils base stocks. Paraffinic hydrocarbons are saturated straight-chain organic compounds that follow the formula C n H2 n +2. These hydrocarbons are solid at ambient temperature and usually are produced from low and medium boiling range distillates [16,17]. Molybdenum based catalysts have been previously reported for the hydrogen production application however via the water splitting and the water electrolysis. The utilization of SBA frame-worked MoO3 in the hydrogen evolution through a catalytic route can be also taken in account as a new approach of this research study. Molybdenum base catalysts are interesting candidates for a large variety of catalytic reactions such as olefin metathesis, selective oxidation of alkane or alcohols and partial oxidation of alkene [18,19]. SBA-15 supported Mo catalysts have been currently of interest as catalysts for the partial oxidation and polymerization [20–22] nevertheless these catalysts were usually prepared by the impregnation of AHM to SBA-15. Other strategies to prepare molybdenum containing SBA-15 structures through co-condensation methodologies were illustrated by few scientific articles. This is probably due to the difficulty of the incorporation of hetero atoms into the matrix of SBA-15 materials through the direct synthesis procedures. The strong acidic media avoids the formation of Si-O-M bonds and destroys them when formed [23]. However, this technique has been widely applied to the incorporation of several metal atoms such as Al [24,25], Ti [26–28], Sn [29] or Fe [30], to the structure of SBA-15 type of materials with successful results. The key factor in the synthesis of these heteroatom-substituted SBA-15 materials has been the control of the pH values throughout the synthesis media. The materials that are prepared using this technique generally show good dispersion of the active phase as well as high accessibility to the metallic sites. These investigations have in turn extended the application of this preparation technique to the case of molybdenum-SBA materials. Herein, the current study reports the synthesis and characterization of molybdenum functionalized meso-structured SBA-15 materials with a highly active species. The evaluation of this material in hydrogen production via a catalytic decomposition of hydrogen rich material; n-paraffin, is the main scope of this research work."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of MoSBA-15 catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of MoSBA-15 catalyst Mo-SBA-15 was synthesized by a direct synthesis method using the co-condensation technique under a high acidic condition with the inclusion of a slight modification to the procedure that was reported by [26] for the synthesis of Ti-SBA-15. Ammonium molybdate tetra-hydrate [(NH4)6[Mo7O24]·4H2O, Aldrich] and tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate [TEOS, Aldrich] were used as Mo metal and silicon starting materials respectively. Pluronic P123 (EO20-PO70EO20, Aldrich) triblock co-polymer with a molecular weight of 5800 was then used as a structure directing agent. In a typical synthesis, 8g of Pluronic P123 was added to 60mL of water under magnetic stirring effect. After stirring for few hours, a clear solution was obtained. Thereafter, the mixture was heated up to 40°C which was then followed by the addition of 240mL [2M solution of HCl] promptly as a stable temperature was detected. The solution was next left to stir for about 2h, then 17.34g of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate and certain amount of the Ammonium hepta-molybdate, as for a required certain molar ratio, were simultaneously added in order to obtain 10% Mo (w/w) at the eventual product, the powder catalyst. At the completion of the prior step, a clear yellowish green color of the solution was noticed. The mixture was afterward stirred overnight at 40°C. The solution was ultimately subjected to a hydrothermal treatment at 80°C and under static condition in order to decompose and to demolish the polymer particles of the SBA-15 channels. During this stage the solution color turned from yellowish green to a light blue color. At the end of this stage, the formed solid product was recovered by filtration. It was then washed several times using distilled water, and was left to dry at room temperature. The produced catalyst was introduced at the end to a calcination step at 550°C; conducted through a heating ramp of 1°C/min [25,28,30]. The preparation of the Mo-SBA15 had followed the same route of the synthesis of the bare SBA15 which was also done by the authors of this work. The preparation procedures of the SBA15 with an indication of the effect of the different parameters on the structure of the final product are provided through the supporting information (see section ST1)."
3,Catalyst and products characterization,"2.2 Catalyst and products characterization The essential structural and morphological characteristics of the parent SBA15-Mo catalyst was demonstrated by different tools analysis as next given: X-ray powder diffraction (XRD): the XRD spectra were recorded using diffract meter model Brucker AXS-D8 Advance (Germany). The instrument is supplied with nickel-filtered copper radiation (λ =1.5405Å) at 60kV and 25mA with a scanning speed of 8° in 20min−1, BET Surface area analysis: an instrument model Quanta-chrome Nova 3200 (USA) was utilized for the identification of surface characteristics of the prepared catalyst under nitrogen. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms was carried out at −196°C. The sample degassing conditions was 200°C and 4h under a reduced pressure in order to pull out any contaminants included within the sample structure. Specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated from multi-point at relative pressure (P/Po ) ranging from 0.05 to 0.30. Pore size distribution was obtained from Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method using the adsorption points of the isotherm. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC): the thermal stability of the tested sample was done by thermo-gravimetric device model SDT-Q600 V20.5 Pouild 15, USA. The sample analyses were carried out under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Transmission electron microscope (TEM): the morphology of the prepared catalyst was studied by the aid of Transmission electron microscope; model Jeol TEM-1230 microscope, Japan. This instrument can provide as high power as 200keV and magnification up to 600,000times. 2.2.1 Gas Chromatography (GC) The feedstock as well as the collected products after processing [both gases and the oily fractions] was analyzed using gas chromatography instrument modelClarus 500 manufactured by PerkinElmer’s-USA. This GC device is equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) in order to identify the content of the different paraffinic structures. The device is also fitted with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in order to analyze the composition of gases, as collected."
4,Feedstock preparation,"2.3 Feedstock preparation The wax sample as received from the dewaxing stage during the lubricating oil production; namely light slack wax (LSW), had obeyed some physical and structural analysis. The main characteristics of the LSW are next listed in Table 1 . Before introducing the LSW to the hydrogen production process, two subsequent levels of treatment was carried out, particularly de-oiling and finishing steps. The purpose of these steps was mainly to change the wax structure towards the saturated components [n-paraffin and Iso & cyclo-paraffin] via the removal of the aromatic content included within the feedstock. This stage was necessary in terms of avoiding the interference of the aromatic compounds cracking into the designed process as well as the avoidance of the catalyst poisoning during the operation of the wax decomposition. 2.3.1 De-oiling step LSW was subjected to the oil (aromatic components) elimination via the solvent percolation technique. In this technique, butyl acetate solvent was used at an ambient temperature of 20°C while a fixed solvent-to-feed ratio of 10:1 (by weight) was applied. 2.3.2 Finishing step The wax components which were separated from LSW; commonly known as hard wax, were then introduced to the finishing step. This step was executed, by using clay, in order to remove any remaining contaminates; residual aromatics, before the start of the catalytic decomposition of the paraffin chains. The characteristics of both the hard and finished wax which were produced out of the prior treatments are given in Table 1."
5,Hydrogen production,"2.4 Hydrogen production The hydrogen production procedures were carried out through using an adiabatic system (low temperature autoclave). After the system was fully set up by charging the prepared Mo catalyst and the feedstock (the finished wax sample), the system was pursed using a flow of the nitrogen gas. A nitrogen stream of 20mL/min for approximately 10min was applied. This step was necessary in order to get sure of that the surrounding atmosphere to the feedstock, inside the system, is totally inert. This step was urgent in terms of attaining catalyst assisted pyrrolysis based decomposition, as proposed during this work. The nitrogen gas was then completely released out of the system. The reaction system was then heated up to 250°C, at the first stage of investigation. The hydrogen production process had promptly started as soon as a stable temperature was detected (after about 15min of starting the heating) via stirring all the constituents which are placed inside the autoclave at a mixing rate of 150rpm/min. The stirring is obviously needed in order to perfectly disperse the catalyst within the whole structure of the feedstock, hence an efficient process can successfully undertake. At the first stage of the hydrogen production process, constant temperature as well as catalyst-to-feedstock ratio, particularly5wt.%, was applied while different reaction times were investigated. The effect of different processing times; namely 30, 60, 120 and 240min, on the conversion of the feedstock into gases were tested. The composition of the produced gases at the end of each testing time was also studied. At the accomplishment of this stage, the optimum operating time was selected, based on the rate of the feedstock-to-gases conversion and the composition of the obtained gas too. Following to that stage, another level of testing was imposed. In stage 2, the optimum reaction time, from stage 1, was used while the effect of different ratios of catalyst-to-feedstock on the adeptness of the hydrogen productivity was examined. Several catalyst-to-feed ratios were introduced throughout this stage, particularly 2.5, 5, 10 and 15wt.%. At this stage a stable temperature of 250°C was also utilized at each catalyst-to-feedstock ratio. By the end of this level of testing, the best catalyst ratio was determined on the basis of the highest hydrogen concentration that was acquired after analyzing the obtained gases at each run. Lastly, the final stage of testing the effectiveness of the prepared catalyst in producing hydrogen was carried out. At this stage, the effect of different temperatures (200, 250 and 300°C) on the feedstock conversion to gases was studied. The optimum operating conditions that were detected from both stages 1 and 2 were also applied in this step. After the determination of the best conditions out of the prior mentioned three stages, these conditions were next used to measure the hydrogen production via utilizing two other catalysts. These catalysts are commercial grades of silica and MoO3 [CAS numbers 112945-52-5 and 5 respectively], were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. This step was particularly important in order to validate the efficiency of the prepared MoO3-SBA15 in the proposed hydrogen production process during this research. Generally, at the completion of each experimental run, all the obtained fractions either the gases or the carbon species and the oily products were collected and forwarded for analyses. The procedures which are described at the beginning of this section and that belong to the setup of the reaction system were all exactly repeated at all the carried out experiments."
6,Result and discussion,
7,X-ray analysis,"3.1 X-ray analysis The XRD analysis of the prepared catalyst has been given at both low and high angles reflection. Mo-SBA-15 showed high angle reflections indicative to the amorphous structure of silica with a complete absence for any sharp MoO3 characteristic peaks. This clearly indicates non-existence of the crystalline domains of molybdenum oxide, unless of being present with a crystal sizes that are too small to be detected at the high angle X-ray diffraction. On the other hand, intense signals are present at low angle values which are referring to a characteristic diffraction pattern of the p6mm symmetry of the hexagonal array of the pores in the SBA-15 topology [25,28,30–32]. In addition, the presence of three clear reflections; corresponding to the 100, 110 and 200 symmetries, is indicative to the high ordering in the mesoscopic range of the synthesized catalyst. In fact, the 100 reflection in the XRD analyses can show that the incorporation of the Mo metal within the silica structure does not influence by anyhow the inter-planar spacing of the SBA-15 structure [32,33]. The XRD pattern of the parent SBA15 is given throughout the supporting information (see section ST2 and Fig. S1). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Mo-SBA15 have been in a strong match with the nitrogen adsorption isotherms shown in Fig. 2 , as next illustrated, confirming the good mesoscopic ordering along the entire structure of the synthesized material. In order to confirm about the incorporation of molybdenum oxide within the structure of the SBA15, the length of the hexagonal unit cell (ao ) for both the pure SBA-15 and Mo-SBA-15 were determined. The (ao ) calculation had followed the formula: ao =2d 100/√3, where the d spacing is compatible with the hexagonal P6mm space group. The ao values was found to be 10.46 and 11.72nm for both the SBA15 structure and the Mo incorporated SBA respectively (see Table S1 in the supporting information for full details). The noticed expansion in the unit cell parameter of the Mo-SBA-15 is highly likely linked to the successful incorporation of Mo into silica framework. This unit cell expansion can be due to the longer is the length of the Mo–O bond, compared to Si–O one."
8,Textural properties,"3.2 Textural properties 3.2.1 Surface identification of MoSBA-15 catalyst N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the in-situ pore size distribution curve (BJH) of the MoSBA-15 catalyst are given in Fig. 2. The surface characteristic of tested sample is illustrated in Table 2 . According to IUPAC classification, the exhibited isotherm is typically indicative of a type IV material [34], in terms of the coincidence between the ordered meso-porous structures with H1 hysteresis loop. This type of loop can be referred to the presence of uniform cylindrical pores of relatively large dimensions, relevant to the SBA-15 nature. These pores structure was also clearly confirmed in terms of the pronounced steep in the adsorption branch of the isotherm which indicates a narrow pore size distribution which is typical of well-ordered meso-structured materials (Fig. 2). The synthesized Mo-SBA-15 catalyst exhibited a markedly high surface area (S BET) of 598.5m2/g accompanied with a considerable total pore volume of 0.659 (cm3/g) (Table 2). In line with, the PSD curve showed a unique main pore radius centered at 2.56nm confirming the presence of a low meso-porous structure. The surface characteristics of both the bare SBA15 and the Mo-SBA15 had also showed a confirmation of the incorporation of the Mo metal within the SBA15 structure. The surface analysis of the parent SBA15 are displayed through the supporting information (see Fig. S2 and section ST3). The pure SBA-15 exhibited a surface area (S BET) value of 500.3m2/g while the total pore volume was 0.604cm3/g. The incorporation of the molybdenum oxide in the SBA-15 lattice could not affect largely the shape of the adsorption isotherm, compared to the pure SBA-15 material (see both Figs. 2 and S2). The synthesized Mo-SBA-15 sample exhibited markedly high surface area (S BET) of 598.5m2/g with a considerable total pore volume of 0.659cm3/g. The increase of both the SBET and the total pore volume values, compared to the pure SBA15, can in turn confirm the expansion of the meso-pores upon introducing the Mo into the framework. In addition, the incorporation of Mo into the SBA-15 framework was also accompanied by an increase in the pores wall thickness (Tw ) from 4.13nm for the pure SBA-15 to 6.60nm in the case of Mo-SBA-15. This obviously can demonstrate the incorporation of the MoO3 into the wall structure of the SBA-15 pores, since they were intensified and showed higher values of Tw . 3.2.2 Morphological structure The morphological properties of such Mo-SBA-15 catalyst were investigated through the TEM micrographs given in Fig. 3 . The displayed image has strongly matched with the data of the surface area analysis, as previously given, in terms of the detection of a low grade meso-porous structure. In particular, it has been shown that the synthesized Mo-SBA-15 catalyst has hexagonally well-ordered meso-porous channels running along the length of the particles. This in turn confirms the high dispersion of the molybdenum species in the SBA-15 channels due to the decomposition and removal of the template which was used during the preparation procedures. No dense phases or MoO3 crystallites have been detected in the external surface of SBA-15 particles which in fact is in a good harmony with the XRD result (Fig. 1). In order to confirm the presence of the Mo within the structure of the catalyst, the elemental EDX analysis was carried out for the same spot of the TEM micrograph. The peaks of the elements which were detected in the specimen are exhibited in Fig. 3. Highly intense peaks corresponding to the elemental oxygen have been detected through the tested structure which strongly shows the domination of the oxide formulas along the sample. Several peaks referring to the Mo have been also noticed throughout the displayed EDX spectrum. The existence of the elemental Si can be confirmed via the displayed signals in the given spectrum. The EDX has suggested the following formula: SiO2 and MoO3 to exist in the structure of the synthesized catalyst, based on the wt.% of the detected component as instrumentally calculated."
9,Thermal analysis,"3.3 Thermal analysis Fig. 4 illustrates the DSC and TGA of the obtained catalyst during this research. The MoSBA-15 catalyst showed high thermal stability in terms of the overall weight loss which was obtained at the end of the testing time and at temperatures up to 1000°C. A total weight loss of 17wt.% was obtained however it was only about 11% up to 250°C which is the actual operational temperature during the hydrogen production process. The DSC curve had shown an endothermic peak below 100°C which is strongly matched with the fast mass loss as detected by the TGA thermograph. The endothermic peak can be attributed to the release of the physic-sorbet water at the surface of the catalyst. A shallow endothermic peak relevant to the removal of the chemisorbed water molecules or hydroxyl groups at temperatures between 200 and 400°C was also detected by the DSC. This peak was in practical accompanied by a weight loss of 2wt.%, according to Fig. 4."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.4 Hydrogen production The prepared catalyst, after it was fully characterized, was then subjected to the hydrogen production procedures, as fully illustrated in Section 2.4. Very promising results, in terms of producing good level of the hydrogen gas while using the paraffin wax as a new starting-feedstock, were obtained at the end of this presented work. On the other hand, the in-situ isomerization process which took place, as detected through the structural change of the collected wax after the process, can be counted as another advance of this study. This obviously can initiate a new platform for the wax isomerization process taking into account the absence of applying high pressure and no gases consumption, unlike the conventional methods. In addition, low catalyst-to-feed ratio as well as low operating temperatures is also provided. This in turn can provide a significant reduction in the capitalism of the process since non-severe conditions are imposed. The influence of the several parameters; namely the operational time, catalyst-to-feed ration and temperature, on the hydrogen productivity are discussed throughout this study. 3.4.1 Effect of the processing time The effect of the different operational temperatures on the conversion of the feedstock (finished wax) into gases and carbon structures are exhibited in Fig. 5 a. The values which are labeled as wax content, as shown in Fig. 5a, is referring to the un-changed structure of wax in the feedstock and the isomers of wax that were in-situ obtained within the reaction system during the conversion of the raw feed to gases. Fig. 5b displays the distribution of these wax structures, at each operating time, in terms of their contents of the various paraffin structures. According to Fig. 5a, the conversion of the feedstock into gases and carbon species had shown a strict dependency to the reaction time. In practical, the conversion rates had increased by increasing the operating times. Simultaneously, the percentages of the wax contents were decreasing since a greater portion of the feedstock was turning into gases and carbon materials. This can be attributed to the increment of the contact time between the catalyst and the feedstock, hence a better probability for the interaction to take place. Nevertheless, a non-linear increase in the percentages of both the produced gases and carbon species was detected. The composition of the obtained gases at all the tested times was similar. In particular, a gas composition including 20%, 45% and 35% of hydrogen, methane and C2-C5 gases were observed at all the experiments. This obviously can reflect that the change of the operating time does not impact the composition of the produced gas. This can be referred to the steady number of the catalytic sites that could be provided through the reaction at the different level of times owing to the constant amount of the catalyst. On the other hand, the increased conversion rate of the feedstock into gases by increasing the operational time can also be relevant to the formation of the carbon species in the reaction media. In particular, the accumulation of the carbon particles upon and within the catalyst structure had probably increased the catalyst reactivity via increasing its active surface sites during the reactions. At this stage of testing, 2h was selected as the optimum operating time although it did not show the highest rate of the feedstock-to-gas conversion. This selection had based on the very slight rise in the rate of gas production; specifically 2.5wt.%, as the time increased from 2 to 4h. Accordingly, the operational costs can be reduced via running the process at a shorter time. In reference to Fig. 5b, the structural composition of the collected wax at the different times of testing had also presented strong dependency to the processing time. However, unlike the trend of the feedstock-to-gas conversion, a nearly linear decline in the contents of n-paraffin of the acquired waxes was noticed as the time increased. This was explicitly accompanied with the increase of the iso and cyclo structures of the paraffins content of the acquired products. This can be due to the ability of the Mo-catalyst to impose an in-situ isomerization reaction for the wax feedstock to produce a little bit oily structure of wax; can be categorized as lubricating oil base-stocks. A noteworthy attention could be paid to the iso & cyclo paraffin contents in the product which was obtained out after 4h of reaction, compared to that of after 2h of processing. In particular, an increase of approximately 13wt.% was detected. This in practical is showing a dissimilar trend to that of the noted feed-to-gas conversion rate (Fig. 5a) when the reaction time was elevated by the same interval. This can be explained as a result of the catalyst exploit. The catalyst was probably able to show a proper cracking capability up to 2h however it had got the maximum of its catalytic power limited to that time of running. So that a very slight increase in the percentage of the produced gas was noticed as the processing time was increased up to 4h. On the other hand, the Mo-catalyst had exhibited a continuous increase in its isomerization ability (Fig. 5b) by the time increase. Nevertheless, an outstanding isomerization rate was noticed at the end of 4h of processing. This apparently can be attributed to the change of the catalyst behavior after 2h of reaction to get all of its catalytic power solely paid towards the isomerization route. The increase of the carbon deposits on the catalyst surface during the reaction progress had likely boosted its isomerization activity since further active sites were provided. 3.4.2 Effect of the catalyst-to-feedstock ratio At this stage, the conversion rate of the feedstock to gases was studied under the effect of different catalyst-to-feed ratios while constant operating time and temperature of 2h and 250°C respectively were applied. Fig. 6 a presents the rates of conversion of the feedstock into gases and carbon species as well as the percentages of the cracked wax and the wax isomers; labeled as wax content. Fig. 6b shows the effect of the increase of the catalyst percentages on the content of the different structures of wax namely; n-paraffin and the iso & cyclo paraffin, in the oily fractions that were produced after the wax decomposition process. Similarly to the effect of the operational time, the rate of feedstock conversion to gases and carbon particles had been strongly dependent to the catalyst-to-feed ratio. This can be referred to the increase of the catalytic sites by increasing the catalyst amount, hence a high probability for an efficient cracking of the feedstock to occur. Nevertheless, the carbon formation had exhibited a slightly different attitude compared to that of the gases production. In practical, the gases productivity showed a continuous elevation by increasing the catalyst amount in the reaction system. On the other hand, the accumulation of the carbon deposits was growing as the catalyst content was upturning up to the value of 10wt.%. This was next followed by a noted decrease in the carbon percentage by increasing the catalyst-to-feed ratio to 15wt.%. This decline in the carbon species was accompanied with a remarkable increase in the percentage of the produced gases, Fig. 6a. This can be attributed to the potentiality of a considerable increase of the catalytic sites within the reaction system to the limit at which a high cracking capability of the bigger wax particles could be provided. At the lower catalyst percentages, it could be insufficient catalytic sites to crack the big molecules; hence these molecules have got more tendencies to get carbonized during the offered reaction time. The catalyst-to-feed ratio did not only affect the conversion rate of feedstock into gases but also impacted the composition of the produced gases. In particular, the composition of the acquired gas was 9%, 33% and 58% of hydrogen, methane and C2-C5 gases respectively when a catalyst-to-feed ratio of 2.5wt.% was used. The concentration of both hydrogen and methane was respectively increased to 20% and 45% when the catalyst content was 5wt.%. As the catalyst percentage was elevated to 10wt.%, the hydrogen productivity had also increased to become 35% while the rest of the gas composition was totally methane. At the highest catalyst content, 15wt.%, the composition of the acquired gas had switched to 50:50 of methane and hydrogen. In line with the trend of the carbon particle formation, the content of the paraffin isomers in the gained oily products had been in relevance to the amount of utilized catalyst, Fig. 6b. Particularly, the iso and cyclo paraffins content had increased by the increment of the catalyst-to-feed percentage up to 10wt.%. The Mo-catalyst had then showed a steady state of the isomers content in the obtained oily fraction; at the catalyst-to-feed ratio of 15wt.%. This can be explained as a result of the orientation of the provided catalytic sites, at the offered operating conditions, much more towards the cracking of the high molecular weight molecules in the feedstock rather than the act of the isomerization step. 3.4.3 Effect of the operating temperature In accordance to the data given at the earlier stages of this investigation, the catalyst-to-feed ratio of 15wt.% and the operational timing of 2h have been detected as the optimum condition. These optimal were then introduced at the last stage of investigation while testing the effect of the different temperatures on the conversion of the feedstock to hydrogen. The influence of the different temperatures on the feedstock conversion into gases and the composition of the acquired oily product are shown throughout Fig. 7 . According to Fig. 7a, a high conversion rate; particularly 90%, was detected at the end of this stage when an operating temperature of 300°C was applied. In practical, 60% of the feedstock was converted into gases while carbon species representing 30wt.% of the products was obtained. The given data in Fig. 7a had generally exhibited a continuous significant increase in the percentages of the produced gases by elevating the operating temperature. This was synchronized with a decrease in the amount of the carbon species which were formed. This can be referred to the increased cracking of the high molecular weight molecules of the feedstock which was facilitated by the temperature increase. With regard to the composition of the gained gases, the gas chromatography analysis had shown a gas composition of 40%, 45% and 15% of hydrogen, methane (natural gas) and C2-C5 gases respectively. The gas composition had then changed to become equal percentages of both methane and hydrogen as the temperature was inflated to 250°C. Finally, the hydrogen content in the obtained gas was increased to 70% [mixed with 30% methane] at the operational temperature of 300°C. On the other hand, the characteristics of the produced oily fractions had been strongly affected by the reaction temperature, Fig. 7b. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses which were obtained from the GC, an increase of 15% in the Iso & cyclo-paraffin content was observed by increasing the temperature from 200 to 250°C. A decrease of 4.5% in the content of the paraffin isomers was then detected when the temperature was elevated to 300°C. This can apparently show a remarkable reduction in the catalyst ability to implement the isomerization process at such a high temperature. This reduced activity as well as the high conversion rate of feed to gas, as noted from Fig. 7a, can be due to the catalyst behavior. In particular, the execution of the process at 300°C had highly likely stimulated the catalyst selectivity towards the cracking behavior rather than the isomerization one. This had subsequently assisted in the cracking the large molecules in the feedstock and probably the conversion of a part of the produced methane into hydrogen. At the end of the 3 stages of investigation, a promising level of the hydrogen and methane productivity was obtained. In particular, 42 and 18wt.% of the feedstock was converted to hydrogen and methane respectively at the optimum conditions; namely running time of 2h, 15wt.% as the catalyst-to-feed ratio and 300°C. This in turn can reflect the good value of the presented study in terms of producing two fuel gases, real sources for energy. The obtained gas mixture can be easily separated either via using selective nano-porous material, as a gas adsorbent, or by using membrane reactor as reported by El Naggar and his co-worker [2–4]. Nevertheless, the acquired gas mixture can be directly used to produce energy, electricity in particular, by getting this mixture introduced to a power generator combustion engine. From the economical perspective, the presented work can be highly advantageous in reference to the production of marketable gases while using a low valued feedstock. On the other hand, both the oily fractions and the carbon species which were obtained as side products of the hydrogen production process can be also commercially used. In conclusion, the displayed results through this study however are highly satisfying; some further investigations are currently being done by the authors of this research work. The aim of these extra investigations is to improve the process quality and to obtain higher hydrogen yield via using different nano-structured materials. 3.4.4 Hydrogen production comparability At the completion of the aforementioned levels of investigation, the hydrogen productivity by the prepared Mo-catalyst and by two commercial catalysts, as stated in Section 2.4, was studied on a comparative basis. This was necessary in order to deeply understand the chemistry of combining both the molybdenum oxide and silica in one structure, as introduced during this work. The commercial MoO3 and silica were used on individual basis in order to find out about their capabilities in producing hydrogen, as designated in this work. At this stage, the optimum operating conditions which had been previously determined through Sections 3.4.1–3.4.3 were applied for the three tested catalysts. However, in order to get clear findings, similar amounts (in grams) of either the commercial silica or MoO3 corresponding to those contented in the case of the Mo SBA-15 were utilized. The weight of the feedstock in these three experiments was kept the same as in the corresponding experiment during the stages of this study. The hydrogen productions by the three catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The commercial silica had shown a low level of the hydrogen production, particularly 6.5wt.% of the original feedstock while it showed a reasonable feed-to-gas conversion rate of 30wt.%. On the other hand, hydrogen productivity of 19wt.% (in reference to the original feed) and a total feed-to-gas conversion rate corresponds to 48wt.% were observed, using the commercial MoO3. In comparison to the hydrogen yield which was obtained at the same conditions via using Mo SBA-15, the two commercials showed lower levels of productivity. In addition, both the commercial catalysts did not show high rates of the feed-to-gas conversion, compared to Mo SBA-15. This obviously displays less efficient outcomes of the wax decomposition process when the molybdenum oxide and silica were used on a separate basis. In the case of the commercial MoO3, the interaction had probably occurred on the basis of its high cracking power. On the other hand, although that the silica suffers of the lack of the highly effective cracking sites, the interaction had likely undergone due to its good adsorption capacity. This had in turn attracted the molecules of the feedstock to the surface of silica; hence a cracking activity was provided. This in conclusion can exhibit the good benefit of combining both MoO3 and SiO2 in one structure, as introduced in this study. The combination of both oxides could provide better activity towards the hydrogen production since each of them has got a certain power as an individual compound."
11,Mechanism of hydrogen production,"3.5 Mechanism of hydrogen production In the present work, from the distribution of products it can be explicitly noticed that the catalytic decomposition of the wax feedstock had involved cracking, and isomerization stages. In particular, both cracking and isomerization often require acid sites. Therefore, the SBA frame-worked MoO3 has showed a good cracking and isomerization ability owing to the presence of the SiO2 (SBA); an acidic oxide and has got an acidic nature, in the main structure of the catalyst. In addition, the presence of some hydroxyl groups, as detected by the thermal analysis (see Fig. 4), has likely contributed in enhancing the cracking and isomerization capability of the MoO3 SBA-15. This can be referred to the increment of the active sites in the catalyst structure due to the presence of the hydroxyl groups; considering that these groups are corresponding to Bronsted acids. The following mechanism might apply for the catalytic decomposition of wax: C n H 2 n + 2 + MoO 3 -SBA 15 → C n - x H 2 ( n - x ) + 2 + C x H 2 x C x H 2 x + MoO 3 -SBA 15 → C x - y H 2 ( x - y ) + C y H 2 y - 2 + H 2 C n - x H 2 ( n - x ) + 2 + MoO 3 -SBA 15 → C n - x - z H 2 ( n - x - z ) + 2 + CH 4 CH 4 + MoO 3 -SBA 15 → C ( nano-carbon ) + 2 H 2 C n H 2 n + 2 + MoO 3 -SBA 15 + C → C n + 1 H 2 ( n + 1 ) The Mo-SBA-15 catalyst showed better performance than the commercial MoO3. This has been due to the good dispersion of the Mo oxide within the SBA 15 structure as a result of the incorporation of the Mo in the framework. The incorporation of the molybdenum oxide within the SBA might generate new active sites, as detected by the XRD pattern. Specifically, 2 peaks were noticed at 2θ of 1.6 and 1.9 (Fig. 1) which basically does not exist in the structure of the pure SBA 15 (Fig. S1). In addition, the calculation of the hexagonal unit cell (ao ) of the Mo-SBA-15 was found to be ca 1.3nm higher than that of the pure SBA15 structure (see Table S1 - supporting information). The noticed expansion in the unit cell is due to the incorporation of Mo into the silica framework by which a new phase had probably created. The generated new phases and active sites may be the responsible for the enhanced catalytic exploit by the prepared material compared to the commercial catalysts."
12,Carbon species evaluation,"3.6 Carbon species evaluation The carbon particles which were obtained at the optimum conditions by the end of the reported process throughout this study were a subject of analysis by Raman spectroscopy, XRD and TEM. The obtained carbon species, as visually inspected, were accumulated upon the utilized catalyst while no carbon species were dispersed within the processing vessel. The Raman and XRD pattern of the spent catalyst are exhibited in Fig. 9 while the TEM micrographs of the acquired carbon are shown in Fig. 10 . The Raman spectrum (Fig. 9a) had exhibited three sharp peaks centered between 1300 and 1600cm−1 which are indicative to the formation of nano-particles of the carbon species. Fig. 9b had exhibited the XRD spectrum of the spent catalyst in which two sharp intense peaks at 2θ of 21 and 23 were detected. These peaks are strongly reflecting the presence of highly crystalline carbon deposits attached with the Mo-SBA structure. The absence of the peaks which are indicative to the original catalyst is confirming the domination of the carbon structure in the spent catalyst. This also might demonstrate the existence of the carbon deposits in large quantities; layered over the SBA structure, as prior discussed and confirmed through Figs. 5–7. The detection of such quantities of the carbon deposits onto the spent catalyst is referred to the elevated cracking ability of the utilized catalyst (Mo-SBA 15) during this research work. The structure of carbon deposits within the bulk of the spent catalyst is displayed in Fig. 10 through the TEM images. The given TEM images had also confirmed the formation of such nano-carbon structures within the interior of the spent catalyst. In particular, the TEM images show a morphological structure of well-ordered layered sheets with inner channels of 5nm width. In reference to Fig. 3, the morphology of the detected carbon deposits has been similar to that of the freshly prepared catalyst. This in fact can reflect that the carbon species had been typically deposited within as well as onto the channels of the catalyst. This in turn can show the dominant effect of catalyst morphology upon the structure of the formed carbon; a similar structure was obtained. The detection of the carbon species at the surface of the spent catalyst, according to the Raman analysis, and the domination of the carbon deposits within its structure (XRD and TEM results) can explain the presence of large quantities of carbon, compared to the start weight of the fresh catalyst. In general, the formation of carbon deposits during the wax decomposition (at the different parameters which were tested) had highly likely affected the catalyst activity in a positive way. Particularly, the accumulation of the carbon species within the catalyst structure might increase the adsorption ability of the catalyst via enhancing the surface active area of the catalyst, hence high cracking power can be provided. Moreover, the presence of the carbon deposits has contributed in the wax structure change by the formation of various aliphatic structures as well as the paraffinic cyclo and straight chain isomers."
13,Conclusion,"Molybdenum-containing SBA-15 materials have been prepared using a co-condensation method with a wide range of metal loadings under acidic conditions and by using non-ionic surfactants. The structure of the prepared catalyst was firmly confirmed and identified throughout different tools of analysis. The prepared catalyst showed high-quality structural characteristics as well as a good catalytic activity towards the conversion of solid waxy feedstock into several products namely; hydrogen, methane, nano-carbon species and oily-like lube base-stock. From the economical point of view, the stated process through this work can be of a high interest on the industrial scale owing to the considerable operational costs and the versatile products that can be simultaneously obtained. In particular, low operational temperature is used during the designed process in this work while taking into account that no pressure is applied. On the other hand, all the obtained products are valuable and marketable which can be advantageous in several fields, such as energy production and lubrication purposes."
