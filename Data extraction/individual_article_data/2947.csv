0,Introduction,"The development of heterogeneous catalysts with the possibility of facile separation and recycling increase in their catalytic activity, as minimization of undesired toxic wastes have increasingly gained attention. Selective oxidation of organic compounds are important from both industrial and green chemistry and play a crucial role in organic chemistry. In particular, the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones and sulfide to sulfoxide has been widely investigated. Recently, a large number of oxidants such as copper (II) phthalocyanine [1], zirconium tetrachloride [2], Fe3O4/PEG-SO3H [3], o-methyl-substituted IBX [4], HNO3/FeBr3 [5], heteropolyacids [6], Triflic Anhydride [7], VO(acac)2 [8], PMI-Ru [9], CoFe2O4@glycine-M [10], CoFe2O4@SiO2‐CPTES‐Guanidine‐Cu(II) [11] Fe3O4@MCM-41@VO-SPATB [12], Co(III)@Fe3O4@SiO2 salen complex [13] etc. have been applied in this area. Due to the several disadvantages, such as high activity, hazardous volatility, the bromine as an efficient catalyst [14–17] has been reported for a wide range of oxidation reactions but nowadays its application has been restricted. Therefore, the introduction of the new sources of bromine with the lack of mentioned problems is necessary [18,19]. Organic N-Br reagents which had been reported for the in situ generation of Br+ [20–22] are as N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) [23,24], 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBH) [25], 2,4,4,6-tetrabromohexa-2,5-dienone (TBCO) [26–28], pyridinium tribromide [16] and poly(1-vinyl-3-dodecylimidazolium tribromide)/TBN [29], Br3-TEDETA@Boehmite [30]. These reagents had been used as efficient oxidizing agents for the various oxidation reactions. Nevertheless, production of hazardous compounds or stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding organic wastes is inevitable when the above-mentioned reagents are used. Moreover, final products must be purified by using column chromatography because of the solubility of the reagents in the common organic solvents. In the past decades, metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) as the efficient biomimetic catalysts with a high potential oxidation have been extensively reviewed due to their rather cheap, facile preparation in a large scale, thermal and chemical stability and easy access [31–34]. In addition, poor solubility of metallophthalocyanines in common organic solvents can be considered as the most prominent point in their applications as the heterogeneous catalysts. Regarding to the outlook of chemical processes is moving towards the goal of green chemistry principles, the design, synthesis, and applications of safe and recyclable catalysts have been the serious challenges for chemists and chemical engineers since many years ago. As a result, rational design, synthesis and applications of the new heterogeneous and reusable metallophthalocyanine-based molten salt which is susceptible for in situ generation of bromium (Br+) are our main interest. Thus, pyridiniumporphyrazine as a subclass of phthalocyanine (Pc) aza analogs in which all four benzene rings are replaced by pyridines was synthesized on the first step (Scheme 1 ). Then novel nano molten salt N-bromo tetra-2,3-pyridiniumporphyrazinato oxo-vanadium tribromomethanide [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized (Scheme 2 ) and applied for the selective oxidation of sulfides and benzyl alcohols to their corresponding sulfoxides and aldehydes via in situ generation of Br+ in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidant at room temperature."

Solvents were dried, distilled and stored over molecular sieves. All known compounds were identified by comparing their melting points and spectral data with those reported in the literature. Progress of the reactions was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel F254 plates. Melting points were measured with a Thermo Scientific apparatus. Centrifugation procedures were carried out in an Anke TDL80-2B. Fourier transform-infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spectrometer 17,259 using KBr disks. Ultraviolet–visible spectra were investigated using a Perkin-Elmer UV–Vis Spectrophotometer 35. The samples (10 mg) for UV–Vis study were prepared in aqueous ethanol solutions (EtOH/H2O: 10/1) by dispersing process.

3,General procedure for the synthesis of a [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3,"2.2 General procedure for the synthesis of a [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 [VO(TPPA)] was prepared via the procedure described by Yokote et al. [35] Urea (13 g, 2/145 mol), ammonium molybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O] (92 mg, 0.074 mmol), 2,3-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid (2 g, 11.96 mmol), and V2O5 (200 mg, 10.99 mmol) were mixed under solvent-free condition until a homogeneous mixture was achieved. The mixture was placed in a heating mantle, sealed and heated at 200–210 °C for 5 h. Then, the mixture was cooled up to the room temperature. The crude blue solid product (8.93 g) was crushed and washed repeatedly with warm water (80 °C), a warm aqueous NaOH solution (5% w/v), warm water, a warm diluted aqueous hydrochloric acid (2.5% v/v), and warm water respectively. Finally, the obtained crude product was dried at 100 °C under vacuum and purified by dissolving in concentrated sulphuric acid and then pouring into ice-water. The precipitated product was collected via centrifugation (ca. 200 rpm /10 min) and transferred to a fine sinter glass funnel where the mass was carefully washed with hot water, a warm aqueous sodium carbonate solution and finally with warm water. [VO(TPPA)] was dried at 100 °C under vacuum (isolated yield 65%; M.p.: 288–290 °C) (Scheme 1). The vanadium content of the [VO(TPPA)] was measured using ICP analysis, which showed value of about 1.251 wt%. In the next step, to a round-bottomed flask (50 mL) including a solution of tetrabromomethane (4 mmol; 1.327 g) in CH3CN (20 mL), [VO(TPPA)] (1.251 mg) was added and stirred over a period of 5 h under reflux conditions[36]. The achieved greenish blue solid [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 product was washed three times with diethyl ether (3 × 5 mL), and then dried under vacuum (isolated yield 91%) (Scheme 1). [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 was fully characterized by UV–Vis, FT-IR, elemental analysis (CHN), ICP, EDX, TGA, DTG, SEM and TEM."

At the end of reaction, the catalyst was filtered and the solvent was evaporated to afford the crude sulfoxide product. Finally, the product was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane (1.5:8.5) as eluent to give methyl phenyl sulfoxide as a white solid in 93% yield."

7,Results and discussion,"Scientific-based development of solid and stable bromine sources are in great demand. As part of our interest on developing of efficient and convenient methods and exploring applications of reagents for in situ generation of bromium (Br+) [37–39], metallophthalocyanine-based catalysts [40–42], and chemo and homo selective oxidation [43–48] herein, we would like to synthesis, heterogeneous bromo catalyst for in situ generates Br+ to prevent using various substrate for production of these species, and avoid using bromine as a starting material. Therefore, phthalocyanine with thermal and chemical stability and low solubility was chosen accordingly. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an eco-friendly oxidant for the selective oxidation of sulfides and benzylic alcohols to their corresponding sulfoxides and aldehydes respectively in the presence of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 as a reusable catalyst at room temperature (Scheme 2)."
8,Characterization of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3,"3.1 Characterization of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 [VO(TPPA)] was prepared by the process which is described by Yokote et al. [35], using urea, tetrahydrated ammonium molybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O], 2,3-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid and vanadium pentaoxide. Then, [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 was prepared by refluxing [VO(TPPA)] with tetrabromomethane in acetonitrile as the solvent. Characterization of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 was carried out using various techniques such as UV–Vis, FT-IR, ICP, EDX, TGA, DTG, XRD, SEM, and TEM. 3.1.1 UV–Vis analysis UV–Vis spectra of [VO(TPPA)] and [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 in ethanol are shown in Fig. 1 . The Q band of [VO(TPPA)] is observed at 831 nm. A clear absorbance which is located at 381 nm is attributed to the B band. Also, the band at 591 is probably due to charge transfer (Fig. 1). We followed the appearance in UV–Vis spectra after conversion of [VO(TPPA)] to [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3. The blue-shift at ∼110 nm of the Q band and its split has been attributed to [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3. Moreover, the bands at 652 and 572 have been completely disappeared. According to these observations synthesis of porphyrazine molten salt was confirmed. 3.1.2 FT-IR results FT-IR spectra of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 is shown in Fig. 2 . the absorption bands at 654 cm−1 and 997 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibrational modes of VO and also the absorption bands at 697 cm−1 and 654 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrational modes of NBr and CBr. The absorption bands at 1690 cm−1 and 1498 cm−1 are considered to CN, and CC stretching, respectively. Also, the absorption bands at 3313 cm−1, 3069 cm−1 and 2920 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibrational modes of NH in pyridinium ring. The correct synthesis of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 was proven by comparing of FT-IR results of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] and starting materials. 3.1.3 CHN and EDX data Elemental analysis from the synthesized catalyst [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] are presented in Table 1 . The anticipated elements in the structure of these compounds are C, H and N. The EDX spectrum of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 shows the presence of the expected elements in the structure of this compound. The results are as follows: C (37%), N (29.18%), V (4.24%), Br (7.64%) within the [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and synthesis of the catalyst is approved as it is illustrated in Fig. 3 . 3.1.4 TG study TGA and DTG analysis of [VO(TPPA)] and [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 are shown in (Fig. 4 a and b). Based on the TGA curve of [VO(TPPA)] and [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 profile the first mass loss of below the 100 °C is related to the residual physisorbed water and organic solvents which have been used for the preparation of catalyst (Fig. 4, a and b). The second mass loss around 300 °C is related to [VO(TPPA)], and at much lower temperature and in two steps related to [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3. The DTG analysis diagrams display a general negative downward slope between 25 °C and 600 °C in which, decomposition of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3, [VO(TPPA)] and their precursor in nitrogen atmosphere were exothermic. The comparison between the TGA and DTG results of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] can be the demonstrative evidence for the correct synthesis of the catalyst. 3.1.5 Morphological features The particle size, shape and morphology of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] were investigated by XRD, SEM and TEM analysis (Figs. 5–7 ). The X-ray diffraction patterns of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] are shown in Fig. 5. Scherrer equation [D = Kλ/(β cosθ)] can estimate the average crystalline size of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)]. On the other hand the averaged inter planar distance of these compounds were calculated according to the Bragg equation: dhkl = λ /(2 sinθ) and summarized in Table 2 . Investigation of patterns of XRD for [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 and [VO(TPPA)] which are results of XRD analysis, can be confirmed the successful synthesis of the catalyst. Morphological properties and surface texture of the catalyst were studied and presented by SEM in Fig. 6. According to the SEM analysis, the morphology of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 is fibrillar with appropriate monodispersity. Also, the particle size of this compound has been calculated between 30 and 36 nm."
9,Application of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 in the oxidation reactions,"3.2 Application of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 in the oxidation reactions 3.2.1 Oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxids At the beginning, we made a conscious effort to develop a heterogeneous catalytic system for the oxidation of sulfides. For this purpose, oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide was chosen as a model reaction and different reaction parameters such as solvent, amount of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide were studied. The best results are summarized in Table S1. As, it can be seen in Table S1, 10 mg of catalyst, and 6 mmol of H2O2 were used for oxidation reaction of methyl phenyl sulfide to its corresponding sulfoxide successfully in acetonitrile at room temperature (Scheme 3 ). Therefore, we decided to apply [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 protocol for the selective oxidation of a wide range of sulfides (1) to their corresponding sulfoxides (2). According to the obtained results that are collected in Table 3 , the procedure is general and effective. The most important advantage of this catalyst is selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and lack of the over-oxidation to their corresponding sulfones (Scheme 4 ). On the other word, the described system has an appropriate chemoselectivity. In order to prove this claim, substrates with various functional groups such as COOCH3, COOH, OH, pyridine and carbon–carbon double bond were applied for the oxidation reaction. The result of the reaction confirmed this fact that only oxidation of sulfur atom occurred without any extra structural changes in their other functional groups (Scheme S1). To investigate the reusability of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3, the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture and washed with CH3CN. The catalyst was capable of being applied in 6 cycles for the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide to its corresponding sulfoxide without any loss of catalyst activity (Fig. 8 ). SEM and EDX of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 after the sixth run, confirmed the stability of its structure in the course of reaction and during the recycling procedure (Fig. 9 ). There was also no change in the morphology and size during the reaction. A proposed mechanism for the oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide is shown in Scheme 5 . The catalyst acts as a N-bromo reagent for in-situ generation of Br+. Sulfide attacks to the Br+ and the S-Br bond is formed. After adding H2O2 and going through the unstable species II, the desired sulfoxide was formed. 3.2.2 Oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes After the successful oxidation of a series of sulfide with high efficiency and selectivity, the catalytic activity of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 was also investigated for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. In order to optimize the oxidation conditions, we investigated the oxidation of benzyl alcohols as a model substrate in various conditions (different temperatures, amounts of catalyst and solvents). As indicated in Table S2 the best results in terms of reaction time and yield are obtained when 5 mg of the catalyst, 6 mmol of H2O2 and acetonitrile as a solvent are applied at room temperature (Scheme 6 ). As it can be seen in Table S2, 5 mg of the catalyst and 6 mmol of H2O2 provided oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehyde successfully in acetonitrile at room temperature. Based on the results which are indicated within the Table 4, similar reactions were used for a series of benzyl alcohol derivatives. The results are presented in Table 4 . According to the results which are summarized in Table 4, the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol derivatives to the corresponding aldehydes was done well. Also, in order to investigate the chemoselectivity in the oxidation of various alcohols, aliphatic primary, secondary and benzylic alcohol have been examined using the described reaction conditions. The oxidation reaction appears to be selective for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols, and aliphatic primary and secondary hydroxyl group remained intact during the reaction under the optimized conditions (Scheme 7 ). Based on our observations, the proposed mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is as following. At the beginning, the electron lone pair of oxygen attack to the catalyst and O-Br band (I) is formed. After adding H2O2 and eliminating of HOBr and going through the unstable species (II), the intermediate III undergoes degradation to form the corresponding aldehyde VI (Scheme 8 ). Reusability and recyclability of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 is one of the most important advantages which makes catalyst useful for the commercial applications. In this regard, the nano catalyst was examined in subsequent catalytic cycles using benzyl alcohol as a substrate. After completion of the oxidation, the catalyst was filtered carefully, washed with acetonitrile and finally dried. This process was repeated six more times, giving the desired products in good yields without any significant loss of its initial catalytic reactivity (Fig. 10 ). The simple experimental and product isolation procedures, ease of recovery and reusability in the reaction medium is anticipated to contribute to the progress of a green method for this reaction. In order to showing, the role of Br+ in the N-Br catalyst, ([VO(TPPABr)]CBr3) and [VO(TPPA)] were used in the oxidation reaction for a model substrate. The results demonstrate that the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl alcohols using [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 as a catalyst carried out with higher efficiency and shorter reaction time than [VO(TPPA)] under the same conditions. The results are presented in the Table 5 . In another study, to show the efficiency of the [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3, methyl phenyl sulfide was subjected to the oxidation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of CBr4, 6 mmol of H2O2 and CH3CN as a solvent at room temperature but the reaction did not proceed even after 2 days (Scheme 9 )."
10,Comparison with other catalysts for the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl alcohol,"3.3 Comparison with other catalysts for the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl alcohol In order to evaluate the catalytic reactivity of [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3, the results were compared for the oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl alcohols with other those previously reported methods in the literature. The results are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 has uniquely enhanced the synthesis of desired product in different terms such as: reaction time, amount of catalyst and isolated yield. As depicted, it can be deduced that the previously reported methods suffer from elevated temperatures, longer reaction times, or harsh reaction conditions (Table 6)."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, [VO(TPPABr)]CBr3 as a novel nano N-bromo porphyrazine based molten salt [N-bromo tetra-2,3-pyridiniumporphyrazinato oxo-vanadium tribromomethanide] with a central transition metal has been synthesized for the first time and applied as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for chemo and homoselective oxidation of sulfides and benzyl alcohols to their corresponding sulfoxides and benzaldehydes respectively. This N-Br porphyrazine molten salt as a heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized without handling the hazardous compounds or producing the corresponding organic wastes which are soluble in organic solvent. The synthesized catalyst and reported procedures offer various advantages, such as ease of handling and non-toxicity, simple recovery, wide functional group tolerance, high reaction rates and yields, chemo and homoselective oxidation of sulfides and benzyl alcohols without over oxidation and use of a stable and recyclable catalyst."
