0,Introduction,"Accompanied by a decline in world petroleum reserves, the increase in prices of the conventional petroleum fuels and restrictions on exhaust emissions from internal combustion (IC) engines triggered by environmental concerns, there is an urgent need for suitable alternative fuels for use in diesel engines [1–7]. Diesel engines are indispensable equipment in transport, agriculture and power generation sectors for their higher fuel conversion efficiency, higher power output and higher torque capability compared to gasoline engines [8,9]. However, the main problem associated with diesel engines is that they are the major sources of NOx and smoke. The combustion of petroleum fuels significantly increases the CO2 in the atmosphere. The utilization of fuels derived from renewable sources is one of the ways to reduce the emissions of Nox, smoke, and CO2 [10]. Alcohols, biomass based fuels, either single or blended with conventional petroleum based fuels are the most important alternative fuels for internal combustion engines [3,11]. Alcohol fuels such as methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), propanol (C3H7OH), butanol (C4H9OH) and pentanol (C5H11OH) could be used with fossil-based fuels in various percentages for diesel engines as a clean alternative fuel source [12,13]. Among of them, low carbon alcohols like methanol and ethanol were extensively researched in spark-ignition engines due to their better anti-knock characteristics and low CO and UHC emissions [14]. Methanol can be produced from coal or petrol based fuels with low cost production, but it has a restrictive solubility with diesel fuel. Ethanol is a biomass-based renewable fuel, which can be produced by alcoholic fermentation of sugar from vegetable materials, such as corn, sugar cane, sugar beets, barley, sweet sorghum, cassava, molasses, etc. Meantime, ethanol can also be obtained by agricultural residues, such as straw, feedstock and waste woods by using already improved and demonstrated technologies [15]. While ethanol was successfully blend with gasoline in spark-ignition engines [16,17], and had the advantage over methanol of higher miscibility with the diesel fuel, but there were still some drawbacks of using ethanol in compression-ignition engines [17–21], as shown in the follows. 1. Ethanol has limited solubility in diesel fuel. Phase separation and water tolerance in ethanol–diesel blend fuel are crucial problem, especially at lower temperatures. 2. Ethanol fuel has an extremely low cetane number, whereas the diesel engine is preferred to high cetane number fuels which makes auto-ignition easily and gives small ignition delay. 3. The dynamic viscosity of ethanol is much lower than that of diesel fuel, so that the lubricity is a potential concern of ethanol–diesel blend fuel. 4. Ethanol has much lower flash point than diesel fuel and higher vapor formation potential in confined spaces, thus requiring extra precautions to ensure safe handling and use of these blends. Recently, higher carbon alcohols such as propanol, butanol and pentanol are gathering attention because of their advantages over the low carbon alcohols, and therefore, having more potential in being the next generation biofuel [13,22,23]. Generally, propanol, butanol and pentanol have higher cetane numbers, calorific values, viscosities, flame speeds while having lower latent heat of evaporations, ignition temperatures and corrosion risks when compared to low carbon alcohols. Moreover, these higher alcohols can easily be blended with diesel without any phase separation which is contributed to their high carbon content, low polarity, and less hygroscopic nature [13]. In addition, flash points of higher alcohols are quite high which makes them safer to store, handle and deliver in the existing distribution infrastructure. Though longer chain alcohols have less oxygen content, they can still enhance the premixed combustion phase with their relatively longer ignition delay allowing sufficient mixing of air/fuel and also improve the diffusion combustion phase. Furthermore, alcohols with longer carbon chains consume lesser energy during its production when compared to other lower carbon alcohols since the biological process of breaking down macromolecules can stop earlier and save more energy [24,25]. Propanol, a three carbon alcohol, has less affinity for water in comparison to methanol and ethanol. It has two isomers, namely n-propanol and iso-propanol, respectively. Propanol can be produced from feedstocks such as biomass or municipal solid waste. These feedstocks are gasified into syngas (CO, H2 and CO2) and then converted into biofuels using microbial catalysts such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium ragsdalei. However, microbial production of propanol from Clostridium species via, threonine catabolism or from yeast in beer fermentation yielded only very small quantities of less than 70 mg/L. There is also no existing micro-organism that can naturally produce propanol from glucose in substantial quantities. Therefore, researchers have turned to bio-synthetic pathways to produce industry-relevant quantities of propanol from Escherichia coli, a microorganism that can be easily manipulated than the traditional complex Clostridium species. Recently several biochemical, genetic, and metabolic engineering strategies are being devised to enhance the coproduction of n-propanol and ethanol from a novel engineered Escherichia coli [24]. Propanol is used as a solvent to bind lower alcohols with diesel and also as a blending component with diesel fuel in diesel engine. There are relatively few researches about using propanol for blending with diesel fuel. The current limited study works found that the blends of propanol and diesel showed longer ignition delay, higher rates of heat release and pressure rise. The thermal efficiency of the engine decreased marginally with the use of fuel blends. The blends of propanol and diesel decreased the CO, Nox and smoke emissions of the engine considerably [26,27]. Butanol is also a biomass based renewable fuel that can be produced by fermentation of biomass, such as algae, corn, and other plant materials containing cellulose that can not be used for food and otherwise go to waste. There exists four isomers based on the location of the hydroxyl group (–OH) and carbon chain structure, namely n-butanol, sec-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol. Four isomers have the same formula and heating value but have different molecular structures that affect the physicochemical properties of isomers such as solubility. In addition, their production methods are different, butanol production from biomass tends to yield mainly straight chain molecules [12]. Among of those four isomers, n-butanol seems to be a very strong alcohol competitor using in diesel engines, because it does not suffer from the same drawbacks as ethanol. Butanol is of particular interest as a renewable bio-fuel as it is less hydrophilic and it possesses higher heating value, higher cetane number, lower vapor pressure, and higher miscibility than ethanol. Thus, the problems associated with ethanol as a diesel fuel, mentioned previously, are solved to a considerable extent as using n-butanol, which makes fuel properties much closer to diesel fuel than ethanol [28–31]. A lot of study works had been conducted on engines fueling the blends of butanol/diesel and these results presented that lower Nox and soot emissions and higher thermal efficiency with the addition of butanol [28–31]. Pentanol, a long-chain alcohol contains five-carbon structure, which has eight isomers. Pentanol being an alcohol with longer carbon chains also consumed lesser energy during its production when compared to other lower alcohols [32]. In last decade, many research groups and bio-technology companies pay more attention to increase the yield of higher alcohols like butanol and pentanol from cellulose by modern fermentation processes using new strains of Clostridium species and by biosynthesis from glucose using genetically engineered micro-organisms like Escherichia coli, Cyanobacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There is also an alternative route in which biomass can be gasified or steam-reformed or partially oxidized to produce synthesis-gas (CO, H2 and CO2) which can be catalytically converted into higher alcohols by a process called higher-alcohol synthesis (HAS) [24]. Compared to other short-chain alcohols, pentanol has higher energy density, larger cetane number, better blend stability and less hygroscopic nature. These advantages make pentanol very competitive as an alternative fuel in diesel engines [31,33–35]. It was found that the blends of n-pentanol and diesel had an obvious advantage over neat diesel fuel in reducing the Nox emissions, particulate mass and number concentration, and increasing the brake thermal efficiency [36,37]. Even if alcohol is a renewable fuel for blending with diesel fuel, the separation and purification of the alcohols from solution by fermentation is of great economic significance. For example, butanol is a long chain carbon saturated alcohol with higher boiling point, lower saturated vapor pressure, and its volatility is much lower compared to water under the same conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to use the traditional distillation method to separate butanol from water. If alcohol and diesel blending system can contain part of water, a lot of energy will be saved during the alcohol production process. Moreover, alcohols are more hygroscopic than diesel fuel, it may occur during the storage and carriage if the tank is not adequately sealed, the blends of alcohols and diesel fuel would absorb water from ambient humidity [38]. It has been demonstrated that excessive water concentration in the blends will cause phase separation [39]. So it is important to test the blends of alcohols and diesel for their capacity to hold water without phase separation. However, little study has been undertaken to systematically investigate the maximum allowable water concentration of alcohols (propanol, butanol, pentanol) and diesel blends. On the other hand, the characteristics of combustion and emissions using the blends of alcohols and diesel fuel have been widely studied and all of these studies think the blends are total solubility under without water addition. However, the systematical study on the solubility of alcohols (propanol, butanol, pentanol) and diesel blends is few but necessary under different ambient conditions to better utilization the blends in engines. Therefore, in the current study work, the mutual solubility between C3-C5 alcohols (including different structure isomers) and diesel fuel were systematically investigated at different ambient temperatures and the allowable water in the system was also presented. This study work is significant to the utilization of C3-C5 alcohols in diesel engines."
1,Experimental setup and methods,"Conventional diesel fuel was purchased by Sinopec Co., Ltd., Beijing Yanshan Branch. The water content of the tested diesel was lower than 0.02 vol% and the ash content was lower than 0.1 wt%, which had little influence on solubility performance. Besides, different carbon-number alcohols were used in this study, which were analytical (AR) grade pure propanol, butanol, pentanol and their isomers. They were propanol (n-propanol, iso-propanol), butanol (n-butanol, iso-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol), pentanol (n-pentanol, iso-pentanol and tert-pentanol), respectively. All of them were received from Real & Lead Chemical Co., Ltd and could ensure the purity over 99.5%. The properties of some representative fuels are shown in Table 1 [40]. In addition, it should be noted that all of these alcohols can be produced by biomass fermentation as beforehand mentioned. The ternary phase diagrams are widely used to depict the phase behavior of three-component system [41]. Phase boundaries were determined using the titration method in this study [42]. Because from low to high proportion alcohol in the blends were carried out in the diesel engine, for example, butanol and diesel blends with 30%[32], 40%[43], 80%[44], and even neat butanol [45–48] were all successfully used in the diesel engine, so the alcohol concentration was chosen from 0 to 90 % in this study. The blend of alcohols and diesel were prepared, and the alcohols concentration ranging from vol.10% to vol.90% in 10 vol% increments. The initial volume of these blends was set to 5 mL and placed into the centrifuge tube, and then water was gradually titrated into the blends by a high-precision pipette until it was no more a homogeneous liquid and the free water occurred at the temperature of the experiment, meaning it happened phase separation. At this moment, the water volume was recorded so as to develop the phase diagram. In order to obtain a blending system rapidly, a vortex mixer with a rotating capacity of 5000 rpm was used. Besides, to study the effect of temperature, four kinds of temperatures were chosen in this research, 0 °C, 30 °C, 50 °C, 70 °C, respectively. These mixtures of alcohols and diesel were placed into a digital constant temperature incubator with 0.1 °C precision. The high-precision pipette was used to add diesel fuel, alcohols and water into the small vessel, the precision of the pipette is 0.1 μL. The following steps were similar to those mentioned above. The experiment was designed as a completely randomized design with three replicates in order to guarantee accuracy. It must be emphasized that the result should be affirmed by observing the ultimate state of any mixture after the long-term (7 days) standing. And the data presented in this paper are the mean values of three independent measurements for each solution investigated. The mixture of diesel and alcohol at any proportion without water was a single phase liquid system and it was homogeneous and clear, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). With the addition of water, when the water concentration exceeded the maximum allowable water concentration, the homogeneous solution was destroyed. And the initial phenomenon was that free water occurred and water droplets percolated to the bottom of the liquid, as shown in Fig. 1(b). If continue to add water, the following phenomenon was the formation the turbid liquid as shown in Fig. 1(c). In this study, the moment was characterized as the separation point when the instant separation of free water occurred. It should be noted that the main purposes of this study was to investigate the capability of alcohols/diesel blends to hold water. In consideration of ethanol and diesel blends would occur phase separation during the transportation, so it was essential to ensure the allowable water concentration in the blends of C3-C5 alcohols and diesel in order to avoid phase separation in the process of transportation and usage. Besides, with the addition of water, the mixture of alcohol and diesel blends would turn to turbid liquid as shown in Fig. 1(c), so the co-solvent was needed to balance the blends, which has been beyond the scope of this research. So the focus of this paper is to study the single phase liquid as shown in Fig. 1(a)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effects of alcohol chain length on phase stability,"3.1 Effects of alcohol chain length on phase stability The phase behavior of three-compound system on diesel, water and three to five carbon numbers alcohols including n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol and iso-propanol, iso-butanol, iso-pentanol have been tested in this section. Fig. 2 presents the solubility of three-compound of diesel, water and alcohols at 0 °C and 30 °C ambient temperatures. In the ternary phase diagram as shown in Fig. 2, each line represents the phase boundary of a single-phase isotropic region from the anisotropic region. Any point below the line would be a single phase and a point above the line would be in an anisotropic state. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the tested six fuels, including n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol, iso-pentanol, can be blended with diesel fuel at any proportion without phase separation under the conditions of without water addition. This is contributed to their high carbon content, low polarity than that of methanol and ethanol. Meantime, it can be also seen that the allowable water concentration increased with the alcohol content increases. Fig. 2(a) shows that the maximum allowable water content in the ternary system including n-butanol is 14.5% as the ambient temperature is 0 °C, while the maximum allowable water content for n-propanol and n-pentanol is 3.22% and 5.66%, respectively. The alcohols with branched chain have the similar tendencies, the water allowance in the three component system including iso-butanol is 10.7%, while the water contents for iso-propanol and iso-pentanol are just 2.4% and 5.8% respectively at 0 °C. Fig. 2(b) shows that, at the ambient temperature of 30 °C, the maximum allowable water content for n-butanol (iso-butanol) system is 12.9% (8.4%), while they are 8.26% (8.25%) and 4.76% (4.21%) for both n-propanol (iso-Propanol) and n-pentanol (iso-Pentanol), respectively. Meanwhile, it also observes that the area of soluble liquid phase of butanol-diesel-water system are larger than that of propanol- or pentanol-diesel-water system when the ambient temperature is 0 and 30 °C. In other words, the water concentration admitted by butanol is higher than other alcohols. It also means that the larger amount of propanol or pentanol is required to stabilize the single phase in the same composition of diesel-water system. Butanol has lower polarity than propanol, thus it presents more miscibility with diesel fuels than propanol. However, when longer chain of aliphatic like pentanol was employed, although it has a greater similarity to diesel fuels in physiochemical properties, it is less soluble in water compared to butanol. For example, the water content in pentanol ternary system reduced from 14.5% to 5.66% compare to butanol at 0 °C. Scharnagl et al. [49] have pointed out the smaller alcohol molecular size and higher polarity increased the affinity between alcohols and water, but the affinity with oil was decreased. In consideration of the oil and water amphipathy of alcohol in our study, the four carbon alcohols is the inflection point of alcohol fuels acted as an amphiphile at 0 °C and 30 °C. That is to say, butanols reach a good balance to keep inter-miscibility with diesel and water. Compared with lower carbon alcohols, butanol has better inter-miscibility to diesel fuel due to its higher carbon numbers and lower polarity. Compared with higher carbon alcohols, butanol has better inter-miscibility to water due to its higher affinity to water. This conclusion is constructive to use butanol to blend with diesel or as a co-solvent additive for hydrous alcohol/diesel system. This is the first time to find out four carbon alcohols is the inflection point to be amphiphile in ternary fuel system, and consideration the physicochemical property of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons, the inflection point might be universal rule in the blending fuels. In addition, Fig. 2 also presents the difference of the soluble liquid phase between n-butanol and iso-butanol is larger than that of n-propanol and iso-propanol or that of n-pentanol and iso-pentanol. This means that the different isomers of butanols have larger effects on the ternary phase of diesel-water-alcohol. According to the result of Fig. 2, it can be found that alcohols (propanol, butanol and pentanol) have the ability to hold water in regular diesel. As we known, the water is nearly immiscible in diesel at any temperature because of they have the huge difference in polarity. The addition of alcohols to the diesel/water blend makes water and diesel miscible in each other. This is due to the fact that polarity of alcohols is between diesel and water, the alcohols act as a surface-active agent and the micelles that have nonpolar part (alkyl groups) and polar part (OH groups) are formed. The OH groups have strong affinity with water molecules and nonpolar alkyl groups can be connected with diesel molecules, the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 3 . Diesel and water are attracted to liquid/liquid interfacial films by alcohols and get a clear and one single phase in the end. So the more water is added, the higher amount of alcohols needed. When the desired alcohols concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration, the phase separation occurred in this system [50,51]"
4,Effects of straight and branched chain on phase stability,"3.2 Effects of straight and branched chain on phase stability For the purpose of exploring the effect of functional groups of butanol on phase stability, the ternary systems including diesel, water and different butanol isomers (n-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol) have been tested at 0 °C, 30 °C, 50 °C, 70 °C and the results have been shown in Fig. 5. For tert-butanol, the temperatures (30 °C, 50 °C, 70 °C) were chosen due to the freezing point of tert-butanol is 24.7 °C. It can be observed that all butanol structural isomers can keep the one-phase stability for two-component system in both diesel and butanol at these test temperatures, but the compositions of the three-component system were quite different. The area of one liquid phase including diesel, water and tert-butanol is the largest compared to other systems at any temperature. The maximum water content in ternary system including n-butanol, iso-butanol and sec-butanol obviously decreases by 5.81–10.4%, 10.3–13.5%, 0.7–3.9% at the temperature of 30 °C -50 °C compare to tert-butanol. Besides, taking ambient temperature 70 °C for instance, the area value of the ternary system with tert-butanol as the surfactant is larger about 63%, 76%, 40% than that of other system including n-butanol, iso-butanol and sec-butanol, respectively. Those results indicated that tert-butanol can hold more water in the system with diesel. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon. 1) The physicochemical properties of alcohols such as molecular weight, molecular volumes and molecular structure etc. can influence the stability of the diesel-alcohol-water system, such as the mean-square displacement length and radius of gyration of a molecule based on van der Waals interactions, electrostatic (Coulombic) and torsion interactions [52,53]. The structure of butanol isomers (n-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol) were shown in Fig. 4 . The value of ‹r2›/‹s2› is the physical properties of a molecule, where ‹r2› is the mean squared end-to-end distance (Å2), and ‹s2› is the mean squared radius of gyration (Å2). The ratio of these two parameters can be used to characterize the aspect ratio or linearity of molecules. The lower the ‹r2›/‹s2› value, the less linear the molecular shape is, indicating the molecular is more close to spherical shape [52]. The order of the ‹r2›/‹s2› is tert-butanol < sec-butanol < n-butanol < iso-butanol, presents that the overall molecular length decreases from iso-butanol to tert-butanol. The spherical molecular structure of tert-butanol has the smallest surface compared to other butanol isomers of same volume, because they have the same molecular mass. Therefore, tert-butanol has the smallest surface energy with water molecules compare to other butanol isomers when dispersed in water-diesel system. This is the reason why the ternary system including tert-butanol can hold more water. 2) On the other side, the intermolecular forces especially hydrogen bonding has great effect on water content of this ternary system [52]. From iso-butanol to tert-butanol as shown in Fig. 4, the negative charge density of oxygen atom gradually increases. As a hydrogen bond acceptor, the force of hydrogen atom in water molecule gradually increases, and the enthalpy of solution decreases, resulting in the increase of solubility. From iso-butanol to tert-butanol, the molecular dipole moment increases, and hence the solubility in a solvent of strong dielectric constant increases. Fig. 6 represents the phase behavior of the three-component system including diesel, water and pentanol isomers (n-pentanol, iso-pentanol and tert-pentanol) at ambient temperature of 30 °C. It can be observed that the water is almost insoluble due to the concentration of pentanol is low (10–20%). Meanwhile, to keep the system stability, the blends need more co-solvents with the increase of water fractions for all pentanol isomers, which means the great reliance on the addition of co-solvents. Besides, considering the difference of pentanol isomers, tert-pentanol can hold more water compare to n-pentanol and iso-pentanol. The allowable water concentration of diesel/tert-pentanol is 780 μL, which is increased about 70% compared to the systems of diesel/n-pentanol and diesel/iso-pentanol. These results have similar tendency to butanol isomers and the molecular of tert-pentanol has the smallest surface energy on the surface of water solution making it more soluble with water."
5,Effects of temperature on phase stability,"3.3 Effects of temperature on phase stability Different three to five carbon number alcohols (n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-pentanol, tert-pentanol) are chosen as amphiphile for diesel-water-alcohol ternary system to investigate the ability of water allowance at 0 °C, 30 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C. The area value of soluble liquid phase is calculated from grey region in ternary phase diagrams, using the methods of mathematics integration with the software manned origin and the results are shown in Table 2 . The value of the area can demonstrate the moisture holding capacity in alcohol/diesel blends. It is indicated that temperature shows a significant influence on the phase behavior of three component systems. Interestingly, note that, the water concentration added into the blends of diesel and alcohols gradually decrease except n-propanol, iso-propanol and tert-butanol when the ambient temperature increases from 0 °C to 70 °C. Among of all tested alcohols, the allowable water concentration for sec-butanol and diesel blends decreased about 32%, for the other alcohols (n-butanol, iso-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-pentanol and tert-pentanol) and diesel blends, the water concentration in the systems all decreases over 50%. The reason may be that alcohols belong to nonionic surfactant. The surfactant mainly dissolved in water at lower temperature in nonionic surfactant/water/oil systems, whereas it dissolved in oil at higher temperature [54]. Therefore, the higher ambient temperature results in that these alcohols are more close to oil and not easy to inter-miscibility with water. But for alcohols of n-propanol, iso-propanol and tert-butanol with diesel blends, the allowable water concentration is gradually increased as increasing temperature. The common feature of these three alcohols is that they can be miscible with water with any proportion at the tested temperature in our study, hence the ternary system considers that these resemble binary-liquid system, it means water and alcohol belong to one phase. In ordinary binary-liquid systems, mutual solubility of two phases increased with the increase of temperature and the compositions of the two phase coincided at the critical temperature, at which the interfacial tension between them became zero [55–57]. It can be confirmed that a high ambient temperature plays a positive role for the proper settlement of unstable phases of blends. It should be noted that although there are several study works which added water from 2% to 20% in weight or in volume in diesel fuel to investigate the effects on engine performance [59–62], the addition of water in fuel is not used in real diesel engine because of the challenge on engine reliability. Factually, in real diesel fuel, generally, the water content is no more than 1% in weight. In the current study, even if the water content could reach about 14.5%, it did not mean that the tested fuel could be used in diesel engine directly. In fact, the current study work only wants to reply that, which alcohol has better inter-solubility between C3-C5 alcohols and diesel fuel at different ambient conditions."
6,Conclusions,"A series of three-five carbon numbers alcohols were prepared to blend with diesel at different temperatures to evaluate the ability of the system to hold water. Three detail conclusions are obtained as shown in the following. (1) Alcohols (n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol and iso-propanol, iso-butanol, iso-pentanol) have been tested to investigate the influence the alcohol chain length on solubility. It observes that the four carbon alcohols (n-butanol and iso-butanol) are the inflection point of alcohol fuels when the ambient temperature at 0 and 30 °C. Higher or lower four carbon alcohols have lower solubility on water concentration. (2) Different butanol isomers (n-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol) were used to evaluate the effect of straight and branched chain on phase stability. Tert-butanol can hold more water in the system compared to the other butanol isomers due to its spherical structure. Similar to butanol isomers, the molecular of tert-pentanol has the smallest surface energy on the surface of water solution making it more soluble with water. (3) Four different temperatures (0, 30, 50, 70 °C) were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on phase stability. For alcohols (n-propanol, iso-propanol and tert-butanol) that are miscible with water, the allowable water concentration is gradually increased as increasing temperature. But for the other alcohols tested in this study, the water concentration added into the system gradually decreases with the temperature increases."
