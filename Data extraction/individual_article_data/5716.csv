0,Introduction,"Polymer–clay nanocomposites exhibit remarkably improved thermal or mechanical properties compared to pure polymers and have been used in applications such as mechanically hard coatings in the automotive industry [1]. They are formed by dispersion of the nanometer silicate layers of clays (usually less than 5 wt%) into polymers. The key to formation of nanocomposites with property improvements is to establish strategies that facilitate the dispersion of single silicate layers into the polymer matrix. A common method involves the dispersion of silicate layers into a solvent prior to dispersion into the polymers. Dispersion of layered silicate within solvents affects the structures of the nanocomposites. It has been shown that the level of dispersion was primarily dependent on the interfacial interactions and dipole moment, including the polarity and hydrogen-bonding forces of the solvent molecules [2–10]. n-Alcohol solvents with relatively low toxicity and cheap montmorillonites are potential raw materials for large-scale production of nanocomposite coatings and building materials. In this paper, we carried out a systematic study of the dispersion of the alkylammonium-modified silicate of the natural clay montmorillonite within a series of alcohol solvents. These clays have extensively been used for formation of nanocomposites with various organic polymers [11,12]. However, the influence of the alcoholic solvents on the silicate surface of clays has not been established. To this end, we employed X-ray diffraction, photoemission spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to examine the structural–chemical variation of the layered silicate after being dispersed within a range of n-alcohols."
1,Experimental,"In our experiments, the natural clay sodium montmorillonite has been organically modified via ion-exchange reactions between Na+ on the silicate surface and the alkylammonium functional group N+(CH2CH2OH)2CH3T (T represents predominantly the C18 group). The powder samples of organically modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 30B) were supplied by Southern Clay Products, Inc. They consist of silicate layers, which are regularly stacked along the [001] or out-of-plane direction. For our experiments, the alkyl chain length in the n-alcohol solvents R n OH was varied from 2 to 8. Approximately 0.3 g of Cloisite 30B was added into 30 g of these solvents and the mixtures were stirred or sonicated for approximately 1 h at temperatures between 40 and 60 °C. The mixtures were then centrifuged, the residual solvents were removed and the solids were dried in the air. A polyether polyol (Ariel Industries Pty. Ltd., Australia) was also used as a dispersant for the clay. The dispersion was formed by stirring a suspension containing approximately 6 wt% of Cloisite 30B within these polyols at 80 °C for 24 h. The low-angle X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out using a Philips PW 1825/20 powder diffractometer with an unmonochromated Cu K α source ( λ = 1.5418 Å ). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed using a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer. Pellet samples for the FTIR measurements were prepared using approximately. 1 mg of the clay and 200 mg of dehydrated potassium bromide. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy was examined using a VG ESCALAB 220i XL photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromated Al K α source ( h ν = 1486.6 eV ). Spectra were acquired at the normal incident condition with the photoelectron takeoff axis being perpendicular to the sample surface."
2,Results and discussion,"The dispersive behavior of solvents is best described by their solubility parameter (δ), which consists of three components, the solvent dispersion force ( δ d ), solvent polarity ( δ p ), and hydrogen bonding force ( δ h ) [5,8,13,14]. Table 1 listed the solubility parameters of R n OH solvents as a function of n. As n increased from 2 to 8, δ h decreased from 19.4 to 11.9 MPa1/2 and δ p decreased from 9.0 to 2.5 MPa1/2 [13,14]. Solvents with relatively low polarity and poor hydrogen-bonding force would preferentially interact with the hydrophobic, organically modified surface. We initially examined the dispersion of Cloisite 30B within n-alcohols. After a mixture of Cloisite 30B was stirred or sonicated in ethanol, propanol, or butanol ( n < 5 ), the clays precipitated within a few minutes on standing. In contrast, the mixtures of Cloisite 30B and pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, or octanol ( n ⩾ 5 ) resulted in formation of a stable suspension, in which the solid product remained dispersed for several days. Therefore, the stability of these dispersions increased as solvent polarity and hydrogen bonding forces decreased. Table 1 shows that the dispersion was virtually independent of the solvent dispersion force, which varied slightly ( δ d varied between 15.8 and 17.0 MPa1/2 as n increased from 2 to 8 [13]). X-ray diffraction measurements were used to examine the basal spacing of the layered silicate. Fig. 1 showed the diffraction patterns of Cloisite 30B and the solid products recovered from the mixtures of Cloisite 30B and various n-alcohols. The main peak in the patterns of Cloisite 30B reference was measured as 2 θ ∼ 4.8 ° , attributed to the stacking of the silicate layers along the [001] or out-of-plane direction. The basal distance estimated from the 2θ value was 1.8 nm, which was due to the intercalation of the alkylammonium molecules within the interlayer spaces (the basal distance in the natural montmorillonite was approximately 1.3 nm). The diffraction patterns of the solid products recovered from the dispersion of Cloisite 30B and n-alcohols with n < 5 were very similar. In particular, the main peaks in these patterns were measured between 2 θ ∼ 4.8 ° and 5.0°, similar to that of the Cloisite 30B reference. The above results may be due to the intercalation of n-alcohols (n less than 5) within the interlayer spaces, and they were removed as the products were dried in the air. The XRD patterns changed more significantly as the experiments were carried out using n-alcohols with n greater than 5. In particular, the diffraction patterns of the solid product recovered from the mixture of Cloisite 30B and pentanol showed the presence of two large peaks. The [001] peak was measured at 2 θ ∼ 2.9 ° , corresponding to the expansion of the basal distance to 3.0 nm. This indicated that the pentanol molecules have segregated and intercalated within the interlayer spaces of the silicate layers. An additional broad peak was measured at 2 θ ∼ 5.6 ° with a shoulder at 2 θ ∼ 4.9 ° . The relative intensity of this peak decreased with increasing sonication or stirring time. A more detailed analysis suggested that this broad peak was attributed to the presence of the [002] diffraction and Cloisite 30B, which had not been swollen by pentanol. Fig. 2 showed the correlation of the basal distance with the solvent polarity and hydrogen bonding force of different alcohols. The basal expansion remained approximately 3.0 nm for the alcohols with n ⩾ 5 . The correlation did not follow a linear relationship, but there appeared to be thresholds of δ p between 4 and 6 MPa1/2 and δ h between 14 and 16 MPa1/2. Our experiments showed that the basal distances changed significantly within these thresholds. To better understand the interactions between the layered silicate and n-alcohols, we employed short-range X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The XPS measurements were complementary to extensive FTIR data previously reported for the clays [11,12]. In the XPS survey scan of the Cloisite 30B reference (Fig. 3 ), the binding energy of the O1s photoelectron peak was recorded as 532.0 eV, which was attributed to the presence of the hydroxylated groups and various oxide components within the silicate layers. The Si2p photoelectron peak ( E b = 102.8 eV ) and Al2p peak ( E b = 74.6 eV ) were attributed to the presence of silicon and aluminum oxides as a major component of the layered silicate [15]. The N1s peak ( E b = 401.5 eV ) was due to the ammonium component of the surfactant on the silicate surface. The C1s photoelectron peak ( E b = 285.0 eV ) was predominantly due to the presence of the alkyl chain (CC) of the surfactant. The high-resolution region scan of C1s photoelectrons was shown as the inset of Fig. 3. In addition to the main aliphatic component, the presence of a shoulder at higher binding energy ( E b = 286.6 eV ) was attributed to the CO component of the surfactant. The peaks of Fe 2 p 3 / 2 photoelectrons ( E b = 711.2 eV ) and Auger MgKLL photoelectrons ( E b = 304.1 eV ) were attributed to the minor oxides formed by iron and magnesium. The presence of the NaKLL auger photoelectron peak ( E b = 496.6 eV ) was attributed to the residual Na cations on the silicate surface. The presence of Na ions allows neutralization of the negative charges, created from the ionic substitutions within the silicate lattice (for example, substitution, between Fe2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions). The XPS spectra of the solid products recovered from the dispersion of Cloisite 30B within n-alcohols with n ⩾ 5 were similar to that of Cloisite 30B. Quantitative analysis showed that the chemical composition was remained virtually unchanged. In addition, the XRD patterns of the solids after removal from the ultra-high-vacuum XPS chambers were similar to that of Cloisite 30B (Fig. 4 ). These results suggested that the intercalated n-alcohols were removed under the ultra-high-vacuum conditions. Our FTIR measurements on Cloisite 30B suggested Gauche adsorbed conformers, because of a methylene asymmetric stretch ν as (CH2) at 2921.2 cm−1 (Fig. 5 ) [16]. The schematic of the molecular adsorption was shown in Fig. 6 A. After the intercalation, the alkyl chains of the alcohols ( n ⩾ 5 ) probably remained parallel to the silicate surface. These molecules may be attached to the ammonium surfactants via interactions between the hydrophilic, functional groups or via hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 6B). These results are consistent with the established literature. Vaia et al. systematically examined the ordering of the alkylammonium surfactants and showed that the alkyl chains with n < 9 preferentially remained flat on the silicate surface [17]. Studies of another clay, magadiite, have also shown that the n-alcohol molecules remained parallel to the silicate surface [18]. We subsequently examined the influences of the n-alcohol solvents to the intercalation of polyol (polyether) within Cloisite 30B. Fig. 6 showed the XRD patterns of the solid products recovered from the dispersion of Cloisite 30B into polyol, the products from the dispersion of 30B into pentanol and the products from the dispersion of 30B into pentanol and then polyol. The diffraction patterns of the polyol–Cloisite 30B product exhibited a broad peak at 2θ of approximately 3.8° corresponding to the slight increase of the basal distance from 1.85 to 2.30 nm (Fig. 7 A). The diffraction patterns of the product from polyol and Cloisite 30B pretreated with pentanol showed the presence of a well-defined [001] peak at 2θ of approximately 2.4°, corresponding to the increase of the basal distance of 3.68 nm (Fig. 7B). An additional peak at 2θ of approximately 4.9° (i.e., a basal distance of approximately 1.79 nm) was interpreted as due to the presence of the [002] diffraction. These combined results indicated that the pretreatment of Cloisite 30B with pentanol resulted in a significant intercalation of polyols within the interlayer space. This would allow the formation of nanocomposites (e.g., polyurethane–clay nanocomposites), in which intercalation of the polyol results in a significant dispersion of the silicate layers within the polymer matrix."
3,Summary,"The nanoscale dispersion of the organically modified clay was achieved using pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, and octanol. The n-alcohol molecules were intercalated within the interlayer spaces, which were subsequently increased from 1.84 to a maximum of 3.0 nm. The n-alcohol molecules were physically adsorbed and their alkyl chains remained parallel to the silicate surface. Preliminary experiments have shown that the uses of these alcohols may strongly affect the formation of polymer–clay nanocomposites."
