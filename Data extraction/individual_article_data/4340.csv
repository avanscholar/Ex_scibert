0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α-, β-unsaturated aldehyde to α-, β-unsaturated alcohol is an important reaction in industrial production, because α-, β-unsaturated alcohols are vital intermediates in pharmaceutical, fragrance and fine chemicals [1–4]. As a typical type of α-, β-unsaturated aldehydes, crotonaldehyde (CH3 CHCHCHO) is often used in model reaction of selective hydrogenation. Containing the conjugated CO bond and CC bond, the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde usually produces three major products, namely, the partial hydrogenation as crotyl alcohol (CO bond) and butanal (CC bond), and the deep hydrogenation as butanol (CC and CO bond). Generally, hydrogenation of the CC bond is much easier than that of the CO bond in respect of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, so it is difficult for selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond while keeping the CC double bond intact in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Supported Pt [5–7] catalysts have been frequently used in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol in recent years. The catalytic activity of Pt/SnO2 catalyst deactivated quickly in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, while an increasing selectivity to crotyl alcohol was observed due to the formation of PtSn alloys [8]. A Pt/ZnO catalyst also gave a rapid deactivation during the hydrogenation progress, but its selectivity to crotyl alcohol could reach a value as high as 75–80% because of the alloying and chlorine effect [9]. In our recent work, it was suggested that Lewis acidic sites generated by chlorine species may be the key factor to the high crotyl alcohol selectivity [10]. For the Pt/Cr/ZnO catalyst, a high crotyl alcohol selectivity of 80% could be obtained and maintained during the hydrogenation reaction, due to the change of electronic structure of the active Pt metal [11]. For Pt/ZnCl2/SiO2 catalyst, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol was above 68%, but the catalytic activity did not change significantly with the change of reduction temperature [12]. It can be summarized from the above findings that the catalytic behaviors of the Pt catalysts are quite different during the reaction. For example, some supported Pt catalysts can give steady activity and selectivity, while some catalysts suffer severe deactivation and loss of selectivity. To better understand the causes of catalyst deactivation and the factors governing the selectivity, we designed two supported Pt catalysts, Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2, and applied them to the gas phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The different catalytic behaviors of these two catalysts relating to the catalyst property were compared and discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO2 and ZrO2 supports were obtained by thermal decomposition of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O in air at 400°C for 4h, with a specific surface area of 66m2/g and 73m2/g, respectively. Both the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. The support was impregnated with H2PtCl6 aqueous solution with a nominal Pt content of 3wt%. Excess water solution was removed by a mild evaporation. Finally, the resulting solid was dried overnight at 120°C, and was denoted as Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations The specific surface areas of catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption at −196°C on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 apparatus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40kV and 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 20° to 110°, with a scanning step of 0.15°s−1. Particle sizes of Pt in the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts were measured by CO chemisorption on a Chembet 3000 instrument. The sample was reduced in a H2 N2 mixture gas (5vol% H2, 30ml/min) at 500°C for 1h and cooled down to 30°C under pure He flow (30ml/min), then pulse of CO was injected. Pt dispersion was evaluated from the consumption of CO, assuming that CO: Pt=1. The Pt particle size was estimated using the cubic Pt particle model with the calculated Pt metal dispersion. The reduction properties of the samples were measured by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments. The sample was placed in a quartz reactor, and then heated from room temperature to 550°C at a rate of 10°C/min in a H2 N2 gas (5vol% H2; 30ml/min). The hydrogen consumption during the reduction was determined by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector. Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microscope with exciting wavelength of 514.5nm and scanning range of 200–2000cm−1 under an ambient condition. In order to study the carbon deposit, in situ Raman spectroscopy of CO adsorption was carried in a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microscope with an excitation wavelength of 514.5nm and a scanning range of 200–2000cm−1. The sample was reduced in a H2 N2 mixture (5vol% H2, 30ml/min) stream at 500°C for 1h and cooled down to 25°C in a He flow (30ml/min). Then the sample was exposed CON2 (1vol% CO) 30min at 50°C. For the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) study, 50mg of the used catalyst was placed in the middle of a quartz microreactor with a inner diameter of 6mm. The outlet was analyzed on-line by mass spectrometry (Qic-20 Benchtop, Hiden Analytical). Then the sample was subsequently flushed by O2 (20ml/min) from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The mass numbers of 44 and 18 were selected to monitor the desorption of CO2 and H2O fragments, respectively."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The gas phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was performed in a fixed bed reaction system at atmospheric pressure, using a quartz tube (8mm i.d.) reactor. 100mg of catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before running the catalytic test, the catalyst was reduced at 500°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 (20ml/min) and then it was cooled down to 50°C. The crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set before the reactor tube and maintained at 0°C to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1.06kPa), therefore, aldehyde at constant partial pressure was carried over the catalyst by hydrogen flow (26ml/min). The gas line was kept at about 50°C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimazu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical properties of catalysts,"3.1 Physical properties of catalysts Table 1 lists the physical properties of the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts reduced at 500°C. The actual Pt contents in the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts are 2.90 and 2.84wt%, respectively, which are close to the nominal values. By CO chemisorption measurement, the Pt particle sizes in the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 are 4.4 and 3.1nm, respectively. The specific surface areas of the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts are 62 and 58m2/g, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts reduced at 500°C. For both catalysts, only diffraction peaks of the support (CeO2 and ZrO2) are observed. Diffraction peaks of PtO2 or Pt are not detected, which indicates that the Pt species are highly dispersed on the catalyst surface. Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPR profiles of Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts and their corresponding supports. The ZrO2 support shows no reduction peak up to 550°C [13], while the pure CeO2 shows one reduction peak at around 470°C, which can be assigned to the reduction of surface ceria [14]. As for the supported catalysts, a reduction peak at 200°C is observed for the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, and two reduction peaks appear at 180 (α) and 410°C (β) for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Assuming that the initial Pt oxidation state in the catalysts is Pt4+ (PtO2), the nominal hydrogen consumptions of the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts are 291.2 and 297.3μmolH2 gcat −1, respectively. According to the TPR profiles in Fig. 2, the actual hydrogenation consumptions (α peak) calibrated by the known amount of CuO powder for the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts are 288.8 and 608.0μmolH2 gcat −1, respectively. For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, it can be seen that the nominal hydrogen consumption is very close to the actual consumption, suggesting that the reduction peak at 200°C is probably due to the reduction of PtO2. On the contrary, for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, it is found that the actual hydrogen consumption (608.0μmolH2 gcat −1) is significantly higher than the nominal value (297.3μmolH2 gcat −1), which is due to the reduction of the CeO2 support. This indicates that the presence of Pt promotes reduction of ceria via spillover of hydrogen from platinum to the support [15], which remarkably shifts the surface ceria reduction downwards in temperature. The H2-TPR results also imply that the Pt species in the catalysts after reduction 500°C are metallic Pt0, together with partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+."
7,Catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.2 Catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 3 shows the catalytic behaviors of the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. It should be noted that the initial reactivity of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (about 31%) is much higher than that of the Pt/ZrO2 (about 20.0%), indicating the vital role of support in the reaction. In addition, the conversion of crotonaldehyde decreases with reaction time for both catalysts. Concerning the selectivity, the main products are crotyl alcohol (hydrogenation of CO bond), butanal (hydrogenation of CC bond) and butanol (complete hydrogenation). Typical side reactions in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde are polymerization resulting in the formation of heavy compounds product and decarbonylation resulting in the formation of C3 (propane and propylene) hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide [16,17]. For the desired crotyl alcohol, the selectivity keeps a stable level around 48% on the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, while its selectivity decreases from 51.6 to 31.9% after 350min on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. However, the selectivity to butanal increases with reaction time for both catalysts. Detailed catalytic results based on Fig. 3 are also listed in Table 2 . It is found that the turnover frequencies (TOFs) are similar for the two catalysts after 300min reaction, however, with the Pt/CeO2 catalyst having higher TOF (9.7×10−3 s−1) compared to the Pt/ZrO2 (6.1×10−3 s−1) at the initial stage. As for the bare supports, it is found that the pure CeO2 or ZrO2 is inactive for the reaction. It is obviously that these two catalysts suffer deactivation during the reaction. The cause of deactivation over Pt catalysts has been extensively investigated and it was generally recognized that the formation of heavy organic compounds on catalyst surface via polymerization could block the active sites [10]. To further check the surface species on the catalysts, we performed TPO examinations of the used Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4 , for the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts, there is one H2O desorption peak around 70°C, respectively, and no CO2 were detected in this temperature range, indicating that this signal from the desorption of the adsorbed H2O on the surface of the catalyst. With increasing temperature, simultaneous desorption of H2O and CO2 are detected, suggesting the oxidation of surface organic compounds at high temperature. This result indicates that organic compounds were deposited on the catalyst surface during the reaction, which may block the active sites and thus suppress the reactivity. Additionally, the ratio of desorption area of CO2 between Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 is 1.6/1, implying more deposition of the organic compounds on the Pt/CeO2 compared to Pt/ZrO2, which can be explained the rapid deactivation and lower activity at steady state. In Fig. 3, small amount of C3 hydrocarbons are produced during the reaction, indicating the occurrence of decarbonylation reaction and the simultaneous formation of CO [18]. It was reported that CO molecules could be strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface and the active sites are blocked, which led to a partial loss of active sites [19]. In order to further confirm whether the deactivation is caused by CO poisoning, 1ml CO was injected into reactor before the reaction. Fig. 5 shows the effect of CO poisoning on the catalytic behavior of the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts. It can be seen that the crotonaldehyde conversion of both catalysts have a decline at the initial stage after CO adsorption, especially for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (from 31 to 8%), and the reactivity is obviously suppressed by the poisoning during the whole reaction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the CO chemisorption on the surface Pt atoms may also be responsible for the deactivation of the catalysts. Concerning the selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol, no apparent changes are observed for both catalysts, indicating that the CO poisoning does not influence the selectivity of target product. Therefore, the deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction was caused by two factors. One is the deposition of organic compounds on the catalyst surface, as evidenced by TPO results (Fig. 4); the other is the strong CO adsorption on the Pt atoms via decarbonylation reaction, as evidenced by the CO poisoning experiments (Fig. 5). In order to further verify the reasons of catalyst deactivation, a series of experiments were conducted, as shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that the fresh catalyst deactivated rapidly in 5h reaction. When the spent catalyst was in situ purged with N2 (26ml/min) at 100°C for 30min and exposed to reactant mixtures (point A), the conversion of crotonaldehyde was recovered to some extent (but less than the initial conversion). After that, the catalyst was in situ calcined in air at 400°C for 1h and subsequently reduced in H2 (26ml/min) at 500°C for 30min. (point B). When the treated sample was exposed to the reactant mixture, it was found that the initial conversion of crotonaldehyde could be fully recovered. The recovery of reactivity after N2 purge (point A) could be attributed to the removal of chemisorbed CO on the catalyst surface, and the recovery of reactivity after calcination (point B) could be attributed to the combustion of surface organic compounds. Therefore, it could be validated that the deactivation of the catalyst is due to the CO chemisorption (mainly on Pt) and the deposition of organic compounds on the catalyst. It also could be concluded that the CO chemisorption on the surface Pt atoms is probably reversible as the CO molecules could be removed by N2 purging. It is interesting that the selectivities of crotyl alcohol on these two catalysts are different. In the case of the Pt/CeO2, the selectivity decreases with reaction time, while it keeps stable in the case of Pt/ZrO2. Chen [20] reported that carbon deposition formed on the catalyst surface during the hydrogenaton process may account for the decrease in selectivity for crotyl alcohol. In order to further verify this point, Raman spectroscopic measurements are carried out. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the used catalysts. For the used Pt/CeO2 catalyst, two Raman bands at 1350 and 1600cm−1 are observed, which are assigned to the carbon deposit [21,22]. However, for the used Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, no Raman peak associated to carbon deposit is observed. The deposition of carbon on the Pt/CeO2 surface could result in the formation of PtC interface. It was reported that very low selectivity to crotyl alcohol (<10%) was obtained over Pt catalysts supported on activated carbon and carbon blacks, and it was concluded that Pt/C catalysts preferred the hydrogenation of CC bond to CO bond [23,24]. These findings indicate that the presence of carbon on the catalyst surface may suppress the selectivity. This point is also supported by the fact that the selectivity to butanal increases with reaction time. On the other hand, no peaks due to carbon deposit are observed on the surface of the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst in the reaction, which could well explain the stable selectivity on this catalyst. In order to further explain the effects of the generation of carbon on the catalysts, in situ Raman spectroscopy of CO adsorption was performed on the reduced catalyst, as shown in Fig. 8 . For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, the Raman spectrum remains unchanged before and after CO adsorption. For the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the characteristic band at 460cm−1 assigned to F2g mode vibration of CeO2 shifts to lower wave number at 445cm−1 for the reduced catalyst compared to the as prepared catalyst. The shift is caused by lattice expansion of CeO2 due to the presence of Ce3+ cations formed during the reduction treatment. Similar result has also been reported in a La3+-doped CeO2 material, in which replacement of Ce4+ by La3+ led to a lattice expansion and consequently a red shift of the 460cm−1 Raman band [25]. After the CO adsorption, the Raman band at 445cm−1 returns to its initial position (460cm−1), indicating the oxidation of Ce3+ by reacting with CO. Meanwhile, two intensive bands at 1340 and 1600cm−1 are observed on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, which could be assigned to the carbon deposit [21,22]. The results suggest that the carbon deposits is formed by the reaction between CO and Ce3+ species on the catalyst surface (Ce2O3 +CO2CeO2 +C). It was reported that the reduced Ce3+ cations are beneficial to the selectivity of crotyl alcohol [26]. However, the reaction between CO and Ce3+ could results in carbon deposits and deactivate such Ce3+ sites, and consequently the Pt/CeO2 catalyst turns unselective due to a poisoning of support sites, which could explain the loss of selectivity over the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. In summary, the comparison of these two catalysts suggests that the decline of crotyl alcohol selectivity on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst may result from the formation of carbon species on the catalyst surface."
8,Adsorption model,"3.3 Adsorption model Combined with the Raman and TPO results, adsorption models of crotonaldehyde over the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts are proposed in Scheme 1 . C x H y O z stands for organic compounds such as C8 condensation product generated during the reaction on the catalysts surfaces. These organic compounds will cover the active sites of the catalyst, which consequently suppresses the reactivity. For the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the carbon deposits formed by CO reacting with Ce3+ cover the catalyst surface and produce Pt/C interfaces, which tends to CC hydrogenation [19] and thus inhibits CO hydrogenation. For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, considering that no carbon deposit is formed on catalyst surface and the support is not reducible, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol remains unchanged during the reaction."
9,Conclusions,"Catalytic behaviors of the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts are compared for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. It is found that both catalysts suffer deactivation due to the formation of organic compounds on the catalyst surface, and the poisoning effect of CO chemisorptions on Pt atoms. It is also found that the selectivity to crotyl alcohol decreases with reaction time for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, while it remains stable for the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. The decline of the selectivity on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst could be attributed to the formation of carbon deposit on the catalyst surface. In contrast, no carbon deposits are formed on the surface of Pt/ZrO2 catalyst in the reaction process, which could explain the stable selectivity."
