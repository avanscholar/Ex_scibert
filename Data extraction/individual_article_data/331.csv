0,Introduction,"Allyl alcohol, a bifunctional compound (containing carbon-carbon double bond and hydroxyl), is a pivotal intermediate for the synthesis of epichlorohydrin, glycidol, vinyl polymers, glycidyl esters and amines [1,2]. Currently, allyl alcohol is produced mainly via the hydrolysis of allyl chloride, alkaline saponification of allyl acetate and/or isomerization of propylene oxide [3–5]. But these processes proceed in several steps and accompany the formation of by-product and waste, meanwhile, the primary raw material of these processes is fossil-based propylene [6]. Finding a new concise route for the sustainable synthesis of allyl alcohol from renewable feedstock is of great importance. Glycerol, an unavoidable by-product of biodiesel production, is one of the most attractive platform chemicals with C3 backbone [7–9]. And it was predicated that the production of glycerol would be six times more than demand in 2020 [2]. In this case, production of allyl alcohol from renewable glycerol has attracted the attentions of many scientists [10–39]. It was reported that allyl alcohol could be synthesized from glycerol via homogenous hydrogen transfer reaction, in which liquid formic acid was employed as hydrogen donor, solvent and catalyst [10–14]. But this reaction had to be carried out with excess formic acid under reflux condition. Several alcohols, such as propanol, 1-hexanol, 2-octanol, glycerol and 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol, were also tested as hydrogen donor (and solvent) instead of formic acid, while rhenium-based catalysts (such as CH3ReO3, ReO3, NH4ReO4 and/or Re2(CO)10) must be added in order to improve the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity of allyl alcohol [15–18]. In 2012, Shiramizu and Toste found that the yield of allyl alcohol reached 90 % when 3-octanol was selected as the hydrogen donor in CH3ReO3 catalyzed mixture at 170 °C [15]. At the same time, J. Yi et al. further disclosed that allyl alcohol (yield 64 %) could be synthesized directly from glycerol over NH4ReO4 even without additional solvent [18]. Beside Re, Mo- and V-based catalysts were also tried, but their activity was lower than that of Re-based catalysts [19–21]. Recently, Tazawa et al. found that 10 nm sized Au NPs in ReOx–Au/CeO2 catalyst were extremely effective for the activation of H2 while retaining the CC bond in allyl alcohol, and the maximum yield of allyl alcohol reached 91 % at 170 °C and 8 MPa H2 [22]. From the viewpoint of industrial application, the drawback of these hydrogen transfer reactions is that it is a discontinuous process and has difficulty in product separation because ketones or aldehydes formed in the reaction mixture along with the dehydrogenation of alcohols (hydrogen donor). In 2010, Liu et al. disclosed that allyl alcohol (along with acrolein, acetol, propanal, acetone, and acetaldehyde) could be synthesized directly form glycerol over bare Fe2O3 catalyst at 320 °C in vapor-phase under N2 flow, and the best yield of allyl alcohol reached 25 % at a space velocity of 96.4 h−1 [23]. After that, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 and zeolite supported FeOx catalysts [24–28], alkali metals- [29,30] and Mo- [31] promoted FeOx catalysts were reported by several groups in order to enhance the yield of allyl alcohol. But it is regret to say that the yield of allyl alcohol remains less than 30 % until now. Apart from FeOx, Santos et al. found that CuMoAlO was capable for the formation of allyl alcohol from glycerol under H2 atmosphere, and the selectivity of allyl alcohol reached 15 % at 250 °C [32]. Lari et al. found that the selectivity of allyl alcohol could be enhanced to 20 % (at 80 % conversion of glycerol) over zeolite-supported silver catalyst [33]. In addition, several new techniques, such as supercritical water and sonication, were tried to convert glycerol to allyl alcohol [34,35]. And different feedstocks, such as 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) [36] and acrolein [37–39], were also tested for the production of allyl alcohol. Herein, we want to report a CoFe alloy catalyst which is efficient for the selective production of allyl alcohol directly from glycerol in a continuous vapor phase reactor. This alloy was synthesized via the controlled decomposition and reduction of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks CoFe-ZIF ([M(CH3C3H2N2)2]n, MCo and Fe). The structure of this CoFe alloy was characterized in detail. It was disclosed that the activated hydrogen and acidity of CoFe alloy were crucial for the selective formation of allyl alcohol. The reaction mechanism over CoFe alloy was proposed on the results of a series of controlled experiments."
1,Experiments,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation CoFe-ZIF precursors were synthesized in a fast method according to reference [40]. In a typical process, 10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 10 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in deionized water (60 mL) under stirring to form a clear solution. Then, 100 mL aqueous solution which contained 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm, 160 mmol) and NaOH (50 mmol) was added dropwise to above aqueous solution of metal ions under vigorously stirring for 3 h. After that, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed with water and methanol, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The formed precursor was denoted as CoFe11-ZIF, in which, “11” represented the added mole ratio of Co and Fe in feed was 1:1. Co-ZIF, CoFe21-ZIF, CoFe12-ZIF and Fe-ZIF, with different mole ratio of Co and Fe in feed, were prepared in the similar procedures as above. CoFe-ZIF precursors were heated to 350 °C (2 °C/min) and calcined at 350 °C for 3 h in a flow of air, the calcined products were identified as CoFeOxy-ZIF (“xy” represented the added mole ratio of Co and Fe in feed). Before catalytic reaction, CoFeOxy-ZIF was reduced in H2 flow at 600 °C for 1 h, and the reduced catalyst was denoted as CoFexy-ZIF-R. The real content of Co and Fe in the prepared catalyst (CoFeOxy-ZIF) was checked via inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; Thermo Elemental IRIS Intrepid). Several reference catalysts, with the same composition as that of CoFe11-ZIF-R, were prepared by mechanical mixing (denoted as CoFe-MM-R), impregnation (denoted as CoFe-IM-R) and coprecipitation (denoted as CoFe-CP-R). These preparation procedures were described in detail in the supporting information section."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/WAX-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with a step of 0.02° and 5°/min from 5 to 80°. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Leo Evo Series SEM (VP 1430, Germany) and platinum was coated over samples to avoid charging. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter (TG-DSC) experiments were carried out on a Netzsch STA 409 thermobalance under a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air flow (30 mL/min) from 25 to 700 °C. Brunauer-Eemmet -Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption at its normal boiling point using an ASAP 2010 analyzer (Micromeritics) after degasification at 100 °C for 6 h in vacuum. The specific surface area was calculated using BET method and the pore size distributions were calculated by Horvath Kawazoe (HK) method (for pores smaller than 2 nm) and Barrett-Joyner- Halenda (BJH) method (for pores larger than 2 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD system under a base pressure of 10−9 Torr. A monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source was applied and C 1s (with the binding energy of 284.8 eV) was used for calibration. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL-2020F at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and grinded for 1 h in a mortar. After diluting in ethanol and further treated in ultrasonic bath, several drops of the suspension were dispersed on a mesh of ultrathin carbon film for TEM analysis. The reducibility of catalysts was checked via H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) in the following procedures. 20 mg sample was first pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h in Ar flow (30 mL/min). After cooling to room temperature, 10 % H2/Ar mixture was shifted to the reactor and the sample was heated to 800 °C with a heating rate of 15 °C/min. The effluent was dried with powder KOH and monitored with an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (OmniStarTM, GSD301, Switzerland). Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD) was carried out in the same equipment as above TPR. Catalyst (50 mg) was first reduced at 600 °C in H2 flow for 1 h, purged with purified Ar for 30 min, and cooled to 50 °C in Ar flow. And then, the reduced sample was exposed to H2 for 30 min, the physical adsorbed H2 was eliminated with Ar for 2 h at 50 °C. Finally, the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen was performed by ramping the temperature to 400 °C at 10 °C/min. Hydrogen in effluent was checked and recorded as a function of temperature with the on-line mass spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was performed in the same process as above except that catalysts were exposed to NH3 for 30 min and heated to 500 °C in desorption. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX70 spectrometer. 30 mg of sample was pressed into a round sheet with a diameter of 1 cm, and then fixed in a pyrex cell. After a pretreatment under vacuum at 200 °C for 4 h, the sample was cooled down to 30 °C, and then pyridine vapor was admitted into the cell for interacting with the acid sites on the catalysts. After desorption at 100 °C under vacuum for 1 h, the signals were collected through the online FTIR equipment."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction Catalyst (0.2 g, sized in 40–60 mesh) was loaded in a stainless steel vertical fixed bed reactor with an internal diameter 6 mm and length 540 mm. Before reaction, catalyst was reduced at 600 °C for 1 h in H2 flow. And then, the reactor was cooled to scheduled temperature and adjusted the H2 pressure to scheduled value, aqueous solution of glycerol (40 wt%) was continuously fed into the reactor by a HPLC pump at a constant flow rate. After reaction, the effluent was cooled to −5 °C in a condenser. Liquid products were collected from the cooled gas-liquid separator, which was weighed and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 14B) equipped with an FID detector and a 30 m capillary column (DB-WAX 52 CB, USA). Gas phase was also analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 8A) equipped with a TCD detector and a Porapack Q column. All products in liquid were identified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (GC–MS, Agilent 6890). Every data acquisition was obtained after steady operation for 2 h, and the selectivity of each product was calculated based on carbon basis. The conversion of glycerol and selectivity of products were defined as follows. Conversion % = moles of glycerol in − moles of glycerol out moles of glycerol in × 100 Selectivity % = moles of carbon in a specific product moles of carbon in glycerol consumed × 100 Yield % = C o n v e r s i o n % × S e l e c t i v i t y % 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preparation of CoFe alloy,"3.1 Preparation of CoFe alloy At first, the structure of prepared bimetallic CoFe-ZIF precursor was confirmed in its XRD pattern, typical SEM image, N2 sorption isotherms and TG-DSC analysis (Fig. S1). After calcined at 350 °C for 3 h in air, CoFe-ZIF and those reference catalysts prepared in other methods have decomposed completely to mixed cobalt oxides, iron oxides and spinel CoFe2O4 (Figs. S2–S4). The textural properties of calcined samples were summarized in Table S1. H2-TPR analysis further indicated that CoO-ZIF and CoFeO-ZIF could be reduced completely below 600 °C in H2 flow. But the reduction of FeO-ZIF and reference catalysts prepared in other methods needed higher temperature (Fig. S5), and all catalysts could be reduced completely when the reduction temperature was raised to 700 °C (Fig. S6). XRD patterns of these catalysts after reduction at 600 °C for 1 h were displayed in Fig. 1 A. It could be found that CoO-ZIF was reduced to metallic Co (PDF#01-080-6668 and PDF#00-015-0806) completely, but Fe-ZIF-R contained metallic Fe (PDF#01-071-3763) and FeO (PDF#01-074-1886). Mainly a sharp diffraction peak at 44.7° and a small peak at 65° were detected in reduced CoFe-ZIF-R, which could be assigned to the formation of CoFe alloy. Beside CoFe alloy, other diffraction peaks of separated Co were also detected in CoFe11-ZIF-R and CoFe21-ZIF-R. XRD patterns of those reference catalysts that prepared in different methods were exhibited in Fig. 1B. It was found that besides CoFe alloy and metallic Co, CoFe2O4 still remained in CoFe-MM-R, CoFe-IM-R and CoFe-CP-R, and these results were similar with their H2-TPR spectra (Figs. S5 and S6). Above characterization results further indicated CoFe alloy formed preferably from bimetallic CoFe-ZIF among those precursors prepared in different methods, which might be attributed to that Co and Fe distributed more uniformly in the framework of CoFe-ZIF [41]."
7,Properties of prepared CoFe alloy,"3.2 Properties of prepared CoFe alloy The BET surface of these reduced catalysts was summarized in Table S2. It was interesting to note that CoFe11-ZIF-R has the highest surface area (13.2 m2/g), while the surface area of CoFe-CP-R was quite low (7.6 m2/g). These results indicated that catalyst derived from CoFe-ZIF precursor was easier to be reduced to CoFe alloy and it has higher surface area than these catalysts prepared in other methods. Hydrogen adsorption and activation ability over these reduced catalysts were checked via H2-TPD (see Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). It was found that mainly one big desorption peak centered at about 120 °C was detected in Co-ZIF-R, which could be assigned to the desorption of H2 that adsorbed on metallic Co [42]. Beside this weakly adsorbed H2, another desorption peak at 150 °C appeared when Fe was added in CoFexy-ZIF-R and this peak could be attributed to the desorption of dissociated H over CoFe alloy [43]. And it was interesting to find that the amount of dissociated H increased with the increasing content of Fe in CoFexy-ZIF-R. But no obvious desorption peak was detected in Fe-ZIF-R. These results indicated that CoFe alloy is more active for the adsorption and activation of H2. According to the adsorbed amount of hydrogen, the calculated dispersion and metal surface area of Co in these reduced CoFexy-ZIF-R catalysts were summarized in Table 1. It was found that the formation of alloy could increase the dispersion and the surface area of Co in reduced catalyst. The H2-TPD spectra of reference catalysts prepared in different methods were shown in Fig. S7, and the dispersion and surface area of Co in these reduced catalysts were summarized Table S2. It was found that the amount of the adsorbed hydrogen reached 0.266 mmol/g over CoFe11-ZIF-R, and the formation of CoFe alloy could promote the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen (see Fig. 2 and Table 1) [44,45]. The amount of dissociative adsorbed H over CoFe-IM-R was also higher than that of CoFe-MM-R and CoFe-CP-R. Fig. 3 showed the NH3-TPD profile of those catalysts prepared via ZIF precursors. Only a faint desorption peak (in the range of 150−350 °C) was detected over Co-ZIF-R, which indicated that the acidity of monometallic Co-ZIF-R was quite low. On the other hand, a strong desorption peak in the range of 220−470 °C appeared in CoFexy-ZIF-R and Fe-ZIF-R, and the amount of desorbed NH3 increased with the increasing content of Fe in catalysts. These profiles were deconvoluted into two peaks which were assigned to the desorption of NH3 from weak (peak at 300 °C) and strong acid sites (peak at 380 °C), and it could be found that the amount of desorbed NH3 increased obviously with the increasing content of Fe (Table 2 ). These results disclosed that the Fe can enhance the acidity of reduced CoFexy-ZIF-R catalysts [25,31,46–49]. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption further confirmed the acidity of reduced Fe-ZIF-R and CoFe11-ZIF-R (Fig. S8). The acidity of those reference catalysts that prepared in different methods was shown in Fig. S9 and Table S3, and it could be found that the amount of total acid sites in CoFe11-ZIF-R (0.105 mmol/g) was higher than that of reference catalysts. Fig. 4 compared the binding energy of Co 2p and Fe 2p in catalysts prepared in different methods. The binding energy of Co 2p3/2 in CoFe11-ZIF-R appeared at 779.4 eV, which fitted well with that of Co in CoFe alloy [50], and the deconvoluted peak at 778.5 eV was assigned to that of separate metallic Co [51]. Besides Co in CoFe alloy and separate metallic Co, the deconvoluted peaks at 780.1 eV could be attributed to Co2+ of CoFe2O4 in CoFe-MM-R, CoFe-IM-R and CoFe-CP-R [52]. These results fitted well with above XRD and H2-TPR analysis, that is, mainly CoFe alloy (85.3 %) and metallic Co (14.7 %) formed in CoFe11-ZIF-R, while a mixed CoFe alloy, metallic Co and CoFe2O4 coexisted in the reference catalysts (see Table S4). The binding energy of Fe 2p in these catalysts also supported above conclusion. The peaks at 707.4 eV in Fe 2p3/2 came from Fe in CoFe alloy [50]. The deconvoluted peaks at 710.2 eV in CoFe11-ZIF-R might be contributed to that partial Fe was oxidized by air during the sample transfer [53]. And the obvious peaks located at 710.4 eV in CoFe-MM-R, CoFe-IM-R and CoFe-CP-R came from Fe3+ of CoFe2O4 [52]. These results further confirmed that mainly CoFe alloy formed in the reduced CoFe-ZIF-R catalyst. Typical TEM images and corresponding line-scan EDS analysis confirmed that mainly CoFe alloy formed in CoFe11-ZIF-R (see Fig. 5 A). Uniformly sized CoFe alloy particles (30−40 nm) with rice grains outline were observed clearly, and EDS analysis (Fig. 5A1) indicated that Co and Fe distributed homogeneously in these nanoparticles. The lattice fringes of (211), (220) and (110) planes in CoFe alloy were identified in its HRTEM image (Fig. 5A2). On the other hand, nonuniformly dispersed particles of mixed CoFe alloy, Co particles and CoFe2O4 sheets appeared in CoFe-CP-R (see Fig. 5B). EDS analysis (Fig. 5B1) indicated that the content of O, Fe and Co varied separately. The lattice fringe in red square (Fig. 5B2) belonged to CoFe alloy (211) and in green square (Fig. 5B3) belonged to CoFe2O4 (311). The above results were consisted with the results of XRD (Fig. 1) and XPS (Fig. 4)."
8,Synthesis of allyl alcohol from glycerol,"3.3 Synthesis of allyl alcohol from glycerol Table 3 and S5 summarized the performance of those CoFexy-ZIF-R catalysts that prepared from ZIFs precursors. It was found that single metallic Fe-ZIF derived Fe-ZIF-R catalyst was capable for the synthesis of allyl alcohol from glycerol. But the conversion of glycerol was quite low (26.2 %), and large amount of acetol and 1,2-PDO formed along with allyl alcohol. These results were similar as those reported in literatures [28,29,32]. On the other hand, the conversion of glycerol increased sharply to 81.5 % over single metallic Co-ZIF-R catalyst, unfortunately, mainly 1,2-PDO (61.3 %), acetol (15.0 %) and 1-propanol (1-PO) (10.8 %) were detected in the reaction mixture. It was quite interesting to note that those bimetallic CoFexy-ZIF derived CoFexy-ZIF-R catalysts were active and selective for the formation of allyl alcohol. Among which, the selectivity of allyl alcohol reached 68.7 % over CoFe11-ZIF-R with 89.7 % conversion of glycerol. The space time yield of allyl alcohol was 1.02 g/g-cat/h, and the calculated specific activity of surface Co (turnover frequency TOF) reached 48.7 h−1. These results indicated that CoFe alloy was crucial for the formation of allyl alcohol. And this crucial role could be attributed to that the formed CoFe alloy was more active for the adsorption and activation of H2 (see Fig. 2), and Fe can enhance the acidity of CoFexy-ZIF-R catalysts (see Fig. 3). The synergetic contribution of acid sites and dissociative adsorbed hydrogen (over CoFe alloy) could promote the dehydration of glycerol and followed hydrogenation concurrently to allyl alcohol. On the other hand, the selectivity of allyl alcohol was low over monometallic Co-ZIF-R and Fe-ZIF-R, which might be attributed to that the acidity of Co-ZIF-R was weak, and the H2 was hard to adsorb on Fe-ZIF-R. That is, both the dissociated adsorbed hydrogen and surface acidity were indispensable for the selective formation of allyl alcohol from glycerol. The performance of those reference catalysts with same bulk composition as that of CoFe11-ZIF-R were summarized in Table 4 and S6. It was found that CoFe11-ZIF-R was the most active and selective one for the formation of allyl alcohol. These results could be attributed to that both the acidity (0.105 mmol/g) and the amount of dissociated adsorbed hydrogen (0.155 mmol/g) over CoFe11-ZIF-R reached their maximum among these reference catalysts (see Tables S2, S3). The detected conversion of glycerol over CoFe-IM-R was similar as that of CoFe11-ZIF-R, while the selectivity of allyl alcohol decreased slightly to 50.6 %, because the amount of dissociated adsorbed hydrogen, the acidity and the surface area of CoFe-IM-R were slightly lower than those of CoFe11-ZIF-R (Table S2, S3). The selectivity of allyl alcohol (36.9 %) over CoFe-CP-R was also higher than that of separated monometallic catalysts, but the conversion of glycerol dropped to 59.4 % because of its low surface area and low amount of dissociated adsorbed hydrogen (Table S2). On the other hand, the selectivity of allyl alcohol over CoFe-MM-R decreased sharply to 16.7 % and the selectivity of 1,2-PDO increased to 47.7 % under the same condition because of a large amount of separated Co formed in CoFe-MM-R (Figs. 1 and 4). These results indicated that uniformly formed CoFe alloy could simultaneously promote the adsorption and activation of hydrogen with enhanced surface acidity, both adsorbed hydrogen and acidity played a pivotal role for the selective formation of allyl alcohol. In order to eliminate the influence of residual oxide, the reduction temperature was raised to 700 °C, and it was found that CoFe11-ZIF-R still exhibited the best performance (50.8 % conversion of glycerol and 38.6 % selectivity of allyl alcohol, see Table S7). Fig. 6 presented the performance of CoFe11-ZIF-R under varied reaction temperature. It was found that the conversion of glycerol increased continuously from 70.4–97.5% with the increasing temperature from 190 to 320 °C, while the selectivity of allyl alcohol passed its maximum (68.7 %) at 250 °C. Acetol was the main intermediate at low temperature and its selectivity decreased continuously with the increasing reaction temperature. The selectivity of another intermediate, 1,2-PDO, varied in the same trend as that of allyl alcohol. On the other hand, 1-PO became the dominant product at higher temperature (> 300 °C). Similar phenomenon was also found over CoFe12-ZIF-R catalyst (Fig. S10), as the selectivity of allyl alcohol remained stable only at low temperature. And then, it decreased along the rapid formation of 1-PO with the increasing temperature. These results indicated that allyl alcohol is a temperature-sensitive product during the hydrogenolysis of glycerol and it could be further hydrogenated to 1-PO [54,55], and this reaction must be operated at an optimized temperature. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.20 g; 2.0 MPa; 40 wt% glycerol aqueous solution, 1.2 mL/h, and H2/glycerol = 40 (mol) in feed; data acquisition after steady operation for 2 h. Fig. 7 showed the performance of CoFe11-ZIF-R under varied molar ratio of H2/glycerol by adjusting H2 concentration in feed H2/N2 (80 mL/min) at 250 °C and 2.0 MPa. It was interesting to note that the conversion of glycerol increased continuously with the increasing molar ratio of H2/glycerol. In the absence of hydrogen, the conversion of glycerol (26.8 %) and the selectivity of allyl alcohol (21.0 %) were quite low, and mainly acetol (54.1 %) formed. The selectivity of allyl alcohol increased sharply to 67.8–70 % even when small amount of H2 appeared in feed. The detected conversion of glycerol reached 89.7 % with a 68.7 % selectivity of allyl alcohol at H2/glycerol = 40. The selectivity of acetol decreased from 54.1–8.8%. Though the selectivity of 1,2-PDO and 1-PO also increased slightly with the increasing amount of H2 in feed, the total amount of these byproducts was low even at higher conversion of glycerol. Once again, these results indicated that hydrogen is indispensable for the selective formation of allyl alcohol from glycerol over CoFe alloy [22,32]. Reaction conditions: catalyst 0.20 g; 250 °C; 2.0 MPa; 40 wt% glycerol aqueous solution, 1.2 mL/h and gas flow 80 mL/min in feed; data acquisition after steady operation for 2 h. The influence of gas flow rate on the performance of CoFe11-ZIF-R was summarized in Table S8. It was found that high gas flow rate was favorable to the conversion of glycerol and the formation of allyl alcohol [56]. These results indicated that the timely diffusion of reactants was beneficial to the selectivity of allyl alcohol. CoFe11-ZIF-R showed good stability at 250 °C and 2 MPa (Fig. S11), and the conversion of glycerol decreased slightly from 89.7 to 80.3 % within 20 h on stream, while the selectivity of allyl alcohol remained stable. Fig. 8 revealed the performance of CoFe11-ZIF-R for allyl alcohol synthesis under varied H2 pressure. It was found that the conversion of glycerol was low (71.0 %) at atmospheric pressure, and it increased slightly to 92.1 % (at 3.0 MPa) with the increasing H2 pressure. The selectivity of allyl alcohol (66–68.7 %) was less sensitive to hydrogen pressure at first (when the H2 pressure was lower than 2.0 MPa), but it dropped quickly from 68.7 % (at 2.0 MPa) to 46.0 % (at 3.0 MPa) along with the fast raising selectivity of 1-PO and 1,2-PDO. The selectivity of acetol decreased continuously with the increasing H2 pressure. These results indicated that allyl alcohol was stable at low H2 pressure and high pressure was more favorable for the formation of 1,2-PDO and 1-PO. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.20 g; 250 °C; 40 wt% glycerol aqueous solution, 1.2 mL/h and H2/glycerol = 40 (mol) in feed; data acquisition after steady operation for 2 h."
9,Possible mechanism of allyl alcohol formation over CoFe11-ZIF-R,"3.4 Possible mechanism of allyl alcohol formation over CoFe11-ZIF-R In order to disclose the mechanism of allyl alcohol formation over CoFe11-ZIF-R catalyst, a series of controlled experiments were carried out. At first, the performance of CoFe11-ZIF-R for the selective synthesis of allyl alcohol from glycerol was carried out under varied weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) at 250 °C and 2.0 MPa (see Fig. 9 ). It was found that the conversion of glycerol increased quickly from 5.5 % (at WHSV−1 = 0.08 h) to 96.5 % (at 1.02 h) with prolonged contact time. At the beginning of this reaction, mainly allyl alcohol and acetol formed, and the detected selectivity of acetol decreased continuously from 29.1 % (at 5.5 % conversion of glycerol) to 1.2 % (at 96.5 % conversion of glycerol). But the selectivity of allyl alcohol increased at first from 49.1 % (at 5.5 % conversion of glycerol) to its maximum (77.2 % at 53.9 % conversion of glycerol), and then decreased sharply to 11.4 % (at 96.5 % conversion of glycerol). The selectivity of 1-PO increased slowly at first (before WHSV-1 =0.26 h), but jumped from 7.5 % (at 0.38 h) to 64.2 % (at 1.02 h). The selectivity of 1,2-PDO changed slightly during these varied WHSV. The results clearly indicated that both allyl alcohol and acetol were the intermediate products, while 1-PO was the final product. As comparison, the performance of monometallic Fe-ZIF-R and Co-ZIF-R at the similar conversion level of glycerol were summarized in Table S9. It could be found that acetol was the main product over Fe-ZIF-R and Co-ZIF-R at the beginning of the reaction, and the selectivity of allyl alcohol decreased to 8.8 and 0.1 %, respectively. These results further confirmed that the selective formation of allyl alcohol need the synergistic cooperation of dissociative adsorbed hydrogen and acid sites on the catalyst surface. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.20 g; 250 °C; 2.0 MPa; 40 wt% glycerol aqueous solution with feed of 0.45−6 mL/h, and H2/glycerol = 40 (mol) in feed; data acquisition after steady operation for 2 h. WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) = mass of glycerol/hour/mass of catalyst. And secondly, acetol, 1,2-PDO, 1-PO and acrolein were used as starting materials and these reactions over CoFe11-ZIF-R were performed at 250 °C and 2.0 MPa (see Table 5 and S10). It could be found that (1) 1,2-PDO was the dominating product (with 86.9 % selectivity at 80.3 % conversion) when acetol was fed as a starting material, and small amount of allyl alcohol and 1-PO was also detected. (2) 1-PO and allyl alcohol formed in parallel from 1,2-PDO. The selectivity of 1-PO and allyl alcohol were 47.8 and 30.7 %, respectively, at a 40.9 % conversion of 1,2-PDO. (3) 1-PO was relatively stable over CoFe11-ZIF-R under the reaction condition, the lower conversion of 1-PO could be attributed to the presence of H2 (2.0 MPa) which would retard its dehydrogenation to propionaldehyde. (4) Acrolein was highly active even at a higher feed concentration (40 wt% in water) because of the presence of H2 (2.0 MPa). The detected conversion of acrolein reached 88.1 %, and mainly propionaldehyde (54.2 %) and 1-PO (34.1 %) formed via the hydrogenation of acrolein. According to above results and those proposed mechanism by other researchers [2,28,29,33,36], we thought that the possible formation routine of allyl alcohol from glycerol over CoFe11-ZIF-R could be illustrated in Scheme 1 . That is, allyl alcohol and acetol formed in parallel directly from glycerol. Fe-ZIF-R catalyst that possesses strong acid site was capable for the dehydration of glycerol to acetol (see its performance in Table 3 and S7, and properties in Fig. 3 and Table 2), while the conversion of glycerol was low since the amount of activated H2 on Fe-ZIF-R was limited (Fig. 2 and Table 1). But mainly 1,2-PDO formed without the cooperation of acid sites (see the performance and properties of Co-ZIF-R in Table 3, Figs. 2 and 3). CoFe alloy can promote the activation of H2 and possesses enhanced acidity, in this case, the synergistic cooperation of dissociative adsorbed hydrogen and acid sites accelerated the formation of allyl alcohol directly from glycerol. Acetol could be hydrogenated to 1,2-PDO quickly [57], and 1,2-PDO further dehydrated to allyl alcohol [36] and/or hydrogenated to 1-PO [58] over metallic Co or CoFe alloy. Finally, 1-PO formed from the consecutive hydrogenation of allyl alcohol and/or 1,2-PDO. The absence of acrolein in these steps might be attributed to the presence of H2 (2.0 MPa) and/or the reaction temperature was low (250 °C). The higher yield of allyl alcohol over CoFe11-ZIF-R could be attributed to the formation of CoFe alloy, and this alloy possesses stronger acid sites and H2 adsorbed easily (see Figs. 1–5). On the other hand, the higher selectivity of 1-PO over CoFe21-ZIF-R (see Table 3) might be attributed to its weak acidity (see Fig. 3)."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we found that uniformly distributed CoFe alloy could be synthesized via controlled calcination and reduction of CoFe-ZIF precursor. And this alloy exhibited high performance for continuous hydrogenolysis of glycerol to allyl alcohol among those catalysts prepared in different methods. The best yield of allyl alcohol was 61.6 % (at 250 °C, 2 MPa and WHSV = 2.6 h−1), and the space time yield reached 1.02 g/g-cat/h. Characterizations indicated that CoFe alloy was more favorable for the activation of H2 and Fe can enhance the acidity of catalysts. A series of controlled experiments confirmed that allyl alcohol formed mainly from simultaneously dehydration + hydrogenation of glycerol. High temperature and increased hydrogen pressure would accelerate the formation of 1-PO via consecutive hydrogenation of allyl alcohol."
