0,Introduction,"In the recent years, value-added products such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol, lactic acid, biohydrogen and biomethane are generated from a wide variety of renewable resources. Bioenergy has a great significance in our modern transport infrastructure by providing an eco-friendly and renewable alternative energy resource. Among the various forms of bioenergy, biohydrogen and biomethane are more attractive due to their high energy density of 141 MJ kg−1 and 50 MJ kg−1 respectively [1]. Additionally, biohydrogen can serve as a catalyst for enhancing the combustion properties of other gaseous biofuels. Moreover, the sequential production of biohydrogen and biomethane in a two-stage process has an improved energy recovery of approximately 10–43% [2]. Also, the two gases can be combined to form biohythane, thereby increasing the overall economy and efficacy. Hence, biohythane is a potential renewable form of energy that produces high energy with less contaminants [3]. The term ‘hythane’ was first derived by Hydrogen Component Inc. In the early 90s for a fuel used in the internal combustion engines that had a blend of compressed natural gas and hydrogen [101]. It was reported that the lean burn of the mixture with 20% hydrogen and CNG reduced the emissions specially NOx into the atmosphere and was also energy efficient [22]. Hythane does not require special storage system or any major modifications in the engines generally used for the combustion of compressed natural gas [101]. Hydrogen and methane are two predominant gaseous energy sources used extensively in the chemical industries for the manufacture of different products. Both of these fuels have huge commercial importance and are highly valued. The hydrogen-based economy is a potential development in which society moves towards more cleaner and sustainable energy supply system. Hydrogen has multiple applications in the chemical and petroleum industry, in fuel cells to generate electricity, as rocket propellant and as vehicular fuel. Methane is also widely used in the transportation sector along with compressed natural gas, and has been known as a safe alternative to petroleum and diesel. A combination of hydrogen and methane, with hydrogen composition of approximately 10–25% is known as hythane [4]. Hythane is an essential fuel involved in the shift from fossil fuel-based system to hydrogen driven economy. Table 1 discusses the details about the gaseous fuels produced from anaerobic digestion technology. One of the major problem associated with the production of biohythane is the low productivity of biohydrogen. Whereas, methane is more of a primary energy with comparatively plentiful sources like biogas, landfill gas and natural gas. Hydrogen is currently being obtained from physico-chemical processes such as methane reforming and synthesis of syngas. These hydrogen generation techniques are not sustainable as they majorly depend on fossil fuel sources [5]. Therefore, alternative methods that are environmental friendly and techno-economically feasible have to be considered. Some of the other methods for hydrogen generation are biomass gasification, electrolysis, photolysis, dark and photo fermentation [1]. Methane can be used as vehicular fuel and is less polluting compared to petrol and diesel. However, it has certain constraints such as low flammability, decreased rate of burning and high ignition temperature resulting in poor combustion [6]. Meanwhile, hydrogen complements the disadvantages of methane. Hydrogen does not produce green house gas emission and is therefore environmental friendly. Increased flammability, decreased combustion time and improved heat efficacy can be achieved by adding hydrogen with methane, thereby increasing the fuel efficiency [2]. In addition, the quenching period of methane can also be decreased by the inclusion of hydrogen, rendering the combustion engine to fire quickly with reduced fuel [7]. Therefore, hythane as an automobile fuel has dual benefits of hydrogen and methane. Moreover, the advantages of biohythane such as lower production costs, environment-friendly nature and sustainability enables it to attain a potential market place. Hythane has a positive impact on the environment as it has less carbon composition, thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases [8]. Currently, hythane is generated by utilizing natural gas through thermochemical techniques [9]. This process consumes huge energy and is majorly dependent on the availability of fossil fuels. In order to avoid these problems, biohythane can be used as an alternative to the pysico-chemically produced hythane. In recent times, two-stage anaerobic digestion comprising of hydrogen generation in the first stage followed by methane generation in the second stage is widely accepted for its potential benefits [10]. The gaseous products generated are used either individually or mixed in a specific manner to produce biohythane, comprising of approximately 10% hydrogen, 60% methane and 30% carbon dioxide [11]. Moreover, the concept of circular economy aims at eliminating waste by utilizing the resources to its maximum level. The bioprocess such as acidogenesis and methanogenesis can be combined to replace linear economy with circular economy to achieve biorefinery concept. Circular economy proves to be an efficient and sustainable waste management technique due to its economic sustainability, enhanced technical feasibility and environmental friendly nature. This strategy facilitates the recovery of nutrients and generate valuable chemicals, biofuels, bio-energy and compost, apart from enhancing the value of organic waste matter. However, some of the hindrances in achieving circular economy such as optimization of process parameters at different stages, requirement of expensive pretreatment strategies to acclimatize the heterogeneous characteristics of the feedstock and complexity in the maintenance of the system have to be solved. In general, the biohythane productivity and purity could be enhanced significantly by modifying certain aspects of the biochemical process during fermentation. Some of the factors influencing the rate of production are (i) identification, production and genetic modification of appropriate microorganisms; (ii) utilization of inexpensive and suitable raw materials; (iii) improved bioreactor design; (iv) application of two-step fermentation process [12–14]. In addition, the biohythane yield can be improved by modifying the ratio of hydrogen and methane. Other factors that enhance the production rate of biohythane are by optimizing certain parameters like pH, temperature, retention time, bioreactor configuration, fermentation mode and pretreatment technique used for hydrolysis of susbstrate [1,2,15]. Therefore, this review extensively discusses the processes involved in generating biohythane and also the positive impacts of a variety of factors in enhancing the production rate. Fig. 1 portrays the number of scientific papers on the investigation of biohythane production from organic waste from 2010 till date."
1,Biohythane as a high potential fuel,"Co-generation of biohydrogen and biomethane from renewable resources has many environmental advantages like reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission in the atmosphere. The utilization of hydrogen as an engine fuel has attracted worldwide notice. Hydrogen can increase the efficiency of combustion engines compared to the ones fueled by methane or by fossil fuels. Hydrogen and methane, when combined to form a mixture, can be more effective at burning. Hydrogen and methane has wide applications because of their higher calorific values of approximately 143 kJ g−1 and 55 kJ g−1 respectively [16,17,49]. The ability of hydrogen to initiate the ignition of methane improves the horsepower of engine at low temperature. Increased turbulence speed diffusion in combustion engine was accomplished when hydrogen is mixed with methane, with values of 1.9 m s−1 for hydrogen and 0.3 m s−1 for methane [18]. Furthermore, biohythane extends the narrow burn cap, as it burns more quickly and is less likely to combust. Toyota, an automobile manufacturer has been designing cars with modern engines and improved combustion power that can be fueled by hythane at the refilling stations similar to natural gas. The hydrazine tests reveal that the combustion of fuel does not contain sulfur molecules and reactive olefins, and release very less contaminants in exhaust gas compared to diesel cars [19]. Moreover, hythane does not emit hazardous substances such as benzene and sulfur [20]. Due to reduced carbon concentration in hythane, compared to fossil fuels, it is also known to emit lesser carbon dioxide. Hythane has less carbon emission of 2.8 Kg CO2 Kg−1fuel during combustion, compared to 3.4 Kg CO2 Kg−1 diesel [21]. Apart from being used as an automobile fuel, biohythane can also produce liquid fuels and other valuable by-products [22]. Generally methane is used in methanol production, which in turn is used for the manufacture of methyl butyl ethers and formaldehyde [2]. However, the conversion of methane to methanol is cost intensive and is less efficient. Whereas, application of biohythane in this conversion process could improve the production rate of methanol significantly. Methanol can be produced from biohythane by adsorption and immobilization techniques, with approximately 200% increase in the production rate compared to methane as raw material, because of the presence of hydrogen in hythane [101]. Currently, biohythane is popular due to its good calorific value and environment-friendly nature. Many well established automobile companies such as Fiat, Volvo etc.. use hythane as fuel in their vehicles [23]. The Montreal hythane bus project utilized hythane with 10% (v v−1) hydrogen and attained decreased NOx emission of 45% in comparison with the buses fueled by methane. The Sun Line transit agency project in California exhibited decreased NOx emission about 50% using hythane with 20% (v v−1) hydrogen. Also, Fiat manufactured a car with 900 cc twin-cylinder engine to use hythane, with 30% (v v−1) hydrogen and achieved reduced emission of 69 g km−1 of CO2 [101]. Some of the proven benefits of biohythane in the automobile sector are less energy demand for engine ignition and increased efficiency of heat and fuel."
2,Mechanism of biohythane production process,
3,Two-stage process for biohythane production,"3.1 Two-stage process for biohythane production The two-stage anaerobic digestion process is carried out in two individual reactors involving many steps. This process takes place under optimized conditions, with sufficient nutrition for selective acidogens and methanogens. Fig. 2 illustrates the overview of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process for biotransformation of organic substrates to biohythane. The first stage involves in hydrolysis, acidogensis and acetogenesis, whereas the second stage involves in methanogenesis. The first stage implicates the conversion of complex organic polymeric substances in to monomeric substances by hydrolysation using hydrolytic microorganisms. The organic monomers are then converted to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, alcohols, intermediate metabolites and lactic acid by the acidogenic bacteria. The optimal conditions for the first stage require pH of 5–6 at 37 °C for 1–3 days [24]. The second stage involves in the bioconversion of alcohols, intermediate metabolites and lactic acid into methane and carbon dioxide by using methanogens at pH 7–8 and 37 °C for 10–15 days [25]. Moreover, methanogens utilize the volatile fatty acids generated in the previous stage for producing methane. Furthermore, the shifting of intermediate metabolites from first to second stage also enhances the hydrogen and methane yield, thereby increasing the energy as a whole [26]. The intermediate metabolites majorly formed during fermentation of organic waste are acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid with a tolerance limit of 2400 mg L−1, 1800 mg L−1 and 900 mg L−1 respectively during acetogenesis [101]. During the two-stage process, the composition of methane is 60–65%, along with other by-products such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. Some of the benefits of the two-stage process are the flexibility in changing the hydrogen/methane ratio, decrease in the time taken for fermentation, increase in the degradation efficiency, generation of numerous products, increased energy recovery and its ecofriendly nature [3,4,11]. Additionally, enrichment of selective microbes can also be performed during acidogenesis and methanogenesis [27]. Apart from this, two-stage process also aids in decreasing the fermentation time with increased organic loading rate, and separate optimization for hydrogen and methane production respectively [10]. In addition, the two-stage process has better reliability in terms of mechanical aspects, increased shock resistance on applying heavy loads, better regulation of pH, high efficiency in converting organic substrates into energy and reduced chance of failure in the process due to volatile fatty acid accumulation [4,11,24]. Hence, the most effective biohythane synthesis process is by using two steps for the synthesis of biohydrogen and biomethane. Apart from producing two fuels, this technique allows for better energy recovery in contrast to the conventional approach."
4,Single-stage process for biohythane production,"3.2 Single-stage process for biohythane production The single stage process consists of a single fermenter to undergo four processes like hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogensis. Hydrolysis comprises of the degradation of complex macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in to soluble organic compounds such as sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, peptides and amines. During acidogenesis, compounds such as volatile fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones are generated along with hydrogen. The third stage or acetogenesis involves in the production of acetic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The final methanogenesis step generates methane and carbon dioxide [28]. During methanogenesis, 50–75% methane is generated along with other byproducts such as 25–50% carbon dioxide and 2–8% nitrogen with trace amount of hydrogen, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide [29]. During the acidogenic and acetogenic processes, large amount of volatile fatty acids are generated resulting in the reduction of pH, thereby contributing to lower hydrogen and methane yield [30]. Generally, hydrogen producers have low tolerance to increased concentration of volatile fatty acids in the fermenter. Some of the intermediate metabolites majorly present are acetate, butyrate and propionate [5]. Similarly, excessive accumulation of hydrogen leads to failure in the methanogenesis step. In addition, single stage anaerobic digestion produces approximately 30–40% carbon dioxide along with methane, thereby contributing significantly to green house gas emission [31]. Although single-stage anaerobic digestion for production of biohythane exists, the two-stage anaerobic digestion process performs better in terms of biokinetics than its single stage counterpart. The microbial interaction affect the single stage process significantly during the synthesis of biohythane. In the single stage anaerobic digestion, the hydrogen production is the rate limiting step and also influences the constituents of biohythane. The biggest disadvantage of the single-step method is in not being able to attain an ideal hydrogen/methane ratio, thereby causing unstable biohythane yield. Some of the major factors contributing to the biohythane generation include the biomass type, inoculum, pretreatment methods, pH, temperature, retention time, substrate loading rate, redox potential and bioreactor design [32,33]. The use of single-stage biohythane production technique eliminates additional reactor cost. Furthermore, it is more economical due to its lesser demand for controls unlike the two-stage anaerobic digestion process, which contains individual reactors for acidogenesis and methanogenesis. Nevertheless, in comparison with the single-stage biohythane generation technique, the two-stage method facilitates better recovery of energy, biodegradation efficiency, bioreactor stability, methane generation rate and high purity of gases generated."
5,Microorganisms involved in biohythane production,"In order to produce biohythane by two-stage fermentative method, it is essential to select appropriate microorganisms that can generate hydrogen and methane in adequate ratios [34]. Table 2 discusses the metabolic characteristics of the predominant acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms during anaerobic digestion. Due to the variations in the physiology, nutrient requirement, growth kinetics and susceptibility to the external stimulus by the acetogens and methanogens, they must be cultivated in their respective optimal conditions [35,36]. Generally, the raw materials that undergo fermentation should be in synergism with the microbes under optimal conditions to generate hydrogen and methane gas [37]. Among the hydrogen producers, chemoautotrophs were found to be very efficient. Obligate anaerobes like Clostridium generate large amount of hydrogen in mesophilic condition, with a theoretical hydrogen yield of approximately 2.1–2.2 mol H2 mol−1 sugar [38]. Whereas, the biohydrogen yield of facultative anaerobic bacteria like Enterobacter was found to be 1 mol H2 mol−1 sugar in mesophilic condition [39]. In general, archaea are categoried into three types depending on their metabolic pathways like acetoclastic archaea, methylotrophic archaea and carbon dioxide reducing archaea [2]. Methane is produced by the anaerobic fermentation of volatile fatty acids, lactic acid, alcohols, bicarbonates and carbon dioxide by the use of such bacteria. Methane can also be generated by the fermentation of hydrogen, acetic acid and carbon dioxide using Methanospirillum, Methanoculleus and Methanococcus species [5]. Under thermophilic conditions, methane can be generated using hydrogenotrophic methanogens like Methanosarcina and Methanothermobacter. In extreme thermophilic conditions like 85 °C, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and formate gets assimilated by Methanothermus and Methanothermococuus species to generate methane [6]. For generating biohythane with a specific hydrogen/methane ratio, the microbial growth should be regulated based on their characteristics for facilitating the production of biohydrogen and biomethane respectively. The key difference between the two stages of anaerobic digestion for biohydrogen and biomethane generation is the medium's pH. The optimal pH for the first stage is between 5.5 and 6.5, and between 7 and 7.5 for the second stage [2]. Different substrates fermented by microorganisms generate different hydrogen/methane ratios based on their composition. Moreover, the rate limiting hydrogen generation step can be enhanced by regulating the hydrogen-producing microbes in appropriate conditions, resulting in improved hydrogen/methane ratio. Microbial strains such as Thermococcus kodakaraenae and Clostridium thermocellum have the ability to biodegrade the cellulosic substrates and generate hydrogen simultaneously [40]. However, the rate of the reaction was low with reduced hydrogen yield, but with an increase in the hydrogen/methane ratio. It is important to eliminate hydrogen consuming microbes in the hydrogenic reactor. Moreover, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens may remain active in acidic environment, and one potential solution is to facilitate hydrogen fermentation in thermophilic environment [1]. Generally, the stability of the microbes in the two-stage process play an important part in the biohythane generation. The technique of fermenting hydrogen and methane separately may sometimes adversely affect the transfer of hydrogen and the syntrophic interaction between the hydrogen-producers and methanogens [2]. Therefore, balancing the microbial growth during two-stage process as per their physiological and thermodynamic properties enhance the biohythane yield."
6,Substrates for biohythane production,"The economic efficiency of biohythane production greatly depends on the cost of substrate and pretreatment technique involved. Although biodegradation of simple sugars like glucose, sucrose and starch have high hydrogen yield, the process is not cost-efficient. Therefore, the use of low cost feedstock with fermentable complex sugars have proved to be a great substitute. The utilization of biowaste from our daily life containing complex carbohydrates, proteins and lipids can contribute to an economically sustainable form of energy generation. The highest yield of biohythane was obtained from carbohydrates, followed by proteins and peptides, while fat (oil and grease) has a lower yield. However, co-digestion of substrates rich in proteins and fat with carbohydrates proves to enhance the biohythane yield compared to mono-digestion apart from efficient utilization of organic waste. Therefore, the utilization of agricultural waste, food waste, brewery processing waste, oil processing waste, algal biomass etc.. have been very efficient in generating biohythane. Table 3 presents the fermentation data of different substrates for enhanced biohydrogen and biomethane production."
7,Cellulosic substrates,"5.1 Cellulosic substrates Lignocellulosic biomass containing complex sugars can generate hydrogen more effectively compared to substrates that are rich in proteins and lipids, that contribute towards methane generation [41]. Agri-based lignocellulosic biomass such as sugar beet, rice bran, wheat bran, maize, cassava residue, sweet sorghum, corn silage, peanut, hazelnut shell etc.. are affordable and generate good amount of biohythane [2,7,42]. These substrates also contain a huge proportion of carbohydrate and nitrogen thereby contributing to an adequate Carbon/Nitrogen ratio necessary for generating hydrogen and methane [5]. Lignocellulosic biomass generally have strong bonds between cellulose and lignin, resulting in poor digestibility of the substrate in the bioreactor, therefore requiring pretreatment before fermentation [2]."
8,Food waste,"5.2 Food waste The utilization of food waste as a raw material for anaerobic fermentation proves to be advantageous not only in providing an excellent source of energy, but also in eliminating the solid biowaste. The organic content in the fruit and vegetable waste is present in the form of volatile solids that facilitate the biogas production. Sometimes, the protein in the substrate is almost equal to the carbohydrate present. Certain fruits and vegetables contain approximately 39.3% cellulose and 21.3% lignin, thereby hindering the anaerobic digestion process resulting in decreased methane generation [43]. In addition, the pH of food waste varies greatly and undergoes frequent changes in the physiochemical characteristics. Citrus fruit wastes consists of essential oils that interfere with the anaerobic digestion process. Limonene present in the essential oils hinder the digestion process, thereby resulting in reduced methane yield [44]. Food waste, unlike sugar-rich substrates, consists of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids."
9,Brewery waste,"5.3 Brewery waste Brewer's spent grain, ethanol stillage, vinasse and pot ale are some of the brewery processing wastes obtained from beer, tequila and whiskey industries [76,80]. Vinasse is obtained from sugarcane and brewing industries, whereas pot ale is obtained from malt whisky distilleries [78]. Brewery waste consists of approximately 9–25% cellulose and 7–28% lignin [87]. When these wastes undergo anaerobic digestion, the fermentable sugars and macronutrients are utilized to generate biogas. However, the lignocellulosic substrates are rich in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, thereby reducing the biogas generation. This is due to the slow decaying property of the lignocellulosic biomass, and the existence of polyphenols [37]. Furthermore, pot ale consists of high amount of proteins that increase the ammonia concentration, thereby inhibiting the methanogens [75]."
10,Dairy waste,"5.4 Dairy waste Cheese whey and lactose are the liquid by-products obtained from dairy waste. Both these substrates consist of proteins, nitrogen, phosphorus, oil, grease and mineral salt, and are also acidic in nature [2]. The cheese processing waste mainly consists of lactose in whey waste, contributing to almost 70% of liquid effluent [72]. Other constituents of cheese processing waste are lipids, vitamins, salts like sodium chloride and potassium chloride, trace minerals, citric acid and uric acid [25]. Dairy waste possess characteristics like acidic pH, increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) level above 80 g L−1 and 50 g L−1 respectively, representing high contamination, and therefore cannot be disposed directly on land or aquatic system [72]. Therefore, dairy waste containing high lactose levels could be utilized for biohydrogen and biomethane generation. The acidic nature of dairy waste negatively influences the digestion process, thereby decreasing the biomethane yield [2]. Sometimes, this condition gets aggravated due to a sharp fall in pH, reduced buffering capacity and volatile fatty acid accumulation."
11,Livestock waste,"5.5 Livestock waste In general, slaughterhouses generate numerous waste materials such as dried blood, bones, skin, carcass and feet. It is to be noted that almost 50% of the slaughtered animal falls under the category of slaughterhouse waste [45]. This type of waste consists of huge amount of proteins, lipids, COD, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), and lower carbohydrates with acidic pH [71,82]. Generally, elevated COD level along with the microbial flora transform these animal waste into being more polluted, and hence cannot be disposed directly into the ecosystem [73]. Furthermore, the presence of high amount of protein in the slaughterhouse waste can generate ammonia, thereby inhibiting the anaerobic digestion process [81]. The process inhibition generally occurs during the rate limiting hydrolysis step."
12,Other wastes,"5.6 Other wastes Oil processing waste is generally acidic in nature, and also contains macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus [69]. Moreover, these wastes also consist of phenolic compounds that possess recalcitrant properties, thereby resulting in degradation issues [70]. However, palm oil mill effluent is widely utilized as feedstock for biohydrogen generation by dark fermentation. An other commonly used substrate is macroalgae, which are rich in polysaccharides, with negligible amount of lignin, thereby proving to be a great feedstock for biofuel generation [4]."
13,Techniques for enhanced biohythane production,
14,Pretreatment,"6.1 Pretreatment One of the major factor contributing to the biohydrogen and biomethane yield is the composition of carbohydrates in the fermentable feedstock. Carbohydrates are found to be abundant in organic substrates like food waste, agricultural waste, algae etc.. However, the complex sugars present in these substrates cannot be fermented easily to generate bioenergy. Therefore, it is essential for such substrates to undergo pretreatment in order to enhance the fermentation process, thereby improving the biohythane yield [2]. Some of the pretreatment techniques used to hydrolyze the organic waste are physical, mechanical, physico-chemical, bio-chemical, thermal, biological and combination techniques. All of these techniques have both advantages and disadvantages, and the best suitable pretreatment method for the substrate should be selected based on its composition and type. Pretreatment techniques such as microwave, ultrasound, hydrodynamic cavitation, pulsed electric field, pyrolysis, and autoclave require shorter pretreatment time and are highly efficient in cell disruption, however it consumes high energy and might result in structural modification and formation of free radicals. An ideal pretreatment technique must have the ability to hydrolyze the substrate efficiently and also eliminate the accumulation of inhibitors during the acetogenic and methanogenic stage [22]. Sometimes, combined pretreatment techniques are more effective rather than applying one technique. Pretreatment guarantees the availability and usability of the sugar compounds to the microorganisms for the catalytic action of enzymes [23]."
15,Co-digestion,"6.2 Co-digestion The technique of co-digesting food waste with other biowaste improves the ability to dilute the toxic substances. Co-digestion of substrates such as fruit and vegetable waste, compost and bovine manure improves the recovery of hydrogen and methane [2]. For dairy waste, mono-digestion of cheese whey produced more biomethane, whereas cheese whey co-digested with cattle slurry produced more biohydrogen [72]. In addition, the pH of the fermentation system can be maintained without the use of chemicals by co-digestion. Hence, the utilization of substrates such as animal waste, crop residues, phytomass and sewage sludge for co-digesting with the main substrate reduces the digestion time [1]."
16,Management of microbial consortia,"6.3 Management of microbial consortia The most important factor contributing to efficient biohythane production by two-stage process is in controlling the microbial population as required [46]. Two groups of microbes work in synergism in the acetogenic and methanogenic stage to generate biohythane. The indigenous microbial species in the fermentation system are not capable of fermenting substrates for a prolonged period of time, and are ineffective in producing biohydrogen and biomethane simultaneously [47]. The native microbial species do not have the ability to hydrolyze all kinds of substrates, and therefore require pre-treatment. Also, the rate of hydrogen production is lower in indigenous microbes compared to the pure cultures [14]. Genetically engineered microbes assist in simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of substrates, resulting in enhanced biohythane productivity. Recently, direct bioprocess consisting of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation has gained more attention as the utilization of microbial strains that are capable of producing cellulolytic enzymes and hydrogen simultaneously can make the process less expensive. Substrate hydrolysis and fermentation can also be enhanced by bioaugmentation, by providing nutrients exogenously or by inducing a strain with adequate enzymatic arsenal into the consortia [34]. Some of the advantages of bioaugmentation are: (i) no pretreatment of substrate required; (ii) helps reduce the organic loading rate of the bioreactor; (iii) inhibits volatile fatty acid accumulation during anaerobic fermentation [35,36]. Identifying potential strains and understanding their behaviour towards biohythane production is very important. The by-products formed during fermentation are used up by the reducing equivalents like nicontinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, resulting in enhanced hydrogen yield [2]. A major by-product that utilizes the electron necessary for hydrogenase enzyme and hinders the neutralization step is lactic acid [22]. Also, the methanogenesis step is inhibited by the generation of propionic and butyric acid [25]. Therefore, metabolically engineered strains should be designed to block the undesirable pathways involved in alcohol and lactic acid generation. This in turn results in increased reducing equivalents, thereby enhancing the total hydrogen and methane generation."
17,Process integration,"6.4 Process integration The low-cost biohythane generation majorly depends on the ability to generate biohydrogen and biomethane independently from a sustainable organic substrate. The two-stage process for producing biohythane consists of hydrogenesis and methanogenesis step, that require optimization for biohydrogen and biomethane generation separately. Table 4 presents the optimized conditions of the major performance indicators for enhanced biohydrogen and biomethane production. Generally, fermentation technique requires energy for heating, digestate recirculation and separation of gases, that ultimately increase the operation cost [2]. Therefore, integrating the two-stage process to a continuous system for biohythane generation reduces the operational costs and helps to understand the reaction biokinetics [23]. Fig. 3 illustrates an integrated two-stage system for biohythane generation from organic wastes, and Fig. 4 portrays the major factors contributing to sustainable biohythane production by anaerobic fermentation process. Some of the factors influencing the integration of the two-stage process are the microbial culture, volatile fatty acid accumulation, reactor configuration, retention time and substrate loading rate [2,24]. The bioreactor configuration and fermentation mode with optimal mixing of digestate assists in maintaining synergism within the microbes without disturbing their metabolism [22]. In addition, maintenance of short hydraulic retention time, along with recirculation of digestate aids in sustaining the required microbial community within the reactor. The hydrogen producers generate volatile fatty acids during acidogenesis, that contribute further as a source for methane generation during methanogenesis [2]. However, utilization of the residue from acidogenic phase in the methanogenic phase is slightly complicated during continuous operation. Therefore, online surveillance of important parameters and quality control with an integrated system is vital for enhancing biohythane production. Furthermore, digestate recirculation from methanogenic to acetogenic reactor causes harm to the hydrogen producers. However, this can be by-passed by implementing techniques such as increase in organic loading rate, recirculation of digestate by membrane filtration and bio-augmentation [3,11]. For substrates with total solids above 15%, dry anaerobic digestion in a leaching bed reactor is more appropriate for biohydrogen generation during the first step of the two-stage process. The leachate can then be utilized in the second stage for methane generation in high rate reactors like upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and expanded granule sludge bed reactor [70]. For substrates with total solids between 2 and 12%, continous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is more appropriate for the first stage, while the reactor configuration for the second stage depends solely on the type of digestate generated from the first stage. In addition, CSTR could be used for any substrate, and is also energy efficient, while UASB is more effective for liquid substrates [93]. However, for liquid substrates with total solids less than 2%, UASB is more suitable for both hydrogen and methane production [2]. There are two main factors that must be to be considered during the process integration. First, the extraction of slurry from the first reactor after hydrogen production could be directly supplied to the second reactor for methane generation or to the settling tank. The benefit of installing a settling tank in the middle of the two stages is to restore the microbes from the first stage and to alter the pH required for optimal methane generation [31]. Next, the residue from the second stage could either be let outside or recirculated to the methanogenic or hydrogenic reactor. Recirculation of slurry to the methanogenic reactor might help in sustaining the pH and also avoid organic overloading. Whereas, recirculation to the hydrogenic reactor will provide pH buffer and supply increased amount of hydrogenic microbes, however, it will also introduce unwanted hydrogen-consuming microbes to the reactor. Some of the techniques to overcome this issue are membrane filtration of methanogenic slurry from the second stage, maintaining a temperature-phased process, domestication of hydrogenic microbes and increasing the organic loading rate of the hydrogenic reactor [101]. However, process integration has certain limitations such as design complexity and high capital and maintenance cost. In order to achieve continuous hydrogen and methane production, microbial management between the two stages as well as successful integration of the reactor plays a major role. The process performance could be improved by controlling the parameters like pH, retention time and reflex ratio. Although reflex ratio is used to regulate the two-stage process, the hydrogen/methane ratio can be enhanced by improving the rate of recirculation to biomethane reactor. Furthermore, the ratio could be decreased with increased biomethane generation by supplying high organic loading due to reduced rate of recirculation [23]. Table 5 presents the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques for enhanced biohythane production."
18,Techno-economic aspect of biohythane production,"Generally, the two-stage process generates more energy, depending on the chemical energy present in the substrate. In comparison with the single stage anaerobic fermentation process involved in biogas generation, the two-stage process needs more energy for heating, transferring effluents and for product recovery [3]. Some of the limitations in the biohythane generation by two-stage process are the complicated operational techniques and higher operation costs. The application of a single stage anaerobic digestion process could tackle these issues and produce hydrogen and methane simultaneously. However, it is essential to clearly understand the process involved in the separation phase of hydrogen and methane to upgrade the reactors to full-size. The single stage process for large scale biohythane production faces certain challenges in relation to dealing with the residues produced during the fermentation process. One of the key residue produced in the system is the volatile fatty acids. Hence, the single stage process demands an additional conversion step for producing hydrogen, methane, electricity and other chemicals. Also, in single stage anaerobic digestion, the theoretical hydrogen yield is 4 mol mol−1 of glucose. i.e. the energy recovery is minimal when compared to other biotechnological methods, due to the shift in the metabolic pathways [2]. Therefore, this technique is not energy and cost efficient, and hence should be accompanied by other advanced methods. Whereas, the energy recovery is higher in two-stage process when compared to the conventional biogas generation method, in spite of using two separate reactors for the production of biohythane [4]. Nevertheless, some energy is lost throughout the fermentation process because of the shifting of stages and release of products. Scaling up of biohythane production process is very important due to its huge benefits as a biofuel. Energy evaluation includes the amount of the energy consumed and produced at different stages during biohythane generation [50]. For measuring the energy consumed during the production process, the key factors to be considered are the amount of energy necessary for heating, dewatering, mixing and pumping [4,10]. Whereas, the amount of energy recovered is estimated from the amount of energy produced from hydrogen and methane generation [12]. The techno-economic assessment reveals the income and expenditure throughout the operation of the biohythane production unit. For calculating the overall cost of the project, some of the factors considered are manpower, chemicals, equipment, maintenance and transportation costs. The co-production of hydrogen and methane in the two-stage process escalatesthe total energy recovery of 100% and 30% respectively in comparison with the single-stage process [101]. The two-stage process also benefits the net energy balance calculated based on energy input such as energy required for pretreatment and maintaining the temperature of the system, and the energy output such as gases generated, compared to single-stage hydrogen or methane fermentation [2]. Therefore, the production of biohythane is considerd to be techno-economically feasible and has superior environmental advantages like reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission in to the atmosphere compared to petrol, diesel and compressed natural gas."
19,Conclusion and future prospects,"The production of biohythane from organic waste has the advantage of transforming the waste matter into bioenergy by a sustainable, cheap and environmental friendly method. The utilization of biohythane as an automobile fuel leads to greener economy because of its clean design, improved heat and fuel efficacy, thereby enabling the combustion engines to operate efficiently. Furthermore, optimal hydrogen blend in biohythane can help reduce greenhouse gas emission. This review article extensively discusses the technical constraints and future prospectives for sustainable biohythane production. The problems related to commercialization of the integrated biohythane generation have also been discussed. Moreover, strategies for improving the efficacy of the process like pre-treatment, co-digestion, optimization of operational factors, management of microbial consortium and process integration have been presented. Pre-treatment assists in hydrolyzing the substrate for better accessibility to the microorganisms. Even though pre-treatment methods modify the biochemistry of the feedstock, combined techniques are more effective in increasing the product yield. Furthermore, co-digestion contributes towards supply of nutrients, dilution of inhibitory substances, synergism between microorganisms and financial stability. Although two-stage anaerobic digestion is more attractive, their increased maintenance issues and expenditure have limited the commercialization of this technology. Thus, solving these problems could propel the utilization of organic waste forward from lab scale to industrial scale for biohythane generation. Employment of high-rate reactors for biohythane production is more efficient and safe, with improved yield. Combining other methods with the existing ones, such as integrating dark fermentation with microbial fuel cells play an important part in the generation of new by-products. Likewise, the generation of biomethane using hybrid techniques could also contribute to higher yields of biohythane. Moreover, substrate degradation can be enhanced by the use of new microbes. Analyzing the mixed microbial consortium and decoding the unidentified microbes help in enhancing the biohythane production. Furthermore, enhanced biohythane quality and production rate can be obtained by selecting the most feasible substrates, controlling the microbial growth, using metabolically engineered strains and optimizing the bioreactor design. Finally, based on the benefits of hythane against compressed natural gas in terms of fuel efficiency and pollution control, it is expected that biohythane can effectively perform as a next-generation clean biofuel. Although biohythane has many advantages compared to other liquid fuels like petrol and diesel, the major obstacle for adopting biohythane as an automotive fuel is due to the present gas distribution system. Although methane distribution system is mature with approximately 12 million vehicles already running in the world, the presence of hydrogen gas in biohythane requires certain modifications in the gas pipeline such as adoption of steel that is less prone to hydrogen embrittlement under pressure. However, changes to the current system needs greater initial investment and longer duration for construction, after which hythane will become the most sustainable form of energy."
