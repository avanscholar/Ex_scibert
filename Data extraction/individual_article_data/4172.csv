0,Introduction,"The interest on materials derived from renewable resources is growing due to the environmental and economic concerns linked to the waste accumulation and the extensive use of fossil-based feedstocks [1]. Cork is the outer bark of the tree Quercus suber L. and its major constituents are suberin (33–50%), lignin (13–29%), polysaccharides (6–25%) and some extractives (8.5–24%) [2,3]. Cork presents closed cell structure and unique properties such as low density and thermal conductivity hydrophobicity, fire resistance, and good insulation properties [2–4]. This material is mainly processed for the production of cork stoppers and thermal insulation materials. However 20% of the cork production, called “cork powder” is not suitable for conventional cork production due to its low granulometry, which is less than 250 μm, and it is rather burned to produce energy [5]. With the aim to valorize cork residues, cork powder is generally agglomerated with polyurethane resins [6,7]. Otherwise, cork powder could be also used in small amount (i.e. <2% on weight basis) to modify the rheology of polymer [8], to increase the impact toughness of epoxy [9] or very recently to decrease the friability of biobased phenolic foams [10]. When the diameter of the granulometry is higher than 250 μm, it is necessary to talk about “cork granules”. Via extrusion processes, cork granules or powder can be also incorporated into thermoplastic matrix such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) [11–14]. Cork composites processed with biodegradable and/or biobased matrix were investigated explored by Vilela et al. or Fernandes et al. with the use of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(hydroxybutyrate co hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) [15,16]. The agglomeration of cork with thermosetting matrix is limited to the using of epoxy resin with the aim to make cork stoppers [6,7] or build lightweight structures [17–20]. For preparing 100% biobased cork-thermoset composites, the available matrices from renewable resources are rather limited and there is no examples in the actual literature. Indeed, biobased thermosets includes among others biobased epoxies (e.g. epoxidized vegetable oils, epoxidized lignins, epoxidized cardanols), biobased phenolics or biobased PUR. For years, poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) has an excellent track record for its use as biobased thermoset resin mainly explained by its high carbon content and high chemical and thermal resistance. Indeed PFA is employed for the preparation fire resistant and carbonaceous materials, and as binders for various applications such as foundry molds [21,22]. Moreover, the in-situ formation of a PFA network within softwood allows increasing wood durability [23]. PFA based cellulosic composites have been prepared with natural fibers such as kenaf [24] or flax [25,26]. From a polymerization point of view, PFA is obtained via the cationic polycondensation of furfuryl alcohol [27–30]. This furanic building block is indirectly obtained from xylose-rich biomass feedstocks such as hemicellulosic residues contained in sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, birch wood and so on [31]. To our knowledge, the combination of PFA with cork residues such as cork powder or larger cork granules has never been investigated while it could present great interests. For instance, both cork and PFA have individually good intrinsic thermal properties so we could expect that PFA/cork composites should present relatively high thermal performances. The aim of this paper is therefore to prepare PFA/cork 100% biobased composites with different resin/filler ratio and to show that good interfacial interactions were obtained. To this end, FT-IR spectroscopy, morphological observations by SEM, thermogravimetric analyses, dynamic mechanical analyses, tensile tests and water absorption tests were conducted on PFA/cork samples to highlight their main structural and physical properties. Both cork powder with low particle size (i.e. <200 µm) and larger granulates (i.e. 2–4 mm) will be employed for preparation of Cork/PFA composites."
1,Experimental section,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Furfuryl alcohol (FA) (purity: ≥98%) as monomer and maleic anhydride (MA) (purity: ≥99%) as polymerization catalyst were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. In this work, two particle size of cork are compared: cork powder and macro- agglomerated cork. Cork powder and macro-agglomerated cork were generously supplied by the company Liège-Mélior (Fréjus, France). Macro-agglomerated cork particles were previously classified and their sizes are comprised between 2 and 4 mm. In this study macro-agglomerated cork will be named as “cork granules”. Cork powder comes from cork residues and its particle size distribution is presented in Fig. 1 . This size distribution was obtained from a square mesh sieve analysis starting from 2 g of cork powder."
3,Poly(furfuryl alcohol) preparation,2.2 Poly(furfuryl alcohol) preparation Furfuryl alcohol was mixed with maleic anhydride (2% by weight) at ambient temperature. Then the mixture was heated at 100 °C during 45 min under magnetic stirring until the obtention of a fluid PFA resin having a dynamic viscosity of about 0.5 Pa s. This PFA resin has a pH of 2.8 (measured at 50 w/w % in water) and a density of 1.4.
4,Compounding and processing,"2.3 Compounding and processing For each cork/PFA ratio presented in Table 1 , ethanol (96%) was first mixed with PFA to reach an ethanol/PFA w/w ratio of 30%. Addition of ethanol aims at reducing the PFA viscosity and at favouring the impregnation with cork. The weight ratio of the different samples is summarized in Table 1. Then the mixture was inserted in a PTFE mould and was heated at 160 °C during 45 min under compression with a pressure of 10 bars. The length of the mould is 105 mm, the width is 60 mm and the thickness is 75 mm. After demoulding, the composite was heated in a ventilated oven during 2 h at 180 °C to complete the curing of PFA and to allow release of volatiles (e.g. water from the polycondensation of PFA)."
5,Dimensional stability,"2.4 Dimensional stability Dimensional stability of composites was determined by immersing the specimens in distilled water at 25 °C in different tubes for different times (24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 120 h). Then, specimens were dried under vacuum at 70 °C during 40 min and were stabilized in a desiccator. After immersion, the excess of water on the specimens’ surface was carefully removed. They were immediately weighed and their thicknesses were measured. The percentage of water absorption, WA, was calculated at a certain time as: (1) W A % = w t - w 0 w 0 ∗ 100 where w0 is the initial weight of the specimen and wt is the weight of the specimen after the immersion time."
6,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),2.5 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) Composites were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The spectra were acquired between 4000 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 with a Bruker TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer employed in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode using a diamond crystal. 64 scans were accumulated with a resolution of 2 cm−1.
7,Scanning electronic microscopy,2.6 Scanning electronic microscopy The fracture morphologies of composites samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL 6700F microscope equipped with a field emission gun. The electron beam voltage was fixed to 1 kV. The samples were mounted on the microscope studs using silver colloidal paste and sputter coated with gold palladium.
8,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),2.7 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermogravimetric measurements were made on a TGA 851e from Mettler–Toledo. The microbalance has a precision of ±0.1 mg and was kept at constant temperature (22 °C) during analyses to avoid the variation of weight measurement with temperature. Samples with a weight between 6 and 10 mg were placed into 70 μL alumina pans. Samples were heated between 25 °C and 800 °C at 10 °C/min under air flow (50 mL/min).
9,Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA),"2.8 Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) The viscoelastic behaviour is determined by means of Dynamical Mechanical Analysis (DMA) on a Mettler-Toledo DMA-1 in tensile mode. Temperature scans were accomplished from − 100 °C to 200 °C at 2 °C/min with a frequency of 1 Hz and a displacement of 2 μm in an auto-tension mode. The typical size of samples was 5 × 4 × 1.2 mm (length, width and thickness)."
10,Tensile tests,2.9 Tensile tests Tensile tests were conducted using a Shimadzu EZ-LX testing machine standard with a maximal tensile strength of 1 kN. The sample length during tensile test experiments was set at 15 mm and arms velocity was 5 mm/min. Samples were cut with a thickness of 1.5 mm and a width of 3 mm.
11,Results and discussion,
12,Composite morphology,"3.1 Composite morphology Fig. 2 shows SEM images of heated compressed cork powder, cork granules and cork/PFA composites as CPFA25P, CPFA25G, CPFA50P. As shown in Fig. 2, the compression molding process of cork powder and cork granules logically induces a compression of cork cells. For compressed cork granules the frontier between two granules is clearly visible on SEM images. For CPFA25P and CPFA25G, cork cells are also compressed but some of them are filled with PFA. In the case of CPFA25P, the composite shows a homogeneous structure without any phase separations and with a good interfacial adhesion. In that case, the morphology of and the integrity of cork are preserved. For CPFA25G, there is some regions where PFA has totally filled cork cells. The interface between cork cells filled by PFA are still visible which is testifying a good adhesion between PFA and cork granules. On the other hand, when larger amount of PFA is employed, i.e. for CPFA50P, the cork cells are no longer observable since they were entirely filled and covered with PFA. The morphology of CPFA50P is then completely different from CPFA25P. However it appears that the morphology of CPFA50P is homogeneous and that there is no phase separation between cork and PFA."
13,Infrared spectroscopy,"3.2 Infrared spectroscopy FTIR spectra of cork and cork/PFA composites (agglomerated with cork powder) are shown in Fig. 3 . The spectrum of cork show the characteristic bands of both suberin, lignin and polysaccharides present in cork. The broad carbonyl band peaking at 1735 cm−1 is typical of aliphatic esters and acids of suberin while the band at 1170 cm−1 is also typical of C-O-C ester band in suberin. Strong peaks at 2920 and 2845 cm−1 represents respectively the asymmetrical and the symmetrical vibration of aliphatic C-H stretching in suberin. The band at 1508 cm−1, 1466 cm−1 and 1258 cm−1 are more representative of guaicylpropane units from lignin present in cork [32]. Finally the bands peaking at 1035 and 1087 cm−1 correspond to C-O of cellulosic and hemicellulosic moieties in cork. The FTIR spectrum of neat cross-linked PFA (Fig. 3) is in agreement with previous studies [30,33–35] and exhibits the typical peaks at 1510 cm−1 (furanic CC bending), 1013 cm−1 (furan CO stretching and in plane CH wagging) and 785 cm−1 (CH out of plane wagging). Moreover, the Diel-Alder CC cycloadduct and the CO of ketonic structures formed during furan ring opening reaction are highlighted with the broad peak at 1710 cm−1 [33–35].The FTIR spectra of composite samples still show the main assignments from cork with some noticeable changes. First the OH stretching band peaking around 3383 cm−1 in cork spectrum becomes broader when PFA is added in the 3200–3100 cm−1 zone which corresponds to OH bonded. It would mean that the incorporation of PFA lead to a different environment which change significantly the hydrogen bond network in cork. In addition, the CO band at 1735 cm−1 become broader with incorporation of PFA and a new band develops at 1710 cm−1 as it can be observed in PFA spectrum. The development of this band in the composite samples could be ascribed to ketonic structures that are observed in the PFA spectrum [33] or to carboxylic acids that could be formed during hydrolysis of suberin’s esters. Finally, the C-O band at 1032 cm−1 attributed to polysacharrides in cork is progessively shifted to 1013 cm−1 in composite samples. A peak around 1012 cm−1 corresponds to the most intense band in PFA network and is attributed to furanic CH in plane wagging [34,35] as shown in the PFA spectrum. In CPFA50 the peak at 1012 cm−1 is very intense meaning that PFA has a higher contribution compared to the contribution from cellulose/hemicellulose in cork. In the same line, the contribution of the CH out of plane wagging in PFA becomes progressively more important in composite samples."
14,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric curves of PFA, cork powder, cork granules and different PFA/Cork composites are presented in Fig. 4 a and b. Fig. 4a shows the variation of the mass loss with temperature for neat cork (powder or granules), PFA, CPFA15P, CPFA25P, CPFA25G and CPFA50P composites. A first mass loss is observed for cork and PFA/Cork composites at around 300 °C, followed by at least two or three main steps of mass loss. The thermal degradation temperature that corresponds to 10% of mass loss (T10%) occurs around 282 °C for neat cork (Table 2 ). On the other hand, the T10% of PFA is about 378 °C which is in agreement with previous studies [30,33,36] and it underlines its very high thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 4a, addition of 15% of PFA does not increase significantly the degradation temperature T10% (∼292 °C, Table 2) compared to cork powder whereas T10% is shifted of about 21 °C for the composite CPFA50P (T10% ∼303 °C). Thus, incorporation of PFA in cork powder permits to greatly improve the thermal stability of the material compared to raw cork powder. Moreover the rate of the mass loss is slower for the composites CPFA25P and CPFA50P. Fig. 4b shows the derivative curve of mass loss as function of temperature for all the samples. The peak intensity is directly proportional to the degradation rate, it indicates that incorporation of PFA slows down the first decomposition between 250 °C and 375 °C. Cork and CPFA15P present a first peak with a maximum at 329 °C and 347 °C respectively. It was previously shown that degradation of untreated cork occurs in this temperature range [37,38]. This was generally attributed to suberin decomposition [39]. For CPFA50P and CPFA25P, this first peak is very low which indicates that cork decomposition is slowered by the presence of PFA. For CPFA25P and CPFA50P, the thermal decomposition of PFA is highlighted by the DTG peak at T ∼ 430 °C. Above 430 °C, the decomposition is followed by carbonization process in presence of oxygen. The carbonization rate of cork sample pass through a maximum at T = 435 °C which is slightly lower than previous investigations [39]. Carbonization is shifted to higher temperature since neat PFA undergoes carbonization at higher temperature (i.e. for T > 550 °C) in agreement with previous investigations [33,36]. For composites, the carbonization rate is not modified by PFA for CPFA15P and CPFA25P as attested by the same intensities of the DTG peak. In addition, the intensity of DTG peaks attributed to the carbonization are similar for CPFA50P and PFA. As shown in Fig. 2, cork cells in CPFA25P are not totally filled or covered by PFA, while for CPFA50P composite corks cells are totally embedded by the matrix. This explains that the thermal stability of CPFA25P and CPFA15P are close to the one of cork while CPFA50P is closer to the thermal degradation of PFA. To determine the role of the particle size on the thermal behaviour of composites, cork granules were also processed with PFA. Fig. 4 shows the thermogram of cork granules and CPFA25G. Logically, the onset of thermal degradation is shifted to higher temperature in cork granules compared to cork powder due to the lower aspect ratio in granules. A comparison between thermal stability of CPFA25P and CPFA25G is also presented in Fig. 4. It can be noticed that T10% = 299 °C for both samples (Table 2) but the rate of thermal degradation rate is faster for CPFA25G according to DTG curves. Indeed, due to the lower specific surface in granules, the PFA cannot sufficiently embed and protect the cork from decomposition compared to CPFA25P. Carbonization in CPFA25G occurs earlier compared to CPFA25P and its rate is similar to the one of cork granules."
15,Dynamic mechanical analysis,"3.4 Dynamic mechanical analysis Fig. 5 shows the variation of the storage modulus as a function of the temperature. The storage modulus of CPFA50P is twice higher than CPFA25P and CPFA15P and fifty times higher than cork powder samples both in the glassy state and in the rubbery state. Logically, the incorporation of a rigid and cross-linked PFA matrix increases considerably the rigidity of the sample even with ratio as low as 25%. It is worth noting that the storage modulus of CPFA50P is close to the storage modulus of PFA according to Bosq and al [36]. E′ starts to decrease at −20 °C for all the samples. It should correspond to the main relaxation (i.e. the glass transition) of suberin contained in cork. Indeed, the tan(δ) curves presented in Fig. 5b helps to highlight the relaxation phenomena. In the case of cork powder and cork granules an unique relaxation can be observed in Fig. 5b with a maximum of the tan(δ) peak at 19 °C. This can be associated with the suberin α-relaxation. This relaxation corresponds to the transition from a rigid to a rubbery state and is very helpful for the tree to fight against externs threats like wind for example [40]. In the case of cork/PFA composite samples, two peaks can be noticed in the tan(δ) curves. First the relaxation peak of suberin appears at 18 °C, 21 °C and 26 °C respectively for CPFA15P, CPFA25P and CPFA50P. It would mean that the suberin chains are slightly more constrained in the presence of PFA compared to raw cork. It should be noted that the damping capacity associated with the surface of the tan(δ) curve remain important in composites. At 125 °C a small peak is noticed on the tan(δ) curve of CPFA25P. This second peak is more intense and shifted to 130 °C in case of CPFA50P. This rather small relaxation could corresponds to relaxation occurring in PFA chains. The glass transition temperature of PFA occurs between 70 °C and 130 °C depending on the cross-linking conditions [29,33,36,41]. Then this second peak could correspond to the PFA α-relaxation. The presence of two peaks in tan(δ) curves for CPFA50P indicates that the incorporation of PFA in cork powder is not homogeneous. Employing cork granules instead of cork powder does not significantly impact the thermo-mechnical properties as shown on the DMA scan of CPFA25G. Its storage modulus both in the glassy or rubbery state is almost comparable to CPFA25P. The second peak of tan(δ) at 125 °C attributed to PFA relaxation is comparable between CPFA25G and CPFA25P."
16,Tensile tests,"3.5 Tensile tests Results of tensile tests for cork and cork/PFA composites are shown in Fig. 6 . They include the Young modulus, the ultimate strength and the ultimate elongation. The tensile properties of compressed cork is in good agreement with literature data [2]. As shown in Fig. 6, Young modulus and tensile strength are considerably higher for CPFA15, CPFA25 and CPFA50 than for Cork. This is the case both when cork powder and cork granules are employed. It confirms the DMA data in Fig. 6a which show an increase of the storage modulus in presence of the PFA matrix. Interestingly, there is some noticeable difference between the tensile properties of composites prepared with cork powder or cork granules. Both the Young modulus and the tensile strength are higher for cork powder composites. The incorporation of PFA in cork powder permits to obtain more rigid composite materials with better stress transfer compared to cork granules. This is in quite good agreement with the investigation of Jardin and al. who highlighted that cork composites prepared with larger size of cork particles are damaged more easily. Cork with higher size can store less energy per unit of volume since the density of particles is lower [42]. The present tensile properties can be compared with the work of Crouvisier-Urion and al. in which tensile tests have been performed on cork granules agglomerated with a polyurethane resin [6]. Independently of the cork/matrix ratio, the Young modulus ranges between 70 and 188 MPa with PFA while it is much lower with polyurethane resins, i.e. close to 5 MPa [6]. The use of PFA with cork permits to obtain composites with a high rigidity even with only 15% of matrix. Independently of the cork particle size used in these tensile tests, it can be noticed that the ultimate tensile strength pass through a maximum for CPFA25 (Fig. 6). For CPFA15, the quantity of matrix is maybe not sufficient to ensure optimal cohesion between all the cork particles thus leading to slightly lower tensile strength compared to CPFA25. On the other hand, the CPFA50 contains too much matrix thus allowing easier crack initiation and propagation from the PFA thus leading to lower strength. As shown in Fig. 6c, it is also worth noting that the addition of PFA does not compromise the elongation at break indicating that the elasticity of cork is preserved. The suberin α-relaxation observed at around 20 °C (Fig. 5b) might explain such behaviour."
17,Water absorption,"3.6 Water absorption Percentages of water absorption of cork and cork/PFA composites are gathered in Fig. 7 a. Lignin and cellulose moieties in cork contain hydroxyl groups that can interact with water molecules. As shown in Fig. 7a, compressed cork powder sample reaches a maximal absorption after only 6 h. In comparison, CPFA15P, CPFA25P and CPFA50P samples absorb less water and particularly CPFA50P sample for which the water absorption ratio is less than 0.5% after 120 h. PFA is a hydrophobic matrix and we have seen that it will entirely cover the cork cell in CPFA50P (Fig. 2). In that case it results in a hydrophobic composite. In the case of CPFA15P and CPFA25P, some cells are not filled with PFA, therefore water can be absorbed in these empty spaces. The maximum of absorption (∼45%) is lower and is reached later compared to cork, i.e. after 72 h. When the amount of PFA increases, the hydrophobicity of composites is improved. This phenomenon has been also observed by Deka and al. with kenaf biofibers [24]. The water absorption is slower in cork granules. A kinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the rate constant (k) for each set of data. The data were selected between the lowest and the highest value of water absorption and normalised to compute an extent of conversion (α) relative to the increase of water absorption. A non-linear fit was applied to the data using OriginPro 8.5 to evaluate the kinetic parameters according to the following equation: (2) α = 1 - n - 1 k t + 1 1 / ( 1 - n ) where n represents the reaction order, corresponding to a fitting exponent in this case. The extent of conversion α experimental and simulated is represented as a function of the time in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the extent of conversion increases sharply in the first hours and then reach a constant value, which is testifying a decelerating process. In the case of compressed cork powder, the extent of conversion is maximum after only 20 h, no water can be further absorbed in the material. In case of CPFA25P and CPFA50P, the extent of conversion is lower, the absorption of water is enhanced by PFA. The values obtained for k and n are summarized in Table 3 . It can be seen that the rate constant of the process is decreasing when the amount of PFA increases. In fact, for the rate constant of CPFA25P and CPFA50P are respectively 15 times and 35 times lower than for compressed cork powder. The incorporation of PFA allows to decrease the rate of the water absorption in the material. It can be also noticed that the reaction order, n, is relatively constant at the value of 2 for the three samples which means that the kinetic model of water absorption is relatively similar between the different samples [43]. When granules are employed the non-linear fit of Eq. (2) is not accurate (Fig. 7b) and therefore cannot be compared with the data obtained with cork powder. Nevertheless, the composite CPFA25G shows lower water absorption compared to raw granules (Fig. 7a). However, the difference between raw compressed cork and PFA is less pronounced when cork granules are employed."
18,Conclusion,"This work is a first approach for preparing a 100% biobased composite with cork powder and PFA as a thermoset-like resin. Mechanical and thermal properties of PFA/cork were investigated by comparing cork powder and cork granules. Morphological observations were in agreements with water sorption measurements and the thermo-mechanical behaviours of the composite. The PFA has filled empty cork cells and the hydrophobicity of PFA permits to slow down the absorption of water for cork/PFA composites. Then the addition of PFA in cork permits to have a higher thermal degradation temperature from 282 °C for the sample with only cork to 299 °C for CPFA50P. These results testify a better thermal stability for cork/PFA composites. Concerning mechanical properties, the incorporation of PFA in cork cells improved the rigidity of the composites attested by higher modulus in DMA. Both the α-relaxation (glass transition) of suberin contained in cork and PFA were highlighted. An optimum in term of Young modulus and tensile strength is reached for a PFA ratio of 25%. When cork powder is replaced with cork granules, cork/PFA composite is less rigid because of the lower density of the material but a better homogeneity exists between cork and PFA. The use of cork for doing composites, with PFA as matrix for example, permits to have a filled thermoset with improved thermal and mechanical properties. This work have potential applications in the construction industry or the automotive industry for example."
