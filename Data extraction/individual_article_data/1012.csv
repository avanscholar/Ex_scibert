0,Introduction,"Alcohol or ethanol is a well-known and widely consumed substance with significantly high abuse potential, organ toxicity, and teratogenicity (Streissguth et al., 1980; Kim et al., 2016; Sebastiani et al., 2018). The risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption has been neglected as they show no symptoms of brain damage however, imaging of brain has shown that it leads to increased cerebrospinal fluid-filled spaces in the brain (Harper, 2009). Alcohol also causes a decrease in brain size depending on the amount of alcohol consumed during the lifetime. This decrease is mainly in the white matter volume which is also seen in rodent models of alcoholics (Gozzi et al., 2013). Alcohol drinking is known for its addictive nature as well as is responsible for alcohol dependence and tolerance (Koob, 2014; Goldstein and Volkow, 2011;). Long-term use of alcohol affects the functioning of hepatic, immune (Miller et al., 2011), cardiovascular (Whitman et al., 2017), nervous (Mukherjee, 2013), and skeletal systems (Maurel et al., 2012). It is also associated with cancer of the digestive tract, liver (Yokoyama et al., 2020;), prostate (Alattas et al., 2020) and breast (Chu et al., 2020), by dysregulating the development of cells and tissues. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is caused because of heavy alcohol intake during pregnancy and its symptoms include impaired neurobehaviour, impairment in craniofacial arrangement, alterations in the cardiovascular system, defects in the bone developmental and overall growth of the child (May et al., 2013). Although there are a large number of genes and cellular pathways that show alcohol sensitivity, there is no single principle to describe alcohol’s actions (Morozova et al., 2014). With the advances in alcohol research, we now know that alcohol interferes with epigenetic processes, which can be used to discover mechanisms for alcohol toxicity, teratology, and addictive effects (Basavarajappa and Subbanna, 2016). Epigenetic mechanisms are broadly defined as cellular processes that regulate and change genes expression without directly bringing any gene mutations. Discovery of miRNA has opened a new world for the researchers to understand gene regulation involved in alcohol induced changes at molecular level (Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, 2005; Almeida et al., 2011). In brain, miRNAs are highly abundant and play important roles in neuronal differentiation, brain development, synapse formation and plasticity and neurodegeneration (Nowakowski et al., 2018; Follert et al., 2014). Apart from this, miRNAs also play a significant role in mediating the cellular adaptations caused by drug exposure (Jonkman and Kenny, 2013; Most et al., 2014a). Working on miRNAs and their ability to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level in different drug abuse can help to improve our understanding of gene expression for the development of novel therapeutics."
1,MiRNA and its biogenesis,"MiRNA’s (approx 22 nucleotide sequences) are molecules that regulate the action of protein-coding genes. The function of miRNA is to negatively regulate the expression of protein coding genes by binding to its 3′UTR. The binding of miRNA to the target gene results in either inhibition or degradation of the gene. This inhibition/degradation of target gene by miRNA is dependent on the percent of base complementarity between the miRNA and gene (Bushati and Cohen, 2007). The gene regulation by miRNA is very dynamic as a single miRNA can target many mRNAs which in turn can have many target sites for different miRNA’s (Somel et al., 2010). The biogenesis of miRNA is complex multi-step process that starts from its synthesis and ends with target mRNA inhibition/degradation (Fig. 1 ). MiRNA synthesis starts with transcription of miRNA encoded gene by RNA polymerase II to form a primary miRNA (pri‐miRNAs). Thereafter the pri-miRNA gets cleaved by the enzyme complex of DGCR8-Drosha and forms the precursor-miRNA (pre‐miRNAs) (Winter et al., 2009). MiRtrons are the subsections of miRNAs that are formed from introns through processing by spliceosome and the debranching enzyme (Tal and Tanguay, 2012). The pre-miRNA then moves from nucleus to cytoplasm by the exportin 5-Ran-GTP complex, where it is further processed/cleaved by Dicer-TRBP to yield miRNA duplexes (Wang et al., 2011). Further one strand (star strand) of miRNA duplex gets degraded while the other strand forms the mature miRNA. miRNA is also processed by Argonaute 2 (AGO2), through a Dicer-independent pathway (MacFarlane and Murphy, 2010). This mature miRNA is now ready to be loaded into RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) and participates in the gene silencing through mRNA inhibition/degradation (Kim et al., 2008). The first miRNA identified was lin-4 in C. elegans and plays an important role in its development (Ambros et al., 1993; Ruvkun et al., 1993). After this, another miRNA let-7 was identified which regulates the fate of neuronal cells during neuronal development (Johnson et al., 2005). These discoveries stirred up the small RNA research and their role in different processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, stem cell renewal, stress response and metabolism. The discovery of miRNA enabled us to understand how they alter gene expression during the developmental stage and any up-/down- regulation of these would result in developmental disorders (Bhaskaran and Mohan, 2014)."
2,Role of miRNA in neuronal development,"The development of nervous system involves series of well-coordinated events that are controlled by gene expression. (Taverna et al., 2014; Götz et al., 2016). The brain is very rich in miRNAs and the interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs critically regulate neural development starting from early neurogenesis/synaptogenesis to the maintenance of neural function (Fig. 2 ) (Davis et al., 2015). During early development, several different miRNA molecules affect different brain cells for their overall development and maintenance. The Discovery of lin-4, let-7 and miR-125 miRNA in C. elegans was the earliest miRNA known for the activity in early development (Kato and Slack, 2008). Maturation of neuronal cells is characterized by axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, dendritogenesis and guiding neuronal cells to form neuronal circuits (Im and Kenny, 2012) which are carefully regulated by miRNAs. The role of miRNA has been extensively studied by knocking down the Dicer gene. Further studies have revealed that the homozygous Dicer knockdown results in the early death of the mice model. (Bernstein et al., 2003; McLoughlin et al., 2012). Another study conducted by Yadav et al. (2011) has identified the role of miR-200 in neuron differentiation from neuronal stem cells. Dicer plays a very important role in the formation of mature miRNA and loss of Dicer severely affects its function and negatively affects neurogenesis, as well as embryonic development (Fiorenza and Barco, 2016). The conditional/partial knockdown of Dicer has been associated with abnormal neuronal development, disrupted function of the nervous system and embryonic lethality. As low levels of Dicer reduces the ability of neuronal progenitor cells to proliferate which further delays the cell cycle kinetics, hampers the neuronal migration and differentiation of cells, activation of caspase 3 for induction of apoptosis and also increases the differentiation of astrocytes (Saurat et al., 2013). Studies by McLoughlin et al.(2012) and Kersigo et al.(2011) have shown that Dicer knockdown in a rodent model induces microcephalic characteristics in embryos resulting in enhancement of lateral ventricles with decreased cortical thickness. Although the death of neuronal cells due to apoptosis is not a direct effect of Dicer deficiency but is because of the decrease/loss of trophic factors. This hypothesis has been supported by various reports showing the role of FoxG1, Nes, Nex, Emx-1, Camk-1 (McLoughlin et al., 2012; Kersigo et al., 2011). Further Dicer and miRNA controls the cortical stem cells to switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Dicer depletion in the cortical region is associated with the complexity of neuronal lineage and reduces the number and types of neuronal cells. Thus, it gives rise to only 1 type of neuron during the 6-day period of neuron generation. Also, the loss of Dicer during the early phase of neurogenesis will produce a huge number of neurons in the deep layers with no neurons on the upper layers. This failed neuron generation is also because of the altered/failed cortical stem cells. However, this may not affect the process of gliogenesis because of the absence of the dicer gene (Nowakowski et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2010). There are several different studies that give insights into the different roles, that Dicer plays from the early development of the brain to its role in maintaining the homeostasis of the fully developed nervous system (McLoughlin et al., 2012; Varol et al., 2017). Still, it demands more elaborative studies to completely reveal its activity in neuronal development and also its association with other systems."
3,Alcohol and its metabolism,"Alcohol or ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH) is a group of chemical compounds that contains a -OH (hydroxyl) group attached to the carbon atom. It is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugar and has a pleasant smell. It has several uses such as disinfectant, fuel, solvent, preservative and is consumed in the form of alcoholic beverage (Pimentel et al., 2007; Badger, 2002). When consumed in a heavy amount, it can alter emotions both in pleasant and unpleasant ways. When consumed, it passes through the GI tract and gets rapidly absorbed through the small intestine. As the body cannot store alcohol, it gets readily metabolized in the liver and is excreted out (Lundquist et al., 1962; Lieber, 1997). Other than liver, the maximum amount of alcohol is found in the brain and blood. Other than being a depressant it also affects neurotransmitters in brain such as GABA, dopamine and serotonin (Faingold et al., 1998; Morikawa and Morrisett, 2010). After the ingestion of alcohol, it is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract through diffusion, and then the alcohol is rapidly distributed to all the organs. Its metabolism mainly occurs in the liver; other organs that are also involved in the metabolism of alcohol are the stomach, pancreas and brain. Alcohol is metabolized in the body in a stepwise manner by enzymes that convert alcohol into metabolites that can be easily processed and eliminated. Although all the metabolites formed are not harmful except for acetaldehyde, which causes serious damage to the human body. (Guo and Ren, 2010). The major pathways involved in alcohol metabolism are dependent on different enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), catalase (peroxisomes) and microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) containing cytochrome P4502E1 (Jiang et al., 2020). The pathway activation for alcohol metabolism depends on the concentration of alcohol in blood, as with low levels of alcohol, ADH-ALDH enzymes are utilized whereas catalase and MEOS are recruited during high alcohol concentrations (Hurley and Edenberg, 2012; Teschke, 2019). The majority of the alcohol ingested in the body is metabolized by the liver with the help of ADH enzyme that converts alcohol into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a short-lived compound, however it is highly toxic as it binds with other proteins and macromolecules to form adducts. Further, this acetaldehyde is converted into acetate by another enzyme ALDH. This acetate is then broken down into acetyl coenzyme-A which can easily enter into the citric acid cycle to form carbon dioxide and water which can then be easily removed by the body (Nagy, 2004; Gemma et al., 2006). Other than this alcohol is also metabolized in the brain, although the pathway of alcohol metabolism is a bit different from that of the liver and also uses a different set of enzymes i.e., catalases; which are present in the peroxisomes and cytochrome P4502E1; present in microsomes. In brain cells, the production of acetaldehyde is dependent on these two enzymes. Cytochrome P4502E1 converts alcohol to acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide (highly toxic byproduct). Catalase in presence of hydrogen peroxide also converts alcohol to acetaldehyde. This hydrogen peroxide can also be formed by other cytochrome P450 oxidations/ monoamine oxidase/ascorbic acid etc (Zimatkin et al., 1998; Deitrich et al., 2006). Once the acetaldehyde is formed, it is oxidized in the same way as in liver cells."
4,Toxicity of alcohol in the brain,"Alcohol is a known teratogen and its effect on developing and developed brain is known for a very long time (Obe and Ristow, 1979; Streissguth et al., 1980). After nicotine and caffeine, alcohol is the most addictive known substance and consumption of it leads to a state of mental euphoria and disinhibition which makes the alcoholic addicted to it. Worldwide the death toll of alcohol is more than 3 million/year which represents 5.3 % of the global population and it is also a causal factor in more than 200 life-threatening diseases (Lin et al., 2020; World Health Organization (WHO, 2018; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA, 2019). It’s a well-verified fact that consumption of alcohol leads to severesevere brain damage which results in neurodegeneration with decreased volume and functions of the brain (Crews et al., 2000). Accumulating studies on alcohol research points out that alcohol affects the process of neurogenesis, gliogenesis and the coordination between neurons and glial cells leading to atrophy in the brain (Alfonso-Loeches and Guerri, 2011). Memory impairment is the first and most common detectable symptom of alcohol intoxication which can be observed very quickly after alcohol consumption and the degree of impairment increases with increases in alcohol intake. Long term consumption of alcohol can also increase the risk of developing serious changes in the brain which may result in serious diseases directly or indirectly. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a serious neurological disorder, caused by thiamine deficiency, which is very common in alcoholics (Zubaran et al., 1997; Thomson, 2000). WKS is characterized by persistent learning and memory problems. Wernicke’s encephalopathy (early condition) and Korsakoff’s psychosis (later stage) are acute and chronic stages of WKS where 80–90 % of patients of Wernicke’s encephalopathy lately develop Korsakoff’s psychosis (Sivolap and Damulin, 2014; Sunitha et al., 2019)."
5,"Alcohol consumption, brain injury and miRNAs","Numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies on alcohol toxicity have been conducted in the last five decades. Although there is large number of data available for the hazardous effects of alcohol on brain injury, still not much is known in respect to miRNAs. As of now, we already know that miRNA plays a very important role in the development of brain and nervous system. Considering this, the present review brings together the complete data available on miRNA in respect to alcohol induced brain damage. In-vitro alcohol exposure studies on different types of brain cells have shown changes in expression of several miRNAs i.e., miR-9, 21, 153, 335 (Tsai et al., 2014; Miranda, 2012). In an in-vivo study in mice, MiR -9, miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-133 were found to be downregulated after alcohol exposure in cerebellum granule neurons and miR-29b was reported to be downregulated in the cerebrum (Wang et al., 2009). Overexpression of miR-29b is known to protect the brain from alcohol-induced apoptosis. Alcohol upregulates the expression of SP1 transcription factor (murine homolog of human PACT (RAX) and phosphorylation of dsRNA-activated protein kinase) that are involved in inflammation and apoptosis. Overexpression of mir-29b completely blocks the expression of SP1, RAX and phosphorylation of PKR thus inhibiting the alcohol induced activation of these factors (Qi et al., 2014). Alcohol also upregulates the expression of miR-34a which is a pro-apoptotic miRNA (Li et al., 2011) and miR-9, the increased concentration of miR-9 in the supra-optic and striatal neuron of brain targets the calcium and voltage-gated potassium channels. (Pietrzykowski et al., 2008; Treistman and Martin, 2009). Shrinkage of white matter and neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex has long been associated with alcoholism (Crews and Nixon, 2009). It’s been now more than a decade when the role of miRNA in alcohol induced brain damage was identified (Sathyan et al., 2007). Extensive analysis of miRNAs in the frontal cortex region of the brain has identified 35 different miRNAs associated with alcohol-induced brain damage. These miRNAs include the let-7 family, miR-34c, miR-146a, miR-194, miR-203, and miR-369 (Lewohl et al., 2011). The target mRNA analysis of these miRNAs has revealed that their levels were downregulated in alcoholic brains. Thus, proving that their concentration plays important role in cell differentiation, cell signalling, cell cycle and brain development (Tapocik et al., 2013; Mayfield, 2017). Another in-vitro study on human neuroblastoma cells showed the exponential increase in levels of miR-302b (Yadav et al., 2011) and miR-497 (Nunez and Mayfield, 2012). Both these miRNA target Bcl2, upregulation of miR-497 is associated with the increased mitochondria-dependent neuronal apoptosis. Whereas upregulated expression on miR-302b was found to target cyclin D2 and initiates mitochondria-independent apoptosis in neurons that have been exposed to alcohol. Other than these two miRNAs, miR-34a (pro-apoptotic microRNA) were also found to be upregulated (Yadav et al., 2011). In another study on rodent models, miR-125b has been found to play an important role in the formation and sustainance of the neuronal crest in the time of alcohol toxicity (Tili et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2015). There are many surveys that have shown that the majority of youth does binge drinking. Recent studies on Indian youth (Prasad, 2009; Pillai et al., 2014) have revealed shocking statistics that 33 % of the youth have already been exposed to alcohol and are binge-drinkers. On the other hand, studies in the USA, 24.6 % youth of age 12–15 have been exposed to alcohol (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2019). Binge drinking is long been associated with many neurological as well as mental health conditions which include memory loss, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression and poor stress response (Mason-Jones and Cabieses, 2015; Popovici and French, 2013). A sbinge-drinking study conducted by Sanchez-Roige and Cantacorps’s group on rodent models of peripubertal age are in agreement with the above findings (Sanchez-Roige et al., 2014; Cantacorps et al., 2018). Further, their study also confirmed that the long-term memory loss and neuropsychiatric conditions in alcohol-exposed rodent group was also associated with damaged hippocampal and hampered neurogenesis. Levels of miR-10a-5p were found to be elevated with downregulation in the expression of miR-26a and miR-495 in the hippocampal region. Studies have shown that decreased levels of miR-26a and miR-495, in turn, increased the levels of their target mRNA, BNDF SIRT1 which provides the protection against alcohol toxicity in the brain (Neumann et al., 2015; Asimes et al., 2019). A decrease in the concentration of miRNA processing enzymes (Drosha & DICER) in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus has also been reported (Redell et al., 2009)."
6,Role of miRNA in neuroinflammation,"Inflammation is among the master regulator that plays important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the nervous system, which includes alcohol-induced neuronal damage (Crews et al., 2011; Orio et al., 2019). Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 is an important player in inducing immune functions in the CNS in response to alcohol which contributes to alcohol-induced induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and sequential activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases and oxidases (Lehnardt et al., 2003). The role of TLR is well known in the identification of pathogen and activation of an innate immune response that leads to adaptive responses during infection (Beutler, 2009). The role of innate immune response-related genes in alcohol-dependency is well supported by many genetic studies in humans (Barnes et al., 2014; Nagy, 2015), post mortem microarray analysis of alcoholic’s brains (Lewohl et al., 2000; Warden and Mayfield, 2017), and also transcriptome analysis in rodent brains (Noori et al., 2014). Many studies show the role of miRNAs in the development of the immune system and how miRNA regulates different immune functions (Podshivalova and Salomon, 2013; Baumjohann and Ansel, 2013). Numerous profiling studies have established the fact that TLR signalling alters miRNA expression which is generally dependent on NFκB (O’Neill et al., 2011), and the same effect is found in the miRNA profiling studies in the brain of human alcoholics (Nunez and Mayfield, 2012). About one-third of the over-expressed miRNAs (miR-15,34, 92, 140, 146, 152, 194, 196, 203 and let-7) in the prefrontal cortex of the alcoholic’s brain are the regulator of immunity and many from the group are involved in TLR signalling regulation. miR-146 family targets TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to fine-tune the cytokine signalling and prevents excessive inflammation (Taganov et al., 2006; Sonkoly et al., 2008). Other miRNAs which are found to be upregulated in the brain after alcohol ingestion are miR-132 and miR-155 (Kong et al., 2015; Soreq and Wolf, 2011). These miRNAs function through activation of TLR4 and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain after alcohol exposure. This increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is because of the upregulation of miR-155, which has been reported in a study where the miR-155 deficient mice brain showed no effect in the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines even after chronic alcohol exposure (Lippai et al., 2013). Thus, change in the concentration of the miRNA in the brain after alcohol consumption suggests their role in brain injury caused in alcoholic patients. On the other hand, let-7 family members have been reported to directly target expression of NFκB and interleukin 6 (IL6) and they also form an epigenetic switch together with them. This epigenetic switch connects inflammation with cell transformation (Iliopoulos et al., 2010). Over-expression of let-7 is mandatory for switching off the expression of TLRs in glia cells and inhibits excessive inflammation by the high responsiveness to LPS abuse. This regulatory loop contributes to alcohol tolerance and alcohol dependency in alcoholics. LPS induced activation of immune signalling is facilitated by CD14 which also promotes alcohol intake and alters some factors of alcohol reward and aversion in mice (Blednov et al., 2012). miR-203 has been known for regulating signalling of IL6 and IFNγ by targeting SOCS3, which is a suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (Chen et al., 2020). SOCS3 plays a role in the negative feedback loop in cytokine signalling that inhibits the transcription factor STAT3 activation of the JAK–STAT signalling and hence leads to an increased inflammatory response. miR-148/152 family has been reported to inhibit MHC-II expression as well as functional maturation of dendritic cells through TLR inhibition. Whereas miR-152 also targets CaMKIIα, thus inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12, IL6, TNFα, and IFNβ), and consequently, the innate response is negatively regulated (Lu et al., 2011). They are also over-expressed in the foetal brain if it has been exposed to alcohol during the time of gestation (Wang et al., 2009). In human white blood cells, the functioning of TLR signalling is also controlled by miR-9 by direct action on the NFKB1 gene (Bazzoni et al., 2009; Arenas-Padilla and Mata-Haro, 2018). miR-9 also regulates the alcohol sensitivity of BK channels by destabilizing splice variants, thereby decreasing the alcohol sensitivity of BK channels (Shipston and Tian, 2016; Martin et al., 2008). miR-369-3p is a miRNA that can directly work on mRNAs by allowing or inhibiting RNA-binding protein interaction with mRNA and is also reported to be upregulated in the brains of human alcoholics (Vasudevan et al., 2007). miRNA can directly act on the AU-rich elements by base pairing in TNFα. mRNA and TNFα translation occurs only in a non-growing state (Tao and Gao, 2015; Vasudevan et al., 2007). There are many miRNAs that are found to be activated however, their specific role in inducing the immune responses in the brain is not been identified yet. Such as miR-140 and miR-194 were found to be overexpressed after LPS exposure in mouse lung cells (Tsuchiya et al., 2013). miR-92 was found to be over-expressed in CD4+ and CD8+ double positive thymocytes, than in other phases of T-lymphocyte maturation. miR15b concentration was over-expressed in CD8+ cells as compared with CD4 + T cells or double positive thymocytes and miR-196 was found upregulated by antiviral cytokine INF-β (Sonkoly et al., 2008). All these identified miRNAs need more elaborative study to elucidate their mechanism of action in alcohol induced brain damage."
7,Role of miRNA in synaptic plasticity and signalling,"Alcohol and other addictive drugs make a lifelong transformation in the reward circuits of the brain and this transformation leads to reward cycle dysfunction, drug tolerance, more drug intake that leads to addiction or dependence (Kauer and Malenka, 2007; Wise and Koob, 2014). Dopaminergic neurons have been the centre of research for studying reward circuits in the midbrain region and their extensions in the limbic system (Nestler, 2014). Studies have revealed that many agonists and antagonist drugs affect the functioning of many neurotransmitters (dopamine, GABA, serotonin, glutamate, acetylcholine and few peptides). These drugs and alcohol are also involved in the induction of reward circuits and induce the formation of various types of neuronal plasticity which can alter the signals induced by the drug into long-term modifications in behaviour (Hassan et al., 2017; Hyman et al., 2006). At the molecular stage, these gene expression mechanisms synchronize the changes in synapse and dendrite at the structural and functional levels. (Sutton and Schuman, 2006; Schratt, 2009). MiRNAs play important roles in the regulation of these processes and the development of addictive behaviour in animals. Multiple miRNA family members are found upregulated in the brain of human alcoholics (let7, miR-1, 7, 92, 135, 146, 339, 376, and 380) or downregulated (miR-34, 101, 144, 153, 301, and 652) in rodent models (Lugli et al., 2008; Sartor et al., 2012; Kenny, 2014). miR-92 is shown to take part in the regulation of RNA-binding protein FXR1P which is found in dendrites and is associated with the biogenesis of miRNA (Ceman and Saugstad, 2011). miRNAs that are expressed inside the dendrites and dendritic spines, contribute to the modulation of protein synthesis (Park et al., 2019). The alcohol-induced increase in the expression of these miRNAs might play a major role in the development of addiction-promoting and long-term memories (Lugli et al., 2008). Both miR-7 and miR-153 have been involved in the α-synuclein regulation. They play a role in the activity-dependent maintenance of the SNARE complex in pre-synaptic terminals (Burré et al., 2010; Burgoyne and Morgan, 2011). These miRNAs are also involved in the transmission of dopaminergic neurons, neurodegeneration as well as in alcohol dependency in humans and rodents (Warden and Mayfield, 2017; Most et al., 2014b; Aho et al., 2009). miR-7 also controls neurite outgrowth in in-vitro models and also in neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines of humans (Chen et al., 2010; Jedari et al., 2020). miR-153 has a significant role in the teratogenic effects of alcohol in rodents which is a combined effect of downregulation of miR-21, miR-335, and miR-153. let-7 family members (let-7a, let-7c, and let-7 g) are initiators of translocation and sequestration of mRNA of μ opioid receptor into P-bodies, thus leading to translation repression of mRNA without changing its cellular levels, (He et al., 2010) while upregulation of let-7d downregulates the dopamine D3 receptor (Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2009). The μ-opioid receptor is thoroughly distributed in the reward circuit and mediates the activities of different drugs including alcohol (Ben Hamida et al., 2019). Another miRNA that is over-expressed in the human alcoholic’s brain is miR-15, which belongs to the groups of miRNAs that have binding sites at the 3 UTR of the β2AR mRNA (Wang et al., 2011). Many research studies have shown the role of β-adrenergic receptors in the recovery of cocaine-associated memories which is mediated by norepinephrine in rats (Otis et al., 2014). Another upregulated miRNA miR-101 in the pre-frontal cortex of the human alcoholic’s brain is associated with the regulation of GABAergic neuron transmission in response to alcohol intake by regulating Gβ1 protein as they start a relay of intracellular signalling events that leads to the internalization of GABA and other receptors (Saba et al., 2012; Lippi et al., 2016). Nicotine exposure upregulates miR-140, which directly binds to mRNA of dynamin (Dnm1) and inhibits its expression (Huang and Li, 2009). Dnm1 is involved in the division of clathrin-coated vesicles and is crucial for the recycling of endocytotic synaptic vesicles for rapid renewal of vesicles to maintain the synaptic vesicle pool (Fan et al., 2016; Milosevic, 2018). It also creates a strong physical collaboration with the conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) which plays an important role during alcohol neurotoxicity (Gorini et al., 2010). Other miRNAs that target Dnm1 members are miR-101, miR-135b, miR-140, miR-203, miR-34c-5p, miR-376, miR-454, miR-519b3p, miR-580, and miR-586 (Lewohl et al., 2011)."
8,Prenatal exposure of alcohol and early development of the brain,"When the concentration of alcohol exceeds the ability of the liver to metabolize it, it keeps circulating in the blood. Alcohol can cross blood-brain barrier as well as can easily cross the placental barrier (Keating et al., 2008). This leads to the exposure of an entire foetus to alcohol including its brain. Alcohol can bring changes in the foetal brain at the early developmental stages (Sathyan et al., 2007). During pregnancy consumption of alcohol can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders which includes various symptoms including neuronal loss, growth defects in the brain, damaged central nervous system, abnormalities in heart development, abnormal facial features, and impaired locomotor function etc. (Young et al., 2014; Kambeitz et al., 2019). The first study conducted on the alcohol-induced neurotoxicity in the foetal brain showed downregulation of miR-21, miR-335, miR-9, and miR-153 in the cerebral cortical neuroepithelial precursor cells. Other miRNAs that were found upregulated in embryonic neuronal cells are miR-140-3p (nicotine-induced miRNA), miR-302b and miR-99a, which are associated with the hampered neural stem cell maturation (Miranda, 2012; Mandal et al., 2018). In a rodent study, alcohol has also been found to be teratogenic, where several miRNAs were found to be responsible for the observed teratogenicity in a fetus like miR-9, 10a, 10b, 30a-3p, 145 and 152 (Miranda, 2012, 2014; Przybycien-Szymanska et al., 2011). All these miRNAs were reported to be upregulated and have different targets. miR-10a and 10b targets homeobox transcription factor expression (Hu and Liu, 2015; Nimmagadda et al., 2013). This can be avoided by providing folic acid supplements which checks the upregulation of miR-10a during alcohol exposure. The miR-10a is also associated with increase retinol and retinoic acid receptor levels, increased retinoic acid can also be responsible for the upregulation of miR-10a. This was confirmed by the increased concentration of trans-retinoic acid in the brain because of alcohol-induced increase in expression of retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes in the brain (Wang et al., 2014; Tehler et al., 2011). Soares’s (2012) study has revealed in-utero exposure of around 34 alcohol-responsive microRNAs where validation study identified miR-153, miR-183, miR-736 and miR-218 to be upregulated and miR-23a to be downregulated (Mandal et al., 2018; Kleiber et al., 2014). All these miRNA targets the genes involved in transcription of cell cycle control and apoptosis leading to alcohol-induced toxicity. The finding suggests that alcohol effects can be reversed by social enrichment, which also down-regulates the expression of miR-204, miR-299a, miR-384-5p, miR-222-3p (Ignacio et al., 2014). In a rodent study, focal cerebral ischemia associated with an alcoholism model showed an increase in miR-21, miR-126 and miR-155 which eventually leads to activation of caspase-9 and initiates apoptosis (Silva et al., 2019). Another microarray analysis of circulating miRNA in pregnant women exposed to alcohol revealed differential expression of 55 miRNA. The validation study showed upregulation of miR-509-5p, miR-4657 and miR-542-3p and downregulation of miR-602 which are also involved in the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways (Gardiner et al., 2016; Balaraman et al., 2012). Prenatal exposure of ethanol to developing fetuses showed the decreased expression of miR-335 and miR-9 in neural stem cells which were due to hypermethylation (Sathyan et al., 2009). In another rodent study, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in upregulation of miR-26b in the brain which further targeted the cannabinoid receptor 1 (Marcos et al., 2012; Stringer et al., 2013). The major role of cannabinoid receptor 1 is to protect the neurons from excitotoxicity through activation of BNDF. A decrease in cannabinoid receptor 1 in the brains of alcoholics is also confirmed by PET scans and regular scans which shows that this decrease is not reversible even after abstinence in alcoholics (Hirvonen et al., 2013; Ceccarini et al., 2014; Portero-Tresserra et al., 2018). Recent studies have found that long term alcohol consumption by fathers also affects the offsprings mental health. Alcohol consumption by the father has been shown to decrease the levels of cytosine methyltransferase transcript in sperm (Ricci et al., 2017; Anifandis et al., 2014). Another study has revealed that mammalian sperm-derived miR-34c plays a critical role in the first cell division of the zygote through Bcl-2 targeting. Here Bcl-2 negatively regulates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27 thus showing anti-proliferative function (Liu et al., 2012; Dickson et al., 2018)."
9,Circulating miRNA,"Extracellular vesicles are small spherical structures with lipid layers that are released by cells to convey signals to others cells. (Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015; Tkach and Théry, 2016). Extracellular vesicles (EV) play a major role during the transportation of different molecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, metabolites etc. from the parent cells to other cells (Chen et al., 2017). These vesicles can transport molecules throughout the body through blood. They are also produced during some pathological conditions (Pegtel and Gould, 2019; Kalluri, 2016). Recently its role in miRNA transportation is identified where they can transport miRNA across the blood-brain barrier into the circulatory system (Zhang et al., 2015). These circulating miRNAs have played major roles in diseases like multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders (Bala et al., 2012). They have recently been identified as a transmitter of neuro-inflammatory responses induced by ethanol and other chemicals (Gillet et al., 2016). Chronic alcohol exposure alters the expression on miR-183 family, miR-200a and miR-200b in the cerebral cortices of mice (Sánchez-Mora et al., 2013; Pascual et al., 2020). Alcohol activates astroglial cells and also increases the number and content of inflammation-inducing proteins and miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-182, miR-200b) in EVs of astroglial cells (Tseng et al., 2019). These EVs thus induces neuroinflammation that can lead to neuronal cell death. Similar human studies have also demonstrated that alcohol exposure leads to upregulation of mir-122 in hepatocytes (Momen-Heravi et al., 2015). The upregulation of the EVs miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-182, miR-200b) were found to be in more in females of both (human and mice) as compared to males (Ibáñez et al., 2020). The Discovery of the circulating miRNA has opened a new channel for understanding brain damage caused by alcohol."
10,Summary and conclusions,"It is well known that miRNA can negatively regulate the activity of genes and a single miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple genes. Understanding their role in alcohol-induced brain damage will enable us to understand the disease better. The present review comprises the list of all miRNAs involved in alcohol-induced brain damage (Table 1 ). All these alcohol sensitive miRNAs and their effect on neuronal development miRNA can be categorized on the basis of damage or mechanisms (inflammation, apoptosis etc) they impart. In addition to comprising a list of alcohol sensitive microRNA, we have also grouped them according to their role in different mechanisms (Fig. 3 ). MiR-15, miR-34, miR-92, miR-140, miR-146, miR-152, miR-194, miR-196, miR-203, let-7, miR-132, miR-155, miR-148, miR-9, miR-369, miR-21 and miR-126 are main regulators in alcohol-induced inflammatory response. The majority of these miRNAs are involved in TLR mediated inflammation. Alcohol is also known to induce synaptotoxicity through voltage- and calcium-gated BK channels in brain (excitotoxicity) and miRNAs that are involved are let-7, miR-1, miR-7, miR-92, miR-135, miR-146, miR-339, miR-376, miR-380, miR-34, miR-101, miR-144, miR-153, miR-301, miR-652, miR-21, miR-335, miR-15, miR-140, miR-203, miR-376, miR-454, miR-519b, miR-580, miR-586, miR-4657, miR-509, miR-542 and miR-602. Many miRNAs have been founded in circulating EVs, specifically in response to alcohol insult. miR-183, miR-200, miR-146a, miR-182 and miR-122 plays an important role in spreading the damage to multiple organs. There is another group of alcohol sensitive miRNA that decides the fate of the cell, any change in the miRNA levels either induces or blocks apoptosis in neuronal cells. Among these miRNA miR-29 and miR-34 are pro-apoptotic miRNA while miR-497 and 302b are anti-apoptotic miRNAs. There are few miRNAs which affects other intermediates of apoptotic pathway i.e., miR-26a and miR-495. Other than these miRNA, there are alcohol sensitive microRNAs that can cross the placental barrier and affects the brain development of the developing fetus. The miRNAs that were found in the neuronal stem cells of the fetus are miR-21, miR-335, miR-9, miR-153, miR-302b, miR-99a, miR-10, miR-30a, miR-145, miR-152, miR-183, miR-736, miR-218, miR-23a, miR-204, miR-299a, miR-384, miR-227, miR-26b and miR-34c. MiR-34c is also been found responsible for the first zygotic division. All the miRNA research concerning to alcohol is making a new way for better understanding the role of alcohol-induced brain damage. With all the data available in the literature it can be summarized that alcohol has the potential to regulate many cellular processes by affecting the expression of different miRNAs. This might increase our understanding of neuronal dependence, conditioning and toxicity of alcohol. Other miRNAs that are found to be associated with alcohol exposure in organ system other than the brain are miR-34a, miR-21, miR-137, miR-409-5p, miR-509–3p, miR-882, miR-33 and miR-155 (in the liver) (McDaniel et al., 2014), miR-21, miR-199-3p, miR-211, miR-148a and miR-802 (pancreas) (Charrier et al., 2014), miR-138, miR-485-5p, miR-506, miR-512-5p, miR-548-3p, miR-4262 and miR-30a (heart) (Wang et al., 2016; Jing et al., 2015). Till now several reports have been published on miRNA profiling of alcohol-sensitive miRNAs showing the effect of alcohol according to species, gender, target organ, duration, dose etc (Torres et al., 2018; Osterndorff-Kahanek et al., 2018; Szabo and Satishchandran, 2015). All the gathered knowledge will help the researchers to exploit these miRNAs as a potential target for drugs and other therapeutic agents to reverse or block the hazardous effects of alcohol. miRNAs are the most well-studied group of non-coding RNAs and are well-known regulators of gene expression by mRNA degradation, but their mode of action is more complex than we previously thought. It includes transcription activation, modulation in protein expression, interaction with RNA binding protein etc. With their involvement in all aspects of the development and sustenance of different organ systemssystem, they are the potential biomarkers of many diseases as well as a new target for therapeutics. Few studies confirmthat miRNAs are not blocked by BBB (Blood Brain Barrier) and have a free passage from cerebrospinal fluid to blood thus making them a potential biomarker for nervous system disorders (Stoicea et al., 2016; Dalkara and Alarcon-Martinez, 2015). EVs functions as a carrier of circulating miRNA and can be explored in targeted delivery by exosome-based miRNA for neurological injuries and disorders. Identified marker miRNA provides researchers with a way for early prevention or interventions that can delay/stop the alcohol-induced neurodevelopmental disordersdisorder through miRNA targeting (Fig. 4 ). miRNA therapy involves the use of miRNA mimics/Antagomirs for the regulation of miRNA concentration in the brain. For the restoration of down-regulated miRNA, miRNA mimics are used and for inhibition of upregulated miRNA antagomirs are used. Marker miRNA of alcohol-induced brain toxicity can be targeted for their up-/down-regulation leading to the prevention of neurodevelopmental disorder. Thus identification of the marker miRNA will not only help us to understand the disease better but will also function as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders."
