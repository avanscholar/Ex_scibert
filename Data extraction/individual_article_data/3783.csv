0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as clean energy for the future. Currently, the primary process for hydrogen production is steam-methane reforming (SMR) followed by shift reaction and purification process. Synthesis gas is formed by an endothermic steam-methane reforming reaction with a Ni catalyst at a high temperature (∼850 °C). Then, two stages of the shift reaction at low temperatures (∼250–450 °C) are typically used to increase the hydrogen yield. The shift reaction is then followed by a CO2 removal process that requires the additional energy consumption. Sorption enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP) accomplishes the above processes in a single processing step with the thermodynamic equilibrium shifting [1–9]. Reforming reaction: (1) CH 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ CO ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ / mol Shift reaction: (2) CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol Overall (SEHP process with use of CaO as a CO2 absorbent): (3) CH 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) + CaO ( s ) ↔ CaCO 3 ( s ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = − 13 kJ / mol Theoretically, little supplemental energy is required for hydrogen production using SEHP because the reaction heat produced by carbonation of CaO can be used in steam methane reforming reaction. Instead, the SEHP requires energy for the regeneration of the used CaO for multi-cycle operation as per the following equation [10–17]. (4) CaCO 3 ( s ) ↔ CaO ( s ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 178 kJ / mol Even after accounting for the energy used for absorbent regeneration, the supplemental energy required for SEHP is still 20% less than that of the conventional SMR processes [1–3]. For successful development of the SEHP process, the development of proper CO2 absorbent is critical. In many studies CaO has been used as CO2 absorbent because of its large stoichiometric CO2 capacity [1–6]. However, it is well known that the CO2 capacity of pure CaO decreases by 80% after 10 to 20 cycles and this loss is attributed to the sintering and agglomeration of the CaO particles as the carbonation–calcination cycle number increases with shifting rate determining step from chemical reaction to diffusion [5,6,10,12]. Therefore, it must have a substantial lifetime to avoid frequent shut-down for recharging CO2 absorbent. So far, various attempts have been made to prevent the sintering and agglomeration of CaO. Bandi [5] claimed that an increased concentration of inert material in the CO2 absorbent would improve the cyclic stability by preventing agglomeration since the inert portion behaves as a skeleton to maintain its microstructure over multiple carbonation–calcination cycles. Silaban [14] reported that dolomite is superior to limestone in stability over the CO2 carbonation/calcination cycles. They claimed that MgO behaved as skeleton preventing severe agglomeration because MgO does not react with CO2 at carbonation temperature over 623 K. In our recent research [6], uniform dispersion of MgO in CaO was achieved using combined method of precipitation and hydration and the excellent stability over multi-cycle carbonation/calcination test was observed. Other researchers tried to impart improved CO2 absorption characteristics by pretreating limestone [8,15,16] Yi et al. proved that oxygen-vacancy possessing materials such as CexZr1-xO2 and LaAlxMg1-xO3can be excellent additives to enhance the cyclic stability of CaO by facilitating the transportation of CO3 2− [17]. Wu et al. prepared the CaO for CO2 sorbent using Ca(OH)2 as a precursor and achieved the enhanced CO2 sorption capacity and claimed that the steam releasing decomposition of Ca(OH)2 to CaO increased surface area resulting in the high CO2 capacity [18]. Recent researches suggest that the incorporation of Ca12Al14O33 into CaO improves the cyclic stability by providing a robust and well-dispersed skeleton that prevents agglomeration [19,20]. Concerning the Ca12Al14O33, Hosono et al. [21] reported that the crystals of Ca12Al14O33 possess inversed zeolitic nature with anion accommodation property. It might be a reasonable guess that Ca12Al14O33behave as oxygen-vacancy possessing material in CO2 absorption process helping transportation of CO3 2−. The other problem we concern in SEHP is synchronizing lifetime of CO2 absorbent with that of Ni catalyst. In case of physical mixing of CO2 absorbent and Ni catalyst, if the lifetimes of both materials are not matched, either CO2 absorbent or Ni catalyst needs to be recharged separately. Furthermore, if a fluidized bed reactor is used for SEHP it is almost impossible to remove CO2 absorbent or Ni catalyst separately because the weight and size distribution of both materials will be fairly similar. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a material possessing both catalytic activity and CO2 absorption ability with guaranteed cyclic stability. In this study, CaO–Ca12Al14O33 based CO2 absorbent were prepared and analyzed in terms of spectroscopy and cyclic stability in multi-cycle carbonation/calcination tests. In addition, CaO–Ca12Al14O33–Ni catalytic absorbents were prepared and their performances in SEHP were investigated."
1,Material and methods,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation As in our previous works [18], precipitation method using nitrate type precursors was adopted to prepare CaO alone absorbent, CaO–Ca12Al14O33 absorbent, and CaO–Ca12Al14O33–Ni catalytic absorbent. The preparation procedure is as follows. First, the designated amounts of calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2∙4H2O, reagent grade, Aldrich) and aluminum nitrate enneahydrate (Al(NO3)3∙9H2O, reagent grade, Aldrich) were dissolved, either separately or together, in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 130 mL) and distilled water (760 mL). The prepared solution was stirred for 1 h at 348 K and then evaporated at 393 K in a drying oven overnight. The powder was collected from the oven and calcined at 773 K for 3 h in air. Then, the prepared powder was hydrated in a mixture of IPA (65 mL) and distilled water (380 mL) and the resultant slurry was stirred for 3 h at 348 K. Then, the solution was evaporated at 393 K overnight and the residue was calcined at 1173 K for 1.5 h. The collected powder was crushed and sieved to designated particle size range (diameter: 150–300 μm). The samples were named according to their composition: CA for CaO alone, CA–AL for the sample with 75 wt% CaO and 25 wt% Ca12Al14O33, and CA–AL–Ni for CaO–Ca12Al14O33–Ni composite. Also, for the CaO–Ca12Al14O33–Ni composites their Ni weight percentage is appended with ‘-weight percentage’. For instance, CA–AL–Ni-7 indicates CaO–Ca12Al14O33–Ni composite containing 7 wt% of Ni."
3,Absorbent characterization,"2.2 Absorbent characterization The surface areas of the absorbents were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 76 K on a Micrometrics' ASAP 2010 analyzer. The resolution was 0.133 Pa for the system. Each absorbent was degassed at 423 K and <1.33 mPa for 16 h before measurement. The morphologies of the prepared absorbents were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL30, 15 kV). A cross-sectional image and elemental distributions of CaO–Ca12Al14O33 absorbent were obtained by focused ion beam-transmission electron microscopy (FIB-TEM). Firstly, a very thin specimen (less than 2 μm) of CaO–Ca12Al14O33 absorbent were obtained by FIB (FB-2100, Hitachi). Secondly, morphology and the distribution of elements (Ca or Al) in prepared sample were observed by TEM (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, FEI). FIB and TEM were installed at National Nanofab Center in Daejeon, Korea."
4,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.3 Thermogravimetric analysis 80–110 mg of sample was placed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instrument, Q50) for the carbonation/calcination cyclic tests. Helium gas flows through the built-in mass flow controller (MFC) to either the balance chamber only or both the balance chamber and the furnace. CO2 gas flows through the designated MFC to the furnace. The volumetric ratio of the flow to the balance chamber to the flow to the furnace is 0.1. Therefore, the sample was exposed to 90 vol% CO2 with He balance during the carbonation step and to 100% He during the calcination step. The total flow rate of the gas mixture is maintained at 100 sccm at all times. The temperature in the furnace was maintained at 973 K for both the carbonation and calcination steps. The desorption rate of CO2 is dependent on the CO2 partial pressure and temperature: the desorption rate is usually higher at higher temperatures. As in our previous study, the calcination temperature was set equal to the carbonation temperature to remove the effect of temperature swing on the cyclic stability."
5,SEHP (sorption enhanced hydrogen production) test,"2.4 SEHP (sorption enhanced hydrogen production) test SEHP tests were carried out in a fixed bed reactor system. In sorption enhanced reforming step, CH4 flows through MFC at 70 ml/min and mixed with water vapor of 210 ml/min in a preheater of which temperature is maintained at 473 K. Water is supplied by a high pressure water pump into preheater for evaporation. Then, the gas mixture flows into the stainless steel reactor (Diameter: 12 mm). The reactor is wrapped with a vertical type furnace and its temperature is maintained at 903 K. The prepared CO2 absorbent and Ni catalyst mixture or the catalytic absorbent is charged in the middle of the reactor. In the case of physical mixture, CO2 absorbent (CA–AL) was 9 g and Ni catalyst (a commercial one, ICI 57-4) was 3 g. In case of catalytic absorbent (CA–AL–Ni), the sample loading was set as 12 g. After the gas mixture pass through the sample bed, the water is trapped in a water trap submerged in chilling fluid and the rest of gas products are analyzed in a micro gas chromatography (Agilent micro 3000) that is equipped with double column and 2 thermal conductivity detectors. In the regeneration step, the reactor temperature is raised to 1053 K and only N2 gas flows through the reactor until no other gas component is detected."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Sample characterization,"3.1 Sample characterization BET surface areas of the CA–AL with different preparation methods are shown in Table 1 . In CA–AL preparation, Ca12Al14O33 is formed in the final calcinations step at 1173 K. The authors investigated whether the precursor addition order affected the surface area of the CA–AL. When the aluminum precursor was added in precipitation step (CA–AL#1), the surface area of the sample is higher than that obtained by aluminum addition in hydration step (CA–AL#2). The addition of aluminum precursor in precipitation step certainly increased the surface area. In other word, the change of the surface area might be related with aluminum distribution in the CaO particles. Once the CaO particles formed, aluminum might not penetrate effectively into CaO particles. The other attempt was ethylene glycol (EG) addition in the precipitation step (CA–AL#3). The authors assumed that the EG might behave as pore generation agent by the decomposition at high temperatures in the final calcination step. Indeed, the EG addition doubled the surface area of CA–AL."
8,Cyclic stability of CA–AL in carbonation/calcination cycles,"3.2 Cyclic stability of CA–AL in carbonation/calcination cycles Cyclic stabilities of the CA and the CA–AL sorbent were compared in TGA system and its results are shown in Fig. 1 . As reported in the previous works [6,17], the CO2 capacity of CA drops drastically as cycle number increases. Initially, CO2 capacity of CA was around 65 wt%, but it dropped to 35 wt% after 40 cycles and it was expected to decrease further more. The high initial CO2 capacity is believed to be endowed by the preparation method using combination of precipitation and hydration. However, it is thought that the agglomeration and sintering progressed rapidly as the cycle number increased. On the other hand, the CO2 capacity of the CA–AL gradually increased to 40 wt% in the early stage of multi-cycle test and it was kept remained almost identical even after 100 cycles. It strongly suggests that Ca12Al14O33 behaves as the robust skeleton to maintain the microstructure of the CA–AL. The authors also believed the anion accommodation ability of Ca12Al14O33 contribute to the high cyclic stability of the CA–AL as in similar mechanism that the oxygen vacancy possessing materials transmit CO 3 2 − which is reported in our previous study [17]. To investigate the stability of the CO2 absorption capacity of the CA-AL more precisely, the inside morphology of the CA–AL particles was examined by FIB-TEM. Fig. 2 depicted the inner particle morphology of the CA–AL absorbent by TEM after the selective ion milling by FIB and distribution of elements (Ca and Al). Although the thick outer-shell formed, the porous structure was also developed inside of the CA–AL particles. Calcium was distributed evenly in entire particles. However, aluminum appeared in the specific area. Addition of aluminum seems to be closely related with the formation of porous structure in CA–AL. The porous portion shown in Fig. 2 mainly consists of Ca12Al14O33 and this potion does not react with CO2. Instead, it might behave as a pathway for fast diffusion to deliver CO2 to the CaO portion. Also, the sparsely scattered Ca12Al14O33 in the CaO is believed to accept CO 3 2 − ion with its anion accommodation property and pass those CO 3 2 − to adjacent CaO for the carbonation by exchanging O2− with the CaO. Therefore, the Ca12Al14O33 acts as both a skeleton to maintain microstructure of the CA–Al with providing the spacious CO2 pathway and an anion transmitting vein that enhances the CaO utilization."
9,SEHP test with physical mixture of CA–AL and Ni catalyst,"3.3 SEHP test with physical mixture of CA–AL and Ni catalyst Prior to SEHP test with the prepared catalytic absorbents that contains CO2 absorbent and Ni, the SEHP test with physical mixture of the CA–AL and a commercial Ni catalyst (ICI 57-4) was carried out as a reference. The test result is shown in Fig. 3 . As described in the experimental section, 9 g of CA–AL and 3 g of Ni catalyst were well mixed and charged into the reactor. Reforming and regeneration were repeated 4 times. H2 concentrations reached to around 95%, during the sorption enhanced period. H2 concentration fluctuated badly in early stage, therefore, the duration of sorption enhanced period lasted to 45 min for all 4 cycles. CO2 and CO concentrations were relatively stable when they are compared to those of methane. It indicates that the CO2 absorbent works appropriately but the Ni catalyst is not enough to cover the gas flow rate or does not work properly. Considering that the conventional Ni loading in the commercial reforming catalyst is around15wt% and weight ratio for CO2 absorbent to the Ni-based reforming catalyst was 3, the Ni content in the CO2 absorbent and the Ni catalyst mixture would be diluted to around 3.75 wt%. Therefore, it is likely that the fluctuation of the product gas composition is attributed to the short of catalytic activity. However, the increase of the Ni catalyst amount for hydrogen production by reforming results in the decrease of the specific CO2 capacity of the physical mixture between the CO2 absorbent and the reforming catalyst, which would diminish the benefit of sorption enhanced concept because the relative duration for sorption enhanced period would be shortened. In addition, one should consider that the Ni catalyst is also exposed to the CO2 absorbent regenerating step that make the lifetime of the Ni catalyst even shorter."
10,SEHP with one body catalytic absorbent composite,"3.4 SEHP with one body catalytic absorbent composite One-body catalytic absorbents composite (CA–AL–Ni) were prepared with 4 different Ni loadings; 3 wt%, 5 wt%, 7 wt% and 10 wt%. According to the XRD pattern (not shown) of the CA–AL–Ni-7, the metallic nickel particles and the Ca12Al14O33 were formed with fairly good dispersion judging from the intensity and full width half maximum (FWHM) of assigned peaks. XRD patterns for the CA–AL–Ni-3 and the CA–AL–Ni-5 show similarities to that of the CA–AL–Ni-7 with slightly lower peak intensities and FWHM for the metallic nickel particles. Fig. 4 displays SEM images of the CA–AL–Ni-7 and the CA–AL–Ni-10. The image of the CA–AL–Ni-7 showed well developed microstructure with uniform color density. However, the CA–AL–Ni-10 shows grape-like spheres with bright color all over the selected area. The bright parts were identified as Ni-rich area by EDX analysis. This indicates that when 10 wt% of Ni is loaded a self-agglomeration of Ni occurs. Although agglomerated nickel particles might contribute stable hydrogen production by reforming, such an agglomeration decreases the utilization efficiency of nickel particles as active sites for catalytic reforming. Fig. 5 also displays the concentration change of H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 depending on the reaction time. The enhanced hydrogen concentration (∼95%) beyond equilibrium (∼75%) by simultaneous CO2 absorption and reforming maintained for all 4 cycles. The fluctuation of the H2 concentrations in this test by one-body composite was similar to that by the physical mixture of the CO2 absorbent and the commercial reforming catalyst. And the sorption enhanced period lasted 60 min that is 30% longer compared to that of the physical mixture. Also, the CO2 and CO concentrations are relatively stable as shown in Fig. 5. Especially the CO2 concentrations were more stable than other gases while the CH4 concentrations fluctuate unstably through 4 cycles. In summary, these test results indicate that produced CO2 is effectively absorbed by the CaO portion of the catalytic absorbent according to the equilibrium criteria whereas the CH4 conversion by the catalyst portion is not active as much as it should be. The SEHP test result of the CA–AL–Ni-5 (not shown) is very similar to that of the CA–AL–Ni-3 with the improved stability of CO concentration. In other word, the nickel's catalytic activity is slightly improved but is still not enough to cover the CH4 conversion. On the other hand, SEHP test result with CA–AL–Ni-7 showed excellent performance as shown in Fig. 6 . The H2 concentrations were also very stable and maintained 94–95% during the sorption enhanced period that lasted around 70 min. In addition, during the breakthrough period (70–80 min) the H2 concentration dropped sharply to the H2 concentration level in steam methane reforming (SMR). Also, the CH4 concentrations were relatively stable over the whole experimental period. The CO and CO2 concentrations also showed very stable levels in accordance with the H2 concentrations. This indicates that the optimum nickel loading in one-body catalytic absorbent composite was around 7wt%."
11,Conclusion,"The combination of precipitation and hydration method turned out to be an excellent method to prepare CaO based CO2 absorbent providing high utilization of CaO. Adding aluminum precursor in the first precipitation step induced the formation of the Ca12Al14O33 that endows excellent cyclic stability to the CO2 absorbent by providing agglomeration resisting skeleton. Also, it is found in FIB-TEM analysis that the Ca12Al14O33 provides spacious pathway for the CO2 diffusion by forming porous structures in absorbent. The authors believe that the sparsely scattered Ca12Al14O33 may also take a role as jumping site for the carbonate ion because of its anion accommodation property. Ni precursor addition was carried out in the precipitation step to prepare catalytic absorbent with adjusting Ni contents. The prepared catalytic absorbent was used for SEHP test and their SEHP performances were compared with that of physical mixture of CaO–Ca12Al14O33 and a commercial reforming catalyst. The test results showed that when 7wt% of Ni is loaded the catalytic absorbent produced better performance than the physical mixture. It was also found that when 10 wt% of nickel is loaded on the catalytic absorbent Ni agglomeration occurs. Therefore, it is suggested that one body composite, consisting of CaO, Ca12Al14O33, and Ni, that is prepared by combination of precipitation and hydration can be a good candidate for catalytic absorbent for SEHP through this study."
