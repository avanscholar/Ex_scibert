0,Introduction,"Sunlight is a clean, renewable and abundant energy source and its conversion to hydrogen has been considered an ideal solution to counter the depletion and environmental problems of fossil fuels. Among hydrogen containing sources, H2S gas is an attractive source because it is more easily converted to hydrogen (relative to water, for example) with a lower energy input, and it is a harmful toxic gas that should be removed anyway [1,2]. Yet, there is still need to develop highly active photocatalysts working under visible light in order to put this technology into practical applications [3–5]. The AgGaS2 is a p-type material of I–III–VI ternary semiconductors, which crystallize in the chalcopyrite structure [6,7]. This material has a direct bandgap of about 2.68eV and is a promising material for solar cells, non-linear optical devices and blue light emitting diodes (LED) [8–10]. While AgGaS2 can be made as a low-resistivity p-type semiconductor, n-type conductivity appears difficult or impossible to achieve. Thus one can fabricate p–n heterojunctions or heterodiodes employing a compatible n-type semiconductor as ZnS or CdS for LED applications [11–14]. CdS is well known to exhibit a high photocatalytic activity in the presence of sacrificial reagents and it can be made as n-type (but not p-type) [15,16]. The fundamental direct band gap energy of wurtzite CdS is 2.42eV at 300K, close to that of AgGaS2 (2.68eV). Consequently, comparable injection ratios are likely for electrons and holes. It has been demonstrated in photovoltaic cells that diode structures made of n- and p-type semiconductors show greatly enhanced activities compared to devices consisting of a single semiconductor [17]. In photocatalytic systems, p–n heterojunction or heterodiode is also an interesting structure because the formation of p–n composite photocatalyst could lead to an efficient electron-hole separation that minimizes the energy wasteful electron-hole recombination. Recently, we demonstrated a photocatalytic nanodiode (PCD) system of p-CaFe2O4/n-PbBi2Nb1.9W0.1O9 that exhibited a very high activity for hydrogen production [18]. Previously, Nojik constructed an n-TiO2/p-GaP diode electrode for a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell that was much more active than either n-TiO2 or p-GaP single-component electrodes for the decomposition of water [19]. In the present work, we have chosen CdS as the n-type semiconductor and AgGaS2 as the p-type semiconductor to form an exploratory photocatalytic diode. This sulfide-type diode was investigated for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm) from water containing sulfide and sulfite as hole scavengers."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of CdS and AgGaS2 photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of CdS and AgGaS2 photocatalysts The nanosized CdS photocatalyst was prepared by a precipitation method followed by hydrothermal treatment. A stoichiometric amount of Na2S aqueous solution was added drop-by-drop to Cd(NO3)2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Precipitated suspension was hydrothermally treated in autoclave at 393K for 3days. After the completion of the reaction, the precipitates were filtered and washed several times with deionized water. Filtered powders were dried at 343K for 5h in a convection oven. AgGaS2 (AGS) was prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction. Thus, a stoichiometric mixture of Ag2S (Aldrich 99.9%) and Ga2S3 (10% excess, Aldrich 99.99%) were mixed and ground in a mortar in the presence of ethanol and dried in an oven. Pelletized powders were calcined at 1073K for 5h under N2 flow. The obtained powders were ground in a mortar in the presence of ethanol. The obtained powders were heat-treated at 873–1123K for 3h under He (21μmols−1) and H2S (14μmols−1) gas flow to remove defects and increase the crystallinity of AgGaS2."
3,Fabrication of CdS/AgGaS2 photocatalytic diode (PCD),"2.2 Fabrication of CdS/AgGaS2 photocatalytic diode (PCD) To fabricate CdS/AgGaS2 photocatalytic heterodiode, bulky AgGaS2 was stirred in isopropyl alcohol. Then, a stoichiometric amount of Na2S aqueous solution was added drop-by-drop while stirring to a solution containing AgGaS2 powder and Cd(NO3)2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (15wt.% of CdS in CdS/AgGaS2). The prepared composite powder was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 393–423K for 1 day. After completion of the reaction, the precipitates were filtered and washed several times with deionized water. Filtered powders were dried at 343K for 5h in a convection oven."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline phases of the products were determined by X-ray diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical properties were analyzed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). The morphology of photocatalysts were investigated by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4200) and a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, Field Emission Electron Microscope) instrument operated at 200kV. The bulk composition of the catalysts was determined by an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, EDAX Inc., Classic 10L Dewar). Data collection for Reitveld analysis was performed at HRPD Beamline of Pohang light source (PLS) located in Pohang, Korea, and the used software for cell refinement was FULLPROF2K [25]."
5,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction The photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen production was carried out at room temperature under normal pressure in a closed circulation system using a Hg-arc lamp (450W) equipped with UV cut off filter (λ ≥420nm) placed in an inner irradiation-type pyrex reaction cell. The H2 evolution was determined in an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3 as hole scavengers. The evolved amounts of H2 were determined by gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier). The 1.0wt.% of Pt metal was loaded as a co-catalyst onto the semiconductor photocatalysts by the photodeposition method."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Single-component p-type AgGaS2 (AGS) photocatalyst,"3.1 Single-component p-type AgGaS2 (AGS) photocatalyst Bulky AgGaS2 was prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction and calcined at 1073K under N2 flow for 5h. In XRD, most reflections were indexed to the tetragonal phase AgGaS2. The cell constants of this material is known as a =5.765 and c =10.281Å in the literature [20]. But, there exist extra peaks due to impurity phases. To remove vacancies or interstitial defects and to improve the crystallinity, AgGaS2 was heat-treated at various temperatures under H2S (40vol.%) gas flow diluted with He. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the samples heat-treated at various temperatures under H2S gas flow. The AGS sample calcined at 1073K for 5h under N2 is a starting material and has a tetragonal structure with the space group of I42d as the main structure and impurity components such as Ga2O3 and Ag9GaS6. Two impurity components were identified by a fit of full-profile structure refinement. When heat-treatment temperature was raised over 1073K, crystal structure was completely transformed into the tetragonal structure without any impurity component. Thus, the heat-treatment temperature for the preparation of bulk AgGaS2 photocatalyst as p-type material was chosen to be 1123K. Full-profile structure refinement of the measured powder diffraction data was performed with FULLPROF2K [25]. The observed powder XRD data, represented by black solid line at the top of Fig. 2 , corresponded to the tetragonal phase. The result of refinement, as shown in Table 1 , shows that the lattice parameters of AgGaS2 are in agreement with that of AgGaS2 previously reported [21]. Fig. 3 shows the UV-diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra for these samples treated at different temperatures under H2S flow. The positions of absorption edge were not much different among the samples. The untreated material (a) showed a diffuse absorption region (500–700nm) due to vacancies or interstitial defects in the chalcopyrite lattice, which caused these compounds to have a poor crystal quality and a poor optical property. But, when this material was heat-treated at high temperatures under H2S gas flow, the resulting AgGaS2 photocatalyst showed a good absorbance and crystallinity without impurity components. The morphology of bulky AgGaS2 particles heat-treated at various temperatures under H2S gas flow was observed by SEM as shown in Fig. 4 . Their morphologies were irregular bulk particles with a particle size of ca. 2–3μm. In the samples treated at low temperatures, we can observe bulky AgGaS2 particles surrounded by the broken powders having sharp edges. But, there were almost no broken particles in bulky AgGaS2 particles heat-treated at high temperatures with H2S gas. Elemental analyses of AgGaS2 before and after heat-treatment at 1123K for 3h under H2S gas flow were made from EDAX data, as shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). This indicates that after heat-treatment most of oxygen was removed and the composition of this material stayed near stoichiometry. But, the treatment did not remove completely the oxygen on the surface of AgGaS2. Despite the considerable amount of oxygen on the surface of AgGaS2, XRD pattern of AgGaS2 heat-treated at 1123K showed a clean pattern and a high crystallinity. Shown in Fig. 6 are the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production from an aqueous electrolyte solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (using a cut-off filter of λ ≥420nm for all catalysts). The rates of hydrogen evolution over AgGaS2 heat-treated at higher temperatures (1073 and 1123K) were higher than those of photocatalysts untreated and treated at lower temperatures (873 and 973K). This result can be correlated with XRD patterns and UV-vis DRS. Compared to AGS heated-treated at low temperatures under H2S gas flow, AgGaS2 heated-treated at high temperatures showed a high crystallinity without any impurity structure and improved absorbance with a sharp edge. From these results, it can be concluded that the impurity level and crystallinity of AgGaS2 are important for the photocatalytic activity."
8,CdS/AgGaS2 photocatalytic diode (PCD),"3.2 CdS/AgGaS2 photocatalytic diode (PCD) To construct the photocatalytic diode, we need a pair of n- and p-type semiconductors. We have chosen CdS as the n-type semiconductor and AgGaS2 as the p-type semiconductor. The fabrication method of this diode structure is also critical for the photocatalytic activity. In our previous work [22], we have demonstrated that a nano-bulk composite structure is particularly useful, in which nanoparticles of a semiconductor interface with highly crystalline bulky particles of the other semiconductor. Considering the sensitive effect of the crystallinity of AgGaS2 on its photocatalytic activity, we chose to fabricate a photocatalytic diode of bulky AgGaS2 decorated by nanoparticles of CdS by a hydrothermal method as described in Section 2. Fig. 7 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) CdS treated hydrothermally at 393K for 1 day, (b) AGS treated under H2S flow at 1123K for 3h, (c) CdS/AGS composite treated hydrothermally at 393K for 1 day, and (d) CdS/AGS composite treated hydrothermally at 423K for 1 day. The crystallinity of CdS in CdS/AGS photocatalytic diode (PCD) was as low as the single component CdS nanoparticle as seen from the intensity of XRD peaks and considering its concentration (15wt.%) in the composite. To improve the crystallinity of CdS in PCD, we increased the temperature of hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 7d). In spite of the higher temperature of hydrothermal treatment, the crystallinity of CdS in CdS/AGS photocatalytic diode (PCD) was not clearly revealed and its main peak remained hidden under the peak of AgGaS2 and showed only very small intensity. Hence, there was no distinct difference in XRD patterns of three samples containing AgGaS2. Some extra peaks are observed around 21.8, 33.9 and 37.3° in Fig. 7c and d, which could be assigned to β-CdSO4 (JCPDS 16-0253). This impurity phase seems to originate from superficial oxidation of CdS. The pure CdS showed a mixture of cubic and hexagonal phases and the AgGaS2 phase was a well-developed tetragonal structure both in single and PCD photocatalysts. Thus, each component of PCD maintained its structural identity during the formation of PCD composite. The diffuse reflection spectra for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . The AGS photocatalyst showed a sharp edge at 490nm, while that of CdS was observed at 570nm. The spectrum of the CdS/AGS composite photocatalyst showed a combination of these two spectra, although CdS in PCD photocatalysts showed a small blue-shift of the main absorbance edge. Although the increased temperature did not lead to any apparent change due to the small peak intensities of CdS in XRD patterns of CdS/AGS composite photocatalysts, CdS in composite photocatalyst hydrothermally treated at higher temperatures showed a small red-shift and sharpness of UV-DR spectra probably due to the enhanced contribution from CdS as shown in Fig. 8d. This is in agreement with the previous report by our group and Kisch et al. that the band gap of CdS employed in composite photocatalyst is shifted by an electronic semiconductor-support interaction (SEMSI) [22–24]. It was confirmed that CdS/AGS photocatalytic diode showed a UV-DR spectrum similar to that of a physically mixed CdS/AGS sample. Fig. 9 shows electron microscope images of (a) CdS nanoparticles, (b) bulky AgGaS2 heat-treated at 1123K for 3h under H2S gas flow, (c) CdS/AGS diode structure treated hydrothermally at 393K, and (d) at 423K for 1 day. It is evident that CdS nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 20nm are well attached and dispersed on the surface of micrometer-size AgGaS2. From this TEM image, it was confirmed that fabrication of nano-bulk composite structure was successfully accomplished with the hydrothermal treatment method. The morphology change of CdS with different temperatures of hydrothermal treatment was observed by TEM analysis. CdS in untreated CdS/AGS composite did not show a clear shape of particles (not shown). But, as the temperature of hydrothermal treatment increased, CdS clearly showed nanosized particles of 20–30nm (Fig. 9c and d) as nano-islands attached and dispersed on the surface of p-type semiconductor (AgGaS2). To investigate where the Pt cocatalyst is loaded, we analyzed EDAX and TEM images. From EDAX (Fig. 10a) data and TEM images (Fig. 10b and c), we confirmed that 1wt.% Pt-loaded CdS/AGS PCD consisted of Pt, CdS, and AgGaS2, and that Pt cocatalysts were randomly loaded both on CdS and AGS particles of the CdS/AGS composite. Shown in Fig. 11 are the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous electrolyte solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (using a cut-off filter of λ ≥420nm for all catalysts). The rate of hydrogen production over photocatalytic diode (PCD) of CdS/AgGaS2 was higher than the sum of single-component AgGaS2 and CdS photocatalysts having similar crystallinity. The p-type material AgGaS2 shows a H2 evolution rate of 296μmolh−1. The p–n diode photocatalyst CdS/AGS shows a higher activity with the rate of 432μmolH2 h−1. Note that nanosized CdS photocatalyst produces only small amount of H2 (13μmolh−1). When CdS/AGS photocatalyst was hydrothermally treated at a higher temperature of 423K, the rate of hydrogen production increased to 473μmolh−1. It means that the fabrication condition of CdS/AGS photocatalytic diode is important for hydrogen production although they did not show significant difference in XRD patterns and UV diffuse reflectance spectra of CdS/AGS samples. The rates observed for AgGaS2 and CdS/AGS (H.T. at 423K for 1day) photocatalysts, both loaded with 1wt.% Pt, represent ca. 12.4 and 19.7% of the quantum yields (100×the number of hydrogen atoms produced/number of absorbed photons) at λ ≥420nm, respectively. Based on the presented data, it can be concluded that the proposed fabrication of p–n composite semiconductors can be a successful and generic strategy to develop highly active photocatalysts under visible light. As discussed, AgGaS2 can be made as a low-resistivity p-type semiconductor, but n-type conductivity appears difficult or impossible to achieve [11–14]. In contrast, CdS can be made as n-type, but not as p-type [15,16]. The fundamental direct band gap energy of wurtzite CdS is 2.42eV at 300K, close to that of AgGaS2 (2.68eV). Consequently, comparable injection ratios are likely for electrons and holes if they form a CdS/AGS diode structure. Schematic of its structure model (together with a TEM image that supports the structure) is shown in Fig. 12 . The synergy observed for the p–n diode system may be attributable to efficient charge separation, caused by the rectification that sends photo-electrons and holes generated toward the opposite directions as indicated in Fig. 12. Thereby, the chance of electron-hole recombination is greatly reduced. This leads to high quantum yields and high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production under visible light irradiation."
9,Conclusions,"Bulky AgGaS2 (AGS) photocatalysts were heat-treated at high temperatures under H2S gas flow and the crystallinity and purity of the material was further improved. AGS heat-treated at high temperatures (1073–1123K) showed a high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from electrolyte solution containing sulfide and sulfite as sacrificial reagents under visible right irradiation (λ ≥420nm). The non-oxide typed photocatalytic diode n-CdS/p-AgGaS2 was successfully fabricated by hydrothermal treatment. The diode system formed with the n- and p-type semiconductors results in efficient charge separation, caused by the rectification of photo-electrons and holes generated. This results in the reduction of energy-wasteful electron-hole recombination and high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production under visible light irradiation."
