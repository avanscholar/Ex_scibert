0,Introduction,"The nations want to minimize their losses of resources (biotic, abiotic and economic) and fight against the causes of these losses. As a result, alternative energy sources have been a hot topic of investigation for researchers worldwide. Finding clean, more secure and diversified energy sources could be a successful strategy to reduce and eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to meet the world's energy needs. Compared to other alternatives, fuel cell H2 for vehicles application is considered an important energy carrier which could be used to reduce environmental impact and dependence on imported oil. In fact, H2 is the only carbon-free fuel to produce only water as combustion by-product. Furthermore H2 has the highest energy content compared to gaseous fuels of equivalent weight (Kotay and Das, 2008). Therefore, stakeholders in Japan, USA, India, China, and several European countries are investing heavily in H2 related research, development and demonstration projects. For instance, for a period of 28 years, ending in 2020 Japan have allocated about $11 billion to develop basic technologies for achieving a H2 based energy economy (Fernandes et al., 2005). Although H2 seems to be the perfect alternative fuel, there is currently no real environmental benefit from H2 use, because most of it is produced from fossil fuels (Chatzitakis et al., 2013). In fact, more than 95% of the H2 produced in the world comes from fossil fuels, with serious ecological and environmental consequences (Abanades et al., 2013). For example, the global warming potential (GWP) of H2 production by the steam methane reforming (SMR) process is estimated as 13.7 kg CO2 eq. per kg of H2 produced (Muradov and Veziroǧlu, 2005). A typical SMR-H2 plant with a capacity of one million m3 of H2 per day creates approximately 0.3–0.4 million cubic meters (STP) of CO2 per day, which is normally released into the atmosphere (Muradov and Veziroǧlu, 2005). This huge amount of GHG emissions generates some critical doubt as to whether H2 is the right solution to energy-related environmental, security and sustainability issues or not. Therefore, H2 derived from fossil fuels appears to have a limited horizon, and the development and implementation of new methods for sustainable H2 production are indispensable. Unfortunately, H2 produced from biorenewable feedstocks could be unsustainable considering the environmental damage generated by the entire system applied for its extraction. In fact, according to a previous study, Hajjaji et al. (2013a) showed that bioethanol-to-H2 systems have harmful environmental effects due to the environmental impacts of agricultural activities for wheat grain production and due to the large amount of heat (i.e., fuel consumption and emissions) required for the bioethanol production process (during distillation, drying, etc.). Therefore, examining resource consumptions, energy requirements and emissions from a life cycle point of view gives a comprehensive picture of the environmental burdens associated with H2 production (Spath and Mann, 2004). Clearly, the benefits of a true H2 economy can only be achieved if the H2 is derived from renewable resources with a sustainable process. Currently, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a well-known and widely used method to assess the potential environmental impacts and resources used throughout the entire life cycle of a product or process, including raw material acquisition, production, use, and end-of-life phases as defined by SETAC and coded by ISO 14040 standards (Abdul Hadi et al., 2013). In the last few years, LCA methodology has been used by several authors to evaluate the environmental performance of H2 systems (Dufour et al., 2012; Kalinci et al., 2012; Cetinkaya et al., 2012; Hacatoglu et al., 2012; Biswas et al., 2013). In the EU, approximately 17 million tons of slaughter byproducts are produced by the meat industry every year (Woodgate and van der Veen, 2004). From this raw material, over 1.5 million metric tons of animal fat (AF) and three million metric tons of protein are produced annually (Woodgate and van der Veen, 2004). Generally, AF constitutes about one third to one half of the total animal mass (Meeker, 2009). Like vegetable oil (VO), AF is primarily composed of triglycerides and minor amounts of mono and diglycerides. A triglyceride molecule consists of a three-carbon glycerol head group conjugated to three fatty acid chains (Dale et al., 2008). The fatty-acid carbon-chain lengths vary between 4 and 24 carbon atoms with up to six double bonds. A total of 24.64 million tons of animal fats were produced worldwide in 2007 (Lam et al., 2009). Considering this huge amount, the valorization of these renewable and cheap fatty materials remains necessary. The use of AF as a food additive has declined due to changing feeding habits, and the use of AF in animal feed has strongly decreased due to the possibility of severe animal disease (Dias et al., 2009). Recently, however, animal fat wastes have received significant attention for the production of biodiesel all around the globe (Banković-Ilić et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2012; Jørgensen et al., 2012). Animal fat-based biodiesel is a sustainable source of fuel with properties very similar to biodiesel produced from vegetable oil (Goodrum et al., 2003). Nevertheless, there are some differences; the main difference is that animal fat-based biodiesel (AFBD) contains more saturated fatty esters (Teixeira et al., 2010). AF as a biodiesel feedstock has some advantages and disadvantages. AFBD has a higher cetane number than VO biodiesel, which means that AFBD is cleaner and burns more efficiently in diesel engines (Dale et al., 2008). However, AFBD has a higher cloud point because of the high levels of saturated fatty acids. Its higher cloud point means that AFBD tends to crystallize out at low temperatures, creating problems in engines. In the past few years, some researchers have turned their interest toward fatty material-based (VO and AF) H2. Various processes were theoretically and experimentally proven by many research groups (Marquevich et al., 2001; Pimenidou et al., 2010a, 2010b; Yenumala and Maity, 2011; Hajjaji et al., 2013b; Hajjaji and Pons, 2013) to be a promising alternative for H2 production. Pimenidou et al. (2010a) used a chemical looping reforming (CLR) route for H2 production from waste cooking oil in a packed bed reactor and showed that a steam to carbon ratio of 4 and temperatures between 600 and 700 °C yielded the best results. Hajjaji and Pons (2013) investigated H2 production via steam and autothermal reforming (ATR) of beef tallow, showing that optimum conditions for steam reforming can be achieved at a reforming temperature of 700 °C and a steam-to-beef tallow ratio of approximately 5. The aim of this article is to comprehensively investigate, via thermodynamic and environmental analyses, a new process for H2 production based on ATR of poultry fat (PF-ATR-H2). Combinations of various tools are simultaneously applied for this investigation. These tools study the ATR reaction system, design and simulate the entire H2 production process, investigate the energetic performance of the process and perform an environmental impact assessment (using LCA methodology). An important aspect of this research is the application, for the first time, of LCA methodology to a PF-ATR-H2 system. The LCA methodology is applied to evaluate the life-cycle environmental burden of the entire PF-ATR-H2 system. Although many authors have already performed LCAs of biodiesel production from various fatty materials (AF and VO) (Talens Peiró et al., 2010; Morais et al., 2010; López et al., 2010; Dufour and Iribarren, 2012), to the best of our knowledge, a LCA of H2 production via ATR of poultry fat has not yet been published. This work is a continuation of our researches on H2 production via poultry fat reforming system. In our previous paper, various assessment tools (chemical reaction investigation, process simulation, energetic study and LCA) were applied to investigate a H2 production system from poultry fat steam reforming (Hajjaji, 2014). In this research, another alternative process (ATR process) is originally investigated. In fact, The ATR process is regarded as one of the most effective methods for producing H2 for fuel cell systems due to its high efficiency, easy startup, rapid response to power changes and simplicity (Lee et al., 2005)."
1,Materials and methods,"The methodology applied in this paper can be summarized by Fig. 1 . The chemical reactions investigation identifies thermodynamically optimal operating conditions at which poultry fat may be converted to H2 via the ATR process. The optimal conditions obtained are, subsequently, exploited in the design and simulation of an entire H2 production process. The results from the ATR process simulation are used for energetic study (thermal efficiency calculation) as well used as inputs to a life cycle inventory."
2,Hydrogen production by autothermal reforming of poultry fat,"2.1 Hydrogen production by autothermal reforming of poultry fat 2.1.1 Poultry fat characterization The total world poultry production is estimated at 106 million tons in 2013 and is approximately 15% fat (edible + non-edible) (FAO, 2014; Feddern et al., 2011). As described above, the major constituents of poultry fat are triglycerides consisting of straight-chains of fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid and palmitic) attached, as esters, to glycerol (Wakelin and Forster, 1997). Table 1 gives the typical fatty acid composition of the poultry fat considered in this work. In this paper, Aspen Plus™ 10.2 software (Aspen Technology, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) (Aspen PlusTM, 1988) is used to investigate the ATR chemical reaction system and to simulate the entire PF-ATR-H2 process. Aspen Plus™ is a process simulation software for chemical engineering applications. The software uses basic relationships such as energy and mass balances, chemical and phase equilibrium, and reaction kinetics to predict the behavior of a thermodynamic process or chemical reaction (Aspen PlusTM, 1988). However, all triglyceride forms (tristearin, tripalmitin, trioleate, etc.) are not included in the Aspen Plus™ databank, and they needed to be manually added before the simulation could be started. This operation required various data, including molecular weight, normal boiling point, chemical structure, temperature-dependent vapor pressures and heat capacity, standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of these compounds, to be inserted into the Aspen Plus™ dialog box (Aspen PlusTM, 1988) (data are provided in Table A.1 in Appendix). All data required for regression of properties were obtained from literature sources (Morad et al., 2000; Goodrum and Deller, 2002; Yenumala and Maity, 2011). 2.1.2 Autothermal reforming of poultry fat This section identifies thermodynamically favorable operating conditions at which poultry fat may be converted to H2 via the ATR process. These conditions must be chosen to maximize H2 production while minimizing the CO and CH4 content in the synthesis gas (SG). It is indispensable to reduce the CO content in the SG to reduce the required size of the gas-cleaning unit (Water Gas Shift (WGS) and CO preferential oxidation (COPROX)). Additionally, for H2 production, it is obvious that CH4 is not a desirable product because the formation of CH4 competes with H2 production and contributes to climate change as well. Relative to other reforming process (SR, partial oxidation (POX), etc.) used to produce H2, ATR is considered as the preferred option for reforming hydrocarbons because of its lower system complexity and better dynamic behavior (Martin and Wörner, 2011). In the PF-ATR-H2 process, poultry fat is fed with steam and oxygen; thus, SR and POX reactions occur simultaneously. The POX reaction is exothermic (i.e., it produces heat) while the SR reaction is endothermic, and heat must be generated externally for the reforming process. Typically, ATR reactions are considered to be thermally self-sustaining and consequently do not produce or consume external thermal energy. ATR of poultry fat involves a complex reaction system with undesired reaction paths to generate a SG (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, H2O, N2, etc.) (da Silva and Müller, 2011). The main reactions that occur are: Steam reforming (1) C 55.2 H 101.42 O 6 + 104.4 H 2 O ↔ 55.2 CO 2 + 155.11 H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = 7.67 MJ / mol Partial oxidation (2) C 55.2 H 101.42 O 6 + 24.6 O 2 ↔ 55.2 CO + 50.71 H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = − 4.12 MJ / mol Water gas shift (WGS): (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H ° 298 K = − 41.17 kJ / mol Methanation: (4) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H ° 298 K = − 206.11 kJ / mol (5) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H ° 298 K = − 164.94 kJ / mol Methane CO 2 reforming: (6) CO 2 + CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + 2 CO Δ H ° 298 K = 247.28 kJ / mol Carbon formation: (7) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C Δ H ° 298 K = − 172.43 kJ / mol (8) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + C Δ H ° 298 K = 74.85 kJ / mol (9) CO + H 2 ↔ C + H 2 O Δ H ° 298 K = − 131.26 kJ / mol The overall ATR reaction can be expressed by Eq. (10). (10) C 55.2 H 101.42 O 6 + a O 2 + b H 2 O ↔ c CO + d CO 2 + e H 2 + f CH 4 + g C The stoichiometric coefficients (a–g) depend on the reformer temperature (T), pressure (P), (S/C) ratio and the oxygen to carbon molar ratio (O/C). The S/C ratio is given by Eq. (11) (Yenumala and Maity, 2011). (11) Steam - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of steam moles of PF ) / ( moles of steam moles of PF ) stoichiometric = ( moles of steam ) 104 . 4 × ( moles of PF ) The O/C ratio is given by Eq. (12) (Yenumala and Maity, 2011). (12) Oxygen - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of oxygen moles of PF ) / ( moles of oxygen moles of PF ) stoichiometric = ( moles of oxygen ) 24.6 × ( moles of PF ) This investigation was performed at atmospheric pressure (P = 1 atm) because previous investigations regarding SR of oxygenated hydrocarbons have already shown that low pressures are thermodynamically preferable (Lwin et al., 2000; Perna, 2007). The O2 source can be either atmospheric air or pure O2. In the present work, atmospheric air was used as an O2 carrier because the use of pure O2 is not economical. During the thermodynamic investigation of H2 production by ATR from poultry fat, the SG composition determined using a simulation to minimize the Gibbs free energy using Aspen Plus™ 10.2 software (Aspen PlusTM, 1988). Minimization of the total Gibbs free energy is a recommended method for calculating the equilibrium compositions of any reacting system. This recommendation is based on the fact that the reaction system is thermodynamically favored when its total Gibbs free energy, expressed as a function of component concentrations, pressure and temperature, is at its minimum value (Smith et al., 2005). The theoretical details of this method are the same as that described in our previous publications (Hajjaji et al., 2013b; Hajjaji and Pons, 2013) and by other groups (Lwin et al., 2000; Yenumala and Maity, 2011; da Silva and Müller, 2011). The R-Gibbs reactor model (Aspen PlusTM, 1988) is selected for calculations using the UNIF-LBY equation of state (Aspen PlusTM, 1988). Depending on the catalyst employed and the completeness of conversion, the SG composition following the ATR reaction may be very complex. A previous study of ATR of beef tallow (Hajjaji and Pons, 2013) demonstrated that all triglyceride forms were fully converted. It was also demonstrated that the formation of by-products such as alkanes containing two or more carbon atoms, alkenes, acids and various alcohols was negligible (Hajjaji and Pons, 2013). Accordingly, the species considered in this work include only H2, CH4, CO2, CO, N2, O2 and H2O. The problem of coke formation is not addressed in this research because all of the considered configurations have S/C > 2 and T > 573 K. It was demonstrated previously for beef tallow autothermal reforming (Hajjaji and Pons, 2013) that coke was absent at temperatures above 573 K with an S/C ratio above 1. Consequently, coke (carbon) is excluded from the component list as possible product. Furthermore, the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations performed here ignore the kinetic aspects of the ATR reaction. The results of this investigation are still helpful in locating ranges of favorable operation conditions for the PF-ATR-H2 system. Further refinement of the optimal conditions will require detailed kinetic investigations. 2.1.3 Design and simulation of an entire PF-ATR-H2 process This section describes the simulation methodology of the ATR process. The results are used, thereafter, as inputs to a life cycle inventory and are introduced into SimaPro 7.3 software (PRé Consultants, 2011). As previously reported by other authors (Seo et al., 2002; Salemme et al., 2010; Boyano et al., 2012), a typical thermo-chemical H2 production process includes a SG generation unit coupled to a CO cleanup section; the cleanup section guarantees H2 production with a CO level within the fuel cell tolerance limit. The WGS reactors and the COPROX reactor perform the cleanup of CO (Salemme et al., 2010). In practice, WGS is carried out at two different temperature ranges: a High Temperature Shift (HTS), operating between 573 and 673 K, and a Low Temperature Shift (LTS), operating between 473 and 573 K (Rahimpour et al., 2012). Because the shift reaction is equilibrium-limited, CO conversion is incomplete, and additional step of CO removal is required. Therefore, the gas leaving the LTS reactor is mixed with atmospheric air before entering the COPROX reactor, where the remaining CO is oxidized to CO2 via combustion reaction Eq. (13). Unfortunately, H2 is also oxidized in the COPROX reactor as shown in Eq. (14) (Giunta et al., 2007). (13) CO + 0.5 O 2 → CO 2 (14) H 2 + 0.5 O 2 → H 2 O A lack of O2 can result in inefficient reactor operation because the CO content will not be sufficiently reduced. However, an excess of O2 (air) produces excessive H2 oxidation (Eq. (14)), further reducing H2 production (Giunta et al., 2007). Therefore, there is a trade-off between a high or low air (O2)/CO ratio. In this research, the atmospheric air flow rate (for the COPROX reactor) is adjusted to obtain a molar CO concentration lower than 20 ppm with only 1% H2 conversion. The detailed flowsheet of the designed PF-ATR-H2 process is depicted in Fig. 2 . The ATR reactor is modeled as an isothermal reactor operating at a thermoneutral condition (without external heat supply). As detailed below, the thermoneutral condition is enforced by assuming that the steam, poultry fat and air feeds to the reactor enter at the reactor temperature (Yenumala and Maity, 2011). It is obvious that an increase in the preheat temperature is compensated for by a decrease in oxidation reaction predominance (i.e., decrease of O/C ratio) to achieve the required temperature in the reformer at a thermoneutral condition (Perna, 2007). Accordingly, poultry fat, water and air are preheated to the reforming temperature before entering the reformer. The effect of preheat temperature is described in the discussion section. To obtain high efficiencies for the ATR process, it is necessary that a part of the thermal energy required to preheat the feed streams is derived from an internal source and not from the combustion of an additional quantity of fuel. Consequently, before flowing into the water pre-heater (Water-PrH), water is vaporized after passing through a series of heat exchangers (Fig. 2). First, water recovers the calories from the produced SG (3 → 4), then passes through the LTS cooler (COOL-LTS) (4 → 5), the HTS cooler (COOL-HTS) (5 → 6) and finally the SG cooler (COOL-SYNG) (6 → 7). The SG leaving the ATR reactor is cooled to 573 K (HTS inlet temperature) in a heat exchanger (COOL-SYNG) (9 → 10). The gas exiting the HTS reactor is cooled to 473 K (LTS inlet temperature) in COOL-HTS (11 → 12). The product stream leaving the LTS reactor passes through a heat exchanger (COOL-LTS) before being fed to the COPROX reactor at 423 K (13 → 14). Finally, the gas exiting the COPROX reactor is cooled to 423 K after passing through a heat exchanger (COOL-CO) (15 → 16). All process reactors (reformer, HTS, LTS and COPROX) are modeled using the library model RGibbs using the UNIF-LBY equation of state (Aspen PlusTM, 1988). The library model RGibbs reactor in the Aspen Plus™ package is used to calculate the chemical and phase equilibria by minimizing the Gibbs free energy. RGibbs models single-phase chemical equilibrium, or simultaneous phase and chemical equilibrium by minimizing Gibbs free energy, subject to atom balance constraints. This model is useful when temperature and pressure are known and reaction stoichiometry is unknown. The Aspen Plus™ library model HEATX is used to simulate all of the heat exchangers (i.e., COOL-SYNG, COOL-HTS, COOL-LTS and COOL-CO), whereas the pre-heaters (PF-PrH, Water-PrH and Air-PrH) are modeled using the HEATER model. To evaluate the energetic performance of the process, we use the thermal efficiency. The thermal efficiency is based on considerations of the first law of thermodynamics and is calculated as the energy output divided by the energy input (Benito et al., 2007) as shown in Eq. (15). (15) η Thermal = m H 2 × LHV H 2 m PF × LHV PF + Q PF − Pr H + Q Water − Pr H + Q Air − Pr H where mi and LHVi are the mass flow and the Lower Heating Value of species i, respectively and Qi is the heat supplied to equipment i. It should be noted here that the lower heating value of poultry fat is calculated by the equation of Demirbaş (1998), which is an empirical calculation based on chemical analysis data (LHVpoultry fat = 40.84 MJ/kg)."
3,Life cycle assessment of H2 production via poultry fat,"2.2 Life cycle assessment of H2 production via poultry fat 2.2.1 LCA background LCA is an internationally standardized methodology used to assess the potential environmental impacts and resources used throughout a product's life cycle, from raw material acquisition to production and use phases and finally to waste management (ISO, 2006a). These considerations make LCA one of the best approaches for environmental assessment of products or services. Current LCA practice, as standardized by ISO (ISO, 2006b), follows four interrelated phases: 1. Goal and scope definition: Specifies objectives of the study, the system boundaries, and sets a functional unit to provide a reference for all input and output data. 2. Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis: Identifies material and energy inputs and outputs for all processes within the boundaries of the system. 3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA): Evaluates the environmental impacts of the energy and material flows identified in the LCI analysis in three steps: (i) classification of impact categories, (ii) characterization of inventory data by quantifying their contributions to the impact categories, (iii) normalization and weighting. 4. Interpretation of the results: Evaluates the LCA model by identifying significant issues based on the results of LCI and LCIA, considering completeness and consistency, and makes conclusions and recommendations. 2.2.2 LCA of PF-ATR-H2 system 2.2.2.1 Goal and scope definition 2.2.2.1.1 Goal and scope The goal of this LCA is to evaluate the life-cycle environmental burdens and energy performance of a H2 production system based on ATR of poultry fat. 2.2.2.1.2 Functional unit, system boundaries, and common assumptions The functional unit chosen is one kg of H2 produced by PF-ATR-H2 system. All emissions, materials and energy consumption and transport are based on this functional unit. The system boundaries, shown in Fig. 3 , include all of the processes necessary to deliver the system's functional unit. The PF-ATR-H2 system boundaries encompass rendering and reforming processes along with the required transportation processes. Rendering is a complex process that involves the application of heat, the extraction of moisture and the separation of fat. First, slaughter waste (poultry by-products) are ground to a consistent size and cooked with steam at temperatures from 115 °C to 145 °C for 40–90 min (Orellana et al., 2013). Moisture is boiled off, and the free poultry fat is drained. The poultry fat associated with the solids is mechanically removed by screw presses, and the moisture associated with extracted poultry fat is separated using centrifuges. The two main product streams of the rendering process are the poultry fat and the protein meals, which can contain 8–15% residual fat. Mass allocation was used to distribute the environmental burdens between these products. The process is assumed to occur in the Sfax region (central Tunisia). The system boundaries include background processes for the thermal energy production (for rendering and reforming), transportation, electricity production and water supply. No environmental impacts are considered for the feedstock (poultry by-product) as it is made up from waste (López et al., 2010). The thermal energy requirement for rendering and reforming processes are taken from the Ecoinvent database and modeled in SimaPro® as “Heat, natural gas, at boiler modulating >100 kW” (Frischknecht et al., 2007). Transportation implies the transport of raw material (poultry by-products) to the rendering process and the transport of poultry fat to the reforming process. This study assumed that the average distance of both configurations (transport poultry by-products to rendering process and transport of poultry fat to reforming process) was 100 km. The transportation is assumed by road using lorries (32 tons, modeled in SimaPro® as “Lorry 32t”). The effect of transport distance on system performance is studied in the sensitivity analysis. It should be noted here that the poultry fat is freely available, with no energy and emissions associated with the poultry fat feedstock. The construction and decommissioning phases as well as the manufacture and recycling of reforming catalysts are not considered in this work. 2.2.2.2 Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis Rendering data are adapted from the inventory assessment of biodiesel production from poultry fat previously undertaken by López et al. (2010), while reforming data are obtained from the process simulation in Aspen Plus™. The environmental consequences of the background process frequently account for a major portion of the total environmental burden identified in product LCA across a broad variety of product types and a range of impact categories. Background processes are normally incorporated into the software databases, but the conditions of the processes (e.g., transport modals, transport distance, electricity matrix, etc.) are sometimes different from local conditions, so the data should be adapted to the local situation for a more reliable inventory. In this work, the data of the background processes are taken from the Ecoinvent database (Frischknecht et al., 2007). To reproduce the Tunisian electricity mix (not included in the SimaPro databank), electricity production is produced from a mix of 97% natural gas and 3% hydropower. 2.2.2.3 Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) LCI data were computationally implemented into SimaPro 7.3 (Goedkoop et al., 2010) to carry out the LCIA. A set of six relevant environmental impact categories are evaluated: global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion (ADP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), ozone layer depletion (ODP) and photochemical oxidant formation (POFP). These impact categories were evaluated using the problem-oriented (midpoint) approach with the CML baseline 2000 method (Guinèe et al., 2001). As additional impacts categories, an energy analysis was also carried out based on cumulative non-renewable fossil and nuclear energy demand (CED) and Cumulative Exergy Demand (CExD). CED represents the overall energy consumed over the life cycle in order to produce one kg of hydrogen and it is mainly related to the consumption of energetic raw materials. In contrast to CED, CExD takes into account the quality of energetic resources. CExD has the advantage of including also non-energetic resources such as metals and minerals (Boesch and Hellweg, 2010). The unit of CED and CExD is the MJ equivalent (MJeq)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Autothermal reforming of poultry fat,"3.1 Autothermal reforming of poultry fat The results of the chemical reaction investigation of poultry fat autothermal reforming are depicted in Figs. 4–6 . Fig. 4 shows that an increase in the O/C ratio decreases H2 productivity at constant temperature. In fact, additional O2 (increase of O/C) shifts the incomplete oxidation of the SG to a combustion reaction, resulting in decreased H2 yield. Moreover, an increase in the S/C ratio improves the H2 production. This result may be explained with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is subjected to an external stress, it responds in a way that diminishes the effect of this disturbance. When the S/C ratio is increased, the number of moles of water on the reactant side of Eqs. (3) and (10) increases, and the equilibrium of the ATR and WGS reactions shift towards the products side, resulting in increased H2 yield. It is obvious that the S/C ratio is a critical parameter to consider during the design of production and purification processes for H2. Typically, excess steam (increase of S/C ratio) is used to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reforming reactions and to enhance the amount of H2 produced. In order to realize the effect of S/C ratio on H2 productivity, H2 yield is plotted as a function of S/C ratio at different O/C ratios in Fig. 5. From this figure, we can conclude that H2 productivity can be improved by increasing the S/C ratio (as described above). However, the gain in H2 yield is not significant for values of the S/C above 5, where the reaction system consumes excessive amounts of water. As observed in Fig. 6, at low reforming temperatures, CO content is quite low and increases with increasing temperature. This result is because low temperatures favor the exothermic WGS (Eq. (3)) and methanation reactions (Eqs. (4) and (5)), leading to low CO content in the SG. Therefore, achieving a high H2 yield while minimizing CO content is not possible because the temperature must be high enough to maximize H2 production but must be as low as possible to minimize CO content. Fig. 6 shows that, as the amount of oxygen in the feed increases, the CO content at low S/C ratio becomes more important than the CO produced at higher WGFR values for a given temperature. For H2 production, CH4 is not a desirable product because CH4 formation competes with H2 yield. As shown in Fig. 6, CH4 content at low temperatures is very high and precipitously decreases with increased temperature. For a given temperature, the CH4 content strongly decreases as S/C ratio increases. To summarize these results, the most favorable conditions for H2 production are achieved when the temperature, S/C and O/C are 873–973 K, 5 and 0.0–0.5, respectively. Further refinement of these optimal conditions is discussed in the investigation of the thermoneutral condition. In an ATR process, O2 supplies the required heat for endothermic steam reforming via an oxidation reaction; therefore, increasing O/C ratio decreases external heat requirement. As a result, it is possible to operate the ATR reactor without supplying external heat by adjusting the O/C ratio. This condition is referred to as a thermoneutral condition. The reforming temperature where the external heat flow is equal to zero is also known as the adiabatic (thermoneutral) temperature (TAD). Operating the reforming reactor without providing external heat for cooling or heating is possible at this temperature, making this operation condition valuable from an energy consumption point of view (Kale and Kulkarni, 2010). This thermoneutral investigation is performed by considering steam, poultry fat and air as feeds entering into the reactor at the reactor temperature. Fig. 7 shows the variation of reactor heat duty with O/C ratio at 873 K. The O/C ratio has a very strong effect on the heat duty of the ATR reaction. An increase in the O/C ratio can even transform the overall reaction from endothermic to exothermic. The intersection of the heat duty curves with the thermoneutral line (corresponding to zero heat duty) gives the O/C ratio at the thermoneutral condition (i.e., O/C = 0.436). To conclude, the recommended conditions that maximize H2 production while minimizing CH4 and CO contents at thermoneutral conditions are S/C = 5, T = 873 K and O/C = 0.436. Under these conditions, 148.5 mol H2/kg poultry fat can be produced with only 0.8% CO and 0.02% CH4 in the SG. These recommended conditions are subsequently used in the design and simulation of the entire PF-ATR-H2 process. It is worth to be noted that the identification of the accurate optimum conditions requires a further investigation via multi-parameter optimization. This optimization involves the definition of an objective function to be maximized (max H2 in the SG) under constraints (min (CO and CH4) in SG)."
6,Process simulation,"3.2 Process simulation Material and energy inputs and outputs associated with the PF-ATR-H2 process are estimated based on simulations using the process simulator ASPEN Plus™. Table 2 summarizes the mass and energy balance results of the PF-ATR-H2 process expressed per kg of H2 produced. The stream proprieties (T, P, mole flow, composition) are provided in Table A.2 in the Appendix. The thermal efficiency of the process is 52.31%, which indicates that approximately half of the energy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (H2). It should be noted that the thermal efficiency of the process is relatively lower compared to the efficiencies of similar processes cited in the literature and of other H2 production processes (SMR: 68% (Simpson and Lutz, 2007), methane autothermal reforming: 71.41% (Hajjaji et al., 2013a), ethanol autothermal reforming: 82.5% (Khila et al., 2013)). This difference is mainly attributed to the high consumption of thermal energy to preheat the reactants (97.30 MJ/kg H2). This heat requirement may be lowered by decreasing the preheat temperature. However, a decrease in preheat temperature must be compensated for with an increased O/C ratio to achieve the required temperature in the reformer at thermoneutral condition. However, the reforming reaction performance is very sensitive to variations in O/C ratio. To investigate the effect of reactant temperature, we plot in Fig. 8 the process characteristics as function of preheat temperature. What is important to notice is that an increase in preheat temperature raises the heat requirement and improves H2 productivity as well as thermal efficiency. However, besides the large amount of fuel that must be burned for heat, the considerable external heat supply requires additional heat exchange area and additional cost investment."
7,LCA results,"3.3 LCA results The main inventory data of the PF-ATR-H2 system for producing 1 kg of H2 are provided in Table 3 . These data constitute themselves a key outcome of this study. As it can be seen, the inputs refer mainly to the reforming and rendering processes as well as to the thermal and electric energy requirements. CO2 emissions from poultry fat (biogenic resources) are not included in GWP. Although CO2 molecules from fossil fuels and bio-renewable resource (poultry fat) behave similarly, the molecules are treated differently when calculating GHG emissions. CO2 resulting from the burning or decay of bio-renewable resource grown on a sustainable basis is considered to mimic the closed loop of the natural carbon cycle and is not included in the calculation of GHG (Bolin and Smith, 2011; Hong et al., 2006). The characterization results computed for the production of 1 kg of H2 are presented in Table 4 . A breakdown of the contribution of the production subsystems (stages) is depicted in Fig. 9 to identify the most relevant subsystem for the environmental impact categories. According to Fig. 9, the thermal energy system is a major contributor of the environmental burdens in the PF-ATR-H2 system (highest impact in 5 of the 7 categories). The thermal energy requirement involves the thermal energy for (i) rendering and (ii) reforming. Approximately 81% of the heat requirement impact is attributed to the thermal energy demand in the reforming process. Hence, environmental improvements should be focused on minimization of the heat requirement via a more rational choice of the reactant preheat temperature. Because energy indicators and global warming are core concerns when assessing the performance of biofuel systems (Pereira de Souza et al., 2010; Dufour and Iribarren, 2012), the interpretation of the results and sensitivity analysis will mainly focus on CED and GWP. The GWP quantifies the contribution of gaseous emissions from the PF-ATR-H2 system to the environmental problem of climate change. The total GHG emissions of the PF-ATR-H2 system are estimated to be approximately 9.57 kg CO2-eq per kg of H2 produced. According to Fig. 9, GHG emissions were mainly derived from the thermal energy requirement (85%), especially due to the high consumption of heat in the reforming process (corresponding to approximately 69.7% of total GWP impact). CED is especially suited to determining and comparing the energy intensity of processes, including direct and indirect uses of energy. Here, CED is used to compute energy consumption throughout the life cycle of H2 and to identify the most energy intensive steps of H2 production. As described in Table 4, a total of 162.02 MJ-eq is required to produce one kg of H2. The thermal energy requirement was again the main factor for CED, and the thermal energy requirement's contribution was 84% of the total. Transport and production of electricity are the most significant secondary contributors, with 8.29% and 7.37% of CED, respectively. The overall thermal efficiency of the system is defined as energy output divided by overall energy input (Neelis et al., 2004). The total energy output of the PF-ATR-H2 system is 120 MJ (LHV of H2 produced). The total energy input is calculated as the sum of non-renewable energy use (i.e., 162.02 MJ/kg H2 (CED given by Table 4)) and the renewable energy use mainly assigned to poultry fat (mpoultry fat·LHVpoultry fat = 131.91 MJ/kg H2, mpoultry fat is the mass of poultry fat required to produce 1 kg H2 (given in Table 3)). According to these values, the total energy input is 293.93 MJ/kg H2, and the overall thermal efficiency is 40.83%. Clearly, the overall efficiency is less than the process thermal efficiency (i.e., 52.31%). This difference occurs because the process efficiency omits the energy consumption from the other life cycle stages (i.e., electricity generation, transport and rendering). To determine renewable character of the produced H2, we use the energetic renewability ratio defined by Neelis et al. (2004) and given by (Eq. (16)) (16) α H 2 ,renewability , % = ( renewable energy input ) / ( renewable energy + non - renewable energy input ) The energetic renewability ratio of H2 produced by PF-ATR-H2 system is 44.88%. This low value is attributed to the high consumption of non-renewable energy throughout the entire life cycle. However, it must be noted that the best result for H2 renewability is 100%, which means that all energy input used for H2 production is renewable. Hence, the renewability of the system can be improved by the use of renewable energy for thermal energy generation, electricity production and transport. Table 4 shows that 647.60 MJ of useful energy (exergy) is consumed to generate 1 kg of hydrogen over the life cycle. This value is superior to the CED because CExD includes both the quantity and the quality of energetic sources consumptions as well non-energetic raw materials like minerals and metals. Notably, but not surprisingly, the thermal energy requirement was the main factor for CExD with a contribution of 86.2%. In an effort to increase our understanding of the opportunities of the PF-ATR-H2 process, this part compares the life-cycle environmental profiles of PF-ATR-H2 system with other alternative routes for H2 production: H2 production by conventional SMR system (SMR-H2) (Susmozas et al., 2013), H2 production by lignocellulosic biomass gasification (Biom-gasi-H2) (Iribarren et al., 2014), H2 production by bioethanol autothermal reforming (Bioeth-ATR-H2) (Hajjaji et al., 2013a) and H2 production by bioethanol steam reforming (Bioeth-SER-H2) (Hajjaji et al., 2013a). As can be observed in Fig. 10 , the PF-ATR-H2 system is found to be a better option in most impacts considered. However, GWP and CED remain fairly high due to excessive consumption of thermal energy. It has to be emphasized that the reforming inventory data are estimated based on ASPEN Plus™. The aim of the study is to identify the environmental burdens associated with a prospective H2 production system. In order to have more realistic results, the reforming inventory data should be collected on a real H2 plant. In our sensitivity analysis, we intend to determine the effect of transportation distance on study results. For this reason, seven transportation simulations were considered (1: 100 km (base case); 2: 200 km; 3: 300 km; 4:400 km; 5: 500 km; 6: 700 km and 7: 1000 km). Fig. 11 illustrates the GWP impact and CED under these simulations. As described in Fig. 11, an increase in transport distance increases significantly GWP impact and CED. In reality, increasing transport distance leads to a higher demand for the diesel used in lorries. Obvious consequences of increasing diesel use are an increase in CO2 emissions and in overall energy requirement (i.e., increase in CED). Consequently, it is important to note that transport distances should be kept short to reduce damage to the environment as well as lessen the financial burden of H2 production."
8,Conclusion,"The aim of this research was to investigate a new process for H2 production based on ATR of poultry fat. A combination of various assessment tools was simultaneously applied. The investigation of the chemical reactions reveals that the recommended conditions that maximize H2 production while minimizing CH4 and CO content at thermoneutral conditions are steam to carbon ratio of 5, T = 873 K and oxygen to carbon ratio of 0.436. Under these conditions, 148.5 mol H2/kg poultry fat can be produced with only 0.8% CO and 0.02% CH4 in the synthesis gas. These recommended conditions were subsequently used in the design and simulation of the entire PF-ATR-H2 process. The thermal efficiency of the process is 52.31%, which indicates that approximately half of the energy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (H2). This value is relatively lower than those cited in the literature and relative to other H2 production processes. The LCA results reveal that the thermal energy required for the rendering and reforming operations constitutes the major cause of the environmental burdens in the PF-ATR-H2 system (highest impact in five of the seven categories). Compared to a conventional process for H2 production (i.e., SMR-H2), the PF-ATR-H2 system is found to be a better option in terms of all of the impacts considered. However, ADP, GWP and CED remain fairly high. Minimization of the heat requirement is highly recommended to improve the system energetics and environmental performance. Finally, creating an energetic application for poultry fat avoids its tendency to be utilized as a food additive, with the associated risks to human health. Moreover, because poultry fat is derived from animal by-products, which have little to no value, it avoids some of the food vs. fuel debate. In this study, a PF-ATR-H2 system was investigated from an energy and environmental point of view. It might be supported by other decision-making tools that consider the economic and social effects of poultry fat management."
