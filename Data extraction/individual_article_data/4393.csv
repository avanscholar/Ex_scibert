0,Introduction,"Space flight safety issues include analysis of fire/explosion hazards in flight, at a launch place and during preparatory stages [1,2]. Currently a lot of efforts is focused on research and development of rocket engines using hydrogen peroxide [3–10]. One of the most significant steps towards hydrogen peroxide monopropellant realization is development of technical solution for thrusters, including design of effective, reliable, long-lived catalytic beds, which are insensitive to poisoning by stabilizers and impurities contained in the propellant [10]. Basic limitations, associated with the development of these catalysts and usage of hydrogen peroxide as monopropellant, are connected with the following: − low stability of the product, significant decrease of hydrogen peroxide in time, which leads to propellant decline of the propellant's performance even with a slight decrease of hydrogen peroxide concentration; − rapid catalytic poisoning which can disturb thrusters' performance; − explosive characteristics of the product: some impurities can accelerate decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide. All of these restrictions are primarily related to the purity of the product, as undesirable impurities including stabilizers can adversely affect a catalyst, reducing its life time. Quality of the monopropellant depends on methods of the production [11] and on a process of purification before concentration. Purification of hydrogen peroxide is a complex technical problem, because of the product's instability. Therefore, development of hydrogen peroxide purification technology, which allows to produce pure high-concentrated product at acceptable costs and safety level, can simplify the task of developing hydrogen peroxide mono-propellant thrusters."
1,Hydrogen peroxide purity requirements,"One of the main difficulties that arises in a process of hydrogen peroxide concentration is connected with increasing of its explosiveness, driven by various impurities contained in hydrogen peroxide solution. Depending on the production method hydrogen peroxide solutions contain different impurities. Currently, there are three main methods of hydrogen peroxide production: electrochemical, anthraquinone autoxidation, isopropyl alcohol autoxidation [12]. Hydrogen peroxide solution produced by the electrochemical method contains only inorganic impurities such as sulfuric acid and catalytically active ions of heavy metals. This technology provides the highest quality product comparing to others so it is often used to obtain a high concentrated product. However, the use of this product in rocket engines has shown that even a small amount of inorganic impurities (sulfur) has a negative impact thrusters' catalysts lifetime. This fact increased an interest in obtaining concentrated hydrogen peroxide by other technologies. Hydrogen peroxide solutions produced by anthraquinone autoxidation or isopropyl alcohol autoxidation contain catalytically active ions of heavy metals and organic impurities. Depending on the features of the technological process, there are different quantities of various impurities in the hydrogen peroxide solutions. Method of anthraquinone autoxidation is spread outside of Russian Federation. One of the most significant disadvantages of this technology is formation of toxic by-products which require a special disposal [13]. This weak point becomes more important for creation of a green propellant. Method of isopropyl alcohol autoxidation is more environmentally friendly; the only waste products are non-toxic gases and acetone, which can be hydrogenated back to isopropyl alcohol. This method is widely used in Russian Federation. Nevertheless, it is more explosive than anthraquinone autoxidation. On average isopropyl alcohol autoxidation production method results in getting 30–40% hydrogen peroxide solution. This aqueous solution has impurities such as acetic acid, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, acetone peroxide, heavy metal ions. Organic impurities contents in the product is 0,55–0,7%wt., namely: 0,2–0,3 g/dm3 of isopropanol, 6–8 g/dm3 of acetone and 6–8 g/dm3 acetic acid (based on the carbon) [14]. Such quantity of impurities corresponds to the product quality requirements, established by Refs. [15] and [16] for hydrogen peroxide and high-concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions respectively. Although, neither of these documents limits the content of organic compounds, with an exception of acetic acid. However, even 1% growth of impurities' contents in hydrogen peroxide solutions substantially reduces stability of the product. In addition to that, organic impurities may not only be catalysts of hydrogen peroxide decomposition, they can also initiate explosion. For example, acetone peroxides formed during the production process are the initiating agents (1). (1) 3СН3СОСН3 + 3Н2О2 → С9Н18О6 + 3Н2О – 359,44 kJ/mol The presence of this chemical is one of the major hazards during the production of hydrogen peroxide. Even a small amount of peroxide acetone in the solutions can initiate an explosion. Heat blast triacetone triperoxide is 2803 kJ/kg, which is 88% of TNT equivalent. The velocity of detonation triacetone triperoxide is 5300 m/sec at a density of 1,2 g/cm3 and about 1430 m/sec at 0,47 g/cm3. Despite of this, acetic acid, acetone, isopropyl alcohol are flammable liquids with a flashpoints 40 °C, −18 °C, 12 °C respectively. Besides, acetic acid reaction with hydrogen peroxide leads to formation of peracetic acid (2), an unstable chemical which decomposes to acetic acid and oxygen with a significant amount of heat (3). (2) CH 3 COOH + H 2 O 2 ⇄ CH 3 C ( O ) OOH + H 2 O − 1199 , 41 kJ/mol (3) 2СН3С(O)ОOН → 2СН3СОOН + О2 + 1554,6 kJ/mol Therefore, additional requirements to the purity of concentrated hydrogen peroxide are needed to reduce the risk of explosion. According to preliminary estimates content of acetone and isopropyl impurities should be less than 0,02%wt. in order to provide good quality and appropriate safety level for the high-concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution."
2,Hydrogen peroxide purification methods,"Basic researches aimed at obtaining high purity hydrogen peroxide from alcohols were conducted in 50–80s of the XX century. The most well-known methods of hydrogen peroxide purification from organic compounds after isopropyl alcohol autoxidation are: − organic solvents extraction; − removing impurities using ion exchange resins; − distillation and rectification. Method based on organic solvents extraction did not reach extensive use, despite a few number of foreign patents developing this technology. This is due to necessity of additional operations aimed to extractants' regeneration and possibility of product's contamination with new impurities [17,18]. Removing impurities using ion exchange resins allows to extract not only organic impurities, but also heavy metals' ions. However, low exchange capacity of anion exchange resins makes it difficult to use this method on an industrial scale [17]. Distillation and rectification is the most frequently used method. Almost all of its particular applications are based on a sequential distillation and rectification aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions with steaming. These applications require a large amount of energy, but still allow obtaining high purity hydrogen peroxide solutions. In the early 2000s, interest in obtaining high-concentrated hydrogen peroxide increased again [19]. Shortage of quality hydrogen peroxide was especially obvious in the field of special technique. Development of technologies of concentrating hydrogen peroxide at the point of use has started [20,21]. For example [21], provides a method of concentrating aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution by distillation and evaporation of a dilute solution in two separate equipment's pieces which are easy to dismantle and to transport. A distinctive feature of the invention is the ability to easily transport equipment for hydrogen peroxide concentration directly at the place of its intended use. It reduces the hazards associated with the transportation of the high-concentrated product. However, the technology does not allow cleaning the initial solutions. Therefore, aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide must contain at least 100 mg/kg of organic material; the metal content in it must be less than 1 mg/kg to begin normal process of concentration. Other interesting concentrating technology in recent years has been developed at NASA. It is based on development of special membrane [22]. In this method a polymeric membrane separate a hydrogen peroxide solution from a sweep gas or permeate. The membrane is selective to the permeability of water over the permeability of hydrogen peroxide. Membrane is designed so that peroxide solution is on one side, while the dry air on the other. Capacity of dry air increases with temperature; however the process is conducted only at a temperature of spontaneous decomposition of the peroxide. The [22] states that hydrogen peroxide solutions of up to 85% by volume or higher may be generated at a point of use without storing substantial quantities of the highly-concentrated solutions and without requiring temperatures that would produce explosive mixtures of hydrogen peroxide vapors. This method is very promising. Some researches are made to improve it [23]. However, designed membrane transmits only water vapor, it can be assumed that the quality of the original product must be high to prevent unexpected decomposition or explosion of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of impurities. One of the most recently developed technologies of hydrogen peroxide purification produced by isopropyl alcohol autoxidation is based on method of rectification [14]. This invention provides a method of four stage rectification. Distinctive features of this method in comparison with existing analogues are: 1. Quality of the product is very high. The content of impurities in 30–35% hydrogen peroxide solutions is less than 4·10−3 wt% for organic compounds, including acetic acid, and less than 3·10−4 wt% for non-organic compounds. 2. it provides protection for structural material equipment from corrosion without exceeding the concentration of corrosion inhibitors in the final product. Thus, this technology solves the problems of the presence of impurities and the possibility of initiating the hydrogen peroxide decomposition during storage or transportation. One of the disadvantages of this method is connected with usage of mixed additives: ammonium nitrate and phosphoric acid salts. Phosphorous compounds have a negative impact on life catalyst of rocket engines. Other disadvantages are large energy consumption and serious loss of hydrogen peroxide after each stage of distillation (after 4 stages product losses amounted to 41% from the initial content). Nevertheless, even overpriced hydrogen product of this quality is acceptable, considering latest development of technologies that require regular provision of high-concentrated pure hydrogen peroxide in small amounts and increasing demand on pure hydrogen peroxide. To illustrate the main differences between the existing methods of purifying hydrogen peroxide, a comparative Table 1 is presented below."
3,Hydrogen peroxide four stage rectification technology safety,"Providing safety to the process of hydrogen peroxide purification is one of the most important tasks for the successful implementation of its production. The distillation process has a lot of fire hazards. There are numerous descriptions of security stages of production in the literature [24–29]. Nevertheless, due to the special properties of hydrogen peroxide solutions the process requires special attention [11]. Principal scheme of the first and second stages of rectification is shown on the Fig. 1 . Third and fourth stages of rectification are similar to second stage. Analysis of the technology presented in Ref. [14] allows identification of the main hazards related to thе process: − presence of flammable liquids and oxidizers. Formation of combustible vapor concentrations within the column; − presence of explosive substances; − high temperature; − work in vacuum; − possibility of depressurization: complex design of equipment (distillation columns have a large number of different kinds of connections, hatches, manholes, pipes). During scheduled mode, formation of flammable mixtures inside the equipment is extremely unlikely. The presence of inflammable liquids is limited by quantity of impurities in the initial solution (0,7 wt%). In top product stream organics amount can reach up to 90% of the original impurities. According to preliminary estimates the amount of flammable liquids is substantially lower than inflammability limits of the working mixture. This estimates were made taking into account water addition (50% or more), which has phlegmatizing action, elevated temperatures, which extends inflammability limits, and low pressure process that narrows the inflammability limits. According to [30] at a concentration of 40% hydrogen peroxide content of acetone and alcohol should be less than 10%, at 50% - less than 8% and 80% - less than 4%, respectively, to avoid the explosion. Therefore, concentration of acetone and alcohol in the working mixture is substantially lower than explosive limits of the compound. Another danger of the purification process is formation of hazardous substances such as organic peroxides (triperoxide acetone (1) or peracetic acid (2)), and the explosiveness of concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Risk of dangers related to organic peroxides reduces from stage to stage of purification because their amount reduces during the process. Risk high-concentrated hydrogen peroxide explosion conversely grows to the fourth stage of rectification. Organic peroxides are very unstable and decompose at high temperatures (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, steaming on the first stage of rectification is a good preventative measure conducive to organic peroxides destruction. This procedure reduces the probability of its accumulation and detonation. However, these chemicals could accumulate in difficult to access places (connections of the columns, pipes), in pipes after rectification and in container 5, where the temperature is lower. The possibility of organic peroxides formation after others stages of rectifications should be investigated during the plant designing. It depends on the amount of the compound passing through during a production cycle. Anyway, the best thing to avoid explosion during maintenance work is to use steaming for equipment and pipelines after stoppage process. It is known that concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions under certain conditions are explosive. The main reason for intensive decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the equipment is occurrence of decomposition catalysts. Possible causes of getting decomposition catalysts in the equipment are: − loss of containment; − dirt with initial products such as steam, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers (filter rejection, errors of inspection test, bad quality etc.) − errors during maintenance work. Loss of containment of rectification column operating under a vacuum is a very hazardous situation. Despite possibility of compounds' contamination, it leads to air leaks, which increase the regulated pressure in the column. Increasing pressure elevates the temperature that facilitates the decomposition of peroxide hydrogen and increases the risk of explosion. In case of column depressurization immediate drain in open containers is required. The presence of open containers is necessary to prevent an explosion of heated hydrogen peroxide in emergency discharge. Danger of contamination with initial products could be minimized by organizing an entry control system for each product and working with reliable suppliers. Errors during the maintenance work could lead to hazardous situations as well as lack of maintenance work. So it is very important to organize maintenance works in appropriate way: to carry out the selection of highly qualified specialists, to adhere to service limits, to organize communication between maintenance and production staff, etc. To ensure safe operation of distillation columns the basic requirements of fire safety should be met: 1. special instruction for the starting and stopping process must be made; 2. regular instructions for the operating personal must be made; 3. all devices and equipment must be in good condition; 4. columns must be equipped with automatic regulation and control devices, as well as alarm signal system informing about dangerous deviations of parameters that define the explosion process; 5. laboratory monitoring should be carried out at the intervals specified in the instructions in case of lack of stationary devices; 6. columns installed outdoors, must be equipped with firefighting systems; 7. columns, pipelines, drain lines and other facilities installed outdoors, must be equipped with insulation. Thermal insulation must be clean, undamaged and designed so that all leaks could be visible (in order not to allow hidden leakages on the column); 8. maintenance work in the column can be made only after complete removal of the product and steam blowing of the equipment; 9. after washing and steaming of the column total removal of water and condensate must be made; 10. steaming system should be equipped with device, which removes the condensate formed in the steam line, and a check valve to avoid working mixture getting into the steaming system. More detailed recommendations and detailed risk assessment can be made during the production design stage."
4,Conclusion,"The basic quality requirements for high-concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions used as rocket propellant were analyzed. It was determined that besides controlling the amount of stabilizers and corrosion inhibitors, amount of organic impurities in hydrogen peroxide solutions must also be limited. The main methods of purification of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions produced by isopropyl alcohol oxidation were considered. The most promising and appropriate method of four stage rectification was chosen for further study. The main hazards of the purification process of hydrogen peroxide solutions by four stage rectification were reviewed and analyzed. The basic safety recommendations for this process were considered."
