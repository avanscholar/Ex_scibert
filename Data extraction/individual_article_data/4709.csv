0,Introduction,"In the past few years, the shortage of fossil fuels has been attracted many researchers’ attention. The finite sources of fossil fuels are not sufficient to sustain the increasing rate of world consumption [1,2]. In addition, the burning of fossil fuels also causes serious air pollution [3]. Identifying alternative source is a popular option to solve this problem. Biodiesel, composed of fatty acid methanol esters (FAMEs), is generally produced from oil (vegetable oils, animal fats, algae oil, or even recycled restaurant grease) and methanol by transesterification in the presence of suitable catalysts [4]. As a renewable and environment-friendly green fuel, biodiesel is known to be one of the most promising alternative fuels due to its renewability, biodegradability, low emissions of SO2, CO and particulate matters, and higher cetane number as compared with petroleum based diesel [5]. Despite many obvious advantages mentioned above, the biodiesel does have some drawbacks related to its properties especially oxidative stability and cold flow property. Polyunsaturated FAMEs are generated directly from the unsaturated fatty acid composite of the feedstock during the production of biodiesel. If the biodiesel contains a higher content of polyunsaturated FAMEs, lower oxidative stability of biodiesel is exhibited, which makes biodiesel difficult to store and consequently influences the overall quality of biodiesel [6,7]. Besides, the high amount of saturated FAMEs exhibits a negative effect on the cold flow property of biodiesel, leading to the fuel blockage in the fuel systems of vehicles [8]. Many researchers suggested that monounsaturated FAMEs are the ideal compositions of biodiesel in terms of the above fuel properties [9–11]. Hence, to upgrade biodiesel quality, partial hydrogenation is practically employed to transform polyunsaturated FAMEs into monounsaturated FAMEs using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source. Numwong et al. reported the partial hydrogenation to upgrade biodiesel by Pd/activity carbon catalyst [6]. Thunyaratchatanon et al. also studied the catalytic upgrading biodiesel by partial hydrogenation using Pd catalyst [12]. Even though the conventional process of partial hydrogenation by using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source is effective, this process for catalytic upgrading biodiesel is relatively complicated, due to the explosive nature of hydrogen gas and the strict conditions such as high temperature and high pressure. Compared with the conventional hydrogenation, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a safe, simple and eco-friendly method in which hydrogen gas is replaced by a hydrogen donor. Normally, unlike dangerous hydrogen source of pure hydrogen gas under high pressure, hydrogen donors used in CTH are normally easy to store, handle, and transport. The commonly used hydrogen donors are cyclohexene, formic acid, sodium formate, ammonium formate, and alcohols. Due to the low cost, alcohols have been an appropriate hydrogen donors among them. It is well established that when used as hydrogen donors, secondary alcohols have higher activity than primary alcohols. For example, Bui et al. found that the production of γ-valerolactone from furfural was enhanced using secondary alcohols as hydrogen donors, rather than primary alcohols [13]. Moreover, tertiary alcohols without α-hydrogen atoms cannot be used as hydrogen donors [14]. Some researchers have been studied CTH using noble metal as catalyst. Tike et al. reported the CTH of soybean oil using ammonium formate as donor over 5% Pd/C catalyst [15]. The study of Zhang et al. also showed that Pd supported on activated carbon exhibited high activity for the CTH of phenol [16]. Šmidovnik et al. studied the CTH of soybean oil in water using Pd/C as catalyst and sodium formate as hydrogen donor [17]. Although the noble metals as catalysts are very active in CTH, the CTH process typically requires high temperature and long reaction time. Thus, utilizing some process intensifications to make the hydrogenation efficient is necessary. Sonam et al. [18] reported the intensification of CTH by the ultrasound approach using Pd/C as catalyst. They demonstrated that the process of CTH assisted by ultrasound exhibited excellent benefits in terms of short reaction time and low temperature. As mentioned above, there are lots of reports on the CTH catalyzed by noble metals, even in the process with intensification approach [19–22]. However, it should be noted that noble metals as catalysts used in CTH are extremely expensive. Due to the low cost, Raney-Ni has been widely used as an alternative catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction [23–25]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore an effective process of intensification of CTH to upgrade the biodiesel quality using Raney-Ni as catalyst. It has been proved that microwave irradiation, as one kind of clean, fast and convenient energy sources, can accelerate the process and even increase the selectivity of some reactions. Lin et al. reported that with the ionic liquid catalyst for transesterification, the microwave heating system offered a rapid route to Jatropha oil biodiesel production, and the microwave heating system was also more energy-efficient and more cost-effective than the conventional heating system [26]. Wei et al. reported the solid superacid-catalyzed hydroconversion of demineralized Shengli coal liquefaction residue (DMSCLR) under microwave irradiation, and the results showed that with the microwave, the hydrogenation of DMSCLR catalyzed by solid superacid was readily conducted [27]. However, very little information is available for the microwave-assisted CTH of biodiesel. Jatropha oil consists mainly of triglycerides of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, particularly with chain length over the range of C16–C18. Moreover, Jatropha oil is non-edible because of its toxicity. Compared with edible oils, Jatropha oil is a good choice as the alternative feedstock for edible oil to produce biodiesel [28,29]; however, its high contents of polyunsaturated FAMEs are the undesired compositions. Therefore, this study focused on the upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel by microwave-assisted CTH using water as solvent, isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen donor, and Raney-Ni as catalyst. The work dealt with an in depth study to understand the effects of operating parameters, including catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, isopropyl alcohol amount, water amount and stirring rate, on the compositions of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel. Moreover, the kinetic model and the selectivity of CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating have also been investigated systematically.

1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Jatropha oil (acid value: 14.85 mg KOH⋅g−1, saponification value: 164.90 mg KOH⋅g−1) was obtained from FMD Bio-Energy Ltd., Guangxi, China. Raney-Ni powder with particle size less than 0.1 mm was purchased from Raney metal technology Ltd., Jiangsu, China. The isopropyl alcohol, iodine monochloride, potassium iodide, and sodium thiosulphate were all analytical grade."
3,Synthesis of Jatropha oil biodiesel,"2.2 Synthesis of Jatropha oil biodiesel The synthesis method of Jatropha oil biodiesel had previously been developed in our laboratory [30]. 100 g of Jatropha oil and 29.27 g of methanol (9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio) were added to a 250-ml three-neck round bottom flask. Then, 1 g of H2SO4 (1 wt% of Jatropha oil) was added to the three-neck round bottom flask and reacted for 2 h under 65 °C. After the H2SO4-catalyzed esterification, the mixtures were washed several times by saturated sodium chloride solution, and then poured into a separatory funnel. The upper phase of oil product was collected for further NaOH-catalyzed transesterification. The obtained oil product (100 g) was added to a 250-ml three-neck round bottom flask which was kept at 65 °C. A solution of methanol and NaOH was prepared by using 19.51 g of methanol (6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio) and 1 g of NaOH (1 wt% of oil product). After the solution was added to the three-neck round bottom flask, the mixtures were stirred together for 30 min of transesterification. Afterwards, the mixtures were poured into a separatory funnel in order to separate the upper biodiesel phase and the lower glycerine phase. After the biodiesel phase was washed several times by saturated sodium chloride solution at 50 °C for removal of solvent, the biodiesel was kept in a plastic bottle containing Na2SO4 in order to absorb the remaining water. The compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were methyl hexadecanoate (C16:1), methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl linoleate (C18:2), cis-methyl oleate (c-C18:1), and methyl stearate (C18:0). However, the C16:1 composition only accounted for 0.85 wt% of the Jatropha oil biodiesel, which was approximately evaluated by the area percentage method [24,30] according to the GC–MS result of Jatropha oil biodiesel (provided in the Supporting Information (Fig. S)). Hence, the main compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel used in this work were C16:0, C18:2, c-C18:1, and C18:0."
4,Upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel by CTH under microwave heating,"2.3 Upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel by CTH under microwave heating The upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating was carried out in a 250-ml three-neck round bottom flask in a MCR-3 Microwave chemical reactor (Shijishuangke experimental instrument co., Led, Zhengzhou, China) equipped with a temperature sensor and a motor-driven Teflon stirring rod. 7 g of Jatropha oil biodiesel, a certain amount of isopropyl alcohol, and a certain amount of water were mixed in the three-neck round bottom flask, and then Raney-Ni catalyst was added to the three-neck round bottom flask. The flask was placed in the Microwave chemical reactor, and then the upgrading reaction was operated at different conditions. CTH reactions of Jatropha oil biodiesel under different conditions, including catalyst dosage (6–14 wt% of biodiesel), reaction temperature (70–90 °C), isopropyl alcohol amount (16–48 g), water amount (60–140 g) and stirring rate (200–600 rpm), were performed. After reaction, the withdrawn samples containing oil phase (which included the catalyst) was firstly separated from the aqueous phase. And then, after centrifuging of oil phase to remove the catalyst, the tiny amounts of water and isopropyl alcohol in the oil sample were evaporated at 105 °C for 3 h. Finally, the upgraded biodiesel sample was obtained to be analyzed. In our work, each experiment of the upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel was done in duplicate or in triplicate."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The biodiesel samples were analyzed by Wijs method to gain the iodine value (IV, g indine/100 g oil) [31], which determines the degree of unsaturation of a material. Both the compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel and the compositions of upgraded biodiesels (i.e. partially hydrogenated biodiesels) were identified and determined with a 1690A gas chromatography (GC) (Kexiao experimental instrument co., Led, Hangzhou, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an AT.SE-30 (30 m × 320 μm × 0.5 μm) capillary column. The injector ports and the detector of GC were held at 260 °C. The oven temperature of GC was initially set at 60 °C. After an isothermal period of 3 min, the oven temperature was increased to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and then held for 5 min. Finally, the oven temperature was increased to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and further held for 25 min. The injection volume of sample was 0.2 μl. The compositions of FAMEs were identified with reference to the retention time of their peaks, and the content of each composition was calculated by the corrected area normalization method. In the work, all the biodiesel samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the average value was used as the final data (the experimental standard deviation was less than 5%). Moreover, for a thorough understanding of the components in upgraded biodiesel obtained at optimum conditions, the compositions of the upgraded biodiesel were also identified by GC–MS (Agilent 7890A/5975C) using a HP-5 (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm) capillary column. The GC–MS analysis was performed with an oven temperature program from 80 °C (holding for 2 min) to 300 °C at 10 °C/min (holding for 8 min)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Analysis of Jatropha oil biodiesel,"3.1 Analysis of Jatropha oil biodiesel The IV of Jatropha oil biodiesel was determinated by the Wijs method, and the result showed the IV of Jatropha oil biodiesel was ca. 97.08. Moreover, the main compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel were analyzed by GC. The compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel and their contents are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the Jatropha oil biodiesel consisted mainly of saturated and unsaturated FAMEs with chain length of C16 and C18. The compositions in the C16-C18 FAMEs were C16:0 (12.10 wt%), C18:2 (30.53 wt%), c-C18:1 (51.40 wt%), and C18:0 (6.06 wt%). The high content of polyunsaturated FAMEs in Jatropha oil biodiesel, i.e., C18:2, was the major cause of low oxidative stability of Jatropha oil biodiesel [32]. The saturated FAMEs of C16:0 and C18:0 with their high melting points, which were 30 °C and 39 °C respectively, directly affected the cold flow property of Jatropha oil biodiesel because of the high viscosity and gumming effect of saturated FAMEs at high temperature. Therefore, there should be only small amounts of saturated FAMEs in biodiesel in order to maintain both the oxidative stability and the cold flow property of Jatropha oil biodiesel. However, it was important to point out that, since the unsaturated FAMEs in Jatropha oil biodiesel were mainly compositions with a chain length of C18, the hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel must mainly involve the C18 compositions. Therefore, the catalytic upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel by partial hydrogenation in this work should focus on decreasing the content of C18:2 and controlling the content of C18:0. Besides the mass percentage of composition, the mass conversion ratio of C18:2 (CR C182, wt%) was used to evaluate the content decrease of C18:2. In this work, CR C182 was defined as the mass ratio of hydrogenated C18:2 to the total C18:2 in the original Jatropha oil biodiesel. Moreover, the mass ratio of generated C18:0 to total C18:0 in the upgraded biodiesel (R C180, wt%) was also used to analyze the content change of C18:0."
8,Effect of catalyst dosage on CTH,"3.2 Effect of catalyst dosage on CTH Normally, catalyst dosage is one of important process parameters in CTH [15,18]. The effect of catalyst dosage on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was investigated under the condition as follows: reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 32 g, water amount 100 g, stirring rate 400 rpm, and reaction time 30 min. The results are presented in Fig. 1 a and b. As shown in Fig. 1, the catalyst dosage had a significant effect on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel. With the catalyst dosage increase from 6 wt% to 10 wt%, the content of C18:2 composition in the C18 FAMEs obviously decreased. When the catalyst dosage was 10 wt%, the content of C18:2 decreased from 30.53 wt% of Jatropha oil biodiesel to 0.85 wt%, and correspondingly the conversion ratio of C18:2 reached 97 wt% at the catalyst dosage of 10 wt%. However, with the catalyst dosage further increase (>10 wt%), the content of C18:2 composition in the C18 FAMEs showed a slight increase. Compared with the content of C18:2 composition of 0.85 wt% at the catalyst dosage of 10 wt%, the content of C18:2 composition increased to 2.87 wt% at the catalyst dosage of 14 wt%. As for the compositions of c-C18:1 and C18:0, both the contents of them almost remained unchanged at the catalyst dosages of 6 wt% and 8 wt%, compared with the contents of initial composition of Jatropha oil biodiesel (as listed in Table 1). However, when the catalyst dosage was over 8 wt%, with the increase of the catalyst dosage, the content of c-C18:1 obviously decreased, and the content of C18:0 obviously increased. At the catalyst dosage of 14 wt%, the content of c-C18:1 decreased to 15.58 wt%, and the content of C18:0 increased to 21.28 wt%. Correspondingly, with the increase of catalyst dosage from 8 wt% to 14 wt%, the content of tran-methyloleate (t-C18:1) also showed an obvious increase. Besides, as shown in Fig. 1b, the IV was gradually decreased with the increase of catalyst dosage, indicating that the unsaturation degree of upgraded biodiesel increased. Even though the unsaturation of upgraded biodiesel was gradually hydrogenated with the increase of catalyst dosage, the results from this work suggested that at a higher catalyst dosage, the higher amounts of t-C18:1 and C18:0 were produced. This was due to the transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 and the deep hydrogenation of methyl oleate (C18:1, including c-C18:1 and t-C18:1) to C18:0 under the condition of high catalyst dosage. However, it should be noted that besides avoiding the generation of C18:0, the transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 also should be controlled in the CTH of biodiesel, since the melting point of t-C18:1 (10 °C) is much higher than that of c-C18:1 (−19.9 °C) [33]. Hence, in order to obtain high hydrogenation of C18:2 and, meanwhile, inhibit the transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 and the deep hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0, 8 wt% was chosen as the optimum condition of catalyst dosage for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
9,Effect of reaction temperature on CTH,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature on CTH In order to investigate the effect of reaction temperature on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel, the catalytic upgrading experiments were carried out at different reaction temperatures under the condition as follows: catalyst dosage 8 wt%, isopropyl alcohol amount 32 g, water amount 100 g, stirring rate 400 rpm, and reaction time 30 min. The results are presented in Fig. 2 a and b. With the increase of reaction temperature, the content of C18:2 decreased, while the content of t-C18:1 gradually increased. However, with the temperature increase from 70 °C to 90 °C, only small increases were observed both in the content of c-C18:1 and in the content of C18:0, as shown in Fig. 2a. Moreover, it was observed that as temperature increased from 70 °C to 90 °C, the IV of upgraded biodiesel decreased from 83.47 to 67.56. As shown in Fig. 2b, it was also found that the high reaction temperature enhanced the conversion of C18:2 and the generation of C18:0. The effects of temperature on the reaction efficiency and the cis-trans selectivity were reported by many researchers, and most of hydrogenation reactions could be accelerated by increasing the temperature [5,34–36]. In addition, the high selectivity toward trans-isomer was observed at high temperature, since trans-isomer has a more thermodynamically favored configuration than cis-isomer [37,38]. Based on the results of reaction temperature effect, it could be safely concluded that for the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel heated by microwave, high hydrogenation activity and comparatively low trans selectivity were simultaneously obtained at reaction temperature of 85 °C. Therefore, 85 °C was chosen as the optimum condition of reaction temperature for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
10,Effect of isopropyl alcohol amount on CTH,"3.4 Effect of isopropyl alcohol amount on CTH The isopropyl alcohol was used as the hydrogen donor in the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel. The effect of isopropyl alcohol amount, varying from 16 to 48 g, on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was investigated under the conditions of catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, water amount 100 g, stirring rate 400 rpm and reaction time 30 min. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the content of C18:2 gradually decreased with the increase of isopropyl alcohol amount. However, it could be observed that there was a distinct decrease of C18:2 content in the range of isopropyl alcohol amount from 16 to 24 g, and a slight decrease of C18:2 content in the range of isopropyl alcohol amount from 24 to 48 g. As shown in Fig. 3b, the IV of upgraded biodiesel quickly decreased with the increase of isopropyl alcohol amount from 16 to 48 g. When the isopropyl alcohol amount was 24 g, the IV decreased to 72.71 and then remained unchanged with the further increase of isopropyl alcohol amount. The solubility of isopropyl alcohol in water decides the availability of hydrogen donor taking part in the reaction [18]. With the increase of isopropyl alcohol amount from 16 to 24 g, more hydrogen donors of isopropyl alcohol took part in the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel, resulting in the decreases of C18:2 content and IV for upgraded biodiesel. However, during hydrogenation reaction, the isopropyl alcohol on active sites of Raney-Ni must be balanced against the competition for those sites from solvent, from oil and from reaction products [14,39–40]. Hence, in the range of high amount of isopropyl alcohol (>24 g), CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel changed slowly, and both the varied ranges of C18:2 content and IV were very small. At the isopropyl alcohol amount of 24 g, the CR C182 and the R C180 were 80.9 wt% and 23.0 wt%, respectively. It should be noted that at the isopropyl alcohol amount of 24 g, the content of c-C18:1 in the upgraded biodiesel was 50.57 wt%. As the initial content of c-C18:1 in Jatropha oil biodiesel was 51.40 wt%, it could be safely concluded that there was almost no transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 in the range of isopropyl alcohol amount of less than or equal to 24 g. And at the isopropyl alcohol amount of 24 g, the composition of C18:2 in Jatropha oil biodiesel was effectively changed into the composition of C18:1 (mainly t-C18:1), while only little amount of C18:0 was generated at this dosage of isopropyl alcohol. Hence, 24 g of isopropyl alcohol amount was used in all subsequent experiments."
11,Effect of water amount on CTH,"3.5 Effect of water amount on CTH Under the conditions of catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, stirring rate 400 rpm and reaction time 30 min, the effect of water amount on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was studied. The results are presented in Fig. 4 a and b. The conversion ratios of C18:2 in the range of water amount from 60 to 100 g were above 80 wt%, and showed a slight decrease with the increase of water amount. However, when the water amount was over 100 g, the conversion ratio of C18:2 showed a dramatic decline. For example, the conversion ratio of C18:2 at water amount of 120 g was only 62.6%. Compared with the low IV of upgraded biodiesel at water amount of 60 g or 80 g (almost the same IV for the two water amounts), the IV obviously increased when the water amount was over 80 g. The results mentioned above indicated that the hydrogenation of unsaturated compositions in Jatropha oil biodiesel, especially the hydrogenation of C18:2, became weakened at high amount of water added. Water is non-toxic, non-inflammable, inexpensive and abundantly available. As a green solvent, water can replace conventional, environmentally less desirable solvents. Moreover, water is considered a good microwave absorbing solvent and can be used in microwave-assisted organic synthesis [40–43]. By forming a thin film of isopropyl alcohol solution on the surface of the catalyst, water could serve as a medium for the contact of hydrogen donor of isopropyl alcohol with the metal catalyst of Raney-Ni and the substrate in Jatropha oil biodiesel (C18:2, C18:1) [18]. Hence, with appropriate water amount, the hydrogenation of unsaturated compositions in Jatropha oil biodiesel could proceed smoothly. However, excess water would compete with isopropyl alcohol for the active sites on the catalyst surface which resulted in a low availability of donors on the catalyst surface [18]. Furthermore, the dilution of isopropyl alcohol at high amount of water must happened. For the reasons mentioned above, a low efficiency of CTH would take place at high water amount. It should be noted that, compared with the R C180 of 27.5 wt% at the water amount of 60 g, the R C180 at the water amount of 80 g showed a slight decrease (24.5 wt%). Based on the analysis of effect of water amount on the CTH, 80 g was chosen as the optimum condition of water amount for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
12,Effect of stirring rate on CTH,"3.6 Effect of stirring rate on CTH The effect of stirring rate on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was investigated under the condition as follows: catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water amount 80 g, and reaction time 30 min. The results are presented in Fig. 5 a and b. At the stirring rate of 400 rpm, the content of C18:2 in upgraded biodiesel was the minimum of ca. 6 wt%. Correspondingly, the conversion ratio of C18:2 at the stirring rate of 400 rpm reached the maximum. Besides, the IV gradually decreased with the increase of stirring rate from 200 rpm to 400 rpm, and then remained almost unchanged with the further increase of stirring rate. It was shown that the hydrogenation of unsaturated FAMEs under microwave heating gradually increased due to the enhanced diffusion of liquid reactant with the increase of stirring rate. However, when the stirring rate was over 400 rpm, the influence from external diffusion could be completely eliminated by the stirring rate so that the IV remained almost unchanged. In conclusion, the unsaturation degree of upgraded biodiesel decreased with the increase of stirring rate and almost reached the equilibrium at the stirring rate of 400 rpm. Moreover, the content of t-C18:2 and the content of C18:0 in the upgraded biodiesel obtained at the stirring rate of 400 rpm were 24.62 wt% and 7.68 wt%, respectively. Hence, to obtain the high efficiency of CTH and the upgraded biodiesel with excellent compositions, the optimum condition of stirring rate was chosen as 400 rpm for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
13,Kinetic model and selectivity of CTH under microwave heating,"3.7 Kinetic model and selectivity of CTH under microwave heating 3.7.1 Kinetic model of CTH under microwave heating The CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel via the method of microwave heating at different reaction temperature was carried out under catalyst dosage 8 wt%, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water amount 80 g, and stirring rate 400 rpm. The changes of IV and compositions of upgraded biodiesel with the reaction time are presented in Fig. 6 a–e. For a better insight into the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel, kinetics of CTH under microwave heating should be investigated. In view of changes both in IV and in compositions of upgraded biodiesel with the reaction time, attempts were made to develop kinetic rate expressions with respect to IV and compositions of upgraded biodiesel. It is well known that the saturation of double bonds follows a first order simple kinetics [15]. Thus, for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel, the equation of reaction rate in terms of IV can be expressed as: (1) d ( IV ) dt = - k IV ( IV ) The values of k IV at different temperatures (65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 °C) were evaluated using the integral method. The obtained values of k IV and their different correlation coefficients (R 2) are shown in Table 2 . Moreover, from the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant (as shown in Fig. 6), the energy of activation was found to be 83.3 kJ/mol. The CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel is a complex chemical reaction involving isomerization and hydroisomerization [15,40]. During the hydrogenation reaction, FAMEs reacted with hydrogen donors on the active sites of catalyst surface where polyunsaturated FAMEs were gradually converted to high saturated FAMEs. For a kinetic description, the reaction of CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel can be represented as a series reaction as follows: (2) C 18 : 2 → k 1 C 18 : 1 → k 2 C 18 : 0 To illustrate the procedure describing the overall hydrogenation pseudo-kinetics, all reactions were considered to be irreversible and first order with respect to substrate [15]. Moreover, the hydrogen donor was in excess of stoichiometric quantity required in reactions. Thus, the concentration of isopropyl alcohol could be considered to be constant over the duration of CTH process. With these simplification and assumptions mentioned above, the equations of reaction rate in terms of FAMEs content can be expressed by Eqs. (3)–(5): (3) dc 1 d t = - k 1 c 1 (4) dc 2 d t = - k 2 c 2 + k 1 c 1 (5) dc 3 d t = k 2 c 2 where c 1, c 2 and c 3 represents the contents of C18:2, C18:1 and C18:0, respectively. From the above equations, the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 under different temperature were calculated using the initial contents of C18 FAMEs (t = 0) and the contents of C18 FAMEs at reaction time of 50 min. The rate parameters obtained are listed in Table 2. The results of rate constants showed that the rate of C18:1 hydrogenation was much slower than that of C18:2 hydrogenation. Moreover, from the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant (as shown in Fig. 7 ), the energy of activation was found to be 115.7 kJ/mol for C18:2 hydrogenation and 91.9 kJ/mol for C18:1 hydrogenation, respectively. In order to verify the accuracy of the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2, which was obtained using the initial contents of C18 FAMEs and the contents of C18 FAMEs at reaction time of 50 min, the change of composite of upgraded biodiesel with the reaction time was firstly predicted using obtained k 1 and k 2 through Eqs. (3)–(5), and then a validation was performed by fitting the predicted content of composition with the experimental content obtained in the present work. The results of the experimental contents along with the profiles of predicted contents of C18 FAMEs are shown in Fig. 8 . The residual sum of square (RSS) represents the sums of the squares of the difference between the experimental data and the predicted data. The RSS of rate parameters at different temperature are given in Table 2. From the fitting results (Fig. 8) and the RSS results, there was good agreement between the experimental contents and the predicted contents of composition of C18 FAMEs. Hence, it was safely concluded that the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under different temperature could be well described by the obtained kinetic model. 3.7.2 Comparison of CTH under microwave heating with that under conventional heating The optimum conditions for the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel heated by the microwave approach were summarized as follows: catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water amount 80 g, and stirring rate 400 rpm. For a comparison of CTH under microwave heating, the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel heated by the conventional approach was carried out under the optimum conditions as the CTH under microwave heating. The changes of IV and compositions of upgraded biodiesel with the reaction time are presented in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9, under the conventional heating, the C18:2 content in upgraded biodiesel only decreased to 23.13 wt% at reaction time of 10 min, and even at reaction time of 50 min the C18:2 content only reached 15.25 wt%. A slight decrease of IV was observed, which was from 97.08 of Jatropha oil biodiesel to 88.22 for upgraded biodiesel obtained at reaction time of 50 min. However, under the microwave heating (as shown in Fig. 6e), the C18:2 content in upgraded biodiesel quickly decreased to 18.32 wt% at reaction time of 10 min, and finally reached 2.45 wt% at reaction time of 50 min. Furthermore, the IV of the upgraded biodiesel decreased to 70.21 at reaction of 50 min, which was much less than the value of upgraded biodiesel obtained at the same reaction time under the conventional heating. 3.7.3 Selectivity of CTH under microwave heating and compositions of upgraded biodiesel In the reaction of CTH, the hydrogenation selectivity is also important. A well-known and accepted method to determine the selectivity is using the ratio of reaction rate constants [44]. For an appropriate hydrogenation toward desired upgraded biodiesel, the C18:1 selectivity was calculated according to Eq. (6) to evaluate the selectivity of CTH under microwave heating. (6) S = k 1 k 2 where S represents the C18:1 selectivity. High value of S means the rate of hydrogenation of C18:2 to C18:1 is greater than the rate of hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0. The C18:1 selectivity of CTH at different temperature under the microwave heating is listed in Table 2. Furthermore, the rate parameters and the C18:1 selectivity of CTH at 85 °C under the conventional heating, which was the controlled experiment of conventional heating as described in Section 3.7.2, were also calculated according to Eq. (6). The calculated parameters for the controlled experiment are presented in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the C18:1 selectivity of CTH under microwave heating increased with the increase of reaction temperature. Moreover, it was clearly seen that the C18:1 selectivity of CTH heated by the microwave, even the C18:1 selectivity at the low temperature of 65 °C (i.e., 37.7 as listed in Table 2), was extremely higher than that of CTH heated by the conventional approach (i.e., 17.4 (at 85 °C) as listed in Table 2). The results indicated that CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel by microwave approach had a significant advantage for the high C18:1 selectivity, namely a remarkable hydrogenation of C18:2 to C18:1 and, meanwhile, almost no further hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0 under microwave heating. Hence, a high quality upgraded biodiesel could be effectively obtained in less time by microwave heating. To analyze the compositions of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel prepared by microwave heating, the upgraded biodiesel was sampled at reaction time of 50 min from the hydrogenation system under catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water amount 100 g, and stirring rate 400 rpm. The compositions of upgraded biodiesel were identified by GC–MS. The GC–MS profile is shown in Fig. 10 . The information, i.e., retention time and similarity of composition, obtained from GC–MS analysis is listed in Table 3 . From the results of GC–MS, it could be clearly seen that the main compositions of upgraded biodiesel were C16:0, C18:2, c-C18:1, t-C18:1 and C18:0. Different from the compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel (as presented in Table 1), new composition of t-C18:1 was found in the upgraded biodiesel. Except for t-C18:1, others main compositions, including C16:0, C18:2, c-C18:1 and C18:0, all existed in the upgraded biodiesel and in the Jatropha oil biodiesel. The composition contents of upgraded biodiesel determined by GC are presented in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the content of C16:0 in the upgraded biodiesel (12.29 wt%) was almost equal to that in the Jatropha oil biodiesel (12.01 wt%), indicating that no hydrogenation happened in C16:0 composition for its saturation. Moreover, compared with the content of C18:0 in the Jatropha oil biodiesel (6.06 wt%), the content of C18:0 in the upgraded biodiesel only showed a slightly increase (8.56 wt%). Different from the high content of C18:2 in the Jatropha oil biodiesel (30.53 wt%), the content of C18:2 in the upgraded biodiesel drastically decreased to 2.45 wt%. Despite almost no change in the contents of c-C18:1 between the upgraded biodiesel and the Jatropha oil biodiesel, the new composition of t-C18:1 found in the upgraded biodiesel had a high content of 25.8 wt%. The changes in the compositions and their contents between Jatropha oil biodiesel and upgraded biodiesel indicated that high quality upgraded biodiesel with excellent compositions was successfully and effectively obtained under microwave heating. Through this heating method, even though the polyunsaturated C18:2 in the Jatropha oil biodiesel had almost completely changed into the monounsaturated C18:1 (mainly t-C18:1), the further hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0 was effectively avoided, and the transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 was also effectively controlled during CTH of biodiesel. Furthermore, in view of the high reaction rate of CTH by the microwave approach, it was clear that the microwave had an intensification effect on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
14,Conclusions,"Under microwave heating, catalytic upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel was successfully performed by partial hydrogenation using Raney-Ni as catalyst and water as solvent. The optimum conditions for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating were as follows: catalyst dosage 8 wt%, reaction temperature 85 °C, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water amount 100 g, stirring rate 400 rpm. The CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating could be well described by pseudo-first order kinetic model. The activation energy for C18:2 hydrogenation and for C18:1 hydrogenation was 115.7 kJ/mol and 91.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Different from the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under conventional heating, the CTH under microwave heating proceeded quickly, and had a significant advantage for the high C18:1 selectivity. Under microwave heating, the polyunsaturated C18:2 in the Jatropha oil biodiesel effectively changed into the monounsaturated C18:1 (mainly t-C18:1) during CTH of biodiesel; meanwhile, the generation of C18:0 was effectively avoided, and the transformation of c-C18:1 to t-C18:1 was also effectively controlled. Overall, the work demonstrated the partial hydrogenation through CTH using microwave energy as heating source, Raney-Ni as catalyst and water as solvent was an effective approach for the catalytic upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel."
