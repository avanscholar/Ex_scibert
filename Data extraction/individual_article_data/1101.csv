0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols is of great relevance, both from industrial and academic point of view, due to the importance of the allylic alcohols in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries [1–4]. α,β-Unsaturated aldehydes contain, on their structure, two functionalities that can be hydrogenated—an olefinic CC bond, whose hydrogenation leads to the saturated aldehydes, and a carbonyl group, reduction of which results in unsaturated alcohols. Although extensively studied, the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes remains a challenging task [2,5–7]. Reduction of the CC double bond is thermodynamically more favourable, and hence the selective hydrogenation of the CO group to achieve the corresponding unsaturated alcohol with high yield is quite demanding [2,8]. Selective reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with high yield of the unsaturated alcohol can be achieved using stoichiometric amounts of reducing agents like metal hydrides, aluminium isopropoxide, etc. [3,4]. The main disadvantage of such processes is that they involve costly chemicals and large amounts of wastes. A feasible alternative is based on the use of heterogeneous catalysts which are environmentally friendlier, easier to separate and can be re-usable. The need for an alternative heterogeneous catalytic process is indeed reflected by the numerous studies available in the literature over this subject [2,3,5–7]. The rational design of active and selective heterogeneous metal supported catalysts for the reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is not an easy task. There are several factors that can affect the activity and selectivity, namely, the reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase system), metal and support nature, metal precursors, use of promoters, catalyst preparation and activation procedure, etc. [3,9]. In order to rationalise the catalyst preparation and to be able to achieve high production capacities with high selectivity, the study of the catalyst is crucial to correlate its performance with the corresponding properties, and to understand all the phenomena involved. This is however quite a demanding task due to the complexity of the system, involving a rather complicated reaction mechanism, including competitive/non-competitive and dissociative/non-dissociative adsorption, side reaction, adsorption of solvents, etc. [3,7,10]. Cinnamaldehyde (CMD) is an example of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes widely studied as model substrate [3]. The corresponding semi-hydrogenated product, cinnamyl alcohol (CML), is itself a valuable product used in fine chemical industries. Also, it can be used as an intermediate in organic synthesis [1,4]. Although, as a general rule, it is known that the electronic and stereo-hindrances predominate, the key factors that control the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of CMD are still unclear [2,3,5,6]. The existence of Lewis acid sites and electron deficient centres on the catalyst surface has been found to promote the formation of the unsaturated alcohol because they provide suitable adsorption sites for the carbonyl group [2,11]. Again, an increase in electron density in the active metal centres decreases the probability of CC bond activation, consequently decreases the selectivity to CC hydrogenation products [12]. On the other hand, in addition to the CC double bond and carbonyl group, the molecule of CMD contains a bulky phenyl group, which can have a considerable steric influence on the yield of the different reaction products. Indeed, it is well established that the selectivity in CML increases with increasing metal particle size and this behaviour is ascribed to steric repulsion between the large metal particle and the phenyl group which prevents the approach of the CC double bond to the surface of metal particles, instead facilitates adsorption of CMD in an end-on form [2,13]. In general this trend is more pronounced for particles larger than 2–3nm [14–16]. Carbon materials are widely used as supports in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for liquid phase reactions. Compared to conventional inorganic supports, such as silica or alumina, carbon materials present several advantages, namely, higher stability in both acidic and basic media, an easily tuneable surface chemistry and a well developed porosity. Moreover, when precious metals are used, especially at high loads, a very important issue from the economic point of view is the metal recovery from the spent catalysts. Use of carbon supports makes this quite simple, because the spent catalyst can be burnt off, and the resulting highly concentrated ashes make the recovery of precious metals economical. The process produces smaller amount of solid waste and hence it is effective from the ecological point of view also [17–19]. Recently, there is growing interest for polymer derived mesoporous carbon materials because they can be produced at relatively low cost, high yield and purity, with tailored surface chemistry and textural properties [20–26]. In addition, their open porous network makes mass transfer limitations less significant compared to the traditional microporous activated carbons [21,27]. Supported group VIII metals are commonly used in hydrogenation reactions. In the hydrogenation of CMD, Pd and Rh generally display high activities but rather poor selectivities towards CML, whereas Pt and Ru are the most commonly used metals, exhibiting moderate selectivities [2,3]. The selectivity to CML can be increased by modifying monometallic catalysts via addition of a second metal, which can either be a d-electron (e.g. Fe) or an electropositive p-electron (e.g. Sn) element [2,6]. In the present study, a mesoporous carbon was synthesised and used as catalyst support in the preparation of different Pt-based catalysts. Fe and Zn were used as promoters. Pt was used as active metal due to its better selectivity. The catalysts prepared have been evaluated in the liquid phase hydrogenation of CMD, and it has been observed that promotion of Pt by Fe and Zn improves the corresponding activity and induces a remarkable increase in the selectivity towards CML. All the catalysts tested were fully characterised in order to understand the catalytic behaviour and promoting effect."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of carbon support and catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of carbon support and catalysts The mesoporous carbon support was prepared by sol–gel condensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde and subsequent carbonisation of the dried gel. Detailed procedure is described elsewhere [25]. In brief, sol–gel processing was performed with a formaldehyde/resorcinol ratio of 1.85 at pH 6.0 (adjusted with dilute NaOH solution). Water was removed by drying in an air oven during a period of 7 days by step-wise increase of temperature from 60 to 150°C and subsequently the dried gel was carbonised at 800°C. Sodium was removed by washing several times with 7M HNO3, followed by distilled water (to remove HNO3) until the washings showed neutral pH. The sample was then dried at 110°C for 6h. Finally, the carbon sample was slowly heated to 800°C, held for 2h, and then cooled slowly to room temperature under nitrogen. In order to generate surface oxygen groups, the carbon material was subjected to activation by diluted oxygen flow (in nitrogen). A detailed procedure is described elsewhere [25]. In brief, the carbon material was activated under 5% O2 (in N2) at 440°C for 30h and thus the surface activated sample C-SA was obtained. The surface oxygen groups were expected to be the anchoring sites for the catalyst precursors. The unactivated carbon sample was designated as C-UA. Four catalysts, with different metal combinations—Pt/C-SA, PtFe/C-SA, PtZn/C-SA, and PtFeZn/C-SA, were then prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using C-SA as support. A fifth catalyst was prepared following the same method using unactivated carbon as support with tri-metallic formulation (PtFeZn/C-UA). In the case of bi- and tri-metallic catalysts, co-impregnation procedure was followed. H2PtCl6·6H2O, FeCl2·4H2O, and Zn(OOCCH3)2·2H2O were used as Pt, Fe and Zn precursors, respectively. The concentrations of the metal precursors in the impregnating solutions were calculated in order to obtain 5wt.% of Pt; 0.8wt.% of Fe; and 0.4wt.% of Zn over the support. A 50:50 (v/v) methanol–water mixture was used as impregnating solvent. Typically, 2g of support was added to the calculated amount of precursor(s) solution and stirred continuously for 6h, the solvent was then evaporated slowly and the catalyst was dried overnight at 110°C. The dried catalysts were calcined at 400°C for 4h under 3% O2 (in N2) flow, followed by reduction at 400°C for 4h under H2 flow. The reduced catalysts were stored under argon, and all the subsequent manipulations were carefully performed in order to minimise the contact with atmospheric air."
3,Characterisation of supports and catalysts,"2.2 Characterisation of supports and catalysts The supports and the supported catalysts were characterised by N2 sorption, temperature programmed desorption (TPD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and H2 chemisorption. Textural characterisation of the supports was based on the analysis of nitrogen sorption isotherms measured at 77K in a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX sorptometer. BET surface area (S BET), mesopore surface area (S meso) and micropore volume (V micro) were calculated using the t-method as described elsewhere [28]. Pore size distributions were obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method [29]. Surface oxygen groups in the supports and pre-reduced catalysts (reduction procedure described in Section 2.1) were characterised by TPD. The analyses were performed in an AMI-200 (Altamira Instruments) apparatus. In a typical experiment, 100mg sample was subjected to a 5°Cmin−1 linear temperature rise up to 1100°C under helium flow of 25cm3 min−1. A mass spectrometer (Dymaxion 200amu, Ametek) was used to monitor the desorbed CO (m/z =28) and CO2 (m/z =44) signals. TPR experiments were carried out in AMI-200 (Altamira Instruments) apparatus; 100mg sample was heated at 5°Cmin−1 up to 900°C under a flow of 5% (v/v) H2 diluted in He (total flow rate of 25cm3 min−1). The H2 consumption was followed by mass spectrometry (Dymaxion 200amu, Ametek) from the signal m/z =2; CH4, CO and CO2 were monitored through the signals m/z =15, m/z =28 and m/z =44, respectively. XPS analyses were performed on previously ex situ reduced catalysts (reduction procedure described in Section 2.1) with a VG Scientific ESCALAB 200A spectrometer using a non-monochromatised Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was always <1×10−7 Pa and charging effects were corrected using the C 1s level (285.0eV) as reference. To determine the oxidation state of platinum in the catalysts, deconvolution of Pt 4f spectra was carried out, assuming mixed Lorentzian-Gaussian functions, a Shirley background, fixed peak to peak distances and equal full-width at half heights. The surface concentration of the uppermost surface layers was calculated from the XPS peak areas of the Pt 4f7/2, C 1s, O 1s, Zn 2p3/2 and Fe 2p3/2 spectra, applying the appropriate sensitivity factors. The Pt dispersion was measured by pulse chemisorption of H2 at 30°C and atmospheric pressure, in an Altamira AMI-200 apparatus, assuming a stoichiometric ratio of H/Pt=1; 58μL doses of H2 were successively injected in the carrier gas ( 25 c m STP 3 / min of He), until the catalyst surface saturation was achieved. The H2 adsorption was followed on-line, by means of a thermal conductivity detector placed at the outlet of the catalyst bed (0.1g). The total amount of H2 chemisorbed was calculated by summing the differences between the volume of the H2 pulse and the amounts of H2 not adsorbed, obtained by integration of the areas of each H2 peak. Prior to chemisorption measurements, the samples were reduced in situ under H2 flow ( 25 c m STP 3 / min ) following the standard reduction temperature program (heating at 10°Cmin−1 up to 400°C and held at the final temperature for 4h), and then the hydrogen physisorbed was removed by flowing He ( 25 c m STP 3 / min ) at 400°C and atmospheric pressure for 2h. To determine the dispersion of Pt and the equivalent particle size in the bi- and tri-metallic catalysts, it was assumed that the H2 chemisorption on the Zn and Fe species was negligible under the experimental conditions, and that there was no significant change in the ratio between the mean volume ( v m ) and the mean area (a m) of the Pt atoms, in the bulk and surface of the catalytic particles, respectively. The average Pt particle size of the monometallic catalyst and the equivalent Pt particle size (d) of the bi- and tri-metallic catalysts were thus calculated using equation: (1) d ( nm ) = 6 ( v m / a m ) D = 1.122 D where D is the dispersion. We note, however, that in the case of alloys the v m / a m ratio may significantly change and hence the values obtained from Eq. (1) might not be accurate for the bi- and tri-metallic catalysts. For TEM analysis, reduced catalyst samples were ground and dispersed in ethanol; after sonication the suspensions thus obtained were deposited on a 400 mesh copper grid covered with a formvar film; the observations were then carried out in a LEO 906 microscope working at a 120kV accelerating voltage."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic hydrogenation tests were performed in a custom made stainless steel semi-batch 300mL reactor at 75°C and 16bar of H2, with continuous addition of hydrogen. The reactor consists of H2 inlet, substrate charging port – fitted with septa and two-way valve, thermo hole – deep into the bottom, and a sampling port—fitted with metallic frit and two-way valve. In a typical experiment, 0.3g catalyst (800–1200μm in diameter) and 100mL solvent (cyclohexane) were put into the reactor and purged 3–4 times with argon, followed by 3–4 times with H2. The temperature was then raised to 100°C, H2 pressure was adjusted to 5bar and the system was stirred for 5h. Thus the catalyst was reactivated in situ. Meanwhile, 2.1g CMD was dissolved in 100mL cyclohexane; argon was bubbled through for 30min to remove dissolved air, and kept under argon. After reactivation of the catalyst, temperature was brought down to 75°C (reaction temperature), and the solvent was removed through the sampling port. The air-free CMD solution was added into the reactor by means of a cannula, and the system was purged 3–4 times with H2 to remove the dissolved argon. Finally, the temperature and H2 pressure were readjusted to 75°C and 16bar, respectively, and the reaction started by starting stirring. Cyclohexane was used as solvent in order to avoid the formation of acetals, which are frequently observed when alcoholic solvents are used. Small amounts of liquid samples were collected periodically in order to determine CMD conversion and product selectivities. Quantitative analysis was performed with a DANI GC-1000 gas chromatograph, equipped with a WCOT Fused Silica column (CP-Sil 8 CB low bleed/MS, 30m, 0.32mm i.d., 1μm film thickness) and FID. CMD was received from Aldrich and used as such. Hydrogen was supplied by Airliquide."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Table 1 presents the characteristics of the carbon supports used. Total surface area, mesoporous area, and micropore volume increased considerably upon air activation. This is expected because formation of new pores and opening of otherwise inaccessible pores are possible during the activation. However, the important point is that both samples exhibit large mesoporous area with wide pore diameters. These characteristics are beneficial, particularly in the liquid phase reaction, as they minimise transport limitations. Also, there is a large increase in surface oxygen groups upon air activation. Fig. 1 shows representative TEM images of the tri-metallic catalysts (PtFeZn/C-SA and PtFeZn/C-UA), where the metal crystallites appear as dark dots on the surface of the carbon xerogel. The observations performed for the different samples revealed a uniform distribution of small particles. The equivalent and average particle sizes along with H2 chemisorptive properties and metal loadings of the catalysts are displayed in Table 2 . The equivalent particle sizes calculated from H2 chemisorption experiments were considerably higher than those determined by TEM analysis; only for the monometallic catalyst (Pt/C-SA) there was a good agreement between the values deduced from the two techniques. The amount of H2 chemisorbed strongly decreased by the presence of a second metal, resulting in a significant reduction of H/Pt ratios. It decreased from 0.57 in the monometallic catalyst to 0.25 and 0.30 in the bi-metallic, PtFe and PtZn, catalysts, respectively. The presence of a third metal induced a further decrease in the H/Pt ratio to a value as low as 0.06. This decrease in H2 uptake upon the addition of Fe and/or Zn to the Pt catalyst does not reflect a decrease of the metals dispersion, since TEM analyses revealed a similar particle size distribution for the catalysts prepared over the same support. The effect of Fe and Zn addition to the Pt catalyst on the corresponding H2 uptake might have resulted from either alloy formation [12,30–35] and/or a decrease in the accessibility of Pt, due to the development of some kind of shell of Zn and Fe species covering the Pt surface. It is also possible that the interaction of the promoters with Pt alters its chemisorption behaviour. In order to analyse the effect of the surface oxygen groups in the catalyst performance, the tri-metallic formulation (5% Pt, 0.8% Fe and 0.4% Zn) was prepared over an unactivated carbon support (C-UA), possessing a lower amount of oxygen surface groups (PtFeZn/C-UA). Fig. 1 shows that there are some large particles in PtFeZn/C-UA, in addition to the very small and uniform particles; therefore the corresponding average particle size is slightly larger than that of PtFeZn/C-SA (Table 2). During the standard catalyst pre-treatments some sintering/agglomeration must have occurred for PtFeZn/C-UA, broadening the corresponding particle size distribution. The lower dispersion obtained for the catalyst prepared in the support with a lower concentration of surface oxygen groups, evidences the role of the carbon surface chemistry in the metal dispersion and corresponding stabilization. The surface oxygen groups seem to act as anchoring sites for the metal precursors and hinder its agglomeration, during catalyst pre-treatments. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles obtained for the catalysts and carbon support. Similar spectra were obtained for all the catalysts; broad H2 consumption profiles were observed between 150 and 900°C. The overall H2 consumption for the different catalysts, determined by integration of the TPR curves, was excessively large to be only due to the reduction of Pt. The H2 consumption peaks around 585 and 700°C, for the catalysts and support, respectively, were due to the gasification of the carbon support forming methane [36,37]. The reaction was catalysed by the supported metals and hence the corresponding H2 consumption peak shifted towards lower temperature. Beside support gasification, probably H2 spillover onto the support also took place over the catalysts since the amounts of H2 consumption for the catalysts were much higher than that for the support. During and after reduction, hydrogen is chemisorbed on Pt0 sites and then spilt onto the support, occupying the reactive sites formed upon the decomposition of surface oxygen groups [36]. This hypothesis is supported by the release of CO and CO2 which was observed in correspondence with the H2 consumption around 585°C. Due to support gasification and/or H2 spillover onto the support it was not possible to clearly identify the reduction peaks of the supported metals. However, a sharp H2 consumption peak was observed at 230°C with the PtFe/C-SA catalyst, not detected with any of the other samples. Due to this peak, the amount of hydrogen consumed by this catalyst was somewhat higher than that observed over the others. As the load of platinum in PtFe/C-SA is the same as in the other catalysts, for which a lower H2 consumption was measured, the sharp reduction peak centred at 230°C is probably associated to the joint reduction of Pt–Fe species, indicating a possible alloy formation [12,30–32]. However, the phenomenon was not observed with the tri-metallic catalyst; probably because of interference by Zn. A possible Pt–Zn alloy formation [33–35] might not have been detected due to the low load of Zn in the catalysts (0.4wt.%). XPS analyses were performed over the catalysts after performing the ex situ standard pre-treatments (calcination followed by reduction under H2 according to the procedure described in Section 2.1). Fig. 3 shows the curve fittings of Pt XPS 4f spectra and Table 3 lists the fraction of Pt in the different oxidation states (Pt0 and Pt2+), the corresponding binding energies (BEs) and calculated weight surface concentrations. Due to the low amount of Fe and Zn in the catalysts the corresponding XPS spectra were not well defined, and therefore no further mathematical treatment was carried out to determine the fraction of iron and zinc in the different oxidation states. In the case of iron it was not even possible to accurately measure its surface concentration from the respective spectra. From Fig. 3 and the binding energies listed in Table 3, it can be seen that the presence of Fe and/or Zn in the catalyst shifted the platinum binding energies towards lower values, revealing a possible electron transfer from the promoters to the platinum sites, which however seemed not to significantly affect the fraction of Pt0 in the samples (around 80%). Somewhat lower values of Pt0 (around 78%) in the Fe containing catalysts may be accounted for the formation of Pt–Fe phase evidenced by the TPR experiments (Fig. 2). For the monometallic Pt catalyst, Pt surface concentration (Pts Table 3) was found to be close to its nominal load (5wt.%), indicating a good dispersion throughout the external surface and inside the pore channels. On the contrary, Pts of the bi- and tri-metallic catalysts were significantly higher than the nominal Pt bulk concentration, indicating that the presence of promoters, Fe and/or Zn, led to the segregation of Pt onto the external surface. The Zn surface concentrations (Zns) were also considerably higher than the nominal Zn load, pointing to the concentration of this promoter on the external surface. Comparing the surface concentrations, Pts and Zns, between PtZn/C-SA and PtFeZn/C-SA (Table 3), it may be concluded that the presence of Fe in the tri-metallic formulation hindered the segregation of Pt and Zn on the catalyst surface, therefore promoting their distribution. However, an opposite trend in Pt dispersion has been observed by H2 chemisorption measurements; lower Pt dispersion in PtFeZn/C-SA than in PtZn/C-SA. The lower H2 chemisorption might have resulted from alloy formation (Pt–Fe and Pt–Zn [12,30–35]), and/or development of thin films of Fe and Zn species covering the Pt sites. Pt and Zn surface concentrations in PtFeZn/C-UA were found to be higher than those in PtFeZn/C-SA, confirming the role of the carbon surface chemistry in the distribution of the catalytic species. This result is in agreement with the H2 chemisorption measurements and TEM observations that revealed a decrease in Pt dispersion for the catalyst prepared over the carbon support with a lower amount of oxygen surface groups (Table 1). The lower oxygen content of the carbon support used in the PtFeZn/C-UA catalyst also resulted in a higher amount of Pt0 (84.3%) in comparison with the other catalysts prepared over the standard oxidised support (∼80%)."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde involves the parallel and consecutive reduction of different functional groups (CC and CO) present in the molecule. Under the reaction conditions applied, the products obtained were CML, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMD), and 3-phenyl propanol (PPL). No other side products were detected. Hence, the reaction pathways involved are believed to be those shown in Scheme 1 . Preliminary tests were carried out in order to check for the absence of any mass transfer limitations. External diffusion resistance was ruled out, since no significant variation in the catalytic results was observed by increasing the stirring rate. Pore diffusion limitations were also ruled out on the basis of experiments with smaller particle sizes (0.25–0.5mm), the corresponding conversions being within 4% of those recorded with the standard particle size (0.8–1.2mm). Additional confirmation was obtained by estimating the Weisz-Prater criterion: (2) Φ = r ν L 2 D e C s where r v is the observed reaction rate referred to the catalyst volume, L is the characteristic dimension (for spherical particles L = R /3, where R is the particle radius), D e is the effective diffusivity of the reactant and C s its surface concentration [38]. Considering the results obtained with the Pt catalyst, r v was obtained from Fig. 4(a), and R =0.05cm. The initial rate and concentration were used in the calculation. The diffusivity of the solute (D 1,2) was estimated from the correlation of Wilke and Chang for dilute solutions [39], and converted into an effective diffusivity by using the appropriate value of the porosity (ɛ =0.6). (3) D e = ε 2 D 1,2 Then, Φ ≈0.1 confirming that pore diffusion limitations are negligible. The comparative performances of the catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4. On the left side of the table are shown the product selectivities obtained for a CMD conversion level of 50%; while on the right side are listed the selectivities determined after a reaction time of 12h, by which period almost total CMD conversion was achieved over the most active catalyst formulations. The unpromoted catalyst, Pt/C-SA, showed poor performance in terms of both activity and product selectivity, yielding more or less equal amounts of the semi-hydrogenated products, CML and HCMD, along with a considerable amount of the fully hydrogenated product, PPL. Catalyst promotion with Fe and Zn has greatly improved both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards CML formation. Selectivity to CML was more or less independent of CMD conversion; a considerable decrease in the selectivity to CML was only observed for Pt/C-SA and PtFe/C-SA catalysts. The independence of selectivity with respect to the CMD conversion along with the low amounts of HCMD formed evidence the much higher activity towards CO bond hydrogenation than CC bond attack. Over the monometallic Pt catalyst 50% of CMD conversion was achieved after 800min of reaction, while the time required to reach that conversion level was decreased to 140 and 310min over the Fe and Zn promoted catalysts, respectively. In a similar way, after 12h of reaction only 45% of the CMD was converted over the unpromoted catalyst, whereas by that period 99 and 70% conversion of CMD has been achieved with the catalysts promoted by Fe and Zn, respectively. With respect to the amount of different products formed, both Fe and Zn largely enhanced the selectivity of CML, which was accompanied by a great decrease in the amount of HCMD, and a significant increase in PPL. It seems that the presence of Fe and Zn in the catalyst promotes the attack on the carbonyl group (reactions 1 and 3—Scheme 1). HCMD formed through reaction 2 was readily further hydrogenated to PPL, hence the amount of HCMD in the reaction mixture remained low and the selectivity of this product was below 10% over the promoted catalysts; even lower at higher conversion level. Comparing the product selectivities at 50% of CMD conversion with those obtained after 12h of reaction, we observe that while over PtZn/C-SA the product distribution remained roughly unchanged, over PtFe/C-SA the higher conversion was accompanied by a considerable decrease in the selectivity of CML and an increase in the amount of PPL. This behaviour is more clearly seen in Fig. 4, where the product distribution profiles are shown for the different catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the evolution in the amount of products with the olefinic bond hydrogenated (HCMD+PPL) and with the carbonyl group reduced (CML+PPL). Fe led to a greater improvement in terms of hydrogenation activity. However, not only the attack of the carbonyl group was promoted but also, although in a lesser extent, the activity towards the hydrogenation of the CC double bond. The amount of CML formed and the amount of unwanted products with the olefinic CC double bond hydrogenated (HCMD+PPL) were both considerably higher than those obtained over the unpromoted catalyst. Although the activity increase observed over the Zn promoted catalyst was somewhat lower than that obtained over the Fe promoted catalyst, the former was accompanied by the formation of a much lower amount of unwanted products, HCMD+PPL. In addition the selectivity to CML remained almost constant at high conversion levels (Table 4). Hence it seems that Fe is particularly efficient to improve the activity, whereas Zn is somewhat better in terms of selectivity. Two mechanisms may be invoked to explain the promoting effect of Fe and Zn in the performance of the Pt catalyst: (1) the electron transfer from Fe and Zn species to the Pt sites, evidenced in the XPS analyses; (2) creation of electrophilic or Lewis sites, suitable for CMD to be adsorbed through CO centre. The higher electron density on Pt, as a result of electron transfer from Fe and Zn, decreases the probability of the CC bond activation, via an increase in the repulsive four-electron interaction, and favours the backbonding interaction with the π CO * - orbital and thus the hydrogenation of the CO group. Theoretical studies carried out by Delbecq and Sautet have shown this effect on Pt80Fe20 model surface, where Fe atoms were not exposed to the reaction medium [12]. The Fe and Zn particles with a local positive charge in close contact with Pt particles act as electrophilic or Lewis sites for the adsorption and activation of the CO bond, via the lone pair of electrons in the oxygen atom (Scheme 2 ) [2,6,31,33–35]. Both mechanisms 1 and 2 suggest enhancement of CML selectivity, the first by inhibiting the activation of the CC bond, together with facilitating the activation of CO group, and the second one favouring the activation of the CO group. Although both may occur over the promoted catalysts, the second one seems to be predominating, since there was a large increase in the yield of the CO hydrogenated products (CML+PPL), while with exception of PtFeZn/C-UA, the yield of CC double bond hydrogenated products (HCMD+PPL) was higher than, or of the same order as that over the unpromoted catalyst. Comparing the amount of CML+PPL formed over the bimetallic catalysts (PtFe/C-SA and PtZn/C-SA in Fig. 5b), we observe that the activation of the CO group was particularly enhanced by the addition of Fe. On the other hand, Fig. 5a reveals that Zn is more efficient in inhibiting the attack on CC double bond. The greater hydrogenation activity presented by PtFe/C-SA may also result from the development of a new Pt–Fe phase, as evidenced in the TPR experiments. Although an increase in electron density over Pt was observed by XPS in all the promoted catalysts, the inhibition of CC bond attack was only significant over the Zn containing catalysts. This might be due to the higher Pt0/Pt2+ ratio observed (Table 3). It is also well established that the selectivity to CML increases with increasing metal particle size; the effect is particularly pronounced with particles larger than 2–3nm [14–16]. This trend can be ascribed to two factors. First, steric repulsion, between the bulky phenyl group and a large metal particle that hinders the parallel adsorption of CMD, and facilitates end-on adsorption. As the molecule is tilted away from the metal surface, the CC double bond is protected and hence the selectivity of CML is improved. Secondly, theoretical calculations [40] showed that for a certain metal the adsorption mode which determines the final selectivity depends on the corresponding crystal face exposed. For example, over Pt (111) CMD adsorption via CO is preferred, leading to the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, whereas on Pt (100) the attack on the CC and CO groups are equally probable. Since on large particles the faces preferentially exposed are those where CML adsorption via CO is favoured, the selectivity tends to increase with increasing particle size. When both the promoters, Fe and Zn, were coupled in the Pt catalyst (PtFeZn/C-SA), although there was a slight decrease in activity compared to PtFe/C-SA, remarkably higher selectivity of CML has been achieved. The lower activity of PtFeZn/C-SA compared to PtFe/C-SA might be due to the dilution of Pt and Fe by Zn, which is reflected by a lower amount of hydrogen chemisorbed (Table 2). The selectivity enhancement over the tri-metallic system is associated to the combined effect of Fe and Zn; a greater number of electrophilic sites for the activation of the carbonyl group and possibly a higher electron density in Pt particles inhibiting attack on CC double bond may be responsible. From the observations discussed above it seems that in the tri-metallic formulation Fe is required to promote the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, whereas Zn seems to improve the yield of CML. Contradictory reports are available in literature with respect to the influence of surface oxygen groups on the performance of carbon supported catalysts towards the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Some studies point to an increased selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol with increased concentration of surface oxygen groups [41], while others observed an opposite trend [42,43]. These discrepancies may arise from the fact that the amount of surface oxygen groups may directly affect the reaction pathway, by changing the adsorption capacity and affecting the adsorption mode, but also indirectly by influencing the metal dispersion and, to a lesser extent, the oxidation state of the active phases [17,19]. Table 5 compares the amount of surface oxygen (determined by TPD and XPS) in the pre-reduced PtFeZn/C-SA catalyst with that of the corresponding catalyst prepared over the unactivated support, PtFeZn/C-UA. The oxygen amount obtained by XPS, that only accounts for the outermost layers, is considerably higher than the corresponding value determined by TPD. Interestingly, comparison between Tables 1 and 5 indicates a large change in the amount of surface oxygen groups during the preparation and pre-treatments of the catalysts. Total oxygen content in PtFeZn/C-UA is much lower than that in PtFeZn/C-SA (TPD results—Table 5). A direct comparison between Tables 4 and 5 reveals that the catalyst with a lower amount of surface oxygen groups showed a somewhat lower activity but a rather superior selectivity in CML. The decrease in activity may result from the lower dispersion of Pt, while the superior selectivity may be explained by several factors, such as the higher size of the platinum crystallites (Table 2); the greater Zn surface concentration (Table 3) and therefore the possibility of formation of surface Pt–Zn species; and the influence of surface oxygen groups on the electronic state of the active centres. The first two factors have been discussed earlier. The lower surface concentration of electronegative oxygen facilitates higher electron transfer from the carbon support to the metal active species in PtFeZn/C-UA. This has resulted in an increase in the fraction of Pt0 (Table 3) and a rise in the electron density in the Pt sites, thereby intensifying the effect obtained upon the addition of the promoters. Moreover, Zhao et al. [44] observed that the selectivity to CML was enhanced by high Pt0/Pt2+ ratios, and that the influence of Pt0/Pt2+ was more significant on the selectivity than on the total conversion. The higher electron density around the Pt particles, along with a higher Pt0/Pt2+ ratio, decreased the probability of CC bond activation, and simultaneously promoted the activation of the CO group; hence the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has increased. We believe that the higher selectivity in CML presented by the PtFeZn/C-UA compared to that over PtFeZn/C-SA is mainly linked to the higher size of the platinum crystallites in the PtFeZn/C-UA, because electron transfer from the support to the metal active species would improve both activity and selectivity, whereas PtFeZn/C-UA showed a somewhat lower activity (Table 4). The textural properties of the support can also influence the catalyst performance. Traditional activated carbon supports have slit shaped micropores, where CMD can only enter sideways, favouring the hydrogenation of the CC group. The use of a mesoporous support enabled the approach of CMD to the active sites “head-on” (Scheme 2), promoting the catalyst selectivity [19,45]."
8,Conclusions,"A trimetallic Pt-based catalyst formulation was developed using a mesoporous carbon xerogel as support. This system showed a promising performance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde under mild conditions, in terms of both activity and selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol. The important promoting effect on activity and selectivity observed upon the addition of Zn and/or Fe to the Pt catalyst is probably linked to the electron transfer evidenced in XPS analyses and the creation of electrophilic sites for the adsorption of the carbonyl group. In addition, the higher size of the Pt crystallites on the promoted catalysts also has a beneficial influence on the selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol. Promotion by Fe is particularly effective to improve the activity, whereas Zn is somewhat better in terms of selectivity, and hence both metals are required in the tri-metallic formulation. Catalyst performance depends on both texture and surface chemistry of the carbon support."
