0,Introduction,"Among the natural energy sources, fossil fuels are the major energy sources, which cover almost 80% of global energy demand [1]. However, the storage of fossil fuels is being rapidly exhausted and additionally combustion of fossil fuels has encumbered negative impacts on global climate [2,3]. Such a situation has triggered a rapid search of alternative energy sources all over the globe. Biofuels being a renewable energy source can be a suitable substitute of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is one of the mostly investigated biofuel, which can be produce by transesterification of natural fatty acids [4]. Presently, in developed nations, numerous plants have been established for commercial biodiesel production from cheap organic materials. According to Selembo et al. (2009) till 2008–09, in US alone, there were nearly 176 biodiesel plants producing 9.8 billion liters of biodiesel per year [5]. During biodiesel production process, a large volume of glycerol is produced as a byproduct. One volume of glycerol is generated for every 10 volume of biodiesel produced [5,6]. The concentration of glycerol in biodiesel manufacturing waste may vary from plant to plant, which may be 1%–85% (v/v) or higher [7–9]. The crude glycerol produced during biodiesel production generally contains impurities, such as methanol, soap, salts, oils and solid organic materials [7,10,11]. Glycerol is an important raw material for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic manufacturing process [12]. However, due to presence of large amount of impurities; crude glycerol cannot be directly used to food or pharmaceutical industries and its purification is also expensive [13]. Hence, crude glycerol generated during biodiesel manufacturing process is of less commercial value [13]. Moreover, if directly released to the environment without proper treatment, it may be hazardous to the environment [5,14]. Hence, it cannot be disposed to the environment as a waste byproduct of biodiesel manufacturing process [14]. Alternatively, the glycerol containing waste effluent of biodiesel manufacturing plant can be used as a cheap substrate for production of different valuable products, such as 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, and animal feed, among others [14,15]. Production of hydrogen may be another alternative means for utilization of crude glycerol. Biohydrogen production using crude glycerol form biodiesel manufacturing industry has already been investigated by various researchers [5,7,16]. It is established that bio-hydrogen has very high energy content and it can be used as a biofuel [7]. Heat of combustion for hydrogen is −285.8 kJ/mol and it has an energy content of 142.9 kJ/g [17]. Moreover, if hydrogen is used as a fuel, only water is generated as a byproduct [5]. Hence, considering the increasing concern over global warming, hydrogen may be considered as the cleanest fuel for future. Therefore, bioconversion of crude glycerol to hydrogen is an interesting upcoming green field. In this pursuit, this review presents a systematic and comparative study of presently available reports on bio-hydrogen production from crude glycerol and tries to find out the future research that needs to be carried out. Firstly, characteristics of crude glycerol generated from biodiesel manufacturing processes are reviewed followed by hydrogen production potential of crude glycerol, various pretreatment methods, bioreactor systems used for microbial hydrogen production as well as the glycerol bioconversion potential of different microorganisms. Short comings of crude glycerol bioconversion are discussed elaborately and various strategies for improved hydrogen production have been suggested."
1,Glycerol: byproduct of biodiesel production,
2,Transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats,"2.1 Transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production process. For biodiesel production, conventionally, triglycerides, such as vegetable oils and animal fats are mixed with methanol in a reactor. Sodium hydroxide crystals are added as catalyst of the reaction and the mixture is agitated and heated to the boiling temperature of methanol [4,18,19]. When agitation stops, the reaction mixture gets separated into two phases. The upper layer is methyl ester of fatty acids, which is biodiesel and the lower layer is crude glycerol containing unreacted methanol, salt and solid substances present in the raw materials. Fig. 1 represents a schematic overview of transesterification and biodiesel production process. For every 10 volume of biodiesel production, one volume of glycerol generated as a byproduct [5,6]. Fig. 2 shows the chemical equation for glycerol production by transesterification of triglycerides [4]. The crude glycerol phase generally contains almost 75% glycerol [4]. However, glycerol content in biodiesel manufacturing waste may differ for different manufacturing plants. In an investigation, Ngo et al. (2010) have used biodiesel waste containing 1% (w/v) glycerol for hydrogen production [7]. In another investigation, Selembo et al. (2009) have reported the presence of 69.5% (w/v) glycerol in the waste generated by a biodiesel manufacturing plant [5]. Similarly, Ito et al. (2005) have reported the presence of 41% (w/v) glycerol in biodiesel waste collected from biodiesel manufacturing factory, Hiroshima prefecture, Japan [16]."
3,Global biodiesel market and crude glycerol production,"2.2 Global biodiesel market and crude glycerol production Germany, US, France, Argentina, and Brazil are the top five biodiesel producing nations in the world. Together, nearly 68.4% of the world's total biodiesel is produced by these countries [20]. According to Global Biodiesel Market (2009–2014), a recent market research report, published by “Markets and Markets”; the total global biodiesel market is expected to be worth US$12.6 billion by 2014, out of which the European and American market will share nearly 55.6% and 28.6% of the total revenues, respectively [21]. It is expected that the biodiesel market will grow from $8.6 billion in 2009 to $12.6 billion in 2014 [21]. From Fig. 3 , it can be seen that Europe is the leading biodiesel market in the world with a production share of 49.8% which is followed by the Americas with a production share of 32.8% and Asia Pacific with a share of 4.4% in 2009 [20]. According to European Biodiesel Board, presently there are approximately 120 plants in the EU producing up to 6,100,000 tons of biodiesel annually. These plants are mainly located in Germany, Italy, Austria, France and Sweden [22]. North America is the other front runner in global biodiesel production. According to a recent survey, in 2010 total biodiesel consumption in North America was 327 million barrels and during the period of 2006–2010, biodiesel consumption was increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9% [23]. Similarly, in the same report it has been estimated that by the end of 2015, total biodiesel consumption revenue of North America will reach to $ 116.8 billion with a highly significant CAGR [23]. The United States of America is the second largest producer of biodiesel in the world which produced 17.7% of global biodiesel production in 2009 [20]. There were nearly 170 biodiesel plants in the US by 2008 and soy was mainly used as raw material for biodiesel production [24]. The US market for biodiesel is expected to reach 6453 million liters in 2020 [20]. For every ten volume of biodiesel produced nearly one volume of crude glycerol is generated, hence, a very rapid increase of global crude glycerol production in recent future can be estimated."
4,The impurities present in crude glycerol,"2.3 The impurities present in crude glycerol Due to its high energy content, different researchers all over the globe have investigated bioconversion of crude glycerol to valuable products [5,7,8,10,16,25]. They have characterized crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing plants to obtain a broader idea of the impurities present in it. Chi et al. (2007) reported presence of 16% of impurities in a sample of crude glycerol collected from a biodiesel refinery. According to them, the impurities mainly present in the sample were soap, free fatty acids, methanol, unreacted triglycerides, diglycerides, and monoglycerides [11]. For a crude glycerol sample collected from a biodiesel manufacturing plant in Japan; Ito et al. (2005) have reported the presence of 540 g/l total organic carbon (TOC) with ash (8%, w/v), methanol (25%, w/w), 0.04% (w/w) diacylglycerol and 0.01% (w/w) monoacylglycerol [16]. In another report by Tang et al. (2009), presence of sodium sulfate 25.8 ± 2.7% (w/w), methanol 1.5 ± 0.2% (w/w), water and other compound 5.2 ± 1.0% (w/w), were confirmed for a crude glycerol sample [26]. A crude glycerol sample from biodiesel manufacturing process may also contain small amount of the oil used for transesterification [11] and any other impurities present in such oil."
5,Environmental problems of glycerol containing biodiesel waste,"2.4 Environmental problems of glycerol containing biodiesel waste As mentioned above, crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing plant may contain up to 25% (w/w) methanol [16] and from different studies it has been concluded that biodiesel waste containing methanol is inhibitory to microbial growth [11,27] and may be toxic to the environment, if released without proper treatment. Excess methanol present in crude glycerol may contaminate the ground water. Similarly, due to addition of NaOH in biodiesel manufacturing process, pH of the generated waste is generally higher and it should be neutralized before waste disposal. The wastewater having high pH, if released without treatment may be harmful to the biotic community of surrounding environment. Moreover, the waste water with high salinity and alkalinity may take longer time to be recycled by indigenous microorganisms of recipient environment which may result in continuous release of offensive odor and air pollution for longer time."
6,Different applications of crude glycerol,"2.5 Different applications of crude glycerol As mentioned earlier, purification of crude glycerol is costly [13] and hence its applications in food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries are not economically significant. Alternatively, it can be used as a substrate for bioconversion to valuable products. Different researchers have investigated bioconversion of crude glycerol to numbers of valuable products and it is summarized in Table 1 . Barbirato et al. (1998) have reported bioconversion of crude glycerol obtained from colza oil transesterification process, for production of 1,3-propanediol. A maximum 0.69 mol 1,3-propanediol per mol glycerol was produced. The maximal diol production rate was 1.85 g l−1 h−1, and butyrate (7.5 g l−1) and acetate (8.1 g l−1) were the only byproducts [28]. Ying et al. (2006) have also reported bioconversion of crude glycerol (85% w/v), collected after lipase-catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil [8]. Tang et al. (2009) have reported production of phytase by Pichia pastoris, where crude glycerol containing methanol from biodiesel processing plant was the sole carbon source [26]. Chi et al. (2007) have investigated the production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by microalgae Schizochytrium limacinum [11]. Liu et al. (2011) have described glycolipid production by Ustilago maydis using crude glycerol as a feedstock [29]. Similarly, Nitayavardhana and Khanal (2011) have showed that edible fungus Rhizopus microsporus could be grown using crude glycerol as a carbon source. The resulting biomass contains very high amount of threonine and can be used as an animal feed supplement [30]. The above discussion clearly shows that crude glycerol has been successfully used for different bioconversion processes. However, there is a need to find out yet another economically attractive and environmentally sound bioconversion technology for crude glycerol. Production of hydrogen by bioconversion of crude glycerol may be a suitable option, since, bio-hydrogen has high energy content and it is a pollution free source of energy, having the potential to be an alternative of increasingly depleting fossil fuels."
7,Glycerol: a substrate for bio-hydrogen production,
8,Different substrates presently used for bio-hydrogen,"3.1 Different substrates presently used for bio-hydrogen Burning fossil fuel as an energy source results in global warming [31], which is one of the most serious environmental problems for the world. The burning also causes the acid rain problem by its combustion gas [32]. In such a situation an alternative clean energy source is urgently needed. One great advantage of the fermentative hydrogen production is the broad spectrum of applicable substrates, allowing the possibility of coupling the energetic utilization of biomass to hydrogen with the simultaneous treatment of waste materials. Hydrogen produced via bioconversion of these organic waste materials may be a suitable alternative as combustion of hydrogen generates only water as byproduct [5], drastically reducing CO2, NO x , particulate and other emissions that accompany the use of fossil fuels. Different plant derived organic materials have been evaluated as feedstock by various researchers for their biohydrogen production potential. Perego et al. (1998) have evaluated bioconversion of corn starch hydrolysate by Enterobacter aerogenes for its hydrogen production potential [33]. Mizuno et al. (2000) have investigated bean curd manufacturing waste as a substrate for hydrogen production by anaerobic micro-flora [34]. Shin et al. (2003) have reported production of hydrogen by the mesophilic and thermophilic acidogenic culture using food waste as a substrate [35]. Yu et al. (2002) have studied production of hydrogen using rice winery wastewater as a feedstock. They have reported a maximum yield of 1.9 mol hydrogen per mol substrate used, in an upflow anaerobic reactor by using mixed anaerobic cultures [36]. Similarly, Tanisho and Ishiwata (1995) have evaluated molasses for its hydrogen production potential [32]. Also, numbers of other feedstock were evaluated by different workers for their hydrogen production potential and they are summarized in Table 2 . From the above discussion it is clear that a range of cheap and easily available substrates have been evaluated by various researchers, albeit the yields have been pretty low. At this behest, there is a need to find an alternative which can give overall yield and lesser mess."
9,Glycerol as a feedstock for hydrogen production,"3.2 Glycerol as a feedstock for hydrogen production Glycerol is another feedstock which can be utilized by many microbes for their growth and has been extensively studied for its hydrogen production potential. Energy content of pure glycerol is 19.0 MJ/kg; however, it is 25.30 MJ/kg for crude glycerol which may be due to presence of methanol and traces of biodiesel [37]. Such high energy content of crude glycerol indicates its high potential to be an effective substrate for hydrogen production. Additionally, unlike most cellulosic waste materials it does not require additional pretreatment to make it available for the hydrogen producing microorganisms. Moreover, substrates such as whey and molasses have high demand due to their wide range of application in industrial fermentations. Further, substrates such as food waste generally contain solid materials of different origin and need proper grinding and mixing before subjecting it to fermentation. Hence, for large scale hydrogen production, crude glycerol seems to be the ideal substrate without having afore mentioned constraints. Kivistö et al. (2010) have demonstrated hydrogen production by Halanaerobium saccharolyticum utilizing pure glycerol as a substrate [38]. Escapa et al. (2009) have reported hydrogen production from glycerol by using a microbial fuel cell (MFC). According to them, if heat-treated anaerobic sludge was used as inoculum, a maximum volumetric rate of hydrogen production of 0.6 l l−1 d−1 could be achieved [13]. Similarly, Ito et al. (2005) have investigated hydrogen production from pure glycerol. By using E. aerogenes HU-101 as inoculum, they have reported a maximum hydrogen yield rate of 80 mmol l−1 h−1 [16]. Wu et al. (2011) also have studied the potential of glycerol as a feedstock for hydrogen production by Klebsiella sp. HE1 [39]. Similarly, Seifert et al. (2009) have evaluated pure glycerol as a substrate for hydrogen production. For their study, a 60 ml glass reactor with working capacity of 30 ml was operated in batch mode and anaerobic digested sludge was used as inoculum. A maximum 0.41 mol H2 per mol glycerol was obtained for a medium containing 10 g l−1 glycerol [40]. Thus, there have been numbers of reports on high level of hydrogen production using glycerol suggesting its suitability as a feedstock for hydrogen production and they are summarized in Table 3 . However, pure glycerol is expensive and its use as a substrate for commercial production of hydrogen will not be economically significant. Alternatively, crude glycerol produced during biodiesel production may be a good feedstock for microbial hydrogen production. Crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing plant is a waste byproduct of biodiesel refinery and it needs proper treatment prior to its disposal [5,14]. Meanwhile, it is a good carbon source and it has the potential to support microbial growth as sole carbon source. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative feedstock for microbial hydrogen production. Various investigators have studied the hydrogen production potential of crude glycerol and reported very high hydrogen yield. Ngo et al. (2010) have investigated hydrogen production by Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 4359 by using crude glycerol as a substrate. In a small scale batch experiment using 120-mL serum bottles, they observed a maximum 0.14 mol-H2 yield per mol glycerol used [7]. Sakai and Yagishita (2007) have used E. aerogenes NBRC 12010 to produce hydrogen from crude glycerol by using bio-electrochemical cells [25]. Fernandes et al. (2010) have reported production of hydrogen by anaerobic sludge using crude glycerol as a substrate [41]. Guillaume and Patrick (2009) have reported hydrogen production using photo fermentation of pure and crude glycerol by Rhodopseudomonas palustris. According to them, a maximum of 6 mol of H2 was obtained per mole of glycerol consumed in the process [42]. This amount is 75% of theoretical maximum 8 mol H2 production per mole glycerol [42]. It indicates that in this case, intermediate products such as acetic acid, ethanol and butyric acid were further metabolized to hydrogen, which is otherwise accumulated during dark fermentation. Hsien-Long et al. (2003) have also pointed out that intermediate products, such as organic acid can be further metabolized to CO2 and H2 by photosynthetic organisms [43]. Therefore, a two stage fermentation of crude glycerol where dark fermentation will be followed by photo fermentation by suitable photosynthetic organism should be considered for further investigation. Further, during bioconversion of crude glycerol, both H2 and CO2 are produced and CO2 should be removed from the gas mixture to obtain H2 which can be used as a fuel. In laboratory, NaOH solution is used to remove CO2 from the biogas mixture and in industrial scale, pressure swing adsorption technology can be used [44,45]. From the above discussion based on Table 2 it is clear that bioconversion of organic materials for hydrogen production has been extensively studied and feasible. A range of cheap and waste carbonaceous materials has been investigated as a substrate for biohydrogen production and good hydrogen yield has been reported for them. Many workers have used pure glycerol as a feedstock for biohydrogen production reporting high hydrogen yield potential of glycerol. However, due to higher cost of pure glycerol, crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing process would be a preferred feedstock for hydrogen production."
10,Glycerol metabolism and hydrogen production,"3.3 Glycerol metabolism and hydrogen production Both oxidative and reductive metabolisms of glycerol are known for some species of Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Clostridium, and Enterobacter [46]. As shown in Fig. 4 , in the oxidative pathway, glycerol is first converted to dihydroxyacetone under catalytic activity of glycerol dehydrogenase. In the next step dihydroxyacetone is phosphorylated by the glycolytic enzyme dihydroxyacetone kinase. Finally the phosphorylated product is metabolized through glycolysis [46–49]. In the reducing pathway, glycerol is finally converted to PD via production of the intermediate product 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde. Conversion of glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde is catalyzed by B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase and related diol dehydratases, which is then reduced to PD by the NADH+H+- dependent enzyme 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase [46,50,51]. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that during oxidative metabolism of glycerol, pyruvate is formed as an intermediate. According to Drożdżyńska et al. (2011) pyruvate formed during glycerol bioconversion may be metabolized to different endproducts by different organism [46]. According to da Silva et al. (2009) ethanol, butanol, acetone, acetate, butyrate and lactate are some of the possible metabolites of oxidative metabolism of glycerol [14]. In most of the glycerol bioconversion pathways, along with different metabolites H2 is also produced during oxidative metabolism. From the stoichiometric equations presented in Fig. 5 it can be concluded that production of highly reduced end product is accompanied by leaser H2 yield. Microbial hydrogen production is based on a simple redox reaction: 2H+ + 2e− ↔ H2 [52]. This reaction is catalyzed by some hydrogen-producing enzymes found in hydrogen producing organisms. Three main such hydrogen producing enzymes which catalyze most biohydrogen generating reactions are nitrogenases, [NiFe]-hydrogenases, and [FeFe]-hydrogenases [52,53]. Mathews et al. (2009) have illustrated the different metabolic pathways present in Clostridium acetobutylicum which produce H2 during anaerobic fermentation of glucose [52]. It can be seen from the Fig. 7 that similar to oxidative metabolism of glycerol, first pyruvate is produced which is then converted to different metabolites and H2 via different pathways. Pyruvate is broken down to acetyl-CoA via reduction of a ferredoxin (Fd) catalyzed by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Reduced ferredoxin (Fd) is then oxidized by a hydrogenase that reproduces oxidized Fd and hydrogen gas [52,54]. Some additional amount of hydrogen can be produced during glycolysis when NADH is oxidized by Fd reduction and NADH-ferredoxin reductase [52,55]. Theoretically a maximum of 4 mol H2 can be produced per mole glucose when acetate is the fermentation end product. However, only 2 mol H2 per mol glucose can be generated during butyrate production and for reduced endproducts such as alcohols and lactic acid yet lower H2 generation is known [52,56]."
11,Justification of crude glycerol bioconversion to hydrogen,"3.4 Justification of crude glycerol bioconversion to hydrogen From the above discussion, it is clear that 1,3-propanediol (PD) and H2 are the two major products which can be obtained by bioconversion of crude glycerol. However, due to following reasons, H2 production is found to be more suitable than PD production by crude glycerol bioconversion: (a) Glycerol has high hydrogen content (8 numbers) and energy content of hydrogen is as high as 142.9 kJ/g [17], which is suitable to use it as a fuel, (b) It will encourage the use of H2 as an alternative fossil fuel which in turn will reduce greenhouse gas emission, (c) Low yield and low productivity is the major constraint of bioconversion of glycerol to PD [57]. In an investigation, Abbad-Andaloussi et al. (1998) found that when glycerol alone was used as substrate, 43% of glycerol was oxidized to organic acids to obtain energy for growth and only 57% was utilized to produce PD [58,59]. However, very high bioconversion efficiency has been reported for hydrogen production using crude glycerol [42]. (d) Glycerol fermentation to PD is a two-step reaction catalyzed by Vit-B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase (GDHt) and 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase (PDOR) enzymes. Therefore, addition of high cost molecule, Vit-B12 to the medium is required for the production of PD [58,60]. Moreover, when glycerol is used as a substrate, GDHt undergoes irreversible inactivation by glycerol [61,62]. e) At the end of bioconversion of crude glycerol to PD, the fermentation broth generally contains water, residual glycerol, byproducts such as acetate, lactate, ethanol; macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides; and unused medium components. Moreover, PD is known to be hydrophilic in nature and has a high boiling point [58]. Because of aforesaid reasons purification of PD from a fermentation broth is very complex. According to Xiu and Zeng (2008), commonly used methods for purification of PD are reactive extraction, liquid–liquid extraction, evaporation, distillation, membrane filtration, pervaporation and ion exchange chromatography, however, all these methods are known to have numbers of limitations [58,63]. Meanwhile, such constraints are hardly reported for H2 production as relatively insoluble H2 spontaneously partitions to the gas phase of a reactor [42]. Thus, bioconversion of crude glycerol to H2 can be considered as the most suitable option for utilization of biodiesel industry derived crude glycerol."
12,Challenges to be addressed,"3.5 Challenges to be addressed It is clear that akin to other cheap organic substrates, crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing process may also be a potential feedstock for industrial production of hydrogen using microbial process. However, to convert it to be a reliable and economically significant option for microbial hydrogen production, the following issues should be addressed successfully: (a) From Fig. 4 it can be concluded that in many microorganism there exist two biochemical pathways for glycerol metabolism. H2 gas is generated during bioconversion of glycerol through oxidative pathway; however, PD is produced during reductive metabolism. When both the pathways exist in the same organism, some amount of H2 is consumed for PD production. According to Selembo et al. (2009), during anaerobic fermentation of glycerol, for production of 1 mol of PD, 1 mol of H2 is consumed [5]. Therefore, final yield of H2 is reduced by directly consuming the produced H2 for simultaneous production of PD and also by making most of the substrate unavailable for H2 production by reducing it to PD. Continuous removal of produced hydrogen from fermentation broth by pursing N2 may result in improved hydrogen production by making it unavailable for subsequent PD production. Similarly, genetic engineering strategies for blocking PD production pathway in H2 producing organism may also be a viable option for improved H2 production. Another alternative possibility is to further break down of PD produced during glycerol metabolism to H2 by developing novel strategies. These strategies may involve chemical treatment of PD, produced during anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol, to ensure its availability as a substrate for hydrogen production. Otherwise, suitable metabolic engineering strategies may also be devised for the same purpose. (b) Usually, heat pretreatment is used for hydrogen producing inocula to inhibit hydrogen consuming organisms, such as methanogens without reducing the activity of hydrogen producing organism [5,64]. Other methods for pretreatment of hydrogen producing inocula are ultra-sonication, acidification, sterilization, and freezing/thawing [5,65–67]. However, according to Selembo et al. (2009) efficiency and effect of these different pretreatment methods on hydrogen production and glycerol fermentation is not well documented [5]. Therefore, all such methods need to be verified for glycerol fermentation and hydrogen production efficiency for better hydrogen yield. (c) Accumulation of fermentation end product such as acetic acid, butyric acid resulted in lower yield of hydrogen during dark fermentation [52,68]. Undissociated acid concentration of 19 mM in the fermentation broth is enough to initiate solventogenesis and cease of hydrogen production [52,68]. Therefore, further conversion of end products of glycerol fermentation to hydrogen is necessary for maximum hydrogen yield. Two stage fermentation of glycerol where dark fermentation is followed by photo fermentation or microbial fuel cell technology to produce hydrogen may be a suitable option. Other alternative is to use membrane bioreactors in continuous processes, allowing biomass to be retained and fluid (containing volatile fatty acids) to be washed out [69]. Alternatively, co-culture of hydrogen producing organism and microbes that can produce hydrogen from glycerol fermentation end products may be another option. (d) It can be seen from the Fig. 5 that high hydrogen yield is possible when acetic acid is produced as fermentation end product instead of butyric acid and other solvents. Morimoto et al. (2005) have reported that in Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 improved hydrogen yield has been achieved by over-expression of hydA gene which encodes [FeFe]-hydrogenase [52,70]. Almost 1.7-fold increase in hydrogen production over wild strain was accompanied by increased acetic acid production due to over-oxidation of NADH [52,70]. Other similar strategies should be developed for increased acetic acid production during glycerol fermentation for improved hydrogen yield. (e) From different reports, it can be found that methanol and soap, the major impurities present in crude glycerol are inhibitory toward microbial growth [7,11]. Therefore for improved hydrogen production by bioconversion of crude glycerol suitable pretreatment technology for biodiesel industry derived glycerol should be developed. Such technology should be suitable for scaling up to industrial scale and economically sound. (f) Round the year availability of crude glycerol should be ensured for large scale production and use of hydrogen as a fuel. Government agencies should take the initiative for popularization of use of hydrogen energy as well as to develop proper market for biohydrogen to ensure economic viability of large scale bioconversion of crude glycerol for hydrogen production."
13,Pretreatment of crude glycerol,
14,Importance of crude glycerol pretreatment,"4.1 Importance of crude glycerol pretreatment As it is mentioned earlier, the transesterification process for biodiesel production involves mixing of vegetable oil and animal fats with methanol and addition of sodium hydroxide as catalyst [4,18,19]. Therefore, apart from glycerol, a typical biodiesel waste may contain high concentrations of salts (e.g., sodium chloride), methanol, and precipitated solids [6,71], which may affect the microbial growth, when added as a substrate for bioconversion [7,11]. Ngo et al. (2010) have reported that when crude glycerol was directly mixed with culture medium for bioconversion purpose, soaps precipitated from the liquid media, which was found detrimental to cell growth [7,11]. Athalye et al. (2009) have reported the negative effect of crude glycerol containing methanol and soap on production of eicosapentaenoic acid by Pythium irregulare [27]. Similarly, Pyle et al. (2008) have also reported the inhibitory effect of crude glycerol containing methanol and soap on production of docosahexaenoic acid by S. limacinum [72]. In order to avoid such incidences, crude glycerol should be pre-treated before using as a feedstock for hydrogen production. To investigate the effect of pretreatment of crude glycerol on hydrogen production, Ngo et al. (2010) had conducted a study where pre-treated glycerol and untreated glycerol waste were used as the substrate for T. neapolitana. According to the authors, the level of H2 produced from pre-treated glycerol waste, from where alcoholic compounds are removed by rotary evaporation and solid substances were removed by centrifugation, was much higher than that from glycerol waste without treatment [7]."
15,Different methods of crude glycerol pretreatment,"4.2 Different methods of crude glycerol pretreatment As discussed earlier, soap and methanol are the major impurities present in crude glycerol and they are inhibitory to microbial growth [11,27]. To use the crude glycerol as a feedstock for bioconversion, methanol can be removed by autoclaving [27,73]. According to Denver et al. (2008) methanol evaporates at 65 °C, hence the autoclave process lasting for 15 min at 121 °C is capable of removing significant amount of methanol from crude glycerol [72]. Alternatively, since boiling point of methanol is only 65 °C which is far lower than that of water and glycerol; methanol removal by controlled distillation of crude glycerol can also be considered. A very simple distillation setup will be required for such a process and it will be easy to scale up for industrial application. In a recent investigation on hydrogen production from crude glycerol, Ngo et al. (2010) have reported the removal of methanol and ethanol by rotary evaporation at 45 °C, where solids were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min [7]. Soap is the other major impurity present in crude glycerol, which can be removed by precipitation from the liquid medium through pH adjustment [27,73]. Chi et al. (2007) have used the following procedure to remove soap from crude glycerol: (i) crude glycerol was first mixed with distilled water at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) to reduce the viscosity; (ii) pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.5 with hydrochloric acid to convert the soluble soap into insoluble free fatty acids; (iv) finally precipitated fatty acid was removed from the crude glycerol solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm [11]. The main advantage of this method is that the final pH of resulting solution (6.5) is suitable for H2 production by wide range of microorganisms. Similarly, Ethier et al. (2011) have adopted the following procedure: (i) crude glycerol was mixed with distilled water at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) to reduce the viscosity of the solution, (ii) soap was precipitated by converting it to insoluble free fatty acid by adjusting the pH of the solution to 3 by using sulfuric acid, (iii) then the fatty acid-precipitated solution was kept static for 30 min to allow free fatty acid and glycerol to separate into two phases, (iv) finally, the upper free fatty acid phase was removed from the crude glycerol phase through a separation funnel [73]. Sodium chloride is another major impurity present in crude glycerol from biodiesel production process [6,71]. Chiu et al. (2006) have evaluated a method for removal of sodium from glycerol solutions by crystallization/precipitation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) through the co-addition of lime [Ca (OH) 2] and phosphoric acid [74]. However, presence of sodium chloride in crude glycerol also offers a unique opportunity to use salt resistant H2 producing microorganisms for crude glycerol bioconversion without having much competition for substrate utilization. Therefore, before recommending any method for sodium chloride removal, the possible advantage offered by its presence should also be considered. Thus, various methods have been evaluated for removal of major impurities from crude glycerol. However, no attempt has been made to scale up any of above mentioned process for impurity removal from crude glycerol. Therefore, information on suitability of such method for application in large scale bioconversion of crude glycerol is lacking. Hence, detailed study on optimization of such pretreatment methods, investigation of effect of such pretreatments on bioconversion of crude glycerol and their economical feasibility for industrial application should be evaluated. Moreover, the possibility of a collective removal method for all the major impurities present in crude glycerol should also be explored."
16,Bioreactor systems for hydrogen production,
17,Different types of reactors evaluated for bio-hydrogen production,"5.1 Different types of reactors evaluated for bio-hydrogen production To evaluate hydrogen production using different organic waste materials including crude glycerol from biodiesel manufacturing plant, a range of reactor types has been used. A bioreactor used for this purpose may be a small serum vial of 10 ml working volume or a 2.5-l fermentor. Kivistö et al. (2010) have reported the use of airtight glass tube of 10 ml working volume for hydrogen production by using H. saccharolyticum. It has been reported that by using pure glycerol as a substrate, nearly 1.61 mol-H2 could be generated from each mol of glycerol, where the study was carried out in batch mode [38]. Fernandes et al. (2010) have studied hydrogen production from crude glycerol by using a 2-l glass flasks consisting of 1-l of liquid volume and 1-l of headspace. The flask was inoculated with the inoculum derived from a packed-bed reactor used to produce hydrogen from a sucrose-based synthetic substrate and anaerobic environment was maintained using N2 [41]. Ito et al. (2004) have described a packed-bed reactor of 60 ml working volume which was operated in continuous mode. Crude glycerol containing fresh medium was supplied from the bottom, and the resulting effluent was discharged from the top of the reactor, with the help of a peristaltic pump [16]. In another study, Yu et al. (2002) reported hydrogen production from rice winery wastewater using a 3.0-l upflow reactor. The Plexiglas made reactor was of 90 mm diameter (internal) and a height of 480 mm. Using mixed anaerobic culture, under continuous operation of the reactor, a maximum 2.14 mol-H2 per mol hexose was reported by the authors [36]. Use of bio-electrochemical cell is another widely investigated method for hydrogen production. Different workers have evaluated the use of pure or crude glycerol as a substrate for hydrogen production using bio-electrochemical cells [10,13,25]. Sakai and Yagishita (2007) have described a bio-electrochemical two-compartment reactor with a cation-exchange membrane separating the compartments and crude glycerol was used as a feedstock for hydrogen production by E. aerogenes NBRC 12010 [25]. Fig. 6 represents a microbial electrolysis cell used for H2 production by bioconversion of glycerol. The basic principle of the system is that during bioconversion of glycerol, electron is donated to the anode, and with the help of an external power supply, free protons are reduced on the cathode to produce H2 [13,75–77]. From the above discussion (Table 4 ), it is clear that a range of bioreactor setup has been evaluated for hydrogen production from cheap organic materials including crude glycerol from biodiesel industry. They may be simple serum bottles of different size [5,9,38,42,78], laboratory scale fermentor with agitation and pH control [33,39,79], pack-bed or upflow reactor constructed from Plexiglas [16,36], or may be bio-electrochemical cells [10,13,25]. However, based on the hydrogen yield potential reported, a particular setup could not be considered superior to the rest. It is also observed that most of the experiments were carried out in batch mode using serum vials [7,38,78], as the studies are still in their infancy stage. In a report on hydrogen production from biodiesel processing waste, Ito et al. (2004) have indicated that the biodiesel wastes containing glycerol should be diluted with a synthetic medium to increase the rate of glycerol utilization. They have reported that the production of H2 decreased with an increase in the concentrations of biodiesel wastes [16]. Therefore, for bioconversion of large volume of diluted crude glycerol, a continuous system may be more suitable than a batch system, once it assures maximum mixing and homogeneity and controlled concentration of volatile fatty acids (based on organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time), on which relatively less reports are available. Further, unlike mostly reported free cell systems for crude glycerol bioconversion, suitable reactor with immobilized cell system, such as packed-bed and membrane reactors may offer dual benefits of higher initial cell density and protection of microorganisms from impurities present in crude glycerol."
18,Important process parameters and their optimum levels,"5.2 Important process parameters and their optimum levels From Table 4, it is clear that microbial hydrogen production has been investigated using different reactor types and chosen optimum process parameters have been different for separate cases. Ngo et al. (2010) have investigated hydrogen production potential of T. neapolitana DSM 4359 using biodiesel manufacturing waste as feedstock. They have reported high hydrogen yield by the hyperthermophilic eubacterium, where the experiment was carried out at 75 °C and pH 7.5 [7]. Selembo et al. (2009) have investigated the hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol with heat-treated mixed cultures. They have carried out the experiment at 30 °C and pH 6.2 [5]. Perego et al. (1998) have studied hydrogen production by E. aerogense, using corn starch hydrolysate as a substrate. The reactor was operated at 40 ± 0.5 °C and pH 5.5 and a high yield of 1.8 mmol H2 per mmol glucose was reported by the authors [33]. From the above discussion, it is clear that the temperature range used by various researchers for hydrogen production varied from 25° C to 75° C [7,13], and similarly pH 4.5 to 7.5 was reported [7,80]. The process parameters may vary according to the mode of operation or the biological agent (microorganism) used in the process. Therefore, a particular temperature or pH cannot be considered optimum for hydrogen production process as a whole. However, when the process is carried out using a particular strain, there will be an optimum level for such parameters. Environmental conditions and media composition when working with industrial complex wastewaters plays an important role in process development because it influences drastically hydrogen production. Many studies reported the influence of Zn, Cu, nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium and iron in dark fermentation processes [81–84]. Hawkes et al. (2007) reviewed the media composition for hydrogen production and found that apart from N and P source, only K, Mg and Fe are common in all recipes analyzed so far [85]. More details of microelements consumption and dark fermentation evolution might be evaluated but it is clear that by knowing media composition supplementation of micronutrients and/or dilution with water can be predicted (saving time and money)."
19,Microorganisms used for glycerol bioconversion,
20,Microorganisms presently used for glycerol bioconversion,"6.1 Microorganisms presently used for glycerol bioconversion As glycerol has been used for production of different products; various microorganisms have been evaluated for their glycerol bioconversion ability. Ngo et al. (2010) reported glycerol bioconversion and hydrogen production using T. neapolitana DSM 4359, a hyperthermophilic eubacterium. They have reported nearly 2.73 mol-H2 production for each mol glycerol used [7]. Selembo et al. (2009) have investigated bioconversion of glycerol by heat-treated mixed microbial culture. They have reported a maximum production of 0.31 mol-H2 per mol glycerol consumed as well as CO2 and PD as byproduct [5]. Barbirato et al. (1998) have used Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 25955 to produce PD by bioconversion of glycerol [28]. Similarly, Tang et al. (2009) used P. pastoris to produce Phytase by using crude glycerol as a substrate [26]. Nitayavardhanaa and Khanal (2011) have recently reported the possibility of production of animal feed supplement from crude glycerol by using edible fungus, Rhizopus microspores [30]. At high temperature, hydrogen production is more exergonic, extreme- and hyper-thermophiles show resistance to high hydrogen partial pressures [86], which otherwise would cause a metabolic shift to production of more reduced products. One advantage of fermentation at extreme temperatures is that the process is less sensitive to contaminations but on the other hand it is complicated to achieve a positive economical relation between the energy used to heat and maintain the reactor at high temperatures and the H2 production. Moreover, extreme thermophilic anaerobic bacteria usually grow low densities resulting in low production rates. Researchers have investigated the bioconversion of glycerol using monoculture or mixed microbial consortia. As it is shown in Table 5 , E. aerogenes is the most studied organism for hydrogen production by using crude glycerol. Mixed microbial culture from environmental sources is the other mostly used inoculums for glycerol bioconversion; however, some constraints of process stability do exist and might be considered especially when industrial wastewaters with continuous composition variation are used. Phowan et al. (2010) have demonstrated that co-culture of Clostridium butyricum TISTR 1032 and E. aerogenes TISTR 1468 was capable of reducing the lag phase of hydrogen production from cassava pulp hydrolysate with the maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 458 ml. They have reported that production of H2 was approximately 14.50% higher than that of using only C. butyricum TISTR 1032 alone [87]. Similarly, Wang et al. (2008) have demonstrated a co-culture of C. acetobutylicum X9 and Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 capable of producing 1810 ml H2/L-medium using microcrystalline cellulose as substrate [88]. However, the use of co-culture of two suitable strains for bioconversion of crude glycerol to hydrogen has not been explored completely. Use of co-culture for glycerol bioconversion to hydrogen may play a significant role in improving hydrogen yield. It is observed that during glycerol metabolism along with hydrogen numbers of fermentation end products such as acetic acid, butyric acid, ethanol and butanol may be produced (Fig. 7 ). However, accumulation of such products in the fermentation broth is known to be inhibitory toward hydrogen production [52]. Jianzheng et al. (2007) have shown that intermediate products of glycerol fermentation such as butyric acid and ethanol can be further converted to hydrogen by acetogenic bacteria [89]. Therefore, co-culture of acetogenic bacteria along with hydrogen producing organism for glycerol bioconversion may reduce the accumulation of metabolites and improve hydrogen yield. However, acetogenic strain to be used for glycerol bioconversion as co-culture should be verified for preferential metabolism of fermentation end products in presence of glycerol as major substrate. Methanol and soap are the two major impurities present in crude glycerol and they are known to have inhibitory effect on microbial growth [7,11]. Bacteria, such as Sporomusa acidovorans are known to have methanol degradation potential [90]. Similarly, some species of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterobacter are known to have soap degradation potential [91]. Therefore, a co-culture of hydrogen producing bacteria and methanol or soap degrading bacteria may be helpful for improve bioconversion of crude glycerol to hydrogen. However, soap or methanol degradation efficiency of proposed co-culture should be verified in presence of crude glycerol as alternative substrate, before using it for glycerol bioconversion. Similarly, PD is another product which may be produced during glycerol bioconversion to hydrogen. Therefore, a co-culture of suitable microorganism which can simultaneously utilize PD or intermediate product of PD pathway and can produce hydrogen via glycerol fermentation may be a suitable option of crude glycerol bioconversion."
21,Genetic and metabolic engineering for improved hydrogen production,"6.2 Genetic and metabolic engineering for improved hydrogen production Genetic and metabolic engineering may be seen as potential tools for improvement of hydrogen production by bioconversion of crude glycerol. In recent years, various researchers have investigated microbial hydrogen production by using engineered microorganisms and have reported increased hydrogen yield [92–95]. Kim et al. (2008) have reported hydrogen production by recombinant Rhodobacter sphaeroides containing the genes for pyruvate metabolism of Rhodospirillum rubrum. They have observed that under photoheterotrophic conditions, H2 production by the recombinant R. sphaeroides increased up to two fold and produced 4 mol H2 per mol of glucose compared to 2 mol H2 per mol of glucose by the strain without the gene from R. rubrum [95]. Similarly, Maeda et al. (2007) have reported a recombinant Escherichia coli strain expressing the bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. A 41 fold increase in hydrogen production over the wild type has been reported for the recombinant strain. According to the authors, by using an optimized medium, the recombinant E. coli cells are also capable of producing 2 folds higher hydrogen than the well-studied E. aerogenes HU-101 [94]. Chittibabu et al. (2006) also have developed a genetically modified strain of E. coli containing [FeFe]-hydrogenase gene from Enterobacter cloacae IIT BT-08. 3.12 mol-H2 yield per mol glucose has been achieved for the genetically modified strain, which was much higher than its wild type [93]. A number of successful genetic engineering attempts have been made for improvement of microbial hydrogen production. However, hydrogen production potential of a recombinant strain by using different organic wastes materials as feedstock is not yet documented. In a recent review, Mathewsa and Wang (2009) suggested that in order to increase the economical viability of hydrogen production, various substrate utilization pathways should be engineered into hydrogen-producing organisms [52]. Therefore, a genetically engineered microbial strain capable of efficient bioconversion of crude glycerol may improve the economic viability of microbial hydrogen production. Recently, by using adaptive evolution and chemical mutagenesis followed by growth experiment on glycerol, Hu and Wood (2009) have developed an improved E. coli strain (HW2) that produces 20-fold more hydrogen in glycerol containing medium (0.68 ± 0.16 mmol-H2 l−1 h−1) [96]. Yazdani and Gonzalez (2008) also have described a recombinant E. coli strain capable of bioconversion of glycerol to ethanol and hydrogen [97]."
22,Conclusion and future perspectives,"Hydrogen can be considered as the cleanest alternative of fossil fuels as no harmful byproduct generated during its combustion and it can be produced from renewable energy sources. Glycerol containing waste from biodiesel manufacturing process is a potential feedstock for microbial hydrogen production. Different researchers have evaluated its performance as a cheap substrate for hydrogen production and indicated that its hydrogen production potential is comparable to any other organic waste presently used for hydrogen production. The most important advantage of using crude glycerol over other substrates for hydrogen production is that it will increase the overall profit of biodiesel manufacturing plants. Such a situation may encourage the production and utilization of biofuels, which is environmentally beneficial. Biohydrogen can be burned for heat generation and/or converted to electricity through fuel cells and be used in the biodiesel process, replacing and avoiding dependence of other non green energy sources. However, crude glycerol contains many impurities which are inhibitory to microbial growth and hydrogen production. Scarce literature reports are available on pretreatment of crude glycerol used for hydrogen production. Hence, further investigation is still required to optimize crude glycerol pretreatment for biohydrogen production. A collective removal method for different types of impurities and feasibility study of its industrial scale application may be helpful for crude glycerol bioconversion and large scale hydrogen production in future. Accumulation of fermentation end products, such as acetic acid and butyric acid is known to have negative effect on overall hydrogen yield. Hence, alternative strategy, such as further conversion of fermentation end product into CO2 and H2 by photo fermentation should be investigated in detail. It should be noted that maximum production of 6 mol H2 per mole glycerol has been achieved by photo fermentation which is 75% of theoretical maximum 8 mol H2 per mole glycerol. Similarly, most investigations on crude glycerol bioconversion have been carried out in serum bottle scale batch reactors. Only, a few studies carried out in continuous mode have given better yield of hydrogen than batch experiments. Hence, further investigation of microbial hydrogen production using continuous mode is recommended. The most investigated microorganism for hydrogen production from crude glycerol is E. aerogenes. Other frequently used inoculum is indigenous mixed micro-flora of organic waste materials. It is a common practice that when a microbial consortium is used as inoculum, pretreatment of such inoculum is made to eliminate hydrogen consuming organisms, such as methanogens. Ultrasonic, thermal and acid treatments are some common method for inoculum pretreatment. However, their role on overall hydrogen production is not well documented. Hence, detailed study and optimization of such methods may play a vital role large scale hydrogen production in future. Alternatively, co-culture of two different strains can also be evaluated for crude glycerol bioconversion. Application of a co-culture, which is capable of reducing the accumulation of fermentation end products by simultaneously metabolizing it to H2, is an interesting subject for future investigation. Further, genetically engineered microbial strains may enhance the hydrogen production potential of crude glycerol."
