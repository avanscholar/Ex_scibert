0,Introduction,"The formation of crystals with predictable pore sizes is a centre of interest of material scientists [1]. The first natural microporous aluminosilicate was discovered more than 200 years ago. Its water adsorption capacity was acknowledged [2] and the ion-exchange properties of these natural zeolites were utilised. Their properties as adsorbents and desiccants feature in their function as molecular sieves. The advantages of synthesised zeolites include high purity, uniform pore size and better ion-exchange abilities such as for the softening of hard water [3]. Zeolite crystals are widely used as catalysts in petrochemical and fine chemical industries. Recent moves to synthesise zeolites using green processes [4] have demonstrated that the combination of the use of ionothermal synthesis, microwave heating and solvent-free synthesis yields simple, fast and environmentally favourable routes. There is enormous potential for zeolite materials to be designed with new functions [5] for example single layered zeolite nanosheets and the growth of thin zeolite membranes using seed assembly [6] and secondary growth [7] for industrial applications. Over the last decade, new zeolite structures have been achieved by using strategies based on pre-designed organic structure-directing agents, heteroatom replacement and topotactic conversion [8]. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been amongst the most promising materials that have developed over the last decade. With the varied functionalities of MOFs, they also show high porosity and surface properties [9]. The variety of the pore sizes in MOFs and the extent of surface area values gives them the promise of adsorption and separation applications [10,11] leading to the ability of MOFs to capture CO2 using the design and fabrication of mixed matrix membranes [12]. Through modifications to the functional groups of MOFs, the chemical nature and activity can be altered to enhance targeted properties and to achieve improved performance [13]. On comparing these hybrid materials with counterpart zeolites, their properties have many applicable advantages. MOFs have a flexible framework with the ability to breathe after solvent removal whereas zeolites yield a more rigid framework [6]. However, the fixed pore size in many zeolites allows for molecular sieving with a clear cut off and the possibility of gate opening under certain pressure conditions such as the petrochemical discrimination between xylene isomers superior to that of a comparable MOF [14]. In general, adsorption over zeolites was attributed to the matching of the topology of the adsorbent with that of the guest. Other organic supramolecular structures, such as hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HOFs), despite having the ability of stepwise guest exchange, demonstrate frameworks robustness which incorporates charge assisted hydrogen bonds [15,16]. Although molecular host–guest systems such as Werner complexes are not as sturdy as naturally existing zeolites or MOFs, they do have the advantage of ‘tunability’ in terms of the nature and size of pores concerned [17]. Metal-based systems have the advantage of producing a wider variety of coordinations and topologies. The use of ligands with hydrogen bonding functionalities, although not extensively considered in Werner clathrates, may lead to the production of frameworks with versatility in their host structures, offering improved opportunities for inclusion or separation [18] as shown in mixed ligand Co(II) and Zn(II) complexes [19]. Recently, Werner complexes have been targeted in the design of bioconjugation reagents [20]. This twenty-first century manifestation of Alfred Werner’s coordination chemistry [21] demonstrates that the octahedral bonding environment of a transition metal is one of the structural features in nanoparticle therapeutics. Werner complexes with ligands forming CH⋯π and π⋯π interactions have previously been considered. The ligands had either aromatic properties with rigidity or provided flexibility between two aromatic rings [22]. Different crystallisation methods were compared with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enlightening the ability to use environmentally acceptable procedures in clathration and separation [23]. Werner clathrates with mixed ligands were synthesized with the aim of improved selectivity towards enclathrated guests [24]. In a similar way to which MOFs can be modified with the addition of active functional groups, the chemical activity of Werner complexes can be tuned by the incorporation of functional groups with predictable hydrogen bond formation. Our aim in this study is to produce complexes with the advantage of metal coordination as well as those of MOFs by the introduction of hydrogen bonding ligands. The design of a robust framework with desired properties for encapsulation was envisaged. The use of predictable hydrogen bond formation enabled the formation of multi-component crystals from different building blocks. Three host complexes with general formula Ni(NCS)2L4 were synthesised, namely, Ni(II)thiocyanate with four nicotinamides (H1), with four isonicotinamide ligands (H2) and a mixed ligand complex with two of each of the ligands (H3). Their properties of enclathration and packing as hosts for a selection of alcohols and carbonyls were studied and their properties discussed. The structural line diagrams are shown for these hosts in Scheme 1 , guests are shown in the Electronic Supplementary Information (Scheme S1 and S2)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of Werner clathrates,"2.1 Preparation of Werner clathrates The host compound, H1, bis(isothiocyanato)tetrakis(nicotinamide)nickel(II), was prepared by adding stoichiometric quantities of an ethanolic solution of nicotinamide (20 ml, 0.01 M) to an ethanolic solution of nickel-isothiocyanate (5 ml, 0.01 M) and stirring at room temperature for 2 hours. Blue micro-crystalline Ni(NCS)2(C6H6N2O)4 material formed, was filtered and allowed to air dry overnight. H2, bis(isothiocyanato)tetrakis(isonicotinamide)nickel(II), required stirring overnight at room temperature. Violet H2 micro-crystalline material was filtered and allowed to air dry overnight. The blue micro-crystalline H3 material, Ni(NCS)2(nicotinamide)2(isonicotinamide)2, was synthesized by adding a stoichiometric quantity of nicotinamide:isonicotinamide in a 50:50 mixture to the solution of nickel-isothiocyanate. Enclathration of the guest/s was carried out by dissolving the host in the guest, stirring at 45 °C for 30 min, cooling and filtering. If solubility of the host in the selected guest was low, ethanol or methanol was added to improve dissolution of the host. Crystallisation occurred between 24 hours and fourteen days. Blue or violet crystals of the clathrates were formed."
3,Single crystal X-ray analysis,"2.2 Single crystal X-ray analysis Intensity data of a selected single crystal for the compounds H1·2EtOH, H1·2BuOH, H1·2MePrOH, H1·PeOH, H1·2MeBeOH, H1·2DMF, H1·2PEN, H1·2HEX, H1·2PIN, H1·2MCH, H2·EtOH·0.4H2O, H2·3H2O, H2·2INIC·EtOH and H3·0.2MeOH·H2O were collected on a Bruker DUO APEX II diffractometer [25] with graphite monochromated Mo Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 173 K using an Oxford Cryostream 700. Data reduction and cell refinement were performed using SAINT‐Plus [26]. The space group was determined from systematic absences by XPREP [27]. The structure was solved using SHELXS‐97 [28] and refined using full matrix least squares methods in SHELXL‐97 [27] with the aid of the program X‐Seed [29]. The hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were placed at idealized positions and refined as riding atoms. Hydrogen atoms in –NH2 and –OH groups were also placed in idealized positions giving constant N–H distances. Diagrams and publication material were generated using PLATON [30], X‐Seed and Mercury (3.8) [31]. Crystal data and structure refinement parameters are given in Tables 1, 2, 8 and 11 . Supplementary crystallographic data for structures were submitted to the CCDC under 1844286 (H1·2EtOH), 1844287 (H1·2BuOH), 1844288 (H1·2MePrOH), 1844289 (H1·PeOH), 1844290 (H1·2MeBeOH), 1844291 (H1·2DMF), 1844292 (H1·2PEN), 1844293 (H1·2HEX), 1844294 (H1·2PIN), 1844295 (H1·2MCH), 1844296 (H2·EtOH·0.4H2O), 1844297 (H2·3H2O), 1844298 (H2·2INIC·EtOH) and 1867163 (H3·0.2MeOH·H2O). In H1·PeOH, there was a higher level of disorder in the guest molecule and C18 was refined with isotropic parameters. The structure was refined as far as possible for a chemically meaningful result. When the disorder in H1·2PIN was modelled, the minor disorder was under 10% and new geometries were not chemically meaningful to pursue. In H1·PEN, a 50:50 disorder of the sulphur was found. As the freely refined site occupancies gave a ca 50:50 disorder, the ratio was fixed to that value."
4,Powder X-ray diffraction,2.3 Powder X-ray diffraction Powder X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The sample was ground to a fine powder and loaded onto a zero background silicon sample holder. The spectrum was run from 2θ values of 4° to 40°.
5,Thermogravimetric analysis,2.4 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermal analyses were performed on a TA Q500 instrument from 25 to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a purge gas of dry nitrogen flowing at 60 ml min−1 for comparison of the percentage mass loss with the expected compound. All samples were dried on filter paper and placed in an open crucible for thermogravimetric analysis. Sample masses varied from 2 to 5 mg.
6,Competition experiments,2.5 Competition experiments The selectivity of the host for a particular isomer or compound pair was evaluated using crystal formation of the host with a 50:50 guest mixture using the procedure mentioned in the enclathration process above. Crystals were analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction as mentioned above.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Crystal structures of inclusions of host H1,"3.1 Crystal structures of inclusions of host H1 The group of H1 structures with alcohol guests (ethanol (EtOH), 1-butanol (BuOH), 2-methyl-1-propanol (MePrOH), 1-pentanol (PeOH) and 4-methylbenzoylalcohol (MeBeOH) is summarised in Table 1, all crystallising in space group P 1 ¯ with Z = 1. The second group of structures for H1, with carbonyl functionality guests, (dimethylformamide (DMF), 3-pentanone (PEN), 2-hexanone (HEX), pinacolone (PIN) and 4-methylcyclohexanone (MCH)), summarised in Table 2, show a more diverse system of crystallisation symmetry. All inclusion compounds crystallised with a 1:2 host:guest stoichiometry with the exception of H1·PeOH, where the host:guest ratio was 1:1. The structure of the H1·alcohol crystals are similar and the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 H1·2BuOH, is typical of these structures. The main and common structural feature of the H1·alcohol structures are (1) the two neighbouring hydrogen bonded H1 molecules forming the amide tetramer [32] and (2) the two guests hydrogen bonded to the free terminal hydrogen of the NH2 group. The common interactions in these structures can be described by synthons [33–36] I to IV (Fig. 1). The two neighbouring hosts interact with each other via synthon I and II, which may be described with graph sets R 2 2 8 and R 4 2 8 respectively, forming an amide tetramer. The dimerised hosts form synthon III (discrete hydrogen bond D 1 1 3 ) with the guest also interacting via its OH group with the S of a neighbouring host (synthon IV). The primary amides may control the structure of crystal nucleation sites, as the same hydrogen bond pattern is characteristic of this series of compounds [37]. The other four H1·alcohol structures have a similar set of hydrogen bonds which are shown in the Electronic Supplementary Information (Fig. S1) with the list of interactions shown in Table 3 . As in the discussion on H1·2BuOH, the four hydrogen bonding motifs are shown by the same key as Fig. 1. The importance of S⋯H interactions were highlighted recently by Pavan et al. [38] who explored the nature of these hydrogen bonds with the thiol group exhibiting both donor and acceptor properties. In this study the nature of the O–H⋯S interactions were examined showing the weak hydrogen bond accepting ability of sulphur, with a smaller Pauling electronegativity than that of oxygen (2.5 versus 3.5) [39]. In our case S⋯H interactions ( d ≤ 2.9 Å for S⋯H and angle O–H⋯S between 140° and 180°) were investigated in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [40,41] and mean values determined from the obtained 178 hits. The values of our current O–H⋯S bonds ( d1 = 0.84 Å, d2 = 2.49 Å and d3 = 3.30 Å) fit the CSD mean values. The mean O–H⋯S angle for our structures of 167.7° was consistent with the CSD mean of 163.1°. Our hydrogen bond distances and angles are within the ranges found in the reported structures of a hydrogen bond from an organic alcohol to the sulphur of a thiocyanato transition metal complex. This emphasised the importance of the O–H⋯S hydrogen bonds in the formation of the H1·alcohol inclusion compounds. (Graphic of distributions of sulphur bonds found in the CSD given in the Electronic Supplementary Information (Fig. S2)). In the H1·carbonyl crystals, a similar amide tetramer links two neighbouring host molecules together in a similar way to the H1·alcohol structures, but resulting in layers of the hosts. Discrete hydrogen bond labelled III in Fig. 2 shows the interaction between the host and guest. The hydrogen bond data is shown in Table 4 with Fig. 2 showing the diagrammatical format for H1·2PIN which is similar for the formats of all the H1·carbonyl structures, which are given in the Electronic Supplementary Information (Fig. S3), using the same coding as that in Fig. 2. In the five H1·alcohol crystals the host forms columns via the formation of the amide tetramer. The guests form two hydrogen bonds (N–H⋯O and O–H⋯S). The hydrogen bonded host of H1·2BuOH is shown along [1 0 0] in Fig. 3 (a) forming 1D parallel columns. Hydrogen bonding is shown in red between the host molecules as discussed in Fig. 1. No hydrogen bonding occurs between the bands. This packing is representative for all H1·alcohol structures. The packing of H1·carbonyl structures differs from those of the H1·alcohol structures in two ways. In H1·2DMF no intramolecular hydrogen bonding is evident and the host forms 2D hydrogen bonded sheets with hydrogen bonding along axis b between host molecules (Fig. 3(b)). In H1·2PIN (Fig. 3(c)) the hosts hydrogen bond to each other similarly to H1·alcohols but the columns are shifted relative to each other, presenting a 1D off-set pattern. In the packing of the clathrates, the alcohols and DMF fill voids along the a axis, whereas the other four carbonyls fill the space in layers between the sheets of hosts as illustrated in Fig. 4 . Packing density of the crystals, specified by k = Z · V 0 / V , and also known as the “coefficient of molecular packing”, in which V0 , the molecular volume, was calculated from the atomic radii and valence angles using X-Seed [28], Z the number of molecules in the cell and V the cell volume [42]. In Table 5 , parameters affecting the packing factor (PF*) or packing coefficient of each crystal are listed. For the H1·alcohols the values vary from 67% (H1·PeOH) to 81% (H1·2MeBeOH) and the latter larger value can be reasoned by the π⋯π interaction formed between the aromatic MeBeOH guest and the nicotinamide ligand with an average ring distance of 3.45 Å. This is relatively short and suggests strong interactions between the aromatic rings of the host and guest [43]. Void analysis was done in Mercury (3.8) [31] using a probe radius of 1.2 Å and grid spacing of 0.8 Å. The percentage guest accessible void for each clathrate is shown in Table 5. The packing factor (PF*) for the H1·carbonyls, ranging from 66 (H1·2MCH) to 69% (H1·2DMF), is in agreement with coefficients for the majority of crystals. The percentage guest accessible void ranges from 21% (DMF), the smallest guest, to 40% (MCH), the largest guest. All the guests except PIN and MCH were disordered hence there was enough space in the structure for the guest to allocate different positions. The void analysis can be seen in Fig. 5 with H1·2BuOH in (a); H1·2DMF in (b). In Fig. 5(c) the intercalate structure is emphasised in H1·2PIN by red arrows which point to crossing columns."
9,Comparison of thermal stability and structural features of H1·alcohol and H1·carbonyl structures,"3.2 Comparison of thermal stability and structural features of H1·alcohol and H1·carbonyl structures The crystal structures of the two sets of clathrates obtained, firstly with alcohol guests and secondly with guests with carbonyl functionalities, illustrated how the architecture of the host compound is flexible in the design of the inclusion compound. In the case of the alcohols the guests were present in voids as shown in Fig. 5 but the carbonyl guests were present in layers between the host channels. DMF, however, differed, as it presented itself in voids rather than layers. The crystal structure was more similar to the alcohol inclusions than the carbonyl inclusions. Apart from the difference in packing, there was a significant difference in the hydrogen bonding between the host and guest. The alcohol guests formed two hydrogen bonds, a N–H⋯O bond as well as an O–H⋯S bond. Even though the hydrogen bond involving sulphur as the acceptor is weaker than one with an oxygen acceptor, the effect of two bonds may lead to a higher temperature of desolvation for the alcohol inclusion compared with its analogous carbonyl. The temperatures of desolvation were determined from TGA profiles in which the peak of the differential curve located the temperature at which the kinetics of desorption was at its maximum. Clear examples of TGA profiles are shown in Fig. 6 . The desolvation temperatures were compared with the boiling points of each guest. This is shown in Table 6 and the differences between these two temperatures are designated. A range of different temperatures were observed and comparisons are discussed here. The analogous pair of PeOH and PEN are shown highlighted in orange. The difference between boiling point and temperature of desolvation for the alcohol is 5 °C higher than that of the ketone. Two features of the crystal structures were considered in this discussion. Firstly, the alcohols were more effectively captured in the host:guest inclusion compounds and were held by two hydrogen bonds. However, the hydrogen bonding in the carbonyl compounds was less significant as only one H-bond between the carbonyl group and the amide functional group was present. Secondly, we argue that the packing difference between the alcohol inclusion compounds and the carbonyl structures produces more efficient entrapment as the alcohols fill voids in their structures. The carbonyls are present in channels between the host layers and their release would be easier because they are only bound by one hydrogen bond. The porosity of these structures as defined by Barbour [44] would indicate that the tubulate format of the crystal structure shows continuous pores present in the columns between the host framework. The higher temperatures required to release the guests from these structures, as shown in Table 6, substantiates the above reasoning in our discussion of two of the physical properties of the inclusion compounds we have considered."
10,Selectivity,"3.3 Selectivity Differentiation for one guest over another by the Werner complex was considered for several pairs of guests with similar physical properties. Successful results were obtained in two cases, in which H1 differentiated between two guests. The first was the selection of 1-butanol from a 50:50 mixture of 1-butanol and 2-pentanol. The properties of these two alcohols are similar and are shown in Table 7 . The second observation was the selection of 4-methylcyclohexanone from a 50:50 mixture of 3- and 4-methylcyclohexanone. These organic isomers are used in the food industry as flavourants and occur naturally in peppermint and buchu oils. The properties of these two compounds are also shown in Table 7. The pairs of guests show similar, if not the same, boiling points and densities. This selectivity is a valuable observation for difficult classical differentiation. Although it has previously been shown that selectivity in hydrogen-bonded host frameworks can be enhanced by altering the size of the pillars in the host structure [17,45], we have found positive results for selectivity by H1 without any changes to its size. This adds a further advantage to the molecular architecture of this Werner complex and gives strength in our studies of clathrates with these characteristics."
11,Crystal structures of inclusions of H2,"3.4 Crystal structures of inclusions of H2 The second host, H2, with four isonicotinamide ligands, has similar hydrogen bonding capabilities to those of H1 but the para-positioned amide group prevents the formation of intramolecular H-bonds between the ligands of the same host and promotes the hydrogen bond formation with neighbouring molecules. In the three crystal structures analysed, the host included the solvent/s used for solution crystallisation and/or the ligand was included. The synthesis of these compounds yielded some hydrated compounds. This was serendipitous because no special precautions were taken to dry the solvents. The host:guest ratio of the first clathrate, H2·EtOH·0.4H2O, was confirmed by single crystal analysis and by thermal gravimetric means. Crystallisation of H2 from 95% EtOH yielded two types of crystal, easily distinguishable by their appearance. The purple H2·3H2O and blue H2·2INic·EtOH crystals were formed from the same crystallisation mixture of host and ethanol guest; the latter an example of self-inclusion of the ligand in the structure. The crystal data of these three H2 inclusions are summarised in Table 8 and diagrams of the structures are shown in Fig. 7 . The hydrogen bonded H2 hosts do not form layers or columns as in the structures of inclusions by H1, but the host matrix can be described as a hydrogen bonded network (Fig. 7(a)). In the H2·EtOH·0.4H2O structure three amide dimers are formed each represented by graph set R 2 2 8 , labelled I in the figure. Hydrogen bonding between the guest and host are shown by II between donor N8 and acceptor O5 of ethanol and the second interaction III is a unique hydrogen bond between O5–H5⋯S1¤. Other discrete hydrogen bonds occur between nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and interact with another four different host molecules. From the set of interactions in this structure, it was found that the supramolecular unit was made up of eight host molecules. Details of the hydrogen bond parameters are given in Table 9 . In H2·3H2O, the amide dimer foundation is disrupted. The water molecules form a chain between two rows of host molecules (Fig. 7(b)). Label I indicates the host–guest hydrogen bond O2#–H2O#⋯O1#. These bonds form the intermediary means of forming bands of the host. Guest–guest hydrogen bonds are shown by label II and are indicated O2#–H2O#⋯O3#. These H-bonds form a chain along c that is represented by the motif C 1 1 3 . Discrete intermolecular H-bonds between N10 and O1¤ are shown by III in Fig. 7(b) and the unique bond between N10 and S2¥ labelled IV. The host bands interact with neighbouring bands via bonds III and IV. Host H2 self-included two isonicotinamide ligands as well as EtOH solvent into the clathrate H2·2INic·EtOH. The amide dimer formation was again disrupted with the isonicotinamide guests bonding to each other via an amide H-bond, (Fig. 7(c)), labelled I, between N13 and O6. The nitrogen donates via its second hydrogen to an oxygen of the host molecule, shown by label II, between N14–H14A⋯O4. A third hydrogen bond between the aromatic nitrogen of the isonicotinamide and the amide nitrogen of the host is labelled III, with two sites N8Δ–H8AΔ ⋯N11 and N9@–H9A@⋯N12. Host oxygen O2 accepts protons from two donor atoms, one the functional –OH group on the ethanol guest, labelled IV with the depiction O8–H8⋯O2Δ; and the second from the amide group on the nearby host, labelled V and with atoms N9–H9B⋯O2Δ engaged in the interaction. Data for all hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 9. The packing of structure H2·EtOH·0.4H2O is shown in Fig. 8 . The host architecture with the molecules arranged in a zigzag or herringbone pattern gives a lacework design (Fig. 8(a)) with the hydrogen bonds linking the host molecules to form a 3-dimensional network. The structure (Pbcn) shows a spiral of molecules occurring along a two-fold screw axis with two glide planes. Hydrogen bonding occurs between molecules above and below the plane. Eight molecules engage to form a supramolecular network via amide dimers (Fig. 8(a)). Fig. 8(b) describes the guest packing into the voids between the host molecules, also shown down [0 0 1] with EtOH in orange and water in blue spacefill model, all molecules without hydrogens. Fig. 8(c) shows the void analysis of these spaces. Guest accessible void analysis (using probe radius of 1.2 Å and grid spacing of 0.8 Å), gave a fraction of 10% (677.32 Å3). The tubulate structure H2·3H2O is shown in Fig. 9 (a), with the host molecules in an intertwined herringbone pattern. In Fig. 9(b), the water guests in channels hold the hosts together with H-bonds in the channel of size 12 Å × 10 Å. These measurements were made from atom to atom hence the van der Waals radii were not taken into account. The void analysis of the structure gave a guest accessible void percentage of 8% (262.44 Å3). The packing of structure H2·2INic·EtOH is shown in Fig. 10 (a) with the metal complexes linking through four unique N–H⋯O amide-amide hydrogen bonds to form sheets of hosts with the hydrogen bonding shown in red. Ethanols in orange and isonicotinamides in purple spacefill models fill the channels between the hosts in Fig. 10 (b) and these channels are shown by orange diamonds (A) (size 11 Å × 11 Å) and purple hourglass-shapes (B) (20 Å long, 13 Å wide at the ends and 4 Å wide at the waist) respectively in Fig. 10(c). These measurements have been made without taking the van der Waals radii into account with the guest accessible void percentage of 35% (773.57 Å3). The packing data for the three H2 clathrates is shown in Table 10 . The packing factor (PF*) ranges from 68 to 72% and this relates well to the majority of crystal packing coefficients. The percentage guest accessible void has a larger range from 8% in H2·3H2O to 35% in the case of H2·2INic·EtOH. The spacing between the host and guests is relatively small in the first two cases (H2·EtOH·0.4H2O and H2·3H2O) but much larger in the structure of H2·2INic·EtOH. The porous nature of this structure is also shown by the columns of guests between the host framework."
12,Crystal structure of inclusion of H3,"3.5 Crystal structure of inclusion of H3 The structure of the complex with a combination of the two ligands, nicotinamide and isonicotinamide, in a mixed-ligand complex, containing both ligands in trans pairs, called H3 is shown in Scheme 1. The crystallographic data for the structure of H3·0.2MeOH·H2O, is given in Table 11 . The compound crystallises in a general position in space group P21 /n with one host, one water and 0.2 methanol in the asymmetric unit. A complex format of hydrogen bonding occurred between the two ligands (Table 12 ), with the nicotinamide functional groups bonding via amide dimers to the nicotinamides of two other host molecules (N7–H7AN⋯O3$ and N9$ –H9BN$⋯O1; and N9–H9BN⋯O1* and N7* –H7AN*⋯O3), both with graph sets R 2 2 8 , shown by label I in Fig. 11 . N7 is the donor in the bond between the host and water guest and the atoms involved are N7–H7BN⋯O4¥. In the case of isonicotinamide, the hydrogen bonds do not form amide dimers but rather a number of discrete interactions, firstly the amide H-bonds N7¥–H7BN¥⋯O4 and N9Ŧ–H9ANŦ⋯O2. Secondly, the interaction between N10 and the water oxygen (N10–H10B⋯O6Δ) and thirdly, N10 donating the proton to the sulphur of a neighbouring host N10–H10A⋯S1£ . The graph sets of the last discrete hydrogen bonds are all D 1 1 3 . Although a packing factor of 69.5% was realised, a guest accessible void of 3% was the lowest of these crystal structures."
13,Conclusion,"Three Werner hosts with hydrogen bonding functionalities, dubbed as ‘sticky’ ligands, were synthesised and inclusion compounds with selected alcohols, carbonyls and water were elucidated. The influence of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups on the molecular framework was investigated and packing factors calculated. Host H1 Ni(NCS)2(nicotinamide)4 with five alcohol guests (ethanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol and 4-methylbenzoylalcohol) all presented similar packing arrangements in the space group P 1 ¯ . Host molecules interacted through hydrogen bonding of amide tetramers with guests in voids between the host columns. Hydrogen bonds between the amide nitrogen of the ligand and the guest –OH as well as between the guest –OH and thiocyanato sulphur were observed. The structure with the aromatic alcohol MeBeOH, has the highest packing factor. However, it also demonstrates π⋯π interactions between the aromatic ring of MeBeOH with that of the nicotinamide ligand. Different packing arrangements were perceived for H1 with the guests with carbonyl functional groups (dimethylformamide, 3-pentanone, 2-hexanone, pinacolone and 4-methylcyclohexanone). The hosts formed sheets of molecular bands bonded via amide tetramers with the guests intercalated within the layers with hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl functional group and the amide groups. No sulphur atoms were involved in hydrogen bonding. H1·2HEX, H1·2PEN, H1·2PIN and H1·2MCH were isomorphous and showed packing similarities. H1·2DMF in space group P 1 ¯ , showed closer similarities to the structures of H1 with the alcohols. The host in each of these two sets of structures forms a predictable framework leading to architectures with analogous patterns. The guest desolvation stability (TDS – TBP) of the structures with alcohol guests and those with analogous carbonyl guests, was inferred by the difference in their hydrogen bonds. Alcohols form two H-bonds between host and guest, whereas carbonyls displayed only one hydrogen bond. Thorough observations were made in the comparison of packing efficiency and intimacy of interactions. In two cases, selectivity was achieved for the separation of a pair of alcohols and a pair of carbonyls, both with similar physical properties leading to challenging separation routes. 1-butanol was selected from a 50:50 mixture of 1-butanol and 2-pentanol and 4-methylcyclohexanone from an equivalent mixture of 3- and 4-methylcyclohexanone. The positive discrimination characteristics of host H1 have given possibilities for future industrial prospects. The most important difference between hosts H1 and H2 was the lack of amide-amide interactions between the H2 molecules. However, interdigitated herringbone arrangements were realized in the three H2 packings, with the guests occupying voids in one and channels in two structures. These channels were the largest in the H2·2INic·EtOH compound as the free isonicotinamides occupied space in the shape of an hourglass. The volumes of the space available for the guests differed between the three structures with H2·EtOH·0.4H2O and H2·3H2O having similar space and H2·2INic·EtOH having a large amount of space for the isonicotinamide and ethanol guests. In the H2 structures a network is formed through hydrogen bonding between carbonyl oxygens and amides as well as between host and guest. The mixed-ligand H3 structure showed predictable amide dimer hydrogen bonding between the nicotinamide ligands but formation of discrete hydrogen bonds between the isonicotinamide ligands. Hydrogen bonding of the ligands in Werner clathrates encourages the inclusion of a wide range of guests which hydrogen bond via their alcohol or carbonyl functional groups. The network of hosts formed porous materials for inclusion, giving the advantage of flexibility in pore size and nature with the ability to accommodate guest molecules and separate isomers. The packing found in three of the structures indicated a more efficient packing arrangement verified by the void analysis performed. The importance of the ligand design was emphasised on considering the outcome whereby host Ni(NCS)2(nicotinamide)4 gave a predictable and robust framework yet host Ni(NCS)2(isonicotinamide)4 presents a large variety of frameworks ranging from spiral format to herringbone arrangement. In the mixed-ligand complex the prominence of the amide dimer formation via hydrogen bonds between nicotinamide ligands was emphasised, yet the isonicotinamide ligands shows only discrete hydrogen bonds."
