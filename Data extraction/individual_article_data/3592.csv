0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic feedstock is the most abundant resource in nature. It is reported that yields of lignocellulosic feedstock residues exceed about 220 billion tons in the world, the value are equivalent to the energy of 60–80 billion tons crude oil. In China alone, the annual yield of biomass wastes exceed about 0.7 billion tons [1,2]. Today, most of the biomass residuals are disposed of by direct burning owing to lack of effective utilization, which also causes serious environmental pollution. Hence, it is of significance to deal with the wastes both for the effectively utilization of lignocellulosic feedstock and for the prevention of environmental pollution. Hydrogen is considered as a promising energy source for the future due to its clean, renewable and efficient energy resource. At present, the dominant cost element in fermentative hydrogen production is the substrate, though some fermentable starch and sucrose are easily obtained from agricultural by-products. Extension of this fermentation process through utilization of cheaper and abundant substrates such as lignocellulosic feedstock offers a great potential for reducing the production cost and increasing the use of hydrogen as a fuel alternative. However, most studies of bio-H2 production so far have been limited to using pure carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose and starch [3–7]. Little information is available on the feasibility of using biomass containing crude lignocellulose such as corn stover [8–11]. Lignocellulosic feedstock consists of mainly glucose and xylose, strains that can effectively degrade glucose and xylose are important for development of renewable H2 production process. The strain T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 isolated by Ren et al. showed great potential conversion of glucose and xylose to hydrogen [12]. However, the potential performance of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 on lignocellulose hydrolysate has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to present our findings on the performance of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 for H2 production from lignocellulose hydrolysate using corn stover as representative substrate. Firstly, the processes of hydrolysis for increasing fermentative sugars were optimized. Then, the hydrolysate was used as carbon source for hydrogen production. In addition, parallel fermentation experiments with sugars typically present in such hydrolysate were carried out for comparison."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and media,"2.1 Microorganism and media The strain, T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, is a glucose–xylose fermenting strain isolated by Ren et al. [12]. It was grown at 60°C in a modified MB medium [13] containing (L−1): 1.0gNH4Cl, 3.0g K2HPO4, 1.5g KH2PO4, 0.5g MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0g NaCl, 0.2g KCl, 0.5g cysteine–HCl, 2.0g yeast extract, 2.0g tryptone, 10g xylose, 1ml trace element solution, 1ml vitamin solution [14]. The strain at its exponential-growth phase was used as the inoculum."
3,Pretreatment of corn stover,"2.2 Pretreatment of corn stover The corn stover used in this study was collected from Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China. The raw material was firstly sieved using a laboratory hammer mill to obtain a chip size 2–10mm and after which the raw material was dried at 105°C to constant weight. Before enzymatic hydrolysis, corn stover sample at a solid loading of 10% (w/v) was delignified with 2% NaOH (v/v, based on the water content of the corn stover) at 80°C for 2h to increase the exposure of polysaccharides to hydrolytic enzymes. The solid cellulosic residues were collected and washed thoroughly with water to neutral pH, then dried at 105°C to constant weight."
4,Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover,"2.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover Batch enzymatic hydrolysis was performed in 250ml flasks containing 100ml mixture of 0.05M citrate buffer solution (pH 4.8) and solid substrate. Commercial cellulase (Sigma, >0.3Umg−1 solid, derived from Aspergillus niger) and xylanase (Imperial Jade Bio-technology Cooperation, Ningxia, China, ≥3,000,000Uml−1) were used for enzymatic hydrolysis. In the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, the effects of different cellulase dosage (10–30Ug−1 substrate) and supplement with xylanase (30Ug−1 substrate) were determined for the maximal hydrolysis yield. All hydrolysis were performed at 50°C for 72h at solid concentration of 2%. Samples were taken from the reaction mixture periodically for sugar analysis. The hydrolysate containing 11.2gL−1 of glucose, 3.4gL−1 of xylose and 0.5gL−1 arabinose was diluted to yield a supernatant of reducing sugar concentrations of 7.5gL−1 glucose, 2.2gL−1 xylose and 0.3gL−1 arabinose for subsequent use."
5,Hydrogen production in batch culture,"2.4 Hydrogen production in batch culture Hydrogen production of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was performed in 100ml flakes with working volume of 50ml using modified MB medium aforementioned. Except carbon sources, all the other nutrients in the media maintained constant (Table 1 ). The inoculums acquired during the exponential-growth phase were added at 2% v/v. In batch tests, cell density, pH, residual carbon substrate concentration, quantity and compositions of produced biogas, and metabolic products in liquid phase were determined. All fermentation experiments were performed at 60°C, initial pH 7.0 and all treatments were carried out in triplicate to check data reproducibility."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contained in raw material and pretreated solid fractions were measured following the methods described by Goering and Van Soest [15]. The initial sugar compositions of the hydrolysate, as well as the sugar consumption during fermentation were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (LC-10A, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Cell density in the liquid medium was monitored by measuring turbidity at 600nm. For carbon balance calculations, the elemental composition of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was assumed to be C5H7NO2. The volatile fatty acids and alcohols were detected by gas chromatography (4890D, Agilent Cooperation, USA). The gases were measured by GC (GC-SC2) (Shanghai Analytical Apparatus, Shanghai, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The yield of enzymatic hydrolysis and molar carbon balance were calculated as follows: hydrolysis yield (%)=reducing sugar (g)×0.9×100/polysaccharides in substrate (g); molar carbon balance (%)=output total molar carbon (total molar carbon contained in end products)/input total molar carbon (consumed sugars)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Pretreatment,"3.1 Pretreatment The composition of the raw and pretreated corn stover is presented in Table 2 . The data of raw material are in general agreement with the results obtained by others [16–19]. NaOH pretreatment resulted in efficient delignification of corn stover. Approximately 70% of the lignin was removed. However, in the process of delignification, 25.6% of hemicellulose was also removed."
9,Enzymatic hydrolysis,"3.2 Enzymatic hydrolysis Pretreated corn stover samples at solid content of 2% were hydrolyzed by cellulase at pH 4.8, 50°C for 72h. To determine the optimal conditions of hydrolysis, cellulase was tested at various dosages (Fig. 1 ). At increasing concentrations of cellulase (10–25Ug−1 substrate), a significantly higher hydrolysis yield was observed. Further increasing in cellulase dosage did not produce a corresponding increase in hydrolysis yield. The optimal cellulase dosage was identified as 25Ug−1 substrate. Cellubiose was not detected out in the hydrolysate, showing the presence of cellobiase in cellulase, so there is no need to add cellobiase to the hydrolysis system. Whereas, a low amount of xylose presented in cellulosic hydrolysate, indicating relatively low xylanase activity in cellulase. In order to increase the hydrolysis yield, xylanase was added with cellulase during hydrolysis. It showed that the hydrolysis yield increased from 62.5% with just only cellulase to 81.2% with additional xylanase to cellulase and the total reducing sugar yield was booted from 11.7gL−1 to 15.1gL−1 (Table 3 ). Xylanase supplementation promoted the hydrolysis yield supporting the hypothesis that residual hemicellulose interferes with cellulose hydrolysis. Increased hemicellulose hydrolysis due to supplementation of xylanase lead to increased accessibility of cellulase to cellulose and therefore improves cellulose hydrolysis."
10,Hydrogen production from sugars,"3.3 Hydrogen production from sugars Prior to utilization of corn stover hydrolysate for growth and H2 production, a set of experiments was carried out using the synthetic medium supplemented with analytical-grade sugars as carbon source to determine the fermentative behavior of the T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. Glucose, xylose, and a mixture of glucose, xylose and arabinose were applied at a fixed total sugar quantity (10gL−1). The concentrations of glucose, xylose and arabinose in the mixture were at the same levels as found in the corn stover hydrolysate (see Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2 , when xylose was the carbon source present in the medium, consumption of this sugar was somewhat slower than consumption of glucose (Fig. 2A and B). When a mixture of sugars was used as carbon source (Fig. 2C), glucose, xylose and arabinose all can be consumed although the organism showed preference for glucose utilization. H2 production starts from early exponential-phase of cell growth and maximum H2 production rate was in the range of 10.7–12.9mmolL−1 h−1 (Table 4 ). The final yield of hydrogen in the mixture was not distinctively different from the single sugar medium. T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 produced H2 through acetate and butyrate as main end products and low amounts of ethanol and butanol (Table 4). At the onset of the stationary phase, glucose and xylose in the single sugar medium or in the mix sugar medium were not completely consumed, it might be caused by the low pH of fermentation liquid (pH 3.6–3.8, data not shown) owing to the accumulation of VFAs and inhibited the substrate utilization. The molar carbon balances before and after fermentation could be almost completed in culture condition of A, B and C (Table 5 ). It explained that the amount of CO2 was not measured, but was assumed to be produced with H2 at 100% biogas."
11,Hydrogen production from corn stover hydrolysate,"3.4 Hydrogen production from corn stover hydrolysate T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 grew well on corn stover hydrolysate containing glucose and xylose as the main monosaccharide and reached a similar optical density as on simulated medium (Fig. 3 ). Glucose consumption, which was comparable to that on simulated medium, occurred simultaneously with the consumption of xylose and arabinose on hydrolysate. H2 yield was slightly higher on hydrolysate (108.5mmolL−1) than on simulated medium (100.1mmolL−1). This is possibly owing to the presence of water-soluble oligosaccharides in the hydrolysate, which were not taken into account during our calculations, but which may have been metabolized to hydrogen. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 11.2mmolL−1 h−1 in hydrolysate, which was comparable to the production rate in simulated medium (10.7–12.9mmolL−1 h−1) (Table 4). Results on the carbon balances for the fermentation of hydrolysate were presented in Table 5. It was found that the carbon balances in the synthetic medium could be almost 100%. However, the carbon balance was not complete in the hydrolysate, the amount of carbon in formation products was higher than the consumption carbon. This maybe caused by the interference of unidentified components in the hydrolysate so as to result in an incomplete mass balance."
12,Conclusions,"This study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a lignocellulose-to-H2 process combining enzymatic hydrolysis and dark fermentation by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. At the enzymatic hydrolysis process, corn stover was hydrolyzed by cellulase with optimal dosage of 25Ug−1 substrate. Furthermore, supplement cellulase with 30Ug−1 substrate xylanase enhanced hydrolysis yield from 62% to 81.2%. At the following fermentation process, strain W16 grew well on hydrolysate and reached a similar optical density and maximum H2 production rate as on simulated medium, although H2 yield was slightly higher on hydrolysate. The molar carbon balances in the synthetic medium could be almost 100%. However, carbon balances were not complete in hydrolysate. This maybe caused by the interference of unidentified components in the hydrolysate. These findings indicate the potential of using T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 for high-yield conversion of lignocellulose into bio-H2 to integrate with enzymatic hydrolysis."
