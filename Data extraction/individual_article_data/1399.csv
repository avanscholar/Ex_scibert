0,Introduction,"Intelligent packaging was defined in European law as a kind of packaging that can monitor food and its surroundings [1]. Kit.L. Yam [2] proposed that intelligent packaging is a kind of packaging system that has intelligent functions such as detection, sensing, recording, and tracking, which can improve food safety, guarantee food quality, provide information, extend shelf life and give early warning about possible spoilage. It's different from active packaging that the main function of intelligent packaging is to detect and indicate the condition of food inside, while active packaging generally protects the quality of internal food through the added materials which have antioxidant or antibacterial activity. There have been a lot of researches about intelligent packaging focusing on packaging different types of foods. Anthocyanins were used to combine with substance which contain chitosan, starch and polyvinyl alcohol, the different films prepared by using two substance of the matrix and anthocyanins showed good compatibility and were used to monitor pork freshness [3], another research which extract anthocyanins from blueberry residue had shown the potential of intelligent packaging by evaluating the application of intelligent packaging for monitoring not just solid but liquid foods [4]. In addition, there are also researches of intelligent packaging that detected the spoilage of chicken beast [5] and fish [6]. Except for research on materials and applications, research about model-based design of intelligent packaging [7] has been studied, which brings new idea about mathematical modeling for intelligent packaging. Until now, most of the researches about intelligent packaging are based on anthocyanins, only a little part of them used curcumin. It's because anthocyanins can be extracted from variety kinds of plants such as black chokeberry [8] and purple sweet potato [9], and it is water-soluble, which means it is easily to be used in preparation of films. In addition to anthocyanin, curcumin has also been used as an active material of intelligent packaging in some researches. Although the color change of curcumin is not as diverse as anthocyanin, it's reaction to alkaline is more clear. Curcumin is a bright yellow hydrophobic polyphenol extracted from Curcuma longa L. [10]. Curcumin has fatty chain, phenolic group and enol with high polarity, the carbon chain in middle separates the hydrophilic phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends, so it is sparingly soluble in water as only 11 ng/mL [11]. And it is soluble in organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol [12]. In recent research, curcumin was added to prepare intelligent packaging such as a detector for the quality of shrimp [13–14] and an indicator for the pork spoilage [15]. In a study about smart packaging, curcumin was added to simulate its contact with liquid and semisolid foods, which showed that curcumin can be an excellent indicator to detect the pH change of food [16]. However, curcumin is unstable. When being exposed to light, curcumin will degrade into vanillin, ferulic acid and ferulic aldehyde. Curcumin also breaks down rapidly under alkaline conditions, in which trans-6-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2, 4-diketone-5-hexenal is the main product, vanillin, ferulic acid and ferulic aldehyde are the secondary products [17]. Study has shown that the color of films changed under light and room temperature even when it was not used to package food [18]. And most researches just simply added curcumin into films without further treatment. Thus curcumin may lose its functions during the process of preparation and storage due to heat, light, and oxidation. The principle of intelligent packaging is to show the information of food through the color change, so the instability of curcumin may lead to a result that the intelligent packaging is not accurate to indicate the quality of food. In order to improve the stability of curcumin, Pickering emulsion could be used to protect curcumin. Pickering emulsion is a kind of emulsion stabilized by solid colloidal particles. It was first discovered by Ramsden in 1903 [19], but Pickering first published the phenomenon in 1907 [20]. Usually, the emulsion refers to two immiscible liquids, one of which is dispersed in another [21]. In the process of production, the emulsion needs to add stabilizers such as thickeners and emulsifiers to improve its stability. Compared with the traditional emulsion, Pickering emulsion has higher environmental stability [22], the reason is that the stabilization mechanism of traditional emulsion is to reduce the interfacial tension between the two interfaces through the adsorption of surfactant molecules, while Pickering emulsion is stabilized by increasing steric hindrance to change the interface properties or changing the rheological properties of continuous phase [23–24]. The stability of Pickering emulsion is affected by particle concentration, pH value, surface charge and other factors [25]. Therefore, the stability can be regulated by modifying particles and adjusting environmental conditions. Usually, the size of the solid particles Pickering emulsion used is fairly small, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the size of the droplets. The sorts of particles mainly include polysaccharide such as starch and chitosan, protein, and some small molecule particles [26]. Pickering emulsion can be used to stabilize environmentally sensitive materials (pH, temperature, optical, electrical, magnetic, etc.). One of the particle Pickering emulsion used is the Octenyl Succinic Acid Modified Starch (OSAS), it is an esterification product of starch and octenyl succinic anhydride, the esterification reaction can introduce both hydrophilic and oleophilic groups, in which the carboxyl group is hydrophilic and the alkenyl group is lipophilic. Therefore, the long chain of polysaccharides in OSA-S can expand on the oil-water interface to form a stable and continuous film, which prevents the particles of the dispersed phase from aggregating or separating from each other, so the OSA-S can maintain stability of emulsion and thus be used in Pickering emulsion. Starch and polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) have been used as matrix in packaging since 1980 [27]. PVA can improve the physical properties of starch, and corn starch wihch has high amylose content has a good combination with PVA. In addition, both of starch and PVA are non-toxic and biodegradable, which is crucial for food packaging. They can protect the environment and bring the public a sense of food safety. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to load curcumin in OSA-S stabilized Pickering emulsion, which can protect curcumin, and thus prepare intelligent packaging for monitoring fish freshness. The mechanical, barrier, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the film prepared with curcumin solution and the film prepared with Pickering emulsion were compared. Finally, the two kinds of films were applied to monitor fish freshness. Compared with film prepared with curcumin solution, the film prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion had higher barrier, antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and stronger color change when being applied to indicate fish spoilage, these are beneficial to intelligent packaging."

In addition, 2 mL DPPH-ethanol solution and 2 mL ethanol were mixed as the blank. Then, the mixture was placed in dark for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C). Then the absorbance was determined at 517 nm by an UV–vis spectrophotometer. DPPH radical scavenging rate was calculated by formula: (1) DPP H s = A c − A s / A × 100 % where DPPHs stands for free radical scavenging rate (%), Ac stands for absorbance of each sample, As stands for absorbance of reference sample. It is measured every two days."

Significant differences were estimated at p ≤ 0. 05."
16,Results and discussion,
17,The color of curcumin at different pH,"3.1 The color of curcumin at different pH Curcumin solution was adjusted to different pH. Fig. 1 showed that the color of curcumin changed from yellow to red as the pH increased from 3. 0 to 10. 0. The color of the curcumin solution changed from yellow to orange as the solution changed from acidic to neutral (pH 3.0 to 7.0). As the solution became alkaline, the color turned to deep red. The microorganisms are responsible for the decomposition of most animal proteins, and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) will be produced when animal proteins decompose, which will change the pH of the food. Therefore curcumin can be used as a detector for food corruption [28]."
18,Mechanical properties,"3.2 Mechanical properties Table 2 showed the mechanical properties of films. With the addition of Pickering emulsion, the thickness of films increased, this is due to the retention of the OSA-S during heating. The thickness of the films is determined by the amount of solid particles the film liquid contained, therefore, more solid particles leads to thicker films. Compared with St-PVA and St-PVA-Cur, the EB and TS of films prepared with Pickering emulsion all decreased a lot, the addition of curcumin solution intensified the chemical bonds in the films while the addition of Pickering emulsion weaken them. The SEM image of Fig. 3 also showed that the OSA-S particles may not integrate with CS and PVA by chemical bonds but by hydrogen bonds, the phase separation and the existence of oil droplets also caused the decrease of mechanical properties. The phenomenon can be improved in subsequent experiments by using different solid particles."
19,Barrier properties,"3.3 Barrier properties Table 2 showed the WVP and OP of films. Unlike EB and TS, the addition of Pickering emulsion greatly improved the barrier properties. This is undoubtedly great benefit to the packaging. The WVP of St-PVA was 5.96 ± 0.06 while the St-PVA-Pickering and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur60 were 2.19 ± 0.55 and 2.01 ± 0.04, the OP of St-PVA was 2.97 ± 0.04 while the St-PVA-Pickering and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur60 were 1.21 ± 0.15 and 1.13 ± 0.26. The improvement of barrier properties comes from the increasing of the films thickness and the introduction of chemical groups. OSA-S provides alkenyl group which is hydrophobic, therefore the WVP of films prepared with Pickering emulsion decreased. The decreasing of OP is due to the formation of a network structures in the films, which blocks the passage of oxygen molecules. These are conducive to maintain the quality of the packaged food."
20,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy The Pickering emulsions and films were analyzed by FTIR to verify the chemical interactions (Fig. 2 ). In the spectra of Pickering emulsions (Fig. 2a), there was an obvious similar absorption band around 3400 cm−1, and the band of curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsions became stronger, indicating that the hydroxyl groups increased. The occurrence of two weak absorption bands at 2362 cm−1 and 2337 cm−1 were attributed to the free dimer carboxylic acid. The absorption peak presented at 1745 cm−1 was due to CO carbonyl group, the keto-enol tautomerism structure of curcumin enhanced the peak. The absorption peak at 1689 cm−1 was generated by the ene bond of curcumin. The absorption peak at 1107 cm−1 was generated by the stretching vibration of C-O-C on the α-1, 4 glycoside bond [29]. With the addition of curcumin, the peak gradually disappeared, indicating the combination of curcumin and starch. The three absorption peaks of 1022 cm−1, 879 cm−1 and 822 cm−1 gradually became evident with the increase of curcumin, which was caused by the bending vibration outside the CH plane of aromatics [30]. As shown in the FTIR spectra of films (Fig. 2b). The addition of curcumin virtually increased the intensity of all absorbance bands. The absorption band at 3674 cm−1 was the stretching vibration absorption of OH group, and the appearance of the band indicated that the addition of curcumin solution and Pickering emulsions increased the inter-molecular hydrogen bond. The absorption peaks of 2978 cm−1 and 2904 cm−1 were generated by the stretching vibration of aromatics and alkanes [9], and the peaks became obvious with the increasing of curcumin. The occurrence of weak absorption band at 2355 cm−1 was attributed to the free carboxylic acid dimer. The absorption peak of 1059 cm−1 assigned to the CH deformation of aromatic rings in curcumin. The absorption peak of 945 cm−1 was generated by the bending vibration outside the plane of olefin."
21,Scanning electron microscopy,"3.5 Scanning electron microscopy As shown in the SEM of films. Fig. 3 (a, b, c, d) showed that CS and PVA were tightly bound, which results in a well-uniform surface on both the surface and the cross-section of the films. The binding effect of amylose to PVA is stronger than amylopectin, so CS, which has high content of amylose, can bind to PVA well. The addition of glycerol can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with starch and hydroxyl groups of PVA and thus increase the tightness of bonding between molecules. A comparison of Fig. 3 (e, g) and Fig. 3 (i) leads to a conclusion that curcumin has been added to the films which is shown by the appeared spots on the surface of films with curcumin added. Fig. 3 (i) showed that the surface of the film prepared with Pickering emulsion was smooth, indicating that Pickering emulsion can be integrated into the film. With the addition of Pickering emulsion, the cross-section image of the films showed that there occurs holes in the films, which may result in a decrease in EB and TS of the films, it was also observed and shown in Table 2. This is caused by phase separation and the existence of oil droplets. Although the Pickering emulsion can be fixed into the films, there may exist a little chemical bonds between the CS, PVA and the Pickering emulsion, the Pickering emulsion is mainly interacted with CS and PVA by hydrogen bonds. Unfortunately, we didn't find another particle to make the Pickering emulsion and film matrix more compatible. Another research of our group has observed the similar situation that the addition of Pickering emulsion brings some holes to the film [31]."
22,Antioxidant activity,"3.6 Antioxidant activity As can be seen in Fig. 4 . The antioxidant activity of films decreased with the decomposition of curcumin during storage. It was easy to find that only films prepared with curcumin had antioxidant properties. Curcumin uses two propenyl groups as a skeleton, the benzene rings at both sides are attached to a phenolic hydroxyl group and a methoxy group respectively, while the propenyl is attached to a β-diketone (enol type) structure. The antioxidant activity of curcumin may comes from its phenolic hydroxyl and β-diketone, but there is still no clear definition about which one is the active center. Free radical of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has unsaturated electron will compete with other molecule for electrons. Curcumin can eliminate free radicals directly, thus curcumin has antioxidant activity. In curcumin, the enol and the heptanedione alkyl chain between two methoxyphenol rings contain a highly activated carbon atom, on which the H atom can be easily abstracted. While the hydrogen atoms on the two phenolic rings are more difficult to lose due to the formation of hydrogen bonds by their adjacent methoxy groups. So the DPPH radical can easily extract an H atom from the free hydroxyl group, which provides curcumin antioxidant activity [12]. Fig. 4 showed that the films' oxidation activity were different as soon as they were prepared. St-PVA-Pickering-Cur60 and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur120 had higher antioxidant activity than St-PVA-Cur. This is because the oxidation of curcumin in MCT oil mainly occurs at the oil-water interface [32], and the OSA-S particles Pickering emulsion used has the hydrophilic carboxylic groups and the oleophilic alkenyl groups, the chain of polysaccharides can unroll at the oil-water interface to form a stable, dense and continuous film. So Pickering emulsion can improve the interface thickness and greatly reduce the oxidation rate of curcumin. In addition, the progress of preparation involves heating and drying, and curcumin's instability causes it to decrease during the process of heating. While curcumin protected by Pickering emulsion was less affected. Antioxidant activity of films had a slight increase at the first day. During the progress of preparation, curcumin on the surface of films broke down, and the release of curcumin later led to an increase of antioxidant activity. With time change, the antioxidant activity of the films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion decreased significantly slower than St-PVA-Cur film. Although curcumin has excellent antioxidant activity, heating is an essential process in the process of preparation, which causes curcumin to be degraded, leading to the fact that the St-PVA-Cur film had less antioxidant activity than those films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion. And being exposed to light during the process of storage also causes the decrease of curcumin, while Pickering emulsion can also protect curcumin from light and reduce its loss."
23,Antimicrobial activity,"3.7 Antimicrobial activity Table 3 showed the antimicrobial activity of films. As a polyphenol, Curcumin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-tumor and other functions, so it can play a role in curing heart disease, cancer, tumor and so on. Therefore, it is often used in the field of clinical medicine [33]. Curcumin's antimicrobial activity comes from its ability to break down cell membranes, it can release cytoplasm, disrupt organelles and infect the life activities of cells. A hydrophobic substance of curcumin can directly act on the cell membrane of microorganisms, attack the phospholipids on the cell membrane, destroy the structure of cell membrane. Proteins, nucleic acids and other contents in the cell membrane will leak and the enzyme system of microorganisms will be damaged, eventually leading to the death of cells. It can be seen from Table 3 that only films with curcumin added had antibacterial activity. And because of the protection of Pickering emulsion, films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion had higher antimicrobial activity. It can also be seen in Table 3 that curcumin had an obvious effect on S. aureus and B. subtilis, which are Gram-positive (G+) bacterium. While E. coli which belongs to Gram-negative (G−) was less affected by curcumin. The membrane of G+ bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan and the membrane of gram-negative bacteria is composed of double phospholipid membrane [34], that's the reason why curcumin has a better inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria. Wang and Hualin Wang had observed the similar phenomenon [28,35]."
24,Application of pH indicator films,"3.8 Application of pH indicator films Fig. 5 showed the color change of films during the storage of Pangasius bocouti and Table 4 showed specific changes measured by a chromatic meter. St-PVA film was used as a control group. It can be seen intuitively from Fig. 5 that only the color of films with curcumin added changed with time. And the color of films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion were more pronounced. Fig. 5 (b) showed that the color of St-PVA-Cur changed from dark yellow to reddish-brown. While Fig. 5 (c, d) showed that the color changed from bright yellow to reddish-brown. The color of St-PVA-Cur (Fig. 5 b) and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur60 (Fig. 5 c) at the end (48 h) of the experiment were similar because the amount of curcumin they added were same. It can be predicted that the color of St-PVA-Pickering-Cur120 changed more distinct due to the extra added of curcumin. As shown in Table 4. The L* value of films were similar at first, indicating that all the films were equally bright. With time change, the L* value of St-PVA-Cur (b) and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur60 (c) had a slight decrease, while St-PVA-Pickering-Cur120 (d) decreased strongly, which means that the change of curcumin is the reason which affects the L* value. The a* value of films increased as time changed, showing the change of color to red. Films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion had stronger change about a* value than St-PVA-Cur (b), and St-PVA-Pickering-Cur120 (d) change more obvious than St-PVA-Pickering- Cur60 (c). The b* value shows the yellowness. That's the reason why the control group(St-PVA) 's b* value was near 18 and the others were 84. The b* value of St-PVA-Cur (b) almost had no change while b* value of films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion changed from near 83.5 to 56.0 and 57.3, making the color change of films more obvious (Fig. 5c, d). Fig. 6 showed that the pH and TVBN values of Pangasius bocouti increased with the increase of storage time. This is mainly caused by meat spoilage and protein decomposition. At room temperature (25 °C), the pH and TVBN values of fish were 8. 06 ± 0.015 and 8.26 ± 0.14 mg/100 g at first, and when time passed 12 h, pH values slightly increased to 8.08 ± 0.01, which caused the film's color to change little (Fig. 5, 12 h). When it came to 24 h, pH became 8. 41 ± 0.014, and the accumulated of TVBN (11.29 ± 0.08 mg/100 g) made the color of film changed significantly (Fig. 5, 24 h). According to Chinese Standard (GB 2733–2015), the rejection limit of TVBN value for fish was 20 mg/100 mg. And as time went by, the TVBN value of the fish rose to near the limit value (16.71 ± 0.77 mg/100 g), and the color of the film changed significantly (Fig. 5, 48 h). Therefore the color of the film changes dramatically when the fish is about to spoil at 48 h, the color change of the film can thus be considered an indicator for fish spoilage. By comparison, the color change of films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion was more obvious than films prepared with curcumin solution, and as the amount of curcumin increased, the color change was more pronounced. So the films can be applied to indicate the spoilage of fish."
25,Conclusion,"In this study, the curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion was added to biodegradable materials such as CS and PVA to prepare intelligent pH indicator films. Pickering emulsion can protect curcumin and reduce its loss during the process of preparation and storage. Compared to film in which the curcumin was not protected, films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion showed better barrier, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The pH indicator films were applied on monitoring fish freshness and the films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion had more pronounced color change, which certainly makes the indicative function more evident. In addition, the protective effect of different particles on curcumin and the binding effect between the particle and the film matrix can be further explored. Therefore, the intelligent pH indicator films prepared with curcumin-loaded Pickering emulsion is a promising application to indicate the quality of food."
