0,Introduction,"Biomass is receiving attention as a renewable energy/carbon source and its sustainable applicability for the production of bio-based chemicals and materials in an environmentally benign manner. Algal biomass is a promising feedstock due to its rapid growth, short life cycle, and wide distribution (Li and Jiang, 2017; Yu et al., 2017). Algal biomass contains mainly lipids, proteins, saccharides, and inorganics with a significant fraction of lignin and cellulose (Chen et al., 2018; Vassilev and Vassileva, 2016). A probable enhancement in the conversion of algal biomass to bio-oil and biochar through different thermochemical platforms such as hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis is admirable for further exploitation in the context of biorefinery. Algae bio-oil has enormous potential for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers, chemicals, and fuels. On the other hand, biochar has wide applications in energy storage, as catalyst supports, for pollutant removal, and as bio-materials for medicinal uses (Yu et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2015). Carbon-based catalysts are well known in heterogeneous catalysis with a long history due to its anticipated characteristics for catalyst support and have many industrial applications (Lee et al., 2017). Biochar is an inexpensive, highly porous, carbon-rich, and renewable material. These properties make it a promising replacement for conventional solid carbon-based catalysts. Along with the direct use of biochar obtained from thermochemical processes, the scientific community is focusing on numerous modification methods to expand its activity during catalytic reactions. Acid/base treatment or carbonization process can change the physicochemical properties of biochar (Rajapaksha et al., 2016; Kambo and Dutta, 2015). Iris et al. prepared a series of Al biochars from waste wood biomass by carbonization process (500–750 °C). The physicochemical properties of these Al biochars, e.g., surface area, structure (crystalline/amorphous), porosity, elemental composition, thermal stability, and acid/base site density, can be adjusted by varying pyrolysis conditions (Iris et al., 2019). Phosphoric acid activated wood biochar catalyst was used for catalytic conversion of starch-rich food waste into glucose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (Cao et al., 2018). The study concluded that high activation temperatures improve porosity and acidity of biochar, which enhances the catalytic activity of H3PO4-activated biochar for starch hydrolysis and fructose dehydration. Therefore, biochar has outstanding potential for various catalytic and industrial applications. Biochar has been used for the biorefinery processes (syngas (Muradov et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2018), hydrogen (Yao et al., 2016), and liquid hydrocarbon production (Yan et al., 2013)). Biochar also used for the production of various platform chemicals from biomass through hydrolysis (Li et al., 2013; Dora et al., 2012), isomerization (Choudhary et al., 2013), dehydration (Liu et al., 2015), and rehydration paths (Morone et al., 2015). Only a few studies were focused on bio-oil upgradation. Ido et al. investigated the upgradation of the oil extracted from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae using a novel nickel-impregnated rice hull biochar catalyst. The results indicate that the upgraded biofuel yield was 69.4%. The upgraded biofuel was 100% green liquid hydrocarbons and contained 94% alkanes and 6% alkenes (Ido et al., 2019). Recently, a physically activated biochar of wheat straw was tested for catalytic cracking of wheat straw bio-oil and a mixture of model compounds. The results show that total gas production and yield of H2 were higher in real bio-oil sample instead of the mixture of model compounds (Di Stasi et al., 2019). Algal biochar contains various inorganic elements like N, P, S, and metals, along with carbon (Shi et al., 2013), and is an excellent architect, which implants these hetero atoms to carbon framework in a regular way to build a carbon skeleton with high porosity and surface defects (Lee et al., 2017). The algal biochar based catalysts also used for bio-oil upgradation. Ni-doped microalgae biochar based catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method and used for hydrotreatment of microalgal bio-oil (Nguyen et al., 2016). The catalyst showed excellent behaviour for hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation. The products obtained after hydrotreatment contain mainly hydrocarbons (~80%) with a small amount of oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds (~12%) (Nguyen et al., 2016). Taghavi et al. employed the catalytic pyrolysis of Sargassum microalgae in the presence of Sargassum biochar and Ni/SBA-15 for producing hydrogen-rich gas and valuable biochemicals. They reported that biochar has various functionalities and inorganic contents that promote aromatization reactions to produce phenolics (15%). However, Ni/SBA-15 is suitable for hydrogen production due to its high surface area and interconnected structure (Taghavi et al., 2018). Cyclohexanol is an industrially relevant product, and it is used to produce lacquers, paints, varnishes, degreasers, plastics, soaps, detergents, and insecticides. Phenol (model compound of lignin bio-oil) can be used as a renewable source to produce cyclohexanol via hydrogenation. Ni and Co are well known for hydrogenation, and it is reported that single metal (Ni or Co) containing catalytic systems showed poor conversion and selectivity for hydrogenation. However, co-existing of Ni and Co in a single catalytic system greatly improved both hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards hydrogenated products (He et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). This might be due to the introduction of Co in the Ni-based catalytic system, which leads to the strong interaction of Co to Ni and support. This interaction helps in high metal dispersion and prevents the aggregation of metal particles (Zhou et al., 2015; Mallesham et al., 2016). He et al. (2019) prepared porous Carbon/ZrO2 supported Ni–Co nanoparticles (15 wt%) using the Zr-based metal-organic framework as the precursor. The results indicated that Ni3Co1@C/ZrO2 catalyst showed the best catalytic performance for phenol hydrogenation in the aqueous phase. The conversion of phenol (6.6 mg) was 96.33%, while the cyclohexanol selectivity was 91.14% at the optimum experimental conditions (200 °C, 0.2 MPa H2, 4 h). Li et al. (Li et al., 2017) prepared the various carbon-supported catalysts by incorporation of Ni and Co (40 wt%) on nitrogen-doped carbon using MOF-template strategy. Among all catalysts, 1Co–1Ni@NC-600 catalyst showed ≥99% phenol (0.2 mmol) conversion and ≥99% cyclohexanol selectivity at 100 °C, 1.2 MPa H2, and 2 h in isopropanol. The activity of 1Co–1Ni@NC-600 was 2.8 and 4.3-fold higher than that of the catalysts Co@NC-600 and Ni@NC-600, respectively. With the above consideration, the aim of this study is focused on the development of high surface area algae-based biochar using thermochemical process (pyrolysis) at 400 °C, followed by chemical activation. The chemical activation was performed at different temperatures, different heating rates, and different activation times with various ratios of pyrolysis char and KOH for the formation of carbon skeleton with high number of pores and structural defects. In the present investigation, we also prepared Ni and Co nanoparticles doped catalyst using Sargassum tenerrimum dry seaweed activated biochar (SDSW-ABC) as catalyst support. The prepared catalyst was evaluated for the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol. The effect of various experimental parameters, such as temperature, pressure, solvent, catalyst amount, and time was studied on phenol hydrogenation. The catalyst was also explored for the hydrogenation of other representative model compounds of lignin with different functionalities."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Sargassum tenerrimum dry seaweed was collected from the intertidal region Anjuna in the North Goa during the post-monsoon season. The char was synthesized by lab procedure (mention below) and used as catalyst support. Metal precursors and other chemicals with ≥98% purity were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Commercial activated carbon (AC) was purchased from Fisher-Scientific.
3,Preparation of algal biochar,"2.2 Preparation of algal biochar Firstly, SDSW was washed with tap water and distilled water to remove water soluble and adhering impurities. The washed feedstock was dried in sunlight and kept overnight in a conventional oven at 110 °C to remove moisture. The dried sample was coarsely crushed in electric mixer-grinder. In a typical synthesis method, the high surface area biochar was synthesized through chemical activation of the by-product obtained in the pyrolysis procedure. In the pyrolysis step, the SDSW was pyrolyzed in pyrolysis setup at 400 °C with a heating rate of 15 °C/min for 1 h in a steady flow of N2 (100 ml/min). The solid residue, i.e., SDSW biochar (SDSW-BC), was further activated via chemical activation. In the chemical activation step, KOH was impregnated on SDSW-BC (w/w) with a ratio of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. The impregnation was performed on a hot plate with magnetic stirring at 80 °C until complete evaporation of water took place. The mixture was further dried overnight and subjected to chemical activation in a horizontal tubular furnace at the desired temperatures (700, 800 and 900 °C) for different activation times (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 h) under nitrogen flow (150 ml/min) with various heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min). The resultant samples were soaked with 0.5 N HCl solution for 24 h and washed several times with hot and cold distilled water to maintain the neutral pH. The activated Sargassum tenerrimum dry seaweed biochars were dried at 110 °C for 24 h to remove the water."
4,Preparation of catalyst,"2.3 Preparation of catalyst 10 wt% Ni and Co based catalyst with 1:1 atomic ratio of Ni and Co on SDSW-ABC prepared through the simultaneous co-impregnation method. The calculated amount of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and Co(NO3)2.6H2O was dissolved in ethanol. Further, the calculated amount of SDSW-ABC was added to that solution. The mixture was stirred at 400 rpm and 50 °C for 3 h. The resultant catalyst was dried overnight at 105 °C in a conventional oven and calcined at 400 °C with the 5 °C/min under continuous nitrogen flow (100 ml/min) for 2 h, subsequently reduced in constant hydrogen flow (50 ml/min) for 4 h at 600 °C and crushed to a fine powder. The powdered catalyst was used for characterization and catalytic activity."
5,Char and catalyst characterization,"2.4 Char and catalyst characterization The various analytical/spectroscopic techniques such as N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), temperature program reduction (TPR), temperature program desorption (TPD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used for characterization of char and catalyst. N2 physisorption was performed on 3Flex Physisorption, Micromeritic at −196 °C for calculating surface area, pore-volume, and pore size. TEM/HRTEM images were taken with the JEOL JEM 2100 microscope. XRD was performed in Rigaku Geigerflex X-ray diffractometer. FT-IR of the developed activated carbon was determined using FTIR-Perkin Elmer-Spectrum II instrument. TPD and TPR were performed on Micromeritics, Auto Chem II 2920."
6,Evaluation of catalytic activity,"2.5 Evaluation of catalytic activity In a typical experiment, 0.5 mmol phenol, 100 mg catalyst (NiCo/SDSW-ABC), and 5 ml isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were loaded in a 15 ml stainless steel tubular reactor (internal diameter = 10 mm) for the examination of catalytic activity of NiCo/SDSW-ABC. The reactor was purged thrice with 1 MPa hydrogen to remove air from the reactor and pressurized to desired hydrogen pressure. The reactor was fitted in an oil bath under vigorous magnetic stirring and heated with a heating rate of 5 °C/min to final temperature and maintained for reaction time. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, and the product was collected after simple filtration. The qualitative analysis of the product was carried out in Agilent GC (7890 B) coupled with a mass spectrometer (5977 A MSD) having a mid-polar capillary column (DB-35MS, 35% phenyl/65% dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm), and quantitative analysis was performed on Shimadzu GC-FID (GC-2014) with RXi-MS (100% Dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column. The results are reported with an average of three reactions to minimize error. Conversion and selectivity were described as follows, with ±1% uncertainty. Conversion ( % ) = | n reactant 0 − n reactant f n reactant 0 | × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = | n H n reactant converted | × 100 where, n r e a c t a n t 0 is the initial concertation of reactant, n r e a c t a n t f is the concentration of reactant after reaction and n H denotes the concentration of the hydrogenated products."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization studies of raw material and activated carbon,"3.1 Characterization studies of raw material and activated carbon 3.1.1 Raw material characterization Proximate and ultimate analysis of dried SDSW were investigated to know the elemental composition, moisture, volatile, ash, and fixed carbon. The results are listed in Table 1 . The ultimate analysis shows that 32.1% C, 4.70% H, 0.93% N, 60.72% O are present in SDSW. The proximate analysis shows that SDSW has 61.50% volatiles, 26.50% ash, 5.70% moisture, and 11.9% fixed carbon (calculated by difference). 3.1.2 Surface area and porosity of activated char: effect of activation conditions The effect of activation conditions such as KOH amount, carbonization temperature, heating rate, and chemical activation time on texture and porosity of prepared activated carbons is presented in Fig. 1 . The role of KOH and evaluation of the impregnation ratio (SDSW-BC:KOH) during the carbonization process suggested that the presence of KOH initiated a chain of reactions that affected the surface area and pore structure of the activated carbon (Nayak et al., 2017). Fig. 1a shows that increment in surface area and pore volume is directly proportional to KOH amount and increase significantly from 1:0.5 to 1:2 impregnation ratio. Further increase in KOH amount, i.e., impregnation ratio 1:3, leads to a small decrease in surface area and pore volume. It may be due to the coalescing and broadening of micropores (Nayak et al., 2017). The carbonization was conducted at different temperatures with a fixed impregnation ratio (SDSW-BC:KOH = 1:2) for 2 h to evaluate the effect of carbonization temperature. Fig. 1b shows that carbonization temperature has a rigid impact on surface area and pore volume. Significant improvement in surface area and porosity is observed at 600–700 °C, possibly due to metallic potassium formation at high temperatures, which is intercalated in biochar and accountable for carbon gasification in the form of CO2 and CO gases, and activated the carbon by evolving the pores (Gupta et al., 2019; Hayashi et al., 2000). The maximum surface area and pore volume obtain at 700 °C. The reduction in surface area and pore volume obtains a further increase in temperature from 700 °C, and this might be due to shrinkage of existing pores and re-arrangement of the carbon skeleton (Fu et al., 2011). The activation time has a significant effect on surface area and porosity of prepared activated carbon. Fig. 1c shows that prolonged activation has a positive influence on surface area and porosity. The surface area is maximum (Fig. 1c) for 2 h activation time, which results in complete pyrolysis and leads the opening of pores for enhancing porosity. Activation times greater than 2 h show an adverse effect on surface area and porosity. The surface area decreases by 226 m2.g−1 at 2.5 h activation time due to the widening of the micropores (Nayak et al., 2017). The rate of evolution of volatile matter in the course of the carbonization process shows an interesting impact on the surface area and porosity (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1d shows the specific surface area and pore volume of various activated biochars at different heating rates. The results indicate that the surface area and microporosity increase when the heating rate increases from 5 °C/min to 10 °C/min due to the formation of lamellar type structures (Singh and Lal, 2009). After that, the surface area decreases, and the pore volume slightly increases with a high heating rate. The high heating rate diminishes the discharge time of volatiles from the material, which can lead to two phenomena; (i) hindrance in full deterioration of carbon walls and pores (Soltani and Yazdi, 2012) (ii) accumulation of volatile matter with/within particles (Ang n, 2013). The resultant activated biochar of 700 °C at 10 °C/min heating rate and 2 h activation time with 1:2 (SDSW-BC:KOH) impregnation ratio is called SDSW-ABC. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of SDSW-BC and SDSW-ABC were plotted, the isotherm of SDSW-ABC shows a horizontal plateau, which indicates that the pore size of SDSW-ABC is small in comparison of SDSW-BC (Singh and Lal, 2009). Isotherm of SDSW-ABC (Fig. 2 ) can be classified as type IV, having the H4 hysteresis loop associated with mesopores (Thommes, 2010). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used for calculating the surface areas, and these were found to be 4.1 and 1493 m2.g−1 (Table 2 ) for SDSW-BC and SDSW-ABC, respectively. The change in pore size from higher (SDSW-BC = 31.1 nm) to lower (SDSW-ABC = 2.7 nm) by KOH is a key factor for the high surface area of activated biochar (Table 2). The mesopores in SDSW-ABC (0.58 cm3.g−1) have 19.3 times pore volume compared to SDSW-BC (0.03 cm3.g−1). The high surface area hosts a large number of active nanoparticles and provides high dispersion to active nanoparticles (Rajagopalan and Balakrishnan, 2018; Liu et al., 2013) (can be seen in Fig. 6). High porosity promotes mass and heat transfer. These factors promote the rate of reaction (Shimizu et al., 2015). Thus, SDSW-ABC has the potential to use as catalyst support due to its high surface area, high degree of mesopores, and high pore volume. 3.1.3 Surface chemistry of SDSW-ABC The surface functionalities of SDSW-BC and SDSW-ABC are almost same and prove that the activation process does not create a massive change in surface chemistry (Fig. 3 ). The sharp peak at 3440 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra of the SDSW-BC and SDSW-ABC reveals the existence of oxygen containing functionalities (H bonded OH stretch). A decrease in the intensity of peak at 3440 cm−1 is due to hydroxyl group consumption in dehydration at higher temperature (Park et al., 2013). Similarly, the intensity of typical CC vibration of the benzene ring at 1440 cm−1 is also decreased, which indicates the formation of the multi-benzene ring fused structure from aromatic rings (Park et al., 2013). The shoulder peak at 1630 cm−1 is corresponding to CO vibrations, and peak at 870 cm−1 is attributed to C–H vibrations of the polysubstituted aromatic ring (Park et al., 2013; De et al., 2014). FT-IR of fresh and used catalysts also shows a similar type of functionality (S1). 3.1.4 Acidity of SDSW-ABC The total acidity of SDSW-ABC and SDSW-BC with surface acid sites was measured by NH3-TPD (Fig. 4 ). The acidity of SDSW-BC and SDSW-ABC indicates the presence of –OH and –COOH groups on the surface of biochar (Rafi et al., 2015). The biochar samples show three desorption peaks in NH3-TPD profile. These three peaks represent three types of acidic sites; weak (100–280 °C), moderate (280–550 °C), and strong (550–650 °C). SDSW-BC shows higher acidity than SDSW-ABC because, during the high temperature treatment in the activation process, SDSW-ABC loses the acidic groups. The SDSW-ABC also shows low strong acidic sites than SDSW-BC, which might be due to the conversion of aliphatic groups into well-ordered graphitic layers, which is in good agreement with FT-IR results."
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization BET analysis shows that there is only a small decrease in surface area due to the presence of Ni and Co (Table 2). Adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of NiCo/SDSW-ABC can be seen in S2. TPR spectra of NiCo/SDSW-ABC (non-reduced) catalyst consists of two major reduction peaks: first peak at 347 °C and second peak at 596 °C (S3). The reduction peak at low temperature is attributed to the reduction of superficial larger metal oxide particles (herein NiO and CoO) (Zhou et al., 2017), which had a weak interaction with support. The reduction peak at high temperature is ascribed to the reduction of highly dispersed and strongly interacted smaller metal oxide with the support (Wang et al., 2013). In the XRD pattern of SDSW-ABC, a weak broad peak was detected between 15° and 30°, which is corresponding to the crystal plane of 002 for disordered graphitic carbon and represents the turbostratic structure of graphitic carbon (Biscoe and Warren, 1942; Li et al., 2019). The sharp peaks at 2θ = 29.4, 36.05, 39.4, 43.1, 47.4, and 48.6° are correlated to calcite (CaCO3) (Taghavi et al., 2018). XRD pattern of NiCo/SDSW-ABC shows only peaks for SDSW-ABC, but diffraction peak for Ni and Co species was not observed (Fig. 5 ). It was due to high dispersion and small particle size of Ni and Co (can be seen in Fig. 6d) because XRD cannot detect small size particles (Singha et al., 2016, 2017). Furthermore, the peak intensities of SDSW-ABC was significantly decreased by the loading of Ni and Co; it might be due to the presence of Ni and Co in the pores, which is affecting the crystal structure of SDSW-ABC (Pino et al., 2011). A peak shift toward higher 2θ in XRD pattern reveals the incorporation of Ni or Co in the lattice of carbon (Pino et al., 2011). Table 2 also supports that Ni and Co particles are going inside the pores because the pore volume of NiCo/SDSW-ABC (0.26 cm3.g−1) is small compared to SDSW-ABC (0.58 cm3.g−1). TEM images of catalyst present in Fig. 6 show the mesoporous nature of carbon. The black spherical dots in image 6a corresponds to Ni and Co nanoparticles with an average particle size of 3 (±0.08) nm. Image 6e and 6f show interplanar d-spacing for the metallic form of Co and Ni, respectively (Bremmer et al., 2017; V Manukyan et al., 2015). EDX pattern of metals is present in 6 g and 6 h, which shows an almost uniform distribution of Ni and Co."
10,Hydrogenation of phenol,"3.3 Hydrogenation of phenol NiCo/SDSW-ABC was used for the hydrogenation of phenol at temperature range (60–140 °C), hydrogen pressure range (3–7 MPa), and time range (2–8 h) in various polar solvents (methanol, ethanol, IPA and water) to optimize the phenol hydrogenation conditions. 3.3.1 Effect of solvent and reaction time Different polar solvents were investigated for solvent optimization because solvent plays a vital role in ring hydrogenation (Feng et al., 2014). The effect of methanol, ethanol, IPA, and water on phenol conversion is listed in Table 3 . Methanol and ethanol showed 20.5 and 34.7% conversion, respectively, but IPA gave 100% phenol conversion. The presence of secondary alcohol increased the phenol hydrogenation; it could be due to the smaller size of the primary alcohol, which creates a thick layer over active catalytic sites and resists the interaction between catalyst and reactant. These results are similar to McManus et al. (McManus et al., 2015), who reported that IPA is the best solvent for hydrogenation. In the presence of alcoholic solvents, only cyclohexanol was obtained as a product. But, in the aqueous system, two products (cyclohexanol and cyclohexane) were obtained, it might be due to the high polarity of water, which breaks the Caromatic-OH bond (Meng et al., 2017). Table 3 shows the phenol conversion and yield of products at different times. From Table 3, catalytic conversion of phenol is 88% at 140 °C and 5 MPa in IPA during 2 h reaction time. The hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol increases with reaction time, reaches the maximum (≥99.9%) at 4 h, and remains constant after 4 h. 3.3.2 Effect of pressure Further studies on phenol hydrogenation were carried out at 140 °C for 4 h in IPA to optimize hydrogen pressure. From Fig. 7 , the phenol hydrogenation gradually increases as pressure increases. The complete conversion of phenol is achieved at 5 MPa and remains constant up to 7 MPa. The possible reason for this phenomenon is that high hydrogen pressures might improve the solubility of H2 in the reaction mixture, which increases the more accessibility of hydrogen molecules at catalytic sites, and consequently results in more hydrogenation (Li et al., 2017). 3.3.3 Role of temperature Fig. 8 shows the effect of temperature on phenol conversion and selectivity of cyclohexanol. The catalyst is stable at experimental temperatures. TG-DTG profile of catalyst can be seen in S4. Phenol conversion is 35.5% at 60 °C, significantly increases with temperature, and reaches the maximum (≥99.9%) at 100 °C, but cyclohexanol selectivity remains constant (≥99.9%) at all temperatures. Further increment in temperature from 100 °C to 140 °C does not affect the conversion and selectivity. These results are similar to Gutierrez et al. and He et al. work. They reported that as the temperature increases, the phenol hydrogenation also increases (He et al., 2019; Gutierrez et al., 2009). 3.3.4 Effect of catalyst Catalyst and amount of catalyst are important features of any catalytic study. The effect of the catalyst and type of catalyst on phenol conversion was carried out at optimized experimental conditions to examine the influence of catalyst support. The result shows that, in the absence of SDSW-ABC support, the phenol conversion was very small as compared to NiCo/SDSW-ABC (Table 4 ). Because high surface area support (SDSW-ABC) provides high dispersion to Ni and Co metals (Figs. 5 and 6), which are active sites for phenol hydrogenation. Thus, NiCo/SDSW-ABC showed ≥99.9% conversion of phenol. Another carbon, AC also tested as catalyst support. NiCo/AC showed less activity (94.4%) than NiCo/SDSW-ABC (≥99.9%), which might be due to low surface area (784 m2.g−1) and large particle size of Ni & Co (3.59 ± 0.13 nm, S5) in NiCo/AC, which are 1094 m2.g−1 and 3 (±0.08) nm, respectively for NiCo/SDSW-ABC (Shimizu et al., 2015). The other literature reported catalyst for hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol is given in S6. The effect of catalyst quantity on phenol conversion at optimized conditions is shown in Table 4. Results demonstrate that the hydrogenation of phenol is highly dependent on the catalyst amount. No hydrogenation of phenol was observed in the absence of catalyst, and there was an increasing trend of phenol hydrogenation as catalyst quantity increased. It might be due to the reason that as the amount of catalyst was increased, the number of active sites for phenol hydrogenation increased (Mahdavi and Mardani, 2015), and lower catalyst loading required more reaction time to get higher reaction yield (Badgujar et al., 2020). Maximum phenol hydrogenation (≥99.9%) and cyclohexanol selectivity (≥99.9%) was achieved with 75 mg NiCo/SDSW-ABC. There was no change in cyclohexanol selectivity up to 100 mg catalyst. However, a further increase in catalyst amount led 3% breakage of cyclohexanol to cyclohexane because hydrogenation is active site reaction, and more availability of active sites was leading to the cracking of cyclohexanol. 3.3.5 Recyclability of catalyst NiCo/SDSW-ABC was tested to evaluate its recycling ability. In this study, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture after each catalytic run by filtration. The filtered catalyst was washed with IPA, dried at 110 °C, and used in the next run for phenol hydrogenation. The catalyst was used for five cycles, and results are shown in Fig. 9 . The results indicate that there was ≥99.9% phenol conversion with ≥99.9% cyclohexanol selectivity up to three cycles. In the fourth cycle, there was a tiny loss in phenol conversion (5.2%) and cyclohexanol selectivity (5%). However, there was a significant loss in phenol conversion (16%) and cyclohexanol selectivity (10%) in the fifth cycle. These results show that NiCo/SDSW-ABC is a stable and reusable catalyst."
11,Hydrogenation of other lignin model compounds,"3.4 Hydrogenation of other lignin model compounds Few other lignin model compounds (anisole, m-cresol, pyrocatechol, guaiacol, and 2, 6 dimethoxy phenol) were selected to further evaluate the hydrogenation activity of NiCo/SDSW-ABC. NiCo/SDSW-ABC showed good activity for all lignin derivatives except 2,6 dimethoxy phenol. All selected compounds have different functionalities, and the effect of the functionality on hydrogenation can be seen in Table 5 . With increasing the number of groups or bulky groups on the benzene ring, the hydrogenation was decreasing. Thus, the hydrogenation of 2,6 dimethoxy phenol, pyrocatechol, and guaiacol was difficult due to steric hindrance on the ring and required harsh conditions (Yang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2012). The hydrogenation order of lignin model compounds is followed. Anisole > m-cresol > pyrocatechol > guaiacol> 2,6 dimethoxy phenol."
12,Conclusions,"High surface area activated biochars were developed from SDSW using a chemical activation method. The experimental parameters, such as KOH amount, carbonization temperature, heating rate, and activation time, were varied to examine the effect of experimental parameters on the physicochemical properties of activated biochar. Optimized experimental conditions of chemical activation in terms of surface area (1493 m2.g−1) and pore volume (0.58 cm3.g−1) were 700 °C, 10 °C/min heating rate, 2 h carbonization time, and 1:2 impregnation ratio. This SDSW-ABC has been used as catalyst support for Ni and Co loading, and Ni and Co nanoparticles showed good dispersion on the SDSW-ABC. Phenol conversion was ≥99.9%, with ≥99.9% cyclohexanol selectivity in the presence of NiCo/SDSW-ABC at 5 MPa hydrogen pressure, 100 °C, and 4 h in isopropanol. The hydrogenation results of other lignin model compounds (anisole, m-cresol, pyrocatechol, guaiacol, and 2,6 dimethoxy phenol), open new possibilities for the synthesis of industrially important chemicals from lignin model compounds."
