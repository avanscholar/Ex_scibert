0,Introduction,"Transport (particularly road and air transport) alone is responsible for more than 20% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions [1–3]. To address this substantial environmental problem, the use of renewable energies, including alternative fuels and biofuels, should reduce the overall CO2 emissions in the transport sector. Forecasts through 2050 underline the need for all categories of renewables to account for approximately 27% of the total transport fuel consumption [4]. Hydrogen has been closely linked to the transport and fuel sector for many decades. Not only is this molecule involved in several operations (hydrotreatments) in crude oil refinery but hydrogen is also exploited as a reagent/processing agent for the production of alternative fuels (e.g, liquefaction of micro-algae) [5–7]. Hydrogen can also be used as a “clean” fuel as it is; its combustion generates only water vapor as a by-product [8–10]. Besides crude-oil refining (representing more than 33% of the H2 consumption), hydrogen has been utilised in many other applications, mostly ammonia production (27%) and methanol manufacturing (11%) [11]. Market forecasts underline that H2 production will increase significantly over the next few years, with a growth of 5–10% per year from 50 to 82 Mt by 2050 [12]. The industrial H2 demand is also expected to increase, especially for ammonia and steel production, by about 2 EJ/a for each of these activities in 2050, while the H2 demand for hydrogen-based vehicles is estimated to reach 22 EJ/a by 2050 [12]. These forecasts also demonstrate an increased use of hydrogen in the manufacturing of new biofuels (from algae or plant materials) that will impact the hydrogen market and require higher production volumes in the next few years. With a suitable policy and creation of new infrastructures, a hydrogen economy could emerge after 2030 [13]. Currently, more than 98% of the H2 production is ensured from fossil resources, through either natural gas steam reforming, SMR (accounting for 76% of the global production), or coal gasification (22%) [14]. SMR is currently the most economical option and is responsible for approximately 9 kg of CO2 per kg of H2 produced [14]. The alternative to renewable feedstock instead of natural gas appears to be compulsory to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases and would be a substantial step toward carbon-neutral emissions [8,15,16]. However, only 2% of the current H2 production is from renewable resources, mostly from water electrolysis, an emerging technology, with no significant use of vegetal/algal biomass on the industrial scale currently [11]. Water splitting is one of the most studied processes, mostly electrolysis (TRL 9, available at a small scale), with more innovative approaches such as thermolysis and photolysis (TRL 1–2, under research) [17]. Considering biomass, research has emphasised lignocellulosic matrices (e.g. wood, forestry side-products, agricultural residues, and dedicated energy crops) and their conversion, primarily using thermochemical (gasification, pyrolysis) pathways [18–20]. The maturity level of these proposals is aligned with TRL 7. Other alternatives include biological conversion (TRL 4–5) and electrochemical conversion (TRL 2–4). The hydrogen production costs from biomass remain quite high, ranging from 1.21 to 2.42 $/kg when choosing gasification to 1.21–2.19 $/kg for pyrolysis, which is three times higher than that of SMR (0.75 $/kg) [21]. Even if some scenarios involve an economic production of biomass in 2050, biomass should be at the price of coal (ranging from to 40–100 $/MT for coal and up to 140 $/MT for biomass) to be competitive for energy production [22]. Currently, lignocellulosic biomass is expensive to produce. However, forecasts indicate a decreasing price of biomass at the expense of fossil resources that could be impacted by environmental policies and the CO2 price [23]. Hence, an increase in the H2 costs from coal gasification is expected from $ 1 to 2.7 $/kg in China by 2030 due to taxation [11]. Regarding the cost of hydrogen produced from water by electrolysis, it should decrease from $ 3 to 2.8 $/kg H2 if renewable electricity is used and from 5.3 to 4.8 $/kg H2 using the electricity grid by 2030. These costs would remain higher than those from the biomass conversion forecasts [11]. This review aims to describe the different H2-production pathways from biomass and is formatted as follows: In the second section, the two important thermochemical and biological pathways are reviewed as well as the description of the electrochemical conversion potential. A comparison between the processes in terms of their performance in hydrogen yield and their advantages and drawbacks is proposed in the third section. Recent improvements and process optimisations are reviewed in the fourth section, while a techno-economic assessment based on the latest advances in the field is established in the fifth section. An evaluation of hydrogen as a fuel is examined in the sixth section, and key findings are highlighted in the seventh section."
1,Main production routes for H2 production from biomass,"Currently, 98% of the global hydrogen used is produced from fossil fuels, with the predominant production process as steam methane reforming. Other options based on renewable resources are currently in pilot-scale demonstrations or at the commercial stage, namely water splitting and H2-generation from biomass, particularly lignocellulosic feedstock. Lignocellulosic biomass is derived from agri-food side products, agricultural residues, energy crops, marine residues, and forest by-products [24]. Dahmen et al. reported that the annual production of lignocellulosic agricultural residue has been estimated as approximately 4.6 billion tons, of which 25% is used, and approximately 7 billion tons are produced from grass and forest land, which is used for energy production [25]. Biomass has attracted attention for its abundance and low cost. Hydrogen production from biomass allows an increase in production quantity, contributing to the economic capacity, increasing source flexibility, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Navaro et al. reported that biomass can be carbon neutral due to its maintained natural cycle. The CO2 released during the biomass-derived hydrogen process is used during photosynthesis for plant growth (without considering the CO2 produced from the hydrogen fossil process) [8]. Currently, several types of technology underway for the production of H2 utilising (lignocellulosic) biomass, such as thermochemical processes, biological conversions, and potentially electrochemically-assisted production."
2,Thermochemical productions,"2.1 Thermochemical productions Thermochemical conversion is the most advanced technology for hydrogen production from biomass. The process was established based on similar methodologies performed on biofuels, such as biomethane, adapted from steam methane reforming (SMR) [26]. The three primary thermochemical routes are gasification, pyrolysis, and aqueous phase reforming [27]. Gasification is a highly endothermic process conducted in an oxygen-deficient medium at approximately 1000 °C. It consumes an oxidising agent to produce syngas, a synthesised gas composed of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The process differs according to the oxidising agent used and can be designated either as air gasification, oxygen gasification, or steam gasification [28]. In addition, minor organic and inorganic impurities have been found in the syngas. The organic compounds include light hydrocarbons (LHC), such as CH4, and tar (viscous liquid composed of condensable organic compounds), and the inorganic molecules include H2S, HCl, NH3, and alkali metals [29]. Form an operational point of view, the moist feedstock is introduced in the gasifier to dry, releasing water (drying zone). Then, the feedstock undergoes a pyrolysis reaction (pyrolysis zone), liberating the gaseous compounds (CO, CO2, LHC) and tar. Reduction reactions finally occur, and the combustion of the resulting solid from the biomass (called char) produces hydrogen. The unconverted char is transported to the combustor to form CO2 and provide heat for the process. The general air gasification reaction of biomass is presented in Equation (1) [21]. (1) B i o m a s s + A i r → N 2 + C O + H 2 + C O 2 + C H 4 + H 2 O + L H C + T a r + C h a r The “direct route”, based on the direct conversion of the raw biomass, is an overall simple process suitable for a wide range of lignocellulosic materials. However, the relatively low percentage of hydrogen in the raw biomass (3–11 wt%), as well as the heterogeneity of the composition, are responsible for a variable and inefficient yield of H2 and a varied quantity of impurities, such as tar and char [30]. Mandenoğlu and co-workers revealed the difference between the hydrothermal catalytic gasification of lignin and cellulose, the major components of biomass. Using K2CO3 as the catalyst at 600 °C, a biomass conversion to gaseous products of 81.2 wt% can be reached with the cellulose, whereas only 61.4 wt% is obtained from lignin. Hydrogen yields of 30.7 mol H2/kg are higher than those of alkali lignin (23.7 mol H2/kg) [31]. Therefore, biomass containing a high amount of cellulose and a low amount of lignin should favour H2 production. In conventional gasification using a fixed-bed reactor, air (oxidising agent) is used as a combustible for the partial burning of biomass, resulting in a low conversion into H2 due to the high N2 and CO2 contents in the gas produced. A significant challenge of air gasification is the removal of nitrogen, a non-combustible gas that reduces the heat value of the fuel. As an alternative, gasification can be achieved using oxygen or steam instead of air [32]. Oxygen gasification produces a gas of greater purity, containing a higher level of H2, no nitrogen, and less tar and char. Wang et al. studied an oxidising agent in the gasification of pine sawdust pellets using a pilot-scale two-stage gasifier. They demonstrated that an increase in O2 from 20 to 100% induced an increase in the H2 concentration in the gas produce from 16% to 36% [33]. However, the cost of oxygen makes the process too expensive to implement at an industrial scale [34]. Steam gasification is used as a compromise between air and oxygen gasification. The H2 content in the gas is similar to that from oxygen gasification, whereas the process is cheaper. Nevertheless, tar, char, and a minor amount of N2 are present. The general steam gasification reaction of biomass is presented in Equation (2). (2) B i o m a s s + S t e a m → H 2 + C O + C O 2 + C H 4 + H C + T a r + C h a r ( Δ H O > 0 k J / m o l ) A comparison of the different gasification processes is summarised in Table 1 [21,35,36]. Steam gasification appears to be the most suitable process to produce hydrogen based on the H2 percentage in the gas (40%), higher H2/CO ratio (1.6), and reduced impurities compared with air gasification. Concerning the feedstock, steam gasification is feasible for wet biomass (moisture from 5 to 35 wt%), while air gasification requires a dry raw material [37]. Steam reforming (SR) is a concomitant purification reaction that improves the syngas composition during steam gasification by reducing the carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio (C/H) [38]. The optimisation of steam reforming has been performed to reduce the volume of light hydrocarbons and tar responsible for the corrosion and blocking of pipes due to polymerisation and condensation [39]. Different reactions occur during steam gasification, which are presented in Table 2 [40–42]. After the drying step, the pyrolysis reaction occurs, and the biomass is converted into a gas rich in CO, CO2, CH4, LHC (C2H4), C, and tar (primary). Primary tar is a complex and condensed mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated molecules, alcohols, phenols, and furans [43]. Under the temperature conditions of steam gasification (700–1000 °C), homogeneous reactions, such as cracking and steam reforming, occur and alter the structure of these oxygenated molecules. The general tar steam reforming reaction is given in Equation (3) [44]. (3) C x H y O z + ( x − z ) H 2 O → x C O + ( 0.5 y + x − z ) H 2 ( x ≥ z ) ( Δ H O > 0 k J / m o l ) Steam gasification promotes the steam reforming reaction and increases the yield of H2 produced compared with air gasification, rather than promoting a combustion reaction. During the reforming reactions, the primary tar is cracked into secondary tar, and then into tertiary tar. At extremely high temperatures (~1250 °C), it is possible to eliminate all the tar [45]. Reforming reactions take place on LHCs in the presence of H2O and CO2 to form CO and H2. During tar cracking, LHCs (CH4 and C2H4) and carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are generated together with H2. These compounds are stable under the operating conditions of cracking/reforming. Moreover, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction converts CO in presence of H2O to a mixture of CO2 and H2. Steam added to the gasification process enhances the reversible reaction by shifting the reaction to H2 production. However, the WGS reaction is exothermic, and according to the Le Chatelier's principle, an increasing temperature will shift the reaction to the reactants, resulting in the formation of CO and H2O. Finally, heterogeneous reactions, such as carbon oxidation to form CO2 or CO, and the Boudouard reaction occur to a lesser extent than homogeneous reactions [46]. The char formed during the pyrolysis step is converted into CO and CO2 primarily through slow heterogeneous reactions during steam gasification, requiring the char to remain in the reactor to maximise the conversion into gas [47]. Char can also promote catalytic activity by supporting the catalysts. Many parameters can be optimised to increase the H2 production yield of gasification. These parameters are highlighted in Table 3 [17,21,48]. At the end of steam gasification, the gas predominantly consists of H2 and CO2. Therefore, CO2-capture systems (CCS) have been integrated during the process to increase the concentration of H2. The separation must be conducted in the same reactor in which the catalysts enhance the WGS reaction to promote the capture of CO2. This process is called sorption-enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP). H2 can be concentrated up to 99.9% using a pressure swing adsorption system (PSA). By varying the pressure, the PSA allows the separation of a gas mixture based on the different affinities for each gaseous species to be adsorbed on a liquid or solid. Calcium oxide CaO is currently the most commonly used CO2 acceptor (forming CaCO3) and can be easily regenerated [58,59]. The method is called “chemical looping” and releases H2 (gasification) and CO2 (CaO regeneration) in separate reactors [28]. Scrubbing is a separation technique used to separate the gaseous impurities, such as H2S or water [60]. This operation occurs prior to the PSA and is an energy-consuming separation method [61]. Steam reforming is an interesting complementary system integrated with existing processes to reduce the tar and char quantities, as summarised in Fig. 1 . Partial oxidation (PO) is an alternative approach to steam reforming reactions. The reaction scheme is similar to steam reforming, except that H2O is replaced by O2 [19]. One of the advantages is that reactions with oxygen are exothermic, which means there is no need for either an external energy source or the use of more-compact reactors. Different reactions occur depending on the oxygen concentration in the reactor. PO is widely documented for ethanol, the most described feedstock in the literature. When hydrogen is produced with carbon monoxide as a by-product from ethanol and low O2 quantities, the reaction is endothermic (Equation (4)) and becomes exothermic when the percentage of O2 within the reactor increases (Equation (5)). In this case, the partial oxidation reaction is autothermal, and carbon dioxide is produced. Due to the highly exothermic reaction, PO is carried out at lower temperatures [62,63]. In the case of lower amounts of oxygen, water gas shift (WGS) reactions could improve the H2 yield of partial oxidation with steam (Equation (6)). This reaction is mildly exothermic, and the water added to the system avoids deactivation of the catalysts by limiting coke formation, as in steam reforming [64,65]. Catalysts are also necessary in partial oxidation, as in steam reforming, except that no external heat source is required in PO. (4) C 2 H 5 O H + 0.5 O 2 → 3 H 2 + 2 C O ( Δ H O = + 14 k J / m o l ) (5) C 2 H 5 O H + 1.5 O 2 → 3 H 2 + 2 C O 2 ( Δ H O = − 510 k J / m o l ) (6) C 2 H 5 O H + 0.5 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 5 H 2 + 2 C O 2 ( Δ H O = − 68 k J / m o l ) Supercritical water gasification (ScWG) is an alternative thermochemical route that has been developed at the laboratory scale to be more robust for the biomass type, including wet biomass (moisture > 35%) such as wood and carbohydrates. Water requires a temperature above 374 °C and a pressure higher than 221.2 bars to become a supercritical fluid. Under these conditions, the dielectric constant of water decreases as well as the quantity of hydrogen bonds. Organic compounds and gases are miscible in supercritical water at high temperatures, facilitating their conversion. The total reaction is endothermic and similar to that involved in aqueous-phase reforming. Residence times can be very low compared with other gasification processes (2–6 s), and the reaction can be conducted at a lower temperature (600–650 °C) [66]. However, to maintain these conditions, high energy levels are needed, increasing the costs and hindering its scalability [8]. Therefore, no system has been developed on an industrial scale because the high pressure required induces substantial capital and operational expenditures [67]. Solving certain technical issues (waste neutralisation, reactor design standardisation, and comprehension of chemical kinetics) are compulsory for the development of commercial and viable ScWG systems [68]. The general biomass conversion equation for the ScWG is given as Equation (7) [69]. (7) C H x O y + ( 2 − y ) H 2 O → C O 2 + ( 2 − y + 0.5 x ) H 2 ( Δ H O > 0 k J / m o l ) ( with x = element molar ratio H / C and y = elemental molar ratio O / C ) There are two temperature regions in ScWG systems: high temperature, typically in the range 500–700 °C and low temperatures of 374–500 °C. At high temperatures, pyrolysis reactions take place before gasification, splitting the feedstock without catalyst contribution. Nevertheless, alkali catalysts can be added to increase the H2 yield by promoting WGS reactions. At low temperatures (374–500 °C), hydrolysed compounds are gasified and reduced by alkali-based catalysts, transition metals, and activated carbon catalysts, which are necessary to enable a high conversion of biomass to gas [70,71]. Moreover, a methanation reaction occurs at low temperatures and consumes the hydrogen produced to form CH4, requiring charcoal or another carbon-based catalyst to solve this issue. Pyrolysis is another tool, besides gasification, for biomass thermochemical conversion. Pyrolysis is similar to gasification but can be performed at lower temperatures and without an oxidising agent [72]. In some specific cases, a small amount of an oxidising agent can be added to facilitate heat generation [73]. Pyrolysis typically occurs at temperatures ranging between 400 and 800 °C, under a pressure of up to 5 bar. According to the operating temperature, pyrolysis can be divided into three classes: conventional (or slow) pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis. Conventional pyrolysis is carried out at temperatures below 450 °C and results in a high charcoal content. Fast pyrolysis produces a high bio-oil yield of up to 75 wt% at medium temperatures (450–600 °C) with a high heating rate (approximately 300 °C/min) and a short residence time [74]. Flash pyrolysis is similar to fast pyrolysis but at higher temperatures (above 600 °C) and higher heating rates (>1000 °C/s), while the residence time is shorter (below 1 s), and is used to maximise the gas yield [42]. However, the fast and flash pyrolysis gas yields are lower compared with gasification, especially because of the lower operating temperatures [75,76]. A general pyrolysis reaction is presented in Equation (8) [41]. (8) B i o m a s s + h e a t → H 2 + C O + C O 2 + C H 4 + H 2 O + bio − oil + charcoal ( Δ H O > 0 k J / m o l ) Oxygenated molecules (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenolic compounds and carboxylic acids), water, and ash may be condensed after pyrolysis to form a complex liquid fraction similar to tar called “bio-oil”. Bio-oils can be divided into two classes: water-insoluble fraction and water-soluble fraction. The insoluble fraction can be cracked into platform molecules such as BTX or olefins and can be used in adhesive applications [77]. Concerning the soluble fraction, a steam gasification system can be added to the process to increase the H2 production yield. Pyrolysis–steam reforming is a two-stage thermochemical route that has been extensively studied recently [78]. The catalysts used are the same as for the cracking steps of gasification and are also inactivated by carbon deposition (coke). A catalyst regeneration step enables the conversion of coke into CO2 by combustion, unblocking the active sites [8]. Global H2 yields are similar to those for steam reforming by gasification and range between 70% and 80% [79]. The separation of the reactors in the pyrolysis-steam reforming process avoids reforming catalyst inhibition by coke deposition [54]. The process is easy to scale up and offers an alternative to direct gasification and bio-oil reforming [78]. Aqueous phase reforming (APR) is the third thermochemical approach used for H2 production from biomass. APR converts mainly oxygenated compounds into hydrogen. Feedstock molecules are dissolved during the aqueous phase and react with water molecules at low temperatures (<270 °C) and high pressures (up to 50 bar) [80,81]. APR processes are suitable for biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons with a C/O ratio of 1:1 and are miscible in water, such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, glucose, or even polyols, such as sorbitol [82]. The small range of effectively soluble molecules converted in the process is the principal drawback. However, reforming pure cellulose and woody biomass through APR is possible after a pre-treatment step [27]. This involves the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to monomers that can be used as feedstock [83]. The reaction mechanism is similar to steam reforming and relies on C–C bond cleavage to produce H2. The ideal pathway for the conversion of ethylene glycol, whose mechanism is well known, is depicted in Fig. 2 . In contact with the surface of a catalyst, the C–C bonds of ethylene glycol are cleaved to produce carbon monoxide. The catalyst also promotes the WGS reaction, leaving a low amount of CO remaining in the gas stream (<300 ppm). Other reaction intermediates are possible, favouring the C–O bond cleavage, leading to alkane (CH4, C2H6) formation and a lower H2 production yield [84]. Choosing a metal (M)-based catalyst depends strongly on the stability of the M − C bond (enhancing the C–C cleavage pathway) and the M − O bond (enhancing the C–O cleavage pathway). However, the price of metal catalysts is prohibitive for large-scale development. Moreover, the support of catalysts must be considered. Basic and neutral supports are preferred to acidic supports because their selectivity for H2 is higher and lower for alkanes, respectively. Indeed, alkanes are produced under acidic conditions arising from dehydrogenation, and it is critical to opt for a catalyst that is non-selective to alkanes while working at suitable pH conditions [80]. Feedstock biomass and the process conditions also influence the selectivity of APR [66,84]. The conversion of complex oxygenated molecules, such as carbohydrates, is a challenge because they yield lower amounts of H2 [80]. The thermal homogeneous decomposition of carbohydrates rapidly creates large amounts of coke responsible for catalyst deactivation and competing with the reforming reactions."
3,Biological conversion,"2.2 Biological conversion Biological conversion can be divided into three categories: biological water gas shift reaction, dark fermentation, and photo-fermentation. Each process depends on the nature of the enzymes used to catalyse H2 formation [85]. Commonly, microorganisms, such as micro-algae and cyanobacteria, produce the enzymes required to synthesise H2, including nitrogenases and hydrogenases [86]. Nitrogenases reduce protons (H+) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and electrons and release H2, while hydrogenases reversibly catalyse the conversion of protons to hydrogen. In contrast to thermochemical processes, biological conversion takes place at lower temperatures (30–60 °C) and pressures (1 atm), decreasing the energy cost. Moreover, the microorganisms used can be easily regenerated by replication, decreasing the turnover frequency compared with chemical catalysts easily deactivated during thermochemical conversions [87]. Biological processes are particularly interesting in waste management and enable the conversion of agricultural waste, agri-food effluents, and solid residues, or municipal solid waste. Investigations of sewage sludge have increased in the last ten years because the nature of the material is favourable to its conversion through different biological processes [88]. The biological water gas shift (BWGS) reaction depends on the capacity of photoheterotrophic bacteria, using carbon monoxide as the carbon source. These microorganisms can produce H2 (together with CO2) in the dark by oxidising CO and reducing H2O through an enzymatic pathway, according to Equation (9) [83]. (9) C O + H 2 O ⇋ C O 2 + H 2 ( Δ H O < 0 k J / m o l ) Different microorganisms can perform BWGS. Among the gram-negative bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum is the most widely explored, while Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is the most used gram-positive microorganism [89,90]. An advantage compared with a thermochemical WGS reaction is the lower temperatures and pressures (30–70 °C depending on the strain, atmospheric pressure). Nevertheless, different parameters still need to be optimised. Carbon monoxide released from the feedstock needs to be limited because it decreases bacterial activity. In addition, microorganisms need to be improved to increase the concentration in the bioreactor. Finally, issues concerning the mass transfer of gas to liquid should be addressed [90]. Dark fermentation, another biological option for producing H2, occurs when anaerobic microorganisms, such as micro-algae or specific bacteria, are sustained in the dark at temperatures between 25 and 80 °C, or even at hyperthermophilic (>80 °C) temperatures, depending on the strains. Under these conditions, the gas produced contains H2, CO2, and small amounts of CH4, CO, and H2S, depending on the converted substrate. Hydrogen is primarily produced from the anaerobic metabolism of pyruvates generated during the catabolism of carbohydrates [91]. Compared with photolysis, the H2 yield in the gaseous product is lower due to the minor gases [85]. The yield of hydrogen also relies on the by-products of the reaction. From glucose, considered as a model substrate, 4 mol of H2 per mol of glucose can be obtained when acetic acid is the by-product of the reaction and 2 mol of H2 per mol of glucose when butyric acid is obtained [92]. More hydrogen can be produced when the reduced end-product is acetate, and that pathway should be promoted over butyrate. However, both molecules still contain hydrogen that could be released to increase the yield. It is possible to direct a specific pathway for H2 production by changing the conditions of the bioreactor [85]. Other parameters also influence H2 production, such as the pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and gas partial pressure. Another advantage of dark fermentation is the possibility of converting cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials, such as wastes, to hydrogen [93,94]. This biological process has the potential to integrate waste management into energy production. However, it still requires the development of current technologies to be financially competitive and have the potential for practical application and commercialisation. Globally, two factors are limiting the development and scaling of biological processes. Compared with thermochemical processes, the H2 yield and production rate are lower (up to several months) making biological processes less competitive, even if improvement has been made with dark fermentation [95]. In addition, the complexity of lignocellulosic material and agricultural waste requires the material to be enzymatically fermentable. This additional time-consuming and expensive process hinders the development at an industrial scale. The variability of the feedstock notably affects the H2 yield and the economy of the process, demonstrating that the selection of substrates is crucial. Photo-fermentation (PF) is the latest biological process used for H2 production. PF is catalysed by nitrogenases in purple non-sulphur bacteria to convert organic acids or biomass into hydrogen from solar energy in a nitrogen-deficient medium. Equation (10) presents the global reaction performed on glucose as the model substrate [96]. (10) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 12 H 2 O → + 12 H 2 + 6 C O 2 PF can be performed either through single-step or two-stage fermentation. The single-stage process is a low-cost approach but suffers from several drawbacks, such as the high energy demand from nitrogenases and their low solar energy conversion. The two-stage fermentation is a system in which dark-fermentation occurs first, and the organic acids obtained undergo PF sequentially to produce more H2. The disadvantages are the difficult operations to control the different bacteria and the parameters between the separate stages [97,98]. Recent studies have investigated PF as waste-prevention process to produce H2 from industrial and agricultural wastes [99,100]. However, it remains the least financially competitive process among all the biological methods [101]."
4,Electrochemical conversion possibility,"2.3 Electrochemical conversion possibility Electrolysis is an electrochemical process widely investigated for hydrogen production by splitting water molecules. The mechanism occurs in a fuel cell (containing a cathode and an anode) at a low temperature and relies on the flow of an electric current through a conductive electrolyte (alkali or polymer) in water. This results in the splitting of water into O2 and H2 [102]. The conversion is fast, straightforward, and produces pure H2 after separation. Moreover, there are no carbon, sulphur, or nitrogen side-product compounds, saving purification costs when compared with those of gasification processes. The limitation of water splitting relies on thermodynamic parameters because an electric consumption of a minimum of 45 kWh/kg H2 is required to reach a sufficient yield of hydrogen. Electrochemical conversion is also possible for biomass. The difference between water and biomass electrolysis lies in the reaction occurring at the anode. The feedstock is oxidised instead of producing gaseous oxygen from the water. Biomass electrolysis can be achieved through two different technologies, Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (PEMEC) and Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC). Both PEMECs and MECs are commonly used for bio-based molecules such as ethanol and glycerol. Polymeric molecules, such as cellulose or wood sawdust, cannot be converted directly by electrolysis. These systems require a single or two chambers containing an anode/cathode couple. The conversion of organic matter occurs at the anode by an oxidation reaction releasing protons (H+). A reduction reaction occurs at the cathode, allowing the formation of H2 [103]. PEMEC systems contain a polymeric membrane that transfers protons to obtain a high hydrogen gaseous fraction [104]. In MEC systems, the oxidation of organic matter to produce H+ is performed using electrochemically active microorganisms as catalysts, making the process a “bio-electrochemical” system [105]. Classic PEMEC systems require an expensive catalyst made of noble metals, that are extremely sensitive to CO and other impurities released by biomass during electrolysis. Moreover, PEMECs consume a high volume of alkaline molecules to neutralise the organic acids produced during the electrolysis of biomass, thus making the process even more expensive. The same findings have been reported for MEC systems where microorganisms cannot directly use the biomass. Biomass must be fermented and converted into organic acids or alcohols, and only those molecules can be converted to H2 through the MEC. In addition, although its electrical consumption is lower than that of water electrolysis, the conversion rate of MEC is too slow for the process to be competitive. These drawbacks have slowed down the development of electrolysis systems producing H2 from biomass [106]. Even if the electrical consumption can be lowered by using bioethanol instead of water (e.g. Chen et al. reduced it by 26.5 kWh/kg H2 converting ethanol using palladium nanoparticles deposited on titanium nanotubes), the total energy balance is impacted by bioethanol production. Indeed, this issue decreases the interest in this process because an economically viable bioethanol is challenging to produce from biomass, especially from lignocellulose [107]. Investigations into the direct electrolysis of biomass should be performed in the future."
5,SWOT analysis of the main process used from biomass,"Several (thermochemical, biological, and electrochemical) technologies are described below regarding their ability to produce hydrogen from biomass. Table 4 summarises the key advantages and drawbacks of each process. Thermochemical conversions have the advantage of being available at a large production scale because the technologies used are based on current well-established methods for converting fossil fuels. Therefore, the industrial design has already been established [116]. Despite being carbon-neutral, thermochemical processes release CO2 and require a combination with carbon capture systems (CCS) to achieve negative emissions. Even if this solution is associated with an increased investment, it is the best economical solution to reach the environmental objectives [119]. These processes rely on essential catalysts that are prone to deactivation. They require high temperatures compared with biological and electrochemical routes. Overall, the best yields are obtained through gasification. Gasification and pyrolysis are adapted for a wide variety of dried feedstocks, while steam gasification and steam reforming are the best compromise for wet complex biomass treatment. However, the processes are more sensitive to catalyst deactivation by tar and char formation. Partial oxidation and APR are only applicable to simple molecules in solution, requiring an eventual pre-treatment step that increases the cost of the processes. The ScWG system requires high pressures, which also represents a significant cost that hinders scaling up [120]. PO, APR, and ScWG would have less impact because their applicability at a large scale is limited. Biological conversion suffers from low yields and a slow conversion rate. The production from complex biomass requires pre-treatment for prior fermentation, hindering the processes at the pilot scale. They are more suitable for rich liquid streams, such as molasses or food waste [121]. Moreover, compared with APR and ScWG, the conditions of the fermentative processes are milder, and the hydrogen yields are more substantial due to a higher efficiency, especially in the case of dark fermentation (80%). Even though PF has a slightly higher yield than dark fermentation, the lower efficiency (0.1%) decreases the interest in this technology. In addition, dark fermentation is more worthwhile considering its higher production rate and lower energy consumption. Therefore, dark fermentation or a combined process with PF should be favoured. Concerning electrochemical conversion, water electrolysis does not directly cause carbon emissions but has a high electrical consumption (4.5-50.6 kWh/m3 H2) [122]. Biomass electrolysis has been investigated because lower electrical consumptions have been obtained with the development of the MEC and PEMEC systems (0.6–1 kWh/m3 H2) [123]. This consumption is even lower than the energy required for biological processes, while having similar conversion rates. Although MEC and PEMEC are interesting methods for waste management, the low hydrogen production rate is the most significant impediment to these methods being competitive [124]. To supply the necessary amount of biomass to produce hydrogen, two types of feedstock can be used: lignocellulosic residue and dedicated crops. Lignocellulosic waste is available at a low cost because they are generated at the end of the harvest season for such crops as cereal wheat or during the transformation process. However, dedicated energy from crops, such as sorghum, requires land use and growth time, which can be a challenge. As mentioned by Kammoun et al. it is possible to group biomass types according to their chemical composition (carbohydrates, lignin, and others) to facilitate the pre-treatment required [24]. Thus, biomass represents a renewable precursor to hydrogen production and could be comparable to water electrolysis as an alternative to fossil feedstock for chemical production and even in the future for fuel transportation."
6,Recent developments and perspectives for existing processes,
7,Improvements of thermochemical approaches,"4.1 Improvements of thermochemical approaches Gasification is perhaps the most thoroughly studied process, and its improvement has been abundantly described and updated. One key element of the current research is to find suitable operating conditions and catalysts that can effectively increase the volume of the gas produced and its quality at a low cost [125]. New efficient catalysts are added to promote tar conversion and prevent the formation of unwanted products. Some studies have already reviewed and compared a wide range of available catalysts for thermochemical processes, especially gasification [21]. Usually, these are dolomite, olivine, potassium mineral, and nickel-based compounds [108]. Recent results are highlighted for these catalysts. According to Zhang et al. for a range temperature from 450 °C to 850 °C, the maximum H2 yield was 204.6 mL/kg biomass (Ficus virens leaves) using limestone/dolomite (1:1) as the catalyst [126]. Wei et al. highlighted the variations in the H2 yield due to biomass type and catalyst. They obtained a 10% and 15% increase in H2 concentrations in the gas produced from legume straw and sawdust using dolomite compared with inert sand. This increase is attributed to the catalytic steam reforming of tar. Meanwhile, varying the temperature demonstrated a significant effect on tar yield (g/Nm3) and hydrogen yield (g/kg fuel) [127]. A significant effect on hydrogen yield was demonstrated by Ma and co-workers in 2019 by studying dolomite and olivine as catalysts at different temperatures. When the temperature was increased from 700 to 900 °C, the tar yield decreased from 12.5 to 7.2 g/Nm3 for dolomite and from 15.9 to 9.1 g/Nm3 for olivine. The tar conversion led to an increased hydrogen yield from 36.2 to 46.4 g/kg and from 32.4 to 42.3 g/kg of biomass, respectively [128]. The choice of gasifier depends on the biomass feedstock and the conditions for H2 production. Therefore, development and optimisation steps are required for each raw material. Currently, the best compromise consists of gasification using steam as an oxidising agent in terms of gas composition, impurities, and cost. Recent developments in steam gasification have focused on decreasing the temperature processes and the tar and char formation through catalyst use to improve the H2 yield [42]. Moreover, steam gasification allows more flexibility regarding the feedstock, allowing the use of wet biomass without requiring expensive oxygen. The primary objectives are the development of improved catalysts, especially dolomite and olivine, to reduce the operating temperature (the total energy used), tar content, and therefore, the cost of the process. Linked to gasification improvement, most of the research in terms of steam reforming (SR) is focused on new catalyst discovery, temperature optimisation, and char and coke degradation. Guo et al. increased the yield by using rice husk char (RHC) as a support metal catalyst, from 196.6 to 269.6 mL/g using K-RHC, 274.9 mL/g for Cu-RHC, and 342.7 mL/g for Fe-RHC. Char and char-supported catalysts promote H2, CO, and CH4 production [129]. In addition, a high C/H ratio of biomass induces coke formation during gasification; a carbon deposit negatively affects the catalyst. Decreasing the C/H ratio is driven by steam reforming, thereby reducing coke formation. In 2018, Yaghoubi et al. studied the effect of different parameters on hydrogen production from biomass in a dual fluidised bed gasifier. They demonstrated that H2 production could be optimised at operating temperatures between 800 and 820 °C. At higher temperatures (>820 °C), hydrogen production decreases due to char combustion for energy input; thus, char is not converted into H2. Residence time influences the specific gas formed during gasification, which is directly linked to the steam/biomass ratio (S/B). Typically, an S/B ratio of 1.3 allows the optimal production of H2. Higher S/B ratios decrease the residence time and do not allow complete gasification reactions, thereby producing less H2 and more carbon-containing gases. Finally, decreasing the reactor diameter and biomass particle size increases the H2 yield by gasification [130]. The general concentration of H2 in the reported gas produced varies between 18% and 59%. This variation is due to the different catalysts used, and studies have focused on their efficiency. Ni-based and char alkali earth metals are the most effective and explored catalysts. For example, Liu et al. studied catalytic tar cracking from rice hull gasification and obtained a tar conversion of 94.4% with a Ni-based catalyst (Ni6/PG), enabling a hydrogen yield of 57.7% [131]. Al-Rahbi et al. used tire pyrolysis char as a catalyst for the gasification of wood pellets. The H2 concentration increased up to 50% and the H2 yield from 8.4 to 39.2 mmol/g biomass when the temperature was raised from 700 to 900 °C [132]. Yao et al. demonstrated that biochar is a promising catalyst and support for biomass gasification. Biochar from CSP allows a good interaction with the volatiles due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals present, facilitating the conversion to H2. The addition of Ni (Ni-based biochar) improved the production of hydrogen from 45.91 to 92.08 mg H2/g biomass at 800 °C in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor during steam reforming [133]. Xu et al. also demonstrated the effect of alkaline earth metals on gasification efficiency. Calcined calcium oxide (CaO), comprising 5 wt% of Fe gave the highest H2 yield (26.40 mol/kg biomass) in a fluidised bed reactor at 700 °C for wood sawdust gasification. The Fe/CaO catalyst is less efficient for gasification than some other catalysts and for CO2 capture compared with CaO. However, Fe impregnation prevents CaO deactivation and allows for a better tar conversion, giving a higher H2 yield compared with CaO only (12.36 mol/kg biomass) [28]. Overall, the key perspectives in terms of R&D reside in the discovery of cheap and bio-based catalysts that resist coke deactivation while being easily regenerated. This could allow a better gas quality (H2 proportion), lower tar and char content, and a process requiring a lower amount of energy. Regarding partial oxidation (PO), several studies have been conducted to improve partial oxidation using noble metal catalysts, such as nickel- and cerium-based catalysts; however, their cost remains a limiting factor [61,134]. Ma and Muller investigated various catalysts for the partial oxidation of tar from biomass gasification. They revealed that NiO, a nickel-based catalyst, was more active in the conversion of naphthalene, a tar model compound. A conversion yield of 95% was obtained at 600 °C in a fixed-bed reactor [135]. Using Rh as a catalyst (0.5 wt%), Kim et al. obtained an H2 production yield of 90% at 750 °C from dimethyl ether partial oxidation in a microreactor. The study highlights the efficiency of their developed microreactor compared with a conventionally packed reactor [136]. Partial oxidation was also performed by Zukowski and Berkowicz on methanol in a fluidised bed of a catalyst containing iron and chromium oxides [137]. Using an equimolar ratio of CH3OH and N2O, a yield of 95% was achieved at 350 °C. This method occurs at a lower temperature compared with other thermochemical processes. However, the reaction co-generates CO2 and N2. Separation steps are necessary following the partial oxidation. Many efforts have been made to develop and upgrade partial oxidation processes at the pilot scale. Compared with steam reforming, PO has a lower or equal efficiency in terms of H2 production depending on the substrate. For ethanol reforming, yields are up to 50% higher for SR [138]. Moreover, PO is more adapted to the indirect route by using derived-biomass molecules with a lower C/H ratio, such as ethanol (having a similar C/H ratio as methane), and not on lignocellulosic biomass feedstock. PO can be attractive in order to valorise co-products from already settled industries, including glycerol from biodiesel production and ethanol from breweries, producing it as a side product of non-alcoholic beers due to an increasing market for this type of product. For ScWG, current research is focusing on more efficient catalysts. Li and Guo evaluated the performance of the Ni/MgAl2O4–Al2O3 catalyst in 2018. They also studied the effects of different parameters on the ScWG, such as the heating rate, temperature, and catalyst loading. An increased H2 production yield was obtained when the temperature was increased from 200 to 600 °C and reached a yield of 45 mol/kg for a 5 wt% glucose solution at 600 °C and a residence time of 300 s. CO2 was the other significant gaseous product, and a separation process after ScWG could deliver a high-purity hydrogen gas (>80%). Temperatures above 500 °C are favourable for H2 production, while CH4 is the predominant gas produced at temperatures ranging from 400 to 500 °C [139]. Nanda et al. compared the activity of different alkali catalysts for timothy grass. The highest hydrogen yield was 5.15 mol/kg of feedstock at 650 °C for 45 min with a 1:8 biomass-to-water mass ratio. They showed that an increase in temperature improves the WGS reaction, resulting in higher H2 and CO2 yields. For the WGS reaction also being catalysed by alkali catalysts, KOH produced the best results (H2 yield = 8.91 mol/kg), followed by K2CO3, NaOH, and Na2CO3. Alkali catalysts are worth exploring further for the production of H2-rich syngas [140]. Many developments have also been proposed for pyrolysis, in particular aiming at elucidating the optimal process conditions. Waheed et al. increased the temperature from 850 °C to 1050 °C, inducing a hydrogen yield increase from 20.03 to 30.62 mmol/g feedstock [141]. Biomass type, particle size, heating rate, pressure, and residence time can be adapted to maximise the production of charcoal, bio-oil, or gaseous products. Moreover, catalysts also improve the yield of H2 production, tar decomposition, and biomass conversion. Carbonates (Na2CO3 and CaCO3) and metal oxides (Al2O3 and Cr2O3) have been studied and compared for different biomass species. The most effective catalyst also depends on the biomass type selected as the feedstock [142]. Research has also focused on the discovery of new Ni-based catalysts and optimal operating conditions according to each type of biomass. Akubo et al. studied the conversion of six biomass wastes (rice husks, coconut shells, sugarcane bagasse, palm kernel shells, cotton stalks, and wheat straw) and three biomass model components (cellulose, lignin, and xylan) into hydrogen by pyrolysis-steam reforming. In a two-stage fixed-bed reactor system, pyrolysis occurs at 550 °C and steam reforming at 750 °C with a NiAl2O3 catalyst. The catalyst and steam enable a H2 yield of 25.35 mmol/g for palm kernel shell conversion, which represents 57.36 vol% of the gas composition. For the biomass components, lignin exhibited the highest H2 yield (25.25 mmol/g) compared with cellulose (19.72 mmol/g) and xylan (20.54 mmol/g). Different mixtures of lignin/cellulose/xylan led to the conclusion that the more the feedstock is lignified, the more hydrogen is produced, while cellulose and hemicellulose pyrolysis release more CO and CO2 [143]. Chen et al. tested Ni/CaAlOx as catalysts on wood sawdust through pyrolysis (T = 500 °C) and steam reforming (T = 800 °C). The hydrogen yield was 15.57 mmol/g feedstock with a Ca/Al molar ratio of 1:2. Ca is a cheap alkaline metal that improves the conversion of biomass by increasing the CO selectivity, which can be used to control the H2/CO ratio in the syngas. With a Ca/Al ratio of 3:1, a total concentration of H2 and CO of 90 vol% was reached. However, catalyst deactivation resulting from coke deposition is the limiting factor [144]. Nevertheless, according to Jin et al. Ca used in the catalyst also increases hydrogen production. Under the CaO form, CO2 is absorbed during the conversion process. When Ca was incorporated into the Ni–Mg–Al catalyst, the hydrogen yield increased from 10.4 to 18.2 mmol/g of wood sawdust [145]. Dong et al. searched for a catalyst promoting hydrogen production while minimising catalyst deactivation. The NiO–ZnO–Al2O3 catalyst obtained by precipitation has been tested with different Ni contents. The H2 yield increased from 8.2 to 20.1 mmol/g wood sawdust when the Ni molar ratio was increased from 5 to 35%. Moreover, when the Ni content was increased to 25 and 35%, coke deposition on the catalyst was below 1 wt%. This study demonstrates the activity of Ni for the conversion of biomass and its resistance to deactivation due to carbon deposition [146]. Regarding aqueous phase reforming (APR), extensive research is currently being conducted to improve catalyst stability and activity to reach commercial applications and scale up. Metal catalysts (M), such as Pt and Pd, are currently the most frequently used, as well as Ni-based catalysts, because their activity for C–C and C–H bond cleavage is high, leading to high H2 production. These catalysts are also necessary for their high activity in WGS reactions. They increase the H2 yield compared with Rh and Ru catalysts through a higher propensity for alkane formation by promoting the C–O bond cleavage pathway. The thermal conditions and high pressure increase the activity of the WGS reaction and improve the conversion of oxygenates into H2. Moreover, thermal decomposition of oxygenates is unlikely to occur, leading to less coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. H2 can be concentrated up to 99.9% using a pressure swing adsorption system (PSA) [80]. Coke deposition can be mitigated by converting polyols instead of carbohydrates. Their resistance to thermal decomposition (Maillard reaction) due to the absence of carbonyl enables the decrease in coke deposition and increases the reforming reactions producing H2. In addition, by increasing the steam-to-biomass ratio, the feedstock is diluted, enabling a yield comparable to that of polyols [84]. A solution is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, which has a better resistance to thermal decomposition (responsible for catalyst deactivation by coke accelerated formation). Moreover, metal catalysts, such as platinum-based catalysts, have a higher selectivity for sorbitol than sugars in H2 production because of the reduction of their aldehyde function to alcohol [83]."
8,Improvements of biological processes,"4.2 Improvements of biological processes When considering dark fermentation, the impact of the pre-treatment is significant. Indeed, it improves the H2 yield by hydrolysing the feedstock into small-weight molecules that are easily metabolised by microorganisms. In 2018, Kumar et al. reviewed the hydrogen production from various biomass types (lignocellulosic, algae, and wastewater) by dark fermentation, while Bundhoo focused only on crop residues [93,147]. For lignocellulosic biomass, different pre-treatments have been tested as dilute acids. Alkali pre-treatment was carried out to remove lignin, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (cellulase and xylanase) to obtain fermentable sugars. The combination of alkali and acid pre-treatments has also been investigated. Among all the results, the highest yield obtained was 176 mL H2/g cornstalk using cellulase in lightly acidic conditions (pH 4.8, 0.2% HCl). Recent studies have focused on hydrogen production using microalgal biomass. Lunprom et al. produced H2 through anaerobic solid-state fermentation followed by dark fermentation using the microalgae Chlorella sp. The H2 yield was 16.2 mL H2/g volatile solid (VS, total organic matter in the biomass) [148]. With the help of pre-hydrolysis with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, Giang et al. improved the H2 yield up to 172 mL H2/g VS and productivity (2.4 ml/g VS. h) [149]. Wang and Yin also showed the production of hydrogen from different microalgal biomass, and the effect of the pre-treatment increased the H2 yield by disrupting the microalgal cells (up to 958 mL H2/g VS from Chlorella sp. with HCl-heat pre-treatment). However, the processes are far from the industrial scale, and more studies are required to improve the profitability of such processes [150]. More research is necessary regarding pre-treatment to standardise the operating conditions and improve the efficiency of the biological process. As reviewed by Zabed et al. different types of pre-treatment exist (biological, chemical, physical, combined treatment) [151]. Future work will focus on scaling up to generate hydrogen in larger quantities from biomass to reach an industrial scale. Moreover, practical and economic feasibility analyses at larger scales are necessary to evaluate the applicability of the process [148]. Further investigation is needed into the development and design of a better-performing bioreactor to improve the conversion. The issue of reducing the cost of the pre-treatment must guide researchers to affect the cost of the process and to set up dark fermentation on a larger scale [152]. Other research perspectives can be adopted for the identification of new strains of more suitable bacteria or microorganisms, revealing new opportunities [153]. Finally, at first sight, the use of biological processes in general makes more sense to valorise effluents containing sugars, such as molasses and vinasse, and wastewater, including sewage sludge, that can be processed by microorganisms. Research has increased in the last ten years because the nature of the material is favourable to its conversion by different biological processes. The high water content is suitable for biological conversion, but is a drawback for major processes such as gasification. For photo-fermentation (PF), different parameters (substrate concentration, C/N ratio, and phosphate concentration) were optimised by Wang et al. to develop a single-stage process to produce hydrogen by PF from straw biomass using Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The biomass was first hydrolysed under acidic conditions using 5% HCl at 118 °C for 30 min. The conversion of the hydrolysate to H2 was achieved in a neutral medium by two Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains: HYO1 (wild type) and WHO4 (mutant). They obtained a higher yield (4.62 mol H2/mol reducing sugar for the WHO4 strain) than direct sugar PF due to pH stabilisation [154]. To improve the efficiency of PF, some researchers have shown that combining dark fermentation with PF can improve efficiency of the biological process. Integrated dark- and photo-fermentation can solve the issues of the individual systems and give higher hydrogen yields than PF under the same conditions [155]. The key perspective concerning PF consists of its combination with dark fermentation. The dual system must be optimised to be implemented at the pilot scale. The major improvement necessary in PF itself resides predominantly in the development of a better-performing photobioreactor."
9,Recent developments in electrochemical approaches,"4.3 Recent developments in electrochemical approaches Current research is motivated to investigate the use of native biomass as feedstock without the conversion into an intermediate. In 2016, Liu et al. proposed an alternative by developing a new Chemical-Electrolysis Conversion (CEC) using aqueous polyoxometalates (POM) as catalysts [106]. In this case, POM is in solution and is not coated on the anode. POM receives electrons from biomass oxidation and is enhanced by heating or light irradiation. As POM has a low standard redox potential, it can be easily re-oxidised, and protons are released and then reduced at the cathode to form H2. POM acts as an electron-coupled-proton carrier. POM has the advantage of being a low-cost self-healing catalyst (100,000 turnovers) and is tolerant to impurities produced from the biomass. CEC can be achieved in a PEMEC system without noble metal catalysts. The energy consumption is extremely low (0.69 kWh/Nm³ H2) compared with that of water electrolysis (4.13 kWh/Nm³ H2). This process allows for the conversion of native biomass, such as wood dust, to produce H2 at a low temperature and with low energy consumption. Another method based on Fe3+ was developed by Yang et al., in 2017 using a similar approach to POM [156]. POM has a large molecular weight, inducing a low rate of electrochemical conversion. In order to improve the conversion rate, they investigated catalysts with smaller compounds, such as Fe3+. They reported a novel method to produce H2 by electrolysis from biomass using iron ions as the catalyst in the liquid phase. The production of hydrogen was achieved using PEMECs from different biomasses comprising glucose, starch, and cellulose, without any noble metals used as catalysts. During the process, Fe3+ in the solution reacts with the biomass. The oxidised biomass is degraded to low molecular weight derivatives, and Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+. On the cathode, Fe2+ is oxidised to Fe3+, and H+ is reduced to H2 on the anode. The Fe ions act as an electron carrier, and their low redox potential allows for low electric energy consumption. Another example of low electric energy consumption was investigated by Hibino et al., in 2018. They produced hydrogen by direct electrolysis of bread, sawdust, and rice chaff at 150 °C using their own anode developed with an oxygen-functionalising carbon without any noble metals. The performance in terms of catalytic activity was similar to that of a conventional Pt/C anode. H3PO4, is added to the medium, hydrolysing the waste biomass and enhancing electrolysis by increasing the solubilisation of the compounds. The average yield was 0.25 mg H2/mg feedstock for each biomass. In terms of perspectives, investigations should focus on working with higher biomass quantities to scale-up the electrochemical process [157]. Concerning the environmental impact of the process, CO2 is released during the production of hydrogen from biomass, contrary to water electrolysis considered alone. However, the net balance for greenhouse gas emissions is zero when considering the CO2 consumption during biomass photosynthesis. In addition, a CO2 capture system, such as CaO, can be added to improve the H2 concentrations in the produced gas, limit emissions, and increase the total process profitability [59]. Whether the process is applied to water or biomass, the CO2 released to produce the electricity used during the process must be considered."
10,Techno-economic comparison of hydrogen producing processes,"The techno-economic assessment of an industrial hydrogen production facility relies on two major expenses: capital investments (CAPEX) and operational costs (OPEX). The critical issue is to reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the different processes while increasing the production volume. This approach would allow the reduction of H2 production costs from renewable resources to compete with fossil fuels. In most cases, the CAPEX value was estimated using the software “Aspen Plus” or “Aspen Hysys” in order to simulate the processes and to make economic assessments [158]. Plant size and capacity have a major impact on CAPEX. The larger the facilities, the higher the CAPEX, but leading to a decrease in the production cost [159]. The presence of an integrated carbon sequestration or carbon capture and storage (CCS) system also significantly affects the total production cost, increasing the CAPEX due to the supplementary technology used. The advancement level of the technology or technology readiness level (TRL) and the availability of structures for the conversion processes are also critical factors to discuss [109]. Concerning the OPEX, the price of the biomass feedstock, which is mostly related to its availability and transport, has a significant influence on the production cost. Other parameters inherent to biomass need to be considered, including the type of feedstock and the eventual need for the pre-treatment step. An ideal biomass must be as cheap as possible, resulting in a sustainable yield upon its use. In addition, the process conditions have a significant impact on the cost of the process. The cost includes the energy delivered to increase the temperature and pressure, the electricity used for equipment or reactions (electrolysis), and the type and cost of the catalyst(s). Finally, cost estimations will also be affected by external factors, such as the fluctuation of fossil fuel prices, the variation in the biofuel policies of a given country, and the carbon tax related to CO2 emissions [160,161]. Table 5 presents the key TRL, CAPEX, and H2 production costs for different technologies applied either on biomass, water, or fossil resources (natural gas, coal). Thermochemical processes include traditional methods from fossil fuels. Currently, steam methane reforming and coal gasification have the lowest H2 production cost (<1 $/kg H2), mainly because of the large existing structures (TRL 9) and the low price of the feedstock. However, biomass prices are expected to decrease by 2050 at the expense of fossil resources. The gasification and pyrolysis of biomass are similar to those of technologies performed on fossil feedstock. They are expected to mature to reach a TRL up to 9 in the next two decades. The critical challenges are related to the type of feedstock, cost of the reactor, and CCS systems combined with the processes. In the case of biomass gasification, the reactor represents up to 42.9% of the CAPEX. In addition, Bartels et al. demonstrated that large plants with CCS systems have higher CAPEX. For the SMR process, the integration of CCS systems represents an increase of 25–30% for the H2 production cost. The size of the plant will also significantly affect the H2 production cost. For example, a small gasification plant will produce H2 for 10 $/kg compared with a large plant, for which the cost decreases to 1.2.3.5 $/kg. OPEX accounts for 60% of the CAPEX of a gasification plant and 60% of the total production cost. Approximately 60% of the OPEX itself is imputed to the maintenance and insurance, followed by the feedstock price (25%) and the operational cost of the entire process (10%; energy and electricity) [162]. The choice of a suitable catalyst will influence both the yield and energy consumption. Regarding the oxidising agent in gasification, steam is more beneficial than oxygen for economical (representing a difference of 7–22 M€ for the CAPEX) and practical reasons (WGS and CO2 removal) [163]. Among the other thermochemical processes, ScWG and APR have been developed up to the pilot scale (TRL = 4–5). Concerning the ScWG, the conversion of wet biomass, such as algae, sewage sludge, or organic wastes, avoids the energy-intensive drying step. However, the key issue is the high pressure required for the process. The resulting high energy consumption and the specific installations increase both the OPEX and CAPEX, making the process less competitive. Özdenkçi et al. determined that the OPEX is an annual cost (60 M€) equivalent to the total installation cost for the ScWG of black liquor. Based on the simulation, the current H2 production cost by SCWG is primarily affected by the OPEX and could be decreased by developing large installations, such as for gasification [168]. APR is performed on simple molecules, such as ethanol. Its sustainability relies on the cost of reliably produced bioethanol. Currently, alcohol production from lignocellulosic biomass is not economically viable [170]. The future of APR is related to these technologies. Biological processes, widely studied at the pilot scale, have been developed to reach the industrialisation step. The PR and dark fermentation processes are two technologies of interest. Currently, fermentation processes are more adapted to a small scale. Their high H2 production costs make them less viable and competitive than thermochemical conversion processes. The most significant issue is related to the lower yield and rate of biomass conversion [171]. In addition, the systems require expensive bioreactors and separation steps to obtain pure H2 from gaseous products. This equipment increases the CAPEX of the process, hindering development on an industrial scale [172]. To improve the fermentation and enrich the hydrogen fraction, pre-treatments can be performed on recalcitrant biomass. Physical pre-treatments, including grinding, chipping, and milling, are the most investigated step that are prior to biomass conversion. However, this additional step increases the complexity of the process and can produce inhibitors of bacterial growth, thereby impacting both the CAPEX and the OPEX [173]. Future improvements should focus on the development of local small-scale production plants. In addition, the optimisation of bioreactors and development of new bacterial strains are required. Regarding electrochemical processes, water electrolysis technologies have a TRL as high as fossil fuel-based processes. However, industrial production is currently performed at a smaller scale. Felgenhaur and Hamacher compared the process efficiencies [174], and determined that for a similar productivity (90 kg/h), the CAPEX of water electrolysis (4 M€) is lower than gasification (9.9 M€) and steam reforming (11 M€). However, the investment cost can be substantial for large-scale production due to the price of an electrolyser, which can represent 60% of the CAPEX. According to the CAPEX analysis, electrolysis is currently more adapted to a small-scale approach (including the case of a hydrogen refuelling station) [175]. Among all the processes listed in Table 5, sustainable water electrolysis presents the highest costs. Electrical consumption is the primary reason for the high OPEX, which increases the H2 production cost, especially when renewable electricity is used. Yao et al. showed that electrical consumption can represent up to 80% of the operational annual cost (4.8 M€/a) for alkaline electrolysis (with a CAPEX of 4 M€) [61]. The H2 production cost is expected to decrease in the future with the development of current technologies from 5.0 €/kg H2 to 2.3 €/kg H2 for alkaline electrolysis [176]. This has motivated the development of cheaper processes from renewable materials, including MEC, PEMEC, and CEC. Indeed, the current research on MEC allows the production of hydrogen at a lower cost (1.7–4.51 $/kg) compared with water electrolysis (2.35–4.8 $/kg). With the development of CEC technologies, which have the lowest electrical consumption (equivalent to 16.7% of that of water electrolysis), OPEX could be drastically reduced as well as the H2 production cost [106]. In this case, it could also promote the installation of larger plants to decrease the hydrogen production cost. The chemical electrolysis conversion of biomass could provide a new method for industrial applications to overcome the high electrical consumption of water electrolysis. CEC methods benefit from water electrolysis and are promising for areas where biomass and waste are abundant. These two techniques complement each other based on the local abundance of biomass, water, or green electricity production. Nevertheless, future studies are necessary for this novel process with a low TRL to predict its impact on the future of hydrogen. More research is required to develop biomass CEC methods to convert more complex feedstock into hydrogen and to assess its economic feasibility."
11,Hydrogen assessment as fuel in transportation,"As a future energy, hydrogen is a potential candidate to ensure a renewable, sustainable, and secure fuel [177]. Compared with traditional fuels, H2 has the characteristic of being used in both fuel cells and internal combustion engines [5]. In fuel cells (HFC), electricity is generated through a combination of hydrogen and oxygen. This electrochemical reaction is assured by a catalyst that splits H2 into electrons and protons. The positively charged protons cross the cathode, and the negatively charged protons are pushed through the system to generate electricity [178]. In internal combustion engines (HICE), hydrogen can be either sent to the manifold as cold hydrogen or be stored in a cryogenic cylinder as liquid hydrogen and then transformed into a cold gas though the heat exchanger or it can be used as an alternative fuel to gasoline to form a hydrogen-gasoline mixture, which is compressed and ignited by a combustion spark [5]. Hydrogen-fuelled engines have several advantages in terms of minimum ignition energy, auto-ignition temperature, and flammability. Its minimum ignition energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite the air fuel mixture) is lower than that in gas and gasoline engines, giving it the advantage of rapid ignition [179,180]. In addition, its self-ignition requires a higher temperature compared with gas and gasoline, giving it the characteristic of high compression ratios for internal combustion [180–182]. Its flammability limits in the air (the fuel volumetric concentration limits and the fuel–air mixture flammability) is wider than that of gas and gasoline, allowing a better fuel economy by reducing complete combustion [183,184]. In addition, the high diffusivity of hydrogen allows its rapid diffusion in the air, forming a homogenous mixture. When there is a leak in the system, hydrogen will be diffused in the air without harming the system or the environment [10]. In order to evaluate the performance of hydrogen-based vehicles, environmental efficiency and fuel assessment were chosen as the criteria. Table 6 presents a comparison of these selected parameters between conventional, hybrid, electric, hydrogen fuelled internal combustion engines, and hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen-fuelled vehicles consume roughly the same consumption as hybrid vehicles in the case of HICE and consume more fuel than electric vehicles, but always less than that of fossil fuel vehicles. Electric vehicles have the lowest fuel price, followed by hydrogen-fuelled (1.69 for HICE and 1.72 for HFC) and hybrid vehicles 1.71. However, conventional vehicles have the highest fuel price. The fuel dividing range was approximately 350 km for hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, which is almost double the distance that electric vehicles can travel. However, it is lower than the fuel dividing range of conventional and hybrid vehicles, which showed the highest dividing range [5,185–187]. Concerning the environmental impact, two major criteria are considered: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO2 gases correlated to global warming potential, and acidification potential (AP), essentially SO2 emissions, related to acid rains. Nanaki et al. reported that (HICE) and (HFC) have the lowest GHG emissions (6.40 kg CO2/100 km of vehicle travel and 7.10 kg CO2/100 km of vehicle travel, respectively) compared with conventional, hybrid, and electric vehicles. Regarding acidification potential, HICE and HFC also had the lowest AP (0.02 kg SO2/100 km travel and 0.018 kg SO2/100 km travel, respectively) compared with other vehicle types that oscillated between 0.04 kg SO2/100 km travel and 0.06 kg SO2/100 km travel [188]. Literature data proves that hydrogen-fuelled vehicles including internal combustion engines and fuel cells are the cleanest because they represent the lowest CO2 and SO2 emissions. Fuel cells have the best environmental performance and provide a sufficient dividing range. Hydrogen fuel is promising, eco-friendly, and could be competitive with electric vehicles, especially when the production processes are improved in order to minimise its cost."
12,Conclusions,"Among the initiatives currently taken to partially overcome global warming, a great deal of research has been conducted on hydrogen as an alternative energy vector. Various conversion pathways have already been investigated to produce H2 from lignocellulosic biomass. Thermochemical processes are the most common technologies. Gasification is the predominant process globally and should reach the industrial scale (TRL 9) in a few decades. Steam gasification is the best compromise as it does not require an expensive oxidising agent (oxygen) and is adapted to a wide variety of wet and dried feedstocks. Typically, increasing the size of the plant will increase the CAPEX but will significantly reduce the H2 production cost. OPEX is primarily due to maintenance, insurance, and the feedstock price. The major drawback remains the tar and char formation and the deactivation of the catalyst. Current research is predominantly focused on the use of novel catalysts, mainly Ni-based catalysts, biochar, dolomite, and olivine, to improve the selectivity of reactions and decrease the inhibition issues. Currently, the lowest hydrogen production cost from renewable feedstock is met with biomass gasification. In addition, studies have been conducted to use microorganisms that allow the biological conversion of biomass, mostly through dark fermentation processes. The key advantages reside under mild conditions (T° and pressure) used. The main limitations of these processes are the slow conversion rate and the low volumes produced, hindering the development (TRL 5). These systems require expensive bioreactors and separation steps to increase CAPEX. In addition, pre-treatments are necessary for recalcitrant biomass, inducing the production of inhibitors and negatively impacting CAPEX and OPEX. Future improvements should be focused on the development of local small-scale production plants as well as the development of better-performing bioreactors and new bacterial strains. In addition, they are more suitable for liquid streams containing sugars, such as molasses and wastewater (sewage sludge) that can be processed by microorganisms. Interest has recently increased concerning these feedstocks because they are easily processed by microorganisms, while they are challenging in major processes such as gasification. Among the latest conversion techniques, electrochemical methods, including biomass electrolysis, deliver promising results in terms of yield at the laboratory scale (TRL 2–4) while consuming less electricity than conventional water electrolysis. Notably, recently developed MEC allows the production of hydrogen at a similar cost compared with water electrolysis. With the development of CEC technologies, which have the lowest electrical consumption, OPEX could be drastically reduced as well as the H2 production cost. Combined with cheap and clean wind or solar energy, H2 could be produced in areas producing large amounts of biomass. Numerous applications are currently dependent on hydrogen. The current increasing demand is encouraging the boom of a new economy based on hydrogen use. The conversion of biomass coupled with CSS systems makes it possible to obtain negative CO2 emissions compared with the reforming of fossil resources. Biomass conversion still needs improvements and adaptations to be implemented at a larger scale, allowing the production of larger volumes to be competitive, especially in the biofuel sector."
