0,Introduction,"Mesoporous carbons (MCs), instead of traditional microporous activated carbons (ACs), as catalyst supports have received much attention because their relatively large pore size (>2nm) and uniform porosity facilitate the reactant diffusion, increase the pore accessibility, and improve the dispersion of supported active components by confining them in the well-defined nanopores [1–6]. Our group has recently developed a facile soft-templating route for synthesis of either ordered or disordered MCs via self-assembly of phenolic resins and block copolymers [7–9], which allows a large-scale production of MCs unlike the multistep and costly hard-template synthesis of MCs by using mesoporous silica materials as hard-templates. The featured mesoporosity of MCs can be maintained upon graphitization at the temperature as high as 2873K, while their microporosity diminished [9]. The resulting graphitic MC (GMC) has been showed as promising supports of noble metals for a few catalytic applications [10–12]. Direct synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols, alternative fuels or fuel additives to gasoline, from synthesis gas (CO+H2) has received considerable interest worldwide in recent years in view of reducing CO2 emission and increasing energy security by using renewable sources (e.g., biomass) to produce liquid fuels indirectly via synthesis gas route. Synthesis gas conversion (i.e., CO hydrogenation) to alcohols can be described as the following stoichiometric equation: n CO + 2 n H 2 = C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( n - 1 ) H 2 O ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 … ) Hydrocarbons and CO2 are usually formed along with alcohol products by Fischer–Tropsch reaction, water–gas-shift (WGS) reaction, and Boudouard reaction. n CO + ( 2 n + 1 ) H 2 = C n H 2 n + 2 + n H 2 O ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 … ) (Fischer–Tropsch reaction) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 (WGS reaction) 2 CO = C + CO 2 (Boudouard reaction) Although substantial research work on the subject has been conducted since the 1920s when Fischer and Tropsch reported the synthesis of “synthol” (a mixture of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, and other compounds) from CO and H2 over an alkalized iron oxide catalyst at 10–15MPa and 673–523K [13], commercial application of the process is limited by insufficient yield and selectivity for desired higher alcohols. A number of thorough literature reviews [14–20] have focused on the catalyst systems identified for mixed alcohol synthesis, which can be generally classified into four categories: (a) precious Rh-based catalysts, (b) modified methanol synthesis catalysts based on Cu, (c) modified Fischer–Tripsch catalysts based on Co, Fe, and Ru, (d) modified Mo-based catalysts. Alkali-modified MoS2-based catalysts are recognized among the promising candidates because of their lower cost than Rh-based catalysts as well as relatively high yield and selectivity towards linear higher alcohols [17,20]. However, trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the feed were required to maintain the performance of MoS2 catalysts [21], and some organic sulfur compounds with the concentration of a few hundred ppm were found in the product [22]. In recent years, there has been increasing attention on exploring nonsulfided Mo-based catalysts such as carbides (β-Mo2C) [23], phosphides (MoP) [24], and oxides (MoOx) [25] for the mixed alcohol synthesis. β-Mo2C is known to be active for producing light hydrocarbons, CO2, and CH3OH from synthesis gas [26,27]. Promotion of β-Mo2C with alkali metal oxides can enhance the selectivity to higher alcohols but inhibit the overall activity [23,28–32]. Addition of Group VIII metals (e.g., Ni and Co) also has a promoting effect on the formation of higher alcohols [33]. As summarized by Zaman and Smith [20], the reported space time yield (STY) to total alcohols over promoted Mo2C catalysts vary generally between 50–350mg(hgcat)−1 at typical reaction conditions (523–603K, 3–10MPa, molar H2/CO=1–2), along with the alcohol selectivity up to 60mol-C% on CO2-free basis. Higher alcohols usually account for 30%–70% of total alcohols in terms of carbon selectivity. Carbon materials as the catalyst supports for synthesis gas conversion to mixed alcohols are thought to be advantageous over traditional metal oxide supports (e.g., SiO2 and Al2O3), because of their large surface area, limited interaction with catalytically active components, and relatively low selectivity to undesired hydrocarbons [34]. In particular, β-Mo2C on carbon supports can be synthesized facilely by temperature-programmed carburization of its oxide precursor (MoO3) with surface carbon species of the supports in flowing H2 (i.e., carbothermal hydrogen reduction) [35,36]. This method avoids the use of gaseous light hydrocarbons (e.g., CH4) as carburizing agents that have been known to induce the deposition of polymeric carbon on the active carbide surface during carburization [37]. For the mixed alcohol synthesis, a variety of carbon materials such as activated carbon [25,38,39] and multi-wall carbon nanotubes [40–42] were explored as the supports of MoS2- and MoOx-based catalysts, but there has been no published research focusing on the use of carbon materials, especially mesoporous carbon, as the supports of β-Mo2C catalysts. The present work aims to investigate the catalytic performance of β-Mo2C nanoparticles synthesized on GMC by carbothermal hydrogen reduction for CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols. Commercially available carbon materials such as activated charcoal (AC) and carbon black (CB) are also examined as the carbide supports for comparison with GMC. In addition, the promotion effect of K2CO3 on the higher alcohol formation over β-Mo2C/GMC is explored. The results indicate that GMC as the support leads to smaller carbide particles and higher catalytic activity than AC and CB. K2CO3-promoted β-Mo2C/GMC with optimized K/Mo ratio exhibits higher STY and selectivity for higher alcohols in comparison to typical Mn, Li, and Fe triply modified Rh/GMC catalyst, suggesting the graphitic mesoporous carbon is a promising support of β-Mo2C for higher alcohol synthesis."
1,Experimental,

Molybednum trioxide (MoO3, 99.9wt.%) powder was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Activated charcoal (produced from coconut) was purchased from EM Science. Carbon black (Vulcan XC-72R) was purchased from Cabot Corporation.

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of graphitic mesoporous carbon Graphitic mesoporous carbon (GMC) was synthesized by direct graphitization of mesoporous carbon (MC, ∼4g) in a high-temperature furnace (Thermal Technology Inc.) in flowing helium (∼150kPa, 15cm3 g−1 min−1) at 2473K for 1h with a heating ramp rate of 20Kmin−1. The MC was synthesized by carbonization of nanostructured polymeric composites, which were obtained by self-assembly of block copolymer (Pluronic F127) and phenolic resin (phloroglucinol-formaldehyde) under acidic conditions via the soft-template method [43]. In a typical synthesis of MC, a 2L flask was charged with 26.2g of phloroglucinol, 52.4g of F127, and 10.0g of aqueous HCl (37wt.%) in 1300mL of ethanol. The mixture was heated to reflux with stirring. To this solution, 26.0g of aqueous formaldehyde solution (37wt.%) was added. Precipitates appeared at about 4min after the addition of formaldehyde, indicating the formation of F127-phenolic resin polymeric composites. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2h and then filtered. The yellow polymer particles were washed with ethanol and dried in an oven at 393K for 3h. Carbonization was carried out under flowing N2 (4cm3 g−1 min−1) by heating the polymer particles (∼ 25g) to 1123K with a heating rate of 2Kmin−1 and maintaining the final temperature for 2h. 2.2.2 Preparation of carbon-supported and bulk β-Mo2C catalysts GMC-supported β-Mo2C (β-Mo2C/GMC) was prepared by carbothermal hydrogen reduction of a supported Mo-oxide (denoted as MoOx/GMC) at 973K for 3h in a flowing 4vol.% H2/Ar (100cm3 g−1 min−1) with a heating rate of 1Kmin−1, followed by passivation at room temperature (RT) for 6h in a stream of O2–N2–Ar mixture (∼1vol.% O2) in order to avoid bulk oxidation of the carbide upon exposure to air. MoOx/GMC was prepared by incipient wet impregnation of GMC at RT for 24h with a 5wt.% C2H5OH/H2O solution containing a required amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, followed by drying overnight at RT under vacuum and subsequently thermal treatment at 773K for 3h in flowing Ar (60cm3 g−1 min−1) with a heating rate of 2Kmin−1. The same protocols were followed to prepare activated charcoal- and carbon black-supported β-Mo2C catalysts. The nominal β-Mo2C loading was between 5–20wt.%, which was confirmed by using thermogravimetric analysis. K-promoted β-Mo2C/GMC (K/β-Mo2C/GMC) catalysts with atomic K/Mo ratio of 0.05–0.50 were prepared by incipient wet impregnation of 5wt.%β-Mo2C/GMC with a 50wt.% C2H5OH/H2O solution of K2CO3, followed by air drying at room temperature for 24h and subsequently thermal treatment in flowing N2 (60cm3 g−1 min−1) at 623K for 3h with a heating rate of 2Kmin−1. For comparison with K/β-Mo2C/GMC, Rh/GMC catalyst promoted triply with Mn, Li, and Fe oxides was prepared by incipient wet impregnation of GMC with an isopropanol solution of Rh(NO3)3, Mn(NO3)3, LiNO3, and Fe(NO3)3, followed by air drying at room temperature for 24h and subsequently thermal treatment in flowing N2 (60cm3 g−1 min−1) at 723K for 4h with a heating rate of 1Kmin−1. The nominal loading of Rh was 1.0wt.%, and the promoters of Mn, Li, and Fe were added in an optimized molar ratio of Rh/Mn/Li/Fe=1/1.9/1.1/0.1 reported by Yin et al. [44]. Bulk β-Mo2C was prepared by temperature-programmed reaction of MoO3 powder at 973K with 15vol.% CH4/H2 mixture (240cm3 g−1 min−1), followed by passivation at RT for 6h in a 1vol.% O2/He flow [45]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization N2 physisorption was performed on a Micromeritics Tristar analyzer at 77K. Prior to measurement, the sample was purged with flowing N2 at 423K for 2h. The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from the nitrogen adsorption data in the relative range (P/P 0) of 0.06–0.20 [46]. The total pore volume was determined from the amount of N2 uptake at a relative pressure of P/P 0 =0.95. The pore size distribution plot was derived from the adsorption branch of the isotherm based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model [47]. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ=0.154nm) radiation operating at 40kV and 40mA. The average crystallite size of β-Mo2C (d XRD in nm) was calculated by Scherrer equation d XRD =0.9λ/(B·cosθ) [48], where, λ is the wavelength of X-ray (0.154nm), B is the width of XRD pattern line at half peak height in radians, and θ is the angle between the incident and diffracted beams in degrees (2θ =39.4°). Electron microscopy was performed on a Hitachi HF-3300 field emission scanning transmission electron microsope (STEM) under bright-field and dark-field (Z-contrast) modes that operated at 300kV. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy of X-ray (EDX) was acquired with a JEOL-6060 scanning electron microscope using an electron energy of 10kV."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction CO hydrogenation was carried out in a single-pass tubular reactor (9.4mm i.d.×56cm length, silica-lined 316 stainless steel tube) with an axisymmetric thermowell in contact with the catalyst bed. For each run, the catalyst (0.1g except for bulk β-Mo2C, 74–125μm), diluted with quartz sand (1.0g), was reduced in situ in flowing H2 (40cm3 (STP)min−1) at 623K and ambient pressure for 2h. The catalytic experiments were performed at 573K, 3.0MPa total pressure, volumetric H2/CO ratio of 2, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 18000–54000cm3 (STP)(hgcat)−1. Bulk β-Mo2C was tested under the same conditions but a reduced amount (0.063g diluted with 1.0g quartz sand) in order to keep the β-Mo2C amount close to that contained in the supported carbide catalysts. The conversion of CO was below 10% under the employed reaction conditions to avoid temperature gradient along the catalyst bed. Our preliminary calculation suggested the lack of significant external and internal mass transport limitations on reaction rates under the typical reaction conditions (see Supplementary Data for details). The reactor effluent was analyzed on-line at regular intervals using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. Reactants and products were separated using two capillary columns in series: HP-Plot-Q (0.32mm o.d.×20μm film thickness×30m length) followed by HP-5 (0.32mm o.d.×1μm film thickness×30m length). CO and major products (CO2, CH4, methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol) were identified and calibrated by using their individual chemicals (>99% in purity) purchased from Air Liquide and Sigma–Aldrich. The conversion of CO (X CO) was reported as the fraction of CO that formed carbon-containing products according to Eq. (1), and the selectivity to carbon-containing product i (S i) were reported on a carbon basis according to Eq. (2): (1) X CO ( % ) = 100 · ∑ n i · C i / ∑ n i · C i + C CO (2) S i ( mol - C % ) = 100 · n i · C i / ∑ n i · C i where n i is the number of carbon atoms in product i, and C i and C CO are the molar concentrations of product i and unreacted CO in the reactor effluent. The measured carbon balance for all the tests was 95±10%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Porosity analysis of the carbon supports (GMC, AC, and CB) was performed by using N2 physisorption, and the obtained adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution are shown in Fig. 1 . According to the IUPAC classification [49], AC exhibits a type I isotherm, where the N2 adsorption amount increases with relative pressure (P/P 0) in the low-pressure range (P/P 0 <0.10) and almost levels off at higher P/P 0. This is a typical gas adsorption on microporous solids, and the total adsorption amount is limited by the accessible micropore volume of AC. The featured mesoporosity of GMC is indicated by a type IV isotherm with a type H2 hysteresis loop, while CB presents a type II isotherm indicative of gas sorption in the inter-particle voids of non-porous solids. However, both GMC and CB have appreciable N2 adsorption at low pressure (P/P 0 <0.01), suggesting their limited microporosity. The pore size distribution (Fig. 1B), calculated from the adsorption branch based on the BJH model, reveals the pore diameter of 9.0nm for GMC and <2nm for AC. CB has a relatively broad distribution of pore size in the range of 2–30nm. Table 1 lists the textural properties of the carbon supports. Before loading the active β-Mo2C, the micropore volume of AC, estimated to be 0.37cm3 g−1 by using t-plot method, accounts for ∼82% of its total pore volume, while GMC shows a very small fraction of micropores (∼1.9%). This further confirms the mesoporosity of GMC and microporosity of AC. In spite of possessing considerable micropores (∼17% of its total pore volume), the CB support is basically non-porous as suggested by its adsorption isotherm (Fig. 1). The contribution of micropore surface area to total surface area (i.e., BET surface area) is about 82%, 38%, and 7.6% for AC, CB, and GMC, respectively. After the loading of β-Mo2C (5–20wt.%), there are little changes in the BET and micropore surface areas, total and micropore volumes, and pore size of the three supports, suggesting no obvious pore blocking or structural collapse of the supports during the catalyst preparation. β-Mo2C supported on the carbon supports was synthesized by thermal decomposition of supported ammonium heptamolybdate to MoO3 in flowing Ar at 773K and subsequent carbothermal reduction of MoO3 in flowing H2 at 973K. The carbide formation proceeds in two consecutive steps during the carbothermal reduction process [35]: Mo O 3 + H 2 = Mo O 2 + H 2 O Mo O 2 + 1.5 C ∗ + H 2 Mo C 0.5 + CO + H 2 O (C∗ is the surface carbon atoms or carbon-containing groups of carbon materials) Phase structure and crystallite size of bulk and supported β-Mo2C were analysed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD); the obtained XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 2 . The distinct diffractions at 2θ =34.4°, 37.8°, 39.4°, 52.1°, 61.6° and 69.5° indicate the characteristic hexagonal close packed structure of β-Mo2C [36]. After the catalytic reaction of CO hydrogenation at 573K and 3MPa, the β-Mo2C phase structure is generally maintained as shown in Fig. 2B, but their corresponding XRD peaks become weakened to some extent. The crystallite size of β-Mo2C particles in the spent carbide catalysts was estimated by X-ray line broadening using Scherrer equation and is listed in Table 2 for correlation with their catalytic activity in the following Section 3.2. When compared at the same loading (5wt.% β-Mo2C), the size of carbide crystallites on the carbon supports increases in the order of β-Mo2C/GMC (14.8nm) < β-Mo2C/AC (19.5nm) < β-Mo2C/CB (22.8nm). The increase of β-Mo2C loading also results in larger carbide crystallites. Bulk β-Mo2C carburized at 973K using CH4/H2 mixture shows comparable crystallite size (16.6nm) to those carbon-supported carbide particles. The carbide particle size in the spent 5wt.%β-Mo2C/GMC, 5wt.%β-Mo2C/CB, and 5wt.%β-Mo2C/AC catalysts was further measured by scanning transmission electron microsope (STEM), and is shown in Table 2. Fig. 3 presents their representative STEM images, and the statistical size distribution of carbide particles in these catalysts is shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary Data. The bright-field STEM image (Fig. 3a) shows the distinct fringes of graphitic structure of GMC. Interestingly, the carbide particles on GMC have a bi-modal size distribution (Fig. S1), namely coexistence of small particles of 3–6nm (Fig. 3b) and large particles of 10–20nm (Fig. 3c), which leads to a statistical particle size of 11±4.9nm. Those large particles on GMC could form on the external surface because of their larger size than the mesopore diameter (9.0nm) of GMC. On the AC support, only large carbide particles (15±3.9nm) can be observed (Figs. 3d and 3e), suggesting that they are most probably located on the external surface of microporous AC support (pore size<2nm). Likewise, CB as the support provides similar particles in size (14.3±3.1nm) compared to those on AC (Figs. 3f-3h). As measured by STEM and X-ray line broadening (Table 3 ), the carbide particle size changes with the carbon supports in the same order, i.e., GMC<AC<CB, although the TEM-measured values are always a few nanometer lower. The well-defined mesoporosity of GMC could play a key role in the formation of those small carbide particles by offering them a confinement environment that limits the particle growth, although the differences in surface composition and chemistry between the carbon supports may also influence the particle size by providing different precursor-support interaction during the catalyst preparation."
8,Catalytic CO hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic CO hydrogenation 3.2.1 Effect of carbon supports and carbide loading Performance of the supported β-Mo2C catalysts for CO hydrogenation was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at nominally identical conditions of 573K, 3.0MPa total pressure, volumetric ratio H2/CO of 2, and GHSV of 36000cm3 (STP)(hgcat)−1. CH4, CO2, and CH3OH appear as major products, along with higher hydrocarbons (C2+–HC) and oxygenates (C2+–oxy) as minor products. The identified C2+–HC consist mainly of ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, and trace amount of C4–C6 hydrocarbons, while the C2+–oxy products include ethanol, acetaldehyde, 1-propanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate. An induction period of approximately 6–12h is required for the reaction to reach stable CO conversion and product selectivities (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data). Table 3 summarizes the steady-state CO conversion and product distribution over the β-Mo2C catalysts. When compared at the same carbide loading (5wt.%), the conversion of CO decreases in the order of β-Mo2C/GMC>bulk β-Mo2C>β-Mo2C/CB>β-Mo2C/AC. For β-Mo2C/GMC, medium carbide loading (10wt.%) leads to higher CO conversion in comparison to the loadings of 5 and 20wt.%. However, the CO conversion over β-Mo2C/CB decreases a little with increasing the carbide loading from 5 to 10wt.%. Similar product selectivities (e.g., 12–23mol-C% CO2, 29–44mol-C% CH4, and 25–41mol-C% CH3OH) are obtained over these catalysts except β-Mo2C/AC that gives much higher selectivities to CO2 (∼30mol-C%) and C2+–alcohols (∼29mol-C%) but a lower CH4 selectivity (∼19mol-C%). As shown in Table 2, the particle size of β-Mo2C varies with supports and carbide loading, most probably leading to the change in the amount of catalytically active sites located on the external surface of carbide particles. This could be the major reason for the activity difference between these β-Mo2C catalysts as shown in Table 3. In order to further elucidate this particle size-activity relationship, specific CO conversion rate normalized to the external surface of β-Mo2C is used to correlate with the carbide particle size. However, there has been lack of effective methods to experimentally identify and quantify the active sites of β-Mo2C under typical conditions of syngas conversion, because the working surface of β-Mo2C in composition and structure is a complex function of reaction conditions and kinetics, totally different with the clean surface of fresh carbide catalysts as revealed by theoretical calculation [50] and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterization [31]. Therefore, in the present study, the external surface of β-Mo2C was estimated by calculation assuming the carbide particles as spherical shape with the diameter determined from XRD data (see Table 2), and then was used to calculate the areal specific rate for CO conversion (r CO, mmol(hm2)−1) according to Eq. (3): (3) r CO = 10 3 · X CO · ( F W ) SA Mo2C = 10 3 · X CO · ( F W ) w Mo2C π 6 · d Mo2C 3 · D Mo2C · π d Mo2C 2 = 10 3 · X CO · F · d Mo2C · D Mo2C 6 · W · w Mo2C where X CO (%) is the conversion of CO, F (molh−1) is the molar flow rate of CO, W (g) is the catalyst amount, w Mo2C (wt.%) is the carbide loading, D Mo2C (9.18×106 gm−3) is the bulk density of β-Mo2C, and d Mo2C (m) is average crystallite diameter of β-Mo2C determined by X-ray line broadening as shown in Table 2. Fig. 4 shows the areal specific rates for CO conversion over carbon-supported and bulk β-Mo2C catalysts as a function of carbide particle size. Independent of the carbon supports except for AC, the specific rate decreases linearly with the increases of particle size, suggesting that small carbide particles favor the CO conversion. This could be due to relatively large fraction of edge/corner sites on the external surface of small particles, which could be the catalytically active sites for the reaction but have not been understood clearly so far. When compared at similar particle size, bulk β-Mo2C exhibits a comparable specific rate to those carbon-supported carbide catalysts, suggesting a weak effect of carbide–carbon interaction on the catalytic properties of β-Mo2C catalysts. GMC appears to be a preferable support of β-Mo2C in terms of its ability for the formation of smaller carbide particles resulting in higher catalytic activity, but the selectivity for higher alcohols (C2+–OH) over all the tested β-Mo2C catalysts is generally poor. It is interesting that β-Mo2C/AC exhibits greatly enhanced C2+–OH selectivity in comparison to other carbide catalysts (Table 3), in spite of its much lower areal specific rate for CO conversion when compared at similar carbide particle size (Fig. 4). This unusual performance could be due to the effect of mineral impurities contained in the AC support that is produced commercially from coconut. The ash content of AC measured by burning carbon off at 973K is about 1.9wt.%; the elemental composition of the ash analysed by EDX is 34wt.% K, 5.6wt.% Na, 3.3wt.% Si, 3.0wt.% Fe, 2.7wt.% Mg, and the balance of C, O, and P. The increased selectivity for higher alcohols over β-Mo2C/AC seems to be related to the alkaline elements which are often used as the promoters of bulk β-Mo2C catalysts [23,28–32]. In the following Section 3.2.2, a small amount of K compound (as K2CO3) was added to 5wt.% β-Mo2C/GMC catalyst with atomic K/Mo ratios of 0.05–0.50 to investigate the promoter effect. 3.2.2 Effect of K2CO3 promoter The phase structure (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data) and particle size (Table 2) of β-Mo2C in β-Mo2C/GMC are well maintained when K2CO3 is added at molar K/Mo=0.1, but the increase of the K/Mo ratio higher than 0.2 leads to an obvious weakening of characteristic XRD peaks of β-Mo2C phase and simultaneously appearance of a weak reflection at 2θ =36.4° that could be attributed to K2CO3 [30]. Fig. 5 shows the steady-state performance of K2CO3-promoted 5wt.%β-Mo2C/GMC catalysts (K/β-Mo2C/GMC) for the CO hydrogenation as a function of molar K/Mo ratio in the range between 0.05–0.50. As the K/Mo ratio increases, the overall activity in terms of CO conversion decreases continuously (Fig. 5A), but the selectivity for C2+–OH (mainly C2H5OH and 1-C3H7OH) is enhanced dramatically up to ∼35mol-C% with total alcohol selectivity higher than 50mol-C% (Fig. 5B). The space time yield (STY) for C2+–OH reaches a maximum of 64mg(hgcat)−1 at medium K/Mo ratio of 0.1 (Fig. 5C), comparable to those obtained over K-promoted bulk β-Mo2C (∼80mg(hgcat)−1) [30] and carbon-supported K-doped MoS2 catalysts (∼60mg(hgcat)−1) [38,41] under similar reaction temperatures (573–598K) but higher pressures (5–10MPa). The formation of CH3OH and undesired CH4 in terms of selectivity and STY is suppressed greatly with the addition of K2CO3 as shown in Figs. 5B and 5C, while the CO2 selectivity increases from 12 to ∼35mol-C% (Fig. 5A). The physical blockage of carbide surface sites by K2CO3 could reduce the amount of catalytically active sites and consequently lead to the loss of overall activity. The enhanced C2+–OH formation is likely associated with the increased electron density of β-Mo2C as a result of the charge donation from K atoms/ions to nearby carbide [51]. This increased electron density could reduce the hydrogenation activity of β-Mo2C, suppressing the direct hydrogenation of “C1 reaction intermediates” to CH4 and CH3OH. Simultaneously, the chain growth via the C1 intermediates to higher alcohols/hydrocarbons would be favored. The increased CO2 formation is often observed over alkali-promoted carbide and sulfide catalysts [30,38,41], and is thought to proceed via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction [20]. The alkali oxides could promote the WGS reaction by weakening the C–H bond in active formate intermediates and thus accelerating their decomposition to CO2 as proposed for noble metal-based WGS catalysts [52]. The change of product distribution over K/β-Mo2C/GMC (5wt.% β-Mo2C and K/Mo=0.1) with CO conversion was studied by conducting the reaction at various GHSV (Table 3) in order to compare with β-Mo2C/AC at similar conversion. As shown in Table 4 , the conversion decreases from 5.3% to 2.1% with increasing the GHSV from 18000 to 54000cm3 (STP)(hgcat)−1, while the total selectivity for alcohols increases by 4.5mol-C%. Simultaneously, the selectivities for CO2 and total hydrocarbons reduce by 5.7 and 5.4mol-C%, respectively. This dependence of product selectivity on the conversion is consistent with that reported for MgO-supported β-Mo2C catalysts [31]. Compared with β-Mo2C/AC at similar conversion (2.1% vs. 1.3%), K/β-Mo2C/GMC show similar product distribution, confirming that the unusual catalytic performance of β-Mo2C/AC is related to the promoter effect of those alkaline elements contained in the AC support. However, relatively large carbide particles in β-Mo2C/AC reduce its catalytic activity significantly in terms of STY for alcohol products. 3.2.3 Comparison between promoted β-Mo2C and Rh catalysts Precious Rh catalysts promoted by alkali and transition metal compounds are well-known for catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to ethanol, but their practical application is limited by the high cost of Rh. For comparison with K/β-Mo2C/GMC (5wt.% β-Mo2C and K/Mo=0.1), Table 4 lists the steady-state catalytic performance of Rh/GMC catalyst triply promoted with Mn, Fe, and Li oxides for the CO hydrogenation at 573K and 3.0MPa. The Rh catalyst was prepared with an optimized composition of 1wt.% Rh and molar Rh/ Mn/Li/Fe=1/1.9/1/0.1 that was reported in the literature [44]. When compared at similar conversion level (∼2 %), the promoted carbide catalyst shows higher C2+–OH selectivity (30 vs. 25mol-C%) and STY (71 vs. 46mg(hgcat)−1) than the promoted Rh counterpart, although the formation of CH3OH over the former is lowered significantly. This suggests that alkali-promoted β-Mo2C is of promising alternatives to expensive Rh-based catalysts for synthesis gas conversion to higher alcohols. However, the STY of C2+–OH over these studied β-Mo2C catalysts are still insufficient to justify their practical application, as compared to the benchmark (1300–1500mg(hgcat)−1) for methanol yield in commercial methanol synthesis processes [17]. Thus, significant efforts in optimizing catalyst composition/structure and reaction condition are still required in the future for further enhancement of higher alcohol selectivity and yield."
9,Conclusions,"β-Mo2C nanoparticles were synthesized on graphitic mesoporous carbon and other commercial carbon supports by carbothermal hydrogen reduction for catalytic CO hydrogenation to alcohols. The areal specific rates for CO conversion over these supported and bulk β-Mo2C catalysts decrease linearly with increasing carbide particle size, independent of the carbon supports. GMC appears to be a preferable support of β-Mo2C to microporous activated charcoal and non-porous carbon black because of its ability for the formation of small carbide particles resulting in higher catalytic activity. Promotion of β-Mo2C/GMC with a minor amount of K2CO3 (K/Mo ratio=0.05–0.50) enhances the CO2-free selectivity of higher alcohols (C2+–OH) up to 35mol-C% (the selectivity for total alcohols higher than 50mol-C%), while those undesired hydrocarbons and CO2 are suppressed significantly. At optimized K/Mo ratio of 0.1, the K2CO3-promoted β-Mo2C/GMC catalyst shows higher selectivity (30 vs. 25mol-C% on CO2-free basis) and space time yield (71 vs. 46mg(hgcat)−1) for higher alcohols than typical Rh/GMC catalyst promoted triply with Mn, Li, and Fe oxides."
