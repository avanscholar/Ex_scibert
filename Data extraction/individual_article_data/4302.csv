0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is reactive oxygen abundant in living organisms and is also known as a biomarker owing to its important physiological role in aging and disease [1,2]. H2O2 has used for its widespread applications in various fields including environmental protection, food industry, fuel cells and clinical diagnosis [3–5]. In addition, H2O2 determination has major importance in biomedical and academic applications [6]. Until now, various analytical techniques have been applied for the detection and quantification of H2O2 such as fluorescence [7], chemiluminescence [8], chromatography [9] and electrochemistry [1,2,10]. Among the mentioned methods, electrochemical technique has been accepted superior the others for the determination of H2O2 because of its great advantages such as good selectivity, rapid response, high sensitivity, rapidity, simplicity, cost and portability [1,5]. The sensitivities of electrochemical sensors are mostly related to the choice of electrode materials. Thus, the researchers are focused on electrode modifications and have studied a lot of materials for the electrochemical detection of H2O2 [6]. The electrochemical of H2O2 determination usually occurs into two types, enzymatic and non-enzymatic. Non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors were generally preferred in recent years because of their less affection from temperature and pH than electrochemical enzyme sensors [11,12]. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been significantly explored as enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor material owing to its stability, low cost, biocompatibility, excellent heat endurance and high resistance to chemicals such as strong acids and bases [1,6,12]. In addition, g-C3N4 was extensively used in much researches such as photocatalytic activity and H2 production because of its unique chemical and thermal stability, low cost, appropriate band gap (2.7 eV) [13]. Since the internal structure of the g-C3N4 possesses abundant uniform nitrogen coordinators that can provide more metal coordination sites during the electrocatalytic process, the electrocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 can be reasonably developed by appropriate modification [14]. Copper (II) oxide (CuO) is a p-type semiconductor with an energy band gap (about 1.5 eV) and high isoelectric point. It has been widely used in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [15], Li-ion batteries [16], gas sensors [17], biomolecule detections [18]. In addition, CuO shows excellent redox property and chemical stability under different reaction conditions [19]. Therefore, CuO and CuO nanostructures have been investigated as nonenzymatic sensor for acetaminophen, tryptophan [20], uric acid biosensor [21], glucose, dopamine [19] and ethanol sensing [22]. The electronic conductivity as a factor restrict the electrochemical performance of CuO-based electrodes. CuO can be combined with carbonaceous materials to increase electronic conductivity [23]. Carbon and carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and g-C3N4 have been used extensively in electroanalytical studies due to their unique properties to prevent agglomeration of nanoscale inorganic materials during electrochemical processes [6]. In terms of the coated carbon, the electronic conductivity and the diffusion of electrolyte ions within g-C3N4 layers are better than amorphous carbon layers. As a result, g-C3N4 coated materials would show better electrochemical performance [24,25]. Therefore, CuO/g-C3N4 is feasible to meet with the demand of high performance electrode materials. Rahman and co-workers investigated for the synthesized g-C3N4@CuO and its application in the oxidation of alcohol to corresponding aldehydes and ketones [26]. Huang's group reported that the obtained sensors based on CuO/g-C3N4, show good detection for both glucose and dopamine [19]. Zhang's team developed graphitic carbon coated hollow CuO (denoted as H–CuO@GC) spheres as electrode material for supercapacitors [23]. Bai et al. reported g-C3N4 coated CuO nanorod heterojunction catalysts with outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production ability were synthesized via a novel molten salt-assisted microwave process [27]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report related to this electrode design for H2O2 detection to date. In this study, a CuO/g-C3N4 composite was dropped onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface and then applied for H2O2 detection. So far, CuO/g-C3N4 composite has not yet been evaluated to detect H2O2. The obtained sensor based on CuO/g-C3N4 has showed good sensing and detection range, limit and prominent stability performance for H2O2. This study is expected to leading the improvement of new electrochemical sensors for H2O2 detection."
1,Experimental,The details of reagents and instruments are included in Supplementary Material.
2,Preparation of CuO/g-C3N4 composite,"2.1 Preparation of CuO/g-C3N4 composite g-C3N4 powder was prepared with calcination method [28]. Firstly, melamine as precursor was transferred into a closed crucible and calcined at 500 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 for 2 h. Following that, the temperature was kept constant at 520 °C for 2 h for further deammoniation. Then, g-C3N4 which was yellow powder material was obtained. The CuO/g-C3N4 composite was synthesized according to the procedure of Qin et al. with some modification [29]. Firstly, 1.208 g of Cu(NO3)2.3H2O was dissolved in deionized water (DW) and then 0.5 M NaOH was added into the solution. At this stage, the color of the solution changed from bright blue to air blue. Subsequently, 0.012 g of g-C3N4 was dispersed in DW with ultrasonication for 1 h, and then g-C3N4 dispersion was added into the above mixture. Then, the mixture was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 20 h. Finally, the CuO/g-C3N4 composite was washed with DW and ethanol, respectively and dried at 70 °C for overnight. The synthesis method of CuO/g-C3N4 composite was shown in Scheme 1 . For comparison, the preparation of the pure CuO was carried out using the same above method. In addition, the fabrication process of CuO/g-C3N4 with various mass ratios CuO:g-C3N4 (wt:wt); 100:1, 50:1 and 25:1 were synthesized, respectively. So, the ratio with the highest current response was studied."
3,Fabrication of the CuO/g-C3N4 modified GCE,"2.2 Fabrication of the CuO/g-C3N4 modified GCE 3 mg mL−1 of CuO/g-C3N4 containing 0.5% nafion was stirred under ultrasonication for 30 min. Before the coating, the GCE (with a geometrical area of 0.071 cm2) as polished with 0.3 μm and 0.05 μm α-alumina powder slurries and sonicated with DW and absolute ethanol, respectively. Then, 8 μL of CuO/g-C3N4 was cast onto the clean GCE surface and allowed to dry at room condition. The CuO and g-C3N4 modified GCE were fabricated similar to CuO/g-C3N4 modified GCE according to above procedure. The procedure of fabrication of CuO/g-C3N4 on GCE was illustrated in Scheme 1. All experiments were carried out triple and the results were defined as the mean value (standard deviation is ±3%)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples The XRD patterns of the all samples were obtained to expose crystal phase in Fig. 1 (A) . The characteristic peak of pure g-C3N4 accorded to the (002) diffraction plane of the graphitic material, which consisted of the interlayer structural of aromatic rings was arisen at 27.6° [19,29]. In CuO, two major diffraction peaks located at 35.43° and 38.69° can be assigned to the (002) and (111) diffraction planes of a monoclinic structure of CuO, respectively [19,29,30]. This result also confirms the existence of a CuO phase in the CuO/g-C3N4 composite. Thus, the obtained results indicated that g-C3N4 and CuO were existed on the CuO/g-C3N4 composite [19,29]. Fig. 1 (B) illustrates the FTIR spectra of all samples. For g-C3N4, the sharp absorption peak at 806 cm−1 appeared evidence of the out-of-plane skeletal bending vibration characteristics of C–N heterocycles which are triazine units [31]. In addition, the band located in between 1200 and 1700 cm−1 were associated with the typical C–N and CN stretching mode [31,32]. In the CuO spectrum, the main band absorption peak correlating with the stretching vibration of Cu–O band was from around 469 cm−1 [33]. In the case of the CuO/g-C3N4 composite, the peaks at 1640 and 1352 cm−1 correspond to the characteristic vibrations of the C–N and CN bonds, respectively. Also, the absorption band at about 479 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of Cu–O. Furthermore, the broad band between 3000 and 3500 cm−1 could be attributed to the adsorbed water molecules [29,33]. This result confirms the formation of CuO/g-C3N4 and is in accordance with the result obtained by XRD. Fig. 2 depicts the SEM photographs of g-C3N4, CuO and CuO/g-C3N4 composite. It can be seen from Fig. 2 (a) that g-C3N4 exists a remarkable agglomeration and a larger particle which is of some curly structures. The SEM micrograph of CuO exhibits obviously flake and sheet morphology in Fig. 2 (b) [29]. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), we can see that the obtained CuO/g-C3N4 looks like flake. After formation of CuO/g-C3N4, the composite surface converts to more flake and sheet image [34], indicating that the CuO/g-C3N4 composite was loaded on the GCE and also the increased surface area of the GCE. Therefore, the composite may exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance. The EDX spectrum of CuO/g-C3N4 composite is shown in Fig. 2 (d). In addition, the weight percentages of elemental Cu, O, C and N were detected at table of elemental compositions of CuO/g-C3N4 composite in Fig. 2 (d) inset."
6,Electrochemical characterizations of modified electrodes,"3.2 Electrochemical characterizations of modified electrodes To examine the interface properties of the surface modified electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used and the EIS spectrum has a semicircle diameter that corresponds to electron-transfer resistance at higher frequencies (Ret). Fig. 3 (A) demonstrates the EIS Nyquist graphs of bare GCE, g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE in 0.1 M K3/4Fe(CN)6 solution including 0.1 M KCl and along with an equivalent circuit model (inset in Fig. 3 (A)). According to Fig. 3 (A) inset, Rs is the total resistance of electrolyte, electrode, current collector and separator. C and Rct are the capacitance and charge transfer resistance. W is the Warburg impedance related to the diffusion/transport of ions in the electrolyte to the surface of the electrode [35]. The bare GCE electrode illustrates a large semicircle diameter with Ret 4370 Ω than g-C3N4/GCE (Ret = 2810 Ω) [36]. In addition, the CuO/GCE (Ret = 1634 Ω) shows a bigger semicircle than the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE and a smaller than the bare GCE electrode [37]. Compared with the other GCE electrodes, the impedance spectrum of the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE consisted of a small semicircle (Ret = 1287 Ω) which exhibited that the electron-transfer resistance decreased implying that the metal oxides film facilitates electron transfer. Thus, the Ret values for different GCE electrodes were provided in the following order: GCE > g-C3N4/GCE > CuO/GCE > CuO/g-C3N4/GCE, which indicates that the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE composite has higher electrochemical activity and conductivity [20]. So, the presence of g-C3N4 plays a major role inaccelerating the transfer of the electrons. These changes also displayed that CuO and g-C3N4 were well attached to the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of a molecule that is adsorbed onto the electrode surface. Fig. 3 (B) exhibits CV curves of bare GCE, g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE in 0.1 M K3/4Fe(CN)6 solution including 0.1 M KCl. The peak current value of about I = 39.10 μA at the bare GCE, exhibited a significant increase in the peak current after electrode modification. The peak current value of I = 66.77 μA at the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE, showing an increment electron transfer rate of K3/4Fe(CN)6 at the modified electrode surface [11]. This results demonstrated the good electrochemical performance of the modified electrode. In addition, the electroactive surface areas of bare GCE, g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE were determined using according to Fig. 3 (B). The active surface area of an electrode can be calculated using the Randles–Sevcik equation [38,39]: (1a) I p = ( 2.69 x 10 5 ) n 3 / 2 AC * D 1 / 2 v 1 / 2 where Ip represents the redox peak current (μA); n expresses the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction; D belongs to the diffusion coefficient in solution (K3/4Fe(CN)6 = 7.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1); C* is the concentration of K3/4Fe(CN)6 in mol cm−3 which is 0.1; ν is the scan rate (50 mV s−1); A denotes the effective surface area of the electrode (cm2). Comparing with the surface areas of the other modified electrodes, the surface area of the GCE (0.071 cm2) is smallest. After that, the electrochemically active surface areas were calculated to be 0.0741, 0.0802 and 0.1234 cm2 for g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE. This result shows that CuO/g-C3N4/GCE has a faster electron transfer rate [40]. In addition, the comparison investigation of the electrochemical response of H2O2 at different electrodes is demonstrated in Fig. 3 (C), which is the CVs of bare GCE, g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) in the presence of 50 μM H2O2. It is obvious that the CV response current of H2O2 on CuO/g-C3N4/GCE is higher than those other modified GCE [41]. Fig. 3 (C) inset displays the CVs of bare GCE, g-C3N4/GCE, CuO/GCE and CuO/g-C3N4/GCE in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) in the absence of 50 μM H2O2. Compared to the other modified GCE, CuO/g-C3N4/GCE exhibited the highest intensity of current, which can be attributed to the fact that CuO and g-C3N4 have good conductivity together. The electrochemical behaviors of H2O2 with different pH and various scan rates were investigated for understanding the reaction mechanism on the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE. The influence of different scan rate at the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE was performed with CV in Fig. 4 (A) . The H2O2 oxidation current was noticed to enhancement with scan rate from 10.0 to 300.0 mV s−1. There is a linear relationship between the oxidation peak currents and the scan rate (as shown in Fig. 4 (A) inset). The slope obtained from the linear behavior between the peak current towards scan rate for H2O2 was expressed as 6.39 × 10−7 (R2 = 0.9913), which suggested a surface-controlled electrochemical process [42,43]. Fig. 4 (B) demonstrates the evaluation of CuO/g-C3N4/GCE for H2O2 detection in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution containing 50 μM H2O2 at scan rate 50 mV s−1 at various pHs. With the pH of electrolyte increasing from 5 to 7, the response potentials of H2O2 shifted slightly towards the negative potential. According to the linear relationship between peak potential and pH (inset in Fig. 4 (B)), the slope value was calculated to be −0.042 V pH−1 (R2 = 0.9874). In addition, the peak current (21.92 μA) at pH 7 was higher than that at other pH, showing the catalytic activity of this sensor is more effective at pH 7 [44]."
7,Analytical performance of the CuO/g-C3N4 composite modified GCE for H2O2,"3.3 Analytical performance of the CuO/g-C3N4 composite modified GCE for H2O2 Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) is the main pulsed technique used in biosensor. Because, it has a main advantage of the low capacitive current, which can improve the sensitivity of the voltammetric procedure. So, the successful fabrication of the sensor was confirmed by using DPV experiments. To study the effect of the composite on the surface of GCE, CuO/g-C3N4 modified GCE was fabricated from different mass ratios (100:1, 50:1 and 25:1) of CuO (wt): g-C3N4 (wt). Then, the signals against current of each electrode in the presence of 50 μM H2O2 were compared (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Among these responses, the electrode prepared at a ratio of 100:1 (CuO (wt): g-C3N4 (wt)) exhibited the highest current response. Thus, CuO/g-C3N4 was prepared at the determined ratio in subsequent studies. Fig. 5 (A) displays the DPV curves of the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE to H2O2 at various concentrations (0.5–50 μM) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). The DPV responses increased proportionally with rising analyte concentration. The sensitivity of the biosensor prepared from the slope of the calibration graph shown in Fig. 5 (B) was reckoned as 3.327 μA μM−1 cm−2. The detection limit (LOD) was calculated to be 0.31 μM following 3σ/sensitivity, in which σ symbolizes the deviation after 10 parallel analysis using 0.5 μM H2O2 [41]. The concentration of analyte with the linear regression equation could be found as I (μA) = 0.2362 C(H2O2) (μM) + 19.9486 (R2 = 0.9975). These results exhibit that the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE possesses apparent catalytic effect on the electrochemical oxidation of H2O2 and can be applied to a lower concentration of H2O2 detection. The mechanism of CuO/g-C3N4/GCE for H2O2 detection could be elaborated by the following reactions. In the solution of phosphate buffer, the H2O2 was reduced via the mechanism shown below with Eqs. (1–3) [45]: (1) H 2 O 2 + e − ⇌ OH ads + OH − (2) OH ads + e − ⇌ OH − (3) 2 OH − + 2 H + ⇌ 2 H 2 O When the CuO/g-C3N4 composite were deposited on the GCE, the reduction of H2O2 was happened irreversible. A reaction of decomposition of H2O2 to H2O and O2 by is shown in Eq. (4) [46,47]. (4) 2 H 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 O + O 2 Based on Table 1 , the obtained results performed better than several similar published results. Liu et al. studied H2O2 sensors by using Nafion/Hb/MoS2/GCE and they found the LOD as 6.7 μM [48]. Liu et al. reported the electrochemical performance of PdNP/CNT fiber for the determination of H2O2 and they found the LOD as 2 μM [49]. Singh et al. studied the brominated graphene (GBR) (mimetic catalase) coated GCE 0.1–10 mM H2O2 concentration range with a LOD of 63 μM using DPV technique [50]. Wang and coworkers investigated the electrochemical effects of Pd NPs/bilayer graphene films (BGFs)/GCEs toward H2O2 detection and they determined the LOD as 1.5 μM [51]. However, Guo et al. [52] and Song et al. [53] found lower LOD than our present study. Although this may seem like an advantage, it actually has disadvantages. Guo et al. used the CV method but the DPV method is more sensitive [52]. In addition, Song et al. studied the high concentration range at wide values [53]. According to these two studies, our study has a bit too high LOD value considering the concentration range and DPV method. On the basis of these results, this research exhibited a low concentration range and better detection limit."
8,"Reproducibility, stability and interference studies of the sensor","3.4 Reproducibility, stability and interference studies of the sensor The reproducibility of CuO/g-C3N4 using three detached sensors produced under the same conditions was performed with comparing the DPV peak signals of 50 μM H2O2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution, pH 7.0 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). The relative standard deviation (RSD) was 2.92%, indicating a remarkable reproducibility of the CuO/g-C3N4 fabrication. With regard to stability, the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE was measured the current response after sample storage at 4 °C over several weeks. No significant changes in the current response were observed during the first one weeks. After two months storage time, 92% H2O2 was recovered, showing a good performance of sensor. The interference studies were performed with the DPV response in presence of some interferents such as ascorbic acid (AA), glucose (G) and urea (U) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). The selectivity of the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE toward H2O2 was studied by calculating the peak current. The current responses given by only H2O2 (50 μM) is found as 0.37 μA whereas H2O2 (50 μM) in the presence of mixture containing all the other analytes [AA, G, U (500 μM of each)] are found as 0.363 μA. The generated current responses were not significantly affected by interfering species (the peak current change was below 3%). This result shows that the CuO/g-C3N4/GCE has a conspicuous selectivity, reproducibility and excellent stability for H2O2 detection."
9,Application in real samples,"3.5 Application in real samples The feasibility of the prepared sensor in real analysis was investigated by analyzing H2O2 in a commercial makeup remover sample (obtained from a local market). To testify, the sample (0.1 mL) was diluted to 10 mL with in 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution (pH 7.0) and analyzed via DPV technique and then measured by the standard addition method. Recoveries of H2O2 were studied by the addition of four different concentrations of H2O2 (5, 10, 15 and 30 μM) in makeup remover sample. The satisfactory results were obtained for H2O2 in Table 2 . According to Table 2, the RSD for the determination of the H2O2 was less than 3.2%. These results demonstrated that the fabricated sensor presented a suitable application in detecting H2O2 in makeup remover."
10,Conclusion,"The obtained CuO/g-C3N4 material exhibits remarkable reproductivity and excellent stability for H2O2 electrochemical sensor, and offers an efficient method to fabricate applicable in human health, environment and other fields. In this study, we prepared CuO/g-C3N4 composite by using hydrothermal process and evaluated its electrochemical performance for H2O2 detection. The CuO/g-C3N4/GCE exhibited rapid response to H2O2 with a linear range of 0.5–50 μM, a low detection limit of 0.31 μM and an excellent reproducibility (RSD = 2.92%). In this way, the fabricated non-enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical sensor demonstrated impeccable performances than most of the reported enzymatic H2O2 sensors. In particular, the usage of composites and nanomaterials possess major significance for improving the selectivity and activity of nonenzymatic electrochemical sensor in the future."
