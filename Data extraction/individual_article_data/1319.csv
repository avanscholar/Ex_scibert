0,Introduction,"Glycerol (1, 2, 3-propanetriol), a chemical product with wide applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries, is considered as a versatile starting material for the production of various value-added commodity chemicals and fuels, because it is now a biomass-derived platform molecule co-produced from the transesterification process for biodiesel production (about 100 kg of glycerol are produced per ton of biodiesel) [1–3]. The continuous calling on transition from reliance on fossil sources to more sustainable alternatives accelerated the fast development of bio-based chemical industry, such as biodiesel, leading to effective utilization of glycerol is of paramount importance to improve the biodiesel economic viability [4–6]. In the last years, intensive research efforts from all over the world have been invested for transforming glycerol to important building blocks such as acrolein, acrylic acid, propanediol, divinyl glycol, allyl alcohol, dihydroxyacetone, acetol, pyruvaldehyde, lactic acid, acrylonitrile, aromatics, and so on, through reforming, hydrogenolysis, dehydration, redox processes, esterification and etherification reactions or a combination of the aforementioned [7–10]. Besides lots of studies focused on acrolein, divinyl glycol, etc., few works have focused on allyl alcohol. Allyl alcohol, possessing CC and COH groups in one molecule, is used as an important intermediate in chemical industry to produce allyl diglycol carbonate, allyl glycidyl ether, allyl methacrylate, diallyl phthalate, 1,4-butanediol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, poly(styrene-allyl alcohol), etc., though additions, substitutions, decompositions, oxidations, re-arrangements and polymerisation reactions [11]. These allyl alcohol derivatives are present in perfume, pharmaceutical and food formulations and are also a building block in the manufacture of various chemical compounds such as coupling agents, plasticizers, crosslinking agents and coating additives [12]. Nowadays, the industrial production of allyl alcohol is fossil resources-based routes depending on propene via acrolein reduction, propylene oxide isomerization, or acetoxylation of propylene [13]. The supply of propylene is threatened by an unbalanced offer/demand issue from the wide use of shale gas and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) cracking [12,13]. Therefore, based on the huge market requirement for allyl alcohol, propene price (offer), renewable energy, and environment aspects, investigating bio-routes of glycerol conversion to allyl alcohol bright forecast for industrial valorization and fit the sustainable development of renewable energy resource. It was early reported that allyl alcohol directly synthesized from glycerol could be achieved in liquid phase though formic acid-assisted DODH (deoxydehydration) or Re-based catalyzed DODH, sacrificing a stoichiometric reductant of formic, phosphine, or alcohols under air conditions [14–16]. The Re-based catalysts containing methyltrioxorhenium (MeReO3, MTO), NaReO4, NH4ReO4, or supported Re-oxide catalysts (such as ReOx/SiO2, ReOx/Al2O3, ReOx/TiO2, and ReOx/CeO2), yielded ally alcohol of 70 % ∼ 90 %/per running [17–22]. Later, a heterogeneous ReOx−Pd/CeO2 and ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst were reported yielding allyl alcohol of 91 %, using dioxane as solvent and hydrogen as reductant in a high pressure (8 MPa) [23,24]. Despite these aforementioned methods already enable reaching high yields in allyl alcohol from glycerol, which challenged expensive sacrificial additives, prolonged reaction times, limited recyclability, or high pressure. Besides, rhenium is one of the rarest expensive elements on earth, and little is known about its long-term toxicity. Inspired by acrolein hydrogenation to allyl alcohol over Ag-based catalysts and the study on gas-glycerol conversion to acrolein with selectivity of 60–90 %, bifunctional Ag/ZSM-5 catalysts was designed and used for gas-glycerol to allyl alcohol though dehydration-hydrogenation reaction [25]. However, the allyl alcohol yield was about 15 % under the sacrificial H2 in pressure of 4 MPa despite the catalyst can run for 100 h. Alternatively, glycerol can also directly convert into allyl alcohol over Re- and Mo-based catalysts without any sacrificial additives, in which the glycerol itself acts as the reductant [26]. The theoretical maximum selectivity of allyl alcohol through this pathway is only 50 %, but other valuable chemicals can be co-produced. The glycerol in liquid phase over homogeneous or heterogeneous Re-, Mo- and V-based catalysts can yield allyl alcohol about 10–34 % /per running at atmosphere with the reaction temperature of 165−275 °C [26,27]. At the same time, Liu et al. reported that about 24 % of allyl alcohol yielded from glycerol (Con. 99 %) over the FeOx catalysts through continuous-flow gas-solid heterogeneous reaction, which showed attractive advantages of low raw-material cost, high-efficiency simple reaction, no separation, and mild reaction condition [28]. The MoO3-WO3/TiO2 or Fe-based oxide catalysts, such as Fe/Al2O3, γ-Al2O3/(Fe2O3)0.16, ZrO2–FeOx, H-ZSM5/Fe especially for base metals (K, Rb etc.) modified ZrO2(7%)-FeOx/Rb and K/ZrO2-FeOx catalysts, are further reported capable for the direct DODH of gas-glycerol to allyl alcohol [29–31]. The gas-glycerol conversion and the selectivity of allyl alcohol can reach 75–95 % and 15–30 %, respectively, yielding allyl alcohol of about 11–21 %. But, these catalysts challenged rapid deactivation (6 h) resulting from coke deposits. VOx supported beta zeolite catalysts were recently reported showing catalytic activity for gas-glycerol conversion to allyl alcohol, and the allyl alcohol selectivity reached 30 % at 20 % conversion of glycerol after Cs being exchanged into the catalyst [32]. On this way, our group designed and prepared a series of supported MoFe bimetal oxide catalysts with improved catalytic activity and stability, such as MoFe/TiO2, MoFe/CeO2 and MoFe/KIT-6 oxide catalysts, over which the yield of ally alcohol can reach about 19–26 % [33–35]. Studies revealed both moderate-acid sites and redox sites are key active centers for this reaction, and neutral or weak oxidizing support (TiO2, CeO2, or SiO2, especially for KIT-6 with ordered developed mesoporous structure and high specific surface area) is superior to acid or base support for MoFe oxides showing high catalytic performance. Following our works, the MoFe/ZSM-5 oxide catalysts were designed and prepared by Kostyniuk et al., over which the allyl alcohol selectivity increased to 46 % from 10 wt% glycerol feed [36]. These studies indicated this strategy for allyl alcohol synthesis from bio-glycerol showed bright potential utilization, despite the low selectivity and stability of catalysts now limited it far from industrial-scale production. Therefore, more efforts should be put on the design and preparation of catalysts as well as revealing the relationship between surface chemical-properties and allyl alcohol production from gas-glycerol. It is found that the glycerol conversion was closely related with surface acid sites but allyl alcohol selectivity was dependent on both acid and redox sites [8,28,33]. Previously, the Nb2O5 with Brøsted acid sites could facilitate the acrolein formation, while VOx with redox sites was active to allyl alcohol formation [26,32,37]. Combining with our former works TiO2 can more significantly improve the catalytic performance of MoFe oxides compared with CeO2. The modified x-KIT-6 (x = V, Nb, Ti) supports were thus designed and prepared to adjusted the surface composition and properties of MoFe/x-KIT-6 oxide catalysts, aiming to further improve the catalytic performance of MoFe-based oxides and reveal the relationship of allyl alcohol be synthesized from gas-glycerol with the surface properties of MoFe-based oxides catalysts. The x-KIT-6 was prepared through in situ hydrothermal technology in terms of the previous literatures [38–40]. The supported MoFe oxide catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, BET, TEM, SEM-EDS, XPS, NH3-TPD and Py-IR, and their catalytic performance was investigated and compared with that of the MoFe/KIT-6. Moreover, different reaction conditions or experiments were designed and carried out to investigate the gas-glycerol conversion reaction pathway."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The x-KIT-6 (x = V, Ti, Nb) with nx/nSi of 5% were prepared by a direct hydrothermal procedure (as the preparation of KIT-6) described in previous studies, using NH4VO3, C10H5NbO20, and C16H36OTi as precursors, respectively [38–40]. In a typical synthesis, 16 g of P123 were dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution (580 g water and 32 g 37 % HCl) at 35 °C. After complete dissolution, 16 g of n-butanol were added and the resulting mixture was stirred for another 1 h at 35 °C. Subsequently, 32.8 g of TEOS and the required amounts of NH4VO3 (C10H5NbO20 or C16H36OTi in ethanol solution) were added to this mixture, and the stirring was continued for another 24 h. Finally, the reaction mixture was transferred to a 1 l Teflon-lined SS autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment for 24 h at 100 °C. The solid product was filtered, washed with water, and then dried at 100 °C overnight. The remnants of the structure-directing agent were removed by calcination in a flow of dry air at 550 °C for 5 h. The final material was denoted as V-KIT-6, Nb-KIT-6, and Ti-KIT-6, respectively. In a typical synthesis of 5 wt % MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts by simple wet impregnation method, a certain amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and Fe(NO3)2·9H2O (nMo/nFe = 0.3; final Mo-Fe oxide loading of 5 wt%) were dissolved in distilled water, followed by adding several drops of HNO3 (67 %). Then, a corresponding amount of V-KIT-6 (Ti-KIT-6 or Nb-KIT6) was added in the solution and stirring for 2 h at room temperature. After staying for 24 h, the solution was spin-flash evaporated at 80 °C until the solvent being completely removed. Through drying overnight, the sample was calcinated at 500 °C for 3 h. Finally, the catalyst was obtained and designated as MoFe/x-KIT-6, in which x means the Ti, V or Nb. The MoFe/KIT-6 was prepared following the same procedure expect for using KIT-6 as the support, described elsewhere [33]."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 XRD characterization X–ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Fangyuan DX-1000 powder X-ray diffractometer (China) with Cu Kα radiation at a tube voltage of 40 kV, and the data of 2θ were collected from 10° to 80° range with 0.02° of the step size at the rate of 5° min−1. Low-angle XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max–2500/PC diffractometer with a rotating anode using Ni filtered Cu–Kα (as radiation source (λ =0.15418 nm) radiation at 40 kV of a tube voltage and 200 mA of a tube current. The data was corrected from 0.5° to 5° with 0.02° increment and recording time of 100 s at each increment. 2.2.2 N2 physisorption Adsorption and desorption isotherms were collected on Autosorb-6 at −196 °C. Prior to the measurement, all samples were degassed at 200 °C until a stable vacuum of ca. 5 m Torr was reached. The speciﬁc surface area was assessed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from adsorption data in a relative pressure range from 0.06 to 0.10. The total pore volume, Vt, was assessed from the adsorbed amount of nitrogen at a relative pressure of 0.99 by converting it to the corresponding volume of liquid adsorbate. 2.2.3 TEM analysis Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope operating with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. For the TEM measurement, the samples were prepared by ultrasonication in ethanol, evaporating a drop of the resultant suspension onto a carbon–coated copper grid. 2.2.4 SEM-EDS analysis The morphology and chemical composition of the activated catalysts (extrudates) were examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM6300) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The chemical composition of the catalysts was determined using natural and synthetic standards and 20 kV accelerating voltage with 10 nA beam current. 2.2.5 XPS analysis The surface chemical states and distribution the Mo/KIT-6, Fe/KIT-6, and MoFe-x/KIT-6 catalysts were certified by the X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The signals were collected by a KRATOS X–ray source with an aluminium crystal, operating at 12 kV anode voltage and 12 mA emission current, was used to generate the required Al Kα radiation. Curve fitting and background subtraction were performed using Casa XPS software. 2.2.6 NH3-TPD studies NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3–TPD) was conducted using a conventional apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. 50 mg of sample was placed in a quartz tube (4.0 mm ID), and pretreated with at 300 °C for 1 h; as the temperature cooled down to 50 °C, NH3 was chemisorbed until equilibrium was reached. After this, the sample was switched to He gas flow (30 ml /min) for 20 min at 50 °C, and then the TPD was performed by heating the sample at 10 °C min–1 from 50 to 600 °C. 2.2.7 Py-IR studies Py-IR spectra were recorded on a TENSOR 27 BRUKER spectrometer. Prior to measurements, the catalysts (15−20 mg) were pretreated in situ at 400 °C for 12 h and then at 300 °C for 1 h under vacuum (5 × 10−2 Pa). Thereafter, the sample was cooled to 150 °C and saturated with pyridine vapors for 20 min. The degassing was carried out under vacuum pressure of 5 × 10−2 Pa for 1 h, and the spectra recording was carried in the range of 1000-4000 cm-1."
4,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic tests of all catalysts were carried out in a continuous flow fixed–bed quartz tubular reactor (i.d. 8 mm) under atmospheric pressure. The quartz tube reactor containing 200 mg of catalysts mixed with 200 mg of quartz (both sieved, 380−700 μm) was placed inside a tubular furnace. The carrier gas (N2) was passed downward through the reactor containing the catalyst bed, while electronic mass flow controller (D07–7A/ZM, China) was used to control the flow rate at 10 mL·min–1 (in some cases, 10 % H2 in N2 gas flow). After the temperature of the reactor had reached 340 °C, a 35 wt% glycerol aqueous solution (in one case, 20 % formic acid was introduced) was pumped in at a flow rate of 1 mL h−1 using a syringe pump (LSP01-1A, china). The products were cooled through an ice-water trap and collected in every two hours, and the obtained product selectivity or yield showed the average of each 2 h. The collected liquid samples were analyzed with a HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-INNOWAX (19091N-113, 30m*0.32mm*0.25 mm) and an FID detector. 1,2-pprpandiol was selected as the internal standard for the quantification of glycerol and products. In addition, all samples were also checked without standard and no 1,2-propandiol was detected in all cases. The glycerol conversion (CGLY ) and product selectivity (Si ,) was calculated from the molar concentrations of product and glycerol according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The yield of allyl alcohol was equal to C G L Y × S a l l y l a l c h o l . (1) C G L Y % = M G L Y , i n - M G L Y , o u t M G L Y , i n × 100 (2) S i ( % ) = M i M G L Y , i n - M G L Y , o u t × Z i 3 × 100 Where Z represents the number of carbon atoms, for example, Zi = 3 for C3 products such as allyl alchol and Zi = 2 for acetaldehyde. The MGLY,in and MGLY,out represent the molar quantity of glycerol in and out of the reactor, respectively. Mi represents the detected molar quantity of product [41]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,N2 physisorption characterization,"3.1 N2 physisorption characterization The textural parameters of the prepared MoFe-based supported oxide catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption-desorption characterization. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore diameter distributions are shown in Fig. 1 , and the corresponding textural data are summarized in Table 1 . From Fig. 1a, the MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 and MoFe/V-KIT-6 are similar with the MoFe/KIT-6 that showed a type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis based on the IUPAC classification and a steep capillary condensation step between P/P0 = 0.6−0.8, which were characteristic of well-ordered three-dimensional mesoporous silica materials possessing large channel‐like pores with a narrow range of size [42]. This phenomenon demonstrated that MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 have similar well-ordered developed mesoporous structure as KIT-6, and the in situ modification of Nb or V in KIT-6 effectively remained the original well-ordered three-dimensional mesoporous structure of the KIT-6, targeting the original structure design of catalysts [33]. However, for the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 catalyst, the N2 isotherm adsorption line did not show a sharp jump in the p/p0 = 0.6∼0.75 region without particularly obvious hysteresis loop, ie, MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 exhibited significant deterioration or collapse of the mesoporous structure, revealing the doping of Ti into KIT-6 significantly changed the mesoporous structure of KIT-6 based on the current preparation procedure. The reason can be attributed to the different hydrolysis rate of tetrabutyl-titanate and ethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) affecting the crosslinking of them with the P123 (PEO-PPO-PEO) [38,39]. As shown in Fig. 1b, the pore sizes of MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/KIT-6 catalysts were narrowly distributed between 4.5 and 8.5 nm, most of which were around 5.9-7.0 nm. Moreover, the MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 have mesopores with slightly larger pore sizes comparing with MoFe/KIT-6. The average pore diameter d0 (Table 1) for MoFe/KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 catalysts was 5.98, 6.95 and 6.85 nm, respectively. Differently, the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 showed a weak peak pore size distribution curve between 3.0 and 4.5 nm with average aperture d0 of 2.65 nm. As shown in Table 1, the modified x-KIT-6 supports provided the corresponding specific surface areas of MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6, and MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 reached 567.1 m2/g, 520.8 m2/g, and 519.2 m2/g, respectively. The Vt of MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 reached above 0.7 cm3/g, much higher than that of 0.345 cm3/g for MoFe/Ti-KIT-6. These results showed MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 oxide catalysts hold developed mesoporous structure with high S BET and Vt. But, the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 showed undeveloped mesoporous structure with relatively lower Vt (also having high S BET), which was attributed to the structure of Ti-KIT-6 but not the blockage of MoFe oxides in the pore channels."
7,Low-angle XRD and TEM characterization,"3.2 Low-angle XRD and TEM characterization To further revealed the difference on the porous structure of MoFe/Ti-KIT-6, Fig. 2a and 2b presented the low-angle XRD patterns and TEM characterization images of the KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2a, two intense low-angel XRD peaks located at 0.97° and 1.10° can be observed on MoFe/V-KIT-6, which were indexed to (211) and (200) reflections of highly ordered three-dimension (3D) cubic symmetry (Ia3d) of KIT-6. However, no reflections located at 0.97° and 1.10° were presented in the low-angle XRD pattern of MoFe/Ti-KIT-6. TEM images in Fig. 2b also displayed that a great number of ordered mesopores occupied the particle of MoFe/V-KIT-6, but MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 held developed disordered porous structure (containing meso-pores and micropores). Therefore, the low-angle XRD and TEM results confirmed that MoFe/V-KIT-6 has successfully obtained the ordered Ia3d bicontinuous cubic mesoporous structure as the KIT-6 or KIT-6-supported catalysts [33,39]. The MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 still had developed porous structure though the ordered Ia3d bicontinuous cubic mesoporous structure was damaged, which provided the catalysts with high specific surface area as the BET results showed. On the other hand, it is clear that MoFe oxides were well dispersed on the surface of the V-KIT-6 and Ti-KIT-6 supports, without obviously aggregated particles forming and occupying the pore channels. The high specific surface area and developed porous structure of x-KIT-6 enhanced the dispersion of Mo and Fe oxides, which is the target on supported catalysts to reduce economic cost and improve the catalytic performance of catalysts [33]. The TEM results also revealed the destruction on the ordered mesoporous framework of MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 actually came from the Ti-KIT-6 but not the MoFe oxides."
8,XRD characterization,"3.3 XRD characterization Fig. 3 presents the wide-angle XRD patterns of the KIT-6, FeMo/KIT-6 and FeMo/x-KIT-6 catalysts. It can be observed from the XRD patterns that a weak and broad XRD peak centered at 2θ =22.4° for all the samples, which is assigned to the SiO2 with porous structure [33,36–39]. However, no diffraction peaks, corresponding to FeOx, MoOx or Fe2(MoO4)3 crystalline phases, appeared in the XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts at the 10° to 80° range [43–45]. This phenomenon indicated that FeOx, MoOx or MoFeOx may exist in amorphous state or have good dispersion (or crystallite size smaller than the XRD testing limits) on the x-KIT-6 supports, which was benefit from the high specific surface area and developed mesoporous structure of KIT-6 and x-KIT-6 (as confirmed by BET results in Fig. 1) and low metal oxide loading of 5 wt% [33]. For MoFe/Ti-KIT-6, an additional weak XRD peak assigned to TiO2 was observed, indicating isolated crystalline TiO2 formed on the surface of catalysts [45,46]. Combining with the BET, low-angle XRD and TEM results that Ti-KIT-6 did not have the original Ia3d cubic mesoporous structure, this can indicate that Ti may not be completely doping into SiO2 [38,40,46]. Therefore, the XRD results indicated that The MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts may have different surface chemical composition and distribution of Mo-Fe oxides with the MoFe/KIT-6, as the doping of V, Nb, Ti in KIT-6 changed the chemical environment of x-KIT-6"
9,SEM-EDS and XPS characterization,"3.4 SEM-EDS and XPS characterization The distribution of Mo-Fe oxides and surface chemical composition of MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts were characterized by the SEM-EDS and XPS technologies, and the images and data were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the SEM images of the samples revealed irregular particles that relating with the porous channels of KIT-6 containing materials (the BET and TEM confirmed), and the particles process the sizes above 10 μm or 1−5 μm. It was observed that the in-situ modification of V, Nb and Ti on KIT-6 has obvious influence on the morphology of the final MoFe/V-KIT-6, MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 oxide catalysts in comparison with the MoFe/KIT-6 [39,40,46]. Based on the Fe and Mo element mapping, the Fe and Mo oxides were uniformly dispersed on the surface of MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 samples, except for aggregated Mo oxide particles forming on the surface of MoFe/Ti-KIT-6. This further confirmed the developed ordered mesoporous structure was superior to the disordered mesopores or micropores for the dispersion of the loading Mo and Fe oxides. In addition, the EDS analysis (Table 2 ) showed the surface nMo/nFe of MoFe/KIT-6, MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6, and MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 were 0.43, 0.87, 1.80, and 2.13, respectively, which is higher than the preparation nMo/nFe dosage of 0.3, revealing the incorporation of Nb, V, and Ti into KIT-6 obviously enriched the surface Mo oxides. This phenomenon may result from the modified x-KIT-6 prefer to anchor the Fe2+ positive ions rather than adsorbing Mo7O24 6− anions during the impregnation process, due to the existence of polar NbO, Ti-O and VO bonds trending to adsorbing the positive Fe2+ ions [44,47]. At the same time, the XPS (Table 2) results revealed Mo and Fe species of the prepared catalysts were all high-chemical-value Mo6+ and Fe3+, respectively [33,47]. That is, the surface composition of the MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 are mainly MoO3-Fe2O3. The surface nMo/nFe of MoFe/KIT-6, MoFe/V-KIT-6, MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, and MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 catalysts was 0.40, 0.37, 0.31, and 0.46 respectively, also confirming the enrichment of surface Mo species in accordance with the EDS analysis. A slight difference can be attributed to the weak XPS signal being interfered because of the low mass loading of MoFe oxides. Moreover, Ti, V, and Nb have been detected on the surface of corresponding MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts, and the low contents resulted from the cover of Mo and/or Fe oxides. The phenomenon surely told the modification of V, Nb, and Ti on KIT-6 obviously affected the surface composition and distribution of MoO3-Fe2O3 on x-KIT-6 comparing with KIT-6, and adjusted the interaction between the loading MoO3-Fe2O3 and x-KIT-6 support, which may hold influence on the surface physic-chemical property (such as the acidic strength and acid site contents) of MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts."
10,NH3-TPD and Py-IR analysis,"3.5 NH3-TPD and Py-IR analysis NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments on the prepared MoFe/x-KIT-6 and MoFe/KIT-6 oxide catalysts were carried out to investigate the amounts and strength of surface acid sites of catalysts. The results were shown in Fig. 5a, in which, the NH3-TPD curves of the studied samples deviate from the baseline (as shown by the arrow) at about 80 °C. A prominent NH3-TPD peak formed at about 129 °C for MoFe/KIT-6. For MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts, the NH3-TPD curves formed multiple-peaks with increased peak intensity and area in the range of 100−200 °C, and the peaks shifted to higher temperatures comparing with MoFe/KIT-6. Moreover, it should be stated that no NH3-TPD peaks were observed above the temperature of 300 °C during the progress of the NH3-TPD experiments on all the samples, which indicated the surface of the MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts only hold moderate acidic property [25,26]. According to the XRD, EDS and XPS results, the surface acidic sites on the MoFe/x-KIT-6 oxide catalysts were mainly provided by the MoO3 and Fe2O3 oxides, but surface exposing Nb2O5 can also provide additional acidic sites on MoFe/Nb-KIT-6. For all this, in comparison with the MoFe/KIT-6, the Nb, Ti and V modified KIT-6 slightly improved the surface acid strength of MoFe/x-KIT-6 especially for MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, as the NH3-TPD peaks shifted to higher temperatures. This may be closely related to the prominent enrichment of Mo species on the surface of the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 catalysts as the SEM-EDS results revealed, because the MoO3 naturally have stronger acidity than the Fe2O3 [33]. At the same time, in Table 1, the surface acid site density of catalysts has been calculated according to the corresponding NH3-TPD peak area and SBET. The prepared catalysts, in terms of the surface acid density from high to low, can be ranks as MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 (0.564 μmol/m2) > MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 (0.492 μmol/m2) > MoFe/ KIT-6 (0.478 μmol/m2) > MoFe/V-KIT-6 (0.453 μmol/m2). The result suggested the Nb and Ti modified KIT-6 obviously improved the amount of surface acid sites of the MoFe-based supported oxide catalysts, but the V modified KIT-6 showed a negative effect. On one hand, it can be attributed to the Nb2O5 and TiO2 naturally can provide additional moderate acid sites (the XPS results confirmed the exposure of Nb and Ti element), but VOx generally exhibit oxidability without prominent acid property [32,34,37]. On the other hand, it may also relate with the different surface Mo-Fe composition and distribution of MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts, and demonstrate the different interaction between MoFe oxides and the x-KIT-6 as well as the different synergistic effect of MoO3 with Fe2O3 [30,33,37]. Accordingly, the NH3-TPD results showed Nb, Ti, and V modifying obviously changed the amount and strength of the surface acid sites of MoFe/x-KIT-6, which may lead to different catalytic activities of MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts for the gas-glycerol catalytic conversion into high-value chemicals, because of the dehydration of glycerol and coke formation was closely related to the surface acid sites [30,37]. Fig. 5b shows Py-IR spectra of the prepared MoFe-based oxide catalysts, in which, several IR bands can be observed at about 1445.5, 1488.2, 1577.1, and 1594.7 cm−1, respectively. According to the literature, the bands at 1577.1 and 1594.7 cm−1 are associated to the deformation vibration absorption of the Pyridine molecule inner ring [48,49]. The appearance of prominent bands at 1445.5 cm−1 were characteristic of pyridine adsorbed on the lewis acid sites (PyL), and the much weaker bands at 1488.2 cm−1 were attributed to the pyridine adsorbed on both lewis and Brøsted acid sites [36,48,49]. These results indicate the MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts mainly hold surface Lewis acidity, by taking account of the absence of the IR band at about 1545 cm−1 attributed to the pyridine adsorbed on Brøsted acid sites [36]. The modification of V Nb or Ti on KIT-6 did not change the surface acidity of MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts, but obviously affected the surface acid contents of catalysts as the IR peaks prominently different for the MoFe-based oxide catalysts."
11,Catalytic performance,"3.6 Catalytic performance Fig. 6 showed the catalytic activity of the MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 oxide catalysts for gas-glycerol conversion to high-value chemicals under a certain condition. As can be seen from Fig. 6a and b, all the catalysts showed high activity for gas-glycerol catalytic conversion with the allyl alcohol, acrolein and acetaldehyde as the main products. The conversion of glycerol over the MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 catalyst reached 95.6 %, showing selectivity for allyl alcohol, acrolein and acetaldehyde of 17.7 %, 10.2 %, and 8.1 %, respectively. MoFe/V-KIT-6 catalyst showed 92.1 % conversion to glycerol, and corresponding selectivity of allyl alcohol, acrolein and acetaldehyde was 31.4 %, 17.0 % and 14.4 %, respectively. As for MoFe/Ti-KIT-6, the conversion of glycerol was 83.5 %, and the selectivity of allyl alcohol, acrolein and acetaldehyde was 14.4 %, 16.8 % and 23.9 %, respectively. Comparing with the MoFe/KIT-6, the doping of Nb improved the glycerol conversion but significantly reduced the selectivity of target products. The V modified KIT-6 obviously improved the selectivity of allyl alcohol, acrolein and acetaldehyde, with total yield of the three reached 58.5 %. The allyl alcohol selectivity and main products yield are both higher than that over MoFe/KIT-6. Interestingly, the doping of Ti obviously reduced the gas-glycerol catalytic conversion and allyl alcohol selectivity, but prominently improved the acetaldehyde selectivity with the yield reaching 20 % which is twice of that over the MoFe/KIT-6. And the total yield of allyl alcohol, acrolein, and acetaldehyde also reached above 45 %, only slightly lower than that over the MoFe/KIT-6. The catalysts, according to the glycerol conversion, can be ranked as MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 > MoFe/KIT-6 > MoFe/V-KIT-6 > MoFe/Ti-KIT-6. It is known that the gas-glycerol conversion has positive relationship with the surface acid site density of catalysts [33,34]. Combining with NH3-TPD and Py-IR analysis, the catalytic test results are in a good accordance with the previous studies except for the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6, which can be attributed to the undeveloped mesoporous structure with low V T and d 0 [31–34]. But in terms of the allyl alcohol selectivity and the yield of main products (allyl alcohol, acrolein, and acetaldehyde), the MoFe-based oxide catalysts can be ranked as MoFe/V-KIT-6 > MoFe/KIT-6 > MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 > MoFe/Nb-KIT-6. Our previous study confirmed KIT-6 has a small amount of lewis acid sites for gas-glycerol conversion, and only acrolein and acetol were detected. At the same time, allyl alcohol with selectivity about 4.2 % was obtained over the V-KIT-6 (in Table 3 ), and which was not produced from gas-glycerol conversion over Nb- or Ti- oxides [9,36]. Therefore, the MoO3-Fe2O3 is the active species for gas-glycerol direct conversion to allyl alcohol without extra hydrogen donors. It can be observed that the V modified KIT-6 obviously improved the catalytic performance of MoFe/KIT-6 for gas-glycerol conversion to allyl alcohol, but negative effect happened on Nb or Ti modification. Based on the characterization results, the improved catalytic performance of MoFe/V-KIT-6 can be attributed to the interaction between the V-KIT-6 and MoFe oxides by adjusting the surface Mo-Fe composition and reducing the surface acid density, as well as providing the developed ordered mesoporous structure with high SBET and Vt. Our previous study has revealed that MoOx has high catalytic performance for gas-glycerol conversion to allyl alcohol, and which can be promoted by synthetic effect of MoO3-Fe2O3 at a proper nMo/nFe molar ratio [33]. So, the much higher surface nMo/nFe and badly damaging on the ordered developed mesoporous structure of the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 resulted in the significantly reduced allyl alcohol selectivity. Interestingly, the increased acetaldehyde production from gas-glycerol may be benefit from the structure and/or Ti4+ active centers. Though kept the developed mesoporous structure with high S BET and V T, the high surface density and strength of the acid sites and the additional Nb2O5 (0.09 mol% from XPS) with natural acid property were the factors for the low allyl alcohol selectivity and main products carbon balance of the MoFe/Nb-KIT-6, because acid sites with high strength (and/ or Nb2O5) facilitated dehydration of glycerol and coke formation [37]. Accordingly, V modification on KIT-6 was good for MoFe/V-KIT-6 showing high catalytic activity for gas-glycerol direct conversion to allyl alcohol without extra hydrogen donors and reached high carbon balance of other high-value chemicals (such as acrolein, acetaldehyde). For different products obtained from gas-glycerol over the MoFe-based oxide catalysts, the pathway especially for allyl alcohol formation is very interesting and meaningful. It is generally accepted that the acrolein and acetol can be obtained from direct 1–2 dehydration of glycerol, which started with the activation of central 2OH group via 1–3-dihydroxypropene and terminal OH group via 2−3-dihydroxypropene, respectively, over the moderate Lewis-acid sites of MoFe/x-KIT-6 oxide catalysts (the NH3-TPD and Py-IR results confirmed) [36,50,51]. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde can be co-produced from CC cleavage of acetol, but also can be produced from 1 to 3 dehydration of glycerol via vinyl alcohol [51,52]. However, the formaldehyde can easily be thermally decomposed to H2 and CO, which thus was usually undetected except acetaldehyde in the final products [53,54]. It should be pointed out that all these three pathways (1–2 and 1–3 dehydration) are most probably happening simultaneously, since the quite close activation energies (without catalysts, 65.2 ∼ 70.9 kJ/mol) [51]. So, a certain amount of acrolein, acetaldehyde, and acetol obtained from gas-glycerol over the MoFe/KIT-6 and MoFe/x-KIT-6 catalysts can be attributed to abundant moderate acid sites on the surface. The high acetaldehyde selectivity over MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 may demonstrated that the Ti modified Ti-KIT-6 facilitates the CC cleavage of unstable immediate products or acetol from glycerol. The products of propanal and acetone has previously confirmed being produced from the further catalytic conversion of acetol, which also was one factor for low selectivity of acetol over the MoFe-based oxide catalysts [53–55]. In comparison with these compounds, the reaction pathway for the allyl alcohol production from gas-glycerol without any extra hydrogen donors seems more difficult to be explained. The previous studies stated that allyl alcohol were produced through dehydration of glycerol to acrolein and consecutive hydrogen transfer, and the non-acid active centers (basic or redox sites) are considered to quite important for allyl alcohol formation [8,29–33,36]. However, the hydrogen donor is controversial, such as reactant-glycerol, product-acetol, intermediate-alcohols, and H2 from decomposition of formaldehyde [18,29]. To further study, different experiments were designed and the results are shown in Table 3. When formic was introduced in gas-glycerol conversion over MoFe/V-KIT-6, the allyl alcohol selectivity did not obviously increase, but glycerol conversion and selectivity of acrolein, acetol and acetaldehyde are decreased. As H2 was introduced, conversion of glycerol and selectivity of the products allyl alcohol, acrolein, acetol and acetaldehyde all obviously reduced. These experiments showed that extra H2 or H2 produced from intermediates decomposition is not helpful to allyl alcohol synthesis from gas-glycerol conversion over the MoFe/V-KIT-6. Based on MoFe/V-KIT-6, the 0.1 wt%Pt/MoFe/V-KITt-6 was prepared for gas-glycerol catalytic conversion with extra H2 introduced. The results present that the glycerol conversion and main products selectivity both obviously reduced. Catalytic hydrogenation performance of Pt did not work to improve gas-glycerol converting to allyl alcohol over MoFeOx-based catalysts. It can be deduced that the hydrogen donors could not be the H2 but the glycerol or intermediates [56]. Moreover, methanol, being detected in the final products over the MoO3-Fe2O3 based catalysts (in Fig. 6a), was reported can be produced over redox sites through one-step process from glycerol, and the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds to forming hydrogen radical is one of the key steps [55]. The hydrogen donors may be the hydrogen radical from the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds of glycerol. The results in Table 3 that allyl alcohol (about 4.2 %) being produced over V-KIT-6 with low selectivity of acerolein, demonstrated allyl alcohol from glycerol was closely related with both moderate acidic and redox sites of VOx, as previously claimed [26,32]. Therefore, allyl alcohol was most probably synthesized through dehydration of glycerol to an intermediate and consecutive reduction over the acidic and redox sites of MoFe/V-KIT-6 (as the scheme 1 deduced combining with the previous studies), and the modification of V on KIT-6 adjusting the surface Mo-Fe composition and reducing the surface acid density is quit important [29–33,51–56]."
12,Catalytic stability,"3.7 Catalytic stability The catalytic stability of MoFe/V-KIT-6 catalyst for gas-glycerol catalytic conversion to high-value chemicals was investigated under the same reaction conditions. The relationship between glycerol conversion & main product selectivities and reaction time was shown in Fig. 7. The catalytic conversion of glycerol on the MoFe/V-KIT-6 catalyst remained above 85 % during the first 8 h in the reaction, and only decreased with about 4.1 % from the initial two-hour ratio. During the reaction time period at 8-12 h, the glycerol conversion rate was kept around 80 %, which was 10.2 % lower than the initial 2 h; while the selectivity of the main products of allyl alcohol, acrolein, acetaldehyde and hydroxyacetone kept the same changing trend. The results suggested that the MoFe/V-KIT-6 catalyst exhibited relatively catalytic stability at the first 8 h reaction, and the catalytic activity began to decrease after 8-12 h. After reaction for 24 h, the glycerol conversion and allyl alcohol selectivity reduced to about 70 % and 20 %, respectively, showing obvious deactivation. However, the catalytic stability of MoFe/V-KIT-6 was significantly improved in contrast with previously reported MoFe/KIT-6 and γ-alumina/Fe and K /ZrO2-FeOx catalysts [29–31,33]. The enhanced catalytic stability of MoFe/V-KIT-6 may benefit from that the V modification on KIT-6 well kept the original developed ordered mesoporous structure and improved the interaction between the MoFe oxides and V-KIT-6 by adjusted surface Mo6+/Fe3+ molar ratio and reducing the surface Lewis acid density. Three regeneration circles of experiments were carried out on the MoFe/V-KIT-6 through online calcination at 500 °C for 3 h after reaction for 24 h, and the results are presented in Table 4 . The results in Fig. 7 showed the catalytic performance of MoFe/V-KIT-6 decreased after reaction for 24 h, which was well recovered after regeneration. In another words, for the first regeneration circle (Re.1a), the glycerol conversion and main products (allyl alcohol, acrolein, and acetaldehyde) selectivity over the MoFe/V-KIT-6 did not prominently decrease in comparison with that over the fresh catalysts (Re.1). However, the regeneration performance of MoFe/V-KIT-6 gradually decreased for the second and third regeneration circles (Re. 2b and Re.1c), as the glycerol conversion and allyl alcohol selectivity gradually decreased and the selectivity of other products was significantly increased (from 29.4%–42.5%). These investigation results reveal that the deactivation of MoFe/V-KIT-6 mainly resulted from carbon-deposits, because the allyl alcohol and acrolein can further self-polymerize or polymerize with acetol, glycerol, and acetone over the acid sites of MoFe/V-KIT-6. On the other hand, the decrease on regeneration performance of MoFe/V-KIT-6 indicated that the initial surface composition or stability of active components of MoFe/V-KIT-6 was destroyed, which need be further studied."
13,Conclusions,"V, Nb, or Ti oxides modified KIT-6 (x-KIT-6) and MoFe/x-KIT-6 oxide catalysts were successfully synthesized through the in-situ hydrothermal and wet impregnation methods, respectively. The MoFe/V-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 kept the original developed ordered mesoporous structure as KIT-6, but the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 showed undeveloped and disordered porous structure with lower V t and d 0. The Fe and Mo oxides (mainly are Fe2O3 and MoO3) were well dispersed on KIT-6 and x-KIT-6, while the x-KIT-6 supports showed different synergistic effect with the MoFe oxides by adjusting the surface Mo6+/Fe3+ composition and surface moderate Lewis acid density of MoFe/x-KIT-6 in comparison with the MoFe/KIT-6. These factors resulted in that the MoFe/V-KIT-6 catalyst showed obviously improved catalytic activity for gas-glycerol conversion to allyl alcohol comparing with the MoFe/KIT-6, but negative effect occurred on the MoFe/Ti-KIT-6 and MoFe/Nb-KIT-6 catalysts. Over the MoFe/V-KIT-6 oxide catalyst, the gas-glycerol catalytic conversion and allyl alcohol selectivity reached 92.1 % and 31.4 %, respectively, and the total selectivity of ally alcohol, acrolein, acetaldehyde and acetol reached 69.5%. The MoFe/V-KIT-6 also showed improved catalytic stability and good regeneration performance. It is benefit from the proper surface Mo/Fe molar ratio, reduced surface moderate acid density and developed ordered mesoporous structure of the MoFe/V-KIT-6. Extra H2 or H2 produced from intermediates decomposition is not helpful for allyl alcohol being synthesized from gas-glycerol over the MoFe/V-KIT-6 oxide catalyst."
