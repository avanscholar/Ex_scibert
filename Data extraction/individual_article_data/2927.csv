0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is currently more expensive than traditional energy sources, so it is likely to play a major role in the economy in the long run, if technology improvements succeed in bringing down costs [1–4]. Biological hydrogen production processes are found to be more environment friendly and less energy intensive as compared to thermochemical and electrochemical processes [5–7]. Biological hydrogen production requires a waste and by-product strategy to compete with other production technologies of hydrogen gas. A way to reduce the cost of biological hydrogen production is through improving the practical bacterial hydrogen productivity from organic wastes [8–14]. Another way is to make use of its waste products in other biotechnological applications. One possibility is to make use of the waste bacterial biomass in heavy metals biosorption technology for wastewater treatment. The biosorption of heavy metals by certain types of microorganisms’ biomass is a highly cost-effective technology for the decontamination of metal-containing effluents [15]. Both living and non-living microorganisms biomass have been used in biosorption of toxic metal ions [16–21]. The use of heterotrophic bacteria for biosorption of heavy metals [22–24] is rather expensive in comparison to green algae and cyanobacteria [25–27] which grow autotrophically. Using the waste bacterial biomass of hydrogen production in heavy metals biosorption would make the biosorption technology of heavy metals by heterotrophic bacteria inexpensive and duplicates the benefits of biological hydrogen production technology. Hydrogen production by Escherichia coli is mediated by the formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex [28–34]. The mutant E. coli HD701 constructed previously [35] cannot synthesize the (Hyc A) repressor of the FHL complex. Consequently, this mutant has an up-regulated FHL system and can, therefore, evolve hydrogen at a greater rate than its parental wild type, E. coli MC4100 [36]. The main objectives of this work were to investigate the hydrogen production from acid hydrolyzed molasses by the hydrogen overproducing E. coli HD701 and to examine the biosorption efficiency of the waste E. coli biomass for Cd2+ and Zn2+."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture conditions for E. coli,"2.1 Culture conditions for E. coli E. coli was maintained aerobically at 30 °C on nutrient agar [containing (g L−1): peptone, 5; beef extract, 5; NaCl, 3; agar, 15]. Prior to hydrogen production, E. coli was grown aerobically overnight on nutrient broth [containing (g L−1): peptone, 5; beef extract, 5; NaCl, 3] with shaking (100 rpm) at 30 °C."
3,Acid hydrolysis of molasses,"2.2 Acid hydrolysis of molasses Several preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize the conditions of acid hydrolysis of molasses. The optimum conditions used for acid hydrolysis of molasses were as fellow: Molasses was diluted two times by distilled water and adjusted to 2 M HCl. Subsequently, the acid hydrolysis was conducted at 120 °C for 20 min."
4,Determination of reducing sugars concentration,"2.3 Determination of reducing sugars concentration Samples of acid hydrolyzed molasses were neutralized by 1 M NaOH. Subsequently, the reducing sugars concentration was determined by Nelson reagent [37]."
5,Hydrogen production from acid hydrolyzed molasses by E. coli,"2.4 Hydrogen production from acid hydrolyzed molasses by E. coli Batch experiments for hydrogen production by E. coli were conducted as described by Penfold et al. [36] with modifications using the reducing sugars of acid hydrolyzed molasses as a carbon source. The experiments were conducted at 30 °C in 1 L fermentor with a working volume of 970 ml. The fermentor contained 80% (v/v) of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and 10% (v/v) of acid hydrolyzed molasses (previously neutralized to pH 7.3 by 1 M NaOH) in a final concentration of 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 (g/L) reducing sugars. After autoclaving, 10% (v/v) inoculum of E. coli cells, pre-grown in nutrient broth (OD600 equal 0.25), was added. The fermentor was fitted with rubber stopper and purged with N2 gas for 1 h to ensure an anaerobic environment. Fermentation temperature was controlled at 30 °C in a water bath. The fermentor was set in dark and the evolved H2 gas was collected and measured by displacement of 1 M NaOH in an inverted cylinder. NaOH was used to absorb CO2 [36]. All gas volumes are reported at 1 atm and 25 °C."
6,Preparation of the waste E. coli biomass for biosorption,"2.5 Preparation of the waste E. coli biomass for biosorption Subsequent to the hydrogen production experiments, cells of E. coli in the spent medium of the fermentor were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The biomass pellets of E. coli were washed three times with distilled water. The washed biomass was freeze-dried and stored at −80 °C for subsequent heavy metals biosorption experiments."
7,Metal solution for biosorption,"2.6 Metal solution for biosorption Stock solutions of Cd2+ and Zn2+ (1000 mg/L) were prepared by dissolving 1.63, and 4.39 g of CdCl2 and ZnSO4·7H2O, respectively in a 1000 ml of distilled water."
8,Biosorption experiments,"2.7 Biosorption experiments Biosorption experiments were conducted at pH 6. The freeze-dried E. coli waste biomass (20 mg) was suspended in 20 ml of Cd2+ and Zn2+ solutions at various initial concentrations (Ci ) ranging from 0 to 300 mg L−1. Shaking was conducted at 200 rpm for 25 min till equilibrium attained at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). Subsequent to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min, the heavy metal equilibrium (final) concentration (Ce ) in the supernatant was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (Model 210 VGP Buck Scientific). The quantity of metal ion (mg) biosorbed per gram (dry weight) of E. coli biomass was calculated using the following equation: (1) q ( mg / g ) e = [ C − i C e M ] ∗ V where, qe = equilibrium (final) quantity of metal ions biosorbed (mg metal ions/g bacterial biomass); Ci = initial metal ions concentration (mg/L); Ce = equilibrium (final) metal ion concentration (mg/L); M = dry weight of E. coli biomass (g); V = the volume of metal ions solution (L)."
9,Biosorption isotherms,"2.8 Biosorption isotherms Several isotherm models are available to describe equilibrium distribution of metal ions between the aqueous and solid phases. The two most common types for describing biosorption isotherms are the Langmuir and Freundlich models [16,17,38,39]. 2.8.1 Langmuir isotherm model The mathematical formula of Langmuir equation can be expressed as: (2) q e = q max b C e 1 + b C e The linear form of the equation is: (3) C e / q e = 1 / q max b + C e / q max where, q max (mg/g) is the maximum biosorption capacity of the metal ions (mg) per unit weight (g) of bacterial biomass to make monolayer coverage by the metal ions on the bacterial surface. The Langmuir constant b (L/mg) represents the affinity between biosorbent and biosorbate. The maximum biosorption capacity q max, and b can be determined from the linear form of Langmuir equation Eq. (3) by plotting Ce /qe versus Ce . The plot of Ce /qe versus Ce gives a straight line. The slope equals 1/q max while intercept equals 1/(q max b). 2.8.2 Freundlich isotherm model The general form of the Freundlich isotherm equation is: (4) q e = K f C e 1 / n The linear form of the equation is: (5) ln q e = ln K f + 1 / n ln C e where, Kf and n are the biosorption capacity and intensity, respectively. If the value of n is greater than unity, this is an indication of a favorable adsorption. A plot of ln qe versus ln Ce gives a straight line. The slope equals 1/n while the intercept equals ln Kf ."
10,Biosorption rate kinetics,"2.9 Biosorption rate kinetics Experiments for determining the kinetics of the biosorption process were performed at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). The freeze-dried E. coli waste biomass (100 mg) was suspended in 100 ml of 50 mg L−1 Cd2+ or Zn2+ solutions (pH 6) with shaking at 200 rpm. Aliquots (2 ml) of metal solution were taken at desired time intervals and were immediately centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 5 min. Subsequently, the heavy metal concentration in the supernatant was measured by AAS. The changes in Cd2+ and Zn2+ biosorption (mg/g) with time were determined and the data were analyzed using pseudo first-order Lagergren and pseudo second-order kinetic models. 2.9.1 The pseudo first-order model The first-order rate equation [40] is one of the most widely used for the sorption of solute from a liquid solution. The pseudo first-order Lagergren model is generally expressed as: (6) ⅆ q t ⅆ t = K 1 ( q e − q t ) where qt is the amount of metal ions biosorbed (mg/g) at any given time t (min), qe is the amount of metal ion biosorbed (mg/g) at equilibrium and K 1 is the Lagergren rate constant of pseudo first-order biosorption (min−1). Integrating Eq. (6) between the limits, t = 0 to t = t and qt = 0 to qt = qe , it becomes (7) log ( q e − q t ) = log q e − K 1 2.303 t The plot of log (qe − qt ) vs. t should give a linear relationship from which k 1 and qe can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot, respectively. 2.9.2 The pseudo second-order model The pseudo second-order model [40] can be expressed as: (8) ⅆ q t ⅆ t = K 2 ( q e − q t ) 2 where qt is the amount of metal ions biosorbed by freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass (mg/g) at any given time t (min), qe is the amount of metal ion biosorbed (mg/g) at equilibrium and k 2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second-order biosorption (g mg−1 min−1). For the boundary conditions t = 0 to t = t and qt = 0 to qt = qe , the integrated form of Eq. (8) (9) t q t = 1 k 2 q e 2 + 1 q e t The plot of (t/qt ) vs. t of Eq. (9) should give a linear relationship from which qe and k 2 can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot, respectively."
11,Comparison between waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production and aerobically grown E. coli for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+,"2.10 Comparison between waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production and aerobically grown E. coli for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ Biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by freeze-dried biomass of aerobically grown E. coli in nutrient broth were also investigated for comparison with the biosorption capacity of the waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production. E. coli HD701 was grown aerobically on nutrient broth as described above. Subsequently, E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The biomass pellets of E. coli were washed three times with distilled water. The washed biomass was freeze-dried and stored at −80 °C for subsequent heavy metals biosorption experiments. Biosorption experiments were conducted at pH 6. The freeze-dried biomass of aerobically grown E. coli (20 mg) was suspended in 20 ml of Cd2+ and Zn2+ solutions at various initial concentrations (Ci ) ranging from 0 to 300 mg L−1. Shaking was conducted at 200 rpm for 25 min till equilibrium attained at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). Subsequent to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min, the heavy metal equilibrium concentration (Ce ) in the supernatant was measured by AAS. The data were analyzed as described above."
12,Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis,2.11 Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis The freeze-dried cells of aerobically grown E. coli and the freeze-dried waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production from acid hydrolyzed molasses (metal free biomass) as will as the waste E. coli biomasses after biosorption of Cd2+ or Zn2+ (metal ions loaded) were analyzed using an Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer (Model: Nicolet 6700; Thermo-Electron Corporation). The FTIR analysis was performed to give a qualitative characterization of the main chemical groups present on the cell wall that are responsible for heavy metal biosorption.
13,Results and discussion,
14,Hydrogen production by E. coli from acid hydrolyzed molasses,"3.1 Hydrogen production by E. coli from acid hydrolyzed molasses Dark fermentation batch experiments were conducted for hydrogen production by E. coli using the reducing sugars of the acid hydrolyzed molasses as a carbon source. Hydrolysis of molasses was substantial for hydrogen production by E. coli. The major component of molasses was sucrose (data not shown). However, E. coli cannot normally utilize sucrose [36,41]. Thus, it could not produce hydrogen from non-hydrolyzed molasses. E. coli HD701 was previously reported to produce only H2 and CO2 [36]. Hydrogen evolution began after two hours from the fermentation start time and continued for a period of 30 h followed by a plateau in the hydrogen evolution pattern (Fig. 1 ). The highest cumulative hydrogen (570 ml H2 L−1) (Fig. 1) and formation rate (19 ml H2 h−1 L−1) (Fig. 2 ) were obtained from 10 g L−1 reducing sugars. However, the highest yield (132 ml g−1 reducing sugars) was obtained from 2.5 g L−1 reducing sugars (Fig. 2). The rate of hydrogen evolution increased by increasing the substrate concentration up to 10 g L−1 but it declined at 15 g L−1 (Fig. 2). The accumulation of fermentation end-products (e.g. ethanol and organic acids) and fall in pH can exert sufficient ‘stress’ to halt mesophilic H2 production by E. coli in an excess of substrate [42,43]. It is more advantageous to operate the fermentation by E. coli at low reducing sugars concentration (2.5 g L−1) to obtain the highest hydrogen yield at a moderate hydrogen formation rate (11 ml H2 h−1 L−1) (Fig. 2)."
15,Biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the waste E. coli biomass,"3.2 Biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the waste E. coli biomass Subsequent to hydrogen production by E. coli from the acid hydrolyzed molasses, the waste bacterial biomass was collected and its biosorption efficiency for Cd2+ and Zn2+ was investigated. The optimum pH for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by freeze-dried waste biomass of E. coli was 6 and the optimum contact time was 20 min at room temperature (data not shown)."
16,Biosorption isotherms,"3.3 Biosorption isotherms Zinc and cadmium biosorption performance by freeze-dried E. coli waste biomass was achieved by the biosorption equilibrium measurements at initial concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 mg/L at pH 6. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the amount (mg/g) of Zn2+ and Cd2+ biosorbed by E. coli waste biomass against the concentration of Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions remaining in the solution (mg/L). For a given initial metal ion concentration, the amount of Cd2+ biosorbed by E. coli biomass was greater than that of Zn2+ ions (Fig. 3). The biosorption equilibrium data were analyzed with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Through the modeling of the biosorption equilibrium data it is possible to characterize biosorbents under various operational conditions and this point is essential for future industrial applications [44]. 3.3.1 The Langmuir isotherm model The Langmuir isotherm model was chosen to estimate the maximum biosorption capacity corresponding to complete monolayer coverage by the metal ions on the biosorbent (E. coli) surface. The biosorption data was analyzed using the Langmuir model in its linear form Eq. (3). The data fitted quite well with the Langmuir model (Fig. 4 ) with very high regression correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0.99) for both Cd2+ and Zn2+ (Table 1 ). The validity of these data through the Langmuir model indicates that the biosorption of Zn2+ and Cd2+ in the present study can be characterized by a monolayer formation of the metal ions on the surface of E. coli. The maximum biosorption capacities (q max) of E. coli for Cd2+ and Zn2+ were 162.1 and 137.9 mg/g, respectively (Table 1). Taking into account the atomic weight of both heavy metals, the maximum biosorption capacities (q max) of E. coli for Cd2+ and Zn2+ would be 3.377 and 4.597 mmol g−1, respectively. Thus, the E. coli maximum biosorption capacity for Zn2+ would be higher than Cd2+. This differential type of Cd2+ and Zn2+ biosorption can be ascribed to the difference in their ionic radii [45]. The smaller-ionic radii metal ions appear to adsorb more on the biomass, which is consistent with surface adsorption mechanism, since smaller-radius metal ions have greater adsorption tendency than larger ones as the element with smaller-ionic radius will compete faster for exchange sites than those of lager ionic radius [45]. This may explain the greater biosorption ability of Zn2+ on the E. coli biomass than Cd2+ as the ionic radius of Zn2+ (0.74 A°) is smaller than that of Cd2+ (0.95 A°). 3.3.2 The Freundlich isotherm The Freundlich isotherm model was chosen to estimate the biosorption intensity of Cd2+ and Zn2+ toward the E. coli biomass. This model is usually used in its linear form Eq. (5) for analyzing the biosorption equilibrium data [17,23,24]. The linear plot of Freundlich equation for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by freeze-dried E. coli waste biomass is shown in Fig. 5 . The values of Freundlich parameters are summarized in Table 1. The value of the biosorption intensity (n) of E. coli biomass for both Cd2+ and Zn2+ is greater than unity (Table 1) indicating that they are both favorably adsorbed by the waste E. coli biomass. The equilibrium data were found to fit reasonably well with the Freundlich model (Fig. 5) with regression correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.921) for Cd2+ and (R2 = 0.958) for Zn2+ (Table 1). However, these values of regression correlation coefficients in Freundlich model are lower than their corresponding values in Langmuir model. Thus, Langmuir model fitted the equilibrium data better than the Freundlich isotherm for describing the biosorption equilibrium of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass."
17,Kinetics of Cd2+ and Zn2+ biosorption by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass,"3.4 Kinetics of Cd2+ and Zn2+ biosorption by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass Fig. 6 A shows the changes in the amount (mg g−1) of Cd2+ and Zn2+ biosorbed by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass with time. The amount of metal biosorbed increased rapidly up to a constant value of metal concentration after 20 min. A further increase in incubation time up to 400 min or even up to 3 days had no significant effect on the biosorption of the heavy metals. Thus, it can be concluded that the appropriate equilibrium time for biosorption is reached at 20 min. This short time required for biosorption is in accordance with the results given by other authors [22,24,46,47]. In order to examine the controlling mechanism of the biosorption process, experiment kinetic data in Fig. 6A were analyzed using two kinetic models; the pseudo first-order and the pseudo second-order model. Fig. 6B and C show linear plots of the linearized forms of the pseudo first-order model in Eq. (7) and the pseudo second-order model in Eq. (9) respectively, for the biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass. Table 2 , shows the theoretical qe values obtained from both models in comparison with the experiment values (q exp). The theoretical biosorption capacities (qe ) for Cd2+ and Zn2+ estimated from the pseudo first-order model showed a deviation from the experiment values (q exp). In contrast, the pseudo second-order results showed a theoretical qe values very close to the experiment values (Table 2). Therefore, it can be concluded that the pseudo second-order biosorption model is more suitable to describe the biosorption kinetics of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the freeze-dried waste E. coli biomass."
18,Comparison between waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production and aerobically grown E. coli for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+,"3.5 Comparison between waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production and aerobically grown E. coli for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ Biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by freeze-dried biomass of aerobically grown E. coli (in nutrient broth) were also investigated for comparison with the waste E. coli biomass after hydrogen production. Zinc and cadmium biosorption performance by freeze-dried cells of aerobically grown E. coli was achieved by the biosorption equilibrium measurements at initial concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 mg L−1 of Cd2+ or Zn2+ (Supplementary Fig. 1). The q max deduced from Langmuir isotherm for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by aerobically grown E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 2) were 55.3 and 42.6 mg g−1 respectively. In contrast, the maximum biosorption capacities (q max) of waste E. coli (after hydrogen production) for Cd2+ and Zn2+ were around three times more than that of aerobically grown E. coli in nutrient broth (Table 3 ). Such maximum biosorption capacity values of waste E. coli (after hydrogen production) for Cd2+ (162.1 mg/g) and Zn2+ (137.9 mg/g) are also higher than those of many previously studied biosorbents (Table 3)."
19,Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis,"3.6 Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis The FTIR spectra were taken, in the range of 500–4000 cm−1, for the freeze-dried cells of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7 A) and the freeze-dried waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production from acid hydrolyzed molasses (metal free biomass) (Fig. 7B) as will as the waste E. coli biomasses after biosorption of Cd2+ (Fig. 7C) or Zn2+ (Fig. 7D) (metal ions loaded). The spectra display a number of absorption peaks, reflecting the complex nature of the biomass. The FTIR spectra of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production (Fig. 7B) differed from that of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7A). The absorption peaks at 2359–2342 cm−1, corresponded to the amine (N–H2 +) group [74,75], appeared in the spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production (Fig. 7B) in comparison to that of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7A). In the spectrum of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7A), the peak at 861 cm−1 is attributed to the presence of aromatic –CH stretching [76]. Such peak disappeared in the spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production (Fig. 7B). The absorption bands characterizing hydroxyl and amine groups were assigned at 3500–3200 cm−1. A peak at 3500–3200 cm−1 region is due to the stretching of the N–H bond of amino groups and indicative of bonded hydroxyl group [44,77]. Such bands were stronger in the spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production (Fig. 7B) than the spectrum of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7A). The absorption peaks at 3000–2900 cm−1 are ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of C–H bond of the –CH2 groups combined with that of the CH3 groups [44,78]. Such bands were also stronger in the spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production (Fig. 7B) than the spectrum of aerobically grown E. coli (Fig. 7A). The CO of amide I was assigned at 1650−1 while the NH/CO combination of the amide II bond was present at 1544 cm−1. These peaks were stronger in the spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli than the spectrum of aerobically grown E. coli. The absorption peaks at 1650 and 1544 cm−1 confirm also the presence of carboxyl groups. The peaks in the range 1300–1067 cm−1 are attributable to the presence of carboxyl and phosphate groups [79] which have same intensity in both spectra (Fig. 7A and B). It is observed from the spectra of Cd2+ or Zn2+-loaded E. coli waste biomass (Fig. 7C and D) that the intensity of almost all functional groups had decreased and some characteristic absorption peaks even disappeared. Pradhan et al. [80] and Volesky [81] affirm that the main functional groups responsible for a biosorption process are the hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, sulfonate, amide, imidazole, phosphonate and phosphodiester groups. Some of these groups are present on the E. coli biomass and may interact with the metal ions leading to such observed change in the FTIR spectra of Cd2+ or Zn2+-loaded E. coli waste biomass. The appearance of strong peaks for the amine groups at 2359–2342 cm−1 and the increase in the intensity of many other functional groups in the FTIR spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production in comparison to that of aerobically grown E. coli might explain the higher biosorption capacity for Cd2+ or Zn2+ by the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production than aerobically grown E. coli."
20,Conclusion,"In this study, the highest hydrogen formation rate by E. coli HD701 from acid hydrolyzed molasses was obtained from 10 g L−1 reducing sugars. However, it is more advantageous to operate the fermentation by E. coli at low reducing sugars concentration (2.5 g L−1) to obtain the highest hydrogen yield at a moderate hydrogen formation rate. The waste E. coli biomass showed a high efficiency for biosorption of Cd2+ and Zn2+ with maximum biosorption capacities (q max) of 162.1 and 137.9 (mg/g), respectively. These q max values were around three times more than that of aerobically grown E. coli and are higher than those of many previously studied biosorbents, indicating a potential biosorption of both heavy metals by the waste E. coli biomass. The FTIR spectrum of the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production showed an appearance of strong peaks for the amine groups and an increase in the intensity of many other functional groups in comparison to that of aerobically grown E. coli which might explain the higher biosorption capacity for Cd2+ or Zn2+ by the waste biomass of E. coli after hydrogen production than aerobically grown E. coli. The use of the waste bacterial biomass in heavy metals biosorption would make the biotechnology of heavy metals biosorption by heterotrophic bacteria inexpensive and duplicates the benefits of biological hydrogen production technology. Further future studies, for exploring the efficiency of the waste biomass of other dark fermentative and also photofermentative hydrogen producing bacteria in biosorption technology, would be of interest to interlink such biotechnologies."
