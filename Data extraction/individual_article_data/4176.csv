0,Introduction,"With the prospect of unstable and rising price for petroleum, there has been an increasing interest on the development of sustainable manufacturing processes to supply chemicals and fuels. Production of biofuels, in particular, has been the focus of many groups with successful outcomes (for review see Alper and Stephanopoulos, 2009; Jang et al., in press; Mainguet and Liao, 2010; Yan and Liao, 2009). The development of successful biofuels production requires utilization of alternative substrates, increased tolerance to product toxicity (Nicolaou et al., 2010; Fischer et al., 2008), and discovery of new fuel molecules. Several metabolic pathways have been engineered to produce higher alcohols (Atsumi et al., 2008a, 2008b; Nielsen et al., 2009), alkane (Schirmer et al., 2010), and biodiesel (Steen et al., 2010) in Escherichia coli as well as in others hosts such as Corynebacterium glutamicum (Smith et al., 2010), Clostridium cellulolyticum (Higashide et al., 2011), Bacillus subtilis (Li et al., 2011), cyanobacteria (Atsumi et al., 2009; Lan and Liao, 2011; Lan and Liao, 2012), and Ralstonia eutropha (Li et al., 2012). In addition, the production of biofuels using Clostridium producers has continued to make significant strides (Lee et al., 2009; Wang and Blaschek, 2011; Lehmann and Lutke-Eversloh, 2011). The synthesis of n-butanol in Clostridium species is based on coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent Claisen condensation of two acetyl-CoA followed by reduction, dehydration, and hydrogenation. This sequence of reactions follows the chemistry of β-oxidation in reverse with minor exceptions. Recently, this CoA-dependent β-reduction type linear alcohol synthesis has been extended to increase the alcohol carbon chain length (Dekishima et al., 2011; Dellomonaco et al., 2011). Although many enzymes of this CoA-dependent pathway are reversible, a key step, trans-enoyl-CoA reduction, is catalyzed by an irreversible enzyme acting in the synthesis (hydrogenation) direction, rather than the degradation (dehydrogenation) direction (Bond-Watts et al., 2011; Dekishima et al., 2011; Dellomonaco et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2011). Extension of chain length ( Fig. 1) requires another round of condensation, reduction, dehydration, and hydrogenation. It has been shown that expression of β-ketothiolase (BktB) from Ralstonia eutropha, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd) and crotonase (Crt) from Clostridium acetobutylicum, and trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter) from Euglena gracilis (Egl.Ter) or Treponema denticola (Tde.Ter) were able to extend the CoA-dependent n-butanol pathway by one more round to produce n-hexanol, although the efficiency remains low (Dekishima et al., 2011). This n-hexanol synthesis pathway, however, can be improved if enzymes that favor longer chain substrates can be identified or engineered. In general, two strategies can be employed for this purpose: bioprospecting and enzyme directed evolution. Bioprospecting allows the finding of new enzymes in nature that exhibit the desired properties. Protein directed evolution, on the other hand, offers the potential to improve the function of a specific enzyme (Cadwell and Joyce, 1992; Leung et al., 1989; Stemmer, 1994). Various techniques for directed evolution have been shown to be highly successful to improve or modify the function of the targeted enzyme (Cheriyan et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2002; Zhao and Arnold, 1999) and by extension to improve the production of a desired product in a pathway (Atsumi and Liao, 2008; Christ et al., 2010; Wang and Liao, 2001). However, a major challenge in either bioprospecting or directed evolution is the effectiveness of the screening strategy, which determines the throughput of the effort. In this work, we developed a selection strategy to favor chain elongation. The strategy is built on the anaerobic growth rescue platform previously used to select evolved proteins for the n-butanol production pathway (Shen et al., 2011). Instead of a non-specific alcohol dehydrogenase used in the production of linear alcohols, an acyl-CoA thioesterase that favors longer chain fatty acid synthesis is used to couple anaerobic growth rescue with production. Using this platform, we evolved one of the enzymes in the pathway and achieved increased production of n-hexanol and n-octanol."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents All chemicals were purchase from Thermo Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) or Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA polymerase, Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase were acquired from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Deoxynucleotides were purchased from Fermentas/Thermo Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT (San Diego, CA). Bugbuster® and Lysonase® were purchased from EMD/Novagen (San Diego, CA)"
3,Culture medium and conditions,"2.2 Culture medium and conditions E. coli strains were normally grown in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics at 37°C and rotatory agitation at 250rpm. Antibiotics when required were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100μg/mL; kanamycin, 50μg/mL; tetracycline, 10μg/mL. 2.2.1 Anaerobic growth rescue The anaerobic growth rescue was performed as described previously (Shen et al., 2011). Briefly, 10μL of overnight cultures of E. coli strain JCL166 and its derivatives are used to inoculate 5mL of LB medium containing 1% glucose, 100μM isopropy-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and antibiotic as needed, in a 10mL BD Vacutainer tube (San Jose, CA). The tubes are sealed and a needle attached to a Millipore PES 0.22μm filter is introduced. Next, the headspace is vacuumed and replaced by an anaerobic mix of 5% H2 and 95% N2. The needle is removed inside an anaerobic chamber, and the sealed tubes are incubated for 24h or longer at 37°C and 250rpm. 2.2.2 Culture condition for hexanoic acid production Overnight cultures of E. coli strain JCL299 carrying the desired plasmids were prepared from single colonies and 50μL were used to inoculate 5mL LB-1% glucose, and incubated at 37°C and 250rpm until A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. The cultures were then induced with 100μM IPTG and incubated at 30°C and 250rpm for 2h. Next, the cultures were transferred to a 10mL BD Vacutainer tube and vacuumed as described above for anaerobic growth rescue. For production, the cultures were incubated at 30°C and 250rpm for 48h. 2.2.3 Culture condition for alcohol production For alcohol production, the procedure is the same as described above for hexanoic acid with the exception that the cells were grown in Terrific Broth (12g tryptone, 24g yeast extract, 2.31g KH2PO4, 12.54g K2HPO4, and 4mL glycerol per liter of water) supplemented with 2% glucose."
4,Plasmid constructions,"2.3 Plasmid constructions A list of plasmids used in this work is presented in Table 1. All plasmids were constructed by DNA assembly techniques using either the Cold Fusion Cloning Kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) or a ligation independent cloning (LIC) protocol modified from previous publications (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990; Li and Evans, 1997; Li and Elledge, 2007) and briefly described below. In our modified LIC procedure both vector and inserts (gene of interest) were generated by PCR using a high fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion DNA polymerase). Oligonucleotides for inserts were designed with 18–21 nucleotides at the 5′-end overlapping with the flanking sequences of the vector DNA. This method utilizes the exonuclease property of T4 DNA polymerase in the absence of nucleotides to generate single stranded DNA stretches in the vector and insert fragment ends which can anneal holding the fragments in place and then be repaired in vivo after transformation in an E. coli strain (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990; Li and Evans, 1997; Li and Elledge, 2007). PCR products were purified using a PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, or Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and the DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260nm. Next, the vector and PCR product insert were mixed (1:1–1:2 ratio) in a total DNA amount of 400–500ng in 10μL 1x NEB Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs) containing 0.25μL T4 DNA polymerase (0.75 U). The reaction was incubated for 5–10min at room temperature, followed by 5–10min incubation on ice, and a 3μL aliquot was used to transform 50μL E. coli XL1-Blue competent cells according to a standard transformation protocol. The transformed cells were plated on LB plates containing the required antibiotics and incubated at 37°C for 24h. The presence of correctly cloned inserts was determined by colony PCR and DNA sequencing. Plasmid pHM06 was created by amplifying the Mus musculus brain acyl-CoA hydrolase (mBACH) gene from cDNA prepared from mouse C57/Bl6 brain tissue and assembled onto PCR amplified pET28a. To create plasmid pHM10H, pEL11 was used as template and amplified by PCR deleting the adhE2 which was replaced by a PCR fragment carrying mBACH from pHM06. Plasmids pHM10C and pHM10P were constructed in a similar replacing the C. acetobutylicum crt and hbd genes in pHM10H by the C. kluyveri crt1 and R. eutropha paaH1, respectively. C. kluyveri crt1 was synthesized by Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ) with codon optimization for E. coli. R. eutropha paaH1 gene was amplified from strain H16 genomic DNA. pDK019 was created by replacing the C. acetobutylicum hbd gene in pEL11 by the R. eutropha paaH1. pHL101 was created by replacing the ColA origin of replication in pEL102 by a PCR fragment containing the CloDF13 replicon from pCDFDuet-1 (EMD/Novagen). pHM10-P mutant series were created using error-prone PCR and the EZClone protocol as described below. pHM25-P series were constructed by replacing the mBACH gene in pHM10-P mutant plasmids by the C. acetobutylicum adhE2 PCR fragment. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing performed by Laragen (Los Angeles, CA)."
5,paaH1 directed evolution,"2.4 paaH1 directed evolution The R. eutropha paaH1 gene in pHM10P was randomly mutagenized by error-prone PCR using the GeneMorph II® EZClone Domain Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent/Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a medium mutation rate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, aliquots of 2μL of the EZClone reaction were used to transform 50μL electrocompetent E. coli strain JCL166 carrying plasmid pHL101. The cells were recovered in 1mL LB medium for 1h at 37°C and 250rpm and then added 4mL LB medium, 1% glucose, 100μM IPTG, 100μg/mL ampicillin, 50μg/mL kanamycin, transferred to a 10mL Vacutainer tube and subjected to anaerobiosis as described above. The tubes were incubated at 30°C and 250rpm for 96h. Next, a second round of anaerobic growth rescue was performed by diluting the culture from the first round 200 fold in 5mL of fresh LB 1% glucose, 100μM IPTG and antibiotics, and again subjecting them to anaerobiosis and incubation at 30°C and 250rpm for 48h. The cultures that showed increased growth compared to control were selected for plasmid isolation by minipreps (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), transformed in E. coli XL1-Blue, and selected in LB-agar plates containing 100μg/mL ampicillin. Two colonies from each plate were selected for individual clones isolation. These clones were again transformed into JCL166/pHL101 to confirm their ability to rescue growth under anaerobic conditions. Those which confirmed the growth rescue phenotype were sequenced to identify the mutations."
6,Enzyme assays,"2.5 Enzyme assays Mouse brain acyl-CoA hydrolase (mBACH) activity was determined as described elsewhere (Yamada et al., 1999). Briefly, the enzyme solution was incubated at 30°C in 100mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.1mM 5, 5′-dithio-bis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB), and 20μM acyl-CoA substrate. The increase in absorbance due to 5′-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) formation was registered for 1–3min at 412nm. The enzyme activity (U) was expressed as micromoles of acyl-CoA hydrolyzed per minute at 30°C. Other enzyme assays were performed according to previously described methods (Dekishima et al. 2011)."
7,Quantification of hexanoic acid and alcohols,"2.6 Quantification of hexanoic acid and alcohols Hexanoic acid and alcohols were quantified by gas chromatography on Agilent GC 6850 system equipped with flame ionization detector and DB-FFAP capillary column (30m, 0.32mm internal diameter, 0.25μm film thickness) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Culture samples were collected, centrifuged for 5min at 15,000rpm, and a supernatant aliquot was injected in split injection mode (1:15 split ratio) using 2-methyl-1-pentanol for internal standard, as described previously (Atsumi et al., 2008a). The concentration of butyric acid, hexanoic acid, n-butanol, n-hexanol and n-octanol in the samples were calculated based on standard solutions."
8,Results,
9,Anaerobic growth rescue scheme using long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase,"3.1 Anaerobic growth rescue scheme using long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase Previously, a selection scheme was constructed (Shen et al., 2011) to couple anaerobic growth rescue with n-butanol production based on NADH recycling. This scheme uses an E. coli strain, JCL166 (ΔldhA ΔadhE ΔfrdBC), which does not have any fermentative pathway to recycle NADH produced in glycolysis. This strain cannot grow anaerobically unless an NADH-consuming pathway is functional or an electron acceptor is provided (Shen et al., 2011). The n-hexanol pathway (Dekishima et al., 2011) is NADH-consuming, just like the n-butanol pathway, and in principle could rescue JCL166 in anaerobic growth in glucose. However, to create a selection method that favors the production of C6 or higher compounds, the presence of the multi-functional alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE2 from C. acetobutylicum as the last enzyme in the pathway constitutes an obstacle since this enzyme produces more n-butanol (C4) rather than n-hexanol (C6) in our pathway (Fig. 1) as demonstrated by Dekishima et al. (2011). Furthermore, Dekishima et al. demonstrated that AdhE2 is more active towards butyryl-CoA (41mU/mg) than hexanoyl-CoA (15mU/mg). Shen et al. (2011) have previously demonstrated that anaerobic growth and n-butanol production is impaired in JCL166 overexpressing A to B, C. acetobutylicum Hbd and Crt, and T. denticola Ter, but not C. acetobutylicum AdhE2. Because overexpression of the complete n-butanol pathway (i.e., A to B, Hbd, Crt, Ter, and AdhE2) already rescues anaerobic growth, this scheme does not provide a preferential selection for chain elongation. Replacing C. acetobutylicum AdhE2 with an enzyme that preferentially reacts with C6 or higher acyl-CoA compounds would be necessary for this system to select for longer than C4 compounds. Thus, instead of AdhE2, we employed acyl-CoA thioesterase that preferentially consumes longer chain acyl-CoA as a substrate to produce linear fatty acids. This scheme allows the selection for chain elongation. Although the final product is an acid, this scheme can be used to select or enrich the upstream enzymes that favor chain elongation. Then the selected enzyme can be used in the alcohol producing pathway that uses C. acetobutylicum AdhE2 or other alcohol dehydrogenases. With this purpose in mind, we investigated the activity of the long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase. In both human and mouse, the long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoA into their corresponding free fatty acid and CoA. These enzymes show broad specificity being able to hydrolyze acyl-CoA with carbon-chain length of C6–C20. Very low or no activity for C4 or lower has been observed by these enzymes (Kuramochi et al., 2002; Yamada et al., 1999). Therefore, we hypothesized that a long-chain specific acyl-CoA thioesterase would eliminate the production of C4 compounds and could relieve the metabolic stress created in our anaerobic NADH stress system and partially rescue cellular growth, and providing a platform to select enzymes that favor synthesis of higher chain-length-acyl-CoA compounds rather than C4 compounds (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we cloned and expressed the mouse brain acyl-CoA hydrolase (mBACH) from mouse cDNA and tested its activity as His-tag purified protein, confirming the enzyme preference to hydrolyze C6–C12 acyl-CoA substrates as previously described ( Table 2). Next, the mBACH gene was used to replace adhE2 in the plasmid pEL11 creating the expression vector pHM10H. The E. coli host JCL166 without plasmids was unable to grow in anaerobic conditions under our test conditions ( Fig. 2, first bar). However when plasmids pHM10H (expressing mBACH) and pHL101 were introduced in the cell some growth is observed (Fig. 2, 2nd bar). This result indicates that mBACH was able to rescue anaerobic growth of JCL166. Since mBACH favors longer chain acyl-CoA as a substrate, this strain construct can be used as a platform for chain elongation selection."
10,Screening for enzymes for the chain elongation pathway,"3.2 Screening for enzymes for the chain elongation pathway As shown in Fig. 1, condensation of two acetyl-CoA leads to n-butanol production at high titers (Shen et al., 2011). Addition of another thiolase, BktB, added a second round of chain elongation, allowing the synthesis of C6-CoA intermediates and n-hexanol production (Dekishima et al., 2011). By removing the C. acetobutylicum AdhE2 that consumes butyryl-CoA, and replacing it with mBACH which is less active towards this intermediate, we created a system that favors the second round of condensation. Any of the enzymes in the second round of chain elongation (Fig. 1) could limit the pathway flux, and thus the ability to recue growth in JCL166. Therefore, we decided to replace some enzymes on our pathway and test whether they would be able to rescue growth under anaerobic conditions in JCL166 strain. We constructed a new plasmid carrying C. kluyveri crt1 to replace C. acetobutylicum crt gene. C. kluyveri is a strict anaerobe able to ferment ethanol and acetate to produce butyric acid and hexanoic acid (Seedorf et al., 2008). Its natural ability to produce hexanoic acid suggests its crotonase enzyme might be more active towards C6 compounds than C. acetobutylicum crt. We also constructed a plasmid carrying R. eutropha paaH1 to replace C. acetobutylicum hbd. The 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA reductase (PaaH1) from R. eutropha paaH1 has been shown to be active towards C4–C10 substrates (Haywood et al., 1988). In particular, its activity towards C4 and C6 is 13.5μmol/min/mg and 6.75μmol/min/mg, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, PaaH1 seemed to be a promising alternative to C. acetobutylicum hbd. When tested for anaerobic growth rescue, to our surprise C. kluyveri crt1 decreased the cell density at 24h (or 48h, not shown). On the other hand R. eutropha paaH1 behaved similarly to the original homolog C. acetobutylicum hbd (3rd and 4th bars in Fig. 2). Based on this result, it was difficult to conclude the bottleneck of this C6 pathway. To further analyze the effect of these alternative enzymes have on the C6 pathway, we tested for hexanoic acid production in E. coli strain JCL299. Interestingly, the presence of R. eutropha paaH1 allowed production of 91mg/L compared to undetectable amounts by C. acetobutylicum hbd, indicating that PaaH1 outperforms Hbd in the reduction of 3-ketohexanoyl-CoA. There is a possibility that this reaction may be a potential limiting step for improved chain elongation. Based on this hypothesis, we decided to attempt to evolve PaaH1 using the anaerobic growth rescue selection. If the evolved PaaH1 allows for anaerobic growth, then the production of C6 or higher chain-length products would be expected."
11,Selection of evolved PaaH1 by anaerobic growth rescue,"3.3 Selection of evolved PaaH1 by anaerobic growth rescue We performed error-prone PCR on the paaH1 gene in plasmid pHM10P using a commercially available low fidelity DNA polymerase (Mutazyme II, Agilent) and electroporated directly into a JCL166 strain carrying pHL101, generating a library of 26 pools of at least 2000 clones each. Immediately after electroporation and 1h cell recovery in LB medium, the library cultures were supplemented with 1% glucose, 100μM IPTG and antibiotics, and subjected to the first round of anaerobic growth rescue procedure. After 96h incubation at 30°C and rotatory agitation at 250rpm, the cultures were diluted 160 fold and subjected to a second round of anaerobic growth rescue. Fig. 3 shows the results after two rounds of growth rescue. Plasmids were isolated from thirteen library cultures with optical densities equal or higher than that observed for library plib25. After transformation in E. coli XL1-Blue strain, two independent plasmids from each selected library were isolated and again screened for anaerobic growth rescue in JCL166. After DNA sequencing, we observed that in nine libraries, the two isolated clones were identical, while in the other four libraries the two individual clones showed different mutations. These results showed that our selection platform is able to greatly enrich a particular mutant from a mixed mutant population based on its ability improve the cell survival and growth under the tested conditions. We chose five different clones from five libraries for further testing and renamed these variants as P01, P042, P06, P09, and P13. We confirmed their ability to rescue growth of JCL166 under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2). The protein sequence alignment for the selected clones is shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, PaaH1-P01 variant contains only a silent mutation on a leucine codon, CTG>CTA. This codon change from a higher codon usage to a rare one in E. coli seemed to be enough to improve the strain fitness under our selection strategy. This result indicates that a change of expression of PaaH1 alone could improve the production of long chain acids and alcohols."
12,PaaH1 variants improved hexanoic acid production,"3.4 PaaH1 variants improved hexanoic acid production The addition of a thioesterase (mBACH) at the last step in our selection platform pathway should result in the production of hexanoic acid. Therefore, we tested the amount of hexanoic acid produced by the selected paaH1 mutants compared to the wild type gene ( Fig. 5). Production was carried out in E. coli JCL299 which has been previously shown to produce higher titers of n-butanol than JCL166 (Shen et al., 2011). As expected, we observed increased production of hexanoic acid for most PaaH1 variants compared to the wild type PaaH1 after 60h fermentation."
13,Improved n-hexanol and n-octanol production by E. coli,"3.5 Improved n-hexanol and n-octanol production by E. coli Finally, we tested whether the evolved PaaH1 mutants were able to improve production of n-hexanol. For this purpose, we reintroduced the C. acetobutylicum adhE2 gene replacing mBACH in the pHM10 plasmid series to create the pHM25 plasmid series. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli JCL299 in conjunction with pHL101, which carries the other n-hexanol pathway genes, and tested for alcohol production after 48h fermentation on glucose ( Fig. 6). Replacing the original C. acetobutylicum hbd by the R. eutropha paaH1 wild-type gene already improves the titer on n-hexanol production by 10 fold, from ∼30mg/L–280mg/L after 48h fermentation. This result was not surprising since we previously observed increased hexanoic acid production on the strain carrying paaH1 compared to hbd (Fig. 4). In a similar way, we observed an increase of 67% to 469mg/L n-hexanol for the strains expressing the paaH1 mutants compared to that expressing the wild type gene. These results indicate that this selection platform may be used to selectively evolve the CoA dependent pathway for longer chain alcohol or acid biosynthesis. It is worth noting that in JCL299 strains expressing PaaH1 mutants P01 and P06, production of ethanol and n-butanol is reduced while that of n-hexanol and n-octanol remains at similar levels as the other mutants. This result is somewhat indicative of a potential different distribution pattern of the intracellular CoA intermediates. Analysis of metabolite distribution may yet bring additional insights. It is, however, out of the scope of current report."
14,Discussion,"Recursive carbon chain elongation pathways have been used in nature to produce fatty acids, polyketides, isoprenoids and α-ketoacid (Felnagle et al., 2012; Shen and Liao, 2011). Carbon chain elongation is particularly useful for developing non-natural products such as long chain alcohols (Marcheschi, et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2008). In this work we developed an anaerobic growth rescue selection platform for chain elongation using the CoA-dependent n-butanol pathway for linear alcohol synthesis. This method is based on redox imbalance-induced growth inhibition in E. coli (Shen et al., 2011). The host strain, JCL166 (ΔldhA ΔadhE ΔfrdBC) in which the fermentative pathways were deleted, cannot grow anaerobically in glucose medium unless an NADH consuming pathway is introduced or an external electron acceptor is present. For instance, introduction of the n-hexanol pathway consumes six moles of NADH to produce one mole of n-hexanol thus recycling NAD+ and CoA (Dekishima et al., 2011). However, this n-hexanol pathway relies on the activity of the C. acetobutylicum bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE2) at the last step to convert hexanoyl-CoA to hexaldehyde and finally hexanol. Owing to AdhE2's low specificity, production of n-butanol outcompetes for the production of n-hexanol (see Fig. 1), and could not select for chain elongation. Elimination of AdhE2 results in accumulation of intermediates containing CoA, which are generally toxic. To create a platform that would allow us to select for increased chain length of linear alcohols, we introduced a mammalian long-chain specific thioesterase, mBACH, to produce longer-chain fatty acid, e.g., hexanoic acid, and consume the accumulated acyl-CoA and allow recycling of CoA cofactor and NADH, and at the same time, avoiding or reducing the production of C4 products. Using this approach to enrich for evolved mutants after a single round of error-prone PCR, we were able to isolate several mutants that showed increased production of hexanoic acid and n-hexanol compared to the wild-type strain. Two rounds of growth rescue were enough to enrich for improved variants of PaaH1 and allow easy isolation of individual variant clones. DNA sequencing analyses of the enriched variants showed that most carry mutations on the first half of the protein on the NAD-binding domain which may have affected cofactor binding, improving the enzyme activity (Rodriguez-Zavala, 2008). Protein alignment of PaaH1 variants with Hbd homologs are shown as supplementary data (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Curiously, one mutant that improved anaerobic cell growth and n-hexanol production contained only a silent mutation which replaced a frequently used leucine codon CTG with a rare codon in E. coli, CTA. It is likely that this transition changed the expression of PaaH1, allowing it to enhance the overall production of n-hexanol and n-octanol. Other parameters such as codon usage and stability of mRNA secondary structure may have also have effects on protein translation efficiency as well. The specific mechanism for the increased higher alcohol production is out of the scope of current work. In summary, we developed a selection platform for enzymes that favors and allows the production of higher chain alcohols using the CoA-dependent pathway for chain elongation. By searching for natural enzymes that are capable of catalyzing the desirable reactions, in this case PaaH1, we were able to increase the production of n-hexanol by 10-fold. Furthermore, by applying this selection for the evolution of PaaH1, we were able to increase the n-hexanol production by another 67%. This evolved PaaH1 also enabled a third round of carbon elongation with acetyl-CoA, thereby reaching the production of n-octanol. The development of this selection and enrichment platform also can be used for further evolution or bioprospecting new genes from pools of genomic or expression libraries."
