0,Introduction,"Humanity currently faces enormous energy challenges and environmental problems (Snape et al., 2011; Elimelech and Phillip, 2011; Wang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019). It is imperative that reliable technologies are developed to resolve these problems. The photocatalytic (PC) production of clean energy from oxidizing refractory organic pollutants using inexhaustible and environmentally friendly solar energy is an attractive way to realize this goal (Hu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019a). Semiconductors illuminated by sunlight can exceed the band gap energy to produce large amounts of electrons (e−) and holes (h+) (Li et al., 2019b). The electrons could be used to reduce H+ to produce renewable energy, H2, while the holes could react with hydroxyl ions (OH−) adsorbed on the catalyst surface to generate hydroxyl radicals ( OH) that could be used to degrade organic pollutants, which would be a more valuable method compared with traditional methods, such as PC water splitting or the degradation of organic pollutants (where h+ are used to oxidize water into O2 or e− are used to reduce O2) (Fujishima et al., 2008). Many studies have focused on simultaneous PC H2 generation and organic compound oxidation using powder photocatalysts, which have superior specific surface areas and are easy to prepare (Montini et al., 2016; Gomathisankar et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2019). However, powder photocatalysts are relatively difficult to collect and recycle for practical use and may cause secondary pollution if the nanoparticles are released into water (Hochbaum and Yang, 2010a). Furthermore, it is difficult to simultaneously oxidize organic pollutants and generate hydrogen due to the low photocatalytic efficiencies and unsuitable energy band structure of the photocatalysts (Wang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2010). In this case, a PC system based on the use of a photoelectrode seems more favorable for recovering energy from wastewater treatment in large-scale applications. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) systems based on photoanodes were reported to simultaneously generate H2 and degrade organic pollutants, in which an external bias potential was used to drive electron transport from the photoanode to the cathode to reduce H+ into H2 (Zeng et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2018; Park et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2018a, b; Dai et al., 2019). However, these PEC systems consume additional electricity, therefore weakening their energy economy. Recently, PC fuel cell (PFC) has received attention, as it can drive simultaneous wastewater treatment and hydrogen production using only light illumination (Li et al., 2019c; Zeng et al., 2018c; Zhang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2017; Seger et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2015). For example, a PFC system composed of a TiO2 photoanode, a Nafion membrane, and a platinum cathode, as reported by Seger et al., was used to photo-oxidize formic acid and produce H2 (Seger et al., 2012). A PFC composed of a separate TiO2 photoanode and Cu2O photocathode, which degraded phenol and produced H2, was developed by Wu et al. and had a maximum TOC removal rate of 84.2% and an H2 production rate of 10.85 μmol cm−2 during 8 h of operation (Wu et al., 2015). However, some inherent shortages limit the large-scale applications of the reported PFCs. For example, their internal bias, which originates from the Fermi level difference between the electrodes, is too small (i.e., <0.8 V) to drive efficient charge transfer and hydrogen generation (Seger et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2015). Additionally, single photoelectrodes are always sensitive to limited sunlight (Li et al., 2019c). Therefore, it is highly desirable to design a novel PFC system with high sunlight availability and a high internal bias potential to improve the efficiency of solar hydrogen production from organic compound degradation. On the other hand, photoelectrodes initiate the generation of electron/hole pairs that are excited by photons. Therefore, the photoelectrode is the most important part of a PFC system. TiO2 is the earliest reported photoanode material used in PFCs owing to its low cost, superior chemical stability and favorable band edge positions (Lianos, 2011; Fujishima et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013). The TiO2 films had various morphologies and were composed of various structures, such as nanoparticles, nanowire arrays, nanotube arrays and nanorod arrays (Liu et al., 2011; Kaneko et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016). Compared to dense, planar films, one-dimensional nanoarrays not only have enhanced specific surface areas but also provide a direct tunnel for charge transfer (Hochbaum and Yang, 2010b). However, pure TiO2 films still have high rates of electron/hole pair recombination because of their low donor density and electronic properties (Long et al., 2014). Doping TiO2 with metal/metalloid ions is one common way to improve its PC performance, because impurities can introduce an impurity energy level or improve the donor density and electrical conductivity. In this work, we first prepared a highly active, vertically arranged silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod array (STNR) by a facile hydrothermal method. Then, we constructed a novel unassisted, hybrid tandem PFC (HTPFC) by combining an STNR and a rear silicon solar cell (SSC), which acts as a monolithic photoanode for the production of hydrogen from the degradation of organic compounds during exposure to sunlight. The STNR was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy. The results indicate that silicon doping notably improved the electronic and PEC properties of the STNR. After assembling the HTPFC, the STNR absorbed relatively short wavelength light to generate electron/hole pairs, and the rear SSC absorbed relatively long wavelength transmission light to create a bias potential to facilitate electron transfer from the STNR to the Pt cathode for hydrogen generation. An open-circuit voltage of 2.17 V was achieved. Furthermore, the proposed PFC had a removal ratio of 94.3% for degrading tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), which was used as a model organic pollutant because it was a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic that was toxic and bio-refractory, and its release into the waters was harmful to the eco-system and could cause persistent damage, after operation for 1.5 h and an average hydrogen generation rate of ˜28.8 μmol h−1 cm−2. The effects of the initial organic compound concentration, pH, electrolyte concentration and various organics were studied systematically. This work provides new guidance for designing photoelectrode materials and PFC systems for solar hydrogen production from organic compound degradation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetraethyl orthosilicate (C8H20O4Si, 99%), potassium sulfate (K2SO4,99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 90%), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC, 98%), methyl orange (MO, 98%), methylene blue (MB, 98%), atrazine (ATZ, 98%), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 98%), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP, 98%), 2,4-dichlorphenoloxyacetic (2,4-D, 98%), methyl alcohol (99.9%), ethanol (99.9%), acetone (95%), acetonitrile (99.9%) were obtained from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co. Ltd. Deionized (DI) water was used in the whole preparation process of aqueous solution."
3,Preparation of silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays,"2.2 Preparation of silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays First, a clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 7 Ω cm−1, 2.5 × 5 cm2) conducting glass was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s with a TiO2 seed layer using an ethanol solution containing 1% (v/v) tetrabutyl titanate, and the resulting film was then annealed at 450 °C for two hours. A hydrothermal solution was prepared by mixing 30 mL H2O, 30 mL HCl (37 wt%), 0–35 μL tetraethyl orthosilicate and 0.72 mL tetrabutyl titanate with vigorous magnetic stirring until the solution was colorless. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in which the FTO glass with the seed layer facing down was placed at the bottom, and the autoclave was then heated at 170 °C for six hours and then cooled naturally. The resulting film was rinsed with deionized water, dried at 70 °C for ten hours, and then annealed at 500 °C for two hours."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Sirion200, Philips, Netherlands) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F, JEOL, Japan). The crystallographic and physical characteristics were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, AXS-8 Advance, Bruker, Germany), Raman spectroscopy (SENTERRA R200, Bruker, Germany), and UV–vis spectroscopy (UH4150, Hitachi, Japan). The elemental chemical states were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, Shimadzu, Japan) with an AXIS Ultra DLD instrument and nonchromatic Al Kα radiation at 12 kV and 25 mA. The photoelectrochemical performance of the samples was examined using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660c, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a three-electrode configuration: an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated KCl), a Pt counter electrode, and the as-prepared films acted as the working electrode in a 0.1 M K2SO4 electrolyte solution. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp (PerfectLight, China) with an AM 1.5 filter (light density: 100 mW cm−2). Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) tests were recorded by an electrochemical workstation (Zennium pro, ZAHNER-elecktrik GmbH&Co.KG, Germany) equipped with a controlled intensity modulated photospectroscopy setup (CIMPS-2 pro, PP211, ZAHNER-elecktrik GmbH&Co.KG, Germany). The light source was a white light lamp (WLC02, ZAHNER-elecktrik GmbH&Co.KG, Germany). The applied modulated light was superimposed at a steady DC light intensity of 80 mWcm−2 in the frequency range of 0.1–100 Hz. For the IPCE tests, a continuous LED light source (TLS03, 365–1020 nm) was applied. Calculation of IPCE was carried out by the formula: I P C E % = 1240 × J λ × P × 100 Where J is photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P is the light power density (mW cm−2) at λ, and λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm)."
5,Construction of the HTPFC,"2.4 Construction of the HTPFC The hybrid system was assembled by adhering a commercial silicon solar cell (SSC, Shenzhen Huaxing Photoelectric Technology Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China) to the rear of the STNR array, and a Pt electrode was used as the cathode for hydrogen production. The STNR array and SSC were sealed with silicone rubber, which acted as a monolithic photoanode and connected to the positive pole. The concentration of the model organic pollutants, i.e. TC, MB, MO, ATZ, CIP, 2-CP and 2,4-D, was 10 mg L−1. A solution of 0–0.5 M K2SO4 was used as the supporting electrolyte. A 300-W Xe lamp (PerfectLight, China) with an AM 1.5 filter (light density: 100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source. The concentration change of TC was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, 1260 Infinity II, Agilent Technologies, USA). The electrochemical properties were recorded by an electrochemical station (CHI 760E, CH Instruments, Inc., USA). Either KOH or HCl was used to adjust the initial pH. Hydrogen generation was measured in a quartz device (LabSolar-IIIAG, Perfect Light, China) equipped with a vacuum pump (2TW-6 G, Tingwei, China), a low constant temperature bath (DC-2006, CNSHP, China), and a gas chromatograph (GC, GC-2010plus, Shimadzu, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared silicon-doped TiO2 film (5% doping) were studied by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The film grown on the FTO substrate was uniform and contained vertical nanorod arrays. The nanorods have quadrangular prism morphologies and smooth surfaces, and the top of the nanorods are dense convex squares, which indicates that the nanorods may comprise several smaller nanorods. The diameters of the nanorods are between 70 and 180 nm. The cross-section image shown in Fig. 1b shows that the sides of the nanorods are nearly perpendicular to the FTO substrate, and the average film thickness was ˜2.52 μm. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) of a silicon-doped TiO2 nanorod (STNR) and the FTO substrate show that two extra diffraction peaks appear for the STNR, which can be indexed to the (101) and (002) planes of rutile TiO2 (Liu and Aydil, 2009). In comparison with the standard XRD pattern of powdered rutile TiO2, the intensity of the (002) peak is significantly enhanced, which indicates that the nanorods are single crystalline and have a preferred [001] orientation, which agrees well with the observation that the nanorod arrays are vertically aligned on the substrate, as shown by the SEM results. The fine structure and the crystallinity of the STNRs were further investigated by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1d, the nanorod consists of a bundle of smaller nanorods. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns shown in Fig. 1d further indicate that the STNRs were rutile TiO2 and were highly crystalline with a growth direction of [001]. Fig. 1e and f are the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of a selected region at the end of the nanorod. Clearly, continuous lattice fringes were obtained, verifying that the STNR was a single crystal. The interplanar spacings of ˜0.29 nm and ˜0.32 nm were measured and found to be consistent with the (001) and (110) crystal planes of rutile TiO2, respectively, indicating that the nanorods are growing along the [001] direction (Shin et al., 2013). Fig. 1g-1l shows the cross-sectional SEM and EDS mapping of the STNR, where it can be seen that, in addition to Ti and O, Si is also distributed homogenously in the TiO2 matrix. The EDS mapping from the TEM mode also shows that the distribution of Si in the TiO2 nanorod matrix is homogenous (Fig. S1). These results show that the STNR possesses a morphology and crystal structure that are nearly identical to the previously reported TiO2 nanorods, which indicates that silicon doping does not affect the formation of the nanorod arrays. XPS was further applied to investigate the composition and the valence state of the STNRs. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the XPS survey shows that the STNRs consists of Ti, O, and Si, while there is no Si in TNR (Fig. S2) For the TNRs, the core level XPS spectrum of Ti 2p comprises two peaks at 458.4 eV and 464.3 eV, which are attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, and the difference between the peaks is 5.9 eV, which indicates the existence of Ti4+ species (Zhao et al., 2014). However, the peak positions for the STNRs are slightly shifted in the negative direction, which may occur due to the existence of Ti3+ species from the Si doping (Chen et al., 2011). The core level XPS spectra of O 1s are shown in Fig. 2c. For the TNRs, the deconvoluted peaks located at 529.7 eV and 531.6 eV may be associated with the lattice oxygen atoms of the TiOTi bond and the oxygen defects in the TiO2 that are caused by oxygen vacancies, respectively (Wang et al., 2009). The peak area percentages for the lattice oxygen atoms and oxygen vacancies are 80.3% and 19.7%, respectively. After Si doping, the peaks are negatively shifted and centered at 529.6 eV and 531.2 eV for the STNRs, which may occur due to the formation of SiOTi groups in the TiO2 matrix, which are caused by Si doping (Su et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2012). Furthermore, the peak area percentage of oxygen vacancies increases to 26.4%, which indicates that abundant oxygen vacancies are formed in the STNRs. Fig. 2d shows the high–resolution XPS spectrum, and a symmetrical Si 2p peak can be seen at 101.5 eV, which is negatively shifted compared with the reported value of ˜103 eV for pure SiO2 (Su et al., 2008). This reduced binding energy may occur because the positive charges of Si atoms in the SiOTi groups are less than those in the Si-O-Si groups. The electronegativity of Ti is smaller than that of Si, which further indicates the strong interaction between silicon and the TiO2 matrix. Generally, tetravalent Si doping will not cause oxygen vacancies to appear in the TiO2 matrix. Therefore, Ti3+ species may form in the TiO2 matrix to compensate for the electropositive oxygen vacancies (Lu et al., 2011; Gan et al., 2013). In this case, the charge carrier density and electrical conductivity of the STNRs would be significantly improved. The physicochemical characteristics of the prepared samples were further investigated by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2e, four typical Raman bands of the rutile phase are observed at 143, 235, 447, and 612 cm−1, which can be attributed to the B1g, two-phonon bands (marked as *), Eg, and A1g modes, respectively (Selman and Hassan, 2015; Swamy, 2008). Obviously, after doping with Si, the relative intensity of A1g, which is attributed to the TiO stretching vibration, increases, while the intensity of Eg, which is attributed to the OTiO symmetric stretching vibration, decreases (Selman and Hassan, 2015). This change is likely due to the formation of SiOTi groups and Ti3+ species in the TiO2 matrix (Su et al., 2008). These results further demonstrate the strong interaction between silicon and the TiO2 matrix. The UV–vis spectra (Fig. 2f) show that both the TNRs and STNRs have good absorption in the UV range and have absorption edges at 411 nm and 416 nm, respectively. This slight redshift could be due to the presence of more defects, as the result of Si doping."
8,Photoelectrochemical properties of STNR,"3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties of STNR Fig. 3 a compares typical chopped LSV plots of the samples doped with various molar ratios of Si. After doping with Si, the photocurrent responses are notably improved. The photocurrent density (J) of the TNR is ˜0.28 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl. For the STNR, the J value dramatically increases to ˜0.76 mA cm−2, indicating an improvement of ˜171%. The chronoamperometry (J-t) analysis indicates that both the TNR and STNR exhibit excellent stable photocurrent responses during long term operation (Fig. 3b), suggesting that Si doping does not affect the stability of the STNR. A long term photocurrent test has further demonstrated the superior photoelectrocatalytic stability of the STNR (Fig. S3). In the control experiments, the atomic ratio of Si to Si + Ti in the reaction solution was between 2% and 8% (Fig. S4). The results indicate that 5% Si doping is the optimal doping level. Therefore, the previously mentioned STNR were prepared with 5% Si in this work. Fig. 3c shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots for the TNR and STNR tested at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl. Both the TNR and STNR exhibit similar IPCE responses in range up to 423 nm, and the IPCE values of the STNR are consistently higher than those of the TNR samples. As a rule, the light penetration depth in TiO2 is ˜10 nm at λ = 300 nm and ˜1 μm at 380 nm, meaning that, under front illumination, electrons generated by photons with shorter wavelengths must travel longer distances to be collected at the FTO substrate (Regonini et al., 2015; Eagles, 1964). Therefore, both the TNR and STNR show a volcanic type IPCE behavior. The STNR has the highest IPCE value of 55.4% at 390 nm, while the IPCE value for the TNR is only 27.9%. The IPCE response edge of the TNR is ˜412 nm, while that of the STNR is ˜422 nm, which agrees with the UV–vis absorption results and indicates that the STNR can be excited by photons that have an energy greater than 2.94 eV. Clearly, the presence of Si is beneficial to electron transport in the STNR, because of the increased donor density of the Ti3+ species (Chen et al., 2011). In this case, the separation of photogenerated electrons/hole pairs in the STNR can be improved as the electrons can transfer to the counter electrode more efficiently, therefore the conversion efficiency of photon-to-current enhanced. Furthermore, the increased oxygen vacancy in STNR may further facilitate the separation of electrons/hole pairs because the defect sites enhance the trapping of holes. This result is consistent with the photocurrent densities shown in Fig. 3b, further demonstrating the important role of Si doping on enhancing the photoactivity of TiO2. Fig. 3d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves for the TNR and STNR. The smaller arc radius of the ESI curve for the STNR indicates that the STNR is less resistant to electron transfer in PEC applications. Fig. 3e shows the Mott-Schottky plots generated from the space charge capacitance values, which were measured at 1 kHz in dark conditions. The positive slopes indicate that the TNR and STNR are both n-type semiconductors. The carrier densities and flat band potentials (Efb ) of the TNR and STNR specimens could be estimated from the slopes and the intercepts of the Mott-Schottky plots, respectively (Su et al., 2013). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3e, the Efb of the STNRs is slightly shifted in the positive direction compared with the TNRs (−0.40 V vs −0.43 V). Additionally, the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot for the STNRs is substantially smaller than that for the TNRs (1.65). According to the equation, N d = - 2 e ε ε 0 d 1 / C 2 d V - 1 , where N d is the donor density (in cm−3), e is the elementary charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), ε is the relative dielectric constant of rutile TiO2 (˜170), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−14 F cm−1), C is the capacitance (in F cm−2), V is the applied potential (V) (Wang et al., 2011). The reduced slope of STNR suggests that silicon doping significantly improves the charge carrier density and enhances the charge separation in STNRs (1.26 × 1020 cm−3 for STNR and 5.03 × 1019 cm−3 for STNR). Generally, it is thought that metal element doping can be used to manipulate the density of photogenerated carriers and the carrier kinetics of the host material. Therefore, the enhanced PEC performance of STNRs can be attributed to the increased charge carrier density and facilitated charge transfer caused by silicon doping. To further demonstrate the improved electronic properties of the STNR, IMPS was conducted to measure the charge carrier transport times (τ tr) in the TNR and STNR, and the results are shown in Fig. 3f. The value of τ tr can be calculated by τ t r = 2 π f m I M P S - 1 , where fm (IMPS) is the frequency at the extremum of the IMPS plot (Krüger et al., 2003). According to the fm (IMPS), as shown in Fig. 3f, the calculated τ tr values of the TNRs and STNRs are 14.5 and 7.9 ms, respectively, which demonstrates that the photogenerated charges reached the back contact of the STNR more readily than that of the TNR. This result further suggests that silicon doping increases the charge carrier density and facilitates charge transfer in the STNR, which may cause its superior photoelectrochemical performance."
9,Construction of a HTPFC for solar hydrogen production and water treatment,"3.3 Construction of a HTPFC for solar hydrogen production and water treatment In a conventional PFC, the photogenerated electrons in the photoanode are transported to the cathode by the internal bias that is generated by the difference in the Fermi level between the electrodes (Li et al., 2019c). Apparently, a higher bias potential will always lead to higher photo-to-current efficiency for the photoelectrodes, according to the LSV tests. Therefore, the PFCs performance is highly dependent on the internal bias value. Adequate bias potential is necessary for efficient power output to treat water, and unfortunately, the bias potential generated by the difference in the Fermi level is limited by the conduction band position of the photoelectrode, which is always too small, i.e., less than 0.8 V (Seger et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2015). In this work, we developed a novel hybrid tandem PFC (HTPFC), which is composed of a front STNR, a rear silicon solar cell (SSC), and a Pt cathode (Fig. 4 a). The STNR and SSC were constructed as a monolithic photoanode, in which the STNR can be excited by high energy photons, i.e., >2.94 eV, to generate electron/hole pairs. The transmission light can excite the SSC to generate a bias potential, which can be adjusted using various PVCs. This facilitates electron transfer from the STNR to the Pt cathode, resulting in hydrogen generation. This means that a synergistic effect would occur between the STNR and the SSC. In this case, the HTPFC may possess a much higher internal bias than traditional PFCs, and, as a result, outstanding performance is expected for clean energy production and organic compound degradation. As shown in Fig. 4b, the STNR shows well transmission in the range of 420–1200 nm with luminousness greater than 31%, and the SSC has intense light absorption in the range of 400 to 850 nm. Therefore, the tandem, monolithic photoanode can exploit a wide range of wavelengths derived from sunlight because of the complementary light absorption of the STNR and SSC, which ensures that the HTPFC operates well under illumination only derived from sunlight. Furthermore, the compact, monolithic photoanode can facilitate the utilization of sunlight and the flexibility of the device, making it suitable for large-scale implementation as a stand-alone water-energy nexus system. The theoretical current density of a hybrid tandem system should be predicted by the intersection point of the current-voltage (J-V) curves derived from the photoelectrode and PVC. In this case, the J-V characterization of the PVC, which is adjustable, has an important effect on the system performance. Here, three kinds of SSCs with two (bi-cell), three (tri-cell), and four (tetra-cell) single-junction cells in series were tested. As shown in Fig. 4c, the combination of tetra-cell SSCs and STNR should obtain the optimized current density, ˜1.85 mA cm−2, at 2.2 V. Therefore, the abovementioned SSC used in this work is a tetra-cell. After the HTPFC was constructed, the J-V characterization is tested in 0.1 M K2SO4 under AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 4d). The HTPFC shows an open-circuit voltage (Voc ) of ˜2.17 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc ) of ˜1.82 mA cm−2, a maximum power density (Pmax) of ˜1.46 mW cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of ˜37%. This result indicates that the bias potential generated in the HTPFC is 2.17 V. To illustrate the advantageous of the proposed HTPFC, the traditional PFC composed of the STNR photoanode and Pt cathode (STNR-Pt) was also constructed for comparison (Fig. S5). Under similar conditions, the STNR-Pt shows a Voc of ˜0.38 V, a Jsc of ˜0.037 mA cm−2, a Pmax of ˜0.0012 mW cm−2, and a FF of ˜8.5% (Fig. S6a). Obviously, the bias potential of STNR-Pt is much lower than that of HTPFC, therefore causing a tiny Jsc and Pmax. Compared with the reported PFCs, the proposed PFC greatly enhances the electricity output performance (Dai et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019c; Zeng et al., 2018c; Zhang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2017; Seger et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2015; Lianos, 2011; Fujishima et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013). For example, Zhang et al. developed a PFC composed of a W-doped BiVO4 photoanode and a polyterthiophene photocathode, which achieved a Pmax of 0.082 mW cm−2 and outperformed other reported PFCs (Zhang et al., 2017). However, the obtained Pmax for the PFC proposed in this work is approximately 17.8 times that of the PFC reported by Zhang et al. This notable improvement in the electricity output efficiency could be attributed to the significantly enhanced internal bias potential from the rear SSC, as previously mentioned. This result suggests that the energy production and organic compound degradation under illumination by sunlight of the proposed HTPFC is superior compared to that of other PFCs reported in literatures. The organic compound degradation performance of the HTPFC was evaluated by degrading TC under artificial sunlight. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the photolysis of TC is ˜7.8% after 1.5 h of illumination. By using a single STNR film, the removal ratio of TC is ˜38.1%, demonstrating the photocatalytic effect of the STNR. For the STNR-Pt, the removal ratio of TC increases to 61.2%. This may occur due to the enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs in the STNR, which is driven by the internal bias of the Fermi level difference between the STNR and the Pt cathode. Under light illumination, the STNR is excited by photons and generates a lots of electron/hole pairs. As a result, its Fermi level is raised because TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, which is higher than the Fermi level of Pt cathode. Therefore, the electrons in STNR can be driven to the Pt cathode, which means more photogenerated holes can oxidize water or organics at the surface of STNR, instead of recombination with electrons in the single STNR. However, the proposed HTPFC has significantly improved TC degradation with a removal ratio of 94.3%, which can be attributed to the enhanced internal bias caused by the rear SSC. As shown in Fig. 4d, the potential of HTPFC is much higher than that of STNR-Pt and causes more efficient transfer of electrons to Pt cathode, therefore enhancing of the degradation of TC by photogenerated holes of STNR. This result demonstrates the advantages of the hybrid tandem configuration, which facilitates the charge transfer from the photoanode to the cathode, therefore enhancing the organic compound degradation. In the HTPFC, not only is the charge transfer improved but also the energy of the photogenerated electrons is increased due to the rear SSC. Therefore, compared with traditional PFCs, the generation of hydrogen may be more favorable in our proposed HTPFC. As shown in Fig. 5b, the average current density is ˜1.78 mA cm−2, and the average hydrogen generation rate is ˜28.8 μmol h−1 cm−2, which is about 46.5 times higher than that of the STNR-Pt (Fig. S6b). This result demonstrates that the HTPFC can not only efficiently purify wastewater but also simultaneously generation hydrogen using sunlight, and the rational design of HTPFC enables it possess much higher properties in clean energy production. The slightly decay in current density and hydrogen evolution should be due to the removal of organics, which may be trapping agents of holes. In the HTPFC, the organics can be degraded by the oxidizing species, such as photogenerated holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (h+ + H2O → OH + H+), from the STNR, while the electrons transfer to the Pt cathode for hydrogen production. As the organics gradually removed in the HTPFC, the capture of photogenerated holes in STNR may be weakened, therefore causing the slightly decay in current density and hydrogen evolution. The effect of the initial TC concentration on the removal rate and hydrogen production rate of the HTPFC is shown in Fig. S7. The degradation rate of TC decreases as the initial concentration of TC increases, while the hydrogen production rate gradually increases as the initial concentration of TC increases. For 5 mg L−1 TC, the removal ratio is ˜98.2%, and the hydrogen generation rate is ˜28.1 μmol h−1 cm−2. When degrading 20 mg L−1 TC, the removal ratio is only ˜78.3%, while the hydrogen generation rate slightly increases to ˜29.8 μmol h−1 cm−2. In the HTPFC, organic compounds can be oxidized by the photogenerated holes present in the STNR array, and hydrogen is generated by the electrons present in the Pt cathode. In addition, the holes can also oxidize the absorbed hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface into hydroxyl radicals. By increasing the initial TC concentration, the holes can be captured, improving the separation of the electron/hole pairs (Liu et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2015). Therefore, the generation of hydrogen can be enhanced. This result demonstrates that the degradation of organic compounds can facilitate the generation of hydrogen in the HTPFC. The effect of the supporting electrolyte on the performance of the HTPFC was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, without the use of a supporting electrolyte, the removal ratio of TC and the hydrogen generation rate are only 41.9% and 7.2 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively. When 0.01 M K2SO4 was added and used as the supporting electrolyte, the removal ratio increased to 74.5% and the hydrogen generation rate increased to 17.5 μmol h−1 cm−2. Then, the removal ratio and hydrogen generation rate are gradually improved as the concentration of K2SO4 increases; however, the increasing trend gradually diminishes. In a PFC, the concentration of the supporting electrolyte affects the resistance of the inner cell, which is an important factor in determining the charge transport in the cell (Li et al., 2019c; Lee et al., 2018; Fujishima et al., 2015). Fig. S8 shows the conductivities of the model wastewater with various K2SO4 concentrations, which indicates that the presence of K2SO4 dramatically reduces the solution resistance. Therefore, the organic compound degradation and hydrogen production are improved as the K2SO4 concentration increases, which may be due to the improved conductivity of the wastewater. Additionally, this result indicates that the HTPFC is a suitable technique for treating salty wastewater couple with electricity generation. The solution pH is also an important factor that affects the performance of the photocatalytic and electrochemical reactions (Lee et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2015; Lianos, 2011). Fig. 6c and d show the influence of the initial pH on the organic compound degradation and hydrogen production by the HTPFC, which was further evaluated using TC as a model pollutant. TC can be efficiently removed using the HTPFC in a wide range of pH values. The highest removal rate is obtained at a neutral condition (pH 7), and the removal ratios are similar (91.1%–94.3%) for pH values between 5–9. When the pH is decreased to 3, the removal ratio decreases to ˜80.5%. Additionally, the removal ratio decreases to ˜72.9% at an initial pH of 11. However, the effect of pH on hydrogen production is relatively moderate. The highest production rate of 29.5 μmol h−1 cm−2 is achieved at a pH of 5, and the lowest production rate of 25.4 μmol h−1 cm−2 is obtained at a pH of 11. As previously mentioned, the solution pH affects the redox reactions that occur at the electrodes. In the HTPFC, the generation of hydrogen can be improved at lower pH values, while the generation of •OH at the STNR array can be enhanced at higher pH values. These two opposite effects may be competitive when the pH changes, and the effects interact with each other. Therefore, the removal ratio decreases when the pH is too high or too low. The relatively moderate change in the hydrogen production rate could be due to the relatively high Voc (˜2.17 V) of the HTPFC, which ensures that the electrons have sufficient energy for hydrogen generation (H+/H2, −0.414 V vs standard hydrogen electrode at a pH of 7) (Fujishima et al., 2008). In general, these results demonstrate that the proposed HTPFC is highly flexible and adaptable when treating wastewaters with a wide range of pH values and salinities. In addition, the performance of HTPFC was further evaluated by degrading various refractory organic pollutants under simulated sunlight (Table 1 ). As can be seen, the H2 evolution rates for degrading colorless organics, such as ATZ (28.2 μmol h−1 cm−2), CIP (27.5 μmol h−1 cm−2) and etc., are higher than that for degrading organic dyes, such as MB (25.3 μmol h−1 cm−2) and MO (24.6 μmol h−1 cm−2), which should be due the reduced light transmission in the model wastewater. Nonetheless, the removal ratios of MB (96.5%) and MO (93.6%) are not affected, which should be attributed to their easy discolourization by the attack of hydroxyl radicals (Lianos, 2011). To clarify the degradation rates for various organics in the HTPFC, the reaction rate constant (k, fitted by pseudo first-order kinetics) is further provided, and they follow the order of MB > TC > MO > 2–4 D > 2-CP > CIP > ATZ. These different pseudo first-order kinetics reflect the difficulty level of these organics for being oxidized in the HTPFC because of their different chemical properties (Wu et al., 2015). To give more precise organic removal performance of the HTPFC, total organic carbon (TOC) removal ratio in each system was further calculated after 6 h operation. The result indicates that the HTPFC can removal organics efficiently, although the removal ratio of TOC is lower than that of the target contaminant, because their intermediate productions that have benzene ring structures are relatively stable and refractory to decompose. In general, these results further demonstrated the superior flexibility and adaptability of the HTPFC on producing hydrogen coupled with organics degradation. In practical applications, the long-term stability of the system is also important and determines the potential and cost of the system. As shown in Fig. 7 , the pollutant degradation and hydrogen production by the HTPFC remained stable by performing tests during six cycles. After this long-term test, clear SAED patterns and lattice fringes are observed by TEM (Fig. S9), which demonstrates the used STNR still possesses high crystallinity. The XPS survey (Fig. S10) indicates that the chemical states of Ti, O and Si are almost not changed during the long-term application. This result further demonstrates the outstanding physical and chemical stability of the STNR array. Furthermore, the good recyclability of the HTPFC may be due to the stability of the SSC, which is higher compared to conventional dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells. Therefore, HTPFCs have great potential for large-scale applications."
10,Mechanism of HTPFC for solar hydrogen production and water treatment,"3.4 Mechanism of HTPFC for solar hydrogen production and water treatment In this work, the HTPFC is composed of a front STNR, a rear SSC, and a Pt cathode. Under simulated sunlight illumination, the possible energy level diagram of the HTPFC is illustrated in Fig. 8 . As the STNR absorbs short wavelength photons to generate electron/hole pairs, the transmitting long wavelength photons can excite the rear SSC, which is constructed by four single-junction cells in series, to generate bias potential (Vph1 + Vph2 + Vph3 + Vph4). In this case, the transformation of photogenerated electrons in STNR to the Pt cathode can be accelerated and their energy for hydrogen evolution reaction (2H+ + 2e → H2) can be also raised under the bias potential of SSC, which is the above mentioned synergistic effect between the STNR and the SSC. However, the transformation of electrons in the traditional PFC of STNR-Pt is only based on the Fermi level difference between STNR and Pt, and their energy is not increased (Fig. S5b). Therefore, the charge separation and hydrogen generation in the HTPFC is much more efficient than the STNR-Pt, and also for the organic removal."
11,Conclusion,"In this work, a novel unassisted HTPFC was developed for solar hydrogen production from organic compound degradation. An STNR with vertically arranged silicon-doped TiO2 nanorods was prepared by a hydrothermal method. Si doping neither changed the single crystallinity nor varied the nanorod array morphology of the rutile TiO2 nanorods. The results indicate that silicon is distributed homogenously in the TiO2 matrix, which introduced abundant Ti3+ species. The STNR had a notably improved photocurrent density of ˜0.76 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is ˜271% of the photocurrent density of the TNR. The IPCE results further verified this improvement. The EIS and IMPS analyses showed that silicon doping improved the charge transport properties and the donor density of the STNR, which was attributed to its enhanced photoelectrochemical performance. Then, HTPFC was constructed by adhering SSC at the rear of the STNR as a monolithic photoanode, which showed significant improvement in degrading TC with a removal ratio of 94.3% after operation for 1.5 h and an average hydrogen generation rate of ˜28.8 μmol h−1 cm−2. In this HTPFC, the organic compound degradation and hydrogen generation interact synergistically, and it is highly flexible, adaptable, and stable in treating wastewater with a wide range of pH values and salinities, and also with various kinds of organics. The superior performance of the HTPFC may be due to the intriguing electronic properties, the stability of the STNR, and the enhanced light exploitation and internal bias caused by the rear SSC. This HTPFC provides novel and clear theoretical guidance for photoelectrode selection and exploits a new configuration of PFCs for hydrogen production from organic compound degradation."
