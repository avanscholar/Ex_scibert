0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production is becoming important in the renewable fuel field. It is one of the most promising technologies in the succession of fuels evolution as a carbon free energy carrier with several technical, socio-economic and environmental benefits to its credit (Das, 2009). There are at least three reasons why research on hydrogen is spreading throughout the world: • its production and utilization lead to low impacts on the environment (H2O as a by-product after use) • it can be obtained from renewable energy resources (water, organic refuse and solar energy) • the surplus can be stored and used when needed (e.g. when the demand for electric power is very high) (Almansoori and Shah, 2012) Hydrogen has a high-energy yield of 122 kJ g−1 as its lower heating value, which is 2.42 times greater than methane hydrocarbon fuel (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). However, hydrogen has the potential of becoming a significant part of the future global energy mix and especially of contributing to the decarbonisation of transport since it can be generated above all from primary energy sources (Urbaniec et al., 2010). At the moment, the main drawbacks concern the economic costs of hydrogen production. Hydrogen is seen as advantageous in terms of energy density (compared to accumulators) and refuelling speed (Miltner et al., 2010). Hydrogen is produced as biofuel from biomass in a sustainable way, therefore it is recognised as an important component of the fuel market for future low or no-carbon based energy systems (Urbaniec et al., 2010). Different processes are currently being investigated for the production of sustainable hydrogen as a biofuel, for example: dark anaerobic fermentation (Hung et al., 2011), photofermentation (Wang et al., 2011a) and electrohydrogenesis (Cheng and Logan, 2007). In this paper, the main focus is on hydrogen produced from a biomass by means of dark fermentation and electrohydrogenesis, which is a bioelectrochemical process that is performed in a reactor, which is called microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Among the wide variety of innovative biotechnologies for H2 production, the advantages of an integrated system that uses solar light and organic refuse are that it permits the production facilities to be integrated in the agricultural context. This embraces many system considerations: (1) the possible use of different types of wet feedstock and residues, (2) the possibility of producing hydrogen in small scale facilities, and (3) the opportunity of using the effluents as a fertilizer (Foglia et al., 2010). Biomass, whether considered as foodstuff or crops during use, produces organic waste with an energetic value. Furthermore, the reduction or the prevention of the amount of waste is generally accepted as the main priority of the Waste Framework Directive (Aranda Usón et al., 2012). One of the most important contributions to sustainable development could be energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW) and organic waste as a source of renewable energy. To this end, the production of renewable energy from waste and biomass resources is one of the main strategies in the new energy framework towards sustainability, because it contrasts the systematic increases of refuse produced by society (Robèrt et al., 2002). The recovery of energy from the residual fraction has an additional function of providing valuable by-products, such as heat, power and biofuels (Aranda Usón et al., 2012). From the stoichiometric point of view, and considering the low heating value of glucose, 3750 kcal kg−1, 1 kg of sugar could either produce approximately 4.42 kWh of energy or about 13∙106 Coulombs (C) of electricity (C = n∙F∙m gl where n is the electrons available from one mol of glucose, F is the Faraday constant and m gl, is the number of moles present in 1 kg of glucose). If one considers the production of ethanol from the so-called 1st generation feedstock (World Watch Institute, 2007), it is possible to obtain 0.37 L kg−1 (Pimentel and Patzek, 2005) or 0.7–0.9 standard m3 of biogas with about 60% of methane with the current biotechnologies processes (Vindis et al., 2008). Considering that glucose is not suitable for energy production for cost reasons and that the use of 1st generation feedstocks is at the centre of “food” vs “fuel” (F vs. F) debate in which ethanol has been addressed by many authors, as the reason for increases in food prices, especially in the parts of the world in which food is mainly based on grain consumption (Perrin, 2008), other feedstocks need to be contemplated. In order to prevent the F vs. F conflict, a 2nd generation feedstock, mainly constituted by cellulose and lignin structures as residues from either crop harvesting or organic waste, represents a great opportunity. Perlack et al. (2005) estimated that about 175 million tons of 2nd generation dry feedstock could be produced per year in the U.S. If one considers the productivity of 0.4 L kg−1 of ethanol from a cellulosic material (Iogen Corporation, 2011), a potential of 70 Mm3 of ethanol or 74 MNm3 of biomethane per year, are rough estimations of the energy that could be obtained from agricultural and organic refuse. In the above scenario, the most easily available biomasses are domestic wastewater and refuse from local fruit and vegetable markets, owing to the existing collection networks (Rabaey, 2005). These kinds of refuse require the use of a low temperature technology, due to their high water content, such as Anaerobic Digestion (AD) to produce hydrogen and methane. During hydrogen production, a high chemical energy remains occluded in the metabolites at the end of acidogenic fermentation. The integration of anaerobic H2 production from biowaste increases the energy value of the liquid metabolites (VFAs and others), which accompany the H2 production and leads to the achievement of the energy sustainability of the whole process. The use of organic refuse and the valorisation of H2-end products could be a promising technology in the perspective of developing cost-effective H2 generators. Hydrogen can be produced from the anaerobic bacteria that support the conversion of a carbohydrate-rich biomass to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and organic acids (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2010). However, during the H2 fermentation of glucose, from a thermodynamic point of view and considering a total conversion of glucose into carbonic acids, only 1/3 of the available energy is converted into H2, while the other 2/3 remains occluded in the form of volatile fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, acetate, valerate etc.) and solvents (ethanol, butanol and acetone), thus reducing the overall hydrogen yields (Das, 2009). The application of the net energy analysis confirms that the anaerobic H2 technology is not energetically sustainable (Ruggeri et al., 2010; Tommasi, 2011). The way to increase the overall energy recovered from the raw biomaterial used in a H2 production process via fermentation is to extract the remaining bioenergy embedded in the liquid metabolites produced at the end of the acetogenic step. The energy can be extracted in the form of methane, directly as electricity, or as additional H2, depending on the used technology (Tommasi and Ruggeri, 2011). Focussing on hydrogen production, external energy must be supplied to reach the favourable thermodynamic conditions in order to recover more hydrogen from these fermentation end products (Wang et al., 2011b). Bioelectrochemical methods that use MEC for hydrogen production are currently being investigated. An MEC device is an electrochemical device in which microorganisms oxidize organic material at the anode, and produce carbon dioxide (CO2), electrons (e−) and protons (H+) (Wrana et al., 2010). Electrons are shuttled from one electrode to the other one through an external electric circuit, while protons diffuse through the electrolyte to the cathode; for this purpose, care must be taken to prevent any O2 insertion in order to permit the reduction of protons via electrons to produce H2. This is not a spontaneous reaction. Consequently, in order to drive electrons from the anode to the cathode, energy from an external power source must be applied to the cell (Wrana et al., 2010). The electrical voltage needed in an MEC (0.114 V in theory, >0.2 V in practice) is significantly lower than the theoretical voltage needed for water electrolysis, that is 1.8 V in practise (Logan et al., 2008). Cheng and Logan (2007) demonstrated the direct production of hydrogen in an MEC using different acetogenic fermentative products, including acetate, butyrate and propionate. A more recent work has examined the use of two-stage processes, with the first stage producing hydrogen in a fermentation reactor from molasse wastewater (Lu et al., 2009), lignocelluloses or celluloses (Lalaurette et al., 2009), and the second stage consisting of a further hydrogen recovery from the fermentation effluent using the bioprocess in an MEC. This paper concerns the experimental tests of two different biotechnological routes to increase the energy value of metabolic products of acetogenic fermentation at the end of H2 production. Thus, the second tested stages were: 1- anaerobic digestion to mainly produce methane and 2- additional H2 gas production in an MEC device. The main objective was to achieve a higher energy recovery value by extracting as much of the chemical energy embedded in the waste materials as possible and, at the same time, to decrease the quantity of waste materials to be managed. The purpose of the implementation of an eco-efficient process is to obtain economic benefits and reduce environmental impacts, through a by-product recovery, e.g. carbonic acids, and through a reduction in both the water consumption and organic load. Adopting an environmental management option (Catarino et al., 2007; Zobel and Burman, 2004), such as a cleaner disposal of wastes, is an important choice because of the growth in quantities of waste, in spite of waste prevention and other cleaner effort policies. The prevention of waste streams through waste minimisation is therefore an attractive strategy (Ekvall, 2005). The two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) method consists of the separation of the natural ecology and metabolism of an anaerobic bacteria consortium into two distinct classes: this permits the energy efficiency of the whole process, H2 forming bacteria and CH4 forming bacteria, to be optimized. In the first stage, acid pH and short Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) conditions are able to separate the two bacterial species and induce H2 production; in the second one, neutral pH and higher HRT are able to promote methanogenesis (CH4 production). A Bio Electrochemically Assisted Microbial Reactor (BEAMR) or easily MEC represents the newest approach for H2 generation from biomass using bacteria: it permits hydrogen gas and other reduced products to be generated from organic electron donors. The terms “electrochemically” and “assisted” are used in this process and therefore circumvent thermodynamic constraints that normally render the generation of compounds such as unlikely hydrogen (Clauwaert, 2009). An MEC functions like a normal electrolysis cell, but in this case the source of electrons is an organic substrate and bacteria are the catalysts for H2 production. Acetate and municipal or agro-industrial wastewater streams are some examples of electron donors. The separation between the anode and cathode is accomplished adopting an ion selective membrane. Ion selective membranes are used to obtain an almost pure cathodic hydrogen gas. However, ion selective membranes give rise to higher ohmic voltage losses in the cell and a pH gradient over the membrane, resulting in a higher applied voltage for H2 production (Call and Logan, 2008)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Two-stage process (H2 + CH4),"2.1 Two-stage process (H2 + CH4) A test was conducted at 35 °C to first produce H2 from glucose (acidogenesis step) and then biogas (methanogenesis step) from the VFAs produced in the first step. The test was conducted in a stirred-batch reactor, STR, as shown in Fig. 1 (Minifors HT, Switzerland), with 2 litres as the working volume under anaerobic conditions, obtained by sparging nitrogen gas at the beginning of the fermentation and with a 100 rpm stirring operation. The initial glucose concentration was 60 g L−1 and the medium had the same macro and micro nutrient composition as that reported by Fang et al. (2006). The microflora seed used as the inoculum (10% w/w) was obtained from an anaerobic digested sludge, derived from the Turin municipal wastewater treatment plant (SMAT S.p.A.). In the first step (acidogenesis), the inoculum was pre-treated with 1 N HCl for 24 h at pH 3 in order to inhibit the methanogenic activity, as reported by Chen et al. (2002), Mu et al. (2006) and Tommasi et al. (2008). An untreated inoculum was used for the second methanogenic step. The gas evolution was constantly evaluated using a volumetric gas counter (Milligas counter, Ritter) as was the pH, Redox Potential (ROP) and temperature, which were logged through a data acquisition system (Iris, Infors HT) (Fig. 1). Gas composition was determined through an off-line gas chromatographic analysis (Varian, CP 4900) with the gas being sampled at different time intervals. pH was measured using a pH metre (Infors, AG Switzerland); the Red-Ox Potential (ROP) was measured by means of a Pt4805-DXK-S8/120 electrode (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). In order to evaluate the energy sustainability of the two-stage (H2 + CH4) AD technology, the Energy Return On Investment (EROI) and the Energy Payback Time (EPT) were considered for a bioreactor working at a temperature of 35 °C throughout the whole year. The Global Energy Requirement (GER) for the construction of the materials was evaluated using the specific GER data from literature for a steel reactor covered with insulating polystyrene foam, from a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective (Ruggeri et al., 2011). EROI and EPT were evaluated under the following assumptions: the plant has a production life of 20 years, the energy required for its construction is increased by a factor of 50% in order to take into account the energy spent for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance work in order to have the plant in the right functional conditions, e.g. the substitution of mechanical parts (pumps, valves etc.)."
3,Production of H2 from sodium acetate by means of an MEC,"2.2 Production of H2 from sodium acetate by means of an MEC The second biological process tested to recovery energy was the production of H2 by means of an MEC using a solution of sodium acetate as the substrate. Sodium acetate was used to represent the metabolite solution at the end of the acidogenic phase in H2 production in which acetate is the highest concentration (Ruggeri et al., 2010). The MEC device was made up of two Plexiglas frames (8×8×2 cm3 per frame). The total reactor volume = 0.256 L is the sum of the total anodic (A) and cathodic (C) compartment volumes, as shown in Fig. 2 . Two frames, A and C, were filled completely with granular graphite and connected to the external electric circuit with a graphite rod (5 mm diameter, Morgan, Belgium). A CEM (Cation Exchange Membrane Ultrex CMI7000, Membranes International Inc.) was used to separate the anode from the cathode. The medium contained 6 g L−1∙Na2HPO4∙2H2O, 3 g L−1KH2PO4, 0.2 g L−1 MgSO4∙7H2O, 0.1 g L−1 NH4Cl, 0.0146 g L−1 CaCl2 and trace elements, as described in Clauwaert and Verstraete (2008). One g of sodium acetate (C2H3O2 Na) was fed, in discontinuous mode, to the anodic frame upon depletion. Peristaltic pumps (Watson Marlow) were used to circulate the anodic and cathodic liquid at a flow rate of 6 L d−1. The external anodic compartment vessel was inoculated with 10 mL of anaerobic sludge taken from an anode of a different running MEC. The test was performed at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). A power supply was used to obtain an applied voltage of 0.8 ± 0.02 V. The current was measured by placing a 1.07 Ω resistor in the electrical circuit. A data acquisition unit (HP 34970A, Agilent, USA) was used to record the voltage difference and current every minute. The volume of gas was measured using a water-replacement method, while the composition of the produced gas was analyzed with an Intersmat IGC 120 MB gas chromatograph and a H2 sensor (OPUS, Zellweger Analytics, U.K.)."
4,Results,
5,Two-stage process (H2 + CH4),"3.1 Two-stage process (H2 + CH4) The test carried out on glucose to produce energy in the form of H2 (from the first acidogenic stage) and methane from the following second methanogenic stage is reported in Fig. 3 . The results show that, after H2 production, the residual VFAs were successfully used to produce a suitable quantity of biogas, with approximately 80% v/v of methane as the mean value. It is possible to see, in Fig. 3(b), that the pH, after a controlled step at pH 5.2 in which H2 was produced, increases from 5.2 to 5.8 and, after this, again increases “naturally” towards the neutral value. This strategy was adopted in order to permit the microorganisms to gently adapt to the new environment. When the pH reached a value of 7.2, an inoculum, constituted by mixed methanogens, was added. The pH remained at this value for a long period (two weeks), which corresponds approximately to the length of the methanogenesis lag phase. After about 11 or 12 days of lag phase, the gas evolution restarted and a small quantity of CH4 was detected. In the following 23 or 24 days, the concentration of CH4 increased and reached a maximum concentration of 83%. The Red-Ox Potential (ROP) in the methane lag phase slowly increased towards less reductive values, while it always remained constant at very reductive values during methane evolution (about −520 mV). The energy efficiency of the H2 production by means of AD is very low, 11.4%, as reported in Table 1 , because parts of the initial energy contained in the carbon source remains in the VFAs. The second methanogenic stage greatly increased the overall energy efficiency to a value of 55.1%. The experimental results show that two-stage AD gives a higher yield of 55.1% than the 11.47% of a standard AD for biohydrogen production. It is important to point out that during H2 production, when the pH was controlled by an external control loop that was able to add 2 N NaOH to remain at a 5.2 value, the methane concentration in the produced gas was undetectable while the H2 concentration during the methane evolution in the gas was at a very low value (less than 0.5% v/v). This experimental evidence confirms the efficacy of this method in selecting different microorganism consortium species to conduct a two-stage AD process for H2 and CH4 production. Fig. 4 (a) reports the evaluation of EROI vs diameter of the reactor applying the scale-up procedure reported in Tommasi (2011) and Ruggeri et al. (2010). A technology is sustainable if EROI is higher than 1: this occurs for the present study for larger reactor diameters than 1 m. When the diameter increases, EROI increases linearly. For larger diameters than 2 m, the values are of the same order of those of different technologies using alternative energy sources. The evaluation of the EPT is reported in Fig. 4b. This parameter is very important in the evaluation of the “first useful energy unit”. The EPT for diameters of less than 4 m is over 1 year and it diminishes more and more as the diameters become larger. EPT is expressed in years and indicates the time required by a process to produce an amount of energy equal to the invested one: all the produced energy since EPT is reached is useful energy. In order to have an idea of the different energies that play a role in an energy technology, such as the AD analyzed in this paper, Fig. 5 reports the global energy balance of the two-stage AD conducted at 35 °C (10 cycles/years) considering D = 4 m and EPT = 1, a life time of the reactor of 20 years. The biological step is the controlling step of the technology and, with the current knowledge; it is able to “extract” only ∼61% of the energy embedded in glucose. It is necessary to consider the useful energy, which is less than one-tenth of the initial energy embedded in glucose, e.g. the real energy able to sustain civilization. This is the result of embracing a global vision of the technology from an LCA perspective i.e. considering the energy amortization of the materials used to construct the plant and the chemicals necessary to run it, which have a great influence on the process, that is about 35%. The application of an energy sustainability criterion, such as EROI or EPT, suggests working with higher diameters in order to increase the EROI and to lower the EPT; this strategy needs to be applied for each waste stream that has to be treated."
6,Production of H2 from acetate by means of an MEC,"3.2 Production of H2 from acetate by means of an MEC Sodium acetate, as the reduced substrate, was oxidized in the bioanode by the microorganisms while H2 was electrochemically produced in the cathode. The following half reactions represent the main phenomena that occur: - Anode: CH3COO Na → Na+ + CH3COO− CH3COO− + H2O → CH3COOH + OH− CH3COOH + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ - Cathode: 8H+ + 8e− → 4H2 From Fig. 6 , it can be seen that after 2 days of lag phase the electron moles (Coulombs) increase sharply, and the cumulative H2 production follows the same trend. This is due to the direct proportionality between the Coulombs and hydrogen. Two different terms were used to evaluate the efficiency of the MEC device. The first concerns the evaluation of the efficiency at the anode used to generate the available electrons and protons to be converted into hydrogen (Cook and Schlegel, 1978). In order to estimate this, the quantity (expressed as the number of moles) of the consumed sodium acetate was recorded (as 0.0039 mol) and considering that 0.21 L of H2 was recorded (Fig. 6), a yield (Y) of 2.41 mol H 2 / mol sodium acetate was obtained. In addition to considering that, from the anodic reactions, 1 mol of sodium acetate theoretically produces 4 mol of H2, the following efficiency results: μ = Y H 2 , actual / Y H 2 , theoretical = 2.41 / 4 = 60.25 % The second efficiency regards the “cathodic efficiency” (ξ), which considers the quantity of electrons converted into hydrogen at the cathode, with reference to the electrons flowing in the electrical circuit: ξ = n H 2 , recovered / n H 2 , electrically available The numerator is equal to 9.4 · 10 − 3 mol H 2 and is obtained converting 0.21 L at standard conditions, while the denominator is the equivalent mol of hydrogen to the circulating current during the test (∼1950 Coulombs from Fig. 6). Therefore, the denominator is: n H 2 , electrically available = ∑ I Δ t / F · 2 = 1950 / 96485 · 2 = 0.010 where I is the current (A), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1 e−) and 2 is the number of electrons present in 1 mol of hydrogen. The ∑ I ( t ) / 96,485 C mol − 1 ratio gives the electron recovery mol. Finally, the cathodic efficiency is: ξ = 9.4 · 10 − 3 / 0.010 = 94 % The anode efficiency, calculated as H2 recovery through the above calculation was 60.3%. The recovered H2 based on the amount of substrate consumed demonstrates that sodium acetate is a good electron donor substrate and it is a good representative of acetic acid as the main VFAs. The loss of ∼40% of electrons at the anode means that the biological system and the anode materials need to be optimized in order to recover a higher quantity of electrons. The Yield, Y H 2 , reported in Table 2 , is the ratio between the hydrogen mol produced at the cathode of the MEC and the acetate mol consumed at the anode. The cathodic efficiency ξ is very high (∼94%); the volume of H2 obtained on the theoretical one, as electrons recorded by acquisition data unit means that only 6% of the electrons are not converted to H2, because no microorganism was present at the cathode and the cathode reaction is only of a chemical nature. The cation exchange membrane is useful to achieve a high flux of H+ protons from the anode to the cathode. MEC with a CEM resulted in production of pure hydrogen gas in the cathode (Rozendal et al., 2007) and they avoid the direct cross-over conversion of the organic substrate by aerobic microorganisms, which lower the efficiency (Liu and Logan, 2004). However CEM causes a higher ohmic cell resistance and the build-up of a pH gradient across the membrane (Clauwaert and Verstraete, 2008; Clauwaert, 2009 and Rozendal et al., 2006) which leads to an alkalinization effect that becomes more dominant in poorly buffered solutions. When a CEM membrane is omitted from the MEC, methanogenesis can easily become dominant (results not reported) and a mixture of gas, composed of carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas and methane, is produced. Hydrogen production through microbial electrolysis can be considered a renewable technology, as opposed to reforming of fossil fuels, if electricity from the renewable technology is used to operate the electrolyser (Miltner et al., 2010)."
7,Conclusion,"In this paper, two different biological paths to further increase the overall balance of bioenergy in biohydrogen technology production have been presented: the conventional anaerobic digestion and a novel microbial electrolysis cell fed with sodium acetate, after a first H2 production step by means of the AD. Results have shown that even more H2 can be extracted from VFAs such as acetic acid from an MEC, working at ambient temperature, or alternatively, biogas from the second AD unit. Therefore, a second biogas step and an MEC process could be used as a way of exploiting residual fatty acids, considering that the net energy balance of biological H2 production via dark fermentation alone is not always positive. Biomass based hydrogen production technologies are still being developed, hence only a few plants have been constructed and new few operation data are available. It is therefore difficult for policy makers to identify promising technologies or the advantages and disadvantages of each technology (Miltner et al., 2010). This work was aimed at investigating the feasibility of some eco-efficiency alternatives, which, from the authors’ point of view, are as technologically viable as those shown (methanation and electrogenic hydrogen production) in order to increase the global energy recovered from a biomass. Other studies still need to be conducted on order to evaluate, through an LCA, the most feasible method from both the environmental and energy point of view."
