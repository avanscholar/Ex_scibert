0,Introduction,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most significant vegetables and is a model species around the world. Micro-Tom (MT), as a dwarf tomato cultivar, has the following characteristics: rapid growth, small size, easy transformation, short life cycle for fruit harvest and has been considered a well-suited model system for study (Gonzalez et al., 2015). Hydrogen gas (H2), as well as being a novel signaling molecule, is also involved in plant growth and development. Zhu et al. (2017) reported that H2 increased the relative water content, rooting-related enzymes and metabolic constituents and synchronously maintained cell membrane integrity to promote adventitious root development in cucumber. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2018a) showed that H2 could significantly improve plant height, stem diameter, fresh weight and leaf area in cucumber seedlings. In addition, H2 plays a crucial role in the preservation of fruits and cut flowers. HRW treatment delayed the post-harvest ripening and senescence of kiwifruit by modulating antioxidant defense (Hu et al., 2014). The application of H2 also improved the vase life and post-harvest quality of cut lily and rose flowers (Ren et al., 2017). Furthermore, H2 might mediate plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Ample evidence indicates that H2 plays multiple biological roles in various plant defences, particularly in response to abiotic stress, such as drought (Su et al., 2018), cadmium (Cui et al., 2013), salt (Xie et al., 2012) and paraquat exposure (Jin et al., 2013). To date, the roles of H2 in drought stress resistance in plants, including in cucumber (Chen et al., 2017a), alfalfa (Su et al., 2018) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Xie et al., 2014), have been reported. A previous report suggested that H2 enhanced plant tolerance by modulating the signaling system for haem oxygenase-1 (Jin et al., 2013). H2 participates in biotic stress resistance by mediating the expression of antioxidant-related and H2 production-related genes (Li et al., 2018a). In addition, H2 interacts with other molecules. For example, H2 interacts with nitric oxide (NO) to ameliorate cadmium (Cd) stress in Brassica campestris seedlings (Su et al., 2019). Carbon monoxide (CO) might be involved in H2-induced adventitious root formation in cucumber under drought stress and alleviates oxidative damage (Chen et al., 2017a; Deng et al., 2019). Furthermore, H2 might also interact with other phytohormones. For example, Zeng et al. (2013) indicated that H2 production was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). H2 prolonged the shelf life of kiwifruit by reducing ethylene biosynthesis (Hu et al., 2018). ABA plays a vital role in plant developmental processes, including seed dormancy, root development and seedling development (Sharipova et al., 2016). Furthermore, ABA, as an acknowledged stress factor, is involved in various responses to abiotic stress, including drought, salt and cold (Ben-Ari, 2012). Moreover, the application of exogenous ABA is a promising method to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress and increase crop production. Liu et al. (2019) showed that the application of ABA could improve the growth status of all transgenic Arabidopsis plants under drought stress. In addition, ABA may interact with other molecules and phytohormones to respond to drought stress. ABA improved the drought tolerance of triploid bermudagrass and participated in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- and NO-induced antioxidant enzyme activities (Lu et al., 2009). ABA combined with NO protected against PEG-induced drought stress in genotypes of Brassica juncea (Sahay et al., 2019). Furthermore, Chen et al. (2020) revealed that ABA could induce the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in guard cells and that H2S, in turn, positively regulated ABA signaling. Moreover, ABA and JA were involved in drought priming-induced drought tolerance in wheat, in which JA acted upstream of ABA (Wang et al., 2020). Wilmowicz et al. (2020) found that ABA and ethylene (ET) could regulate nodules in response to drought in yellow lupine. Currently, drought stress seriously influences the production and quality of tomatoes. As mentioned above, both ABA and H2 are involved in increasing plant drought tolerance. Jin et al. (2016) demonstrated that H2 might be involved in the ABA-dependent drought response in Medicago sativa and observed that hydrogenase activity and H2 production were remarkably induced by drought stress and ABA. In Arabidopsis, H2-regulated stomatal movement is involved in the ABA signaling cascade (Xie et al., 2014). However, the relationship and the mechanisms between ABA and H2 in ameliorating plant drought stress remain elusive. Therefore, to test this speculation, “Micro-Tom” tomatoes were used to investigate the involvement of ABA in H2-enhanced drought resistance in tomato seedlings."
1,Material and methods,
2,Plant materials and growth conditions,"2.1 Plant materials and growth conditions Tomato seeds (Solanum lycopersicum ‘‘Micro-Tom’’) were obtained from PanAmerican Seed, West Chicago, IL, USA. Uniform seeds were surface-sterilized in 5% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and then soaked in warm water for 6 h. The seeds were germinated on filter paper in petri dishes containing sterile distilled water under the conditions of 25 ± 2 °C and 20 ± 2 °C, with a light intensity of 200 μmol m−2 s−1 and a 14-h photoperiod. Germinated seedlings were transferred into conical flasks containing 50% Hoagland's nutrition solution, allowed to grow for one week, transferred into 100% Hoagland's nutrition solution and then allowed to grow for two weeks. Hoagland's nutrition solution was replenished every three days, and approximately 85 mL of the solution was applied in a conical flask. After growing for approximately one month (four-leaf stage), the seedlings were treated with various chemicals under the same temperature and photoperiod conditions for another six days. Finally, the seedlings from the various treatments were used in the following study."
3,"Treatments of seedlings, chemicals","2.2 Treatments of seedlings, chemicals The seedlings were cultivated with various concentrations of hydrogen-rich water (HRW; 0, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%; v/v) and abscisic acid (ABA; 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM). Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000, Shanghai Zhanyun Chemicals Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used to simulate drought resistance, at a concentration of 15% (w/v, Khanzada et al., 2020). The following chemicals were the main part of the study and were added alone or together with 75% HRW or 150 µM ABA: control (not exposed to drought stress and not treated with HRW or ABA); PEG (exposed to drought stress and not treated with ABA or HRW); PEG + HRW (exposed to drought stress and treated with 75% HRW); PEG + ABA (exposed to drought stress and treated with 150 μM ABA); PEG + HRW + ABA (exposed to drought stress and treated with 75% HRW and 150 μM ABA); PEG + HRW + fluridone (FLU, a synthetic inhibitor of ABA) (exposed to drought stress and treated with 75% HRW and 50 µM FLU); and FLU (only treated with FLU). The concentration of these chemicals was selected based on our pre-experiments."
4,Method for the preparation of hydrogen-rich water,"2.3 Method for the preparation of hydrogen-rich water An H2 gas generator (QL-300, Saikesaisi Hydrogen Energy Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) was used to produce H2. H2 was bubbled into 1.0 L of distilled water at a rate of 300 mL min−1 for 30 min until 100% saturation. Under our experimental conditions, the H2 concentration in the freshly prepared HRW, which was measured with a “dissolved hydrogen portable meter” (Trustlex Co., Led, ENH-1000, Japan), was 0.45 mM."
5,Biometric parameters,2.4 Biometric parameters The plant height was directly measured from the basal part to the growing pointusing a straightedge. The stem diameter was measured by a Vernier caliper. Three technical replicates were assayed for each treatment.
6,Root activity,"2.5 Root activity To investigate the effect of HRW on the roots of tomato seedlings under drought stress, root activity was measured by using the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride method (Tang et al., 2016). Briefly, 0.5 g of fresh root samples was cut into 2 cm sections and incubated for 1 h with a mixture of 5 mL 0.4% (w/v) TTC and 5 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 °C. The experiment was terminated by adding 2 mL of 1 M H2SO4. Roots were dried with filter paper, and ethyl acetate extraction was performed. The absorbance of the extract at 485 nm was recorded. In addition, a calibration curve was drawn."
7,Gas exchange parameters,"2.6 Gas exchange parameters Photosynthetic parameters were assayed between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. at 25 °C on cloudless days. The transpiration rate (E), net photosynthetic rate (PN) and stomatal conductance (gs) were measured from fully expanded leaves, which were usually the third mature leaves. The measurements were completed by the CIRAS-2 Portable Photosynthesis System (PP System, USA)."
8,Abscisic acid,"2.7 Abscisic acid ABA extraction was determined using previously reported methods with slight modifications (Song et al., 2008). Briefly, tomato seedling leaves (1 g) were ground with a mortar and pestle in 3 mL of cooled 80% (v/v) methanol solution. Then, after incubation for 12 h at 4 °C, the extract was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant liquid was extracted twice, and the aqueous phase was collected. The solution sample was eluted through Sep-Pak C18 columns to remove polar compounds and prewashed with methyl alcohol. The supernatant was collected and dried in a vacuum at 40 °C (Wang et al., 2016). Then, the supernatants were dissolved in methyl alcohol at a constant volume, a microporous membrane (0.22 μM) was established to filter the products and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out."
9,Antioxidant enzyme activity,"2.8 Antioxidant enzyme activity The supernatant liquid used for assays of enzyme activity was prepared according to the method described by Rai et al. (2013) with slight modification. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined by measuring its capacity to inhibit the photochemical reduction of nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT). One unit of SOD (U) was defined as the amount of crude enzyme extract required to inhibit the reduction rate of NBT by 50%. Catalase (CAT) activity was assayed according to the method of Al-aghabary and Shi (2005) with some modification. CAT activity was determined based on the disappearance of H2O2 by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% H2O2 and 0.1 mL of enzyme extract in a 3 mL volume. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was assayed by monitoring the rate of ascorbate oxidation at 290 nm. The assay mixture contained 5 mM AsA, 20 mM H2O2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mL of enzyme extract in a 3 mL volume."
10,Enzymatic activities,"2.9 Enzymatic activities Tomato seedling leaves (0.5 g) were added to 9 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and the homogenate was fully mixed. Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant liquid was used to determine the activity of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO). The sample was analyzed using the Plant ZEP ELISA Kit, Plant NCED ELISA Kit and Plant AAO ELISA Kit (AndyGene Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
11,Gene expression,"2.10 Gene expression Total RNA was extracted using the Mini BEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Nanodrop spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis were employed to assess RNA purity and quality. First-strand cDNA was synthesized according to the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit manual (TaKaRa, China). The gene-specific primers used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) were designed using Primer3Plus software, and are shown in Table 1 . Quantitative RT–PCR was performed using SYBR Green SuperReal qPCR PreMix (Tiangen, China). The PCR reactions were performed under the following conditions: 5 min 95 °C followed by 1 min 95 °C, 40 s 56 °C and then 90 s 72 °C for 50 cycles, 10 min 72 °C. The tomato actin gene was selected as an internal control. The relative transcription level of each gene was determined using the 2–ΔΔct method."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis SPSS 22.0 software was used for statistical analysis. All experiments included three independent replicates, and ten seedlings were taken per replication. The results are shown as the means with standard errors and were compared by Duncan's multiple range test at the P < 0.05 level."
13,Results,
14,Effects of H2 on tomato seedlings under drought stress,"3.1 Effects of H2 on tomato seedlings under drought stress Treatment with PEG significantly inhibited the growth of tomato seedlings compared with that of the control; Figs. 1–2 are parts of the pre-experiments. After four days of treatment, PEG + 50% and PEG + 75% HRW significantly increased plant height in comparison to PEG alone (Fig. 1A). Among them, the highest plant height was observed in the tomato seedlings treated with PEG + 75% HRW on Day 6 (Fig. 1A). Compared with PEG, PEG + 25%, PEG + 50% and PEG + 100% HRW treatments, the stem diameter was remarkably enhanced by the control and the PEG + 75% HRW treatments on Days 4 and 6 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the root activity in PEG treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control. Furthermore, the PEG + 75% HRW treatment displayed the highest root activity among the various PEG + HRW treatments, at 45% higher than that of the PEG treatment on Day 6 (Fig. 1C). The tomato seedling leaves showed wilting and curling under drought stress, whereas the PEG +75% HRW treatments significantly alleviated drought stress symptoms (Fig. 1D). Thus, these results revealed that 75% HRW was the optimal concentration for improving drought tolerance in tomato seedling growth and was utilized for further study."
15,Effects of ABA on tomato seedlings under drought stress,"3.2 Effects of ABA on tomato seedlings under drought stress Fig. 2 shows that the plant height, stem diameter and root activity in the PEG treatment were markedly lower than those of the control. Compared with PEG treatment, PEG + 100 μM ABA and PEG + 150 μM ABA treatments markedly increased plant height and stem diameter, and 150 μM ABA resulted in a greater increase in alleviated drought stress (Fig. 2A and 2B). Among various concentrations of ABA treatments, the maximum plant height and stem diameter were observed in the PEG + 150 μM ABA treatment. Furthermore, in comparison with PEG treatment, PEG + 150 μM ABA significantly increased root activity on Day 6, although the other ABA treatments had no significant effects (Fig. 2C and 2D). Compared with PEG treatment, the root activity in 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM ABA-treated tomato seedlings on Day 6 increased by 10%, 23%, 70% and 39%, respectively. Therefore, 150 μM ABA was used to enhance drought tolerance in the subsequent experiments."
16,"Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on plant height, stem diameter and root activity under drought stress","3.3 Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on plant height, stem diameter and root activity under drought stress Compared with PEG treatment, the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments significantly increased plant height and stem diameter (Fig. 3 A and 3B), and the plant height and stem diameter in the PEG + HRW + ABA treatment group were 9% and 33% higher, respectively, compared to those in PEG treatment group. Furthermore, PEG + HRW + FLU treatment resulted in lower plant height and stem diameter than PEG + HRW treatment, indicating that FLU blocked the promotion of HRW in the growth of tomato seedlings under drought stress (Fig. 3A, 3B and 3D). The promotive roles of HRW in root activity under drought stress were also largely prevented by the simultaneous presence of FLU (Fig. 3C and 3D). Therefore, the involvement of ABA in H2-enhanced drought resistance in tomato seedlings was demonstrated. In comparison with the control, FLU treatment significantly reduced plant height and root activity (Fig. 3A and 3C)."
17,"Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on photosynthesis under drought stress","3.4 Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on photosynthesis under drought stress As shown in Fig. 4 , PEG treatment notably decreased the gas exchange parameters. Furthermore, the application of HRW or ABA reversed the inhibitory effects of PEG. Compared with PEG treatment, the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments increased E, gs and PN (Fig. 4B, 4C and 4D). The gs in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments were 53%, 53%, and 71% higher, respectively, than those in PEG treatment (Fig. 4C). Compared with PEG + HRW treatment, PEG + HRW + FLU treatment resulted in lower PN, indicating that ABA might play promotive roles in HRW-promoted growth in tomato seedlings under drought stress (Fig. 4D). Compared with the control, FLU treatment decreased E, gs and PN (Fig. 4)."
18,"Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on antioxidant enzyme activity and the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes under drought stress","3.5 Effects of HRW, ABA and FLU on antioxidant enzyme activity and the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes under drought stress Treatments with PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA or PEG + HRW + ABA notably increased the activity of SOD and CAT in comparison with PEG treatment; however, PEG + HRW + FLU treatment decreased their activity (Fig. 5 A and 5B). In addition, compared with PEG treatment, the relative expression levels of the SlSOD and SlCAT genes were also upregulated significantly by HRW and ABA under drought stress, whereas they were downregulated by FLU. As presented in Fig. 5C, higher APX activity was observed in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments than in the PEG treatment. Similar trends were also observed for the relative expression level of the SlAPX gene, and higher values were obtained in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments (Fig. 5C), indicating that H2 or ABA was able to improve the relative expression level of the SlAPX gene under drought stress conditions. There was no difference in SOD or APX activity or in their gene expression between the control and FLU treatment groups (Fig. 5A and 5C)."
19,"Effects of H2 on the endogenous ABA level, the activity of ABA synthase and the expression of ABA synthesis genes under drought stress","3.6 Effects of H2 on the endogenous ABA level, the activity of ABA synthase and the expression of ABA synthesis genes under drought stress Compared with PEG treatment or the control, PEG + HRW treatment significantly increased endogenous ABA content (Fig. 6 A). The activities of ZEP and NCED in PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments were obviously higher than those of the control or PEG treatment, whereas PEG + HRW + FLU treatment lowered ZEP and NCED activities, which were 59% and 70% lower, respectively, than those of PEG + HRW treatment (Fig. 6B and 6C). Similarly, the expression of SlZEP and SlNCED was also upregulated significantly by HRW and ABA under drought stress, whereas it was downregulated by FLU. Fig. 6D shows that the AAO activity and the expression of SlAAO were higher in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments than in PEG treatment or the control. In comparison with the control, treatment with FLU notably decreased ZEP activity, but FLU did not significantly affect the activities of NCED and AAO or their gene expression (Fig. 6B, 6C and 6D)."
20,Effects of H2 on the expression of ABA signal transduction genes under drought stress,"3.7 Effects of H2 on the expression of ABA signal transduction genes under drought stress The transcription levels of SlSnRK2 and SlAREB were significantly upregulated in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments in comparison with PEG or control treatments (Fig. 7 A and 7C). Conversely, the expression of SlSnRK2 and SlAREB was remarkably downregulated when FLU was added simultaneously with HRW. As shown in Fig. 7B, higher expression of SlPP2C was found in the control, FLU, PEG and PEG + HRW + FLU treatments, while low expression of SlPP2C was found in the PEG + HRW, PEG + ABA and PEG + HRW + ABA treatments. In addition, the transcription levels of SlPP2C in the PEG + HRW treatment were largely increased by the simultaneous presence of FLU. The above findings further demonstrate a crucial role for ABA in H2-enhanced drought resistance at the transcriptional level. As presented in Fig. 7A and 7C, there was no significant difference in the expression of SlSnRK2 or SlAREB among the control, PEG and FLU treatments."
21,Discussion,
22,The involvement of ABA in H2-alleviated drought stress,"4.1 The involvement of ABA in H2-alleviated drought stress H2 is a multifunctional signaling molecule that is involved in plant growth and development processes. H2 is also a vital bioregulator of antistress molecules in plants (Guan et al., 2019). In the present study, HRW at a 75% concentration increased the plant height, stem diameter and root activity of tomato seedlings under drought stress (Fig. 1). Some studies have proposed that H2 vastly helps plants adapt to drought stress (Zeng et al., 2013; Su et al., 2018). HRW treatment was able to enhance drought tolerance by decreasing the stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis thaliana (Xie et al., 2014). Compared with PEG treatment, PEG + 50% HRW was able to significantly promote adventitious root development in cucumber explants under drought stress (Chen et al., 2017a). Furthermore, H2 was able to alleviate the seedling growth inhibition induced by PEG by enhancing the production of endogenous NO in alfalfa seedling roots (Su et al., 2018). Our results indicate that H2, ABA and their combination enhanced drought tolerance in tomato seedlings. ABA, a primary plant hormone, is involved in plant developmental processes and stress responses. It improved the plant drought tolerance of maize and Arabidopsis (Zhang et al., 2020). Under drought conditions, endogenous ABA levels increase in maize leaves (Jiang and Zhang, 2002), and endogenous ABA level changes might be dependent on ABA biosynthesis and catabolism processes (Destefano-Beltran et al., 2006). Here, we found that the application of 100 and 150 μM ABA significantly increased plant height and stem diameter in tomato seedlings under drought stress (Fig. 2). However, according to Li et al. (2018b), a low concentration of ABA (0.5 μM) was able to induce adventitious root development in cucumber under drought stress. In addition, previous studies have also demonstrated that the application of ABA at lower concentrations was effective in alleviating drought stress symptoms (Sahay and Gupta., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). Both our and their studies demonstrate that ABA plays a positive role in plant growth under drought stress. However, the alleviated effects of ABA in their studies were significantly stronger than those in our study. The difference might be due to the different plants, lower PEG concentrations and different treatment durations. In addition, ABA mediated stomatal closure in response to drought stress, and stomatal closure was administered via the ABA signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis (Xing et al., 2019). Meanwhile, ABA ameliorated drought resistance by elevating the endogenous ABA concentration and antioxidant enzyme activities in tomato seedlings (Yuan et al., 2010)."
23,Photosynthesis and antioxidant system,"4.2 Photosynthesis and antioxidant system Sahay et al. (2020) showed that ABA was able to enhance Ci, E, gs and PN to alleviate drought stress in Brassica junce. At ten days of stress, ABA treatment presented higher PN and Ci in two maize hybrids (Corrêa de Souza et al., 2013). Similarly, we also found that the PEG + ABA treatment was able to remarkably enhance the E, gs and PN. Furthermore, we found that the PEG + 75% HRW treatment also increased the E and gs. Zhao et al. (2017) revealed that 75% HRW treatment increased the PN and gs under aluminum (Al)-induced stress, which is consistent with our results. HRW treatment (50%) was able to significantly improve the PN and gs in heat-stressed cucumber leaves (Chen et al., 2017b). Furthermore, we also suggest that the application of HRW combined with ABA is more effective than HRW or ABA alone under drought stress conditions, whereas the effect of HRW was reversed by FLU. Until now, the roles of the combination of H2 and ABA in the amelioration of PEG-induced stress have remained largely unknown. Here, our results indicate that ABA participated in H2-enhanced drought tolerance in tomato seedlings by alleviating photosynthesis damage. Cui et al. (2013) reported that H2 exhibited a positive effect on the activities of SOD, POD and APX and alleviated cadmium (Cd) toxicity in Medicago sativa. H2 might enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes to confer antioxidant protection, and H2 also positively regulates the ABA-dependent drought response (Li et al., 2018b). Xu et al. (2013) also showed that H2 could enhance the activities of SOD, CAT and APX or the corresponding transcripts of SOD, CAT and APX to alleviate salinity stress in rice. Their results are in agreement with our findings. Our results also demonstrate that PEG + HRW treatment increased the activities of SOD, APX and CAT and the gene expression of SlSOD, SlCAT, and SlAPX (Fig. 5). Meanwhile, these results are also consistent with those reported by Xie et al. (2012), in which they showed that H2 pretreatment could positively regulate genes/proteins of related antioxidant enzymes and the zinc finger transcription factor ZAT10/12 in Arabidopsis seedlings under NaCl stress. Furthermore, PEG + ABA treatment enhanced the activities of SOD, CAT and APX. Lu et al. (2003) showed that ABA treatment increased the activities of SOD, CAT and POD, and the activities were maintained at higher levels in ABA-treated plants during drought stress. Lu et al. (2009) also reported that ABA treatment maintained notably higher activities of SOD and CAT at Days 6 and 8 than the control under drought stress in triploid bermudagrass. These results are consistent with our results. In addition, we found that the activities SOD, CAT and APX and the gene expression of SlSOD, SlCAT and SlAPX in the PEG + HRW + ABA treatment were significantly higher than those in PEG treatment, indicating HRW and ABA might have slight synergistic effect on the induction of antioxidant enzyme activity and the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes under drought stress. However, the promotive role of HRW was largely prevented by the simultaneous presence of FLU. Therefore, we concluded that ABA might be involved in the H2-improved antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in response to drought stress. Thus, the current study is significant in elucidating the roles of the crosstalk between HRW and ABA in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and in the corresponding levels of transcription in tomato seedlings under drought stress."
24,ABA biosynthesis-related gene expression,"4.3 ABA biosynthesis-related gene expression A previous study indicated that FLU could inhibit the accumulation of endogenous ABA (Zhang et al., 2012a). Hossain et al. (2011) showed that treatment with FLU suppressed methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced stomatal closure in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana. This result indicated that endogenous ABA was required for MeJA-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis guard cells. In our study, the positive effect of HRW on plant height, stem diameter and root activity under drought stress was dramatically inhibited by the simultaneous presence of FLU (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we also discovered that cotreatment with HRW and ABA significantly ameliorated drought stress symptoms (Fig. 3). According to Jin et al. (2016), H2 could positively modulate ABA-promoted stomatal closure and H2O2 production, which might decrease transpirational water loss to enhance drought tolerance. Therefore, we speculated that ABA might be involved in H2-enhanced drought tolerance. Xie et al. (2014) indicated that H2 enhanced drought tolerance by reducing the stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis and that H2 could act downstream in the ABA signaling cascade. Their result is partly consistent with our findings, which demonstrate that H2 enhanced drought tolerance via the involvement of ABA in tomato seedlings. Xie et al. (2014) also further found that ABA could stimulate quick and sustained H2 release and production in Arabidopsis. In addition, the application of H2 enhanced endogenous ABA production, along with the regulation of ABA biosynthesis, in alfalfa seedlings (Felix et al., 2019). We also observed an increase in the ABA content in HRW-treated tomato seedlings under drought stress, indicating that H2 induced ABA biosynthesis. ABA biosynthesis can be triggered by drought stress, and ABA might stimulate ABA synthesis through a mechanism of positive feedback (Chen et al., 2014). ZEP, NCED and AAO are enzymes involved in the ABA biosynthesis pathway (Zhang et al., 2012b). HRW and ABA increased the activities of ZEP, NCED and AAO, and ABA combined with HRW had a slight synergistic effect on ABA biosynthesis under drought stress. However, the promotive roles of HRW in the activities of ZEP, NCED and AAO under drought stress were mostly prevented by the simultaneous presence of FLU (Fig. 6). In addition, Woldesemayat and Ntwasa (2018) suggested that the regulatory genes of ZEP, NCED and AAO are involved in ABA biosynthesis. In our study, the expression of SlZEP, SlNCED and SlAAO was also upregulated by HRW or ABA, whereas it was downregulated by FLU. These results revealed that H2 induces ABA biosynthesis by increasing the activities of ZEP, NCED and AAO and upregulates the expression of SlZEP, SlNCED and SlAAO in tomato seedlings under drought stress. Thus, our study offers supporting evidence that H2 might be involved in ABA biosynthesis and play a positive role in tomato seedlings under drought stress. Group A 2C-type protein phosphatase (PP2C) and subclass III SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) are crucial components of the ABA signaling pathway (Amagai et al., 2018). ABA stimulates the transcription levels of many genes through ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in its promoter regions, and ABRE-binding protein (AREB) is also a positive regulatory factor in the ABA signaling pathway (Fujita et al., 2013). In our work, the expression of SlSnRK2 and SlAREB was distinctly upregulated by HRW or ABA, whereas the promotive role of HRW was largely suppressed by the ABA inhibitor FLU (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we observed that HRW and ABA had synergistic effects on ABA signaling. The four AREB/ABF transcription factors might act on gene expression downstream of SnRK2 in ABA signaling in response to osmotic stress (Yoshida et al., 2015). PP2C, a negative regulator of ABA responses, has shown upregulation in response to drought stress but downregulation to biotic stresses in Brachypodium distachyon (Cao et al., 2016). Our results also show the transcription level of SlPP2C to be negatively regulated by HRW or ABA (Fig. 7). Moreover, Chen et al. (2016) demonstrated that each SlSnRK2 might interact with SlPP2C2 and that they could be modulated by ABA in tomato fruits. However, we show that the application of FLU remarkably increased the expression of SlPP2C in tomato seedlings under drought stress (Fig. 7). Zhang et al. (2018b) observed that SlPP2C1 was involved in drought tolerance, fruit ripening and ABA response in tomato. Here, our findings indicate that H2 is able to positively regulate the expression of SlSnRK2 and SlAREB in response to drought stress, while negatively modulating the expression of SlPP2C. However, the mechanism that links ABA and H2 in drought resistance has not been reported. Thus, we confirm here that H2 is involved in the regulation of ABA signal transduction genes in tomato seedlings under drought stress."
25,Conclusion,"In general, our results suggest that optimal concentrations of ABA and H2 could ameliorate drought stress in tomato seedlings. ABA might be involved in H2-enhanced drought resistance in tomato seedlings by increasing photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity and the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. Additionally, H2 might enhance ABA biosynthesis by increasing the activity of ABA synthase and the expression of ABA synthesis genes during that process. H2 also was able to increase the expression of ABA signal transduction genes."
