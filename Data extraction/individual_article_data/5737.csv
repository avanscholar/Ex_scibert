0,Introduction,"The development of biorefineries with multiple product lines is essential to establish a sustainable lignocellulosic-based bioeconomy, but this requires all the components of the biomass to be converted into a broad range of high-value products [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass is a heterogeneous matrix of interlinked biopolymers, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and traces of water-soluble pectins, proteins and aliphatic acids [2]. Lignin, consisting of phenylpropane units, represents the non-polysaccharide portion of lignocellulosic biomass and provides mechanical strength in plants. However, its resistance to enzymatic and chemical treatment limits the production of high-value commodities from this substrate [3,4]. The intricate heterogeneous lignin biopolymer is made up of simpler units called monolignols (p-coumaryl, conifer and sinapyl alcohol) (Fig. 1 ). The free-radical polymerization of the monolignols in plants is catalyzed by peroxidases and laccases, with the phenylpropane units bound by ether (C-O-C) and carbon-carbon (C-C) linkages [5]. Depending on the plant type, the β-O-4 ether linkages can account for 50–62 % of the total linkages in lignin (Fig. 1). To improve the economics of biorefineries, the lignin component of plant material must also be converted to valuable biochemicals. Lignin accounts for less than 2 % of the production of value-added products due to its complex structure and recalcitrance [6]. Although it is regarded as a low-value product and primarily serves as an energy source in sugar-based platforms, lignin is the most abundant natural source of high-value aromatic compounds. It is also the second-most abundant source of organic carbon after cellulose and accounts for one-third of the total organic carbon available on earth [7]. In nature, lignin is decomposed mainly by white-rot basidiomycetes, a highly specialized group of microorganisms that secrete a consortium of oxidative enzymes, resulting in decaying wood displaying a whitish colour and texture (hence the name “white-rot”). White-rot basidiomycetes degrade lignin through the synergistic action of class II heme-containing peroxidases and laccases (the major ligninolytic enzymes), as well as various auxiliary enzymes. Lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and versatile peroxidase catalyze the oxidation of substrates using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant [8]. Laccases are multicopper oxidases that oxidise substrates whilst reducing oxygen to H2O [9]. The auxiliary enzyme machinery consists of cellobiose dehydrogenases, quinone reductases and H2O2-generating oxidases such as aryl-alcohol oxidase. This review provides a short introduction on the enzymatic conversion of lignin to valuable products, with special attention to the role of fungal lignin peroxidases. Selected commercial applications of lignin peroxidases are discussed, including biofuels, biopulping and biobleaching, food and cosmetic industries, and bioremediation. The progress, challenges and state-of-the-art strategies to develop and produce this enzyme commercially for industrial and biotechnological applications will be highlighted."
1,Class II peroxidases,"In recent years, classical oxidoreductases have attracted much attention due to their potential industrial and biotechnological applications [10]. These enzymes are classified as CAZy family Auxiliary Activities (AA) 1 and 2 [11]. Family AA1 consists of multicopper oxidases and occur in plants, insects, fungi and insects [9]. Of great interest is family AA2, also known as class II heme-containing peroxidases that originate from white-rot basidiomycetes, due to the high-redox potentials required for lignin degradation [12]. Extracellular class II ligninolytic peroxidases, characterized by the heme protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group, include lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC 1.11.1.14), manganese peroxidase (MnP, EC 1.11.1.13) and the hybrid of the two, versatile peroxidase (VP, EC 1.11.1.16). This versatile group of enzymes catalyze the oxidation of both organic and inorganic compounds in a non-specific manner using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant [8]. Compared to other peroxidases and laccases, ligninolytic peroxidases have higher redox potentials that permit the oxidation of a broad range of recalcitrant substrates, including lignin [13]. White-rot basidiomycetes are involved in carbon recycling in ecosystems by secreting these enzymes to degrade lignin in a process known as ‘enzymatic combustion’ [14]. Some bacteria also produce ligninolytic peroxidases, but our knowledge of fungal ligninolytic enzymology currently exceeds that from bacterial sources [15]. White-rot fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium serve as model ligninolytic microorganisms that contain multiple LiP and MnP-encoding genes and secrete the enzymes as isozymes, but they don’t produce any VP. Other prominent class II peroxidase producers include (but are not limited to) Phanerochaete sordida, Phlebia radiata, Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus ostreatus and Bjerkandera adusta [16]."
2,Lignin peroxidase,"White-rot basidiomycetes are the main and mostly studied producers of ligninolytic enzymes such as LiP, also known as diarylpropane peroxidase or ligninase I [17]. In native producers such as P. chrysosporium, LiP is produced as a secondary enzyme in response to nitrogen and/or carbon depletion and may be hampered by high concentrations of nitrogen [18,19]. Strains of P. chrysosporium have multiple LiP-encoding genes and secrete the enzyme as numerous isozymes (H1, H2, H6, H7, H8 and H10), with H8 being the best characterized [20,21]. It is an extracellular globular glycoprotein of approximately 343 amino acid residues with a molecular size of 38−42 kDa [22]. Lignin peroxidases have unique properties such as a low optimum pH of 3.0–4.5 and a theoretical pI of 3.3–4.7, depending on the isozyme [23]. Class II peroxidases share a high degree of structural homology, including a conserved heme group, calcium-binding sites and disulfide bonds. The structural properties of LiP are similar to that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with relatively few β-sheets in the C-terminal domain and eight major and minor α-helices [24] (Fig. 2 ). Lignin peroxidase has four disulfide bonds that maintain the overall protein structure, presumed to be formed by the cysteine residues, and two calcium-binding sites believed to be vital in maintaining the active site of the enzyme [25]. The enzyme is N- and O-glycosylated to protect it against proteolytic degradation [26]. The heme residue in LiP is embedded between the proximal and distal domains located in the interior part of the protein (Fig. 2). Lignin peroxidases have a narrower heme access cavity than classical peroxidases, such as HRP and the low-redox potential fungal Coprinus cinerea peroxidase (CiP), which limits the interaction of the heme residue with some substrates and the oxidation thereof. In native producers, LiP is secreted with veratryl alcohol (VA; 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol), a natural phenolic substrate of LiP that acts as a small diffusible redox mediator for the conversion of inaccessible substrates [27]. This mechanism facilitates the indirect interaction between the protein active site and an aromatic substrate such as lignin [28]. Lignin peroxidases are the only ligninolytic enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of the phenolic and non-phenolic aromatic units of lignin with or without mediators. This is done via a long-range electron transfer attributed by Trp171, which is connected to the heme group (Fig. 2). The Trp171 residue located at the surface of the enzyme is a unique characteristic of both LiP and VP, although the latter uses Trp164 [30,31]. The Trp171 residue is absent in MnP, which is also unable to oxidize high-redox compounds. Sáez-Jiménez et al. [32] demonstrated the importance of the surface tryptophan conserved in most LiPs and VPs for the oxidation of non-phenolic moieties of lignin. The ability of LiP to oxidize high-redox potential compounds is also ascribed to the penta-coordinated iron porphyrin ring at the active site that results in one electron less than other heme-containing peroxidases [31]. Peroxidases share a very similar catalytic cycle that occurs in multiple steps (Fig. 3 ). The catalytic mechanism of native ferric LiP involves the interaction of the catalytic site, the heme protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group (part of the catalytic domain) and H2O2 to produce compound I, also known as a LiPI oxo-ferryl intermediate (reviewed in [29,33]). Compound I is then reduced twice (one electron at a time) by a reducing substrate (AH) via compound II (LiPII) to return to its resting (native) state. Excess H2O2 inactivates the enzyme by producing compound III (LiPIII). In the presence of VA + radicals, compound III is converted back to the native ferric LiP with veratraldehyde (VAD) produced as byproduct [34,35]."
3,Potential applications of LiP,"Peroxidases, including LiP, play a vital role in the production of biofuels, pulp and paper and other biochemical as it oxidatively depolymerize lignin and leave the polysaccharides intact [36]. It is important to note that the biochemical function of this enzyme includes both lignin depolymerization and lignin polymerization (similar to HRP), which diversifies its application. However, the industrial and biotechnological applications of ligninolytic peroxidases are limited by low production titres from native producers and heterologous expression systems, poor enzyme stability under optimum operating conditions and suicidal inactivation of the enzymes [37]. Lignin peroxidase has a broad spectrum of potential industrial and biotechnological applications attributed by its non-specific catalytic mechanism towards a variety of substrates [38]. The use of LiP may provide a cost-effective, efficient and “greener” route for the transformation of biomass into second-generation (2 G) biofuels and other high-value green biochemicals, and thus effectively improve the economics of biorefineries. This biocatalyst can be applied in diverse industries such as pulp and paper mills, biofuels, food and feed, pharmaceuticals and also serve as a bioremediation agent [39,40]. Many of these industries typically use thermochemical and chemical methods for the depolymerization of lignin, which entails harsh conditions and produce toxic by-products. The use of LiP may help to overcome these challenges whilst also reducing the energy costs for these industries."
4,Second-generation (2 G) biofuels,"4.1 Second-generation (2 G) biofuels Lignin depolymerization is an important step in producing 2 G biofuels and other green chemicals as lignin protects cellulose and hemicellulose against the enzymes required to hydrolyse it to fermentable sugars. Although LiP has been reported to degrade lignin, there is limited documentation on the successful use of LiP to pretreat biomass for biofuel production. Pinto et al. [41] demonstrated that LiP pretreatment significantly increased the saccharification yields from straw compared to MnP and laccase. Pretreatment of corn stover with a Myrothecium verrucaria strain capable of secreting LiP, MnP and laccase, resulted in a 42.3 % decrease in lignin content [42] and a 123.48 % conversion rate relative to the control without enzymatic pretreatment. Furthermore, a VP from Physisporinus vitreus was to able to catalyze the breakdown of β-O-4 and 5-5’ dimers into their monomeric units [43], resulting in a 14.1 % higher enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover than a purified VP used in vitro. Due to their high-redox potential, ligninolytic enzymes could also be used for the detoxification of inhibitory by-products formed during the pretreatment of biomass. Currently, no reports have documented the use of LiP for detoxifying or removing inhibitory pretreatment by-products. However, a laccase and HRP (both having lower redox potentials than LiP) enzymatically detoxified spruce hydrolysate [44], removing approximately 55 % and 25 % of inhibitors, respectively. A recombinant MnP from Pichia pastoris detoxified furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF), with the former being more susceptible [45]."
5,Biopulping and biobleaching,"4.2 Biopulping and biobleaching Kraft (chemical) pulping is commonly used in pulp and paper industries and uses alkaline (NaOH) treatment at high temperature and pressure to selectively degrade lignin whilst preserving the polysaccharide fibres [46]. However, it partially destroys the desired polymers, resulting in low pulp yields. Biopulping, which involves the use of ligninolytic microorganisms or their ligninolytic enzyme consortium, is the preferred option to degrade wood lignin for the production of paper [47]. It softens the wood and improves the paper strength and quality and reduces energy requirements during the pulping process [48]. Two Phanerochaete sp. were investigated for their biopulping capabilities on hardwood kraft pulp and in both cases, LiP was the principle enzyme together with small traces of MnP. The authors concluded that there was a direct relationship between the increase in LiP activity and the level of brightness of the pulp [49]. Orozco Colonia et al. [50] reported a 36.80 % lignin and 26.27 % hemicellulose removal with a combination of LiP and xylanase produced in an Aspergillus sp. during biopulping and biobleaching, effectively resulting in a 74.36 % pulp yield. The use of LiP may thus help curb the production costs of expensive chemicals and allow for more environmentally friendly treatment conditions compared to conventional methods."
6,Food and cosmetic industries,"4.3 Food and cosmetic industries A number of lignin-derived products have found application in the food and cosmetic industries, with vanillin probably the best-known. Its rich vanilla aroma has led to applications as a flavouring agent in food and beverages and as a fragrance ingredient in perfumes. However, due to high market costs, only about 1% of vanillin is obtained from natural vanilla [51]. Most of the synthetic vanillin is produced from aromatic substrates such as lignin and guaiacol via hazardous chemical methods. It has been reported that vanillin can be biochemically produced using purified LiP and LiP-producing white-rot P. chrysosporium [52,53], with the LiP that converted O-acetyl isoeugenol and O-acetyl coniferyl into alcohol O-acetyl vanillin. Furthermore, Barbosa et al. [53] showed that vanillin can be produced through solid-state fermentation of green coconut residues with P. chrysosporium. Lignin can also serve as a substrate for the production of organic acids, such as succinic acid, a multiple-platform high value-added chemical that can also be used as a flavour enhancer in beverages. For example, Hong and co-workers [54] reported the conversion of lignin into succinic acid using P. chrysosporium LiP in conjunction with other enzymes. The demand for safe methods for skin whitening and to treat the hyperpigmentary disorder, melisma, led to exploring enzymatic decolorization of melanin as an alternative to chemical inhibitors (of tyrosinase activity) that could have undesirable side-effects [55]. Purified LiP showed particular promise for applications in the cosmetic industry and dermatology. Zhong et al. [56] reported the reduction of melasma within 7 days of treatment with a LiP-based lotion, with no adverse effects. Sung et al. [57] demonstrated that recombinant LiP combined with glucose oxidase can efficiently decolorize melanin."
7,Bioremediation,"4.4 Bioremediation Dyes are extensively used in many textile, paint, pulp and paper industries, with approximately 10–15 % of the dye discharged in the effluent [58]. Some of these dyes are toxic and display carcinogenic properties, e.g. the environmental pollutant benzidine [59]. Several ligninolytic enzymes from white-rot basidiomycetes have been used as bioremediation agents to degrade pollutants such as synthetic dyes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [51–63]. A Ganoderma lucidum LiP immobilized in Ca-alginate beads decolourized 80–93 % of Sandal reactive textile dyes and reduced its haemolytic cytotoxicity [64]. Bouacem et al. [65] reported a decolorizing efficiency of 15–89 % with a purified LiP and MnP from Bjerkandera adusta after 12 h treatment of Remazol Brilliant Blue Reactif [65]. When investigating the use of LiP for waste treatment, a partially purified LiP from P. chrysosporium was able to degrade toxic synthetic polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC) films [66], resulting in a 31 % weight reduction of the films. Mao et al. [35] reported that LiP could effectively transform an endocrine disruptive hormone known as 17β-estradiol (E2), which is considered a pollutant once released into the environment. The authors concluded that VA facilitates the enhanced removal and transformation of E2 by LiP and could perhaps also remove other closely related endocrine-disrupting impurities. Although there are no reports on the use of LiP for the detoxification of mycotoxins present in human food and animal feed, Marimón Sibaja et al. [67] reported the use of a commercial HRP that resulted in a 97 % and 24 % biotransformation of aflatoxin B1 in cow milk and beer, respectively. Since LiPs have a similar catalytic mechanism and higher redox potential than HRP, the potential use of LiP for this application merits further exploration."
8,Production of LiP for commercial applications,"Despite all the potential industrial and biotechnological applications of LiP, the enzyme is not yet applied commercially, mainly due to the scarcity and high cost of commercial LiP preparations. The latter is ascribed to numerous factors, including low secretion titers from native producers, suicidal inactivation by H2O2 (Fig. 3), inactivation by solvents and often instability at high temperatures. The discovery and development of potent ligninolytic peroxidases produced at relatively high concentrations thus remain crucial for many industrial and biotechnological applications. The ideal ligninolytic peroxidase comprises a high-redox potential, versatile substrate oxidation, high solvent tolerance, high H2O2 tolerance and high thermal and pH stability. Various homologous and recombinant expression systems have been evaluated for the increased production of LiPs. The following sections will highlight the different strategies that have been explored, as well as some of the lessons learned from these attempts that should inform future strategies."
9,Homologous expression of LiP,"5.1 Homologous expression of LiP Some researchers hypothesized that bacterial peroxidases have higher optimum temperatures, are more stable or easier to express than fungal peroxidases, but display lower redox potentials than the fungal enzymes that limit their industrial applications [68]. One of the major barriers for the industrial application of class II peroxidases, especially LiP, are the low production titres from native producers. The production of these enzymes from white-rot fungi requires optimal cultivation time, carbon and nitrogen sources, temperature, pH, oxygen concentrations, agitation and type of substrate, to obtain optimum yields [69]. Moreover, the different isozymes of LiP in native producers are hypothesized to be differentially regulated in response to carbon and nitrogen sources [18]. Even with the control of these parameters, natively produced LiPs at high titers remain elusive. Researchers were thus prompted to explore alternative strategies, including the homologous expression of LiP in native hosts such as P. chrysosporium and P. sordida in high nitrogen conditions [70,71]. In both studies, recombinant LiP was successfully secreted in the culture medium, but wild-type LiP was not detected. In a later study by Sollewijn Gelpke et al. [72], four P. chrysosporium LiPH8 variant genes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and produced by homologous expression in P. chrysosporium. Coconi-Linares et al. [73] reported the construction of a P. chrysosporium strain to co-produce a recombinant LiP, MnP and VP at higher levels than the wild-type strain. The LiPH8 and MnP1 levels expression were significantly increased and high VP activity was observed that was absent in the wild-type."
10,Heterologous expression of LiP,"5.2 Heterologous expression of LiP To circumvent some of the bottlenecks listed above, researchers have made numerous attempts to produce family AA2 enzymes, using recombinant expression systems. Johnson and Li [74] reported the first heterologously expressed class II peroxidase (LiP) using recombinant baculovirus, but this strategy was expensive and returned low yields. The recombinant expression of LiP in E. coli and fungal expression systems will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. 5.2.1 Expression in E. coli Escherichia coli has been extensively used as a prokaryotic host for the production of recombinant proteins. Attributes such as a well-established genetic background, relative fast growth rate on inexpensive media have placed this system at the forefront for recombinant proteins originating from eukaryotes [75]. Eukaryotic proteins are often produced as inactive protein aggregates (inclusion bodies) in E. coli, which may be advantageous should the protein of interest be susceptible to proteolytic degradation [76]. The majority of studies on recombinant LiP and other family AA2 enzymes have been conducted in E. coli (Table 1 ), but technical hurdles have limited the use of family AA2 enzymes in biotechnological applications. Following the cloning and expression in E. coli, the enzymes are recovered from inclusion bodies and require in vitro refolding and often purification that can be costly and laborious with variable yields [77]. As shown in Table 1, recombinant LiP produced in E. coli displayed different kinetic properties on the model substrate, VA. More recent work that combined advanced analytic techniques for the purification and refolding of LiP produced in E. coli improved its catalytic efficiency on VA [78]. High-titer production of LiP in E. coli remains elusive, most likely due to the complex protein structure that requires posttranslational modifications that are only possible in higher eukaryotic organisms. Studies on class II peroxidases produced in E. coli mainly focused on the structure and function of these enzymes on specific substrates. There are no reports yet on high-yield production of LiP in soluble form using E. coli, but Lin et al. [79] reported that fungal MnPs can be produced at high yields through soluble expression in E.coli, whereas Bao and co-workers [80] reported the overexpression of VP in E. coli. 5.2.2 Expression in fungi Given the challenges with family AA2 enzyme production, filamentous fungi that are known to be good producers of fungal proteins have also been explored. Conesa et al. [88] demonstrated the production of a recombinant P. chrysosporium LiP and MnP in a protease-deficient Aspergillus niger strain, which secreted active MnP into the medium with a similar specific activity and spectrum profile than the native enzyme. The MnP production levels were enhanced by haemoglobin supplementation, but the secreted recombinant LiP was inactive. One of the limitations of filamentous fungi is cell autolysis (with protease secretion) during late fermentation when nutrients become limited, which vary between species, even in protease-deficient strains [89]. Also, fungi are generally more challenging to transform with exogenous DNA than bacterial and yeast strains. Yeasts are genetically more complex than E. coli, but they offer attributes that are attractive for industrial applications, such as high secretion titers, various carbon sources, rapid growth to high cell densities, general robustness and being able to perform a range of post-translational modifications [90]. The published complete genomic sequences of both conventional (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and nonconventional species (Komagatella sp., Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), have made genomic engineering tools readily available [91]. Furthermore, some yeasts have effectively produced complex recombinant proteins originating from other eukaryotes in a biological active form and at considerable yields. Given the diverse and extensive reporting in literature, a well-annotated genome and relative ease to use, S. cerevisiae has dominated recombinant protein production for industrial and biotechnological applications [92] and has resulted in the successful production of many fungal recombinant lignocellulolytic enzymes [93–96]. This yeast can perform eukaryotic protein posttranslational modifications such as protein folding, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation, making them ideal for the expression of recombinant LiP and other family AA2 enzymes. Ryu et al. [97] applied a direct evolution technique to obtain several mutant LiP genes; expression of the different genes in S. cerevisiae yielded extracellular LiPs that displayed a 1.6-fold improvement in dichlorophenol degradation and H2O2 stability, compared to the natural LiP. Gonzalez-Perez and Alcalde [98] also reported the successful expression of a closely related VP in S. cerevisiae. Nonconventional yeasts have also shown potential for the production of recombinant proteins for application in industries such as biopharmaceuticals, food/beverage and renewable chemicals, with some that can produce recombinant proteins at higher secretion titers than S. cerevisiae [99]. Methylotrophic yeasts like Komagatella (Pichia) spp. and Ogataea (Pichia) methanolica are the favourite nonconventional yeasts for the production of LiP and other family AA2 enzymes (Table 2 ). Wang et al. [100] demonstrated the production of the P. chrysosporium LiPH8 in P. methanolica using a methanol-inducible promoter. The P. chrysosporium LiPH2 isozyme was cloned and successfully expressed in P. pastoris, but relatively low yields were obtained in the extracellular medium [101]. The expression of LiP under strong inducible promoters in methylotrophic yeasts yielded promising results (Table 2). Thus far, the most efficient and cost-effective method to produce functional recombinant LiP in P. pastoris was using codon optimization genes and a fed-batch fermentation strategy under the control of the AOX1 promoter [102]. This yielded an activity 4 480 U L−1 and thus promote the use LiP for industrial and biotechnological applications. 5.2.3 Pichia pastoris as recombinant host for LiPs In recent years, the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris has become a powerhouse for fungal recombinant extracellular enzymes [105]. Several studies have documented the successful heterologous production of heme-containing peroxidases such as HRP (structurally similar to LiP) in P. pastoris [106–108]. As early as 2003, a recombinant MnP from P. chrysosporium was successfully produced in P. pastoris [109]. The recombinant MnP exhibited steady-state kinetic properties similar to the wild-type, but was considerably larger and displayed lower thermostability. Xu et al. [110] produced a recombinant MnP in P. pastoris that could efficiently remove lignin from both hardwood and softwood pulps. Other recombinant heme-containing peroxidases successfully produced in P. pastoris are summarised in Table 3 . The choice of genetic elements such as secretion signal peptides plays a pivotal role in obtaining optimum yields of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris. The majority of class II heme-containing peroxidases produced in P. pastoris are secreted using either the native or the S. cerevisiae α-mating factor secretion signal with the latter being the more successful [45,111,112]. For example, C. cinerea peroxidase has been successfully produced in P. pastoris using the AOX1 promoter and S. cerevisiae α-mating factor secretion signal [113,114]. The production of a recombinant HRP was enhanced by introducing specific deletions in the S. cerevisiae α-mating factor secretion signal sequence [115]. Gu et al. [109] showed recombinant MnP production could be increased eight-fold by replacing the P. chrysosporium native secretion signal with the α-mating factor secretion signal. Similarly, recombinant LiP yields were increased two-fold by replacing the native secretion signal with S. cerevisiae α-mating factor secretion signal [100]. The success of P. pastoris as an expression system is highly associated with the strong methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. Whilst reports documenting the successful production of LiP in P. pastoris using constitutive promoters remain elusive, the recent development of methanol-free AOX1 promoter systems (reviewed in [116]) has placed P. pastoris in the forefront as a potential host to produce LiP. Whereas hyperglycosylation may be responsible for the insufficient production levels of active fungal enzymes in S. cerevisiae, glycosylation in P. pastoris is less extensive and the organism can add both N- and O-glycans to proteins, a structural feature of LiPs. Improper folding of proteins in foreign expression systems may also be a limiting factor. Co-expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) molecular chaperones in P. pastoris, such as the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), can support correct disulphide bond formation and increase the secretion of some complex recombinant proteins [117–119]. The true potential of P. pastoris for high-yield recombinant LiP production can be attributed to high cell-density fermentations in bioreactors, but this requires precise parameter control such as temperature, pH, oxygen, carbon feed and growth rate. Jiang et al. [120] demonstrated high yields of a recombinant MnP (effective in pulp bleaching) in a protease-deficient P. pastoris strain in bioreactor fermentations. The recombinant MnP of Ganoderma lucidum (capable of decolorizing four types of dyes and degrading phenol) was also successfully expressed in P. pastoris [112]. More recently, Majeke et al. [102] reported that moderate yields of active recombinant LiP for the upgrade of technical lignins can be achieved in bioreactor cultivations. Despite the existing challenges with producing heme-containing peroxidases in significant quantities, some studies showed that the production levels in heterologous expression systems can be enhanced by the addition of heme in the culture medium [78,88,120]. Krainer et al. [121] demonstrated HRP production levels can be increased by co-expressing genes involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway in P. pastoris, as well as supplementing the medium with heme. The authors concluded that supplementation with hemin (the ferric chlorine heme precursor) yielded the highest levels of recombinant HRP in this host. In a subsequent study, Gmeiner and Spaduit [122] showed that hemin supplementation enhanced the HRP activity, protein content and specific activity by 5.87, 1.80 and 3.28-fold, respectively, in a P. pastoris Δoch1 (encodes α-1,6-mannosyltransferase) knockout strain. 5.2.4 Protein engineering Lignin peroxidase production has been improved by recombinant production in native and heterologous hosts. However, application of these enzymes is hampered by their native instability at high temperatures and in the presence of solvents, as well as their susceptibility to inactivation by H2O2. Some authors proposed the use of immobilization techniques to improve the activity of LiPs [72], but some of these are technically difficult and very costly. It is thus necessary to explore alternative protein engineering approaches to enhance the properties of natural LiPs and/or produce the enzymes at higher levels. Rational design and directed evolution are the two most popular techniques to bioengineer enzymes to display robust characteristics required for industrial applications [127]. A recently review [128] revealed that a hybrid VP has been more extensively engineered for improved biofunctions than the other peroxidases (Table 4 ). Early reports of protein engineering of fungal LiP using site-directed mutagenesis focused on the biofunctional role of the Trp171 residue, but reports on improved biofunctional properties are limited. A recombinant LiP with an Mn2+ binding site (absent in natural LiPs) increased its substrate spectrum; the recombinant LiP could oxidize Mn2+ and retain its VA oxidation capability, but its steady-state properties were lower than natural LiP and MnP [129]. Recombinant LiPs of P. chrysosporium with either improved H2O2 stability [130] or thermal stability [134] through site-directed mutagenesis have been reported. The introduction of multiple ancestral amino acid substitutions into the wild-type LiP improved the thermal stability and the specific activity of the enzyme. Pham et al. [135] demonstrated that modifications of the acidic micro-environment of the active site of LiP enhanced the catalytic oxidation of non-phenolic compounds. Recently, the same authors designed a LiPH8 variant using an in silico strategy and reported a 12.5‑fold increase in half‑life stability under extremely acidic conditions when expressed in E. coli [137]. Protein engineering has thus become an attractive tool to overcome some of the limitations associated with natural peroxidases."
11,Conclusion and future perspectives for commercial LiP production,"Despite the significant progress made in molecular biology techniques for engineering bacteria, fungi and yeast for fungal family AA2 recombinant enzyme production, process-ready heterologous expression systems secreting high levels of LiP are still lacking and the availability of LiP for industrial and biotechnological applications remains a challenge. The heterologous expression of LiP in particular has been more difficult than other family AA2 enzymes. The poor secretion yields and unsatisfactory catalytic activity of LiP in heterologous expression systems are correlated with the complex molecular structure of the enzyme [138]. Fungal LiPs are glycoproteins that require post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulphide isomerization and their production in foreign host systems may alter their glycosylation properties, resulting in attenuated catalytic functions. Furthermore, disulphide bonds, particularly in heme-containing peroxidases such as LiP, will affect the enzyme activity [139]. For example, Eggenreich et al. [77] suggested that the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli rather than soluble active enzyme is a result of the heme group and disulphide bonds present in family AA2 enzymes. Pichia pastoris has great potential for recombinant LiP production given favourable features such as the ability to grow on inexpensive media, yielding high protein production titers and growing on a variety of carbon sources. It has a genetically malleable genome, established toolkit for molecular manipulation, naturally strong promoters and is capable of performing post-translational modifications essential for complex proteins [140,141]. The lessons learnt from other heme-containing peroxidase studies conducted in P. pastoris could be explored for future large-scale production of LiP suitable for industrial and biotechnological applications. For example, the addition of media supplements, e.g. heme and amino acids, increased the production levels of MnP and HRP in P. pastoris. Given the existing knowledge on the systems biology of P. pastoris (reviewed in [142], numerous approaches could be combined to elevate recombinant LiP production yields in this yeast. It is evident that several strategies need to be investigated to successfully produce LiP even in the well-established P. pastoris host system. Good progress has been made to create LiPs with improved biofunctional properties that may pave the way for the future application of this enzyme. By exploring the combination of protein engineering for enhanced properties such as solvent tolerance, temperature, pH and H2O2 stability, with strain engineering for enhanced recombinant protein production in P. pastoris, robust LiPs at high yields tailor-made for industrial and biotechnological applications could be achieved."
