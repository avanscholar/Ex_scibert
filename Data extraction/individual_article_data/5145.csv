0,Introduction,"Depleting petroleum reserves and increasing concern over climate change have brought renewable energies to the forefront of the scientific community. One area of particular interest is the production of biodiesel through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is renewable, biodegradable, environmentally-friendly, and can be used directly in diesel engines without major modifications. The biodiesel industry has become one of the most rapidly growing industries in the world, with global biodiesel production projected to reach 37 billion gallons by 2016 [1]. One of the co-products from biodiesel production is glycerol, which accounts for at least 10% of the volume of the resultant mixture from a transesterification process. With an increase in biodiesel production worldwide, the generation of glycerol will increase accordingly, raising a new problem: disposal of waste glycerol [2–4]. Disposing of crude glycerol can be not only costly, but also wasteful, and cause environmental problems. Therefore, it is essential to explore wiser utilization options for glycerol. Pure glycerol is used as a raw material and can be converted into various value added products in the personal care, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food industries. The Global Glycerol Market is expected to reach USD 2.52 billion by 2020, and biodiesel emerged as the leading source of glycerol, accounting for over 1400kt of glycerol production in 2013 [5]. However, the glycerol produced in the making of biodiesel is known as “crude glycerol”, which contains impurities such as methanol, fatty acid methyl esters, and salts left over from the transesterification reaction. Because of these impurities, the refining cost of crude glycerol is very high, which makes the use of it in these traditional industries infeasible despite its low market price [6,7]. Despite the low demand for the unrefined glycerol in these traditional industries, it can be an inexpensive raw material with several very practical applications in the emerging sector of renewable energy. Integration of waste glycerol into renewable energy production processes not only benefits those processes, but also helps to reduce the cost of biodiesel production, and is often times beneficial to the environment. There are a number of excellent review papers in the literature addressing the growing challenge of surplus crude glycerol, each of which has different focuses. For example, the worldwide glycerol production and market and its application in direct combustion were reviewed in articles [3,4]. Ayoub and Abdullah [7] detailed the status of glycerol production and its impact on the global market, emphasizing region-wise and demand-wise application. Gupta and Kumar [8] proposed that crude glycerol was a promising source of energy, and briefly stated the studies conducted in this field before 2012, however without technical details. Stelmachowski et al. [9] focused on the photocatalytic methods for the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen. Đurišić-Mladenović et al. [10] proposed co-gasification of glycerol with other biomass for syngas production. Potential applications of crude glycerol in polymer technology was recently evaluated [11]. Upgrading crude glycerol to value-added products hold great promises and was mostly reviewed in the literature [2,6,8,12–18]. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review from energy perspective. An emphasis is placed on the uses of the crude glycerol as feedstock/co-feedstock for renewable energy generation as shown in Fig. 1. The authors consider this the most practical solution for the residual glycerol from biodiesel production as costly refining processes can be avoided and an addition of crude glycerol to biomass generally improves the yield of energies such as biogas, bio-oil, hydrogen and alcohols through co-digestion, co-gasification, co-pyrolysis, co-liquefaction and steam refining, etc."
1,Biodiesel production and crude glycerol properties,"Biodiesel refers to a fatty acid alkyl esters mixture generated when vegetable oils or animal fats are transesterified with short chain alcohols. It is viewed by many as the eventual replacement for diesel oil, as it is better for environment and health, as well as engine performance [1,3]. In the transesterification process as shown in Fig. 2, one mole of vegetable oil, chemically, triglyceride reacts with three moles of alcohol in the presence of a catalyst and undergoes three sequential reactions to yield one mole of glycerol and three moles of biodiesel, chemically, fatty acid alkyl esters. The products consist of about 1kg of glycerol for every 9kg of biodiesel produced [19]. Further refining of the fatty acid alkyl esters leaves a mixture consisting mostly of glycerol, with catalyst salts, unreacted mono/di/triglycerides, and water all left over from the reaction process. The composition of the crude glycerol can vary drastically depending on various reaction conditions, as well as the extent to which the crude glycerol is refined by the biodiesel plant. The percentage of glycerol present in the crude glycerol can vary from as low as 45% to upwards of 90% [20,21]. Because of the wide variation in composition of crude glycerol, it is difficult to summarize its properties. Chemical and physical properties of its main component, glycerol, are briefly summarized in Table 1."
2,Energy uses,
3,Fermentation,"3.1 Fermentation One of the most studied approaches of using crude glycerol is fermentation. Glycerol can be used as the carbon source for a growth medium, and be fermented to produce alcohol, hydrogen, and other products via bacteria and/or yeast. Because of its biological nature, fermentation requires much lower temperatures than what is often required in many other conversion processes discussed in the following sections. However, the growth mediums required are often very specific and costly, and may offset the energy cost savings accrued due to the lower temperatures. 3.1.1 Alcohol A wide variety of yeast and bacteria can be used in the fermentation of glycerol. Two common products are ethanol and/or butanol which are important biofuels. A summary of the studies conducted on the conversion of crude glycerol to alcohol via fermentation is shown in Table 2. Ethanol, due to its popularity as a fuel, is commonly the desired product of fermentation. Pachysolen tannophilus CBS4044, Klebsiella pneumoniae GEM167, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli have all been used to produce ethanol [22–26]. Liu et al. [22] used the yeast P. tannophilus CBS4044 and achieved the highest total ethanol production (28.1g/L) of any microbial process at the time, but the productivity of the process was still very low in comparison to bacteria based production. Oh et al. [23] irradiated K. pneumoniae to produce a mutated strain which greatly enhanced ethanol production to 20.5g/L. Meyer et al. [25] found that after removing the non-glycerol organic matter from the crude glycerol, it was able to be fermented to ethanol by E. aerogenes at room temperature, reducing energy costs. Recently, significant efforts were made on genetic engineering of strains. For example, Thapa et al. [27] engineered a mutant strain, E. aerogenes SUMI014, which was able to block the formation of lactic acid and thus enhanced ethanol production. Loaces et al. [28] used E. coli with expression of heterologous genes and improved glycerol conversion, and the ethanol production rate was 0.39gh−1 OD−1 L−1. Kata et al. [29] cloned the genes of PDC1 and ADH1 to thermotolerant yeast, Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha, and the fermentation was conducted at relatively high temperature (45–28°C), resulting in increased fermentation rate. Ethanol is not the only product obtained from the fermentation of glycerol, as hydrogen is often produced simultaneously. Shams Yazdani and Gonzalez [26] engineered E. coli strains to convert glycerol to ethanol more efficiently, with additional benefits to either formate or hydrogen production. Maru et al. [30] conducted dark fermentation using co-culture of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. and obtained both ethanol and hydrogen at high yields. Valle et al. [31,32] established an experimental method for screening E coli single mutants to identify the strains with enhanced ability for hydrogen/ethanol production, unfortunately, the ethanol and hydrogen yields were not provided om theses papers. Valuable results of ethanol/hydrogen production at a pilot scale were provided by the work conducted by Cofré et al. [33], indicating the promise of scaling up this process. Varrone et al. [21] assessed the economic practicality of joint ethanol and hydrogen production from crude glycerol using a highly specific microbial mixed culture which required no yeast extract, tryptone, or minerals/vitamins, which made it highly competitive with traditional carbohydrate fermentation. They demonstrated that computed energy cost was estimated to be 0.019 €/kW hth and 0.057/kE hel for 26g/L of ethanol and retention time of 120h. Research focusing on the production of hydrogen through fermentation is discussed in greater detail in the following Section 3.1.2. Butanol and 1, 3-propanediol (1, 3-PDO) are also commonly co-produced from fermenting glycerol with the use of Clostridium pasteurianum. Butanol is an emerging new generation of biofuel and has drawn increasing attention due to its interesting properties such as higher energy density and low volatility compared to ethanol. Gallardo et al. [34] examined the effect of crude glycerol, butyrate, and acetate concentrations on butanol yield during the fermentation of crude glycerol by C. pasteurianum DSM. It was found that higher crude glycerol concentrations favored butanol production over 1, 3-PDO, and butyrate and acetate supplementation increased butanol titre, but butyrate significantly decreased fermentation time. Khanna et al. [35] produced butanol, 1, 3-propanediol, and ethanol from glycerol using Clostridium pasteurianum MTCC 116. It was found that immobilized cells performed much better than free cells, and the use of crude glycerol had no negative effect on cellular morphology, but crude glycerol resulted in only traces amounts of ethanol. Most recently, Johnson and Rehmann [36] converted crude glycerol to butanol using Clostridium pasteurianum, and a maximum butanol yield of 0.29g/g glycerol (or 0.36mol/mol) was achieved. Lin et al. added butyrate as a precursor and combined with an in situ butanol removal via vacuum membrane distillation, leading to an increase in the butanol yield from 0.24 to 0.39mol/mol glycerol, using Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 [37]. 3.1.2 Hydrogen Hydrogen production through the fermentation of glycerol is favorable, as hydrogen is clean, has a very high energy density, and the only by-product is water. It has received increasing attention. The conversion of crude glycerol to hydrogen can be done through two different forms of fermentation known as dark fermentation and photofermentation. Dark fermentation uses a variety of microbes, usually isolated from soil samples, such as Klebsiella sp., Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium butyricum, Thermotoga neapolitana, or a collection of various microbes [38,39]. The microbial culture is then added to a glycerol medium, containing waste glycerol, nutrients (compounds containing nitrogen and potassium etc.), and/or yeast, in an anaerobic environment at around temperature of 30–40°C. It has been observed that many of these strains actually perform better with crude glycerol, due to the benefits of the impurities [40,41]. Zahedi et al. [42] found that adding crude glycerol to industrial municipal solid waste nearly doubled the yield of hydrogen through a dark fermentation using Eubacteria and Archaea. Trchounian and Trchounian et al. [43] systematically reviewed the performance of E coli in the hydrogen generation and stated that metabolic engineering of E.coli was able to improve hydrogen production. A comparison between E. coli and other bacteria in terms of fermentation conditions and production efficiency was provided [44]. An interesting finding was that the fermentation of mixed carbon sources (glycerol and other agriculture/food wastes) enhanced hydrogen production. For example, they investigated the co-fermentation of formate and glycerol [45,46], co-fermentation of acetate and glycerol [47], co-fermentation of glucose and glycerol [48]. This group also investigated the effect of types and concentrations of heavy metals on hydrogen yield and E coli growth rate [49]. Pachapur et al. [50] added a surfactant to a co-culture of Entero bacter aerogenes and Clostridium butyricum and enhanced hydrogen production from crude glycerol. Kumar et al. [51] used Bacillus thuringiensis EGU45H-2 on fermentation of crude glycerol and achieved a yield of 0.393mol/mol feed. Faber and Ferreira-Leitão [52] optimized the conditions of dark fermentation of residual glycerol, and the yield and productivity of hydrogen were improved by 68% and 67% respectively compared to those in theory. Photofermentation also produces hydrogen from waste glycerol, but as the name implies, requires a light source. The most popular enzyme used in photofermentation is Rhodopseudomonas palustris with waste glycerol in a nutrient solution. Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck [53] used both pure glycerol and crude glycerol as feedstock to generate hydrogen and obtained 6molH2 /mole glycerol and no obvious inhibition observed. Pott et al. [54] found that using R. palustris, with a growth rate of 0.074h−1, glycerol was converted into 97mol% hydrogen at a conversion efficiency nearing 90% at a rate of 34mLH2/gdw/h; However, inhibition of growth by impurities from crude glycerol was observed. Ghosh et al. [55,56] and Liu et al. [41] have made continuous efforts on photo fermentation of crude glycerol for hydrogen production. They applied RSM to investigate the interactive effects of process parameters such as light intensity, concentration of glycerol and level of glutamate as well as the effect of nitrogen source on hydrogen yield. Zhang et al. [57] used a modelling method to simulate the entire growth phase of R. palustris to maximize hydrogen production. A few interesting attempts have evaluated the possibility of using both dark and photofermentation in a two-stage process. Chookaew et al. [39,58] conducted on-going research on hydrogen production from crude glycerol and recently experimented with a two stage fermentation process involving dark fermentation followed by photofermentation [59]. The two stages used Klebsiella sp. TR17 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris TN1, respectively. It was found that the optimal conditions for photofermentation were when no supplementary yeast was used, glutamate was added, and the effluent was diluted. Under these conditions, the overall the total hydrogen production from the two-stage process was 6.42mmol/g chemical oxygen demand (COD), which was 10.4% of the theoretical yield. Sarma et al. [60] also evaluated the technical and economic aspects of biohydrogen production from crude glycerol using dark fermentation followed by photofermentation. Based on maximum production and yield values found at publication of the paper, they concluded that 1kg of crude glycerol could be converted to the equivalent of 2.56L of fossil diesel fuel, but cost $330 to produce. 82% of the production cost was growth media components, and it is therefore necessary to reduce those costs in order to make fermentation of this kind feasible. It was also concluded that fermentation of waste glycerol was very beneficial for the environment, as the conversion of 1kg of crude glycerol reduces 7.66kg of greenhouse gas. These studies are summarized in Table 3. It is worthwhile to point out that microbial fuel cells are a technology commonly combined with hydrogen production. Sharma et al. [61] produced bioenergy from hydrogen producing bioreactors (HPBs) and microbial fuel cells (MFCs). It was found that the impurities in crude glycerol significantly hampered energy production in MFCs when compared to pure glycerol, and that the production of hydrogen and 1, 3-propanediol in a HPB was much more profitable. Chookaew et al. [39] experimented with a combined process consisting of dark fermentation, followed by MFC or MEC reactors. Effluent from the fermentation was fed into the MFC or MEC reactors. The MFCs had a maximum power density of 92mW/m2 when fed 100% effluent, and removed 49.1–50.2% of COD. The MECs fed 50% diluted effluent had a yield of 106.14±8.5mL H2/g COD consumed at 1.0V applied voltage. Detailed reviews on MFCs are not included in this paper. To summarize, in the microbial fermentation of crude glycerol to energy products, the key is to develop more efficient enzymes, involving the development of new strains, genetic engineering of existing strains, improvement of selectivity and durability of strains, particularly higher tolerance of VFA and impurities in glycerol. For example, the ethanol/butanol production was improved significantly using mutant strains like metabolic engineering E coli, or stains with expression of heterologous genes. Regarding hydrogen production, genetically modified strains changed the metabolic pathways and enhanced the energy productivity. Impurities in crude glycerol do impact the yield, can be positive or negative, new technology should be developed to effectively utilize impurities. Moreover, mixing crude glycerol with other carbon sources has great potential to increase the yield of energy products. Additional benefits are reduction of logistics costs associated with biowaste transportation and better and more effective utilization/disposal of different biowastes. More research is needed to evaluate the best combination of crude glycerol and other organic waste. Design and use of novel bioreactors which are able to facilitate in situ removal of products is another strategy to improve overall production. Optimization of operation conditions (pH value, temperature and substrate concentration etc.) is essential to improve the production efficiency. A suitable pH value has to strike a balance between bacteria growth rate and energy production rate. Another challenging issue is an accumulation of by-product such as volatile fatty acids resulting from fermentation might inhibit activity of bacteria. This can be solved by two stage fermentation, such as integrated systems (hybrid), combination of dark fermentation and photofermentation and application of combination of different bacteria strains. Although the current yield of these energy products are low, improvements on above mentioned technology would overcome these limitations, and microbial fermentation is expected to be promising for utilization of crude glycerol generated from biodiesel production."
4,Digestion,"3.2 Digestion Another popular method of disposal of waste glycerol is through co-digestion to produce biogas [19,67–78]. Co-digestion involves the decomposition of crude glycerol along with biomass (usually sewage sludge or manure) by a microbial community at mild temperatures to produce methane and hydrogen. The waste glycerol is highly beneficial to the digestion process, as it significantly increases biogas (methane and hydrogen) production. This is because the waste glycerol improves the organic loading rate (OLR), is highly biodegradable, reduces the ammonia concentration, and improves the carbon to nitrogen ratio. The digested sludge can sometimes be suitable as a fertilizer as well. Baba et al. [67] evaluated the methane energy balance of co-digestion of crude glycerol and sludge at a practical scale (5–75L/30m3/day for 1.5 years) and found that the energy output was 106% equivalent to energy input and the digested sludge applied as fertilizer increased grass field yields by 20%. Research [68] on the mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of primary sewage sludge and glycerol was conducted, and the optimal glycerol loading was in the range of 25–60% OLR resulting in biogas production increase by 82–280%. However, under 70% glycerol of OLR, inhibition was observed. Athanasoulia et al. [69] used a CSTR reactor and conducted mesophilic digestion. The biogas production was improved by 3.8–4.7 times when the glycerol addition was less than 4% (v/v). The effects of glyceryl addition on biogas yield at a pilot scale [70] were examined and found that a low glycerol dose (0.63% v/v) was preferable and the additional methanol yield was 1.3m3/L crude glycerol. Rivero et al. [71] introduced a two-phase digestion process and the optimal operational conditions were identified to be OLR of 7.82g COD/L d, with a removal of 93% CODr and hydrogen and methane yields of 0.026 LH2/gCODr and 0.29 LCH4/gCODr, respectively. Silvestre et al. [72] conducted more detailed research on the effects of the C/H ratio on biogas production under both thermophilic and mesophilic co-digestion. They found that addition of glycerol to sewage sludge could effectively balance C/H ratio, however, no improvement on biogas yield was observed when glycerol content was beyond 1% v/v in the influent. Process kinetics and microbial dynamics [73] were investigated in such a co-digestion process of sewage sludge and glycerol. Research indicated that the synergisms between glycerol and sludge did benefit the co-digestion process, 2% v/v glycerol dosing struck a good balance between increasing organic loading rate and minimizing impact on hydraulic retention time. Co-digestion of glycerol and manure also showed a lot of promise. Astals et al. [74] had early demonstrated that the specific biogas production of the co-digester was 180% higher than the mono-digestion under mesophilic conditions when pig manure was co-digested with 3% v/v of glycerol, on a wet basis. This increase was mainly attributed to an improved organic loading rate and a balanced C/N ratio. However, the digestate cannot be directly used as soil fertilizers or conditioner due to the presence of high levels of biodegradable matter [74,76]. Fierro et al. [75] investigated co-designation of swine manure and glycerol with an emphasis on the effects of glycerol concertation on inhibition. They found that an addition of glycerol up to 8% v/v caused a system failure due to high concentration of H2S and VFA, and thus a post-stabilization stage was necessary to achieve a complete degradation of proteins and lipids. In the research conducted by Angenent and Usak's research group [77,78], glycerol was co-digested with dairy manure for more than 900 days using a continuously stirred anaerobic reactor at mesophilic temperatures. Methane yield was 549±25mL CH4 gVS−1 at a total OLR of 3.2gVSL−1 Day−1 and the co-digestion process was disrupted by floatation and foaming issues. Table 4 provides a summary of these studies. Using crude glycerol as a co-substrate in anaerobic digestion for biogas production is extremely attractive due to the demonstrated improvement in biogas yield and potential of transportation costs reduction. However, overloading of glycerol can cause imbalances in the digester, which can lead to inefficiencies and failures. Generally, high glycerol loadings are acceptable if glycerol additions are controlled in order to allow the bacterial community to adjust properly. Application of a two-stage digestion is also beneficial, using acidogenic digester and methanogenic digester in sequence, which could better control bacteria population and reduce the impact of acids on methane generation. Future efforts should be focused on the optimization of digestion parameters and digester operations, including organic loading rate, C/N ratio, retention time control on acidogenic stage and methanogenic stage and bacterial community structure etc."
5,Gasification,"3.3 Gasification Gasification refers to the thermochemical decomposition of organic material under high temperatures to produce a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and light hydrocarbon gasses, termed as syngas, or producer gas. Crude glycerol has been used frequently as an additive in the gasification of biomass to improve gas yields and the hydrogen fraction of the produced gas [79–86]. Đurišić-Mladenović et al. [10] recently reviewed co-gasification of crude glycerol and olive kernel, and compared with other thermochemical methods using principal component analysis (PCA) method. They stated that the mixture of glycerol and olive kernel was a generally favorable combination for syngas production. Skoulou and Zabaniotou [79] co-gasified glycerol with olive kernel in a fixed bed reactor at 750–850°C with mixing levels of 24wt%, 32wt% and 49wt% respectively. It was found that the syngas yield increased from 0.4 to 1.2Nm3/kg for a mixture with 49wt% of glycerol in biomass, and hydrogen concertation was also improved significantly. Wei et al. [80] examined the co-gasification of hardwood chips and crude glycerol in a pilot scale downdraft gasifier and an addition of 20% glycerol in woodchip led to high quality fuel gas suitable for internal combustion engines. Yoon et al. [81] gasified crude glycerol in an entrained flow gasifier at 950–1500°C using air or oxygen air, giving carbon conversion of 92% and HHV of syngas 2500kcal/Nm3. This group further attempted the microwave plasma gasification of glycerol for syngas production. It was observed that higher production of syngas (57% hydrogen and 35% CO) could be achieved, the fraction of syngas decreased as the oxygen-to-fuel ratio increased and atomization of glycerol using a nozzle improved the efficiency of the gasification process [82]. Valliyappan et al. [83] gasified glycerol in a fixed bed reactor at 800°C in the presence of commercial catalyst Ni/Al2O3, and 68.4% syngas was produced. Cengiz et al. [84] conducted hydrothermal gasification of glycerol with a focus on the impact of acid and base catalyst on the yield of syngas, and the effectiveness of catalyst on gasification was demonstrated in the order of K3PO4 > K2HPO4 > H3PO4 > KH2PO4 for crude glycerol. Gasification under supercritical water conditions was further explored by Yang et al. [85]. The optimum reaction conditions were 500°C, 7wt% glycerol concentration and 2.39mol/L KOH concentration and H2 mole fraction yield in the gaseous product was 27.9±0.22mol%. Dianninggrum et al. [86] gasified crude glycerol at in both batch and continuous apparatus under similar operational conditions and found that complete gasification was obtained under in the continuous mode. A number of gasification studies have been summarized in Table 5. Many research examined gasification under supercritical water using pure glycerol as feedstock, which is not included in this review. In this proven option for glycerol disposal and utilization, co-gasification of glycerol and other feedstock was able to improve the yield of syngas or hydrogen considerably. Gasification performance is highly associated with operational parameters such as residence time, temperature and pressure etc. Particularly, the mode of reactor plays a vital role for commercial scale application. Most commonly used reactors include updraft fixed bed, downdraft fixed and fluidized bed etc. Depending on the principal components in the feedstock mixture, proper reaction conditions and gasifier would be applied."
6,Pyrolysis,"3.4 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is another thermochemical conversion process similar to gasification but with a focus on bio-oil production. It generates gas, bio-oil, and char, three product streams, through the decomposition of biomass at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. The difference between the two methods is that in gasification, higher temperatures are used, so the char produced in the pyrolysis stage is further converted to syngas. Manara and Zabaniotou [87] demonstrated that co-pyrolysis of crude glycerol with lignite could be a source for H2 production. For a blend of 20wt% glycerol with lignite, a high hydrogen yield of 65.44v/v% was obtained. Delgado et al. [88] co-pyrolysed glycerol and corn straw and found that suitable ratios were 3:1 or 1:1 for high oil and gas yield with great heating values. Dou et al. [89] found that water and methanol existing in crude glycerol acted as catalysts in pyrolysis and decreased the activation energy of the decomposition of glycerol, demonstrating crude glycerol a very promising additive. Xiu et al. [90] performed a co-pyrolysis of swine manure and crude glycerol in a high-pressure batch reactor under various mixing ratios to produce bio-oil. They stated that the oil yield increased dramatically by adding crude glycerol as a co-substrate and the key contributor to this improvement was free fatty acid component in the crude glycerol. The maximum oil yield of 68% was obtained at a swine manure to crude glycerol ratio of 1:3 (weight ratio). Skoulou et al. [91] conducted pyrolysis of a mixture of 25wt% glycerol and 75wt% olive kernel at a temperature of 720°C and obtained the pyrolysis gas with H2 concentration of 11.6% v/v. Within the same research group, Ganesapillai et al. [92] investigated the co-pyrolysis of glycerol and olive kernel under microwave pre-treatment of feedstock. A high liquid yield of 59.53% v/v and enriched syngas (H2+CO) concentration (84.9% v/v) were obtained. The improvement in the bio-oil quality and quantity was observed in co-pyrolysis of glycerol with lignocellulosic biomass and manure in these studies as summarized in Table 6. Co-pyrolysis is undoubtedly a promising option, however, more detailed research is necessary to identify the mechanism for energy production enhancement. In addition, the operation parameters need to be optimized according to the target energy product, bio-oil or pyrolysis gas."
7,Liquefaction,"3.5 Liquefaction Liquefaction is a thermochemical process in which biomass is converted to a bio-oil with an improved heating value under moderately high temperatures but relatively high pressures. Crude glycerol can be mixed with other sources of biomass as the substrate of the co-liquefaction. Xiu and his co-worker conducted considerable research on co-liquefaction of glycerol with manure [93–96]. In 2011, a co-liquefaction was first carried out at a temperature range of 260–360°C and a retention time of 5–90min [93]. Under the optimal conditions (glycerol and manure ratio of 3, temperature of 340°C and residence time of 15min), the oil yield was 68%, increased by 1.83 times (g/g dry matter) compared to the process without glycerol addition. This improvement was attributed to the catalytic effect of alkali salts and glycerol acting as a hydrogen-donor to stabilize the radical fragments in the liquefaction process and therefore less char was formed. Further research also found that addition of crude glycerol as a co-substrate lowered the pH value, increased hydrogen content in the bio-oil and also decreased undesirable solid content. GC-MS analysis indicated that the acidic compounds in the oil derived from manure alone were converted into methyl esters through esterification reactions occurred between methanol and FFA, implying the occurrence of cross/interactive reactions in the co-liquefaction process [94]. Possible reaction pathways of co-liquefaction were explored by performing liquefaction of manure with individual glycerol, methanol, and fatty acids respectively. They found that fatty acid, glycerol and methanol, all of those had positive impact on bio-oil generation. It was speculated that acid-catalyzed esterification reactions occurred not only because the crude glycerol had methanol, but also because methanol could be produced from hydrothermal reactions of glycerol [95]. Cheng et al. [96] further characterized the properties of bio-oil derived from co-liquefaction of swine manure and glycerol, and made a comparison with properties of bio-oil obtained from the liquefaction of swine manure alone and pyrolysis of corn stover. Generally, the crude bio-oil had a higher distillation temperature of 498.8°C compared to a distillation temperature of 350.4°C for diesel and 177.8°C for gasoline. Except the first 10% fraction had a significant amount of water, HHV of the rest eight fractions were in the range of 37.16 MJ/kg to 45.38 MJ/kg. The pH value of bio-oil was close to neutral. The bio-oil contained large amounts of different esters. Pedersen et al. [97] co-liquefied crude glycerol and aspen wood. They observed that the char yield decreased significantly with increasing the ratio of glycerol and aspen wood, and the quality of bio-oil was improved with a H/C ratio of 1.6. The same group recently developed a continuous process of co-liquefaction of aspen wood and glycerol, demonstrating a significant progress made, moving to the production of bio-oil at a large scale [98]. A summary of studies done on co-liquefaction is provided in Table 7. In general, the addition of crude glycerol in to other biomass in liquefaction increases the yield of bio-oil, due to the synergistically positive effects of methanol, glycerol, water, and some fatty acids on oil yield. Crude glycerol also lowers the pH value, decreases undesirable solid content, and produces a higher hydrogen content in gaseous stream. However, it is also found this process requires high temperature and pressure and the resulting oil has a lower carbon content. Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process involving many possible reactions such as hydrolysis, dehydration, dehydrogenation, esterification and re-polymerization etc., and the reaction pathways are currently not well understood. Further process optimization has to strike a good balance between yield and quality of bio-oil to maximize the economic viability."
8,Combustion,"3.6 Combustion One of the seemingly simplest methods to dispose of crude glycerol is through combustion [3,4,99–101]. However, it proves difficult to combust on its own [99] due to glycerol's low heating value, high self-ignition temperature, acrolein formation, high viscosity, high emissions, and salt content. Several researchers have developed high swirl refractory burners for use in the combustion of crude glycerol [99,100]. While combustion was possible, emissions were significantly higher when compared to other feedstocks. Use of crude glycerol in fuel briquettes made from wood cutting waste was also examined [101]. At the optimal loading of 10% crude glycerol, low CO, SO2, NOX emissions were observed. A larger concentration of glycerol in solid fuel was not detrimental to the environment, but had a negative impact on the mechanical and physical properties of solid fuels. Generally speaking, this method was not favorable from both environment and combustor performance perspectives."
9,Steam reforming for hydrogen generation,"3.7 Steam reforming for hydrogen generation Steam reforming involves the reaction of glycerol with steam at high temperatures in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The desired product of steam reforming is hydrogen gas. Most research focused on steam reforming of pure glycerol as reviewed by Schwengbe et al. [102]. Little research has been attempted using crude glycerol, most likely due to the adverse effects of impurities on catalyst behavior. Table 8 shows technical details of limited research on this topic reported in the literature [103–109]. Slinn et al. [106] examined the viability of crude glycerol reforming for hydrogen generation with platinum alumina as a catalyst. The optimum conditions were 880°C, 0.12mol/min glycerol per kg of catalyst and 2.5 steam/carbon ratio. Reforming catalysts lasted for several days of continuous operation with a certain degree of degradation observed, 2% of feed deposited as carbon. The yield of hydrogen was 70% of that obtained from pure glycerol reforming. The decrease in yield resulted from the chain fatty acid impurities, which were more likely to form carbon. The research conducted by Fermoso et al. [105] showed a great potential to directly convert crude glycerol into hydrogen. The process yielded H2 up to 88% with a very high purity (99.7vol%) at atmospheric pressure, temperature of 550–600°C and a steam/C of 3 in a fixed-bed reactor using a mixture of Ni/Co as catalyst and dolomite as a CO2 sorbent. Dou's research group conducted on-going studies on steam reforming of glycerol [103,104,107]. For example, crude glycerol was reformed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor with an in situ CO2 sorption under temperature of 400–700°C. This in situ CO2 sorption was demonstrated to remove CO2 effectively and the purity of hydrogen was 88% [103]. They also investigated the performance of different catalysts such as Ni-Cu-Al, Ni-Cu-Mg, Ni-Mg in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure within a temperature range from 450 to 650°C [104]. Experimental results showed that the Ni-Cu-Al catalyst containing NiO of 29.2wt%, CuO of 31.1wt%, Al2O3 of 39.7wt% performed with a high catalytic activity, the H2 selectivity was found to be 92.9% and conversion of glycerol was up to 90.9% at 650°C. Remón et al. [108] examined the effect of acetic acid, methanol and potassium hydroxide on the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol. They later introduced a two-step process for hydrogen production. The crude glycerol was first purified with acetic acid to reduce problematical impurities, and then went through a catalytic steam reforming process. The optimum conditions for H2 production was at a temperature of 680°C, a glycerol solution of 37wt% and a spatial time of 3g catalyst min/g glycerol. Under such conditions, the carbon conversion to gas was 95%, with a composition: 67vol%H2, 22vol% CO2, 11vol% CO and 1vol% CH4 [109]. Steam reforming of surplus glycerol represents a candidate method for hydrogen production. Here catalysts play a dominant role. The impurities in crude glycerol is the greatest challenge, negatively impacting the activity and durability of catalyst. In addition, glycerol decomposition formed carbon and deactivated catalysts. More research should be focused on catalyst development. In-situ CO2 sorption is a mature technology and its application in steam reforming of glycerol definitely drives the reaction in the forward direction, and improves the purity of final hydrogen product. An alternative method of reforming glycerol is through the use of supercritical water, which is gaining popularity recently. Supercritical water is water subjected to temperatures above 374°C and pressures above 22.1MPa. Under these conditions, water acts both as an organic material solvent and a reactant for radical reactions. In this state, water can react with crude glycerol to produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and light hydrocarbons. Many different reactors and catalysts have been used in the production of hydrogen from glycerol using supercritical water, but mainly with pure glycerol [110]. As in many methods, impurities in the crude glycerol can affect catalyst behavior. However, unlike conventional steam reforming, supercritical water is capable of converting glycerol to hydrogen and other products without the use of transition metal catalyst, and the presence of salts does not impact conversion negatively, which means the use of crude glycerol is possible under the supercritical condition of water. Table 9 outlines the studies focusing on the conversion of crude glycerol to various products under supercritical water. Yu-Wu et al. [111] reformed crude glycerol with and without catalyst (K2CO3 1.5wt%) at a temperature of 600°C and pressure of 25MPa, and the 10mol hydrogen/kg glycerol was obtained. Bennekom et al. [112] looked at the suitable catalysts for glycerol reforming in supercritical water. Without a catalyst, the conversion of glycerol was 40%. All catalysts tested Pt/CeZrO2, Ni/ZrO2. Ni/CaO-6Al2O3, NiCu/CeZrO2, and CuZn alloy significantly promoted the decomposition of glycerol, but also the water-gas shift reaction [113]. The performance of bimetallic Pt-Ni/ Al2O3 catalyst in crude glycerol reforming was tested as well [114]. The catalyst was very active, however deactivated rapidly. In the work conducted by Onwudili and Williams [115], the reaction was carried out in a batch reactor at temperatures between 300−450°C and pressures between 8.5MPaand 31MPa. The gas product constituted 90vol% of hydrogen, equivalent to 18.9% moles of hydrogen per mole of carbon in the feed. Steam reforming of crude glycerol is challenging and it is still far to a real application."
10,Others,"3.8 Others Another potential use for the crude glycerol is in the production of fuel additives [16,116–121]. Reactions with alcohols, isobutylene, or acetone, usually in the presence of a catalyst, can produce diesel fuel additives which improve viscosity and cold flow properties, and decrease emissions [116–119]. These additives can often be added to biodiesel to help meet regulatory standards, making it an attractive method of disposing of biodiesel waste [119]. Table 10 outlines the production processes and benefits of these additives, including glycerol ethers, tertbutyl alcohol, solketal and acetyl methanol etc."
11,Non-energy uses,"Pure glycerol has many non-energy uses in the cosmetics and food industries, but due to the high standards required of these products, the use of crude glycerol in place of pure glycerol is often not possible. Despite this, there are several non-energy uses in which crude glycerol, has been found to be acceptable, and are briefly reviewed hereby. 1, 3-propanediol, produced in the fermentation of crude glycerol has many non-energy uses [15,17,122–124]. It is most commonly used in the production of polyesters, but has a variety of uses in food, cosmetics, and medicines. Another popular use of crude glycerol is as an additive in animal feed [125]. Studies have found that crude glycerol is a suitable energy source for pigs and laying hens, providing additional calories to the diet, while having no noticeable negative impacts when mixed with other feeds [126,127]. Use of crude glycerol as a growth medium for fungal biomass which could be utilized as animal feed has also been examined [128]. In addition to the desired eicosapentaenoic acid, the biomass was also rich in essential amino acids and made an excellent feed. However, the yield was quite low due to soap and methanol presence. Crude glycerol can also be used in the production of polyols and polyurethane foams. The crude glycerol can be employed as a solvent in the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass, and performs comparably to petrochemical-based solvents [129–131]. It was found that the organic impurities, such as FFAs and FAMEs, discovered in the crude glycerol had positive influences on the foam produced [129]."
12,Conclusions and recommendations,"With the growing production of biodiesel in the coming years, managing the crude glycerol produced will become an increasingly difficult task. Although the development of glycerol-free biodiesel production is making progress significantly [132,133], implementation of these processes at a large scale still faces a number of challenges such as high costs, low efficiency, immaturity of relevant technologies, and involvement of sensitive enzyme etc. It is crucial to wisely utilize this waste stream generated from current biodiesel production practices. The production of value-added products/chemicals/polymers from crude glycerol holds promise, but generally are not economically viable as the residual glycerol from biodiesel production contains considerable amounts of impurities, and the refining costs offset the profits from the highly valuable products. Most of these methods are still on a small scale and/or only work well for pure glycerol, and the real costs of production are uncertain. The production of renewable energy such as hydrogen, syngas, biogas, alcohol and bio-oil offers a promising method of glycerol disposal and increasing the profitability of biodiesel production. Most of these conversion processes use biowastes or low-value biomass, and thus the impurities in the unrefined glycerol present less negative impact or very often positive impact on the production as reviewed in this paper. For example, in the processes of co-digestion, co-fermentation, co-liquefaction and co-gasification of glycerol and other biomass, the yield or/and quality of the target energy product were improved. The future efforts should focus on optimization of feedstock combinations, development of catalyst and biocatalyst being less inhibited by the impurities in crude glycerol, and exploration of the optimal operation process parameters, in order to better use the crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production. More engineering research is essential to provide practical solutions to the challenges related to commercialization of these processes."
