0,Introduction,"Currently, electrospinning technique has been stablished as one of the best and most practicable approaches for the design and development of many smart materials based on polymer fibers at the sub-micro and nano scales [1–3]. This technique is simple and provides a feasible way to produce solid or hollow nano (diameter < 100 nm) and ultrathin fibers (1000 nm > diameter > 100 nm), which may present varied compositions. One-dimensional electrospun fibers present notable lengths and uniform diameters, which arise from the elongation of a viscoelastic jet from a polymer solution or melt [4]. Over the last decade, carbon-based luminescent materials have attracted much attention due to their unique properties, such as high luminescence, chemical inertness, and relatively easy preparation following appropriate routes [5–8]. In this class of materials, we can cite nanodiamonds [9] and carbon quantum dots (QDs) [5,10] as two of the most representative materials. Photoluminescent QDs have drawn an increasing attention due to their excellent optical and electronic properties, besides high photochemical stability [10–12]. QDs’ properties are tunable, which makes them suitable for biomedical applications, mainly in bioimaging and bioanalysis [13]. Nevertheless, more recently, a novel highly luminescent class of material, named graphene quantum dots (GQDs), started to attract a great deal of attention, mainly for biomedical pursuits [7,8]. Researchers found out that when graphene “shrinks” to the zero-dimension (materials with dimensions at the nanoscale), it becomes fluorescent [14]. In this context, the so-called GQDs have received a great deal of attention due to their excellent optical-electronic and structural properties. Moreover, GQDs present a wide range of applications due to a unique combination of properties, such as: adjustable photoluminescent properties, excellent photo-stability, biocompatibility, molecular size and easiness to be chemically combined with other biomolecules without compromising its properties [7,10,14,15]. To date, the production of GQDs has been explored from different “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches. Nevertheless, most “top-down” approaches have serious drawbacks, such as the requirements of special equipment, low yields, critical synthesis conditions and difficult controlling of the GQDs size [16]. The “bottom-up” strategies consist mainly of organic precursors carbonization via thermal methods, which lead to a more precise control on the morphology and size distribution of the final products [17,18]. However, these precursors are frequently obtained via complex synthetic routes, which often lead to long and expensive processes. In the opposite direction, many researchers have recently explored the production of GQDs from abundant, cost-effective, simpler and natural precursors, such as citric acid [16,19] and glucose [20]. Citric acid, which is the major component of all citric fruits, has a wide range of applications, e.g., as a powerful agent for preservation, pH control, chelation and coagulation [21]. Since citric acid has been approved by FDA as a food additive, its use has been widely spread in many branches of the food industry [21]. However, citric acid use is still underexplored in many academic fields. Regarding the conversion of citric-acid to GQDs, the majority of the currently known routes is based on hydrothermal [22], microwave-assisted [19] and carbonization routes [16]. In this work, citric acid was used as the precursor for the preparation of GQDs, via an easy bottom-up method based on the incomplete carbonization of citric acid. The method proposed herein was based and adapted from the report by Dong et al. [16], including some modifications along the steps. Electrospun-based sensors have many desirable qualities, such as high surface/volume ratio and porous 3D structures, which make these substrates ideal environments for optical sensing. Due to all aforementioned properties of QDs, these materials have attracted much attention for the development of optical sensors, which are recognizably simple, rapidly responsibly and highly sensitive [23,24]. Thus, several strategies have been reported on the fabrication of sensor systems based on the changes in fluorescence intensity of QDs solutions in the presence of several analytes [13,24]. However, it is well known that optical sensors film-based have greater advantages over the solution-based ones, such as recyclability, better repeatability and possibility to perform high-throughput detections [25,26]. In this framework, QDs filled electrospun fibers have been recently produced via electrospinning technique for (bio)-sensing purposes [26,27]. Recently, Tan, et al. [27] reported on the production of electrospun polycaprolactone/CdSe quantum dots/fibers as an optical probe highly sensitive for H2O2. In the electrochemical field, Yang, et al. [28] reported on a biosensor based on electrospun fibers combined with (reduced graphene oxide QDs)/ZnO for the detection of intracellular H2O2 released from cancer and normal cells. Not only limited to the sensing field, other applications should be highlighted, e.g., the preparation of symmetrical supercapacitors from conducting nanofibers composed of PVA, GQDs and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) [29]; luminescent materials from PVA containing coal-derived GQDs for light emitting diodes and other optoelectronic applications [30]. In this investigation, we have approached for the first time, a simple, fast and low-cost method for the production of fluorescent hybrid fibers from the electrospinning of solutions of PVA and water-soluble GQDs from the incomplete carbonization of citric acid. The findings in this paper open up many possible applications of these materials, where the combination of easy processability, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness is required."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Mo): Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA, Mw 89,000-98,000, 99+% hydrolyzed); Citric acid (ACS reagent, ≥ 99.5%); Hydrochloric acid (HCl, ACS reagent, 37%); Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, reagent grade, ≥ 98%); Silicon oil (Vetec, for oil baths from −50 °C to +250 °C). All aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm), obtained from an Arium® system (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany)."
3,GQDs – production and process optimization,"2.2 GQDs – production and process optimization The route for GQDs production was based on a method proposed by Dong et al. [16], which consisted in the incomplete carbonization of citric acid (CA). Initially, we selected three different carbonization times to identify an optimum one: 30, 45 and 60 min. First, a porcelain crucible containing silicon oil was heated up to 200 °C (∼50 °C higher than the citric acid melting point), which was accurately controlled using an internal thermostat. Then, a 25 mL beaker containing 2 g of CA was put inside the porcelain crucible and the temperature was carefully controlled within the range of (198–203) °C. After 3 min, the CA was completely melted and liquated (colorless). The next 25 min were followed by two different color changes: i) from colorless to yellow and ii) from yellow to orange, which implied the generation of the GQDs. After carbonization (at different times), a small aliquot of each solution was withdrawn in order to perform elemental analysis. After the desired carbonization time, the solutions were removed from the heating and 10 mL of 1 M NaOH were quickly added, which led to strong orange solutions. The resulting solutions were of low pH (<5), which was then increased stepwise to ca. 13 using the same 1 M NaOH solution, and finally adjusted to 7 using a 2 M HCl solution. During the pH adjustments, aliquots were withdrawn for UV–vis absorption and fluorescence measurements in order to assess the pH effect on the optical properties and stability of GQD."
4,Electrospinning of PVA solutions and PVA/GQDs hybrid solutions,"2.3 Electrospinning of PVA solutions and PVA/GQDs hybrid solutions Preliminary experiments were conducted to identify optimal electrospinning parameters, which are described in this section hereafter. Before electrospinning, four aqueous solutions were prepared, as follows: i) PVA solution (1.2 g in 10 mL of DI water); ii) PVA solution (1.2 g in 9 mL of DI water); iii) PVA solution (1.2 g in 8 mL of DI water) and iv) PVA solution (1.2 g in 7 mL of DI water). For all solutions, the complete dissolution was achieved after 1 h of vigorous magnetic stirring, at 95 °C. After cooling down, different volumes of a GQDs solution (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mL) were added to solutions ii), iii) and iv), respectively, which led to four solutions with final volumes of 10 mL and different GQDs’ contents. Herein, the GQDs were prepared under 45 min of carbonization (pH 7). Table 1 summarizes the solutions used in this study for electrospinning purposes. Electrospinning was carried out using a high voltage source (Spellmann CZR 1000R) operated at 20 kV. The solutions were electrospun using 23 G metallic needles, a flow rate of 0.5 mL h−1 and a needle-to-collector distance of 10 cm. A copper thin plate (6.0 cm2, negative electrode) was used as collector. Each electrospinning experiment was carried out during 30 min. In the course of all experiments, the temperature and humidity were carefully controlled in the ranges of 28–30 °C and 30–35%, respectively."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization For the measurements of UV–vis absorption and fluorescence intensity of the GQDs prepared under different carbonization times at different pHs, we used a Denovix S11 spectrophotometer and a Synergy HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 460 nm), respectively. A Horiba FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer were used to perform the fluorescence measurements of the GQDs solution and electrospun PVA/GQDs mats. SEM was performed using a ZEISS EVO MA 10 microscope. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Leica DMLB microscope coupled to a Leica DC 300F digital camera. TEM and HRTEM micrographs were performed using a JOEL JEM-2100 LaB6 TEM microscope. Elemental analysis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer “Elemental Analysis 2400”. Thermal analyses were carried out using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (model Q10, TA Instruments) and a STA 449-Jupiter® system (Netzsch)."
6,Results and discussion,"Table 2 shows the results of elemental analysis from the GQDs production (all analysis were performed immediately after the carbonization process - before adding NaOH solution). As expected, after carbonization processes, increases in the carbon contents are observed when compared to the starting citric acid. This result is a clear indication that different times led to varied carbonization degrees. Conversely, as the carbonization time increased, the oxygen content decreased. These both trends are reported in literature for the citric acid carbonization [16]. Table 2 also reports on the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the GQDs, which showed that increasing the carbonization time from 30 to 45 min enhanced the PLQY from 9.4 to 10.5%. Nevertheless, the use of a higher time, such as 60 min, led to a PLQY value considerably lower (5.2%). Based on previous studies in literature, this result may be attributed to the generation of large sheets of graphene oxide after, which have relatively low PLQY [16]. Luminescent carbon nanomaterials, with no surface passivation, usually present low PLQY values, whereas surface passivation enhances this property [6]. Thus, the values of PLQY observed in the present work indicated a high surface passivation of the GQDs, which may be attributed to the incomplete carbonization of citric acid. Conversely, increasing the carbonization time to 60 min may have contributed to the generation of low-passivated surfaces. Dong et al. [16] reported on a PLQY value of 9.0% for GQDs after 30 min of citric acid carbonization. In this work, they used a different method for the regeneration of the carbonized product and a different strategy of heating. Zhuang et al. [19] reported on a PLQY value of 3.2%, in an approach involving the generation of GQDs by the carbonization of mono-hydrated citric acid under microwave irradiation. Fig. 1 A–B shows the results of the spectrophotometric measurements (UV–vis and fluorescence) performed on the aqueous solutions of GQDs obtained at different carbonization times (30 and 45 min) under different pHs. Due to its low PLQY, the use of a long carbonization time (60 min) was no longer considered in the present investigation. Differently from the citric acid, which presents only a broad absorption under 250 nm, Fig. 1A shows that all products presented absorption bands in the UV–vis region. The use of 45 min as carbonization time led to narrower and well-defined absorption bands, which can be taken as an indication that the sp2 clusters contained inside the GQDs’ structure should be uniform in size. Conversely, the shortest time (30 min) led to broad absorption bands, which point out the non-uniformity of these same sp2 clusters. For instance, this difference could be attributed to the complex process of dehydration and polymerization of citric acid [31,32], which may have led to the generation of GQDs sheets with heterogeneous sizes. Thus, as the time increases to 45 min, the carbonization became the major process, which may have allowed for the generation of more homogeneous sheets. Fig. 1B shows that changing the pH from acid to neutral and alkaline had a major influence on the fluorescence intensities of the GQDs. These changes may be associated to the protonation and deprotonation processes of the carboxylic groups present in the GQDs edges, which in turn may also act as fluorophores [33,34]. Pan et al. [15] proposed that under acid conditions, the GQDs’ zigzag sites with the σ1 π1 ground state would be protonated; therefore, a reversible complex would be formed between H+ and these sites. As a consequence, this would result in the breakdown of the emissive triple carbene state and the fluorescence would be partially quenched [35]. Under reversible conditions, once alkaline conditions are re-established, the free zigzag sites would be restored and, consequently, the photoluminescence. From the results obtained up to this point, we have chosen 45 min as carbonization time, as well as pH 7, to carry further deeper analysis. In addition, these GQDs were further used for the preparation of hybrid PVA/GQDs solutions for electrospinning. Fig. 1C–D presents the TEM micrographs of the GQDs prepared under 45 min of carbonization. The micrographs clearly show homogeneous and uniform nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.5 ± 0.2 nm, which was considerably smaller and more regular in size and shape when compared to other studies [36,37]. Dong et al. [16], who were the pioneers in the preparation of GQDs from the carbonization of citric acid reported on nanoparticles with an average diameter of 15 nm. Zhuang et al. [19] reported on the application of microwave irradiation to mono-hydrated citric acid and showed that GQDs with an average diameter of 8.0 nm can be obtained. Kovalchuk et al. [30] synthetized GQDs from bituminous coal with irregular spherical-like shapes with a size in the range of 15–50 nm. The size of our produced quantum dots have been compared with the report by Zhang et al. [26] using a hydrothermal method based on the conversion of graphene oxide aqueous solutions. Fig. 2 A–B shows the emission spectra from the aqueous GQDs solution obtained after 45 min of carbonization under different excitation wavelengths, as well as a density map (Fig. 2C) showing the dependence of the excitation versus emission. It can be clearly observed that the aqueous solutions of GQDs presented a strong fluorescence in the blue region under UV light irradiation (Fig. 2 D). Due to the lack of energy gaps, it seems just unexpected any kind of luminescence phenomenon in graphene-like structures unless phonon-assisted [38]. However, more recently, many researches have been reporting on the possibility of graphene oxide in emitting photoluminescence in the region of near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet [39]. The mechanisms responsible for the photoluminescence of GQDs are still not fully understood, however, it is believed that they have a strict correlation to their sp3 carbon matrix. For the graphene oxide, the photoluminescence in the blue region would be produced by the ordered sp2 clusters, which would be isolated within the sp3 C-O matrix [15,39]. In this context, as it has been recently showed in the literature, GQDs have ordered sp2 structures and a great abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups, which make reasonable the hypothesis that both, GQDs and graphene oxide, should share the same photoluminescence origin [16,39]. In this investigation, the GQDs presented PL emission spectra excitation-dependent, i.e., the PL emission shifted as the excitation wavelength changed (Fig. 2A–B). The fluorescence emission ranged from 440 to 500 nm under an excitation range of 300–450 nm (Fig. 2C). The maximum excitation wavelength and the maximum emission wavelength were 380 and 465 nm, respectively. A Stokes shift of 140 nm was observed when excited at 300 nm (emission at 440 nm), which decreased linearly to 50 nm at a maximum excitation of 450 nm (emission at 500 nm). The fluorescence emission dependence with the excitation wavelength for the GQDs has been often reported in the literature, which is a very common effect for luminescent carbon nanomaterials. This dependence would be attributed to sp2 clusters with different sizes and emission sites [15,16]. Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrographs for all mats obtained from the electrospinning of aqueous PVA and PVA/GQDs solutions. In all cases, we have observed homogeneous webs of ultrathin fibers (100 < diameter < 1000 nm), which were defect-free. As regards the electrospinning of the control solution (PVA), the fibers’ average diameter was (143 ± 39) nm (Fig. 3A). As GQDs were loaded and the concentration increased, we observed an increase in the average diameters, as follows: (134 ± 33) nm, (190 ± 64) nm and (226 ± 104) nm, for PVA/GQDs-10 (Fig. 3B), PVA/GQDs-20 (Fig. 3C) and PVA/GQDs-30 (Fig. 3D), respectively. As noted, the loading of GQDs into the PVA solutions was responsible for thickening the fibers and for the generation of more heterogeneous fibers’ webs, therefore leading to higher average diameters and higher standard deviations. This can be explained by the considerable increase in the solution viscosity after GQDs loading, which was clearly noticeable to the naked eye. It is well known that the solution viscosity plays a great role on the morphology of electrospun fibers. In general, continuous and homogeneous fibers are rather obtained from low-viscosity solutions, whereas high viscosities impair the ejection of the solution jets and solvent evaporation. Therefore, the increase in the solution viscosity may contribute to higher viscoelastic forces, which resist to the axial stretching during electrospinning, leading to thicker fibers [40–42]. Unlike this work, Abidin, et al. [29] reported on the preparation of PVA loaded with carboxylated GQDs for supercapacitor purposes and showed a decrease in the fiber average diameter. While the GQDs concentration used by Abidin et al. in the PVA solution was considerably lower (0.2 mg mL−1), the carboxyl-functionalization in the GQDs may have played a greater role changing the polarity of polymer solution, which effected the elongation force during the ejection of solution from the nozzle. In this direction, many researchers have demonstrated that increases in the electrical conductivity of the solution, and consequent increase in the neat charge density in the polymer jet, may lead to reductions in the average diameter of the fibers [43,44]. Fig. 4 shows the TEM and HRTEM micrographs for a PVA/GQDs-20 electrospun mat, in order to investigate the GQDs distribution along the fibers. Due to great similarity, TEM micrographs for PVA/GQDs-10 and PVA/GQDs-30 are not shown. Fig. 4A shows a good dispersion of the GQDs, which were homogeneously conditioned along the fibers’ axis. The HRTEM micrographs (Fig. 4B–C) clearly showed that the GQDs had well-ordered crystalline structures, with a lattice spacing of 0.5 nm. Due to the homogeneous GQDs distribution along the fibers, the fluorescent properties of these materials were also evaluated by optical fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 3E–F shows the fluorescence optical images obtained from an electrospun PVA/GQDs-20 mat. It can be observed that the fluorescence distribution is uniform throughout the fibrous web, which corroborates the homogeneous distribution observed by TEM (Fig. 4A). Fig. 5 A presents the PL emission spectra of the electrospun PVA/GQDs mats and the PL excitation spectrum at emission wavelength of 440 nm. We can observe that increasing the GQDs content led to a clear increase in the fluorescence intensity. It is well reported on literature that the GQDs fluorescence is highly sensitive to its concentration [30,45]. Interestingly, as the GQDs content increased, a slight red-shift was observed for the maximum of emission, which can be better visualized in the normalized curves (Fig. 5B). This finding may be attributed as a result of light re-adsorption or even because of FRET (Föster Resonance Energy Transfer). In sum, both effects may be an indication that the increase in the GQDs concentration into the PVA matrix might have led to a certain degree of aggregation. As previously showed in Fig. 5B, and now in Fig. 5D, the GQDs solution revealed a PL emission behavior excitation-dependent, and shifts to the red-region were observed as the excitation wavelength increased. However, surprisingly, the fluorescence of the PVA/GQDs membranes showed a PL emission behavior excitation-independent (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the excitation maximums had a shift of ∼50 nm (380 nm for the GDs solution, Fig. 2C, and 328 nm for the PVA/GQDs mats, Fig. 5A). This changing from excitation-dependent of the GQDs to excitation-independent can be attributed to an effect known as “Giant Red-Edge Effect”, which was just recently described [46]. The peak of PL emission of the graphene oxide has been described in the literature as being strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength, as initially observed in this work for the GQDs solution [19,46]. Recently, Cushing, et al. [46] reported on an important breakthrough, which revealed that the dependence of the fluorescence of the graphene oxide with the excitation wavelength is attributed to an effect named “Giant-red effect” (GRE), which is responsible for breaking Kashas's rule. In our study, once the GQDs were present in water, a polar solvent, the solvation dynamics would tend to decrease to the same time scale of the fluorescence [46]. If the solvation dynamics are not at least one order of magnitude faster than the fluorescence lifetime, the fluorophore can simultaneously emit to the excited energy state that is being reduced, which in turn creates a time-dependent energy emission state [46]. Therefore, the fluorescence peak of the GQDs widens and shifts to the red-region, as the excitation wavelength increases. Once the GQDs are incorporated into a solid-state matrix, such as PVA, the GRE may disappear, which was indeed observed in the present study. The thermal properties of PVA and PVA/GQDs were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Fig. 6 shows the TG, dTG and DSC curves. The main parameters obtained from the TG/dTG and DSC curves are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively. In Fig. 6A, we can observe typical TGA thermograms for PVA matrices. The 1st stage of mass loss (25–150) °C, for the neat PVA (control), is attributed to the volatilization of absorbed and adsorbed water. These water molecules are confined in the microstructures of PVA and in the porous structures of the electrospun fibers. In the region of 200–500 °C, two different stages of massive mass loss were observed (2nd and 3rd stages). The 2nd stage, from 200 to 380 °C, is associated to the decomposition of the side chains of PVA, whereas the 3rd stage, from 380 to 500 °C, is associated to the decomposition of the main chains of the PVA macromolecules. Thus, the last two stages were responsible for a mass loss of around 88%, which corresponded both to the structural decomposition of PVA [47]. About the PVA/GQDs mats, as higher the GQDs content, higher the mass loss in the 1st stage. This can be explained by the higher hydrophilic character of the PVA/GQDs due to the absorbed and adsorbed water in the GQDs. The loading and increasing of the GQDs content slightly decreased the Tonset (10–17 °C). As reported in literature, in the region of 170–300 °C, the decomposition of oxygen-containing groups of the graphene oxide takes place [48]. Essentially, in temperatures higher than 300 °C, up to 900 °C (4th stage of mass loss), some others more stable oxygen-containing groups decompose. The increase in the residual mass (Table 3) is clearly related to the higher carbon content due to the presence of GQDs in the polymeric matrix. No clear trends were observed as regards the values of Tp (Fig. 6B, 2nd stage), which corresponded to the temperature where the rate of mass loss was maximum. Firstly, at the lowest GQDs content (PVA/GQDs-10), Tp increased from 279 °C (PVA) to 294 °C; however, as the GQDs content increased, Tp decreased to 283 °C and 272 °C, for PVA/GQDs-20 and PVA/GQDs-30, respectively. These results could be an indication that, in a first moment, lower contents of GQDs (GQDs-10 and GQDs-20) contributed to thermally protect the polymeric matrix. However, as the GQDs content increased, and consequently the oxygen-containing functional groups (sensitive to thermal decomposition in this region), an unbalance in the GQDs protective effect occurred. Thus, the accentuated increase in Tp, in a first moment, would be followed by decreases associated to the joint decomposition of the oxygen-containing groups and the side chains of PVA. From the DSC curves (Fig. 6C and D), we observed the presence of melting peaks (T m , endothermal) and crystallization peaks (T c , exothermal), which are typically present in semi-crystalline polymers, such as PVA. For the neat PVA, T m was found around 229 °C (Table 4), whereas this value slightly decreased to 225–226 °C with GQDs loading (Table 4). This transition is associated to the melting of the crystalline regions of the polymeric matrix. The heat of fusion also decreased due to the GQDs loading and its content increasing. Therefore, we observed a consequent decrease in the crystallinity degree because the presence of GQDs, which could be explained by a combination of several factors, such as the gradual loss of mobility of the polymeric chains; strong molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, between the PVA chains and GQDs [30]. The decrease in the crystallinity of polymeric matrices due to the nanoparticles loading is frequently reported in the literature. Atabey et al. [25] reported on the decrease of crystallinity of polymeric matrices of PVA nanofibers due to the CdSe@Zns quantum dots loading. The reduction in the crystallinity degree in PVA matrices was also reported by Kovalchuk et al. [30], which prepared luminescent composites containing coal-derived GQDs loaded into the polymer matrix. Rodrigues et al. [43] reported that the loading of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in polymeric matrices of poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) ultrathin fibers was also responsible for the generation of final materials with reduced crystallinity. The decreases in T c (Fig. 6D, Table 4) due to the GQDs loading would be associated to the higher thermal conductivity of GQDs comparatively to PVA, which results in a larger heat distribution in the samples containing GQDs. Therefore, the presence of GQDs would be responsible for promoting a higher degree of super-cooling during the process of electrospinning, leading to a fast generation of heterogeneous crystallization nuclei. Besides, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the GQDs edges would act preferentially as heterogeneous nuclei sites for the crystallization of PVA. However, due to the expected strong interaction between GQDs and the PVA chains, via hydrogen bonds, the crystallization process would be confined in the dimensional reduction of the PVA macromolecules, therefore, the crystallization process would be reduced. The broad and intense endothermic peaks, in the region of 100–120 °C (Fig. 6C) are associated to the volatilization of confined water in the microstructures of PVA and in the porous structures of the electrospun mats [49]."
7,Conclusion,"In the present work, a feasible, fast and “green” approach was proposed for the preparation of nanostructured hybrid fluorescent materials from the electrospinning of aqueous solutions of PVA and GQDs, which were prepared by the incomplete carbonization of citric acid. Electrospinning led to homogeneous distributions of GQDs into the polymeric ultrathin PVA fibers, while increasing the GQDs content in the matrix led to a clear increase in the fluorescence intensity. The results herein widen the perspectives of application of a low-cost nanostructured hybrid fluorescent material in several fields, via a simple approach using a water-soluble polymer and a naturally occurring component from citrus fruits."
