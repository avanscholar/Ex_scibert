0,Introduction,"The demand for energy is ever-increasing for various reasons like growth in vehicle population, new technology induction, etc., which are again dependent on external energy. Fossil fuels are mostly used in producing energy which is non-renewable and predicted to last only a few more years depending on the current utility. There is an ever-increasing demand for energy that exists, thanks to increased production of vehicles, induction of new technologies that solely dependent on external energy. Having been the largest source of energy, fossil fuel energy is non-renewable i.e., forecasted to deplete in the near future due to its high consumption rate. The fossil fuel engine is an important contributor to the global warming since it emits pollutants like carbon dioxide, particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and few other gases that are poisonous to the environment. The diesel fuel which is used for transportation purposes, manufacturing industries and agriculture produces enormous amounts of NOx and particulate matter which in turn pollute the environment [1]. Being non-renewable resources, these traditionally-used fossil fuels are predicted to deplete faster. Hence the researchers started concentrating on renewable resources such as biofuel from biomass and edible and non-edible oil extracted from bio-feedstock [2]. Karthikeyan et al. [3] investigated the pomegranate seed oil methyl ester biodiesel engine with ceramic zirconia coated piston. The observed results showed that the improvement in significant engine characteristics at high compression ratio, injection pressure and injection timing in thermally coated engine. The emulsified lemon peel oil (LPO) also used in a diesel engine to reduce the NOx emission without affecting the engine performance [4]. Here new ionic surfactant namely methyl-dihydroxy propyl imidazolium chloride is used. The results showed that the BTE of LPO emulsion is reduced to 29.87 from 34.58% of pure LPO at full load condition. The NOX and smoke emission are reduced by 21–32 and 6–15% for the LPO emulsion samples compared to pure LPO. The low viscous low cetane (LVLC) pine oil is replaced diesel in compression ignition engine [5]. Further here electrochemical liquid vortex ionization was used with permanent magnet/electromagnet to reduce NOx emission with pine oil as base fuel. The Electrochemical liquid vortex ionization system converts the fuel molecules to ions; this leads to enhanced atomization and faster air–fuel mixing process leading to lower ignition delay. The test results, showed the BTE for pine oil is higher and emissions like smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide are reduced. In addition, use of magnetic-based fuel reforming system reduces the ignition delay leading to lower NOx emission. India, especially her southern states, produces abundant quantities of cashew nut shell which is one of the important biomasses. Cashew nut shell oil can be used as a biofuel in vehicle transportation. Across the states in India, Cashew nut is cultivated in over 0.87 million hectares of land with a production capacity of 0.6 million metric tons of raw cashew nuts per year. As per the previous studies, different methods such as cold extrusion, hot oil roasting, open pan roasting, drum roasting, and solvent extraction rate are followed to extract the CNSL from Cashew Nut Shell (CNS) [6]. In the study conducted by Rajesh et al. [7,8], the CNSL was extracted following the vacuum pyrolysis method. In general, the CNSL is comprised of 52% cardanol, 30% polymeric material with 10% cardol while 8% is made up of other substances. Here, the distillation process was employed to process the technical CNSL at reduced pressure so as to remove the polymeric material. In distilled technical CNSL, the cardanol was 78% while cardol was 8% and polymeric material was 2% with the rest of the substances making 12%. The dark brown oil is produced when the CNSL was gently heated at 100–175 °C after which pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C under vacuum (720 mm Hg) so that purified form can be obtained [9]. Due to the high calorific value (40 MJ/kg) present in this pyrolyzed oil, this bio-oil is deemed to the most promising fuels that can be used instead of traditional ones in ICEs [10–12]. It is possible to produce biodiesel from CNSL via double-stage transesterification too. However, preheating should be done after this process in order to enhance the BTE and diminish the emissions of HC and CO from the diesel engine [13]. Velmurugan et al. [14,15] demonstrated the thermal cracking process, technically termed as pyrolysis, in which the thermal reactor was fabricated to extract the thermal cracked CNSL (TC-CNSL) and to evaluate its properties. Different temperature ranges were used in thermal cracking to produce different qualities of fuel. The results attained in the engine test concluded with an improvement in both performance of the engine and reduced emissions of HC and CO, thanks for CNSL pre-heating. Recently, the hydrogen-enriched diesel engines started gaining momentum, thanks to the environmental benefits it offers. There is an increased BTE and reduced emissions of HC and CO which are the primary advantages in modern diesel supplemented with hydrogen-enriched air systems. When compared with diesel engine operations, the emission of NOx is slightly higher in spite of the fact that smoke and particulate matter decline [16,17]. In the research conducted by Senthilkumar et al. [18] a single-cylinder diesel engine with hydrogen-diesel dual fuel mode was utilized. The researcher deployed hydrogen of industrial-standards to flow through the engine at reduced pressure from 140 bar to 2 bar to the inlet manifold. This study fixed a total of three hydrogen flow rates such as 4 lpm, 6 lpm, and 8 lpm. Out of these levels, the 6 lpm hydrogen flow rate produced high BTE with the least emission rate of HC and CO. However, for similar hydrogen flow rates, the emission of NOx, heat release rate, as well as the cylinder pressure, got increased. In the study conducted by Koten et al. [19], a four-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine with 0.20, 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80 lpm hydrogen flow rates was deployed. From the results, it can be inferred that there was an increase in BTE with a reduction in the emissions of HC, CO, and soot, thanks to brilliant blend formation and increased flame speed of the hydrogen gas. The investigations conducted earlier tested hydrogen in addition to biofuels in dual fuel mode with the sole aim of enhancing the combustion efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions. The study conducted by Tuccar and Uludamar [20] utilized Pomegranate seed Oil Biodiesel (POB) as a substitute in diesel engines which are already improved with hydrogen. The study analysis results concluded that there was a slight reduction in exhaust emissions coupled with increased engine performance when the POB was enriched with hydrogen. The study conducted by Baltacioglu et al. [21] made use of a pilot injection diesel engine with few substitute fuels, for instance, biodiesel, hydroxyl (HHO) and pure hydrogen. The authors found an increase in the performance of the engine when HHO was supplemented with intake air, in comparison with pure hydrogen supplemented in normal diesel fuel operation. Comparatively, the pure hydrogen emission results were low than HHO. In a few research investigations [22,23], the water-in-biodiesel emulsions along with hydrogen fuel were used in engines under dual fuel mode, only to reduce the emission of oxides of nitrogen and enhance the thermal efficiency. In the literature [24], different ethanol proportions were used with Tamanu Methyl Ester (TME) and hydrogen in order to increase BTE and diminish the emissions of oxides of nitrogen, smoke and carbon monoxide. Many researches used a small volume of alcohol as additives with diesel or biodiesel to enhance the efficiency of the engine and diminish the exhaust emission of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. When using 5% ethanol in biodiesel (BE5), both combustion characteristics, as well as BTE, got increased slightly. The HC, CO, NOx and particulate emissions are reduced with a lower percentage of ethanol addition. When the percentage of ethanol is high in BE blends, then there increase the emissions of HC and CO [25,26]. In the study conducted by Nanthagopal et al. [27], the researchers checked the impact of different alcohols and nanoparticles in diesel and biodiesel operations in various diesel engines. This review recommended that better miscibility and stability can be attained in higher alcohols such as butanol and pentanol in comparison with lower alcohols. When nanoparticles are added to the diesel, the results found to be promising in terms of reducing emissions, better performance, and good combustion. Nanthagopal et al. [28,29] investigated the effect of introducing higher alcohols as a blend with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel in diesel engine. Here two different higher alcohols namely n-pentanol and n-octanol are blended with biodiesel in the proportion of 10%, 20% and 30% by volume are used. They observed that the BTE and smoke emission increased and NOX emission reduced with alcohols addition in biodiesel. The effect of antioxidant additives with pure Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester also investigated in diesel engine to reduce the NOx emission [30]. New antioxidant additive namely Ethanox was added to the Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel at concentrations of 200 ppm, 500 ppm and 1000 ppm and the test results were compared to Butylated hydroxytoluene antioxidant at same concentrations. The results showed that the addition of antioxidants with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel produced higher brake thermal efficiency compared to pure biodiesel. Moreover, the addition of Ethanox and Butylated hydroxytoluene antioxidants with neat biodiesel increase the carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and smoke emission and reduction in NOx emission at all concentrations than biodiesel. The effect of fuel additives namely, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) on Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel also studied in twin cylinder CI engine [31]. The results showed that the nanoparticles are capable of enhancing the combustion process and they also act as an oxidising catalyst. Dispersion of 100 ppm of TiO2 nanoparticle resulted in the improvement of brake thermal efficiency by 4% at full load condition. The tendency of BHT to inhibit the formation of free radicals also produces marginal improvement in performance characteristics and is found to be more effective in mitigating NOx emissions, but adversely affecting HC and CO emissions. In diesel engine operations, both DEE and DME can be utilized as oxygenated additions in addition to diesel or biodiesel so as to attain excellent combustion and reduced emissions. Few researchers (Mohan et al. [32] and Sivalaksmi et al. [33]) assessed the impact of DEE on engine performance and emission in their study. This study made use of a 4-stroke diesel engine with different blends of DEE and diesel. Their study inferred that a 5% DEE blend was able to yield better performance and a low amount of emissions in contrast to other higher portions of DEE and diesel fuel blends. At full load conditions, the emissions of CO got decreased while the smoke emissions at all the engine loads got decreased. The emissions of HC and NOx got increased only for BD5 than neat biodiesel in all the engine loads. When compared with that of the biodiesel, the brake thermal efficiency of BD5 was higher. In the study conducted by Ibrahim [34], the DEE was used as an oxygen-supplementary to enhance the combustion features of a diesel engine. This study inferred that when 15% DEE was added with diesel, it enhanced the BTE up to 7.2% whereas the BSFC got reduced by 6.7% in comparison with diesel fuel. The study conducted by Sezer et al. [35] made use of dimethyl ether and diethyl ether as alternatives in diesel engines. Using a thermodynamic cycle model, the research work simulated a direct injection diesel engine. The results proved that the cylinder temperature and pressure were low when dimethyl ether and diethyl ether were used. This led to the least engine performance compared to diesel fuel that was allowed to function under equal injection conditions. There was a decline in brake power and an increase in fuel consumption when dimethyl ether and diethyl ether were added. Under equal equivalence ratio, there was a slight increase in the levels of CO and NOx for dimethyl ether and diethyl ether. In the studies [36,37], the DEE was analyzed with different proportions such as 8%, 16% and 24% (by vol.) in High-Speed Direct Injection (HSDI) diesel engine. The results proved that when DEE was added, there was a reduction in CO, NOx and smoke emission with an increase in the emission of HC. Further, it was observed that the cylinder pressure and temperature got reduced with delayed HRR. The ignition quality of the DEE/diesel fuel blend was low which also reported unstable engine operations when the blending ratio of DEE was high. Devaraj et al. [38] used waste pyrolysis oil as an alternate fuel and mixed with 5% and 10% DEE. The results indicated a reduction in smoke levels and increase in BTE in comparison with pure plastic pyrolysis oil and diesel. The blend was found to produce less constituent of CO and NOx. In the study [39], the oxygenated cetane improver DEE was utilized along with diesel and kerosene in the CI engine with the sole aim of improving the efficiency of the engine. The DEE is blended into diesel at 2%, 5%, 8%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. In this study, the trade-off between PM and NOx of the diesel engine was reduced by the DEE-diesel blends and the authors found DE15D to be the optimum blend. The kerosene was also blended with diesel in different proportions (5%, 10%, and 15%) by volume in order to identify the adulteration effect. The impact of kerosene adulteration on DE15D was also assessed. The study results inferred low BTE, high smoke at full load, high BSFC and low smoke at part load conditions when using DEE-kerosene-diesel blends. Compared to the DE15D blend, the former blend had resulted in low NO, high HC, and low CO at full load with low HC at part load. In the study conducted by Devaraj et al. [40], diethyl ether was used as an effective cetane to improve in order to diminish the exhaust emission on biodiesel fuelled single-cylinder diesel engine. The study made use of 10% and 20% of diethyl ether (BD90DEE10, BD80DEE20), diesel and Mustard oil methyl ester (BD100). The results proved that when DEE was added with biodiesel, it significantly reduces the emissions of HC, CO, and smoke. The research conducted by Ibrahim [41] attempted to improve the compression-ignition engine performance that was operated with a diesel–biodiesel blend using DEE. In this study, the researchers utilized four fuels name 5% and 10% DEE blends of biodiesel-diesel, biodiesel-diesel mixture and diesel. The study inferred that when 5% DEE was added in the diesel–biodiesel mixture, it enhanced the performance of the engine in a significant manner for most of the engine loads in comparison with all other fuels tested. The investigation carried out by Dinesha et al. [42] checked the impact of water emulsion and diethyl ether additive upon the diesel engine’s combustion, performance, and its emission. The study made use of waste cooking oil biodiesel blends. There was a mild increase observed in BTE of the emulsified fuel due to diethyl ether composition whereas 2% of diethyl ether yielded the maximum BTE. In the case of 2% diethyl ether composition, the study observed a low amount of NOx, CO, HC, and smoke emissions. In a diesel engine, Nanthagopal et al. [43] conducted a study using 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 12.5% diethyl ether with diesel-Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel blends. The results inferred that, when compared with diesel fuel, there was a reduction in BTE up to 5.3% with enhanced BSFC when 12.5% of diethyl ether was used. Furthermore, the blends exhibited 84%, 4.6% and 57% reduction in hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions compared to diesel fuel at 100% engine load. The smoke opacity got increased while the combustion characteristics got decreased in diethyl ether additives. The experimental study performed by Venu and Madhavan [44] analyzed the characteristics of the diesel engine with the help of alcohol- biodiesel-diesel as ternary blends and assessed the impact of 5% DEE with ternary blends. When DEE was added with alcohol-based ternary blends, there was a marginal, but significant improvement found in BTE. In addition to this, the HC and smoke emission also got reduced by up to 9% and 4%. Further, the ignition delay got diminished in the presence of DEE in blends resulting in lower NOx emissions. Based on the review of various studies in this area, numerous investigations were conducted with regards to different alcohols, antioxidant fuel additives, electrochemical liquid vortex ionization with permanent magnet/electromagnet, ceramic coated piston and DEE addition with different biodiesel derived from edible, non-edible oil and diesel fuel. However, there is a lack of studies with three fuels that focus on low cost cashew nut shell oil biodiesel, hydrogen and diesel blend with DEE addition. In this novel work, zero-emission gaseous fuel hydrogen was added with CNSL biodiesel and DEE to enhance the performance of the engine and decrease the exhaust emissions further. In this study, the CNSL biodiesel B20 was used with different flow rates of hydrogen namely 4, 6 and 8 lpm. Finally, the CNSL B20 and different volumes (2%, 4%, and 6%) of DEE blends were used with optimized 6 lpm flow rate of hydrogen fuel. All the fuels were assessed in a single-cylinder stationary diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm under various engine loads. The performance, emission and combustion results are compared in the upcoming sections."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Thermal-cracked CNSL production,"2.1 Thermal-cracked CNSL production In processing the raw CNSL, the technical CNSL (DT-CNSL) distillation is the first step. The composition of DT-CNSL is as follows; cardanol (78%), cardol (8%) and polymeric material (2%) with other substances making up the whole composition. The current research derived the cardinal from thermal-cracked CNSL (TC-CNSL) in the temperature range of 180 °C and 380 °C with 1 atm pressure. In Fig. 1 , the schematic view of the reactors are shown in the manufacturing of TC-CNSL. In the reactor, there exists a CNSL tank, safety valve, pressure gauge, heating coil, beaker, and temperature controller. Till the oil temperature attains 380 °C, the DT-CNSL (cardanol) is heated with the help of a temperature-controlled electric heater. With the help of cooling water, the evaporated oil gets condensed in the condenser and collected in the beaker as organic fraction i.e., TC-CNSL, a light–dark coloured substance. The reactor uses pressure gauge as well as the safety valve in order to get rid of the excess pressure that gets produced in the reactor. The characteristics of both TC-CNSL and that of the diesel fuel used for experimental purposes are listed in table 1 . A sample of TC-CNSL was analyzed with GC–MS in a sophisticated analytical instrument facility. The GC–MS-5975C [AGILENT] system was used for performing GC–MS analysis. This system consists of a polysiloxane-coated column with 30 m × 0.25 mm ID capillary. The GC was maintained with the initial oven temperature of 70 °C for 3 min followed by an increase at a rate of 9 °C/min to 300 °C. In this research, helium of 99.9995% purity was used as a carrier gas with a 1.51 ml/min flow rate. For every compound, the m/z (ratio of mass to charge) values that denote the most number of probable fragments of the compounds were determined. GC–MS was used to determine the fuel dilution of TC-CNSL among the samples retrieved from different tests. Fig. 2 shows a summary of the results. When utilizing GC–MS, one can find out that the key products result from the cracking reaction is a blend of hydrocarbons with linear and saturated or unsaturated chains and oxygenated products, such as linear carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, like water and carbon mono- and di-oxides [45]. From the results achieved in GC–MS, there are numerous components present in TC-CNSL and every component shows separate peaks. Table 2 shows the peak and corresponding components."
3,Hydrogen flow line,"2.2 Hydrogen flow line The high-pressure cylinder (140 bar) is used to supply hydrogen at 2 bar outlet pressure with the help of a hydrogen pressure regulator. Fig. 3 shows the experimental setup of the hydrogen flow line. The hydrogen is then passed on to a fine control valve so as to adjust the hydrogen flow rate. Using ALICAT-make digital mass flow meter, the hydrogen flow rate is measured in Litres Per Minute (lpm) with flow range between 0 and 100 lpm. After this, the hydrogen is passed via Non-Return Valve (NRV) that arrests the hydrogen from flowing reverse into the system. The hydrogen is then passed through a flame arrestor which is used to suppress the explosion within the hydrogen containing system. The flame trap is utilized to contain the flashback if any, into the intake manifold. Enrichment is a process in which the air and fuel are mixed. The hydrogen flow rate was maintained at 4, 6 and 8 L per minute."
4,Preparation of CNSL - DEE blends,"2.3 Preparation of CNSL - DEE blends The current research work prepared three types of diesel-CNSL-DEE blends with different compositions of CNSL and DEE while the diesel quantity was constant at 80% by volume. With the binary blend of diesel-CNSL, the diethyl ether was added at different fractions i.e., 2%, 4%, and 6% by volume. All the samples were kept to examine the phase separation for one week. The fuel samples did not exhibit any phase separation and were stable under ambient conditions. The hydrogen gas at an optimum flow rate of 6 lpm was added constant with all fuel samples."
5,Experimental setup and procedure,"The current research experimentations were conducted in Kirloskar-make (AV-1) single-cylinder, water-cooled, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine. The rated power of the engine was 3.7 kW whereas the speed was 1500 rpm. Fig. 4 shows the experimental setup schematic diagram while the engine specifications are provided in table 3 . In the test setup, there presents an engine, biodiesel supply system, hydrogen supply line, a dynamometer, intake air supply line, data acquisition unit and finally the emission analyzer. The engine was loaded with the help of an eddy-current dynamometer (SaJ-make) that is fixed with a controller so as to determine and varying the load. In the determination of pilot fuel biodiesel consumption, the authors used the weighing machine (Essae-make) and also measured the time taken for 50 gms of fuel consumption. The exhaust gas temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple since it is connected with the digital display unit. The researchers further assessed the crank angle and the cylinder pressure with the help of a crank angle encoder and piezoelectric pressure transducer (Make: Kistler, Type 6056A) respectively. The pressure signal received from the engine cylinder was sent to the data acquisition system and the combustion information such as HRR, and cylinder pressure was obtained from the data acquisition system. The overall parameter measurements were determined for 100 cycles and an average of these values was taken so as to get rid of cycle-by-cycle variation impact. With the help of Non-Dispersive Infrared Analyzers (NDIR) (Make: HORIBA, Japan), the researchers determined the emissions of NOx, CO, and HC. Before the assessment, the gas analyzers were calibrated using standard gases. The hydrogen supply system consists of flashback arrestor, hydrogen cylinder, flame arrestor, mass flow meter and pressure regulator as detailed in section 2.2 The experiments in the first stage were conducted using different blends of CNSL and diesel fuel termed as B20, B40, B60, B80, and B100. The B20 blend was found to be the optimized blend in achieving maximum brake thermal efficiency and reduced amount of HC and CO emission. This blend was utilized as a pilot fuel for further research with the addition of hydrogen. In the second stage of experiments, the hydrogen gas was inducted with air in the inlet manifold at 4, 6 and 8 lpm flow rates. The research found that the optimum hydrogen flow rate was 6 lpm with a B20 blend in order to achieve the highest BTE with reduced HC and CO emissions. For the purpose of decreasing the HC and CO emissions, the DEE was inducted in the third stage with different percentages such as 2%, 4% and 6% with CNSL B20 blend while 6 lpm hydrogen flow was maintained at constant. With an interval range of 20%, the engine was loaded from 0% to 100% for all the fuel combinations. The sections below discuss the combustion, performance, and emissions of the hydrogen-enriched biodiesel and DEE. Further, a comparison was also done with the above values and with that of the CNSL B20 biodiesel."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Performance and emission analysis of CNSL biodiesel and hydrogen fuel,"4.1 Performance and emission analysis of CNSL biodiesel and hydrogen fuel 4.1.1 Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) The BTE was found to be increased in all the tested fuels whenever there was an increase in the engine load. In Fig. 5 , the BTE variation with brake power is shown for different fuel modes such as CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2. The results infer that the BTE got increased with the addition of hydrogen in all the loads. This might be attributed to the increased efficiency which in turn due to increased combustion rate, due to hydrogen high flame velocity [19,20]. The study observed a low combustion efficiency in hydrogen at the time of using biodiesel in a low load range. On the contrary, in a high range of load, the hydrogen combustion efficiency got increased in the presence of biodiesel. There was an increase in the BTE experienced when more amount of hydrogen was mixed with air. The BTE was 32.3% in the case of 2 lpm H2 at full load while it further got incremented to 35.1% in the case of 6 lpm H2. 4.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) The BSFC is plotted against the brake power for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 in Fig. 6 . The study observation found that there was less BSFC found in 6 lpm H2 when compared to CNSLB20 and other percentages of H2 addition with CNSLB20 in all engine loads. This might be attributed to the excellent blend of hydrogen mixture and air which resulted in an incomplete combustion of the fuel. Further, the biodiesel got combusted wholly, because of wide flammability range, high flame speed and short quenching distance of the hydrogen. This action resulted in low BSFC [19,20,46]. The amount of BSFC that got reduced was low, at higher load when compared to that of the lower load. This is the reason behind too much air present at full load for complete combustion. The BSFC for CNSLB20, 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 were 0.29, 0.26, 0.25 and 0.21 kg/kW hr respectively at full load. 4.1.3 Exhaust gas temperature The different exhaust gas temperatures for CNSLB20, 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 with power are shown in Fig. 7 . The EGT got increased when hydrogen was added at all engine loads. The exhaust gas temperature for CNSLB20 with 6 lpm H2 was 400 °C while in the case of CNSLB20, it was 380 °C at full load conditions. The reason behind the increment in EGT during the addition of hydrogen might be due to the increased combustion rate of hydrogen [47]. 4.1.4 HC emission Fig. 8 shows the differences in unburned HC (UHC) emissions with brake power for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2. The emission of hydrocarbons in enrichment the hydrogen with CNSLB20 was 79 ppm, 70 ppm, 65 ppm for 2 lpm, 4 lpm and 6 lpm of hydrogen blends respectively whereas for CNSLB20, it was 83 ppm. At all the engine load conditions, there was a decrease in HC emission found when hydrogen was added with CNSLB20 and air. The hydrogen supplemented into inlet air resulted in the homogenous mixture, higher flame speed, and absence of carbon in hydrogen fuel, thus leading to a decrease in the amount of HC emission [17,18,22,48]. 4.1.5 CO emission Variations of CO emission rates with engine brake power for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 are shown in Fig. 9 . The emission of CO is predominantly based on the air–fuel ratio as per the stoichiometric proportions [15,27]. With the absence of carbon in hydrogen gas, there were low CO emissions when enriched with hydrogen. However, the current emission occurred because of the lube oil and pilot biodiesel (CNSLB20). The reduced value of CO emission might be due to high flame speed as well as a wide flammability range of the hydrogen gas [17,20,47]. The 38% reduction in CO was observed in the 6 lpm H2 flow rate compared to the CNSLB20 at full load condition. 4.1.6 NOx emission In the emission of oxides of nitrogen, the amount of oxygen present in the fuel and the maximum temperature measured inside the cylinders are two critical factors. The emission rate of NOx was found to be high with increased oxygen concentration and combustion temperature. The nitrogen and oxygen react together to form NOx in the presence of high combustion temperature while the latter is produced by burning fuel sprays maintained by local conditions. During the induction of hydrogen, the temperature gets increased, and hence increases in the combustion rate. This also aggravated the emission of oxides of nitrogen. Whenever hydrogen is inducted, these scenarios discussed above stand at the forefront, especially the environmental issues [20,21,48]. The NOx emissions got increased where there was an increase in the engine loads, due to increased combustion temperature as shown in Fig. 10 . The NOx emission for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 was 998 ppm, 1115 ppm, 1202 ppm and 1305 ppm. Higher the addition of H2 with CNSLB20, more the emission of NOx. The increase in NOx percentage was 30% in the case of 6 lpm H2 compared to CNSLB20 fuel mode at full load."
8,"Performance, combustion, and emission of CNSL biodiesel, hydrogen and DEE","4.2 Performance, combustion, and emission of CNSL biodiesel, hydrogen and DEE 4.2.1 Brake thermal efficiency Fig. 11 shows the differences in BTE with engine loads for different test fuels. The BTE value was low in the case of CNSLB20 in comparison with other fuel combinations such as 2%, 4% and 6% DEE with H 2 and CNSLB20 blends. This might be attributed to the high viscosity of the fuel blend which led to poor penetration, atomization, and mixing of fuel with air. When the load increased, the BTE also got increased which reached the threshold at 6% DEE at full load. The DEE induction increased the combustion process through the reduction of viscosity of the blends. This, in turn, enhanced the fuel spray as well as atomization of large fuel droplets into finer droplets [44–46]. Accordingly, higher combustion can be achieved by the proper blend of finer fuel droplets with air. There is an important role played by this additive in enhancing the BTE of the CNSL-hydrogen fuel blend. The delay period is further decreased by the high cetane number of DEE which also increased the utilization of fuel in a better manner. The maximum BTE of 37% was achieved at CNSLB20 with 6 lpm H2 and DEE 6%. It can also be observed that further addition of DEE showed no improvement, because of the low heating value of the blend. 4.2.2 Brake specific fuel consumption Fig. 12 shows the BSFC differences with load for several test fuel variants. In all the fuel combinations, the BSFC was found to be maximum when using the CNSLB20 blend. This might be attributed to its lower volatility and higher viscosity. There was a minimum BSFC achieved for all DEE fuel combinations in comparison with CNSLB20. In comparison with CNSLB20 fuel, the maximum BSFC reduction of 40% was achieved in CNSLB20-H2-6% DEE combinations fuel. In this study, low BSFC was obtained for CNSLB20-H2- 6% DEE combinations. The factors which contributed to high BTE attainment remain the same in case of reduced BSFC too. Lower flash point, high cetane number, high volatility and low viscosity of the DEE furthered the injected fuel to get combusted quickly [41,44,45]. When there was an increase in the composition of DEE above 6%, the BSFC value increased slightly, due to the reduced calorific value of the blend. 4.2.3 Exhaust gas temperature The differences in EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) with BMEP for all test fuels are shown in Fig. 13 . It can be understood from the figure that when DEE was added, the higher EGT was observed in all loads. It further increased with the increasing percentage of DEE in the blend. The DEE further enhanced the complete combustion process in the fuel blend. The carbon-to-hydrogen ratio is reduced by high oxygen content which is inbuilt in the DEE. This further helped in achieving better mixing of the fuel which might be attributed to better combustion of the fuel and high combustion temperature. The addition of oxygenated fuel resulted in a rapid combustion process which in turn incremented the temperature in the combustion chamber. The increase in the exhaust gas temperature was proved experimentally [40,44]. From the results achieved, it can be inferred that the EGT of 6% DEE was higher than other blends. This might be attributed to the heavy heat release of the blends where DEE performed as ignition improver for the CNSL-diesel fuel. In the case of higher engine loads, the higher temperature got projected. The primary reason behind the enhanced EGT is the high amount of in-cylinder temperature at high loads. The EGT of CNSLB20, CNSLB20 and 6 lpm H2, 2% DEE, 4% DEE and 6% DEE were 380 °C, 400 °C, 409 °C, 415 °C and 419 °C. 4.2.4 HC emission Fig. 14 shows the different levels of HC emissions for the test fuels with the load. A high level of HC emission was found in CNSLB20 blend in comparison with other CNSLB20 with DEE fuel blends. The primary reasons for low HC are viscosity, oxygen availability, the cetane number of DEE and volatility [33,34,37]. The DEE has physio-chemical properties that further improves the combustion of the blend. When DEE composition was enhanced from 2 to 6%, the HC value also got decreased, due to enhanced combustion. The DEE fueled a high amount of complete combustion in the fuel blend. The carbon-to-hydrogen ratio is reduced by high oxygen content which is inbuilt in the DEE. This further helped in achieving a better mixing of the fuel. In part-load conditions, the only minimal amount of HC got emitted with increasing load towards its rated condition. In the case of higher load conditions, the fuel-rich mixture is utilized to develop power. When the mixture becomes rich, the engine undergoes poor combustion due to which HC and CO are produced in high quantities. The percentages of decrease of HC emission with 6% DEE and with CNSLB20 were 43%, compared to CNSLB20. 4.2.5 CO emission Fig. 15 shows the differences in the emission of CO for the test fuels in all loads. A high amount of CO got emitted in CNSLB20 in comparison with other CNSLB20 and H2 with DEE fuel blends. According to the stoichiometric proportions in the literature [32,33], the CO emission primarily relies upon the air–fuel ratio. There was a decrease in CO emission when DEE got introduced [39,40]. With the lack of carbon in hydrogen gas, low CO emission occurred when it was enriched with hydrogen. While the current study emission occurred due to pilot biodiesel (CNSLB20) and lube oil. The CO emission got significantly reduced, because of the addition of hydrogen gas and DEE with CNSLB20 and due to the high flame speed of hydrogen gas and wide flammability range. The CO emission for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2% DEE, 4%DEE and 6% DEE were 0.042%, 0.026%, 0.02%, 0.015%, and 0.012% volume. The percentage of reduction of CO is 50% for 6% DEE addition with CNSLB20 in comparison with CNSLB20 biodiesel. 4.2.6 NOx emission The differences in oxides of nitrogen emission for different test fuels are shown in Fig. 16 . Only the least values of NOx got emitted at lower loads while the emission was high as per the increase in load. This is because when the load is increased, the fuel burnt is also increased due to an increase in the engine operating temperature. When the temperature is low, the nitrogen remains inert while it gets activated and oxidized at a higher temperature range. In general, biodiesel-fired CI engines generate a high amount of NOx, due to fuel-borne oxygen. When introducing hydrogen, the temperature got increased because of the increased combustion rate. This also aggravated the emission of oxides of nitrogen. When the hydrogen gas was introduced, the scenario discussed above occurs and creates an environmental balance [46,48]. The NOx emissions increased when the engine loads were increased. The NOx emission got further increased when DEE was added with CNSLB20 and hydrogen fuel mode. This might be attributed to the inbuilt oxygen content present in DEE which reduces the carbon to hydrogen ratio, which in turn blends the fuel properly. Due to the addition of oxygenated fuel, the combustion process become rapid which in turn increased the combustion efficiency [34,35,37]. The percentage of increase in the oxides of nitrogen emission was observed as 31% for 6% DEE, compared to CNSLB20. 4.2.7 Cylinder pressure The cylinder pressure as per the crank angle diagrams is shown in Fig. 17 for all the tested fuels during maximum load conditions. Various factors such as type quality of fuel, delay period and operating conditions contribute to cylinder gas pressure. In terms of diesel engines, the amount of fuel burnt during the premixed combustion phase primarily impacts the peak pressure on the combustion rate in the beginning. Due to the increase in the load, the amount of fuel that gets burnt also increases which further aggravates the pressure inside the cylinder gradually. Research studies conducted earlier [22,46] were able to find out high peak cylinder pressure in the case of hydrogen-enriched biodiesel fuel. One needs to understand when hydrogen is enriched, it makes a possible high peak pressure in comparison with other modes. This might be attributed to the reduction in the ignition delay period and enhancement in the combustion by hydrogen. The DEE was used in the present study with CNSL hydrogen blends which plays a vital role in the reduction of the delay period. There are several important characteristics present in DEE such as higher volatility, inbuilt oxygen content and high cetane number. These physicochemical properties aid to attain the complete combustion through rapid vaporization and fuel mixture since the as fine particles with air permit the localized stoichiometric air–fuel ratio conditions to be achieved [37,39,42]. As a result, higher cylinder pressure was observed for DEE-CNSL-hydrogen blends fuels than the CNSLB20 blend. There is an increase in cylinder pressure observed as per Fig. 18 due to the increased percentage of DEE. The 71.5 bar maximum cylinder pressure was obtained for 6% DEE with CNSL hydrogen blends, while for CNSLB20 it was 65 bar. Increasing the DEE percentage further, the fuel blends calorific value got reduced, resulting in reduced cylinder pressure. 4.2.8 Heat release rate The Heat Release Rate (HRR) with the crank angle for variant percentages of DEE addition with CNSLB20 and hydrogen blends fuel mode at full load conditions is shown in Fig. 18. At the time of the delay period, the negative heat release rate was achieved for all test fuels, due to the heat absorption from the compressed hot air. Once the delay period got over, the HRR achieved the peak, because of uncontrolled combustion. The HRR value was maximum at few crank angle degrees after TDC. During the second stage, the additional heat release was experienced because of the premixed combustion. The high volatility of DEE led to the accumulation of fuel in the combustion chamber at the time of premixed combustion phase. This increased the HRR for DEE-added fuel blends [36,37,44]. In the second stage, a combination effect of premixed and diffused combustion of DEE-added CNSLB20 hydrogen blends resulted in high HRR in comparison with CNSLB20 hydrogen blends. It can be noted that the highest HRR was 66.2 J/deg. CA for 6% DEE with CNSLB20 and hydrogen fuel mode in comparison with 59.7 J/deg. CA for CNSL B20 hydrogen blend mode. The heat released was high when DEE was enriched with CNSL hydrogen than CNSLB20 hydrogen mode. The HRR got reduced when the composition of DEE was increased, due to the calorific value of the blend, viscosity and negative action of density."
9,Conclusions,"The present investigation was conducted to determine the impact of DEE addition, with CNSLB20–hydrogen dual-fuel mode operated diesel engine, upon few parameters such as combustion, performance as well as the exhaust emission characteristics of single-cylinder, water-cooled CI engine. The study optimized the CNSLB20 blends with different hydrogen flow rates such as 2 lpm, 4 lpm and 6 lpm for maximum BTE and minimum HC and CO emission. During the second stage, DEE of different percentages such as 2%, 4%, and 6% was added with optimized CNSLB20 and 6 lpm H2 dual fuel. The following observations are made from the experimental results. • In general, the BTE of hydrogen and CNSL B20 dual fuel engine got increased compared to CNSL B20. The BTE got increased with the addition of more amount of hydrogen with CNSL B20. The BTE was 32.3% in the case of 2 lpm H2 at full load while the BTE got increased to 35.1%, in the case of 6 lpm H2 and CNSL B20. • The BSFC got decreased in case of a higher percentage of H2 addition with CNSL B20 dual fuel engine. The BSFC for CNSLB20 at 2 lpm H2, 4 L lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 were 0.29, 0.27, 0.25 and 0.21 kg/kW.hr respectively at full load. • The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) got increased during H2 addition with CNSL B20 fuel. At full load conditions, the CNSLB20 with 6 lpm H2 had an exhaust gas temperature of 400 °C, while it was 380 °C in the case of CNSLB20. • The HC and CO emission got decreased with an increasing flow rate of H2 in the range of 2 lpm, 4 lpm, and 6 lpm at all load conditions. Among the tested H2 flow rate, 6 lpm shows the least HC and CO emission. The HC and CO was reduced by about 21% and 38% for 6 lpm H2 flow rate when compared to the sole CNSLB20 at full load condition. • The NOx emission got increased for H2-enriched CNSL biodiesel engine compared to the CNSLB20 blend. The NOx emission for CNSLB20, CNSLB20 with 2 lpm H2, 4 lpm H2 and 6 lpm H2 were 998 ppm, 1115 ppm, 1202 ppm and 1305 ppm at full load. When more H2 was added with CNSLB20, it increased the emission of NOx. • The BTE got increased in addition of DEE with CNSLB20 hydrogen blends. The maximum BTE of 37% was obtained for CNSLB20, 6 lpm H2 and DEE 6% compared to other percentages of DEE i.e., 2% and 4%. Any further addition of DEE shows no enhancement in the performance due to the lower heating value of the blend. • The BSFC got decreased in the case of 6% of DEE with CNSLB20 and H2 addition dual fuel engine compared to 2% and 4% DEE. Further, the increase in DEE composition more than 6%, the value of BSFC increased slightly due to the reduced calorific value of the blend. • The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) got increased during DEE addition with CNSLB20 and hydrogen fuel at all loads and it got further increased with the increasing percentages of DEE in the blend. The maximum temperature reached was 419 °C at 6% DEE addition with CNSLB20 and 6 lpm H2. • The HC and CO emission got decreased in addition to DEE with CNSLB20 and H2 blend dual fuel engine. The percentage of reduction of HC and CO was 43% and 50% respectively for 6% DEE addition in comparison with CNSLB20 biodiesel. • The NOx emission got increased when DEE was added to CNSLB20 and hydrogen fuel mode. This is due to the inbuilt higher oxygen content in the DEE which reduced the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio, which in turn helped to achieve better mixing of the fuel. The percentage of increase in NOx emission for 6% DEE was 31% compared to CNSLB20. • The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate were found to be increased for DEE addition with H2-enriched CNSLB20 biodiesel compared to CNSLB20 at full load condition. The maximum cylinder pressure and heat release rate recorded for 6% DEE addition with H2 enriched CNSLB20 biodiesel are 71.5 bar and 66.1 J/deg. CA respectively. On the whole, it can be concluded that the H2 enrichment with CNSL B20 dual fuel increased the BTE and reduced the HC and CO emissions. At the same time, the NOx emission got increased in the above mode. Further, the addition of DEE with the above fuel combination increased the BTE and reduced the HC and CO emissions. The BSFC also got decreased for both cases. But the NOx emission got increased in H2 and DEE addition with CNSLB20 biodiesel. The increase in HC and CO was observed in higher percentages (more than 6%) of DEE addition. This can be reduced by adding an optimum percentage (6%) of DEE with H2 and CNSL20 biodiesel. The increase in NOx can be reduced by after-treatment methods like EGR. Therefore, from the present work, it can be concluded that the hydrogen-CNSLB20-DEE is the promising alternative fuel for the diesel engine to achieve significant reductions in exhaust emissions compared to biodiesel blend without any major modifications."
