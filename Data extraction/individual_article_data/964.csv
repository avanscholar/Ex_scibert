0,Introduction,"There is an urgent need to replace unsustainable and carbon-emitting fossil-fuel-based energy with renewable and clean alternatives for energetically and environmentally-conscious societies [1]. Currently, hydrogen (H2) is being widely investigated as a promising fuel candidate for applications in automotive, aviation, and portable power sectors because of its high energy density and clean combustion [2,3]. However, 96% of current industrial H2 production is based on steam methane reforming or coal gasification from fossil fuel input, which is contrary to the original goal of “green” sustainability [4]. In contrast, water electrolysis driven by photovoltaic [5,6,7], geothermal [8], wind, or wave energy, provides an overall sustainable route for pure H2 production and allows the energy produced from these renewable, albeit intermittent, energy sources to be stored [9]. Despite its many advantages, the high energy consumption and overpotential of water electrolysis hinders its commercial application prospects [10]. The energy required to overcome the thermodynamics of the sluggish, four-electron multistep oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [11,12] accounts for 68.3% of the total energy consumed in this process [13]. In addition, the H2 produced can potentially mix with oxygen (O2) to create a low-value and hazardous product that requires expensive separation devices [14]. The electrochemical reforming of biomass materials that are more thermodynamically-favorable than OER is a promising route to achieve energy-saving hydrogen production while avoiding O2 mixing. Presently, the electrochemical reforming of methanol [15], ethanol [16], and glycerol [17] have been reported to greatly reduce the overpotential of water splitting. However, substantial energy is required to produce these alcohols from carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, cellulose, etc.) [13]. In contrast, the direct electrochemical reforming of carbohydrates or other biomass residues (such as lignin [18]) at the anode would be a better solution for low energy-consumption H2 production while potentially avoiding the waste and pollution from biomass energy. Carbohydrates derived from agriculture and forestry are the most abundant and inexpensive sources of biomass [19]. Large amounts of carbohydrates are present in waste water and residues generated from food, forestry, and chemical processing industries, such as food leftovers [20], vinasse [21], molasses [22], papermaking, black liquor, and hydrolysate. The discharge or incineration of these carbohydrate-containing wastes results in severe environmental pollution and is also a waste of natural resources. In addition, as the largest renewable and high-yield carbon source, carbohydrates can be used to produce carbon-based chemicals and materials to replace fossil fuels via electrochemical reforming [23]. While this energy-saving strategy is economically sound, carbohydrate oxidation reaction (COR) generally has slow kinetics, since COR includes multiple electron-transfer and proton-coupling steps with a series of reaction intermediates and energetic barriers [24]. Herein, to accelerate COR, it is crucial to use efficient electrocatalysts. Presently, such electrocatalysts have been limited to precious noble metal-based catalysts, such as gold, platinum, palladium, or their bimetal alloys [25,26], whose large-scale applications are hindered by their high prices. Thus, recent researches have focused on the synthesis of inexpensive catalysts based on earth-abundant transition metals, such as Fe [27], Co [28], Ni [29,30], and Cu [31]. However, most of these have only been used to exhibit their outstanding catalytic performance for the oxidation of glucose, which fails to demonstrate that this strategy can be applied to treat wastes that contain various types of carbohydrates. In addition, their unilateral functionality (i.e. their use only for COR) complicates the structure and cost of electrolysis. Therefore, the development of “carbohydrate-universal”, earth abundant, transition metal-based and bifunctional electrocatalysts that can simultaneously catalyze COR and HER in a single electrolyzer is highly desired in an energy-saving strategy. In this work, bimetal-based Co3FePx nanowires on Ni foam (Co3FePx@NF) were synthesized and evaluated as a “carbohydrate-universal” catalyst for COR. As a proof-of-concept of the “carbohydrate-universal” nature of the as-prepared catalysts, electrocatalytic oxidation was conducted on four different carbohydrate substrates and generally exhibited a much lower potential of 1.24 V and 1.32 V vs RHE to afford current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The excellent performance and bifunctionality of Co3FePx@NF for COR and HER motivated the assembly of a two-electrode energy-saving electrolyzer that reached current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 with voltages of 1.35 and 1.50 V, respectively. The values were at least 230 mV and 170 mV lower than the overall water splitting electrolysis. In addition, the long-term stability of Co3FePx@NF was also investigated to demonstrate its durability in a carbohydrate electrolyzer. The energy-saving design allowed a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 13.3% to be achieved when the electrolyzer was powered by only a single perovskite solar cell. In addition to low energy consumption, the multipurpose electrolyzer also provides a novel “carbohydrate-universal” route for the treatment of carbohydrate-containing waste."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobaltous nitrate (Co(NO3)2), iron sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium hydroxide (KOH), urea (CO(NH2)2), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose, were purchased from TCI Chemicals. All the above reagents were analytical grade and used as received. Commercially-available nickel foam (NF) matrixes (purity: ≥99.7%, thickness: 1 mm, pore diameter: 0.2 mm, porosity: 95%, hole percentage ≥98%, surface mass density: 280 g m−2) were purchased from Kunshan Kuangxun Electrical Co., Ltd (China). The commercial electrolytic cell in this paper was constructed using Pt@Ti as the cathode, RuO2/IrO2@Ti as the anode, and 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte. The Pt@Ti (purity of Pt: 99.99%, thickness of Pt: 0.1–20 μm) and RuO2/IrO2@Ti (content: 10 g m−2) were made by Baoji Zhiming Special metal Co., Ltd. (China). This study used a membrane-replaceable electrolytic cell (H-type) using Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, which was purchased from Tianjin AIDA Science-Technology Development Co. Ltd (China). Polyethylene-grafted polystyrene quaternary ammonium-type homogeneous anion exchange membranes (HoAM G-1204-05, thickness: 0.16 mm, exchange capacity: 1.8–2.2 meq g−1, water content: 24–30%, sheet resistance:4–8 cm−2, transport number: 90–95%) were purchased from Hangzhou Luhe Environmental Technology Co. Ltd (China). The perovskite solar cell (PSC) was constructed in-house."
3,Electrocatalyst synthesis,"2.2 Electrocatalyst synthesis Co3FePx nanowires were fabricated on NF (Co3FePx@NF) by hydrothermal reaction and subsequent phosphorization, as shown in Fig. 1 a. Hydrothermal reaction: Firstly, 10 mmol NH4F, 16 mmol CO(NH2)2, 1.5 mmol Co(NO3)2 and 0.5 mmol FeSO4·7H2O were sequentially dissolved in 35 mL deionized water in a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and stirred for 15 min. Secondly, a piece of NF (2 × 3 cm2), which was pre-cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol, water, acid (36.5 wt% HCl), and water by ultrasonication for 30 min each, was immersed into the above clear solution for 15 min. Then, the autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After hydrothermal reaction, the precursor of Co3FePx@NF was rinsed with water and dried at 60 °C for 3 h. Phosphorization: The precursor and 5 mmol NaH2PO2·H2O were placed at the downstream and upstream sides of a porcelain boat, respectively. The boat was then annealed at 400 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere to fabricate the Co3FePx@NF catalysts. The loading of Co3FePx on NF substrate was about 5.9 mg cm−2."
4,Electrocatalyst characterization,"2.3 Electrocatalyst characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected on a Hitachi SU8220 microscope (Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN microscope (FEI, America). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 diffractometer, employing Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å), over the 2θ range from 10° to 70°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an AXIS ULTRA DLD spectrometer (Kratos, U.K.) using Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). All materials were etched to a depth of 20 nm under a mild Ar ion sputtering procedure before recording the XPS spectra to reduce surface oxidized species that formed in the air."
5,Electrocatalytic experiments,"2.4 Electrocatalytic experiments Electrochemical measurements for COR, OER and HER were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemistry workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China). A three-electrode configuration was adopted with the prepared Co3FePx@NF as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt@Ti and RuO2/IrO2@Ti as the counter electrodes for oxidation reaction and HER, respectively. In the two-electrode system, Co3FePx@NF was employed as electrode couple. Pure alkali liquor (1.0 M KOH, 30 mL) with and without carbohydrate (0.1 M) was used as electrolyte. The potentials vs Ag/AgCl reported in this paper were converted into values vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation: E(RHE)=E(Ag/AgCl) +1.023 V. The current densities were reported as the current divided by the geometric area. Polarization curves were scanned at the rate of 5 mV s−1 and corrected for IR loss (current times internal resistance) which was recorded under the amplitude of the open circuit potential. All the presented curves were repeated several times until steady state was reached."
6,Solar-driven electrocatalytic experiments,"2.5 Solar-driven electrocatalytic experiments The current density-voltage (j-V) measurements of the homemade perovskite solar cell were performed on a Keithley 2420 SourceMeter under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel 67005, 150 W Solar Simulator). The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon (Si) diode (Hamamatsu S1133) equipped with a Schott visible-color glass filter (KG5 color-filter). A solar-driven electrolyzer was constructed by connecting the perovskite solar cell with a two-electrode electrolytic cell. The photocurrent was obtained under a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Cel-S500/350, CeAulight) with AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and measured on a CHI760E electrochemistry workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of Co3FePx electrocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Co3FePx electrocatalysts The efficient and low-cost bifunctional Co3FePx nanowire array-based electrocatalysts were synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal reaction followed by in situ phosphorization (Fig. 1a). The morphology, composition, and structure of the resulting electrocatalysts were investigated and characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX and XRD analyses (Fig. 1b–g). It was observed from the SEM image of the precursor of Co3FePx@NF (Fig. 1b) that the nanowires of around 150 nm in diameter and 2∼5 μm in length were vertically oriented on the entire NF surface in a homogeneous and dense fashion. The uniform distribution of Co, Fe, and O on the precursor was observed in the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping (Fig. 1b). After in situ phosphorization, Co3FePx@NF was obtained. The morphology of Co3FePx@NF (Fig. 1c and inset) was retained well from its precursor (Fig. 1b). The TEM image shows that the Co3FePx nanowires displayed a smooth surface with nanoparticles inside (Fig. 1d). In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 1d), several rings formed by discrete points were observed, which were due to the (211), (011), (200), and (020) planes of Co3FePx resembling the CoP phase. The well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.253 and 0.283 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e) also confirmed the presence of (200) and (011) planes. Moreover, FeP phase in the SAED pattern and HRTEM images was indistinguishable, indicating that there was no phase separation in Co3FePx. The scanning TEM (STEM) and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of Co3FePx nanowire (Fig. 1f) indicate the uniform distribution of Co, Fe and P elements. The ratio of metal atoms (Co/Fe) in the Co3FePx was～3:1, which was confirmed by EDX configured on SEM (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). In the XRD pattern of the precursor of Co3FePx (Fig. 1g), the characteristic diffraction maxima at 2θ = 11.6°, 23.4°, 34.1°, 38.5°, and 36.4° fit closely with the (003), (006), (012), (015), and (018) planes of cobalt iron carbonate hydroxide hydrate (Co5.84 Fe2.16(OH)16 (CO3)1.08∙ 0.32 H2O, PDF No.50-0235), indicating the formation of a layered double hydroxide (LDH). After in situ phosphorization, the as-obtained Co3FePx exhibited a similar overall pattern to that of the CoP and FeP, with the exception that the characteristic diffraction maxima were slightly shifted between those of CoP (2θ = 31.61°, 36.33° and 52.17°, PDF No.65-2593) and FeP (2θ = 32.78°, 37.19° and 50.38°, PDF No.65-2593), located at 2θ = 31.82°, 36.58° and 52.10°, associated with the (011), (111), and (211) planes of Co3FePx, respectively, suggesting the formation of a bimetallic phosphide. The peak width did not increase, indicating that the synthesized Co3FePx is resulted in the isomorphous substitution of CoP and FeP without phase separation [32]. This conclusion was further demonstrated by XPS. The electronic structures of all the elements in Co3FePx were investigated by XPS and compared with those in CoP and FeP (Fig. 2 ). In the high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 2a), two spin orbit doublets at 778.6–778.1 eV (793.4–793.2 eV) and 782.4–782.0 eV (798.4–797.8 eV) were observed in the binding energy (BE) region from 778 eV to 810 eV in CoP and Co3FePx, which were attributed to phosphatized and oxidized Co, respectively [33]. Moreover, two shakeup satellite structures (Sat.) were also observed at higher BEs in Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. The high-resolution spectra of both Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 in FeP and Co3FePx were deconvoluted into three peaks (Fig. 2b), and the peaks at 707.2–707.1 eV and 720.1–720.0 eV were assigned to Fe in phosphide, the peaks at 710.7–710.6 and 724.3 eV were assigned to FeOx, and the peaks at 714.6 and 729.5 eV were related to the shakeup satellite peaks [34]. In the P 2p region of CoP, FeP, and Co3FePx (Fig. 2c), the peaks at 129.6–129.3 and 130.6–130.3 eV were ascribed to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2, respectively, while the higher-energy peak at 133.9–134.6 eV was attributed to an oxidized P species, such as phosphate or phosphite [33–35]. The presence of oxidized Co, Fe, and P was due to the surface oxidation of the as-prepared Co3FePx in air [33–35]. For Co3FePx, the BEs of Co (778.1 eV) and Fe (707.2 eV) in phosphide were higher than either metallic Co (778.0 eV) [36] and Fe (706.9 eV) [37], while the BE of P (129.3 eV) shifted to a lower value than red phosphorus (130.1 eV) [38]. The above results indicated that the electron cloud density shifted from metal atoms to nonmetal atoms which caused positive (Coδ+, Feδ+) and negative sites (Pδ−) to form within the electrocatalyst, which respectively served as the active and receiving centers for protons during the catalytic reaction [39]. Meanwhile, the P 2p peaks (Fig. 2c) in Co3FePx shifted towards a lower binding energy compared with those in CoP and FeP, which indicated enhanced electron interactions between elemental metals and phosphorus [33,40]. In addition, the Co 2p and Fe 2p peaks (Fig. 2a–b) in Co3FePx exhibited negative and positive shifts compared with the ones in CoP and FeP, respectively. These results suggested electron donation from Fe to P and to Co which was attributed to the lower electronegativity of Fe (1.83) compared with Co (1.88). The electronic interaction between Co and Fe in the Co3FeP indicated that the Co3FePx nanowires were alloyed bimetallic phosphides that did not phase separate [34,40–43], which is consistent with the XRD results."
9,COR catalyzed by Co3FePx@NF,"3.2 COR catalyzed by Co3FePx@NF The electrocatalytic performances of Co3FePx for COR were evaluated by the electro-oxidation of glucose (GOR), fructose (FOR), maltose (MOR) and sucrose (SOR) as the carbohydrate representatives in 1.0 M KOH. Co3FePx@NF was employed as the working electrode at anode in a three-electrode configuration with a two-compartment cell separated by an anion-exchange membrane (AEM), as shown in Scheme S1. Since OER is vigorous competitor for COR, OER (in the absence of carbohydrates) was also conducted for reference. In the polarization curve of OER (Fig. 3 a–d), an oxidation current peak at about 1.4 V vs RHE was observed for Co3FePx@NF. This peak was related to the oxidation of divalent metals to trivalent under anodic treatment, in agreement with previous reports of other transition metal sulfides and phosphides [44]. However, the oxidation current sign disappeared with the addition of the carbohydrates (Fig. 3a–d). Therefore, it is necessary to activate the Co3FePx@NF to a stable state in 1.0 M KOH without carbohydrates, before recording the polarization curves of COR. In the pure alkaline media, a potential of ∼1.47 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a–d (upside) and Fig. S2a) and Tafel slop of 45 mV dec−1 (Fig. S2b) were achieved for Co3FePx@NF. These values are both much lower than the values of a commercial RuO2/IrO2@Ti anode (potential of 1.55 V vs RHE and a Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1, Fig. S2a–b), demonstrating its excellent OER activity. When 0.1 M carbohydrate substrates were introduced in 1.0 M KOH, the cell potential required to reach 10 mA cm−2 for COR (∼1.24 V vs RHE) shifted negatively by approximately 230 mV compared to the OER (Fig. 3a–d (upside)), indicating that a more thermodynamically-favorable carbohydrate oxidation had been achieved compared to the OER. To achieve higher current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, the COR required potentials of 1.32 V, 1.36 V and 1.40 V vs RHE, respectively (Fig. 3a–d (downside)). These values were nearly 160 mV, 140 mV, and 110 mV lower than their corresponding values for OER (which required 1.48 V, 1.50 V, and 1.51 V vs RHE to obtain 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively, shown in Fig. 3a–d (downside)), implying that a better conversion efficiency had been achieved for the electrical-to-chemical energy production for COR via Co3FePx@NF electrocatalysis. To demonstrate the universality of Co3FePx@NF for COR, the specific potential and electrical energy input per kilogram of produced hydrogen by the carbohydrate electrolyzer fed with the above common saccharides, monosaccharides (glucose and fructose), disaccharides (maltose and sucrose), and polysaccharides (soluble amylum as a case study, Fig. S3) were compared in Table 1 . The Co3FePx@NF showed similarly excellent catalytic activities for monosaccharides and disaccharides (1.32 ± 0.01 V vs RHE @50 mA cm−2) and displayed a lower one for the polysaccharide (1.42 V vs RHE @50 mA cm−2). It was suspected that the relatively slow kinetic rate of the polysaccharide oxidation was due to the carbohydrates (or oxidation products) with molecular weights too large to adsorb/desorb on the catalyst surface. Even so, Co3FePx@NF catalysts for the carbohydrate electrolyzer fed with either oligosaccharides or polysaccharides exhibited lower electrical energy input per kilogram of produced hydrogen (Table 1), indicating its “carbohydrate-universal” nature. According to the experimental results, among these common carbohydrates, fructose was slightly more energy-efficient during hydrogen production (34.65 KWh kg−1 H2). However, combined with energy consumption and practical application, we do not recommend the use of any pure carbohydrate, but rather recommend the use of degraded carbohydrate-containing waste (such as food leftovers, molasses, papermaking wastewater, and so on) which contains complex types of saccharides. Thus, the extraction or synthesis of pure carbohydrates requiring high energy consumption can be eliminated, and the energy-saving hydrogen production can be achieved via electrochemical reforming of biomass wastes. This was attributed to the “carbohydrate-universal” nature of Co3FePx@NF without special selectivity towards any particular carbohydrate. The outstanding performances of the as-prepared catalyst for COR were further demonstrated by obtaining the polarization curves and the corresponding Tafel plots of RuO2/IrO2@Ti for COR for comparison, which are shown in Fig. S2(a–b). Notably, the potential required to achieve a 50 mA cm−2 current density for COR (∼1.32 V vs RHE) on Co3FePx@NF was 290 mV lower than that required for RuO2/IrO2@Ti (∼1.61 V vs RHE). Additionally, Co3FePx@NF showed a significantly smaller Tafel slope for COR (∼100 mV dec−1) than RuO2/IrO2@Ti (≥169 mV dec−1). The performance of Co3FePx@NF when used for COR surpassed that of most of the recently-reported GORs and other biomass oxidation electrocatalysts, such as Fe2P/SSM [27], NiCoP/Ti [28], Ni NPs/TiOxNy [45], and others, as shown in Table S1. These results suggest that Co3FePx@NF is a promising and highly efficient catalyst for COR. The Co3FePx nanowires played a dominant role in the excellent performance because of the almost negligible electrocatalytic activities of the blank NF for both OER and COR relative to those of Co3FePx@NF (see in Fig. S4). Still, both the NF (Fig. S4) and RuO2/IrO2@Ti (Fig. S2) exhibited catalytic activities for COR in the order of mono- ≫ di- ≫ poly-saccharides, while the Co3FePx@NF showed activity in the order of mono- ≈ di- > poly-saccharides (Table 1). This highlights the “carbohydrate-universal” nature and highly efficient activity of the Co3FePx@NF, especially for the oxidation of oligosaccharides."
10,Stability of Co3FePx@NF for COR,"3.3 Stability of Co3FePx@NF for COR In addition to catalytic activity, stability and durability are also important requirements for a suitable and promising electrocatalyst for COR. The OER, MOR (remaining 92.7%), and SOR (remaining 93.3%) chronoamperometry curves showed negligible loss of current densities over a 24 h period (Fig. 4 a), demonstrating the excellent catalytic stability of Co3FePx@NF for water and disaccharides oxidation. In contrast, decreasing chronoamperometry curves were observed for GOR and FOR (GOR remaining 61.4% and FOR remaining 45.1% after 24 h of operation, Fig. 4a). A smaller current drop was observed in carbohydrates with higher molecular weights (mono- > di-saccharides). It was suspected that the total exchanged number of electrons was determined by the concentration of the reducing end unit (C1 in Fig. 3), at which position the carbohydrate was selectively oxidized to allow the exchange of two electrons per mole [46]. The concentration of reducing end unit was equivalent to that of monosaccharides, while for di- (or poly-) saccharides, the reducing end unit is continuously generated due to the imbalance of disaccharide degradation via COR [47]. In addition, the more efficient COR causes the reducing end unit to be consumed faster so that the current drops more obviously. Therefore, these decreasing rates of current densities of COR were consistent with the efficient activities in the order: FOR > GOR > MOR > SOR. Notably, there was no loss of catalytic activity for Co3FePx@NF after all above COR, as evidenced by the nearly identical polarization curves of Co3FePx@NF before (labeled as Initial) and after 24 h chronoamperometry test (labeled as Post) for COR utilizing the same fresh electrolyte (Fig. 4b). In addition, the 100-h long-term stability of Co3FePx@NF for COR using glucose as a case study was also demonstrated (Fig. S5a). To avoid completely consuming glucose, the electrolyte was replaced after 50 h. As shown in Fig. S5b and c, the Co3FePx@NF retained its high catalytic activities for both OER and GOR after 50 h and 100 h of continuous work in the glucose electrolyte, highlighting its long-term stability. SEM and XPS analyses were performed to investigate the changes in the morphology and composition of Co3FePx@NF after COR (using GOR as a case study) stability test. SEM observation (Fig. 4c) indicated that, slightly different from the initial Co3FePx@NF, the post-COR Co3FePx nanowires were substantially coarse and formed bundles, possibly due to the formation of metal hydroxides/oxide during the 24-h COR in an alkaline solution [48]. This conclusion was additionally supported by the near-complete disappearance of the P peak in the P 2p XPS spectrum of post-COR Co3FePx@NF (Fig. S6). In addition, the peaks assigned to metals Co 2p3/2 and Fe 2p3/2 in phosphide at 778.1 and 707.2 eV in the high-resolution XPS spectra of the initial Co3FePx@NF were absent in the post-COR Co3FePx@NF spectrum (Fig. S6), further demonstrating that the phosphide had been reformed to hydroxides/oxide on the outer layer of Co3FePx@NF upon COR in alkaline solution. In summary, the results indicated that the actual active sites of Co3FePx@NF for COR could be attributed to the oxidized bimetallic alloy."
11,HER catalyzed by Co3FePx@NF,"3.4 HER catalyzed by Co3FePx@NF Having confirmed the exceptional COR activity of Co3FePx@NF, its catalytic activity toward HER was also investigated in 1.0 M KOH in the presence of 0.1 M carbohydrate to evaluate whether HER could be coupled with COR in a single electrolyzer using the same catalysts. Fig. 5 a presents the polarization curves of Co3FePx@NF for HER without and with different carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose) labeled as HER, G-, F-, M- and S-HER, respectively. In the absence of the carbohydrates, Co3FePx@NF exhibited excellent HER activity, as shown in Fig. 5(a–b) and Fig. S7(a–b). Co3FePx@NF required a potential of 117 mV vs RHE to deliver the current density of 20 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt@Ti (which required 111 mV vs RHE to achieve 20 mA cm−2, Fig. S7). Notably, the polarization curves of Co3FePx@NF displayed a greater acceleration to reach a high current density than that of the commercial Pt@Ti. In Fig. 5a, the near-overlap of the HER, G- and F-HER polarization curves demonstrates that the Co3FePx@NF retained its activity for HER even in the presence of monosaccharides. However, with the addition of maltose and sucrose, the HER polarization curve showed slight cathodic shifts of 11 mV and 7 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2, respectively. These shifts in potential could be attributed to the sluggish adsorption of water and desorption of gas in slightly viscous disaccharide solution [49]. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1 for HER exhibited a negligible and maximum increase of 11 mV dec−1 after addition of carbohydrates (Fig. 5b). The above results confirm that the carbohydrates had a negligible effect on the excellent HER activity of Co3FePx@NF. Additionally, HER stabilities of Co3FePx@NF were verified by chronoamperometry experiments in 1.0 KOH with and without 0.1 M carbohydrate (glucose as a representative), as shown in Fig. 5c. There was no significant loss of current density at -107 mV vs RHE after 24 h operation, demonstrating the excellent HER stability of Co3FePx@NF, both in the absence and presence of carbohydrates."
12,Coupling HER and COR to assemble an energy-saving electrolyzer,"3.5 Coupling HER and COR to assemble an energy-saving electrolyzer Based on the favorable electrocatalytic activities and stabilities of Co3FePx@NF for both COR and HER, the Co3FePx@NF catalyst was employed as both the anode and cathode to assemble a two-electrode carbohydrate electrolyzer via coupling COR and HER. The performance of the carbohydrate electrolyzer was assessed using 0.1 M glucose as a case study with an overall water-splitting cell for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the combination of HER and GOR presented a negative and approximately parallel displacement of the polarization curve, indicating that the glucose electrolyzer provided a thermodynamic advantage with negligible kinetic reduction compared to the overall water-splitting cell. As illustrated in Fig. 6b, the glucose electrolyzer required low cell voltages of about 1.35, 1.50, 1.59, and 1.74 V to afford current densities of 10, 50, 100 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively, while the overall water-splitting cell consumed higher cell voltages of around 1.58, 1.67, 1.75 and 1.85 V, respectively. The glucose electrolyzer required a cell voltage of 1.35 V (to reach 10 mA cm−2) saved 230 mV compared to that of the overall water electrolysis. Such voltage consumption was also much lower than that used in commercial water splitting systems (nomarlly 1.8–2.0 V) [50], as well as other recently-reported biomass electrolyzers (Table S1). This highlights that the electrolyzer reported here has great promise for use in energy-saving H2 production. The Co3FePx@NF catalyst displayed commendable energy conversion efficiency in glucose electrolyzer for hydrogen production. Furthermore, unlike the overall water-splitting cell, no O2 bubbles were released on the anode surface for the glucose electrolyzer during the reported potential range (see videos S1 in supporting information), suggesting that pure hydrogen was produced without the need for separation equipment. The total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer was employed to assess whether the mineralization of glucose occurred. If CO2 was produced, an inorganic salt (Na2CO3) would have formed in alkaline solution, which will lead to the decrease concentration of TOC. As shown in Fig. S8a, the TOC concentration of the post-GOR electrolyte after cycling from 0.8 to 2.2 V (200 cycles, 5 mV s−1) shares almost the same value with the initial one, indicating that no inorganic carbon formed in the glucose electrolyzer. In addition, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production in the glucose electrolyzer was measured to be nearly 100% through the water-gas displacing method (Fig.S8b). Next, a three-cycle chronoamperometric experiment [51] was performed at the cell voltage of 1.58 V to evaluate the long-term stability of Co3FePx@NF catalyst couple for the glucose electrolyzer (Fig. 6c). Fresh glucose solution (0.1 M glucose in 1.0 M KOH) as the electrolyte was supplied at the start of each cycle. In the first cycle, the current density decreased from nearly 80 mA cm−2 to 15 mA cm−2 over 15 h due to the depletion of glucose. Then, in the second cycle, the current density recovered to around 70 mA cm−2 upon the addition of fresh glucose solution. A 12.5% decrease in the reset current density was observed, which could be attributed to the reorganization and loss of active species of Co3FePx@NF catalyst. This conclusion was further confirmed by the same decrease in chronoamperometric curve of overall water splitting over the first 15 h. The curve of the third cycle was nearly identical to the second one (Fig. 6c), which confirms the excellent long-term stability of Co3FePx@NF for synchronous electrocatalysis of HER and GOR."
13,Coupling HER and COR in an overall-sustainable photolyzer,"3.6 Coupling HER and COR in an overall-sustainable photolyzer To meet the goal of developing an overall-sustainable hydrogen production process, a solar-driven carbohydrate electrolyzer (with glucose as representative case) was assembled by connecting a single perovskite solar cell with the Co3FePx@NF bifunctional catalyst (Fig. 7 a). Using simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G), the single perovskite solar cell (PSC, 0.2 cm2) containing Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95PbI2.55Br0.45 [52] exhibited an open circuit potential (Voc) of 1.12 V, a short circuit current density (J sc) of 21.03 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7%, as shown in Fig. 7b. From the intersection of the j-V curves of the PSC and Co3FePx@NF couple in the glucose electrolyzer, it was determined that this solar-driven device provided a high current density (normalized to the area of a PSC) of around 13 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7b). This value was further confirmed by the unbiased photocurrent of the solar-driven device under intermittent simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 7c). The photocurrent corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of 13.3% (Fig. 7b), which was close to the PCE value, indicating that there was only 2.4% energy loss during the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. The glucose photolyzer using a common electrode couple (RuO2/IrO2@Ti//Pt@Ti) exhibited a relatively lower STH of 9.2% (Fig. S9), implying that a superior energy conversion efficiency was obtained via Co3FePx@NF electrocatalysis. To assess the stability of this photolyzer, the current densities of repeated on-off cycles were recorded during the initial 9 min (Fig. 7c). The overall decrease in current was due to the consumption of glucose and the light instability of the PSC, while the current response was in good agreement with the chopped simulated sunlight. It was found that the performance of the solar-driven glucose electrolyzer was limited by the PCE and the instability of the PSC with large area. Further advances in modularization and encapsulation techniques can readily address these limitations. Notably, the glucose electrolyzer was driven by only one solar cell to obtain homogeneous H2 bubbles at the cathode (Fig. 7a, Video S2) due to the low open circuit potential of the glucose electrolyzer using the Co3FePx@NF catalyst couple, whereas at least two cells in series are required for overall water-splitting cell, regardless of perovskite [50], silicon [53,54], or GaAs [5] solar cells. The result further highlights the energy-saving nature of the carbohydrate electrolyzer developed in this study. To further demonstrate the practical application of this photolyzer, molasses (50 mg mL−1), a carbohydrate-containing waste from the sugar industry, was used as a model electrolyte in the carbohydrate-universal photolyzer for hydrogen production. A current density of approximately 7 mA cm−2 was obtained (Fig. S10), which suggests that the electrolyzer using Co3FePx@NF as a “carbohydrate-universal” and bifunctional catalyst has potential uses not only in energy-saving hydrogen production but also in the simultaneous treatment of carbohydrate-containing waste."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, an energy-saving electrolyzer for hydrogen production has been reported and assembled for HER and simultaneous COR in a single cell using Co3FePx@NF as bifunctional catalysts. The energy-saving nature was attributed to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co3FePx@NF for “universal” COR with a potential of ∼1.24 V vs RHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was at least 230 mV lower than that required for pure water splitting. This meant that the general electrolyzer required a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This low cell voltage surpasses that of most of the previously-reported hydrogen-producing electrolyzers. Due to the low energy consumption, this novel electrolyzer can be powered by only a single perovskite solar cell to deliver a high STH of 13.3%, which helps to achieve overall-sustainable hydrogen production in a facile and efficient manner. More importantly, this carbohydrate-universal electrolyzer/photolyzer also enables the carbohydrate-containing wastes to be used, which avoids the unnecessary and wasteful disposal of bioresources. The multifunctional electrolyzer/photolyzer developed in this paper demonstrates an eco-friendly fuel generation system, which allows energy-saving hydrogen production via simultaneous treatment of organic waste."
