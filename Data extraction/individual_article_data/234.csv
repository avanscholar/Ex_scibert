0,Introduction,"The advances of an economy based on the use of fossil fuels adversely affects the environment causing, for example, acid rain or global warming. In order to prevent the destruction of the environment in which we live, it is necessary to reduce the emission of pollutants, including CO2. One of the ways to achieve this goal is to change the way of thinking and implement hydrogen as a fuel. Hydrogen can be used to produce electricity in fuel cells. It can be produced from water, alcohols, hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof. To make energy produced from hydrogen environmentally friendly, hydrogen should be produced from renewable raw materials. Ethanol is obtained from biomass in the fermentation process and is a renewable raw material. Theoretically, 3 mol of hydrogen can be recovered directly from ethanol in the decomposition process (R1) or partial oxidation (R2) and 4 mol in the process of steam reforming (R3). (R1) C2H5OH→CO + C+3H2 C2H5OH+1/2O2→2CO+3H2 (R2) C2H5OH + H2O→2CO+4H2 (R3) There are also competitive and subsequent reactions that can decrease or increase hydrogen production, e.g.: (R4) C2H5OH↔CH3CHO + H2 (R5) C2H5OH→C2H4+H2O (R6) C2H5OH→CO + CH4+H2 (R7) CO + H2O↔CO2+H2 (R8) CH4+H2O↔CO+3H2 (R9) CH3CHO↔CH4+CO CH3CHO + H2O↔2CO+3H2 R10) (R11) C2H4→2H2+2C (R12) CH4↔2H2+C (R13) C2H4+H2↔C2H6 (R14) C2H4↔C2H2+H2 (R15) C + H2O↔CO + H2 The water gas shift reaction (R7) is particularly important. It consumes toxic CO and produces H2 and CO2. As a result, hydrogen production increases. As a result of reactions R3 and R7, up to 6 mol of hydrogen can be produced from 1 mol of ethanol. CO2, which is obtained in the production of hydrogen from ethanol (coming from biomass) will be used up again by plants and will not accumulate in the atmosphere. For now, there is no cheaper and more efficient technology of hydrogen production than from ethanol. Studies in this area are currently performed by many research groups. Plasma technologies are among the investigated methods applied to carry out the process. Plasma studies are conducted on steam reforming, partial oxidation and ethanol decomposition. High conversion of ethanol is achieved in different plasma systems [1–10], but usually many different products are formed (Table 1 ). The selectivity of the chemical reactions in the plasma is low. While selectivity of the chemical reactions occurring over catalysts is high. In those studies only H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and coke have been determined in the outlet stream [11–13]. Coke, when deposited in a large amount, blocks the flow of reactants through the reactor. This is a significant problem in catalytic reactors. Plasma reactors are usually insensitive to coke formation because there are no narrow places in the gas flow path in which coke could accumulate and block the flow. The catalysts in the process of ethanol steam reforming can be different materials. In our studies, cobalt supported on ZrO2 (Co/ZrO2) was used. A.J. Vizicaino et al. [14] reported that the use of Co leads to less coke formation than when Ni is used. N. Pinton et al. [15] and B. Zhang et al. [16] reported that cobalt catalysts are more stable than nickel catalysts. H. Song et al. [17] reported that in the steam reforming of ethanol ZrO2 is a better carrier for the cobalt catalyst than Al2O3 or TiO2. The use of plasma-catalyst systems should make it possible to reduce the selectivity of the conversion of ethanol to hydrocarbons. C.M. Du et al. [10] reported that in the plasma-catalytic reactor higher ethanol conversion and higher hydrogen production were obtained than in the plasma reactor. But surprisingly, methane production has always been high. This could be due to the use of a gliding discharge in which there is high temperature or the use of an inappropriate catalyst. Our earlier work on plasma-catalytic reactors [18–20] indicates that only some catalysts significantly changed the selectivity of the reaction. Moreover, some materials introduced into the plasma become inhibitors. It is also important to properly place the catalyst in order to prevent the coke from blocking the gas flow. In these studies, the plasma was produced in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), and the catalyst was placed in the grooves of the high voltage electrode. In this configuration, the width of the discharge gap through which the gas was passed was not filled with the catalyst. An additional purpose of using the grooves was to disturb the flow so that the reactants would mix better and the coke was removed from the reactor through the gas stream. The discharge did not require the introduction of additional gases."
1,Setup and materials,"1.1 Setup and materials A schematic diagram of the experimental setup, which was used in the experiments, is shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor (Fig. 2 ) was composed of a grooved high-voltage electrode, which was made of duralumin. The total length of the high-voltage electrode was 88 mm. The high-voltage electrode was in a quartz tube with a wall thickness of 3 mm. The outside wall of the quartz tube was covered with a layer of aluminum. The layer of aluminum was a grounded electrode. The temperature of the reactor wall was measured by an analog temperature meter with a Pt–PtRh thermocouple. The width of the discharge gap between the top of the groove and the quartz tube was 1.5 mm. In the grooves, there were 10 catalyst rings (Fig. 3 ). The average mass of a single catalyst ring was 12 g. In studies without the catalyst, rings made of support (ZrO2) were placed in the grooves. The discharge occurs in the space where the distance between the high-voltage electrode and the dielectric is the shortest. There is no catalyst in this space. The flow rates of the water and ethanol feeding streams were 0.75 and 0.25 mol/h, respectively, and were regulated by mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst/EIEWIN), calibrated to water and ethanol. In our previous studies of obtaining hydrogen from a mixture of water and ethanol in the barrier discharge it has been observed that the process of hydrogen production from water and ethanol is preferably carried out at a 3:1 M ratio of water to ethanol and at a flow rate of the feed stream of the reactor of 1 mol/h, [21]. The coke was filtered in a quartz fiber filter. The gases were cooled to 22–24 °C and water and ethanol were condensed. The amount of condensed liquid was measured by weight, and the ethanol concentration in the liquid was determined from the refractive index. The gas flow rate was measured with the Illmer-Gasmesstechnik gas-meter, the temperature and water vapor content in the gases were measured with the Apar AR236/2 sensor. The concentration of the other gases was measured using the HP6890 gas chromatograph with a TCD detector. The ZrO2 support was prepared from micro-powder (HC STARC, trade name: Amperit 805.0) and nano-powder (TOSOH CORPORATION, trade name: TZ-8YS) of ZrO2, polyethylene and paraffinic hydrocarbonwax (WACHS UND CERESIN-FABRIKEN TH.C.TROMM GmbH, trade name: TECERO-WACHS TPP 300), yellow dextrin (POCh) and polyvinyl alcohol (POCh). The micro-and nano-powders of ZrO2 were mixed in a weight ratio of 7:3. Then wax and yellow dextrin were added at 15 and 10%wt., respectively, of the total weight of both powders. After mixing the solid ingredients, a 10% aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was added dropwise to obtain a consistency suitable for molding the rings. Molded rings were dried at room temperature for 24 h. They were then sintered at 1600 °C for 2 h. After cooling the support to room temperature, an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 .6H2O (ABCR GmbH) was applied to the support by dry impregnation. The impregnated samples were dried for 24 h, calcined at 600 °C for 24 h, reduced in hydrogen at 400 °C for 6 h and cooled in a hydrogen atmosphere to 40 °C. The morphology (Fig. 4 ) of the catalyst was studied with scanning electron microscope (SEM) using electron microscope Hitachi SU8000 with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis system. Cobalt covered almost the entire surface of the support. The surface area (SBET) of the catalyst was 0.43 m2/g. The surface area was measured using Micromeritics 2020 apparatus by absorption of N2 at liquid nitrogen temperature, with the p/po ratio in the range 0.05–0.3. The reducibility of the obtained catalyst was studied using the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was performed using an AutoChem 2920 (Micromeritics) chemisorption analyzer. In the reduction profile only one sharp peak with a maximum at the temperature of 388 °C is observed. It is associated with the one-step reduction of Co3O4 oxide to metallic cobalt: Co3O4+4H2→3Co+4H2O (R16) The catalyst reduction process occurred in the temperature range of 270–430 °C. Based on the recorded hydrogen consumption the cobalt content in the studied catalyst was determined and equals 14.8 wt%. The discharge was turned on at the same time as the start of the introduction of substrates into the reactor. Discharge parameters like the voltage and the current (Fig. 5 ) were recorded every 15 min, using the Tektronix 3032 oscilloscope with the Tektronix 6015A voltage probe and the Tektronix TCP312 current probe, as well as the Tektronix TCP A300 amplifier. Based on these measurements, the discharge power was calculated according to a formula: (1) P = f ⋅ ∫ U ( t ) ⋅ I ( t ) d t The reactor was powered by power supply system of 15 kHz frequency. The electric capacity of the reactor with the catalyst and with the support only is similar and is 0.387 and 0.380 nF, respectively. In the dielectric barrier reactors the electric capacity of the gas gap is much smaller than the electric capacity of the dielectric. Therefore, the electric capacity of the gas gap determines the electric capacity of the reactor. The following parameters were used to assess the process of ethanol steam reforming: hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, ethane and coke yield, ethanol conversion, energy yield, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentration. The amount of coke formed was calculated based on the carbon balance. Other parameters were measured or calculated according to the following formulas: (2) W [ i ] = q ⋅ c i V W[i] – formation of the chemical compound, mol h−1. q – gas flow rate under standard conditions, dm3 h−1. V - molar volume of gas under standard conditions, dm3 mol.−1. ci – volume fraction of chemical compound. (3) x = W i n [ E t O H ] − W [ E t O H ] W i n [ E t O H ] 100 % W[EtOH] – ethanol flow rate at the outlet, mol h−1. Win[EtOH] – ethanol flow rate at the inlet, mol h−1. (4) Y = W [ H 2 ] 1000 ⋅ P Y – energy yield, mol(H2) kWh−1."
2,Results and discussion,"The catalyst was active from a temperature of 350 °C. At this temperature its activity was very low, ethanol conversion was only 2%. In the catalytic process, the reaction products were H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and coke. H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and coke were the products of chemical reactions occurring in the plasma reactor (Fig. 6 ). The yield of H2, CO and coke increased strongly with increasing discharge power. Hydrocarbon yield increased slowly with increasing discharge power. The CO2 yield was very small and practically constant in the entire range of discharge power. H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and coke were also formed in the plasma catalytic reactor (Fig. 7 ). Unfortunately, the combination of the catalyst and plasma did not reduce the number of chemical reaction products. However, the relative amounts of products have changed. H2 and CO2 yields increased strongly with the increase in power. The maximum discharge power used in the studies was 60 W. The further increase of the power in order to achieve higher hydrogen production was impossible because the temperature increased with the power of the discharge. At the maximum power used the temperature was 340 °C. And the seals were made of silicone with a durability up to 350 °C. The formation of H2 and CO2 in the plasma-catalytic reactor was greater than in the plasma reactor. In contrast, the yield of CO, C2H4 and C2H6 in the plasma-catalytic reactor was smaller than in the plasma reactor. At the lowest power, 20 W, the yield of C2H4 and C2H6 in the plasma-catalytic reactor was 17 and 13% lower than in the plasma reactor. The effect of the catalyst on the production of these compounds increased with increasing discharge power. At 60 W, a very large catalyst effect on the yield of C2H4 and C2H6 was observed. At this power, the yield of C2H4 in the plasma-catalytic reactor was 12 times lower than in the plasma reactor, whereas the production of C2H6 was 3 times lower. In contrast, methane production was similar in both reactors. The increase in H2 yield in the plasma-catalytic reactor was not a consequence of the increase in ethanol conversion. The ethanol conversion in plasma-catalytic and plasma reactors was the same (Fig. 8 ). The combination of the catalyst and the plasma gave a positive effect because the yield of hydrogen and carbon dioxide increased. It is also interesting that in the plasma reactor the concentration of hydrogen in the cooled gas was about 48% in the whole range of applied discharge powers. However, in the plasma-catalytic reactor the hydrogen concentration increased from 49 to 56% with the increase of the discharge power from 20 to 60 W. This is related to the increase in CO2 concentration from 1.3 to 13.6% and the decrease in CO concentration from 20 to 6.5%. This positive effect indicates the change in the reaction mechanism under the influence of the catalyst. The positive effect of the catalyst and plasma interaction on the hydrogen yield was also observed by C. M. Du et al. [10] and Y. Xin et al. [22]. However, the mechanism of catalyst interaction in the plasma-catalytic system is not fully explained. Higher efficiency of plasma-catalytic processes compared to plasma and catalytic processes may be due to several reasons, e.g. increase in the internal energy, photo-catalytic effect, presence of reactive radicals. In plasma processes, the most important role is played by high-energy electrons. The collision of molecules with such electrons initiates chemical reactions. During micro-discharging, high-energy electrons collide with molecules the internal energy of molecules increases and active radicals are formed, e.g. H2O + e = HO +H +e (R17) C2H5OH + e = CH3CH2O +H +e (R18) C2H5OH + e = CH3CHOH +H +e (R19) C2H5OH + e = C2H5 +OH +e (R20) C2H5OH + e = CH2CH2OH +H +e (R21) C2H5OH + e = CH3 +CH2OH +e (R22) CH3CHOH is the most stable of all the radicals produced from ethanol [23]. However, the electrons are not selective and therefore all radicals may be formed. Moreover, other species also can by present in non-thermal plasma and take part in chemical reactions. For example, L. Bardos et al. [9] generated pulsed discharge (frequency of 15 kHz) in ethanol and water mixture and reported that various excited states of hydrogen and oxygen were detected by optical emission spectroscopy. Oxygen can come from the further breakdown of radicals. This indicates that other radicals can also breakdown into other species, e.g. CH3CH2O = CH3 +CH2O (R23) CH3CH2O = CH3CHO + H (R24) CH3CH2O = C2H5 +O (R25) CH3CHOH = CH3 +CHOH (R26) CH3CHOH = C2H4+OH (R27) C2H5 = C2H4+H (R28) C2H5 = CH3 +CH2 (R29) CH2CH2OH = CH2+CH2OH (R30) CH2CH2OH = C2H4+OH (R31) DBD is a specific discharge. It consists of a number of micro-discharges. The reactions with high-energy electrons (R17-R22) occur only in micro-channels occupied by micro-discharges. The duration of a single micro-discharge is 0.1–10 ns, the diameter of the micro-discharge channel is ∼0.1 mm, the density of electrons in the micro-discharge channel ranges from 1014 to 1015 cm−3, the electron energy is 1–10 eV [24]. The electron energy is sufficient to initiate dissociation and to excitation of all of the reactants fed into the reactor (H2O, C2H5OH). In gases the process of excitation of molecules is more efficient than the dissociation process. However, for water vapor the collisions leading to vibrational excitations of molecules are the most numerous only for electrons of energy up to 1.2 eV. For electrons with energy from 1.2 to 3.6 eV collisions leading to dissociation are the most numerous (their share reaches 60%). In collisions with electrons with energy higher than 3.6 eV, the electron excitation of molecules most often occurs and the share of collisions leading to dissociation is reduced to ∼20% [25]. After a micro-discharge has occurred, the active radicals and excited molecules react further. According to the Macharet-Fridman theory [25,26], excited molecules react more easily because the increase in the internal energy of the substrates reduces the activation energy of chemical reactions. Therefore, after excitation of the substrates in the plasma, the R1-R15 reactions will run more efficiently. Moreover, the excited state is an unstable state and molecules move to more stable states by losing energy by emitting photons or heat. In the presence of photo-catalysts, photons also initiate chemical reactions. In the presence of water the part of cobalt may exist as CoO, Co3O4 [27], which are photo-catalysts, on which the water splitting process takes place [28]: 2H2O = 4H++O2+4e (R32) 2H++2e = H2 (R33) The presence of radicals, excited molecules, photons may explain the catalyst activity at the reactor temperature lower than 350 °C. It should be noted that the catalyst is active for various chemical reactions at different temperature ranges. The temperature of the reactants is locally much higher than the average gas temperature in the reactor. S. Jodzis [29,30] reported that in the channel after micro-discharge the temperature is ∼100 °C higher than the average gas temperature. But the energy is quickly dissipated into the gas in the vicinity of the channel and the temperature of the active species is reduced. Ethanol reactions on the catalyst at low temperature (below 350 °C) practically do not take place, so it should be assumed that the differences between the composition of products in plasma and plasma-catalytic reactors result from the reaction of radicals and excited molecules on the catalyst surface. The production of methane is the same in both reactors, so it can be assumed that methane is produced in the gas-phase reactions, but not in catalytic reactions. Probably methane is formed directly from ethanol (R6) or from radical scavenging: CH3 +H = CH4 (R34) The production of coke is also similar. So it can be assumed that the reactions leading to its formation also take place without contact with the catalyst: The production of C2H4, C2H6 and CO is much lower in the plasma-catalytic reactor than in the plasma reactor. So it can be assumed that the radicals from which these products are formed are adsorbed on the catalyst surface and react with the water adsorbed on the catalyst surface, e.g. CH2+2H2OCO2+2H2 (R35) CH2O + H2OCO2+3H2 (R36) C2H5 +4H2O = 2CO2+6H2+H (R37) CH3CHOH +3H2O = 2CO2+5H2+H (R38) CH2CH2OH +3H2O = 2CO2+5H2+H (R39) Reactions R35-R39 increase the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. As a result of these reactions, the CO2 concentration in the cooled gases was higher at the expense of the CO concentration (Fig. 9 ). The increase in the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide could be due to the acceleration of the water gas shift reaction (R7), but this is unlikely because cobalt is not an active catalyst for this reaction at low temperatures. The occurrence of these reactions results in a decrease in the production of CO, C2H4 and C2H6, while the production of CO2 and hydrogen radicals increases. A further effect of which is to increase hydrogen production: H +H = H2 (R40) In the production of hydrogen from ethanol and water, the interaction of the catalyst and plasma was effective and increased the yield of hydrogen. Due to the greater amount of hydrogen formed in the plasma-catalytic reactor, the energy yield of hydrogen production was higher in the plasma-catalytic reactor than in the plasma reactor (Fig. 7). In the plasma reactor, the energy yield decreased with the increase of the discharge power, whereas the energy yield in the plasma catalytic reactor increased from 6.0 to 7.7 mol(H2).kWh−1 with the increase of the discharge power from 20 to 60 W. This means that the energy supplied to the plasma-catalytic reactor was used more efficiently to carry out chemical reactions that give the desired product than the energy supplied to the plasma reactor. The comparison of the energy efficiency of hydrogen production (Table 2 ) by different methods is difficult because there are many various additional factors, e.g. the substrates are evaporated before introduction into the reactor [2,3], there is reduced pressure [9,31], the catalyst is additionally heated [32], etc. Usually, the energy used only in the plasma reactor is published, but the energy used in the additional operations is ignored, and this can significantly affect the energy efficiency of hydrogen production. In this work, water and ethanol were introduced into the plasma reactor at room temperature and in the reactor they were heated, evaporated and reacted. Coke was formed during ethanol steam reforming. The formation of coke is usually not a problem in the plasma reactor, although catalytic reactors are sensitive to coking. In the plasma-catalytic reactor, a part of the coke deposited on the catalyst, but the hydrogen production and the ethanol conversion did not change during the operation of the reactor. M. Greluk et al. [33] reported that with a large amount of Co (29% Co was used in their studies), the resulting coke did not deactivate the catalyst. On such catalysts, coke was deposited in the form of long whiskers with the cobalt particle at the tip. Coking was a problem in the catalytic reactor because the coke blocked the gas flow through the reactor. In the plasma-catalytic reactor, the discharge gap was 1.5 mm at the narrowest point and the coke was not deposited there. At this point, the linear velocity of the gas flow was the greatest, since the cross section was the smallest. In addition, micro-discharges were located here and there were rapid changes in gas temperature, which further disturbed the gas flow. As a result, the coke particles were entrained by the gas stream and removed from the reactor. As a result, coking did not affect the functioning of the plasma-catalytic reactor."
3,Conclusions,"The same products were formed in the plasma and the plasma-catalytic reactors, i.e. H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and coke. The ethanol conversion increased with increasing discharge power and was the same in both reactors. However, hydrogen yield in the plasma-catalytic reactor was greater than in the plasma reactor. The ratio of the hydrogen yield in the plasma-catalytic reactor to that in the plasma reactor increased from 1 to 2.4 with increasing discharge power from 20 to 60 W. The increase in the hydrogen formation was mainly due to the increased importance of the water gas shift reaction. In the plasma reactor, the CO2 concentration was always less than 1.3% and the CO concentration was always greater than 20%. In the plasma-catalytic reactor, the CO2 and H2 concentration increased from 1.3 to 15.2% and from 49 to 56%, respectively, with the increase of the discharge power from 20 to 60 W. At the same time, CO concentration decreased from 20.3 to 7.2%. Production of C2H4 and C2H6 also decreased in the plasma-catalytic reactor. The plasma-catalytic reactor was more effective than the plasma reactor in the formation of hydrogen from ethanol and water. In addition to the greater hydrogen yield, the energy yield in the plasma-catalytic reactor was higher than in the plasma reactor. The catalyst temperature is too low for the reaction of ethanol and water, but the active particles formed in the plasma react with the water adsorbed on the catalyst."
