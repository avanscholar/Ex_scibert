0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (CH3 CHCHCHO) into crotyl alcohol is an important chemical process, because crotyl alcohol has wide applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance compounds [1–3]. However, hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde often goes through various pathways [4–6]. More importantly, hydrogenation of the CC bond is much easier than that of the CO bond in respect of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, thus selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond while keeping the CC double bond intact during the reaction remains challenging [7–9]. Great efforts have been made to improve catalyst systems for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Noble metal catalysts have been widely applied for this reaction, such as Pt catalysts supported on various oxides [7,10–13] as well as supported Au catalysts [14–18]. Recently, Ir catalysts have been widely studied in selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes, such as crotonaldehyde [19] and citral [20,21]. For example, it was reported that gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Ir/TiO2 resulted in selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 70% at 20–80% conversion. Reyes et al. [22] studied in detail the interfacial properties of an Ir/TiO2 catalyst and concluded that the interfacial metal–TiO x moieties created upon reduction treatment was responsible for the increase in activity and in selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Rojas et al. [23,24] reported the catalytic performance of Ir/TiO2–SiO2 catalysts for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and pointed out that the reduction temperature (500°C) induced the strong metal support interaction effect (SMSI), which improved the Ir catalyst activity and selectivity toward crotyl alcohols. The catalytic behaviors of these catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde depend on various factors, such as the nature of the active metal, the support property, and the preparation conditions. Modification of the active metals by which the morphologies and electronic properties of the active metals could be properly adjusted for the hydrogenation of the CO bond [25–29] has been reported to improve the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. For example, the formation of PtSn alloy was beneficial to the selectivity to crotyl alcohol over a Pt/SnO2 [12]. Besides, the role of support has also been extensively investigated, especially for those reducible oxides because of the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) [6,30]. For example, Dandekar and Vannice [31] reported a Pt/TiO2 catalyst reduced at 500°C was selective for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, due to a strong interaction between the CO group and the Pt–TiO x interface. In addition, surface Lewis acidity of the catalysts are crucial for the selectivity, as it was reported that the surface Lewis acid sites could enhance the adsorption strength of the CO bond, thus resulting in the promotion of selectivity to crotyl alcohol [15,32]. Although much attention has been paid on the catalyst systems, deactivation of the catalysts becomes the biggest hindrance for the development of the catalysts. All the catalysts reported in the literature suffered severe deactivation during the reaction process. The deactivation is mainly due to the high surface acidity of the catalyst which would cause a rapid coke formation and consequently block of active sites [33]. Reyes et al. [22] attributed the deactivation of Ir/TiO2 catalyst to the formation of strongly chemisorbed asymmetric carboxylate and the formation of heavy productions with conjugated CO and CC bonds. Englisch et al. found that the initial activity of the deactivated catalysts was regained by oxidation of the adsorbed CO to CO2 by purging with air [5]. Also, decarbonylation of crotonaldehyde and consequently the irreversible adsorption of CO on the metal surface (such as Pt) is the reason for the loss of activity due to a poisoning effect [34]. It has been reported that supported Ir catalysts undergone deactivation by DRIFTS results and the strong adsorption of CO molecules on the Ir species could block the active Ir sites [35,36]. Therefore, stable catalyst systems seem very important for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. In this work, a series of IrO2/SiO2 catalysts with different Ir loadings were prepared and tested for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, an unexpected finding was that the catalysts were stable and did not suffer deactivation during the reaction. The effect of Ir loading on the catalyst properties and consequently catalytic behaviors was investigated in detail. More attentions were paid to two essential factors that could influence the catalytic behaviors of Ir/SiO2 catalysts: (1) the morphologies and particle size of Ir catalysts and (2) the existence of Irδ+, Ir0 species and the acidic properties of catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The IrO2/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. In a typical preparation, 1g of Ir(acac)3 was dissolved in 50ml of benzene (C Ir =7.696mgml−1). 2.488g of SiO2 (40–120 meshes) was added to 10ml of the solution at room temperature and aged for 3h. After that, excess solution was removed by mild evaporation and the catalyst was dried at 60°C for 12h, followed by calcinations in air at 400°C for 4h. Catalysts with different Ir loadings were prepared in a similar manner. The catalysts were denoted as xIrO2/SiO2, where x refers to the Ir loading in the catalyst (wt.%), and the catalysts reduced at 300°C for 1h in H2 atmosphere were denoted as xIr/SiO2."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40kV and 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 10 to 110°, with a scanning step of 0.15°/s. The mean crystallite sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed on a JEM-2100F microscopy with a field emissive gun, operated at 200kV and with a point resolution of 0.24nm. The samples were prepared by dispersing a few milligrams of powder in ethanol. The dispersion was then immersed for 10min in an ultrasonic bath in order to disagglomerate the powder particles. Finally, one drop was deposited on a Formvar/carbon copper grid. Various regions of the grid were observed and the particle sizes were measured from the observation of 6–20 particles. CO chemisorption experiments were carried out on a Quantachrame CHEMBET-3000 instrument in order to determine the dispersion of Ir. The IrO2/SiO2 catalyst was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and a high-purity He (99.999%) gas flow of 70mlmin−1 was used as the carrier gas. Before CO chemisorption, the samples were reduced in a H2–N2 mixture (5vol% H2) stream at 300°C for 1h, cooled down to 30°C, and then cleaned up with a pure He gas flow for 1h at the same temperature. Then pulses of CO were fed into the stream of carrier gas with a precision analytical syringe. The reduction properties of the samples were measured by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments. The IrO2/SiO2 catalyst was placed in a quartz reactor, and then heated from room temperature to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 in a H2–N2 gas (5vol% H2, 30mlmin−1). The hydrogen consumption during the reduction was determined by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was conducted on a home-made apparatus. 50mg of IrO2/SiO2 catalyst was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) and in situ reduced in a 5% H2–Ar mixture at 300°C for 1h. Then it was cooled down to 50°C. A flow of NH3 (20mlmin−1) was introduced for 30min. The gaseous or physisorbed NH3 was removed by 5% H2–Ar mixture at 100°C for 90min. Then the sample was heated to 700°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. The total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid and back titration with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom-cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of the IrO2/SiO2 catalyst were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a DRIFTS (Harrick, CHC-CHA-3). Prior to the measurement, the IrO2/SiO2 catalyst was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture (10vol% H2, 20mlmin−1) at 300°C for 1h. After that, the Ir/SiO2 catalyst was cooled down to 30°C and a flow of Ar (30mlmin−1) was fed to remove the residual H2. Then the Ir/SiO2 catalyst was exposed to CO–Ar mixture (1vol% CO, 30mlmin−1) for 30min. Finally, the catalyst was purged by Ar for another 30min and the spectra were recorded. In all cases the spectra were taken at 30°C, with a resolution of 4cm−1 and cumulative 32 scans. For the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) study, 50mg of the used 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst was placed in the middle of a quartz microreactor with an inner diameter of 6mm. The outlet was analyzed on-line by mass spectrometry (Qic-20 Benchtop, Hiden Analytical). Then the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst was exposed in an O2 flow (99.99%, 20mlmin−1) from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The mass numbers of 44 and 18 were selected to monitor the desorption of CO2 and H2O fragments, respectively."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The gas phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was performed in a fixed bed reaction system at atmospheric pressure, using a quartz tube (i.d.=8mm) reactor. 200mg of catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before running the catalytic test, the catalyst was reduced at 300°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 atmosphere (99.999%, 20mlmin−1) and then it was cooled down to 80°C. The crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set before the reactor tube and maintained at 0°C to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1.06kPa), therefore, crotonaldehyde at constant partial pressure was carried over the catalyst by hydrogen flow (26mlmin−1). The gas line was kept at about 50°C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimazu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition and texture of Ir/SiO2 catalysts,"3.1 Composition and texture of Ir/SiO2 catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts. The diffraction peak of amorphous SiO2 is observed at 2θ =21.8°. For the fresh (unreduced) catalyst 3IrO2/SiO2, diffraction peaks at 2θ =28.0°, 34.7°, 40.1°, and 54.0° could be assigned to IrO2 (Fig. 4 ), and those assigned to metallic Ir are observed at 2θ =40.7°, 47.3°, 69.1°, and 83.4° for the reduced 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst. This indicates that Ir species in the fresh catalyst are mainly oxidized and those in the reduced sample are metallic. The mean crystallite sizes of Ir in the catalysts are 8.2, 8.9, 9.7 and 10.3nm for the 1Ir/SiO2, 2Ir/SiO2, 3Ir/SiO2 and 5Ir/SiO2, respectively, as calculated by the Scherrer equation. This indicates that the Ir particles grow up with increasing Ir loading in the catalyst. Fig. 2 shows representative HRTEM images of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts with different Ir loadings. It is found that the Ir particle sizes in the catalysts manifestly increase with increasing Ir loading. Ir particle sizes on the 1Ir/SiO2, 3Ir/SiO2 and 5Ir/SiO2 catalyst are 1.8, 3.2, 3.6nm, respectively. These results are generally in agreement with the values calculated by CO chemisorption, which are 2.1, 3.9 and 6.7nm for the 1Ir/SiO2, 3Ir/SiO2 and 5Ir/SiO2, respectively. However, large deviations are observed between the values and those determined by XRD, which is probably due to the fact that small Ir particles (especially for those less than 3nm) could not be detected by XRD technique. It is also likely that there are some large Ir particles but not observed by TEM."
7,Reduction properties of IrO2/SiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Reduction properties of IrO2/SiO2 catalysts Fig. 3 shows the H2-TPR profiles of IrO2/SiO2 catalysts. For the SiO2 support, no reduction peak is observed in the temperature range. For the IrO2/SiO2 catalyst, two reduction peaks centered at about 246°C (α) and 370°C (β) are observed. Table 1 lists the hydrogenation consumptions of α and β peaks calibrated by the known amount of CuO power. From Table 1, it can be seen that hydrogen consumption of the α peak increases significantly with increasing Ir loading, while that of the β peak hardly changes. The α peak could be assigned to the reduction of crystalline IrO2 species (large particles) and the β peak is attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed IrO2 species. Note that the β peak is present at the temperature higher than 300°C, it implies that the catalysts reduced at 300°C still might contain some oxidized Ir species (Irδ+), although the XRD results show that the main species after reduction are metallic Ir0. In addition, average valence state of Ir species in the unreduced catalyst could be calculated based on the H2-TPR profiles and the results are listed in Table 1. It is found that the initial valence states of Ir species in the IrO2/SiO2 catalysts are between 3.14 and 2.48, and it decreases with Ir loading in the catalyst. The fact that the valence state of Ir species is lower than the nominal oxidation state of Ir4+ suggests that the calcined catalyst contains partially reduced Ir species, and moreover, the content of such low valence state Ir species increases with Ir loading in the catalyst."
8,Surface acidity of Ir/SiO2 catalysts,"3.3 Surface acidity of Ir/SiO2 catalysts Fig. 5 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts, as well as the amount of surface acid sites. The SiO2 support has one weak NH3 desorption peak at around 210°C (α), probably due to the impurities in the support or the physisorbed NH3 [37]. For the Ir/SiO2 catalysts, in addition to the α peak, one desorption peak at 420°C (β) is detected, indicating the presence of the Lewis acid sites. As the SiO2 support is basically inert and the Ir precursor used in the synthesis does not contain any chlorine species, the Lewis acidity of the catalyst is most likely generated by the Irδ+ species. The amount of surface acid sites based on the peak area of β reaches a maximum (1.19mmolg−1) when the Ir loading is 3%. However, further increase of Ir loading results in a decline in surface acid sites. We have calculated the Ir surface areas in the catalyst and compared these values with the amounts of adsorbed NH3. It was found that the amount of surface Ir atoms are much less than that of the absorbed NH3. This implies that sites other than surface Ir atoms are involved in the NH3 adsorption, however, no evidence could be provided at present and further detailed investigation should be carried out to clarify this point."
9,In situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption on Ir/SiO2 catalysts,"3.4 In situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption on Ir/SiO2 catalysts Fig. 6 shows the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO chemisorption at 30°C on the Ir/SiO2 catalysts. The 1Ir/SiO2 catalyst shows a band at 2008cm−1, which could be assigned to gem dicarbonyl (GCO) species on Irδ+ sites due to the antisymmetric carbonyl vibration [38]. This suggests that the 1Ir/SiO2 catalyst contains mainly surface Irδ+ species. For the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst, two band at 2008 and 2036cm−1 are observed; the former could be assigned to GCO species on Irδ+ species and the latter could be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO species (LCO) on fully reduced Ir0 site [39], indicating that the surface of the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst contains a mixture of Irδ+ and Ir0 species and the content of surface Irδ+ is much more than that of the Ir0 sites as judging from the intensity of the band. Interestingly, the 5Ir/SiO2 catalyst shows a strong peak at 2036cm−1, together with a weak band at 2008cm−1. These results imply a lowered surface Irδ+/Ir0 ratio with increasing Ir loading in the catalyst. We have also calculated the normalized peak area of CO bands based on Ir surface area in the catalyst, the relative values are 1.0, 2.0, 5.1 respectively. Note that the XRD results show only metallic Ir species in the catalyst, the inconsistency is probably due to the fact that XRD technique detects mainly bulk information of the sample and is insensitive to the surface layer. However, these results are in good agreement with the NH3-TPD results, as the NH3-TPD results clearly demonstrate the presence of Irδ+ species for the Lewis acid sites, and moreover, the highest amount of surface Lewis acid sites on the 3Ir/SiO2 is accordance to the fact the 3Ir/SiO2 contains the highest amount of surface Irδ+ species."
10,Ir/SiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.5 Ir/SiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 7 shows the crotonaldehyde conversion and selectivity to hydrogenation products as a function of time on stream over the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst. The main products are crotyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of carbonyl CO bond), butanal (formed by hydrogenation of the CC bond), butanol (formed by hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds), and others mainly are C8 compounds (2,4,6-octatrienal) formed by polymerization and C3 compounds (propane and propene) formed by decarbonylation [4,32]. It is found that the catalyst is quite inactive at the initial stage, with a crotonaldehyde conversion of 8.2%. Also, the increase of the selectivity to crotyl alcohol is accompanied by the loss of the selectivity to butanal. It is therefore likely that these two reactions are competitive on the catalyst surface. According to the published literatures, catalyst deactivation is often seen in this reaction [40]. Unexpectedly, the conversion of the catalyst gradually increases with time on stream and reaches a quasi-steady state after 500min, which is uncommonly observed for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. As for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, it increases rapidly during the first 160min reaction and then still increases gradually, at the expense of the selectivity to butanal. In addition, other Ir/SiO2 catalysts prepared also show similar behaviors. Therefore, the Ir/SiO2 catalyst undergoes an induction period for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyede. The origin of the induction period remains unknown at present. One possibility is that it is a result of the competitive adsorption of crotonaldehyde and hydrogen molecules. As the catalyst was reduced in hydrogen flow before reaction, the surface of Ir species is likely covered by hydrogen adatoms. When the crotonaldehyde molecules were introduced to the catalyst, they may gradually occupy the surface Ir sites and replace the hydrogen adatoms, which could lead to an increased coverage of crotonaldehyde on the surface and consequently an enhancement of the conversion. Table 2 summarizes the catalytic performances of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts with different Ir loadings. As can be seen in Table 2, with increasing Ir loading, the dispersion of Ir in the catalyst gradually decreases and consequently the particle size of Ir increases. Also, conversion of crotonaldehyde increases with Ir loading in the catalyst, as well as the selectivity to butanol. However, the selectivities to crotyl alcohol and butanal first increase and then decrease, reach a highest value (77.6%) over the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst. Compared to the catalysts with H2IrCl6 as the precursor, the usage of Ir(acac)3 is beneficial for the stability of the supported Ir catalysts during the reaction. Meanwhile, the employment of Cl-free Ir(acac)3 could also exclude the influence of Cl on the surface acidity of the catalysts. Concerning the activity, it is found that the activity of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts increase with increasing Ir loadings, and when the Ir loading is 5%, the conversion of Ir/SiO2 catalyst reaches 15.7%. From the DRIFTS results (Fig. 6), it is found that the low Ir-loading sample such as the 1Ir/SiO2 contains predominantly surface Irδ+ species, while the high Ir-loading samples such as the 3Ir/SiO2 and 5Ir/SiO2 contain a mixture of surface Ir0 and Irδ+. In our previous work 35, we have studied in detail the Irδ+/Ir0 ratio of Ir/TiO2 catalyst and concluded that a proper Irδ+/Ir0 may be suitable for the chemisorption and activation of the crotonaldehyde molecule, and thus leading to a high activity. Also, Riguetto et al. [29] demonstrated that the electronic properties of the active metal exerted important impacts on the selectivity and concluded that the surface electron density of the active metal particles was crucial to improving the adsorption and reactivity of the CO bond. The enhanced activity obtained on the high Ir-loading samples could also be explained according to the adsorption model of crotonaldehyde on the catalyst surface. According to the literature [36], the carbonyl oxygen is suggested to interact with Lewis acid sites (in the present case are Irδ+ cations) and the Ir0 or partially reduced Irδ+ is the adsorption center of CC band and carbonyl carbon. Thus, high amount of surface Lewis acid sites may provide more sites for the adsorption of carbonyl oxygen, which is certainly beneficial to the activity. As the Ir loading is 5%, although the surface acid sites become slightly less compared to that of the 3% (less adsorption sites for carbonyl oxygen), the Ir particles grow from 3.9 to 6.7nm, so that CC bond and the carbonyl carbon could be easily chemisorbed on Ir0 sites (as the DRIFTS results show predominantly Ir0 on the surface), and thus leads to a high reactivity. As for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, it is found that it first increases and then decreases with increasing Ir loadings. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol on the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst is 77.6%, which is higher than those reported in literature [22]. Reyes et al. reported that a Ir/SiO2 catalyst (0.5wt.%) with Ir(acac)3 as the precursor showed a crotonaldehyde conversion of 13%, and a selectivity to crotyl alcohol of 31% [41]. In the case of Ir/SiO2 catalysts, the Ir particles grow up with increasing loadings (Table 2), but it is found that the selectivity to crotyl alcohol reaches a maximum, implying factors that influence the selectivity other than Ir particle size [5,36]. It is well known that the surface Lewis acidity plays an important role in the selectivity because these acid sites provide centers for carbonyl oxygen chemisorption, which is crucial for the formation of the desirable crotyl alcohol. According to the adsorption model of crotonaldehyde reported in literature [42–44], the carbonyl oxygen is suggested to interact with Lewis acid sites and the metallic Ir0 particles are the adsorption centers of CC and carbonyl carbon. However, too many Lewis acid sites may not beneficial for the selectivity because it could also result in a strong interaction between CC bond and the Ir0 sites. Wang et al. reported that high acidity can result in high coking and easy deactivation for the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [42]. In the present work, it is found that the surface acidity of Ir/SiO2 catalysts first increase and then decrease, which maybe the reason of the selectivity of 5Ir/SiO2 catalyst lower than the 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst. To further check the surface species on the used 3Ir/SiO2 catalysts, we performed TPO examinations on the used catalyst under O2 and He atmospheres, as shown in Fig. 8 . When exposed in He, the used 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst shows one H2O desorption peak around 100°C, which can be attributed to the desorption of physisorbed water on the catalyst surface. When the catalyst is examined under O2 atmosphere, a very wide desorption peak of H2O is detected, ranging from 100 to 400°C. Moreover, the desorption of H2O is accompanied by the desorption of CO2, which are centered at 120, 200, 220 and 420°C. These results clearly demonstrate that the surface species on the used 3Ir/SiO2 catalyst are organic compounds. The formation of surface organic compounds is generally recognized as the main reason for catalyst deactivation [45]. However, it seems that such deposition of organic compounds on the surface hardly influence the activity of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts in the current work. This is probably due to either the fact that the surface acidity of these Ir/SiO2 catalysts are very weak because of the usage of Ir(acac)3 precursor, and thus coverage of organics on the catalyst is less than a monolayer."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the effect of Ir loading on the reactivities and selectivities of the Ir/SiO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was studied. When Ir loading was 3%, the Ir/SiO2 catalyst showed better performance (with a conversion of 15.6%) and selectivity to crotyl alcohol (77.6%). More importantly, the catalysts did not undergo deactivation during the reaction and finally became stable. It was concluded that both activity and selectivity mainly depended on Ir particle size and the surface Lewis acid in the catalysts, meanwhile, Irδ+and Ir0 species on the catalysts also played an important role in the catalyst."
