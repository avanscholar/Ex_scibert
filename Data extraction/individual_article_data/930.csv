0,Introduction,"Researchers in both the industrial sector and the scholarly community are presently facing the problem of enhancing productive developments that extensively make use of biomass or biomass-derived chemicals [1–4]. Intermediates like furfural, furfuryl alcohol (FA), gamma valerolactone (GVL), and attractive biofuels, such as 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), form the basis of the platform molecules that signify, to a large extent, the studies being carried out at present [1,5–8]. Furan derivatives have a strong chemistry with carbohydrates, which form the most important source of these platform molecules, hence they are considered to be very important intermediates. Recently, studies have been carried out to modify the carbohydrates into furan derivatives in the form of furfural and FA [9–12]. To obtain fuel from a renewable feedstock resource, pre-treatment is carried out by performing hydrolysis of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic components to produce sugar alcohols, such as xylitol, sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol or maltitol [13–18], which are subsequently modified into fuel components by means of chemical reactions [19–22]. FA is a critical bio-derivative that is obtained from cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis. This compound has several uses in the chemical industry [23–30]. Some studies have been carried out into converting FA into distinct fuel derivatives, such as 1,5-pentanediols [31], tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol(THFA) [32] and methyl furan [4]. These derivatives are very important because of their uses; however, synthesising them under green conditions is quite challenging. The hydrogenation of FA and furfural can be carried out to create 2-methlyfuran, which is essentially used for producing crysanthemate pesticides, perfume intermediates and chloroquine lateral chains in the field of medicine [33,34]. The reaction conditions are strong in alcohol in all of the early studies conducted with FA hydrogenation. Hydrogenolysis of FA was first studied by Adkins et al. [31] in 1931 using a copper chromite catalyst. The reaction was carried out in the liquid phase for 11.5 h at a temperature of 100 °C and 100–150 bar pressure hydrogen. Adkins et al found that in these conditions, an output of 70% to pentanediol was achieved. A procedure for developing 2-MF using chromium-based catalysts was patented by corporations [35]. Toxicity is an issue faced when using chromium catalysts as it leads to serious environmental pollution [23]. A procedure for converting FA to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol using a nickel-based catalyst was patented by Dunlop and Schegulla [32], and it has been found that nickel catalysts are selective in the production of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol from FA, requiring very stringent reaction conditions (180 °C, and 3.5 h) [27,35,36]. Hydrogenation of FA using Ni:Fe/SiO2 catalyst at 250 °C, 1 bar, and with high selectivity to 2-MF and furan has been presented by Sitthisa et al. [4]; they found that when there was an increase in the loading of nickel, the selectivity to 2-MF increased. The successful synthesis of 2-MF and GBL from furfural using copper-based catalysts at a temperature of 240 °C was presented by Zhu et al. [37]. In addition, for various hydrocarbons, ruthenium metal has been found to be an active hydrogenation catalyst. The catalytic function of Pt, Pd and Ru supported MnOx has been presented by Zhang et al. [27] for the hydrogenation of FA at a temperature of 120 °C, pressure of 30–60 bar, and for a duration of 4 h in an aqueous phase. When Pd/MnOx and Rh/MnOx catalysts were used, a high selectivity of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was attained. It was found that the Ru/MnOx catalyst was more selective towards 1,2-pentanediol when these reactive conditions were present. It has been found that Pd, Rh and Pt supported catalysts are less active in contrast to nickel, even under conditions of higher temperatures and pressure [36,37]. In addition, Zhang et al. [33] found that the output of 2-MF from furfural at 212 °C is 85% when copper-based catalysts are used. This shows that it is difficult to fulfil a process for the selective production of 2-MF under green conditions, since it is likely that several by-products may be created. This study presents the application of a Pd-backed catalyst that was prepared using the wet impregnation technique in selective biomass hydrogenation, and the catalytic performance of Pd catalysts when there are differing reaction conditions, for example differences in temperature, solvent and the proportion of catalysts required for the hydrogenation of FA at room temperature. It is implied by the distinct catalytic activity and preferable selectivity to hydrogenated de-oxygenation of CO, and not a reduction in CC, that there is a new reaction pathway (Scheme 1 ) [8,38,45]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sigma Aldrich provided the materials needed, that is, furfuryl alcohol (98%), 2-Methylfuran (98%), 1, 2-dichloroethane (98%), HAuCl4·3H2O with a gold concentration of 8.9 mg/ml and all the intermediates, which were then used as received. Johnson Matthey was the vendor of palladium chloride. Sigma Aldrich was also the vendor of magnesium oxide, activated carbon (Darco, G60), cerium (IV) oxide nanopowder (<25 micron, 99.9%) and silicon dioxide nanopowder (10–20 micron). Finally, pure hydrogen (99.9%) was acquired from BOC."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A wet impregnation technique that utilised aqueous solutions of PdCl2 (Johnson Matthey), and HAuCl4·3H2O (Sigma Aldrich Sigma Aldrich Sigma Aldrich), was used to prepare the catalysts supported on different supports. The preparation process involved the following steps. The dissolution of PdCl2 in water was followed by stirring, heating and including it in an aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O. The solution was included in the support, and the paste prepared was dried in an oven at 110 °C for 16 h. There was calcination of the powder in static air at 400 °C for 3 h at a ramp rate of 20 °C/min."
4,Characterisation,"2.3 Characterisation 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD data for the catalysts using different supports were gathered using powder XRD and a PANalytical X’Pert Pro with a CuKα X-ray source operating at 40 kV and 40 mA and fixed with an X’Celerator detector. Every catalyst was analysed from 2θ = 10 to 80 for 30 min. The catalysts were converted into a fine powder form and added to a silicon wafer. The outcomes were compared with the information present in the ICDD library for every catalyst. 2.3.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a Jeol 2100 microscope that was working at 200 kV attached with an Oxford Instruments EDX analyser. The preparation for the catalyst involved dispersion in methanol and being dropped over a holey carbon film with 300 mesh copper grids. Image J software was used to determine the particle size distribution (PSD) by counting 150 particles. 2.3.3 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained from TEM-1011 model instrument operating at 40–100 kV. 2.3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Samples were characterised using a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD photoelectron spectrometer, using monochromatic Al Kα radiation, at 144 W (12 mA × 12 kV) power. High resolution and survey scans were performed at pass energies of 40 and 160 eV respectively. Spectra were calibrated to the C (1 s) signal for adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV and quantified using CasaXPS v2.3.17, using the sensitivity factors supplied by the manufacturer. 2.3.5 Surface area measurements The BET technique is a form of analysis used for the determination of the surface area of materials and the characterisation of catalysts, because it is often the case that the more active the catalyst, the greater the surface area will be. With this technique, the surface area of a material is based on the volume of the surface, which adsorbs gas at a certain temperature and pressure. In general, the BET is used for N2 adsorption and its concept depends on the BET equation. The sample was used for the BET analysis by degassing at 110 °C, and after that, linking to a Micromeritics Gemini 2360 Analyser automatic several point surface area analyser. During the analysis, the sample was left inside liquid N2 [39,40]."
5,Catalytic performance,"2.4 Catalytic performance The reactions took place in an autoclave using catalyst (0.1 g), dichloroethane (20 ml) and furfuryl alcohol (1 g). The autoclave was mixed at 1000 rpm, while H2 was provided with a pressure of 1 bar at room temperature for the duration of 180 min. GC (Varian 3800) installed with CP wax column) was used to assess the reaction mixture. Original samples were used to determine the products. An external calibration technique was employed to determine the quantities of reactant used up, and products created. 1-Propanol was the external standard used."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characteristics of SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2,"3.1 Characteristics of SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 The XRD diffractogram in Fig. 1 depicts broad peaks at 2-theta angle of 12.15°, 22.45°, and these reflection peaks are characteristic of SiO2. These broad peaks resulted from amorphous nature of silica. After deposition of Au:Pd bimetallic nanoparticles the hump disappeared owing to the strong interaction of the metallic nanoparticles and SiO2 support or encapsulation of the metal nanoparticles inside the pores. Also, the interaction between metals and SiO2 may alert the interatomic distance in SiO2 matrix, suggesting the SiO2 matrix does not have the same random ordered network. Additionally, the peaks at 38.39°, 44.58°, 64.82°, 77.87°, and 82.44° are reflection peaks associated with Au:Pd alloy and Au, as reported by Suo group [41] and Giannakakis et al. [42] respectively. In these supported catalysts, the particle size of the metal nanoparticles is a critical factor that can have an impact on conversion and selectivity. Scanning electron microscope has been exploited in order to give insight into the morphology of the fabricated materials. SEM images for pure and 5%Au:Pd/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . As depicted in Fig. 2, all fabricated materials were porous with homogeneous morphology. The scanning electron micrographs shown in Fig. 2A depict a cloudy-like structure for the SiO2 support, while the 5%Au:Pd/SiO2 micrographs Fig. 2B a more crystalline structure with white dense patches of sizes between 2 and 0.4 µ were observed. The presence of a cloudy structure indicates the amorphous nature of the SiO2 support, while after deposition with 5%Au:Pd/SiO2 and calcination, it agglomerated into a more crystalline structure. The existence of white dense patches could be attributed to Au:Pd clusters, which characterise most impregnation catalysts. These findings confirmed with the SEM study on AuPd/SiO2 previously reported [43]. To give more insights into the SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 nanostructures, TEM measurements were also performed as displayed in Fig. 3 . TEM image of pure SiO2 indicates well distributed spherical nanoparticles with average diameters ranging from 19 to 28 nm as displayed in Fig. 3A. Furthermore, the silica had their original morphology after Au:Pd deposition with no evidence of a change in the textural of the SiO2 nanostructure (Fig. 3B). The diameter of the well distributed Au:Pd nanoparticles within the matrix of SiO2 is in the range of 4–5 nm. In this case, extensive information regarding the smaller particles seen in the localised TEM images was sought, taking into account the fact that smaller particles may have greater activity for the catalytic results [41–43]. The BET surface area, pore width and pore volume of the fabricated materials are presented in Table 1 . The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the fabricated materials are displayed in Fig. 4 . The SiO2 isotherm as depicted in Fig. 4A can be ascribed to Type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification. This behaviour indicates the presence of mesopores, whereas H3 indicates the presence of slit-like pores. Their surface area and pore volume were 269.85 m2/g and 0.09 cm2/g, and 251.29 m2/g, and 0.08 cm2/g for SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 respectively. The deposition of Au:Pd onto SiO2 resulted in agglomeration and crystallisation of both the active phase and support, which explains the decrease in surface area to 251.29 m2/g with no significant change in the pore volume of the catalyst. The decrease in the surface area of the catalyst is in agreement with the SEM micrographs. The pore size distribution curves based on BJH model of SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 nanostructures are shown in Fig. 4B."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Effect of the support Analyses of gold and palladium metal supported by different supports have been carried out, and it has been found that there is a difference in the activity of catalysts in terms of selectivity and conversion. Table 2 presents the product selectivity. The reactions were carried out at room temperature, and hydrogen pressure was kept at 1 bar. No conversion was demonstrated by the reaction with pure supports and blank reaction when these conditions were used. 3.2.2 Effect of gold and palladium loading Studies have been carried out on the various loadings of Au:Pd metal supported on silicon dioxide nanopowder, and it has been noted that the activity of catalysts shows variations in terms of conversion and selectivity. Table 3 presents the findings. It can be seen that when the loading of Pd metal increases from 1% to 2.5%, there is a small increase in the activity of the catalyst and its selectivity to 2-MF. Furthermore, when mono gold was used, weak effectiveness was noted. The catalysts that showed the highest in activity and selectivity to 2-MF was observed to be 5%Au:Pd. This may be attributed to increases in the number of Au and Pd metallic nanoparticles Au:Pd species on the surface. The reactions were carried out at room temperature, and the hydrogen pressure was 1 bar. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was the side product. No conversion was demonstrated by the blank reaction or the reaction with pure SiO2 under these conditions. The catalytic activity was significantly influenced by the surface species owing to most of the reactions take place on the material surface. Consequently, the surface chemical state was performed by XPS spectroscopy as depicted in Fig. 5 . The binding energies for SiO2 supported and Au:Pd/SiO2 catalysts as shown in Fig. 5. The XPS bands were tested for pure SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 over O 1s and Si 2p binding energy values. It is worth noting that, the XPS survey (Fig. 5a and b) confirmed the existence of silicon and oxygen in the catalysts. XPS survey (Fig. 5a and b) confirmed the existence of silicon and oxygen in the catalysts. Fig. 5d displays the Si 2p of SiO2 and Au:Pd/SiO2 which exhibit a peak at ∼98 and 98.5 eV respectively suggesting the presence Si0 (Si). The absence of any broad peaks at 102–103 eV confirms the absence of any combination of Si3+ (Si2O3) and Si4+(SiO2) [44]. However, the variation of 0.5 eV for the supported Au:Pd had no effect on the oxidation state of the silica support. Moreover, the O 1S binding energies at about 541.6 eV and 542.7 eV were assigned to the oxygen of Si-O. This effect of Au was reported by Naumkin et al to reduce the surface potential and differential surface charging of the support. This indicates that the Au:Pd resulted in the formation of alloy on the surface, with no chemical interaction with the SiO2 support [44]. 3.2.3 Effect of the catalyst amount Fig. 6 depicts the effect of amount of catalyst Au:Pd/SiO2 on the conversion and selectivity of FA to 2-MF, THFA and other products. At a catalyst amount of 100 mg and a conversion rate of 4%, the selectivity to 2-MF reached 28%. The selectivity increased progressively with 25 mg and 50 mg catalysts, amounting to 66% and 77% for 2-MF respectively, with the highest selectivity of 92% recorded for 100 mg of catalyst at a conversion rate of 36%. In addition, an increase in the catalyst amount and conversion resulted in a decline in the selectivity of THFA and other products. The increases in the activity of the catalyst and high selectivity to 2-MF could be attributed to the increase in the number of proper and active sites, which is responsible for channelling the selectivity to 2-MF. Similarly, activity and selectivity were reported for 2-MF synthesis over Pd/TiO2 [45]. 3.2.4 Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism can be illustrated as in Scheme 2 . Hydrogen is dissociated over the surface of metal sites (palladium and gold sites), meaning that the H-H bond in H2 cleaves to form a metal-H bond. The atomic hydrogen attached to the metal surface transfers the alcohol group in the furfuryl alcohol compound, forming –CH2O+H2. Due to the physical arrangement, a water molecule leaves the compound, forming 2-methylfuran. In addition to this way, there is another hypothesis mechanism (Meerwein Ponndorf Verley mechanism) [46,47], in which Lewis acid site plays an important role. Due to the presence of metal and metal oxide (MOx) on the surface of the silica support, hydrogenolysis can occur through two-ways (direct route or activation of the furan ring). In the direct route, cleavage of the alcoholic group (–C–OH) was followed by adding proton via the addition of an H-atom which adsorbed on catalyst metallic site, leading to the formation of 2-methylfuran. However, in the ring activated route, the dissociated proton on the metallic site added to C3, causing loss of aromaticity of furan ring. The delocalisation of π-electron between C3 and C2 to C2 and C1 facilitates the cleavage of the alcoholic group to form the unstable intermediate compound. The H+ on the C3 is abstracted by the catalyst to form a double bond between C3 and C2 to obtain 2-methylfuran compound. Moreover, there is possibility of synthesis of THFA, utilising a broken double bonding in the ring as shown in Scheme 1."
9,Conclusions,"It has been shown in this study that FA can be selectively transformed into 2-MF at room temperature, with hydrogen pressure quite low, with Au:Pd supported catalysts. Very active Au:Pd catalysts that had a large number of very small particles were developed in this study using a very simple impregnation technique. When these catalysts were used, only hydrogenated de-oxygenation took place, and there was a limited reduction in CC under these conditions; while tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol <6% was the only by-product that was identified. This process is applicable, to a large extent, to chemical environments that can stabilise intermediates and enhance selectivity. This work shows that in comparison with the studies reported on Ru and Ni catalysts, the easy method of preparation and the higher catalytic activity of the Pd, implies that this field has a lot of potential, and the selective production of 2-MF is an interesting approach. The trend of converting biomass to different C5 oxygenates is consistently increasing, and this may offer a renewable method for the chemical industry. A process that offers the possibility of producing 2-MF, a critical petroleum derivative, in reaction conditions that decrease energy consumption with respect to heating and hydrogen, and which make use of a simple catalyst development technique, has been presented in this study."
