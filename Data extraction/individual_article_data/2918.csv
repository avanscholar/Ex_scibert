0,Introduction,"Diminishing non-renewable energy resources and environmental problems caused by overuse of fossil fuels increased the significance to find renewable and sustainable energy sources, and biomass energy is one of this kind of new renewable energy [1]. Biomass is the sole renewable carbon resource and it can be transformed into normal fuel products as well as other chemical products [2]. CO2 from use of the chemicals or products can be absorbed by plants via photosynthesis, creating a carbon cycle without emission [3]. The most biomass on earth is lignocellulosic, which is manly constituted by cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose is the highest proportion of lignocellulose, and it can replace fossil fuel to be a renewable energy source for high-value chemicals and fuel [4,5]. Pyrolysis is a simple but effective way to convert organic solid waste into high-value chemicals, oil, char and gases [6,7]. However, the unrefined bio-oil cannot be directly applied for combustion because of high oxygen content, low carbon and hydrogen content, acidic pH, high instability and low heating values [8,9]. Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors for high-value chemicals and hydrocarbons is a feasible method [10]. Alkanes, especially long chain alkanes (LCAs), are important to the modern industry. LCAs are the major component in diesel or jet fuel and can also be used for preparing olefins and aromatics. Alkanes from renewable cellulose instead of fossil resources can realize sustainable energy supply [11]. Bio-derived fatty acids were typically used as raw material to produce alkanes, and the high yield and selectivity of alkanes can be obtained via hydrodeoxygenation [12]. However, harsh conditions such as high pressure (pressure ≥2 MPa) and high H2 consumption with more than 3 M ratio of H2 per reactant were essential [13]. Therefore, finding a method to convert biomass to alkanes with low H2 pressure and consumption is a research hotspot. In catalytic reaction over Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1), Ti–OH and Si–OH sites both have strong ability of adsorption oxygen functional groups, which shows TS-1 has the potential of deoxidization capability. The adsorption on Si–OH sites is completely reversible, but the adsorption on Ti–OH sites always irreversible and the irreversible adsorption may lead to carbon deposition on the catalysts [14,15]. The catalytic activity and stability of the TS-1 modified with Au metal could be enhanced because the deposited Au nanoparticles increase active titanium sites [16]. Besides, the Au catalysts on acid supports can activate the O–H bond in various alcohols to produce hydrogen [17]. When particle size less than 10 nm, gold catalysts have high capacity for hydrogen chemisorption, and Au catalysts have been applied to hydrodeoxygenation [18]. In the light of the specific properties of gold catalysts, the application of Au/TS-1 for the catalytic pyrolysis cellulose to produce hydrogen is possible. Besides, the cellulose pyrolysis can directly produce hydrogen, methane and other hydrogen source, so Au/TS-1 catalysts can use these hydrogen source produced by the reaction system for hydrodeoxygenation to produce LCAs. In our previous study, we found that Au/TS-1 shows high catalytic activity to produce LCAs from vapors of cellulose pyrolysis [19]. However, the effect of some process conditions such as the amount of Au loading and catalytic temperature had not been discussed clearly. The experiment only included qualitative analysis but not quantitative analysis. The possible mechanism had not been understood for the formation of LCAs and aromatic compounds. In this study, a series of Au/TS-1 catalysts were synthesized and characterized. The effect of Au loading, mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose and pyrolysis and catalytic temperature on the production of LCAs was investigated. This study analyzed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the products and the selectivity of LCAs. Glucose is the monomer of the cellulose, anhydroglucose is the main products from cellulose pyrolysis, and cellobiose is the basic structure of cellulose. Therefore, they were selected as model compounds to further reveal the mechanism of the reaction. To understand the contribution of functional, methanol and an ethanal were also used as model compounds with representative functional groups (hydroxy and aldehyde groups) were used. Finally, possible mechanism to produce LCAs via catalytic pyrolysis vapors of cellulose was proposed."
1,Experiment,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of TS-1: Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) was synthesized by hydrothermal method. tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), titanium (IV) butoxide (TBOT), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and H2O were mixed with a molar ratio of 1: 0.025: 0.4: 40 and it was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h, and then the solution was warmed up to 80 °C for 4 h. Finally, the gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized at 150 °C for 72 h to produce TS-1. The TS-1 solid was obtained by centrifugal separation from the gel and washed with large water and ethanol. Then the obtained TS-1 was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 450 °C for 8 h in a muffle furnace to eliminate the template. Synthesis of Au/TS-1: Au/TS-1 catalyst was prepared via the impregnation method. Typically, 1.0 g HAuCl4·3H2O was dissolved completely in the 20.0 mL deionized water, then the solution was transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and diluted with deionized water to volume. By changing the volume of solution, the amount of Au metal loading is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 wt%, respectively. After the mixture was stirred for 30 min, the prepared samples were reduced by a quantity of sodium borohydride solution. Finally, catalysts were obtained after washing and drying for 24 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Micromeritics ASAP 2020 plus was used to measure the textural properties of catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV and Bragg's angle was between 10° and 90°. JEM-2010FEF electron microscope was used for observing the size of the gold particles by taking transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The acidity of the catalyst was characterized by NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) on an Autosorb-IQ-C. After pretreatment, the catalysts samples were then heated to 800 °C at a temperature rate of 10 °C/min and a thermal conductivity detector was used to record signal. Pyridine Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Py-FTIR) was conducted by Nicolet380. The surface electronic states of catalysts were analyzed by a photoelectron spectrometer to collect X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and the C 1s peak (BE = 284.8 eV) was used for calibration and the instrument model is Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalade 250Xi. To test the carbon deposited on used catalysts, a Netsch STA449F5 thermal was used for temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Typically, about 10 mg of sample was heated from 100 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min with a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen and the ratio was 1:1."
4,Pyrolysis experiments,"2.3 Pyrolysis experiments A Py-GC/MS (Rx-3050TR reactor pyrolyzer, Agilent, GC8890, MS5977B) was used for pyrolysis experiment. Fig. 1 shows the diagram of Py-GC/MS. The reactor divided into two parts: the 1st reactor was used for pyrolysis and the 2nd reactor was used for catalytic experiment. The pyrolysis time was 0.5 min and the mass of cellulose was 1.0 mg for each experiment. The effect of content of Au loading, mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose, pyrolysis and catalytic temperature on the production of LCAs were studied. The content of Au loading is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 wt%, and the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose is from 10 to 50 with the gradient of 10. The temperature of 1st and 2nd reactor is in the temperature range of 350 °C–750 °C and 300 °C–700 °C, respectively. Each experiment was repeated at least three times to ensure repeatability of the results."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The products from cellulose pyrolysis were separated by a Rtx-5 MS chromatographic column with 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm. The initial temperature of the column was at 50 °C for 2 min, then it increased to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and finally held at 260 °C for 2 min. The selectivity of LCAs was calculated with peak area normalization and the yield of LCAs was obtained by the external standard calibration method by using heptadecane as external standard. The formula for calculation of the selectivity and yield of LCAs (LCAs were defined as alkanes whose carbon number is more than 10) are shown in the following: (1) Selectivity of LCAs ( S LCAs ) = Peak areas of LCAs Total peak areas × 100 % (2) Yield of LCAs ( Y LCAs ) = Mass of YLCAs Mass of cellulose × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results The results of XRD patterns are exhibited in Fig. 2 . All the TS-1 catalysts exhibit the characteristic MFI diffraction peaks at 14.6°, 22.9°, 23.1°, 23.7°, and 24.2°, corresponding to the indices of the [200], [002], [310], [221], and [102] crystal planes [20]. With loading of gold, the decrease of peak intensity is due to the reduction of crystallinity. The diffraction peaks of TiO2 phase do not appear, suggesting that Ti species are not in the form of bulk oxides or it is highly dispersed and incorporated into the MFI framework [21,22]. Furthermore, Au loading hardly changed the crystal structure of TS-1 and no obvious diffraction peaks associated with Au were observed over 0.5% Au/TS-1 due to the low loading amount and highly dispersion of Au [23]. With the increase of Au loading, peak at 38.1° assigned to [111] crystal plane of Au can be observed in other Au/TS-1 catalysts [24]. Fig. 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution. According to the IUPAC classification, the five curves all exhibit type IV isotherms with the sharp transition in the adsorption branch at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.02). No adsorption at intermediate pressures (0.1<P/P0 < 0.4) indicates the presence of micropores and H4 hysteresis loop suggests the presence of mesopores [25,26]. The isotherms of all the five samples are the same, which suggests that loading of gold has not changed the textural properties of pure TS-1 significantly. Fig. 3(b) shows that the pore width is mainly centered at 3.5 nm-4.5 nm. Compared with TS-1, the Au/TS-1 shows the uniform pore size distribution. The relevant textural properties including specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size are listed in Table 1 . The specific surface area decreases with the increase of content of Au loading owing to blockage of partial pores by Au loading. For example, the specific surface area of TS-1 and 2% Au/TS-1 is 394 m2/g and 308 m2/g, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the pore volume and average pore size decreases first and then increases, and the largest pore volume and average pore size is 0.28 cm3/g and 3.2 nm over 0.5%Au/TS-1 and 1.5%Au/TS-1, respectively. XPS is used to identify the valence state of the elements, and XPS spectra of Ti 2p, O 1s and Au 4f spectra for the TS-1 and 1% Au/TS-1 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . The XPS survey spectrum of TS-1 and Au/TS-1 both contain Ti, C, Si, and O, and no obvious peaks associated with Au was observed in the curve of 1.0% Au/TS-1 due to the low loading amount. In the curves of Ti 2p, the peak almost no shifted but the peak area decreased due to the decrease of bond strength of Ti–O by loading of Au [27]. As shown in the Fig. 4(c), two peaks at the binding energy of 83.6 eV and 87.6eV were assigned to metallic gold, suggesting that the Au3+ was completely reduced [28]. Fig. 5 shows TEM images of the Au/TS-1 with different content of Au loading and the scale bar of was 20 nm. The image shows the uniform dispersion of Au over 0.5%Au/TS-1, and the increase of Au loading leads to the agglomeration of Au particles. The increase of Au particle size will decrease the catalytic activity of Au/TS-1 [29]. Fig. 5 shows that the average gold particle increases with the increase of Au loading content. The average gold particle over 0.5% Au/TS-1, 1.0% Au/TS-1, 1.5% Au/TS-1, and 2.0% Au/TS-1 is 7.4 nm, 7.5 nm, 9.6 nm, and 9.9 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), two peaks at the NH3-TPD curves of TS-1 and Au/TS-1 in the temperature range of 100–120 °C and 350–400 °C are associated with the weak and medium-strong acid sites, respectively. The curves of Au/TS-show extra desorption peaks centered at approximately 650 °C, which is associated with strong acid [30]. The acidic properties of Au/TS-1 are dominated by weak and medium-strong acid sites, and the properties will decrease the catalytic cracking of LCAs [31]. The results indicate that the distribution of Au species can promote the adsorption of NH3 on the surfaces of catalysts [27]. The peak area of catalysts increased after impregnating in the solution of chloroauric acid and some of the acid sites on TS-1 were consumed by loading of Au metal [32,33]. Under the synergy of these two effects, the acidity of 1.0% Au/TS-1 catalyst is the strongest among five samples. The acid amount of five samples is shown in Table 2 . Au nanoparticles can activate the O–H bond in various alcohols to produce H2 and acidic properties of the support play a vital role in the activity of catalysts. More acidity leads to the higher activity [34,35]. During catalytic pyrolysis experiments, the acid sites of the solid acid catalysts play a crucial role. As a result, 1.0% Au/TS-1 should show better catalytic efficiency than others [36]. Fig. 7 shows the Py-FTIR results of catalysts. As shown in the curves, the Py-FTIR adsorption bands at 1450 cm−1 and 1550 cm−1 are Lewis (L) and Brønsted (B) acid sites, respectively [37]. In addition, the acidic properties of catalysts show no much change with the increase of Au loading. L acid sites are dominant and L acid sites are beneficial to decrease the catalytic cracking of products, which will help the formation of LCAs [38]."
8,Catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose pyrolysis vapors,"3.2 Catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose pyrolysis vapors The pyrolysis of cellulose was first investigated at the pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C, and the detailed compounds are shown in Table 3 . The sugars are the main compounds. The main compounds in sugars are anhydroglucose, disaccharide, and glucose, accounting for the peak area of 96.3%. The other compounds such as furans, alcohols and acids are also detected, however, no alkanes can be detected from cellulose directly pyrolysis and the carbon number of main compounds was concentrated around 6. The main oxygen-containing functional groups are hydroxyl and aldehyde. 3.2.1 Effect of Au loading content Different content of Au loading on the catalytic performance was investigated. For each experiment, the pyrolysis and catalytic temperature are 350 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The mass ratio of catalyst and cellulose is 50 and the content of Au loading is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 wt%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 , the selectivity and yield of LCAs over TS-1 are 5.8% and 3.6 wt%, respectively. The selectivity and yield increase first and then decrease as Au loading increases from 0.5 wt% to 2.0 wt%. The highest selectivity and yield of LCAs are 78.0% and 9.6 wt% over 1.0% Au/TS-1. This reveals that moderate Au loading could promote the generation of LCAs. However, serious aggregation of Au particles can be found with the excess Au loading, which leads to the decrease of catalytic activity [39]. 1.0% Au/TS-1 has small particle size, highly dispersion of Au, and the strongest acid. The acid sites of the catalysts play a key role in conversion vapors into alkanes. The selectivity and yield of LCAs is consistent with acid strength of Au/TS-1 catalysts (Table 2). 3.2.2 Effect of mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose The effect of mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose on the change of selectivity and yield of LCAs was investigated. The pyrolysis and catalytic temperature are 350 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The mass of cellulose was 1.0 mg 1.0% Au/TS-1 is used as catalyst and the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose is from 10 to 50 with the gradient of 10. Fig. 9 shows that the selectivity and yield of LCAs increase with the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose. The highest selectivity and yield of LCAs are 82.3% and 11.0 wt%, respectively, with mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose of 50. The selectivity and yield increase rapidly when the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose increases from 10 to 40. When the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose increases from 40 to 50, the increase of selectivity and yield is not obvious. The results suggest that the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose influences the distribution of products obviously. 3.2.3 Effect of pyrolysis temperature The effect of pyrolysis temperature on selectivity and yield of LCAs was investigated by using 1.0% Au/TS-1 as catalyst. The catalytic temperature is 500 °C, and mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose is 50. Fig. 10 shows that selectivity and yield first increase and then decrease with the increase of temperature. The highest selectivity and yield of LCAs are 89.2% and 14.4 wt% at pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. When the pyrolysis temperature increases from 350 °C to 450 °C, higher pyrolysis temperature promoted the decomposition of cellulose to form more volatiles, which could be further converted into alkanes over the catalyst. However, the further increase of pyrolysis temperature excessive temperature enhanced cracking of volatiles to produce non-condensable products [40]. 3.2.4 Effect of catalytic temperature The effect of catalytic upgrading was investigated at the temperature range of 300–700 °C by using 1.0% Au/TS-1 as catalyst. The pyrolysis temperature and mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose is 450 °C and 50, respectively. Fig. 11 shows that both selectivity and yield first increase and then decrease with the increase of catalytic temperature. The largest S LCAs and Y LCAs are 89.2% and 14.4 wt%, respectively, at 500 °C. At the temperature range of 300–500 °C, a moderate increase in catalytic temperature could promote catalytic activity. With the further increase of temperature, the formed products can further undergo cracking or secondary reactions with huge amounts permanent gases, which leads to the decrease of selectivity and yield of LCAs [41]."
9,TG characterization of the used Au/TS-1 catalysts,"3.3 TG characterization of the used Au/TS-1 catalysts As shown in Fig. 12 , TG technique was used to analyze the weight loss of used catalysts and analyze the relationship between carbon deposition amount and gold particle size. The main volatile components are water and carbon deposited on the catalyst. The mass loss before 200 °C is caused by the loss of water on the surface of the catalyst. At 200–270 °C, the water has been completely removed and the weight-loss temperature of carbon has not been reached, so the curves remain flat. At 270–400 °C, the TG curves decreases significantly caused by combustion of carbon deposition, and then remained flat to the final temperature. The weight loss of the four catalysts is 0.97 wt %, 1.08 wt %, 1.18 wt % and 1.47 wt %, respectively. The increase of the content of Au loading leads to the increase of the gold particle size, which results in the increase of the carbon deposition amount of the catalyst [42]."
10,Possible upgrading mechanism,
11,CP experiments of sugars,"4.1 CP experiments of sugars In order to clarify the possible mechanism to produce LCAs, three represent sugars model compounds including glucose, anhydroglucose and cellobiose were selected. The effect of different sugars model compounds on the distribution of catalytic pyrolysis products was investigated. The experiments were conducted at the pyrolysis and catalytic temperature of 450 °C and 500 °C by using 1.0% Au/TS-1 as catalyst, and mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose was 50. Fig. 13 (a) shows the chromatogram results of three sugars pyrolysis with non-catalyst and over 1% Au/TS-1. Table 4 lists the representative compounds from sugars pyrolysis. The pyrolysis products from anhydroglucose and cellobiose were main sugars and the pyrolysis products from glucose contains furans and sugars and catalysts play an important effect on the distribution of products. The results show the carbon chain of pyrolysis products from sugars is mainly at 6. Fig. 13(b) shows the selectivity and yield of LCAs. The main products are oxygen containing compounds with six carbon atoms and no alkane in the products when the sugars model compounds were pyrolyzed without catalysts. The S LCAs of glucose, anhydroglucose and cellobiose were 68.5%, 75.9% and 85.7% and Y LCAs of three sugars were 13.5%, 11.5% and 15.4% over 1% Au/TS-1. Furthermore, the carbon numbers of LCAs are more than 10, which suggests that the Au/TS-1 can convert short chain compounds into LCAs."
12,Catalytic upgrading of methanol and acetaldehyde,"4.2 Catalytic upgrading of methanol and acetaldehyde The functional groups in glucose are hydroxyl and formyl group, therefore, methanol and acetaldehyde were used to understand which functional groups will contribute to the production of LCAs. Fig. 14 shows the main products from acetaldehyde are aromatic compounds, 2-butenal and sorbaldehyde. The possible reaction mechanism is shown by Scheme 1 (a) and Scheme 1(b). 2-Butenal and sorbaldehyde generate from intermolecular dehydration of acetaldehyde. Aromatic compounds generate from the connection of the head and tail of three acetaldehyde molecules [37]. In contrast, the main products from alkanes after methanol were used. Formaldehyde is detected in the products and the possible reaction mechanism are shown by Scheme 2 . Formaldehyde generates from dehydrogenation of methanol with the production of H2 due to effect of Au nanoparticles and acid sites of TS-1 [43]. Methanol reacts with each other to produce long-chain alcohols via intermolecular dehydration over Au/TS-1 and the end hydroxy of molecules is removed via hydrogenation. Catalytic conversion of model compounds suggests that the alkanes are mainly produced from conversion alcohols in sugars. A small number of aromatic compounds are produced from aldehyde compounds."
13,Conclusion,"Au/TS-1 catalysts were used to catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors of cellulose to produce LCAs and the series catalysts were characterized. The results of characterization show that the Au loading has not changed the structural property of TS-1, but the strength of the acid increases first and then decreases with the increase of content of Au loading. Furthermore, average gold particle increases with the increase of Au content. The selectivity and yield of LCAs increase first and then decrease with the increase of Au loading/pyrolysis temperature/catalytic temperature. At the optimal reaction condition, the selectivity and yield of LCAs are 89.2% and 14.4 wt%, respectively over 1% Au/TS-1 at pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C, catalytic temperature of 500 °C, and the mass ratio of catalyst to cellulose of 50. The catalytic pyrolysis experiments of three sugars show that the Au/TS-1 catalysts can convert vapors into LCAs and promote the carbon chain propagation. The experiments of methanol and acetaldehyde showed that alcohols functional groups in sugars are contributed to the formation of LCAs over Au/TS-1."
