0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid economic growth of developing countries, the demand for crude oil has been increasing from the beginning of this century [1]. To meet this demand, there is a growing interest in processing heavy crude oil. However, 80% of heavy crude oil is left as residual oil after atmospheric or vacuum distillation, compared to 30% of light one [2]. Secondary processing methods, such as hydrogenation and carbon rejection, are thus developed to upgrade the residual oil [3,4]. During these processes, residual oil with high viscosity requires extreme reaction conditions, i.e., high temperature and pressure. Novel preprocessing methods are needed to further improve residual oil quality. In literature, ultrasonic, microwave, and electromagnetism treatments have demonstrated great potentials in processing heavy oil [5–7]. Among those novel methods, high-power ultrasonic treatment is of particular interest, given the development of piezoelectric materials that allows ultrasonic transducers to work in different conditions [8]. The underlying principle for ultrasonic processing is sonochemistry [9], which propagates strong ultrasound in liquid medium, and thus introduce heating, mechanical vibration, and cavitation effects to change the physical and chemical properties of the medium. In petroleum industry, ultrasonic treatment has been used for emulsification/demulsification, viscosity reduction, and component conversion, and all of these can affect oil recovery, transportation, and refinery processes. Yang et al. [10] applied ultrasonic chemical method to demulsification, and they found adding demulsifiers together with ultrasonic method is more efficient than adding demulsifiers only. Huang et al. [11] combined simulation and experiment methods to investigate the viscosity reduction of residual oil by ultrasound. Viscosity reduction can reach 63.95% with a 14-min treatment under the mode of 2 s exposure and 2 s interruption. Moreover, Yang et al. [12] mixed tetralin into residual oil during ultrasonic treatment, and found that the combined treatment could reduce viscosity, density and pour point of vacuum residual oil. Song et al. [13] compared heat cracking with ultrasonic-assisted cracking, and reported that the addition of ultrasound could elevate the light oil yield and inhibit coking processing. Gopinath et al. [14] found that the viscosity of heavy gas oil was reduced by 5% after sonication, and 11% of nitrogen element was converted. Nesterenko et al. [15] probed the probability of hydrocarbons cracking during ultrasonic treatment, and found that approximately 0.1–0.3 kg of hydrocarbons were cracked when 360 L of oil passed through a cavitation pump. Lin and Yen [16] reported an asphaltene upgrading process using ultrasonic treatment. In their work, extracted asphaltene was dissolved in toluene and mixed with extensive water to fit into 4 W/cm2 ultrasonic transducer, and finally 22.5% of asphaltene was converted to gas oil and resin. In the work of Kaushik et al. [17], 48% and 40% of asphaltene reductions were obtained by ultrasonic treatment in the presence and absence of surfactant, respectively. A range of characterization methods have been utilized to reveal underlying mechanism of residual oil conversion during ultrasonic treatment. Cataldo [18] selected certain aromatic and naphthenic compounds to investigate bond cleavage using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and they found chain and ring cleavage even occurred in light components such as benzene and toluene. Dunn and Yen [19] adopted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to explore the reaction pathway of asphaltene under ultrasonic treatment. They separated hydrogen into six major types: aromatic hydrogen, α hydrogen to two aromatics, α hydrogen to one aromatic, naphthenic hydrogen, paraffinic methylene, and paraffinic methyl hydrogen. The percentage variation of different types reflects the degree of dehydrogenation and cracking, and it was found dehydrogenation and cracking occurred simultaneously during treatment. The specific forms of dehydrogenation and cracking can be chemical bond cleavage and change of colloidal system, which are the most accepted hypotheses in literature [20]. Under high power where cavitation bubbles collapse, huge energy is released in a tiny area which is enough to break the chemical bond of residual oil [21]. Extensive radicals are thus formed, and a series of hydrogen transform reactions can elevate light oil production. Meanwhile, saturate and asphaltene are immiscible, which leads to a colloidal system of residual oil [22]. That is, ultrasonic vibration changes the characteristics and component distribution of residual oil. However, changes in the characteristics of crude oil are not always desired. Mousavi et al. [23] adopted a low power (75 W) ultrasonic device to treat asphaltenic crude oil, and discovered that the storage (elastic) modulus increased during the treatment, leading to viscosity increment. Moreover, Mullakaev et al. [24] revealed that viscosity reduction only appeared in oil with low-alkane content, while a continuous viscosity increment appeared in oil with high-alkane content. In the experiments of Mousavi et al. [25], long treatment duration caused serious asphaltene aggregation. Additionally, different parameter combination also affects the optimal frequency. Mahapatra and Kirpalani [26] evaluated cavitation degree by measuring the concentration of iodide ions, and found mid-sonication frequency (378 and 574 kHz) is the optimum frequency for bitumen treatment. Contrarily, in the work of Nguyen et al. [27], increasing frequency to several hundreds of kHz caused an increase of cavitation threshold, and Niazi et al. [28] reported that 20 kHz is the optimum frequency to produce the most intense cavitation zone. From above, it can be seen that different parameters can simultaneously affect the treatment processing. To ensure the performance of ultrasonic treatment, it is thus of great importance to understand the changes of residual oil characteristics under different treatment conditions. Therefore, in this work, we analyzed the rheological properties, component conversion, and asphaltene chemical structure associated with ultrasonic treatment of residual oil. As shown below, our results can help to propose desired methods to improve the performance of ultrasonic treatment for industrial applications."
1,Experiment section,
2,Experimental devices and samples,"2.1 Experimental devices and samples Our experimental device mainly includes three parts: ultrasonic generator, inert nitrogen gas blowing, as depicted in Fig. 1 , and water bath heating which is set alone. The ultrasonic transducer in this work can produce 70.77 W/cm2 power density, which is enough to induce strong cavitation effect [29] in residual oil. In following, high-power density is defined as the full-power density of ultrasonic transducer, and 15% power density is defined as the low-power density where cavitation is difficult to occur. These two levels of power density can separate the results of cavitation effect from vibration effect. Ultrasonic horn was directly immersed in residual oil to reduce the loss of energy. Nitrogen gas blowing part includes nitrogen gas cylinder and gas channel, i.e. nitrogen gas inlet and outlet, and valve. Nitrogen gas cylinder was used to store nitrogen gas and produce gas flow before ultrasonic treatment. After treatment, vessel was fixed on experimental table, and air above the liquid level was sealed. Nitrogen gas inlet and outlet sets on the experimental table have a channel to blow air out of reaction vessel. Blowing process lasted about 5 min and then nitrogen gas cylinder was closed. Meanwhile, valve was shut down to hold a stable nitrogen gas environment in reaction vessel. Pressure gauge on the experimental table was used to monitor the pressure variation to avoid potential dangers during treatment. An atmospheric residual oil (AR) from Venezuela was employed as the experimental sample. AR shows poor mobility at room temperature and has a high content of asphaltene (14.20%). To probe the effect of hydrogen donor, we prepared one additional sample by adding decalin into residual oil (hereafter referred to as ARH). Since explosive decalin peroxide forms when it contacts with oxygen gas, nitrogen gas was blown through the reaction vessel to replace the internal air and prevent the oxidization of decalin."
3,Experimental process,"2.2 Experimental process When ultrasound propagates to the residual oil at room temperature, high sound absorption, induced by the high viscosity of residual oil, turns mechanical vibration into heat around the ultrasonic horn. This vibration reduces the treatment range, and can damage the polarization of piezoelectric material. Hence, residual oil should be pre-heated in the water heating bath at 50℃ to reach a suitable treating viscosity. Our experimental process is depicted in Fig. 2 . First, heating bath reached the given temperature, and residual oil temperature kept constant for more than 30 min. Then, residual oil was transferred to the reaction vessel before stirring evenly. The diameter of the reaction vessel is 10 cm, enough to contain 1.2 L residual oil. In the system with hydrogen donor, 3% mass fraction of decalin was added, and then stirred uniformly. Part of residual oil or mixed oil was taken as blank sample before ultrasonic treatment. That is, to probe the effect of ultrasonic treatment, blank sample was chosen as the sample treated by preheating and mechanical stirring but with no ultrasonic treatment. For ultrasonic treatment, we adopted the mode of 5-min treatment and 5-min rest. In resting period, proper stirring ensured thermal heat produced by ultrasound conducted to oil in the whole vessel. Oil samples for measurement were collected and ultrasonic horn was cooled. Then, next treatment cycle was conducted, and treatment duration was calculated as the accumulated time. The longest treatment period was 20 mins under full-power density, after which the accumulated heat began to be non-negligible. When treating at low-power density, thermogenesis was small, so continuous treatment was feasible. In this case, accumulated treatment duration in this condition was extended to 70 mins."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods For rheological characteristics, viscosity was measured by a rotary viscometer from Brookfield. All samples from the same experiment were first cooled for a day to reach room temperature. When analyzing viscosity reduction, the blank sample was measured every day to amend μ0 . The following method is used to calculate viscosity reduction [11]: (1) η = μ 0 - μ μ 0 × 100 % where, μ0 is the viscosity of blank oil sample, μ is the viscosity of treated oil sample, η is the viscosity reduction. Usually, crude oil can be divided into four main components: saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene, which is based on solubilities in heptane, toluene and ethyl alcohol [30–32]. Among them, saturate and aromatic are light components, while resin and asphaltene are heavy ones. In this work, a four-component analysis method, following China petrochemical industry standard SH/T 0509-92, was adopted to analyze residual oil composition, as well as compositional changes induced by ultrasonic treatment. Specifically, 1 g oil sample was dissolved in 30 mL heptane, heated to 110℃, and then refluxed for half hour. After extraction, asphaltene remained on the filter paper, and filtrate passed the liquid–solid adsorption chromatography to separate saturate, aromatic and resin. Table 1 shows the solvents used in the adsorption chromatography. In addition to four-component analysis, relative molecular mass was measured by K-7000 relative molecular mass measuring instrument from Knauer, Germany, adopting vapor pressure osmosis measuring method. Reference curve was sketched by biphenyl amide solution, where AR sample weighed 0.02 g was directly dissolved in 5 g toluene to meet the concentration in the reference scale at 0.005–0.02 kg/mol. The final value was obtained by averaging three measurements. To probe reaction pathways under ultrasonic treatment, hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) was employed to probe the types of hydrogen atoms [33,34] using an AV400 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer from Bruker. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) was adopted to investigate the distribution of functional groups using a Bruker vertex infrared spectrometer."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Viscosity reduction,"3.1 Viscosity reduction Rheological property, i.e., viscosity, of residual oil can affect its mobility in pipelines, pumping pressure, and facility maintenance. Therefore, viscosity is first measured and analyzed in our work. After treatment, viscosity was recorded once per day, and viscosity reduction was calculated using the method introduced in Section 2. As shown in Fig. 3 , viscosity reduction of AR was analyzed and treatment duration was indicated by the number after sample name. We can see that all four curves depict positive reduction, indicating that ultrasonic treatment enhances the mobility of AR. The curve representing 5-min treatment has lower viscosity reduction than all other curves and drops to zero in the last few days, which suggests that viscosity reduction of ultrasonic treatment is an accumulative process. The other three curves first show an average reduction, respectively, 14.66%, 12.92% and 11.28%, in the first four days. Then, the reductions drop to 7%, and fluctuate around this value to the end of the measurement. These phenomena seem to suggest that viscosity reduction can be divided into reversible portion and irreversible portion, and reversible reduction disappears after certain aging period while irreversible reduction remains. To further investigate viscosity reduction, 3% of hydrogen donor was added into AR before ultrasonic treatment. After adding hydrogen donor, oil viscosity decreases to 60% of the initial value through dilution effect, and this value is used as the reference to calculate the viscosity reduction of ARH for different treatment durations (indicated by the number after sample name) shown in Fig. 4 . First, it can be observed that 5-min treatment can achieve a reduction of 20%, compared with a 7% viscosity reduction by ultrasound only. That is, the addition of hydrogen donor brings in higher efficiency and improved results. Moreover, all curves are more or less overlapping with one another, suggesting that ARH rheological properties keep unchanged during the whole treatment process. Viscosity reduction drops to 8% from the fifth day, suggesting that two types of viscosity reduction, reversible vs. irreversible, also appear in this case. According to the mechanisms proposed in literature, reversible viscosity reduction associates with colloidal system disaggregation, while irreversible viscosity reduction associates with chemical bond cleavage [35]. To separate these two mechanisms, additional experiments were carried out under low-power density, which can only introduce colloidal system disaggregation. As shown in Fig. 5 , viscosity remains more or less unchanged until treatment duration reaches 70 min. For this treatment, viscosity reduction was positive in the first four days and then reduced to a negative value. Finally, viscosity reduction returned to zero slowly. The observed reductions are due to that ultrasonic treatment can release light components from the steric colloidal structure surrounding heavy molecules. However, once external vibration vanishes, colloidal system will reach a new equilibrium state, and the rearrangement of colloidal system can thus cause slight viscosity increments. Comparing the two cases (low-power vs. high-power), it can be seen that for treatment duration longer than 5 min, high-power density treatment can bring in chemical bond cleavage in addition to colloidal system disaggregation, leading to irreversible viscosity reduction (Fig. 3). On the other hand, this irreversible reduction is absent in the case of low power-density treatment, where only colloidal system disaggregation is introduced to the sample."
7,Component conversion,"3.2 Component conversion Besides viscosity, component conversion of AR reflects light oil yield and coking rate; component analysis can help to understand product quality and reaction pathways. Therefore, to perform conversion analysis, oil samples were mixed with, respectively, heptane (for composition analysis) and toluene (for relative molecular mass analysis), immediately after ultrasonic treatment to inhibit further changes. Component conversion results of AR are shown in Table 2 and AR0 is the blank sample without ultrasonic treatment. The content of asphaltene initially shows a fast drop followed by increments, while those of all the other three components first increase followed by decrement. With 10-min treament, asphaltene content is reduced by 7.18%, whereas aromatic and saturate contents are increased by, respectively, 4.3% and 0.88%. However, when treatment duration is further extended, contents of saturate and aromatic show decrement, and those of resin and asphaltene, especially asphaltene, exhibit increasing trends. At the end of the treatment, asphaltene has a 1.76% increment; contrarily, 6.49% of saturate was converted, which greatly reduces the yield of production oil. These observations demonstrate that component conversion is associated with treatment duration. With sufficiently long treatment duration, reaction pathway under high-power ultrasonic treatment includes two steps: chemical bond cleavage and recombination of heavy radicals [36]. The first step will increase the light oil yield, while the second step can increase the content of heavy components [37,38]. It has been proposed that the addition of hydrogen donor is an effective way to prevent the recombination of heavy radicals [12]. To verify this, we analyzed the system of ARH in Table 3 . ARH0 represents the sample with addition of hydrogen donor and mechanical stirring before ultrasonic treatment. Comparing ARH0 and AR0, conversion between resin and asphaltene can be observed. Because the power of stirring is not strong enough to cause cavitation, this conversion reflects the change of colloidal system due to the addition of decalin, which can disassociate asphaltene particles and convert them to resin. During ultrasonic treatment, the highest increment of saturate is 3.34%, compared to 0.88% in the experiment of ultrasonic treatment only (Table 2). Even at the end of the treatment, saturate has an increment of 0.82%. Furthermore, the highest increment of aromatic is only 1.18%, compared to 4.3% in Table 2; the highest increment of resin is 2.29%, compared to 3.38% in Table 2. That is, the addition of hydrogen donor increases the yield of saturates [39]. Regarding asphaltene, its conversion is always negative, indicating a clear decrement. Clearly, by adding hydrogen donor, the percentage of heavy components is effectively reduced by suppressing the recombination of heavy radicals. To probe conversion induced by colloidal system disaggregation, Table 4 shows component analysis of AR under low-power density treatment. As can be seen, about 3% of asphaltene was converted, resulting in a ~1% increment for each of the other three components. Furthermore, the conversion is almost the same with different treatment durations. That is, colloidal system change brings little effect to component conversions, compared to chemical bond cleavage under high-power treatment. We further measured relative molecular mass under high-power treatment. Table 5 shows the results in the absence and presence of hydrogen donor from different treatment durations. As can be seen, relative molecular mass of AR first reduces to 515.47 and then increases to 940.35, consistent with the trends exhibited by asphaltene content. In the measurement of ARH, its relative molecular mass is always lower than the initial value, consistent, again, with the trends of asphaltene contents. That is, the addition of hydrogen donors can suppress the recombination of heavy radicals, leading to reduced asphaltene content as well as decreased relative molecular mass."
8,Chemical structure of asphaltene,"3.3 Chemical structure of asphaltene The above analysis shows that asphaltene conversion is closely related to the yield of saturate. Therefore, in this section, we will focus on the changes in the chemical structure of asphaltene induced by ultrasonic treatment. Since component conversion of low-power density treatment is negligible, we only measured the asphaltene structure extracted from high-power density treatment. After ultrasonic treatment, 5 g residual oil was taken from each sample bottle to extract asphaltene. Residual oil was dissolved in heptane, heated to 110℃, and refluxed for 60 min. About 0.5 g of the residual oil was left on the filter paper, and then it was dried in vacuum drying chamber before asphaltene collection. To analyze chemical structure, NMR is first utilized to classify hydrogen atoms, following the standard SY/T 5777–1995. Hydrogen atoms are divided into four types HA , Hα , Hβ , and Hγ and their chemical shifts belong to 6.0–9.0, 2.0–4.0, 1.0–2.0, and 0.5–1.0, respectively. HA indicates hydrogen atoms that connect to aromatic rings; Hα corresponds to atoms in the substituent group on the alpha position of aromatic rings; Hβ includes methylene atoms and atoms in the substituent group on the beta position of aromatic rings; and Hγ includes methyl and atoms in the substituent group on the gamma position of aromatic rings. In spectrums, peaks 1.26 ppm and 0.87 ppm reflect the content of methylene hydrogen on long chains and methyl hydrogen, respectively. The distribution of hydrogen atom can reflect the pathway of reaction. Furthermore, the chemical structure of asphaltene can be assessed by aromatic hydrogen rate (fa ), substituent average carbon number (N), and degree of branching (BI ). Formula of these indexes are as follows: (2) f a = H A / H A + H α + H β + H γ × 100 % (3) N = H α + H β + H γ / H α (4) B I = H γ / H α + H β For NMR spectrums, integration of hydrogen atoms and main peak levels of AR and ARH are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. Their corresponding indexes are listed in Table 6 . As can be seen in Fig. 6 (AR), from 0 to 10 min, both peaks at 1.26 ppm and 0.87 ppm drop, and their ratios were also reduced by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Since methyl group is the termination of chains and methylene group is their medium part, it reveals that long side chains in asphaltene become shorter and fewer. Moreover, the reduction of BI (Table 6) from 0.32 to 0.20 corresponds to reduced branching degrees, and suggests the falling off of side chains. Meanwhile, fa and N decreases, indicating that aromatic atoms are being converted to light components or resin. These results are consistent with the increased saturate content, and decreased asphaltene content shown in section 3.2. However, from 10 to 15 min, peaks of 1.26 ppm and 0.87 ppm begin to rise, and their ratios also increase. Correspondingly, fa, and BI, and N increase. These observations should be attributed to that more side chains are being gathered on asphaltene molecules. That is, during ultrasonic treatment, long side chains in asphaltene fall off at the first step (chemical bond cleavage), which increases the yield of light component; when treatment duration is longer than the optimal range, more and more radicals are produced and they prefer to recombine with each other to form larger asphaltene molecules (recombination of heavy radicals). With further increasing treatment duration from 15 to 20 min, while peaks of 1.26 ppm and 0.87 ppm continues to rise, suggesting the formation of long chains, fractions of Hβ and Hγ are decreased, respectively, from 50.9% to 38.8%, and from 20.3% to 18.4%. Since Hβ and Hγ represent hydrogen atoms from all side chains (both long and short ones), the observation here seems to suggest that during recombination processes, despite that long side chains are being formed, the overall hydrogen content from side chains is actually decreased. That is, the recombination of heavy radicals is accompanied by dehydrogenation when treatment duration is further increased. Indeed, the contents of HA is increased by 8.5% from 15 to 20 min, leading to the highest fa (20.41%), and despite the increase of Hα, N was found to decreased from 5.20 to 3.55, representing the decreased average carbon number in substituent. Both observations confirm the increment of aromatic fraction in asphaltene, i.e., the overall decrement of hydrogen content (dehydrogenation). For ARH (Fig. 7), we can observe that variation of each characteristic is much lower than that of AR. For instance, in Fig. 7, the peak of 1.26 ppm only shows increasing trend, and the peak at 0.87 ppm remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, in Table 6, from 0 to 20 min, fa and N remains approximately unchanged. Considering the yield of saturate, and the decrement of asphaltene content (section 3.2), these much smaller variations indicate that the added hydrogen donors provide active hydrogen radicals, which can quickly react with the heavy radicals formed by chemical bond cleavage. That is, the recombination among heavy radicals is suppressed. In addition to the analysis of hydrogen distribution, we further utilized IR analysis to investigate the distribution of functional groups in asphaltene. Results of ultrasonic treatment without (AR) and with hydrogen donor (ARH) are shown in Fig. 8 . Since the percentage of asphaltene cannot be maintained completely constant, we mainly focus on the peaks of 2940 and 2860 cm−1, which represent methyl and methylene groups, respectively. In Fig. 8 a), similar to the variation in Fig. 6, both peaks drop at first 10 min and rise obviously afterwards. Generally, content of methylene group reflects the average length of side chains, and the content of methyl reflects the amount of chains. Hence, the variation of peaks indicates that side chains become fewer and shorter from 0 to 10 min, and become more and longer from 10 to 20 min, correlating, respectively, with the cleavage of side chains and recombination of radicals during ultrasonic treatment. Moreover, comparing 15-min treatment with 20-min treatment, a decrement is observed for both peaks. These decrements are consistent with the decrements observed for Hβ and Hγ shown in Fig. 6, confirming that with further increasing treatment durations from 15 to 20 min, recombination of heavy radicals is accompanied by dehydrogenation. On the other hand, in Fig. 8 b), both peaks are below their initial level along the entire treatment. That is, by introducing hydrogen donors, chain cleavage is dominantly present with negligible radical recombination. From the above analysis, when side chains or rings fall off, the yield of saturate becomes higher; when heavy radicals recombine, the content of asphaltene increases. That is, chemical bond cleavage is conducive to treatment results, while radical recombination is disadvantageous. The addition of hydrogen donor is effective to suppress radical recombination, and thus benefits light oil yield."
9,Conclusion,"In this work, we systematically investigated the effect of ultrasonic treatments on residual oil characteristics. Conclusions are as follows: (1) Viscosity reduction of residual oil induced by high-power density treatment can be separated into reversible and irreversible portions. Reversible viscosity reduction associates with colloidal system disaggregation, while irreversible viscosity reduction associates with chemical bond cleavage. Low-power density treatment can only introduce reversible viscosity reduction. The addition of hydrogen donor can effectively control viscosity reduction, evidenced by that different treatment durations lead to almost the same reduction curves. (2) Apparent component conversion only appears in the experiment of high-power density treatment. When treated by ultrasonic treatment only, content of light component first increases and then decreases with extending duration time. In line with this, asphaltene contents exhibit opposite trends. With the addition of hydrogen donors, saturate contents are higher than its initial value over the entire treatment, and meanwhile, the percentage of asphaltenes is deceased. (3) The underlying mechanisms responsible for the above observation is that low-power density can introduce little chemical bond cleavage, while reaction pathway of high-power ultrasonic treatment includes two steps: chemical bond cleavage and recombination of heavy radicals. The first step will increase the light oil yield while the second step can increase the content of asphaltene. With short duration, the first step dominates; with longer duration, the second step can become dominating, and thus decreases saturate contents and increases asphaltene contents. The addition of hydrogen donors can effectively prevent the recombination of heavy radicals. (4) The aforementioned mechanisms are further confirmed by additional analysis on hydrogen atoms using NMR and functional group using IR. It was found that during ultrasonic treatment, asphaltene first cracks to produce light components. When treatment time exceeds optimal range, radical recombination occurs, resulting in the reformation of heavy molecules. With further increasing treatment duration, this recombination is accompanied by dehydrogenation. Adding hydrogen donor suppresses the recombination of heavy radicals by providing active hydrogen radicals. The results reported here shed lights on optimizing ultrasonic treatment parameters to achieve optimal results."
