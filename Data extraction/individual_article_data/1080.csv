0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), a clean and renewable energy source, exhibits a variety of energy release methods, including thermal energy released by the combustion process, mechanical energy converted from thermal energy in a thermal engine, and electrical energy converted in fuel cells. In recent years, the electrochemical water-splitting (EWS, 2H2O→O2 + 2H2) has been recognized as promising method for efficient and green H2 production. However, the conventional EWS may be not preferred for electrochemical H2 production. The main reasons are as follows: (1) the electrolysis voltage in actual operation system is much higher than 1.23 V theoretical voltage of EWS mainly due to the high overpotential (η) of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. (2) Oxygen (O2), an anode product during conventional EWS, is low value, which can be obtained more easily from the air. (3) O2 generated at the anode is highly prone to mix with H2 produced at the cathode, resulting in the possibility of explosion [1–3]. Recently, replacing OER with various small molecules (such as ammonia [4], hydrazine [5,6], urea [7–9], methanol [10], ethanol [11,12], isopropanol [13], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [14–16], benzyl alcohol [17] and primary amine [18]) oxidation reactions has proven to be an effective strategy to construct a more efficient and economical EWS system, which can decrease dramatically the overall electrolysis voltage and/or even generate the value-added fine chemicals at anode. For example, Xia’s group replaced the OER with the hydrazine oxidation reaction to achieve electrochemical H2 production at an ultralow voltage of only 0.164 V, which provided an energy-saving electrochemical H2 production [5]. Jin’s group replaced the OER with the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction to achieve H2 production at cathode, accompanying with the generation of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid at anode, which given an economic-upgrading electrochemical H2 production [16]. Additionally, benzonitrile is a common precursor of various fine chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, natural products and pesticides [19]. The most common approach to the preparation of nitriles involves the substitution of a leaving group in organic compounds with a cyanide source, which often referring complex operations and toxic reagents (such as KCN or CuCN) [20]. Recently, electrochemical oxidation of benzylamine to prepare benzonitrile has become a clean, efficient and selective method [18]. Besides the design of the anode coupling reaction, the intrinsic activity enhancement of electrocatalyst is also very important for EWS, which generally is achieved by morphology and composition control. Recently, two-dimensionally (2D) ultra-thin transition metal based nanosheets have emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for various energy-relative electrocatalytic reactions (such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [21–25], OER [22,26–31], alcohol oxidation reaction [32], CO2 reduction reaction [33–38], and nitrogen reduction reaction [39–42], etc.) due to their high specific surface area and altered electronic structure. For example, Zhang’s group synthesized ultra-thin δ-FeOOH nanosheets with 1.7 nm thickness by a simple wet-chemistry method, which revealed significant activity for both HER and OER in KOH electrolyte and could achieve 10 mA cm−2 current density (i 10) at electrolysis voltage of only 1.62 V for overall EWS [22]. Zhang’s group synthesized ultra-thin CoP ultra-thin nanosheets with (200) facets and 1.1 nm thickness by the chemical transformation method, which only required 56 mV overpotential to achieve i 10 for HER in H2SO4 electrolyte [21]. Considering that atoms at nanosheets’ edges generally possess higher activity than atoms at nanosheet basal planes due to lower coordination number [43,44], the ultra-thin nanomeshes (UNMs, i.e., the ultra-thin nanosheets with uniform holes) have additional advantages for electrocatalytic reactions relative to their nanosheet counterparts. The substantial holes on UNMs not only provide numerous edge atoms with high activity but also accelerate the mass transfer, resulting in enhanced reactivity [45–54]. For example, ultra-thin LiCoO2 nanomeshes have better activity than LiCoO2 nanosheets for the OER, confirming edge atoms possess more higher intrinsic activity than basal plane atoms [52]. Among various transition metal based nanomaterials [55–71], transition metal phosphides nanomaterials are highly attractive for EWS due to their high activity for HER and OER in wide pH range [57–67,71]. In particular, ultra-thin nickel phosphide nanosheets show super activity for HER [72–77]. Although nickel phosphide nanosheets have promising electrochemical applications, the synthesis of ultra-thin nickel phosphide nanosheets still retain challenge because high-temperature phosphidation treatment generally results in the aggregation. So far, ultra-thin nickel phosphide nanomeshes are rarely reported because their synthesis is more complicated and difficult. Herein, we synthesized ultra-thin nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanomeshes on nickel foam (NF) substrate (denoted as Ni2P-UNMs/NF) through phosphidation treatment using Ni(OH)2 nanomeshes on NF substrate (denoted as Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF) as reaction precursor. Benefiting from their structural characteristics, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites revealed super activity for HER and benzylamine oxidation reaction (BOR) in alkaline electrolyte. As a result, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites could be directly applied as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in two-electrode electrolyzer, which could actualize BOR boosted EWS in the presence of benzylamine. The fabricated Ni2P-UNMs/NF||Ni2P-UNMs/NF electrolyzer only needed 1.41 V electrolysis voltage to fetch the 10 mA cm-2 current density for H2 production at cathode and value-added benzonitrile production at anode in 1 M KOH and 0.125 M benzylamine electrolyte."

8,Synthesis and characterization of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites were obtained through phosphidation treatment at 300 °C for 2 h using Ni(OH)2 nanomeshes on NF substrate (denoted as Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF) as reaction precursor (Scheme 1 ), in which Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF nanocomposites were easily obtained by cyanogel-NaBH4 hydrolysis method [78] developed by us in the presence of NF substrate. Scheme 1 SEM was used to visualize the morphological feature of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites. Similar to NF substrate (Fig. S1), Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites have three-dimensionally (3D) macroporous architecture (Fig. 1 A), which efficiently accelerates the mass transfer of electrolyte, reactants and products during electrocatalytic reactions [79,80]. The high-resolution SEM (HR-SEM) image shows that Ni2P nanostructures on NF substrate are consisted of ultra-thin nanosheets (Fig. 1B), which is coincident with architecture and morphology of Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF reaction precursor (Fig. S2). The initial in-situ growth of Ni(OH)2-UNMs on NF substrate is responsible for the direct growth of Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate. The direct conversion strategy improves the adhesion intensity between Ni2P-UNMs and NF substrate with outstanding conductivity, suppresses the detachment of Ni2P-UNMs, and avoids the usage of organic binders [79]. It is worth noting that NF substrate plays a very important role for generation of Ni2P-UNMs. When use Ni(OH)2-UNMs without NF substrate as reaction precursor, the products have severe aggregation (Fig. S3), indicating NF substrate can effectively suppress the sintering of UNMs during high-temperature phosphidation process. In order to eliminate the interference of NF substrate on physical characterization, the strong sonication was used to separate Ni2P-UNMs from NF substrate. TEM image also confirms that Ni2P-UNMs have sheet-like morphology (Fig. 1C). AFM image confirms that Ni2P-UNMs have 2D sheet-like morphology and height profile reveals that thickness of Ni2P-UNMs is ca. 1.9 nm (Fig. 1D). EDX analysis show and the atomic ratio of Ni/P is ca. 2:1 (Fig. S4). STEM-EDX mapping indicates the uniform distribution of Ni and P (Fig. 1E), indicating that phosphidation treatment can effectively convert Ni(OH)2 to Ni2P. PXRD is used to further confirm the generation of Ni2P. XRD diffraction peaks of Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate locate at 32.7°, 36.7°, 40.3° and 55.6°, which matches perfectly the standard card of nickel phosphide (JCPDS card: 03-0953). The elemental and electronic characteristics of Ni2P-UNMs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ni and P elements appear at the full survey spectrum and the atomic ratio of Ni/P is ca. 2:1 (Fig. 2 B), which confirms the successful synthesis of Ni2P. In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2C), the binding energy of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni2p3/2 locate at 870.1 eV and 852.2 eV. The Ni 2p peaks at 875.7 and 857.1 eV can be ascribed to the oxidized Ni [6,72,73,81]. At the same time, the peak at 848.9 eV observed clearly can be vest in NiP species’ characteristic peak [6,72,73,81], which also proves the present of Ni2P. In the P 2p region, two peaksat 130.2 and 129.3 eV are correspond to P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 (Fig. 2D), respectively [6,72,73,81], and the peak at 134.0 eV for P can be assigned to phosphorus oxide due to air contact [82]. The detailed morphological and structural information of Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate were further represented by HR-TEM. It can be seen in the HR-TEM image that there are numerous holes displayed in the Ni2P nanosheets (Fig. 3 A). SAED image show distinct reflection dots pattern, implying the high crystallinity degree (Insert in Fig. 3A). Magnified HR-TEM image clearly shows the nanoholes evenly distribute on whole nanosheet, and the diameter of nanoholes is ca. 2.0 nm (Fig. 3B). N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement was performed to further probe the microstructure of Ni2P-UNMs. Ni2P-UNMs reveal the typical type-IV isotherm (Fig. 3C), confirming their porous characteristic [78,80,83]. The hole-size distribution curve shows that the mean diameter of nanoholes is ca. 2.2 nm (Insert in Fig. 3C), in accord with HR-TEM characterization. The specific surface area of Ni2P-UNMs is calculated to be 96.5 m2 g−1 according to the isotherm curve. The ultra-thin thickness and numerous holes of Ni2P-UNMs are responsible for such big specific surface area. Additionally, clear lattice fringes with 0.221 nm and 0.192 nm emerge in further magnify HR-TEM diagrams (Fig. 3D), corresponding to (111) and (210) facets of Ni2P. In our previous work, we have found that the cyanogel-NaBH4 method is highly efficient strategy for synthesis of transition metal oxide/hydroxide nanomeshes [78,80,83]. The cyanogel 2D construction unit can manifest as a self-template to guide the development of 2D nanosheets. As the abscission of the chloride and cyano ligands of the cyanogel 2D construction unit, the nanoholes emerges naturally [78,80,83]. TEM images confirm that Ni(OH)2-UNMs on NF substrate have numerous nanoholes (Fig. S5). According to physical characterization of Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate (Fig. 3B and 3C), we can safely conclude that phosphorization treatment doesn’t result in breakdown of nanoholes at Ni(OH)2-UNMs, which leads to the nanoholes at Ni2P-UNMs."
9,HER activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites,"3.2 HER activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was executed to assess the HER performance of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites in alkaline electrolyte. For comparison, the irregular Ni2P nanocrystals growth on NF substrate (denoted as Ni2P-NCs/NF, Fig. S6) and NF substrate supported Pt nanocrystals (denoted as Pt-NCs/NF) were also synthesized. The current density and the potential were normalized by geometric area of NF substrate and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. The HER polarization curves reveals that Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites only require a overpotential (η) of 75 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm−2 current density (i10), much smaller than that (η = 141 mV) at Ni2P-NCs/NF nanocomposites (Fig. 4 A), revealing morphology-dependent HER activity. Meanwhile, the HER overpotential (η = 75 mV) at i10 at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is lower than that (η = 27 mV) at Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites (Fig. 4A). However, at 70 mA cm-2 current density, HER overpotential at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is 132 mV, less than that (141 mV) at Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites. Tafel slope values of HER at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites, Ni2P-NCs/NF nanocomposites, and Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites are 60, 65, and 30 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 4B). Since Tafel slope can reflect efficiently HER kinetics, the present results indicate that HER kinetics at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is higher than that at Ni2P-NCs/NF nanocomposites but lower than that at Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites. The HER kinetics at different electrocatalysts were further evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The charge transfer resistance of HER at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites, Ni2P-NCs/NF nanocomposites, and Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites are 10.3 Ω, 33.1 Ω, and 5.2 Ω, respectively (Fig. 4C), also indicating HER activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is lower than Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites but much higher than Ni2P-NCs/NF nanocomposites. Additionally, relative to the most reported nickel phosphides electrocatalysts, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites show smaller HER overpotential at i 10 in alkaline electrolyte (Table 1 ). This enhanced HER reactivity can be attributed to the follow reasons: (i) Direct growth Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate improves the electron transfer; (ii) 3D macroporous architecture of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites accelerates the mass transfer of electrolyte, reactants and products; (iii) 2D ultra-thin structure affords the high specific surface area and active sites; (iv) The substantial holes on Ni2P-UNMs provide numerous active edge atoms and accelerate the mass transfer. We further compare the HER durability of Ni2P-UNMs/NF and Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites by chronoamperometry (Fig. 4D) and chronopotentiometry (Fig. S7) measurements. Both chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometric curves suggest that HER durability of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is very close to Pt-NCs/NF nanocomposites. The strong adhesion of Ni2P-UNMs on NF substrate and the inhibition of Ostwald ripening of Ni2P-UNMs contribute to high HER durability of Ni2P-UNMs/NF."
10,BOR activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites,"3.3 BOR activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites The reactivity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites for BOR was explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Fig. 5 A). CV curves reveal that Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites have palpable activity for the BOR in KOH electrolyte. After adding 0.025 M benzylamine in 1 M KOH electrolyte, the anodic oxidation current at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites increases evidently, indicating their reactivity for BOR. LSV was performed to evaluate BOR activity of NF substrate, Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF and Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites in KOH electrolyte (Fig. 5B). Among them, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites show the lowest onset oxidation potential and biggest oxidation current density at same potential for BOR, revealing the highest activity for BOR. Furthermore, we perform LSV to compare the discrepancy of BOR and OER at Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites in KOH electrolyte (Fig. 5C). The potential values of BOR and OER at i10 locate at 1.34 and 1.52 V, respectively, showing a 180 mV discrepancy. Benzonitrile, a colorless liquid at room temperature, is wieldy used as a polar aprotic solvent, complexing agent for transition metal ions, and versatile precursor to many benzene derivatives. The previous works have demonstrated that benzylamine can convert to benzonitrile by electrooxidation.[18] The BOR activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites was further measured by chronoamperometry tests at different potentials (Fig. S8). After chronoamperometry tests, the electrolyte was collected and extracted with ethyl acetate (6 × 40 mL) after chronoamperometry testing with the total passing charge of ∼385 C (1 mmol benzylamine transfer to benzonitrile). Then detected by gas chromatography and mass spectrometer (GC–MS). Besides benzylamine, only benzonitrile is detected in the electrolyte (Fig. S9), indicating benzonitrile is only product during BOR. Thus, BOR boosted EWS can eliminates effectively the KOH-consumption by CO2 and H2/O2 explosion issues. According to equation (1) and equation (2), benzonitrile yield rate and faradaic efficiency can be obtained (Fig. 5D). Yields were determined by GC analysis using bromobenzene as an internal standard. As observed, the benzylamine yield rate increases with potential, in which the benzylamine yield rate reach 0.047 mmol mg-1 h-1 at 1.5 V. In contrast, the faradaic efficiencies retain constant at different potentials, showing a wide potential range for benzonitrile electrosynthesis. (1) Yield rate = (mol of formed product) / (mass of catalyst × time) (2) FE = (mol of formed product) / (total passed charge / 4 F) According to previous reports, NiII/III couple serves as electrocatalytic central for the BOR in alkaline electrolyte [18]. After the chronopotentiometry test, SEM images show the nanosheet structure of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites still preserve well (Fig. S10). However, EDX analysis of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites shows that Ni and O signals retain constant but P signal significantly decreases (Fig. S11), in consistent with XPS analysis (Fig. S12). XRD pattern shows the diffraction peaks of the Ni2P disappear completely after OER test, and some new peaks about Ni oxide/hydroxide appear (Fig. S13). Thus, all physical characterization indicate that Ni2P is converted into NiOOH. Consequently, NiOOH plays a key role for BOR and the real active centre of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites for BOR is NiOOH species. Previous works have demonstrated that the defects atoms with high activity (such as vacancy, dislocation, grain boundary and metastable species) can directly or indirectly promote the electrooxidation reaction of small molecules [84–87]. Considering that the BOR activity of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is much higher than that of initial Ni(OH)2-UNMs/NF nanocomposites (Fig. 5B), it is reasonable to speculate that in the process of in-situ formation of NiOOH, numerous vacancies in the Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites are formed at the same time due to the natural shedding of phosphorus element, which is beneficial to increase their electrocatalytic activity for BOR."
11,BOR boosted EWS using Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites as a bifunctional electrocatalyst,"3.4 BOR boosted EWS using Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites as a bifunctional electrocatalyst Since Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites have favourable activity and durability for both HER and BOR, which can be used as a dual functional electrocatalyst for BOR to boost EWS in alkaline medium. The HER and BOR performances of Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites were evaluated in 1 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.125 M benzylamine using a three-electrode system (Fig. 6 A). To couple successfully HER and BOR with maximum Faradaic efficiency, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites is expected to possess high selectivity for HER. Thus, the impact of benzylamine on HER was tested by LSV (Fig. 6A). As observed, the existence of benzylamine only slightly decrease the HER activity of cathodic Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites. In this connection, a membrane-free electrolyzer with two-electrode was assembled using Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites as bifunctional electrocatalyst to generate benzonitrile and H2 at anode and cathode, respectively (Inset in Fig. 6C). LSV curves show that Ni2P-UNMs/NF||Ni2P-UNMs/NF electrolyzer require overall voltage of 1.41 V and 1.53 V to achieve i10 in the presence and absence of 0.125 M benzylamine, respectively (Fig. 6B), indicating BOR boosted EWS can provide higher energy conversion efficiency for H2 production than conventional EWS. Furthermore, chronopotentiometric curve reveals that Ni2P-UNMs/NF||Ni2P-UNMs/NF electrolyzer only requires 1.41 V voltage to achieve stable i10 for 40 h (Fig. 6C). During chronopotentiometry test, vigorous H2 gas bubbles are observed at cathode but no O2 or CO2 gas bubbles are observed at anode (insert in Fig. 6C), which eliminates the KOH-consumption by CO2 and H2/O2 explosion issues in conventional EWS. Yields of H2 and benzylamine were determined by GC analysis. At this potential, the yields of H2 and benzylamine were calculated as 0.042 mmol mg-1 h-1 and 0.019 mmol mg-1 h-1 according to Eq. (1). Both faradaic efficiency of BOR and faradaic efficiency of HER are summarized (Fig. 6D), which reveal ∼100% faradaic efficiency for both BOR and HER. Chronopotentiometry measurements also were performed to evaluate the stability of Ni2P-UNMs/NF||Ni2P-UNMs/NF electrolyzer for BOR boosted EWS. Within 20 h, the current density retains constant at 1.41 V potential, indicating high stability, again (Fig. 6E). Such long time chronoamperometry tests are repeated five times. The analytic result of products reveals that both faradaic efficiency of BOR and faradaic efficiency of HER maintain their initial value (∼100%), suggesting the promising practicality."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, ultra-thin Ni2P nanomeshes on NF substrate (denoted as Ni2P-UNMs/NF) are synthesized successfully. This work gives an effective strategy to synthesize atomically thick transition metal phosphide nanomeshes by combining cyanogel-NaBH4 method and phosphidation treatment. Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites show outstanding activity and stability for HER and BOR in alkaline electrolyte, which is ascribed to high specific surface area, sufficient active sites in hole edge of Ni2P nanomeshes, porous framework, the high conductivity of NF substrate. Considering that the low oxidation potential of BOR and economic value of benzonitrile, we report a cost-competitive and energy-saving H2 production by BOR boosted EWS using Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites as bifunctional electrocatalyst. Very importantly, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites reveal excellent selectivity for BOR, which not only obtain value-added benzonitrile at anode but also eliminates the KOH-consumption by CO2 and H2/O2 explosion issues. The successful implementation of the BOR boosted EWS strategy not only achieves the H2 and benzonitrile co-production but also indicates that small oxidation boosted EWS may be future research trend."
