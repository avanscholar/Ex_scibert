0,Introduction,"Perovskite structure transition metal oxides such as niobium-based semiconductors are molecules of interest in photocatalytic water splitting studies due to their layered crystal structure and ion exchange properties. One such material is KNbO3, an orthorhombic crystal that possesses the largest nonlinear coefficients for wavelength conversion of all commercially available inorganic materials. The photocatalytic properties of KNbO3 have been studied using UV light [1,2], but there have been no reports of modified KNbO3 catalysts for use in visible light photocatalysis. A more in-depth studied material has been another niobate semiconductor, K4Nb6O17. The structure of K4Nb6O17 consists of sheets made of two planets of NbO6 octahedra linked with one-half of the K atoms [3]. The potassium ion is easily exchanged by other meal ions to produce nano-composites consisting of a Nb6O17 host layer and nanoscale particles incorporated in the interlayer [4]. The photocatalytic activity of K4Nb6O17 toward water splitting was initially reported by Domen and co-workers [5]. They saw hydrogen production from K4Nb6O17 in degassed water/alcohol solutions under UV irradiation, and increased activity with dopants such as H+ and NiO [6]. Since that time, a few groups have looked at combining CdS and/or Ni with K4Nb6O17 particles to produce visible light hydrogen evolution [7,8]. We have previously reported on the photocatalytic activity of Ni/CdS/KNbO3 composite catalysts [9]. In this study, the same techniques that were developed for the KNbO3 catalysts were applied to create Ni/CdS/K4Nb6O17 catalysts. The structure of composite core was confirmed by XRD (JCPDS Cards 21-1295 and 21-1196) and SEM analysis and hydrogen evolution was determined for using several types of K4Nb6O17 catalyst. In addition, the elemental composition and bonding environments for KNbO3 and K4Nb6O17 were examined by XPS and FTIR."
1,Experimental,
2,Instrumentation and analytical procedures,"2.1 Instrumentation and analytical procedures UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC with an integrating sphere attachment (Shimadzu ISR-260), using Ba2SO4 powder as an internal reference. BET surface area measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Gemini 2360 Analyzer. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were acquired using a Bio-Rad FTS-45 spectrometer with a liquid N2-cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected at with an 8cm−1 resolution using a Spectra-Tech Collector diffuse-reflectance accessory. The solid samples were held in the sample cup of a Spectra-Tech high temperature environmental chamber (HTEC) that could be resistively heated to 1000K (±1K), and the chamber evacuated to 10μTorr. SEM images were taken on a LEO 1550VP FESEM. XRD spectra were recorded on a Phillips X’Pert PRO X-ray diffraction system. XPS experiments were performed in an M-probe surface spectrometer (VG Instruments) using monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.6eV). Liquid-phase reaction products were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC – 5973 MSD System coupled with an Agilent 6890 series automatic liquid sampler. For headspace gas analysis, the photoreactor was connected to a pump-driven recirculating gas flow system, and measurements were taken with a Balzers Prisma QMS 200 quadrupole mass spectrometer. In photolysis experiments, a collimated beam output of a high-pressure Hg–Xe arc lamp was used as a light source. The light beam was passed through an IR filter, a focusing lens and a 400nm cutoff filter before reaching the reactor. The photo-reactor was cooled in order to maintain a constant temperature during each photolytic experiment. Since it is known that colloidal CdS suspensions undergo photocorrosion [10–12] and photocatalytic dissolution [13–17] under oxic conditions, the H2 production experiments were carried out under an argon atmosphere. The photolysis reactors were purged with Ar gas for 30min before the initiation of photolysis in order to eliminate O2. H2 was measured using gas chromatography (HP 5890 Series II) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Due to similar conductivity values for He and H2, nitrogen was used as a carrier gas. The separations were achieved with a molecular sieve column (30m×0.32mm×12.00μm). The gas chromatograph oven temperature was 30°C, as this was found to be the best temperature for spatial resolution between Ar (reactor purge gas) and H2. Calibration curves were fount to be linear over a broad range of concentration. For photolysis experiments, unless otherwise specified, the catalyst loading was 0.2g, the reaction solution was 50mL of 50:50 ethanol/water, and the lamp power was 500W. Aliquots of the reactor’s headspace gas (total headspace volume=100mL) were syringed out in 50μL volumes through a rubber septum. Samples were taken every 8–12h, and several samples were taken at each time point to ensure accuracy."
3,Synthesis of K4Nb6O17,"2.2 Synthesis of K4Nb6O17 The two main methods of synthesizing K4Nb6O17 are either by hydrothermal methods [2,18,19] or by a high-temperature solid-state reaction [4,20–23]. Following the method of Liu et al. [18] 2g of Nb2O5 were combined with 40mL of a 0.5M KOH solution, placed into a sealed Teflon pressure vessel, and heated at 180°C for 4days. However, the XRD patterns indicated that the starting niobate material had not reacted, perhaps because the synthesis temperature was too low; other researchers have indicated that a temperature of greater than 200°C is needed [2]. The remaining syntheses employed a solid-state reaction using K2CO3 and Nb2O5 as the starting materials. As the literature varied upon the synthesis conditions, a range of temperatures (1150–1300°C) and starting material ratios (1:1.3–1:1.5) were used. The starting materials were ground with a mortar and pestle for 30min, and at times acetone was added to aid the mixing process. The mixed powder was then compressed into a wafer form by a bench press operating at 3000psi. The wafer was then broken into a few pieces, placed in a ceramic crucible, and inserted into a high temperature oven. It was found that any synthesis attempts above 1200°C caused the solid mixture to melt. The synthesized materials were examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1 ; many of the K4Nb6O17 XRD spectra in the literature have poor resolution, however our sample closely matched reports with higher resolution data [18]. The best material was obtained using a stoichiometric molecular ratio (1:1.5) of starting materials, a temperature ramp rate of 200°C/h, a dwell temperature of 1150°C, and a dwell time of 10h."
4,Synthesis of H+/K4Nb6O17,"2.3 Synthesis of H+/K4Nb6O17 Following a procedure reported by Abe et al. [24] K4Nb6O17 was placed in a solution of 0.5N H2SO4 and stirred for several days. The color of the solid K4Nb6O17 turned from white to slightly brown over the course of the acid treatment. The solid product was filtered by water funnel, but during filtration, it was observed that a small portion of white product stuck to the walls of the filter funnel, and was only able to be washed down into the filter by addition of ethanol, indicating that this solid was non-polar. Less than 5% of sample mass was in the white, non-polar form."
5,Synthesis of CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 composites,"2.4 Synthesis of CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 composites Nickel coated K4Nb6O17 powders were obtained by first treating the pure K4Nb6O17 sample with Ni(NO3)2 in water, in order to ion-exchange Ni2+ with K+ atoms in the catalyst. The total Ni mass was equal to 0.1% of the catalyst mass; this mass ratio was selected on the basis of previous success with the KNbO3 catalysts. After 1day of stirring, the water suspensions were filtered, washed, and dried. The Ni2+/K4Nb6O17 sample was then reduced in a H2 atmosphere at 500°C for 2h, followed by partial re-oxidation in an O2 atmosphere at 200°C for 1h, to form Ni/K4Nb6O17. The actual form of the Ni, whether in elemental form, Ni0, or as nickel oxide, NiO, was not characterized since the total Ni content was too low to be observed by XPS. It is likely that both forms exist, given that the sample is subject to both reducing and oxidizing conditions during the synthesis. Cadmium sulfide was synthesized within the layers of K4Nb6O17 by the direct reaction of ion-exchanged Cd2+ with aqueous HS−. One gram of K4Nb6O17 was added to a 50mL solution of ethanol containing 1.0×10−2 M cadmium acetate. The covered solution was stirred for 48h. A 50mL solution of ethanol containing 1×10−2 M sodium sulfide was prepared in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box. A sodium sulfide solution was slowly added to the cadmium acetate solution with stirring. The resulting solution was covered and stirred for 24h. The pH of this solution was between pH 6.0 and 6.5. The composite catalyst was then removed from solution by vacuum filtration, washed several times with ethanol, and dried overnight in an oven at 100°C. The yield from this procedure was always greater than 90%. The same procedure was applied to the H+/K4Nb6O17, however after H2/O2 gas treatment, the sample color seemed charred, and the color was non-uniform. And after the addition of CdS nanoparticles, the catalyst color was also non-uniform, indicating poor adhesion of CdS."
6,Results and discussion,
7,KNbO3,"3.1 KNbO3 KNbO3 catalysts that were previously shown to have high photocatalytic activity [9] were examined to some insight into the changes that occur to the catalyst during the sequential synthesis as well as during continuous photolysis. The initial KNbO3 material was synthesized using two different molar ratios of the starting materials (either 1:1 or 1.1:1 ratio of Nb2O5 to K2CO3). Fig. 2 shows DRIFT spectrum for a CdS/Ni/KNbO3 catalyst which had been prepared from 1.1:1 KNbO3, as well as the spectrum of solid CdS. The CdS peak at 1150cm−1 for the CdS/Ni/KNbO3 catalyst is much sharper than the solid CdS peak in the same region, indicating nano-particle CdS, as decreased particle size leads to sharper IR peak width. For catalysts prepared with 1:1 KNbO3, no such sharp CdS peak was seen by FTIR. SEM images had indicated that the 1.1:1 KNbO3 had at least a partially layered structure, somewhere in between pure crystalline KNbO3 and the layered structure of K4Nb6O17. Thus the nanosize CdS is likely only formed between the layers, as it is only seen in the layered materials. Fig. 3 shows the DRIFT spectra for two different Ni-doped catalysts (CdS/Ni/KNbO3 and Ni0.1K0.9NbO3), as well as for KNbO3, in the strongly absorbing metal-oxygen bonding region. Comparing KNbO3 to the Ni-doped catalyst prepared by ion-exchange (CdS/Ni/KNbO3), the proportion of the higher-energy Nb–O edge species at 900cm−1 increases relative to the lower-energy bridged O–Nb–O species at 831cm−1. Since the frequency of the absorptions does not change, it is likely that the reduction in O–Nb–O is due to a physical effect, rather than a change in chemical bonding, as this would affect the dipole moment. Some of the 3-atom O–Nb–O stretching vibrations appeared to be inhibited by neighboring Ni atoms. Comparing KNbO3 to the Ni-doped catalyst prepared by direct incorporation of Ni during KNbO3 synthesis (Ni0.1K0.9NbO3), the absorption peaks for both Nb–O species are shifted to higher energy by 40cm−1. This result indicates that Ni doping increases catalyst defect intensity. Ni, with an ionic radius of 0.69 angstroms, is half the size of K ions, which have an ionic radius of 1.38Å. Therefore it is not surprising that substitution of Ni for K leads to strain on the catalyst structure and an increase in higher-energy Nb–O sites. In an attempt to gain insight into liquid products that may form during the reaction, a photolysis experiment using CdS/Ni/KNbO3 was performed, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC/MS. Due to the necessity to stop gas purging to collect liquid samples, it was difficult to monitor the reaction mixture in real time or to collect sample points during the course of the reaction. Instead, one sample point was taken 30min into the reaction, at which point the reactor was purged again with Ar, and the photocatalysis restarted. The reaction was run for an additional 11.5h, giving 12 total hours of reaction time. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture was immediately analyzed, and it was again analyzed after 30 min. Due to the high concentration of ethanol, it was impossible to quantitatively measure ethanol loss. The identified reaction products were methanol, ethyl acetate and methyl isobutyl ketone. However, these three species are often added as denaturants in commercial ethanol in minute amounts. Thus, it appears no new organic species were generated during the course of the reaction. Since the methyl isobutyl ketone peak overlapped with the ethanol peak, it was possible to examine only methanol and ethyl acetate. Fig. 4 shows the data points collected at the beginning and end segments of the experiment. An immediate loss (∼25%) of ethyl acetate is seen within 30 min, and over the course of the reaction, there is a net loss of close to 40% of the initial ethyl acetate concentration. Conversely, methanol concentration is seen to slightly increase (∼10%) during the course of the reaction. Concentrations of both species did not change greatly during the period of re-exposure to air after the end of the photolysis. It is interesting to note that there is not complete loss of ethyl acetate, and that methanol concentration did not increase much. The data provide indirect evidence for the theory that most ethanol survives the reaction, as there was no sign of ethanol breakdown products other than methanol, and the methanol concentration only increased slightly. And the fact that ethyl acetate, a species more likely to be photo-chemically degraded than ethanol due to the potential for decarboxylation, is not completely lost also supports this theory. An expected product of ethanol dehydration, i.e., acetaldehyde, was not observed; however, no control was performed on pure acetaldehyde to make sure it was able to be resolved from the ethanol peak. To attempt to answer the question of whether the hydrogen atoms in the produced H2 gas come from ethanol or water, a series of experiments using deuterated solvents were conducted. After photolysis, the entire reactor headspace was re-circulated through a mass spectrometer. Since both D+ and H2 + ions are a mass of 2, only HD and D2 could be compared. In the first experiment, 25mL of D2O (99.9%, Cambridge Isotopes) and 25mL of ethanol were used as the reaction solution. The observed ratio of HD to D2 was found to be 1.8–1. As it is possible for proton exchange to occur between water and the ethanol –OH proton (which is known to be acid or base catalyzed), the isotopic composition of water needed to be varied in order to see the contribution of proton exchange in the observed isotopic product ratios. In the second experiment, 12.5mL of H2O and 12.5mL of D2O were used, along with 25mL of ethanol. The observed ratio of HD to D2 was found to be 9.5–1. Proton exchange between water and ethanol was observed, as signals were seen for gas-phase H2O, HDO, D2O, C2H5OH and C2H5OD for all experiments. Assuming all protons for hydrogen production come from either water or the ethanol –OH proton, and assuming complete proton exchange between water and ethanol, and ignoring for the moment any kinetic isotope effect, the ratio of HD to D2 can be calculated from the probability of whether a random available proton is H or D. For the first experiment, the actual molar concentration of each solvent was approximately 27.5M water and 8.6M ethanol. Thus, roughly 7/8 of all available protons would be D, and the remaining 1/8 would be H. Since either HD or DH can be made, the probability of a species with one H atom and one D atom is 1/8 ∗ 7/8+7/8 ∗ 1/8, which is about 1/4. Similarly, the probability of making D2 would be 7/8 ∗ 7/8, which is about 3/4. Thus, the expected product ratio of HD to D2 would be about 1–3, or 0.3. However, the observed ratio was 1.8–1, indicating that at least one of the assumptions is faulty. Similarly, the expected ratio for the second experiment also differs greatly from the experimentally observed ratio. Some possible explanations are as follows. It is very likely the alpha hydrogens from carbon–hydrogen bonds in ethanol could be abstracted to form H2. Thus, a worthwhile future experiment would be to use a deuterated ethanol with isotopically labeled alpha protons (such as CH3CD2OH) in conjunction with H2O, and to check for HD and D2. The rate-limiting step for hydrogen production, which is most likely proton abstraction from either water or ethanol, will also exhibit a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) whose magnitude will depend on the position of the proton in the transition state. For hydroxyl radical abstraction of ethanol alpha hydrogens, this value is known to be approximately 2 [25]. However, this value can certainly be much higher depending on the nature of the hydrogen abstraction reaction in our system. To properly isolate the contribution of the KIE, a control experiment using non-deuterated solvents needs to be run in conjunction with an experiment using completely –OD deuterated solvents, as well as another experiment using fully deuterated ethanol (C2D5OD). The overall hydrogen production would be quantified by the usual GC-TCD method, and the KIE can then be calculated for both the –OH abstraction pathway as well as the –CH abstraction pathway. Another possible explanation is that proton exchange in solution between ethanol and water should be rapid, but at the catalyst surface, it is possible that exchange is slowed down or even completely stopped. And yet another possibility is that protons from the catalyst itself are reduced to H2. We have seen evidence for a Ni–H species from NMR data, and since we believe Ni plays an important role as an electron sink, hydrogen production likely occurs near Ni atoms, and thus near a source of H atoms. Fig. 5 shows the XPS data for the Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states in CdS/Ni/KNbO3 before and after photolysis. Two distinct forms of Cd are observed, and the ratio of the two changes after the photoreaction. Note that no change in Nb peak shape was seen. The higher-energy peaks in each pairing (413.6 and 406.9eV) are assigned to CdS, and the lower-energy peaks (412.8 and 406.0eV) are assigned to Cd-substituted niobate sites, which would have CdO character. Reference data indicates CdS to have a binding energy between 0.7 and 1.1eV higher than CdO [26], which is consistent with the 0.8–0.9eV difference in peak positions. Using the Nb peak to normalize the relative peak areas between the two samples (the overall Nb content should not change), it was found that there was a 25% loss of Cd that occurred during photolysis, but no net loss of sulfur (the XPS sulfur signal was too weak to perform individual peak assignment, only total area could be measured). The loss in intensity is seen as a reduction in the CdO peak, which can be explained as follows. It is likely that not all Cd substitution sites were accessible for formation of CdS, and thus remained in the niobate matrix as Cd counterions. The Cd at these substitution sites could then leech out of the catalyst during the 24-h reaction period. Another possibility is that the Cd loss was actually from CdS particles that had been photo-corroded, while elemental sulfur remained in the matrix."
8,K4Nb6O17,"3.2 K4Nb6O17 Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the composite CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 catalyst. The particle size is large, on the order of a few microns, and individual layers of submicron thickness can be clearly seen. The BET surface area was measured at 1.0m2/g, consistent with the large particle size. The SEM images also show the presence of large aggregates on the surface of the particles, which may be absorbed CdS particles. The images also contain smaller dotlike structures on the surface, which are likely Ni/NiO islands. Fig. 7 shows the UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectra of both the starting K4Nb6O17 material and the CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 catalyst. The absorption edge is seen to stretch into the visible region, between 400 and 500nm, as expected for a visible light catalyst. Fig. 8 shows the results of the hydrogen evolution experiments. The order of catalytic activity was CdS/Ni/KNbO3 (k =23.5μmolH2 h−1) > CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 (k =7.3μmol H2 h−1) > CdS/K4Nb6O17 (k =2.8μmol H2 h−1) > CdS/Ni/H+/K4Nb6O17 (k =0.3μmol H2 h−1). Given the problems observed during the synthesis of the proton-exchanged catalyst, the low amount of hydrogen production from this material was not surprising. The increased activity with Ni doping is consistent with our earlier work on KNbO3 [9] and related reports by others [27–32]. Fig. 9 shows the DRIFT spectra of the starting K4Nb6O17 material, the two best-performing modified K4Nb6O17 catalysts, as well as a post-reaction catalyst that was recovered after a 24-h photolysis experiment. The appearance of a sharp peak in the two pre-photoreaction catalysts at 1110cm−1 is assigned to CdS. Post-photoreaction, this peak is seen to disappear, indicating the loss of all IR-active CdS indicating photo-corrosion. Fig. 10 shows XPS data for the Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states in CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 before and after photolysis. As in the case of CdS/Ni/KNbO3, two distinct forms of Cd are observed, and the ratio of the two changes after the photoreaction. Unlike the KNbO3 catalysts, however, there is a large loss of both Cd (70%) and S (45%) during the course of the photoreaction. This loss is consistent with a progress photo-corrosion as has been observed previously [33,34]. Given the disappearance of the CdS signal from the FTIR, the loss of much of the CdS is not surprising. However, it appears that some CdS still remains behind, as indicated by the presence of the higher-energy Cd peak that is present in both the pre- and post-reaction catalyst. It may be that this remaining CdS is in an IR inactive state or in too little amount to be detected; or, it is possible that indeed no CdS is left, and that the remaining sulfur is in the form of elemental sulfur. Unfortunately, the sulfur XPS signal was too weak to perform analysis of sulfur oxidation states. Another series of XPS experiments was performed to examine the effect of Ni doping on the subsequent CdS doping to the K4Nb6O17 catalyst. In comparison, 30% less CdS was seen on the CdS/Ni/K4Nb6O17 preparation compared to the CdS/K4Nb6O17 catalyst. Given that Ni likely competes with Cd for ion exchange sites, this result is not surprising, as many of the potential sites for Cd ion exchange were likely blocked by the prior Ni ion exchange."
9,Conclusions,"The niobium oxides KNbO3 and K4Nb6O17 can both be combined with nano-particulate CdS and Ni to produce H2 gas from water/ethanol solutions using visible light. The chemical environment of Ni, whether surface-bound or incorporated into the catalyst structure, has an effect on the Nb–O bonds. Ni doping increases the catalytic efficiency even though there is less overall CdS in the composite catalyst as compared to a non-Ni doped catalyst. During the course of the photoreactions, KNbO3 catalysts were seen to lose Cd ions, which were likely leeched from counter-ion sites in the niobate matrix. On the other hand, K4Nb6O17 catalysts were seen to lose a significant amount of CdS during photolysis. Loss of CdS is a significant problem for practical visible-light photo-catalysts. Novel methods for CdS implantation into the niobate catalyst matrix are needed to prevent the loss of photo-catalytic activity over time."
