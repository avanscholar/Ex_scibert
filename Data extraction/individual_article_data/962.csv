0,Introduction,"Extensive global effort is being made to explore renewable energy sources that could replace fossil fuels in mitigating global warming and other environmental issues. Hydrogen is a promising alternative fuel to conventional fossil fuels, because it releases energy explosively without air pollutants in combustion. Currently most of the hydrogen is produced through thermo-chemical processes via electricity generation from non-renewable fossil fuels. A major issue of conventional hydrogen production is sustainability. Hydrogen production via biological processes production is deemed a key development to a sustainable energy supply and a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Biohydrogen production is carried out largely at ambient temperatures and pressures, and hence is less energy intensive than chemical or electrochemical ones. As a desired green energy product of natural bioconversion, biohydrogen metabolism is primarily the domain of bacteria and microalgae. Within these microorganisms, it involves many taxonomically diverse species, a variety of enzymes and metabolic pathways and processes (Vignais et al., 2001). Biological processes use enzyme hydrogenase or nitrogenase as hydrogen producing protein. This enzyme regulates hydrogen-metabolism of prokaryotes and some eukaryotic organisms including green algae. The function of nitrogenase as well as hydrogenase is linked with the utilization of metabolic products of photosynthetic reactions that generate reductants from water. Earlier development of algal hydrogen production was focusing on biophotolysis and photosynthesis-hydrogen production using various microbial species. Subsequent development in dark fermentation or heterotrophic fermentation led to production of hydrogen under anaerobic environment without the need of light energy. Work has been conducted in improving algal photosynthetic capacity using molecular engineering approach. Encouraging work indicated that genetic engineering might offer a feasible approach in developing oxygen-tolerant algal mutant. Multi-stage bioreactor systems have been tested to tap the energy stored in metabolites and products in order to maximize hydrogen yield and productivity rate. This paves the way to making compact energy generators for large-scale applications. This review examines the perspectives and state-of-the-art of algal hydrogen research in the context of pathways of hydrogen metabolism, bioreactor design and operation and techno-economic considerations. Prospects and Challenges in algal hydrogen production are also outlined."
1,Pathways of hydrogen metabolism,"Biohydrogen can be generated by microorganisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria (or called blue-green algae) through biophotolysis, catabolism of endogenous substrate and dark fermentation by anaerobes. Biophotolysis occurs due to the effect of light on the microbial systems that results in dissociation of water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen. The light-dependent biophotolysis metabolic pathways can be differentiated into two distinct categories: direct-biophotolysis and indirect-biophotolysis. While electrons derived from water lead to photosynthetic hydrogen production in biophotolysis, electrons from catabolism of endogenous substrate result in hydrogen production in a distinct mechanism. Deriving energy from sunlight, green algae generate electrons for the photosynthetic systems through catabolism of endogenous substrate and the associated oxidative carbon metabolism in heterotrophic fermentation. On the other hand, dark fermentation by anaerobes as well as some microalgae, such as green algae on carbohydrate-rich substrates, can produce hydrogen via heterotrophic fermentation under anaerobic environment without the need of light energy."
2,Light-dependent pathways,"2.1 Light-dependent pathways 2.1.1 Direct biophotolysis Light-dependent direct biophotolysis occurs in two basic steps: splitting of water molecule in photosynthesis (Eq. (1) and hydrogen production catalyzed by hydrogenases (Eq. (2)) in green algae and cyanobacteria. (1) Photosynthesis: 2 H 2 O → 4 H + + 4 e - + O 2 (2) Hydrogen Production: 4 H + + 4 e - → 2 H 2 Direct biophotolysis involves water-oxidation and a light-dependent transfer of electrons to the [Fe]-hydrogenase, leading to the photosynthetic hydrogen production. Electrons are derived from water upon the photochemical oxidation by photosystem II (PSII or water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase) which is an enzyme located in the thylakoid membrane of algae and cyanobacteria. PSII uses photons from sunlight to energize electrons that are then transferred through the thylakoid membrane electron-transport chain and, via photosystem I (PSI or ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and ferredoxin (Fd), to the hydrocarbon cluster of [Fe]-hydrogenase (Florin et al., 2001). Plastoquinone is reduced to plastoquinol from the electrons transferred which are used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH or are used in cyclic photophosphorylation. The energized electrons are replaced by oxidizing water to form hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen as shown in Fig. 1 . By obtaining these electrons from water, PSII provides the electrons needed for the photosynthesis. The hydrogen ions (protons) generated by the oxidation of water help to create a proton gradient that is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP. Protons are the terminal acceptors of these photo-synthetically generated electrons in the algal chloroplast. The process results in simultaneous production of oxygen and hydrogen gases (Greenbaum et al., 1983). Direct biophotolysis capitalizes on the photosynthetic capability of microalgae and cyanobacteria to split water directly into oxygen and hydrogen. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, belong to a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. Microalgae have evolved the ability to harness solar energy by extracting protons and electrons from water via water–splitting reactions. The biohydrogen production takes place via direct absorption of light and transfer of electrons to two groups of enzymes – hydrogenases and nitrogenases (Manis and Banerjee, 2008). Under anaerobic conditions or when too much energy is captured in the process some microorganisms vent the excess electrons by using a hydrogenase enzyme which converts the hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas (Turner et al., 2008). It has been reported that the protons and electrons extracted via the water-splitting process are recombined by a chloroplast hydrogenase to form molecular hydrogen gas with a purity of up to 98% (Hankamer et al., 2007). The merit of direct biophotolysis is that the principal feed is water and the driver energy is derived from sunlight, both are readily available. While this technology has significant promise, it is also seeing tremendous challenges. A major challenge is the incompatibility in the simultaneous molecular hydrogen and oxygen production. In addition to producing hydrogen, the microorganisms also produce oxygen, which in turn suppresses hydrogen production (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Hence, photosynthetic hydrogen can only be produced transiently, as oxygen is a strong suppressor of hydrogenate reactions, and a powerful inhibitor of the [Fe]-hydrogenase. Research work has been carried out to engineer algae and bacteria so that the majority of the solar energy is diverted to hydrogen production, with bare energy diverted to carbohydrate production to solely maintain cells. Researchers are attempting to either, identify or engineer less oxygen sensitive microorganisms, isolate the hydrogen and oxygen cycles, or change the ratio of photosynthesis to respiration to prevent oxygen buildup (U.S. DOE, 2007). Addition of sulfate has been found to suppress oxygen production. However, the hydrogen production mechanisms are also inhibited (Turner et al., 2008). Methods to overcome the shortcomings of simultaneous production of oxygen and hydrogen will be further discussed in Section 5.1. 2.1.2 Indirect biophotolysis Other than direct biophotolysis, photosynthetic hydrogen can be produced through the use of green algae that can produce hydrogen under the condition of sulfur deprivation (Manis and Banerjee, 2008). Deprivation of sulfur-nutrients in the growth medium causes a reversible inhibition in the activity of oxygenic photosynthesis in green algae. Protein biosynthesis is impeded in the absence of sulfur, and the green algae are unable to perform the required turnover of the D1/32-kD reaction center protein of PSII (known as the psbA chloroplast gene product) in the thylakoid membrane of algae (Melis et al., 2000). Under sulfur deprivation, the photochemical activity of PSII declines, and the absolute activity of photosynthesis becomes less than that of respiration. As a result, the rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution drop below those of oxygen consumption by respiration. Such imbalance in the photosynthesis–respiration relationship by sulfur deprivation resulted in net consumption of oxygen by the cells causing anaerobic conditions in the growth medium. Consequently, anaerobic condition prevails in the sealed light-dependent algal cultures. With energy derived from light under deprivation of sulfur, the anaerobic algal cultures would elicit the [Fe]-hydrogenase pathway of electron transport in the chloroplast to photo-synthetically produce hydrogen (Melis et al., 2000). Fig. 2 Illustrates schematic representation of hydrogen production from indirect biophotolysis in comparison with direct biophotolysis. In essence, hydrogen can be produced under sulfur deprivation by circumventing the sensitivity of the [Fe]-hydrogenase to molecular oxygen through a temporal separation of the reactions of oxygen and hydrogen photoproduction. In the course of such hydrogen production condition (sulfur-deprivation), algal cells consumed significant amounts of internal starch and protein (Zhang et al., 2002). Such catabolic reactions apparently sustain the hydrogen production process indirectly. Photoproduction of hydrogen at a rate of about 12.5 mL H2/h per gram cell dry weight was reported in a study on indirect biophotolysis with cyanobacterium anabaena variabilis (Markov et al., 1997). In another study on indirect biophotolysis with Cyanobacterium gloeocapsa alpicola, it was found that maintaining the culture at pH value between 6.8 and 8.3 yielded optimal hydrogen production (Troshina et al., 2002). Increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 40 °C resulted in two-fold increase in the hydrogen production. The hydrogen production rate through indirect biophotolysis is comparable to hydrogenase-based hydrogen production by green algae. Hydrogen production via indirect biophotolysis by algae is deemed feasible if photon conversion can be improved for large-scale applications. The improvement of photosynthesis efficiency is too difficult to achieve for conventional crop plants (Hankamer et al., 2007). Algal bioreactor design can provide an engineering approach to regulating light inputs to the culture in improving the photon conversion of algal cell. Research has reported a substantial increase in light utilization efficiency of up to 15% comparing with the previous utilization of around 5% (Laurinavichene et al., 2008). Efficiency between 10% and 13% is attainable by engineering the microorganisms to better utilize the solar energy (Turner et al., 2008). Optical shortcomings associated with the chlorophyll antenna size and the light-saturation drawback of photosynthesis need to be addressed before high photosynthetic solar conversion efficiencies in mass culture can be achieved (Melis et al., 1999). Research is underway in improving further algal photosynthetic capacity using molecular engineering approach. Mutant algae with less chlorophyll could be manipulated for large scale commercial applications which disperse more light to deeper algae layers in the bioreactor (Hankamer et al., 2007; Beer et al., 2009). Hence sunlight is made available for more algal cells to generate hydrogen thus improving the production rate. Genetic manipulation or modification of the hydrogen producing microorganisms for improvement in hydrogen yield and production rate will be further elucidated in Section 5 Challenges and Prospects. Additional challenges associated with indirect biophotolysis that must be tackled include finding ways to recycle photobioreactor components and minimize the chemical cost of the nutrients to support algal growth, as these two items constitute 80–85% of the overall cost of a commercial hydrogen production (Show et al., 2011). 2.1.3 Photo fermentation It has been established that electrons are derived from water upon photochemical oxidation by PSII and are transferred to the [Fe]-hydrogenase leading to the photosynthetic hydrogen production in direct biophotolysis process. Apart from the above described PSII-dependent hydrogen production, there is another type of metabolic pathway, viz. the catabolic pathway in green algae that derives electrons from endogenous catabolism of substrate (Show et al., 2011). With energy from sunlight, green algae generate the electrons from complex organic molecules for the photosynthetic systems through the photo fermentation of endogenous substrate and the associated oxidative carbon metabolism. Electrons generated from such endogenous substrate catabolism flow into the PQ pool between photosystems PSI and PSII (Godde and Trebst, 1980). An NADPH-PQOR that has been ascertained in vascular plant chloroplasts supplies electrons to the PQ pool (Sazanov et al., 1998). Daylight assimilation by PSI and the associated electron transfer raise the redox potential of these electrons to the equivalent level of ferredoxin and the [Fe]-hydrogenase. Functioning as the terminal electron acceptor, the hydrogen ions (protons) would lead to the production of molecular hydrogen (Bennoun, 2001). It has been found that in the presence of the PSII inhibitors 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) which impedes photosynthetic electron flow from PSII to the PQ pool, the process generates molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a stoichiometric ratio of 2 to 1 (Bamberger et al., 1982). Thus, following a dark incubation of the culture under anaerobic conditions and the ensuing induction of the [Fe]-hydrogenase, considerable rates of hydrogen generation can be captured upon illumination of the algae in the presence of DCMU (Florin et al, 2001). Photo fermentation by purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) is a major field of research through which the overall yield for biological hydrogen production can be improved significantly by optimization of growth conditions and immobilization of active cells. Various processes of biohydrogen production using PNS bacteria along with several current developments had been examined. However, suitable process parameters such as carbon and nitrogen ratio, illumination intensity, bioreactor configuration and inoculum age may lead to higher yields of hydrogen generation using PNS bacteria (Basak and Das, 2007)."
3,Light-independent dark fermentation pathway,"2.2 Light-independent dark fermentation pathway Unlike photo fermentation where sunlight provides the energy for photosynthetic hydrogen production, dark fermentation or heterotrophic fermentation by anaerobes as well as some microalgae, such as green algae on carbohydrate-rich substrates, can produce hydrogen under anaerobic environment without the need of light energy (Zhang et al., 2006, 2007a–c; 2008a–c; Show et al., 2007, 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2016). The possibility with dark fermentative hydrogen production from algal biomass remains that hydrogen was produced by heterotrophic bacterial satellites present in the algal biomass slurries (Lakaniemi et al., 2011). It has been well established that there are four major stages in the production of methane and carbon dioxide from dark fermentation of organic matter. The first stage involves hydrolysis of long-chain complex organic compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to simpler molecules. In the second stage, the smaller-sized organic compounds undergo acidification through extracellular enzymes produced by fermentative bacteria. Acidogenesis occurs with the formation of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, acetate, organic acids and other organic intermediates. The third stage involves acetogenesis in which the organic acids produced in acidogenesis are converted to acetate and hydrogen. In addition, a proportion of the available hydrogen and carbon dioxide is converted to acetate by homoacetogenic bacteria. Hydrogen is produced in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis as an intermediate metabolite which in turn is used as an electron donor by methanogens at the final stage of the process. In the final stage, methanogenic bacteria reduce the carbon dioxide and the decarboxylate acetate to form methane. It might be feasible to harvest hydrogen at the acidogenesis and acetogenesis stages of anaerobic fermentation, leaving the remaining products for further methanogenic treatment. Therefore, it is possible that only acidogens and acetogens are left to produce hydrogen gas, CO2 and volatile fat acids (VFAs) if the final stage or methanogenesis and other hydrogen-consuming biochemical reactions are inhibited during the dark fermentation. This could be achieved through regulating biohydrogen cultures at a low pH and/or short hydraulic retention time conditions (Kim et al., 2004; Mizuno et al., 2000) or through inactivating hydrogen consumers by heat treatment (Logan et al., 2002) and chemical inhibitors (Wang et al., 2003). Formation of molecular hydrogen in dark fermentation is generally accomplished through two pathways in the presence of specific coenzymes (Show et al., 2011). One pathway is by formic acid decomposition route, and the other pathway is by the re-oxidization of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) route represented by: NADH + H + + 2 F d 2 + → 2 H + + NA D + + 2 F d + and 2 F d 2 + + 2 H + → 2 F d + + H 2 under the mediation of hydrogenase. The Embden-Meyerhof or glycolytic pathway (Fig. 3 ) is undoubtedly the most common route for glucose degradation to pyruvate which functions in the presence or absence of oxygen (Prescott et al., 2002). In this pathway, glucose is converted into pyruvate associated with the conversion of NADH from NAD+ via anaerobic glycolysis represented by: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 NA D + → 2 C H 3 COCOOH + 2 NADH + 2 H + The electron transfers via pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase or NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase could be affected by the corresponding NADH and acetyl-CoA levels or prevailing environmental conditions. Thus, the oxidation-reduction state has to be balanced through the NADH utilization to form several reduced compounds, i.e. lactate, ethanol and butanol, resulting in a lowered hydrogen yield. Theoretically, it is possible to harvest hydrogen at the acidogenesis stage of anaerobic fermentation, if only acidogens are left to produce hydrogen gas and other metabolites, and the final methanogenesis stage and other hydrogen-consuming biochemical reactions are inhibited during the dark fermentation. However, inhibition of hydrogen consuming microorganisms in complex microbial consortia decomposing algal biomass for hydrogen production poses a challenging task. It has been reported that the hydrogen produced from green algae C. vulgaris and D. tertiolecta biomass by anaerobic enriched cultures containing BESA was subsequently consumed by non-methanogenic microorganisms (Lakaniemi et al., 2011). Similar hydrogen utilization was also reported from the work on hydrogen production by anaerobic sludge fed with lipid-extracted Scenedesmus algal biomass (Yang et al., 2010). A novel approach of modeling continuous dark hydrogen fermentation was demonstrated using experimental data of a continuous reactor fed with food waste, and found to be capable of describing very well the variation in the distribution of metabolic products under different hydraulic retention times (Alexandropoulou et al., 2017). This modeling approach may be used for the description of other hydrogen producing systems in a robust and meaningful manner, which helps assess which metabolic pathways are active and to what extent they are taking place."
4,Considerations for bioreactor design and operation,"As biohydrogen metabolism is primarily the domain of microalgae, diatoms or cyanobacteria, the design of a bioreactor depends on microbiological processes associated with bacteria and microalgae (Show et al., 2008, 2011, 2012). While these photo-heterotrophic bacteria differ in photochemical efficiency, absorption coefficient and size, the light regime including light and dark cycles is assumed to be much more determining than biological factors (Akkerman et al., 2003). Hence the productivity of a photo bioreactor is light-dependent, and a large surface to volume ratio is a prerequisite for a productive photo bioreactor for optimal light exposure of the algae. Provisions for thermal control and monitoring of factors including flow rates, pH, and dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen are essential. Technical development is now moving towards devising gas-tight systems, engineered microalgae culturing as well as computer-controlled system for monitoring and automatic nutrient delivery and culture dilution (Show et al., 2012; Show and Lee, 2013a; 2013b)."
5,Bioreactor systems,"3.1 Bioreactor systems Appropriate configuration of the photobioreactor needs to be established for the most effective use of light and surface area. Biomass mixing is hence significant to ensure uniform dispersion of nutrients and light illumination in the culture, as well as to prevent agglomeration and sedimentation of algal biomass (Show et al., 2008, 2011). Modular design of experimental system should be allowed for possible scale-up. Such commercial scale should achieve sustainable gas output and high hydrogen yields with compact configuration. Trapping and withdrawal of hydrogen gas in the system are also important design considerations for photobioreactors. Given the current advancement in photo biohydrogen production, technical and economic strategies for cycling of the microalgae between sulfur-deprivation and supply must be developed (Laurinavichene et al., 2008). Different types of photobioreactors had been investigated in a study by Janssen (2002). Small-scale flat panel reactors consist of a rectangular transparent box were mixed with gas introduced via a perforated tube at the bottom of the reactor. In order to create a high degree of turbulence, 3–4 L of air per L of reactor volume per minute has to be provided. The panels were illuminated from one side by direct sunlight and the panels are placed vertically, or inclined towards the sun. Light/dark cycles were short in flat panel reactors, and this is probably the key factor leading to high photochemical efficiency. A disadvantage of flat panel reactors systems is that the power consumption of aeration (or mixing with another gas) is high, although mixing is always necessary in any reactor. The large-scale flat plate reactor consist of a rectangular air-lift photo bioreactor with a large number of light re-distributing plates fixed a few centimeters from each other. Mixing was provided by air injected between adjacent plates and the culture liquid will rise in between. Tubular photobioreactors consist of long transparent tubes with diameters ranging from 3 to 6 cm, and lengths ranging from 10 to 100 m (Janssen, 2002). The culture liquid is pumped through these tubes by means of mechanical or air-lift pumps. The tubes can be positioned in many different ways: in a horizontal plane as straight tubes with a small or large number of U-bends; vertical, coiled as a cylinder or a cone; in a vertical plane, positioned in a fence-like structure using U-bends or connected by manifolds; horizontal or inclined, parallel tubes connected by manifolds; in addition, horizontal tubes can be placed on different reflective surfaces with a certain distance between the tubes. Although tubular reactor design is rather diverse, the predominant effect of the specific designs on the light regime is a difference in the photon flux density incident on the reactor surface. The shape of the light gradient in the tubes is similar in most designs. Also with respect to liquid mixing, the circumstances in most designs are similar. The length of the tubes is limited because of accumulation of gas, though this might not be so important for nitrogenase based processes, since they may be less inhibited by hydrogen. The way to scale up is to connect a number of tubes via manifolds. Flat panel reactors normally show a high photochemical efficiency or biomass yield on light energy, while biomass density is also high. Tubular bioreactors in theory should show better efficiencies because of the shorter average light/dark cycles. While much of the research work have been focusing on single-stage photobioreactor systems, multi-stage bioreactors entail multiple bioreactors in biohydrogen production have also been examined (U.S. DOE, 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Show et al., 2011). Using a sequential microaerobic dark- and photo-fermentative process with immobilized culture, remarkable hydrogen yield (7.8 mol H2/mol glucose) and hydrogen production (21 mmol H2/L) have been reported (Sagir et al., 2017). A 4-stage bioreactors (Fig. 4 ) was reported in maximizing the hydrogen production and energy recovery (Show and Lee, 2013a). Sunlight is first filtered through the first-stage direct biophotolysis in which visible light is utilized by blue-green algae, and the unfiltered infrared ray is used by photo-synthetic microbes in the second-stage photo-fermentative reactor. The effluent from the second-stage photo-fermentation together with the biomass feedstock is fed into a third-stage dark fermentation reactor where the microorganisms convert the substrate into hydrogen and organic acids. As the effluent is enriched with organic acids, a supply of external organic acids for the photo-fermentative process can be eliminated. The forth-stage involves the use of a microbial electrolysis cell to convert the organic acids generated from the dark fermentation into hydrogen under light-independent process. It thus can be operated during the night or low light condition. The increasing attention on hythane has led to the research interest in hydrogen production by dark fermentation of biomass in hybrid or multi-stage bioreactors. Hythane, being a mixture of hydrogen and methane, is a highly efficient and ultra clean burning alternative fuel which is probably the most promising biogas for industrial applications (Cavinato et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2016). There are issues to be addressed before multi-stage bioreactors can be put to practical applications. Integration of multiple biochemical conversion processes poses significant challenges for multi-stage reactor engineering, system design, process control, operation and maintenance. Major challenges with the simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen from photolytic hydrogen production include respiration to photosynthetic capacity ratio, co-culture balance, and concentration and processing of cell biomass (Holladay et al., 2009)."
6,Regulation of sunlight,"3.2 Regulation of sunlight Photosynthetic light conversion efficiencies are low and tend to decrease at higher light intensities because of light saturation effect (Akkerman et al., 2003). The rate of photon absorption by the chlorophyll antenna of the upper layers of algal biomass far exceeds the rate at which photosynthesis can consume under high solar intensities. As algae have an intrinsic tendency to accumulate large assembly of photon-absorbing chlorophyll antenna molecules as a survival strategy, the over-absorption of light by the chlorophyll antenna results in loss of excess photon as heat or other rays. Cells at the upper layers of the algal mass are subject to severe photo-inhibition of photosynthesis due to the high rate of photon absorption (Melis, 1999). Photobioreactors can be designed to regulate light to the algal culture in order to improve its photon conversion efficiency. Planar waveguides doped with light scattering nanoparticles were introduced into a flat-plate photobioreactor to redistribute the incident light more uniformly within the algal suspension (Sun et al., 2016). Illumination surface area per unit volume was increased by 10.3 times, resulting in a 220% improvement in algal biomass production. Multiphysics model simulations demonstrated that biomass productivity improves with increased gas flow rate due to better light inputs to microorganisms (Gao et al., 2017). A substantial increase in light utilization efficiency of up to 15% has been reported (Laurinavichene et al., 2008). Conversion efficiency between 10% and 13% is feasible using engineered microbial culture to better utilize the solar energy (Turner et al., 2008). However, improvements must be made to the solar conversion efficiency of the algae for commercial purposes. Critical issues such as the optical shortcomings associated with the chlorophyll antenna size and the light-saturation of photosynthesis must be addressed under mass culture conditions (Melis et al., 1999). Technological advancement addressing these issues is discussed in Section 5 Challenges and Prospects."
7,Metabolic and genetic engineering,"3.3 Metabolic and genetic engineering Although biohydrogen production is considered a possible alternative energy vector, substantial improvements are required to overcome its present low yields. Genetic manipulation or modification of the hydrogen producing microorganism would probably play a vital role. Research is underway in improving further algal photosynthetic capacity using molecular engineering approach, whereas algal strains have been manipulated to increase hydrogen production (Hankamer et al., 2007). Several algae mutant strains related to indirect biophotolysis biohydrogen production have been isolated, for example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain can increase biohydrogen production under high starch condition (Hankamer et al., 2007). It has been reported that an algae mutant with a truncated chlorophyll antenna size of the photosystems in the chloroplast of the microalgae could alleviate the optical shortcomings associated with a fully pigmented chlorophyll antenna (Melis et al., 1999). The work on the truncated chlorophyll antenna size in maximizing solar conversion efficiencies will be delineated in Section 5. Mutant algae with less chlorophyll were cultured which are able to distribute more sunlight to deeper layers in the algal biomass for large-scale applications (Hankamer et al., 2007). In this manner, sunlight is made available for more algal cells to generate hydrogen. Hence for efficient photoproduction of hydrogen, it is critical to dilute the light and distribute it over the entire reactor volume, and mix the culture at high rates, so that cells are exposed to the light only for a short time. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) or flux balance analysis constitutes an important tool to guide a priori most suitable genetic modifications oriented to a hydrogen yield increase, as well as providing valuable information for optimization and design of the fermentative hydrogen production process. MFA has been applied to analyze hydrogen photoproduction of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Navarro et al., 2009). Flux balance analysis was carried out based on literature data and several basic fluxes were estimated in different growing conditions of the system. From the analysis, an upper limit for hydrogen photoproduction was determined indicating a wide margin for improvement. MFA was also used in the study to find a feasible operating space for hydrogen production, which avoids oxygen inhibition, one of the most important limitations to make hydrogen production cost effective. In addition, a set of biotechnological strategies were proposed that would be consistent with the performed mathematical analysis. Anaerobic glucose metabolism and hydrogen production pathway were studied using batch cultivation of isolated chemoheterotrophic bacterium Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19 and an in silico MFA (Oh et al., 2008). Batch cultivation was conducted under varying initial glucose concentration between 1.5 and 9.5 g/L with quantitative measurement of major metabolites to obtain accurate carbon material balance. The metabolic flux of Y19 was analyzed using a metabolic-pathway model which was constructed from 81 biochemical reactions. The linear optimization program MetaFluxNet was employed for the analysis. When the specific growth rate of cells was chosen as an objective function, the model described the batch culture characteristics of Ci. amalonaticus Y19 reasonably well. When the specific H2 production rate was selected as an objective function, on the other hand, the achievable maximal H2 production yield at 8.7 mol H2/mol glucose and the metabolic pathway enabling the high H2 yield were identified. The pathway involved non-active NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase and H2 production from NAD(P)H which were supplied at a high rate from glucose degradation through the pentose phosphate pathway. In order to improve the H2 production rate and yield, metabolically engineered E. coli strains, which included pathway alterations in their H2 production and central carbon metabolism, were developed and characterized by batch experiments and MFA (Kim et al., 2009). Escherichia coli can produce H2 from glucose via formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). Deletion of hycA, a negative regulator for FHL, resulted in twofold increase of FHL activity. Deletion of two uptake hydrogenases (1 (hya) and hydrogenase 2 (hyb)) increased H2 production yield from 1.20 mol/mol glucose to 1.48 mol/mol glucose. Deletion of lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) and fumarate reductase (frdAB) further improved the H2 yield; 1.80 mol/mol glucose under high H2 pressure or 2.11 mol/mol glucose under reduced H2 pressure. Several batch experiments at varying concentrations of glucose (2.5–10 g/L) and yeast extract (0.3 or 3.0 g/L) were conducted for the strain containing all these genetic alternations, and their carbon and energy balances were analyzed. The MFA revealed that deletion of ldhA and frdAB directed most of the carbons from glucose to the glycolytic pathway leading to H2 production by FHL, not to the pentose phosphate pathway. A metabolic model was constructed in matrix formalism for the hydrogen production by the purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides involving 183 reactions and 153 metabolites (Pasika et al., 2011). Assuming pseudo-steady state, mass balances were performed for each metabolite and the resulting equations were solved using optimization. The objective function was the maximization of hydrogen production. The comparison of experimental and computational results indicated the importance of light in hydrogen production. MFA method was used to estimate the effects of the culture conditions on both the producing and uptake hydrogen flux inside the cell of Klebsiella pneumoniae ECU-15 (Niu et al., 2011). The results indicated that higher temperature could reduce the amount of the uptake hydrogen and enhance the hydrogen production from the NADH pathway. Moreover, both the producing hydrogen flux from formate and the uptake hydrogen flux were attained to the maximum at pH 7.0–7.5. The producing hydrogen flux was higher at 5 g/L initial glucose than that of the other concentrations, and the uptake hydrogen flux showed the minimum value under the same condition. The apparent hydrogen generation was caused by the combined action of producing hydrogenase, uptake hydrogenase and bidirectional hydrogenase. These results were helpful to deeply understand the mechanism of the biohydrogen evolving process and establish the suitable molecular strategies for improving hydrogen production. There is a lack of information related to metabolic flux distribution and its variation with respect to fermentation conditions in the metabolic fermentative hydrogen production system by strict anaerobes. A study aimed at deriving a better understanding of the metabolic network via MFA of fermentative hydrogen production by an isolated Clostridium butyricum strain W5 was conducted (Cai et al., 2010). Specific growth rate was chosen as the objective function and specific H2 production rate was used as the criterion to evaluate the experimental results with the in silico MFA. An in silico metabolic flux model was constructed for the anaerobic glucose metabolism of C. butyricum W5 with assistance of a modeling program MetaFluxNet. The model was used to evaluate the metabolic flux distribution in the fermentative hydrogen production network, and to study the fractional flux response to variations in initial glucose concentration and operational pH. The MFA results suggested that pH has a more significant effect on hydrogen production yield compared to the glucose concentration. MFA has been applied to hydrogen production using growth of Escherichia coli on glucose (Manish et al., 2007). Flux analysis was carried out on experimental data from literature. Hydrogen production using parent strain was 0.17 mol per mol of glucose consumed. It increased to 0.23 mol for the strain lacking lactate dehydrogenase. MFA was also used to determine feasible operating space for hydrogen production against the varying yields of other metabolites. It was found that production of ethanol and acetate is necessary for hydrogen production, while production of succinate and lactate is not necessary."
8,Techno-economic analysis,"Algal hydrogen production facility and its operation must be cost-effective for full-scale applications. Detailed cost analyses have to be conducted on minimizing the materials and operating costs, and also for optimizing the yield and gas collection. While there are many reports in the literature about biohydrogen production, only a handful of them are dealing with the economic analyses of the biohydrogen production. Critical parameters in the cost analyses include the light environment, the climate and land space, reactor construction materials, mechanism of culture mixing, reactor maintenance and long-term operational stability with maximal gas production (Show et al., 2012). The commercial cost target for hydrogen production is 0.30 USD/kg H2, corresponding to an energy price for gasoline of 2.5 USD/GJ in a competitive market (IEA, 2006). For viable biohydrogen applications, the production cost must be more competitive than the market prices. An initial cost for an indirect algal biophotolysis system consisting of 140 ha-open ponds and 14 ha-photobioreactors was estimated (Benemann, 1997a). The plant was assumed to generate 1.2 million GJ/yr at 90% capacity, with estimated total capital costs at US$ 43 million and annual operating costs at US$12 million. Overall total hydrogen production costs were estimated at US$10/GJ. The capital costs were almost 90% of total costs at a 25% annual capital charge (Akkerman et al., 2003). The algal ponds were estimated at a cost of US$6/m2, while the photobioreactors with assumed costs of US$100/m2 were the major capital and operating cost consideration. The costs of gas handling were not estimated but were presumed a significant cost factor. An initial cost for a large-scale (>100 ha) single-stage algal or cyanobacterial biophotolysis process in a near-horizontal tubular reactor system was analyzed (Tredici and Zittelli, 1998). The main objective of the analysis was to determine if the proposed photobioreactor design could meet the cost requirements for hydrogen production through single-stage biophotolysis. The tubular photobioreactor offers superior features for biohydrogen production due to the internal gas exchange and the effective water spray cooling. Based on 10% solar energy conversion efficiency, the costs of the tubular photobioreactor were estimated at US$50/m2. The analysis did not include costs for gas handling and assumed a relatively low annual capital charge at 17%. The capital fixed costs were estimated at 80% of total costs, with the tubular material for the photobioreactor as the major cost. The hydrogen production costs were estimated at US$15/GJ, which are comparable to the costs projected for hydrogen produced in a two-stage process from biomass residues projected at Euro 19/GJ (Tredici and Zittelli, 1998). An estimated hydrogen production of 80 kg/acre.d or 20 kg/1000 m2.d on commercial scale assuming that the entire capacity of the photosynthesis of the algae could be diverted toward hydrogen production (Melis and Happe, 2001). Based on a realistic 50% capacity, the cost of producing hydrogen comes close to US$2.80/kg. The authors claimed that the biohydrogen thus generated could compete with gasoline at this price, assuming 1 kg of hydrogen is equivalent to a gallon of gasoline. Currently, less than 10% of the algae photosynthetic capacity was utilized for biohydrogen production. A scale-up modular pilot photobioreactor was operated on site over a six-month period for assessment of economic and reactor performance (Show et al., 2012). From the distribution among the various cost inventories derived from the field operation, the costs of materials and nutrients turned out to be the major expenses (84%). A construction cost of $0.75/m2 was established, which was considerably lower than the range of $20/m2–$100/m2 commonly quoted (Zaborsky, 1998). While the economic analysis probably reflects a simplified strip-down bare design, it does provide an indication on the relative cost of the various components such as materials, nutrients, labor, water use, land lease, power and others that are necessary and sufficient to assemble a commercially viable photobioreactor. The analysis also indicated that, in order to substantially lower the cost of the overall operation, effort should be directed towards the recycling and reuse of photobioreactor construction materials and growth nutrients. The above economic analyses indicated that biohydrogen could be produced at a cost between US$10/GJ and US$20/GJ (Akkerman et al., 2003). This is a reasonable maximal cost target for renewable hydrogen fuel according to Benemann (2000). It should be noted that the economic analyses were based on optimistic assumptions and are highly presumptive, and were intended predominantly to ascertain the major cost drivers for photobiological hydrogen production. At the present development, biologically produced hydrogen is more costly than other fuel alternatives (Show et al., 2012). Before economic barriers can be meaningfully addressed, many technical and engineering issues have to be tackled. Nevertheless, the above economic analyses provide a direction that the development of low cost photobioreactors and the optimization of photosynthetic efficiency are the major R&D challenges."

10,Shortcomings of biohydrogen production,"5.1 Shortcomings of biohydrogen production Doubts have been raised on viability of algal hydrogen production via direct biophotolysis for practical applications. A major drawback of the process is that along with hydrogen, there is simultaneous production of oxygen. The key enzyme hydrogenase catalyzing hydrogen production reaction of the algae is sensitive to oxygen; hence, the oxygen evolved has an inhibitory action on hydrogen production, resulting in generally less than 1.5% conversion efficiency from solar light energy to hydrogen energy (Laurinavichene et al., 2008). The efficiency can, however, be increased to 3–10% if the oxygen produced is immediately removed from the system. Genetic engineering methods may also prove useful to overcome oxygen inhibition of hydrogenase, which will be further discussed in Section 5.2. In order to address the problem of oxygen inhibition of hydrogen production, a system is needed, wherein the two phases involving biological production of hydrogen and oxygen are separated in space or time. In spatial separation method, the oxygen and hydrogen producing process of microalgae are spatially separated (Benemann, 1997b). In the first stage, open ponds were used in which the microalgae fixed atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis into carbohydrates and evolved oxygen in the process. In a second phase, dark and anaerobic conditions were maintained using closed bioreactors, where the carbohydrates were degraded to acetic acid and subsequently into hydrogen in the present of sunlight. It was proposed that the algae could be reused after allowing them to grow again by transferring them to open ponds. The temporal separation method was developed using the green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Temporal separation of oxygen producing and hydrogen producing processes was achieved by altering the two phases over time. The first phase of photosynthetic oxygen evolution along with carbohydrate storage was followed by a second phase in which the growth medium was deprived of sulfur that led to blocking of photosynthesis and thus oxygen evolution (Melis et al., 2000). This facilitated hydrogenase activity in the alga cells and favored production of hydrogen. While indirect biophotolysis hydrogen production technology has significant promise, some crucial challenges are to be addressed. Given that hydrogen production by sulfur deprivation is time limited, a major challenge is to maintain a stable hydrogen production for practical uses. Hydrogenase is too oxygen-labile for sustainable hydrogen production. Light-dependent hydrogen production ceases within a few days since photosynthetically produced oxygen inhibits or inactivates hydrogenases. Substantial rates of hydrogen production were steadily sustained initially for about 60 h in the light, but the yield begins to level off gradually thereafter (Zhang et al., 2002). After about 100 h of sulfur deprivation, the algae need to go back to normal photosynthesis in order to be rejuvenated by replenishing endogenous substrate (Ghirardi et al., 2000). Improvements must be made to maintain the process continuity for commercial applications. Although it has been established that hydrogen can be produced from endogenous substrate catabolism in photo fermentation, the mechanisms entailed are yet to be fully understood. As rates of water oxidation by the photosynthetic systems can be determined precisely, the electron transport by endogenous substrate catabolism and NADPH-PQOR activity are hard to measure (Show et al., 2012). Research on hydrogen production from anaerobically incubated and DCMU-inhibited chloroplasts suggested that sizeable rates of hydrogen production can be detected only in the initial incubation period (Florin et al., 2001). In other words, the hydrogen production via endogenous substrate catabolism is not a sustainable process (Zhang et al., 2002). This observation may suggest a limitation in the capacity of the electron transport and the attendant NADPH-PQOR activity. Nevertheless, the prospect of hydrogen production with endogenous substrate catabolism is important and should warrant further research to fully tap its potential. Application of molecular bioengineering might help to increase the capacity of this important process. For hydrogen produced from dark fermentation to be used alone in an internal combustion engine or a fuel cell, some issues such as biohydrogen purification, storage and transport are to be addressed. Unlike a biophotolysis process that produces only hydrogen, the gaseous product of dark fermentation is a mixture of primary hydrogen (generally less than 70%) and CO2, but may also contain other gases such as CH4, H2S, ammonia and/or moisture. Purification of the hydrogen is essential before the hydrogen utilization can be practical (Show et al., 2011, 2012). Nevertheless, hydrogen production by dark fermentation is an attractive process in the sense that it does not demand large land space and is not affected by weather condition (solar radiation is not a requirement). Also, among the biohydrogen production processes, dark fermentation is deemed to be more favourable. Hydrogen is yielded at a high rate and various organic compounds and wastewaters enriched with carbohydrates as the substrate results in low cost hydrogen production (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Levin and Chahine, 2010). Hence, the feasibility of the technology yields a growing commercial value. Since biohydrogen was first reported in the late 1930s (Gaffron, 1939), research in biohydrogen production remains at a very early stage of development and have, so far, obtained only low conversion efficiencies. There is a need for major breakthroughs in process efficiencies, reliability, operating flexibility as well as reduction in CAPEX and OPEX. In essence, the future of algal hydrogen production depends not only on research advances, viz. improvement in efficiency through genetically engineered microorganisms and/or the development of bioreactors, but also on economic considerations, social acceptance, and the development of hydrogen energy systems."
11,Molecular bioengineering,"5.2 Molecular bioengineering Biological processes of hydrogen production have so far obtained only low conversion efficiencies. Low hydrogen yield and production rate are two major challenges for practical application of biohydrogen production. Research is underway in improving further algal photosynthetic capacity using molecular engineering approach. Advancement in molecular bioengineering also indicates that genetic engineering might offer a feasible approach in developing oxygen-tolerant algal mutant. Genetic manipulation or modification of the hydrogen producing microorganisms may play a vital role in tackling the problem of low yields (Hankamer et al., 2007). Improvements in hydrogen yields by existing pathways has been attempted by increasing the flux through gene knockouts of competing pathways or increased homologous expression of enzymes involved in the hydrogen-generating pathways (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Several algal strains related to biohydrogen production have been isolated and manipulated, for example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain which can increase hydrogen production under high starch condition (Hankamer et al., 2007). Mutant algae with less chlorophyll were manipulated for large scale commercial applications which allow more sunlight penetrating into deeper algae layers beneath water surface in the bioreactor. Hence sunlight is made available for more algal cells to generate hydrogen thus improving the production rate. While metabolic flux analysis has been used to guide a priori most suitable genetic modifications oriented to a hydrogen yield increase for fermentative hydrogen production process (Show et al., 2012), the flux balance analysis may also offer a useful tool to provide valuable information for optimization and design of photosynthetic hydrogen production process. It has been reported that a truncated chlorophyll antenna size of the photosystems in the chloroplast of the microalgae could alleviate the optical shortcomings and light saturation effect associated with a fully pigmented chlorophyll antenna (Show et al., 2012). With the genetically manipulated algal cells, the drawback of over-absorption of photon by the photosystems can be minimized. A truncated chlorophyll antenna will reduce the loss of energy by the cells, and it will also dampen down photo-inhibition of photosynthesis at the surface of the culture. Moreover, a truncated chlorophyll antenna size will alleviate the problem of light attenuation and mutual cell shading by permitting a more consistent illumination to the entire algal biomass. Such altered optical properties of the cells would result in much greater photosynthetic productivity and better solar utilization efficiency in the culture. Experiments have shown that a smaller chlorophyll antenna size would bring about a higher light intensity for the saturation of photosynthesis in individual algal cells but, with an associated three-fold improved productivity of the culture (Melis et al., 1999). Excitation pressure was used as a bioengineering tool in the work to culture green algae with a truncated chlorophyll antenna size. The studies concluded that green algae with a truncated chlorophyll antenna size are essential in augmenting photosynthetic efficiencies and the hydrogen yield under mass culture conditions. Manipulation of the chlorophyll antenna size in response to light is essentially an inherent reaction of the chloroplast as they are inversely related to the incident light. In principle, it is possible to genetically manipulate the relevant regulatory mechanism in the photosystems, and in transforming green algae to direct the chloroplast biosynthetic and assembly activities toward a permanently truncated chlorophyll antenna size (Show et al., 2012). At this moment, the acceptability of genetically modified microorganisms is another challenge, since the possible risk of horizontal transference of genetic material. However, this can be ruled out by chromosomal integration and the elimination of plasmids containing antibiotic markers with available molecular tools (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). Moreover, the improvement of hydrogen production by gene manipulation is mainly focused on the disruption of endogenous genes and not introducing new activities in the microorganisms. Hydrogen production from biophotolysis has the potential to be the cleanest and most direct energy conversion process. Direct biophotolysis, albeit limited by its low hydrogen production, provides a feasible scheme for hydrogen production from water and sunlight. Technology advancement and innovations in enzymes, electron carriers, biomaterials and genetic engineering may lead to a practical biophotolysis system that overcomes the intrinsic oxygen inhibition shortcoming (Show and Lee, 2013a). Hydrogen production via indirect biophotolysis remains far behind the productivity rates of other biofuels."
12,Energy balance,"5.3 Energy balance The low energy productivity of biohydrogen can be improved if the energy stored in fermentative products is reused. During the dark fermentation, carbohydrates are converted into hydrogen gas, and volatile fatty acids and alcohols which are organic pollutants and energy carriers. For the purpose of energy recovery and protection of the water bodies, a second stage process is necessary to recover the energy residues remaining in the effluent in the form of fatty acids and alcohols. Thus the fermentative reactor becomes part of a process wherein the effluent post-treatment process and hydrogen utilization should also be included. Possible second-stage process is photo-fermentation, anaerobic digestion, or microbial fuel cells, which has been reviewed recently (Show and Lee, 2013a,b; Silva et al., 2016). A multi-stage bioreactor system consisting of four different reactors operated in series mode has been investigated (Fig. 4). A microbial electrolysis cell is incorporated into the system to convert the organic acids generated from the dark fermentation into hydrogen under light-independent process (Show et al., 2012). The hydrogen yield and productivity rate can therefore be significantly improved to make high compact energy generators for a future hydrogen economy. It has been reported that the dark fermentation pathway by Escherichia coli has high rates of H2 production but has limitations (Saratale et al., 2013). The irreversible dark fermentation is thermodynamically limited to 2–4 mol H2 per mol hexose, while hexose sugars can stoichiometrically deliver 12 mol H2 per mol hexose. The ‘NADH pathway’ of some microorganisms (Hallenbeck, 2017) can deliver a higher hydrogen yield, but is reversible under a positive hydrogen partial pressure, which is required for with a downstream hydrogen fuel cell. Sustained biohydrogen production in dark fermentation is limited by end-product (ethanol) toxicity and acidification of the medium by accumulating organic acids (Redwood et al., 2012). The organic acids produced during the dark fermentation, however, provide a means to overcome the thermodynamic limitation via their use in a coupled photofermentation reactor (Redwood et al., 2012; Hallenbeck, 2017) via electro dialysis. This continuous dual fermentation process combines high hydrogen production rates and yield; the electrical energy demand of electro dialysis is counterbalanced, in part, by a third hydrogen stream from electrolysis of water (Redwood et al., 2012). A study was conducted to compare the energy balance for crude glycerol utilization during dark fermentation for hydrogen production with glycerol purification for glycerol (Pachapur et al., 2018). The energy balance for each of the materials used during inoculum, media preparation steps and electricity consumed across both the methods was determined. The total energy input for glycerol purification (872 MJ) was 2.5-fold higher in comparison to maximum total energy input of vegetable feedstock derived crude glycerol (344 MJ). For efficient utilization of crude glycerol, bioconversion to hydrogen by dark fermentation can be considered an energy efficient and sustainable biofuel production option. The net energy (MJ) for different feedstocks (vegetable source 158.90, multi-feedstock 113.23 and animal waste 83.14) during hydrogen production varied with glycerol content. Performing dark fermentation at ambient conditions and utilization of electricity generated from biogas capture will surely reduce the total energy input. Thus, the net energy for different feedstocks will have a positive value. Redwood et al., (2012) calculated the break-even current efficiency to quantify the role played by specific organic acids for electro dialysis. It was deduced that the energy balance for biohydrogen via fermentation of food waste exceeded that from anaerobic digestion, wind and solar power, even without factoring in the additional electrochemically made hydrogen."
13,Conclusions,"Advancement in research and development has indicated a promising potential of algal biohydrogen production as a biofuel for the future, along with its ability to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and alleviate carbon emissions. The advent of hydrogen as a renewable energy will have important economic implications, and biohydrogen is going to play an important role in a future hydrogen economy. To leapfrog current advancement in biohydrogen research to the next level of achievement, the existing scientific and technological bottlenecks are to be overcome. The R&D gaps in the field of algal hydrogen production must therefore be tackled."
