0,Introduction,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of death due to liver injuries, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis [1]. Many studies on pathogenesis of ALD have focused on oxidative stress and glutathione depletion, abnormal methionine metabolism, malnutrition, and endotoxin production [2], and accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role in ALD [3]. Ethanol induces oxidative stress through various routes. These include mitochondrial damage, induction of CYP2E1, ethanol-induced activation of Kupffer cells, and depletion of mitochondrial and cytosolic glutathione. These routes are not mutually exclusive, and lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of oxidative stress [4]. Therefore, excessive consumption of ethanol induces the production of a variety of ROS, such as superoxide, H2O2, and hydroxyl radical in liver cells [5]. These products cause cellular injury through alteration of biomolecules or interference with the signaling cascades. Previous studies have shown the induction of hepatic apoptosis via mitochondrial dysfunction and liver injury through alcohol-induced ROS generated during ethanol metabolism [6]. Furthermore, some investigators demonstrated that alcohol consumption stimulates the inflammatory responses by activating NF-κB and MAPK in the liver cells [7], and these alterations are caused as a result of ROS production [8,9]. Because high oxidative stress is closely related with ALD, a number of studies have investigated the benefits of antioxidants to protect the liver from ALD. Silymarin, vitamin E, and N-acetylcysteine are representative antioxidants that have been studied in relation to liver health [10–12]. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the ester of caffeic acid and quinic acid [13], and many dietary plants such as coffee, tea, and some fruits and vegetables contain CGA. Recent studies have shown that the consumption of CGA has health benefits, such as reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 2, and Alzheimer's disease. It also has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and exhibits hepatoprotective effects against acetaminophen toxicity [14,15]. However, the antioxidant property and protective effect of CGA with respect to ALD have not been studied. We hypothesized that CGA plays a role in preventing ALD because of its antioxidant properties. We demonstrated the protective effect of CGA against liver injuries in an ALD model. Reduced alcohol-induced steatosis, apoptotic cell death, and fibrosis due to reduced levels of oxidative stress were observed. These findings suggest that CGA can be used to attenuate ALD through the suppression of oxidative stress."

3,Animals,"2.2 Animals Animal studies were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at the Animal Facility of the University Laboratory Animal Resources, Kyungpook National University. Mice with C57BL/6 genetic background were used in this study. The animals were bred under a constant temperature of 22 °C with 12 h light/dark cycles. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice, weighing approximately 21–24 g, were used for the experiments and segregated into 4 groups, with 8–10 mice per group (+vehicle, +CGA, +alcohol, and +alcohol/CGA). CGA (10–40 mg/kg per dose) was injected into mice orally every 30 min after alcohol exposure (3 g/kg per dose) for 7 consecutive days. Equal quantities of sterilized normal saline were injected into control mice on the same schedule. Animals were sacrificed a day after last injection."
4,Preparation of liver tissue,"2.3 Preparation of liver tissue Liver tissues were harvested, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and embedded in paraffin. Then, tissues were sectioned (3 μm thick), deparaffinized, rehydrated, and used for staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. For antigen retrieval, the slides were submerged in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and heated to 121 °C for 10 min. Some of the harvested tissues were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, embedded in O.C.T. compound, and frozen. Frozen tissues were sectioned at 5 μm thickness."
5,Isolation and culture of primary hepatocytes,"2.4 Isolation and culture of primary hepatocytes Primary hepatocytes were isolated as previously described [16]. Isolated primary hepatocytes were suspended in William's E Medium (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with primary hepatocyte maintenance supplements (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and 5% FBS, were seeded on chamber slides coated with 0.1% rat tail collagen, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 12 h, primary hepatocytes were treated with or without CGA (200 μM, pH 7.4) and ethanol (200 mM). The slides were analyzed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope or a Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope."

GAPDH was used as an internal control. The PCR products were separated on 1.5–2% agarose gels with 0.01% EcoDye™ DNA staining solution (SolGent, Daejeon, South Korea), and the bands were visualized. The band intensities of RT-PCR were quantified using ImageJ software after color inversion of the image."
7,"ALT, AST and triglyceride assays","2.6 ALT, AST and triglyceride assays Mice blood was obtained and transferred to separate container and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, serum was collected and placed in fresh tubes. Serum ALT and AST and triglycerides were determined by using assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Liver tissue was saponified and neutralized as described previously [17]."
8,Measurement of redox status,"2.7 Measurement of redox status The levels of intracellular peroxide were measured using 3,3-diaminobenzidine-HCl (DAB). Liver tissue, which were frozen and sectioned (5 μm thick), were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing glucose (1 mg/ml) and DAB (1 mg/ml). The tissue slides were washed with normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and counterstained with hematoxylin. DAB stained tissues were analyzed under an Axiovert 40 CFL microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Protein oxidation and the level of 4-HNE were assessed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Prx-SO3 antibody and anti-4-HNE antibody, respectively. Total glutathione was measured by the rate of formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm (ε = 1.36 × 104 M−1cm−1). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was determined by the 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid)-GSSG reductase recycling assay after treatment of 2-vinylpyridine to GSH [18,19]. NADPH level was measured by immunofluorescence staining using anti-NADPH antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody on paraffin-sectioned liver tissue and analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123 and JC-1 with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Mitochondrial ROS and morphology was visualized by using mitoSOX and MitoTracker, respectively. The images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope."
9,Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence,"2.8 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence Cryosectioned tissues (5 μm thick) were used to assess lipid content in tissue by Oil Red O staining. Tissue slides were stained with Oil Red O solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 65 °C. The slides were covered with gelatin and analyzed by Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Paraffin-embedded sections of liver were incubated in dry oven at 60 °C and rehydrated. The slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, toluidine blue, and Sirius red to observe morphology, mast cell infiltration, and collagen content, respectively, in the liver. To evaluate apoptosis, colon tissue sections were used for TUNEL staining using the in situ cell-death detection kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For Immunofluorescence, paraffin-sectioned (3 μm thick) tissues were incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS (3 times), and incubated with an Alexa488-or Alexa555-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The tissues were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), treated with an anti-photo bleaching reagent, and sealed with cover glass. Images were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope."
10,Measurement of ROS scavenging effects of CGA,"2.9 Measurement of ROS scavenging effects of CGA The ability to scavenge ROS was indirectly determined by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes susceptible to ROS, such as mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [20,21]. In a total volume of 1 ml, containing 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mM NADP+, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM isocitrate and IDH2 (6.5 μg) were added. IDH2 was treated with either 2 mM ascorbate/6 μM Cu, 5 mM H2O2, 10 mM KO2, or 50 μM MB/light for 1 h. Activity of IDH2 was measured by the production of NADPH at 340 nm at 25 °C. One unit of ICDH activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzed to produce 1 μmol of NADPH/min. SOD activity in tissue extracts was measured spectrophotometrically by the pyrogallol assay [21], where one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to reduce the superoxide-dependent color change."
11,Immunoblot analysis,"2.10 Immunoblot analysis Proteins in the liver tissue extract were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK)."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed at least three times. Results are shown as mean ± SD. Two-tailed t-test was used to determine statistical significance, and values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant."
13,Result and discussion,"To observe the protective effect of CGA against alcohol-induced liver injuries, the serum levels of the biomarkers, ALT and AST, were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, ALT and AST levels were higher in the ethanol-treated group than in the vehicle group. When mice were injected with 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg of CGA, the dose-dependent attenuation of ALT and AST activities was observed in the CGA-treated sera compared to that in the alcohol only group. The subsequent experiments were conducted with 20 mg/kg of CGA because this dose was sufficient to elicit biological effects in vivo. Liver damage and accumulation of lipid droplets were observed in mice fed ethanol. Therefore, concentration of serum and hepatic triglycerides were measured and found to be increased in ethanol-fed mice, and these increased levels of serum and hepatic triglycerides were reduced by CGA treatment. Histological analysis by Oil Red O staining for lipid droplets confirmed that ethanol consumption increased fat accumulation. However, CGA treatment drastically attenuated alcohol-induced fat accumulation (Fig. 1B and C). To determine the histological alterations in the liver induced by CGA administration and alcohol consumption, we performed sectioning of frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Liver sections were analyzed by H&E staining (Fig. 1D). Previously, a slight increase in mast cell numbers in alcoholic hepatitis and alcohol-induced liver fibrosis has been observed. In particular, in established cirrhosis with associated alcoholic hepatitis, increased mast cells may play a role in the development of liver fibrosis [22]. Toluidine blue staining clearly revealed a significant attenuation of elevated mast cell numbers in CGA-treated liver compared with that in the alcohol only group (Fig. 1E). Sirius Red staining of sections of liver tissue for the assessment of collagen content, which is increased in hepatic fibrosis, revealed that the CGA treatment attenuated progression of fibrosis (Fig. 1F). Collectively, our results indicated that alcohol intake increases hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and progression of fibrosis, and these effects were significantly attenuated by CGA. As a key transcription factor in triglyceride synthesis, SREBP1 controls the transcription and expression of lipogenic enzymes and its target gene FAS, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in lipogenesis. Fluorescence microscopy revealed increased expression of lipogenic genes following alcohol treatment (Fig. 2 A), and these effects were abrogated by CGA treatment. In agreement with the data in Fig. 2A, mRNA levels of the lipogenic genes decreased following CGA treatment even after ethanol consumption (Fig. 2B). TNF-α is known to increase intrahepatic fat deposition by upregulating SREBP-1 and FAS in vivo [23]. CGA inhibited TNF-α upregulation in ethanol-fed mice (Fig. 2C). Thus, CGA attenuates steatosis by reducing the level of TNF-α in liver, thereby reducing the expression of SREBP-1 and FAS. In previous results, we observed elevated collagen content in the livers of ethanol-fed mice, and CGA treatment prevented this elevation. As representative fibrosis markers, the levels of α-SMA and TGF-β mRNA in liver tissues were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2D, CGA treatment decreased mRNA levels of α-SMA and TGF-β. TGF-β can activate the p38/MAPK pathway and, in turn, NF-κB [24]. It has been reported that the activation of NF-κB in liver promotes hepatic fibrosis [25]. CGA treatment attenuated the activation of p38, JNK, and NF-κB p65 in liver tissue (Fig. 2E). These results show that CGA attenuated alcohol-induced fibrosis by suppressing TGF-β-mediated activation of p38/MAPK signaling, thereby inducing an inflammatory response and promoting hepatic fibrosis. Using TUNEL staining, which labels DNA strand breaks generated in early apoptotic cells, we observed a significantly higher number of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes in the ethanol-only group than in the ethanol plus CGA group (Fig. 3 A). Colorimetric detection of caspase activity in liver tissue indicates that CGA treatment reduced alcohol-induced caspase activity (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, proteolytic cleavage of a proapoptotic marker and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were markedly decreased post CGA treatment (Fig. 3C). In several studies, 8-OHdG has been widely used as a biomarker for the measurement of endogenous oxidative DNA damage. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-8-OHdG antibodies showed oxidative DNA damage in the livers of ethanol-fed mice and decreased damage in the livers of ethanol-fed mice treated with CGA (Fig. 3D). Acute ethanol treatment increases the production of ROS, which causes DNA damage, and high levels of DNA damage triggers apoptosis [26]. CGA exhibits protective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the DNA damage response induced by alcohol consumption. Taken together, ROS induces increase in TNF-α and TGF-β levels in liver tissue, leading to elevated expression of SREBP-1 and FAS, and activation of p38/MAPK signaling in hepatocytes of alcohol-fed rats [8,9]. Production of ROS also results in DNA damage, which leads to induction of apoptosis in hepatocytes [27]. CGA is expected to attenuate the symptoms of ALD via its antioxidant effect, which reduces the level of ROS and oxidative stress. The ROS levels in the liver tissues were measured as the level of peroxide through DAB staining (Fig. 4 A). As a marker for oxidative damage to the antioxidant enzyme Prx, increased levels of Prx-SO3 suggest an overall increase in protein oxidation in the livers treated with ethanol alone compared with those in livers treated with both CGA and ethanol (Fig. 4B). Levels of 4-HNE, a major lipid peroxidation product, was found to be decreased in liver tissue of CGA-treated ethanol-fed mice (Fig. 4C). These results supported that CGA administration alleviates the oxidative damage induced by ethanol consumption. In order to maintain redox balance, cells are equipped with elaborate network of antioxidant defense systems. NADPH and GSH are essential factors for these defense systems. Ethanol treatment decreased the levels of NADPH, which is essential for the regeneration of GSH and reduced thioredoxin system, and increased the ratio of GSSG to total glutathione (GSH + GSSG), which is an important parameter of GSH turnover, in the mouse liver. These alterations of redox status were mitigated following CGA consumption with ethanol (Fig. 4D and E). Taken together, our results suggest that increased intracellular ROS production and oxidative stress in the livers of ethanol-fed mice were lowered by CGA treatment. Mitochondria are the major organelles of ROS production. Because ethanol causes an increase in oxygen consumption and induction of CYP2E1, which in turn may elevate the mitochondrial generation of ROS. The exposure of ROS in mitochondria causes oxidative damage to the organelles [28,29]. In order to investigate whether CGA protected mitochondria from damage caused by alcohol-induced ROS, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential change in the rate at which mitochondria take up rhodamine 123 and the influx JC-1 into mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the uptake of rhodamine 123 dye by primary mouse hepatocyte that were only treated with ethanol was significantly less, than that by the cells treated with CGA. As shown in Fig. 5B, ethanol-fed mouse primary hepatocytes emitted green fluorescence indicating monomer form of JC-1, suggestive of low membrane potential. When CGA treatment was given together with alcohol, mouse primary hepatocytes showed red fluorescence emitted by the aggregate form of JC-1, indicative of high membrane potential [30]. Using confocal microscopy with the mitochondrial oxidant-sensitive probe mitoSox, the levels of peroxides in the mitochondria were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5C, after ethanol treatment, mitoSox fluorescence intensity was markedly increased. However, the increase in fluorescence intensity was attenuated when CGA treatment was given. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles maintaining their morphology and functions by continuous fusion and fission. Mitochondrial oxidative stress breaks the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation, which causes mitochondrial and cell dysfunctioning [31]. Microscopy imaging show the number of fragmented mitochondria were higher in primary cells treated with ethanol alone than in primary cells treated with CGA and ethanol together (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that CGA protects mitochondria and its functions from oxidative stress through ameliorating the increasing levels of mitochondrial ROS induced by ethanol consumption. Previous studies suggested that CGA has antioxidant properties and beneficial effects on an organism [6,7,32]. Contrarily, there was a view which suggested that CGA acts as a free radical generator because it has an ability to enhance ·OH generation in Fenton reaction system [33]. However, another group of investigators demonstrated that CGA is capable of eliminating ·OH by observing electron spin resonance [34,35]. To confirm that CGA has the ability to scavenge ROS, we measured the IDH2 enzyme activity to determine the level of damage on the enzyme, which is highly susceptible to ROS. As shown in Fig. 6 A, with CGA treatment, IDH2 activity was protected against the damage from hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and superoxide anion, which clearly demonstrated the ROS scavenging capability of CGA. From the extract of mouse livers, SOD activity, which is also affected by excessive quantity of ROS, was measured to confirm the protective effect of CGA against alcohol-induced ROS in vivo. The data shows that SOD is also protected by CGA treatment (Fig. 6B). In conclusion, CGA scavenges mitochondrial and intracellular ROS to reduce oxidative stress in liver exposed to ethanol. This resulted in the attenuation of DNA damage and inflammatory response-induced activation signaling pathways in hepatocytes. Consequently, the development of alcoholic liver injuries such as steatosis, hepatocyte apoptosis, and hepatic-fibrosis were inhibited. Therefore, CGA acts as a protective agent against ALD through its function as a ROS scavenger."
