0,Introduction,"Overuse of fossil fuels results in environmental pollution and climate change problems. Currently, the researchers around the world are focusing on developing a new energy source for sustainable growth. Most countries have realized the importance of hydrogen, which is mentioned as a future energy carrier [1] and accordingly, expected to play a key role in clean environment. Thus, environmental-friendly hydrogen production methods are being intensively investigated in recent years. Among the hydrogen generation techniques reported, the biological way is reliable and promising due to the abundant feedstock availability and low-cost apparatus requirements [2]. Recent evolution in the biodiesel sector has dramatically increased the quantity of solid wastes generated. Hydrogen fermentation from non-food cellulosic biomass is an attractive bioenergy production technology. The biodiesel-processed waste and wastewaters to produce hydrogen and ethanol using pure and mixed cultures were reported previously [3–5]. Temperature, substrate concentration and pH are undoubtedly the main environmental and operational factors that affect any biological fermentation. It has been stated that higher substrate concentrations could enhance hydrogen fermentation efficiency, but product inhibition occurs at above a certain level which ranges widely for various substrates used [6]. Hence, there is no general optimal concentration for the various substrates used in anaerobic fermentation processes [7]. The operational temperature and substrate concentration vary according to the nature of the feedstock materials. The possible reason for this discrepancy is the versatile sources of inoculum and substrate concentrations employed [6]. Temperature is one of the crucial parameters since the anaerobic organisms are sensitive to it. In addition, it plays a major role in substrate degradation, enzyme activity promotion, alcohols formation and microbial population distribution [8]. Fermentative hydrogen production employing sewage sludge has been demonstrated in both mesophilic and extreme thermophilic temperatures; however most fermentation of lignocellulosic waste employs thermophilic conditions due to its efficient hydrolysis of these hardly digestible compounds. Dark fermentation efficiency is dependent on the operational pH, which is important to drive the pathway between solvent and acid formation. Optimal pH value for batch and continuous systems differ depends on the substrate source and seed inoculum. A clear correlation between maximal production and pH has been reported [7]. Two-stage fermentation of solid wastes to produce hydrogen and methane has been described in several studies [9–12]. De-Oiled Jatropha Waste (DJW) is the solid residue remaining after oil is extracted from Jatropha seeds; the oil is then trans-esterified to make biodiesel fuel. The crushed solid residue contains toxic compounds that prohibit its use as animal fodder. Reports indicate that 2.5–3.0 tons of this material is generated for every ton of biodiesel product [13,14]. DJW is typically disposed by anaerobic digestion to produce biogas; however, pretreatment methods need to be developed to maximize its productivity. This work seeks to advance fermentative production of hydrogen and methane from DJW using sewage sludge microflora by studying the influence of substrate concentration, temperature and pH, and determining their optimum values for hydrogen and methane production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sewage sludge and feedstock,"2.1 Sewage sludge and feedstock The sewage sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in central Taiwan. The characteristics of the sludge were pH 6.9, alkalinity 1.23 g/L as CaCO3, volatile suspended solids (VSS) 32 g/L, total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) 48.7 g/L, and total carbohydrate 7.1 g/L as glucose. The collected sludge was stored in a refrigerator prior to use. DJW was collected from a biodiesel industry (central Taiwan) which produces biodiesel from Jatropha seeds. The characteristics of DJW are given in Table 1 . The carbohydrate content of DJW is nearly 42% (14% cellulose + 28% hemicellulose) [5]."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up 2.2.1 Batch experiments The batch experiments were conducted in vials (250 mL) with a working volume of 150 mL which was comprised of 30 mL of seed sludge, 1–3 mL of pH adjustment solution (1 N NaOH or HCl), 5 mL of nutrient solution and 30 g of the dried substrate (200 g/L) for temperature and pH experiments. DJW concentration of 6–36 g (40–240 g/L) used for the substrate concentration experiments. Tap water used to make the final working volume. The anaerobic environment was established by purging argon gas in headspace of the vials for 5 min. Then vials were kept in a reciprocal air-bath shaker at 150 rpm at a controlled temperature. The initial cultivation pH was adjusted to 7.0 for substrate concentration and temperature batches. The nutrient solution contained the following inorganic supplements (mg/L): K2HPO4 125, MgCl2·6H2O 100, MnSO4·6H2O 15, FeSO4·7H2O 25, CuSO4·5H2O 5, and CoCl2·5H2O 0.12 which was modified from Endo et al. [15]. The volume and composition of gas evolved were checked every 24 h. The soluble metabolic products (SMP) were analyzed for samples collected after the fermentation. Fermentation was carried out until the gas production stopped. All experiments were run in triplicates and the SD values are reported. 2.2.2 Experimental conditions for optimization of substrate concentration, temperature and pH The fermentation conditions for various DJW concentrations (40–240 g/L), temperatures (25–55 °C) and pHs (5.5–7.5) are given in Table 2 ."
4,Analytical procedure,"2.3 Analytical procedure The analytical procedures of Standard Methods of APHA [16] were used to determine pH, total solid (TS), COD, VSS and alkalinity. The volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan). The gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). For total carbohydrate concentration Anthrone–sulfuric acid method was used [17]. Cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin content were determined by FIBERTECTM 1020 (M6). Biogas production was measured in a periodic interval using 100, 50 and 25 mL glass syringes, depending on the expected biogas production fitted with hypodermic needles as described by Owen et al. [18] at room temperature (20 °C) and 1 atm (760 mmHg)."
5,Kinetic models,"2.4 Kinetic models The modified Gompertz equation Eq. (1) was used for data analysis using Sigma plot software 10.0 (Systat Software Inc., USA) [5]. (1) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where, H (t) is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); P is the hydrogen production potential (mL); R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); e is 2.71828; λ is the lag-phase time (h) and t is the cultivation time (h). Hydrogen production rate (HPR, mL H2/L-d) was calculated as the value of R m divided by the reactor volume (0.15 L) and multiplied by one day (24 h). Hydrogen yield (HY, mL H2/g VS) was calculated as hydrogen production per gram of dried DJW. The same method was followed for methane production rate (MPR) and methane yield (MY). The Monod model Eq. (2) was used to describe the effect of substrate concentration on HPR and MPR values estimated using modified Gompertz equation. (2) R = R max S K S + S where, R (mL/L-d) is the hydrogen production rate; R max (mL/L-d) is the maximal hydrogen production rate; S is the substrate concentration; K S (g/L) is the saturation constant."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Influence of DJW concentration on hydrogen and methane production,"3.1 Influence of DJW concentration on hydrogen and methane production The powdered DJW was converted to hydrogen and methane at different substrate concentrations are given in Table 3 . The hydrogen and methane production were dependent on the DJW concentrations and the total biogas varied from 649.5 ± 4.6 mL to 885.6 ± 6.2 mL. After 720.5 h, no further gas production was observed. Maximal hydrogen production of 277.0 ± 4.0 mL was found at DJW concentration of 200 g/L and further high concentration (240 g/L) inhibited hydrogen formation. However, 225.3 ± 6.1 mL of methane generation was achieved at high DJW concentration of 240 g/L. Fig. 1 shows the time course of cumulative biogas, hydrogen and methane formation. The biogas accumulation has gradually increased from 40 to 160 g/L and decreased at further concentrations of 200 and 240 g/L. According to the modified Gompertz equation analysis, lag-phase time remained in the range of 3.4 ± 0.2–12.5 ± 0.5 h for hydrogen and 66.9 ± 0.1–161.8 ± 0.2 h for methane generation. Maximal MPR of 166.4 ± 2.6 mL CH4/L-d was observed at 160 g/L. The reason should be that higher substrate concentration could enhance the production of VFAs which act as substrate for CH4 fermentation as indicated in some studies [19–21]. However, the hydrogen formation peaked at 200 g/L with HPR of 344.0 ± 11.3 mL H2/L-d. The produced biogas (containing H2 and CO2) was released out periodically. This avoided the gas (especially H2) accumulation in the headspace. The methane production observed after the cessation of H2 production revealed the step wise utilization of fermentation intermediates such as VFAs. The lag-phase values varied was related to substrate concentration (Table 4 ). Process efficiency was determined in terms of hydrogen and methane yields. In contrast to production rates, peak HY of 10.4 ± 0.3 mL H2/g VS and MY of 23.3 ± 0.1 mL CH4/g VS calculated at DJW concentration of 40 g/L, temperature of 55 °C and initial cultivation pH of 7.0."
8,Kinetic evaluation of hydrogen and methane production rates,"3.2 Kinetic evaluation of hydrogen and methane production rates The Monod model Eq. (2) was used to elucidate the effect of the substrate concentration in biological processes as shown in other studies [9,20,21]. The experimental data obtained at different DJW concentrations ranging from 40 to 240 g/L were fitted to the model and the kinetic constants were determined. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . The parameter values are given in Table 5 . The R max, saturation constant (K S) (the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is reduced to half of its maximum value) values were estimated from regression analysis as 379.8 mL H2/L-d, 35.7 g/L for HPR and 158.6 mL CH4/L-d, 9.4 g/L for MPR. The coefficient of determination (R 2) was more than 0.9 indicating that the model is reliable. Since DJW is a complex substrate, the conversion efficiency is less compared to a pure substrate such as glucose which could achieve 100% conversion. This proved that better utilization of DJW by bacteria occurred at lower (35.7 g/L) concentration and more amount of substrate added is not converted as desired product (hydrogen or methane)."
9,Influence of temperature on hydrogen and methane evolution,"3.3 Influence of temperature on hydrogen and methane evolution The hydrogen and methane fermentation at various temperatures of 25–65 °C were carried out at an initial cultivation pH of 7 at 200 g/L DJW concentration. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the values of hydrogen and methane generated. The hydrogen production potential value of 299.0 ± 5.5 mL was observed at 55 °C. This value was 4.1 and 1.1 times higher than those at 25 °C and 65 °C, respectively. Correspondingly, HY of 9.9 ± 0.2 mL H2/g VS was calculated at the same operation conditions. Peak methane production potential value was 263.5 ± 0.7 mL at 45 °C and MY of 8.8 ± 0.1 mL CH4/g VS obtained at the same operational temperature. The time course of hydrogen and methane production during 974 h of fermentation at different temperatures is illustrated in Fig. 3. The lag-phase time ranged between 1.8 ± 0.2 h to 6.7 ± 0.4 h for hydrogen and 69.4 ± 0.4 to 367.7 ± 0.4 h for methane production. The cumulative hydrogen and methane generation data were well fitted to the modified Gompertz equation with R 2 > 0.90 (Table 4) and the parameter values were strongly dependent on the operation temperature. Methane production was completely inhibited at 65 °C. A previous study also reported that the methanogen activity could be inhibited when the fermentor was operated at extreme thermophilic conditions [22]. Maximal HPR (657.6 ± 9.1 mL H2/L-d) and MPR (178.4 ± 5.6 mL CH4/L-d), were achieved at 55 °C and 45 °C respectively. Additionally, HY and MY values also occurred at the same conditions. The lag-phase time for hydrogen and methane productions was not dependent on the temperatures (Table 4). At 65 °C, no methane production was observed due to the fact that methanogens cannot tolerate this high temperature. These results demonstrate that hydrogen and methane productions were dependent on the cultivation temperature and suggested that the enhancement of hydrogen production requires a thermophilic environment, but too high temperature is not suitable. Besides, methane production requires moderate temperatures (25–35 °C) to ensure sufficient bacterial growth and survival of the microbial community."
10,Influence of pH on hydrogen and methane fermentation,"3.4 Influence of pH on hydrogen and methane fermentation The thermophilic fermentation of DJW to hydrogen and methane gas during 1056 h fermentation (Fig. 4 ) at different initial cultivation pHs of 5.5–7.5 is shown in Table 3. The P values (Table 4) fluctuated accordingly with the variations in the initial pH. Over the five pH values studied, peak values of hydrogen and methane production potential of 308.6 ± 6.3 mL, 261.0 ± 1.73 mL were observed at pH 6.5 and 7.5, respectively. This reveals that hydrogen formation favors a slightly acidic pH environment as supported by other studies [23–25]. Next, higher values were observed as 296 ± 1.0 mL and 216.6 ± 1.2 mL at pH 7.0, respectively. The lower pH (i.e. 5.5) might result in decreasing the system pH to such a condition that is not favorable for hydrogen producers. This might have driven the fermentation pathway from acetogenesis to solventogenesis, which results in the inhibition of hydrogen fermentation. It is well known that acid accumulation in a dark fermentation system causes a sharp drop in pH which is not suitable for the bacterial activity at pH less than 5.0 [26], hence suppress the activity of hydrogen producers [27–29]. The experimental data were fitted to the Gompertz equation and the values of P, R m and λ parameters given in Table 4. The maximum R m obtained for hydrogen and methane productions were 4.65 ± 0.07 mL and 0.99 ± 0.01 mL/h at pH 6.5 and 7.5 and turned to HPR and MPR values of 744.0 ± 11.3 mL H2/L-d and 158.4 ± 2.3 mL CH4/L-d, respectively. These values were 1.5 and 17.5 times higher when compared to the value obtained at pH 5.5. Hence, it could be pointed out that changing the initial cultivation pH could alter the production of all metabolites that accounted in the variation of hydrogen and methane formation. Thus, the initial pH was found to be 6.5 and 7.5 for maximal formation of hydrogen and methane, respectively. The lag-phase time values remained in the range of 6.8 ± 0.4–10.6 ± 0.5 h and 293.4 ± 0.4–509.7 ± 1.8 h for hydrogen and methane production. These values were not related to the change from initial pH. This indicates that there is no direct relationship between the fermentation time and initial pH values [30]. The long lag time value observed at pH 5.5 for methane production could be the adaptation of methanogens to the typical acidic environments. Thus the optimal parameters were determined for peak HPR and HY values as DJW concentration, temperature, and initial pH of 200 g/L, 55 °C, and 6.5, respectively. In addition peak MPR value was obtained at DJW concentration 200 g/L, temperature 45 °C and pH 7.0, however, MY was achieved at 40 g/L, 55 °C and 7.0, respectively."
11,Metabolic products distribution,"3.5 Metabolic products distribution Fig. 5 a–c indicates the percentage of soluble metabolic product formed during DJW fermentation of hydrogen and methane. Abundant metabolic products in liquid phase were acetate, butyrate and propionate along with lower amount of alcohols. H2 fermentation is usually accompanied with acid production due to the fermentative organisms following such a metabolic pathway where the acids are appeared as intermediate products [31,32]. In this study, VFA represents the sum of all produced acids whereas SMP accounts the sum of produced VFA and alcohols (ethanol and butanol). Higher concentration of VFA (5715 mg COD/L) was observed at DJW concentration of 200 g/L. Produced VFAs at 240 g/L were utilized for methane generation, hence the lower amount is observed. VFA concentration of 3123 mg COD/L was observed at a lower temperature of 25 °C. This might be due to the fact that lower temperature environment and the complex (lignocellulosic) nature of the feedstock are not supportive for the proliferation of acidogenic bacteria to promote a rapid acid production. The pH reduction from the initial level is considered as a representation of the acid formation and buffering capacity of the fermentation system. The intermediate production gradually reduces the system pH is the indication of a favorable hydrogen-formation environment. However, the pH change in all the experiments was not coincided with the concentration of VFA, contrarily showed a distinct profile. A similar case was observed [33] and the pH drop is not significantly varied, only 0–0.5 unit from initial pH. The highest pH drop (0.4 ± 0.1) was at 55 °C when the DJW concentration was 200 g/L. The lowest pH surge was noted (0.1 ± 0.1) at 25–35 °C when DJW concentration was 200 g/L. At DJW concentration 40 g/L at 55 °C, no pH change occurred where the final pH values remained almost the same as the initial pH 7.0. This is the optimal condition for methane generation since the methane producers cannot survive in acidic pH; maintained the system pH at neutral. Peak H2 production was observed at initial pH 6.5 and the final pH value was not significantly varied, VFA concentration was found as 4923 mg COD/L. Lower H2 production was observed at low pH (5.5) because of high alcohol production. The reason for this typical behavior is the formation of solvents, which is a hydrogen-consuming pathway, since the initial pH was below 5.8 [34]. This kind of shift is not suitable for hydrogen production; moreover the accumulation of VFA could inhibit the process [35]. The optimum pH for methanogenic bacteria is between 6.0 and 7.5 as mentioned in other studies [36,37]. Thus, the methane production peaked at pH 7.5; however it was marginal at pH 5.5. SMP analysis implies that VFA production accounts for 89–96% of liquid metabolite component and alcohols remained in the range of 4–11% in this fermentation system. The main SMPs were acetate (33–61%) and butyrate (18–56%) in all experiments. A similar SMP distribution pattern (Fig. 5a–c) has been observed in other studies using cellulosic materials [38,39]. Higher DJW concentration favored the production of propionate and ethanol which are unfavorable to hydrogen fermentation. This could be explained as ethanol production mainly utilizes the free electrons from NADH and results in the reduction of electron for hydrogenase-catalyzed hydrogen generation. The cumulated propionate concentration also resulted in low H2 production because propionate formation usually consumes the produced hydrogen. This outcome was reported in other studies [40,41]. The composition of the metabolites suggests that the acid-forming pathway dominated during the metabolic flow of H2 production at initial pH of 6.5, DJW concentration of 200 g/L and 55 °C."
12,Biodegradation of DJW,"3.6 Biodegradation of DJW It is stated that COD removal positively correlates with methane production and also an indicator of process efficiency in terms of carbon used. The values are represented in Table 6 . Peak removal (68.3 ± 1.6%) was obtained at DJW concentration 200 g/L, temperature 45 °C and pH 7.0. In fact methane production peaked at these conditions. Similar removal has been observed in conventional anaerobic digestion processes [42]. Alkalinity ranged from 4495 ± 91 mg/L to 6700 ± 424 mg/L as CaCO3 is the favorable condition for hydrogen production. Total carbohydrate removal was directly proportional to the hydrogen production. Peak TC removal (51.7 ± 0.7%) was attained at DJW concentration 200 g/L, temperature 55 °C and pH 6.5. This revealed that only half of the carbohydrate was fermented to H2, CH4 and CO2. The reason could be the non-easy degradation nature of this lignocellulosic waste which in turn has less contribution to the fermentation reactions. Pretreatment of this waste could increase the sugar concentrations in hydrolyzate, which in turn enhance the production efficiency. Thus, pretreatment is necessary increase the total energy production."
13,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the conversion of hydrogen and methane from DJW. Substrate concentration, operation temperature and pH significantly affected and positively correlated with hydrogen and methane generation. The optimal DJW concentration, temperature and pH were 200 g/L, 55 °C and 6.5, respectively for hydrogen and 200 g/L, 45 °C and 7.0 for methane production in terms of HPR and MPR values. Monod model provided the information of production rates influence by substrate concentration. The SMP analysis provided the key information about the fermentation pathway. COD reduction (68.3 ± 1.6%.) and TC removal (51.7 ± 0.7%) showed the efficiency of the process."
