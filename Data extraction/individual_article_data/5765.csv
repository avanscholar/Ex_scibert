0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols synthesis from CO hydrogenation is of interest to enhance the octane number for motor fuels, thereby reducing toxic emissions like CO and NO x [1]. Alkali-modified molybdenum-sulfided catalysts are widely used for higher alcohols synthesis from synthesis gas. Alkali promotion reduces the hydrogenation ability of alkyl species to form alkanes and increases the active sites for the formation of alcohols. These catalytic systems displayed a high proportion of methanol to higher alcohols [2–4]. Carbon-supported catalysts hold several advantages compared to catalysts supported on silica and alumina. The interaction between the support and the active material is limited due to the inertness of the graphitic surface [5,6]. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are quite suitable as carbon-based catalytic supports. They display unique characteristics such as appropriate pore-size distribution favouring maximum metallic dispersion, highly graphitized tube-walls, and nano-sized channels [7–9]. The addition of transition metals increases the reactivity of MoS2, promoting the formation of MoS x films [10]. The promotion of transition metals (Co and Rh) improved the activity and selectivity of higher alcohols by modifying the structure of the alkali-modified molybdenum-sulfided catalysts to obtain highly dispersed catalysts and shifted the product distribution to the formation of oxygenates [11–13]. The promotion of transition metals to MoS2 catalysts leads to the formation of mixed metallic particles with Mo components on the support after reduction and sulfidation. This chemical interaction between the metal promoters and molybdenum gives rise to a different catalytic behaviour from that of molybdenum alone [14,15]. Sun et al. [16] investigated the modification effect of Co on the MoS2-edge surfaces using density functional theory applying the generalized gradient approximation. They explained that incorporation of Co on edge surfaces of MoS2 caused the structural modification and increased the number of active sites for higher alcohols synthesis. One molybdenum atom of every two MoS2 molecule is substituted by cobalt, and the Co atoms located at edge surfaces generate partially promoted Co–Mo–S surface species. Li et al. [14] studied the local structures of the molybdenum sulfide species in the sulfided Rh–Mo–K/A12O3 catalysts using Mo K-edge EXAFS and explained that Rh promotion reduced Mo–Mo coordination shells revealing a high dispersion of the MoS2-like species in the catalysts by the formation of Rh–Mo–S phase. The M–Mo–S (M=Co or Rh) phase facilitates the dissociation of H2 on the surface of the catalyst and increases the concentration of atomic hydrogen. In turn, this increases the number of unsaturated (S-free) Mo sites and the higher alcohols selectivity [17]. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy can be used to investigate local symmetry and electronic structure, including oxidation states of absorbing atoms even when the species formed are present as amorphous and/or highly dispersed phases [18]. XANES at the sulfur K-edge can be used to investigate variations in sulfur species, such as sulfide, sulfite, and sulfate [19]. This technique also provides useful site-specific information for sulfur species on the catalysts and can be used to differentiate the presence of various sulfides based on the shape and the position of the XANES features [20]. Sarret et al. [21] characterized different forms of sulfur, such as, disulfide, monosulfide, thiophene, sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfate using XANES at the S K-edge. XANES at the Mo L absorption edge holds several advantages over the Mo K-edge, such as higher resolution in terms of both the monochromater resolution and a smaller natural width at the L-edge, and the ability of probing the bonding d orbitals at the L-edge. Mo L-edge results have been used by different groups to establish the relation between coordination and the d-band vacancies of the central atom [22–24]. Lede et al. [25] studied the change in the molybdenum symmetry and occupancy of the 4d level due to the incorporation of a second metal to the Mo-zeolite substrate and determined the relationships between the white line area at the Mo L3-edge and the d-character in pure metals and in some 3d transition-metal complexes. We have recently demonstrated that the addition of Co and Rh metal promoters to alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts supported on MWCNTs display improved catalytic performance towards higher alcohols formation from synthesis gas [12,15,26]. The addition of promoters may modify the chemical environment, symmetry, and location of the molybdenum in the supported catalysts. Since these factors exert a strong effect on reactivity, knowledge of the chemical and electronic structure of Mo and S species is important. The present work aims to emphasize the improved performance of molybdenum-sulfided catalysts due to the influence of alkali and metal promoters in modifying the surface structure and oxidation states. In this study, five different catalysts supported on MWCNTs having the same Mo content were prepared and promoted, with or without K, Co, and Rh. To compare the catalysts supported on MWCNTs with those on activated carbon, an alkali-modified trimetallic Co–Rh–Mo catalyst supported on activated carbon was prepared and used. These catalysts were studied using XANES at the S K- and Mo L3-edges to structurally characterize the S and Mo species. To differentiate the surface and bulk properties of the catalysts, both the surface sensitive total electron yield (TEY) and the bulk sensitive fluorescence yield (FLY) were recorded. Together with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, these findings offer valuable information on the electronic and structural properties that can be correlated directly with the catalytic activity of promoted Mo catalysts."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Commercially available MWCNTs and activated carbon were used as catalyst supports and the catalysts were prepared by the conventional incipient wetness method, as described in our preceding papers [4,12,15,26]. Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM), potassium carbonate, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate, and rhodium chloride hydrate were used as precursors for Mo, K, Co, and Rh, respectively."
3,Catalytic studies,"2.2 Catalytic studies The catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to higher alcohols were performed using the feed gas mixture CO (40mol%), H2 (50mol%), and Ar (10mol%) in a single-pass tubular downflow fixed-bed reactor under the reaction conditions of 330°C, 9.1 (1320psig), and 3.8m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst) over a period of 24h. The detailed description about the high pressure reaction set up used in this study was discussed in our previous papers [4,12,15,26]. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced and sulfided for 6h at 450°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min using a gas mixture containing 10 mol% H2S in H2 and a flow rate of 50ml/min. The product gas was cooled to 0°C and separated into gas and liquid phases at the reaction pressure. The liquid products were collected at the end of the reaction and analyzed with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The gaseous products were analyzed online on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph through a sampling valve for every 1h. The experiments were repeated at least twice to check reproducibility and to confirm that the results obtained were within the experimental error of ±2.5%."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the MoS2 catalysts promoted with or without K, Co, and Rh-supported on MWCNT or activated carbon were measured by N2-physisorption at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Approximately 0.2g of sample was used for each analysis. Before analysis, the moisture and other adsorbed gases present in the sample were removed by degassing the sample at 200°C for 2h under 66.7Pa (500mmHg). The sample was then evacuated at 2.67Pa (20μmHg) before N2 adsorption. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis patterns of sulfide forms of samples were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffraction instrument with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.1541nm). Each sample was scanned at a rate of 0.05°/s, with 2θ varying from 10 to 80°. To obtain the XRD patterns in sulfided form, the catalysts were first sulfided for 6h at 450°C, at a heating rate of 2°C/min using a gaseous mixture containing 10mol% H2S in H2 at a flow rate of 50ml/min. After sulfidation, the catalysts were cooled to room temperature in a flow of He and the sample was transferred to sample holders under protection of He. The S K-edge and Mo L3-edge XANES of the sulfided catalysts were obtained at the Soft X-ray Microanalysis Beamline (SXRMB) of the Canadian Light Source (CLS; Saskatoon, SK, Canada) using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. CLS, a 2.9GeV, third generation storage ring, presently operates with an injection current of 250mA. The sample was dispersed on double-sided conducting carbon tapes under a dry nitrogen atmosphere, and the measurements were made in both total electron yield by recording the sample drain current and fluorescence yield using a PGT single element Si(Li) drift detector. The XANES spectra were normalized to incident photon flux and to unity at the maximum intensity of each spectrum. Linear combination fitting of Mo L3-edge spectra was performed using Athena software. The fitting was performed using the first derivative curves, and the weights of the components were set to be between 0 and 1 and the sum was forced to 1 during the fit."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic studies,"3.1 Catalytic studies Fig. 1 shows the simplified reaction scheme of higher alcohols reaction from synthesis gas over alkali-modified MoS2-based catalysts According to this CO insertion mechanism [13], CO hydrogenation takes place in three different steps: (a) chain initiation, (b) chain propagation, and (c) chain termination. In the first step, adsorption of CO takes place on the mixed K–Mo–S and M–Mo–S phases (M=transition metals such as Co, Ni, Fe, or Rh), while hydrogen adsorption occurs at the separated metal sulfide sites such as MoS x and MS x , and these surface species react to form R1Os (R1-CH3) intermediates. These species propagate chain growth through hydrogenation, followed by insertion of molecularly adsorbed COs to form long chain intermediates R is (R i =C n H2n+1, n =1, 2, 3, …) and R i+1Os (R i+1 =C2n H2n+1, n =1, 2, 3, …). In the final step, direct hydrogenation of these intermediate hydrocarbon species leads to the formation of alkanes and methanol, while the higher alcohols are obtained from hydrogenation of the oxygenated hydrocarbon surface species (R1Os and R i+1Os). This mechanism results in the formation of linear chain alcohols due to linear growth by C1 intermediate insertion at the end of the chain that is bound to the surface. Table 1 shows the activity and selectivity results obtained from the CO hydrogenation reaction carried out under similar conditions at 330°C, 9.1MPa (1320psig), 3.8m3 (STP)/h/(kg of catalyst), and H2 to CO molar ratio of 1.25 over the sulfided Mo-based catalysts promoted with or without K, Co, and/or Rh. The analysis of the liquid products indicates that linear alcohols are formed and no branched alcohols were observed in the GC trace corresponding to the higher alcohols. The term higher alcohols represents the ethanol and alcohols with a carbon number greater than 2 (C2+ alcohols). Methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol are the major liquid products, together with other higher alcohols. Analysis of the exit gas indicates that methane is the major component, apart from CO2 and unconverted gases such as CO and H2. The % CO conversion increased with the addition of metal promoters, Co and Rh over the sulfided Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst. Among the alkali-promoted MWCNT catalysts, the trimetallic Co–Rh–Mo catalyst showed the highest CO conversion of 51.2%, confirming that CO hydrogenation is improved with the addition of metal promoters to the alkali-modified MoS2 catalysts. Improved CO hydrogenation (% CO conversion 64.8%) is observed over the MWCNT-supported trimetallic catalyst without K. Addition of alkali reduced the availability of metal sulfide sites such as MoS2 and MS x (M=Co or Rh), thus suppressing the adsorption of hydrogen [27]. A lower CO conversion of 35.6% was observed on the alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst supported on activated carbon, indicating that the CO hydrogenation activity was comparatively higher on catalysts supported on MWCNTs. The poor performance of activated carbon supported catalysts can be explained due to the lower dispersions of metal species on the support compared to that of catalysts supported on MWCNTs [26]. The total alcohols and total hydrocarbons space–time yields (STY) of 0.12 and 0.19g/(g of cat./h), respectively, were observed over the sulfided Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst. The addition of Co and Rh to the sulfided Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst increased the total alcohols STY to 0.26 and 0.26g/(g of cat.)/h, respectively and the total hydrocarbons STY to 0.39 and 0.36g/(g of cat.)/h, respectively. This may be due to the synergistic interaction of the metal promoters with the molybdenum species that improves the formation of the catalytically active sites (Co (Rh)–Mo–S), leading to a decrease in the size of the molybdenum species [26]. The alkali-promoted trimetallic Co–Rh–Mo catalyst supported on MWCNTs showed an improved total alcohol STY of 0.29g/(g of cat.)/h, whereas the total hydrocarbon STY decreased, compared to that of alkali-promoted bimetallic catalysts. Decreased methanol selectivities and increased selectivities of ethanol and higher alcohols were observed for the bimetallic alkali-promoted catalysts supported on MWCNTs compared to that of the monometallic catalyst. The highest ethanol and higher alcohols selectivities of 25.7 and 39.4%, respectively, were observed with the trimetallic catalyst promoted with alkali and supported on MWCNT. The improved selectivity to higher alcohols with the addition of metal promoters can be explained by a structure modification of MoS2, whereby one of the two Mo atoms is replaced by metal promoters (Co and Rh) and the metal promoter atoms located at edge surfaces generate partially promoted M–Mo–S surface species [16]. This results in an increased number of active sites, which significantly increases the selectivity towards the formation of higher alcohols. The alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst supported on activated carbon displayed a total alcohols and total hydrocarbons STY of 0.19 and 0.22 gm/(gm of cat.)/h, respectively. The alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst supported on activated carbon showed the highest selectivity towards methanol, compared to that of ethanol and other higher alcohols. This confirms that the chain growth mechanism that promotes the formation of higher alcohols is less effective on activated carbon supported catalysts compared to those supported on MWCNTs."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization 3.2.1 Textural characteristics The textural characteristics of all the catalysts are shown in Table 2 . The surface area and pore volume of all the catalysts were decreased compared with that of the support due to the pore blocking and surface smoothing by the deposition of metals in sulfide state on the support. The BET surface area of Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst was found to be 109m2/g. With the incorporation of Co and Rh to the Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst, the surface area was decreased to 89 and 86m2/g, respectively. The alkali-promoted trimetallic Co–Rh–Mo/MWCNT catalyst showed a BET surface area of 79m2/g, whereas the trimetallic catalyst not promoted with K showed a BET surface of 68m2/g. The blocking extent (BE) of the pores of the support due to metal loading was calculated using BE=1−NSBET, where NSBET is the normalized surface area, and is defined as NSBET =(S BET)catalyst/((1− y)×(S BET)support), in which y is the weight fraction of the total metal content of the catalyst. The alkali-modified catalysts supported on MWCNTs showed increased BE with metal content, whereas, the trimetallic catalyst supported on MWCNTs without K displayed higher BE value (0.61) compared to that of the catalyst promoted with K (BE value is 0.49) These results suggest that alkali helped to disperse the metal species on the support, favouring the formation of small particles. A drastic fall in surface area over the activated carbon-supported catalysts was observed. The BE is found to be high on activated carbon supported alkali-modified trimetallic catalyst compared to that of the catalyst supported on MWCNTs. Activated carbon is a microporous support and has relatively low pore volume and pore size compared to that of MWCNTs, which are mesoporous in nature. The particle size distribution, dispersion, and extent of reduction depend on the pore size of supported catalysts and directly affect mass transfer diffusion rates of reactants and products. MWCNT supports have the advantage of large pore volume and pore size that facilitates uniform metal particle distribution and high dispersions [28]. 3.2.2 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of the catalysts in sulfided form were measured and shown in Fig. 2 . The JCPDS chemical spectra data bank was used to detect the most probable phases present in the samples, and the results of the possible crystal phases with their corresponding reflection planes are given in Table 3 . The intense peaks at d-spacing of 3.35 are due to the reflections of the graphite phase present in the MWCNT and activated carbon supports [29]. The reflections of MoS2 crystallites are observed at d-spacings of 6.11, 2.71, and 1.57 (Fig. 2(a)) [30]. With the addition of metal promoters, Co and Rh, new peaks, such as at d-spacings of 3.02 and 1.75, can be observed, suggesting the formation of the new phases, Co (Rh)–Mo–S. These new phases are related to the electron donation from Co (Rh) to Mo. The formation of Co (Rh)–Mo–S decreases the Mo–S bond strength to an optimum range and significantly increases the activity of the catalyst towards the formation of higher alcohols [31]. The peaks at d-spacings of 3.1, 3.02, and 2.78 are observed on all the catalysts promoted with K. These are due to the characteristic reflections of the K–Mo–S species, and are related to active sites for higher alcohols synthesis [32]. The peak at d-spacing of 1.75 is due to the different reflecting planes’ characteristic of bulk Co9S8 particles [33]. The XRD patterns of the Co–Rh–Mo trimetallic catalyst without the alkali promoter mainly revealed three peaks due to the characteristic reflections of graphitic carbon, MoS2, and Co9S8 species. The intensity of these crystalline peaks is found to be large compared to the alkali-promoted catalyst, suggesting that alkali reduces the crystalline nature of the catalyst particles and favours the formation of smaller particles. 3.2.3 XANES: overview Fig. 3 shows the S K-edge and Mo L3-edge XANES spectra of MoS2 and three trimetallic MoS2 catalysts. The total electron yield (TEY) is more surface sensitive, with an estimated probing depth of 100nm at the S K-edge (Fig. 3(a)), while the fluorescence yield (FLY) is more bulk sensitive, with a probing depth about 10 times deeper than that of TEY (Fig. 3(b)). The TEY and FLY spectra for these samples are essentially identical in peak energy positions, but quite different in relative peak intensities. These spectra can be divided into three general regions: region A, around 2471eV, is due to the S 1s to 3p dominated transitions of S in −2 oxidation state, such as MoS2; region B appearing at 2481eV is associated with the presence of oxidized sulfate (SO4 −2) species; and region C around 2524eV is assigned to absorptions as a result of transitions from Mo 2p3/2 initial state to empty orbitals with mainly Mo 4d characters. Compared to the sulfide peak (A), the relative intensities of peaks B and C are higher in the TEY spectra, indicating a more oxidized surface (Fig. 3(a) vs (b)). It is worth noting that the sulfate peak (B) is more pronounced in the K-promoted trimetallic systems, while there is little or no sulfate observed in spectra of the MoS2 and of the catalyst without K. This is consistent with the XRD observation that only diffraction patterns due to MoS2 and Co9S8 are present in the trimetallic catalyst without the alkali promoter (Fig. 2). The formation of sulfate species in the K-promoted MoS2 catalysts is due to the oxidation of sulfur in the presence of oxygen of the molybdates [34]. Zubavichus et al. [35] explained that the oxidation of MoS2 takes place at surface-situated active centers located in the non-intercalated amorphous outer region of the particles. This partial oxidation of the sample is in agreement with the previous observation of S oxidation during synthesis and/or ageing by Guay et al. [36]. The oxidation of Mo atom is also evident in the Mo L3-edge results, as a shoulder peak at 2527.7eV. The alkali promotion leads to the formation of new phases, such as K–Mo–S, thus decreasing the number of available Mo sites. These results indicate that alkali promotion increased the susceptibility of MoS2 layers to oxidation, thus improving the catalytic performance for higher alcohols yield. On the other hand, the trimetallic system without K promotion has very high hydrocarbon and little alcohol yield (Table 1). Its S K-edge spectrum is similar to that of MoS2, confirming the important role of oxidation of MoS2 in production of high alcohols. The peak intensities of sulfide and Mo of the catalyst supported on MWCNT are found to be higher than those of the activated carbon supported catalyst, consistent with the higher catalytic performance observed for catalysts supported on MWCNT (Table 1). 3.2.4 XANES: the S K-edge The S K-edge XANES spectra of sulfur standards (MoS2 and FeSO4) and the MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts promoted with or without Co and Rh recorded in TEY are displayed in Fig. 4 . Compared to the spectra of sulfur standards, it is clear that both sulfide and sulfate species are present in all alkali-promoted catalysts. The broadening of peak A for alkali-modified MoS2-based catalysts, in particular the additional shoulder in peak A of the Co–Rh–Mo–K/MWCNT sample, provide further evidence of the formation of Co (Rh)–Mo–S networks in the Co and Rh-promoted catalysts. Peak B of the alkali-promoted catalysts is broader with additional intensity at the lower energy side, compared to that of FeSO4. This is likely due to the formation of sulfate of a mixed nature (K–Mo–S, Co–Mo–S or Rh–Mo–S) in bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts and the chemical shift is due to stronger bonding between Fe and sulfate over the bonding between Mo (and/or Co, Rh) and sulfate. Finally, an additional shoulder around 2477eV (peak B) can be observed in the spectra of alkali-promoted catalysts, a feature usually associated with intermediate sulfur species with an oxidation state of +4 or +2 [37]. These results indicate that the formation of new phases (K–Mo–S, Co–Mo–S, and/or Rh–Mo–S) takes place with the addition of promoters, decreasing the crystalline nature of MoS2 species, which correlates well with the catalytic performance shown in Table 1. 3.2.5 XANES: Mo L3-edge The Mo L3-edge XANES of reference compounds, MoS2 (Mo oxidation state +4) and ammonium hepta molybdate (AHM) (Mo oxidation state +6), and the MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts, recorded in TEY-mode spectra are given in Fig. 5 . The Mo L3-edge of MoS2 was observed at 2523.6eV with a shoulder peak at 2530.7eV due to the tetrahedral coordination of Mo atoms [38]. The Mo L3-edge XANES spectrum of ammonium hepta molybdate (AHM) displayed a characteristic doublet at 2525.0 and 2527.5eV, as a result of the ligand field splitting of the d final states under octahedral symmetry [36]. The Mo L3-edge spectra of the MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted bimetallic or trimetallic catalysts shown in Fig. 5 are somewhat different from those of the Mo model compounds. The main peak is at a very similar energy position (2524.0eV) to that of MoS2, suggesting the presence of MoS2 in these catalysts. The broadening of the main peak and the presence of the second peak at 2527.7eV that overlaps the doublet of the AHM spectrum, strongly suggest that the Mo exists in the oxidation state between +4 and +6 on these catalysts with the addition of Co and Rh due to the formation of Co (Rh)–Mo–S mixed phase. The intensity of 2527.5eV peak follows the order of Co–Rh–Mo–K/MWCNT>Co–Mo–K/MWCNT>Rh–Mo–K/MWCNT>Mo–K/CNT. Fig. 6 presents the linear combination fitting of the Mo L3-edge spectra of the catalyst Mo–K/MWCNT. Spectra of MoS2 and AHM are used as standards in the fitting. Based on the fitting, the oxidized Mo+6 species is estimated to be 19.2%, 11.5%, and 0.4% for the Mo–K/MWCNT, Co–Rh–Mo–K/MWCNT, and Co–Rh–Mo/MWCNT catalysts, respectively. In trimetallic catalysts without K, the Mo species mainly exist as MoS2 state, whereas the addition of K favours the oxidation of Mo+4 to Mo+6 states. The addition of transition metal promoters (Co and Rh) to the Mo–K catalyst leads to the formation of Co (Rh)–Mo–S phase, in which Mo exists mainly in +5 oxidation state, which is the active phase for the formation of higher alcohols [39]. The decreased amount of Mo+6 species due to the promotion of Co and Rh to the Mo–K catalyst suggests the reduction of Mo from +6 to +5 oxidation state. The trimetallic catalyst without K showed improved activity towards the formation of hydrocarbons and very little activity for the alcohols synthesis reaction. From the results of XRD and XANES, it was observed that the intensity of the metal sulfide peaks is large (no sulfate intensity) and the BET surface area is less on the trimetallic catalyst that is not promoted with K, compared to that of alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst. Park et al. [40] concluded that the alkali helped to improve the association of Mo oxide and Co oxide on the γ-Al2O3 support, favouring more active sites due to the formation of chemically combined Co–Mo–O phase. The results in the present study also implied that the addition of K is beneficial to the dispersion of large metal sulfide agglomerates to small particles on the support by favouring the formation of chemically combined new phases (Co (Rh)–Mo–S) in the sulfide state. This suggests that the promotion of alkali reduces the hydrogenation ability of alkyl species to form alkanes and increases the active sites for the formation of alcohols, as reported in the literature [41]."
8,Conclusions,"The addition of Co and Rh, to the sulfided Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst improved the space–time yield and selectivity of the higher alcohols. The maximum total alcohols yield of 0.29 (g/(g of cat.)/h) and higher alcohols selectivity of 39.4% were obtained over the Co–Rh–Mo–K/MWCNT catalyst at 330°C, 1320psig (9.1Mpa), 3.8m3 (STP)/(kg of cat./h) using H2 to CO molar ratio value of 1.25. The AC-supported Co–Rh–Mo–K catalyst had a much higher hydrocarbon formation, while the MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst showed better alcohols yield. Alkali promotion to the MoS2 catalyst reduced the crystalline nature of the catalyst and favoured the formation of alcohols. More oxidized S and Mo species were also observed by XRD and XANES in the K-promoted catalysts, indicating the formation of more Mo oxide and/or Co oxide with the addition of K, thus increasing the active sites. More intense features corresponding to the oxidized S and Mo species were observed in both S K-edge and Mo L3-edge spectra of the MWCNT-supported catalysts. The formation of Co (Rh)–Mo–S species was evident in the XANES spectra of the bimetallic and trimetallic alkali-promoted MoS2 catalysts, in agreement with their improved catalytic performance."
