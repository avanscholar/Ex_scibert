0,Introduction,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are considered prime solutions to address escalating atmospheric CO2 levels [1]. Recently, a superior and value-added alternative to CCS, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has emerged with paramount potential [2]. In CCU processes, CO2 is captured from various emission sources and utilized downstream as a renewable carbon source to produce value-added materials and chemical feedstocks [3]. While a variety of useful organic molecules can be synthesized from the captured CO2, its hydrogenative conversion can provide access to value-added fuels and feedstocks, and a promising way of storing renewable energy in chemical bonds [3e]. Among such products, methanol is an attractive chemical currently produced at an annual rate of over 100 billion liters [4]. It is a one carbon alcohol and liquid at room temperature that is easy to store, transport and dispense. Methanol is an essential building block to produce a plethora of hydrocarbon based chemicals, polymers, paints, adhesives, construction materials and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, it is an excellent clean burning drop-in fuel and a convenient liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) with a high H2 storage capacity of 12.6 wt% [5]. Traditionally, methanol is produced by the catalytic conversion of syngas, which is a mixture of mainly CO and H2 (Fig. 1 a), using commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 based heterogeneous catalysts at temperatures of 250–300 °C and pressures of 50–100 bar [4a,6]. Alternatively, CO2 can be activated by the same class of catalyst to synthesize methanol under similar operating conditions in the presence of H2. Such a CO2 to methanol process is already operating commercially at the George Olah Renewable Methanol Plant by Carbon Recycling International in Iceland. Over the years, a number of pilot and demonstration plants have also been constructed and operated by companies, research institutes and universities including Mitsui Chemicals in Japan, the Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in South Korea (CAMERE process) and more recently the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in China. Numerous commercial plants are also being planned in countries including Sweden, Australia, Norway, Germany and Canada to produce “blue” and “green” methanol with a lower carbon footprint than traditional coal and natural gas based “brown” and “grey” methanol [7]. While the current catalytic process has a high selectivity of >99% for methanol in a flow reactor, high reaction temperatures result in low CO2 conversion of about 30% per pass due to the exothermic nature of the reaction [4c,8]. To achieve higher conversions, the unreacted gas mixture after separation from the products (methanol and water), is constantly recycled back to the reactor. Furthermore, the competing reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is favored at high temperatures, typically above 250 °C, forming CO and H2O, which have detrimental effects on the catalyst. To overcome the limitations in the methanol synthesis process in gas phase, novel catalytic systems and solvent assisted liquid-phase processes have been studied at lower reaction temperatures [9]. Notably, alcohol based solvents were shown to promote the hydrogenation process as it proceeds through an energetically favorable pathway via formate ester intermediates [10]. While homogeneous catalysts in liquid phase have been shown to improve the reaction conditions effectively [11], there are limited reports of solvent assisted systems with heterogeneous catalysts. Still, the major challenge of low CO2 conversions calls for significant improvements [12]. In the scope of CCU, coupling of two threads: a) CO2 capture and b) CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, in an integrated one-pot process is highly desirable (Fig. 1b) [13]. The highlight of such systems is the reduction or elimination of the large energy and cost penalties associated with the desorption and compression steps in conventional CCS/CCU processes, which could make them economically and practically attractive. In such tandem processes, CO2 can be captured in solution using a capturing agent (amines or alkali hydroxides) under ambient conditions from relatively concentrated emission point sources as well as dilute sources such as air. The CO2 loaded solutions, without any purification and separation, are directly hydrogenated to form methanol [14]. Recently, such integrated capture and conversion processes were realized by our group and others, using homogeneous catalysts [15]. However, similar integrated systems with heterogeneous catalysts have yet to be explored. For industrial applications, heterogeneous catalysts offer major advantages in terms of ease of separation and recycling at large scale. Further, employing the non-noble metal based commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst can significantly lower the operating costs [2c,9e,9h]. As part of our ongoing research endeavor to develop practically viable and efficiently integrated CCU systems, we studied herein a liquid phase batch process using a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for methanol synthesis where the use of a glycol solvent remarkably enhanced the CO2 conversion at relatively low temperatures and with high recyclability. Furthermore, we have demonstrated as a proof of concept, the feasibility of directly converting the CO2 captured from air to CH3OH with a heterogeneous catalyst. Direct air capture (DAC) is valuable as air is the ultimate sink for all anthropogenic CO2 emissions and a sustainable carbon source. This is of particular interest for developing a circular economy based on CO2 recycling using H2 obtained from renewable energy sources [16]."
1,Results and discussion,"In our initial exploration for a suitable solvent for methanol synthesis, we studied the hydrogenation of CO2 (4 bar) with 70 bar H2 at 200 °C in a batch reactor (Fig. 2 ). With ethylene glycol, a high boiling and relatively polar alcohol, 18 mmol of CH3OH were obtained, corresponding to a 90% yield relative to CO2. It showed a marked increase of 92% from the reaction without any solvent that afforded only a 47% CH3OH yield. With di-/tri-/tetra-ethylene glycol, slightly lower yields in the range of 87–82% were obtained. Polyethylene glycol (PEG400) exhibited a relatively mild enhancement with 74% CH3OH yield. Overall, a decreasing trend in the amount of methanol with increasing chain length of the glycol solvent was thus observed, owing to a combined effect of primarily a) solvent polarity and b) ability of the alcohol to stabilize the formate species via esterification. Reactions with other high boiling alcohols such as 1,2-propanediol and 2-methoxyethanol gave significant, yet lower, CH3OH yields (78–79%). The promoting effect of alcohols in the reaction became evident as reactions in triglyme and squalene showed negligible enhancement in methanol formation when compared to a reaction without any solvent. Notably, the catalyst was found to be stable under these reaction conditions as indicated by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Figure S29). CuO peaks were not observed. The Cu0 crystallite size (12 nm) of the used catalyst was similar to that of a freshly activated catalyst. Based on the encouraging results with ethylene glycol (Table 1 , entry 1), we briefly investigated key parameters in the hydrogenation reaction. When the catalyst loading was halved to 150 mg, the CH3OH yield decreased to 78%, while increasing the loading to 450 mg had only minor effects (entry 2–3 and Figure S3). Since our reaction system was active for methanol synthesis at 200 °C which is much lower than the current gas phase commercial processes, we decided to study the reaction at an even lower temperature. At 170 °C, the catalytic system still afforded a considerable CH3OH yield of 60% (entry 4). Further, when the reaction time was shortened from the initial 72 h (entry 6–7), it was observed that 80% of the net conversion to CH3OH was achieved within 24 h (yield = 72%) with a methanol production rate of 63.6 gMeOH·kgcat −1 h−1 (Figure S2). The yield increased to 80% in 48 h. However, running the reaction for 120 h gave a CH3OH synthesis comparable to the one obtained with 72 h (entry 5), indicating that an equilibrium had been achieved. Lowering the H2 pressure to 50 bar afforded CH3OH with 71% yield (entry 8). The gas phase after reaction showed only trace amounts of CO and CH4, along with unreacted H2 and CO2 (Figure S10-S11), indicating that the RWGS reaction was significantly suppressed under our reaction conditions. CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is an equilibrium reaction and the conversions in such processes are limited by the thermodynamics. To determine the thermodynamic limit for CH3OH synthesis under our reaction conditions, equilibrium CO2 conversions were calculated by the Gibbs energy minimization models in Aspen Plus using Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state (details in Section 5 of supporting information) [18]. Remarkably, the estimated equilibrium value of 92% for the CH3OH yield by the model (CO2:H2 = 4:70 bar), was in great agreement with the highest value obtained experimentally. It is therefore a strong indication that the presence of ethylene glycol efficiently shifts the methanol yields towards the equilibrium values for CO2 conversion. As shown in Fig. 3 , similar solvent induced trends were also observed for higher CO2 partial pressure in the reactant gas feed. For CO2:H2 ratio of 1:6, 65% of the CO2 was converted to methanol in ethylene glycol with a 110% rise from the reaction without solvent. When the CO2:H2 was further increased to the stoichiometric ratio of 1:3, methanol was obtained in the glycol solvent with a 48% yield corresponding to a noteworthy rise of 120% relative to solventless conditions. The corresponding methanol production rate of 65.2 gMeOH·kgcat −1 h−1 is comparable to the highest values reported previously for similar alcohol promoted batch processes (Figure S1 and Table S1) [9a]. While a decreasing trend in the methanol yield relative to CO2 is noted with increasing initial CO2 content in the gas mixture, the promoting effect of the glycol solvent is prominent irrespective of the CO2:H2 ratio, shifting the reaction forward toward the thermodynamic limit. Subsequently, recycling of the catalyst was investigated under the optimized reaction conditions (Fig. 4 A). Effective recycling of the catalyst is considered to be a key feature for the large scale application of the process. To recycle the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, it was recovered from the reaction mixture and reused for successive hydrogenation cycles. Demonstrated over five cycles, the catalyst was found to be highly stable, and its catalytic efficiency was entirely retained with an average methanol yield of 90%. No deactivating species were detected via XRD even after the 5th cycle (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the average crystallite size of the recycled catalyst was similar to that of the freshly activated one, indicating minimal or no sintering. The effect of water on the reaction was investigated as well. The addition of water to the ethylene glycol solvent led to a decline in methanol yield (Figure S4). A drop of about 6% and 18% in methanol production was observed with a 3:1 and 1:3 ethylene glycol/water solution, respectively. Similarly, the effect of accumulation of products (CH3OH and H2O) on the catalyst performance was studied (Figure S5). Over multiple pressure refill studies, the catalyst was found to be active for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH, but with decreasing yields in each subsequent cycles [17]. Next, the catalytic system developed here was examined for its primary application in integrated capture and conversion processes. Among various sources for CO2 capture, capture from air is considered to be thermodynamically challenging, due to its extremely low CO2 concentration (currently about 420 ppm) [19]. In this regard, our group and others have previously demonstrated solution based DAC systems with various CO2 capture agents [13,20]. Notably, pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), a high boiling polyamine with low vapor pressure is highly effective for CO2 capture. Alternatively, alkali hydroxides are also attractive as amine-free CO2 adsorbents. In these studies, ethylene glycol was identified as an effective solvent for CO2 capture because of its high polarity, high boiling point and particular ability to dissolve bases as well as CO2 capture species [21]. Ethylene glycol is a green and environmentally benign solvent which can be produced from renewable feedstocks [22]. Owing to its compatibility with both DAC of CO2 and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyzed hydrogenation, an ethylene glycol assisted integrated system is highly desirable. To study the efficacy of the proposed integrated system, initially CO2 was captured in solution from a concentrated CO2 stream and further hydrogenated with H2 and the heterogeneous catalyst (Table 2 ). First, using amine as the base, 14.9 mmol of CO2 was captured by PEHA (2 g) in ethylene glycol as ammonium-carbamate/alkyl carbonate salts (entry 1). When the resulting solution was directly subjected to hydrogenation under the optimized reaction conditions, the captured CO2 efficiently converted to CH3OH with a yield of 91%. Similarly, KOH (10 mmol), a model alkali hydroxide in ethylene glycol captured a molar equivalent of CO2 as potassium alkyl carbonate (entry 3). The CO2 loaded solution was directly hydrogenated to afford a quantitative methanol yield. Finally, direct air capture was performed by bubbling indoor air through ethylene glycol solutions of the capturing agents. With PEHA, 7.0 mmol of CO2 was captured from air and efficiently converted to CH3OH with 89% yield (entry 2). Using a similar protocol, 6.6 mmol CO2 was captured by a KOH solution from air and its hydrogenation afforded a high methanol yield of 97% (entry 4). The reaction pathways and the catalytic activity for methanol synthesis from CO2 have been investigated extensively for the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [9,10,12]. In the cases of alcohol promoted processes, the hydrogenation is facilitated by the formation of formate ester as an intermediate with the alcohol additive [10]. Further hydrogenation of the formate ester is energetically favorable leading to efficient conversion to methanol. Under our reaction conditions, trace amounts of ethylene glycol monoformate, the formate ester with ethylene glycol were detected during the analysis of the post-reaction mixture (Fig. 5 A). This further validates the high promoting effects observed with ethylene glycol. In comparison to methanol synthesis from CO2 in the gas phase under pressure, investigations focusing on hydrogenation of captured CO2 species in solution using Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and their plausible reaction pathways are rare [12b]. In this context, hydrogenation of alkali hydroxide based CO2 capture species (carbonates, alkyl/bi-carbonate salts) to methanol have been extremely challenging to date across the fields of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis [13,15g]. Hence, investigations to elucidate the plausible routes for such reaction are fundamental to further develop and improve such processes. Analogous to potassium alkyl carbonate, potassium bicarbonate was also successfully hydrogenated to methanol under similar conditions in the presence of ethylene glycol (Fig. 5B). Notably, only trace methanol and potassium formate (intermediate) were detected when the reaction was carried out in the absence of the alcohol solvent (Fig. 5C). Formate salts have been synthesized previously from bicarbonates. However, further hydrogenation of alkali formates to methanol is significantly difficult [13,15g]. Similar to KHCO3, the intermediate HCOOK was also active for hydrogenation to methanol only in the presence of ethylene glycol. These results suggest that the glycol possibly facilitates the conversion of HCOOK to formate ester in situ, which allows for further hydrogenation to methanol. When ethyl formate, a representative formate ester was subjected to hydrogenation in the absence of any additional alcohol, full conversion to methanol was observed within 6 h, which indicates that the hydrogenation of formate esters is significantly more facile. The high susceptibility of a formate ester to undergo hydrogenation could also possibly explain the inability to detect the formate ester during reaction work up as such intermediate species might only be present briefly and not accumulate over the course of the reaction. Also, it is important to note that the intermediate species formed during CO2 hydrogenation in the gas phase may possibly be present under alcohol assisted conditions as well. Even in the case of amine based system, the formate species is a possible intermediate. Similar to HCOOK, the ammonium formate [HCOO]−[PEHA]+ could be hydrogenated to methanol only in the presence of ethylene glycol. This indicates that the formate ester route is the major pathway to methanol, and not the formamide based route. Additionally, CO2 sorption by amines is a reversible process and a mild temperature swing can lead to desorption of the captured CO2 [19a]. Hence, an alternate reaction pathway involving the hydrogenation of CO2 gas desorbed by the amine during the reaction is also viable."
2,Conclusions,"In conclusion, this report reveals an efficient solvent assisted process for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol using a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst operating at relatively low temperatures (170–200 °C). Compared to solventless conditions, glycol solvents displayed a remarkable increase in the CO2 conversions to methanol with a rise of up to 120%. Ethylene glycol was found to be the most efficient solvent to shift the conversions toward the equilibrium limit and a methanol yield of up to 90%. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded via the formate ester intermediate in presence of the corresponding alcohol. Notably, the catalyst was stable under the reaction conditions and was recyclable over multiple hydrogenation cycles. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of integrated direct air capture and hetero-catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol was effectively demonstrated here. The catalytic conversion of the captured CO2 was found to be facile, with significantly high methanol yields. The importance of an alcohol solvent for the hydrogenation of various CO2 capture species was validated. We believe that the present batch system when operated under flow conditions could potentially be implemented at commercial scale to enhance the industrial methanol synthesis process. Additionally, catalyst modifications, in terms of composition and method of preparation could also enhance the present system based on the commercial methanol synthesis catalyst [23]. In a worthwhile direction for the future, this system offers an easy integration with already existing CO2 scrubbing units toward a renewable and carbon neutral methanol economy."

Commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The catalyst composition (63.5 wt% CuO, 24.7 wt% ZnO, 10.1 wt% Al2O3, 1.3 wt% MgO fume) [24] provided by the manufacturer was verified via elemental analysis (Table S3) and the average surface area of the activated catalyst was measured to be 79.6 m2 g−1 cat [25]. Potassium hydroxide and pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) were purchased from Millipore Sigma and used without further purification. All solvents were purchased from commercial sources and were sparged with N2 for 1 h prior to use. DMSO-d 6 (CIL, D-99.9%), D2O (CIL, D-99.9%), imidazole (Fischer, 99.5%) and t BuOH (99%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as received. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 400, 500 or 600 MHz, Varian NMR spectrometers. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were determined relative to the residual solvent signals. The gas mixtures were analyzed using a Thermo Finnigan gas chromatograph (column: Supelco, Carboxen 1010 plot, 30 m X 0.53 mm) equipped with a TCD detector (CO detection limit: 0.099 v/v%). CO2 (Gilmore, instrument grade), 1:3 CO2:H2 mix (Airgas, certified standard-spec grade) and H2 (Gilmore, ultra-high pure grade 5.0) were used without further purification. Caution: Reactions are associated with H 2 gas. They should be carefully handled inside proper fume hoods without any flame, spark or static electricity sources nearby."
5,Standard procedure for CO2 hydrogenation reactions,"4.2 Standard procedure for CO2 hydrogenation reactions For activating the catalyst, the catalyst pellets were ground and sieved. Next, it was subjected to a flow of N2 (100 mL/min) at 120 °C for 1 h, then ramped up to 270 °C (10 °C /min) with a H2 flow (35 mL/min) in N2 (100 mL/min) at 1 atm for 5 h and stored afterwards under Ar for further use [17a]. In a nitrogen-filled chamber, the pre-activated catalyst (in a borosilicate glass vial) and the solvent (if any) were introduced to a 125 mL Monel Parr reactor. The sealed vessel was then filled to the desired pressure and composition with CO2 and H2. The reactor was placed in a preheated aluminum block and heated to the desired temperature. After heating for a given reaction period, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The vessel was then cooled in an ice bath for 30 min. Afterwards, the gases inside the vessel were partly collected in a gas sampling bag for GC analysis whereas the remaining gas was slowly released. Upon opening the reaction vessel, an aliquot of the liquid sample was collected, and a known amount of internal standard (imidazole or t BuOH) was added to it and passed through a PTFE syringe filter to avoid any trace metal impurities. The sample was then analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR with a deuterated solvent. Yields were determined through 1H or 13C NMR from integration ratios."

The gases inside the vial were then removed under vacuum. CO2 was subsequently added while stirring the solution at 800 rpm for 3 h and maintaining the CO2 pressure inside the reactor at 1 psi above atmospheric pressure. The amounts of CO2 captured were calculated through gravimetric analysis of the solutions before and after the capture.

Atmospheric air containing ∼420 ppm CO2 was then bubbled through the solution at a flowrate of 200 mL/min for 72 h using a pump. After completion of the CO2 capture, the solution volume increased by around 2 mL due to accumulation of moisture from air. The resulting solution was then sparged with N2 for 2 h. Afterwards, imidazole (Im) was added as an internal standard to 0.5 mL aliquot of the homogeneous solution that was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR with DMSO-d 6 as the deuterated solvent. The amount of CO2 captured was calculated through 13C NMR analysis. The remaining solution was used for hydrogenation."
