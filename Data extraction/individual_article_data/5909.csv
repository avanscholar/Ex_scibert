0,Introduction,"3,4-Methylenedioxybenzaldehyde, also known as 1-3-benzodioxole-5-carboxaldehyde, piperonal or heliotropine (HEL), is the basis for the heliotrope-type perfumes and is widely used for the cosmetic preparations, being also applied as intermediate for agrochemical and pharmaceutical products [1,2] (Fig. 1 ). Moreover, it is also a controlled substance being the precursor of the hallucinogen 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) [3]. Currently, HEL is mainly produced by the isomerization of safrole [4–7], isolated from the essential oil of Ocotea Cymbarum and Pretiosa trees [8], and following oxidation (chemical, electrochemical or by ozone) [9–13]. This source is getting less available and consequently more expensive, because it contributes to the exhaustion of these perennial forests, pushing the demand of industrial alternatives of synthetic HEL, that may be considered attractive for a price of natural safrole higher than 6US$/kg ca. It is noteworthy that the market of HEL remains almost stable, since the decrease of the availability of natural safrole is almost fully compensated by the direct synthesis of Heliofresh® [14], other trade name of the fragrance Helional®. Industrial processes for preparing HEL can be shared into two groups: the first starting from 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene and the second from 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde [15–18]; furthermore, a promising alternative is the production of HEL by oxidation of the corresponding 3,4-methylendioxybenzyl alcohol [or piperonyl alcohol (PA)] [19,20]. However, it is noteworthy that the oxidation with air presents relevant safety drawbacks, since operates with air in the presence of organic solvents at reflux temperature, thus an interesting alternative may be the Oppenauer's oxidation that can be performed under safe and mild reaction conditions, using either both homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts [21–25], generally obtaining high selectivity values, without the risk of oxidizing other functional groups. Corma et al. reported that the reaction proceeds via a six-member intermediate, in which both reactants are coordinated to the active site [26]. Carbonyl compounds with high oxidation potential, as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes or ketones (acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetophenone, benzaldehyde, p-benzoquinone, benzophenone, cyclohexanone, etc.) have been used as oxidants. Although acetone has a low oxidation potential, it is commonly applied, because considering its low price it can be used in large excess to shift the equilibrium towards the wished direction [27]. Aim of this paper was to shed light on a new economic and safe industrial alternative to produce HEL by Oppenauer's oxidation of PA with different heterogeneous commercial catalysts using a commercial paraformaldehyde (PFA), a cheap and widely accessible reactant [28]. As sake of comparison, the results obtained with homogeneous Al iso-propoxide catalyst have been also reported. Al iso-propoxide and ter-butoxide are commonly used as the homogeneous catalysts because of their easy preparation and good solubility in organic solvents."
1,Experimental,"3,4-Methylendioxybenzyl alcohol (piperonyl alcohol or PA), 3,4-methylendioxy benzaldehyde (heliotropine or HEL), toluene and Al iso-propoxide were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals (≥98wt.%) and used without further purification. Commercial PAF was employed without any further purification. The heterogeneous commercial zirconia-type catalysts [ZHSA and HWA-ZHSA (Millennium) and XZO 632/03 MELChemicals)] were used without any pre-treatment, while the Mg/Al commercial hydrotalcites [Pural MG 50, Pural MG 61, Pural MG 70 and HT C388 (Sasol), Hycite 713, Sorbacid 911 and Sorbacid 696 (Süd-Chemie)] were used after calcination at 723K for 8h. Commercial zeolites (Süd-Chemie and Zeolyst) were also investigated, as such or after ion exchange with different cations (Na, Cs, Ti or Zr). B.E.T. surface area values were determined by physical adsorption of N2 at 77K using a Micromeritics AUTOCHEM 2910, pre-treating the samples under vacuum at 373K for 10min to eliminate the adsorbed water. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with a Philips PW 1050/81 diffractometer (40kV, 25mA), equipped with a PW 1710 unit, and a Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154118nm). A 2θ range from 10° to 80° was investigated at a scanning rate of 0.10°/s. The catalytic tests were performed in a three-necks 250-mL flask (equipped with a stirring, a thermometer and a refrigerator connected to a Dean-Stark column) introducing at first 5.0g of PA (0.033mol), 100.0g of toluene and a catalyst amount between 10 and 50wt.% (referred to PA); then the reaction mixture was heated at 383K under stirring and about 2.5g of PAF were slowly added (PFA/PA molar ratio=2.5). The solution was maintained for the reaction time at the above temperature under stirring; finally, it was cooled, the catalyst filtered off and the solution distilled under vacuum (303K and 131.6Pa) to obtain a crude reaction product, that was analysed using a Carlo Erba 4300 gas chromatograph, equipped with FID and a wide-bore OV1 column (length 30m, i.d. 0.53mm, film width 0.5μm). The products were tentatively identified by GC–MS with a Hewlett-Packard GCD 1800 system equipped with a HP5 column (length 25m, i.d. 0.25mm, film width 1.5μm); the identifications were subsequently confirmed by comparison of the experimental GC–MS patterns with those obtained for pure reference compounds."
2,Results and discussion,"According to the literature [21,22], as sake of comparison a preliminary test was performed using Al iso-propoxide as homogeneous catalyst, that showed a very high activity reaching already after 15min almost complete PA conversion (98.1% in comparison to 99.9% after 120min), with a constant selectivity of about 99.0% in HEL (Fig. 2 ). However, Al iso-propoxide presents relevant drawbacks, first of all the requirement to eliminate carefully H2O and CH3OH from the reaction solution, because the first deactivates the catalyst forming aluminium hydroxide, while methanol forms non-active complex [29]. Furthermore, this catalyst cannot be reused, because at the end of the reaction the solution has to be added with an aqueous 1M NaOH solution to form sodium aluminate, separating the aqueous from the organic phase. Thus, to apply industrially it is necessary to consider the tedious and expensive treatment of waste water to eliminate the aluminium presence. Thus the possibility to use heterogeneous catalysts was investigated to overcome the drawbacks related to the use of homogeneous catalysts. Literature reports of many examples of different heterogeneous catalysts applied in Oppenauer's oxidation of organic substrates [23,30–36]. However, it must be noted that usually a high amount of catalyst was employed (same weight of the organic substrate), with very few examples of oxidation of benzylic alcohols, no one at our knowledge using PFA as hydrogen acceptor. At first, we tested different zeolites as such or exchanged with different cations, observing always very poor results (yield values in HEL lower than 4%), with the almost complete oligomerization of PA to heavy products before the addition of PFA. On the contrary, very interesting results were observed using zirconia-type catalysts and commercial Mg/Al hydrotalcites calcined at 723K for 8h (Table 1 ). However, Mg/Al mixed oxides required a longer reaction time (6h) to obtain comparable results and their activity was more affected by the composition of the starting hydrotalcites; in fact, best results were obtained starting from hydrotalcite with a Mg/Al molar ratio of about 2. On the contrary, the catalytic activity of zirconia-type catalysts was less influenced by composition and preparation method, similar results being obtained with catalysts supplied by different manufacturing industries. Also the zirconia-type catalysts and the Mg/Al mixed oxides obtained by calcinations of commercial hydrotalcites were very sensitive to the presence of water formed by the progressive depolimerization of PFA, that bound on the active sites; in fact, with both catalysts the conversion almost halved without water removal, while the selectivity was less affected (Fig. 3 ). On the contrary no effect was observed due to the presence of small amounts of methanol, unlike that previously reported for homogeneous Al iso-propoxide catalyst, simplifying the scale-up of the reaction. Almost no connection was observed in the range investigated between the catalytic activity of the zirconia-type catalysts and the catalyst amount, with only an increase of the reaction time for the lowest value (Table 2 ). Also the increase of the initial PA concentration in the toluene solution gave rise only to an increase of the reaction time, without any effect on the selectivity due to the by-product formation by PA oligomerization. These latter tests have been performed considering that the different industrial processes to produce PA may be economically optimized for different final concentration of the alcohol. After each cycle, the zirconia-type catalysts were simply washed by toluene and reused, maintaining a high activity for more than 40h of time-on-stream (Table 3 ); however, trying to regenerate the catalysts by calcinations at 823K for 6h, to burn the traces of heavy by-products adsorbed on the surface, a complete loss of catalytic activity was surprisingly observed. To try to understand this unusual behaviour, we checked the catalytic activity of a zirconia-type catalyst calcined for 3h at increasing temperature. Fig. 4 shows that the selectivity values start to decrease above 673K, while the conversion ones remain almost constant up to 773K, decreasing dramatically above this temperature. This trend cannot be simply correlated to the surface area values, that decrease almost linearly with the calcination temperature (with a trend similar to that observed for the selectivity), but rather with the structural change between amorphous zirconia-type hydroxide and tetragonal structure that occurs at 773K [37], evidencing a key role of surface hydroxyl groups in the reaction, probably stabilizing the six-member intermediate [26]. It is noteworthy that the sample calcined at 823K showed a residual catalytic activity, unlike that previously reported for that regenerated at the same temperature (Table 3). This difference may be attributed both to a longer calcination time (6 instead of 3h) and to possible hot spots related to the combustion of the heavy by-products. Considering the impossibility to regenerate the deactivated zirconia-type catalysts by calcination, the catalytic activity of rock-salt-type Mg/Al mixed oxides [38–40] obtained by calcination of commercial hydrotalcites was investigated more deeply. Fig. 5 shows that already after 2h a high conversion value was achieved, although 8h were required to obtain a very high selectivity in heliotropin (>97.0%). Thus Mg/Al mixed oxides showed final catalytic activities similar to those of zirconia-type catalysts, although requiring longer reaction times. This behaviour may be justified on the basis of the different reaction products identified, assuming that initially piperonyl formate, deriving from a mixed Tishchenko's reaction between one molecule of HEL formed and one of PFA, was preferentially formed (Fig. 6 ). However, this is an equilibrium reaction and increasing the reaction time the PFA excess was decomposed moving the equilibrium towards the formation of free HEL. Also the Mg/Al mixed oxides after each cycle were simply washed with toluene and reused, maintaining a high activity for about 20h of time-on-stream, i.e., for lower times than the zirconia-type catalysts previously discussed. However, unlike these latter, they can be completely regenerated by calcination at 823K for 6h, recovering the conversion values of the fresh catalysts, with only a slight decrease of selectivity (Fig. 7 ). Thus, notwithstanding their lower catalytic performances, Mg/Al mixed oxides obtained by controlled calcinations of commercial hydrotalcites appear very interesting catalysts for industrial applications, considering their low cost, wide availability, easy and almost complete regeneration. Finally, the possibility of a wider application of PFA as hydrogen acceptor in the Oppenauer's oxidation of aromatic substrates was checked feeding some benzyl alcohols containing different electron-donating or withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring (Table 4 ). It must be noted that the reaction may be applied to benzylic alcohol containing electron-donating groups (methoxy or methyl), while the conversion and the yield in the corresponding aldehyde dramatically decrease in presence of an electron-withdrawing groups, as chlorine. It is noteworthy that the activation effect occurs either for inductive (methyl group) or mesomeric effect (methoxy group). On the other hand, feeding the 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol the main by-product resulted the corresponding 4-cholorobenzoic acid [yield 18.9% in comparison to 14.1% of the 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (Table 4)], suggesting that the presence of a electron-withdrawing group as chlorine affected negatively the oxidation of the alcohol (by inductive effect), but favoured the following oxidation of the aldehyde to the carboxyilic acid by mesomeric effect. This latter may be justified considering that the carbonyl group may delocalise the negative charge deriving from the chlorine present in four position."
3,Conclusions,"The Oppenauer's oxidation of PA to HEL using PFA commercially available hydrogen acceptor represents an interesting example of economic and environmentally friendly industrial process, able to by-pass the safety drawbacks of the PA oxidation by air. By this way, it is possible to obtain very high yield values in HEL (>90%), operating in mild and safe conditions using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. It was found that Al iso-propoxide was the most suitable catalyst, allowing to achieve high selectivity values in HEL and almost complete conversion after only 15min. However, this catalyst presented many relevant economic and environmental drawbacks as deactivation by both H2O and CH3OH, the impossibility to be reused and the tedious and expensive treatment of waste water. While zeolites, as such or exchanged with different cations, gave rise always to very poor results (yield values in HEL lower than 4%), with the almost complete oligomerization of PA to heavy products, very interesting results were observed using zirconia-type catalysts and calcined commercial Mg/Al hydrotalcites, although requiring longer reaction times than the previous homogeneous catalyst. Zirconia-type catalysts resulted the most active heterogeneous catalysts, requiring only 2h to reach yield values in HEL higher than 90% and maintaining high catalytic performances for more than 40h of time-on-steam. However, these catalysts cannot be reused because during the regeneration by calcination at 823K the surface hydroxyl groups were removed irreversibly and the solid texture moved from amorphous to tetragonal one. Mg/Al mixed oxides obtained by controlled calcination of commercial hydrotalcites showed final catalytic activities similar to those of zirconia-type catalysts, although requiring longer reaction times, because initially piperonyl formate, deriving from a mixed Tishchenko's reaction between one molecule of HEL formed and one of PFA, was preferentially formed. The Mg/Al mixed oxides maintained a high activity only for about 20h of time-on-stream, i.e., for lower times than the zirconia-type catalysts, However, unlike these latter, they can be completely regenerated by calcination at 823K for 6h, recovering the conversion values of the fresh catalysts, with only a slight decrease of selectivity. Thus, notwithstanding their lower catalytic performances, Mg/Al mixed oxides obtained by controlled calcinations of commercial hydrotalcites appear very interesting catalysts for industrial applications, considering their low cost, wide availability, easy and almost complete regeneration. Finally, it is noteworthy that the described process may be applied to a wide number of substituted benzylic alcohol containing electron-donating groups, in which the activation effect may occur either for inductive (methyl group) or mesomeric effect (methoxy group). On the contrary, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, as chlorine, decreases the yield in the corresponding aldehyde, favouring its further oxidation to the acid."
