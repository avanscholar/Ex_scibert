0,Introduction,"In addition to electricity and hydrogen (H2), liquid biofuels are supposed to play an increasing role as energy carriers towards a sustainable economy contributing to reduced emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Fulton et al., 2015). Especially transportation via ships and aircraft will likely depend on renewable liquid biofuels for the replacement of kerosene and diesel in the next 50–100 years (Fulton et al., 2015; Lynd et al., 2017). One way to produce such liquid biofuels is to use microorganisms as whole-cell biocatalysts for the conversion of plant-biomass derived sugars or of synthesis gas (syngas: mainly H2; carbon monoxide, CO); CO2) (Keller et al., 2014; Takors et al., 2018). Short-chain alcohols represent target biofuels, since microorganisms are capable of producing these compounds, or may be relatively easily engineered towards their production. Microorganisms are currently already commercially used as whole-cell catalysts for the production of ethanol from corn (1st generation biofuel) and have been built for ethanol production from lignocellulolytic biomass (ETIP Bioenergy, 2019; Lynd et al., 2017). The microbial production of alcohols with longer chain lengths than ethanol, such as butanol or iso-butanol, is even more desirable, since they are closer to gasoline with regard to their hygroscopicity and energy content (Atsumi et al., 2008; Dürre, 2008; Peralta-Yahya et al., 2012). Organisms most often used for the fermentation of (biomass-derived) sugars to ethanol are yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis (Lynd et al., 2017). In both organisms, sugars are first oxidized to pyruvate, which serves as central intermediate for all ethanol fermentation pathways (Olson et al., 2015). Pyruvate is then further decarboxylated to acetaldehyde by a pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, Fig. 1 A). In some thermophilic microorganisms, pyruvate is instead oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl-coenzym A (acetyl-CoA), either by pyruvate dehydrogenase or by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Fig. 1B–C), with acetyl-CoA subsequently being reduced to ethanol (Olson et al., 2015). In this brief review, we are summarizing evidence for the importance of a fourth microbial ethanol production pathway from acetyl-CoA that involves the direct reduction of acetate to acetaldehyde. The key enzyme is a ferredoxin-(Fd)-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase, AOR (Fig. 1D), that is also involved in the in vivo reduction of other organic acids to their corresponding alcohols, with reductant from organic sources or reduced gases."
1,Biochemical properties of aldehyde:Fd oxidoreductases (AORs),"Aldehyde:Fd oxidoreductases (AORs) are oxygen-sensitive proteins, isolated from strict anaerobic microorganisms. They catalyze the reversible reduction of an organic acid with ferredoxin (Fd), a small redox-active protein, to an aldehyde (EC 1.2.7.5; Eq. (1)). (1) C a r b o x y l a t e - + F d r e d + 3 H + ⇋ a l d e h y d e + F d o x + H 2 O Inspired by the observation that resting cells of Moorella thermoacetica and Clostridium thermoaceticum catalyzed the reduction of organic acids to alcohols (Fraisse and Simon, 1988; Simon et al., 1987), the Simon group at The Technical University Munich isolated and described the AOR from Moorella thermoacetica (White et al., 1989). The enzyme has been described to occur in different subunit compositions, either as dimer or as α2β2γ2 heterotrimer (Huber et al., 1995; White et al., 1989). Since during the purification procedure, protein fractions were identified and selected by their activity to reduce organic acids to aldehydes (E0′≈ – 560 mV) (Mukund and Adams, 1991) with reduced viologens (Eq. (2), EC 1.2.99.6), the enzyme was named CAR (carboxylic acid reductase). (2) C a r b o x y l a t e - + d o n o r + 3 H + ⇋ a l d e h y d e + a c c e p t o r + H 2 O Only two years after the discovery of CAR, the first AOR from Pyrococcus furiosus was purified and biochemically characterized by the Adams laboratory at University of Georgia (Mukund and Adams, 1991). The enzyme has a broad substrate range, and oxidizes short chain aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde), branched chain aldehydes (e.g. isovalerylaldehyde) and aromatic aldehydes (phenylacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde) with methyl viologen or Fd as electron acceptor (Mukund and Adams, 1991; Roy et al., 2001) at 80 °C. Initially, the function of AOR in P. furiosus was thought to be the detoxification of aldehydes which are by-products of oxidative decarboxylation reactions in the degradation of peptides (Mukund and Adams, 1991). Interestingly, AORs are dependent on the biological element tungsten, which is not widespread in biological systems (Kletzin and Adams, 1996). There is only one example of an enzyme related to AOR that may depend on molybdenum instead of tungsten, a hydroxycarboxylate: viologen oxidoreductase from Proteus vulgaris (Trautwein et al., 1994). AOR from P. furiosus has been crystallized, and it contained a bismolybdopterin tungsten cofactor (tungstopterin) (Chan et al., 1995). The cofactor is highly similar to molybdenum cofactors of e.g. DMSO reductases, however, it lacks the nucleotide part. AOR of P. furiosus is a homodimer of 2 × 67 kDa, with each subunit containing one Fe4S4 cluster and two molybdopterin (MPT) molecules that bind a common tungsten molecule (Chan et al., 1995). A variety of other W-dependent oxidoreductases have been purified and biochemically characterized from Thermococcales, including another AOR from Thermococcus strain ES-1 (Heider et al., 1995), formaldehyde:Fd oxidoreductases (FOR) from P. furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:Fd oxidoreductase (GAPOR), and two W-containing ORs, WOR4 and WOR5. GAPOR is a W-enzyme which is part of a modified glycolytic pathway. Glycolysis in P. furiosus yields no net ATP (Mukund and Adams, 1995), but Fdred that is oxidized by an energy converting membrane bound hydrogenase (MBH). FOR is a homotetramer with activity towards formaldehyde, some other aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes as well as towards succinic semialdehyde and glutaric dialdehyde (Roy et al., 1999). While no substrate has been identified for WOR4, WOR5 oxidized a broad range of aldehydes including crotonaldehyde, hexanal, branched-chain aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes (Bevers et al., 2005). The in vivo function of WOR4 and WOR5 is not clear yet. AOR, FOR and GAPOR are very sensitive to oxygen (Roy et al., 2001). Otherwise, AOR is inhibited by cyanide, arsenite, and iodoacetate, as well as concentrations >200 μM of its substrate crotonaldehyde (Mukund and Adams, 1991). In addition to the WORs of Thermococcales, AOR has also been purified from other organisms including the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (Hagedoorn et al., 2005) and from Eubacterium limosum (Rauh et al., 2004) of the class Clostridia. Recently, a novel type and function of AOR has been described in the facultative anaerobic, nitrate reducer Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1. The strain anaerobically and aerobically degrades a broad range of aromatic substrates via the intermediate benzyl-CoA (Rabus et al., 2005). Because of its broad substrate spectrum and its enhanced expression under anaerobic growth on phenylalanine, AOR in A. aromaticum was first thought to be a substitute for the phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PDH) in the phenylalanine degrading pathway (Wöhlbrand et al., 2007). Further investigation showed that PDH activity is sufficient for growth on phenylalanine. Therefore it was suggested that, because of its broad substrate spectrum, AOR may be responsible for detoxifying high aldehyde concentrations in the cell (Debnar-Daumler et al., 2014). This was confirmed by a pdh knock out mutant which produced more AOR. In a tungsten free medium, however, AOR was replaced by the NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase AldB (Schmitt et al., 2017). AOR of A. aromaticum was just recently purified and characterized as a prototype for a new subfamily of heterohexameric (α2β2γ2) AORs in bacteria (Arndt et al., 2019). AORs in general possess a relatively broad substrate spectrum, using short-chain aliphatic aldehydes, branched-chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes and their corresponding acids (Napora-Wijata et al., 2014). Other WORs like FOR have a more specific substrate spectrum (Roy and Adams, 2002) and GAPOR, for example, preferentially utilizes only one major substrate (Roy et al., 2001). The preferred substrate of WOR4 (Roy and Adams, 2002) remains unknown. Detailed phylogenetic trees of these oxidoreductases have been calculated, revealing distinct classes, with WOR4/WOR5, GAPOR, FOR, AOR and XOR each forming separate branches (Arndt et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2015). Only recently, it discovered that the purified oxidoreductase from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii previously named XOR because of its unknown substrate (Scott et al., 2015) is in fact a novel type of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate: Fd oxidoreductase (GOR), phylogenetically distinct from the archaeal GAPORs (Scott et al., 2019). For details on the biochemical properties of AORs and other Fd-dependent oxidoreductases, we refer to the original publications listed above and to a review on the enzymology of Thermococcales’ AORs (Roy et al., 2001). In conclusion, AORs are tungsten-containing oxygen sensitive enzymes from anaerobes that catalyze a thermodynamically difficult reaction, the reduction of a variety of carboxylic acids to their corresponding aldehydes or the reverse reaction, depending on the concentrations of the reactants. Therefore, they are part of biological pathways that involve carboxylic acids and/or aldehydes, such as the oxidation of peptides, the degradation of aromatic acids or aldehydes or the production of alcohols."
2,Pathways of organic acid reduction and reactions providing the reductant,
3,Different pathways for ethanol production from pyruvate,"3.1 Different pathways for ethanol production from pyruvate As outlined in the introduction, different solutions to the production of ethanol from pyruvate have evolved among microorganisms (Olson et al., 2015), the i) PDC-ADH pathway, ii) the PDH-ALDH-ADH the iii) POR-ALDH-ADH pathway and iv) the (POR-)AOR-ADH pathway (Fig. 1). The key enzyme in sugar to ethanol fermentation is pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) catalyzing decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, without the more oxidized intermediate acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) (Fig. 1A). Acetaldehyde is then further reduced to ethanol by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). In contrast, the initial decarboxylation in all other three pathways is oxidative, i.e. involves the formation of acetyl-CoA and the reduction of an electron carrier. In the PDH-ALDH-ADH pathway, NAD+ serves as electron acceptor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; Fig. 1B), a pathway realized in Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius (Cripps et al., 2009). In strict anaerobes, Fd is used instead of NAD+ as electron acceptor, in a reaction catalyzed by pyruvate:Fd oxidoreductase (POR, Fig. 1 C and D). The intermediate acetyl-CoA is then either further reduced to acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in pathways ii) and iii); or further converted to acetate via phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase in the AOR-ADH pathway (Fig. 1D). The performances of different microorganisms catalyzing ethanol formation form pyruvate has been summarized recently (Olson et al., 2015), and is not subject to this review."
4,Different pathways for organic acid reduction,"3.2 Different pathways for organic acid reduction The PDC-ADH pathway neither involves acetyl-CoA nor acetate as intermediate, thus, it does not enable the direct reduction of organic acids. An organic acid, acetate, as intermediate occurs in the AOR-ADH pathway only (Fig. 2 A). Hence, the presence of AOR may allow organisms to use organic acids as electron acceptors other than acetate (Table 1 ), depending on the substrate spectrum of AOR and ADH. Less obviously, in principle also the (POR/PDH-) ALDH-ADH pathway allows the reduction of organic acids, since these may be phosphorylated in an ATP-dependent reaction, and the acyl-phosphate ester may then be further converted to the corresponding acyl-CoA ester (Fig. 2B), but to our knowledge, direct involvement of these enzymes in organic acid reduction has not yet been proven experimentally. The same chemistry, however, is established in aerobic microorganisms (Napora-Wijata et al., 2014), e.g. in some fungi like Neurospora crassa. The organism contains a different enzyme, carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) that catalyzes the ATP-dependent and NADPH-dependent reduction of carboxylic acids to the corresponding aldehydes (Fig. 2C). Its occurrence, biochemistry and substrate spectrum has been extensively reviewed, and we refer to the reviews for further information (Napora-Wijata et al., 2014; Winkler, 2018)."
5,Reactions providing reductant for organic acid reduction,"3.3 Reactions providing reductant for organic acid reduction A common feature of all pathways is that they require reductant, for the reduction of i) an acyl-ester (e.g. acetyl-CoA) or ii) an organic acid and iii) acetaldehyde (Figs. 1 and 2). Obviously, the PDC-ADH pathway needs only two reducing equivalents, since acetaldehyde is the product of PDC. In the other three pathways, acetaldehyde is the product of a first reduction reaction, therefore, more reducing equivalents are needed. Despite their different chemical properties, acetyl-CoA and acetate share the same oxidation state, i.e. the same number of reducing equivalents is needed for their reduction to acetaldehyde. The type of reductant needed is different though. In principle, the AOR-ADH pathway requires Fdred in a 1:1 ratio with reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotides (NADH or NADPH), while the pathways involving ALDH only require NADH or NADPH. Briefly mentioned, in the POR-ALDH-ADH pathway, this is a problem, since Fdred provided by POR needs to be re-oxidized and additional NADH is required (Hitschler et al., 2018), but we will not discuss this in detail here. On the contrary, the POR-AOR-ADH pathway may be redox-balanced, as NAD(P)H may be provided by glycolysis and Fdred by POR. As described above, the standard redox potential (Thauer et al., 1977) of the NAD+/NADH pair (E0′ = –320 mV, E′ = –280 mV based on physiological concentrations) is not low enough to allow the direct reduction of an organic acid, but only of an acyl-CoA, therefore, Fdred is needed as electron donor for AORs. Similar to the discrimination of the source of reductant for lithotrophic vs. organotrophic microbial growth, the metabolism of organic acid reduction may be categorized by the source of reducing equivalents (Table 2 ). Some organisms oxidize organic compounds, e.g. sugars, potentially derived from plant biomass, through glycolysis and POR to provide reduced nicotinamide adenine cofactors (NADH or NADPH) and Fdred, respectively (Hitschler et al., 2018). In general, nicotinamide adenine cofactors are common in catabolism of organotrophic anaerobes involved in organic acid reduction, therefore a variety of different reactions and pathways may provide either the needed NADH or NADPH, while reactions providing Fdred are scarce, likely due to its much lower redox potential in anaerobes (E0′ ≈ – 450 mV to 500 mV) (Park et al., 1991; Schuchmann and Müller, 2014). As mentioned above, one reaction that provides Fdred is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA catalyzed by POR (Fig. 3 A). A second reaction described to obtain Fdred during sugar oxidation is the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) directly to 3-phosphoglycerate by a Fd-dependent oxidoreductase (GAPOR, E.C. 1.2.7.6, Fig. 3B) (Braesen et al., 2014; Mukund and Adams, 1995) or by a novel type of bacterial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate oxidoreductase (GOR) (Scott et al., 2019) as described above. These enzymes, however, are not widespread among anaerobes, and only described in thermophilic archaea (Braesen et al., 2014) and the bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (Scott et al., 2019), respectively. Other organisms use inorganic sources of reductant. CO is a gas with a very low redox potential, and its oxidation to CO2 (E0′ CO2/CO = –558 mV) by a special nickel-dependent enzyme, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH, Fig. 3C) (Ragsdale, 2007), is coupled to the reduction of Fd. H2 also provides reductant for the reduction of Fd, either by soluble or membrane-bound hydrogenases. The redox potential of H2 oxidation (E0′ = – 414 mV) is thermodynamically not low enough to drive Fd reduction alone under physiological conditions. However, an electron-bifurcating hydrogenase, originally described as electron-confurcating hydrogenase HydABC in the fermentative H2-producing hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Schut and Adams, 2009), provides Fdred in addition to NADH (Schuchmann and Müller, 2012). In flavin-based electron bifurcation, recently discovered in anaerobes (Buckel and Thauer, 2018), in principle, the electrons from H2 divert into higher-potential electrons (in case of the electron-bifurcating hydrogenase to reduce NAD+ to NADH) and lower-redox potential electrons to drive Fd reduction (Fig. 3D) (Müller et al., 2018). Fdred may also be provided by a NAD-dependent Fd NADPH Oxidoreductase (NfnAB), with the reaction depending on NADPH as electron carrier (Fig. 3E) (Buckel and Thauer, 2018). Of course, this NADPH needs to be provided by oxidation of another substrate, thus, Nfn can be considered as a redox carrier balancing module. Membrane-bound enzymes such as energy-converting hydrogenases (Ech, Fig. 3F) (Welte et al., 2010) or the Rnf complex (Fig. 3G) provide Fdred under the expense of the electrochemical membrane potential (Biegel and Müller, 2010), with protons or ions being channeled back into the cytoplasm. Finally, it may just be remarked that, cathode oxidation may ultimately provide electrons instead of H2 or CO to chemolithoautotrophs (Fig. 3H), a concept called electrosynthesis (Nevin et al., 2011). The reductant is likely either provided in form of small reduced molecules (carriers) such as H2 or formate, or electrons may be taken up directly. It remains to be elucidated how this direct electron uptake can be coupled to Fd reduction."
6,Microbially-catalyzed organic acid reduction involving AOR,"As describe above, AORs may be categorized due to their biochemical properties, and microorganisms harboring AORs differ in their metabolism, except for all being anaerobes. In the following, we describe the microbial species for which evidence has been presented that AOR may be involved in the reduction of organic acids to their corresponding alcohols of commercial interest. These microorganisms (or respective genetically engineered strains) may be exploited as whole-cell biocatalysts, and therefore, they are compared according to their physiological properties, their alcohol production rates, titers and efficiencies, and their substrate range. That said, AOR is or may be also involved in syngas fermentation to ethanol or higher alcohols. While we describe the evidence of the AOR-ADH pathway in acetogens, and their ability to use CO or H2 as electron donor, we do not focus on the de novo synthesis of alcohols (especially to ethanol) here. Instead we refer to the extensive recent literature on the biotechnological potential and limitations of syngas fermentation (Abubackar et al., 2011; Bengelsdorf et al., 2016a; Molitor et al., 2017)."
7,Moorella thermoacetica (f. Clostridium thermoaceticum),"4.1 Moorella thermoacetica (f. Clostridium thermoaceticum) Moorella thermoacetica is a thermophile (TOPT 55 °C) that was isolated in 1942 from horse manure. It was initially described as chemoorganoheterotroph (Fontaine et al., 1942), converting 1 mol of glucose (and other sugars) to 3 mols of acetate (homoacetate fermentation). Two mols of acetate plus two mols of CO2 and 8 reducing equivalents [H] are produced from glucose oxidation. The third mol of acetate is then produced by CO2 reduction via the reductive acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway. The biochemistry of this pathway has been revealed in M. thermoacetica using 14C-tracer experiments, carried out by Harland Wood and Lars G. Ljungdahl and coworkers (Drake and Daniel, 2004; Ljungdahl, 1986; Wood et al., 1986). This reductive acetyl-CoA or Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), in addition to other enzymes such as a hydrogenase enables the organism to also grow acetogenically on CO2 + H2 or on CO + CO2 as a chemolithoautotroph, which was discovered only about 50 years later (Daniel et al., 1990). M. thermoacetica is also one of the first organisms described to reduce organic acids to their corresponding aldehydes (Simon et al., 1987). In experiments with resting cells of M. thermoacetica, a variety of aliphatic (acetate, propionate, butyrate), branched chain carboxylic acids (e.g. 2-methyl-butenoate) and carboxylic acids with aromatic groups (e.g. 2-methylphenylpropionate) were reduced to their corresponding alcohols in the presence of methyl viologen as electron carrier and CO as reductant. Under the assumption that the experiments were all performed in small 3 ml volume glass vials, e.g. 1-propanol was formed at a productivity of 13 mM h–1 (0.8 g L–1 h–1) at 50 °C by 80 mg of cells (Table 2). When it was found that the thermophilic M. thermoacetica metabolizes saturated and unsaturated carboxylates to alcohols with aldehydes as intermediate, questions about the enzyme catalyzing the reduction from aldehyde to alcohol, first came up (Simon et al., 1987). In 1992, two forms of AOR from M. thermoacetica were isolated and characterized, one dimer and one trimer, as one of the first AORs (Strobl et al., 1992; White et al., 1989). Interestingly, the genome of M. thermoacetica encodes three AORs (Moth_0154, Moth_2300, Moth_0722), and their in vivo function remains to be elucidated (Pierce et al., 2008). M. thermoacetica is considered a model acetogenic bacterium (Schuchmann and Müller, 2014). It is also studied towards a biotechnological application, e.g. for conversion of syngas (Kimura et al., 2016) or plant-biomass-derived sugars (Ehsanipour et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2017). M. thermoacetica is one of the few acetogens that are genetically accessible (Kita et al., 2013). In 2017, Rahuya et al. constructed a genetically engineered M. thermoacetica strain to ferment sugars from a lignocellulose hydrolysate efficiently to ethanol (1.9 mol mol–1) (Rahayu et al., 2017). Due to its ability to utilize syngas, the presence of an organic acid reducing pathway and its genetic accessibility, M. thermoacetica is a promising candidate for future genetic engineering towards 2nd and 4th generation biofuels."
8,Clostridium formicoaceticum,"4.2 Clostridium formicoaceticum Clostridium formicoaceticum was first described in 1970 and was isolated from a sewage plant near Göttingen, Germany (Andreesen et al., 1970). C. formicoaceticum grows at 37 °C on a variety of carbon substrates including fructose. Unlike M. thermoacetica (Fontaine et al., 1942), which it has often been compared to, it is unable to grow at 52 °C (Andreesen et al., 1970) and it is unable to use glucose and also CO2 + H2 as substrates. Resting cells of C. formicoaceticum catalyzed the reduction of short to medium chain aliphatic organic acids (ethanol-caprinate), branched chain (e.g. 2-methylbutenoate) and aromatic (e.g. benzoate) carboxylic acids (Tables 1 and 2). Alcohols were formed at relatively high rates in the presence of CO as electron donor. In a small incubation volume with 65 mg cells in a 3 ml glass vial, for example, 250 μmol of 1-propanol were formed. This corresponds to a titer of 5.0 g L–1, formed at a rate of 55 μmol h–1, approximately corresponding to 1.1 g L–1 h–1 (Fraisse and Simon, 1988). This is similar to the rate observed in the related M. thermoacetica (Table 2). In some properties, the resting cells of C. formicoaceticum differed in organic acid reduction from those of M. thermoacetica (White et al., 1991), e.g. methyl viologen inhibited the reduction of propionate with CO in C. formicoaceticum, whereas it increases the rate in M. thermoacetica (Fraisse and Simon, 1988). AOR of C. formicoaceticum has been purified and characterized as a tungsten containing homodimer that exhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (White et al., 1991). As the cell suspension still formed alcohols when membrane fractions were absent, a direct reduction of the carboxylate without ATP activation (potentially via AOR) seemed likely (Fraisse and Simon, 1988). The involvement of a low molecular weight factor (potentially Fd) was suspected since a fraction >30 kDa was not able to reduce the organic acid unless methyl viologen was added (Fraisse and Simon, 1988). Direct genetic evidence of the involvement of one of its AORs in organic acid reduction is missing yet. Recently, the genome sequence of C. formicoaceticum was obtained and it revealed multiple genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases and two aldehyde oxidoreductases (Bao et al., 2018). Their physiological role remains to be elucidated. Astonishingly few recent studies towards the ability of this organism to produce alcohols from renewable energy carriers have been published."
9,Pyrococcus furiosus,"4.3 Pyrococcus furiosus The first direct proof for the involvement of AOR in organic acid reduction was brought forward by genetic experiments in the marine hyperthermophilic archaeon P. furiosus. The organism was isolated in 1986 from geothermally heated marine sediments at the beach of Porto di Levante. Its optimal growth temperature was determined as 100 °C (Fiala and Stetter, 1986). P. furiosus is a chemoorganotroph that either oxidizes sugars and peptides with sulfur as electron acceptor, or it ferments sugars to only CO2, H2 and acetate as sole metabolic products (Sapra et al., 2003). Unlike M. thermoacetica and C. formiaceticum, it is a non-acetogen. Cells of wild type P. furiosus have been reported early to catalyze the efficient reduction of low concentrations of organic acids in the presence of sugars as electron donors (van den Ban et al., 1999v). Later, it was shown that cell extracts of P. furiosus reduce a variety of organic acids at 40 °C under an atmosphere of H2 or CO (5 bar) (Ni et al., 2012, 2014). While it was not experimentally addressed which enzymes were involved in hydrogen or carbon monoxide oxidation or in alcohol production, the authors already suspected AOR was involved in the observed reduction of the organic acids. Since 2011, P. furiosus is genetically accessible (Lipscomb et al., 2011) and it has been engineered to produce lactate (Basen et al., 2012), 3-hydroxypropionate (Keller et al., 2013), ethanol and other alcohols (Basen et al., 2014; Keller et al., 2015) from sugars at around 70 °C, which is ˜30 °C below its temperature optimum. To generate a strain that produces ethanol form sugars at reasonable yields and productivities, initially, a strain with the ALDH-ADH for ethanol production (Fig. 1C) pathway was created by insertion of adhE from Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514. This only led to a slightly higher ethanol production than in the wild type (Basen et al., 2014). However, it was later shown that inserting adhE of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus in addition to adhA from Thermoanaerobacter sp. × 514 increased the ethanol titer from 1 mM to 4 mM (Keller et al., 2017). Interestingly, the ability of P. furiosus to reduce organic acids to their corresponding alcohols was discovered by chance - a control strain (strain A) carrying only the alcohol dehydrogenase adhA gene from Thermoanaerobacter sp. with a high yield and at a high rate, compared to the wild type. Since the P. furiosus is missing an aldehyde dehydrogenase, the authors suspected a direct reduction of acetate to acetaldehyde via the native AOR, and a further reduction of the acetaldehyde to ethanol via AdhA, similar to what had been proposed before (Ni et al., 2012, 2014). Experimental evidence was finally brought forward by deletion of aor in P. furiosus strain A. The mutant strain only produced minimal production of ethanol, therefore AOR was essential for alcohol production in P. furiosus strain A. P. furiosus strain A produced ethanol, butanol, propanol, isobutanol, 1-pentanol, isoamylalcohol, 1-hexanol and phenylethanol from aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. E.g. about 25 mM isobutanol and 30 mM butanol (1.9 g L–1 and 2.2 g L−1, respectively) were produced by growing cells, correspondingly. Resting cells catalyzed the reduction of butyrate to butanol with reductant from the oxidation of a sugar at a rate of 0.34 mmol L−1 gProt or a productivity of approximately 0.5 mM h–1 (˜0.04 g L–1 h–1). Since P. furiosus naturally has no AdhA, it is questionable which function AOR has in the wild type (Basen et al., 2014), potentially it detoxifies aldehydes that accumulate in amino acid metabolism (Mukund and Adams, 1991). Even more interestingly, a 16-gene operon encoding a membrane-bound CODH from the related species Thermococcus onnurineus was produced in strain A, making P. furiosus a carboxydotroph (Schut et al., 2016). Cell suspensions resulting strain A/CODH reduced ˜70 mM isobutyrate with CO as sole electron donor, and while the efficiency was not tested, isobutanol was formed stoichiometrically, at an estimated productivity of 1 mM h–1 or 0.07 g L–1 h–1 (Table 2). In conclusion, the P. furiosus strains represent the first successful metabolic engineering towards bio-fuel production in the domain Archaea. It remains to be elucidated whether its performance may be improved towards higher volumetric or specific productivities."
10,Clostridium ljungdahlii,"4.4 Clostridium ljungdahlii Clostridium ljungdahlii is a mesophilic gram-positive acetogenic bacterium (Table 1), able to grow autotrophic on CO and CO2 + H2, but also on sugars like xylose, fructose and glucose, naturally producing acetic acid and ethanol (Tanner et al., 1993). With revelation of the whole genome (Köpke et al., 2010) and the presentation of an genome-scale metabolic network (Nagarajan et al., 2013), possible targets for genetic engineering with the goal of improved ethanol production (Nagarajan et al., 2013) and butanol production were identified (Köpke et al., 2010). Since the organism is also one of the few acetogens that is genetically accessible (Leang et al., 2013), strains have been created that produce butyrate (Ueki et al., 2014) and butanol (Köpke et al., 2010). Köpke et al. were able to detect butanol in the mid exponential growth phase (2 mM butanol), which was converted to butyrate later. Further genetic engineering could improve butanol formation, especially when conversion to butyrate is prevented. Other constructed or adapted strains are able to produce isoprene (Diner et al., 2018), grow prototrophically (Annan et al., 2019), or in presence of cyanide (Oswald et al., 2018). C. ljungdahlii reduced propionic acid, n-butyric acid, n -valeric acid, n-caproic acid, or isobutyric acid to their corresponding alcohols. Butyric acid was converted with >90% efficiency, with a titer of 13.3 mM (˜1 g L–1), in the presence of artificial syngas (Perez et al., 2013) (Table 2). Considering a culture volume of 68.4 mL, a production of 0.3 m mol in 90 h corresponds to 0.06 mM h–1 (7.4 mg L–1 h–1). This rate seems low, even compared to P. furiosus, however, it has been catalyzed by cells growing on syngas, not by concentrated cell suspensions or resting cells. Some experiments have been performed towards the role of AOR in C. ljungdahlii. Its genome encodes three putative AORs, all of them are predicted to use the protein Fd as redox partner. One of the AORs (CLJU_c24130) of C. ljungdahlii is more expressed and more active in medium with 8% oxygen than in medium without O2 and therefore likely contains molybdenum whereas the other two probably contain tungsten (Whitham et al., 2015). Some authors report higher AOR levels with increased acid concentration (Xie et al., 2015) indicating a role of AORs in acid reduction. A recent study of the differential proteome in the acidogenic vs. the solventogenic phase delivered indirect evidence for the involvement of AOR, since the enzyme is always present at a high level, while no ALDH was detected in significant amounts (Richter et al., 2016). Taken together, C. ljungdahlii is a well-studied model acetogen that is capable of reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols. It is subjected to genetic engineering, therefore higher alcohol titers and rates, or new products formed from syngas may be achieved soon. For example, it was recently achieved in a CRISPRi approach to produce and improve titers of 3-hydroxybutyrate, with a possible involvement of AOR (Woolston et al., 2018)"
11,Clostridium autoethanogenum,"4.5 Clostridium autoethanogenum In 1994, Clostridium autoethanogenum strain JA1-1 was isolated on CO as sole energy and carbon source from rabbit feces. It is a mesophilic, acetogenic gram-positive bacterium related to C. ljungdahlii that metabolizes CO or CO2 + H2 to ethanol and acetate (Abrini et al., 1994), with small amounts of 2,3-butanediol and lactate (Köpke et al., 2011). C. autoethanogenum JA1-1 is interesting for biotechnological application and is continuously optimized in terms of media composition, pH value and genetics (Abubackar et al., 2015a, 2015b; Guo et al., 2010; Liew et al., 2016, 2017) for a maximal ethanol production, with minimal unwanted by-products. 0.867 g/L ethanol was produced on 100% CO, continuously fed, and acetic acid was not a by-product at pH 4.75, whereas at pH 6.0 higher amounts of ethanol were formed (0.908 g/L), but acetic acid was formed in similar amounts (0.911 g/L) (Abubackar et al., 2015a). C. autoethanogenum encodes two putative AORs, which are highly expressed during growth on CO. High AOR activity was measured with cell-extract grown on CO2 + H2, (Mock et al., 2015) which indicates that AOR might have an essential role in ethanol formation. In 2017, knock out mutants of aor1 and aor2 were constructed and it was shown that the deletion of aor2 led to an increased ethanol production (170% on CO, compared to wild type), and that with knockout of both aor genes, C. autoethanogenum was no longer able to produce 1-propanol and 1-butanol from corresponding acids. In comparison, the wild type produces 20.9 mM 1-propanol (1.3 g L−1) and 6.0 mM 1-butanol (0.4 g L−1) (Table 2). This confirmed the hypothesis that AOR is involved in organic acid reduction into corresponding alcohol. Additionally, it was shown that deletion of adhE also leads to an 154–183 % improved ethanol production under autotrophic conditions compared to the wild type (Liew et al., 2017). Currently, strains of C. autoethanogenum are being developed as industrial biocatalysts by the company LanzaTech, Inc (Skokie, IL, USA)."
12,Clostridium carboxidivorans,"4.6 Clostridium carboxidivorans In 2005, Clostridium carboxidivorans was isolated from sediment from an agricultural settling lagoon through its growth with CO as substrate. C. carboxidivorans is a gram-positive, acetogenic bacterium and produces acetate, ethanol, butyrate and butanol as end-products of its metabolism. It is able to grow with CO, CO2 + H2, and different sugars like glucose, galactose, fructose and xylose (Liou et al., 2005). Different approaches regarding media-, pH-, temperature- and cultivation-optimization (Doll et al., 2018; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Phillips et al., 2015; Ramió-Pujol et al., 2014, 2015; Shen et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016) with the goal of improved alcohol production were followed. Since AORs active site potentially may contain molybdenum instead of tungsten, Phillips et al. suspected AOR involvement in alcohol production by C. carboxidivorans when they found increased molybdate concentrations to enhance production of end-products like butanol and hexanol (Phillips et al., 2015). As mentioned above, the biochemical evidence for Mo-dependent AORs is very limited; on the contrary, the incorporation of molybdenum instead of tungsten into aldehyde oxidoreductases of P. furiosus inactivated the enzymes (Sevcenco et al., 2010). In 2015, the genome sequence of C. carboxidivorans was published (Li et al., 2015), and it contained one gene encoding aor (Ccar12725). Recently, overexpression of aor, adhE2 (and aor or adhE2 together with fnr from Clostridium acetobutylicum) on glucose and syngas was achieved (Cheng et al., 2019). Overexpression of aor or adhE led to improved ethanol production on glucose. On syngas, the adhE overexpression led to increased alcohol production as well, whereas aor overexpression had no significant effect, possibly because aor is already highly expressed during autotrophic growth (Cheng et al., 2019). AOR of C. carboxidivorans has not yet been isolated and described, therefore there is little to no information regarding structure, substrates and activity available. Direct evidence for the involvement of AOR in ethanol production from sugars or syngas is missing yet."
13,Clostridium ragsdalei,"4.7 Clostridium ragsdalei Clostridium ragsdalei was isolated by Huhnke et al. and described as acetogenic bacteria, able to produce ethanol and acetate from CO and was adapted to grow at ethanol-concentrations up to 50 g/L (Huhnke et al., 2008). Later, more substrates were identified and it is now known to produce 2,3-butanediol and small amounts of lactate (Köpke et al., 2011). It can metabolize propionic acid and butyric acid into their corresponding acids (Perez et al., 2013), and reduces pentanoic and hexanoic acid to 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol with CO as reductant. Additionally acetone is converted to 2-propanol and isopropanol. Resting cells produced 1-propanol was produced up to a titer of 29 mM (2-propanol 60 mM), corresponding to 1.7 g L–1, with 97% efficiency, and at a productivity of 0.15 mM h–1 (0.01 g L–1 h–1) (Isom et al., 2015). The genome of C. ragsdalei encodes one AOR with sequence homology to AORs from C. ljungdahlii and C. carboxidivorans, and AOR activity was confirmed with methyl viologen as electron donor and acceptor in cell-free extracts (Isom et al., 2015). Indirect evidence for the involvement of AOR stems from 13C NMR studies that reveal that acetyl-CoA is likely not an intermediate in ethanol formation from sugars (Isom et al., 2015). As reported above, C. ragsdalei is relatively similar to C. ljungdahlii in its properties to utilize CO and organic acids, and may be developed as biocatalyst."
14,Sporomusa ovata,"4.8 Sporomusa ovata Sporomusa ovata is a mesophilic H2-utilizing acetogen that has been isolated from sugar beet leaf silage in Göttingen, Germany (Möller et al., 1984). Recently, a 2.9 × increase in ethanol yield during growth on CO2+H2 (80/20 v/v, 1.7 bar) was documented from a culture augmented with 10 × tungstate (Ammam et al., 2016). Since AOR are tungstate-dependent enzymes, the authors speculated on a function of AOR and a W-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH), an important enzyme of CO2-fixation through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Schuchmann and Müller, 2014). Six potential AORs are annotated in the Sporomusa ovata genome, and two of them were significantly upregulated when the tungstate concentration was increased by a factor of ten (0.1 μM vs. 0.01 μM). Additionally, the authors tested whether the organism would reduce organic acids to alcohols. Indeed, propionate was reduced to propanol and butyrate was reduced to 1-butanol with H2, and the conversion efficiency improved with 10 × tungstate. The titers (1.7 mM / 0.1 g L–1 propanol and 1.1 mM / 0.08 g L–1 1-butanol), conversion efficiencies (33% and 22%) and volumetric productivities are quite low (0.26 mg L–1 h–1 propanol or 0.21 mg L–1 h–1 butanol) (Table 2), which may be due to H2 as single reductant."
15,Thermoanaerobacter spp,"4.9 Thermoanaerobacter spp Thermoanaerobacter strains are thermophilic chemoorganoheterotrophic fermenters that are well-known to produce ethanol at very high yields, with one exception, the acetogen Thermoanaerobacter kivui (Basen and Müller, 2017; Leigh et al., 1981). Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200 produces 1.8 mol ethanol per 1 mol glucose (Wiegel and Ljungdahl, 1981), for example. It had been described before that T. pseudethanolicus produced 2-propanol from acetone, (Burdette et al., 2002). Since AOR is becoming more interesting regarding its role in alcohol production from carboxylic acids (Basen et al., 2014), it was investigated, if there are Thermoanaerobacter species with aor genes. Five species were found to have an aor gene similar to that of P. furiosus, namely Thermoanaerobacter brockii spp. finnii strain AKo-1, Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter sp. Strain X513, X514 and X561 (Hitschler et al., 2018). Thermoanaerobacter brockii spp. finnii strain AKo-1, Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 indeed produced short-chain alcohols from their corresponding organic acids (e.g. isobutyrate and propionate). Concentrated suspensions containing 10 × the amount of cells of a late exponential culture of Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 (1–2 mg mL–1) produced up to 43 mM isobutanol (3.2 g L–1) from isobutyrate, with glucose as electron donor, with a carbon recovery of >85% (Table 2). The productivity and rate of isobutanol production by these concentrated cell suspensions of Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 (5 mM h–1; 0.4 g –1 h–1) and T. brockii spp. finnii (Hitschler et al., 2018) are in the range of those observed in M. thermoacetica. Growing cells of Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 produced isobutanol and ethanol concomitantly at a productivity of 1.3 mM–1 h–1 (0.1 g L–1 h–1 and 0.06 g L–1 h–1), which is higher than e.g. observed for C. ljungdahlii (Perez et al., 2013). Regarding the role of AOR, Hitschler et al. found, that strains with aor encoded in the genome also exhibited AOR activity; and in these strains, alcohol was formed with a higher productivity. As this points towards a role of AOR, it is no direct evidence, and the question remains to what extend AOR contributes to alcohol production from carboxylic acids (Hitschler et al., 2018). While Thermoanaerobacter perform well in the conversion of organic acids to alcohols and sugar to ethanol, it may be interesting for a future biotechnological application to genetically engineer them for the breakdown of abundant natural polymers, e.g. of crystalline cellulose, or to engineer them to utilize syngas."
16,Other bacterial strains,"4.10 Other bacterial strains Other bacterial strains may be able to produce ethanol and/or other alcohols from carboxylic acids in which AOR might be involved in the pathway. Some potential candidates are Alkalibaculum bacchi strains CP11, CP13 and CP15, able to produce ethanol from syngas via the acetyl-CoA-Pathway (Liu et al., 2012), Butyribacterium methylotrophicum which produces acetate, butyrate and butanol from CO via WLP (Bengelsdorf et al., 2016b; Grethlein et al., 1991), and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum (Richter et al., 2012) (Table 2), producing n-butanol from n-butyrate, with reducing equivalents from sugars."
17,Conclusion and outlook,"Recently, the conversion of organic acids to their corresponding alcohols received attention, due to the need for biofuels. Alcohols also serve as ingredients of and as precursors for chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Only lately, direct proof was brought forward in strict anaerobes for the direct reduction of the organic acids to alcohols involving AOR. More recent studies reveal that the AOR-ADH pathway is more widespread in nature than previously assumed, and especially used by anaerobic Clostridia that utilize reduced gases. In conclusion, we anticipate further evidence for the natural occurrence of the AOR-ADH pathway, and a variety of applications in the production of alcohols from acids, with reductant from organic compounds or from syngas."
