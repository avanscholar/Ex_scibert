0,Introduction,"Ever since Honda and Fujishima demonstrated the first photo-assisted electrochemical splitting of water [1], the interest in photocatalysis has been boosted, also because of the increasing social concern about energy supply and environmental issues. Various strategies have been developed toward highly efficient photocatalysts, such as heteroatom doping of the semiconductor [2], surface modifications [3], down-scaling to the nanometer regime [4] as well as the coupling of the photocatalyst with a co-catalyst, photosensitizer, or a charge acceptor [5–7]. Beside the electronic nature of the semiconductor, the extent and accessibility of the surface area of the photocatalyst remains a limiting parameter that affects the catalytic rate. Microporous and mesoporous materials generally offer large surface areas and direct access to the active sites. Popular examples for microporous photocatalysts include hierarchical porous materials and zeolites, etc [8,9]. In addition, mesostructuring has recently become a powerful tool toward advancing photocatalysts. As an example, the introduction of 3D interconnected mesoporous networks into transition metal oxide films has greatly enhanced their photocatalytic performance by eliminating kinetic restrictions imposed by reactant diffusion to the active sites [10]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great research interest due to their extremely high specific surface areas along with open, interconnected microporous structures. The unique properties including large surface area and porosity, high content of transition metals, and a possibility to be designed and modified after the synthesis, have further made semiconducting MOFs of interest for photocatalytic applications. These include organic transformations [11–13], water splitting [14,15] and CO2 reduction [16–19]. Moreover, compared to typical inorganic semiconductors, where photoexcitation often results in electrons and holes residing on metal cation and oxygen anion sites, respectively, the dominant ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) mechanism has endowed semiconducting MOFs with intrinsically much lower charge recombination rates and thus longer charge lifetimes, making them ideal candidates for light energy conversion applications [20–23]. Among the studied photocatalytic MOFs, Ti-based MOFs have drawn attention because of the following merits: a) the small ionic radius of Ti4+ yields a strong Ti-O bonding; b) the high coordination number of Ti4+ increases the structural diversity of the metal-oxo clusters; c) the reversible redox transition between Ti4+/Ti3+ under photo-excitation enables the Ti-based MOFs to store charge effectively. The MIL-125-Ti compound has been reported in 2009 as the first crystalline porous carboxylate-based Ti-MOF [24]. Various strategies have since been endeavored to exploit its photocatalytic potential, including functionalization of the ligand and combination of the MOF with semiconductors (forming heterojunctions), noble metal nanoparticles or metal complexes for CO2 reduction, alcohol oxidation, H2 production as well as dye degradation [20,25–28]. Among them, ligand tuning has been considered as a feasible and efficient strategy. For instance, when the organic ligand of MIL-125-Ti – terephthalic acid (H2BDC) – is grafted with an amine group, becoming 2-amino terephthalic acid (NH2BDC), an isostructural MOF, the so-called NH2-MIL-125, can be obtained. The amine group in the organic ligand serves as a chromophore resulting in the band gap narrowing from about 3.7 eV in MIL-125-Ti to about 2.7 eV in NH2-MIL-125-Ti, enabling visible light utilization [29–34]. However, although ligand tuning has become a feasible strategy to prepare visible-light active MOF photocatalysts [35–39], little attention has been paid to the overall influences introduced by ligand variation. Specifically, NH2-MIL-125-Ti has an undebatable advantage over MIL-125-Ti in light absorption, but does this superior absorption directly manifest in a better photocatalytic performance? Are other characteristics of the framework – such as its stability or ability to separate and store the charge carriers – affected by the ligand exchange? After careful evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, we could not identify a study that has rigorously addressed this issue. Moreover, no direct comparison of the photocatalytic performance between these two MOFs, and their mixed-ligand varieties, has been reported so far, as most research has focused solely on the visible light performance of NH2-MIL-125-Ti (Table S1). This work thus aims to evaluate the overall effect of ligand tuning on various MOF’s properties including the stability in solvents and under irradiation, the charge separation ability, and the photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. We synthesized the most frequently studied photocatalytic MOFs, MIL-125-Ti and its amino-functionalized counterpart, as well as mixed-ligand MOFs with various terephthalic: amino-terephthalic acid ratios. We compared triethanolamine with methanol as hole scavengers in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of MIL-125-Ti,"2.1 Synthesis of MIL-125-Ti The procedure was adapted from Reference 24 [24]. In a single preparation, 1 g (6 mmol) of terephthalic acid (H2BDC) was first dissolved into a mixture of 2 mL HPLC methanol (MeOH) and 18 mL anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF). Afterwards, 0.568 mL titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) (2 mmol) was added to the solution under stirring. The mixture was then sonicated for 20 min and transferred into an autoclave (volume: 45 mL), reacting at 150 °C for 18 h."
3,Synthesis of NH2-MIL-125-Ti,"2.2 Synthesis of NH2-MIL-125-Ti The procedure was adapted from Reference 20 [20]. In a single synthesis, 40 mL of anhydrous DMF and 10 mL of HPLC MeOH were mixed as solvents, then 568.1 mg of 2-amino terephthalic acid (NH2BDC) was added to the mixture, stirred at room temperature till the yellow organic linker got fully dissolved. 0.568 mL TTIP was added at the end, followed by stirring for another 3 min. The resulting solution was solvo-thermally reacted in a 100 mL autoclave at 150 °C for 24 h."
4,Synthesis of mixed-ligand MOFs: MIL-125-Ti-xNH2,"2.3 Synthesis of mixed-ligand MOFs: MIL-125-Ti-xNH2 For the mixed-ligand samples MIL-125-Ti-xNH2, the general procedure and the solvent composition (v/v % MeOH: DMF = 1:9) were the same as for the case of MIL-125-Ti; the preparation details regarding the amounts of precursors are listed in Table S2. The resulting powders were collected via centrifugation and washed with DMF and MeOH three times each. The products were then dried overnight in the vacuum oven at 150 °C."
5,Characterization methods,"2.4 Characterization methods SEM measurements were conducted with FEGSEM Quanta 200 (USTEM). TEM images and ED patterns were obtained with FEI Technai F20 (Thermo Fischer Scientific). TEM samples were prepared by the deposition of the dispersed samples (usually in ethanol) onto copper grids (partially covered with carbon film). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in this work were collected with PANalytical X’Pert Pro multi-purpose diffractometer (MPD). Solid samples were simply mounted on Si single crystal sample holders. Light absorption properties were characterized by diffusive reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) by Jasco V-670 UV–vis photospectrometer. The physisorption measurements were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 by Micromeritics GmbH. The degassing procedure was set to 150 °C overnight and the isotherms were obtained at 77 K using nitrogen as the adsorbate. 1H NMR studies on MOFs recovered after immersion in 0.01 M TEOA aqeous solutions were performed following Zhang et al. [40]. The collected precipitates were first evacuated to remove any trapped residues and then dissolved in DMSO-d6 and deuterated H2SO4, assisted by sonication. 1H NMR spectra of the as-digested solutions were collected on a Bruker Advance 250 NMR spectrometer. Total-reflection X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) was used to quantify ionic and elemental species in reaction solutions taken after photocatalytic experiments as well as after solvent immersion in the dark for varied periods. Typically, 1 mL of solution was taken, and 10 ppm of Cr was added as an internal standard. 5 μL of the solution was dropped onto a quartz reflector and dried on a hot plate. The obtained film was then analyzed with a Wobistrax X-ray fluorescence analyzer in total reflection geometry, using an energy-dispersive Si detector and a monochromatized Rh-Kα excitation source (20.2 keV). Ionic inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was conducted with an iCAP 6000 Series (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Braunschweig) with the Thermo Scientific Qtegra intelligent Scientific Data Solution (ISDS) software in combination with a Cetac ASX520 autosampler. MOF samples were digested in concentrated H2SO4 at 70 °C overnight. Then the transparent solution was diluted in 1 vol.% HNO3 aqueous solution (common solvent) to the concentration of the major elements in the level of ppm. For the stability of titanium during the measurement, 0.1 vol.% HF was added. In the end, Indium was added to all the samples as internal standard. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured with Picoquant Fluo Time 300 equipped with a Xenon lamp (λ = 250 ∼ 800 nm). Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) were collected after excitation with 280 nm and 375 nm lasers. The PL samples were prepared by dispersing MOF powders in DI H2O (denoted as H) as well as MeOH aqueous solution (50 vol.%, denoted as M). This sample preparation was chosen to mimic the measurement conditions during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In another set of experiments, we probed the OH radical generation of aqueous MOF solutions after light irradiation, following the work by Ishibashi et al. [41]. We used terephthalic acid as a probe molecule that reacts rapidly with as generated OH radicals. The emission spectra were obtained after excitation at 315 nm. Mott-Schottky measurements: 10 mg of the MOF powders were suspended in 0.5 mL ethanol with 20 μL 5 wt% Nafion as binder. The slurry was subjected to 10 min sonication before use. The MOF electrodes were prepared by drop-casting 20 μL of the as-prepared slurry onto a clean FTO sheet (1 cm*1 cm) and dried naturally at room temperature. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed with the potentiostat PGSTAT302 N in a three-electrode cell system with a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Mott-Schottky plots were determined in the range of -0.5 to 0.7 V (vs RHE) at a frequency of 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 4.5 kHz in 0.2 M Na2SO4."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) In a typical photocatalytic HER experiment, 10 mg of the photocatalyst was first dispersed into 40 mL DI H2O and HPLC MeOH mixture (50 vol.%) (or 40 mL 0.01 M TEOA aqueous solution), then subjected to 3 min sonication. After sonication, the reaction mixture was transferred to the reactor (depicted in Figure S1) under constant stirring. The suspension was purged with Ar flow to eliminate the dissolved oxygen. A certain amount of H2PtCl6 solution (corresponding to the wt.% of Pt-to-catalyst being 0.5) was then added to photo-deposit Pt as co-catalyst. Afterwards, the reactor was closed. During light irradiation, there was constant Ar flow controlled by a mass flow controller (Q-flow 140 series, MCC-Instruments) carrying all the gases from the reactor to the gas detector. Hydrogen generation was detected online and in-stream using Emerson gas analyzer equipped with a TCD detector. The light source used was a 200 W Hg lamp (Superlite I 05, Lumatec), which can provide UV light (λ = 240–400 nm). Typically, 2−3 measurements were conducted, and the average rates were calculated. The excellent reproducibility is documented in ESI (Fig. S18). After selected HER experiments, the suspension was filtered, and the collected powders were dried for post-reaction analyses by XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS to investigate the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of single-ligand MOFs,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of single-ligand MOFs The XRD results of the as-prepared MOF powders (Fig. 1 a) show that both single-ligand MOFs exhibit high crystallinity with sharp distinguishable peaks that can be attributed to the reported crystal structures of MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti [20,24]. The diffraction patterns of MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti are essentially identical, which demonstrates that the replacement of -H to -NH2 in the ligand backbone does not affect the framework significantly, in line with previous reports [32,42,43]. The diffraction patterns show no additional peaks attributed to other phases, which confirms the purity of the as-prepared materials. SEM images reveal that both MOF samples are composed of particles with typical circular plate-like morphology (Figure S2), in line with other reports [44–46]. Furthermore, BET surface areas along with the t-plot micropore volumes of MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti (Figure S3 and Table S3) suggest that NH2-MIL-125 has a slightly smaller pore volume (0.53 cm3/g) and smaller surface area (1243 m2/g) than MIL-125-Ti (0.60 cm3/g, 1413 m2/g). This can be explained by the fact that the amino group in NH2BDC points toward the pore interior [20,26]. Fig. 1b summarizes the light absorption properties (measured via DRS) of the two MOFs as well as their corresponding organic ligands. As can be seen in the inset, molecular H2BDC absorbs only in the UV region with an absorption edge at 341 nm, while the absorption of NH2BDC exhibits an absorption peak centered around 400 nm, which can be explained by excitation of lone-pair electrons from N via n-π* transition [47]. The light absorption of the pure ligands directly affects the DRS profiles of the MOFs. MIL-125-Ti absorbs only at wavelengths below 337 nm, inducing excitation from the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO), made of π states in the ligand and O(2p) in the metal-oxo cluster, into the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) defined by Ti(3d), leaving behind holes near the Ti-oxo cluster [48–50]. In contrast, NH2-MIL-125-Ti shows two absorption peaks: one below 330 nm, which originates from excitation within the metal-oxo cluster similar to MIL-125-Ti, and a second peak that is centered at 375 nm. The blue-shift of this latter peak with respect to the uncoordinated NH2BDC molecule indicates the presence of a ligand-to-metal-cluster charge transfer (LMCT) mechanism, which involves the excitation from the HOCO dominated by N from the ligand to the LUCO defined by Ti(3d), leaving behind holes spatially separated in the ligand [42,47]."
9,Stability of single-ligand MOFs in the dark and under photocatalytic conditions,"3.2 Stability of single-ligand MOFs in the dark and under photocatalytic conditions A direct comparison between NH2-MIL-125-Ti and MIL-125-Ti mandates the use of a UV light source (λ = 240–400 nm). Not much is known about the stability of photoactive MOFs upon UV irradiation under reaction conditions, i.e. aqueous solutions with hole scavengers as sacrificial agents. While nearly all HER studies on NH2-MIL-125-Ti utilized triethanolamine (TEOA) [39,51–55], we also investigated the use of methanol (MeOH), which is one of the most commonly used hole scavengers for metal oxide based heterogeneous photocatalysts [56–58]. The stability of the MOFs was studied with SEM-EDX mapping, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, upon immersion in the dark as well as during various stages of the photocatalytic reaction. First, we looked at the stability in aqueous MeOH solutions. SEM reveals that the circular platelet shape of the pristine MOFs (Figure S2) was largely preserved after 1 h of photocatalytic HER reaction (Fig. 2 a and e a and e). The appearance of some shallow holes or voids on the surface of the particles indicates minor surface corrosion. XRD confirms that the original crystal structures of both MOFs were largely preserved after the reaction (Fig. 2i and j). The small changes in relative peak intensities are likely associated with the observed surface corrosion and indicate an oriented framework degradation. Similarly, the immersion of the MOFs in MeOH in the dark for 22 h did not noticeably alter the morphology of the MOF particles (Fig. 2c and g), nor the XRD patterns of the MOFs (Fig. 2i and j) – with the exception of two new peaks that appeared in the pattern of MIL-125-Ti and are yet to be identified. Note, that the surface corrosion is slightly more pronounced with NH2-MIL-125-Ti than MIL-125-Ti. This observation is supported by XRF data from the respective residual liquid phase, obtained by removing the catalyst after the reaction via centrifugation (Fig. 2k), which reveals that the solution from NH2-MIL-125-Ti contained about 2.5 at.% of the initial Ti atoms, while almost no Ti had leached into solution in the case of MIL-125-Ti upon HER reaction. This is further supported by changes in Ti: O atomic ratio calculated from EDX (Figure S4), where MIL-125-Ti yielded a Ti: O ratio close to the pristine MOF, while the ratio of NH2-MIL-Ti reduced. In contrast to MeOH, TEOA has a strongly detrimental, albeit differing impact on the stability of both MOFs. Fig. 2b and d show severe corrosion of MIL-125-Ti particles after 1 h of HER reaction as well as after immersion in the dark, which seems to have etched predominantly the interior of the particles, leaving behind hollow structures. The stronger corrosion with respect to MeOH, is further supported by the XRF data, which shows that nearly 20 % and 92 % of the initial Ti atoms have leached into solution after 1 h HER and 22 h in dark, respectively. In contrast to the sample immersed in the dark for 22 h, the sample retrieved after 1 h HER was still crystalline yet exhibited a different XRD pattern (Fig. 2i). For comparison, NH2-MIL-125-Ti showed a completely amorphous XRD pattern after 1 h HER reaction. Since this sample still contained about 90 at.% of Ti (Fig. 2k), Ti leaching cannot fully explain the amorphization of NH2-MIL-125-Ti. This observation along with a significant decrease in particle size and an enhanced tendency toward agglomeration (Fig. 2f and h) thus suggests a different degradation process. The MOFs in TEOA were further investigated with 1H NMR spectroscopy to test whether degradation was provoked by the replacement of the carboxylate linkers through complexation with TEOA. Indeed, the spectra of both, NH2-MIL-125-Ti and MIL-125-Ti collected after 22 h immersion in TEOA in dark, show additional signals in the ppm range between 2.5 and 4 ppm (Figure S6). Considering that we removed residual solvent molecules trapped within the pores of the MOFs by thorough washing and vacuum-drying following the procedure by Zhang et al. [30], the presence of these additional signals can be assigned to TEOA ligands incorporated into the structure. The identification of the nature of incorporation and degree of coordination need more sophisticated studies by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In any case, this ligand exchange is likely responsible for, or at least facilitates the breakdown and degradation of the MOFs with TEOA. The degradation may be assisted further by the higher pH values of the TEOA solutions (7.9 and 8.3 for MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, respectively) compared to the MeOH solutions (4.2 and 4.6 for MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, respectively)."
10,Photocatalytic performance of single-ligand and mixed-ligand MOFs,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance of single-ligand and mixed-ligand MOFs 3.3.1 Long-term performance of single-ligand MOFs Fig. 3 a shows the H2 accumulation profiles of MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti under UV irradiation over a period of 21 h, using Pt as co-catalyst and both, MeOH and TEOA, as hole scavengers. Note that all photocatalysts were active, at least in the first few hours, but exhibited significant differences in rates and long-term performance. In the case of TEOA, both MOFs shared a similar H2 generation capability in the first 4 h. After that, however, the H2 evolution of the NH2-MIL-125-Ti ceased entirely, while MIL-125-Ti showed a steady rate during the entire process. Even more intriguing is the observation that the combination of MIL-125-Ti with MeOH has yielded considerably higher H2 evolution rates than with TEOA, which is surprising if one considers that it is thermodynamically and kinetically easier to oxidize TEOA than MeOH, as confirmed with CV studies performed by Kampouri et al. [59]. The stronger decrease in HER rates of the MOFs with TEOA compared with MeOH can be explained by the stronger corrosion and framework degradation with TEOA, as described in the Section 3.2. The complete deactivation of NH2-MIL-125-Ti in TEOA after 4 h correlates well with the almost complete loss of crystallinity (Fig. 2j). For comparison, the retained crystallinity of both MOFs in MeOH explains the stable HER rates even after 21 h. Note that MIL-125-Ti in MeOH showed a sudden decrease in rate after about 4 h of UV irradiation that may be related to the observed minor changes in the crystal structure. 3.3.2 Early-stage performance of single-ligand MOFs Next, we analyzed the product formation during the early stage of the photocatalytic reaction with an in-situ gas detection system to elucidate the impact of ligand composition and hole scavengers. Fig. 3b and c show that the HER rates of MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti reached saturation within the first 15−20 min that correlate reasonably well with the initial rates calculated from the long-run experiments (Fig. 3a). Note that the rates are comparable in the case of TEOA, whereas in the case of MeOH, the saturation rate of MIL-125-Ti (58 μmol/h) is superior to that of NH2-MIL-125-Ti (1.5 μmol/h) by 38 times, 58/1.5=38.66666, and even larger than both MOFs in TEOA by a factor of 3 (Fig. 3b and c). Although a universal comparison of photocatalytic performances remains challenging due to the large variety of illumination and reaction conditions used in the community [60], our results demonstrate that the combination of MIL-125-Ti and MeOH has yielded HER rates that are among the highest reported values for Ti-MOF based photocatalysts (Table S4). A closer look reveals that the initial increase in rate within the first few minutes is strongly affected by both, the hole scavenger and the ligand. The steepest rise was observed with MeOH and MIL-125-Ti. This may be ascribed to the lower polarity and smaller molecular size of MeOH compared with TEOA as well as to the larger pore diameter of MIL-125-Ti, which both facilitate the diffusion of MeOH into the pores, leading to a steeper rise of HER rate. A recurring question in the community is whether the hydrogen formed in MeOH-containing photocatalytic systems comes solely from the alcohol, i.e. via the steam reforming process of the MeOH. This has been observed and discussed in the work of D. Bahnemann [61], in which the amount of evolved H2/CO2 was around 3:1. Therefore, in this work, the CO2 evolution has been recorded along with the H2 evolution (insets in Fig. 3b and c). As the most common oxidation products of TEOA are various organic species such as aminyl radical, (hydroxy)ethanal rather than CO2 [62], the observed rise of CO2 in the system under light irradiation corresponds to a background signal that may originate from the minor amounts of CO2 previously dissolved in the solvent, as also confirmed in the blank CO2 generation test shown in Figure S8. In the case of MeOH, the calculated molar ratios of H2 to CO2 amass to 55 and 26 for MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, respectively, which are far larger than expected from a steam reforming reaction. Therefore, either a large part of MeOH was oxidized into products other than CO2, e.g. HCOOH, or the MOFs did, in fact, catalyze the generation of hydrogen from water. 3.3.3 Effect of co-catalyst deposition on HER performance of single-ligand MOFs Our investigations on the stability of the MOFs in aqueous MeOH solutions (see Section 3.2) suggest neither Ti leaching nor framework degradation as the main reason for the observed differences in HER rates. Therefore, we investigated alternative reasons for the superior performance of MIL-125-Ti over NH2-MIL-125-Ti in the presence of MeOH. Another explanation involves differences in co-catalyst loading and dispersion as well as the location (e.g. within the pores or externally adsorbed on the MOF particles). It is important to mention that in our system Pt particles were formed through in-situ photo-deposition (see Section 2.5). We first investigated the state and the actual loading amount of Pt as our co-catalyst. TEM images in Fig. 4 reveal a homogeneous deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of both MOFs (dark spots in Fig. 4a and c, pointed by red arrows) with a comparable average size of around 3 nm. Due to the relatively large particle size, the observed Pt nanoparticles likely resided on the surface of both MOFs, yet the possibility of some Pt depositing inside MOF particles cannot be fully excluded. The images further show that the Pt nanoparticles formed intimate interfaces with both MOFs. Moreover, the lattice distance of 0.226 nm corresponding to the Pt (111) plane of Fm 3 ¯ m (Fig. 4b and d) confirms the metallic state of Pt [63]. The amount of Pt loaded on the MOF particles was determined with ICP-MS after 1 h HER experiment (Table S5). The results indicate a slightly lower actual amount of Pt present in MIL-125-Ti (0.41 Pt/Ti at.% instead of the nominal 0.51 at.%) compared to that in NH2-MIL-125-Ti (0.52 Pt/Ti at.% instead of the nominal 0.53 at.%). SEM-EDX mapping further confirms the Pt distribution and loading amount (Figure S4). Note that the actual and nominal Pt loading deviated slightly in the case of MIL-125-Ti. The small amount of Pt in the solution after the HER experiment, measured by XRF (Figure S4a), confirms that this discrepancy originated from a non-complete photo-deposition process rather than from Pt leaching into the reaction solution, which corroborates with the observed intimate Pt-MOF interfaces. This contrasts with TEOA, where a significant leaching has been observed (Figure S9), in line with the stability discussion. The combined results suggest that the leaching of Pt during the photocatalytic experiments in MeOH is negligible and that the differences in Pt loading, dispersion and location between the two MOFs are not significant enough to account for their strong differences in HER performance. The origin for the differences in activity may thus lie in the nature of the ligand. 3.3.4 Photocatalytic performance of mixed ligand MOFs in MeOH We prepared a series of isostructural mixed-ligand MOFs with various NH2BDC to H2BDC ratios, covering an unusually broad composition range of 2 mol.% ≤ x ≤ 80 mol.%. A detailed materials characterization of the mixed-ligand MOFs can be found in supporting information (Figure S10-S14). All synthesized mixed-ligand MOFs exhibit high crystallinity with sharp distinguishable peaks (Figure S10). The entire MIL-125-Ti-xNH2 series shows diffraction patterns similar to MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, suggesting that the ligand composition had no noticeable effect on the overall coordination and crystal structure. On the other hand, the impact of the increasing NH2BDC fraction on light absorption is clearly visible (Fig. 5 a). Already the sample with the lowest NH2BDC content (2 mol.%) shows the typical absorption peak (centred at 389 nm) induced by the amino chromophore. The light absorption increases with increasing NH2BDC content and reaches saturation at about 20 mol.%. We prepared Tauc plots and calculated band gaps (Eg) using a direct-transition model [26,64,65] (Figure S12), which shows different Eg values of 3.8 eV and 2.8 eV for MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, respectively. In contrast, the Eg of the mixed-ligand MOFs are in the range of 2.8–2.85 eV and thus close to that of NH2-MIL-125-Ti, in accordance with the work of C. H. Hendon et al. [64]. This confirms the dominating role of the NH2BDC in the light absorption process. Fig. 5b reveals a gradual decrease in HER activity for the mixed-ligand MOFs with increasing NH2BDC content, despite they possess enhanced light absorption. This confirms the detrimental role of NH2BDC for HER when MeOH is used as a hole scavenger and appears to contradict the work of Draznieks et al. [66], who reported an increase in photocatalytic rates with increasing amounts of NH2BDC (saturation with 50 mol.% incorporation). A direct comparison, however, needs to be taken with care, as the authors investigated a different photocatalytic reaction, i.e. the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, and used a light source that is not suitable for MIL-125-Ti. Note, that the decrease in H2 evolution rate is not linearly correlated with the increasing NH2BDC content; instead, the results show a strong decrease below 10 mol.%, while the rates continue to decrease to a lower extent beyond 50 mol.%. This suggests that the addition of NH2BDC not only reduces the amount of active species in the system, but also has a negative synergistic effect that further affects the activity of the adjacent H2BDC. One possibility to explain this trend is related to the structural inhomogeneity of the mixed-ligand MOFs. Although XRD analysis (Figure S10) and IR spectroscopy (Figure S14) show no signs of extended impurity phases, a locally restricted uneven ligand apportionment cannot be excluded. A potential impact of such inhomogeneity on the photocatalytic properties of mixed-ligand MOFs needs to be investigated in the future. An alternative explanation indicates a more complex interplay between the different ligands that coordinate to the same metal-oxo cluster. This may introduce alternative charge excitation and recombination pathways and consequently affect the HER performance. In Section 3.4, we will investigate the role of the ligands on the charge separation and recombination properties."
11,Charge separation studies of single/mixed-ligand MOFs with MeOH,"3.4 Charge separation studies of single/mixed-ligand MOFs with MeOH We performed photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements in solution under simulated photocatalytic conditions (i.e. 50 vol.% MeOH/H2O, M) and in pure H2O (H), as well as on the dried powders (i.e. solid-state PL) to probe the recombination behaviors in single-ligand and mixed-ligand MOFs. Based on the DRS results (Fig. 1b), we chose excitation wavelengths of 280 nm and 380 nm to specifically enact excitation within the Ti-oxo cluster and the NH2BDC ligand, respectively. Case 1 NH2-MIL-125-Ti after excitation at 380 nm Fig. 6 a shows that the corresponding emission spectra of NH2-MIL-125-Ti contain a broad and strong emission peak centered at 437 nm (2.82 eV). This energy fits best with the calculated bandgap of 2.8 eV using the direct-transition model (Figure S12). Consequently, the emission originates from the recombination of electrons that are excited via LMCT into the Ti(3d) orbitals with the holes that reside at the N in the ligand [50,67,68]. However, since we see a similar emission in solutions of free NH2BDC molecules (Figure S15b), this emission can also arise from intra-ligand recombination without involving the LMCT excitation mechanism. Note that the emission peaks are comparable in intensity and position in MeOH and in H2O. Moreover, solid-state PL experiment in the absence of H2O and MeOH shows a strong emission centered at 441 nm with a weak shoulder at 465 nm (Fig. 6c). The lower emission intensity in the solid-state PL can be explained by the differences in absorption efficiency and local concentrations between powders and suspensions. Both results suggest that the recombination behavior in NH2-MIL-125-Ti is not significantly affected by H2O and MeOH. Case 2 MIL-125-Ti after excitation at 280 nm Why does MIL-125-Ti not exhibit any emissions in contrast to NH2-MIL-125-Ti? For the excitation at 380 nm, the answer is plausibly related to the lack of sufficiently excited charge carriers. In the case of 280 nm, however, the situation is rather complex. Very few works have been devoted to the luminescent properties of MIL-125-Ti so far. An et al. excited MIL-125-Ti at 300 nm and observed an emission peak at 468 nm that they ascribed to the π→π * transition of the benzene ring [69]. However, they did not specify whether the spectra were measured in the solid or liquid phase. Our experiments were performed in solution mimicking the conditions of our photocatalytic experiments. The absence of a strong emission peak in Fig. 6a and b suggests that the charge carriers excited via the O-Ti transitions may recombine via non-radiative processes or the emission can be almost completely quenched, e.g. by the presence of a hole scavenger. We additionally performed solid-state PL spectroscopy on powders in absence of water and methanol. Fig. 6c reveals a strong emission peak for MIL-125-Ti after excitation at 280 nm that is centered at about 436 nm and contains a shoulder at 417 nm. This result confirms that the absence of an emission peak in aqueous MeOH is due to effective quenching by the hole scavenger. Case 3 NH2-MIL-125-Ti and the mixed-ligand MOFs after excitation at 280 nm Fig. 6b shows that the excitation at 280 nm also yielded a strong emission peak with NH2-MIL-125-Ti, albeit with a maximum that is slightly blue-shifted to 431 nm with respect to 437 nm at 380 nm excitation. Note, that the intensity of this emission is about 4 times lower than after excitation at 380 nm. Moreover, the intensity is considerably lower in MeOH than in H2O (Fig. 6b), which indicates partial quenching, in contrast to the excitation at 380 nm. Since light absorption in molecular species occurs upon resonance with discrete energy levels, the absorption efficiency is dependent on the excitation wavelength. The absorption efficiency in NH2-MIL-125-Ti is at its highest with a wavelength of around 380 nm (Fig. 1b), at which charge excitation occurs only within the NH2BDC ligand, following the aforementioned LMCT mechanism [42]. At 280 nm, it is likely that the promotion of charge carriers in NH2-MIL-125-Ti follows the dual-excitation model [70]. According to this model, excitation occurs both via O-to-Ti transitions leaving holes near the Ti-oxo cluster, and involving the ligand-based LMCT process. Due to the effective quenching of the former process (discussed for Case 2), the observed emission is likely to originate from the recombination that follows LMCT. Consequently, the decrease in intensity in MeOH with respect to H2O relates to the quenchable fraction of O-to-Ti transitions in the MOFs. This behavior is even more pronounced for the mixed-ligand MOFs, shown here for the example containing 20 mol.% NH2BDC (Fig. 6b). Applying the dual-excitation model, the comparatively lower intensity in H2O with respect to the pure NH2-MIL-125-Ti, as well as the even stronger quenching in MeOH can be ascribed to the lower NH2BDC content and thus the comparatively higher fraction of O-to-Ti transitions, which further contributes to the increased HER activity discussed in Section 3.3.4. An intriguing observation for future studies was made with the solid-state PL after excitation at 280 nm. Fig. 6c shows an emission peak of NH2-MIL-125-Ti in absence of H2O and MeOH that was significantly lower in intensity and red-shifted to a peak maximum at 508 nm compared to the excitation at 380 nm. This emission feature, along with the partial quenching in solution for this excitation wavelength, has not been reported before in the community. It is possible that the illumination at 280 nm can induce charge excitations to higher energy levels that can facilitate alternative radiative recombination or charge transfer processes, one of which may be responsible for the observed red-shifted emission peak. This prospect complements the dual-excitation model, especially for mixed-ligand MOFs, where both ligands coordinate to one Ti-oxo cluster and thus likely introduce different HOCO and LUCO levels. However, more experiments with theoretical support will be required to fully understand this phenomenon. Addition support for the dual-excitation model and the preferred quenching of holes in the Ti-oxo cluster came from time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES), which shows similar decay profiles for NH2-MIL-125-Ti and the MIL-125-Ti-20 %NH2 (Fig. 6d). Two characteristic lifetimes τ1 and τ2 can be extracted from the decays. The τ1 values of 14.5−15 ns correspond well to those values calculated for the recombination of LMCT separated charge carriers [67]. The lifetimes do not seem to be affected by the NH2BDC content or the presence of MeOH, in line with the solution PL studies. For comparison, the τ1 of MIL-125-Ti, albeit exhibiting only a very weak emission due to quenching, is much shorter (7 ns), which indicates a faster recombination process. This correlates well with the theoretical work of Capano et al. [49], who predicted a slower recombination in NH2-MIL-125-Ti due to the spatial separation of electrons in Ti(3d) and holes in N within the ligand in contrast to MIL-125-Ti, where both charge carriers reside in the Ti-oxo cluster. In contrast to τ1, τ2 strongly correlates with the presence of NH2BDC. The process can be related to recombination within the Ti-oxo cluster that is directly affected by the scavenging process of holes by MeOH and is thus faster than τ1 [67]. Note that the lifetime in MIL-125-Ti is one order of magnitude smaller than in NH2-MIL-125-Ti, which supports the more efficient hole scavenging by MeOH in MIL-125-Ti. Why is the quenching of holes in the Ti-oxo cluster so much more efficient than of those residing at N in NH2BDC? If we neglect mechanisms based on energy transfer (e.g. FRET), we need to consider that an effective quenching via charge transfer requires an intimate contact between the MOF and the hole scavenger. While MeOH interacts weakly with the organic ligands, it can adsorb as methoxy intermediates on Ti - oxo clusters upon capping the bridging hydroxyl groups. It is thus plausible that the holes residing in neighboring oxygens within the metal-oxo cluster can be more effectively transferred to the methoxy species than the holes residing in the ligand. This hypothesis can explain the absence of an emission peak in MIL-125-Ti, the differences in lifetimes and the superior HER activity of MIL-125-Ti, for which MeOH acts as an efficient hole scavenger."
12,Mechanistic models in the context of HER,"3.5 Mechanistic models in the context of HER The combined results from HER experiments as well as DRS, solid-state PL spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy in simulated reaction media and TRES studies suggest ligand-dependent mechanisms for charge excitation, transfer and consequently for the H2 evolution reaction in MeOH. Fig. 7 e shows the energy diagram of the HOCO/LUCO levels for the various MOFs, as constructed by the flat band potentials measured via Mott-Schottky analysis (see Figure S17) and the band gap values calculated from the Tauc plots in Figure S12. Note that the ligand variation does not significantly affect the flat band potentials of the MOFs, and hence their LUCO levels, which confirms that the LUCOs of MIL-125-Ti and its isostructural species are dominated by Ti-3d of the metal - oxo clusters. Fig. 7e also includes the redox potentials for hydrogen formation as well as the oxidations of MeOH and water at pH 7. Note that the oxidation of MeOH is thermodynamically possible for all the MOFs, while only MIL-125-Ti is capable of hydroxyl formation. The different performances of MIL-125-Ti and the NH2-containing MOFs in MeOH in contrast to TEOA mandates a distinct involvement of MeOH in the hydrogen evolution process. Fig. 7 summarizes the two different mechanisms for charge generation and charge separation process that proceed either via the LMCT pathway (dominant in NH2-MIL-125-Ti, Fig. 7a,c) or an O-Ti excitation route (dominant in MIL-125-Ti, Fig. 7b,d). Therefore, the excitation under UV in both MOFs results in the electrons being localized in the LUCO level that is dominated by Ti(3d), as confirmed by the Mott-Schottky analysis. Consequently, they reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ species, in line with the work of Meenakshi Dan-Hardi [24]. The main difference between the two MOFs is that, crucially, the holes reside at different locations. In the case of MIL-125-Ti, electrons and holes tend to relax into locations that are spatially overlapping (Fig. 7b). Consequently, this leads to a rather quick recombination of the charge carriers (Fig. 6c). However, a fast charge recombination does not mean a low photocatalytic efficiency; one also needs to consider an efficient charge injection. This can happen either via direct transfer of holes into methoxy species that are adsorbed at Ti atoms within the cluster, or indirectly via hydroxyl species. The efficient quenching in MeOH suggests the preference for the first scenario. The holes in MIL-125-Ti reside at O 2p and are thus in proximity to adsorbed methoxy groups, which would consequently facilitate back-injection of electrons via direct charge transfer. With the addition of Pt as a co-catalyst, the photo-excited electrons thereby are free to reduce H+ to H2 and re-regenerate Ti4+, consequently leading to the observed superior HER performance of MIL-125-Ti over NH2-MIL-125-Ti in MeOH. In the case of NH2-MIL-125-Ti, the repulsive interactions between the photoexcited charge carriers [49] enact the holes to reside with N in the ligand, thus separating them spatially from the electrons in Ti 3d (Fig. 7a) [68]. Consequently, the recombination of the charge carriers leads to comparatively long lifetime of about 15 ns. Importantly, the recombination is not affected by the presence of MeOH as observed in TRES (Fig. 6d). This suggests that, although direct oxidation of MeOH is essentially possible from a thermodynamic point of view, the holes at N are too far away from the adsorbed methoxy species to be efficiently scavenged. A direct charge transfer from their position at N is also unlikely due to the weak interactions of the MeOH molecules with the organic ligand. Without such charge transfer, electrons and holes are prone to recombine (shown as red dashed lines in Fig. 7c), resulting in the observed PL emission (Fig. 6a and b). Consequently, this manifests itself in NH2-MIL-125-Ti having negligible rates for H2 evolution in MeOH (Fig. 3a and b). For comparison, TEOA – while yielding reasonable initial HER rates – brings along a disadvantage that it facilitates degradation and thus deactivation of the MOF structure. The mixed-ligand MOFs present a unique situation, where both H2BDC and NH2BDC are coordinated to the metal-oxo cluster and can thus contribute to the charge generation, separation, and recombination. Presumably, the fraction of photoexcited electrons that are formed in the vicinity of the NH2BDC ligands undergo recombination like in NH2-MIL-125-Ti (Fig. 7c). The rest of the photoexcited charges, i.e. those generated near Ti-oxo clusters (Fig. 7d), experience efficient charge transfer (i.e. by hole scavenging from MeOH), allowing the surviving electrons to further transfer to Pt and reduce H+ to H2 (Fig. 7f); in line with the trend in HER performance in Fig. 5b. However, the red-shifted emission peak in the solid-state spectrum, as well as the ligand-dependent changes of τ2 (Fig. 6d), hint on additional excitations and radiative transitions that are either induced by the high excitation energy or introduced in the mixed-ligand MOFs through the coordination of both ligands to the same Ti-oxo clusters, which may correspond to the non-linear relationship of NH2BDC percentage with HER performance. Further investigations are required to shed more light on the mixed-ligand system, in terms of both materials’ characterization (e.g. ligand distribution, hybridization and electronic states) and photocatalytic evaluation."
13,Conclusions,"This work provides a comprehensive comparison of photoactive MIL-125-Ti, NH2-MIL-125-Ti and their mixed-ligand variations with respect to their photostability, charge separation characteristics and photocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution in TEOA and MeOH solutions. We demonstrate that TEOA, as one of the most studied hole scavengers, facilitates strong corrosion and degradation of the MOFs within the first few hours, both in the dark and under UV illumination, resulting in complete deactivation. In contrast, the use of MeOH, which is commonly used as a hole scavenger in metal-oxide-based photocatalysis, can preserve the structure of the MOFs. It also enhances the photocatalytic properties, specifically of MIL-125-Ti, which outperforms all NH2-containing MOFs by up to 38 times, placing it among the currently most active MOF-based photocatalysts for HER. Detailed analysis with PL spectroscopy in solid-state and under simulated photocatalytic conditions, combined with life-time measurements via TRES, reveal different mechanisms of charge excitation and separation in MIL-125-Ti and NH2-MIL-125-Ti, which directly affect the respective HER performance. Charge excitation in MIL-125-Ti proceeds via O-to-Ti transition followed by charge relaxation within the Ti-oxo cluster. This spatial overlap of charge polarons leads to quick recombination in absence of a solvent. In MeOH solution, however, the holes transfer quickly to methoxy intermediates adsorbed on Ti, thus enacting the electrons to transfer to Pt. The efficient hole scavenging properties of MeOH lead to surprisingly high hydrogen evolution rates in MIL-125-Ti. In the case of NH2-MIL-125-Ti, the charge excitation follows the LMCT mechanism, leaving the holes localized at the N atoms in the ligand. Indirect oxidation of MeOH with hydroxyl radical is thermodynamically unfeasible, while direct transfer to the methoxy intermediates is kinetically restricted due to their spatial separation. Consequently, this low hole scavenging efficiency of MeOH is responsible for the negligible hydrogen evolution rates in NH2-MIL-125-Ti. Finally, charge excitation in the mixed-ligand MOFs follows the dual-excitation model, which makes the HER performance highly dependent on the NH2BDC content. However, the coordination of two distinct ligands to one metal-oxo cluster may induce alternative excitation and recombination pathways. It will be vital to complement future investigations with advanced TAS experiments and computational studies. Future investigations should also aim at unravelling ligand distribution in mixed-ligand MOFs and their respective connectivity to the metal nodes. Currently, we are conducting experiments with in-situ IR-ATR spectroscopy in association with computational simulations to confirm our hypothesis regarding the hole-accepting contribution by methoxy groups in MIL-Ti-125."
