0,Introduction,"Inorganic-organic compounds are complex hybrid materials consisting of chemically bonded inorganic matrix and organic molecules or their fragments [1–3]. Unlike composites including several individual phases, inorganic-organic compounds possess a single crystal lattice. Interest in their creation is associated with the possibility to combine practically significant properties of inorganic and organic components in one material. Moreover, the interaction of these components may also result in the appearance of new unique properties, which are not characteristic of initial substances taken separately. Inorganic-organic compounds attract great attention as highly efficient photocatalysts [4–12] and precursors for the preparation of bare and organically modified perovskite nanolayers [13–15] being of interest to catalysis [16], nanoelectronics [17], biotechnology [18] and other actively developing areas. The literature analysis shows that the preparation of inorganic-organic materials is widely studied in relation to metal halide perovskites because of their potential use in solar power [19–21]. At the same time, inorganic-organic derivatives of oxide perovskites are investigated to a much lesser extent. Ion-exchangeable layered perovskite-like oxides are solid crystalline materials whose structure can be represented as a regular alternation of negatively charged intergrowth perovskite blocks with a thickness of n corner-shared octahedra BO6 (B = Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, etc.) and interlayer spaces populated by alkali cations [22–24]. In accordance with the features of the interlayer structure, ion-exchangeable layered perovskites may be classified into two groups: Dion-Jacobson [25–27] and Ruddlesden-Popper phases [28–30]. The Dion-Jacobson phases are compounds following a general formula A'[An−1BnO3n+1], where A′ is a singly charged interlayer cation, A is an alkaline earth or transition element and B is one of the aforementioned transition metals. The relative arrangement of adjacent perovskite blocks in these phases may correspond both to eclipsed and staggered conformation depending on the interlayer cation size. The interlayer space of the Dion-Jacobson phases possesses relatively low charge density, which may explain their high reactivity in many low-temperature reactions [31–35]. These compounds have been actively studied over past decades because of their practically valuable photocatalytic [36,37], electrophysical [38–43] and luminescent [44] properties as well as due to relatively easy exfoliation into nanolayers [45–47]. The composition of the Ruddlesden-Popper phases may be written in general as A′2[An−1BnO3n+1] (conventions are the same). Their structure represents an alternation of perovskite blocks with layers having the crystal arrangement of rock salt. The Ruddlesden-Popper phases possess greater interlayer charge density and their blocks as a rule are stacked in a staggered conformation. The reactivity of these compounds is known to be lower than that of the Dion-Jacobson ones, although it is enough for ion exchange in mild conditions [48–50]. Individual representatives of the Ruddlesden-Popper phases demonstrate valuable catalytic [51,52], photocatalytic [53–61], dielectric [62], conductor [63–66], thermophysical [67,68] and luminescent [69–73] characteristics. Acid treatment of ion-exchangeable perovskite-like oxides is known to result in the substitution of interlayer alkali cations by protons. Being solid acids, protonated forms of the perovskites are able to react with some organic substances via their introduction into the interlayer space. According to the nature of chemical bonding between inorganic and organic components, there are two ways of inorganic-organic derivatives formation: intercalation and grafting. Intercalation refers to the process of non-covalent incorporation of organic molecules into the interlayer space usually following an acid-base mechanism [74,75]. A pronounced propensity to intercalation is typical of organic bases (particularly, amines), i.e. substances easily converting to a cationic form via interaction with interlayer protons. The grafting of organic compounds consists in covalent bonding of their fragments with the perovskite matrix via interlayer vertices of BO6 octahedra [35]. Usually it proceeds as a condensation reaction accompanied by the formation of a low molecular weight substance whose continuous removal from the reaction medium may promote a chemical equilibrium shift towards the target product. Grafting is typical of alcohols [76,77], alkoxysilanes [78], organophosphorus acids [79], and carbohydrates [80]. Layered perovskite-like titanates HLnTiO4 are protonated forms of the Ruddlesden-Popper phases ALnTiO4 (A = alkali cation, Ln = La or lanthanide) [30]. Their structure is characterized by the complete ordering of H+ and Ln3+ cations between two nonequivalent interlayer spaces, separating perovskite blocks with a thickness of n = 1 titanium-oxygen octahedron (Fig. 1 ). Significant differences in size, charge and polarizing ability of these cations result in the noticeable vertical distortion of the octahedra [81]. As a consequence, the protons possess pronounced mobility in their interlayer space [82] providing ionic conductivity [83,84] and propensity for the low-temperature reactions of ion exchange, topochemical dehydration and acid leaching [85,86]. At the moment, the reactivity of protonated titanates HLnTiO4 with organic substances is not sufficiently investigated. Until our recent reports [87,88], any data on the possibility of their inorganic-organic derivatives formation were missing in the literature. Being a continuation of our previous paper on the simplest inorganic-organic titanates [87], the present study is devoted to the preparation and systematic investigation of two series of inorganic-organic derivatives of layered perovskites HLnTiO4 (Ln = La, Nd) containing intercalated n-alkylamines and n-alkoxy groups of alcohols of a various chain length. In future, we plan to test these hybrid materials as heterogeneous photocatalysts for hydrogen production since the organic modification of the interlayer space has been shown to result in a great increase in the photocatalytic activity [9–12]. Moreover, the materials described are of interest as precursors for the exfoliation into organically modified perovskite nanosheets that can also become efficient catalysts and photocatalysts. With the said, the present study pays special attention to structural features of the inorganic-organic products, their quantitative composition, light absorption region, morphology as well as stability under various conditions."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of initial protonated titanates,"2.1 Preparation of initial protonated titanates Alkaline layered perovskite-like titanates NaLnTiO4 (Ln = La, Nd) were synthesized according to the conventional ceramic technique using preliminarily calcined TiO2, Ln2O3 and Na2CO3 as starting compounds. The oxides were taken in stoichiometric amounts, sodium carbonate – with a 30% excess to compensate for the loss during calcination. All the reactants were placed into a grinding bowl with silicon nitride balls, flooded with n-heptane and ground in a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 planetary micro mill at a rotation speed of 600 rpm using a program of 10 repetitions of 10 min each with 5 min intervals. The mixture obtained was dried and pelletized into ∼2 g tablets at 50 bar using an Omec PI 88.00 hydraulic press. The tablets were placed into corundum crucibles with lids, kept at 825 °C for 12 h in a Nabertherm L-011K2RN muffle furnace and, after cooling down, ground in an agate mortar. To obtain protonated titanates HLaTiO4 (HLT) and HNdTiO4 (HNT), further used as precursors for the synthesis of inorganic-organic derivatives, powders of NaLnTiO4 were treated with a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution taken at a rate of 200 ml per 1 g of the titanate at room temperature for 1 d. Then solid phases were separated from the solution via centrifuging and dried in a desiccator over CaO for 2 d. Thereafter protonated titanates obtained were additionally ground in a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 planetary micro mill in the aforementioned mode."
3,Preparation of inorganic-organic derivatives,"2.2 Preparation of inorganic-organic derivatives Note: hereinafter, formulae of the form HLT×RNH2 and HLT×ROH (R = methyl Me, ethyl Et, n-propyl Pr, n-butyl Bu, n-hexyl Hx, n-octyl Oc, and n-decyl Dc) are only conventions for corresponding inorganic-organic compounds, which do not reflect their true compositions. The sequence of synthesis of hybrid inorganic-organic samples is shown in Fig. 2 . Intercalation of n-amines was performed using standard benchtop approaches. Methylamine derivatives HLT×MeNH2 and HNT×MeNH2 were synthesized directly on the basis of the protonated titanates. For this, 3 g of each titanate was placed in a glass tube containing 30 ml of 38% aqueous methylamine, whereupon the mixture was sonicated using an ultrasonic homogenizer Hielscher UP200St (200 W) at half power for 5 min. Then the tube was sealed and the suspension was stirred at 60 °C for 10 d. Synthesis of other amine derivatives HLT×RNH2 and HNT×RNH2 (R = Et, Pr, Bu, Hx, and Oc) was carried out using methylamine ones as precursors. In each case, 1 g of the methylamine derivative was placed in a sealed glass tube with 10 ml of a corresponding amine solution, after which the reaction mixture was stirred at the temperature T for the predetermined time D. Synthesis of n-alkoxy derivatives HLT×ROH and HNT×ROH was performed on the basis of amine ones under solvothermal conditions. In each case, 1 g of the amine derivative was placed into a sealed 50 ml PTFE vessel of a steel laboratory autoclave containing 35 ml of the alcohol being grafted or its solution. After thorough shaking, the autoclave was kept at the temperature T for the predetermined time D. After cooling down, the target products were filtered and rinsed with appropriate volatile solvents to remove residual surface-adsorbed amines and alcohols. For this, acetone and n-hexane were chosen as widely available, chemically inert and volatile solvents, providing good solubility of short-chain and long-chain organic components, respectively. Detailed conditions of the inorganic-organic derivatives preparation are summarized in Table 1 . The issue of their selection and optimization is circumstantially described in the Results and discussion section."
4,Calculation of the quantitative compositions of the inorganic-organic samples,"2.3 Calculation of the quantitative compositions of the inorganic-organic samples The compositions were calculated according to a two-stage scheme. At the first stage, the CHN-analysis was used to determine the mass content of nitrogen and carbon in the derivatives. Then, based on the assumption that all the nitrogen/carbon detected belongs to the intercalated n-alkylamines/grafted n-alkoxy groups, the amount of the organic component in the sample (x) was calculated. At the second stage, thermogravimetric curves of the corresponding samples were used to determine the total mass loss observed in the course of thermolysis in air. Taking into account the fact that the final composition of each sample after the complete thermal degradation in an oxidizing atmosphere is LnTiO3.5 and considering the previously found organic content (x) in the sample, it was possible to calculate the amount of intercalated water (y) per formula unit of each titanate. The final compositions were presented in the form HLnTiO4·xRNH2·yH2O (n-alkylamine derivatives) and H1−xLnTiO4−x·xRO·yH2O (n-alkoxy ones)."
5,Investigation of vacuum and hydrolytic stability,"2.4 Investigation of vacuum and hydrolytic stability To investigate the stability of inorganic-organic derivatives obtained at reduced pressure, their preliminarily weighted hitches of ∼0.3 g were placed in a desiccator equipped with an oil vacuum pump UED-Lab 115-SG and held under residual pressure of ∼1·10−4 atm. Sample weights were remeasured after 5 and 10 d of vacuuming and compared with initial values. The weighing was performed with an accuracy of 1·10−4 g using an Ohaus Pioneer PA214C balance. The samples held in vacuum for 10 d were additionally analyzed by means of Raman spectroscopy to establish the preservation of organic modifiers. Due to the proximity of the chemical properties of isostructural titanates with various lanthanides, hydrolytic stability was considered only for Nd-containing inorganic-organic derivatives. For this, 0.05 g of each compound was placed in a sealed glass tube with 10 ml of water and stirred for 10 d. Afterwards, the solid phase was filtered and studied by the X-ray diffraction analysis."
6,Instrumentation,"2.5 Instrumentation 2.5.1 X-ray diffraction analysis Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples was performed on a Rigaku Miniflex II benchtop diffractometer (CuKα radiation, angle range 2θ = 3–60°, scanning rate 10°/min, step 0.02°). The lattice parameters in the tetragonal system were calculated on the basis of all the reflections observed using DiffracPlus Topas software. 2.5.2 Raman spectroscopy Raman scattering spectra were collected on a Bruker Senterra spectrometer in the Raman shifts range of 100–3700 cm−1. The analysis of protonated titanates as well as amine and methoxy derivatives was performed using an incident laser 488 nm (power 1–20 mW, accumulation time 10–30 s depending on the intensity of the luminescent background), spectra of other alkoxy derivatives were collected with a 785 nm laser (power 50 mW, accumulation time 30–60 s). In the latter case, the high-frequency region in the figures was presented on an enlarged scale to make bands of the organic component more visible relative to high-intensity ones of the perovskite matrix. 2.5.3 IR spectroscopy Fourier-transformed infrared (IR) absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 spectrometer (spectral range 400–4000 cm−1, tableting in KBr). 2.5.4 NMR spectroscopy Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra of La-containing inorganic-organic derivatives were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 WB spectrometer at an operating frequency of 100.64 MHz following a cross polarization and magic angle spinning technique and using tetramethylsilane as an external reference. NMR analysis of Nd-containing samples was not possible due to their paramagnetism. 2.5.5 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer with an ISR-2200 integrating sphere attachment in the range of 220–800 nm using barium sulphate as an external reference with reflection coefficient R = 1. 2.5.6 CHN-analysis Carbon and nitrogen content in the inorganic-organic derivatives was determined via the elemental CHN-analysis on a Euro EA3028-HT analyzer. The hydrogen amounts were not used in further calculations because of low detection accuracy in relation to the samples with the inorganic matrix. 2.5.7 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a Netzsch TG 209 F1 Libra thermobalance in a synthetic air atmosphere. The temperature program included heating each sample from room temperature to 950 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min followed by keeping at the maximum temperature for 20 min to achieve the establishing of the constant mass. 2.5.8 Scanning electron microscopy Morphology of the particles was investigated on a Zeiss Merlin scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a field emission cathode, electron optics column Gemini II and oil-free vacuum system."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Precursors’ identification,"3.1 Precursors’ identification Initial protonated titanates HLT and HNT used for the synthesis of inorganic-organic compounds were identified using XRD and TG methods. Their tetragonal lattice parameters, a = 3.71 Å, c = 12.2 Å for HLT and a = 3.68 Å, c = 12.1 Å for HNT, were found to be consistent with the literature values [30]. Slightly larger parameters of the La-containing titanate in comparison with those of Nd-containing one can be explained by the difference in crystallographic radii of the cations. Processing the data of TG analysis allowed establishing the complete substitution of alkali cations by protons during the protonation procedure and the presence of negligible amounts of intercalated water in the interlayer space, which is characteristic of the titanates in question."
9,Synthesis of inorganic-organic derivatives: search for optimal conditions,"3.2 Synthesis of inorganic-organic derivatives: search for optimal conditions The water-soluble n-amines were used in the form of aqueous solutions based on the literature data on the necessity of water admixture in the system for the intercalation proceeding [89]. However, in the course of preliminary experiments, it was found that direct quantitative intercalation into the interlayer space of the protonated titanates, resulting in the formation of single-phase derivatives, is feasible only in the reaction with the simplest representative of amines – methylamine. Direct insertion of larger amines does not proceed quantitatively in the sense that only relatively fine particles of the polydisperse protonated compound do react with an amine. As a consequence, final samples represent mixtures of the unreacted initial titanate and target amine derivative and, having said so, a fraction of the latter ceteris paribus decreases with the amine chain length increasing. Such behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper titanates distinguishing them from the more chemically active Dion-Jacobson niobates, in addition to morphology features, may be associated with higher interlayer charge density, lower acidity and poor hydratability. However, the preparation of methylamine derivatives in a single-phase form proves to be of great importance for the successful synthesis of other inorganic-organic compounds since the former serve as precursors. Particularly, the residual protonated titanate admixture, potentially present in a methylamine derivative, preserves in all the following derivatives as larger organic substances do not react with it quantitatively. Depending on the synthesis method and methylamine concentration in an aqueous solution, the formation of methylamine derivatives with various quantitative compositions and structures is possible [88]. As we showed earlier [87], in the beginning, the methylamine intercalation proceeds quickly and after 1 d reaction carried out at room temperature the final samples contain a significant fraction of the target derivative. Additional heating speeds up the intercalation. However, even 10 d stirring of the corresponding reaction mixture at 60 °C does not give entirely pure product: the final sample still contains a small amount of the residual protonated form served as a precursor. The sonication helps to solve this problem since ultrasound efficiently disaggregates the titanates’ particles and therefore increases the contact area of the solid particles with the reaction solution. Thus, the highest purity of the methylamine samples regarding by-phases is achieved in the case of the benchtop synthesis at 60 °C for 10 d (Table 1) including preliminary sonication of the protonated titanate in aqueous methylamine. Conducting the experiment at room temperature or at noticeably lower duration results in the presence of the unreacted protonated precursor in the final product. Substitution of interlayer methylamine by ethyl-, n-propyl and n-butylamine in aqueous media proceeds readily and, therefore, the synthesis duration of 1 d proves to be sufficient for the obtainment of the target derivatives (Table 1). Its increase to 3–7 d or additional heating of the reaction mixture does not lead to noticeable changes in the structure and composition of the products. The maximum completeness of n-hexyl- and n-octylamine intercalation was found to be achieved during the synthesis at 60 °C lasting 7 d using their solutions in n-heptane. Lack of dilution, reducing the preparation time to 3 d or conducting the reaction at room temperature ceteris paribus gives single-phase products with close lattice parameters containing less organic matter. Preparation of the derivatives with long chain amines on the basis of ethyl-, n-propyl and n-butylamine titanates was also revealed feasible, however, this synthesis strategy does not seem expedient. In our previous study [87] it was established, using methanol as an example, that direct grafting of alcohols into the titanates HLT and HNT is not possible both in the standard benchtop mode and under solvothermal or solvothermal-microwave conditions. Consequently, the obtainment of alkoxy derivatives requires using amine ones as precursors (Table 1). Methanol grafting carried out via the stage of a methylamine derivative at temperature of 100 °C during 5 d allows obtaining pure single-phase methoxy compounds. Increasing the synthesis time to 10–14 d does not affect the structure and composition of the final samples (Table 1). Reducing the duration to 1–3 d or temperature drop to 60 °C leads to the formation of methoxy derivatives containing residual methylamine in the interlayer space, which is probably connected with greater stability of methylamine precursors at lower temperatures. Grafting of ethanol into the methylamine derivatives requires the same temperature and duration of at least 7 d (Table 1). Ethoxy derivatives prepared on the basis of n-butylamine ones also include residual n-butylamine due to incomplete decomposition of the intercalated precursor. The temperature increase up to 180 °C gives products disordered along the axis normal to the perovskite slabs regardless of the specific amine precursor, which may be associated with the strong interlayer space hydration due to the water contained in the ethanol azeotropic solution. Grafting of n-propanol, n-butanol and n-hexanol can be successfully carried out via n-butylamine derivatives at 180 °C for at least 5 d (Table 1); the duration increase does not affect the result. In the case of n-decanol, the reaction without alcohol dilution leads to non-single-phase products, which may be explained by the presence in the interlayer space of the unevenly distributed grafted and intercalated alcohol. Interlayer holding of the latter appears to be possible for steric reasons and alkyl-alkyl interactions of long hydrocarbon chains. When the reaction medium is diluted with n-heptane, the formation of non-single-phase samples is not observed, which might be due to more controllable n-decanol insertion into the interlayer space at its lower concentration in the solution. In the case of water-soluble alcohols' grafting (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol), the influence of the 10% water additive in the medium on the synthesis result was found to depend on temperature. Particularly, at 100 °C, final alkoxy derivatives practically do not differ from those obtained in anhydrous conditions; at 180 °C, the formation of disordered products takes place. The latter is apparently due to significant enrichment of the liquid phase with water as a less volatile component during the solvothermal synthesis, which results in uncontrollable hydration of the interlayer space and promotes the reverse reaction of the grafted derivative's hydrolysis. Thus, the purposeful water addition in the reaction mixture is not required for the single-phase alkoxy derivatives obtainment and the water amount contained in the amine precursor is sufficient for the target reaction proceeding."
10,Characterization of inorganic-organic derivatives,"3.3 Characterization of inorganic-organic derivatives Results of the XRD analysis (Fig. 3 ) confirm the successful preparation of all the derivatives in a single-phase form. As in the case of the initial protonated titanates, all reflections on the patterns of hybrid compounds obtained are amenable to indexing in the tetragonal system (only those indices, which are necessary for discussion, are signed on the chart). Intercalation of amines and grafting of alcohols into the interlayer space are seen to be accompanied by its expansion, observed by the characteristic shift of the (00x) reflections into the low-angle region proportional to the organic chain length. However, the a lattice parameter stays almost unchanged (Table 2 ). Unlike the protonated titanates, all the amine and alkoxy derivatives are characterized by doubling the c parameter in comparison with the interlayer distance d (Table 2). This fact indicates a probable change of the adjacent perovskite slabs’ conformation from staggered to eclipsed during the insertion of the organic components. On the whole, XRD patterns of inorganic-organic derivatives in comparison with those of the initial titanates demonstrate less intense and broader (00x) reflections, which may be associated with lowering the lattice orderliness when organic components are introduced into the interlayer space as well as with a decrease in crystallite sizes. Correlations between the interlayer distance d and number of carbon atoms nC in the n-alkylamine or n-alkoxy chain are presented in Fig. 4 where nC = 0 corresponds to the protonated titanate. Since the relationships d = d(nC) are generally linear (except for R = Dc), it is possible to calculate the approximate angle γ between organic chains and perovskite slabs. For this, we assume that all the interlayer organic structures exist in the all-trans-conformation (as shown in Fig. 2 using n-hexylamine as an example), are parallel to each other as well as take into account the average slope l1 of the dependences (Fig. 4) and theoretical chain extension with the addition of the homological difference –CH2– (l2 = 1.27 Å). As the l1 values, representing the increment of the interlayer distance d per one –CH2– group, are greater than l2, the organic chains appear to form a bilayer arrangement. With that said, the desired angle γ is included in a right-angled triangle with leg l1/2 and hypotenuse l2 and is expressed by the formula γ = arcsin(l1/2·l2). Thus, its value proves to fall in the range of 72–78° (Table 2), which is in good consistency with the tilt angle γ = 75° reported for the related organically modified Ruddlesden-Popper phase H2La2Ti3O10 [89]. When moving to n-decoxy compounds, the graph slope noticeably decreases, which may be due to both the lower γ value and non-compliance with the assumptions made in the calculation (in particular, other conformation of the chains). Successful formation of amine and alkoxy derivatives is also confirmed by appearance of new characteristic bands in their Raman scattering spectra (Fig. 5 ) relating to organic components, which are absent in those of the initial titanates. In particular, latitudinal vibrations of H–C–O (1170–1180 cm−1), C–C–H (1330–1340 cm−1), CH2 (1450–1460 cm−1), NH2 (1570–1580 cm−1) fragments as well as stretching of C–N (1030–1070 cm−1), C–O (1040–1070 cm−1) and C–H (2800–3050 cm−1) bonds are clearly observed. However, in the case of alkoxy derivatives, vibrations of OH-groups are not seen, which points to the presence in their structure of covalently bonded n-alkoxy fragments, not intercalated molecular alcohols. Furthermore, the insertion of organic structures into the interlayer space is accompanied by splitting of the band referred to the symmetric stretching mode of axial Ti–O bonds (830–840 cm−1 for the protonated titanates) into two new ones (720–790 cm−1 and 870–910 cm−1). The position of the former, being strongly dependent on the specific amine or alkoxy group, moves to the low-frequency region of Raman shifts with increasing the organic chain length. The splitting, apparently, is explained by the existence of two types of titanium-oxygen octahedra with unequal axial Ti–O distances, whose interlayer vertices are bonded to organic components (Ti–O−RNH3 + or Ti–O–R, the first band) and protons (Ti–O–H+, the second band). In the case of methoxy derivatives, the first band has much greater intensity and shifts more to the low-frequency area (670–690 cm−1) while the second one turns out to be practically invisible. However, positions of the bands referred to the asymmetric stretching mode of axial Ti–O bonds (500–700 cm−1) and vibrations located in the (LnO)2 layer (270–320 cm−1) stay almost unchanged. Additional analysis of the C–H stretching bands observed in the IR spectra of the samples (Supporting Information 1) also allowed establishing the arrangement of the interlayer n-alkyl chains in the long-chain derivatives (R = Bu, Hx, Oc, and Dc). The frequencies of symmetric (2855 cm−1) and asymmetric (2925 cm−1) CH2 vibrations indicate that the chains indeed exist predominantly in the all-trans-conformation [90], which was assumed to take place while calculating the tilt angles γ. One of the features of n-alkoxy derivatives discovered during Raman spectroscopy is their propensity for luminescence. Particularly, it was found that visible lasers 488–633 nm can be used to obtain informative Raman spectra only in the case of methoxy derivatives. In other cases, in the region of Stokes bands, intense luminescence takes place completely overlapping Raman scattering regardless of the specific n-alkoxy group. For this reason, spectra of the corresponding samples were collected using the 785 nm near-infrared laser. Since this wavelength is located near absorption bands of the Nd-containing samples, wide fluorescent stripes in the region of 1300–2000 cm−1 in their spectra are also observed. Nevertheless, it is not possible to explain rigorously intense fluorescence caused by visible lasers 488–633 nm from the available data as the alkoxy derivatives, like the other titanates in question, do not absorb light in this spectral region (Supporting information 2). In the case of the long-chain amine derivatives (R = Hx and Oc) raw Raman spectra, recorded with a 488 nm laser at a minimum power of 1 mW, also contained moderate luminescent background, which was not strongly pronounced in the spectra of short-chain compounds (R = Me, Et, Pr, and Bu). However, the background observed was much weaker in comparison with that demonstrated by the alkoxy derivatives (excluding R = Me) and allowed distinguishing main vibrational bands after subtraction. 13C NMR spectra of inorganic-organic compounds with the bands assignment, shown in Fig. 6 , clearly confirm the absence of residual methyl- or n-butylamine in the samples prepared on the basis of the corresponding amine-containing precursors. In the case of the derivatives with long-chain organic structures (R = Hx, Oc, and Dc), some spectral bands overlap due to close chemical shift values. Positions of the bands relating to the carbon atoms closest to the amine group (indicated by a major number in the figure) are offset by an average of 2 ppm in the high field region as compared with those in spectra of molecular amines, which points at the existence of the intercalated substances in a cationic form. In the case of alkoxy derivatives, a proof of the covalent bond formation is a shift of the bands referred to the carbon atoms (closest to oxygen) by 16–19 ppm to the low field region in comparison with their positions in spectra of corresponding molecular alcohols. In the spectrum of the n-decoxy compound, low intensity bands at approximately 21 and 41 ppm, which cannot be assigned to both n-decoxy group and residual n-butylamine (nitrogen in the sample is absent according to the elemental analysis), are also observed. These bands might be connected with the presence in the derivative of small n-decanal amount formed via partial n-decanol oxidation by oxygen contained in the reaction mixture. As well, the first of the bands might relate to residual n-heptane used as a solvent during the synthesis of the n-decoxy derivatives. Quantitative compositions of inorganic-organic compounds determined via the elemental CHN-analysis and TG are presented in Table 3 . In the case of alkoxy derivatives, nitrogen was not detected, which confirms the complete absence of residual amines contained in precursors for synthesis. Most derivatives are seen to include an average of 0.4–0.5 amine molecules or alkoxy groups per proton of the initial titanate. The participation of no more than half of the initial protons in the binding of organic components is consistent with both literature data and splitting of the bands referred to the symmetric stretching mode of axial Ti–O bonds in the Raman spectra (Fig. 5). The exception is methoxy derivatives containing 0.7–0.8 organic groups per formula unit. A small size of methoxy fragments allows grafting of their greater amount without blocking adjacent vertices of titanium-oxygen octahedra, which may also explain the relatively high intensity of the Ti–O–Me vibrational bands as compared with Ti–O–H+ in the Raman spectra. All the n-alkylamine derivatives are characterized by a higher degree of the interlayer space hydration in comparison with that of the initial protonated titanates. Since direct water intercalation into the latter in the absence of amines practically does not proceed, its active insertion during the synthesis of methylamine derivatives should be associated with the expansion of the interlayer space, provided by the amine, and formation of hydrogen bonds between the amine and water. In general, probability of quantitative water intercalation into amine derivatives depends on both steric accessibility of their interlayer space and the interlayer amine polarity. Moreover, due to the simultaneous influence of both factors, the amount of intercalated water may vary with increasing the amine chain length nonmonotonously. In the case of the amine derivatives prepared in aqueous solutions (R = Me, Et, Pr, and Bu), both these solutions and precursors (protonated titanates and methylamine compounds) may serve as a source of the interlayer water. The latter in the derivatives obtained in anhydrous conditions (R = Hx and Oc), apparently, preserves from the methylamine precursors due to thermodynamic unprofitability of the transition into the less polar medium. In the case of alkoxy derivatives, their interlayer water may be both borrowed from the amine precursors and formed during the grafting reaction since one of its products is known to be water. Among the alkoxy compounds, higher hydration degrees are typical of those with shorter organic chains (particularly, of the ethoxy derivatives because ethanol was used as an azeotropic solution). The appearance of diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples (Supporting information 2) depends on the specific lanthanide cation. While, in the absence of impurities, light absorption by La-containing titanates, being white powders, is associated only with optical interband transitions occurring in the near-ultraviolet region, Nd-containing ones also have additional absorption bands in the visible range explaining their purple color. Comparison of the spectra (Supporting information 2) allows concluding that intercalation of n-alkylamines and grafting of n-alkoxy groups affect the absorption region quite weakly. The appearance of new bands in the visible region is not observed. The absolute shift of the long-wavelength edge does not exceed 16 nm and its value depends on the organic chain length nonmonotonously. This fact is quite expected since boundaries of the energy bands in semiconductor titanium oxides are known to be formed by oxygen 2p-orbitals and titanium 3d-ones [91], which are not strongly influenced by interlayer organic components. According to the SEM images (Fig. 7 and Supporting information 3), particles of the initial protonated titanates and their inorganic-organic derivatives are plate-shaped, which is typical of layered materials [92]. Powders of the samples demonstrate pronounced polydispersity, which could explain the unequal rate of organic components’ diffusion into crystals of various sizes, leading to the difficulties in the direct intercalation of amines [87,88]. The thickness of lamellar crystals of the protonated compounds is seen to be 200–600 nm; their lateral sizes are in the range of 0.5–4 μm. During the insertion of organic components, the fraction of smaller particles no larger than 1 μm increases markedly. Apparently, they are formed via the separation from larger ones during sonication of the samples in the methylamine solution as well as subsequent chemical transformations. In the case of some derivatives, partial lamination of the polycrystals, observed by the appearance of visible slits, also occurs. The formation of these slits may result in an increase in the specific surface area and make the hybrid compounds in question potential precursors for purposeful preparation of perovskite nanosheets, which are of great interest for many application areas."
11,"Thermal, vacuum and hydrolytic stability of inorganic-organic derivatives","3.4 Thermal, vacuum and hydrolytic stability of inorganic-organic derivatives TG curves of the initial titanates and their inorganic-organic derivatives obtained in an oxidative atmosphere are presented in Fig. 8 . In the case of the protonated compounds, two main sections on the curves can be distinguished. The first of them corresponding to the temperatures up to 130–230 °C (depending on specific Ln) is referred to deintercalation of the interlayer water molecules resulting in the formation of the anhydrous protonated titanate. At the second section (about 250–600 °C), the latter experiences topochemical dehydration consisting in the binding of the interlayer oxygen anions and protons in water molecules, their liberation and closing vertices of titanium-oxygen octahedra of adjacent perovskite slabs [93]. In this way, final thermolysis products follow gross formulae LnTiO3.5. Thermal degradation of the organically modified titanates proves to be more complex. Based on their TG curves as well as on the data of simultaneous thermal analysis with mass spectroscopic detection of evolving gases (STA-mass) conducted for some derivatives in our previous study [87], the following mechanism of their thermolysis can be provided. Decomposition of the n-alkylamine derivatives begins with the deintercalation of water and amine molecules taking place in the range of 50–200 °C. Their joint liberation makes it impossible to separate mass loss sections relating to the evolution of each of the interlayer components. The further course of the curves indicates that the amine deintercalation does not occur fully and the deintercalation completeness reduces with the increase in the amine chain length. In the range of 250–450 °C, topochemical dehydration of the protonated titanate and, possibly, partial degradation of the residual amine take place. The further section of the curves (450–600 °C) is characterized by the mass gain associated with partial oxidation of the carbon-containing compound. Available data do not allow establishing the specific form of the carbon existence under these conditions. Further heating (600–900 °C) leads to its complete oxidation with carbon dioxide evolution, which explains the corresponding mass loss and plateau curve output relating to the mass of the solid inorganic residue. On the contrast, the first section on the curves of the n-alkoxy derivatives (50–200 °C) relates to water deintercalation only (in the case of the n-decoxy compounds, possibly, to residual n-heptane evolution, which was used as a solvent during synthesis). Heating up to 300–400 °C leads to the partial degradation of n-alkoxy groups accompanied by carbon dioxide and water liberation. Further heating (400–550 °C), as in the case of long-chain n-alkylamine derivatives, results in the pronounced mass gain due to the partial oxidation of the residual carbon-containing component, and the gain value points to the preservation of its main part at the beginning of this section. In the high temperature range (about 550–800 °C), the carbon residue completely burns out. Moreover, the evolution of molecular alcohols does not proceed at any stage of heating, confirming the covalent nature of the n-alkoxy derivatives one more time. In the whole, total mass losses are seen to be proportional to molecular weights of intercalated n-alkylamines and grafted n-alkoxy groups. As follows from the above consideration, thermal stability of the amine derivatives is relatively low due to the absence of covalent bonding between intercalated molecules and the inorganic matrix. Consequently, work with these compounds should be carried out at a temperature not exceeding the room value. On the contrary, the covalent n-alkoxy derivatives have a much wider thermal stability range, which allows their preparation in an anhydrous form via the purposeful dehydration at temperatures up to 200 °C if necessary. The processes taking place in the range of the mass gain may also attract special attention. Particularly, strong holding of the residual amine in the interlayer space might be caused by its covalent-like binding with the perovskite slabs and further transformations might result in the formation of layered hybrid materials containing atomic or surface oxidized carbon, which could be applied as a materials design method. The results of vacuum stability tests for some of the inorganic-organic derivatives in question are summarized in the table of Supporting information 4. One can clearly see that keeping the samples under deep vacuum (∼1·10−4 atm) for 5 d leads to mass losses of 0.2–3.0% depending on the specific compound. At the same time, further vacuuming (10 d) practically does not provide any mass loss. The losses detected theoretically may be caused by the evolution of both interlayer components (first of all, amines and water) and surface adsorbed moisture or atmospheric gases. The liberation of organic modifiers of alkoxy derivatives seems to be unlikely because of strong covalent bonding with the perovskite matrix. However, it is interesting to note that vacuum mass losses are generally correlated with the amount of intercalated water (Table 2) and do not exceed the mass fraction of water in the samples. This fact suggests that, apparently, water is the main component liberating under reduced pressure. Moreover, Raman spectra of the inorganic-organic samples after 10 d vacuuming (Supporting information 5) clearly demonstrate intense vibrational bands of the interlayer organic components confirming their complete or practically complete preservation in the samples. Thus, the inorganic-organic compounds obtained may be considered vacuum stable with regard to their organic modifiers. The issue of stability in water and, in particular, the possibility of additional water intercalation is of high significance for the further use of inorganic-organic compounds in heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis and related fields. Their contact with aqueous media may lead to additional hydration of the interlayer space, changes in spatial arrangement of inserted organic components as well as their washout into a solution. Rigorous investigation of these processes requires determination of not only the structure, but also the composition of water-treated derivatives using CHN-analysis and TG. However, the primary consideration of the hydrolytic stability may be performed by the means of XRD. Comparison of the patterns of inorganic-organic derivatives before and after 10 d water treatment leads to the conclusion that none of the derivatives undergoes complete hydrolytic degradation to the protonated compounds (Supporting information 6). Nevertheless, in the case of some samples, structural changes are clearly observed. Particularly, the effect of water on the ethylamine derivative results in noticeable widening of the first (00x) reflection accompanied by its large-angle offset, which points to the formation of by-phases and interlayer space contraction, apparently associated with partial hydrolysis. The n-propylamine derivative demonstrates a slight offset of the corresponding reflection in the same way indicating the possible washout of some amine molecules into the medium. Among the n-alkoxy compounds, similar structural changes are observed for those with a medium chain length – ethoxy, n-propoxy and n-butoxy derivatives. Water treatment of the n-decoxy sample leads to the appearance of a new by-phase possessing an enlarged interlayer distance, which may be explained by additional hydration of the initial phase without hydrolysis of the interlayer n-decoxy groups. In the case of other inorganic-organic derivatives, the positions of the (00x) reflections preserve and, consequently, interlayer distances d stay the same emphasizing hydrolytic stability of the compounds. The results observed are consistent with the idea that propensity of the derivatives to hydrolysis in a broad sense is predetermined by the steric availability of their interlayer space for water molecules as well as energetic profitability of their contact with an organic component and its transition into the aqueous solution depending on the polarity. Particularly, hydrolysis of methylamine derivatives may be limited by the steric factor while that of n-hexyl and n-octylamine ones may be inhibited due to the strong difference in the water and amines polarity."
12,Conclusions,"In the present study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of preparation of hybrid inorganic-organic compounds based on layered perovskite-like titanates HLnTiO4. We have shown that, despite the relatively low chemical activity towards intercalation and grafting reactions, these substances can be transformed into n-alkylamine and n-alkoxy derivatives containing ionically and covalently bonded organic components with a various chain length in the interlayer space. The interlayer distance of the products is proportional to the sizes of inserted organic structures. They contain 0.4–0.5 organic molecules or groups per proton of the initial titanate forming a paraffin-like bilayer with an average tilting angle of 75.5°. Organic modification practically does not affect light absorption of the samples in near-ultraviolet and visible regions. However, it results in particle size reduction and their partial lamination, which makes the derivatives obtained potential precursors for the preparation of perovskite nanosheets. Thermal stability of the derivatives strongly depends on a type of chemical bonding between the inorganic matrix and organic component. Most of the hybrid compounds demonstrate good stability under reduced pressure. Being placed in an aqueous medium, some of them undergo structural changes associated, apparently, with hydration proceeding. We believe that the strategy of sequential replacement of interlayer molecules or groups by larger ones, used in this study, can be further applied for the purposed synthesis of hybrid materials with more complex organic structures providing the improvement of catalytic, photocatalytic, luminescent and other practically valuable properties."
