0,Introduction,"In recent years, the reserves of fossil fuels have been decreasing sharply, and the challenges from fossil fuel combustion have become increasingly serious. Under such circumstances, people are inevitably seeking alternative substitutes to replace depleting nonrenewable energy sources. Hydrogen energy, one of the most promising energy carriers, has been widely applied in recent years due to its renewable and environmentally friendly characteristics [1–4]. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), effective utilization of hydrogen energy should be boosted urgently [5–8]. Hydrogen (H2) possesses unique advantages, such as high energy density, renewability, and zero carbon emission, which make it the main feedstock of PEMFCs. Nevertheless, hydrogen also faces the severe challenges of low boiling point, flammability, explosiveness, and transportation difficulties. In particular, the immaturity of hydrogen storage technologies hinders the development of PEMFCs to a considerable extent [9,10]. To effectively resolve the difficulties in hydrogen storage and transportation, one feasible solution is to utilize liquid hydrogen carriers such as methanol (CH3OH) [11–13], ethanol (C2H5OH) [14–16], dimethyl ether (C2H6O) [17], etc. Among the liquid hydrogen precursors, methanol has prominent advantages of high energy density, wide resources, renewability, a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, as well as convenient storage and transportation [18,19]. Methanol steam reforming (MSR, R1) is the mainly occurred reaction during methanol conversion, which shows the superiorities of low reforming temperatures and high methanol conversion [20,21]. However, carbon monoxide could be generated due to the occurrence of methanol decomposition (MD, R2) and reverse water–gas shift (rWGS, R3). Notably, MSR is an endothermic process, which requires for an extra energy supply. On the basis of the reported approaches, the use of methanol combustion for heat supply is one of the most feasible options [12]. CH 3 OH + H 2 O → 3H 2 + CO 2 Δ H 298 0 = + 49.4 k J / m o l (R1) CH 3 OH ↔ 2H 2 + CO Δ H 298 0 = + 92.0 k J / m o l (R2) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 0 = + 41.4 k J / m o l (R3) According to the above analysis, two problems need to be resolved. First, the catalyst inevitably suffers from sintering and agglomeration, resulting in deactivation within a short period of time. Therefore, many researchers devote themselves for the improved catalyst design to further increasing the methanol conversion and reducing carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity, as well as promoting the long-term stability of the catalyst [22–26]. Second, the heat transferability and flow resistance of an MSR reactor maybe restricted by each other, thereby affecting hydrogen production efficiency. Thus, a new-generation methanol steam reformer, and a revised structure for its microchannel in particular, are urgently needed. Among the relevant reformers, microreactors have attracted much attention due to their specially designed microchannel structures, which can improve the specific surface area of the reactor, reduce the boundary layer thickness of the fluid, and enhance heat transfer performance [27–30]. In addition, the catalyst can be directly coated on the inner surface of the microchannel to maximize the structural advantages of the microchannel reactor and achieve the highest hydrogen production rate [31]. Microchannel reactors are a typical type of microreactor that demonstrate satisfied compatibility and high working efficiency. Also, they can be compactly integrated with the high-temperature PEMFC, so as to achieve the energy cascade utilization and on-board hydrogen supply without significantly increasing the scale of the entire system [32–35]. On the whole, the microchannel reactor has gradually become a research focus. Microchannel reactors with diverse structures have been reported on by many scholars. According the study by Liu et al., microchannels can be generally classified into two major types: ordered microchannels (for substrate materials) and 3D network microchannels (for porous materials) [36]. The ordered microchannels have been widely investigated due to their flexibility and convenience of design. The ordered microchannels can be designed and constructed using different substrate materials, such as siliconsubstrate, stainlesssteel, metallictitanium, etc., by microcutting, nontraditional processing, or micro-electro-mechanical system technology [37–39]. Numerous numerical and experimental studies regarding the structural design of ordered microchannel reformers have sprung up in 21st century. Ribeirinha et al. [40] proposed the combination of a high-temperature PEMFC with a methanol steam reformer after numerical simulation. Both the fuel cell and the reforming chamber use the serpentine direct microchannel (a serpentine single flow path, abbreviated as DM, see Fig. S1a), in which the reactions of MSR, rWGS, and MD were considered in their calculation. The poisoning effect of CO on the electro-catalytic activity of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was also evaluated. As a result, both the rise of the space–time ratio and the reforming temperature can result in an increase in CO concentration. In a study by Mei et al. [41], an A-type microchannel reactor with a flow pattern of one inlet and two outlets was putforward to optimize the traditional Z-type design (parallel microchannel which owns multiple flow paths, see Fig. S1b). With a combination of simulation and experiments, it was discovered that the component distributions in the A-type microchannel reactor were more homogeneous than those in the Z-type. Moreover, the innovative design of the microchannel reactor increased methanol conversion by 8% and decreased pressure drop by 20%, but the CO concentration tended to have a slight increase with this design. Kundu et al. [42] studied the performance of direct microchannel and parallel microchannel designs through comparative experiments. Their results revealed that the direct-type microchannel is always superior to the parallel-type in terms of H2 production performance (methanol conversion was 50% vs 40%, respectively, in steady state) and catalyst durability. Except for the above-mentioned types, there are also plenty of other varieties of microchannels, including spiral-type [43], radial-type [44], honeycomb-type [45], microarray-type [21,30], fractal-type [41,46–49], and ridge-type microchannels [50] among others (See Fig. S1c-j). While researchers have paid much attention to the development of new microchannels with various structures, relatively few scholars have focused on local structural improvements to the commonly used direct microchannel design. The effects of sinusoidal waves [51–58] and dimple structures [59–61] on heat transfer performance have been widely investigated due to their ability to enhance thermal and mass transportation. However, to the best of our knowledge, the structural effects of sinusoidal waves and dimples on MSR performance, including their potential as superior prospects in the field of microchannel design, have yet to be addressed. On this basis, the concepts of sinusoidal and dimple modification allow for the derivation of three new structured microchannels based on a DM design: direct microchannel with dimples (DMD), sinusoidal microchannel (SM), and sinusoidal microchannel with dimples (SMD). The objective of this study is to 1) comparatively analyze four different reforming microchannels with respect to heat and mass transfer by CFD simulation and further obtain the optimal structure of the microchannel and 2) experimentally verify the simulation results, optimizing the reaction conditions with the use of the SMD for the achievement of high H2 production yield and low CO concentration."
1,Methodology,
2,Simulation details,"2.1 Simulation details The microchannel reactor is composed of an evaporation chamber and a methanol steam reformer. For a typical MSR process, the premixed methanol aqueous solution first enters the evaporation chamber at ambienttemperature and completes its gasification at the outlet of the evaporator. Afterward, the gaseous reactants enter the methanol steam reformer and the chemical reactions occur under catalysis at the surface of the microchannel accompanied by the systematic flow and heat transfer. The commercial simulation software ANSYS Fluent 19.0 was employed to reveal the flow characteristics and heat transfer capacity of the four different structured microchannels (DM, DMD, SM, and SMD). The models and the manufactured reforming plates are shown in Fig. 1 . From the perspective of thermal mass transport, the influence of sinusoidal waves, dimples, and their combined structures will be discussed below, and the microchannel with the best performance in the simulation will be validated by experimental tests. 2.1.1 Geometric descriptions For the sinusoidal wave structure design, a relatively low-amplitude sinusoidal wave was adopted. Dimples can be divided into two types: concave and convex, both residing inside the microchannel. Comparing their flow resistance and heat transfer characteristics, the concave-type dimple generally shows better performance than the convex-type one given the same dimple size [60]. Moreover, the manufacturing costs of the concave-type are less than those of the convex type. Therefore, concave-type dimples were utilized here. The shape of dimples was selected to be a semi-ellipsoid structure, and a moderate size was adopted to ensure representativeness. The dimples were placed at the bottom of the microchannel and their arrangement was equidistant. The corresponding structural parameters of microchannels and dimples are listed in Table 1 . To simplify the calculation process and save computingresources, two flow microchannels (back and forth) and the period of the overall flow channel were selected as the final simulation area. The vertical inlet and outlet (2 mm height) were also taken into account to show the inlet/outlet effect. A diagram of simulation units is provided in Fig. S2. 2.1.2 Model descriptions The simulation model was developed based on the following assumptions: i) The flowing gas is assumed to be a mixture of methanol vapor and water vapor; ii) the gas flow in the microchannel is compressible, steady, and laminar; iii) the dimpled subface is a constant-temperature heating wall, while the other is an adiabatic wall; iv) the effects of gravity and radiation are neglected. The governing equations employed in the theoretical model are shown below [48,62–64]: Continuity equation: (1) ∇ · ( ρ mix V → ) = 0 where ρ mix is the density of flow gas, and V → is the vector of flow velocity. The calculation of ρ mix follows the law of incompressible ideal gas. Momentum equations: (2) V → · ∇ ( ρ mix V → ) = - ∇ P + ∇ · ( μ mix ∇ V → ) where P and μ mix are the pressure and the viscosity of flow gas respectively. μ mix is set to be constant. Species equations: (3) V → · ∇ C i = ∇ 2 ( D k C i ) where C i is the molar fraction of the i th species: CH3OH and H2O, while D k refers to the mass diffusivity. D k is set to be constant. Energy equation: (4) V → · ∇ · ( ρ mix C p , mix T ) = ∇ · ( λ mix ∇ T ) where C p , m i x , T , and λ mix are the specific heat capacity, temperature, and thermal conductivity of the flow gas. The calculation of C p , m i x follows the mixing law. λ mix is set to be constant. The specific values of the parameters mentioned above are also presented in Table S1. 2.1.3 Boundary conditions According to the assumptions, the boundary conditions utilized in ANSYS Fluent 19.0 are as follows: i) The inlet temperature is 180 ℃ and the type of inlet is a velocity inlet. The velocity of the microchannel inlet depends on the steam/CH3OH (S/C) mole ratio in a methanol solution and the volume flow of liquid feed into the evaporator. With a ratio of 1.2 and a volume flow of 1.0 mL/min, the velocity is 20.8634 m/s. The molar fractions of CH3OH and H2O can be calculated from the S/C mole ratio under a specific temperature. ii) The outlet is set as a pressure outlet, and the relativepressure is 0 Pa. iii) The subface of the microchannel is set to be temperature-constant with no sliding wall (240 ℃), while the other surfaces are all adiabatic with no sliding wall. 2.1.4 Mesh independence analysis The mesh was generated by Meshing (the meshing software in ANSYS 19.0). In consideration of the calculation accuracy, the expansion layer (five layers in total) was set on the subface and the mesh was encrypted where the geometry changes greatly (part of the mesh is shown in Fig. S3). A density-based algorithm was used in the simulation to do steady-state calculations, while the implicit difference method was employed to discretize the governing equations under the above boundary conditions. As for the solution methods, the gradient of spatial discretization, the flow of spatial discretization, and the flux type were, respectively, set to the least square based cell, the second-order upwind, and the Roe-FDS. The calculation was solved by the Guass-Seidal iterative method, and the convergence time was shortened by adjusting the relaxing factor. In the iteration process, if the residuals of equation parameters, the pressure of the inlet, and the mass flow rate relative difference between the inlet and outlet drop to 10-5, 10-5, and 1%, respectively, the calculation is considered to be successfully convergent. To analyze mesh independence, flow and heat transfer performances were evaluated by the heat transfer efficiency factor, Nusselt number, resistance coefficient, and Reynolds number, as defined below: Heat Transfer Efficiency Factor ( HTEF ): (5) HTEF = Nu / N u 0 ( f / f 0 ) 1 / 3 where Nu and f represent the Nusselt number and resistance coefficient, respectively. Subscript 0 denotes the parameter of DM. Nusselt Number ( Nu ): (6) Nu = q ( T w - T f ) d λ mix where q , d , T w , and T f represent the heat flux of the heat transfer surface, the diameter of velocity-inlet, the temperature of the heat exchange surface, and the average temperature of flow gas, respectively. Resistance Coefficient ( f ): (7) f = 2 Δ P d l ρ mix ¯ v 2 where Δ P , l , v , and ρ mix ¯ denote pressure drop between velocity-inlet and pressure-outlet, the center length of the microchannel, the velocity of the inlet, and the mean density of flow gas, respectively. Reynolds Number ( Re ): (8) Re = ρ mix ¯ v d μ mix The specific values of the parameters mentioned above are also presented in Table S1. The SMD was selected as the case for mesh independence analysis. Five grid schemes were constructed with varying element numbers of 200, 400, 800, 1,000, and 1,200 thousand, respectively, and the basic computational results are listed in Table 2 . Generally, mesh numbers need to be reduced as far as possible under the premise of ensuring a certain calculation accuracy (less than1%) to save computation resources. Therefore, the number of standard meshes was set to 1 million in this procedure."
3,Experimental details,"2.2 Experimental details In this part, the fabrication details of the microreactor, the preparation and coating of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, the catalysts characterization, and the experimental system are introduced. 2.2.1 Fabrication of the microreactor The composition diagram of the microreactor is shown in Fig. 2 . The microreactor is mainly consisted of a vaporizing plate, a reforming plate, and a splitter plate. In the process of assembly, the vaporizing plate and the reforming plate were respectively placed on the two sides of the splitter plate, and were sealed by two fluorine rubber rings among three plates. Moreover, it is worthy of mentioning that the heat required by MSR is provided by the electrical heating of the heating rods, taking into account the convenience and controllability. The components of the microreactor were manufactured by GAOSSUNION (TIANJIN) PHOTOELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. The size of the titanium plates was 90 mm × 90 mm × 10 mm, and the microchannel structureparameters can be seen in Table 1. 2.2.2 Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst preparation The Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by a citric acid assisted sol–gel method. In a typical preparation procedure, copper nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), zinc nitrate hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate hydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), and citricacid are mixed according to desired mole ratios (3:3:4:13). The resulting mixture was dissolved in deionized (DI) water with constant stirring at 80 ℃ until the formation of the gel was complete. The material was then put into the drying oven at 180 ℃ for 5 h. Subsequently, the formed powder was homogeneously ground, followed by calcination in a muffle furnace at 350 ℃ for 2 h with a heating rate of 2.5 ℃/min. Afterward, the calcined power was put into a horizontal furnace at 300 ℃ (heating rate of 15 ℃/min) for an hour under the feeding of 20 mL/min H2 and 60 mL/min N2 for reduction. 2.2.3 Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst coating As shown in Fig. S4, the creation of the catalyst coating technology is divided into four parts. First is the pretreatment process, second is the preparation of the catalyst slurry, third is the coating process, and fourth is the posttreatment process. In the pretreatment process, the reforming plates were first oscillated in an ultrasonic cleaner at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the pretreated plates were dried in a drying oven at 80 ℃ for 30 min. In the preparation of the catalyst slurry, the catalyst was reduced again to ensure the complete generation of Cu0. Subsequently, 1.000 g of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was mixed with 9.000 g polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution (5 wt% in DI water), and the mixture was treated ultrasonically for 30 min and then stirred for 6 h, both at room temperature. In a typical coating process, 2.000 g of catalyst slurry was evenly injected into the reforming microchannel. After that, the coated reforming plates were dried at room temperature for 12 h, followed by putting the coated plate into the 180 ℃ drying oven for three hours in order to obtain a better coating strength for the catalyst (post-treatment process). 2.2.4 Catalyst characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was conducted to detect the micro-morphology of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst coating using HITACHISU8010 instrument with acold field emission gun. The element (Cu, Zn, Al, O) distribution in the catalyst coating surface was detected byenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The phase evolution of as-prepared CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (AP-CuZnAl), reduced Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (R-CuZnAl), and tested Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (T-CuZnAl) was measured by an Advance D8 X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), developed by the Bruker Corporation, Germany. The CuKα radiation source (λ = 0.154178 nm) was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA from 10° to 90° with a scanning rate of 7.39 °/min and a step size of 0.02°. 2.2.5 Experimental system The experimental system mainly consisted of a microreactor, start-up systems, automatic control systems, and analytic systems, as shown in Fig. S5. Before the experiments, N2 was poured into the microreactor to remove impurities. Then, the microreactor was preheated and stabilized to a specific temperature (180–250 ℃), which is accomplished by the heating rods, K-type thermocouples, and a digital PID temperature intelligent controller (PIDTC). After this step, the premixed methanol aqueous solution was injected into the microreactor by a high-pressure constant current pump (HCCP). N2, the calibrationgas, was also fed into the microreactor at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, controlled by a mass flow controller (MFC). As for the outlet of the microreactor, the unreacted material was cooled down and collected by a buffer bottle, and the reforming gas was collected through the gas bag or directly measured by a gas chromatograph (GC) for analysis. In a typical experiment, DMD was employed as the vaporizing plate, and DM, DMD, SM, or SMD was utilized as the reforming plate. Catalyst slurry at the amount of 2.000 g (contains 0.2000 g of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst) was injected into the reforming plate for each test. The effects of microchannel structures (DM, DMD, SM, and SMD), S/C mole ratios (1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0), and the feeding flux of the solution (0.005 mL/min, 0.010 mL/min, 0.015 mL/min, 0.020 mL/min, and 0.025 mL/min) on methanol reforming performance were explored. The responses to the condition changes with R-CuZnAl applied were also investigated. The H2 production performance evaluation indexes in this work can be calculated through the following equations: H2 production rate, Ψ(H2, mmol/min): (9) ψ ( H 2 ) = C ( H 2 ) C ( N 2 ) ψ ( N 2 ) where Ψ(N2, mmol/min), C(H2, vol%), and C(N2, vol%) are the outlet N2 flow rate, H2 concentration, and N2 concentration, respectively. Ψ(N2) is calculated by the mass flow rate of feeding N2 while C(H2) and C(N2) are obtained by GC. In our experiments, H2 production rates can be divided into the average H2 production rates (corresponding to the gas bag test) and the instantaneous H2 production rates (corresponding to the real-time detection by GC). The H utilization efficiency, X(H, %), is defined as: (10) X ( H ) = 2 ψ ( H 2 ) 4 ψ ( CH 3 OH ) + 2 ψ ( H 2 O ) × 100 % where Ψ(CH3OH, mmol/min) and Ψ(H2O, mmol/min) are the mole feeding rates of CH3OH and H2O. H utilization efficiency reflects the comprehensive performance of methanol conversion and H2 selectivity. The relative concentrations of H2, CO, and CO2, FC(H2, vol%), FC(CO, vol%), and FC(CO2, vol%), are calculated as: (11) FC ( i ) = C ( i ) C ( H 2 ) + C ( CO ) + C ( CO 2 ) × 100 % where C(i, vol%) denotes the concentration of i (i = H2, CO, or CO2), and N2 is excluded when calculating the relative concentration. Concentrations in the later sections refer to relative concentrations by default, unless otherwise specified."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Numerical simulation,"3.1 Numerical simulation Numerical simulation was conducted to uncover the flow and heat transfer performance of four different microchannels. The effect of microchannel types on the flow and heat transfer characteristics was evaluated by f, Nu, and HTEF, as displayed in Fig. 3 . Among the characterization parameters, f shows the flow resistance characteristics, Nu reveals the heat transfer intensity of the microchannels, and HTEF represents a comprehensive indicator of the resistance coefficient and Nusselt number. An HTEF number greater than 1.00 suggests an improvement in heat transfer intensity and/or a reduction in flow resistance. The HTEF number follows the order of SMD > SM > DMD > DM, which indicates that the SMD performed the best among the candidates in this experiment. It can also be seen that both f and Nu increased with the introduction of sinusoidal-type structures, while the HTEF of SM increased by 0.10 compared with that of DM, indicating that the sinusoidal-type microchannel can, to some extent, improve flow and heat transfer properties [54–57]. Compared with the sinusoidal structure, the dimple structure constitutes a local modification of the microchannel, leaving the primary flow pattern unchanged [60], which makes the introduction of a dimple structure less effective than a sinusoidal structure. It should be noted that the structure change from SM to SMD can slightly reduce f, but this same change was not observed in the switch from DM to DMD. Generally, the introduction of dimple-type structures should increase f compared to the original. Such a phenomenon occurred in DM, but the opposite result was observed in the case of SM. This abnormal phenomenon may be attributed to the special drag reduction mechanism of the dimples: Dimples can reduce the resistance coefficient under laminar conditions. To take a typical example, the dimpled surface of a golf ball can greatly reduce the drag coefficient and make the ball fly farther. It has also been reported that the drag reduction mechanism of dimples occurs by creating an earlier boundary transition from laminar to turbulent, which results in a shift from fluid-wall friction to fluid–fluid friction, thereby reducing the drag in laminar flow [65–70]. To sum up, dimples can enhance heat transferability and keep f basically stable, which seems to be in line with expectations. 3.1.1 The enhancing effect of sinusoidal types The enhancement mechanism in the heat and mass transfer of the sinusoidal wave structure can be mainly ascribed to two aspects. First, macroscopically, the sinusoidal waves can constantly change the species flow direction, which leads to the periodic mixing of hot and the cold fluids. Also, the temperature difference can be increased to aid the heat transfer between the gas flow and the thermostatic wall, while the resistance coefficient also increases due to the promotion of friction between the fluid and the wall (See Fig. 4 ). Similarly, due to the heating effect of the constant-temperature wall, the closer to the constant-temperature wall, the higher the temperature of the flowing gas, which displays a vertically oriented gradient change, with high temperature at the bottom and low temperature at the top. In temperature nephograms of SM, the high-temperature and low-temperature areas have large, periodic lateral migration in the flow direction. As a result, the hot and the cold fluids periodically mix due to the inertance of the flow and the mixing effect of the sinusoidal waves. Furthermore, it can be observed in the density nephograms of SM that the gradient changes are very similar to the temperature nephograms, owing to the negative correlation between the temperature and density of an ideal gas. The second aspect under consideration here works at the microscopic level. That is, the introduction of waves in the microchannel interrupts the growth of the boundary layer by the frequent occurrence of flow separation and reattachment, which leads to the destabilization of flow and an increase in the resistance coefficient [55]. Regarding heat transfer, both separated flow and oscillatory flow occur in the wavy channel because of the flow inertia, which can further enhance the fluid disturbance and heat transfer intensity [55]. Additionally, the influence of sinusoidal waves on the heat and mass transfer performance of microchannels is relevant to structural parameters, such as sinusoidal amplitude, sinusoidal period, and phase position [55]. The simulation results are in agreement with previous research; the sinusoidal-type microchannel shows obvious superiority from the perspective of heat and mass transport. 3.1.2 The enhancing effect of dimple types The enhanced heat and mass transfer mechanism of a dimpled structure can also be considered in two aspects. First, dimples expand the surface area, which can effectively increase the heat transfer area of the microchannel in comparison to a flat one. Second, the presence of dimples forces the boundary layer at the thermostatic wall into a discontinuous growth state, which is followed by the generation of an intermittent boundary layer, further increasing the local degree of turbulence. The above series of phenomena can effectively enhance the heat transfer performance of the dimpled microchannel [61]. The primary vortex core distribution diagram of the flowing gas is shown in Fig. 5 . It should be noted that the vortex cores are mainly located at the inlet, outlet, corner, and dimples, where large vortices and a dense area of vorticity are formed. This also means that there are many secondary flows and eddies in these locations, and heat transfer in these areas can be greatly promoted, accompanying the increase in the resistance coefficient. In the area of the inlet, outlet, and corner, the flow direction of the gas has a 90°change, giving the gas a large scouring effect on the surrounding wall surface (as the relative velocity has been greatly improved locally); backflow formation in the local area is expected due to the effect of inertia. Therefore, the heat transfer intensity of the inlet, outlet, and corner is higher than in other places, and a large number of vortex cores can be identified. Regarding the dimple structure, it can be directly observed from Fig. 5(d) that a large eddy current is formed inside the dimple, and the gas flow appears to be irregular and unstable, which is a reflection of the enhanced heat and mass transfer under the dimple structure. As to the drag reduction effect of dimples mentioned above, it tends to occur with higher local Reynolds numbers [60,65,67], and the disturbance created by the sinusoidal waves increases the local turbulence, which explains why the drag reduction was observed only in the microchannel with sinusoidal waves. Additionally, the effect of the dimple-type structure is different depending on the geometric characteristics and arrangement of dimples [61], which suggests that better comprehensive performance of dimples can be obtained through optimization. In summary, the numerical simulation results of the four differently structured microchannels have been detailed here, and the comprehensive performance of SMD is the best among the analyzed microchannels from the perspective of heat and mass transport. Therefore, SMD was utilized for further experimental exploration to optimize methanol reforming performance."
6,Experimental investigation,"3.2 Experimental investigation Experiments on the effect of microchannel structures on MSR performance were carried out in order to understand the relationship between the heat and mass transfer properties and hydrogen production performance. Experiments on the effects of MSR temperatures, methanol feeding fluxes, and S/C mole ratios with SMD were conducted for microchannel-based parameter optimization. Innovatively, the response to condition regulation as well as the performance evaluation of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst were also discussed in order to present the dynamic performance of the microreactor with SMD. 3.2.1 Catalyst characterization SEM measurements were carried out to show a correct deposition of the catalyst on the channels walls, while results of the coated Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst were shown in Fig. 6 . From the SEM coating images, it is observed from Fig. 6a and b that the surface of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst presents an overall irregular blocky structure. As for the high-resolution SEM images, the flake structures can be clearly observed, which were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the catalyst (see Fig. 6a3–a5). To further analyze the elemental distribution of catalyst near the surface, the EDS mapping were carried out, which is presented in Fig. 6c–f. Results indicate the uniformly dispersion of Cu, Zn, Al, and O. Moreover, the results of the EDS spectra is in agreement with the mapping results, further confirming the presence of Cu, Zn, Al, and O elements (See Fig. 6g). 3.2.2 Model validation In simulation, the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the four microchannels were considered, and the HTEF numbers follow the sequence of SMD > SM > DMD > DM. However, the differences between the microchannels in terms of MSR performance are yet to be investigated. Whether this would also follow the rules and findings of the simulation is worthy of further research and verification. Here, comparisons of H2 production performance under different microchannels were carried out by the experimental tests, as shown in Fig. 7 . The adopted experimental conditions will be discussed in-depth in section 3.2. The structure shows little effect on the H2 concentration, which remains stable in various microchannels; on the contrary, the H utilization efficiency evolved significantly as the type of microchannel changes, following the order of SMD > SM > DMD > DM. Results indicate that the performance ranking order among four microchannels is completely consistent with the simulation, which verified the reliability of the numerical results to some extent. Additionally, it is worth emphasizing that no CO was produced for any of the tested microchannels. Results also show that modifications to the sinusoidal waves and dimple structure in the microreactor can greatly promote H utilization efficiency under the same MSR conditions. Meanwhile, the results also confirm that the MSR reaction is highly correlated with the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the microchannel. Consequently, the superiority of SMD is convincingly proved based on the simulation analysis and experimental measurements. 3.2.3 Effect of MSR temperature MSR is a strongly endothermic reaction, and the selection of temperature has a significant impact on the reaction characteristics. Therefore, the reaction temperature was first explored in order to understand its influence. The effect of reaction temperatures was studied by varying the reaction temperature from 180 ℃ to 250 ℃ under the conditions of N2 flow rate at 10 mL/min, methanol solution feeding flux at 0.005 mL/min, S/C mole ratio at 1.2, and the coating amount of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 0.200 g (See Fig. 8 ). The error bands of CO concentration and H utilization efficiency were obtained by the second experiment under the same conditions without updating the catalyst slurry. CO production could not be found with the temperature below 210 ℃. However, CO began to form, and the concentration gradually increased as the temperature rose further, which can be attributed to the endothermic reactions of MD and rWGS, promoting the equilibrium of MD and rWGS in the direction of producing CO. Moreover, the increase in H utilization efficiency can primarily be ascribed to the improvement in methanol conversion. The results imply that there should be an optimal temperature interval to simultaneously remain at high H utilization efficiency, low CO concentration, and low systematic energy consumption. To achieve the integration of a low-temperature PEMFC with an SMD microreactor, the CO concentration must be considered, which should be less than 10 ppm in this case [71]. By comprehensively optimizing the factors mentioned above, 210 ℃ was selected as the optimal temperature for the subsequent experiments. 3.2.4 Effects of methanol feeding flux and S/C mole ratio The effects of methanol feeding flux (0.005–0.025 mL/min) and S/C mole ratio (1.0–2.0) were studied under the conditions of N2 flow rate at 10 mL/min, MSR temperature at 210 ℃, and the coating amount of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 0.200 g. As shown in Fig. 9 a and 9b, a rise in the feeding flux lead to a decrease in H utilization efficiency, which can be attributed to the reduction of the residence time per unit of mass of reactants in the microreactor, decreasing the period for methanol catalytic activation. Moreover, H utilization efficiency demonstrated an overall decreasing tendency with increases in the S/C mole ratio. Similarly, the hydrogen yields increased with the feeding fluxes, while they decreased with increases in S/C mole ratios, as illustrated in Fig. 9c. It is also worth noting that no CO was generated during the entire experiment. Based on the above analysis, the optimizations of feeding flux and S/C mole ratio are necessary for the promotion of the energy conversion efficiency of the microreactor as well as the H utilization efficiency. Additionally, it could be concluded that the feeding flux is the dominant variable for both H utilization efficiency and hydrogen yields; the effect of S/C mole ratio was seen to be less decisive for H utilization efficiency. The synergistic effect of the methanol feeding flux and the S/C mole ratio on H utilization efficiency was explored, as displayed in Fig. 9d. H utilization efficiency improved with decreases in both methanol feeding flux and S/C mole ratio, which can be attributed to the restriction of steam conversion. On the basis of the above analysis, the methanol feeding flux at 0.003 mL/min and the S/C mole ratio at 1.2 were selected. The H utilization efficiency nephogram with feeding flux and S/C mole ratio is shown in Fig. S6. 3.2.5 Response to feeding flux modulation In the practical application for in-situ hydrogen supply, the output of the microreactor must be regulated according to the requirements of PEMFCs, which demand excellent dynamic performance that can adapt to varying working conditions. The changing parameters may include the feeding flux, MSR temperature, the inlet temperature of the feedstock, etc. [11,72]. Among these parameters, feeding flux would be one of the most flexible operations. Thus, the response of MSR performance to feeding flux changes was studied in order to evaluate the dynamic properties of the SMD microreactor (See Fig. 10 ). With the rise of the methanol solution feeding flux, the H utilization efficiency shows a downward trend, and H2 concentration displays a slightly increasing tendency asawhole, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 10 and Figs. S7–S9. As presented in Fig. 10, the H2 concentration remains relatively stable, basically independent of the feeding flux. However, the H2 concentration performs an increasing tendency under relatively high feeding rates (greater than0.015 mL/min). The phenomenon could be attributed to the promotion of by-products conversion under a high steam involving condition. The promotion of by-products conversion generates more H2 and CO2, whose mole ratio (H2/CO2) theoretically equals to 3: 1, thereby to some extent improve the H2-to-CO2 mole ratio [73–77]. It can also be seen from Figs. S7–S9 that the concentration of H2 underwent a slight increase, from an average of 72.2% to an average of 73.5%, with an increase in S/C mole ratio from 1.4 to 1.8. As for the evolution of H utilization efficiency, an overall decreasing tendency can be observed as the feeding flux increases while the H2 concentration remains basically unchanged. It is also indicated that the methanol conversion rate decreases with the increase of feeding flux, owing to the shortened residence time and the lowered reforming ability for steam. Additionally, the transient response to the feeding flux adjustment was studied. Results reveal that the evolution of the H utilization efficiency can be divided into three stages: the declining stage, the ascending stage, and the stabilizing stage. H utilization efficiency can be stabilized for approximately 20 min. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: when the feeding flux of the reactants increases, more heat would be required during the evaporating and reforming processes in the microreactor, causing transient decreases in the temperature distribution field of the reforming chamber. The decreases are local drops in temperature, just like local cold spots, which may not be fed back to the controller in real time by the thermocouples but have a considerable adverse effect on the MSR performance. As a result, in the declining stage, both the CH3OH conversion rate and the H utilization efficiency decrease. In the ascending stage or even before it, the thermocouples detect the temperature change, feed back to the controller which timely corrects the temperature by controlling the heaters. Subsequently, the temperature level gradually recovers with times, leading to an increase in the H utilization efficiency. Finally, at the stabilizing stage, the H utilization efficiency tends to be stable. For in-situ hydrogen supply, the shorter the response duration, the better the performance of the microreactor, which indicates that the temperature control system should be as sensitive as possible and designed according to the requirements on the premise of temperature stability. 3.2.6 Long-term stability test Cu-based catalysts are more active while more easily to be deactivated than noble-metal ones. Therefore, it is essential to test the catalytic durability of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. The long-term experimental results with applied Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst are provided in Fig. S10. Within 13 h, the H utilization efficiency and instantaneous hydrogen production rate increased significantly during the start-up phase and decreased gradually during the attenuation phase. The H utilization efficiency decreased to around 50% and the instantaneous hydrogen production rate decreased by approximately 25%. Notably, both H utilization efficiency and instantaneous hydrogen production rate show a certain extent of fluctuating tendency, which could be attributed to the following two aspects: 1) the physiochemical properties of the catalyst vary with the long-term experiment progresses; 2) the feeding fluxes of the high pressure constant current pump exist periodically unstable supply, leading to the inhomogeneous distribution of the temperature fields in evaporation and reforming chambers. Additionally, in the start-up phase, the reason for the quick improvement in catalyst performance may lie in the reduction of Cu x O to Cu0, leading to the rapid improvement in catalytic activity. In the attenuation phase, the decline of hydrogen production can be attributed to the performance degradation of the catalyst. To further clarify the reason for catalyst deactivation, XRD measurements were conducted for the AP-CuZnAl, R-CuZnAl, and T-CuZnAl samples (See Fig. S11). The as-prepared sample is mainly composed of CuO (JCPDS 45-0937) and ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). However, the peak intensity of Al2O3 was not detected, which may be attributed to its homogeneous distribution in the composite oxides, while for R-CuZnAl and T-CuZnAl samples, Cu (JCPDS 04-0836) and ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) are the main components. However, the peak intensity of the T-CuZnAl sample was stronger than that of the R-CuZnAl sample, implying that the increase in crystallite sizes is a function of MSR time. Moreover, the crystallite sizes of Cu (200) facets increased from 20.3 nm to 23.5 nm, according to the Scherrer equation, elucidating the occurrence of sintering and agglomeration of the tested catalyst (see Table S2 for detailed crystallite size evolution). In summary, the sintering and agglomeration of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst results in the reduced catalytic activity. Given the shortcomings of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts in a microreactor with SMD, it is crucial to improve the stability and exploit a new-generation coating method, further realizing an in-situ hydrogen supply. Furthermore, the flow microchannel structure can be further designed and improved to facilitate the operational stability of the microreactor in a long-term, sustainable way."
7,Conclusions,"In this study, sinusoidal waves and dimple structure were synchronously introduced to comprehensively improve the performance of the DM with the achievement of an on-board hydrogen supply. Both numerical simulations and experimental investigations were carried out. The detailed conclusions can be stated as follows: i) Results from the CFD simulation found that the sinusoidal waves (SM) can both increase Nu by 0.38 and f by 0.023 compared with DM, which can be attributed to the enhancement in the mixing of hot and cold fluid with the formation of separation flow and oscillating flow from the sinusoidal waves. ii) Dimple structure can improve Nu by 0.16 (compare SMD to SM) with a relatively stable f remaining, which can be ascribed to the improvement in the heat exchange area due to the expanded surface with the formation of vortices and secondary flow. iii) Results from the experiments indicate that the optimal MSR conditions are temperature at 210 ℃, methanol feeding flux at 0.003 mL/min, S/C mole ratio at 1.2, under the SMD-structured reforming microchannel, and with a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. iv) The dynamic performance of the microreactor was assessed by investigating the responses to the feeding flux step change. The H2 concentration is independent of the feeding flux, while the H utilization efficiency exhibits a decreasing tendency with increases in the feeding flux. v) Similarly, the microchannel structure shows little effect on the H2 concentration. However, the H utilization efficiency evolved significantly as the type of microchannel changed, following the order of SMD > SM > DMD > DM. Future investigations would suggest potential changes to the structure parameters for the optimization of the sinusoidal- and dimple-type microchannels as well as alterations to the design of the highly active MSR catalysts for further enhanced stability."
