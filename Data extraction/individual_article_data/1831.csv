0,Introduction,"Limited fossil energy reserves, energy consumption, and environmental pollution as well as rapidly increasing energy demand are the serious energy problems of the world. Enormous efforts have been invested in exploring new clean and sustainable energy sources to tackle the increasingly serious energy problem [1,2]. Among various renewable energies, hydrogen has many advantages such as high energy density, and environmentally friendly [3,4]. It is considered to be an ideal alternative renewable energy for fossil energy sources. Hydrogen can be produced from non-renewable and renewable energy resources, such as steam reforming of methane, coal gasification, oil reforming, and water electrolysis. Among various hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy is known as one of the cleanest methods for zero carbon dioxide emission [5–7]. However, electrolytic cells require economical and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) to achieve the industrial requirement of large cathode current densities at low overpotentials [8,9]. The most advanced HER electrocatalysts are the well-known Pt-based materials, but the high cost and scarcity of Pt directly limit their widespread application in practice [10]. To meet the needs of large-scale and low-cost hydrogen production in industry, the search for highly active and stable electrocatalyst for HER is urgent in the hydrogen energy field [11]. In recent years, many transition metal-based electrocatalysts such as alloys [12], carbides [13], sulfides [14], phosphides [15], selenides [16,17] have been studied as promising catalysts for HER in alkaline electrolytes. Among these electrocatalysts, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been widely proved as efficient catalysts for water splitting [18,19]. TMPs have a specific structure, which leads to more unsaturated surface atoms on the surface. Due to the larger atomic radius of P in TMPs, the intrinsic catalytic activity of TMPs is improved. Jiao et al. [20] reported that an overpotential of 90 mV of Co0.5Ni0.5P was required to deliver a current density of − 10 mA cm−2. The P atom in TMPs has a high electronegativity and negative charge, which make it easy to adsorb protons in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Besides, it is observed that the performance of the bimetallic catalyst system is better than that of individual metal counterparts. The formation of a bimetallic structure can change the surface charge density, augment electrochemically active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic activity [21]. Li et al. [22] found that the Co-doping in Ni2P not only effectively regulated the catalytic activity of the surface active sites but also reduced the charge transfer resistance and accelerated the charge transfer. Zhang et al. [23] demonstrated that the synergistic effect of Ni and Co made a tremendous contribution to the impressive pH-universal performances of NiCo2Px catalyst. To further enhance the electrocatalytic activity, direct growth of catalyst active components on conductive carbon materials or metal substrates was proved to be an effective strategy. Wang et al. [24] reported direct growth of the binder-free hierarchical NiMoP2 nanowires on a three-dimensional carbon cloth. A self-supporting structure can not only promote the transportation of mass and electrons but also reduce the catalyst disintegration tendency in the gas production process. To reach as high current density as − 100 mA cm−2 for HER, the as low overpotential as 199 mV is required. Electrodeposition is a common method to prepare bimetallic phosphides with active components grown directly on conductive substrates. However, the currently reported preparation method is basically consisted of two steps: the first is to prepare the precursor material by electrodeposition and the second step is to obtain the bimetallic phosphides by the high-temperature phosphating treatment [25]. As thus, the low preparation efficiency and multi-step treatment increase the cost of catalyst preparation, and PH3 generation in the process will cause environmental pollution [26]. On the other hand, it is known that the phosphide materials obtained by calcination at high temperatures are almost crystal materials. Compared with crystalline materials, amorphous materials have unique structural advantages, such as flexibility and growth disorder. In addition, the surface of the amorphous materials are rich in defects and active sites, which facilitate the adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst surface [27–29]. Shan et al. [30] demonstrated that the hierarchical amorphous CoMoSx electrocatalyst showed satisfactory catalytic performances and stability for overall water splitting in alkaline solution because of enriched defects and active sites enhance the activity for HER in amorphous electrode materials. Duan et al.[31] reported that the NiFeMo oxide catalyst with low crystallization and a large number of defects or amorphous structures had the advantages of long disordered range and isotropy, which are conducive to exposing more active sites and the adsorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface. Wang et al. [32] demonstrated that remarkable electrical conductivity and fast water-splitting reaction kinetics of the amorphous structure enabled the Co-Mo-P-O electrocatalyst to drive a HER current density of − 10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of only 97 mV. According to the above investigation, amorphous electrocatalysts have significant advantages in water splitting, and amorphous transition metal phosphides may help to realize a highly efficient HER activity. The present work employed a one-step electrodeposition method with simultaneous electrodeposition and phosphation to fabricate amorphous NiCoP/CC catalysts for HER in KOH solution. The amorphous NiCoP nanoparticles were directly deposited on the conductive carbon cloth at room temperature. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the one-step deposition of amorphous NiCoP catalyst on the carbon cloth for HER in an alkaline solution. For comparison, NiP/CC, CoP/CC and NiCo/CC were also synthesized by this method. The prepared samples were characterized by physical and electrochemical techniques. The results showed that NiCoP/CC exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and good long-term stability toward HER in alkaline solution. The merits of the one-step electrodeposition method are as follows: (i) The deposition procedure is simple and without further heat treatments. (ii) The catalysts loaded on carbon cloth can be used directly as the cathode electrode. (iii) The integrated electrode formed by the electrodeposition method has excellent adhesion to the substrate, and it provides high stability of the electrode. The present work is expected to provide a simple strategy for integrated catalyst electrodes based on the preparation of transition phosphides for water splitting in alkaline solutions."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of NiCoP/CC,"2.1 Synthesis of NiCoP/CC NiCoP/CC catalyst was synthesized by the one-step electrodeposition at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1. First, the conductive carbon cloth (Shanghai Jingchong electronic technology development Co., Ltd.) was pretreated. It was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in 1.0 M KOH (Sinopharm chemical reagent Co., Ltd.) solution for 30 min, and then, it was cleaned with absolute ethyl alcohol (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) and deionized water (DW) by 3–5 times. Finally, the carbon cloth described above was dried in an oven under vacuum. In a typical preparation process, 2 mmol NiCl2·6H2O (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.), 2 mmol CoCl2·6H2O (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.), 5 mmol NH4Cl (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) and 5 mmol NaH2PO2 (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in 50 mL DW to form the electrodeposition solution. A three-electrode system was used for electrodeposition. Carbon cloth, platinum sheet and saturated calomel electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The appropriate potential and deposition time were chosen to control the loading quantity of the nanoparticles on the surface of carbon fiber. The deposition potential and deposition time in the present work were − 1.0 V and 100 s, respectively. All catalysts were prepared under the same applied potential and deposition time and followed by the same cleaning and drying process. The samples were alternately cleaned several times with DW and anhydrous ethanol and then dried for 6 h at 80 ℃ in the vacuum drying oven to obtain the catalysts. As a comparison, NiP/CC, CoP/CC and NiCo/CC were obtained by the synthesis process described above without adding CoCl2.6 H2O, NiCl2.6 H2O and NaH2PO2, respectively. All of the chemicals utilized in the present work were available in analytically pure grades and firsthand employed without any further purification. In the present work, the electrodeposition of NiCoP and phosphating reactions were simultaneously carried out on the surface of the conductive carbon cloth during the synthesis process, which is different from the method that metal precursor and then phosphation."
3,Physical characterization,"2.2 Physical characterization The micro-morphology and element composition distribution was determined by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) with a Thermo Scientific™ Quattro S instrument. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a MSAL-XD2 X-ray diffractometer with Al Kα radiation source (λ = 1.50 A). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were performed on a Thermo Scientific™ K-AlphaTM+ spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at 100 W. Prior to the experimental peaks fitting with XPSPEAK software, binding energies of all peaks were adjusted to the binding energy of the C1s peak at 284.8 eV attributed to adventitious hydrocarbons [33]."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature via an electrochemical workstation (Bio-Logic VMP3, France) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution with a standard three-electrode system. As-prepared NiCoP/CC, NiCo/CC, CoP/CC and NiP/CC were used as the working electrode, the platinum electrode and Hg/HgO electrode worked as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. For comparison, the potentials of all measurements were uniformly converted to reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE) via equation (ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.0591 × pH + 0.098). Prior to the HER performance tests, the as-electrodeposited samples were activated by 5000 cyclic voltammogram (CV) scans from − 0.4 to 0 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve was obtained at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 with 90% iR compensation. The Tafel slope was calculated by fitting the overpotential-current density curve. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at − 0.1 V (vs. RHE) with an amplitude of 5 mV. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was determined with a cyclic voltammogram (CV) method in the potential range of 0.1–0.2 V (vs. RHE) with different scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1). The catalyst stability was measured by the chronoamperometry (CP) at the potential correspondent to a current density of − 10 mA cm−2. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was also adopted to determine the catalyst durability."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Structure, morphology and composition of as-prepared catalysts","3.1 Structure, morphology and composition of as-prepared catalysts The surface morphology of the as-prepared catalysts is displayed in Fig. 2(a–d). It is evident that the catalysts grew directly on the surface of carbon fiber. For NiP/CC, the growth of smooth even-sized NiP nanoparticles on the carbon fiber surface was observed (Fig. 2a). The particle diameter was about 600 nm. As for CoP/CC, a non-uniform membrane structure is found on the surface of carbon fiber (Fig. 2b). NiCo/CC formed flower-like nanoparticles 2–3 µm in diameter (Fig. 2c), and a complete NiCo/CC flower-like nanoparticle structure was formed by the agglomeration of many nanosheets with tens of nanometer thick. The microstructure of NiCoP/CC is shown in Fig. 2d, and a granular structure grown uniformly on the carbon surface was observed. With the higher magnification (Fig. 2e), a large number of irregular and continuous nanowires were found on the NiCoP surface, forming composite nanostructures. In terms of particle diameter, the NiCoP nanoparticles were uniformly distributed between 500 and 600 nm. The composite structure made the surface of nanoparticles rough. What calls for special attention is that the composite nanoparticle with a rough surface is conducive to increasing the contact between electrolyte and electrode and providing more reactive active sites. Fig. 2f shows the elemental distributions of Ni, Co and P in the NiCoP/CC composite. The Ni, Co and P elements are given with yellow, red and green color in the elemental mapping images, respectively. It can be seen that Ni, Co and P distributed over the whole area tested, confirming the deposition of homogeneous bimetallic phosphide composites over the CC substrate. The XRD characterization was conducted to study the crystalline phase composition of the as-prepared catalysts. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of NiCoP/CC, NiP/CC, CoP/CC, NiCo/CC and CC. The patterns shown in Fig. 3 exhibited only two broad diffraction peaks at 24.2° and 44.3°. The broad diffraction peaks observed were attributed to amorphous carbon. Clear absence of other diffraction peaks further confirmed that the NiCoP deposited on CC was amorphous in nature [34]. The XPS experiments were carried out to gain valuable information about chemical compositions and the elemental valence states. The Ni, Co and P signals were detected in the XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 3(b–d), further confirming that the bimetallic phosphide was successfully obtained. To clarify the influence of the addition of P on the metal valence state, we compared the peak values of NiCoP/CC and NiCo/CC after fitting. The Ni 2p doublets in NiCoP/CC and NiCo/CC are shown in Fig. 3(b), which can be reasonably decomposed into seven peaks [35]. For NiCoP/CC, the binding energy of 852.8 eV was corresponding to the metal Ni [36]. The peaks at 875.21 and 857.04 eV arose from Ni3+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, and the binding energies at 873.50 and 855.73 eV corresponded to Ni2+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively [37]. The other two peaks at 880.0 and 861.60 eV were agree with satellite peaks characteristics of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 components, respectively. For the unphosphated NiCo/CC samples, the binding energies of Ni were shifted evidently and the proportion of Ni2+ and Ni3+ was changed. For the Co 2p region of NiCoP/CC (Fig. 3c), four characteristic peaks were fitted. Likewise, the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 peaks were centered at 797.11 and 781.35 eV, accompanied by two shake-up satellite peaks (786.14 and 803.46 eV) [38]. Interestingly, the binding energies of Co also shifted after phosphating. Accordingly, the valence states of Co and Ni in the as-electrodeposited NiCoP/CC were Co2+, Ni, Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively. Ni2+ and Co2+ can promote water splitting by weakening the OH bond [39]. The positive movement of the binding energy of Ni and Co and the obvious change of the proportion of Ni2+ and Ni3+ further confirm that the electron density shift from Ni and Co to P. The result of charge transfer was that Ni and Co were positively charged, while P was negatively charged in NiCoP/CC [40]. The charge transfer among Ni, Co and P is beneficial to reduce internal resistance and enhance electron transport, which is conducive to increase the reaction rate and reduce the reaction overpotential for HER. As well, the P 2p peak at 129.6 eV (Fig. 3d), which was less than 130.0 eV, could be allocated to the Pδ- in metal phosphides. It suggests that the P atoms were partially negatively charged and the metal phosphides were formed [41,42]. The peak with the binding energies of 133.20 eV (Fig. 3d) was attributed to the P-O due to the presence of oxidation in air [43–46]. The electronegative P atom can promote the metal-hydrogen adsorption process and enhance the catalytic activity of HER by changing the electronic structure of the metal and increasing the number of H adsorption sites."
7,Electrocatalytic activity for HER,"3.2 Electrocatalytic activity for HER Before the electrochemical tests for HER, the catalysts were activated by 5000 CV scans with a scanning potential range of − 0.4 to 0 V (vs. RHE). The polarization curves for HER of the prepared electrodes are displayed in Fig. 4(a). We can see that the commercial Pt/C/CC (40 wt%, loading 1.6 mg cm−2) reveals an onset overpotential at 9 mV and an overpotential of 46 mV for a current density of − 10 mA cm−2. The onset overpotential of the NiCoP/CC was 12 mV and an overpotential of 74 mV with a current density of − 10 mA cm−2 for HER. As a contrast, The overpotentials of CoP/CC, NiP/CC and NiCo/CC with the current density of − 10 mA cm−2 were 269 mV, 233 mV and 230 mV respectively, while the bare CC did not show significant catalytic activity for HER. It can be seen that the bimetallic phosphide NiCoP/CC exhibited a high catalytic activity. Notably, the electrocatalytic activity of NiCoP/CC was higher than those of reported NiCo bimetal phosphides at the same current density of − 10 mA cm−2 for HER, such as nanobrush structure NiCoP on Ni foam [47] (156 mV), hierarchical NiCoP nanocone arrays supported on Ni foam [48] (104 mV), the hierarchical flower-like NiCoP microsphere [49] (238 mV), and hierarchical yolk–shell spheres NiCoP on carbon paper [50] (266 mV). The phosphorus atoms of the amorphous nanoparticle NiCoP can produce more unsaturated sites on the amorphous catalyst surface. The unsaturated sites can promote the intermediate product adsorption process on the catalyst surface, thus boosting the catalyst activity of HER. Besides, the synergistic effect between the bimetals also promotes the catalytic performance of the catalyst for HER [51]. These advantages make it easier for the gas to be released in the catalytic process so as to facilitate the electrocatalytic reaction. The Tafel slope is a key parameter to estimate the reaction kinetics. To examine the response kinetics of the electrocatalysts, Tafel plots of catalysts were acquired by fitting the linear regions of polarization curves following the Tafel equation[52]. The fitting value of NiCoP/CC is exhibited in Fig. 4(b), and the Tafel slope is approximated as 89.5 mV dec−1. It can be seen that the Tafel slope of NiCoP/CC (89.5 mV dec−1) was considerably lower than those of NiCo/CC (112.1 mV dec−1), NiP/CC (111.7 mV dec−1) and CoP/CC (125.6 mV dec−1). The lower Tafel slope proves that the bimetallic phosphide has the outstanding intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution compared with single metal phosphide catalyst and unphosphated catalyst. It means that a higher current density can be obtained at a lower overpotential for the NiCoP/CC catalyst. The charge transfer resistance（Rct）plays an essential role in evaluating surface reaction kinetics [53]. To further clarify the difference in HER processes among catalysts, EIS measurements were carried out at − 0.1 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The Nyquist plots were fitted according to the equivalent circuit model, where Rs represents the internal resistance of the electrochemical system, and Rct, CPE represent the charge transfer resistance and the constant phase element, respectively. The semicircle arc is related to Rct, which reflects the kinetic information of the electron transfer process [54]. The reaction kinetics can be improved by a significant improvement in electrical conductivity. Fig. 4(c) shows that in the Nyquist plots and fitting curve of NiCoP/CC, the value of charge transfer resistance was 16.5 Ω. It can be seen that the charge transfer resistance of NiCoP/CC was much lower than that of NiCo/CC (72.8 Ω), NiP/CC (123.7 Ω) and CoP/CC (209.7 Ω). It indicates that NiCoP/CC has a faster electron transfer rate and a higher efficiency in alkaline solution. That can be ascribed to the accelerated charge transfer and the reduction of internal resistance caused by the formation of positively charged Niδ+/Coδ+ and negatively charged Pδ- active sites [55]. The electron transfer between Ni/Co and P in phosphide after phosphating efficiently promotes the formation of positively charged Niδ+/Coδ+ and negatively charged Pδ-. The turnover frequency (TOF) refers to the number of catalytic reactions per unit time per active site. Consequently, the amount of TOF decides the intrinsic activity level of the catalyst [56]. TOF was calculated on the basis of relation TOF = J × A/(2 × F × n), where J is the current density at a constant overpotential of 300 mV (vs. RHE), A is the electrode area, 2 indicates the number of electrons consumed for evolving one H2 from water, F is the Faraday constant and n is the number of moles of active components. Since the actual active sites of the catalyst could not be determined accurately, all atoms of Ni, Co and P were considered to be active sites during calculation. The TOF values obtained by the above calculation method can reflect the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst to a certain extent. As a result, the TOF value of NiCoP/CC was 0.03035 s−1 at η = 300 mV (Fig. 4d). Remarkably, the TOF value of NiCoP/CC was much higher than those of NiP/CC (0.00467 s−1), CoP/CC (0.00256 s−1), and NiCo/CC (0.00801 s−1), indicating the superior intrinsic HER activity of NiCoP/CC. A large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can afford a high catalytic performance[57]. Because of the linear relationship between Cdl and ECSA, the ECSA was evaluated by the following equation: ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs is a constant value of 0.040 mF cm−2 under alkaline conditions [58]. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance values of all catalyst samples were obtained from the CV curves with a potential range of 0.1–0.2 V (vs. RHE) without Faraday processes at different scan rates. Derived from the CVs vs the scan rate, the Cdl value was calculated from the linear plots in Fig. 4e. The NiCoP/CC sample shows a much higher Cdl value of 39.01 mF cm−2, which was 6.53, 5.26, 2.72 times of NiP/CC (5.97 mF cm−2), NiCo/CC (7.42 mF cm−2) and CoP/CC (14.33 mF cm−2), respectively. Fig. 4f shows the ECSA of NiCoP (1219.06 cm2 mg−1), CoP/CC (447.81 cm2 mg−1), NiCo/CC (231.88 cm2 mg−1) and NiP/CC (186.56 cm2 mg−1). Naturally, NiCoP/CC possessed a larger electrochemical surface areas. It reveals that NiCoP/CC could expose more active sites, contributing to the higher electrocatalytic activity of NiCoP/CC electrocatalyst. In addition, it could be observed in Fig. 4f that the ECSA value of CoP/CC (447.81 cm2 mg−1) was greater than that of NiCo/CC (231.88 cm2 mg−1). It means that a larger number of active sites were revealed on the surface of CoP/CC catalyst. However, we can observe from the polarization curves (Fig. 4a) that the HER catalytic performance of CoP/CC was worse than that of NiCo/CC. It further proved that the synergistic effect between Ni/Co bimetals could improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Stability of NiCoP/CC was assessed by the comparison of the polarization curves before and after the CV cycles and the change of current density at a constant potential. In detail, the CV of NiCoP/CC was determined in 1.0 M KOH solution for 2000 cycles. As seen in Fig. 5(a), NiCoP/CC exhibited a slight change of current density of HER after 2000 cycles. In addition, NiCoP/CC was investigated by the chronoamperometry test, and the result is displayed in Fig. 5(b). The decay of current density of NiCoP/CC was just 0.2 mA cm−2 after the hydrogen evolution for 24 h at − 10 mA cm−2. It indicates that NiCoP/CC had a good robustness for HER in alkaline solution. Furthermore, the XRD and SEM of the samples before/after the stability test were compared. The XRD spectra of NiCoP/CC (Fig. 5c) demonstrates no additional phase formation after 24 h stability test, and NiCoP/CC remained the amorphous structure that indicates phase stability of studied electrode. The SEM image of NiCoP/CC (Fig. 5d) after the HER durability test exhibits that NiCoP nanoparticles maintained well except for a little aggregation. Therefore, the above results confirmed that the morphology and structure of the NiCoP/CC catalyst remain well after the stability test. Finally, the catalytic mechanism of NiCoP/CC was analyzed, according to the three-steps mechanism of HER in alkaline medium: (i) Volmer reaction (adsorption reaction) H2O + e- → Hads + OH-, Tafel slope = 120 mV dec−1. (ii) Heyrovsky reaction (electrochemical desorption reaction) Hads + H2O + e- → H2 + OH- Tafel slope = 40 mV dec−1. (iii) Tafel reaction (chemical desorption reaction) Hads + Hads → H2 Tafel slope = 30 mV dec−1. The H atoms adsorbed at the catalyst active site form the intermediate product Hads. The Tafel slope of NiCoP/CC in alkaline solution is 89.5 mV dec−1, which is between 40 and 120 mV dec−1. On one hand, the Tafel slope of NiCoP/CC dismatches with one of the three steps described above. It means that there is no obvious rate-determining step. It signifies the complexity of the HER mechanism on amorphous catalysts. On the other hand, according to Ref. [59], it can be considered that the HER process of NiCoP/CC in alkaline medium is governed by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Fig. 6 shows a schematic of NiCoP/CC catalysts for HER in alkaline solution. Initially, because of the surface adsorption of NiCoP/CC, water molecules combine with the surface active sites to form Metal-H and P-H bonding. Then, the intermediates Hads combine with water molecules to form hydrogen molecules. During the process of catalytic reaction, the charge transfer between the metal and P atom is beneficial to promote the electrocatalytic reaction. Spontaneously, the electrocatalytic activity of NiCoP/CC for HER is increased. On the basis of the structure characterizations and electrochemical tests, the prepared NiCoP/CC has a remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability, and the reason can be summarized as below: First, the charge transfer between the Ni/Co metal and phosphorus atoms is beneficial to speed electron transport, and it renders enhancing ionic conducive and reduces internal resistance. It ultimately leads to an increase in the rate of the reaction and a decrease in the potential required for the reaction. Second, the surface- covered irregular and continuous nanowires make the surface of the NiCoP/CC catalyst rough. Therefore, a larger electrochemical active surface area of NiCoP/CC appears for HER, which is conducive to increasing the contact between electrolyte and material and providing more reactive active sites. Third, the NiCoP particles grown directly on the conductive carbon cloth not only reduce the interfacial contact resistance but also promote electron transfer at the interface. Finally, the synergistic effect of Ni and Co increases the electrochemically active sites and enhances the catalytic activity."
8,Conclusions,"In this work, NiCoP/CC was successfully synthesized via a one-step method with simultaneous electrodeposition and phosphation. The one-step method has advantages of adjustable components, simple steps, and environmental friendliness. Based on the physical characterization and HER electrochemical properties, the NiCoP/CC nanoparticles show a rough surface in situ directly grown on the conductive carbon cloth substrate and an amorphous structure. The overpotential of NiCoP/CC catalyst for HER only is 149 mV for a current density of − 50 mA cm−2. The mechanism of HER process of NiCoP/CC in alkaline medium is considered as Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Besides, the NiCoP/CC catalyst shows a good stability in alkaline solution, and the morphology and structure of the NiCoP/CC catalyst remain well after 24 h operation. This work offers a very simplified approach for the fabrication of amorphous phosphide electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline solution with potential application in the future."
