0,Introduction,"The development of methodologies to reduce CO2 emissions needs to be a priority in the political agenda worldwide for two main reasons. First, because these methodologies may be used to produce alternative energy sources and value-added chemicals. Second, because they may mitigate the negative effects of global warming by reducing the rising levels of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The idea that CO2 can be captured [1–3] and reconverted [4–6] to useful chemicals sounds like a perfect solution that could potentially be a step forward in the transition to a low-carbon economy [7]. However, and due to the thermodynamic stability and relative kinetic inertness of CO2, a preliminary activation is required. This can be done by different approaches, including thermochemical, biochemical, photochemical and electrochemical methods [8,9]. In particular, the CO2 electroreduction reaction has attracted increasing research interests, owing to its simple procedure and moderate reaction conditions. Besides, the energy required in the activation of CO2 might be supplied from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, providing viable solutions to the development of carbon-neutral fuels. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 at metallic electrodes at different operating conditions and system configurations has been the subject of a vast number of studies recently, producing a broad range of products. This includes for example the synthesis of carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid (HCOOH) with 2 e− exchanged, alcohols such as methanol (CH3OH) with 6 e− and more complicated reactions including an increasing number of electrons involved, such as the production of methane (CH4) or ethanol (C2H5OH), with 8 e− and 12 e− involved, respectively [10–14]. The selectivity of CO2 electrochemical conversion is, however, low, which is reflected by a resulting mixture of carbon compounds, together with H2 from the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After an intense research on CO2 electrochemical conversion, copper (Cu) seems to be the only known material capable of breaking the CO bond in CO2 and further converting CO to more reduced species such as hydrocarbons and alcohols at moderates reaction rates over sustainable periods of time [15–18]. Unfortunately, Cu alone is not as efficient as needed for real applications (i.e. large overpotentials and low selectivities) [18] and so, the development of cost-effective electrocatalysts with low overpotentials, high reaction kinetics and product selectivities, as well as appropriate stability, is of paramount importance in order to make CO2 recycling of technical interest. This leads to consider novel catalyst materials and structures that may potentially make the electroreduction of CO2 technically and economically viable in the future. Most electrodes used in the electroreduction of CO2 are in the form of metal plates, metal granules or electrodeposited metals on a substrate [16], but previous literature also proved that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) may be suitable for electrochemical applications because of their versatile chemical composition, tunable electronic properties and highly porous structure where mass transport limitations can be relieved [19]. CO2 can also be effectively trapped and separated at MOFs structures [20], which may increase CO2 concentration at the electrode surface and be beneficial to enhance CO2 conversion rates and inhibit the competitive HER [21]. The electroreduction of CO2 at MOF-based materials has been the subject of research in recent literature [e.g. [21–35]]. Table S1 (Supplementary information) shows the performance of MOF-based systems for the electroreduction of CO2 reported only during last year (2018), which denotes the interest on the topic. In particular, our previous report on the use of Cu-based metal-organic porous materials (i.e. HKUST-1, CuAdeAce, CuDTA and CuZnDTA) [32] demonstrated the possibility of a selective CO2 conversion to CH3OH and C2H5OH at modest rates and efficiencies, in contrast to previous reports on the topic that mainly focus on CO production. Precisely, HKUST-1-based materials were able to achieve reaction rates as high as r=18.6 μmol·m−2·s-1 and cumulative faradaic efficiencies of 15.9% at a current density of j=10 mA·cm−2. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials was correlated with the structural features of the electrodes (i.e. high surface area, accessibilities and exposure of Cu catalytic centers). One striking feature of the systems is the pseudo-stable behavior after 6 h of experimental time, which was an unprecedented stability for MOFs-based electrocatalysts in aqueous media. In any case, the rates and faradaic efficiencies for alcohols production are still limited and so the investigation of CO2 electroreduction at MOF-based electrodes remains a challenge. In this sense, bimetallic electrocatalysts have demonstrated to tune the selectivity towards one specific product with FEs higher than 90% in some cases [36]. The appealing aspect of these mixed-metal systems is that the electronic and geometric structure around the active sites can be tuned to modulate the relative binding energy of different reaction intermediates in the electrocatalytic surface and alter the local atomic arrangement at the active sites. Compared with single metal catalysts, bimetallic surfaces may also reduce the energy differences between CO2 and intermediates, eventually offering low overpotential for corresponding reactions and a controlled selectivity [21,37–40]. Moreover, these mixed-metal systems could become a good approach to replace the edge atoms of single metal preferentially absorbing H2 with another metal atoms which absorb CO2, and thus suppress the competitive HER [41,42]. Overall, the use of Cu-based bimetallic systems may be a potential way to enhance the performance of current CO2 electroreduction systems for the production of alcohols. The literature, however, show that even a tiny fraction of a secondary metal can totally poison the CO2 conversion ability of Cu [43,44]. This makes the exploration of mixed-metal systems for alcohols evolution a challenging task, although some successful cases has been recently published for Cu-Zn, Cu-Pd, Cu-Ag or Cu-Au-based electrocatalysts in the production of C2H5OH [30,45–48]. Thus, with the present study we sought to evaluate the use of a bimetallic material consisting of Cu(II) and Bi(III) metal-organic framework blends as electrocatalyst for the continuous conversion of CO2. Precisely, we select a Cu-based MOF (HKUST-1), due to its catalytic activity for the CO2-to-alcohols reaction [29,32,34,49]. Our approach aims to invigorate this material by blending it with a bismuth (Bi)-based MOF (CAU-17). Bi has received recent attention as electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction due to its low cost and toxicity, as well as selectivity for the CO2-to-HCOOH reaction [50–59]. Bi may also potentially enhance the binding of intermediate species (i.e. COOH* and OCHO*) in the further conversion of CO2 and reduce the competitive HER due to its positive free energy of hydrogen adsorption [51,52,56,60]. Furthermore, to enhance the mass transport across the gas-solid-liquid interface [61,62], we envisage to support the bimetallic materials onto a porous carbon paper to form gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). Therefore, the principal objectives of the analysis are: (1) to synthesize and characterize the relevant properties of HKUST-1, CAU-17 and HKUST-1/CAU-17 blends, (2) to prepare GDEs with the CuBi-based materials at different metal ratios, (3) to evaluate the performance of a filter-press electrochemical cell for the continuous electroreduction of CO2 at the prepared MOF-based working electrodes and finally, (4) to test the stability of the electrodes at longer experimental times. The research efforts carried out in this work are a step forward into the development of innovative electrocatalysts for the CO2-to-alcohols reaction, paving also the way to develop efficient MOF-based CO2 valorization processes in continuous operation."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation and characterization of HKUST-1/CAU-17 blends,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of HKUST-1/CAU-17 blends HKUST-1 samples were prepared following a previously described solvent-less synthetic procedure [63]. The synthesis proceeded as follows: 3 mmol (0.605 g) of Cu(OAc)2·H2O (OAc: acetate) and 2 mmol (0.442 g) of trimesic acid (H3BTC: benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxilic acid, 0.40 mmol) were hand-grinded thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous mixture, which was sealed in a 2-mL glass ampule and subsequently heated at 120 °C during 48 h using 2 °C/min heating ramp. The product was washed with methanol to remove unreacted reagents. Bi-based MOF, named as CAU-17, was prepared following the synthetic procedure described elsewhere [64]. Basically, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1.03 mmol) and H3BTC (1.17 mmol) were added to a 70 m L-teflon reactor along with 20 mL of CH3OH, and heated to 120 °C in a microwave oven during 20 min. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried at room temperature. MOF samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Phillips X'PERT diffractometer (equipped with Cu-Kα radiation, λ=1.5418 Å) over the range 5 < 2θ < 70° with a step size of 0.02° at 293 K. The permanent porosity was studied by measuring N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-MP analyzer. Microstructural features of MOFs and their dispersion were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7000 F microscope operated at 10–20 kV. Specimens were mounted on conductive carbon adhesive tabs and imaged after chromium sputter coating of 5 nm to make them conductive. Table 1 shows the nomenclature for HKUST-1/CAU-17 blends, together with the corresponding MOF mass and Cu:Bi atomic ratios determined by X-ray fluorescence using a XDRL Fischerscope X-ray system at 50 KeV of power, under a nickel filter and with a 0.1 dm collimator. It is important to note that all the synthetic efforts to dope HKUST-1(Cu) with Bi(III) or CAU-17(Bi) with Cu(II) in a single crystalline phase were unsuccessful. Precisely, doping of HKUST-1(Cu) with Bi(III) resulted in a segregation of crystalline phases yielding HKUST-1(Cu) and a series of diffraction peaks ascribed to an unknown phase of Bi(III). In the case of CAU-17(Bi), the synthesis yielded the homometallic CAU-17(Bi) while Cu(II) remained in solution."
3,Preparation of MOF based-GDEs,"2.2 Preparation of MOF based-GDEs The procedure to prepare the GDEs (A = 10 cm2) has been described in detail in our previous work [32]. The catalytic ink was airbrushed onto a TGP-H-60 (Toray Inc.) porous carbon with an optimum catalyst loading of 1 mg·cm−2 [65]. The catalytic ink is formed by a mixture of the synthesized CuBi MOF-based materials at different metal loadings, Nafion® dispersion 5 wt.% (Alfa Aesar) as binder and isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich) as vehicle, with a 70:30 catalyst/Nafion mass ratio and a 3% solids (catalyst + Nafion) percentage. The mixture is sonicated for at least 30 min to obtain a homogeneous slurry that is subsequently airbrushed on the surface of the porous substrate. The carbon substrate minimizes the transport resistance, contributing to an efficient transfer of CO2 and diffusion of the alcohols [61]. The resulting electrode materials were dried at 100 °C on a heating plate to ensure solvent evaporation and then rinsed with deionized water."
4,Electrochemical experiments,"2.3 Electrochemical experiments A MSTAT4 (Arbin Instruments) potentiostat was used to evaluate the voltage-current curves by employing a conventional three electrode electrochemical cell. The cyclic voltammetries are obtained with a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1 at potentials ranging from 0 to −2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.63 to -1.37 V vs. RHE) in a 0.5 M KHCO3 (Panreac) aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrolyte was pre-saturated with CO2 or deaerated with N2 by bubbling the gas for 30 min. Portions of the bimetallic-GDEs were used as working electrodes, while a glassy carbon and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. Current densities were normalized to the apparent surface area, A, of the electrode. The continuous electrochemical measurements for CO2 reduction at the CuBi materials were carried out in a filter-press electrochemical cell (Micro Flow Cell, ElectroCell A/S) at ambient conditions as described before [61]. A cation exchange membrane (Nafion® 117) separated the cathode and anode compartments of the cell. The CuBi-GDEs were employed as working electrodes. A platinised titanium electrode was used as a counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl), assembled close to the cathode, as reference electrode. All potentials were measured with a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode and converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. The filter-press electrochemical system possesses three inputs (catholyte, anolyte and CO2 separately) and two outputs (catholyte-CO2 and anolyte). The cathode side of the reactor was fed with CO2 gas (99.99%) with a flow/area ratio of Qg/A =10 ml∙min−1 cm-2, adjusted by a rotameter. A 0.5 M KHCO3 (Panreac, > 97% purity) aqueous solution was used as both, catholyte and anolyte solutions. Prior to the experiments, the aqueous electrolyte was saturated with CO2 by bubbling for 30 min. The electrolytes were pumped from catholyte and anolyte tanks to the cell by two peristaltic pumps (Watson Marlow 320, Watson Marlow Pumps Group) at a flow rate of Qe/A =2 ml∙min−1 cm-2. The experiments were performed at galvanostatic conditions (j = 20 mA·cm-2) and then, at a current density ranging from j=10 mA·cm-2 to j=30 mA·cm-2, using an AutoLab PGSTAT 302 N potentiostat (Metrohm, Autolab B.V.). Liquid and gas samples were taken every 15 min for 90 min, where stable conditions are expected [32]. The concentration of alcohols in each sample was analyzed by duplicate in a headspace gas chromatograph (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra Shimadzu) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and formate (HCOO-) concentration was analyzed in duplicate by Ion Chromatography (Dionex ICS 1100). Moreover, gas-phase reduction products were analyzed in line with a microGC 3000 (Inficon) equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). An average concentration for liquid and gas samples was obtained for each point from the performance of three replicates. The maximum standard deviations for the replicates were lower than 18.9%. The performance of the mixed-metal systems for the CO2-to-alcohols reaction is evaluated in terms of reaction rate, r, defined as the product obtained per unit of cathode area and time (in μmol·m−2·s-1), selectivity, S, defined as the ratio between the reaction rate for a specific product and the cumulative reaction rates for all liquid phase products, and the faradaic efficiency, FE, which represents the efficiency at which electrons are transferred to form each product, according to the following equation: (1) F E ( % ) = z · n · F q · 100 where z is the theoretical number of e− exchanged to form the desired product, n is the number of moles produced, F is the Faraday constant (F = 96,485 C·mol-1) and q is the total charge applied in the process."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical and electrochemical characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical and electrochemical characterization Prior to preparing the GDEs, as-prepared MOF samples were analyzed by PXRD and N2 adsorption isotherms to assess their crystallinity and microporous features. PXRD patterns fit those expected for HKUST-1 and CAU-17, while fitting of adsorption data to BET equation yielded surface area values of 1559 m2 g–1 and 1197 m2 g–1, respectively, as expected from their crystalline and microporous nature (please see Supplementary information). MOF modified GDEs were also analyzed with SEM to determine their microstructural features. In this regard, as representative case, Fig. 1 shows comparative micrographs for the CuBi12 GDE using secondary electron (SEI) and backscattered electron (BSE) scanning modes. As observed, MOF blends consist of well dispersed crystallites phases in which CAU-17 micro-metric crystals with hexagonal prism geometry appear embedded in a matrix of sub-micrometric crystals of HKUST-1. Note that in the backscattered electron image the brighter crystals corresponds to more electrodense Bi containing CAU-17, while the remaining darker crystallites are attributable to HKUST-1. Fig. 2 a gathers the voltage-current responses for the Cu100, CuBi12 and Bi100-based GDEs after 5 scans in a CO2-saturated (0.5 M KHCO3) aqueous solution, while Fig. 2b reports the current-voltage curve for CuBi12 in the presence/absence of CO2. An oxidation-reduction contribution is observed between -0.2 V to 0.2 V vs. RHE, which seems to depend on Bi content. This could be initially related to the oxidation-reduction of the material with the potential scans, as found before for Bi-based electrocatalysts [52,59]. However, since the oxidative peak appears also in the reverse scan of Cu100 sample and it remains after the fifth scan, it can be also related to the formation of oxidized subproducts in the CO2 reduction reaction. In any case, the main characteristic of the voltammograms is a reduction process starting at around -0.25 V vs. RHE, which can be initially associated with the reduction of CO2, the formation of H2 from HER and the partial formation/decomposition of oxides at the electrode surface. A similar curve with a slight shoulder at around -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl (-0.27 V vs. RHE) in a CO2-saturated KHCO3 aqueous solution was reported by Hori and co-workers. They suggested that the reduction peak can be attributed to the adsorbed intermediates during the CO2 reduction reaction [66]. As can be also observed, the reduction wave is more pronounced for Bi-based samples, which might be initially assigned to an enhanced reduction of CO2 to HCOOH commonly found at Bi-based surfaces [50–59]. Besides, mixing the Cu-based material with only 12% of Bi (CuBi12) results in a notable activity close to Bi100 response, which may be indicative of CO2 conversion by different reaction mechanisms than those at Cu100-based surfaces, denoting the synergic co-catalytic effect of Cu and Bi. As a rule, the higher current densities achieved at same voltage level required in the Cu-Bi co-catalyst systems should be consistent with the faster kinetics to produce reduced species from CO2, although the HER competitive reaction should be also taken into account. Thus, the curve in the N2 bubbled solution can be explained by the formation of H2 from HER, while both reactions (i.e. CO2 reduction and HER) occurs in parallel in the CO2 saturated system. Fig. 2b shows a significant increase in the cathodic current wave in the presence of CO2, in comparison to that response in a N2-saturated solution. This demonstrates that the material acts as a catalyst for CO2 reduction and the response observed has more to do with CO2 transformation rather than the oxidation-reduction of the catalytic material. For a further comparison of the electrochemical activity for alcohols production, the semi-log Tafel relationship between partial current density for CH3OH and C2H5OH and overpotential, ɳ, in the kinetically controlled region is shown in Fig. 3 for Cu100 and CuBi12 systems. No alcohols were detected with Bi100 material. The Tafel slopes at the CuBi12-based GDE are 98.5 mV dec−1 and 82.3 mV dec−1 for CH3OH and C2H5OH, respectively, which is about 30% lower than those results for Cu100. This indicates a faster kinetic reaction, which may be ascribed to the synergic effect of Cu and Bi in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to alcohols. The higher activity found at CuBi-based system agrees well with the enhanced activity found for CO2 electroreduction at nano-sized Bi-based catalyst electrodeposited on a Cu foil [57]. Besides, it is commonly stated that the rate-limiting step in the electroreduction of CO2 at Cu-based materials involves a single electron transfer for the activation of CO2 (to form CO2-) which is characterized with a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec−1 [67]. CH3OH and C2H5OH exhibited a Tafel slope close to this value with Cu100 (138.1 mV dec-1 and 119.2 mV dec−1), implying that both products probably share the same rate-determining step which involves an initial one-electron transfer. The fact that the Tafel slopes are lower than 120 mV dec−1 at CuBi12 suggests the lower kinetic barrier for CO2 conversion to alcohols in contrast to the more sluggish reaction kinetics at Cu100, implying that the rate-determining step is probably a chemical step after a pre-equilibrium one-electron transfer."
7,Continuous CO2 electroreduction performance,"3.2 Continuous CO2 electroreduction performance Table 2 presents the reaction rates for liquid products (i.e. HCOOH, CH3OH and C2H5OH), together with the cumulative CO2 conversion rate to liquid products (rliq ) and selectivities, while Fig. 4 depicts the evolution of the FE values (%) for all detected liquid and gas-phase reduction products in the filter press electrochemical cell equipped with homometallic (Cu100 and Bi100) and bimetallic (CuBi6-84) MOF modified GDEs. FEs are calculated assuming that 2 e− are required per molecule of HCOOH, H2 and CO, 6 e- per molecule of CH3OH and 12 e- per molecule of C2H5OH and C2H4. Trace amounts of CH4 were also detected. The cumulative FE was over 90% for all the materials applied. Besides, control experiments for the reduction of CO2 conducted at the supporting neat carbon papers did not produce any measurable liquid product. As firstly observed, cumulative production rates for liquid products (rliq ) are enhanced as increasing Bi content in the bimetallic samples, going from riq = 183.3 μmol·m−2·s-1 to riq = 519.5 μmol·m−2·s-1 at CuBi6 and CuBi84-GDEs, respectively. The enhanced production rate is evident from comparison of the HCOOH obtained at CuBi84-based system (rHCOOH =495.6 μmol·m−2·s-1), which is approximately four times higher than rHCOOH =128.3 μmol·m−2·s-1 for CuBi6-based GDEs. This in agreement with the literature that demonstrated that Bi-based materials are able to promote the production of HCOO- (via OCHO*), which is spontaneously released from the catalytic surface as HCOOH [50–59]. The production of alcohols (i.e. rCH3OH and rC2H5OH ) is enhanced initially up to a Cu:Bi ratio of 88:12, after this point it decreases as the content of Bi increases since the reaction turns more selective to HCOOH production. It is important also to note that the rliq values achieved at CuBi84 are higher than those obtained for Bi100, which may confirm the synergic co-catalytic effect of Cu and Bi. The same conclusion can be drawn when comparing GDEs modified with homometallic Cu sample and those containing lowest amounts of Bi, as inclusion of the latter boosts the alcohol formation. For instance, the reaction rates for alcohol production in CuBi12 system are rCH3OH =29.7 μmol·m−2·s-1 and rC2H5OH =48.8 μmol·m−2·s-1, while the homometallic Cu sample yield more inconspicuous values (rCH3OH =8.7 μmol·m−2·s-1 and rC2H5OH =17.9 μmol·m−2·s-1). All in all, the reaction selectivity to alcohols seems to find an optimum at 12% Bi content (SCH3OH = 0.12 and SC2H5OH = 0.2, Salcohols = 0.32). The production of alcohols at HKUST-1-based electrodes can be also found in literature [29,32,34,49]. As an example, our recent report showed a cumulative FE to alcohols (i.e. CH3OH and C2H5OH) as high as 47.2% for Ru(III) doped HKUST-1-based electrodes at j = 20 mA·cm−2, although the activity of the material decays after 1 h of continuous reaction until it reaches similar performance to that of pristine HKUST-1 (FE alcohols∼ 15%) [29]. Besides, Zhao and coworkers recently synthesized different oxide derived Cu/C materials by a facile carbonization of HKUST-1. The electrocatalysts exhibited highly selective CO2 reduction to alcohols (i.e. CH3OH and C2H5OH) with a FEalcohols ranging from 45.2% to 71.2% at −0.1 to −0.7 V vs. RHE [34]. The production of alcohols, however, may be somehow unexpected attending at the formation of mainly HCOOH (FE = 91.3%) at nano-sized Bi-based catalyst electrodeposited on a Cu foil (non-MOF) at more negative potentials (-1.13 V vs. RHE) [57], which may also show the advantages of using MOF-based structures for the further electrochemical transformation of CO2 to alcohols. Moreover, the cathodic voltages are more positive in case of adding Bi to the sample than those results in its absence. This overpotential lowering follows the same trend observed from cyclic voltammetric analyses. For example, at an applied constant current of j = 20 mA·cm−2 (E= -0.21 V vs. RHE), an averaged ralcohols = 78.5 μmol·m−2·s-1 was observed with CuBi12. Significantly higher voltage (E= -0.59 V vs. RHE) was required under similar conditions and only a ralcohols = 26.6 μmol·m−2·s-1 was achieved at Cu-based systems. Thus, it can be discerned that CuBi MOF ensemble is a much more active electrocatalyst than homometallic Cu-systems for CO2 transformation to alcohols. In line with the results presented in Table 2, the data from Fig. 4 evidence that Bi has a marked effect on reaction selectivity. In particular, the results showed that a Bi content between 6 to 12% (CuBi6-12) seems to be beneficial for CO2 reduction to alcohols, reaching a maximum FE for alcohols at 12% Bi (FEalcohols = 36.9%, Salcohols = 0.32). Exceeding this Bi content range, the system led primarily to HCOOH in the liquid phase, which indicates that the amount of exposed Bi active sites in the GDE has a critical influence on alcohol production. Besides, the analysis of gas-phase reduction products at the CuBi GDEs showed the formation of mainly H2 (FE ∼30%) from the competitive HER, together with CO (FE from 10% to 3%) and small concentrations of C2H4, that seem to be negatively affected by the increase of Bi loading (from FE = 9.8% to FE = 2.8% for Cu100 and CuBi84, respectively). The literature demonstrated that the formation of C2H4 from CO2 electroreduction at Cu-based MOFs is not unexpected [68,69]. In particular, Nam and coworkers were able to reach FEs as high as 45% for C2H4 at HKUST-1 (calcined at 250 °C) spray-coated gas diffusion layers. The authors also reported a FE to C2H4 of around 10% for the as-prepared HKUST-1-based electrodes at -0.69 V vs. RHE [68]. Moreover, Fig. 4 shows that the formation of H2 and CO can be reduced at CuBi materials in comparison to those results at the homometallic MOFs. This has been explained before by a modulation of the electronic environment of Cu-Bi boundaries, resulting in an enhanced production of HCOOH via OCHO* intermediate that binds to the catalyst surface through an oxygen atom, hindering the formation of CO and partially suppressing the formation of H2 [51]. It is generally recognized that the formation of CH3OH from the electrochemical conversion of CO2 proceeds through two different reaction pathways, implying CO and HCOO− intermediates [5]. In case of C2H5OH, the first step involves a proton and electron transfer to give a HCOO- surface moiety that can dimerize/hydrogenate to C2H5OH and C2H4 [19,70–72]. This CC intermolecular coupling seems to be kinetically more favorable when the immediate reactants is CH2O*, rather than CO [73]. As the efficiency for HCOOH formation increases and CO decreases with Bi content, HCOO- may be acting as the main precursor for the formation of both alcohols at low Bi loadings. We therefore hypothesize that the enhanced production of alcohols at the CuBi MOF-based systems can be mainly ascribed to the formation of HCOO- at Bi sites (CAU-17), which is then transferred to neighboring Cu actives sites (HKUST-1) where further conversion toward alcohols takes place. The diffusion pathways provided by the MOF-based structure would lengthen the permanence time, prompting further reduction to CH3OH and CC coupling reaction to C2H5OH. The results might be also explained by a simultaneous interaction between Cu-Bi boundaries and HCOO- intermediate as found in literature for Cu-Bi materials [51], but considering the large micron-sized crystallites observed (see Section 3.1), it seems much less likely to be the main responsible for the significant increase in alcohols production. An in depth study on reaction mechanisms is certainly required in order to roundly assert the correlation among the reaction selectivity and the MOF-based electrodes. To get deeper insights, Fig. 5 gathers the influence of Bi loading and current density (j=10 mA·cm−2 to j=30 mA·cm−2) on FE values for alcohols. The figures show that product distribution and process efficiency are not uniquely correlated with Cu/Bi ratio but also with the current density applied to the system. At lower current densities, the reaction seems to be more selective for CO2 reduction to CH3OH over the CuBi electrocatalysts with a FE = 18.2% at j=10 mA·cm−2. As the current goes to j = 20 mA·cm−2, C2H5OH seems to become the dominant CO2 reduction alcohol (FE = 28.3%). Further increases in the applied current lead, in both cases, to a significant reduction in FE, which can be explained by an increased production of HCOOH and H2, as can be seen at Bi and CuBi-based electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion at more negative potentials [51–53]. Fig. 5a also demonstrated that the CuBi GDEs prepared present an optimum selectivity for CH3OH formation at j=10 mA·cm−2. The same can be said for C2H5OH formation, although its optimum is clearly at j = 20 mA·cm−2, which may indicate that its formation follows a distinct reaction pathway as current increases. It is also important to mention that the summation of reaction rates, ralcohols , and efficiencies FEalcohols (ralcohols = 78.5 μmol·m−2·s-1, FEalcohols = 36.9%) at CuBi12-based surfaces at 90 min of operation and j = 20 mA·cm−2 are remarkably higher that those values previously obtained in our group for the production of alcohols in the same experimental setup using a Cu plate (r=23 μmol·m−2·s-1, FE = 3.6%) [65] and Cu2O/ZnO (r=50.8 μmol·m−2·s-1, FE = 31.4%) particles deposited onto carbon papers in a 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous solution and E= -1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (-0.67 V vs. RHE) [61]. The results also enhanced the performance of the Cu-based MOFs materials tested before in our group (i.e. HKUST-1, CuAdeAce, CuDTA and CuZnDTA) for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to alcohols [32]. These values, however, are still far from the nearly 100% selectivity and FE of 77% to C2H5OH recently obtained at nitrogen (pyridinic and pyrrolic type)-based mesoporous carbons [74], which can be probably ascribed to the presence of Py-based co-catalysts able to act as electron shuttle and enhance reaction performance [12]."
8,Stability tests,"3.3 Stability tests Generally, the rapid deactivation of MOF-based electrodes (typically shorter than 2 h) is a major obstacle impeding their application in the CO2 electroreduction reactions. Accordingly, Fig. 6 a shows the time-dependence for the potential (E) and the cumulative FE for liquid products (FEliq ) achieved at CuBi12 in comparison with Cu100-GDEs at galvanostatic conditions (j = 20 mA·cm−2) and gas and electrolyte flow rates of Qg/A =10 mL·min-1 cm−2 and Qe/A =2 mL·min-1 cm−2, respectively. Besides, Fig. 6b shows FEliq with time in three consecutives runs (each lasting 1 h) for the same operation conditions. As observed, the activity of CuBi12 and Cu100 GDEs decays progressively first and then seems to stabilize after 90 min of operation. In general, the life of electrocatalytic materials may diminish due to the degradation produced by heterogeneity in the metal particle dispersion with time and poisoning or blocking of the active surface by intermediate species produced [65]. Our previous work also showed that the catalytic material can be gradually peeled off from the porous support [61], increasing the formation of H2 due to an easy access of water to catalytic sites [75]. The same can be observed in this work, since the efficiency to H2 obtained after 15 min and 90 min of experimental time was FE = 22% and FE = 30.2%, respectively, at CuBi12-based system. Besides, this reasoning agrees well with the trend observed in PXRD patterns and SEM micrographs (Fig. 7 ) taken on CuBi12-based fresh electrode and on electrodes subjected to 60 min and 300 min of operation at -0.37 V vs. RHE in the 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. According to PXRD patterns, both MOFs (HKUST-1 and CAU-17) retain the crystallinity. Nonetheless, the intensity of the diffraction peaks decay significantly from 0 (fresh electrode) to 60 min of operation, after which the decay seems to slow down up to 300 min. Such intensity decay in the diffraction peaks is in concordance with the leaching of catalytic material but it also fits the trend of the FEliq values in long-term runs (Fig. 6). The evolution of the homometallic electrodes was also evaluated (see Supplementary information). At the same time, the SEM images taken at 1000 magnification evidence a qualitative reduction of the catalytic loading taking place at the initial stage of the electrochemical process. Furthermore, the XRF analysis carried out on the CuBi12-GDEs before and after the electrochemical process show that Bi:Cu ratio increased slightly from an initial value of 88:12 (Cu:Bi) to a stable value of 85:15 for running times of 60 min and 300 min. This fact indicates that the material leaching is somewhat higher for the Cu-MOF (HKUST-1), probably due to its smaller particle size (see Section 3.1.). Fig. 6b shows how the cumulative FEliq remained after four successive runs of 60 min, indicating that only a slight observable deactivation occurred after testing the material repeatedly. Despite the overall efficiency loss along the cycles can be ascribed to the aforementioned material leaching, the relative increase at the initial stage of each cycle, suggest that the long term activity loss shown in Fig. 6a is also influenced by the poisoning or blocking of the catalytic sites, that is mitigated from one cycle to the other upon washing of the material. In any case, the relatively stable electrocatalytic activity of CuBi12 over time for liquid products, (FEliq ∼ 50%) and in particular the cumulative efficiency for alcohols, CH3OH and C2H5OH, (FEalcohols ∼ 30%) in spite of the observed deactivation with time (E evolution), makes the materials appealing when considering requirements for the CO2 electrochemical conversion that demands progressing beyond the current state of the art."
9,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated the benefits of using CuBi-based metal-organic frameworks (HKUST-1 and CAU-17) supported in gas diffusion electrodes to reach enhanced rates and faradaic efficiencies in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to alcohols. The results firstly showed that including bismuth as co-catalyst lowered the overpotential required, denoting a Cu-Bi synergic contribution in the reduction pathway of CO2. The electrolysis product analyses show methanol and ethanol as liquid species obtained from CO2 reduction, together with formic acid. The gas phase is mainly composed of hydrogen, together with carbon monoxide and small concentrations of ethylene. The maximum reaction rates for CO2 conversion to methanol and ethanol are rCH3OH =29.7 μmol·m−2·s-1 (FE = 8.6%) and rC2H5OH =48.8 μmol·m−2·s-1 (FE = 28.3%), respectively, for the CuBi-based materials at j = 20 mA·cm−2. These values enhance those obtained at homometallic Cu and Bi-based electrodes, which is associated with a favored interplay between Cu-Bi and reaction intermediates, prompting the formation of methanol and CC coupling reaction to ethanol. The Cu/Bi metal ratio in the electrode surface as well as the current density applied to the system seems to be key parameters for controlling reaction selectivity. The optimum values for a more selective CO2 reduction to alcohols can be set at a Bi content of 12% and a current density of j = 20 mA·cm−2. Besides, the mixed-metal systems remained pseudo-stable after 5 h of operation in liquid media (FEliq ˜50%, FEalcohols ˜30%). These results denote the potential of CuBi bimetallic-based electrodes and expand the field of innovative electrocatalysts for the continuous conversion of CO2 to alcohols. The work also paves a new way of invigorating the electrochemical conversion of CO2 by using MOF-based electrodes."
