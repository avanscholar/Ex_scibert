0,Introduction,"Industrialisation in the past several decades has made it necessary for mankind to exploit the fossil resources at an alarming rate. This has led to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere causing climate change problems. The negative effect caused by the usage of non-renewable and unsustainable sources of energy has led to the increase in research for the development of renewable and sustainable alternatives. Biomass, defined as any organic matter produced by the process of photosynthesis, is the only renewable source of organic carbon [1]. Though solar, wind, tidal energy can be used to produce electricity, only biomass can be used for the production of hydrocarbons in an environmental friendly manner [2]. But also recently CO2 has been used for production of hydrocarbon [3]. Feed for the production of second generation biofuels which does not cause the food vs fuel issue is lignocellulosic biomass. It encompasses the energy crops specifically for the production of biofuels/chemicals, agricultural and forest residues [4]. The composition of lignocellulosic biomass is mainly cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin together with a small amount of inorganic material and extractives [5]. Forest residues constitute all those residues that are obtained during the pruning of the trees or while felling it. Any small trees or branches or tops that are obtained in this process during forest clearing can also be used as feedstock for biofuel production. In addition, when these logs are processed in saw mills, huge amounts of saw dust is obtained which can be collected at regular intervals and small decentralised units can be operated using the same. Forest residues thus obtained can be used for the production of bio-fuels/chemicals [6]. Deodar belongs to the Pinaceae family and is softwood whose lignin is mainly composed of guaiacyl units [7]. It is an evergreen coniferous tree widely available in the western Himalyan region. The wood is widely used for various purposes and hence, large quantities of saw dust are available which can be valorized to hydrocarbons/chemicals. There are various methods of conversion of biomass of which thermo-chemical methods have gained interest in the recent past [8]. Among them, the process which is seen to have the maximum potential for commercialisation in short- and medium-term for the production of valuable hydrocarbons is pyrolysis which is defined as the decomposition of any organic material in the absence of oxygen [9]. Pyrolysis can be carried out under inert atmosphere or in the presence of hydrogen pressure creating a reductive atmosphere. Depending upon the residence time of the feed and product vapours inside the reactor and heating rate, pyrolysis can be classified into slow, fast and flash pyrolysis. In slow pyrolysis, the residence time/reaction time for feed in the reactor is in the range of 30–60 min. Some of the products of pyrolysis include bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gases. Bio-oil is a source of hydrocarbons which can be used for fuel applications after upgradation or is a rich source of functional chemicals such as phenolic compounds, aromatic ethers, furans etc. Bio-char is a solid product obtained by the process of pyrolysis and can be used for soil amendment/enrichment purposes, as adsorbents, catalysts/catalyst supports, for high value applications such as super capacitors, electrodes etc. Slow pyrolysis of barks of Pinus brutia were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere and maximum bio-oil yield of 33.25% was obtained at 450 °C and a heating rate of 40 °C min−1. Bio-oil obtained was mostly composed of oxygenated components with low quantities of hydrocarbons [10]. Huff et al., compared the bio-chars derived from pinewood by the process of pyrolysis in the presence of nitrogen and hydrothermal conversion. The bio-char yields at 300, 400 and 500 °C were 32.89, 27.26 and 26.47% respectively [11]. Mixed wood samples have been pyrolysed in the presence of hydrogen and proprietary catalyst in a continuous reactor with fast heating rates. At 396 °C, 2.24 MPa pressure and weight hourly space velocity of 1.52, bio-oil yield of 25.1% was obtained [12]. It was observed that reducing environment had a pronounced effect on the pyrolysis of biomass. Venkatakrishnan et al., used poplar feed to carry out fast hydropyrolysis and vapour-phase catalytic hydrodeoxygenation and observed 32% hydrocarbon yield in the liquid fuel range [13]. With other feedstocks as well, hydrogen pressure was seen to play an important role in the quality of the products obtained [13–20]. It has been observed that in the presence of hydrogen, no undesirable polynuclear aromatics, olefins, or reactive free radicals are formed [12,15]. The originality of the present investigation is to understand the effect of environment on pyrolysis of Cedrus deodara saw mill shavings and product distribution for obtaining more bio-oil yield. The compositional differences in the bio-oil at different reaction parameters have been established for the first time. When the reaction environment is changed, the products obtained are different owing to the differences in the reaction mechanism that the feed undergoes and hence, is an important process parameter to be optimised. To establish this, experiments have been carried out at 350 and 400 °C and 0.1, 1, 2 and 3 MPa under hydrogen pressure and at temperatures of 300, 350, 400 and 450 °C in case of nitrogen atmosphere and products such as bio-oil and bio-char have been obtained. The liquid and solid products have been characterised using various analytical techniques such as Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR), Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)."
1,Materials and methodology,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Deodar (Cedrus deodara) shavings have been obtained from a saw mill in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India and have been sieved using standard mesh to obtain particle size between 0.5 and 2 mm."
3,Characterisation methods,"2.2 Characterisation methods The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in Shimadzu DTG-60 instrument under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The trace metal analysis of deodar was carried out using DRE, PS-3000 UV, Leeman Labs Inc., Inductively Coupled Plasma- Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. The gross calorific value of the feed has been obtained using the Parr 6300 Bomb Calorimeter. The ultimate analysis has been carried out using Elementar vario micro cube unit. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer with the sample powder diluted in KBr. SEM images have been collected on a FEI Quanta 200 F, using tungsten filament doped with lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) as an X-ray source, fitted with an ETD (Everhart Thornley Detector), which preferentially work as a secondary electron detector. The sample for SEM analysis has been dispersed on a carbon coated adhesive followed by gold coating. 1H NMR of the bio-oils was carried out in Bruker Ultrashield 500 Plus instrument using CDCl3 as solvent. The liquid products were analysed via gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent 7890B). The carrier gas was He and column flow rate was 1 cm3 min−1. A HP-1 column (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.17 μm) was used in GC–MS. An oven program was set at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to 260 °C for 5 min. The injected volume was 0.4 μL in a splitless mode."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The schematic diagram of the prototype hydropyrolysis unit has been provided in an earlier communication [21]. In brief, oven dried deodar is weighed (10 g) and loaded into the reactor. The reactor is purged with hydrogen to remove the inside air and then pressurized using hydrogen till the desired pressure is reached. It is heated in an electrical furnace which is controlled by a temperature programmed controller. The thermocouples are placed in the skin and in the heart of the reactor inside the thermowell provided. The gas from the hydrogen cylinder is passed into the reactor. The required final temperature and heating rate (20 °C min−1) are set and the final temperature is maintained for 1 h. The pressure is maintained constant by the means of a needle valve. The product stream from the reactor is passed through a shell and tube heat exchanger with water in the shell side at 4 °C. Slow pyrolysis of deodar has been performed in a fixed bed glass reactor (length: 28 cm; i.d. 3.4 cm) under atmospheric pressure of nitrogen as shown in Fig. 1 . The same particle size feedstock has been used in this study as well. At first, 5 g of the feed was loaded into the reactor and the reactor was purged with nitrogen to remove the inside air. The nitrogen flow rate during pyrolysis was 50 cm3 min−1. The starting temperature was the ambient room temperature at 25 °C and the heating rate to reach the pyrolysis final temperature (300, 350, 400 and 450 °C) was set at around 20 °C min−1. Once final pyrolysis temperature was attained, the reactor was maintained at the required temperature for a period of 1 h to ensure that all condensable vapours were collected. Biomass bed temperature as indicated using thermocouple 1 has been taken as the pyrolysis temperature and another thermocouple indicated the skin temperature of the reactor. The vapours formed after the reaction was condensed using cooling water maintained at 4 °C. Water in the bio-oil was removed by the addition of anhydrous sodium sulphate and acetone was used to recover the organic fraction. The experiments have been carried out in duplicates and average results have been reported. The remaining solid after the reaction left in the reactor is termed as bio-char. Bio - char yield, wt . % = [ ( ( Weight of reactor after reaction ) − ( Weight of empty reactor ) ) / ( Weight of feed ) ] ∗ 100 Gas yield, wt . % = 100 − ( Bio - oil yield, wt . % + Bio - char yield, wt . % ) Conversion to liquid and gaseous products, % = 100 − ( Bio - char yield, wt . % ) Bio-oil yield, wt.% = [((Weight of measuring cylinder with bio-oil) − (Weight of empty measuring cylinder))/(Weight of feed)]*100"
5,Results and discussions,"The ultimate analysis of deodar was found to be as follows: carbon (46.29 wt.%), hydrogen (7.48 wt.%) and sulphur (0.51 wt.%). The gross calorific value of the feedstock was found to be 17.74 MJ kg−1. Deodar contained 12.68% moisture, 87.30% volatile matter and 1.34% ash. Deodar belongs to the softwood category composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The typical composition of deodar as obtained from literature is as follows: holocellulose (70.00%–75.87%), α-cellulose (40.75%–42.75%) and lignin (26.64%–25.00%) and is of indicative nature [22]. The thermogravimetry-differential thermogravimetry (TG-DTG) curve in Fig. 2 showed that deodar had a single significant decomposition step. The trace metal analysis of deodar shows that it contains metals such as Ca (10,100 ppm), Mg (3800 ppm), Fe (6600 ppm) and Si (5400 ppm) which are due to the inherent nature of the soil in which it is grown."
6,Product yields by pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere,"3.1 Product yields by pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere Product distribution from hydropyrolysis of deodar at pressures of 0.1, 1, 2 and 3 MPa at constant final temperatures of 350 and 400 °C have been presented in Table 1 . At both the temperatures, the trend followed by bio-oil, bio-char and gas yields were similar. The bio-oil yield at every pressure condition was higher at 400 °C than at 350 °C. The bio-oil yield was a maximum at 0.1 MPa pressure and with increase in pressure from 1 to 3 MPa, the bio-oil yield reduces though the difference in yields at 2 and 3 MPa is negligible. It has been well established that the bio-oil quality produced under higher hydrogen pressure is better than the case with nitrogen [15]. With increase in pressure, the bio-char yield increases since more vapours are in the vicinity of bio-char leading to more bio-char formation. The presence of bio-char in the vicinity of bio-oil vapours triggers the re-polymerisation reactions which lead to the increased production of bio-char [23]. At 3 MPa pressure, secondary cracking is seen to take place as the yield of non-condensable gases increases at the expense of bio-oil and bio-char. In case of hydrogen environment, experiments at 400 °C have produced more bio-oil than experiments at 350 °C at all pressures of hydrogen. Even with an increase of 1 MPa in the hydrogen pressure from 2 to 3 MPa, there is no significant improvement in the bio-oil yield. It is also well known that in thermal conditions, higher pressures of hydrogen have to be maintained to enable hydrogen participation in the reaction. Hence, 400 °C and 2 MPa pressure are taken as suitable process parameters for the hydropyrolysis of deodar. The results are in line with those available in literature for typical forest residues [12]."
7,Product yields by pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere,"3.2 Product yields by pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere Slow pyrolysis of deodar under nitrogen atmosphere has been carried out at 300, 350, 400 and 450 °C and the product distribution has been provided in Table 2 . Maximum bio-oil yield of 46.5 wt.% was obtained at 350 °C and with further increase in temperature, the bio-oil yield decreased. Conversion was seen to increase with increase in temperature due to the primary decomposition of biomass. The increasing temperature also had an effect on the non-condensable gases yield which increased at higher temperatures due to secondary cracking [24]. The bio-oil yield was higher [10] and bio-char yield was lower [11] than that obtained with pine as reported in the open literature. As bio-oil is the desired product, 350 °C has been considered as the most favourable temperature for slow pyrolysis of deodar under nitrogen atmosphere. The most suitable conditions for slow pyrolysis of deodar under hydrogen and nitrogen environments have been established and the characterisation of the pyrolysis products such as bio-oil and bio-char is required for the better understanding of the effect of reaction atmosphere. The optimum conditions have been established and it can be seen that hydrogen pressure plays an important role in the hydropyrolysis. The temperature conditions required for pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere are milder than the temperature required for pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere."
8,Bio-oil characterisation,"3.3 Bio-oil characterisation 3.3.1 Fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR) The FT-IR spectra of feed and bio-oils at suitable conditions under hydrogen (400 °C and 2 MPa) and nitrogen atmosphere (350 °C and 0.1 MPa) are shown as Fig. 3 . From the spectra, it can be observed that the O–H stretching vibrations from 3600 to 3400 cm−1 are present in the feed and both the bio-oils. In case of feed and bio-oil obtained under N2 atmosphere, peak corresponding to C–H stretching vibrations from 2800 to 3000 cm−1are found indicating the presence of some saturated hydrocarbons in bio-oil from N2 environment. Conjugated carbonyl or carboxyl structures are present in both the bio-oils as peak is observed at 1707 cm−1. Peak at around 1600–1640 cm−1 corresponding to CC stretching vibration is observed in feed and both the bio-oils. The stretching aromatic ring vibration are found at around 1511 cm−1 in feed and bio-oil under N2 atmosphere but is not seen in bio-oil under H2 atmosphere. The other low intensity peaks found in feed correspond to C–H in plane deformation, O–H in plane bending, aromatic ring vibrations, C–O–C asymmetrical stretching and C–O, C–C–O stretching due to the presence of polymers in the feed [20,25]. It can be observed from the spectra that bio-oil formed under H2 and N2 atmosphere may have the presence of alkanes, alcohols and ethers. Several functionalities that are present in the feed are not present in the bio-oil which shows breakdown of the macromolecular structure. In addition, bio-oil under nitrogen atmosphere has more functionalities when compared to bio-oil obtained under hydrogen atmosphere which indicates differences in the cleavage pattern under different atmospheres. 3.3.2 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) NMR spectra are used to get information regarding the various types of protons present in the bio-oil. The most downfield region 0.5–1.5 ppm corresponds to the protons present in short chain aliphatics attached to carbon atoms which are atleast 2 bonds away from CC or heteroatom. The next region from 1.5 to 3 ppm corresponds to protons on aliphatic carbon atoms which are bonded to CC either aromatic or olefinic or are two bonds away from a heteroatom. The next region 3–4.4 ppm corresponds to protons that are attached to carbon atoms next to an aliphatic alcohol or ether or a methylene group which bonds two aromatic rings. The region from 4.4 to 6.0 ppm represents aromatic ether protons (i.e., lignin derived methoxyphenols) and hydrogen atoms of carbohydrate-like molecules. The range 6–8.5 ppm represents the aromatic region of the spectrum. It encompasses the protons in benzenoid molecules and heteroaromatics [26]. For the NMR studies, the spectra of the bio-oil obtained at 400 °C and 2 MPa for pyrolysis under hydrogen atmosphere and, 350 ​°C and 400 °C in case of pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere have been compared. In addition, bio-oil obtained at 400 °C and 0.1 MPa under hydrogen atmosphere has also been compared (Table 3 ). With increase in pressure under hydrogen environment, the increase in the number of aliphatic protons can be clearly observed indicating the increase of saturated compounds. The reduction in the number of protons in 3.0–4.4 ppm and absence of protons in the next region from 4.4 to 6.0 ppm indicates effective decomposition of holocellulose and lignin present in deodar. Contrary to hydrogen atmosphere at 400 °C and 2 Mpa, bio-oil produced under nitrogen atmosphere at 400 °C has lesser number of protons in the aliphatic region. The high number of protons in the aromatic region indicates the presence of valuable phenolic compounds in the bio-oil. It also contains around 1% protons on aldehydes or carboxylic acids. 3.3.3 Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) GC–MS is a very powerful hyphenated technique that is used to identify the products formed by the reaction with the help of difference in retention time in a column followed by difference in molecular mass of the compound. The identified compounds have been classified into various groups such as phenolic derivatives and aromatic ethers which are majorly derived from the lignin component of lignocellulosic biomass, furans, acids/esters, hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, alcohols and other non-classified compounds (Table 4 ). Furans, acids/esters, hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, alcohols are produced generally from the holocellulose fraction and the aromatic ethers, phenolic compounds are produced generally from the lignin fraction of the feedstock shown in supplementary Fig. (S1). Bio-oils under nitrogen environment were majorly composed of phenolic compounds. All of these compounds were affected by the pyrolysis temperature. As the temperature was increased from 350 to 400 °C, the yields of some major compounds such as Catechol, p-Cresol, 4-Ethylcatechol,2-methyl-phenol, Creosol, trans-Isoeugenol were decreased and 4-methyl-1,2-Benzenediol, 3,5-dimethyl-phenol, Phenol were increased. Hydrocarbons such as azulene, naphthalene, cycloeicosane are also observed to have formed in addition to heteroaromatics such as furans. Alcohols, carbonyl compounds and acids are also observed in minor quantities which are also supported by the 1H NMR data. On the other hand, bio-oils under hydrogen environment at 400 °C and 2 Mpa were primarily composed of phenolics and aromatic ethers. The number of compounds identified was less than in case of nitrogen but their area percentage was high. The compound with highest area percentage or in other terms selectivity is catechol which was obtained in highest amount during pyrolysis under hydrogen at 400 °C than the amount obtained during pyrolysis at 350 and 400 °C under nitrogen environment. Area percentage of vanillin was higher in case of pyrolysis under hydrogen environment at 400 °C and 2 Mpa than the pyrolysis carried out under nitrogen environment at 400 °C, on the other hand area percentage of 4-methyl-1,2-Benzenediol was higher when pyrolysis was carried out at 400 °C under N2 environment compared to pyrolysis carried out in H2 environment at 400 °C. Some of the other identified compounds Homovanillic acid, apocynin, 2,4′-Dihydroxy-3′-methoxyacetophenone, 3-methoxy-Pyridine, Maltol, 2-propyl-Tetrahydrofuran Retene etc were present under hydrogen environment at 400 °C but not present under nitrogen environment at 350 and 400 °C. Hence, it can be observed that the bio-oil produced by pyrolysis of deodar under hydrogen and nitrogen environments is different indicating the difference in the decomposition steps."
9,Bio-char characterisation,"3.4 Bio-char characterisation 3.4.1 Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy The FT-IR spectra of feed and bio-chars at optimum pyrolysis conditions under hydrogen and nitrogen environments in the given experimental set up are shown as Fig. 4 . The feed spectra as discussed earlier shows several vibrations corresponding to O–H stretching, C–H stretching, CO stretching, aromatic ring vibration, C–H in plane deformation, O–H in plane bending, aromatic ring vibrations, C–O–C asymmetrical stretching and C–O, C–C–O stretching due to cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin moieties. The bio-char spectra show the absence of most functionalities indicating maximum conversion of bio-char. The presence of single peak at 1590 cm−1 attributed to the CC stretching indicates the formation of aromatic bio-char [27]. The results obtained are in line with those observed in literature for forest biomass where high degree of aromatic functionality is observed in bio-chars derived by pyrolysis [11]. 3.4.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM images of feed deodar and bio-char at suitable process conditions under hydrogen and nitrogen environment are shown as Fig. 5 . All the images are provided at the same resolution and the scale is 20 μm. Deodar feed is observed to have rough surface with the absence of any pores. Upon pyrolysis under hydrogen environment, some pores are seen to have formed which indicate the loss of some moieties from the macromolecular backbone. Under nitrogen environment, semi tubular structures are observed in the micrograph without any porosity. Bio-oil and bio-char obtained under hydrogen and nitrogen atmospheres are seen to be different from each other due to the differences in reaction mechanism. The probable reaction mechanism under nitrogen environment could be the random thermal cracking of the large biomass molecule which leads to an increased variation in the products formed. However, in the presence of hydrogen it could be the systematic bond cleavage (initiation with hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation, bond breaking in the order of increasing bond strength and stability of formed components etc.) in the macromolecular structure which leads to the formation of few products with higher selectivity [28]. Bio-oil produced under hydrogen can be in-situ hydrodeoxygenated to produce fuels. The hydrogen required for the process can be obtained by reforming the off gases of the reaction as demonstrated by researchers already thereby making the process self-sustainable in nature [15]. Bio-oil obtained under nitrogen atmosphere in decentralised units can be used locally or then transported to a centralised biorefinery where it can be separated to produce value added chemicals or upgraded to fuels. Bio-char can be used locally as a soil amendment or for slow release of fertilisers. Bio-char when activated can be used as catalysts/catalysts supports and high value applications such as electrodes, super-capacitors etc."
10,Conclusions,"Deodar is a potential feedstock among the forest residues for the production of renewable fuels/chemicals. Pyrolysis of deodar under hydrogen and nitrogen environments is seen to occur by different mechanisms due to the evident differences in the physico-chemical characterisation of bio-oil and bio-char. The most suitable process conditions for the pyrolysis under hydrogen environment are 400 °C and 2 MPa and for nitrogen atmosphere is 350 °C. The bio-oil under hydrogen atmosphere shows that systematic cleavage has occurred due to the high selectivity towards catechol. Bio-oil under nitrogen atmosphere is also majorly composed of phenolic compounds and aromatic ethers. In the presence of hydrogen, cleavage within the macromolecular structure of biomass is seen to be systematic in nature and in the presence of nitrogen, it is observed to be random in nature. The complete loss of functionality and the aromatic nature of bio-char indicate the complete conversion of biomass."
