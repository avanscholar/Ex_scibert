0,Introduction,"Shrimp pond sediment or pond sludge is considered as aquaculture waste which is mainly generated by unconsumed feed and fecal materials. Shrimp pond sediment is accumulated approximately 1.88–3.35 liters/sq.m. or 5351.42–9535.78 litters/pond (the earthen shrimp ponds were 2846.5 sq.m/pond) within 3–4 months of the cultivation [1]. The accumulation of sediment can reach 62.92 liters/sq.m. (179,101.78 liters/pond) depend on shrimp density [2]. Base on global shrimp pond area reported by Dr. Aaron McNevin and Claude E. Boyd in 2018 [3] of 2135,110 ha, Thailand was shown to have 32,440 ha of shrimp farming area which could possibly generate at least 609 million liters of pond sediment within 3–4 months. The accumulation of pond sediment effects on decreasing shrimp production caused by toxic metabolites generated during anoxic conditions at the pond bottom [4–6]. The release of shrimp pond sediment to wetlands is the traditional way of reducing pond sediment which causes a major problem to the environment due to its high organic contents and microorganism density [6,7]. There are several practices to reduce the accumulation of pond sediment besides draining. Drying is one of the common practices that increases the degradation process of organic and inorganic matter in sediment as well as reduces pathogenic organisms in shrimp ponds [8] but this method is time consuming, requires a large area and increases the soil layer in the pond. However, removing sediment from the pond is required to reduce sludge accumulation. Removing fresh sediment after harvesting is another promising practice so that the ponds can be used continuously for new cultivation. Besides, fresh sediment is managed to use as an organic source for energy production and fertilizer to meet an idea of a sustainable farm. Nevertheless, fresh sediment directly used as fertilizer does not favour most plants due to its high concentration of salt and toxic metabolites such as organic acids, nitrite, hydrogen sulphide and methane etc. [4,9,10]. However, these metabolites are useful for energy production based on the fermentation process. Some researches used shrimp pond sediment to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion processes [9,11]. The production of biogas (CH4) from organic waste has been attractive for many years in terms of reducing fossil fuels usage and waste treatment [12]. Not only is biogas produced, but other biofuels such as biohythane and biohydrogen are also produced by anaerobic digestion technology. Biohythane is a mixture of H2 (10–30%v/v) and CH4 gases mostly produced by a two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) process in two separated fermenters of organic liquid and solid wastes [13]. First stage is dark fermentation through hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis in which H2 is produced by acid-producing bacteria. Second stage is methane production through methanogenesis by methane-producing bacteria [14–16]. Presenting H2 in the gaseous mixture gives higher energy than CH4 only and also its combustion is able to reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the cost of two-stage AD operation is still higher than single stage AD [17,18]. However, Vo et al. developed single-stage anaerobic fermentation in two-compartment bioreactor in order to separate hydrogenesis (dark fermentation) and methanogenesis steps for biohythane production [19]. It is showed that at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days was successfully produced 8.6% hydrogen and 48.0% methane. Nevertheless, biohythane production is not yet reported in one-compartment bioreactor of single-stage AD. There are many factors that affect the AD process. The most effective parameters are inoculum percentage and feedstock recirculation followed by total solid, retention time and pH [20]. The immobilization of microorganisms on supporting material is one of the techniques that is extensively used in the AD process. The microbial immobilization occurs as the biofilm after supporting material (or immobilized media) being added in digesters. For example, microbes in fixed bed anaerobic reactors were immobilized on the porous materials after being submerged in reactors [21]. Similarly, microorganisms from palm oil mill effluent (POME) formed the biofilm on plastic bioball in anaerobic filter reactor (AFR) after this bioball being incubated with POME [22]. Three generations of immobilized media and the immobilization mechanism in wastewater treatment have been reviewed by Shin et al. [23]. Applying different types of materials to immobilize microorganisms, especially methanogens in AD to enhance robustness in the process has been much studied [24]. There were reports of using zeolite media to enhance CH4 production in anaerobic digestion [25–27]. It was shown that immobilizing media had more influence in anaerobic digestion efficiency than other factors such as Organic Loading Rate; OLR, Feed to Inoculum; F/I ratio, C/N ratio, etc.[28]. Moreover, activated carbon media shows the improvement of CH4 production (1.6–1.8 fold) [29,30] and H2 production [31,32]. Not only is natural media used in AD process but synthetic polymer media is also applied in wastewater treatment such as PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) [23]. However, these materials still have drawbacks as they are expensive and impractical for large scale operations especially for synthetic polymer [33]. The desire for new composite material which is not found in conventional material is intensively interesting [34] especially the abundant materials such as clay. Bentonite clay is a layer silicate material which is composed of montmorillonite as the main component and layered with cations such as Na+ and Ca2+ [35]. It was used as adsorbent to remove contaminate in water including antibiotics, petroleum and radioactive waste as well as being used in industrial scale application [36]. Furthermore, bentonite clay was studied for microbial attachment function. It was proved to be capable of microbial attachment [37]. However, the study of composite material of bentonite clay with activated carbon and zeolite as immobilizing media for microbial attachment and biogas production in AD system has not yet been performed. In this research, three types of immobilizing media were investigated including homogenous mixtures of activated carbon powder or zeolite powder or a mixture of zeolite and activated carbon powder with bentonite clay as the binder on microbial attachment and biogas production. The suitable material was applied in one-compartment bioreactor of single stage AD using shrimp pond sediment which is an aquaculture waste as a substrate and microbial consortium to evaluate the effect of immobilizing media in biogas production and waste treatment. Furthermore, the characterization of microbial communities in these digesters (sediment) as well as in immobilizing media was carried out to study the relationship of biogas production and microbial community."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of immobilizing media,"2.1 Preparation of immobilizing media Three types of immobilizing media were prepared following previous experiment [25] to study microbial attachment in waste treatment process and to observe the biogas production under anaerobic digestion (single AD). Briefly, the immobilized media were ring shaped homogenous mixtures of activated carbon powder or zeolite powder or a mixture of zeolite and activated carbon powder with bentonite clay as the binder (named CAC, CZ and CACZ respectively) after being extruded, dried and calcined in a furnace. The surface area of these immobilizing media were analyzed using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Quantachrome, United State)."
3,Microbial attachment in immobilizing media,"2.2 Microbial attachment in immobilizing media CAC, CZ and CACZ were submersed in each reactor containing 200 ml of synthetic wastewater (10 g/L sucrose) supplemented with inorganic salt following Nakasaki et al. [38] at pH 8.08, mixed with inoculum from fruit juice waste provided by Nakasaki’s Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan to study the microbial attachment on the surface of immobilizing media. The incolum/substrate ratio was 1:10. The semi-batch digestion was performed for 14 days under anaerobic condition at 39 °C compared to control reactor without immobilizing media."
4,Microbial attachment analysis,"2.3 Microbial attachment analysis The specimens of CAC, CZ and CACZ were crushed to observe microbial attachment inside pores (macro and micro pores) using scanning electron microscopy at electron microscopy center, Burapha University, Thailand, following the institution’s protocol. DNA extraction from CAC, CZ and CACZ specimens was achieved by GF-1 Bacterial DNA Extraction kit (Vivantis, Malaysia). DNA samples were measured by spectrophotometry technique and used as templates for PCR amplification. 16s rRNA gene was amplified by using PCR primers and conditions following Nakasaki et al. [38]. All DNA samples were amplified using platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, United State) and the amplification results were converted to intensity using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, United State) for approximate estimation of archaea and bacteria quantity."
5,Anaerobic digestion,"2.4 Anaerobic digestion Anaerobic fermentation using shrimp pond sediment was modified from Srinakorn et al. [1]. Shrimp pond sediment was collected from shrimp farms at Tha Kham, Panatnikom, Chonburi, Thailand. Fresh-black sediment sample on the first layer was collected after shrimp harvesting by avoiding sand in the second layer, stored in a glass jar and used immediately to produce biogas. Temperature and pH of sediment in the pond were measured as initial value. Six hundred grams of fresh sediment was added in each 1 L Erlenmeyer flask as batch reactors then CACs were added in three different ratios comprised of 3%, 4% and 5% w/w sediment. The reactor without CAC was used as a control reactor. All the joints, gas tubes and cap of reactors were enclosed properly to provide anaerobic condition. All reactors were wrapped by aluminum foil to provide dark fermentation conditions at 39 °C controlled temperature for 15 days. Biogas volume was measured using bubble counters (Thai Amp Electronic, Thailand) and collected in biogas bags (SKC, United State). Temperature and pH were measured using thermocouple and pH probes by recording and collecting daily using Signal Express equipment and software, respectively (National Instruments, Thailand). Gas chromatography (VARIAN, United State) was used to analyze biogas composition by using molecular sieve columns for detecting CH4, H2 and CO2."
6,Feedstock analysis,"2.5 Feedstock analysis Total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS), total fixed solid (TFS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of sediment before and after fermentation were measured following standard methods (Federation & Association, 2005). Meanwhile, organic matter (OM) and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio were analyzed using Walkley-Black method and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method for total organic carbon and nitrogen assays, respectively (Soil-Fertilizer-environment science development project, Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kasetsart University, Thailand)."
7,Quantitative analysis of microorganism in non-immobilizing and immobilizing anaerobic digesters,"2.6 Quantitative analysis of microorganism in non-immobilizing and immobilizing anaerobic digesters DNA extraction method was modified from Dong et al. and Roose et al. [39,40]. Approximately one gram of 0.5 mm glass beads was added in the washing step. Microbial (archaea and bacteria) quantity which was determined by 16s rRNA gene intensity, was carried out following 2.3."
8,Microbial population in anaerobic digesters,"2.7 Microbial population in anaerobic digesters 2.7.1 Non-immobilizing digesters 2.7.1.1 Metagenomics DNA library preparation and Roche GS 454 pyrosequencer Genomic DNA was isolated from shrimp pond sediment using GF-1 Bacterial DNA Extraction kit (Vivantis, Malaysia). The metagenomics library of 16S rRNA gene was prepared using PCR based methods. The 16S rRNA genes of bacteria and archaea were amplified using primers 27F (5′ TCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3′) and 532R (5′ CACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC 3′) that are specific to V1-V3 region. Additionally, MID 10-digit barcode sequences on the 5′ end of the forward and reverse primers (AGCACTGTAG and AGCACTGTAG) were applied to the sample to allow multiplexed sequencing downstream according to 454 sequencing system (Roche, Germany). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed by applying the methods of Tannock et al., Weisburg et al. and Banning et al. [41–43] using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), according to the protocol provided by the company. Size of PCR amplicons approximately 400–500 bp were purified using PCR Purification (QIAGEN, USA) and sequenced with a Roche GS 454 pyrosequencer (Roche, Germany) serviced by Biogenomed Co. Thailand. 2.7.1.2 Metagenomic sequences analysis for GS 454 platform Sequences were processed through the MacQIIME 1.9.1 pyrosequencing pipeline combined with the set of programs including Anaconda Python 2.7.10, with numpy, matplotlib and PyCogent, mothur, UCLUST, ChimeraSlayer, PyNAST, FastTree, RDP Classifier, Infernal, tax2tree, pplacer, cd-hit, muscle, clearcut, raxml etc. (http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime) [44]. Following that, the low quality and noise of sequences were identified and removed by Denoiser [45]. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned using UCLUST-based [46] at a similarity threshold of 97%. OTUs were classified into taxonomic classification using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier [47] and the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene reference database [48,49] at 80% confidence threshold. 16S rRNA gene similarities were searched using PyNAST [50] against Greengenes database with a filtered set at 97% similarity. 2.7.2 Immobilizing digesters 2.7.2.1 DNA extraction and Next generation sequencing (NGS) by Illumina Miseq platform Genomic DNA from CAC was extracted by innuSPEED soil DNA kit (Analytik Jena, Germany). NGS was performed by Illumina Miseq platform, done by Macrogen (Korea) which was serviced by Gibthai Co., Ltd (Thailand). PCR amplification for NGS was done by one primer set for both of archaea and bacteria which was 515F (5′ GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA 3′) and 806R (5′ GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT 3′) with adapter sequence. PCR condition followed denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min, 15 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 60 s and 72 °C for 90 s and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min [51]. 2.7.2.2 Metagenomic sequences analysis for Illumina Miseq platform Raw sequence reads from Illumina Miseq were created in BCL and Fastq file format using MiSeq sequencer and bcl2fastq (v2.20.0.422). An operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis was carried out with Macrogen's own program. SeqPurge software was used for OTU adapter Trimming [52]. FLASH (v1.2.11) was performed for read assembly to fast length adjustment of short reads to improve genome assemblies [53]. Sequencing error deletion and OTU clustering was conducted using CD-HIT-OTU [54] followed by taxonomic assignment and diversity analysis employing BLASTN (v2.4.0) (using NCBI 16S database version 2018.12.16) and QIIME (v1.9) respectively."
9,Statistical analysis,2.8 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. The data were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significant of the results was analyzed by One-way ANOVA with p-value < 0.05 (http://vassarstats.net/).
10,Results and discussion,
11,Evaluation of immobilizing media for microbial attachment in anaerobic digesters,"3.1 Evaluation of immobilizing media for microbial attachment in anaerobic digesters Microbial immobilization is one of the effective methods to increase biogas production [21,22]. However, the immobilizing media is still under development to improve attachment capacity and reduce costs. In the previous study, the low cost immobilizing media were developed using clay mixed with activated carbon which were produced by agricultural waste and zeolite as raw materials to increase biogas production yield [25]. Nevertheless, microbial attachment capacity is not well understood. The suitable immobilizing material among CAC, CZ and CACZ for microbial immobilization was demonstrated by SEM assays and DNA concentration of attaching microorganism along with their surface area using BET assay. According to BET result, CAC showed the highest surface area (130 m2/g) similar to surface area of activated carbon (138 m2/g) [55] followed by CACZ (87 m2/g) and CZ (57 m2/g). This result implied that CAC could provide more area for microbial attachment than the other two. There were reports supporting that obtaining greater surface area resulted in higher microbial accumulation [21,26,28]. To confirm the microbial attachment on the surface of immobilizing media, we performed an anaerobic digestion by submerging CAC, CZ and CACZ in synthetic wastewater using fruit juice inoculum to allow the microbial immobilization and fermentation. After 14 days of anaerobic digestion, the submerged media was cracked to observe microorganism attachment on immobilizing media pores by SEM. It showed that the highest amounts of microbial colonies were presented in the pore structure of CAC ( Fig. 1a) followed by CACZ (Fig. 1b) while CZ pores rarely showed microbial colonies (Fig. 1c). We continued to measure the immobilized microbial quantity on these media by determination of DNA concentration. The highest DNA concentration was found on CAC samples followed by CACZ and CZ (567.9, 300.0 and 192.9 µg/ml) respectively. In agreement with these results, CAC showed to be the most appropriate material for supporting microbial attachment in this research. Furthermore, for microbial morphological observation from SEM results, CAC exhibited both coccus-like and bacillus-like microbes on its surface which obviously resulted in a higher amount of coccus-like than bacillus-like microbes (Fig. 1a) while CACZ surface showed more or equal of bacilli-like and coccus-like microbes (Fig. 1b). Whereas, CZ surface illustrated only bacillus-like bacteria (Fig. 1c). In other studies, most activated carbon media displayed more bacillus-like than coccus-like microbes on their outer surface [56–58]. Unlikely, this research showed that CAC surface favored coccus-like than bacillus-like microbes. This may be caused by the different types of immobilizing media through their functional groups. However, the interaction between immobilized media and microbes in AD is not well described. In general, the interaction between cell and immobilization supports is by adsorption through the weak forces including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic bonds and van der Waals forces or some by covalent binding [59]. The functional groups of activated carbon that have been analyzed mainly included hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic acid, phenol, ketone and hydrocarbon [60,61]. As mentioned earlier, bentonite clay and zeolite are silicate materials that provide positive (Na+, Ca+) and negative charge (OH-, SO-) on their surface [62]. Once these two types of materials (activated carbon and silicate materials) are mixed, they can generate a new material which provides more possibility to adsorb various substances including microbial cells as well as immobilizing media in this study, which are homogenous mixture composite material. Especially, CAC which has more activated carbon than the rest, could possibly provide more and various functional groups. Those functional groups in CAC composite may interact with cell walls of microbes which are peptidoglycan containing hydroxyl and carbonyl groups (in gram positive such as cocci-like microbes) [63], lipopolysaccharide (gram negative such as bacillus-like microbes) and its secretory substances such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) containing carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, phosphate and sulfhydryl groups which are able to interact with cations [64]. Nonetheless, the functional groups of composite material could have been changed during the preparation process due to heat and pressure in the oven. However, functional groups of all types of supported media used in this research need to be explored in the future. Additionally, some possible microbes related to biogas production, which were observed on immobilized media in this research, were reviewed. Coccus-like microbes include Micrococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Methanococcus spp. and Methanosacrinaceae spp. while bacillus-like microbes are Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Clostridium spp. Exiguobacterium spp. and Methanobacterium spp. [65–67]. Nevertheless, this research is one of the recent studies that observe the microorganism attachment in supported media’s pores (macrospore and microspore). Additionally, average pore sizes of CAC and CZ are 1 µm (11,634 Å) and 5 µm (53,735 Å) which were calculated by BET analyzer. Pore size is another effect on microbial cell immobilization. Because the diameter size of coccus is approximately 0.5–2 µm while bacillus is 1–10 µm long and has 0.25–1 µm diameter [68], it influences in obtaining higher coccus-like microbes in pores of CAC than bacillus-like species. The effects of immobilizing media in biogas production were reviewed. Fernandez et al. [67] found that zeolite as a support media enhanced CH4 production while activated carbon enhanced biohydrogen production [24,31,32,67,69]. Moreover, addition of clay (bentonite) in biogas digesters could reduce the lag phase of CH4 production [70]. Based on results and discussions, CAC was shown to be the best candidate for microbial attachment. In the next section, the effect of different amounts of CAC on biogas production was studied."
12,Biogas production from shrimp pond sediment,"3.2 Biogas production from shrimp pond sediment Shrimp farming is the main form of aquaculture in Thailand. It used an approximate area of 80,000 ha in 2000 [71] which increased to 2135,110 ha by 2018 [3]. It's also causing major coastal pollution due to the lack of waste management. Shrimp pond sediment is an organic waste of shrimp farming. Due to the large amounts of shrimp pond sediment, it was used as an organic source for biogas production in this study. Shrimp pond sediment was digested at mesophilic temperature (39 °C) for 15 days, with and without CAC added as immobilizing media. Three different amounts of CAC including 3%, 4% and 5% w/w were submerged in digesters and studied the effect of biogas production. The results showed that control digester (shrimp pond sediment without CAC; S) presented the greatest volume (283 ml) of biogas production, followed by sediment with 5% CAC; S+CAC5 (186 ml), sediment with 4% CAC; S+CAC4 (115 ml) and sediment with 3% CAC; S+CAC3 (113 ml) digesters respectively ( Fig. 2a). It is indicated that adding CAC reduced biogas production or slow down the digestion process. However, among CAC added digesters, it was shown that increasing of CAC amounts slightly affected the increase of biogas volume. Then, compositions of biogas products of each digester were analyzed. Biogas compositions from S digester showed the highest methane (CH4) concentration (68.91%) along with 27.97% hydrogen (H2) and 3.12% carbon dioxide (CO2). By adding the CAC media in digesters, CH4 concentration in biogas products was dropped while H2 gas significantly increased nearly 3 folds compared to S digester as shown in Fig. 2(b). However, increasing CAC media seem to increase CH4 while reduce CO2 in biogas production. From gases analysis, it showed that CAC would inhibit methanogenesis resulting in high H2 accumulation. Nevertheless, CH4 was still detected in the system. This may cause by some type of methanogen which be able to survive after CAC was added. It also observed that adding CAC would help to maintain the pH in range of 6.8–7.5 (Fig. 2c) which is suitable pH for methanogen in biogas production [72–74]. Recently, there was not much information on biogas production from shrimp pond sediment. The presenting of H2 more than 2% in the biogas composition after 15 days of fermentation from this results is also not common [75]. There are reports of a mixture of H2 (10–30%v/v) and CH4 gases which is called biohythane. These gas compositions are similar to biogas result from S digester. Biohythane could be produced by a two-stage anaerobic process or solid waste of organic matter such as food wastes, agricultural residues [17,18] as well as aquaculture pond sediment in this research. Recently, biohythane is a promising sustainable energy source for automotive and other industries. It is considered as clean energy due to the hydrogen combustion being able to reduce greenhouse gas emission [17]. Furthermore, this research showed that adding of CAC immobilizing media can prolong H2 production in a longer period (15 days) of shrimp pond sediment digesters as mentioned earlier. Similar results were found in a study of the effect of polyethylene media on H2 production in batch reactors. It shows that H2 was constantly produced after day 4 [76]. In this research, high H2 concentration in biogas products (up to 70% Fig. 3(b)) was observed from CAC added digesters. It could apply for biohydrogen or biohythane production for vehicles in the future. By adding immobilizing media, it may change microbial communities in digesters and cause the differences of biogas composition. For more understanding, microbial communities on CAC media after fermentation were carried out and compared to microbial communities in control digesters (without CAC media) along with analysis of chemical properties of shrimp pond sediment."
13,Feedstock analysis before and after biogas production,"3.3 Feedstock analysis before and after biogas production Shrimp pond sediment was analyzed for chemical properties before and after the digestion process to evaluate the ability of waste treatment as shown in Table 1. pH was changed from slightly basic (7.88) at the beginning of fermentation to neutral (7.14) at the end of process in all digesters. The pH after digestion was in the optimum range for methanogenesis [77]. In the case of the solid content, total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS) and total fixed solid (TFS), these were reduced after digestion in all digesters with the highest removal rate of S digester. Conversely, chemical oxygen demand (CODt) were slightly increased excepted S+CAC5 digester. It is not common that COD increase after AD process. However, there are some discussions of how COD increase in AD system. For example, decreasing of TS/TFS such as carbonate, phosphate, iron etc. by chemolithotrophic bacteria such as Betaproteobacteria family for their cell growth [78], the accumulation of microbial cell lysis in the decay phase [79], and desorption of support media could possibly effect to higher COD observation. C/N ratio and organic matter (OM) of shrimp pond sediment were also analyzed and displayed in Table 1. However, effluence after the digestion might be useful as fertilizer for some mangrove species."
14,Estimation of bacteria and archaea number on supporting material using PCR amplification of 16s rRNA gene,"3.4 Estimation of bacteria and archaea number on supporting material using PCR amplification of 16s rRNA gene In Section 3.1, three types of immobilizing media including CAC, CACZ and CZ were investigated for the ability of microbial immobilization. CAC was illustrated as the highest microbial immobilization material based on DNA concentration, BET and SEM analysis followed by CACZ and CZ respectively. In this section, 16s rRNA gene of microorganism was used to evaluate microbial types on immobilizing media. Two major groups of bacteria involved in biogas production are eubacteria (or bacteria) and archaea. It found that the amounts of archaea which is related to CH4 synthesis, were similar in all 3 types of immobilizing media (Fig. 3). From this result, CAC is still the best candidate for microbial attachment so far. After CAC was added in shrimp pond sediment digesters to study the effect of different amounts of CAC on biogas production in Section 3.2, the total bacteria and archaea which were attached to CAC, were analyzed after 15 days of digestion. The results showed higher amounts of archaea on CAC media than in sediment of all digesters except in S digester ( Fig. 4). The highest amount of archaea was presented in S digester. It is related to the highest CH4 concentration which was produced from this reactor. Bacteria amounts were shown similarly in all samples. A possible explanation for this result is that adding CAC caused the total number of archaea to decrease, so the amount of CH4 decreased as well. However, there might be some certain types of archaea in the system that favor CAC media. As it showed in this result that more archaea were detected on CAC than in sediment. These types of microorganism were explored in the next section. From literature reviews, most of carbon based-material as conductive material (CM) were reported to enhance CH4 production as mentioned earlier in the introduction which were opposite from CAC in this research. It has been discussed how carbon based-material be able to increase archaea activity. For example, Martins et al. (2018) reviewed that adding CM such as granular activated carbon (GAC), carbon nanotubes (CNT), and biochar could induce interspecies electron transfer (IET) between bacteria and methanogenic archaea improving the rate of methanogenesis [80]. However, silica has been reported to be insulated from electrical conduction [81]. By mixing silica component with carbon based-material, it possibly interrupts IET resulting in the reduction of CH4. However, this hypothesis need to be proved to explain this result."
15,Analyzation of microbial community in shrimp pond sediment of control reactor (without immobilizing media; CAC) after biogas production using 454 pyrosequencing system of 16S rRNA gene,"3.5 Analyzation of microbial community in shrimp pond sediment of control reactor (without immobilizing media; CAC) after biogas production using 454 pyrosequencing system of 16S rRNA gene The predominant bacteria in shrimp pond sediment after biogas production was Proteobacteria phylum and the most abundant in this phylum was Alcaligenaceae family which was found up to 84.6% ( Table 2.). Alcaligenaceae Derxia sp. in this family was indicated as methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) by use of particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene that is a functional gene probe for specifying methanotrophic bacteria [82,83]. Simultaneously, Alcaligenes faecalis sp. in the same family was recognized as denitrifying bacteria and had been reported in enzyme production such as amylase, protease and carboxymethyl cellulose [84,85] as well as was exhibited as heterotrophic aerobic hydrogen producing bacteria using fructose and gluconate as substrate [86,87] due to containing enzyme NAD-reducing hydrogenase. Because of the existence of this family as predominant species, it affected to decreased CH4 production using shrimp pond sediment as substrate, while H2 was found in gas composition after 15 days of digestion. This could be an advantage of biohythane production. Meanwhile, CH4 concentration in biogas was lower compared to CH4 concentration from the other substrates. Moreover, detection of Alcaligenaceae family is probably because of low C/N ratio of shrimp pond sediment which represented protein as major composition. Sombatjinda et al. found Burkholderia sp. as predominant bacteria in shrimp pond sediment that exists in Betaproteobacteria class which is the same class that contain Alcaligenaceae family from this study [88]. Subsequently, other 2 classes in this phylum were Alphaproteobacteria class that represented Rhodobacteraceae family as it shows presence of DehRhb and HanR genes that are encoded to produce the enzymes haloalkane and haloacid dehydrogenases which are able to convert haloalkane and haloacid into alcohol, hydrogen halides and hydroxyalkanoic acid, respectively [89]. Another class was Gammaproteobacteria which contains Escherichia coli sp. that occurred in acidogenesis step [90] as well as methylobacter and methylocaldum genus that were presented in this class that were observed as MOB [83]. Moreover, some bacteria in Proteobacteria phylum such as Syntrophobacter wolinii were identified as syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) which are bacteria that convert acetate to H2 and CO2 [91,92]. In agreement with this finding, bacteria species in Proteobacteria phylum contributed in hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps in biogas production. The second phylum that participated in shrimp pond sediment was Firmicutes which was mainly represented by Clostridia class that was demonstrated in hydrolysis step [93] while Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum and Syntrophomonas wolfei in Clostridiales order demonstrated as SAOB [90,92]. Most of Clostridium in Clostridiaceae family in Wirth et al. [92] study were involved in hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps while Proteiniclasticum genus was observed as proteolytic bacteria as well as producing acetate, propionate and iso-butyrate in fermentation process [94]. In Tissierellaceae family, Tissierella sp. including Soehngenia was reported as acid producing bacteria [95]. For the other classes in this phylum, Erysipelotrichi class present Erysipelotrichaceae family that was displayed in biogas reactors [96] and identified as SAOB by using fhs gene that is the functional marker for detection of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity which is required in formate catalysis pathway. Moreover, SAOB was illustrated in CH4 production with high ammonia anaerobic digestion process [97]. This may support this result that low C/N ratio substrate of shrimp pond sediment (16.11) which may generate high ammonia in the system, is still be able to produce CH4 up to 68% due to the presence of SAOP. Bacilli is the other class in this phylum, Planococcaceae family that presented Planomicrobium sp., both of which exhibited their ability to produce enzyme for hydrolyzing substrate such as aesculin, casein and gelatin likewise using various types of sugar to produce acid [98,99]. In conclusion, hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps occurred from bacteria in this phylum. The third dominant bacterial phylum that was found in this sample was Cyanobacteria which displayed Trebouxiophyceae family. In addition, Chlorella genus is obtained in this family and was demonstrated as bio-hydrogen producer [100] similar to Synechococcaceae family that presents Synechococcus genus which was illustrated as hydrogen producing bacteria [101]. However, bacterial species in this family were precipitated in acidogenesis step. From above reviews and discussion, it is shown that three main dominant microorganisms involved in biohythane production in shrimp pond sediment. There were other 3 phyla with fewer presentation in this sample. First was Actinobacteria phylum, where some research discussed Slackia heliotrinireducens and Bifidobacterium longum presenting in this phylum that were associated with hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps, respectively while Bacteroidetes phylum shown in Bacteroidales order exhibited Bacteroides capillosus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sp. in biogas production as bacteria in hydrolysis step. Spirochaetes was the other low abundant phylum that represents Sphaerochaeta genus which was associated with anaerobic process as well as the ability to produce various types of alcohol, H2, CO2 and acetate [102]. Finally, Planctomycetes phylum which exhibited Pirellulaceae family was recognized in sponges as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria for nitrite formation [103]. In previous study, Exiguobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis and Clostridium cochlearium were found in shrimp pond sediment as feedstock for biogas production which were not shown in 454-pyrosequencing but could be obtained from microbial cultivation. This may be caused by genomic DNA quality which may not be able to extract DNA from spore of bacteria such as Clostridium sp. and some Bacillus sp. The above mentioned species had been represented as predominant bacteria in biogas reactors as well [104]. Meanwhile, Bacillus, Exiguobacterium sp. and Clostridium were demonstrated as fermentative bacteria in acidogenesis step. Bacterial community in shrimp pond sediment could be categorized in 4 steps of biogas production ( Table 3), hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Most bacterial species were involved in acidogenesis following by hydrolysis, methanogenesis and acetogenesis steps, respectively. Some bacterial species were observed in 2 steps such as Actinobacteria, Alcaligenes, Planococcaceae, Planomicrobium, Proteobacteria and Proteiniclasticum sp. while Clostridiaceae was precipitated in all 3 steps. According to the studies by Wirth et al. and Suksong et al., they reported that microbial in hydrolysis step could work in acidogenesis step as well [92,105]. From microbial identification result of this research along with Shao [106], it showed thatshrimp pond sediment could be used as a good substrate for bioenergy production due to both its chemical and biological properties."
16,Changing of microbial population on CAC at initial and final processes,"3.6 Changing of microbial population on CAC at initial and final processes Microbial population on CAC was analyzed by next generation sequencing technique on Illumina MiSeq platform, where the target microbial species were bacteria and archaea that play a crucial role in anaerobic digestion process. Comparison of microbial on CAC at initial and final processes revealed that bacterial number was increased while decreasing of archaea number was shown ( Fig. 5). Microbial population from shrimp pond sediment on CAC in the beginning demonstrated Povalibacter uvarum, Thermomarinillinea lacunifontana, Lentimicrobium saccharophilum, Limisphaera ngatamariki and Lalibilibacter aurantiacus as predominant bacterial species while Methanosaeta concillii, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and Methanolinea mesophila were represented for archaea species. From these predominant bacterial species, P. uvarum is exhibited in Gammaproteobacteria class, Proteobacteria phylum, which is same as the dominant microbial species in shrimp pond sediment found from 454-pyrosequencing result. It is identified as strictly aerobic chemo-organotrophic bacteria which utilize complex media and fatty acid composition as substrate and has the ability to degrade poly-vinyl alcohol, producing H2S and indole [107]. T. lacunifontana is identified as obligately anaerobic bacteria and their growth occurs with protein-compound substrates [108]. L. saccharophilum is the other strictly anaerobic bacteria, producing acetate, malate, propionate, formate and hydrogen as end-fermentative products from glucose [109]. L. ngatamariki is strictly aerobic bacteria utilizing simple sugar and sugar derivatives [110]. L. aurantiacus is facultative anaerobic bacteria, producing acid from various types of sugar [111]. There were both aerobic and anaerobic microorganism from shrimp pond sediment attached on CAC surface. These dominant species showed the ability of utilizing fat, protein and carbohydrate in digester and many types of acids were produced along with H2. These products would be used as the substrates in acetogenesis and methanogenesis steps. For archaea population, dominant species were classified as methanogenic archaea including acetoclastic (M. concillii), methylotrophic (M.luminyensis) and hydrogenotrophic (M. mesophila) methanogen which utilize acetate, methanol and H2/CO2 as substrate to produce CH4, respectively. Meanwhile, methanogenic archaea that was found in prawn farm sediment were reported as Methanosarcina semesiae, Methanosarcina siciliae, Methanogenium organophilum, Methanosaeta sp. and Halobacterium cutirubrum [106] revealed as methylotrophic, hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogen which is similar to this results. From the beginning of AD process, the microbial population on CAC should be able to produce methane from various types of substrate. Contrastingly, CH4 was reduced while H2 was increased significantly (Fig. 2b). To understand this phenomenon, microbial population on CAC after fermentation need to be explored. For microbial diversity on CAC after digestion, Clostridium cellobioparum, Tolumonas auensis and Microbacter margulisiae represented as dominant bacterial species while only Methanobacterium aggregans was the dominant archaea species. More bacteria species were observed on CAC after digestion especially hydrogen producing bacteria that increased about 15% (Fig. 5b). C. cellobioparum is a major species responsible for H2 production. The increasing of hydrogen producing bacteria resulted to high H2 production in the system. Correspondingly, T. auensis and M. margulisiae participate in acetate, ethanol, propionate, formate and H2 production which are utilized as substrate for CH4 production by methanogen [109,112]. Nevertheless, archaea species was also decreased and only M. aggregans remained on CAC. It could dramatically decrease CH4. It could assume that CAC inhibited methanogenesis except M. aggregans. M. aggregans is hydrogenotrophic methanogen which can grow on H2 and CO2 and generate CH4 as a product [113]. However, the substrate accumulation from acidogenesis and acetogenesis could cause methanogens inhibition. The accretion of these substrates could convert to H2 by increasing the number of hydrogen producing bacteria. The effect of CAC in AD system showed the advantages in biohydrogen production as well as biohythane by changing microbial population to promote hydrogen producing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogen in single state AD of shrimp pond sediment. Moreover, CAC may have the ability to be applied with other organic waste to see the possibility of enhancing biohydrogen and biohythane production in the future."
17,Conclusions,"In this study, extruded clay/activated carbon composite (CAC) was suitable to use as supporting material for microbial attachment. The supplement of CAC in one-compartment bioreactor of single-stage AD using shrimp pond sediment as the substrate and consortium resulted in significant increase of H2 concentration than control reactors (without supplement) while CH4 concentration was reduced. In control digesters, the highest CH4 was detected along with H2 as biohythane. This showed the possibility of shrimp pond sediment to be used as the substrate for biohythane production as well as waste treatment. To optimize biohythane production from shrimp pond sediment, the conditions and consortium need to study future. The 16s rRNA gene quantification of bacteria and archaea showed that CAC could boost microbial immobilization. Additionally, the characterization of microbial community in shrimp pond sediment after biogas production showed Alcaligenaceae family, Tissierella Soehngenia sp. and Planomicrobium sp. as predominant species. Meanwhile, the study of microbial species on CAC after biogas production represented Clostridium cellobioparum, Tolumonas auensis and Microbacter margulisiae for bacterial and Methanobacterium aggregans for archaea as predominant species. This indicates that adding CACs affect the changing of microbial community in digesters which promoted hydrogen producing bacteria (Clostridium cellobioparum, Tolumonas auensis and Microbacter margulisiae) and hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanobacterium aggregans) while inhibited other methanogenic archaea resulting the mixed gases of H2 and CH4 as product. Moreover, study of microbial species in shrimp pond sediment and immobilized microorganism on CAC revealed the composition of various types of microorganism that have benefits on bioenergy production such as biohythane and biohydrogen."
