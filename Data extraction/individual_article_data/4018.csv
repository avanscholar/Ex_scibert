0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid depletion of fossil resources, energy and environmental-related crisis has drawn wide attention from all over the world [1]. The utilization of renewable biomass to produce fuels and bulk chemicals has been considered as a promising solution alternative [2]. However, due to their high acidity, poor stability and low heating value, natural fats and oils, which consist of triglycerides and fatty acids, are difficult to use directly [3]. Thus, converting triglyceride into ready-to-use fatty alcohols or long-chain alkanes, major components of diesel fuel, with a flexible process should be a good choice. Removing the oxygen in triglyceride to produce liquid alkanes generally involved a HDO process [4]. Currently, two approaches were adopted for the production of alkanes via HDO. One is the application of early-reported sulfide CoMo and NiMo catalysts, but suffered from sulfur contamination towards environment as well as products [5]. The other involves sulfur-free metal catalysts. Precious metal catalysts, such as Pd, Pt, Ru and Ir [6–10], processed high hydrogenation activity at relatively lower temperature. However, the high cost and finite reserves of precious metals limited their extensive application. Earth-abundant non-precious metal catalysts, such as, Ni, Co, Cu, W, Mo and Fe, were also adopted to catalyze this type of reaction [11–17]. For examples, Ni/HBeta and Ni/ZrO2 catalysts were employed by Lercher et al. to catalyze stearic acid to n-octadecane and n-heptadecane, respectively, via two different reaction routes [18,19]. Li et al. reported that nitrogen-doped carbon-alumina hybrid supported iron catalysts (Fe-N-C@Al2O3) afforded n-octadecane with yield of 91.9% from stearic acid under 320 °C and 4 MPa H2 [13]. However, the poor H2 activation ability of those non-precious metals made they require a harsh reaction condition to achieve a comparable activity with precious metal catalysts. Moreover, HDO processes consume large amounts of fossil-derived H2 (at least an ~3-4 M ratio of H2/reactant), together with high pressures (3–10 MPa). This excess high-pressure H2 is difficult and dangerous to control, often resulting in deep hydrogenation or hydrogen waste [20,21]. Therefore, seeking alternative strategies for HDO of fatty acids without precious metals as well as external H2 under mild conditions is highly desirable. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) with hydrogen donors, such as alcohols and acids, has recently emerged as a potential way for biomass upgrading [20,22–25]. In this term, Cu-based catalysts have been reported as relatively promising candidate for the conversion of lignin, while the dominant product was alcohol due to its special coordination model [26]. Since the geometric/electronic properties of Cu can be tuned by another adjacent metal (Ni, Fe, Co), the product distribution could be regulated [27–30]. Nevertheless, few works about transfer hydrogenation of fatty acids using non-precious metals were reported. For example, Cu-Ni/ZrO2 was prepared for hydrogenating oleic acid into n-heptadecane using methanol as donor under 370 °C for 5 h [31], the oleic acid conversion was up to 100% with 92.5% yield of n-heptadecane. Afterward, a CuNi2Al catalyst was developed for oleic acid into n-heptadecane at 330 °C in methanol without extraneous hydrogen, and 100% of conversion and 92.7% of yield of n-heptadecane were achieved [32]. However, there still exist some limitations of the above systems such as harsh reaction conditions (>330 °C), low catalyst stability and long reaction time, etc. Therefore, further improvement of the reaction efficiency of the CTH of fatty acids to alkanes at mild conditions with more robust catalyst is highly desired. Co catalysts showed promising performance in diversified CTH reactions. Our prior work demonstrated that, the co-existence of Coδ+ and Co0 generated under controllable reduction temperature enabled high performance for CTH of oleic acid to octadecanol [33]. Herein, incorporating Cu/Ni metals into Co catalyst enabled the deep HDO of octadecanol, thus generating n-hepadecane with high yield under much milder conditions, which is operated at much lower reaction temperature and without high-pressure H2 in comparison to previous studies (Scheme 1 ). The effects of reduction temperature, catalyst loading, reaction temperature and reaction time were also investigated. Finally, combined with various control experiments and kinetic studies, a plausible reaction route for HDO of oleic acid to n-hepadecane over Cu1Ni1/CoOx was proposed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Oleic acid (99%), stearic acid (98%), linoleic acid (95%), calendic acid (96%), stearaldehyde (95%), octadecanol (98%), n-heptadecane (99%), n-octadecane (98%), methyl stearate (98%) were purchased from TCI, Japan. Lauric acid (98%), tetradecanoic acid (97%), palmitic acid (99%), arachic acid (97%), behenic acid (98%), isopropyl stearate (95%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd., China. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (analytical pure (AR)), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (AR), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (AR), Na2CO3 (AR), NaOH (AR), isopropanol (AR), acetone (AR), methanol (AR), ethanol (AR), cyclohexane (AR) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. All the above chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation All cobalt catalysts were prepared via traditional precipitation method. Typically, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (1 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) were dissolved in 200 mL deionized (DI) water, which was marked as solution (1). A mixed solution of NaOH (0.2 mol/L) and Na2CO3 (0.1 mol/L) was marked as solution (2). Then, solution (1) and (2) were added dropwise into 100 mL DI water under vigorous stirring at 30 °C and pH = 9.5. After that, the suspension was aged at 80 °C for 1 h with stirring and another 3 h without disturbance. The solid was separated by filtration and washed thoroughly with DI water. The final sample was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 350 °C in air for 3 h. The obtained sample was reduced for 2 h in 10% H2/Ar flow at 150 °C, the resulting catalyst was named as Cu1Ni1/CoOx. Other bimetallic or monometallic catalysts were prepared by similar methods."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA on a PANalytical Empyrean 200895 diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using a 200 W monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energies for different spectrum were calibrated according to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a field emission transmission electron microscope at 200 kV (TEM, TF 20, FEI Electron Optics Company, USA). The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on FineSorb-3010 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical test, a certain amount of catalyst was pretreated at 120 °C for 60 min in an Ar flow of 20 mL/min and then cooled down to 60 °C. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 800 °C with the heating rate of 10 °C/min under 10% H2/Ar (15 mL/min). Raman spectra (Raman) were collected at room temperature from 100 to 1500 cm−1 with 532 nm argon ion laser on a LabRAM HR Evolution. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nexus FT-IR 470 spectrometer in the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. To confirm the chemical adsorption of oleic acid on catalyst surface, 60 mg of catalyst was added into 14 mL of a 0.05 M cyclohexane solution of oleic acid, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Then the solid was separated by centrifugation by washing it 4 times with cyclohexane. The residue was dried at 80 °C overnight under N2."
5,Typical experiment and product analysis,"2.4 Typical experiment and product analysis The in situ HDO of oleic acid was carried out in a 14 mL micro-batch cylindrical stainless steel high-pressure reactor (Kemao, China). In a typical run, 7 mL isopropanol, 70 mg oleic acid and 30 mg catalyst were added into the reactor. Then the reactor was sealed and heated to 240 °C for 8 h. After reaction, the reactor was quenched in cold water to quickly stop the reaction. The solid catalyst and liquid products were separated by centrifugation. The recovered catalyst was successively washed by acetone for 3 times, then dried at 80 °C for 12 h and was submitted to the next batch of reaction. The liquid was diluted with acetone and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A) with a 30 m capillary column (HP-5) using a flame ionization detector (FID). The GC detecting conditions were as follows: nitrogen was the carrier gas, the injection port temperature was 280 °C, and the detector (FID) temperature was 280 °C. The column was heated from 40 to 250 °C by 10 °C min−1. A quantitative analysis was performed using calibration curves for every compound in the mixture. All the products were confirmed by GC–MS (Agilent 5977A MSD). All data were calculated by the average of three replicate experiments. The conversion of oleic acid and yield of products were defined by equations (1) Conversion / % = n OA - n OA ′ n OA × 100 (2) Yield / % = n mole o f p r o d u c t n OA × 100 Here nOA is the initial mol of oleic acid and n’OA is the residual mol of oleic acid after reaction. n (mole of product) is the final mol of product. The in situ HDO of octadecanol was operated similarly as that of oleic acid, just replacing oleic acid with 70 mg octadecanol. Isopropanol dehydrogenation experiment: 7 mL isopropanol and 15 mg catalyst were added into the reactor. Then the reactor was sealed, purged with N2 and heated to 240 °C for 2 h. After reaction, the gas was collected and measured with a drainage method. The gas composition was confirmed as hydrogen by GC with a TCD detector. All data were calculated by the average of three replicate experiments."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural characterizations,"3.1 Structural characterizations CumNin/CoOx catalysts were prepared via co-precipitation method and reduced at 150 °C under hydrogen flow. The crystalline phases of CumNin/CoOx with different Cu/Ni ratio were detected by XRD (Fig. 1 ). CoOx was made up of Co3O4 (PDF#42-1467) and low content of metallic Co (standard card number: PDF#15-0806) phases (Fig. S1a). The pattern of Ni/CoOx (Fig. S1b) was similar as that of CoOx, while no metallic Co, Ni or NiO could be observed. Incorporating Cu into Ni/CoOx weakened the intensity of Co3O4 phase and brought out metallic Co and NiO (PDF#47-1049) phases (Fig. S1c), which was also accompanied with a newborn CuCo phase (PDF#50-1452) for CumNin/CoOx catalysts [30]. As for Cu/CoOx sample (Fig. S1d), the intensity of Co3O4 phase weakened further, indicating the main phases were metallic Co and CuCo phases. These results indicate that Cu favors the reduction of Co3O4, and in turn the newly generated Co will alloy with Cu to form CuCo phase. Raman spectra were conducted for detecting surface composition of CumNin/CoOx catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 a, Ni/CoOx showed two broad NiO peaks at 310 and 500 cm−1, no other Co species could be observed [34]. As for Cu/CoOx, CuO and Co3O4 signals were detected. Incorporating Ni into Cu/CoOx leaded to the disappearance of CuO and NiO, while Co3O4 phase was reserved. Compared with Cu/CoOx, the Co3O4 peak of Cu1Ni1/CoOx at 670 cm−1 (A1g mode) shifted to 652 cm−1, ascribing to the formation of CuCo phase on surface of Co3O4 [35]. XPS was carried out for detecting metal species on surface of catalysts. Ni was mainly existed as Ni2+ for Ni/CoOx and Cu1Ni1/CoOx catalysts (Fig. S2a). Co3+ and Co2+ were detected for Ni/CoOx, Cu1Ni1/CoOx and Cu/CoOx (Fig. S2b), while nearly no metallic Co could be observed. Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3 ) showed that both metallic Cu (excited as CuCo alloy) and Cu2+ were coexisted for Cu1Ni1/CoOx and Cu/CoOx, and the percentage of CuCo specie (71.0%) in Cu1Ni1/CoOx is higher than that of Cu/CoOx (58.7%). Surface and bulk compositions were analyzed by XPS (Tables S1 and S2) and ICP-OES, respectively. The nCu/nCo of Cu1Ni1/CoOx detected by XPS was 1.58, which was higher than that detected by ICP (0.98), indicating Cu species tended to alloy with Co and enrich on surface of catalyst. As shown in Table S3, the surface area of CoOx, Ni/CoOx, Cu1Ni1/CoOx and Cu/CoOx are 82.2, 88.5, 42.6 and 18.4 m2/g, respectively. The four samples show narrow pore size distributions centered in range of 11.6–19.2 nm (Fig. S3), thus favoring the mass diffusion during the reaction. H2-TPR profiles of calcined CoOx, Cu/CoOx, Cu4Ni1/CoOx, Cu1Ni1/CoOx, Cu1Ni4/CoOx and Ni/CoOx are shown in Fig. 4 . As for CoOx (Fig. 4a), two H2 consumption peaks were located at 279 and 350 °C. The former one (279 °C) could be attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO (Co3+ → Co2+), while the latter peak (353 °C) could be attributed to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co (Co2+ → Co0). Loading Cu on CoOx (Cu/CoOx) afforded a significant shift to low temperature at 155 and 256 °C (Fig. 4b). The former peak could be attributed the reduction of CuCoOx to CuCo alloy, since alloy oxides sometimes can be reduced more easily [32]. The later one could be ascribed to reduction of CoOx to Co. Increasing the Ni content of CumNin/CoOx weakened the peak at 155 °C (Fig. 4c–e), and another peak shifted gradually to high temperature. As for Ni/CoOx (Fig. 4f), these two peaks were located at 241 and 366 °C. These results further reveal that the newly generated CuCo alloy favors the reduction of Co and Ni species, well agreed with the XRD results (Fig. 1). The detail morphology of Cu/CoOx, Cu1Ni1/CoOx and Ni/CoOx was detected by TEM. All samples showed irregular nano-strucutre (Figs. 5 and S4). HRTEM images (Fig. 5 c) of Cu1Ni1/CoOx showed that, apart from the distinct Co3O4 (1 1 1) plane, Co(2 0 0) and NiO(2 0 0) planes with lattice spacings of 0.177 and 0.210 nm, respectively, could also be observed. Moreover, a lattice spacing of 0.206–0.207 nm could be calculated for Cu1Ni1/CoOx, which was slightly narrow than Cu (111, 0.209 nm) but wide than Co (111, 0.204 nm). According to XRD and Raman results (Figs. 1 and 2), we ascribe this lattice as CuCo(1 1 1) plane [36,37]. As for Cu/CoOx (Fig. S4d), CuCo specie could also be detected. Ni species were mainly existed as NiO in Ni/CoOx (Fig. S4b), well agreed with the Raman results (Fig. 2). Additionally, elemental mapping of Cu1Ni1/CoOx (Fig. 5d) clearly stated that the signals of Cu, Ni and Co were overlying with each other, indicating the well-proportioned distribution of Cu, Ni and Co at nanoscale."
8,In situ HDO of oleic acid with isopropanol over CumNin/CoOx catalysts,"3.2 In situ HDO of oleic acid with isopropanol over CumNin/CoOx catalysts In order to explore the influence of composition on catalytic activity of CumNin/CoOx catalysts (Table 1 ), in situ HDO of oleic acid at 240 °C using isopropanol as a hydrogen donor was conducted. All catalysts could afford >99% conversion at 240 °C for 8 h. The support (CoOx) exhibited poor HDO activity (entry 1), affording only 3.4% yield of n-heptadecane, along with which 16.2% yield of octadecanol and 62.1% yield of ester could be formed. After loading Ni, Ni/CoOx afforded >99% oleic acid conversion with 46.1% n-heptadecane yield, which was accompanied with 25.7% octadecanol yield and 18.3% ester yield (entry 2). Octadecanol and ester were known intermediates for the HDO of fatty acids [38]. The ester was probably generated by the hydrogenation of oleic acid to stearic acid followed by esterification with isopropanol [33]. However, no stearic acid was detected, indicating esterification of stearic acid occurred very fast once the double bond of oleic acid was hydrogenated. Once a small amount of Cu was added into the catalysts, the yield of n-heptadecane was increased to 64.0% for Cu1Ni4/CoOx (entry 3). As the Cu/Ni ratio increased, the yield of n-heptadecane first increased and then decreased. Cu1Ni1/CoOx showed the highest yield of n-heptadecane (81.3%) among all the catalysts (entry 4). However, the higher Cu content (Cu4Ni1/CoOx, entry 5) did not mean the higher yield of n-heptadecane. As for Cu/CoOx (entry 6), 65.6% n-heptadecane yield could be obtained. These results indicating the suitable Cu/Ni ratio is important for the in situ HDO of oleic acid, and the best catalytic activity of Cu1Ni1/CoOx could be ascribed to relatively high content of CuCo species, as revealed in XRD and XPS results (Figs. 1 and 3). In order to figure out the role of each component for HDO of oleic acid, several control experiments were carried out. When using Cu1Ni1 as catalyst (entry 7), only 1.6% n-heptadecane yield could be observed. Employing a physical mixture of Cu1Ni1 and CoOx as catalyst could still afford a nice yield of n-heptadecane (entry 8, 55.9%). Compared with the separated Ni/CoOx and Cu/CoOx, physically mixing them together would further increase the yield of n-heptadecane to 73.7% (entry 9). These results imply that, apart from the synergistic effect between Cu (Ni) and CoOx, another secondary synergistic effect between Cu and Ni should be indispensable [32]. With respect to the in situ HDO of oleic acid without external hydrogen, isopropanol dehydrogenation would affect the rate of oleic acid hydrogenation. Thus, isopropanol dehydrogenation over different catalysts was evaluated in Fig. 6 a. Single Cu or Ni catalysts afforded nearly zero H2 production. While CoOx and Cu1Ni1 catalysts showed moderate hydrogen evolution ability (~20 mmol/g), suggesting the synergistic effect between Cu and Ni. Incorporating Cu or Ni into CoOx remarkably boosted their H2 production ability, and the highest value could be achieved for Cu1Ni1/CoOx (87.3 mmol/g), suggesting another synergistic effect between Cu or Ni and CoOx. Based on XRD and XPS results, adding a certain content of Ni facilitate the generation of CoCu species, which are easily reduced and could be located at the interface between CoOx and Cu. It is reported that CoCu species are highly active than that of single Cu or Co for dehydrogenation of ethanol [30], and a part of free H achieved from isopropanol dehydrogenation might be directly used for oleic acid hydrogenation before H2 formation. Meanwhile, this type of synergistic effect was also existed in HDO of octadecanol to n-heptadecane (Fig. 6b). For example, Cu1Ni1/CoOx still exhibited maximized n-heptadecane yield (88.2%) compared with other controlled catalysts. It seems that, the interaction between Cu or Ni and CoOx surpassed the interaction between Cu and Ni, indicating the indispensable role of CoOx. Whereas, loading Cu and Ni over CoOx simultaneously further favored the catalyst performance, which could be ascribed to that Ni might facilitate the generation of CoCu species as referred before. The similar catalytic trends between isopropanol dehydrogenation and oleic acid HDO over different catalysts indicated that, ternary synergistic effect between Cu, Ni and CoOx played an important role in isopropanol dehydrogenation, thus facilitating the subsequent HDO of intermediates to form n-heptadecane. The substrate adsorption over catalyst is an essential prerequisite for effective HDO of oleic acid. To check for the interaction, catalysts were treated with oleic acid and detected by FTIR (Fig. 7 ). The characteristic peaks at 2920, 2852, and 1465 cm−1 correspond to asymmetric stretching vibration of C–H in –CH2−, symmetric stretching vibration of C–H in –CH2−, and deformation vibration of C–H of alkyl chain in oleic acid, respectively [13]. These peaks also exist in the FT-IR spectra of all treated catalysts upon oleic acid adsorption, confirming its adsorption onto the catalysts. The characteristic peak of carboxyl group in oleic acid at 1712 cm−1 could be observed for CoOx and Ni/CoOx catalysts, while this peak is almost missing in the FTIR spectra of Cu1Ni1/CoOx and Cu/CoOx, and instead, a weak new peak at 1575 cm−1, which could be assigned to the formation of carboxylate, is observed. The carboxylate is a key intermediate in the reduction of acid to aldehyde during HDO of oleic acid [6]. These results indicate that, incorporating Cu also facilitate the formation of carboxylate upon the adsorption of oleic acid, which will promote the hydrogenation of carboxy group over Cu1Ni1/CoOx. With Cu1Ni1/CoOx in hand, the effect of reduction temperature towards catalyst performance was studied (Fig. 8 ). Unreduced Cu1Ni1/CoOx afforded 39.5% octadecanol yield and 42.4% n-heptadecane yield. Reducing catalyst at 150 °C showed the highest n-heptadecane yield (81.3%). However, the n-heptadecane yield dropped remarkably to 1.0% when raising the reduction temperature to 450 °C. XRD patterns of different temperature reduced Cu1Ni1/CoOx were shown in Fig. S5. No metallic Co diffraction peaks could be found for unreduced catalyst. Increasing reduction temperature weakened the Co3O4 peaks but strengthened the metallic Co peaks. These results indicate that the synergy of M0 and Mδ+ is crucial to boost the activity of Cu1Ni1/CoOx [33,39]. With Cu1Ni1/CoOx as the optimized catalyst, methanol, ethanol and hydrogen were also used as hydrogen donors (Fig. 9 ). Since all donors could achieve >99% conversion of oleic acid, the product distribution was various. Methanol afforded esters as the main products, no alkanes could be detected. As for ethanol, except for 88.1% ester yield and 6.3% octadecanol yield, no other product could be observed. When adopting commonly used molecular hydrogen for HDO of oleic acid, the n-heptadecane yield was only 23.8%, which was accompanied with 33.1% n-octadecane and 22.0% cracking products (C14–C16). These results demonstrate that, employing Cu1Ni1/CoOx as catalyst, isopropanol was the best hydrogen donor for generating n-heptadecane. The Cu1Ni1 loading was optimized to be 30% with a 91.3% n-heptadecane yield when Cu1Ni1 loading was changed from 0 to 50% at 240 °C (Fig. 10 a). After the optimum Cu1Ni1 loading was selected, an increase of catalyst amount from 0 to 30 mg boosted the n-heptadecane yield from 0 to 91.3% (Fig. 10b), and excess usage of catalyst afforded no significant enhancement of product. Compared with relative works shown in Table 2 , Cu1Ni1/CoOx showed good catalytic activity and n-heptadecane yield at relatively milder conditions. Reaction temperature also plays a key role on HDO activity of Cu1Ni1/CoOx catalyst (Fig. 11 ). >99% conversion of oleic acid could be achieved within 0.5 h when reaction temperature is in range of 200–240 °C. When reaction was carried out at 200 °C (Fig. 11a), the main intermediates were stearic acid (39.1%) and octadecanol (41.8%) at 1 h. Prolonging reaction time to 3 h leaded to fast exhaustion of stearic acid, and the octadecanol yield reached to the highest value (89.0%) at 4 h. When further prolonging reaction time, octadecanol was converted slowly to n-heptadecane, and 59.7% n-heptadecane yield could be obtained at 24 h. In the whole range of time, a small amount of esters (3.5%) and n-octadecane (<0.8%) were detected, and their concentrations kept almost constant. When reaction temperature was raised to 220 °C (Fig. 11b), no stearic acid could be observed in the initial stage, the formation rate of n-heptadecane accelerated significantly and 91.2% n-heptadecane yield could be obtained at 24 h. When reaction temperature was further raised to 240 °C (Fig. 11c), the formation rate of n-heptadecane accelerated further, and the highest yield of n-heptadecane (91.3%) was achieved at 8 h, which was accompanied with 6.5% yield of esters and 1.8% yield of n-octadecane. Evolution of products mentioned above demonstrated that, hydrogenation of oleic acid or its down-stream intermediates to octadecanol at 240 °C were fast steps. During these tandem processes, trace stearaldehyde was detected at the initial stage (Fig. S6), revealing stearaldehyde was probably produced by the CC reduction of oleic acid followed by further hydrogenation of –COOH. n-Octadecane was a trace product in whole time range regardless of reaction temperature, indicating the dehydration/hydrogenation of octadecanol to n-octadecane was remarkably restrained over Cu1Ni1/CoOx. The constant consumption of n-octadecanol as well as gradually formed n-heptadecane indicate that octadecanol could reach an equilibrium with stearaldehyde [45], which was followed by fast decarbonylation to n-heptadecane. The gaseous phase (Fig. S7) consisted of H2, CO, and CO2. The presence of CO2 was probably due to the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction (water was generated by the HDO of oleic acid) [46]. Along with the low concentration of stearaldehyde and slow rate of n-heptadecane formation, we speculate the rate determining step of HDO of oleic acid relies on dehydrogenation of octadecanol to stearaldehyde. Thus, a possible reaction route for HDO of oleic acid with isopropanol was demonstrated in Fig. 12 . Considering octadecanol consumption is the rate determining step of the whole reaction, the time courses of octadecanol conversion at different temperature was conducted. As shown in Fig. 13 a, the reaction temperature demonstrated a remarkable effect on the catalytic performance of Cu1Ni1/CoOx from 200 to 240 °C. Since the content of catalyst was fixed and hydrogen donor was in great excess, we hypothesize that the reaction was a first-order reaction as a function of octadecanol concentration. It is obvious that ln(c0/ct) followed a linear relationship with reaction time at low octadecanol conversion (Fig. 13b). By calculating the corresponding slope of the plots, the reaction rate constants (k) were calculated to be 0.0735, 0.1817 and 0.4512 h−1 for the reaction temperatures of 200, 220 and 240 °C, respectively. On the basis of the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 13c, the apparent activation energy (Ea) was determined to be 91.52 kJ/mol for Cu1Ni1/CoOx, which is much lower than that of Ni1/CoOx (112.45 kJ/mol, Fig. S8). Meanwhile, Cu1Ni1/CoOx is also suitable for scale-up of HDO of oleic acid and affords 76.9% yield of octadecanol (Table S4). Catalyst recycling is a very important issue for potential industrial application. Cu1Ni1/CoOx could be recycled by magnetic recovery, after simple wash with isopropanol, next cycling could be carried out directly without another reduction. It was found that nearly no deactivation could be observed for Cu1Ni1/CoOx after five times reuse (Fig. 14 ), showing much higher catalyst performance than Ni/CoOx (Fig. S9). XRD pattern of recycled Cu1Ni1/CoOx (Fig. S10) showed that, although most NiO and Co3O4 were converted into corresponding metallic states, CuCo phase was well reserved in catalyst, well agreed with the TEM images (Fig. S11). XPS spectra (Fig. S12) indicate that, oxidized Ni and Co were partially reduced, and more CuCo species were detected in reused catalyst. In order to demonstrate the versatility of Cu1Ni1/CoOx catalyst, HDO of various fatty acids was performed at 240 °C for 8 h (Table 3 ). No matter short or long alkane chain of fatty acids, Cu1Ni1/CoOx could afford >99% conversion as well as 88–92% yields of alkane with less one carbon number. For unsaturated fatty acids which have one, two or three CC bonds, >90% alkane (Cn-1H2n) yields could be also obtained, showing wide applicability of Cu1Ni1/CoOx catalyst for HDO of fatty acids to alkanes under relatively mild conditions."
9,Conclusion,"We have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize CumNin/CoOx by via simple co-precipitation method, followed by mild reduction with hydrogen flow under 150 °C. The as-obtained Cu1Ni1/CoOx was an efficient catalyst for HDO of oleic acid using isopropanol as hydrogen donor. Selectivity towards n-heptadecane was higher than 90% at >99% conversion under 240 °C for 8 h. Furthermore, Cu1Ni1/CoOx was highly stable under the reaction conditions and could be recycled several times without loss of activity. Control experiments showed that, incorporating Cu into CoOx allowed tuning the forming of CuCo alloy that favoring dehydrogenation of isopropanol as well as adsorption towards carboxyl of oleic acid. Kinetic studies indicated that, HDO of oleic acid to alkane mainly proceeded via the decarbonylation of stearaldehyde rather than direct decarboxylation of stearic acid. This catalyst was versatile for broad HDO of various fatty acids to corresponding alkanes with less one carbon number, thus appearing to have potential for applications in industry."
