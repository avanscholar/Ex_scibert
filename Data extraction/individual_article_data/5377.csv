0,Introduction,"Chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes into α,β-unsaturated alcohol is of special interest for the chemical industry, since the unsaturated alcohols are widely used as fragrances and drugs [1,2]. However, the design of highly efficient catalyst system remains challenging because the hydrogenation of CC bond is both thermodynamically and kinetically preferred compared to that of CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehyde molecule [3,4]. Heterogeneous metal supported catalysts are commonly employed for this reaction. In these catalysts, monometals such as Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir, Au and Ag are usually selected, with oxides such as alumina, silica, zinc oxide and carbon as supports [5]. Bimetallic catalysts have also been employed and have been very selective to the hydrogenation of CO bond. For example, Rh–Cu/SiO2 catalysts show relative high selectivity to crotyl alcohol (62%) [6]. There are still challenges for the current catalyst systems despite great efforts have been paid. First of all, severe deactivation of catalysts during reaction was frequently observed. Pt catalysts, for example, lost about 80% of initial activity after 5h reaction for vapor-phase crotonaldehyde selective hydrogenation [7–9]. Similarly, Au-based [10,11] and Ir-based [12,13] catalysts also suffered severe deactivation. Besides, it seems that the conversion of crotonaldehyde and the selectivity to crotyl alcohol has a trade-off relationship during the reaction. Yoshitake et al. [10] found that Au catalyst supported on TiO2 showed high selectivity to crotyl alcohol (82%) at the conversion of 6.9%. While the conversion was improved to 25% by increasing the H2/crotonaldehyde ratio, the selectivity decreased to 68%. In our previous studies, Ru/ZnO with different Ru contents [14] and bimetallic Ru–Ir/ZnO [15] catalysts were used for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. For the Ru/ZnO catalysts, it was found that the catalytic behaviors depended on the Ru contents in the catalyst, with a 3Ru/ZnO possessing the highest selectivity to crotyl alcohol (up to 88%). Compared to the monometallic Ru/ZnO catalysts, the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts showed much improved performance. The addition of Ir could effectively promote the catalytic properties, especially the stability of the catalyst although the deactivation of catalysts still existed. A Ru-0.5Ir/ZnO catalyst showed the highest activity (a conversion of 63.3%) and the highest selectivity to crotyl alcohol (94.4%) after 30h reaction. The enhanced stability could be attributed to the adjusted electronic property of Ru and Ir species by the formation of RuIr alloy as well as the weakened surface acidity compared to the Ru/ZnO catalyst. Since the catalysts used for this selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde are usually subject to a reduction procedure before reaction, the reduction temperature could exert significant effect on the resulting catalytic performance because the chemical/physical nature of the catalyst could be altered upon the treatment, and it has been very intensively investigated. Our early work [16] discussed the effect of reduction temperature on the reactivities and selectivities of Ir/TiO2 catalysts for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. It was found that the catalyst reduced at appropriate temperature (300°C) showed highest activity and selectivity, which was due to moderate interaction between the CO bond and the Ir species, and weakened surface Lewis acid sites. Also, it was found that with increasing reduction temperature of the Pt/ZnO catalyst [5,17] the catalytic activity decreased and simultaneously the selectivity to crotyl alcohol increased, which were correlated with the alloy formation and the migration of reducible oxide onto the metal surface. In the current work, further investigation of reduction temperature was conducted on the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalyst. It was revealed that chemical properties of the catalyst could be properly tuned during the reduction process, which consequently changed the catalytic behavior."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The support ZnO with a surface area of 11m2 g−1 was obtained by a homogeneous precipitation method. In a typical procedure, a 0.2M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 was drop wise added into the 0.2M aqueous solution of Zn (NO3)2·6H2O at 60°C in water bath until precipitation was completed. Then, the precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water, dried at 120°C for 12h and calcined in air at 450°C for 2h to obtain the support ZnO. A Ru–Ir/ZnO catalyst with a nominal Ru content of 3wt.%, and a Ir/Ru molar ratio of 0.5 was prepared by impregnating the ZnO with aqueous solution of RuCl3 and H2IrCl6 for 12h, followed by drying at 90°C overnight and calcination in air at 400°C for 2h. For comparison, supported Ru/ZnO and Ir/ZnO catalysts with nominal metal contents (Ru and Ir) of 3wt.% were also prepared in a similar manner. The obtained sample was separated into several shares and reduced at different temperatures (150, 200, 300 and 400°C) in ultra-pure H2 and denoted as Ru–Ir/ZnO-X, Ru/ZnO-X and Ir/ZnO-X, where X refers to the reduction temperature."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer with Cu Kα radiation (40kV, 40mA). Specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the modified BET method from the N2 sorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195.7°C) on a NOVA 40000e Surface Area & Pore Size Analyzer. Elemental compositions of the reduced catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis on an ARLADVANT’X Intelli Power 4200 scanning X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a JEM-2100F microscopy with a field emissive gun, operated at 200kV and with a point resolution of 0.24nm. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a VGESCALAB MK-2 spectrometer with Kα radiation (1486.6eV), with a voltage of 12.5kV and a power of 250W. The adventitious C 1s line at 284.6eV was used as an internal standard. The deconvolution of the spectra was conducted using XPSPEAK software. The background was treated using the Shirley mode. The ratios of FWHM of metals with different oxidation states were set as Ir n+/Ir0 =1.22 and Ru n+/Ru0 =1.18. The acidity of the catalysts was determined by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The experiments were conducted on a home-made NH3-TPD apparatus. 50mg of catalyst was filled in a quartz tubular reactor (i.d.=6mm) prior to the measurement, and was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture at different temperatures for 1h and then it was cooled down to 50°C. A flow of NH3 was introduced for 30min, afterwards, the gaseous or physical adsorbed NH3 was removed by purging Ar flow at 100°C for 90min. Then the sample was heated to 700°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously via a TCD detector. The total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid solution which was then back-titrated with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom-cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of CO chemisorption on the samples were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a DRIFTS (Harrick, CHC-CHA-3). Prior to the measurement, the sample was in situ reduced in a H2–Ar mixture (20mlmin−1, 10vol% H2) at different temperatures for 1h. After that, the sample was cooled down to 30°C and a ﬂow of Ar (30mlmin−1) was fed to remove the residual H2. Then the sample was exposed to CO–Ar mixture (30mlmin−1, 1vol% CO) for 30min. Finally, the sample was purged by Ar for another 30min and the spectra were recorded. In all cases the spectra were taken at 30°C, with a resolution of 4cm−1 and cumulative 32 scans. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw RM1000 confocal microprobe under ambient conditions. The excitation wavelength of laser was 514nm. The power of each laser was kept at about 3mW to prevent local heating effect and the resolution of the spectrometer was 1cm−1 with the diameter of the analyzed spot being ca. 1μm. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurement was carried out in a quartz microreactor with 6mm inner diameter. 50mg of the used catalyst was placed in the middle of reactor and heated in an O2 flow (20mlmin−1) from r.t. to 600°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The outlet gas was analyzed on-line by mass spectrometry (Qic-20 Benchtop, Hiden Analytical). The mass numbers of 44 and 18 were selected to monitor the desorption of CO2 and H2O, respectively."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test Vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed in a fixed bed quartz tube (8mm i.d.) reactor at atmospheric pressure. About 400mg of the catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before the catalytic performance test, the catalyst was reduced at different temperatures for 1h in ultra-pure H2 flow (99.999%, 20mlmin−1) and then it was cooled down to 80°C. Liquid crotonaldehyde was placed in a trap set maintained at 0°C before to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1062Pa), then crotonaldehyde gas at constant partial pressure was carried over the catalyst by hydrogen flow (26mlmin−1). The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical properties of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts,"3.1 Physical properties of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts Table 1 lists the specific surface areas and element contents of the reduced Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts. It can be seen that the specific surface areas (8.3–9.2m2 g−1) of the catalysts are slightly less than that (11.0m2 g−1) of the ZnO support. The contents of Ru and Ir in the catalysts are very close and slightly lower than the nominal values. Chlorine is found in all the samples, which suggests that the reduction pretreatment could not completely remove the Cl species in the catalyst though its content declines with rising reduction temperature. XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts (Fig. 1 ) reveal that diffraction peaks attributed to ZnO are dominant in all the catalysts. With increasing reduction temperature, a weak diffraction peak (2θ =44.0°) due to metallic Ru0 and a shoulder peak at 43.7° due to RuIr alloy [JCPS 65-5982, RuIr(101) at 43.7°] are detected, and the intensities of two peaks become stronger at higher reduction temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that increasing reduction temperature leads to aggregation of the Ru particles and form RuIr alloy. The formation of Ru–Ir alloy is also verified by comparing the pattern of Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 (curve i) with that of the Ru/ZnO-400 (curve e). The Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 shows overlapped peaks at 43.7 and 44.0°, while the Ru/ZnO-400 only shows a weak peak at 44.0°. TEM images of the reduced catalysts (Fig. 2 ) indicate that the metal particles are highly dispersed and the metal particle sizes slightly increase with reduction temperature, mainly in size of 3–5nm after being reduced at 400°C. Also, aggregation of metal particles is observed upon high reduction temperature, suggesting the growth of metal particles."
7,XPS analysis of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts,"3.2 XPS analysis of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts The XPS spectra of the Ir 4f and Ru 3d levels for the reduced Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The binging energy for the most intense Ir 4f7/2 and Ir 4f5/2 levels at 60.1–60.9eV and 63.1–63.9eV are attributed to Ir0, and at 61.3–62.3eV and 64.3–65.3eV to electron deficient iridium species (Ir n+) [18,19]. The peak at about 285.0eV in the spectra of the Ru 3d levels can be assigned to C 1s peak. Since the peaks of Ru 3d3/2 overlay the peaks of C 1s, only the Ru 3d5/2 peaks are employed in the following discussion. The peaks of Ru 3d5/2 centered at 280.1–279.7eV and 281.8–282.2eV are attributed to Ru0 and electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+), respectively [18]. The analysis of XPS results of the reduced Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts (binding energies of the Ir 4f7/2, C 1s and Ru 3d5/2 levels, the ratio of M0/M n+ (M=Ir, Ru) and FWHM values of each metal species) are summarized in Table 2 . These results suggest that even after reduction at high temperatures for 1h, the catalysts still contain partially oxidized Ru n+ and Ir n+. However, according to the surface analysis, it is found that high reduction temperature is beneficial to the formation of metallic species (Ir0 and Ru0), as the ratio of M0/M n+ (M=Ir, Ru) increases with reduction temperature. In addition, a shift toward lower binding energies of the peaks of Ir and Ru species is observed with increasing reduction temperature, which can be attributed to the increase in the electron density of the metallic M due to gradual formation of M0 at elevated reduction temperature [16,20]. Concerning the surface Ru/Zn ratio, it remains almost constant (about 4×10−3) regardless of the reduction temperature. This constant Ru/Zn ratio implies that reduction process merely changes the surface structure of the catalyst, but for Pt/ZnO catalysts, decoration of Pt by Zn was observed in previous works [5,17]."
8,Surface acidity of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts,"3.3 Surface acidity of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts Fig. 4 displays the NH3-TPD profiles of the reduced Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts, as well as the calculated amount of the surface acid sites. The weak desorption peak (425°C) for ZnO support indicates limited surface acid sites. For the Ru–Ir/ZnO samples, the profiles exhibit strong desorption peaks at around 255°C (α) and 370°C (β), indicating the existence of Lewis acid sites generated by the residual chlorine and/or the presence of oxidized metal species on the catalyst surface [7,16]. With increasing reduction temperature, the α and β peaks generally shift to lower temperatures, suggesting decreasing strength of surface acid sites. Also, the amount of surface acid sites decreases with ascending reduction temperature, which could be interpreted by declining chlorine content in the catalyst, as confirmed by the element analysis in Table 1. In addition, XPS results clearly show that the content of oxidized metal species declines with the reduction temperature, which is another reason of the decreasing amount of surface acid sites."
9,Selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde,"3.4 Selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde Fig. 5 shows the catalytic performance of the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalyst reduced at 200°C as a function of reaction time. The products include crotyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of carbonyl CO bond), butaldehyde (formed by hydrogenation of the CC bond), butyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds) and others (mainly C3 compounds formed by decarbonylation and C8 compounds formed by polymerization) [21]. The initial conversion of crotonaldehyde is very high (about 99%), however, it gradually declines with reaction time, and reaches a conversion of 63.3% after 30h. Concerning the selectivity, it is found that the main products are crotyl alcohol and butanol, and the selectivity to other products such as butaldehyde are very low (<5%). It is interesting that the selectivity to crotyl alcohol rapidly increases in the first 5h and gradually reaches a relatively stable level (about 90%) after 10h. Meanwhile, the selectivity to butyl alcohol gradually decreases, implying that these two reactions (selective hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol and complete hydrogenation to butyl alcohol) are competitive. To investigate the significant effect of the reduction temperature on the catalytic behaviors, the reactions were performed over the catalysts reduced at 150–400°C. Fig. 6 compares the crotonaldehyde conversion and the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. The catalysts reduced at lower temperature (150°C) and higher temperature (400°C) show relatively low initial activities (<80%), while those reduced at moderate temperatures (200 and 300°C) have very high initial activities (>95%). However, the crotonaldehyde conversion is found to decrease during the reaction and reach a quasi-steady-state after about 10h. Among these catalysts, the Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 possesses a conversion of 94.3% after 10h reaction while other catalysts deactivate much faster. In our previous work [15], in order to better describe the stability of catalysts, the concept of deactivation rate was introduced, which was defined as (Convinit. −Convstead)/Convinit., where Convinit. and Convstead referred to the conversions obtained after 1 and 10h, respectively. The deactivation rates of Ru–Ir/ZnO-200, Ru/ZnO-200 and Ir/ZnO-200 catalysts are 5.1, 72.6 and 78.2%, respectively, suggesting that the deactivation of the catalyst is significantly suppressed by the synergistic effect of Ru–Ir alloy. Therefore, the reduction temperature of 200°C is optimal for this system. Concerning the selectivity to crotyl alcohol, it increases gradually and then reaches a stable level more than 70%, and increasing reduction temperature causes promoted selectivity. Also, higher selectivity is obtained on the Ir promoted catalysts compared to that of the Ru/ZnO-200, suggesting the promoting role of Ir. Note that the reaction was performed at constant catalyst weight (0.4g) and the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts contain a total metal content of 6wt.% (3wt.% Ru+3wt.% Ir), while the monometallic catalyst (Ru/ZnO or Ir/ZnO) contains only 3wt.% of metal. Thus, a physical mixture of 0.4g Ru/ZnO and 0.4g Ir/ZnO was used as the catalyst and tested for the reaction at constant reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, it is found that the initial conversion over this mixture is lower than that of the Ru/ZnO-200 but higher than that of the Ir/ZnO-200. More importantly, the mixed catalyst deactivates quickly, again suggesting the important role of the Ru–Ir alloy. In addition, the same reaction was performed over a mixture of 0.2g Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 and 0.2g ZnO, and it is found that the mixed catalyst shows an initial conversion of 41%, which is about half of that of the 0.4g Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 (98%). These results confirm that the metals (Ru and Ir) are the active sites for the reaction while the ZnO support is inactive. Note that the metal contents and metal dispersions in these catalysts are different, comparison of turnover frequencies (TOFs) instead of overall conversions could reflect more relevant information on the intrinsic activities of the catalysts. Thus, TOF values based on the metal particle sizes were calculated and summarized in Table 3 . It can be seen that the TOFs values after 10h reaction are in the range of 0.4–2.9×10−3 s−1. These values are comparable to those reported in literature. For example, Chen et al. [16] reported TOFs of 0.3–3.8×10−3 s−1 on Ir/TiO2 catalysts. Hong et al. [22] reported TOFs of 2.1–4.1×10−3 s−1 on Ir/SiO2 catalysts. However, the TOF value on the Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst (2.9×10−3 s−1) seems higher than that on the Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 (2.5×10−3 s−1), which is probably due to some error during the calculation because an accurate calculation is difficult particularly for bimetallic system. The above results clearly show that reduction treatment is crucial for the reaction. In our previous work [16], effect of reduction temperature on the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Ir/TiO2 catalysts was discussed. In order to illustrate the catalytic behaviors of these catalysts, an adsorption model of the reactant on Ir/TiO2 catalyst was proposed. The carbonyl oxygen was suggested to interact with Lewis acid sites and the metallic Ir0 particles were the adsorption centers of CC and carbonyl carbon. A similar model could be also established in the current work, in which the carbonyl oxygen in the crotonaldehyde molecule is suggested to interact with Lewis acid sites generated by the residual chlorine ions and/or the presence of oxidized metal species on the catalyst surface, while the metallic M0 (Ir0 and Ru0) and the RuIr alloy species are the adsorption centers of CC and carbonyl carbon. It is well known that chemisorption of reactant on the catalyst surface is crucial. For the lower temperature reduced catalyst (Ru–Ir/ZnO-150), the surface acid sites (NH3-TPD results, Fig. 4) would strongly interact with the carbonyl oxygen, made the chemisorbed crotonaldehyde molecules difficult to desorb, and thus blocked the active sites and consequently suppress the activity. Interestingly, Miñambres et al. [23] reported a linear relationship between total acidity (Brønsted+Lewis) and yield to 2-butenol (crotyl alcohol) in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, indicating the surface acidity is important for the production of crotyl alcohol. Accordingly, a relation between the surface acidity and yield of crotyl alcohol was also established in the current work, as shown in Fig. 7 . It is clear that the yield of crotyl alcohol first increases with surface acidity of the catalyst (Ru–Ir/ZnO-400, Ru–Ir/ZnO-300, Ru–Ir/ZnO-200), but declines with further increasing acidity (Ru–Ir/ZnO-150). Such a relationship is not fully consistent with the findings in the previous study [23], suggesting that in the current work, the role of surface acidity might be complicated. The different observations in this work and in the previous study could be due to different catalyst systems employed, as supported noble metals (Ru–Ir) are used in the current work while oxides such as Ga/ZrO2 and Ga/TiO2 were used in reference [23]. On the other hand, for the Ru–Ir/ZnO-300 and Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 catalysts, a strong interaction between the M0 sites and the carbonyl carbon may form, which may also make the desorption of crotonaldehyde difficult. Meanwhile, the high temperature reduction may result in partial coverage of M and alloy particles by the ZnO support due to a strong metal support interaction (SMSI) [24–26]. Thus, a proper strength of chemisorption of crotonaldehyde molecule on the catalyst is desirable in order to obtain high activity. In this sense, the Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst with medium surface acidity and charge density on M0 sites may be suitable for the chemisorption and activation of the crotonaldehyde molecule, which leads to a high activity. Concerning the selectivity, it is found that high reduction temperature promotes the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. For example, the Ru–Ir/ZnO-150 has a selectivity of about 80%, while the Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 has a selectivity of about 90%. This phenomenon is also related to the changes of the nature of the catalysts, particularly the surface acidity and electronic properties of the metal species in the catalyst. The catalyst reduced at low temperature (Ru–Ir/ZnO-150) contains large amount of chlorine (2.02%), which results in strong acidity in the catalyst (Fig. 4). It was reported by Consonni et al. [17] that too large amount of chlorine at the catalyst surface would lead to the formation of chlorinated products and thus decrease the crotyl alcohol selectivity. In this sense, the catalyst reduced at high temperature (e.g. Ru–Ir/ZnO-400) contains much less chlorine and therefore helps to increase the selectivity. On the other hand, electronic property of the metal species (Ru, Ir or Ru–Ir alloy) also has significant influence on the selectivity to the desired crotyl alcohol because it may alter the interaction between the M0 (M=Ru, Ir or Ru–Ir alloy) and the carbonyl carbon. The XPS results (Fig. 3 and Table 2) clearly show that the binding energies of the Ru0 and Ir0 species shift to lower values with increasing reduction temperature, indicating an increasing electron density over these species due to the gradual reduction of the cationic species during the reduction process. This high charge density over the M0 species is beneficial to the selectivity of crotyl alcohol, as it could enhance the interaction between the charge-enriched M0 species and the charge-deficient carbonyl carbon, and meanwhile, weaken the interaction between the M0 sites and the charge-enriched CC bond. This is also an important factor that could interpret the higher selectivity to crotyl alcohol on the catalyst reduced at high temperature compared to those reduced at low temperatures."
10,Analysis of catalyst deactivation,"3.5 Analysis of catalyst deactivation As shown in Fig. 6, the deactivation of all the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts was observed, which has been frequently observed in this reaction [27–31]. It was reported that the deactivation of Pt based catalysts is due to the decarbonylation of crotonaldehyde and the strong adsorption of generated carbon monoxide on surface Pt atoms [30]. Similar deactivation was also observed over Ru based catalysts and was attributed to the CO molecules strongly adsorbed on Ru surface which poison the catalysts during the reaction [14]. It can be seen in Fig. 5, small amount of C8 and C3 hydrocarbons are produced during the reaction, indicating the occurrence of polymerization and decarbonylation reaction and the simultaneous formation of polymer and CO [21,29]. It was reported that polymer and CO molecules could be strongly absorbed on the metal surface and the active sites are blocked, which leads to a partial loss of active sites [29,32]. To explain the catalyst deactivation, Raman spectra of fresh and used Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts were measured and TPO experiment of the used Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst was conducted. From the Raman spectra (Fig. 8a), no peak is observed in the region of 800–1800cm−1 for the fresh catalysts, while a new peak at ca. 1575cm−1 appeared, which could be attributed to the carbon deposit on catalyst [33], and the intensity of the peak decreases with the increase in the reduction temperature, indicating that more carbon deposit formed during the reaction on the catalyst reduced at lower temperature. It is known that the carbon deposit is generally related to the surface acidity, as strong Lewis acid sites on the catalyst are usually prone to forming carbon deposit and therefore lead to the deactivation of catalyst for the reaction [34]. Since the NH3-TPD results (Fig. 4) show that the strength of surface acid sites decreases with increasing reduction temperature and the Raman results reveal the formation of carbon deposit, thus it could be concluded that the reduction temperature changes the properties of surface acidity of the catalyst and the carbon deposit on the catalyst could be one of the reason for the rapid deactivation of the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts. Meanwhile, it can also account for why Ru–Ir/ZnO catalyst reduced at 150°C shows suppressed performance. As for the TPO profiles of Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst (Fig. 8b), two CO2 desorption peaks are observed. The first one at 266°C can be attributed to the oxidation of CO generated from the decarbonylation of crotonaldehyde and the second one at 331°C is probably due to the oxidation of organic compounds which is further confirmed by the simultaneous formation of H2O [35]. Thus, it is quite clear that organic species exist on the catalysts, which could be another reason for the deactivation of the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts. Unfortunately, the actual amount of such organic species on the catalyst surface could not be quantitatively analyzed due to its very low content. Catalyst deactivation during hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde has been investigated in detail by Miñambres et al. [23,36]. The authors found that the catalyst deactivation was strongly dependent on the nature of the surface acidic sites, and the Lewis acidic sites were much more active but underwent much stronger deactivation than the Brønsted sites. The authors also distinguished reversible and irreversible deactivation over various catalysts. In the current work, regeneration of the spent Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst was also performed. After the TPO experiment of the spent Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst up to 400°C, the catalyst was reused for reaction under same conditions and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . It is found that the regenerated catalyst shows almost same activity as the fresh one, suggesting that the catalyst deactivation is mainly reversible and the activity could be recovered by catalyst regeneration. In order to further test whether the deactivation of the catalysts is related to the adsorption of CO on metal surface, in situ CO poisoning of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts reduced at 200 and 400°C were performed. The treatment was carried out as follows: after the reduction of Ru–Ir/ZnO catalyst at 200 or 400°C, 1.0ml CO (0.045mmol) was pulsed into the reactor at 80°C, and then the hydrogenation reaction was performed at 80°C. The injected CO (0.045mmol) is less than the surface metal atoms in the catalysts (the surface metal atoms (Ru+Ir) in the Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 and Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 are 0.075 and 0.093mmol, respectively), indicating that CO molecules would partially cover the surface atoms. Corresponding reaction results as well as the results without CO poisoning step were shown in Fig. 10 . It is obvious that the Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts show a significant drop in initial crotonaldehyde conversion after CO poisoning, especially the catalyst reduced at 400°C (from 78 to 31%). Therefore, it could be safely concluded that the poison effect of CO on the catalysts surface generated from the decarbonylation of crotonaldehyde is another possible reason for the catalyst deactivation, and it may be the main factor that Ru–Ir/ZnO-400 catalyst has lower catalytic performance with respect to the catalysts reduced at 200 and 300°C. On the other hand, the selectivity of crotyl alcohol is hardly improved for the steady state after 5h, which suggests that CO poisoning does not affect the selectivity of the target product. In addition, the fact that the CO poisoning does not affect the selectivity to the target product (crotyl alcohol) implies that the chemisorption of CO molecules may take place at some particular sites on the catalyst surface. But at present stage, no solid evidence could be provided and more detailed spectroscopic investigation should be conducted. Thus, the catalyst deactivation is mainly related to two aspects: polymerization generating carbon deposit (including polymer deposition), which was confirmed by Raman and TPO results, and decarbonylation of the reactant molecule yielding carbon monoxide, which was confirmed by TPO and CO poisoning results. These molecules are irreversibly adsorbed on the surface of metal particles and occupy the active sites, and therefore lead to the deactivation of the catalysts [31,32]."
11,Conclusion,"In this work, Ru–Ir/ZnO catalysts reduced at different reduction temperatures were investigated for selective hydrogenations of crotonaldehyde. The catalyst reduced at 200°C shows the highest activity and high selectivity of crotyl alcohol (>80% after 6h). More importantly, this catalyst (Ru–Ir/ZnO-200) is relatively stable during the reaction (up to 30h). The effect of reduction temperature on the catalytic performance seems lie in the changes of catalyst properties, particularly surface acidity and electronic nature of the metal species. The catalyst reduced at 200°C has proper surface acidity and moderate charge density of metal species, which may account for the good performance of the Ru–Ir/ZnO-200 catalyst. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation is observed, and the catalysts reduced at higher or lower temperatures show a more drastic decrease in activity; but the selectivity to crotyl alcohol is somewhat enhanced at higher temperatures. Concerning the catalyst deactivation, it could be attributed to the deposition of carbon (including organic compounds) and strong adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface generated by decarbonylation reaction."
