0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols are alcohols that have 2 or more than 2 carbons (C2+OH). Compared with methanol, higher alcohols are more value-added and can be used as gasoline fuel alternative, fuel additives and intermediates for chemicals [1]. Various types of catalysts have been reported for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from syngas, and the representatives include alkali-promoted methanol synthesis catalysts, Cu-modified Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) catalysts [2–4], Rh-based catalysts [5,6], and Mo-based catalysts [7,8]. However, the existing technology of HAS is still on small scale, mainly due to the relatively low selectivity to C2+ alcohols. HAS is a rather complicated process with many reactions involved, such as Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, higher alcohol formation and methanol synthesis. Generally, higher alcohol synthesis requires both dissociative and non-dissociative activation of CO by different active components. Hydrogenation of the dissociatively adsorbed CO gives CH x species which then propagate to form surface alkyl groups. Insertion of the associatively adsorbed CO into the surface alkyl carbon-metal bond affords surface acyl groups and alcohols are formed by further hydrogenation. In order to improve the selectivity to C2+OH, the synergism between CO insertion and carbon chain growth should be enhanced by catalyst design. Obviously, it is necessary to develop new HAS catalyst with high selectivity to C2+ alcohols. In this paper, Cu-Fe composite oxides were prepared by co-precipitation method and tested for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas in fixed bed reactor. The catalytic performance, especially product distribution was discussed in detail. The influences of Cu/Fe ratio, reaction temperature and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the catalytic performance were also studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1. Catalyst preparation Cu-Fe composite oxides denoted as Cu x Fe y , where x and y is the simplified molar ratio of Cu and Fe, were prepared by coprecipitation method using calculated sodium carbonate added dropwise into a stoichiometric mixed aqueous solution of copper nitrate and iron nitrate at 40 oC with a fierce stirring. Then the suspension mixture was aged at 70 °C for 3 h, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm with deionized water several times until the pH value of centrifugal liquid achieved 7.0. The residue was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcinated at 400 °C for 3 h in order to produce the corresponding composite oxide. The resulting sample was ground into fine powder in an agate bowl, tableted under 40 kN, and finally crashed into 40–60 mesh. The sample without copper addition (iron oxide) was also synthesized by the same method and procedure."
3,Characterization,"2.2. Characterization XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation with scanning angle (2θ) ranging of 10°–80°. The identification of sample phases was carried out by comparing the patterns with JCPDS-ICDD cards. Nitrogen adsorption was conducted at −196 °C with a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ2-MP analyzer. About 150 mg sample was degassed at 250 °C in vacuum for 3 h and then used for measurement. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface area using adsorption data in relative pressure (P/P 0) ranging from 0.04 to 0.3. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was used to calculate total pore volume and average pore diameter by adsorption data. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was carried out on a tp-5080 equipment, using H2 as reducing agent and Ar as carrier gas. 50 mg sample was placed in the center of quartz tube and reduced by 5 vol% H2/Ar with 30 mL(STP)/min total feed gas. The temperature ranged from 50 °C to 800 °C with ramping of 10 °C/min. Before TPR test, the sample was pre-treated at 200 °C (10 °C/min) for 20 min in Ar flow (28.5 mL(STP)/min) and then cooled to 50 °C. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to follow the H2 consumption as a function of temperature and the signals were recorded automatically. Water was removed by 5-A molecular sieves before the tail gas entering into TCD."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3. Catalytic performance CO hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a stainless steel continuous fixed-bed flow reactor. Prior to each reaction, the catalysts (2 mL, diluted with 2 mL inert quartz sand) were in-situ reduced at 0.2 MPa in flowing syngas (H2/CO = 2) with gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 2000 h−1. A designed temperature-programmed procedure was employed to reduce the catalysts: room temperature→120 °C in 50 min and kept at 120 °C for 30 min; 120 °C→180° C in 60 min and kept at 180° C for 30 min; 180° C→240° C in 60 min and kept at 240 °C for 120 min; 240 °C→300 °C in 60 min and kept at 300 °C for 480 min. After the reactor was cooled down to 50 °C, the pressure was raised to 6.0 MPa with the same syngas. The temperature was then increased to a given value with a ramping of 1 °C/min. The gas flow was controlled through a calibrated Brooks mass flow controller and the reaction was conducted with a GHSV of 5000 h−1. The tail gas, after passing through a hot trap (100 °C) and a cold trap of ice-water bath, was analyzed on-line by GC. H2 and CO were analyzed through a TDX-1 carbon molecular sieves column with Ar as carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). N2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were analyzed as for H2 and CO, except He was used as carrier gas. C1 to C10 hydrocarbons in tail gas were analyzed through a modified alumina packed column with Ar as carrier and hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). The aqueous products, liquid oil products and solid wax products, from hot trap and cold trap, were analyzed off-line by GC. The aqueous products were analyzed through two Porapak Q columns equipped with a TCD and FID, for H2O and MeOH and C1–C5 oxygenates analyses, respectively. The liquid oil products were analyzed through a HP-1 column with N2 as carrier and FID as detector. The solid wax products were dissolved in CS2 and analyzed through a MXT-1 column with N2 as carrier and FID. All the data were collected after 48 h on-stream under reaction conditions when a steady state was reached. The mass balance, carbon balance and oxygen balance were kept between 95% and 105%."
5,Results and Discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1. Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of calcinated Cu-Fe composite oxides with various Cu/Fe molar ratios were shown in Figure 1 . The sample of pure iron oxide displayed a well crystalline pattern of hematite (α-Fe2O3) phase (ICDD#33-0664). As the copper was introduced, the hematite peaks began to diminish. Only a trace of α-Fe2O3 phase was observed and the peaks corresponding to CuO emerged when the Cu/Fe molar ratio equaled 1.5/1. With the further increase of copper concentration, Cu-Fe composite oxides exhibit a single structure of copper oxide (ICDD#65-2309) without iron oxide due to its high dispersion as discussed by Lin [9]. Figure 2 displays the H2-TPR profiles of the Cu-Fe composite oxides with different Cu/Fe molar ratios. For the monocomponent iron oxide sample, the strong peak at about 383 °C was attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, and the second broad peak at 610 °C was ascribed to the further reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and Fe. For the Cu-Fe composite oxides, the peak characterized with shoulder in the range from 125 °C to 275 °C was due to CuO x reduction [10]. As the crystalline CuO particle size increased with the increase of Cu amount, the reduction peak corresponding to CuO x shifted to higher temperature. Due to the promoted effect of Cu [11,12], the reduction temperatures for FeO x decreased compared with monocomponent Fe sample. The peak for the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 was overlapped with the CuO x reduction peak. The peak for the further reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and Fe decreased gradually with the increase of Cu amount [13]. The N2 adsorption property of Cu-Fe catalysts with different Cu/Fe molar ratio was displayed in Table 1 . With the increase of Cu amount, there was no clear change trend for BET specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume due to many other factors which also influenced the final textural structure. The highest BET surface of sample Cu1.5Fe1 reached 136 m2/g, while the lowest one was only 16 m2/g for Cu20Fe1. The Fe sample possessed the highest pore diameter of 15.1 nm while that of Cu1.5Fe1 sample was only 3.9 nm. In addition, the Cu10Fe1 sample exhibited the highest pore volume of 0.27 mL/g while that of Cu20Fe1 sample showed the lowest pore volume of 0.08 mL/g."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2. Catalytic performance 3.2.1. Effect of Cu/Fe molar ratio The forepart of Table 2 summarizes the catalytic performance of various Cu-Fe composite oxides with different Cu/Fe ratio at 210 °C. The Cu10Fe1 sample exhibited the highest CO conversion of 29.7%. The Cu20Fe1 sample showed the lowest CO conversion of 9.0%, possibly due to its lowest specific surface area. However, though the Cu1.5Fe1 sample possessed the highest specific surface area, the CO conversion over this sample was only 23.7%. As alcohol was concerned, the pure iron oxide catalyst already possessed alcohol selectivity of 20.8 C%. In order to further improve alcohol selectivity, copper was always added in iron-based catalyst [14,15]. As shown in Table 2, the combination of Cu and Fe greatly improved alcohol formation. However, further increase of Cu amount would decrease the catalytic activity and alcohol selectivity. The total alcohol selectivity gradually rose with the Cu/Fe molar ratio till Cu/Fe molar ratio of 5/1 and then decreased to a lower point. It is noticeable that the samples of Cu5Fe1 and Cu10Fe1 have similar alcohol selectivity, 28.0 C% and 27.3 C%, respectively. However, Cu10Fe1 possessed higher CO conversion. Based on the results of CO conversion and alcohol selectivity, Cu10Fe1 exhibited the best catalytic performance among various samples studied. The detailed alcohol distribution over various catalysts was analyzed in detail. The selectivity to C2+ higher alcohols in alcohol distribution was very high, about 90% for all the samples studied. Many Cu-Fe-based HAS catalysts have been reported in open literature, however, such a high C2+OH selectivity seems rare [16–18]. It also should be noted that high molecular alcohols (C6+OH) in alcohol fraction was also very high, all above 50 wt%. Direct synthesis of C6+OH from syngas was seldom studied, and most of them were separated from biomass [19,20] or hydrogenation from biodiesel [21]. Recently, Ding et al and Liu et al reported the direct synthesis of C6+OH linear primary alcohols from syngas on active carbon supported cobalt based catalysts [22,23]. As C6+OH are intermediates for many value-added fine chemicals [24], direct production of C6+OH from syngas seems attractive. Our results suggest that the as-obtained Cu-Fe composite oxides are promising HAS catalysts, especially for C6+OH production. In hydrocarbon distribution (Table 3 ), the CH4 selectivity was always lower than 10% for all the samples studied. The Fe sample exhibited the lowest CH4 selectivity of 2.9%. With the addition of Cu, the CH4 selectivity increased in a certain extent. In addition, all the samples being studied showed high selectivity to C5+. Hydrocarbon formation can not be avoided on modified F-T catalysts during the HAS process. Obviously, a low selectivity to methane and a high selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons were desirable for improving the value of byproducts. The distribution of alcohols and hydrocarbons obeyed approximate Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution (Figure 3 ). The α values for alcohols and hydrocarbons were similar (Table 4 ), indicating both kinds of products derived from the same intermediates. In addition, the α value for alcohols was always a little lower than that of hydrocarbons. The high chain growth probability factor indicated that the Cu-Fe composite oxides possessed strong chain growth capability. The olefin/paraffin ratio in hydrocarbon product was also explored as shown in Table 3 and Figure 4 . Ethylene/ethane ratio changed drastically from 0.79 for Cu1. 5Fe1 to 3.43 for Cu20Fe1, while for higher carbon number hydrocarbons (C⩾3), the olefin/paraffin ratios were quite the same for various catalysts with different Cu/Fe molar ratio. Olefin/paraffin ratio was always higher than 1 for the products with low carbon number (C<10). With the increase of carbon number, the value of olefin/paraffin ratio decreased gradually and dropped to less than 1 around C10, because of the chain-dependent olefin secondary reaction by further hydrogenation [25]. 3.2.2. Effect of reaction temperature As mentioned above, Cu10Fe1 possessed the best overall performance based on activity and alcohol selectivity. Herein, Cu10Fe1 was chosen to study the influence of temperature on the HAS reaction property. As shown in Table 2, the CO conversion of Cu10Fe1 was over 25% at 200 °C, indicating high activity at lower temperature. The CO conversion increased with the reaction temperature and reached 54.6% at 260 °C. The total alcohol selectivity initially increased to a value of 27.3 C% at 210 °C and then decreased to a lower level of 11.3 C% with the rising of reaction temperature. CO2 selectivity increased gradually overall while the hydrocarbon selectivity vibrated around 72 C% between 200 °C and 240 °C. During the HAS process, alcohol formation, Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reaction (hydrocarbon formation) and water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction (CO2 formation) occurred in parallel and competed for carbon source [26,27]. WGS competed with alcohol formation as both reactions involve the associatively activated CO (CO*). Severe WGS at higher temperature consumed more CO* and decreased the amount of CO* for alcohol formation, thus led to decreased alcohol selectivity. Obviously, lower reaction temperature favored the synthesis of higher alcohols and it was necessary to develop HAS catalyst with high activity at low reaction temperature. Although the total alcohol selectivity decreased with the increase of reaction temperature, there was no obvious influence on the alcohol distribution. As shown in Table 2, the methanol selectivity at different temperature ranged from 7.9% to 14.6% while C6+OH selectivity was always above 42.0%. In hydrocarbon distribution (Table 3), higher temperature seemed to shift the hydrocarbon product to low carbon number in a certain extent though such trend was disturbed at some temperature points. Both alcohols and hydrocarbons distribution obeyed ASF distribution and was less influenced by the reaction temperature as shown in Figure 5 . The almost constant chain growth probabilities of both alcohol and hydrocarbon suggested that the reaction temperature would not influence the chain growth capability (Table 5 ), i.e., a high selectivity for C2+OH and C5+ would be remained at different reaction temperatures. The molar ratio of C= 2/C2 descended while those of C= 3/C3 and C= 4/C4 increased by the ascending of reaction temperature as shown in Figure 6 and Table 3. Though higher temperature would increase the secondary hydrogenation of olefins and decrease O/P ratio, surface re-construction of Cu-Fe composite oxides during catalysis process might greatly change the catalytic property and lead to higher O/P ratio for C= 3/C3 and C= 4/C4. Such structure evolution is still being investigated in our group and the results will be given in another paper. In addition, the value of olefin/paraffin ratio from C3 decreased gradually with the increase of carbon number at various temperatures due to the chain-dependent olefin secondary reaction by further hydrogenation. 3.2.3. Effect of GHSV Many reactions were concerned during HAS catalytic process [28,29], such as F-T reactions (formation of olefin and paraffin), CO insertion reaction (formation of aldehyde and alcohol), WGS reaction (formation of CO2) and second reactions of certain primary products (alcohol dehydration into olefin, hydrogenation of olefin into paraffin). It was reported that alcohol was the primary product of olefin and paraffin and there was obvious second reaction of alcohol [30]. Secondary reaction of alcohol should be hindered to further increase the alcohol selectivity. In order to clarify the reaction net, the effect of GHSV over the as-obtained Cu10Fe1 was studied. As shown in Table 6 , CO conversion decreased with the increase of GHSV. In addition, the alcohol selectivity increased while that for hydrocarbon and CO2 decreased with the increase of GHSV. The increasing extent for alcohol selectivity was almost equal to the decreasing extent for hydrocarbon selectivity, indicating that there was strong dehydration reaction of alcohol into hydrocarbon. In alcohol distribution, methanol selectivity slightly increased while C6+OH selectivity decreased with the increase of GHSV, indicating that higher GHSV hindered the formation of alcohols with higher carbon number. However, there was no visible change for hydrocarbon distribution and olefin/paraffin ratio (Table 7 ), suggesting that GHSV had little influence on hydrocarbon distribution and olefin/paraffin ratio which was different from the typical F-T catalysts. Both alcohols and hydrocarbons distribution obeyed ASF distribution at different GHSV as shown in Figure 7 . The α values for alcohols at GHSV of 6000 h−1 was the lowest (Table 8 ), coinciding with the lowest selectivity to C6+OH. As there was no visible change for hydrocarbon distribution, the chain growth probabilities of hydrocarbons remained unchanged as shown in Table 8."
8,Conclusions,"Cu-Fe composite oxides prepared by co-precipitation showed promising HAS catalytic performance with high selectivity to C2+OH and low selectivity to methane. The effects of Cu/Fe molar ratio, reaction temperature and GHSV on catalytic performance were studied in detail. The sample with a Cu/Fe molar ratio of 10/1 exhibited the best catalytic performance with high activity and high alcohol selectivity. Higher reaction temperature accelerated water-gas-shift reaction and led to lower total alcohols selectivity. Lower reaction temperature favored the synthesis of higher alcohols and it was necessary to develop HAS catalyst with high activity at low reaction temperature. GHSV showed great effect on catalytic performance and higher GHSV increased the total alcohol selectivity, indicating there existed visible dehydration reaction of alcohol into hydrocarbon. Further improvement of alcohol selectivity, suppression of CO2 formation, and reducing of hydrocarbons by adding promoters and optimizing reduction and reaction condition will update the catalytic performance over the Cu-Fe composite oxides catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas."
