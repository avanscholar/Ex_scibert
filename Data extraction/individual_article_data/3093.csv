0,Introduction,"The general trend indicates that Opec giants would invariably like to defend crude oil price in the range of US$57–60 per barrel through cuts in production. It is also a fact that domestic fuel prices in India can only be lowered in case the crude prices dropped below $50 a barrel. In the year 2005, India imported 99.41 million tons of crude or 78% of the 1127 million tons refined in the country amounting to US$43 billion. Another aspect is the huge subsidy on cooking gas and kerosene in order to facilitate its public use although at the cost of huge underrecoveries that have been accumulating through years. India ranks sixth in terms of energy demand accounting for 3.5% of global demand. The shift to hydrogen economy from the current fossil fuel-based economy needs solutions to numerous challenges with regard to production, storage, delivery, applications and innovations in the infrastructure technology, cost-effectiveness and lastly, the mass scale public awareness and acceptance."
1,Switchover to hydrogen technology,"The growing importance of hydrogen energy in India is quite evident, as the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has constituted National Hydrogen Energy Board that has members from government, industry, academia and other experts. The main objective of the Board is to frame and implement a National Hydrogen Energy Road Map and National Programme. The Road Map proposed a vision for India 2020 with Green Initiatives for Power generation (GIP) to a tune of 1000MW power generation capacity based on hydrogen energy and switchover to 1,000,000 hydrogen powered vehicles. The Road Map envisages milestones for pilot-scale reactors for hydrogen production through biological, biomass routes extendable to on-site hydrogen production using renewable sources and choice of technologies for commercial production of hydrogen. This paper presents a feasibility study on the use of agrowaste bagasse for hydrogen production."
2,Resource assessment,"Around 80 developing countries produce 1100 million tons of sugarcane per year (UN Bioenergy Primer, 2000). FAO estimates (2001) indicate that India (286 million tons) and Brazil (339 million ton/yr) are the major producers of sugarcane (http://www.fao.org./waicent/faoinfo/Economic/faodef/FDEF 05 E.HTM). The survey (2003) indicates a still higher value for annual sugarcane production ( ∼ 290 million ton/yr) (http://www.indiansugar.com) with about 4 million hectare of land devoted to sugar cultivation and 461 sugar mills in operation. Our institute is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh (northern part of India) that has the highest production of sugarcane (40%) in the country followed by the state of Maharastra in the west (16%), and Tamil Nadu (15.78%) in the south. The justification for using sugarcane-based feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production was the high productivity of sugarcane ( ∼ 67ton/ha/yr), crop needs little rainfall, a condition also prevailing in India. The sugarcane milling waste bagasse with the average turnover reaching 40Mt/year is mostly utilized as fuel in specialized boilers, domestic fuel by farmers, dumped for composting or used in minor way as a raw material for paper industry. The use of agrowaste bagasse as renewable energy source has been the target of study in many countries including India with regard to generation of exportable energy (Beeharry, 1996), combined heat and power systems (Bhatt and Rajkumar, 2001), ethanol as gasoline oxygenate (Kadam, 2002), compost-incorporated bioenergy systems (Mohee and Beeharry, 1999), bagasse-derived electricity and ethanol (Botha and Blottnitz, 2006). It is relevant as developing countries like Africa and India have planned a phase-out of lead-added gasoline in the near future (Thomas and Kwong, 2001; Kadam, 2002; Prakash et al., 1998). In India, there are initiatives in nine states for a 5% ethanol blend with gasoline and to raise it to 10% in near future (Subramanian et al., 2005). The exhaustive review by Nath and Das (2003) provides updates on hydrogen production from biomass through thermochemical gasification coupled with water gas shift, fast pyrolysis, solar gasification, syn-gas conversion, supercritical conversion and microbial conversion. In Europe, the bioenergy and biofuel targets for 2010–2030 seem feasible (Bomb et al., 2007) owing to the clearance from European Environment Agency (2005). As of today, only the bioethanol produced from sugarcane is price competitive (IEA, 2005). Of the biomass feedstocks identified, sugarcane and sugar beet can directly be converted to bioethanol through fermentation, whereas a two-step conversion technology is needed for biomass from maize, wheat, trees or grasses (Bomb et al., 2007). It is around 2005 that Germany has switched over to bioethanol production (Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe (FNR) Agency of Renewable Resources, 2005) although both bioethanol and biodiesel seem to contribute insignificantly to energy security relative to second generation biofuels and hydrogen (Mineralolwirtschaftsverband (MWV) Association of the German Petroleum Industry, 2004). Biodiesel and bioethanol were once thought to be the expensive energy options until 2003 in the UK; the aspect is now well supported by the Environmental Groups (British Government, 2005). Brazil has by now started electricity generation (6000MV) using sugarcane residues, bagasse and barbajo, the by-products of sugarcane/ethanol mills. Bagasse thus forms the vital source of primary energy (Moreira, 2000). Light acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose bagasse and its subsequent microbial conversion to bioethanol or hydrogen has been realized as an evolving technology. The availability of bagasse in sugar mills at no cost warrants no investment in infrastructure, and the low sugar content in the juice can be blended with the much larger amount of high sugar from sugarcane milling. The company 2B AG from Switzerland, as one of the foreign investors in Brazil, planned to convert bagasse and trash into ethanol, protein and fibreboard. Mauritius with the annual production of 5–5.5 million tons of sugarcane has opted for bagasse energy co-generation as it is likely to be a secure power source from the locally available renewable resource (Deepchand, 2005). It has been proposed that success on bagasse energy co-generation in Mauritius can be repeated in sugar producing countries in the African continent although their cane crushing capacity is appreciably low. The annual sugarcane production in Cuba reached 24 × 10 6 metric tons in 2004 (Alonso Pippo et al., 2006). It is suggested that a ton of bagasse (on a 50% mill wet basis) corresponds to 1.6 barrels of fuel oil on an energy basis. The current efforts for the efficient use of sugarcane agriculture residues have been the introduction of fast pyrolysis modules in the sugar mills with the anticipated surplus of 80KW h e /ton of cane in one season. The organic vapour (oxygenated product) can be effectively converted to Bio-oil (7000–8000ton) during one milling season. It is anticipated that on-site production of sugar, alcohol, Bio-oil and electricity around a sugar mill will eventually be cost-effective and profitable. China also introduced co-generation technologies at sugar factories with plenty of sugarcane bagasse available (Li et al., 2001). The CRED Team (2001) estimates indicate that annual bagasse production (21.2Mt) was amongst the 829.8Mt agricultural and forest residues. In addition, 10Mt of cane trash (tops and leaves) is traditionally burnt on the field. The Global Environment Facility has extended support towards installation of economically viable bagasse co-generation units in southern Chinese provinces, the principal sugarcane producers. The production of ethanol from hemicellulose and cellulose in bagasse seems more favourable than burning it for power generation, and installation of flexible plants to generate both sugar and fuel-ethanol is the better option (Gnansounou et al., 2005). The recent report by Demirbas and Balat (2006) also highlights the energy potential of bagasse. Authors also confirm that practice of anaerobic digestion of biomass in developing countries like China and India is almost a century old."
3,Bagasse as the raw material for fermentative hydrogen production,"A feasibility study of hydrogen production from sugarcane fermentation was performed by Tanisho’ (1996) group in Japan with the conversion efficiency of 2.4mol H 2 /mol sugar. However, the available energy in H 2 fermentation was 1/1.35 of that in ethanol fermentation that made the unit cost of hydrogen energy 1.3-fold than ethanol. Sugrarcane juice also supported H 2 production by the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas (Singh et al., 1994a). Moreover, the direct fermentation of sugarcane juice as such for H 2 production does not seem feasible, as it will be a major diversion from sugar or ethanol production. Fermentative hydrogen production from molasses is also on record (Tanisho and Ishiwata, 1994). Ren et al. (2006) reported that hydrogen yield from anaerobic fermentation of molasses (53% sugar) in a pilot-scale bioreactor reached 5.57 m 3 H 2 / m 3 /day. The estimates suggest that on dry wt. basis, for 1 kg sugar produced, the by-product molasses is 0.3kg and bagasse, 1.25kg (Botha and Blottnitz, 2006). Coming to balance estimation of available energy from sugarcane juice, fermentation yields 2.4mol H 2 from 1 mol sugar or the extrapolation indicates 20 Nm 3 H 2 from 1ton of sugarcane. The summary below highlights major characteristics of bagasse and its source (Table 1 ). The cost-analysis given below is the outcome of our observations on fermentative hydrogen production by Enterobacter aerogenes MTCC 2822 based on the extraction of residual sugar in bagasse by water or mild acid treatment (Singh et al., 2004) (Table 2 ). Two routes were followed for sugar extraction from bagasse biomass: (a) hot water treatment (10%, w/v) lasting 2h ( 110 ∘ C); the resulting extract contained ∼ 1% sucrose (w/w) while in (b) bagasse was subjected to acid hydrolysis (HCl 1N; 80 ∘ C, 2h) wherein the sugar yield increased to 2.5% (w/w). Both the extracts were used for fermentative hydrogen production by Enterobacter aerogenes. The cost (in US$) includes procurement and storage of bagasse for laboratory trials. Although petrol prices in India have escalated to US$1.08 per liter, still the expenditure on bagasse-derived hydrogen is almost half (see acid hydrolysis route). In case we wish to save the investment cost on the acid consumed, the water extraction route is the better alternative although sugar recovery is limited to 1% (w/w). This may be the reason that higher amounts of bagasse (55kg) were needed to obtain the fermentable substrate to generate H 2 ( ∼ 3N m 3 ) equivalent to 1L petrol. The relative cost of bagasse is more in the water extraction route but the inherent advantage is its complete recovery, and the spent bagasse can be reused as fuel or composting. To sum up, the areas of sugarcane production in India have rich but untapped potential for cost-effective hydrogen production."
4,Lignocellulose conversion technology,"Lignocellulosic bagasse consists of ligin, hemicellulose and cellulose wherein lignin linkage with hemicellulose and cellulose creates the impermeable barrier for the entry of solutions and enzymes (Howard et al., 2003). Among the three components, lignin is extremely recalcitrant to degradation. Alkaline and acid routes have been adopted to degrade lignocellulose. Lignin removal by weak acids results in poor cellulose hydrolysis while strong acids need extreme corrosive conditions combined with high temperature and pH; the process adds to the cost and problem of environment friendly disposal of the spent alkali or acid. Another route is the deployment of biocatalysts (microbial cells or their enzymes) for lignocellulosic bioconversions. For lignin degradation, the “white-rot” fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is the best-suited producer of lignocellulolytic enzymes (Ruggeri and Sassi, 2003). The list can also be extended to bacteria like Cellulomonas, Pseudomonas, Clostridium and the actinomycetes Thermomonospora and Microbispora. Our previous work used crude cellulase from the fungus Trichoderma viridae to degrade wheat and barley straw to the level of glucose (70% conversion), and the resulting hydrolysate feedstock could be used for hydrogen production by Rhodopseudomonsas (Singh et al., 1994b). It is tempting to suggest that biodegradation technology can be adopted at the farm and small industrial plant levels as a joint venture involving government, private funding and biologists. However, the main barrier is the high cost of enzymes to be used on a commercial scale. This can be minimized by cost-effective production of biodegrading enzymes using submerged and solid-state fermentation as the process requires low capital investment and low operating cost ideal for developing countries (Jecu, 2000). The accessibility of polysaccharides in lignocellulose for biofermentation has also been achieved through steam explosion and wet oxidation under alkaline conditions, supercritical CO 2 pretreatment, weak or strong acid hydrolysis and solvent extraction (Fan et al., 1982; Parisi, 1989; Bjerre et al., 1996; Zheng et al., 1995). Nevertheless such methods also involve high temperature that culminates in degradation products inhibitory to fermentation (Olsson and Hahn-Hägerdal, 1996). The group led by de Vrije in the Netherlands (de Vrije et al., 2002) successfully utilized woody biomass of the perennial grass Miscanthus for biofermentation to hydrogen by the thermotolerant bacterium Thermotoga elfii. There was an inverse relationship between lignin content and the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides. The extent of delignification was high by the combination of mechanical (extrusion or milling) and alkali (NaOH) treatment ( 70 ∘ C). When coupled with enzymatic hydrolysis (commercial cellulase), there was 77% delignification and glucose recovery reached 69% and 38% of the initial cellulose and hemicellulose fraction, respectively. The thermophilic fermentation in such cases, yielded 82mM H 2 over the sets supplied with normal glucose (71.1mM). The process comparison indicated low enzymatic hydrolysis of milled or extruded biomass relative to NaOH-pretreated biomass. Also, NaOH hydrolysis was more effective for the milled biomass ( ∼ 1mm or less) than the chopped one."
5,Conclusion,"The potential of H 2 for short–medium- and long-term applications has been realized to go for the adequate time frames for implementation. A case has been made that agrowaste-based hydrogen production could in the long-term be a potentially competitive process for clean energy generation. The switchover to hydrogen technologies is likely to contribute to energy security, and this may lead to hydrogen penetration into energy market place of developing countries, and so also others. With the feedstock available in plenty, the system efficiency and cost optimization are the paramount issues for developing competitive hydrogen-based systems. The proposed “hydrogen from biomass” process could be used at a variety of locations and will be versatile enough to accept a variety of agricultural residues depending on the supply and demand in each locality. The successful implementation of any system of energy generation from sugarcane milling wastes needs government subsidies and support."
