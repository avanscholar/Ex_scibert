0,Introduction,"Aramid fibers combine high strength, high modulus, low density, high temperature resistance, chemical corrosion resistance and good wear resistance, becoming one of the ideal reinforcements in high performance composites (Gonzalez et al., 2020; Sa et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2021). However, aramid application is limited by poor adhesive properties due to its smooth and chemically inert surface (Cao et al., 2013). As a result, most commercial grades of aramid fibers are generally coated with sizing agents to enhance handing and processing of the fibers and promote bonding (Varelidis et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2021). Poly-p-phenylene terephthamide (PPTA), known as para-aramid and trade name Kevlar or Twaron, is synthesized by a dry-jet wet spinning process (Yang et al., 2018). PPTA fibers has been widely applied as space and aviation, electronics, bullet- or cut-proof products, and so on (García et al., 2010; Gonzalez et al., 2020; Sa et al., 2014; Yahaya et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2021). The global consumption of PPTA in 2018 was about 80,000 tons, and the consumption in China was about 10,000 tons (Wan et al., 2019). It is predicted that the global demand for PPTA will reach 130,000 tons in 2023, and the demand in China will reach 20,000 tons in 2025. As the demand and production of PPTA increase, there will be a large number of discarded PPTA in the future. Consequently, a high value-added approach to recycle PPTA fibers has remained an enormous challenge. From the perspective of atom economy, the reclaiming of valuable monomers from waste PPTA is the most promising recycling method to realize the closed loop of PPTA industry. The recovered monomers include p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and terephthalic acid (TPA), which is priced at about 42,000 RMB/ton and 3,500 RMB/ton in the Chinese market, respectively (Wan et al., 2019). The price of TPA in the Asian market is 696 dollor/ton. Thus, it is very economical to recover monomers from waste PPTA. However, the degradation of PPTA is very difficult due to the high degree of conjugation and rigid geometry, as well as the large chain orientation and strong hydrogen bonding (Sandoz-Rosado et al., 2018). Moreover, none of the single neutral solvents can maintain the PPTA polymer in a dissolved state, which limits the use of dissolution method to recycle waste PPTA (Dewilde et al., 2018). The durability of Technora aramid fibers was investigated (Derombise et al., 2009). Derombise et al. studied the aging experiments of Technora aramid fibers in alkaline conditions (pH = 9 and pH = 11) and in deionized water for up to one and a half years. There was only slight degradation on the surface of the fibers, but there was no obvious change in mechanical properties. The tensile strength remained more than 95% of the original strength, and the tensile modulus remained the same. In order to explore the thermal stability of PPTA, the thermal degradation of PPTA is investigated. It can be found that the initial degradation temperature of PPTA is up to about 500 °C, and the thermal degradation products are CO, CO2, H2O and NOx (Bourbigot et al., 2001; Cai and Yu, 2011; Li and Huang, 1999; Liu and Yu, 2006). The poisonous gases will cause serious pollution to the environment. Therefore, the thermal degradation is not suitable for the treatment of waste PPTA. At present, chemical depolymerization of PPTA is a promising way, which has gradually attracted people’s attention. PPTA is an aromatic polyamide, and the chemical depolymerization is less studied. However, the chemical depolymerization of aliphatic polyamide, especially for nylon, has been extensively studied, which can provide some enlightenment for the degradation and recovery of PPTA. The chemical depolymerization methods of nylon mainly include hydrolysis, alcoholysis and depolymerization by means of ionic liquids (Goto et al., 2006; Iwaya et al., 2006; Kamimura et al., 2019a; Matsumoto et al., 2017). Supercritical hydrolysis is more environment-friendly (Gong et al., 2015; Ikushima et al., 2003; Shukla et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014). Goto et al. converted nylon-6 into its monomer in sub- and supercritical water (Goto et al., 2006). The total yields of ε-caprolactam and aminocaproic acid were approximately 100% at 300 °C for 60 min or at 330 °C for 30 min. Iwaya et al. investigated the influences of reaction temperature, time and water density on the depolymerization of nylon-6 in sub- and supercritical water (Iwaya et al., 2006). However, harsh conditions can provoke undesirable side reactions and generate complex mixtures. Alcoholysis is the most frequently used method for the chemical depolymerization of polyamides. For example, the nylons, including nylon-6, nylon-66 and nylon-12, were degraded in supercritical alcohols to recover monomers or high-value added chemicals (Kamimura et al., 2014; Kamimura et al., 2017; Kamimura et al., 2011; Kamimura et al., 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2017). Theoretical calculation showed that the depolymerization of nylon-6 in supercritical alcohols (methanol and isopropanol) was due to the rupture of C-N bonds by the proton transfer between amide bond and hydroxyl (Kaweetirawatt et al., 2012). It is worth noting that the depolymerization products of nylon are complex due to the harsh reaction conditions of supercritical alcohols (high temperature and high pressure). Ionic liquids can provide another recovery method for polymer depolymerization owing to their good stability, non-volatility and low flammability. (Kamimura et al., 2019b; Kamimura and Yamamoto, 2007; Kamimura and Yamamoto, 2008). They also have the ability to dissolve a variety of substances, including salts, proteins, fats, amino acids, polysaccharides and organic solvents (Siedlecka et al., 2011). The depolymerization of nylon-6 in ionic liquid at 300 °C was studied, and the yield of caprolactam reached over 80% (Kamimura et al., 2019b; Kamimura and Yamamoto, 2007; Kamimura and Yamamoto, 2008). The addition of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst can improve the depolymerization rate of polyamide, because DMAP can attack the carbonyl group and catalyze the gradual breaking of amide bonds. However, the non-volatility of ionic liquids and the nature of dissolving a large number of substances limit the separation of depolymerization products, and high temperature leads to high energy consumption (Kamimura et al., 2019b). An economical and efficient method to recover PPTA is highly desirable. High temperatures can induce the depolymerization of Kevlar, so a different method of Kevlar dissolution from those used before is employed, which allows for processing to be done at room temperature with minimal reduction of the molecular weight of aramid chains (Yang et al., 2011). In 2018, Yang et al. recovered high-performance aramid nanofibers (ANFs) from PPTA broken paper in KOH/DMSO system by controlled deprotonation using magnetic agitation at room temperature for at least 5 days (Yang et al., 2018). The dissolution rate of PPTA at low temperatures is slow, which greatly prolongs the time required for PPTA recovery. The depolymerization of PPTA into monomer in NaOH/subcritical water system was reported in 2019 (Okajima et al., 2019). The reaction was carried out at 250 °C and 4 MPa for 6 h, and the yield of monomer was about 95%. In 2021, Technora fiber was also successfully degraded in NaOH/subcritical water system at 250 °C and 4 MPa, and the yield of monomer reached more than 85% after 3 h of reaction (Okajima et al., 2021). Although subcritical water can effectively degrade PPTA, it requires high temperature and high-pressure operating environment, which is not conducive to large-scale industrial recovery of PPTA. In this work, we attempt to develop a more efficient catalytic system with low energy consumption and simple operating equipment to decompose PPTA, while the degradation products can be easily separated. We try to reclaim monomers PPD and TPA by using highly reactive alcohol as solvent and strong nucleophile reagent as catalyst, and propose the possible degradation mechanism of PPTA."

(Shanghai, China). All reagents were directly used without further purification."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The PPTA fibers were obtained from waste bulletproof vest. The surface of PPTA fibers is coated by polyacrylate adhesives which should be removed prior to the degradation of PPTA. First of all, the PPTA/polyacrylate composites were cut into pieces (about 2 mm × 1 mm). Then, about 0.60 g of PPTA/polyacrylate composites were pretreated by immersing in 10.00 g of TCM at 160 °C for 6 h. The obtained PPTA fibers were dried in the drying oven at 80 °C for 1 h. The depolymerization of PPTA was carried out in 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Typically, 0.60 g of PPTA was degraded in 5 wt% NaOH/n-butanol (0.50 g/9.50 g) system at the predetermined temperature. The pressure in the autoclave was determined to be 0.4 MPa. The molar ratio of PPTA repeating unit to NaOH was 1:5. After maintaining the temperature for a certain time, the degradation reactor was cooled to room temperature. When PPTA was not fully depolymerized, the reaction mixture contained disodium terephthalate (Na2TP) salt in solid form, residual PPTA, PPD and NaOH dissolved in the solvent. The reaction mixture was filtered to separate Na2TP and residual PPTA. Afterwards, the residual PPTA was separated by adding water to dissolve Na2TP. The residual PPTA was dried at 80 °C to constant weight and weighed to calculate the percentage degradation of PPTA according to equation (1), where m0 (g) is the initial mass of PPTA, and m1 (g) is the mass of residual PPTA. The concentrated hydrochloric acid was added into the Na2TP aqueous solution to form TPA precipitation, and the TPA was separated by filtration. The TPA was washed with distilled water, and dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The yield of TPA was calculated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The PPD and the remaining NaOH were obtained by removing the solvent in a rotatory evaporator. Since TCM is an antisolvent for NaOH, the PPD was separated from NaOH by dissolving in TCM. After evaporating the TCM, PPD was recovered in a rotatory evaporator at 30 °C for 10 min. PPD is easily oxidized in air. In order to reduce the degree of oxidation and more accurately calculate the yield of PPD, an analysis method with simple sample preparation and short analysis time is necessary. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a non-destructive analytical technique being used widely for determining the structure of molecules, has also become an analytical tool for the quantification of the molecules owing to its accuracy, specificity and selectivity (Kaur et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019). So, the yield of PPD was determined by quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. The pulse program “zg” was used to acquire proton integrals. The quantitative 1H NMR spectrum of PPD was shown in Fig. S1. The pyrazine as an internal standard was dissolved into 0.5 mL DMSO‑d 6 with product mixture. The mass of PPD was calculated according to the following equation (2) (Ma et al., 2019), where m(x) and m(std) are the masses in g, MW(x) and MW(std) are the molecular masses in g/mol, P(x) and P(std) are the purities, nH(x) and nH(std) are the number of protons generating the selected signals for integration, I(x) and I(std) are the integrals for the selected peaks of the analyte and the internal standard. Afterwards, the yield of PPD was calculated according to the equation (3), where m2 (g) is the mass of the analyte used for testing, m3 (g) is the total mass of the separated analyte, and m4 (g) is the theoretical mass of the analyte. The PPTA repeat unit is -NH-C6H4-NH-CO-C6H4-CO-, which has a molecular weight of 238.26 g/mol. This experimental process is shown in Fig. 1 . (1) Percentage degradation ( % ) = m 0 - m 1 m 0 × 100 (2) m ( x ) = P ( s t d ) × MW ( x ) MW ( s t d ) × nH ( s t d ) nH ( x ) × m ( s t d ) P ( x ) × I ( x ) I ( s t d ) (3) Y x ( % ) = m ( x ) m 2 × m 3 / m 4 × 100"
4,Characterization analysis,"2.3 Characterization analysis The samples were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental analysis (EA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP). To characterize the chemical structure of the PPD and TPA, 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra were monitored by an AVANCE III 400 (Bruker, Switzerland) spectrometer (9.39 T) equipped with auto sampler (400.13 MHz for 1H, 100.61 MHz for 13C) using CDCl3 or DMSO‑d 6, respectively. To explore the changes of functional groups, ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on a NICOLET iS10 (Thermo Scientific, the United States of America) spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 wavenumber. SEM (JSM-7001F, JEOL, Japan), with an operating voltage of 1.00 kV, was used for morphology analyses. Before the SEM analyses, the samples were coated with a thin gold film. The content of Na+ in the samples was determined by ICP (iCAP 7000 Series, Thermo Scientific, the United States of America). The elemental content (C, H, O, N) in the samples was determined by EA (Vario EL CUBE, Thermo Scientific, the United States of America). The surface area, pore volume and average pore size were calculated by using the BET (Tristar Ⅱ 3020, Micromeritics, the United States of America). The wetting properties of n-alcohols on PPTA monofilament were investigated by dynamic contact angle measuring instrument (K100, KRÜSS, Germany). The solvents were evaporated in a rotatory evaporator (RE52CS-1, Shanghai Yarong Biochemical Instrument, China). The yield of TPA was calculated by HPLC (LC-20AT, Shimazu, Japan). The analysis was carried out using an Shimazu Inertsil ODS-SP column (5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) and monitored at 240 nm by using a UV detector. The column temperature was 40 °C and the injection volume was 2 µl. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and 0.1% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (6:4 v/v), and had a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Chemical degradation of PPTA,"3.1 Chemical degradation of PPTA 3.1.1 Selection and optimization of catalytic system PPTA is composed of alternating benzene rings and amide bonds. Owing to the stable structure of benzene ring, the key point of depolymerization of PPTA is the selective cleavage of amide bonds. Therefore, the selection of catalytic system, including the selection and combination of catalyst and solvent, is crucial. According to the literatures reported, the depolymerization of nylons (Kamimura et al., 2014; Kamimura et al., 2011; Kamimura et al., 2008) was performed in alcohols. As a result, the methanol with high reactivity was firstly selected as the solvent for the degradation of PPTA (Table 1 , Entry 1–10). Compared with the catalytic property of organic sulfonic acid, Lewis acid catalysts and weak base catalysts, strong Brönsted base catalysts exhibit better catalytic ability for the degradation of PPTA. The NaOH has the highest catalytic activity among the Brönsted base catalysts. Interestingly, Ca(OH)2 has little catalytic effect on the degradation of PPTA, which may be due to the poor solubility of Ca(OH)2 in methanol. The percentage degradation of PPTA is 99.3% using NaOH as catalyst. Based on previous research (Wang et al., 2015), the Lewis acid/organic carboxylic acid system can selectively cleave the C-N bonds of epoxy resin, and the carbon skeleton can be preserved in above system. Therefore, the synergistic catalysis of Lewis acid/acetic acid system was also explored on the degradation of PPTA (Table 1, Entry 11–14), whereas the degradation effect of PPTA in Lewis acid/acetic acid system is poor. In addition, we also studied the degradation effect of PPTA in the 10 wt% NaOH/water system at 180 °C for 12 h (Table 1, Entry 15). The percentage degradation of PPTA was found to be only 32.3%, which is much lower than that in NaOH/subcritical water system (Okajima et al., 2019). In the follow-up experiment, the effect of alcohol solvents on the degradation of PPTA was investigated utilizing NaOH as catalyst. It is worth mentioning that 1 mol of repeating unit of PPTA consumes 2 mol of NaOH. In order to completely degrade PPTA, the mole ratio of repeating unit of PPTA and NaOH is 1:5 (Okajima et al., 2019). The effect of different alcohols on the depolymerization of PPTA was investigated in the presence of 5 wt% NaOH catalyst (Fig. 2 ). As far as the n-alcohols are concerned, the degradation rate of PPTA increases along with the increase of the carbon chain length of n-alcohols within a certain range. The degradation rate reaches the maximum when n-butanol is used as solvent, and the complete degradation only takes 6 h. When the carbon chain length of n-alcohols continues to increase, the degradation rate decreases. For example, when n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol or n-octanol is used as solvents, it takes at least 10 h to fully degrade PPTA. The above results indicate that the carbon chain length of n-alcohols has large impact on the depolymerization of PPTA. Based on the discussion above, the NaOH/n-butanol system was used in further experiments on depolymerization of PPTA. As seen from Table 1, the percentage degradation of PPTA is 99.3% in 10 wt% NaOH/methanol system. However, the percentage degradation of PPTA drops to 46.2% in 5 wt% NaOH/methanol system (Fig. 2). It was observed that the mass fraction of catalyst plays a crucial role for the degradation of PPTA. Therefore, the effect of mass fraction of NaOH on PPTA degradation was investigated (Fig. 3 a). When the mass fraction of NaOH increases from 3 wt% to 5 wt%, the complete degradation time of PPTA decreases from 12 h to 6 h. However, further increasing the mass fraction of NaOH prolongs the time of complete degradation of PPTA. We speculates that the insoluble NaOH deposits on the surface of PPTA to form an inorganic film which prevents OH– from contacting the amide bonds of unreacted PPTA (Ügdüler et al., 2020). Besides, the effect of reaction temperature on the degradation of PPTA was also investigated (Fig. 3b). At higher temperature the depolymerization proceeds faster. The complete depolymerization of PPTA needs 12 h at 170 °C, however, it takes 6 h to completely degrade PPTA at 180 °C. The higher temperature can darken the color of the solution and lead to formation of by-products. Therefore, the degradation temperature selected should be as low as possible. Finally, the optimal reaction temperature is determined to be 180 °C. Under the optimal conditions (5 wt% NaOH in n-butanol system, 180 °C, 6 h), the yields of TPA and PPD are 92.0% and 91.5%, respectively (Table S1). 3.1.2 Analysis of degradation products A layer of polyacrylate adhesives covering the surfaces of original PPTA fibers are removed during the pretreatment process, which is confirmed by ATR-FTIR (Fig. S2). The C=O stretching vibration (1732 cm−1) and C-O stretching vibration (1158 cm−1) of ester bonds almost completely disappear after the pretreatment. Meanwhile, the C=O stretching vibration (1637 cm−1) and N-H stretching vibration (3315 cm−1) of amide bonds increase significantly. Furthermore, the degradation process of PPTA was also explored by ATR-FTIR (Fig. 4 ). The peak at 1637 cm−1 of PPTA disappears obviously, which indicates that the amide bonds are broken during the degradation process. The ATR-FTIR spectra of depolymerization products are shown in Fig. 4b, c, d. In Fig. 4b, the peaks at 3372 cm−1 and 3308 cm−1 are attributed to the N-H stretching vibration of –NH2, and the peaks at 1628 cm−1 and 1505 cm−1 are assigned to the skeleton (C=C) stretching vibration of benzene ring. It is inferred that the depolymerization product is PPD. In Fig. 4c, the peaks at 1555 cm−1 and 1385 cm−1 are characteristic peaks of –COO−, which corresponds to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of –COO−, respectively, indicating that another depolymerization product is Na2TP. Then, the Na2TP is converted to TPA by acidification. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of TPA is shown in Fig. 4d. The wide peak at 3200–2500 cm−1 belongs to the O-H stretching vibration of carboxylic acid, and the peak at 1680 cm−1 is ascribed to the C=O stretching vibration of carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1577 cm−1 and 1511 cm−1 are attributed to the skeleton vibration of benzene ring. The ATR-FTIR analysis illustrates that the degradation reaction of PPTA in the NaOH/n-butanol system is achieved by breaking amide bonds of PPTA, and the depolymerization products (PPD and Na2TP) are generated during depolymerization process. The chemical structures of final products (PPD and TPA) are further identified by NMR, as shown in Fig. 5 . In 1H NMR spectrum of PPD (Fig. 5a), the peak at 6.57 ppm is attributed to the H-2 of PPD, and the peak at 3.33 ppm is assigned to –NH2. In 13C NMR spectrum of PPD (Fig. 5b), the peaks at 138.60 and 116.74 ppm are ascribed to C-1 and C-2 of PPD, respectively. In 1H NMR spectrum of TPA (Fig. 5c), the peak at 13.24 ppm is –COOH, and the peak at 8.04 ppm is assigned to the H-3 of TPA. In 13C NMR spectrum of TPA (Fig. 5d), the peaks at 167.13, 134.90 and 129.93 ppm are attributed to C-1, C-2 and C-3 of TPA, respectively. The NMR analysis further indicates that the final products are PPD and TPA. The changes of the surface morphology of PPTA fibers during depolymerization process are observed clearly by SEM analysis (Fig.S3). Besides, SEM images with magnification of 600X of PPTA fibers in the degradation process are shown in Fig. S4. As aforementioned, the surfaces of original PPTA fibers are coated with a layer of polyacrylate adhesives (Fig. S3a). After pretreatment, the surfaces of PPTA fibers are clean, indicating that the adhesives were effectively removed (Fig. S3b). After the pretreated PPTA fibers are degraded in 5 wt% NaOH/n-butanol system at 180 °C for 2 h, some obvious pores appear on the surface of the incompletely degraded PPTA fibers, which can be explained by the different solubility of two depolymerization products in the n-butanol (Fig. S3c). Ultimately, the PPTA fibers are completely degraded, and the depolymerization product Na2TP retains the morphology of PPTA fibers and becomes loose and porous, while PPD is dissolved in the solvent (Fig. S3d). The porous structure of depolymerization product Na2TP is also testified by BET results (Table S2). The BET surface area and average pore size of depolymerization product Na2TP are 23.41 m2/g and 23.82 nm, respectively. The elemental mappings of PPTA fibers during degradation process are observed by EDS analysis (Fig. S5). Compared with the original PPTA fiber, the content of N element on the surface of the pretreated PPTA fiber increases. However, the content of N element on the surface of the pretreated PPTA fiber decreases during the degradation process, suggesting that the depolymerization product PPD was dissolved in the solvent. In addition, the content of Na element increases continuously with the progression of degradation, implying that another depolymerization product is Na2TP. The elemental compositions of raw materials and depolymerization products were investigated by element analysis instrument (Table S3). In comparison with the original PPTA, the element contents of H and O in pretreated PPTA decrease obviously, whereas the element contents of C and N increase markedly. It can be further confirmed that the polyacrylate adhesives on the surface of PPTA are removed by pretreatment. As for the depolymerization product, the Na content reaches up to 17.46% in Na2TP, and then the Na content is decreased to 0.02% after acidification; the N content in PPD reaches up to 21.29%, however, there is still 3.10% of O in PPD owing to the oxidation of PPD in atmosphere. The elemental compositions of PPTA, Na2TP, TPA and PPD are in accordance with theoretical value (Table S4). The element analysis further demonstrates the amide bonds of PPTA are cleaved and the monomers (TPA and PPD) are reclaimed."
7,Exploration of degradation mechanism,"3.2 Exploration of degradation mechanism For the sake of further exploring the degradation mechanism, the contact angles θ for n-alcohols and PPTA monofilament were measured by dynamic contact angle test (Table S5). It was observed that the average θ for methanol and PPTA monofilament is 85.54°. With the increase of alkyl chain, the average θ for solvent and PPTA monofilament decreases significantly. The average θ for n-butanol and PPTA monofilament is the smallest, which is 13.24°. Then, the average θ increases again for PPTA monofilament and n-alcohol with longer alkyl chain, such as n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol and n-octanol. The results show that the n-butanol has the best wettability to PPTA monofilament, which is consistent with the effect of n-butanol on the degradation. Although the NaOH/n-butanol system exhibits excellent catalytic performance on the degradation of PPTA, the solubility of NaOH in n-butanol is poor. To increase the solubility and dissociation of NaOH in n-butanol, the effect of water on degradation of PPTA was explored (Fig. 6 ). Compared with the NaOH/n-butanol system, the degradation rate of PPTA is significantly accelerated by adding 1 wt% and 2 wt% water. Moreover, the PPTA fibers are completely degraded after a reaction time of 4 h in the systems containing 1 wt% and 2 wt% water. However, the degradation rate of PPTA decreases with the addition of 5 wt% and 10 wt% water. As seen in Table S5, the average θ of water is 96.96°, which shows that the wettability of water to PPTA is poor. Based on the above discussion, we can infer that the addition of a small amount of water (1 wt% or 2 wt%) not only increases the solubility of NaOH but also does not significantly change the wettability of n-butanol. Based on above results and discussion, we propose the following degradation mechanism (Scheme 1 ). We can deduce that the amide bond reacts with the hydroxide (OH–) rather than the n-butanol because the ester bond is not formed during the degradation process. Thus, the degradation of PPTA in NaOH/n-butanol system is not alcoholysis reaction. The n-butanol only acts as a reaction medium, which is not only conducive to the dissolution and transfer of NaOH, but also beneficial to the wetting and swelling of PPTA. In n-butanol solution, the OH– can readily attack C=O of the amide to undergo nucleophilic addition, possibly forming tetrahedral intermediates, followed by elimination reaction. Since this reaction is carried out under alkaline conditions, and the carboxylic acid can be neutralized with the base, thus shifting the equilibrium. Finally, the PPTA is degraded into Na2TP and PPD."
8,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the depolymerization of PPTA was successfully performed in 5 wt% NaOH/n-butanol system at 180 °C for 6 h. The amide bonds were completely broken via the cleavage of C-N bonds catalyzed by OH–. The final products PPD and TPA were reclaimed, and the yields reached up to 91.5% and 92.0%, respectively. More notably, the depolymerization product Na2TP is insoluble in n-butanol but the PPD can dissolve in n-butanol completely, which facilitates the separation of depolymerization products. Furthermore, the results indicate that the wettability of n-alcohols on the PPTA directly affects the degradation efficiency of PPTA, and the addition of a small amount of water promotes the degradation of PPTA in NaOH/n-butanol system. The work provides a promising way for the recycling of waste PPTA. However, most of the depolymerization reaction of aramid fibers demand high-temperature conditions with the presence of a strong base catalyst. It is necessary to develop more gentle, efficient and energy saving recycling methods in the future."
