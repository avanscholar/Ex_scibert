0,Introduction,"There has been an increasing demand for fossil fuels. They lead to serious environmental problems, since the burning of these fuels releases gases to the atmosphere, which are responsible to worsen the greenhouse effect and causing global warming. In addition, acid rain and depletion of the ozone layer are also observed [1]. The impact of environmental problems and the limited supply of these fuels encouraged researches to found out renewable and environmentally sustainable energy sources and, in this context, hydrogen may be an attractive alternative [2,3]. Hydrogen stands out by presenting an energy density of 141.86kJg−1, higher than the hydrocarbon-based fuel, such as methane (55.53kJg−1), propane (50.36kJg−1) and gasoline (47.50kJg−1) [4,5]. Moreover, its direct combustion releases only water as a byproduct and, hence, reducing the environmental impact [6]. Hydrogen is also capable of generating electricity by fuel cells and may be used in vehicle by the same cells or by internal combustion engines [2,7]. Currently, hydrogen has been produced from fossil fuels, biomass, water and the reform of natural gas;besides, hydrocarbon oxidation, coal gasification and finally electrolysis of water [8]. Nevertheless, these methods require high operation temperatures and pressures, which demand high amount of energy and are expensive processes [9]. In contrast, hydrogen production by biological routes, which corresponds to only 1% of the total hydrogen production, is an attractive process for being performed in room temperature and atmospheric pressure. For that, it can provide a reduction in energy consumption and, consequently, promoting favorable energetic balances [10–12]. Among the biological systems for the hydrogen production there are the photolysis of water, anaerobic fermentation or dark fermentation and photofermentaion. It is also possible to use hybrid system, which is an association of biological routes [8]. Anaerobic or dark fermentation has been widely studied due to the faster hydrogen conversion rates, no light requirement and simple operation in comparison to photosynthetic routes. The possibility of using different renewable sources as substrate might be also emphasized. In addition, during hydrogen production, a diversity of metabolites are synthesized as well that may have a commercial use, such as effluent of dark fermentation applied in a hybrid system as substrate for photo-fermentation [2,13,14]. Concerning on the substrates that are used in dark fermentation, there have been several types that can be used for the fermentative production of hydrogen, such as glucose, sucrose and starch. Nevertheless, this kind of carbon source presents an expensive cost, which prevents the process to be economically feasible. Therefore, recent studies have used organic wastes as substrate for hydrogen production [15–17]. Among the raw materials are municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes rich in sugars such as whey cheese and molasses of sugar cane, beet and soy. Besides, there are also residues with high content of lignocellulosic matter, such as wastes of distilleries, paper and chemical industries [18–21]. It is important to note the biological production of hydrogen employing these sources as substrates minimizes the accumulation of wastes in industrial processes coupled with the formation of value-added products [22,23]. In addition, the medium composition, pH control, temperature, type and pre-treatment inocula, genetic modification of microorganisms, bioreactor configuration and operated mode have been studied in order to improve hydrogen productionby dark fermentation [2,24]. According to Show et al. [25], semi-continuous and continuous operations lead to higher hydrogen production than batch mode. In relation to designs of bioreactors, that can be suspended or immobilized bioreactors, Continuous Stirred Tank Reator (CSTR), Anaerobic Sequencing Batch reactor (ASBR), Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AMBR), Fixed-bed Bioreactor, Anaerobic Fluidized-bed Bioreactor (AFBR), Expanded Granular Sludge Bed Reactor (EGSBr) and Up-Flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) have been extensively studied with interesting results [24–29]. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of the type of carbon source (standard glucose or lactose from milk whey permeate) on the hydrogen production by dark fermentation and using a pre-treated microbial consortium in a repeated-batch operated in cycles. The mode of supplementing the sugars was evaluated by repeatedly adding them in isolated, alternated and simultaneous ways during the fermentation."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The inoculum was provided by the Center of Biotechnological Process of the School of Chemical Engineering of Federal University of Uberlândia (Brazil). The inoculum used in the assays was originally from the effluent of a UASB reactor from a dairy-producing factory. It consisted of a microbial consortium, which was previously adapted in a synthetic medium with the following composition: KH2PO4 3g/L,K2HPO4 7g/L, MgSO4 1g/L, yeast extract 3g/L, meat extract 0.5g/L, (NH4)2SO4 1g/L and lactose 20g/L. Lactose was from Milk Whey Permeate (MWP) purchased from Sooro Concentrado Indústria de Produtos Lácteos Ltda (Brazil). MWP was composed mainly of lactose (92.97%) and protein (1.42%). The inoculum vials were stored in the dark at room temperature. Nitrogen gas was bubbled for 10min in order to keep the inoculum in anaerobic environment. In the microbial consortium used in this work, among the microorganisms that were isolated, three genera were found in predominant number and indentified as Clostridium sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. [30]."
3,Assays of hydrogen production,"2.2 Assays of hydrogen production Previously to the assays of hydrogen production, experiments were carried out to verify the influence of two inoculum pretreatments, heat shock and acid treatment, in order to inactive microorganisms present in the microbial consortium that consumes hydrogen. The conditions were according to Chang et al. [30]. The hydrogen productivity were superior applying inoculum thermal pre-treated, therefore, this procedure was used in the following steps. Fermentations were carried out in a Bio-Tec-Flex Tecnal™ batch reactor of 1.5L volume with a reaction volume of 700mL, equipped with mechanical stirrer and temperature control. The reaction volume was composed of inoculum (1.6%v/v) and synthetic medium (98.4%v/v). Fermentation medium, whose composition was defined in previous work [31], consisted of 0.6g/L ferrous sulfate, 1.5g/L ammonium sulfate, 1.28g/L magnesium sulfate and its initial pH was adjusted to 7.0. During the assay, pH was allowed to drop to 5.5 and, next, controlled until the end of the process by addition of NaOH solution (0.1M). After ensuring anaerobic conditions in the medium by bubbling nitrogen gas, the fermentations assays were carried out at 30°C. Fermentation process was controlled over time; and biogas, metabolites evolution, substrate consumption and cell growth were monitored during the process. The biogas flow was measured by water displacement, the metabolite (organic acids and alcohols) and substrate concentrations were determined by HPLC. The composition of biogas was evaluated by GC. The calculation of yield and productivity was performed according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The yield was calculated considering conversion of glucose, lactose and both simultaneously, according to the assay. Hydrogen yield = mol H 2 m o l s u g a r c o n s u m e d (1) Productivity = mmol H 2 reactional vol. ( L ) × time fermentation ( day ) (2) For all the assays, the kinetic parameters (Hmax, Rmax and λ) was determined by fitting the experimental data of cumulative hydrogen production to a modified Gompertz (Eq. (3)) by using the software Statistica 7.1 (StatSoft™). (3) H ( t ) = H max exp { -exp [ 2 .71828 R max H max ( λ -t ) + 1 ] } where H(t) is the total amount of hydrogen produced during fermentation time (mL); t is time of fermentation (h); Hmax is the hydrogen production potential (mL); Rmax is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h) and λ is the time of lag phase before exponential hydrogen production (h) [31]."
4,Fermentation with repeated-batch cycles,"2.3 Fermentation with repeated-batch cycles Four conditions were tested in order to evaluate biogas production and the fermentative process behavior, using two sugars, glucose and lactose from MWP, that were added in isolated, alternated or simultaneous way. MWP in powder was applied to allow maintaining fixed the composition in all assays. Hydrogen production using this feedstock indicates that whey employment as the substrate enables to entail the minimization of an industrial residue to the production of a bio-based fuel. In the first assay, MWP (initial concentration of 20g/L of lactose) was used as substrate, similarly as described in the Section 2.2. During the process, after identifying that sugar was totally consumed, MWP was added to the medium to adjust lactose concentration to 10g/L. The medium volume was maintained constant, that is, the same aliquot volume used to withdraw samples was also added to the bioreactor in order to adjust the sugar concentration of the fermentation medium. Therefore, the mass balance equations of products as well as for biomass concentration are the same as the batch operation. Second fermentation was carried out as the first one, except glucose was used as substrate. The addition of both substrates (glucose and MWP) at the same proportion of sugars (1:1), being that the fermentation started with 10g/L of lactose and 10g/L of glucose was investigated in the third fermentation. While substrates were completely consumed, 5g/L of glucose and 5g/L of lactose were added repeatedly. In the fourth fermentation, the substrates were added alternately throughout the process, by starting with MWP (20g/L of lactose). After the substrate totally consumed, glucose was added at concentration of 10g/L. Similarly, when glucose was entirely consumed, MWP was added and its concentration adjusted to 10g/L of lactose."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The produced gas was collected and its composition was determined by gas chromatography using the chromatograph Shimadzu™ model GC 17A, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a capillary column Carboxen™ 1010 (length 30m, internal diameter 0.53mm). The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 230, 32 and 230°C, respectively. Argon was used as a carrier gas. Concentration of sugar (lactose and glucose) and organic acids were quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Samples were diluted with ultrapure water, filtered through a membrane (0.22μm pore size, Millipore™) and injected into a chromatographic system (Shimadzu™ model LC-20A Prominence, Supelcogel™ C-610H column), equipped with ultra-violet and refractive detectors. The former was used to read organic acids at a wave length of 210nm and the latter quantified sugars and ethanol. Analyses were carried out using phosphoric acid 0.1% as a carrier solution, pump flow rate at 0.5mL/min, temperature oven at 32°C. The sample volume injected into the chromatograph was 20μL. The cell density was determined by spectrophotometry at optical density of 660nm and converted in gvs/L using a calibration curve."
6,Results and discussion,"The evolution of hydrogen by dark fermentation occurs simultaneously to the production of organic acids and alcohols, besides growth of cells. The synthesis of the metabolites indicates the metabolic pathways that are prevailing in the fermentative process and allows a better understanding of hydrogen production. The production of different metabolites is associated with the diversity of microorganisms that are present into microbial consortium and were selected after thermal pre-treatment, since the heat shock pre-treatment inactivates the microorganisms that do not form spores [32,33]. Therefore, in the hydrogen production by dark fermentation, concentrations of cell and metabolites were verified. These parameters were determined for the first assay, using only MWP as substrate, are shown in Fig. 1 . The whole fermentation time was 449h and 11.44L of biogas was produced. By the analysis of Fig. 1a, hydrogen productivity and yield increased in the first 25h of fermentation and reached a maximum value of 74.3mmol H2/Lday and 2.20mol H2/mol of consumed hexose, respectively. From 25h to 100h of process, it was noted a sharp decline in productivity and yield. In this period of time, 20g/L of lactose was totally consumed. At 70h and 247h, MWP (10g/L of lactose) was added in mean time intervals of 24h. Further, the time interval to adjust lactose concentration was increased to 40h by the end of fermentation (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, after 200h yield and productivity decreased continuously until fermentation was ceased. The repeated fed of substrate allowed to increase hydrogen yield and productivity from 100h to 200h and were 26.81% and 50.84% lower than maximum values. However, after 250h the addition of lactose did not influence on the hydrogen production. Concerning to the cell growth, the profile followed the same tendency of productivity and yield. Except from 25h and 70h, the cell density reached 5.99g/L in 263h of fermentation. From this time it decreased attaining 4.39g/L independently of adjusting lactose concentration. In relation to the metabolites (Fig. 1c and d), lactic acid was produced until 128h of process and reached 14.07g/L. After that, it was consumed until 214h, achieving 6.20g/L. Finally, it returned to be produced attained a concentration of 25.88g/L at the end of the process. The production of acetic acid was low during the first 147h (1.21g/L). After this stage acetic acid was synthesized until process is ceased, achieving 9.5g/L. Propionic acid production was not observed after 195h and its maximum was 4.92g/L. Butyric acid was produced during 309h reaching 30.1g/L; and 19% was consumed from this time to the end of the process. The production of ethanol started after 55h of fermentation and its final concentration was 9.07g/L. In the second assay, similar fermentation was performed; however, glucose was used as substrate. The profiles of hydrogen productivity, yield, cell growth, glucose consumption and metabolites evolution are presented in Fig. 2 . Maximum productivity of 107.33 mmolH2/Lday was 30.77% higher than the assay using MWP as substrate and occurred at 20h of assay. In contrast from the first condition, by adding only glucose, the process offered two maximum yields, at 20h and 185h, of 1.31mol H2/mol of consumed hexose and 1.64mol H2/mol of consumed hexose, respectively. It is important to note the yield was higher than 1.10mol H2/mol de consumed hexose by adding MWP. The higher magnitudes of yield were due to higher H2 production and lower consumption rate of substrate. By applying glucose as substrate the second addition was performed after 60h of process, similar to the previous assay. Nevertheless, the following additions were carried out intervals of time 40% longer than with MWP. For this condition, the total biogas was higher (14.27L); however the period of time that the process lasted was shorter (422h). This production could be favored by the increment of cell concentration that varied from 4.47g/L in only 36h. By comparison of both conditions, the cell growth rate was higher than when glucose was used, since cell concentration varied 5.50g/L in 263h by applying MWP as substrate. On the other hand, the decrease of biomass was higher in the second fermentation, since biomass concentration decrease to 2.22g/L from 214h to 422h. The range of decay in biomass in the presence of lactose was only from 5.99g/L to 4.39g/L at the end of process. In respect to the metabolites production, similar trends in the profiles were observed between both conditions, with MWP or glucose. Lactic acid was synthesized in the first 91h attaining a concentration of 19.91g/L, consumed until 185h (5.5g/L) and produced again until the end of the fermentation (23.85g/L). Butyric acid reached a maximum concentration (17.42g/L) at 253h and, further, it was consumed to 12.03g/L. It should be emphasized that during consumption of lactic acid with simultaneous production of butyric acid, there was a second maximum in hydrogen productivity and yield. Propionic acid was produced up to 185h and, after, it was slightly consumed achieving 4.33g/L. In relation to acetic acid and ethanol, their production was lower than the previous assay, reaching 2.22g/L and 6.67g/L, respectively. By comparing the results of the current study with further works, the repeated-batch enabled to have a system with duration time of 449h that is considerable longer than in batch operation. In addition, it was verified that the type of sugar could influence the hydrogen production. Davila-Vazquez et al. [34] studied the hydrogen production process with inoculum from granular anaerobic sludge, with a fermentation time of 46h using P.A. lactose, lactose from the whey and P.A. glucose as substrates. The higher hydrogen yields were 1.8 and 1.55mol H2/mol of hexose and productivity of 134 and 194.4mmol H2/Ld for the P.A. lactose and lactose from whey permeate, respectively. The yield obtained for glucose was 1.46mol H2/mol glucose. These authors reported the production of acetic acid and butyric acid and a lower content of propionic acid. Romão et al. [31] also evaluated the batch process for H2 production by dark fermentation using a microbial consortium and cheese whey permeate (20g/L of lactose) as a substrate. Under optimized condition (initial pH 7.0 and FeSO4 and (NH4)2SO4 concentrations of 0.6 and 1.5g/L, respectively), hydrogen yield of 2.06mol H2/mol hexose and maximum productivity of 86.31mmol H2/L/d were achieved, in a process that lasted 93h. Therefore, the repeated-fed-batch in cycles, tested with MWP or glucose, allowed to keeping the system active for 4–10 fold longer than batch operation. In this study, the additions of both sugars (lactose or glucose) simultaneously or alternately, were performed to verify if this same system could enhance hydrogen production. Third fermentation was carried out by adding the two substrates at the same time each cycle. Fig. 3 summarizes the responses when glucose and MWP were added in the medium at the same proportion of the sugar (lactose: glucose, 1:1). The initial behavior of the fermentative process was the same as described in the first two tests with addition of one type of substrate. It was noted a maximum productivity in 24h of fermentation, which presented 168.27mmol H2/L.day. At this point, the yield was 1.30mol H2/mol of consumed hexose (Fig. 3a). After about 35h of fermentation, it was observed a decrease in productivity. According to Fig. 3a, the profile of yield under Condition 3 presented a different trend from the previous Conditions 1 and 2. There were three maximum values, at 59h, 258h, 422h. The yield was 1.62, 2.02 and 2.15mol H2/mol of consumed hexose, respectively. The final yield was 2.04mol H2/mol of consumed hexose at 465h. In respect to productivity, it was noted its reduction was about 50% in relation to the maximum achieved and it stabilized after 154h of fermentation. The total time of this process was 465h and the biogas volume was 32.05L. It was also noted a cell growth in the first 30h of fermentation, varying from 0.55g/L to 5.30g/L in 24h (Fig. 3b). During the whole assay, the range of cell concentration was between 2.73–5.30g/L, keeping this value in the last cycle. In relation to cycles of addition and consumption of substrate, the first cycle lasted 17h and the following intervals were carried out in mean time of 30h. Concerning to metabolites production, lactic acid was formed in the first 87h (12.79h), consumed until 226h and, after, produced until the end of the fermentation (18.01g/L). Acetic acid was produced during the first 136h (6.01g/L). It was consumed until 201h (4.17g/L) and, then, it was produced reaching a final concentration of 5.05g/L. The production of propionic acid started at 35h of assay and the final concentration was 2.47g/L. During 249h of process butyric acid was produced (22.08g/L) and after is 21% consumed. Ethanol started to be formed only after 106h of fermentation and its final concentration was 3.79g/L. By performing the repeated-batch with simultaneous addition of the substrates, it was possible to obtain a higher maximum productivity. Nevertheless, the duration time of the process was not increased. Thus, in the fourth condition tested in this study, the substrates were added to the system alternatively, in order to verify if this alternative would change the metabolic routes, toward to extent the hydrogen production. Fig. 4 shows the results found in the fourth fermentation in alternated cycles of MWP and glucose. The productivity and yield attained maximum values of 132.06mmol H2/Lday and 3.40mol H2/mol consumed hexose, respectively, in 25h of fermentation (Fig. 4a). The condition of alternated cycles of MWP and glucose allowed an extension of 930h. The biogas volume was 16.08L. In relation to the cell growth, initial concentration was 0.35g/L and after 41h, cell concentration varied from 2.42g/L to 3.72g/L (Fig. 4b). The substrate was completely consumed with high rate of hydrogen production. Fig. 4b also shows the profile of sugar consumption. The fermentation started in the presence of only lactose that was totally consumed in 60h. After that, the cycles had alternated feeding of sugar type. This system enabled the occurrence of three maximum productivity and yield, unlike the other conditions (Fig. 4a). It was observed in previous assays, when the sugar was consumed the microbial consortium also used lactic acid as substrate and there was second maximum hydrogen productivity. Thus, in this condition, during fermentation (from 333 to 450h), no sugar was added, and not only lactic acid, but ethanol and acetic acid was also consumed, and consequently, it was observed the third maximum in production of hydrogen (Figs. 4a − 4d). With respect to the metabolites production (Fig. 4c–d), lactic acid concentration reached 30.48g/L at 333h of fermentation. After depletion of sugar source, lactic acid was totally consumed and only after 760h of assay, this metabolite was produced achieving a concentration of 26.33g/L. Final concentrations of acetic acid and ethanol were 6.97g/L and 5.22g/L. It should be emphasized that the depletion of sugar induced their consumption as well. Propionic acid was synthesized to 469h (6.45g/L) and, next, consumed gradually until reaching 2.72g/L. The concentration of butyric acid attained 31.61g/L during 614h and its production was enhanced with lactic acid consumption from 333 a 445h. From these results it was observed the repeated-batch by alternating cycles of MWP and glucose allowed an additional peak (productivity and yield) extending the hydrogen production. The first peak was determined in the beginning of fermentation simultaneously with high cell growth and lactose consumption rates. The second peak was observed at 156h, when lactic acid was consumed and butyric and acetic acids were produced as well. The third peak occurred within 372h and 492h, with total consumption of lactic acid. Similarly to the previous conditions, the hydrogen production was ceased when lactic acid was produced regardless if cycles of sugar addition were performed followed by depletion of lactose or glucose. The effect of a mixture of sugars was also investigated previously in batch mode systems. Rosales-Colunga et al. [35] investigated the H2 production in batch mode using Escherichia coli WDHL. The authors studied the influence of the type of substrate (lactose, glucose, galactose and mixture of glucose and galactose) in the H2 formation and the metabolic routes. The authors reported that when glucose was the substrate, the yield was lower than the other substrates (0.3 molH2/mol consumed glucose). In relation to the fermentations using lactose and a mixture of glucose and galactose, the yield was 1.02mol H2/mol consumed hexose. Nevertheless, the optimum productivity was obtained utilizing a mixture of glucose and galactose. Besides, when galactose was applied as substrate, the authors noticed that the predominant metabolic route was the synthesis of lactic acid, which led no production of hydrogen. Xu et al. [36] also investigated different substrates in batch production of hydrogen. The authors tested xylose, glucose and a mixture of xylose and glucose and described cell growth favored by glucose. However, the specific productivity was higher (12.56mmol H2/h g cell) when a mixture of 9g/L of xylose and 3g/L of glucose was used. Independently of the experimental condition approached in this study, the formation of metabolites followed a trend and it is important to relate the compounds produced along with hydrogen. Maximum evolution of H2 could be assessed by the production of acetic and butyric acids during fermentation. Based on the stoichiometric relation of hydrogen production from glucose (Eqs. (4) and (5)) and from lactose (Eqs. (6) and (7)), higher yield of these sugars in hydrogen occurs when metabolic pathways for production of acetic acid (Eqs. (4) and (6)) and butyric acid (Eqs. (5) and (7)) are predominant [12,37]. (4) C6H12O6 +H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (5) C6H12O6 +H2O→CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 (6) C12H22O11 +5H2O→4CH3COOH+4CO2 +8H2 (7) C12H22O11 +H2O→2CH3CH2CH2COOH+4CO2 +4H2 According to the results of the current work, butyric acid prevailed in all four conditions as well as it was reported by Chen et al. [38] and Pandey et al. [39]. Regardless of the type of substrate cycle tested in the repeated-batch assays, lactic acid was synthesized in the beginning of process. Besides, in the interval around 150 and 250h lactic acid was consumed and it was produced again continuously until fermentation finished. This trend in the lactic acid profile may be related to a reaction of producing H2 by microorganisms in the presence of this metabolite inducing its consumption. Nevertheless, the strains that consumed lactic acid synthesized it again, altering the metabolic pathways. This variation of produced metabolites may be due to the competition of the strains present in the microbial consortium. Besides, in the stage of lactic acid consumption, butyric acid was predominantly produced (Eq. (8)), followed by acetic acid (Eq. (9)) and propionic acid in lower proportion (Eq. (10)) [40]. (8) 2CH3CHOHCOOH+2H2O→CH3CH2CH2COOH+2HCO3 − +H+ +2H2 (9) CH3CHOHCOOH+2H2O→CH3COOH+HCO3 − +2H2 (10) 3CH3CHOHCOOH→2CH3CH2COOH+CH3COOH+HCO3 − +H+ In the final stage of fermentation, the production of lactic acid with interruption of hydrogen formation might be associated to the presence of toxic compounds that inhibited producing H2 strains and increased resistance of lactic acid producing microorganisms. Besides, the high concentration of lactic acid can worsen the competition between these two groups of microorganisms, despite of cyclic feeding of sugars. The findings obtained in the Conditions 1–4 for the dark fermentation in repeated-batch cycles are presented in Table 1 . In order to establish a baseline for comparison, several observations by other researchers were also inserted in Table 1. The highest magnitude of maximum productivity (168.27mmol H2/Lday, in 24h of process) was in Condition 3, by adding to the bioreactor MWP and glucose simultaneously. The maximum yield for this assay was 2.15mol H2/mol of hexose consumed in 422h of assay and the duration time was 465h. Nevertheless, the longer extension of fermentation (930h) was observed in Condition 4, maintaining productivity and yield in magnitudes close to 15.76% and 40.55% of the maximum values, respectively. Besides the analyses of metabolites, substrate and biomass concentration, experimental data for all conditions were used to determined the kinetic parameter of Hmax(H2 production potential); Rmax(maximum H2 production rate) and λ(lag phase duration) by modified Gompertz equation, within a level of confidence of 95%. This analysis showed that for the condition with the highest productivity, that is, with cycles of simultaneous addition of glucose and MWP, the Hmax was 26.65L, Rmax was 61.65mL/h, and λ was 0h. The repeated-batch system was evaluated previously in hydrogen production by dark fermentation focusing in the concentration of cells, as it was reported by Sivagurunathan et al. [41]. These authors obtained enriched mixed cultures in repeated batch mode to be applied, then, in an anaerobic hydrogen fermentation in continuous operation. In the literature, repeated-fed batch and repeated-batch operation, applied similarly to the current work, was investigated in the hydrogen production by photo-fermentation using purple non-sulfur bacteria. As repeated-batch mode, Liu et al. [42] observed a total adaptation of thermophilic bacteria using solid household waste at 70°C. The inoculum was obtained from glucose fermentation and exposed at increasing solid household waste concentration, from 1gVS/L to 10gVS/L. Their findings showed a good method to acclimate and cultivate microbial culture mainly to increase hydrogen production. Pattanamanee et al. [43] studied hydrogen production by Rhobobacter sphaeroides S10. Unlike to the current work, these authors removed a specific volume of the culture broth and replaced with an equal volume of the fresh medium. They also used a medium with mixed carbon source (glucose, xylose and acetic acid). The parameters were the volume of the broth exchanged with the fresh medium after a batch phase; the instance of shift from the batch to the repeated-batch operation; and the number of the repeated batch cycles. By fixing a broth exchange volume at 90%, a first stage of batch mode of 84h, followed by four repeated-batch cycles of 60h, average maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.49mmol H2/Ld. It should be emphasized that the process was performed for less than 160h. Hydrogen production by photofermentation using repeated-fed-batch was investigated by Ren et al. [44] that applied Rhodopseudomonas facaelis RLD-53. The cycles were carried out by adding fresh concentrated medium of 5 mmol-acetate/mL. The authors observed the fermentation until 288h. This study also indicated that repeated-fed-batch improved H2 production. As result, they reported an average H2 yield of 3.17mol H2/mol acetate, based on the whole process with average substrate conversion efficiency of 79.3% and maximum H2 production rate of 1.28mmol H2/Lday. Silva et al. [45] also studied the repeated-fed-batch cycles operation by alternating the type of lactose and glucose P.A. They reported that controlling the residual amount of sugar, bacteria inhibition was avoided; lactic acid, that was toxic to the biomass, was consumed and the metabolic route of butyric acid production was predominant. Under optimum conditions, the H2 productivity reached 208.40mmol H2/Lday in 52h. The repeated-batch mode culture can offer advantages over the microbial batch mode including the better depletion of medium in the bioreactor at the end of cultivation and less time required for process operation. Moreover, the repeated-batch culture is expected to increase the target-product synthesis. In this context dark fermentation may be operated by substrate addition isolated (one kind of carbon source), alternant or simultaneously with at least two carbon sources. Thereby, it is hoped to aim increases on the hydrogen evaluation. In general, by alternating the type of sugar, the metabolic route of bacteria would change. Besides, it was possible to reduce the inhibition caused by catabolic effects and, consequently, extending the hydrogen evolution process. On the other hand, alternately addition may favor the efficient consumption of carbon source since a microbial consortium was used. In this data fermentations with alternately addition of glucose and lactose promoted maximum yield of 3.40mol H2/mol of hexose consumed and it can be consider a best operation mode. Finally, increments on the hydrogen yield of 1.58, 1.54, 2.59 fold higher in comparison to simultaneous and isolated additions with MWP and glucose, respectively, were observed due to high time of fermentative process in which microbial cultures remained with strong metabolic activity. Finally, it should be highlighted the importance of this investigations a possibility to extend the duration time in which microbial consortium remains active producing hydrogen. Furthermore, this work suggested a diversity of wastewater industrial, sewage, agricultural that are rich in these sugars, glucose and lactose, may be employed in a process that reduces the accumulation of these effluents, associating their treatment to the production of a value-added product such as hydrogen. Moreover, this work contributes to improve dark fermentation process which still requires effort to be efficiently competitive to the conventional methods. According to Pandu and Joseph [46], hydrogen production by dark fermentation using molasses presented a cost production (10 US$/MBTU) lower than electrolysis from water (11 US$/MBTU), nuclear energy (12–19 US$/MBTU), biomass gasification (10 US$/MBTU), wind Energy wind (10 US$/MBTU), photovoltaic power station (10 US$/MBTU) and thermal decomposition of steam (10 US$/MBTU). Nevertheless, pyrolysis method is considerable competitive taking into account the parameter of cost production, that is 4 US$/MBTU. Another approach was discussed by Manish and Banerjee [47] that compared biological processes (dark fermentation, photofermentation and the two-stage of both) from sugarcane and steam methane reforming based on reduction of greenhouse gas emission, net energy ratio (ratio of hydrogen output to the non-renewable energy input) and energy efficiency. The authors reported that two-stage process presented the highest energy efficiency and net energy ratio among the biological process if the by-products were considered. Besides, the production of 1kg of hydrogen by this process causes a reduction of 57.73% of greenhouse gas (7.31–9.37kg CO2) and a decrease in 65.79% of the use of non-renewable energy (123.2–148.7MJ) compared to steam methane reforming, specially due to the removal and utilization of by-products. The economic potential of the proposed sequential batch is assessed in terms of the total cost per year. It is known that the total cost combines the operating cost and the capital investment. Therefore, it is important to estimate the installed costs of all the equipments, for which, stainless steel is the main material of construction. Here, equipments such as a 120L bench scale bioreactor with stirring and temperature control (as manufacturer US$ 30–40,000), besides the gas meter (as manufacturer US$ 1000–2000) are indicated. Complementary, regarding medium composition (repeated-batch with simultaneous addition) and according to information from manufactures the price of substrates totalized US$ 617/kg. In addition, the operating costs are taken as the utility costs, since electricity, steam and cooling water represented per year US$ 0.084/kW.h, US$ 17/t and US$ 0.06/t, respectively [48]. Finally, depending on the fermentation time as well as the sequential batch operation type, a prediction of the hydrogen process cost and the energy requirement would be defined. In this perspective, in order to establish a two-phase (dark- and photofermentation) system as technically, environmentally and economically viable process, future research must be done in both stages, dark and photofermentation, thus biological method cam overcome conventional process."
7,Conclusion,"MWP and glucose were added as substrates in repeated-batch cycles to hydrogen production by dark fermentation. It was observed enhanced in the yield when compared to the fermentations proceeded with only one type of these carbon sources. Although the highest maximum productivity was attained with simultaneous addition of sugars (1:1; Lactose: glucose). It was possible to extend hydrogen production for 930h when MWP and glucose were added in alternated cycles and it was verified three peaks of high H2 productivity. Under this condition, maximum productivity of 132.06mmol H2/Ld, in 25h, with 3.4mol H2/mol hexose consumed."
