0,Introduction,"Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) has many industrial applications. For example, it can be used as a raw material for the production of succinic acid, pentanediol, tetrahydrofuran, pyran, etc., as a solvent for coatings, resins and grease, and as a lubricant and dispersant in the printing and dyeing industry [1–3]. During the production process of nuclear fuel components, a large amount of radioactive waste water containing high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and high ammonia would be produced. The reason for the high COD is the large amount of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [4]. Since tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is a volatile organic compound, it is difficult to be removed in the distillation treatmen1984t of radioactive wastewater, causing secondary pollution. In order to separate THFA from water, the extraction method can be used as one of the separation methods. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the suitable extractant. So far, there have been few reports in the work of liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) systems containing THFA in the previous literature. A. Sayar et al. [5] measured the LLE of water + THFA + cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichloroethane, 3-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl acetate, or 1-octanol system in 293.2 K and improved that 1-octanol and 1,2-Dichloroethane are the more suitable extractants for separating THFA and water. A. Senol et al. [6] measured the LLE of water + THFA + cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, cyclohexyl acetate, or chlorobenzene and improved that chlorobenzene are the more suitable extractants for separating THFA and water. A. Senol [7] explored the LLE of the water + THFA + 1-hexanol in 293.2 K which the distribution coefficient shows an upward trend, but it is less than 1. It shows that this temperature is not suitable for extraction. There are also some studies on the separation of other compounds in the furfural family from water. Dong et al [8]. measured the LLE of the water + furfuryl alcohol + MTBE, isopropyl ether, dichloromethane, or methyl isobutylcarbinol in 298.2 K. Han et al. [9] measured the LLE of the water + furfuryl alcohol + n-propyl acetate and n-pentanol in 303.2, 313.2, and 323.2 K. Yan et al. [10] explored the LLE of the water + furfuryl alcohol + 1,1-Dimethyl acetone and trichloromethane in 303.2, 313.2, and 323.2 K. In this paper, isopentanol and 1-hexanol were investigated as the extractants to separate THFA from water and LLE data of two systems under 101.3 kPa were determined at 303.2, 313.2, 323.2 K. The distribution coefficient (D) and separation factor (S) expressed the solvent's extraction efficiency. Meanwhile, the LLE data were associated with the NRTL and UNIQUAC models. The calculated binary interaction parameters and LLE data was checked by the GUI-MATLAB."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The information of the chemicals was listed in Table 1 . Karl Fischer Moisture Titrator was used to determine mass fraction of water in reagents. The mass fraction of water in isopentanol, 1-hexanol, and THFA were all less than 0.0002, and the mass fraction of these measured by gas chromatography was more than 0.9950, which means the reagents don’t need to be purified again [11]."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure At 303.2, 313.2, and 323.2 K, the chemicals were fully stirred in a tailor-made jacketed glass container for 4 h, afterward stabilized no less than 6 h. During the experimentation, the temperature was gotten by a mercury thermometer which its accuracy was 0.1 K. When the phase equilibrium was achieved, the specimens were gotten by gas chromatography injection needle from the phase of extraction and raffinate respectively and afterward tested by the gas chromatograph which has thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Porapak N column (length of 3 m, 3 mm id). The carrier gas is hydrogen, and the gas flow rate is 60 mL/min. The temperature of the detector and syringe was 513.2 K. The preliminary temperature of column was 393.2 K, increased to 493.2 K at a rate of 30 K/min, then kept at 493.2 K for 3 min. The specimens were measured more than three times by gas chromatography and the final report result is the average of the qualified data. The standard uncertainty of specimens’ composition was calculated by GUM and related standards [12,13], while value was less than ± 0.0038. The calculation equations are shown in follow [14]: (1) S 2 q k = ∑ j = 1 n q i - q ¯ 2 / ( n - 1 ) (2) S 2 q ¯ = S 2 q k / n (3) u w i = S ( W i ¯ ) S q k refers to the experimental standard deviation between the measured values q k and its mean value q ¯ . Thus, the uncertainty u w i of an input value W i is u w i = S ( W i ¯ )."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Experimental LLE data,"3.1 Experimental LLE data In 101.3 kPa, the LLE data for the water + THFA + {isopentanol or 1-hexanol} were measured at 303.2, 313.2, and 323.2 K as well as exhibited in Table 2 . The ternary phase graphs with the feed compositions are shown in Figs. 1-2 . It illustrates that the system was divided as Type Ⅰ system, as well as water and solvent are partially miscible while THFA + water and THFA + solvents are entirely miscible binary mixtures [15]. As the temperature increases, the area of the two-phase zone decreases, but the effect is not insignificant. The binary solubility of water and the two solvents are listed in Table 3 . The data in this work is basically consistent with the binary solubility in the published literature [16–33]. In order to analyze and compare the two solvents’ capacity to recover THFA from water in different temperatures, the D and S in each system were calculated, and the values of them are shown in Table 2, and drawled in Fig. 3-4 . (4) D = w 2 I / w 2 II (5) S = ( w 2 I / w 2 II ) / [( w 1 I / w 1 II )] where superscripts I means the extraction phase, II means the raffinate phase, w1 refers to the mass fractions of water, and w2 refers to that of THFA. It can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 3-4 that when isopentanol is used as the extractant, the value of D and S are exceeded one at each temperature, which gradually decrease with the addition of THFA, and gradually rise as the system temperature increases. When 1-hexanol is used as the extractant, the S value of each temperature system is greater than 1, but the value of D is less than 1 when the temperature is lower, which is consistent with the data measured by A. Senol [7]. With the mass of THFA increases, the value of D increases and that of S decreases. When temperature for system rises, the values of D and S increase too. Consequently, when isopentanol and 1-hexanol are used as extractants, the best extraction temperature is 50℃ and isopentanol exhibits a better extraction capacity in the same conditions. In Fig. 2(b), the LLE data of water + THFA + 1-hexanol measured at 293.5 K by A. Senol [7] have some differences with the data measured at 303.2, 313.2, and 323.2 K in this work, such as solubility magnitude and the slope of tie-lines. To explain the difference in solubility, the binary data of water and 1-hexanol at 293.2 K was measured and listed in Table 3. The related literature has also been searched and recorded in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that in the work of A. Senol [7], the solubility of 1-hexanol in water is less than the value measured in the literature and this work, which leads to the difference in the area of the phase diagram. As for the slope of the phase equilibrium connection line, the change of the D value of the n-hexanol system increases with the increase of temperature, from less than 1 to greater than 1, which leads to a change in the slope of the phase equilibrium connection line. There is also a difference between S in this paper and that the work of A. Senol. Due to the low solubility of n-hexanol in water, small deviations in the calculation of D and S values can lead to different results. Comparing the value of D and S, it is found that the difference is mainly in the low concentration area, which should be caused by the detection error of the chromatogram and the error of the measurement method. As a commonly used extractant, 1-hexanol has also been investigated by other researchers in the determination of phase equilibrium. Kyriale et al. [34] explored the LLE of the water + 5-hydroxymethylfurfural + 1-hexanol in 298.2 K. Julio et al. [35] investigated the LLE of the water + 2,5-dimethylfuran + 1-hexanol in 298.2 and 313.2 K. A. Ghanadzadeh et al. [36] measured the LLE data for the water + butyric acid + 1-hexanol in 298.2, 308.2, and 318.2 K. Comparing the above system with the system studied in this paper, the magnitude relationship between the D and the S is: 2,5-dimethylfuran > butyric acid greater than 5-hydroxymethylfurfural = THFA. Comparing the performance of n-hexanol in the above system, it can be seen that the effect of n-hexanol in extracting furans and acids from water is stronger than that of furfurals. In addition, the D and S values in this work and other water-THFA system literature were compared and shown in Figs. 3-4. In the work of predecessors, the LLE data of water + THFA + cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichloroethane, 3-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl acetate, 1-octanol, 1-hexanol, cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, cyclohexyl acetate, or chlorobenzene has been explored. Among the 10 extractants that have been explored above and the solvents in this work, 1,2-dichloroethane has the largest separation factor(S), which means that its solubility in the water phase is relatively small and the solvent can be recovered easily. The distribution coefficient of isopentanol is the largest, which means that relatively fewer extraction stages are required. However, the distribution coefficient values of the above-mentioned extractants are all less than 1, which indicates that these extractants require multi-stage extraction to completely separate THFA from the water, which means that a larger extractant consumption is required."
6,Thermodynamic modeling,"3.2 Thermodynamic modeling The measured LLE data were correlated through the NRTL and UNIQUAC models to calculate the binary interaction parameter of each model and the non-random parameter α of NRTL model. The structure parameters (r and q) of UNIQUAC model were gotten by Aspen Plus 8.4, which listed in Table 4 . The objective function listed below regressed the interaction parameters of the above model. (6) OF= ∑ k =1 M ∑ j =1 2 ∑ i =1 3 w ijk exp - w ijk cal 2 where wcal means the calculated mass fraction of components, wexp means the experimental mass fraction of that. Subscripts k refers to the tie-line, j refers to the phase, and i refer to the components. M stands for the number of tie lines. The binary interaction parameters calculated by each model are exhibited in Table 5 , and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was used to test the correlation between the calculated value of each model and the experimental value [37]. (7) RMSD = ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 w ijk exp - w ijk cal 2 / 6 M 1 / 2 where, k, j, i, M, w exp, w cal are the same as those of the Eq. (6). The RMSD of the systems are listed in Table 5, and the values are not exceeding 0.0077. Both the NRTL and the UNIQUAC model have a great correlation with the regressed data and the actual data. Each model can be well associated with experimental data, which means that it can accurately describe the phase behavior. In this work, the consistency of the binary interaction parameters and LLE data was calculated and checked using GUI-MATLAB. The program was developed by Juan A. Reyes-Labarta's team [38] and can be downloaded at http://hdl.handle.net/10045/51725. In the calculation process, the experimental and calculated values of phase equilibrium material composition, the temperature, and the regression binary interactive parameters need to be input in an excel file, and then the program would output the corresponding results. As an example, the consistency test of the parameters for LLE data of water + THFA + isopentanol system obtained at 303.2 K are shown in Fig.5 and 6 . Fig.5 shows the miscible boundary of the NRTL model and Fig.6 shows the simulation GM/RT connection. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that only 1–3 (water and solvent) components are partially miscible. Fig. 6 shows that the phase balance connection line of the experimental data and the phase balance connection line of the simulation data are both below the GM/RT plane and tangent to the plane, so the mixed Gibbs free energy of the system is in the minimum state. Therefore, the measured experimental data and the regression binary interaction parameters conform to the minimum state of the mixed Gibbs free energy, which has passed the reliability verification."
7,Conclusions,"In this paper, the LLE data for water + THFA + isopentanol/1-hexanol were explored at 303.2, 313.2,and 323.2 K under 101.3 kPa. The results show that both solvents can be used as extractants to separate THFA and water. The D and S of each system at different temperatures were listed and compared which the values of them in the two systems are both greater than 1 at 313.2 and 323.2 K, indicating that isopentanol exhibits a better extraction capability to extract THFA from water. The experimental values are correlated through the NRTL and UNIQUAC models, and the RMSD values of which are not greater than 0.0077. The GUI-MATLAB verifies the consistency of the calculated binary interaction parameters and the liquid–liquid equilibrium data. The LLE data measured in this paper are credible, which means that these data can support the extraction design of water and THFA."
