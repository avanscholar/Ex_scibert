0,Introduction,"Excessive consumption of fossil fuels was accompanied by serious pollution of the environment has become an urgent problem at the moment presently [1–3]. Conversion and storage of solar energy for clean energy by photocatalytic, as an environmentally friendly technology, is considered to solve above problems thoroughly [4,5]. TiO2 has been widely studied in recent years due to its cheap price, stable performance and abundant reserves in water splitting for hydrogen production [6]. Extensive efforts were made to enhance the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation efficiency of TiO2 in recent years, such as constructing spatial separation structure [7–10], coupling between multiple semiconductors [11,12]and doping of metal or nonmetal [13,14]. Nonetheless, the poor photocatalytic performance is due to its large optical band gap (3.0~3.2 eV) and few exposed active sites, leading to the seriously low solar energy utilization rate (less than 5% of the entire solar power) and extremely lack of industrial application [15,16]. Therefore, a TiO2-based catalyst which has narrow band gap and the ability to fully expose active sites is urgently needed to achieve a high efficiency of photocatalytic decomposition of water into hydrogen. Recently, defect engineering has been widely identified as effective strategy to modify the physicochemical properties and surface active sites of semiconductor photocatalyst [17,18]. Surface defected TiO2 (D-TiO2) comprising crystalline TiO2 core and a disordered shell, generated by the hydrogenation treatment in the reducing atmosphere have recently received much attention [19–21]. The formed disordered amorphous shell with abundant oxygen vacancies can narrow the band gap and enhance the light absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions [22,23]. Jiang et al. reported that the oxygen vacancy-rich TiO2 absorbs ~ 65% of total solar energy by extending the light response range to visible and infrared light. Therefore, the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production under UV light is as high as 6.4 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, which is 8.5 times that of pristine TiO2, and it also shows excellent performance under visible light (140 μmol•g‒1•h‒1) [24]. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancies could act as the capture sites for the electron to inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, therefore leading to enhanced photocatalytic activities [25]. Cai et al. reported that after introducing oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 photonic crystals, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was improved from 246 to 491 μmol•m‒2•h‒1, which was due to the oxygen vacancies effectively promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers [26]. Tian et al. also reported that oxygen vacancies can be used as an electrons and holes scavengers to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of defective TiO2 (6.32 mmol•g‒1•h‒1) is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.65 mmol•g‒1•h‒1) [27]. Moreover, Liu et al. demonstrated that the surface defects of D-TiO2 could reduce the energy barrier of absorption and dissociation of reactant or intermediates and thus accelerate the reaction kinetics of water splitting [28]. Despite these aforementioned benefits of the defect engineering, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency is still not ideal, possibly due to the limited exposure of disordered shell layer resulting from the low surface area of TiO2 nanoparticle. In this context, fabrication of D-TiO2 with abundant exposed defect active sites is highly desirable yet remains challenging. Though reducing the particle size into the nanoscale can render the surface with more exposed active sites, the crystallites of small size tends to agglomerate and otherwise reduce the number of exposed active sites owing to the large surface energy [29]. In recent years, oxygen-vacancy-containing defective two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets photocatalyst have received great attention due to some inherent advantages including short carrier diffusion distance, large specific surface area, relatively abundant defect active sites [30,31]. Kong et al. prepared 2D ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies through plasma treatment, showing higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance (160 μmol•h‒1) than pristine one TiO2 nanosheets (96 μmol•h‒1). This is due to the fact that the 2D ultrathin nanosheets can effectively shorten the migration distance of carriers. More importantly, ultrathin structures TiO2 with more edge sites tend to produce more oxygen vacancies than bulk TiO2 [32]. Further controlling the thickness of 2D nanosheets to the ultrathin or atomic scale will facilitate the formation of oxygen-vacancy defect and enhance the photocatalytic activity. Di et al. demonstrated that the atomically-thin Bi2MoO6 nanosheets could expose more active sites and oxygen vacancies than the bulk counterpart, and the yield of photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO is 3.62 μmol•g‒1•h‒1, which is 2.55 times that of bulk materials [33]. However, the ultrathin nanosheets with large surface energy inevitably results in the restacking of the nanosheets, which hinders the exposure of active sites and mass transport. Recently, 2D holey nanosheets materials have emerged as a promising catalyst in catalysis and energy storage [34]. Compared to the traditional ultrathin nanosheets, this holey 2D nanostructure not only has the advantages of the 2D nanosheets, but also presents excellent properties of porous structure such as exposed maximum edge sites, favorable electrolyte accessibility, and easy evolved gases penetration. Peng et al. reported that 2D holey ZnFe2O4 nanosheets exhibit more interfaces, which facilitates interfacial transport of ions and lead to shortened diffusion paths. This 2D holey nanosheet material shows excellent energy storage performance and is expected to be used in other catalytic fields [35]. We expect that once the surface defects were introduced into the 2D holey TiO2 nanosheets, abundant exposed surface defects and favorable charge and mass transport will be achieved simultaneously. Unfortunately, few of successful examples on the synthesis of 2D holey nanosheets photocatalysts are reported. The development of a facile strategy to prepare defective 2D holey nanosheets with abundant surface defects is still a big challenge. In this work, we proposed a facile sacrificial template strategy for the synthesis of 2D holey defective TiO2 nanosheets with abundant surface oxygen vacancies. In the synthesis process, the TBOT precursor was slowly hydrolyzed to form TiO2 interconnected nanoparticles with abundant mesopores supported on the graphene oxide matrix due to the excellent interfacial compatibility between graphene oxide (GO) and H2O. After remove of GO template followed by a hydrogenation process, unique HD-TiO2 NSs with typically wrinkled surface, mesopores and abundant surface oxygen vacancies were obtained. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of surface oxygen vacancies and structural features, the resulting optimal HD-TiO2-5h NSs photocatalyst exhibited excellent hydrogen production activity with rate of 8.99 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, which is superior to many other reported defected TiO2-based photocatalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstration the preparation of defected 2D holey TiO2 nanosheet with rich oxygen vacancies for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which is expected to pave a new way for design of highly efficient photocatalysts."

Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was purchased from Aladdin China Holding Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The water used in the experiment was deionized water."
3,Synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets (GO NSs),"2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets (GO NSs) The GO NSs were prepared according to a modified Hummers method [36]. In a typical process, 1.5 g of graphite powder was added to a 500 mL beaker. Then, 180 mL 98% concentrated H2SO4 and 20 mL 85% H3PO4 were mixed and dropped into above beaker slowly under mild stirring. The whole solution was heated in an oil bath at 50°C. Subsequently, 9 g of KMnO4 was dispersed in reaction mixture in batches to maintain the reaction system temperature at 50°C constantly. After that, reaction system was remained at 50°C for 12 h under vigorous stirring in sealed condition. Additional 30 % H2O2 was injected slowly from the bottom of the beaker and kept reaction temperature at 50°C. The color of solution changed from black to purple, bright yellow successively until no bubbles. The obtained samples were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water until the pH of the centrifugal solution became neutral. The solid was obtained by freeze-dried 1 day and kept in a drying box."
4,Synthesis of holey TiO2 nanosheets (H-TiO2 NSs),"2.3 Synthesis of holey TiO2 nanosheets (H-TiO2 NSs) The graphene-like holey TiO2 nanosheets was synthesized according to a facile two-step process. Firstly, 90 mg of GO was dispersed in 180 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Then, 9 mL of ethanol containing 1 mL of TBOT and 8 mL of ethanol containing 2 mL H2O were added to the solution in sequence with rapid stirring, and the solution was kept at 45°C for 12 h to form the GO@Ti(OH)4. The GO@Ti(OH)4 precipitate was separated and collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol, and dried at 60°C for 10 h in an oven. Subsequently, the GO@Ti(OH)4 was annealed under air at 500°C for 2 h with the heating rate of 2°C min–1 to remove the GO template and the H-TiO2 NSs was obtained."
5,Synthesis of HD-TiO2 NSs,"2.4 Synthesis of HD-TiO2 NSs The HD-TiO2 NSs was annealed under reducing atmosphere (90 vol. % argon and 10 vol. % hydrogen) at 500°C for different time (3, 4, 5 and 6 h) with the heating rate of 2°C min–1. The synthesized samples were denoted as HD-TiO2-3h NSs, HD-TiO2-4h NSs, HD-TiO2-5h NSs, and HD-TiO2-6h NSs, respectively. For comparative purposes, the bulk TiO2 sample was synthesized with the same method as HD-TiO2 NSs without the presence of GO template, and the defective bulk TiO2 was synthesized by the hydrogenation of the bulk TiO2 under the same condition as the HD-TiO2-5h NSs."
6,Materials characterization,"2.5 Materials characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai 12) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin TEM) with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV and 300 kV were used to characterize the structure and morphology. The carbon contents in the samples was measured by Elemental analyzer (EA, FLASH1112A). The specific surface area and porous structures were characterized by the TriStar II 3020-BET/BJH Surface Area (BET). The crystal phases were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation; λ = 1.5406 Å) with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer in the range of 10 to 80° 2θ at a scan rate of 2° min–1. The surface chemical composition and valence state of the samples were characterized by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA PHI500 spectrometer). The Raman spectra were characterized on a DXR (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were tested on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer equipped with spherical diffuse reflection attachment. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the photocatalysts were characterized by a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using CHI 660E and the operation conditions were listed in the Supporting Information."
7,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photocurrent measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode electrochemical system. Standard calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum wire were usually used as reference electrode and counter electrode respectively. Generally, 4 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 1 mL ethanol and 5 wt% Nafion solution. Then 90 μL of above solution was dispersed in the conductive surface of a FTO (1 × 2 cm) and dried for 1 hour to obtain a uniform film of photocatalyst. Na2SO4 of 2 M was used as the electrolyte solution and xenon lamp of 300 W was used as the light source to measure the photocurrent. the light/dark short-circuit photocurrent response at zero bias voltage was recorded by a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. EIS measurements were performed using a CHI660 B electrochemical analyzer in a 0.1 m KCl solution containing 5 mM [ F e ( C N ) 6 3 − / F e ( C N ) 6 4 − ]. Standard calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum wire were usually used as reference electrode and counter electrode. H-TiO2 NSs and HD-TiO2-5h NSs were coated on glassy carbon electrodes as working electrodes, respectively. Each test applied sine wave potential amplitude was 5 mV and the frequency range was 0.01-100,000 Hz."
8,Evaluation of photocatalytic H2 production activity,"2.7 Evaluation of photocatalytic H2 production activity Photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out in a closed quartz reactor under 25°C reflux. Generally, 5 mL methanol as sacrificial agents, 100 mg catalyst, 20 mL deionized water were added, and a certain amount of chloroplatinic acid was added to make the amount of co-catalyst of Pt deposition is 1%. Then, the reactor was vacuumed to remove dissolved oxygen in the reaction solution under rapid stirring, after that nitrogen was injected to keep the pressure in the reactor at 1 bar. Pt nanoparticles were then deposited on HD-TiO2-5h NSs by exposure to HSX-F300 xenon lamp (NBET, Beijing). 0.4 mL gas was taken out with a syringe per hour and analyzed in a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, CEAULIGHT), which used high-purity nitrogen as the carrier gas. The evaluation of the quantum efficiency (QE) for hydrogen evolution was performed using same closed circulating system under radiation of a 300 W HSX-F300 xenon lamp (NBET, Beijing) with optical filter (365, 420, 450, 500, and 550 nm) system. The QE of photocatalysts calculation details are as follows [37]: QE % = N e N p × 100 % = 2 × M × N A × h × c S × P × t × λ × 100 % where Ne is the amount of reaction electrons, Np is the incident photons, M is the amount of H2 (mol), NA is Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10−34 J•s), c is the speed of light (3 × 108 m/s), S is the irradiation area (0.002826 m2), P is the irradiation intensity measured by a solar power meter (SM206-SOLAR), t is the photoreaction time (s), and λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light (m)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Morphological and structural information,"3.1 Morphological and structural information Fig. 1 a schematically shows the formation process of the HD-TiO2 NSs by using the GO as the sacrificial template. In the presence of GO template, the TBOT precursor was slowly hydrolyzed into the Ti(OH)4 intermediates in ethanol solution containing trace amounts of deionized water, which was highly dispersed on the surface of GO (Figure S1a) to construct GO@Ti(OH)4 composites (Figure S1b). After calcination in air, the Ti(OH)4 intermediates was further transformed into interconnected TiO2 nanoparticles and the GO template was removed, leading to the formation of graphene-like H-TiO2 NSs, which replicated the wrinkled nanosheet characteristic of the GO template (Fig. 1 b, Figure S1c and S1d). To further evaluate the template role of GO in the synthesis process, the carbon contents of the prepared samples was tested by elemental analysis (EA). The results show that GO@Ti(OH)4 contains 14.41 wt% carbon, but no carbon was detected in H-TiO2 NSs obtained after calcining GO@Ti(OH)4 in the air (Table S1), confirming that GO is completely removed during the calcination in air. Clear observation from the magnified transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image indicates that the graphene-like H-TiO2 NSs is composed of a large number of TiO2 interconnected nanoparticles (Fig. 1 c). A large number of mesopores with diameters of several nanometers were formed within the nanosheets, which is beneficial for exposure of more active sites and mass transport [38]. After hydrogenation process under H2/Ar atmosphere for 5 h, the graphene-like HD-TiO2-5h NSs with abundant oxygen vacancies were finally formed with the unchanged morphology as that of H-TiO2 NSs and also no carbon residue was detected (Fig. 1 d-f, Figure S1e-1f and Tab. S1). The HD-TiO2 NSs synthesized by other different hydrogenation time exhibit the similar holey nanosheet morphology as that of HD-TiO2-5h NSs (Figure S2). In contrast, the TiO2 bulk particles with lateral sizes of several micrometers were formed in the absence of GO template (Figure S3), indicating the key function of GO in the generation of HD-TiO2 NSs photocatalyst. HRTEM image was used to further characterize the detailed structure of the HD-TiO2-5h NSs. The lattice spacing of 0.359 nm can be indexed to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 1 g). A typical disordered layer with a thickness of around 1 nm was formed along the edges of the mesopore, indicating the generation of defective TiO2 with abundant surface oxygen vacancies [39]. This TiO2 holey nanosheet structure with largely exposed surface is favorable for the formation of disordered layer. This unique holey structure was further validated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The presence of adsorption hysteresis at medium pressure in the nitrogen sorption isotherms of HD-TiO2-5h NSs indicates the existence of mesoporous structure (Figure S4a) [40]. The BET surface area of the HD-TiO2-5h NSs is measured to be 63.91 m2 g−1, which is much higher than 30.54 m2 g−1 of the bulk TiO2. The pore size distribution curve of the HD-TiO2-5h NSs (Figure S4b) exhibits a sharp peak at 9.58 nm, which is in consistent with the TEM result. However, no obvious mesoporous structure was observed in the pore size distribution curve of the bulk TiO2. These results indicate the successful synthesis of the TiO2 holey nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies by the GO sacrificial template strategy. The crystal structure of the HD-TiO2 NSs samples of different hydrogenation time was investigated by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2 a, all the diffraction peaks of the HD-TiO2 NSs can be ascribed to the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 89-4921). No other phases or impurities were introduced in the main crystal structure after hydrogenation. Moreover, the survey XPS spectrum of HD-TiO2 NSs indicates the existence of Ti and O elements in the sample (Figure S5). The chemical state of surface elements of the samples was further analyzed by high-resolution XPS spectra. Two peaks of Ti 2p spectrum for the H-TiO2 NSs with binding energies of 458.64 and 464.37 eV can be ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 (Fig. 2 b) [41]. Interestingly, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of HD-TiO2-5h NSs both shifted 0.3 eV toward the low binding energy, which was due to the formation of oxygen vacancy and resulted in the capture of free electrons by Ti species [42]. However, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of D-TiO2 is only negatively shifted by 0.11 eV relative to Bulk TiO2, indicating that only a small amount of oxygen vacancies were formed after hydrogenation [43]. This result indicates that the introduction of holey nanosheets structure is an effective strategy to maximize the oxygen vacancies concentration. The O 1s peaks in Fig. 2 c can be divided into three groups for both samples, i.e., lattice oxygen (denoted as OL) (529.80 eV), oxygen atoms in vicinity of oxygen vacancies (denoted as OV) (531.18 eV), and chemisorbed oxygen species from water molecular (531.81 eV) (denoted as OW) [44–47], respectively. The atomic ratio relationship between O and Ti elements can be calculated with the peak areas and atomic sensitivity factors [48–51]. The calculation details and spectral features parameters of XPS are shown in Equation S1 and Table S2-5. For the Bulk TiO2, the ratio of OV in oxygen species calculated by the peak area is only 3.92%. The calculated atomic ratio of O and Ti elements is 2.12, which is higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 2, probably due to the adsorption of water and oxygen species on the TiO2 surface [52]. The atomic ratio of O and Ti elements of D-TiO2 decreases to 2.07, indicating the loss of oxygen and the formation of oxygen vacancies after hydrogenation [53]. This result was further confirmed by an increase in the OV ratio to 7.47%. Surprisingly, the OV ratio of HD-TiO2-5h NSs was significantly increased from 4.73% to 12.65% compared with H-TiO2 NSs, and the element ratio of O to Ti decreased sharply from 2.29 to 2.13. This indicates that the holey nanosheets structure is conducive to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancy after hydrogenation compared with bulk TiO2. To further verify the effectiveness of this strategy, EPR was employed to determine the relative concentration of oxygen vacancies in the samples (Fig. 2 d) [54]. It can be found that the H-TiO2 NSs and Bulk TiO2 samples have almost no obvious resonance signal. In contrast, a strong signal peak at g=2.002 ascribed to the unpaired electrons is observed in series HD-TiO2 NSs, indicating that the surface oxygen vacancies were introduced into H-TiO2 NSs by hydrogenation [55]. However, D-TiO2 only shows a weak EPR peak at g=2.002, indicating that D-TiO2 has a low oxygen vacancy concentration [56]. This suggests that the holey structure with more edge sites is more conducive to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the peak strength of EPR is improved with the increase of hydrogenation time in the preparation process, indicating that this strategy can accurately control the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The surface defect structures of the samples were also verified by Raman spectra. As exhibited in Fig. 2 e, six Raman activity modes of anatase are respectively located at 144 cm−1 (Eg(1)), 197 cm−1 (Eg(2)), 639 cm−1 (Eg(3)), 399 cm−1 (B1g(2)), 519 cm−1 (E1g(2)), and 513 cm−1 (A1g) [57]. The six characteristic peaks of the tested samples were agreement with the typical anatase perfectly. However, the strong Eg (1) mode of series HD-TiO2 NSs are significantly shifted towards the high frequency, indicating that the symmetrical O-Ti-O bonds are distorted and destroyed (Fig. R1e, inset) [58]. It is generally accepted that the degree of shift of Eg (1) mode is positively correlated with the concentration of oxygen vacancies [59]. Therefore, D-TiO2 shows the minimum positive shift, indicating that Bulk TiO2 is not conducive to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies [60]. The Eg (1) mode of series HD-TiO2 NSs shift to the higher frequency gradually as the extension of the hydrogenation time, which was consistent with the EPR results. In conclusion, the holey nanosheets structure with more edge sites is conducive to the maximization of oxygen vacancies concentration after hydrogenation."
11,Optical and electronic properties,"3.2 Optical and electronic properties The light absorption properties and band gap of the as-prepared HD-TiO2 NSs samples were investigated by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the bulk TiO2 and H-TiO2 NSs without the surface defects only show UV light absorption. The D-TiO2 and HD-TiO2 NSs photocatalysts show an enhanced visible light absorption owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies narrows the band gap [39]. Specifically, the band gap of the Bulk TiO2, D-TiO2, H-TiO2 NSs and HD-TiO2-5h NSs samples calculated by the Tauc equation (αhv = A (hv - Eg)n/2) were to be 3.01, 2.69, 3.02 and 2.53 eV, respectively (Fig. 3 a, inset). Compared with Bulk TiO2 and H-TiO2 NSs, D-TiO2 and HD-TiO2-5h NSs with oxygen vacancies have narrower band gaps, which is beneficial to broaden the optical response range and generate more photogenerated carriers [61]. The valance band of the Bulk TiO2, D-TiO2, H-TiO2 NSs and HD-TiO2-5h NSs samples were calculated to be 2.38, 1.96, 2.40, and 1.65 eV from XPS valence band (Fig. 3 b). By combined with the analysis results of valence band and band gap, we obtained the corresponding band structure of the samples (Fig. 3 c). HD-TiO2-5h NSs shows the most negative CB position, indicating that HD-TiO2-5h NSs has a higher reduction potential. This is conducive to the enhancement of water reduction capacity and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance [62]. To confirm the improved charge separation and transfer efficiency of the as-prepared HD-TiO2 NSs, PL, photocurrent response, and EIS characterizations were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3 d, the PL intensities of the H-TiO2 NSs are greatly suppressed compared to the Bulk-TiO2 and its defected counterpart (D-TiO2) possibly due to its long charge diffusion distance in these large TiO2 particles. For the H-TiO2 NSs and HD-TiO2 NSs samples, the intensities of PL are significantly decreased owing to the holey nanosheet structure feature with short charge diffusion distance which is beneficial for the charge separation and transfer. Compared with the H-TiO2 NSs, the HD-TiO2 NSs samples showed a slight decreased PL intensity, which indicates that the introduction of oxygen vacancies could inhibit the charge carriers recombination. The photocurrent response measurement results show that the HD-TiO2 NSs photocatalyst exhibited significantly enhanced current density compared with those of Bulk-TiO2 andH-TiO2 NSs (Fig. 3 e). Specifically, the HD-TiO2-5h NSs exhibits the highest photocurrent density, which is consistent with the result of the photocatalytic activity. The arc radius in the EIS result of the HD-TiO2-5h NSs is the smallest among the tested photocatalysts, indicating a smallest charge-transfer resistance on the electrode surface and an efficient charge carrier separation in the HD-TiO2-5h NSs photocatalyst (Fig. 3 f). Overall, the enhanced charge carrier separation and transfer efficiency in the HD-TiO2 NSs can be attributed to the unique holey porous 2D nanosheet structure with rich oxygen vacancies which facilitate the photogenerated carriers separation as well as the short charge diffusion distance which contributes to the fast transfer charge carriers."
12,Photocatalytic activity and stability,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity and stability The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the HD-TiO2 NSs samples was measured under simulated solar light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4 a and b, owing to the low surface area and oxygen vacancies concentration, the bulk TiO2 and the corresponding defected bulk TiO2 (D-TiO2) exhibited low photocatalytic H2 production activities of 0.15 and 0.34 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, respectively. In contrast, the H-TiO2 NSs showed a much higher photocatalytic H2 production activity of 3.17 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, which can be mainly ascribed to improved charge separation efficiency in the 2D holy porous nanosheet structure. When the oxygen vacancies defects were introduced into the 2D holy porous nanosheeet, the photocatalytic activities were further significantly improved. The HD-TiO2-3h NSs exhibited a high hydrogen evolution rate of 6.67 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, and this photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was increased as the prolonging of the hydrogenation time. It can be seen that the HD-TiO2-5h NSs exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity (Fig. 4 a,b) with a hydrogen evolution rate of 8.99 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, which is 2.83 times higher than that of H-TiO2 NSs catalyst. This result confirms that the introduction of rich oxygen vacancies into the H-TiO2 NSs is responsible for the high photocatalytic activity. However, when the concentration of the oxygen vacancies exceeded the optimal value, it will be detrimental to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the HD-TiO2-6h NSs is decreased to 6.02 mmol•g‒1•h‒1. This is because that the excess surface defects will act as the charge recombination centers, which was proved by the photocurrent response and EIS analytical results. The QE value of HD-TiO2-5h NS under 365 nm bandpass filter is calculated to be 63.94% (Table. S6), which is much higher than that of H-TiO2 NS (16.20%), Bulk TiO2 (0.53%) and D-TiO2 (2.47%) at 365 nm (Table. S7-9). This indicates that the synergy between holey nanosheets structure and oxygen vacancies is the main reason for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Notably, the QE values of HD-TiO2-5h NS under 420, 450, 500 and 550 nm bandpass filter are calculated to be 2.26%, 0.14%, 0.07% and 0.04%, respectively. However, H-TiO2 NS, Bulk TiO2 and even D-TiO2 with a small amount of oxygen vacancy did not detect the production of H2 under the corresponding single wavelength light irradiation. This suggests that introducing abundant oxygen vacancies at the active edge sites of holey nanosheets is an effective strategy to expand the photoresponse range of photocatalyst [63] It is worth noting that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of present HD-TiO2-5h NSs is superior to the many other reported hydrogenated defected TiO2 or holey TiO2 photocatalyst (Table. S10), corroborating that construction of holey porous nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancy is an effective strategy to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 catalyst. Based on the above results, we can summarize the advantage of the present 2D defected holey TiO2 nanosheets in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. As shown in Fig. 4 c, in comparison with the traditional TiO2 NSs without holey structure, the present HD-TiO2 NSs with abundant oxygen vacancies could maximize the concentration of exposed active sites. Secondly, the holey structure could improve the charge/mass transport capabilities, which can accelerate the photocatalytic reaction kinetics. Thirdly, the absorption edge of TiO2 was redshifted by the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for the solar energy capture. In addition, the oxygen vacancies could introduce a larger density of electron donor density to accelerate the charge migration and act as the active sites to boost the photocatalytic water splitting [64]. Thus, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of HD-TiO2 NSs can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of ultra and holey structure and the introduction of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 nanosheets. The photocatalytic stability of the HD-TiO2-5h NSs catalyst was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 d, after five time cycles, the HD-TiO2-5h NSs exhibit a high photocatalytic activity of 8.42 mmol•g‒1•h‒1, which is 93.8% as high as the initial activity (8.99 mmol•g‒1•h‒1). The structure of the recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs was also confirmed by the TEM. As shown in Fig. 5 a, it can be found that the recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs catalyst still keep the 2D porous nanosheets structure after hydrogen production cycle for 25 h. The XRD spectra proved that there is no obvious crystal phase change can be observed between fresh and recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs, and the anatase type crystal phase was still maintained (Fig. 5 b). XPS was used to further obtain the composition and chemical state information of the recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs. No obvious shift was observed on the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs, indicating that the chemical state of Ti species on the surface of recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs did not change significantly (Fig. 5 c). The oxygen vacancies on the surface were basically retained, and OV still retained a relatively high proportion (12.41%) after the cycle (Fig. 5 d) (Table. S11). The slightly increased O and Ti element ratio may be due to the increase of oxygen species adsorbed by HD-TiO2-5h NSs from water molecules during the hydrogen evolution reaction (The area ratio of OW increased from 8.53% to 10.45%) [65–67]. No shift was observed in the enlarge Eg (1) mode of recycled HD-TiO2-5h NSs relative to fresh HD-TiO2-5h NSs (Fig. 5e, inset), indicating that the oxygen vacancies concentration was almost unchanged before and after the cycle. EPR spectra further confirms this conclusion. The EPR peaks of recycled fresh HD-TiO2-5H NSs almost coincide with each other (Fig. 5 f), indicating that oxygen vacancies can stably exist on the surface of HD-TiO2-5H NSs. These results indicate the remarkable stability of the present holey TiO2 nanosheet photocatalysts."
13,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have successfully prepared the HD-TiO2 NSs with mesopores and abundant surface oxygen vacancies by using a GO-mediated sacrificial template strategy. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of surface oxygen vacancies and unique holey structural features, the hydrogen evolution efficiency of this HD-TiO2-5h NSs is up to 8.99 mmol•g‒1•h‒1 under simulated solar light irradiation, which is 2.83 times higher than that of H-TiO2 NSs catalyst and 26.8 times higher than that of defective TiO2 bulk counterpart. The photocatalytic activity of the present HD-TiO2 NSs is superior to many other reported defected TiO2-based photocatalysts. This work presents an effective strategy for promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity by designing defected 2D holey nanosheet photocatalysts. Further work will be focused on the construction of heterojunction photocatalyst such as II-type or Z-scheme systems by using this HD-TiO2 NSs material for efficient photocatalytic applications in water splitting and CO2 reduction."
