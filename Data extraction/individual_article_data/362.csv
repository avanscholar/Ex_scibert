0,Introduction,"Benzyl alcohol is a commercially important chemical (with a projected production of 60 kt in 2011 [1]), employed as a solvent for inks, paints, lacquers and as precursor for the manufacture of a range of esters in the cosmetics and flavoring industries [2]. The standard industrial production route has involved the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride in alkaline media but the associated production of dibenzyl ether with chlorine release represent serious drawbacks that have now limited the applicability of this approach [3]. Two alternative catalytic routes, generally in liquid phase, are: (i) oxidation of toluene, typically over vanadia [4]; (ii) disproportionation of benzaldehyde (Cannizzaro reaction) over irreducible basic oxides such as MgO [5]. The oxidation route generates significant quantities of benzoic acid and benzaldehyde, requiring additional downstream separation/purification, while the use of additives (such as sodium bromide) to increase yield and/or avoid formation of by-products results in reactor corrosion [6]. The Cannizzaro reaction has not been studied to any significant extent and the low rates achieved (0.2 molalcohol molMgO h-1) have prevented commercial implementation. The catalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde represents an alternative, which has now been promoted using transition metals (Pt, Pd, Ru and Ni) supported on oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2 and SiO2), largely in the liquid phase (T =295–405K; P =1–60atm) [7-10] but with limited gas phase [11-13] application. However, C=O hydrogenation selectivity is challenging and has not exceeded 80% over Group VIII metals due to a catalysed hydrogenolysis to generate toluene and benzene [7]. Moreover, catalyst deactivation from coke deposition has been a common feature of the catalysts tested to date [9]. In gas phase operation, activity has been related to the strength of reactant interaction while selectivity is governed by the competitive adsorption of benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol [14]. Where benzaldehyde is strongly held on the surface, e.g. in the presence of strong basic sites, benzene formation is preferred [15]. The use of reducible oxides (TiO2, ZrO2 or CeO2) favours interaction via the hydroxyl oxygen with the resultant generation of toluene, whereas benzyl alcohol interaction with irreducible supports is limited [11]. Moreover, a high surface capacity for hydrogen uptake (including spillover) is associated with increased activity and selectivity to toluene [12]. In this report, we consider, for the first time, the use of supported Au to promote the selective hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the reverse reaction (oxidation of benzyl alcohol) has been studied over Au (on TiO2 and Al2O3) at elevated pressures (up to 147atm) with a higher selectivity (close to 100%) to benzaldehyde than that obtained with Pt and Pd catalysts [16]. Catalysis by Au has attracted appreciable research activity as demonstrated in the review by Hutchings et al. [17] but the work to date has largely dealt with oxidation reactions involving CO, alcohol, aldehyde, and diol reactants [18]. By comparison, Au promoted hydrogenation has not been considered to the same extent, focusing largely on the conversion of ketones, aldehydes and nitroarenes [19]. Although supported Au delivers lower hydrogenation rates than conventional transition metal catalysts (e.g. Pd, Pt and Ni), enhanced performance in terms of selectivity and stability has been reported, notably in the hydrogenation of aldehydes to alcohols (e.g. crotonaldehyde, citral, acrolein) [20]. Moreover, there is some evidence [21] that edge sites on Au nanoparticles favour C=O adsorption/activation and hydrogenation. In this report, we link critical Au/Al2O3 characterisation results with benzaldehyde hydrogenation data in continuous flow gas phase operation and compare performance with Ni/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst Preparation and Activation,"2.1 Catalyst Preparation and Activation Au/Al2O3 (1.1% w/w) was prepared by standard impregnation of Al2O3 (5g, Puralox, Condea Vista Co.) with an aqueous HAuCl4 solution (Aldrich, 7.3×10-3 M). The slurry was heated at 2K min-1 to 353K under vigorously stirring (ca. 600rpm) and maintained in a He purge. The solid residue was dried in He at 2K min-1 to 383K for 3h, sieved into a batch of 75μm average particle diameter and stored under He at 278K (in the dark). The Au loading was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista-PRO, Varian Inc.). For comparative purposes, Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation with Pd(NO3)2 and Ni(NO3)2 [22], were employed as reference catalysts. Prior to use in catalysis, Au/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 were activated in 60cm3 min-1 H2 at 2K min-1 to a final temperature in the range 473–723K. The samples were passivated in 1% v/v O2/He at room temperature for ex situ analysis."
3,Catalyst Characterization,"2.2 Catalyst Characterization Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and BET surface area analysis were conducted using the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit. The Au/Al2O3 sample was loaded into a U-shaped Quartz cell (10cm×3.76mm i.d.) and heated in 17cm3 min-1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% v/v H2/N2 at 2K min-1 to 473±1K. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap and changes in H2 consumption were monitored by TCD with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software. The reduced sample was maintained at the final temperature in a constant flow of H2/N2 until the TCD signal returned to baseline, swept with 65cm3 min-1 flow N2 for 1.5h and cooled to room temperature. The sample was then subjected to H2 chemisorption using a pulse (10μl) titration procedure. Hydrogen pulse introduction was repeated until the signal area was constant, indicating surface saturation. In a series of blank tests, chemisorption measurements on the alumina support did not result in any hydrogen uptake. BET area was recorded with a 30% v/vN2/He flow using pure N2 (99.9%) as internal standard. At least 3 cycles of N2 adsorption-desorption in the flow mode were employed to determine total surface area using the standard single point method. BET surface area and H2 uptake values were reproducible to within±5%; the values quoted represent the mean. UV–vis spectra of the HAuCl4 aqueous solution and Au/Al2O3 were obtained using, respectively, a Spectronic Unicam HEλIOS β UV–vis Spectrophotometer and a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV–vis Spectrometer (with BaSO4 powder as reference). Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The sample was scanned at a rate of 0.02° step-1 over the range 20°≤2θ≤80°. Diffractograms were identified using the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. Al2O3 (10–0425) and Au (04–0784). Metal particle size (d hkl ) was estimated using the Scherrer equation: (1) d hkl = K × λ β × cos θ where K =0.9, λ is the incident radiation wavelength (1.5056Å), β is the peak width at half the maximum intensity and θ represents the diffraction angle corresponding to the main plane associated with metallic Au (2θ =38.1°). Au particle morphology and size were also determined by transmission electron microscopy analysis; JEOL JEM 2011 HRTEM unit with a UTW energy dispersive X-ray detector (Oxford Instruments) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV using Gatan DigitalMicrograph 3.4 for data acquisition/manipulation. The sample for analysis was prepared by dispersion in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300 Mesh). The mean Au particle size is given as a surface area-weighted mean (d TEM ) according to: (2) d TEM = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i and Σ n i =650. Characterisation details for the Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts have been published previously [22]."
4,Catalysis Procedure,"2.3 Catalysis Procedure Reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure at T =393K, in situ immediately after activation, in a fixed bed vertical glass tubular reactor (60cm×15mm i.d.). The catalytic reactor and operating conditions to ensure negligible heat/mass transport limitations, have been fully described elsewhere [23] but some features, pertinent to this study, are given below. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone, ensuring that the organic reactant was vaporized and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst. Isothermal conditions (± 1K) were ensured by diluting the catalyst bed with ground glass (75μm). The reaction temperature was continuously monitored using a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. Benzaldehyde (or benzyl alcohol) as a solution in ethanol was delivered at a fixed calibrated flow rate to the reactor via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). A co-current flow of benzaldehyde (or benzyl alcohol) and ultra pure H2 (<1% v/v organic in H2) was maintained at a GHSV =2×104 h-1 with an inlet reactant molar flow (F)=4.8×10-5 molh-1. The H2 content was up to 3000 times in excess of the stoichiometric requirement, the flow rate of which was monitored using a Humonics (Model 520) digital flowmeter. The molar metal to inlet molar organic feed rate (n/F) ratio spanned the range 5×10-3–88×10-3 h. In a series of blank tests, passage of reactant in a stream of H2 through the empty reactor or over the Al2O3 support did not result in any detectable conversion. A flow of benzaldehyde in a stream of He over Au/Al2O3 generated traces quantities of benzyl alcohol via disproportionation [5] where the amount produced was less than 3% of that formed by selective hydrogenation under the same reaction conditions. The reactor effluent was frozen in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis, which was made using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionization detector, employing a DB-1 50m×0.33mm i.d., 0.20μm film thickness capillary column (J&W Scientific). Benzaldehyde (Fluka, ≥ 98% w/w purity), benzyl alcohol (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99% w/w purity) and ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, ≥ 99% v/v) were used without further purification. Fractional benzaldehyde conversion (x) is defined by (3) x = b e n z a l d e h y d e in − b e n z a l d e h y d e out b e n z a l d e h y d e in where the subscripts “out” and “in” refer to the outlet and inlet gas streams, respectively. Selectivity in terms of benzyl alcohol as the target product is given by (4) S b e n z y l a l c o h o l % = b e n z y l a l c o h o l out b e n z a l d e h y d e in − b e n z a l d e h y d e out × 100 Repeated reactions with the same batch of catalyst delivered a product composition that was reproducibility to within±3%."
5,Results and Discussion,
6,Catalyst Characterization,"3.1 Catalyst Characterization The UV–vis spectrum recorded for the Au precursor solution is presented in Fig. 1A where the band at ca. 385nm can be attributed to Au3+ [24]. The TPR of the Au/Al2O3 precursor generated the profile shown in Fig. 1B, which is characterised by a single peak with T max =415K. A single step reduction of cationic gold (Au3+) to the zero valent state has been recorded elsewhere for Au/Al2O3 prepared by deposition-precipitation at 436K [25] and 490K [26]. Moreover, hydrogen consumption during TPR (Table 1 ) matched that required for the reduction of the precursor to the metallic form. It should be noted that both cationic (Au+ and Au3+) [27] and metallic [28] gold have been proposed as the active species in hydrogenation reactions. The BET surface area for Au/Al2O3 (Table 1) was lower than that of the starting Al2O3 support (172m2 g-1), suggesting partial pore filling by the metal component [11]. The UV–vis spectrum (Fig. 1C) of the activated catalyst exhibits an absorption band with maximum intensity (A max ) at ca. 545nm characteristic of zero valent gold [25]. The wavelength corresponding to maximum band intensity is dependent on Au dispersion with a shift to lower wavelengths with decreasing Au particle size. The value quoted in this work is close that reported in the literature [25] for highly dispersed Au/Al2O3 (A max =540nm; d =4nm) suggesting the presence of Au nano-particles. The UV response is consistent with a supported Au0 phase post-TPR. The XRD profile (Fig. 1D) presents peaks at 2θ =45.7° and 66.7° that correspond, respectively, to the (400) and (440) planes of cubic γ-Al2O3, where the broadness of the peaks is indicative of short range order. In addition, peaks at 2θ =38.1°, 44.3°, 64.6° and 77.5° can be assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of metallic Au. Standard X-ray line broadening analysis based on the Scherrer formula (Eq. (1)) yields a mean Au particle size of 8.5nm (Table 1). Representative (A) medium and (B) high magnification TEM images of Au/Al2O3 are given in Fig. 2 , which reveal discrete Au particles at the nano-scale that exhibit a quasi-spherical morphology. The diffractogram pattern for an isolated Au particle is included as an inset in Fig. 2B where the associated d-spacings (0.20/0.23) are consistent with the (200) and (111) planes of metallic gold (0.204/0.235nm). Although the nature of hydrogen/Au interactions has yet to be conclusively established, the consensus that emerges from the literature [29] suggests that chemisorption occurs predominantly at step, edge and corner sites, which are more prevalent on smaller particles. Moreover, a well dispersed Au phase at the nano-scale (<10nm) is required in order to optimize the catalytic response. A total count of 650 Au particles delivered a surface area-weighted metal diameter (d TEM , Table 1) of 7.9nm which is in good agreement with that obtained from XRD analysis."
7,Catalytic Activity/Selectivity,"3.2 Catalytic Activity/Selectivity The temporal dependence of benzaldehyde fractional hydrogenation (x) over Au/Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 3A where a time invariant (for 6h on-stream) conversion is in evidence. Benzaldehyde hydrogenation over Au/Al2O3 generated benzyl alcohol as the sole product, i.e. 100% selective in promoting exclusive carbonyl group reduction to the alcohol. Reaction selectivity is challenging in benzaldehyde hydrogenation as a range of intermediates and by-products are possible as shown in Fig. 4 , which includes all the reaction pathways that have been proposed in the literature [5,7,10,12,13,30,31]; step I represents the target reduction of the carbonyl function. In both liquid and gas phase operation, catalytic hydrogenolysis with the formation of toluene and benzene is promoted [5,13]. It has been proposed [5] that benzene is formed directly from benzaldehyde (step II) while toluene can result from the subsequent conversion of the alcohol (step III) and hydrogenolysis of benzaldehyde (step IV). Saadi and co-workers [12] isolated methylcyclohexane as a result of the further reduction of toluene (step V) during the gas phase hydrogenation of benzaldehyde over Ni/Al2O3. In liquid phase operation over Ru/C, hydrogenation of the aromatic ring (steps VI and VII) generated hexahydro-benzaldehyde [30] and cyclohexylmethanol [10] from benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol, respectively. The nature of the solvent can influence both activity and selectivity [13] where the use of ethanol has resulted in benzaldehyde diethyl acetal formation by reaction with benzaldehyde (step VIII) and benzyl ethyl ether, formed from both benzaldehyde (step IX) and benzyl alcohol (step X) [7,31]. In our exclusive production of benzyl alcohol from benzaldehyde over Au/Al2O3, etherification of the reactant and/or product with the solvent (ethanol) did not occur and there was no detectable hydrogenolysis to generate toluene and/or benzene. Benzaldehyde reaction kinetics have been reported for both liquid [8,9] and gas phase [11,12] operation. The applicability of a pseudo-first order kinetic treatment can be tested using the relationship [32] (5) ln ( 1 − x 0 ) − 1 = k n F where x 0 represents the initial fractional conversion and n/F has the physical meaning of contact time. The linear relationship between ln(1-x 0 )-1 and n/F, shown in Fig. 3B, confirms adherence to pseudo-first order behaviour and the associated specific rate constant (k) is given in Table 2 . In order to explore the potential of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst, we employed Ni/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 as benchmark catalysts. The activities given in Table 2 are in good agreement with values quoted in the literature [9,12,33] where both Pd and Ni catalysts delivered higher (by a factor up to 6) hydrogenation rates relative to Au. A lower hydrogenation activity for supported Au can be attributed to the higher energy barrier for H2 dissociation [34]. Hydrogen uptake (at ambient temperature) on Au/Al2O3 was significantly lower than that measured for Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 (Table 2). In terms of sustainable processing, the initial reaction rate is not the only consideration and catalyst lifetime must also be addressed. This feature was investigated for reaction over a prolonged period (15h) and the results are presented in Fig. 5 , where temporal conversion is related to the initial value. While Au/Al2O3 largely retained the initial level of conversion (x 15h /x 0 = ca. 0.9), Ni/Al2O3 exhibited a drastic immediate decline in activity to deliver negligible conversion after 3h on-stream while Pd/Al2O3 showed a continual decrease that was particularly marked at extended times (> 8h on-stream). A temporal catalyst deactivation during benzaldehyde hydrogenation has been observed previously, attributed to coke deposition and associated with toluene formation [9]. Initial reaction selectivities (S 0 ) are presented in Table 2. In common with Au/Al2O3, reaction over Pd/Al2O3 or Ni/Al2O3 did not result in any aromatic ring hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis to form benzene or reactant etherification/acetalisation. Reaction exclusivity to benzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3 was maintained over extended time on-stream (see Table 2). The formation of benzyl alcohol (from benzaldehyde) has been proposed to occur via a nucleophilic mechanism where the carbonyl function is activated at the metal/support interface [11]. Adsorption of benzaldehyde where both the aromatic ring and carbonyl group are co-planar to the surface facilitates C=O polarization, rendering the oxygen susceptible to nucleophilic attack with proton transfer to generate the alcohol [35]. The nature of the metal/support interface and the degree of metal dispersion are considered to be critical in determining benzyl alcohol formation [11]. Initially, toluene was the principal product resulting from reaction over Pd/Al2O3 with a low selectivity (10%) to benzyl alcohol while Ni/Al2O3 generated toluene as the only product. These selectivity trends find general agreement with the literature [7,9,12,23]. Initial selectivities to benzyl alcohol of 20-40% [9] and 10-20% [12] have been reported for Pd/Al2O3 (in liquid phase) and Ni/Al2O3 (in gas phase, T =383–413K), respectively. Toluene production from benzaldehyde is favoured by a strong interaction between the carbonyl oxygen and the surface with hydrogenolytic cleavage of C=O by dissociated hydrogen (Fig. 4, step IV) [14]. In order to probe the possible reaction pathway, the conversion of benzyl alcohol under the same reaction conditions was considered and the results are included in Table 2. The rate constants generated for the alcohol feed were consistently lower than those obtained for the reaction of benzaldehyde and this can be attributed to the electrophilic character of C=O which renders this functionality more reactive relative to O-H [13]. Transformation of benzyl alcohol to toluene (Fig. 4, step III) has been proposed to proceed via adsorption/activation on the support (formation of a benzoate on Al2O3) and reaction with hydrogen from the metal site [35]. The rate of toluene production over Ni/Al2O3 from benzaldehyde was significantly higher (by a factor of 2) than that obtained from benzyl alcohol and path IV (Fig. 4) can be taken to be the predominant route to toluene. The rate of conversion of benzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3 was two orders of magnitude lower than benzaldehyde hydrogenation; trace quantities of benzene were detected. The low reactivity of the alcohol on Au/Al2O3 must contribute to reaction exclusivity with respect to the benzaldehyde→benzyl alcohol step. In the case of Pd/Al2O3, benzyl alcohol conversion generated toluene as the sole product. The temporal decline in activity exhibited by Pd/Al2O3 during benzaldehyde conversion was accompanied by a switch in selectivity from toluene as the predominant product to benzyl alcohol. This response indicates a temporal inhibition of steps III and IV, limiting hydrogenolysis, while reaction via step I proceeds, resulting in the preferential production of benzyl alcohol. Ultimately, hydrogenation step (I) is limited with a residual conversion recorded after 15h on-stream. There was no detectable toluene formation in any reaction over Au/Al2O3, which represents a marked divergence in behaviour from both Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3. We attribute this response to fundamental differences in surface reactive hydrogen and arene reactant activation at the metal/support interface."
8,Conclusion,"We have established, for the first time, the viability of benzaldehyde hydrogenation over Au/Al2O3 as a sustainable alternative route to benzyl alcohol. The reaction has been conducted under relatively mild reaction conditions (393K, 1atm) in continuous flow gas phase operation where 100% selectivity with respect to benzyl alcohol was achieved and maintained for 15h on-stream. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of Au/Al2O3 to 473K generated a supported Au metal phase, as confirmed by XRD and UV–vis analyses, characterized by quasi-spherical particles with a surface weighted mean metal diameter=7.9nm. While Pd/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 delivered higher activity (under the same reaction conditions), both exhibited severe deactivation with time-on-stream and promoted hydrogenolysis to toluene. We attribute the exclusive selectivity achieved with Au/Al2O3 to a polarization of the C=O bond rendering the oxygen susceptible to nucleophilic hydrogen attack to generate the alcohol, which does not undergo further reaction."
