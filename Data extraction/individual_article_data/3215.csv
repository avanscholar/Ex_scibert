0,Introduction,"In the backdrop of looming energy crisis, as a result of depleting fossil fuel reserves coupled with the concerns for greenhouse gas emissions, initiatives to develop self-sustaining alternative energy sources have assumed paramount importance. Hydrogen is widely touted as an ultimate clean energy source. It has gained prominence over competing technologies such as ethanol and biofuels because of its ability to burn cleanly without by-product release and its efficient convertibility into electrical and thermal energy while supplied to a fuel cell. Biological processes are carried out largely at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressures, and hence are less energy intensive than chemical or electrochemical ones (Nath and Das, 2004). Unfortunately, hydrogen is presently produced mainly from the reforming of fossil materials (90% of worldwide production, representing 45billion tonnes) with a high level of pollution generated, i.e., 10tonnes CO2/tonnes H2 (Maddy et al., 2003). Several alternative hydrogen energy generation concepts and technologies are in vogue. The idea to produce hydrogen from microorganisms, such as bacteria and algae, via fermentation processes has re-gained tremendous interest in the recent years (Luo et al., 2010; Rupprecht, 2009). Biological hydrogen can be produced both by photosynthetic and fermentative microorganisms. However, none of the described microorganisms and proposed concepts led to a proven and long-term functioning industrial scale bio-hydrogen production system. One of the major deterrents of biohydrogen production processes for commercialization is their notoriously low hydrogen production rates particularly a low space time yield (STY) per unit volume."
1,Fermentative hydrogen production,"Hydrogen evolution by fermentation is common metabolism for bacteria. A large number of microbial species, including significantly different taxonomic and physiological types can produce hydrogen by fermentation. Almost 25% of genera listed in the Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th edition were recognized to evolve hydrogen, no matter what the amount of evolution. These include strict anaerobes such as clostridia (Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium welchii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium beijerincki), Rumen bacteria, hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, and facultative anaerobes like Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, or even some aerobes like Alcaligenes, Bacillus and so on. Apart from pure culture some co and mixed cultures have also been found to be efficient producers of molecular hydrogen. These have been extensively reviewed by several authors (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002; Nandi and Sengupta, 1998). Anaerobic fermentation enables the mass production of hydrogen via relatively simple processes not only from a wide spectrum of potentially utilizable substrates, but also from refuse and waste products (Ntaikou et al., 2009a,b; Kim and Lee, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Karlsson et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2009). Moreover, fermentative hydrogen production generally proceeds at a higher rate and does not rely on the availability of light sources (Nath and Das, 2004). Carbohydrates, mainly glucose, are the preferred carbon sources for fermentation process which predominantly give rise to acetic and butyric acids together with hydrogen gas (Classen et al., 1999). Modeling and optimization have been carried out in attempts to improve biohydrogen production. Biological production rate of hydrogen and its molar yield, like many other bioprocesses, are a function of several variables, including medium pH, temperature, substrate concentration and many more. Modeling and analysis could be used to determine the optimal values of the important relevant parameters. A variety of modeling methods have been developed that are broadly applicable to a spectrum of diverse fields, including engineering, biology, environmental science, food processing and industrial processing, and their application in biohydrogen (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). The first part of the review gives an overview of the kinetic models as applied in the prediction of microbial growth, product formation and degradation of organic substrate during fermentative hydrogen production. The second part deals with various experimental design methods used to investigate the effects of physico-chemical parameters on fermentative hydrogen production processes for its optimization. Several design strategies are briefly exposed, followed by the introduction of its analysis and application to the study of fermentative hydrogen production."
2,Modeling of the fermentative process,"Mathematical models can provide valuable information to analyze and predict the performance of biological hydrogen production by fermentation. Kinetic equations, which describe the activity of an enzyme or a microorganism on a particular substrate, are crucial in understanding many phenomena in biotechnological processes. It is important to gain an understanding of operations where time-variant influent concentrations and multiple substrates are encountered (Okpokwasili and Nweke, 2005). For an effective design and scale-up of the bioreactor, the definition of an appropriate kinetic model of the process is required. Modeling based on material balances for the process components of the H2-producing bioreactors requires the mathematical description of several distinct processes such as kinetics of microbial growth (biomass formation) and products (hydrogen, VFA, solvents, etc.) formation in the bioreactor, steady state behavior of organic substrate along with its utilization and inhibition (if any). Additionally a few models are developed to describe the effects of several physicochemical parameters like temperature, pH, dilution rate etc. on biohydrogen production using either batch or continuous mode of operations."
3,Kinetic models for microbial growth and substrate utilization,"3.1 Kinetic models for microbial growth and substrate utilization The biomass concentration in the batch hydrogen production experiments depends on the concentration in limiting substrate. Classical Monod equation empirically fits a wide range of data satisfactorily and is the most commonly applied unstructured, nonsegregated model of microbial growth to describe growth-linked substrate utilization (Shuler et al., 2002). The growth of microorganisms can be modeled by Monod equation. (1) μ = μ max S K s + S where μ is the specific growth rate, μ m is the maximum specific growth rate, K s is the saturation constant and S is the limiting substrate concentration. The values of μ max and K s are usually estimated following Monod model by regression analysis of Lineweaver–Burk linearized equation. The dependence of H2 production rate on limiting substrate (starch) concentration, in presence of mixed anaerobic microflora was simulated by Lee et al. (2008) using a Monod-type kinetic model: (2) v H 2 = v max, H 2 C starch K s + C starch where v max, H 2 is the maximum volumetric H2 production rate (ml/L/h), K s is half-saturation (Monod) constant (g COD/L) and C starch is starch concentration (g COD/L). But many of the authors reported that classical Monod model does not hold well for several instances the most dominant of which is inhibition due to high substrate concentration, pH, presence of certain salt concentrations, substrate diffusion, maintenance or effects of cell density on μ max etc. Hence a number of models are proposed for growth and substrate utilization of hydrogen producing organisms incorporating the additional parameters for substrate inhibition, pH inhibition and biomass decay constant. The inclusion of substrate inhibition factor in classical Monod equation stands out to be a necessity since many authors reported that values of the growth kinetic parameters could not simulate satisfactorily the experimental data from cultures with high substrate concentrations. Table 1 presents kinetic parameters for various classical and modified Monod models and M–M equations used in dark and light fermentation. The inhibitory nature of substrates at high concentrations is well known, and the kinetics of pure and mixed culture hydrogen producing microorganisms on carbon substrates have been described by a variety of substrate inhibition models (Nath et al., 2008; JianLong and Wei, 2008; Ntaikou et al., 2009). Most of these models are empirical. However, they are able to provide satisfactory description of substrate utilization data, thus providing a convenient means of modeling microbial growth and substrate utilization. Substrate inhibition model following Andrew’s equation was found suitable for hydrogen production using glucose as substrate in the first stage of a two stage fermentation process compared to the classical Monod model (Nath et al., 2008). The model suggests a non-linear relationship between the specific growth rate and substrate concentration. (3) μ = μ m S K s + S + S 2 / K I In addition, Nath et al. also compared the ability of classical Monod model and an Andrew model to describe the progress of glucose degradation and Enterobacter cloacae DM11 growth in batch tests and concluded that the latter was the most suitable one. However, there was little deviation between the experimental data and those predicted by the model which might be due to the assumption that Y x/s remained constant over the system irrespective of time of fermentation. Also, this was assumed by ignoring the effect of maintenance energy on cell growth and metabolism. JianLong and Wei (2008) fitted the Andrew’s model to describe the biohydrogen production from glucose by mixed microflora using digested sludge with estimated correlation coefficient (R 2) 0.902. (4) r = 67.1 S 47.7 + S + S 2 / 13.5 Notwithstanding the fact that the Andrew’s model has been widely used to describe the substrate inhibition, it does not adequately predict the nature of inhibition. A generalized Monod type model (Eq. (5)), originally proposed by Han and Levenspiel (1988) could probably better be used to account for substrate stimulation at low concentration and substrate inhibition at high concentration. (5) r = k ( 1 - S / S max ) n × S S + K S × ( 1 - S / S max ) m where r (mL/h) is the hydrogen production rate; k (mL/h) is the hydrogen production rate constant; S (g/L) is the substrate concentration; S max (g/L) is the maximum substrate concentration above which the fermentative hydrogen production stops; K S (g/L) is the saturation constant; m and n are the exponent constants the specific values of which determine the type of substrate inhibition such as non-competitive, competitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition. JianLong and Wei (2008) compared Andrews model and Han–Levenspiel model to fit the hydrogen production data and concluded that the latter could describe better the effect of substrate (glucose) concentration on hydrogen production rate. The study also revealed that inhibition of the fermentative hydrogen production by substrate at higher concentration was uncompetitive in nature as the values of n and m obtained from the fitting using Han–Levenspiel model were all positive. Monod-type kinetic expression, incorporating the empirical lower pH inhibition term I pH was put forward by a number of authors [Lin et al., 2007; Ntaikou et al., 2008, 2009]. (6) r Glu = q Glu max S Glu X K Glu + S Glu . I pH where X denotes biomass concentration, S Glu denotes residual glucose concentration, q Glu max denotes maximum specific glucose consumption rate, and K Glu represents saturation constant. Similar type of kinetic expression was used by Ntaikou et al. (2008) for the batch production of hydrogen from glucose and sweet sorghum biomass using Ruminococcus albus. However, together with pH inhibition coefficient (I pH) Ntaikou et al. (2008) modified the Monod equation with one additional term, biomass decay constant k d. (7) d x d t = μ max . S K S + S X . I pH - k d . X The growth of fermentative hydrogen producing R. albus on glucose was modeled by a modified Monod equation including both pH inhibition (I pH) and substrate inhibition (I S) factors (8) d s d t = - k m S K S + S . X . I pH . I S The factor I S of Eq. (8) is a function of S which describes non-competitive substrate inhibition according to Eq. (9) (9) I S = K . I S KI S + S where KI S is the value of substrate concentration when the substrate consumption rate is half of the maximum. The International Water Association (IWA) task group for mathematical modeling of anaerobic digestion processes developed the anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) to describe the stoichiometry and kinetics of reactions occurred in anaerobic processes (Batstone et al., 2002). The empirical lower pH inhibition term, I pH, according to the ADM1, was defined as (10) I pH = exp - 3 pH meas - pH UL pH UL - pH LL 2 where pHUL and pHLL denote the upper limit at which the acidogenic bacteria are not inhibited (I pH =1 when pH>pHUL ), and the lower limit at which inhibition is complete, respectively. In the ADM1, the values of pHUL and pHLL are recommended to be 5.5 and 4, respectively, for acidogenic bacteria. Penumathsa et al. (2008) presented a modification of the ADM1 using a variable stoichiometry approach, derived from experimental information in the continuous production of hydrogen from sucrose as substrate in a CSTR. The authors considered the concentration of undissociated acidic products as the main governing variable for the product yields (including VFAs and hydrogen) to describe fermentation of sugars in non-methanogenic anaerobic systems. The biomass and product yields from glucose degradation were assumed to be dynamically depending on the total concentration of undissociated acids in the reactor. Experimental data from an 11L mesophilic continuous bio-hydrogen reactor fed with 20, 40, 50 and 10g/L of sucrose, were used to validate the approach. The modified model achieved good predictions of the experimental data, using the standard ADM1 parameter values, without any parameter fitting beyond the implementation of the variable stoichiometry (Penumathsa et al., 2008). Gadhamshetty et al. (2010) compared the batch biohydrogen production using Gompertz equation and ADM 1 model. Experimental data from eight dark fermentation reactors varying in temperature, pressure release, biomass seed, and substrate were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the Gompertz equation and an ADM1-based model developed in this study. The authors maintained that Gompertz equation was limited by its inability to predict volatile fatty acid formation and substrate consumption, whereas the ADM1-based model was able to predict well not only the hydrogen profile, but also the COD, acetate, and butyrate. In contrast to the Gompertz equation, only one specific parameter per reactor had to be chosen in the case of the ADM1-based model (Gadhamshetty et al., 2010). It is noteworthy to state that since there are a good number of inhibition models to describe experimental data of microbial hydrogen production, it becomes difficult to compare kinetic parameters across different studies. This complicates the application of laboratory kinetic information in the design and scale up of biological hydrogen production via fermentation of either pure substrate or waste materials. Logistic equation and its modified version have also been used to describe the microbial growth during dark as well as light fermentation process for biohydrogen production (Nath et al., 2008; Wang and Wan, 2008c,d; Jianlong and Wei, 2008). The logistic equation for cell concentration for a batch reactor can be represented as (11) X = X 0 exp ( k c t ) 1 - X 0 X max ( 1 - exp ( k c t ) ) where k c is the apparent specific growth, X is the biomass concentration and X max is maximum biomass concentration. Notwithstanding the fact that the predictive power of logistic equation (Eq. (11)) is limited as it does not contain a substrate term, the logistic model is a fair approximation of representing the entire growth curve including the lag phase (if present), the exponential growth and the stationery phases (Mu et al., 2006a,b; Nath et al., 2008). In a study by Nath et al. (2008) hydrogen production by a two stage fermentation process, growth of Rhodobater sphaeroides OU 001 on spent medium in the second stage was modeled by Logistic equation. For initial acetic acid concentration of 2.5g/L in the spent medium the maximum specific growth rate was found to be 0.099h−1 using logistic model in the second stage. Jianlong and Wei (2008) used the modified Logistic model (Eq. (12)) to describe the progress of bacterial growth during fermentative hydrogen production by mixed cultures in batch tests using glucose as substrate (12) ∫ 0 t d X d t d t = X m 1 + exp [ 4 μ m ( λ - t ) / X m + 2 ] The coefficients of determination (R 2) of all the fittings were all over 0.99, which indicated that the modified Logistic model could describe the progress of cumulative hydrogen production in the batch tests adequately. In order to describe the true behavior of biological hydrogen production systems, it is imperative to obtain accurate estimates of the kinetic parameters in these models. The values of μ max and K S following Monod model are estimated by regression analysis of Lineweaver–Burk linearized equation. But the non-linearity of the modified Monod kinetic models and their integrated forms, as proposed by various workers renders parameter estimation relatively difficult. However, some of these models can be linearized. But the linearized expression may transform the error associated with the dependent variable making it not to be normally distributed, thus making parameter estimate inaccurate. Several authors (Nath et al., 2008; Whang et al., 2006) have used least square methods to estimate the kinetic parameters."
4,Kinetic models for product formation,"3.2 Kinetic models for product formation The products from fermentative biohydrogen processes are broadly grouped into two major categories. The first category is the gaseous products (primarily H2 and CO2), while the second group includes VFA and solvents. During hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation the distribution of the acidogenic products varies substantially. Moreover, some acidogenic products, e.g., acetate, butyrate, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, may form more complex long-chain fatty acids or alcohols as the hydrogen is consumed (Mu et al., 2006a,b). Modified Gompertz equation has been extensively used to describe the progress of hydrogen production and some soluble metabolite production in a batch fermentative hydrogen production process. The equation can be expressed as; (13) H ( t ) = P . exp - exp R m . e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H(t) represents cumulative volume of hydrogen production (ml), P the gas production potential (ml), R m (ml/h) the maximum production rate, l λ(h) the lag time, t incubation time (h) and e, the exp(1) 2:718. The typical cumulative hydrogen production curve can be nonlinearly modeled by the above equation. In a batch test, H increases very slowly with increasing cultivation time from 0 to l, and then increases rapidly almost at the rate of R m and finally reaches an asymptotic value P with further increasing the cultivation time (Wang and Wan, 2009a). Mu et al. (2006a,b) used the Modified Gompertz equation to model the production of hydrogen as well as butyrate and acetate, during a batch hydrogen production process by mixed anaerobic culture. (14) P i = P max, i exp - exp R max, i × e P max, i ( λ i - t ) + 1 where i represents hydrogen, butyrate and acetate, respectively; P i is the product i formed per liter of reactor volume at fermentation time t; P max,i is the potential maximum product formed per liter of reactor volume; R max,i is the maximum rate of product formed. Table 2 presents a summary of several recent studies where modified Gompertz equation has been used to model the cumulative production of biohydrogen. The relationship between biomass and the products for the anaerobic hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures can be modeled by the Luedeking–Piret model (Eq. (15)) or its modified version (Eq. (16)) (Mu et al., 2006a; Mu et al., 2006b; Lo et al., 2008; Obeid et al., 2009): (15) dp i dt = α i dx dt + β i X where α i is the growth-associated formation coefficient of product i; β i is non-growth-associated formation coefficient of product i. Lo et al. (2008) proposed a kinetic model based on growth associated products representing the correlation between hydrogen production and biomass gain. (16) 1 X d C H 2 d t = α μ = α 1 X d X d t where C H 2 represents H2 concentration (mol), X represents cell concentration (g VSS/L), and μ represents specific growth rate (h−1). By simplifying Eq. (16), the α value can be easily obtained from the slope of specific rate of C H 2 versus that of X plot during the exponential growth phase. The model fitted the data quite well (with an R 2 value of over 0.910) and the calculated a value was 0.041 and 0.039mol/g VSS for xylose and sucrose, respectively during fermentative hydrogen production using C. butyricum (strains CGS2 and CGS5), C. pasteurianum (strains CH1, CH4, CH5, and CH7). The effect of light intensity on hydrogen production by the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus was modeled by Obeid et al. (2009) by incorporating an additional factor into the Luedeking–Piret equation to take into consideration the light intensity effect. (17) d V H 2 d t = 1 Y X P φ ( I ) μ ( S ) X + β X where V H 2 is the volume of hydrogen produced at time and varphi ( I ) is the the yield of light energy (lux), Y x P the hydrogen production yield, and β the non-growth-associated formation coefficient of product."
5,Modeling of two-stage fermentation system,"3.3 Modeling of two-stage fermentation system Two-stage fermentation is one among variety of manipulations that have been proposed by various authors to improve hydrogen yields. There is a great deal of interest in this area at present and the results of many studies are appearing in the literature. Hallenbeck and Ghosh (2009) discussed several strategies for complete substrate conversion using two-stage systems. These include dark fermentation followed by photofermentation (Nath et al., 2008), dark fermentation followed by methane fermentation (Wang and Zhao, 2009; Cooney et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006) and dark fermentation followed by electrohydrogenesis. But all these processes have met with limited success in increasing the overall yield of biohydrogen appreciably. Wang and Zhao (2009) modeled an integrated two-stage fermentation system combining hydrogen and methane production for the treatment of food waste by anaerobic mixed microflora. The model based on mass balance equation for a two-stage process combined by a mesophilic hydrogen production reactor and a methane production reactor. The mass balance equation for each fermentation stage can be presented as: (18) V d c d t = m 0 c 0 - m 0 c + Vr ( c ) The rate of degradation of the substrates was assumed to follow first-order kinetics, thus the following equations were used to describe the H2/CH4 production and substrate degradation in semi-continuous operation (19) d c d t = r ( c ) = k . c The organic loading rate (kg VS/m3 d) (20) θ = c 0 kc t c 0 - c t Biogas yield (m3/kgVS) can be expressed as (21) y = μ k c t θ At steady state, the optimal OLR (organic loading rate) and SRT (solid retention time) for the integrated two-stage process were found to be 22.65kg VS/m3d (160h) for hydrogen fermentation reactor and 4.61 (26.67d) for methane fermentation reactor, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum yields of hydrogen (0.065m3H2/kg VS) and methane (0.546m3 CH4/kg VS) were achieved with the hydrogen and methane contents ranging from 29.42% to 30.86%, 64.33% to 71.48%, respectively (Wang and Zhao, 2009). Nath et al. (2008) reported two-stage fermentation as a combination of dark and photo fermentation. Spent medium from dark fermentation by E. cloacae DM11 was used to photoproduce hydrogen by R. sphaeroides O.U. 001 in a two-stage batch fermentation process. The yield of hydrogen in the first stage was about 3:31mol H2/(mol glucose) and that of in the second stage was about 1.5–1.72mol H2/(mol acetic acid). Substrate inhibition model following Andrew’s equation was used in the first stage of fermentation and a model based on logistic equation was used to describe the growth of R. sphaeroides O.U 001 in the second stage. Modified Gompertz equation was applied to estimate the hydrogen production potential, rate and lag phase time in a batch process for various initial concentration of glucose, based on the cumulative hydrogen production curves. Both the curve fitting and statistical analysis showed that the equation was suitable to describe the progress of cumulative hydrogen production (Nath et al., 2008). Three different models namely the single-substrate model without endogenous metabolism, the single substrate model with endogenous metabolism, and the dual substrate model with endogenous metabolism, were compared to describe the effects of dilution rates on the hydrogen production rate and the concentrations of glucose, peptone, biomass, ammonium nitrogen, formate, acetate, and butyrate in a continuous stirred tank reactor for hydrogen production (Whang et al., 2006). The model equations are stated below: Single-substrate model without endogenous metabolism: For glucose and peptone (22) DK SG μ G max - D For biomass, VFAs and alcohols (23) Y X / G S G 0 - DK SG μ G max - D Single substrate model with endogenous metabolism For glucose and peptone (24) ( D + k e ) K SG ( μ G max - D - k e ) For biomass, VFAs and alcohols (25) DY X / G ( S G 0 - S G ) α i X ( D + k e ) Dual substrate model with endogenous metabolism For glucose (26) ( D + k e ) K SG ( μ G max - D - k e ) For peptone (27) ( D + k e ) K SP ( μ P max - D - k e ) For biomass, VFAs and alcohols (28) DY X / G ( S G 0 - S G ) ( D + k e ) + DY X / P ( S P 0 - S P ) ( D + k e ) The simulation study of the above there models suggested that an increase in D from 0.06 to 0.69h−1 could minimize the adverse effects of endogenous and peptone metabolism on net hydrogen production. For the operational conditions of D >0.69h−1, however, washout of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the CSTR became substantial. Dual substrate model with endogenous metabolism provided a better understanding in anaerobic fermentation of glucose and peptone for hydrogen production compared to the single-substrate model without endogenous metabolism, the single substrate model with endogenous metabolism (Whang et al., 2006)."
6,Optimization of physico-chemical parameters,"Various strategies and methods for improving hydrogen production rates and yields have been under investigation for the past few decades. Many studies have been conducted on fermentative hydrogen production using pure and mixed culture with both pure substrate and various actual and simulated wastewaters. Results showed that a number of intervening process parameters, few of which are interdependent, play an important role, in the production rates and yields of hydrogen. Most widely studied important key parameters are probably substrate concentration, temperature and initial medium pH. In addition, there are certain other parameters like inoculum size, iron concentration, HRT, C/N and C/P ratio and so on. In spite of the fact that fermentative hydrogen production using carbohydrate substrates in general require similar conditions, there are significant variations in some of the parameters while establishing their suitable values, with respect to maximum hydrogen yield or its production rate, even at times with the same substrates and same microorganisms. Here comes the importance of optimization of the physico-chemical parameters of a biological hydrogen production, particularly with fermentative production. In addition, these methods could prove helpful in establishing process parameters for novel consortia or complex. Initial medium pH is one of the most important factors in hydrogen production, the effect of which has been extensively reported in literature. pH has significant effects on metabolic pathways, thus potentially modulating end product distribution, as well as possibly affecting the duration of the lag phase (Bartacek et al., 2007; Nath et al., 2006; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Hawkes et al., 2007; Saraphirom and Reungsang, 2010). The poor hydrogen production at low pH, lower than 5.0, is due to the increased formation of acidic metabolites, which destroys the cell’s ability to maintain internal pH (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985). It results in lowering the intracellular level of ATP, thereby, inhibiting glucose uptake. Nath et al. (2006) observed that the optimum pH for maximizing the rate of hydrogen production was dependent both on the type of microorganisms and the substrates used. Initial glucose concentration also has a substantial effect on the yield and production rate of hydrogen during the course of fermentation. Low initial glucose concentrations result in low rates of fermentation, and total fermentation times increase with high initial substrate concentrations (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010). The observation implies that the chances of formation of acid metabolites increase with high initial glucose concentration, whereby, pH drops appreciably and results in a lower rate of hydrogen production albeit at the cost of higher percent consumption of glucose (Nath et al., 2006). Moreover, temperature affects the maximum specific growth of the microorganism as well as substrate utilization rate during hydrogen fermentation. Thermal deactivation at higher temperatures leads to inactivation of the enzymes responsible for controlling metabolic pathways in the fermentative hydrogen production process."
7,Various optimization strategies,"4.1 Various optimization strategies Design of experiment (DOE) is a structured method by which certain factors are selected and deliberately varied in a controlled manner to obtain their effects on the output of a process, often followed by the analysis of the experimental results. It should predict the important parameters and the relationship between them. According to the number of the factors to be investigated at a time, the experimental design can be broadly classified into two categories: one-factor-at-a-time design (single-factor design) and factorial design (multiple-factor design) (Wang and Wan, 2009a). Additionally, there are several types of factorial design, namely full factorial and fractional factorial design that are extensively reviewed by Wang and Wan (2009a). A common and powerful DOE approach is afforded by factorial design (FD) combined with response surface methodology (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010). Principal component analysis and Genetic algorithm based on a neural network model approaches have also been used, to optimize the process parameters in fermentative hydrogen production. Basic principle and relative merits and demerits of various optimization strategies for biohydrogen production are briefly summarized in Table 3 . 4.1.1 One-factor-at-a-time optimization The traditional method of process optimization involves varying the level of one parameter at a time, while keeping the other parameters constant. There is large number of works in literature, reporting the effects of various parameters in batch as well as continuous or semicontinuous production of hydrogen. The most useful application in batch hydrogen production has been to determine the optimal operating conditions with regard to medium pH (Hamilton et al., 2010; Wang and Jin, 2009; Chittibabu et al., 2006; Nath et al., 2006), substrate concentration or organic loading rate (OLR) in case of wastewater treatment (Wang and wan, 2008a; Kim et al., 2006a,b; Wang and Jin, 2009), iron concentration (Hamilton et al., 2010; Wang and Wan, 2008b; Wang et al., 2007; Nath et al., 2006), temperature (Lin et al., 2008a,b; Mu et al., 2006a,b; Nath et al., 2006). However, for continuous or semicontinuous operations effect of some additional parameters like hydraulic retention time, dilution rate, and recycle ratio becomes significant in the production rate as well as yield of biohydrogen. Hydraulic retention time (HRT), which is the residence time of the liquid in a continuously fed reactor, has profound effect on hydrogen production rate in a continuous system. It controls the microbial growth rate and therefore should invariably be greater than the maximum growth rate of the organism(s), because faster dilution rates cause washout (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2010). Lin et al. (2008a,b) reported hydrogen production from anaerobically enriched paper mill sludge in a continuous fermenter operated at the HRTs of 12–2h. The bioactivity was enhanced with peak hydrogen yield (at HRT 12h), hydrogen production rate (at HRT 4h), of 1.5mol-H2/mol-hexose, 450mmol-H2/Ld (18.8mmol-H2/Lh), respectively. A shift in dominant hydrogen-producing microbial population along with HRT variation was observed with C. butyricum, C. pasteurianum, K. pneuminiae, Streptococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. being present at efficient hydrogen production at the HRTs of 4–6h (Lin et al., 2008a,b). In another study, Hamilton et al. (2010) obtained optimal overall hydrogen production rate of 33.2mL H2/Lh and a yield of 0.83mol H2/mol glucose in a semicontinuous reactor applying the previously optimized parameters for pH, nitrogen, and iron with a dilution rate of 0.012h−1 and degassing of biogas by N2 at a 28mL/min flow rate. Luo et al. (2010) optimized the influent alkalinity (6g NaHCO3/L) and HRT (24h) for thermophilic hydrogen production from cassava stillage. They reported maximum hydrogen yield of 76ml H2/gVS and hydrogen production rate of 3215ml H2/Ld. Maximum hydrogen production rate of 66mmol/(lh) was reported by using glucose as substrate at a dilution rate of 0.55h−1 in the immobilized whole cell bioreactor (Chittibabu et al., 2006). However, the production rate dropped with further increase in dilution rate. Consumption of substrate (glucose) was found to decrease with increase in dilution rate and the maximum utilization was about 70% at a dilution rate of 0.25h−1. Similar observations were reported by Hamilton et al. (2010), in their study of biological hydrogen production by Citrobacter freundii CWBI952 in batch, sequenced-batch and semi continuous operating mode. They reported maximum H2 yield of 0.95mol H2/mol glucose with a dilution rate of 0.009h−1 before growth restriction took place probably as a consequence of byproduct inhibition. The hydrogen yield then decreased to 0.74mol H2/mol glucose when the dilution rate was increased to 0.018h−1. Prasertsan et al. (2009) reported the optimum values of 2d HRT with an OLR of 60g COD/Ld which gave a maximum hydrogen yield of 0.27l H2 g/COD with a volumetric hydrogen production rate of 9.1L H2/Ld (16.9mmol/L/h) from palm oil mill effluent by thermophilic fermentative process. Effect of iron concentration (mostly Fe2+) is another important parameter, which has been reported in quite a good number of studies (Hamilton et al., 2010; Wang and Wan, 2008b;Wang et al., 2007; Nath et al., 2006). Nath et al. (2006) observed that with an iron concentration up to 20mg/L in the malt extract-yeast extract-glucose (MYG) media, the total volume of hydrogen production had increased marginally. However, higher concentrations of iron were found to have some inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. In another study it was observed that within a certain concentration range FeSO4 (0.045 and 0.03g/L, respectively tested in sequenced-batch and semicontinuous cultures) enhanced the HPR and hydrogen yield when growing the strain on (NH4)2SO4 (Hamilton et al., 2010). Besides, there are certain other less common parameters like concentration of Ni2+,Mg 2+, NO3− ions, which affects fermentative hydrogen production (Wang and Wan, 2008a; Kim et al., 2006a,b; Wang et al., 2007). 4.1.2 Response surface methodology Response surface methodology (RSM) is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques useful for developing, improving and optimizing processes. The field of response surface methodology consists of the experimental strategy for exploring the space of the process or independent variables, empirical statistical modeling to develop an appropriate approximating relationship between the yield and the process variables, and optimization methods for finding the values of the process variables that produce desirable values of the response. On the other hand, FD investigates how responses of multiple factors depend on each other and permits the identification of the most important parameters that control the process and the degree of interaction among them. FD approaches can be coupled to experimental systems by RSM, which uses a response function to fit the obtained experimental data to the theoretical design. Several studies report statistical experimental design methods that involve initially identifying the influencing parameters by screening method of Plackett–Burman, followed by the path of steepest ascent to approach the vicinity of optimal region of the parameters and finally central composite or Box–Behnken design for response surface methodology to further investigate the mutual interaction between the parameters and thereby identifying the optimal values that lead maximum hydrogen production rate or yield (Pan et al., 2008; Long et al., 2010). Table 4 summarizes some studies using factorial design to study the effects of various factors on fermentative hydrogen production processes. A large number of recent studies have examined parameter optimization using factorial design methods, and some relevant examples are given in Table 3 (others can be found elsewhere) (Wang and Wan, 2009a). Several statistical design methods to optimize H2 yields have been reviewed by Wang and Wan (2009a). Among the different methods, the fractional factorial design approach is commonly used by researchers. FFD is not always economically and practically feasible due to requirements for a large number of experiments in order to accurately predict the response. Response surface designs such as central composite design (CCD) and Box–Benkhen design (BBD) are commonly selected for performing optimization studies. A first-order polynomial model is usually used to describe the effects of various factors on it based on the experimental results from a Plackett–Burman design. (29) y = β 0 ∑ i = 1 k β i x i where y is the response, 0 is the constant and i is the linear coefficient, and xi is the coded factor levels. Based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the estimated model, the significant factors can be identified (Wang and Wan, 2009b). Pan et al. (2008) used Plackett–Burman design to study the effects of eight factors on fermentative hydrogen production and then screened three factors (glucose, phosphate buffer and vitamin solution) that had significant effects on the specific hydrogen production potential for further study based on analysis of the experimental results. Saraphirom and Reungsang (2010) reported the use of the Plackett–Burman design to screen and identify significant variables for hydrogen production from sweet sorghum syrup by mixed cultures. Culture parameters investigated were total sugar concentration, initial pH, nutrient addition, iron (II) sulfate (FeSO4), peptone and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) concentration. These variables were optimized by the Box–Benkhen design to maximize hydrogen production. In a recent study, a response surface model, based on the BBD technique was developed for computing the H2 yield for glucose degradation by a mixed batch anaerobic mesophilic culture under different experimental conditions (Ray et al., 2010). Approximately 85% of the theoretical H2 yield (4.0mol H2/mol glucose) was achieved in experiments conducted near the optimum factor setting identified by the d-optimality analysis. Often, the initial estimates of the optimal conditions for biohydrogen production process far from the actual optimum. Therefore, the second step for optimization is to locate the region of factor levels that give optimal conditions. In order to approach the area of the optimum, the next experiment is usually carried out along the path of steepest ascent. It is a simple and economically efficient procedure developed to move the experimental region of a response in the direction of the maximum change toward the optimum. However, if minimization of a response is desired, this method is referred to as the method of steepest descent. The factors screened by the Plackett–Burman design can be further investigated using this method. The path of steepest ascent starts from the design center of the factorial design building the first-order polynomial model and ends until no further improvement can be achieved in the response, which indicates that the region of optimal response is in the neighborhood of that condition (Wang and Wan, 2009b). 4.1.3 Artificial neural network-genetic algorithm In last two decades, artificial neural network (ANN) has been applied successfully in multivariate non-linear bioprocesses as a useful tool to construct models. It has been shown that a neural network is a superior and a more accurate modeling technique compared with the response surface methodology, as it represents the non-linearities in a much better way. The power of ANN is that it is generic in structure and possesses the ability to learn from historical data. The main advantage of ANN compared to RSM are: (i) ANN does not require a prior specification of suitable fitting function and (ii) ANN has universal approximation capability, i.e., it can approximate almost all kinds of non-linear functions including quadratic functions, whereas RSM is useful only for quadratic approximations (Desai et al., 2008). Genetic Algorithms (GAs), an artificial intelligence-based stochastic non-linear optimization formalism is used to optimize the input space of ANN model (Davis, 1991). This hybrid methodology is usually referred as ANN–GA modeling. The GA mimics the principles of biological evolution namely, “survival-of-the-fittest” and “random exchange of data during propagation” followed by biologically evolving species. ANNs were successfully used to model the results of hydrogen production and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal with an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) (Mu and Yu, 2007) and an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor (Guo et al., 2008). The on-line determination of hydrogen is essential to establish feedback or feed forward control algorithms. However, in practice there are few parameters for on-line monitoring in bioreactors. These generally include temperature, pH, oxidation–reduction potential, dissolved oxygen and dissolved CO2. The ANNs based mathematical models are based on the connectivity of biological neurons that have an incredible capability for emulation, analysis, prediction, association and adaptation (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Chen et al., 2004). Therefore, ANN based models can be applied successfully for the online determination and monitoring of various fermentation products. Rosales-Colunga et al. (2010) developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the hydrogen production in fermentative processes. A back propagation neural network (BPNN) of one hidden layer with 12 nodes was selected. The BPNN training was done using the conjugated gradient algorithm and on-line measurements of dissolved CO2, pH and oxidation–reduction potential during the fermentations of cheese whey by E. coli WDHL strain with or without pH control.The model was structured as: (30) H 2 = F ( pH, D CO 2 ,ORP, W ) where, W is the vector of adjustable parameters of the network or weight. The output layer had a node that predicted the value of hydrogen production whereas the input layer consisted on three nodes for pH, D CO 2 and ORP. All the neurons of hidden layer were non-linear with sigmoid activation function. Minimal squares methodology with respect to error function was used for BPNN training. (31) Error = ( 1 / ( 2 P ) ) ∑ i p ( ( H 2 ) exp i - ( H 2 i ) 2 ) Where (H2)exp i is the experimental value for the i-point, (H2) i is the value estimated by the network, p is the number of data. Wang and Wan (2009b) compared ANN and RSM methodologies for their predictive and generalization capabilities, sensitivity analysis and optimization efficiency in fermentative hydrogen production. ANN showed better accuracy and generalization capability than RSM even with limited number of experiments. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the standard error of prediction (SEP) for the RSM and NN models indicates that the RMSE (38.4%) and SEP (16.6%) for the RSM model were both much larger than those (17.8% and 7.7%, respectively) for the NN model, also indicating that the NN model had a much higher modeling ability than the RSM model (Wang and Wan, 2009a). The maximum hydrogen yield of 289.8mL/g glucose identified by response surface methodology was a little lower than that of 360.5mL/g glucose identified by the genetic algorithm based on a neural network model, indicating that the genetic algorithm based on a neural network model had a much higher optimizing ability than the response surface methodology. Mu and Yu (2007) reported the simulation of a granule-based H2-producing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor using neural network and genetic algorithm. A model was designed, trained and validated to predict the steady-state performance of the reactor. A total of 140 experimentally derived data sets were used in the study. Each data set consisted of three input variables, i.e., organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and influent bicarbonate alkalinity (BA), and 10 corresponding output variables, i.e., H2 concentration in the biogas, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and total organic carbon (TOC), acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caporate in the reactor effluent. Of these data sets, 100 data sets were used for training the GA–NN model, whereas 40 data sets were employed for model verification. A fractional factorial design was carried out by Wang and Wan (2009b) to investigate the effects of temperature, initial pH and glucose concentration on fermentative hydrogen production by mixed cultures in batch tests. The experimental data of substrate degradation efficiency, hydrogen yield and average hydrogen production rate were described by a neural network, based on which the simultaneous optimization of the three responses was performed by the method of desirability function. The method of desirability function based on a neural network was a useful tool to optimize several responses for fermentative hydrogen production processes simultaneously (Wang and Wan, 2009b). 4.1.4 Principal component analysis The physico-chemical operating conditions determining the biological pathways are followed inside the cell in order to have a good energetic balance (Aceves-Lara et al., 2008). Use of macroscopic approach like the pseudo-stoichiometric matrix provides an important method to study the biochemical pathways. The pseudo-stoichiometric matrix is the one that contains the minimal number of reactions capable of describing biochemical pathways (Bernard and Bastin, 2005). Aceves-Lara et al. (2008) estimated the pseudostoichiometric coefficients and reaction rates with an optimization algorithm coupled to a principal components analysis (PCA). The number of reactions was estimated by using the PCA followed by coefficient estimation with an optimization based on algorithms of Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). It was assumed that pseudostoichiometric coefficients are constants and that the kinetics rates are unknown. Finally, reactions rates were expressed as functions of operational conditions (hydraulic retention time, pH and stirring velocity) in order to compare their role in the hydrogen production. The mass balance model of the continuous stirred tank reactor fed with sucrose (the main component of molasses) and producing mainly acetate, propionate, butyrate, biomass, carbon inorganic (i.e., CO2, HCO3, etc.) and hydrogen was written according to Eq. (32): (32) d d t Suc Ace Pro Bu X C i H 2 = K . r - D Suc - Suc in Ace Pro Bu X C i H 2 - 0 0 0 0 0 q C i q H 2 where Suc, Ace, Pro, Bu, X, Ci and H2 represent, respectively, the concentrations in g/L of sucrose, acetate, propionate, butyrate, biomass, inorganic carbon and dissolved hydrogen in the liquid phase. K represents the matrix of pseudo stoichiometric coefficients (without units and dimension equal to m × n), r the vector of the kinetics (dimension n ×1 in g/Ld), D the dilution rate (d−1) and qCi and qH2 the gas flow rates of inorganic carbon and hydrogen expressed in g/Ld. Under steady state condition the left hand side term of Eq. (32) is cancelled and Eq. (33) is obtained defining the vector u (dim =m ×1): (33) K × r = u Where (34) U = D . Suc - Suc in Ace Pro Bu X C i H 2 + 0 0 0 0 0 q C i q H 2 Aceves-Lara et al. (2008) carried out the experiments at 37°C using a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with molasses. Principal component analysis method was used to determine the main reactions implied in the degradation of sucrose into acetate, propionate, butyrate, hydrogen, inorganic carbon and biomass. Two reactions explained 89% of the experimental variance. The estimation of the pseudo-stoichiometric coefficients, using SQP optimization, showed that the first reaction mainly produced butyrate, hydrogen and biomass whereas the second reaction mainly produced acetate and biomass. HRT ranged from 6 to 14h, pH from 5.5 to 6 and the stirring velocity from 150 to 300rpm. The maximum hydrogen production of 5.4L/dL was obtained for a pH of 5.5, a HRT of 6h and a stirring velocity of 300rpm, at a loading rate of 37.12g COD/dL, which corresponds to 2.5mol H2/mol sucrose. Only linear effects of pH, HRT and stirring velocity were significant and not their interactions or quadratic effects. Aceves-Lara et al., 2010 presented an approach of dynamic optimization of hydrogen production from an agricultural effluent by combining an optimal closed-loop control together with state and input variable estimations by an asymptotic observer. A general mass balance model of a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with carbohydrates was used in their study. The glucose metabolism performed by a single microorganism producing acetate, propionate, butyrate, biomass, carbon inorganic (i.e., CO2, HCO 3 - etc.) and hydrogen was written according to the Eq. (35) (35) d d t Glu Ace Pro Bu X CO 2 H 2 = Y . r - D Glu Ace Pro Bu X CO 2 H 2 + D Glu in 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 0 0 q CO 2 q H 2 where the state variables Glu, Ace, Pro, Bu, X, CO2 and H2 represent, respectively, the concentrations in gL−1of glucose, acetate, propionate, butyrate, biomass, carbon dioxide (in molL−1) and dissolved hydrogen in the liquid phase. The vector r = [r 1 × r 2] t describes the kinetics of the involved biological reactions (in gL−1 h−1), D is the dilution rate (h−1) and q CO 2 and q H 2 the gas flow rates of carbon dioxide and hydrogen expressed in gL−1 h−1. Y represents the matrix of pseudo-stoichiometric coefficients. The process was described by a dynamic nonlinear model. The influent concentration of molasses together with the effluent substrate and product concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and biomass were estimated by an asymptotic online observer from measurements of gas composition in H2 and CO2 and gas flow rate. The observer was tested experimentally before applying model predictive control strategy (Aceves-Lara et al., 2010). Cuetos et al. (2007) employed a desirability function in order to optimize the fermentative biohydrogen from municipal solid wastes and blood from a poultry slaughterhouse when a second, methanogenic, phase is coupled with it. In this last case, the optimum conditions lead to a reduction in the production of hydrogen when the optimization process involves the maximization of intermediary products. The application of a desirability function combines all the responses into one measurement and gives the possibility of predicting the optimum levels for the independent variable. The combination of the responses into one desirability function requires the calculation of each individual desirability function. Responses were maximized and minimized according to the Eqs. (36) and (37), respectively. (36) d i = Y i - Y min Y max - Y min (37) d i = Y max - Y i Y max - Y min The overall desirability values were calculated from the individual values by using the following equation for n responses: (38) D = ( d 1 × d 2 . . . . . d n ) 1 / n A 32 central composite design was used to determine the effect of the solid concentration of the substrate, the proportion of waste in the feed and the hydraulic retention over the responses selected (Cuetos et al., 2007). Optimization of the process using a desirability function for dark fermentation phase coupled with a second methanogenic phase resulted in a reduction in the production of hydrogen when the generation of intermediary products was maximized. Hydrogen production fell from 0.97L/Ld when the optimum point was based on hydrogen maximization, to 0.25L/Ld when maximization of soluble products was also considered. Ding et al. (2010) reported three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of gas–liquid flow in a laboratory scale continuous stirred tank reactor for biohydrogen production. Here, the CFD modeling predicted the hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions by solving a set of mathematical equations, describing these processes as mass, momentum, energy and species balances. The CFD simulation was used to portray hydrodynamics behavior in the reactor, including the velocity field, biogas volume fraction, turbulence kinetic energy and shear strain rate. The turbulence equations were solved in conjunction with the continuity equation, the Navier–Stokes equation and the energy equation (Ding et al., 2010). The inhomogeneous particle model used in the simulation assumed that the mixture was continuous phase whereas biogas was dispersed phase. The study revealed that impeller type and speed significantly affected flow patters in CSTR, thereby offering different optimal efficiencies for biohydrogen production."
8,Conclusion,"This review highlights the recent studies on modeling of microbial growth, substrate utilization and product formation along with various optimization strategies. It is worthwhile to note that any biohydrogen process depends largely on optimization of several controlling factors. This is only possible through modeling of the factors that determine process rate. Notwithstanding the fact that all mesophilic fermentations require similar conditions, there are sufficient differences in some of the parameters. This substantiates the need for optimization of a particular system. In addition, these methods could prove helpful in establishing process parameters for novel consortia or complex substrates like effluent streams."
