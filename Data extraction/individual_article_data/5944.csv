0,Introduction,"The methane or natural gas steam reforming represents since decades the most efficient way for the large-scale production of hydrogen [1], like in the cases of ammonia and methanol synthesis processes [2], steel and iron recovering processes [3] and hydrogenation of organics, e.g., for the production of amines [4] and also to supply additional hydrogen to refineries for hydrotreatings [5]. The typical catalyst is based on Ni–Al2O3 [6] and may be prepared either by impregnation or by co-precipitation [7]. Noble metal catalysts may display even higher activity than Ni-based ones, but are usually not applied for economic reasons. Alternative hydrogen production can be carried out by steam reforming and/or partial oxidation of higher hydrocarbons like, e.g., heavy naphta [8]. The successful development of hydrogen fuel cells and their forthcoming wide application make necessary the development of small-scale hydrogen production systems. On the other hand, direct fuel cell [9,10] are also under development where the fuel is different from hydrogen and is directly fed to the anode that also catalyzes the hydrogen forming reaction. For these small-scale applications, the use of noble metals as anode-catalysts materials can be more convenient. For on-board fuel cell applications (ships, cars, trucks), gaseous fuels (like hydrogen, methane, natural gas) may be conveniently substituted by liquid fuels (like gasoline or alcohols) or by easily condensable fuels like propane. On the other hand, the presence of propane in natural gas is relevant because it favors coking of the catalysts: to limit it propane pre-reforming may be an option [10]. Noble-metal-based catalysts including Pd-based systems seem to offer good performances for hydrogen production from propane [11–13]. However, propene has been found among the products in this case. On the other hand, no data are available in the literature on propene reforming. Pd–Cu alloys show good hydrogen permeance [14], while supported Pd–Cu catalysts are also active in steam reforming reactions [15]. In the present investigation, we focused on the steam reforming of propane and propene over two catalysts which may also be used as anodes for directly fuelled FCs, i.e., a Pd–Cu-alumina and a Ni-alumina catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst Pd–Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. has been prepared by co-precipitation of the two metal hydroxides over γ-Al2O3 and subsequently dried at 80°C for 48h. The catalyst composition Pd–Cu (1:5 atomic ratio, 30% metal w/w) supported on γ-Al2O3 has been confirmed by microanalysis (EPMA). XRD of the fresh catalyst shows the typical broad pattern of γ-Al2O3 together with very weak peaks of Pd and Cu oxides while reduction in mild conditions gives rise to metal particles. The Ni/NiAl2O4 catalyst has been prepared by co-precipitation via an hydrotalcite-like precursor as reported previously [16], similar to those reported in the literature [6,7]. Its composition is Ni0.5Al2O3.5. The catalyst has been reduced in hydrogen flow for 1h at 723K before catalytic experiments."
3,Catalytic tests,2.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed tubular quartz reactor containing 150mg of catalyst mixed with 350mg of quartz particles. Product analysis was performed with an on-line gas-chromatographs (GC) in order to detect both carbon species and H2. A Agilent 4890 GC equipped with a Varian capillary column “Select Permanent Gases Molsieve 5A/Porabond Q Tandem” and TCD and FID detectors in series. Between them a Nickel Catalyst Tube has been employed to reduce CO to CH4. A six-port valve with a 0.5cm3 loop was used for the gas sampling of the outlet gases. The catalytic tests were performed by feeding stoichiometric water-to-organic ratios sufficient to obtain the “complete” steam reforming and WGS reactions this means a ratio H2O/organic=6/1. Results are reported based on reactant conversion and product selectivities. Selectivity to H2 has been defined as the fraction of hydrogen produced with respect to the theoretical full conversion of the organic reactant to hydrogen obtainable from its complete reforming. Selectivity to carbon compounds has been defined as: moles of C-compound produced/moles of C-reactant reacted/stoichiometric coefficient.
4,Results,"Fig. 1 shows the activity of the catalyst in the propane steam reforming reaction over the Pd–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. Propane conversion starts above 800K. Propylene (70% selectivity) and CO2 (30%) are the only products detectable at low temperature and very low conversion, whose selectivity decreases by increasing temperature, in favor of CO selectivity which grows first and keeps a constant selectivity of 22% in the range 900–1100K. In the same range of temperature, CH4 and C2H4 are also observed, their selectivity rising as well. Hydrogen selectivity shows a maximum of 45% at low propane conversion (around 5%) and decreases by increasing temperature down to a minimum of 22% at 1100K. At the same time, H2O conversion slightly increases to 12% at 1100K. These data indicate that under SR conditions, propane dehydrogenation actually occurs already near 800K, C 3 H 8 = C 3 H 6 + H 2 The outlet amounts of CO2, CO and hydrogen indicate, according to our thermodynamic calculations, that steam reforming of propane, C 3 H 8 + 3 H 2 O = 3 CO + 7 H 2 is likely followed by water gas shift reaction CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 whose equilibrium is actually not reached even at 1100K, although the equilibrium tends to shift towards CO and water by increasing temperature. The conversion of propane is strongly enhanced at higher temperatures, when methane and ethylene are observed. The far higher selectivity to ethylene with respect to methane suggests that, besides the likely occurrence of the cracking reaction C 3 H 8 = C 2 H 4 + CH 4 also another reaction producing ethylene occurs, possibly the following one: C 3 H 8 + H 2 O = C 2 H 4 + CO + 3 H 2 According to this picture, the conversion of water is much lower than the conversion of propane, which are fed with the correct stoichiometry for the SR reaction. In spite of the hydrogen selectivity decrease, the hydrogen yield actually increases by increasing temperature and reaches 16% at 1100K. This shows that Pd–Cu/Al2O3 is not a selective catalyst for propane steam reforming under these conditions, with quite large productions of propene, ethylene and methane. Actually, at the highest temperature ethylene is the main byproduct. The curves relative to steam reforming of propene performed in the same conditions over Pd–Cu/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2 . Conversion of both propene and water grows steadily above 550K giving rise to CO and CO2 and hydrogen as the largely predominant products. Only above 850K, methane is also formed in small amounts. Hydrogen selectivity is always very high approaching 100%, but decreases at the highest temperature in concomitance with the production of methane. According with these data in the range 550–700K, the propene steam reforming can be considered the main reaction. Propene and water conversions in fact have the same trend and the selectivity to H2 reaches 100% meaning that SR is the largely predominant reaction. These data show that Pd–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is an excellent catalyst for propene steam reforming, although CO/CO2 ratio is quite high showing that at low temperature the water gas shift reaction occurs to a limited extent. Propene SR is over this catalyst faster and much more selective to CO x and hydrogen than propane SR. The catalytic activity of Ni/NiAl2O4 catalyst in C3H8 steam reforming is shown in Fig. 3 . Conversion of propane and H2O start to be detectable above 650K. At conversion values around 35% for both propane and H2O, the main products detected are CO2 and H2. Propane conversion increases by increasing temperature, whereas at the same time H2 selectivity decreases from 90% at 750–75% at 1000K. Selectivity to CO2 dramatically drops to zero giving place to CO which rises reaching its maximum of 90% at 1000K. Water conversion does not exceed 50% at 1000K. A small amount of methane has been detected in the range 800–1000K, but with a selectivity not higher than 5%. Our data suggest that the steam reforming of propane coupled with WGS are the main reactions occurring in the range 650–800K. This finds a confirmation in the decrease of CO2 selectivity by increasing temperature, in agreement with the WGS equilibrium. The low amount of CH4 detected at 800–1000K can be ascribed to the hydrogenation of CO2 by H2, according with the behavior of the Ni-based materials as a methanation catalysts, and this causes the decrease of hydrogen selectivity. CO 2 + 4 H 2 = CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Conversion/selectivities vs. temperature of the catalytic test of Ni-based catalyst in the propene steam reforming are shown in Fig. 4 . A detectable conversion of the reactants starts above 700K and in the case of propylene reaches 95% at 1000K whereas for H2O is 50% at the same temperature. At low temperature (750K), the main products are CO2 (60% of selectivity) and H2 more than 95% of selectivity. Taking into consideration the all range of temperature H2 selectivity varies from 95% to 75% at 950K. CO2 decreases from 60% at 750K to 7% at 950K. In the same range of temperature, CO rises reaching 95% of selectivity at 1000K. The small production of CH4, which selectivity does not exceed 5%, can be related to methanation of CO2 in the range 750–1000K. Even in this case, like for propane over Ni-based catalyst, the reaction occurring at low temperature is the steam reforming of the olefin followed by the WGS, whereas by increasing temperature since WGS is less favored, the main reaction is steam reforming. A part of the hydrogen produced in the range 850–1000K participates in methanation of CO2 as suggested by the small amount of CH4 detected. CO 2 + 4 H 2 = CH 4 + 2 H 2 O"
5,Discussion,"The data reported here allow to compare the steam reforming reactions of propane and propene over a Pd-based and a Ni-based catalyst. The behavior of our Ni–NiAl2O4 catalyst is quite comparable with that reported in the literature for similar materials [11]. Over this catalyst, the conversion of propane and propene and the selectivities to the products H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 are strictly similar, in similar conditions. The activation energy for propane steam reforming found in this study (see Table 1 ), as calculated taking low conversion experiments in the approximation of a differential reactor, is a little higher than that reported in the literature for similar systems [17,18]. A definitely higher activation energy is found here for propene conversion over the same catalyst. The product distribution is such that the water gas shift reaction approaches equilibrium here. The propane steam reforming over the Pd catalyst is definitely worst than over the Ni catalyst. Propene formation, likely produced by propane dehydrogenation, limits steam reforming at low temperature, while the formation of ethylene and methane limit it at high temperature. Also, the CO2/CO ratio is far from equilibrium, with an excess of CO2 formation. Well in contrast with this, propene steam reforming is definitely faster and more selective than propane steam reforming over our Pd-based catalyst. This behavior, according to the fast conversion of propene but also with its production from propane in the parallel conditions, provides evidence of some kind of Pd-based catalyst poisoning by propane, unlike propene. Coking of Pd by propane is a well-known phenomenon and may not involve propene as an intermediate [19]. Propene steam reforming occurs over our Pd–Cu catalyst about 100K below propene steam reforming on Nichel, although over Ni, likely due to the faster water gas shift, hydrogen yield is better at the same propene conversion level. The higher activity of Pd–Cu catalyst may be related to the well-known ability of Pd metal to adsorb olefins forming di-σ-bonded species [20] and to act as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst. Also the ability of Cu+ centers to adsorb olefins through a π-bonding [21] may be relevant here. These interactions may activate propene towards steam reforming."
