0,Introduction,"The production of biofuels as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels has been one of the key research areas for the last two decades (Pirzadahet al., 2014). Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has been widely acknowledged as a sustainable feedstock to produce biofuels for replacing or blending in petroleum products. It is a complex natural biocomposite consisting of three polymers viz. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin wrapped amongst each other to impart robust structural and chemical stability to the plant species (Ruiz-Dueñas and Martínez, 2009). LCB in the form of straw, cobs, fibres, woodchips and other agro-residues is a potential raw material for a bio-refinery to produce biofuels and various biochemicals (Ragauskas et al., 2006). Cellulose and hemicellulose in LCB are highly tough to depolymerize into monomeric or low molecular weight chemicals directly in a selective manner. Due to recalcitrant nature of lignocellulose to both enzymes and chemicals, pretreatment step becomes mandatory prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and thus subsequent fermentation for bioethanol production (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Developing economical and greener prospective to break open the complex lignocellulose has been a continuous challenge for researchers at the commercial scale (Lynd, 2017). Yet, the compositional variations of major components in different biomass varieties poses an additional challenge in the development of an ideal pretreatment process. Several pretreatment techniques for softening of biomass have been reported so far (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Current industrial methods mainly use harsh acid, alkali and steam explosion for pretreatment processes (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). However, all these severe thermo-chemical processes suffer from the formation of inhibitors that severely affect fermentation and saccharification (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). In addition, the neutralization of pretreated hydrolysates may add up to the overall costs and also have a significant environmental impact. Apart from conventionally used acid and alkali based pretreatment methods, other techniques for pretreating biomass include the use of mechanical processes, biological treatments, ionic liquids etc., (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Biomass pretreatment may also be multi-staged using a combination of steam-acid, steam-alkali, acid/alkali-mechanical, hydrothermal-alkali etc., (Kumar and Sharma, 2017). Recently the focus has shifted to solvent systems called the deep eutectic solvents (DES), which are considered as greener and cost effective alternatives to ionic liquids (Smith et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2017). The deep eutectic solvent system is a blend of atleast two chemicals [H-bonding donor (HBD) and H-bonding acceptor (HBA)] in a specific molar ratio possessing much lower melting point than that of the individual components (Abbott et al., 2004). They share a few similar properties with ionic liquids and are of interest to researchers due to their lower cost and minimal environmental impact (Gorkeet al., 2008). Biomass pre-treatment with DES systems have gained recent attention (Kumar et al., 2016) and one of the earlier reports was concerned with the use of choline chloride and oxalic acid based DES for the fractionation of wheat and rice straw (Jablonskýet al., 2015, Kumar et al., 2016). In this work, an effective delignification process for different varities of biomass (rice husk, rice straw and wheat straw) was demonstrated using a combination of DES and alcohol (DES-OL)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Three biomass; varieties rice straw (RS), rice husk (RH) and wheat straw (WS) were obtained from local fields in the outskirts sources around Bangalore. The biomass samples were grinded and sieved to the size of 0.5–1 cm. Samples were oven dried at 105 °C till the constant weight was attained and used for pretreatment straight away. Oxalic acid (OA) and choline chloride (ChCl) were purchased from Avra Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, India. They were vacuum dried at 60 °C for 4 h prior to use. Phloroglucinol, HCl, n-Butanol, n-propanol and ethyl acetate all of AR grade were purchased from Merck, India."
3,Biomass composition analysis,"2.2 Biomass composition analysis The major chemical constituents of selected biomass materials, such as cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin were determined according to NREL-LAP procedures (Sluiter et al., 2011)."
4,Preparation of deep eutectic solvent,2.3 Preparation of deep eutectic solvent Choline chloride (50 g) was weighed in 250 mL round bottom flask and equimolar amount of oxalic acid was added to it. Stirring was started at 80 °C. The mixture turned into colorless viscous solution in 2 h and stirring was continued for more 2 h. DES was ready to use after it was cooled in a desiccator filled with fused CaCl2.
5,Preparation of ‘DES-OL’,"2.4 Preparation of ‘DES-OL’ Various ratios of DES-to-alcohol (2:1. 1:1, 1:2) were prepared freshly every time before use. For a 15 mL DES-OL of 2:1 ratio initially 10 mL of DES was taken in a centrifuge tube. n-Butanol (1 mL) was added followed by vortexing mixing of one minute to achieve homogeneity. Similar 1 mL additions were repeated for additional 4 mL to obtain 2:1 DES-OL. Similar was the case with n-propanol and ethyl acetate. Turbidity in the ternary mixtures sometimes did not effect in the overall outcome of the reaction."
6,DES-OL pretreatment of biomass,"2.5 DES-OL pretreatment of biomass In a typical reaction, dry feed of 2.25 g was taken in a pressure tube (100 mL) with a Teflon screw cap. DES-OL/DES/Organic solvent of 15 mL was added to the tube. Tube was immersed in an oil bath with temperature set to 120 ± 0.5 °C for one hour. Stirring rate of 800 rpm was maintained during the reaction. Post reaction the pulp was collected and squeezed to obtain dark liquid. Then the pulp was washed to be remove of DES and alcohol with 50 mL x 4 of distilled water. The pulp was dried at 105 °C and analyzed for lignin content."
7,Lignin recovery procedure,"2.6 Lignin recovery procedure Separated dark liquid from the reaction was washed with 5 × 10 mL of distilled water to extract dissolved DES components in the organic layer, Post washing the dark liquid was subjected for rotary evaporation to obtain dark solid. Obtained dark solid was further oven dried at 120 °C (4 h) to obtain dark brown dry flakes. CPMAS/NMR spectrum of the dark solid flakes confirm the material is lignin."
8,Phloroglucinol-HCl staining of lignin in biomass,"2.7 Phloroglucinol-HCl staining of lignin in biomass Saturated solution of phloroglucinol was prepared in distilled water and HCl mixture as reported earlier (Jensen, 1962). The excess material was removed by centrifuging the solution and decanting the light orange transparent solution. Aluminium foil was used to cover the solution due to the photosensitivity of the compound. A drop of the solution was casted on raw biomass (rice husk) that was placed on a glass slide. A cover slip was placed on soaked biomass and images of stained biomass were acquired with an optical microscope. In a similar manner images were captured for DES-OL treated biomass as well."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Preliminary compositional analysis and DES-OL pretreatment of biomass,"3.1 Preliminary compositional analysis and DES-OL pretreatment of biomass Preliminary chemical compositional analysis of the three biomass varieties was determined by NREL-LAP procedures (Sluiteret al., 2011) (Table 1 ). The purpose of choosing these three different biomass materials was mainly because of their abundance in India (Kaushik and Singh, 2016). Prior to the pretreatment process, preparation of deep eutectic solvent system of choline chloride and oxalic acid was carried out by the reported method (Abbott et al., 2004). DES and DES-OL preparations are given in experimental section. Post-reaction, the pulp was squeezed to obtain lignin rich butanol layer. Lignin is highly soluble in non-polar solvents such as butanol and therefore this property was leveraged for its extraction. The pulp was washed with distilled water to make it free from DES and residual butanol. The washed pulp was then oven-dried at 105 °C for 4 h and was allowed to cool in a desiccator. Similar process was repeated for other two biomass materials. The obtained dry solids were analyzed for their compositions to estimate lignin content. Lignin removal was observed to be in the range of 23–31% for all the tested biomass samples with DES which in contrast with DES-OL where ∼50% delignification was observed for all the tested biomass samples. This is the highest extent of delignification at high solid loadings of 15% (w/v) reported so far. The data of DES is comparable to literature data with 5% (w/v) loading (Pan et al., 2017; Hiltunenet al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018) and by almost two fold higher than the earlier studies reported for corn stover (Xu et al., 2016), palm residue (Fang et al., 2017) and it reveals the importance of synergy among DES-OL components for the solubilisation of lignin. Delignification using DES-OL system was atleast 50% higher than that of pure DES treatment. Treating rice husk with only butanol at 120 °C for 1 h yielded no visible delignification. On the other hand, the butanol layer (∼5 mL) separated from DES-OL treatment was washed with 5 × 10 mL of distilled water for removing any DES from the organic layer. The alcohol along with residual water was removed in rotary evaporator and recycled. The obtained lignin was dried in the oven at 120 °C for 4 h. CPMAS/NMR confirms the purity of lignin. In order to understand the effect of reaction conditions on the degree of biomass delignification, the optimum temperature and DES-to-alcohol ratio was determined."
11,Effect of temperature on DES-OL pretreatment,"3.2 Effect of temperature on DES-OL pretreatment Pretreatment using DES-OL system was carried out at different temperatures of 50, 80 and 120 °C for all three materials. Delignification results at different temperatures are represented in Table 2 . Overall, there are four major types of bonds identified in the (hemi)-cellulose-lignin complex and these include ester bonds, ether bonds, carbon-to-carbon bonds and hydrogen bonds. Amongst these, the hydrogen bonds mainly impart recalcitrance to lignocellulosic biomass. It is known that reaction temperatures usually intensify the reaction kinetics. Therefore, the breaking of hydrogen bonds can be increased by applying higher temperatures to reaction mixtures which can be further enhanced by substitution with a suitable solvent that forms hydrogen bonds with the components of biomass (Faulonet al., 1994). In the present study, increase in temperature reduces the viscosity of DES-OL solvent system by breaking inter H-bonding among the solvent components and aids in effective interaction of the biomass with solvent system and thereby increasing the lignin dislocation. Therefore, the extent of delignification increased markedly (∼2.3 folds) on raising the temperature from 80 °C to 120 °C."
12,Optimization of co-solvent system,"3.3 Optimization of co-solvent system The process of extracting various organic components present in the aqueous phase by using ethyl acetate is well established due to its polarity and much less toxicity than that of chlorinated solvents (Siek, 1978). In many of these pretreatment processes, alcohols were further used for recovering the organic components (such as lignin) from the extracted solvent phase (Siek, 1978). In the present study, a higher alcohol (n-butanol), a lower alcohol (n-propanol) and an ester (ethyl acetate) were used as co-solvents for developing DES-OL systems. Their choice was also based on (a) miscibility in DES (CHCl/OA) (b) lignin solubility at relatively lower temperatures. The results indicated that the use of DES and butanol combination gave the best results among the tested organic solvent mixtures. The combination of DES and propanol gave 41% delignification post pretreatment whereas only 15% (w/w) lignin removal was observed when DES/Ethyl acetate was used (Fig. 1 )."
13,Effect of DES to n-butanol ratio,"3.4 Effect of DES to n-butanol ratio Following the optimization of temperature and co-solvent studies ideal ratio of DES to n-butanol was vital. All three biomasses were pretreated with varying DES to n-butanol ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 by keeping other parameters viz. temperature, S/L loading constant for a fixed duration. The highest delignification (∼49%) was observed with DES to butanol ratio of 2:1 whereas ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 showed percentage delignification of only 21.5 and 18.2, respectively (Table 3 ). It was noteworthy that the ratio of DES-OL components is critical for effective biomass delignification. The maximum effectivity of DES-OL system was obtained during the present study on use of butanol as the co-solvent. The reasons for the effectivity of butanol in DES-OL can be attributed to higher fractionation of lignin and its minimal miscibility in water. Moreover, butanol can be easily recovered during the isolation of lignin fraction."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, a new ternary solvent system using a combination of DES (choline chloride: oxalic acid) and n-butanol was employed for the delignification of lignocellulosic biomass. Parametric optimization w.r.t co-solvent selection, suitable reaction temperature, the ratio of DES-to-co-solvent was performed. At every step, the material was analyzed by microscopy and CPMAS/NMR. The delignification efficiency of DES-OL system was successfully evaluated for rice husk, rice straw and wheat straw. The synergy of DES-OL resulted in higher delignification (∼50%) of lignocellulosic biomass. Efforts to scale-up the process and recover the DES-OL components are being carried out in the author’s laboratory."
