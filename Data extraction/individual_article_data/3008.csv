0,Introduction,"Luliconazole is a novel imidazole derivative, which exerts inhibitory effects on dermatophytes and Candida in vitro [1,2]. The antifungal mechanism of luliconazole is based on inhibition of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51), which involves in the biosynthesis of ergosterol [3]. Optically pure (S)-2-chloro-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl) ethanol ((S)-CPEO) is the key chiral intermediate for luliconazole synthesis [4,5]. Currently, (S)-CPEO can be prepared using chemical or biological methods [4–6]. For the chemical methods, chiral oxazaborolidine and metal catalysts (ruthenium, iridium or rhodium) are often used for the hydrogenation of ketones [7–9]. For example, S-(-)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine was used for producing (S)-CPEO with an ee values more than 99% [6]. However, most chemical methods require strictly defined conditions and are not environmentally friendly, which limits their industrial application. Recently, biological methods have attracted increasing attention for the production of (S)-CPEO [4,5]. Lipases are suitable for the synthesis of (S)-CPEO, and immobilization on immobead-150 (TLL) from Thermomyces lanuginosus and CAL-B (Novozym 435) yielded the highest conversion (52% for TLL and 50% for Novozym 435, respectively) and ee values (99% for TLL and 97% for Novozym 435, respectively) in the kinetic resolution of rac-2-chloro-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl) ethyl acetate [4]. Although (S)-CPEO can be prepared with high ee values using lipases, this method is limited by a theoretical yield of only 50%. To date, reductases have been exploited for producing chiral alcohols, such as (S)-N-boc-3-hydroxypiperidine [10,11], (S)-2-chloro-1-(3, 4-difluorophenyl) ethanol [12], and 3-chloro-1-phenylpropanol [13,14]. Recently, two (R)-selectivity alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), LB-ADH from Lactobacillus brevis and PR2-ADH of unknown origin, were used to produce (S)-CPEO [5]. However, these two enzymes suffer from the disadvantages of low substrate concentration (<5.0 g/L) and unsatisfactory ee values (<90%) [5]. Recombinant Dh-ADH derived from Debaryomyces hansenii has also been exploited for the asymmetric reduction of 2-chloro-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl) ethanone (CPE, 44.4 g/L), producing (S)-CPEO with a yield of 89% and an ee value exceeding 99% [15]. However, low concentrations of substrate are insufficient to meet the requirements for (S)-CPEO production on an industrial scale. Thus, a more efficient and stereospecific biocatalyst that can overcome these drawbacks is needed for the industrialized production of (S)-CPEO. In the previous studies, ADH from Lactobacillus kefir has been evolved to be active against many ketone substrates, for the asymmetric reduction of 1-(2, 6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl) ethanone (ADH-LKM, F147L/Y190P/V196L/A202W) [16], tert-butyl 6-chloro-3, 5-dioxohexanoate (LK-TADH, A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) [17], and methyl-2-benzamidomethyl-3-oxobutyrate (LK-TADH, A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) [18], etc. We supposed that the LK-TADH may have activity toward CPE, so in the present study, the LK-TADH (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) from L. kefir was expressed and coupled with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Bacillus subtilis to produce (S)-CPEO (Fig. 1 ). In addition, molecular docking simulation was applied to illustrate the mechanism responsible the increased catalytic ability and ee values. Furthermore, (S)-CPEO was prepared by asymmetric reduction of CPE (60 g/L) using the recombinant LK-TADH coupled with GDH in a 6-h reaction. Our study demonstrated that this enzyme has the potential for (S)-CPEO production on a scale that is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strains, plasmids and reagents","2.1 Strains, plasmids and reagents Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were the host strains for expression. The pET26b plasmid was applied for the construction of expression vectors. E. coli GDH (NCBI reference sequence: WP_119899028.1) was constructed and stored in our laboratory [19]. CPE was obtained from Zhejiang Changxing pharmaceutical CO., LTD (Huzhou, China). (S)-CPEO was obtained from J&K Chemicals Ltd. (Shanghai, China). NADP+, isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and kanamycin sulfate (Kana) were obtained from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). 30% Acr-Bis (29:1) was obtained from Boster Biological Technology Co. Ltd. (Wuhan, China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade."
3,Construction of expression plasmids,"2.2 Construction of expression plasmids The nucleotide sequences of LK-ADH (NCBI Reference Sequence: WP_054768785.1) and LK-TADH (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) [17] of L. kefir were synthesized and subcloned into pET26b by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The resulting plasmids were designated pET26b-LK-ADH and pET26b-LK-TADH, respectively. The pET26b-LK-ADH and pET26b-LK-TADH plasmids were transformed into the competent cells (E. coli BL21 (DE3)), and the resulting cell lines were designated E. coli LK-ADH and E. coli LK-TADH, respectively."
4,Expression and purification of LK-ADH and LK-TADH in recombinant E. coli,"2.3 Expression and purification of LK-ADH and LK-TADH in recombinant E. coli E. coli LK-ADH and E. coli LK-TADH were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing Kana (50 μg/mL) and cultivated at 37 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8–1.0, 0.1 mM IPTG was added into the LB broth and the cells were induced at 25 °C overnight for protein expression. The recombinant cells were collected, disrupted and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography according Tang et al. [19]. The crude and purified enzymes were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Kinetic parameters of each recombinant enzyme was determined in a mixture (total volume 2.5 mL) containing 0.1 mM NADPH, 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) and 1.0–3.5 mM CPE at 35 °C. The Michaelis constant (Km ) and the maximum velocity (V max) were determined according to nonlinear regression fitting of the Michaelis-Menten equation. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 1 μmoL of NADPH in 1 min at 35 °C."
5,Using LK-ADH or LK-TADH to produce (S)-CPEO,"2.4 Using LK-ADH or LK-TADH to produce (S)-CPEO CPE (25 g/L) was added into a reaction mixture (50 mL) containing 50 g/L wet-cells lysate of recombinant LK-ADH or LK-TADH, GDH (5 kU), 0.05 g/L NADP+, glucose-to-substrate ratio (1.2 mol/mol) and 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction mixture was stirred at 35 °C, and the pH value was kept between 7.0 and 7.5 by titrating with 1 M Na2CO3. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to monitor the process of reaction. The conversion rate and the ee value of the final product were analyzed by HPLC or chiral HPLC. The conversion rate (C%) and ee value of product was acquired according to the following equations: (1) C% = (C0 − C1)/C0 × 100%. C0: the initial concentration of CPE (g/L), C1: the final concentration of CPE (g/L). (2) ee value (%) = (CS − CR)/(CS + CR) × 100% CS: the final concentration of (S)-CPEO, CR: the final concentration of (R)-CPEO."
6,Molecular homology modeling and docking simulation,2.5 Molecular homology modeling and docking simulation Three-dimensional (3D) homology models of LK-ADH and its mutant were established according to the crystal structure of LK-ADH from L. kefir (PDB ID: 4RF5) bound to NADPH [20]. The structure of the mutant protein was obtained using the PyMOL program under the amino acid mutation module and optimized by molecular mechanics [17]. The optimized protein model was then evaluated with the PROCHECK and ERRAT programs. Flexible docking of CPE and NADPH into LK-ADH and its mutant were simulated using the AutoDock 4.2.6 program.
7,Effect of CPE concentration on the synthesis of (S)-CPEO,"2.6 Effect of CPE concentration on the synthesis of (S)-CPEO Recombinant LK-TADH wet-cells were used to determine the effect of CPE concentration on the biotransformation. The biotransformation (100 mL) mixture contained 50 g/L recombinant LK-TADH wet-cells lysate, GDH (15 kU), 0.05 g/L NADP+, glucose-to-CPE ratio (1.2 mol/mol), 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction was stirred at 35 °C, and the pH was maintained between 7.0 and 7.5 by titrating with 1 M Na2CO3. TLC was used to monitor the process of reaction (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate = 5:1). When the pH value of reaction system was not decreased, each mixture was collected and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ratio of substrate and product in the collected organic phase was analyzed by HPLC to determine the conversion rate."
8,Gram-scale preparation of (S)-CPEO,"2.7 Gram-scale preparation of (S)-CPEO CPE (60 g/L) was added into a reaction mixture (500 mL) containing 50 g/L LK-TADH wet-cells, GDH (15 kU), 0.05 g/L NADP+, glucose-to-substrate ratio (1.2 mol/mol) and 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 7.0). The mixture was stirred at 35 °C, and the pH value was kept between 7.0 and 7.5 by titrating with 1 M Na2CO3. After substrate conversion rate reached approximately 100%, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate for three times. Finally, the (S)-CPEO was obtained by drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporating the combined organic phase. The final product was analyzed by Chiral HPLC and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)."
9,Product analysis,"2.8 Product analysis The concentration of CPE and (S)-CPEO was determined using HPLC (Agilent 1200) with a Zorbax-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at 25 °C. CPE and (S)-CPEO were eluted with a mobile phase (acetonitrile: 0.02 M monopotassium phosphate solution 50:50) at 1.0 mL/min and detected at UV 210 nm. The 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) of (S)-CPEO were measured according to Zong et al [16], and the ee value of (S)-CPEO was determined using a Superchiral S-AD column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) at UV 220 nm [16]. All tests were performed in triplicate in the present study. Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (Ehningen, Germany)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Expression and purification of LK-ADH and its mutant in E. coli,"3.1 Expression and purification of LK-ADH and its mutant in E. coli LK-ADH and its mutant require the cofactor NADPH to catalyze the asymmetric reduction of related ketones, such as tert-butyl (S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate for the synthesis of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, and (S)-1-(2, 6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl) ethanol for the synthesis of crizotinib [16,17]. However, the high cost of NADPH hinders the large-scale production of target chiral alcohols. Therefore, a NADPH regeneration system was developed to reduce the production cost by adding GDH into the reaction mixture [20–23]. As shown in Fig. 2 A, recombinant LK-ADH, LK-TADH and GDH were expressed successfully in E. coli. The SDS-PAGE result indicated that the molecular weights (MWs) of LK-ADH and LK-TADH were approximately 27 kDa, and the MW of GDH was approximately 29 kDa, values that are consistent with the predicted MWs according to their amino acid sequences (LK-ADH 26.87 kDa, and GDH 28.42 kDa). In addition, the protein expression levels of LK-ADH and LK-TADH were almost identical, indicating that four amino acid mutations did not affect the expression of LK-ADH protein. In addition, the purified enzymes (Fig. 2B) were used for determining the kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzymes. The Km and V max of recombinant LK-ADH were 1.97 mM and 13.4 U/mg, whereas the Km and V max of recombinant LK-TADH was 0.98 mM and 33.48 U/mg."
12,Using LK-ADH and LK-TADH to produce (S)-CPEO,"3.2 Using LK-ADH and LK-TADH to produce (S)-CPEO Recombinant LK-ADH and LK-TADH were coupled with recombinant GDH to catalyze asymmetric reduction of CPE. As shown in Fig. 3 , a conversion value close to 56% was observed for recombinant LK-ADH and the ee values for the product was 87.3% after a 12-h reaction. However, a conversion value close to 100% was observed for recombinant LK-TADH with an ee value for the product of 99.4% after a 12-h reaction. Based on the high conversion rate and high ee values, recombinant LK-TADH was chosen for further study."
13,Elucidating the mechanism of the enhanced catalytic ability,"3.3 Elucidating the mechanism of the enhanced catalytic ability Molecular homology modeling and substrate docking simulation are often used to elucidate the mechanism underlying the enhanced activity of enzymes and their related mutants [25–27]. Our results showed that LK-TADH had a higher catalytic efficiency and ee value than LK-ADH (Fig. 3). To further investigate the interaction of CPE with amino acids in LK-ADH and LK-TADH, the binding mode of these two enzymes was analyzed by molecular docking simulation using AutoDock 4.2.6. As shown in Fig. 4 A-a and B-a, CPE is bound mainly in the hydrophobic cavity of the enzyme, forming hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding environment. In addition, the binding energy of CPE with LK-ADH and LK-TADH was -5.28 and -5.44 kcal/mol, respectively. In terms of binding energy, the affinity between the protein and CPE was increased by the mutation, indicating that the mutation sites in LK-TADH contribute to improved efficiency of the enzyme. In addition, the substrate is closed to NADPH in spatial position at a suitable distance to meet the conditions required for the catalytic reaction. This finding also supports the reliability of the results of our molecular docking studies. The binding energy and conformation predicted by the molecular docking simulation confirmed that CPE binds to the active site of ADH in the appropriate catalytic conformation. To further investigate the interaction between CPE and amino acid residues in ADH, the binding mode of CPE with the enzyme was further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4A-b and B-b, the substrate had the same binding pattern as LK-ADH and LK-TADH binding mainly in the pockets formed by Ala94 or Thr94, Ser143, Leu153, Tyr156, Tyr190, Leu195, Val196, Met206 and NADPH. A hydrogen bond is formed between the substrate and Ser143 and Tyr156, in addition to a strong hydrophobic effect between the substrate and Tyr156, Leu153, Leu195, Val196 and Tyr190. These interactions enhanced the affinity of the substrate for LK-ADH and LK-TADH, indicating their importance in the recognition of substrate by LK-ADH and LK-TADH. According to the proposed ADH catalytic mechanism, the cofactor NADPH-C4-H gives its hydrogen atoms to the carbonyl carbon of the substrate [28,29]. So, the distances between NADPH-C4 atom and carbonyl carbon play an important role in determining the catalytic activity of the ADH toward ketones [25,30]. For LK-ADH and LK-TADH, the distances between the NADPH-C4 atoms and carbonyl carbon were 2.90 Å and 2.79 Å, respectively. The shorter distance indicates higher enzyme activity of LK-TADH toward CPE, and a higher frequency of transformation of CPE to the S-enantiomer of the target alcohol, which was consistent with lower Km value (0.98) and higher ee value (99.4%) of LK-TADH toward CPE. In addition, due to the presence of the A202L and L199H mutations in LK-TADH, the volume of the active pocket was reduced, restricting access by the substrate. This is another reason for the high catalytic efficiency and high ee value of LK-TADH."
14,Effect of substrate concentration on the reaction,"3.4 Effect of substrate concentration on the reaction According to previous studies, the optimal pH and temperature of LK-ADH and its related mutant are approximately 7.0 and 30 °C, respectively [16,17]; therefore, these conditions were adopted in the present study. In addition, previous studies indicated accumulation of NADPH or NADP+ in the recombinant E. coli cells [31]; therefore, an additional NADP+ (0.05 g/L) was added into the reaction to ensure the availability of sufficient coenzymes to produce (S)-CPEO [16]. The potential for industrial up-scaling of the process of chiral alcohol production is determined by the substrate concentration. Therefore, the concentration of substrate (20–100 g/L) was optimized in our study. As shown in Fig. 5 , 100% conversion rate was obtained with substrate concentrations between 20 g/L to 60 g/L. However, when the substrate concentration exceeded 80 g/L, the conversion rate was reduced to 81%. Furthermore, the conversion rate was only 60% when the CPE concentration reached 100 g/L. Our result indicated that the concentration of substrate (more than 80 g/L) will inhibit the reaction, and it cannot be totally transformed to the product. However, in order to use this enzyme for large-scale preparation (S)-CPEO for industrial applications, site-directed mutagenesis or error-prone PCR should be adopted to improve the catalytic capacity of this enzyme [24,25]. Based on these observations, 60 g/L of CPE was used for preparing the target product."
15,Preparation of (S)-CPEO using the LK-TADH,"3.5 Preparation of (S)-CPEO using the LK-TADH The possible usage of LK-TADH in the asymmetric reduction of CPE to synthesize (S)-CPEO was further evaluated. The optimum biotransformation conditions were as follows: 50 g/L recombinant LK-TADH wet-cells lysate, 5 mL GDH (3 kU/mL), 0.05 g/L NADP+, glucose-to-substrate ratio (1.2 mol/mol), and 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 7.0). Under these conditions, 60 g/L of CPE was completely converted into (S)-CPEO within 6 h and the final yield was approximately 91.5%. The optical purity of (S)-CPEO was determined to be 99.5% using chiral HPLC (Fig. 6 A). The 1H-NMR results were as follows: 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ2.90 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H, OH), δ3.54 (dd, J = 8.4, 11.6 Hz, 1H, CHH’Cl), δ3.90 (dd, J = 3.2, 11.2 Hz, 1H, CHH’Cl), δ5.28 (m, 1H, CH), δ7.34 (dd, J = 2,8.4, 1H, PhH), δ7.40 (d, J = 2 Hz, 1H, PhH), δ7.60 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H, PhH) (Fig. 6B)."
16,Comparison with other biological methods of (S)-CPEO production,"3.6 Comparison with other biological methods of (S)-CPEO production It is interesting to compare our results with other studies that have been published in the literature (Table 1 ). Although (S)-CPEO can be prepared from rac-2-chloro-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl) ethyl acetate using lipases with high ee values, this method is limited by a 50% theoretical yield [4]. The recombinant LB-ADH from L. brevis is capable of catalyzing the conversion of CPE to (S)-CPEO, but the CPE concentration was low (2.2 g/L) and the ee value was unsatisfactory (90%) [5]. Recombinant Dh-ADH from D. hansenii was able to transform 44.4 g/L of CPE into (S)-CPEO with a yield of 89% in a 12-h reaction, and the ee value was more than 99% [15]. However, in this study, 60 g/L of CPE was completely converted into (S)-CPEO after 6-h reaction, and the ee value of (S)-CPEO was 99.5%."
17,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we showed that 60 g/L of CPE was completely converted into (S)-CPEO in a 6-h reaction at 35 °C using a tetrad mutant LK-TADH (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) coupled with GDH from B. subtilis. Thus, the productivity of the reaction was 360 g/L/d and the ee value of the final pure product was 99.5%. In subsequent studies, site-directed mutagenesis or error-prone PCR will be adopted to improve the catalytic capacity of this enzyme for use in the large-scale preparation (S)-CPEO for industrial applications."
