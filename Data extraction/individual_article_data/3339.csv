0,Introduction,"Converting CO2 into fuel and value-added chemicals is a prospective way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving C neutrality in the coming decades [1–4]. Methanol (MeOH) is not only an important C1 commodity in the chemical industry but also one kind of clean energy that can potentially replace fossil energy [5]. Therefore, CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH shows environmental protection effects and large-scale application prospects. Given that CO2 is chemically inert and has a high equilibrium conversion rate at low temperatures as demonstrated through thermodynamic calculations, an efficient and stable catalyst is essential for CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH. Catalysts applied in CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH are generally divided into four categories, namely, Cu-based catalysts [6–8], noble-metal-supported catalysts [9,10], metal oxide solid solution catalysts [11], and metal–organic frameworks [12]. Although Cu-based catalysts have the advantages of high activity, low reaction temperature, and low cost, they have the crucial problem of instability caused by the growth of Cu particles and the variation of Cu valence. The surface area of Cu is closely related to CO2 conversion. The reduction in Cu surface area during Cu particle sintering leads to rapid deactivation during catalytic performance. Researchers have often used impregnation, urea-assisted precipitation, ammonia evaporation, and hydrothermal methods to stabilize Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) on the surfaces of SiO2 carriers to increase the specific surface area of Cu and improve the utilization ratio of Cu atoms [13,14]. Generally, the morphology of the SiO2 carrier prepared through traditional methods is difficult to control. The sizes of Cu particles can be stabilized by the interaction between Cu and SiO2. The morphological confinement effect of the SiO2 carrier in combination with metal-support interaction further helps maintain the size of metal nanoparticles [15,16]. In the Cu phyllosilicate nanotubes (CuSi-NT), Cu NPs can be in situ exsoluted and socketed onto parent CuSi-NT with diameters of approximately 10 nm [17]. Strong interactions between Cu NPs and parent CuSi-NT exist after calcination and reduction because the precursor of CuSi-NT shows a coiled double-sheet structure that is composed of octahedral CuO(OH) sheets and tetrahedral SiO2 sheets (Fig. 1 ). CuSi-NT not only undergoes interactions on the Cu–O–Si interface to limit the migration of Cu particles but also exerts the confinement effect on nanotubes to decelerate the sintering of Cu particles [18]. Moreover, H2 can be dissociated in the form of Cu–Hδ− and SiO–Hδ+ species, which can enhance the hydrogenation of CO bonds [19–21]. Therefore, CuSi-NT shows the potential to activate CO2 efficiently. Another difficulty encountered in the design of stable Cu-based catalysts is the adjustment and stabilization of the ratio of Cu+/Cu0 species, which affects product selectivity. Cu0 is generally recognized to be capable of dissociating H2, and Cu+ can stabilize the intermediate methoxy (CH3O*) species [17]. The synergistic effect of Cu+ and Cu0 is beneficial for improving MeOH selectivity. The addition of metal oxides, such as ZrO x [22], CeO x [23], and TiO x [24], as promoters changes the chemical properties of catalysts in terms of ion valence, particle size, and reducibility. At the same time, doping alkalescent elements, such as Ca [25], Ba [26], and La [6], as promoters can enhance the adsorption capacity of acidic CO2. Our previous studies have summarized that Cu–La oxide (LaO x ) interfaces can not only enhance CO2 adsorption capacity but also adjust the reaction path to prefer the formate (HCOO*) route instead of the hydrocarboxyl route, thereby inhibiting CO formation and improving MeOH selectivity [6,27]. It is known that the Cu loading can be as high as 90 wt% with nanosized Cu particle size in Cu–SiO2 catalysts prepared by sol-gel approach, although the sintering of Cu particles may inevitably occur during the catalytic reaction [28]. However, when the catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method, it is difficult to maintain the Cu particle size below 10 nm at a loading higher than 10 wt%. Either large Cu particle size or low Cu content are not conducive to CO2 conversion in CO2 hydrogenation. In this work, two strategies are used simultaneously to ameliorate the problems of the easy sintering of Cu particles and the difficult control of Cu valence in CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH with a Cu-based catalyst (Fig. 1). LaO x species are introduced onto CuSi-NT synthesized through a hydrothermal method. The La/CuSi-NT catalyst with Cu NPs is then obtained through in situ exsolution under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Use of CuSi-NT precursor can synthesis Cu particles and Cu–Si tubular carriers at the same time, which can possibly enhance the interation of active Cu species, support, and promoter, and is different from the traditional methods such as sol-gel, co-precipitation, and impregnation [6,27,28]. The Cu+/Cu0 ratio and CO2 adsorption capacity of La/CuSi-NT can be adjusted and enhanced through varying the La amount by exploiting the fact that the interaction of Cu and SiO2 and the confinement function of nanotubes together inhibit the sintering of Cu particles. Characteristic studies by using several spectroscopic techniques reveal that the catalyst La/CuSi-NT has excellent performance in CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH because it exhibits high Cu dispersion, strong metal-support interactions, and a favorable ratio of active Cu+/Cu0 species. The goal of this work is to study the effect of interaction of Cu with SiO2 carrier and La additive on the catalytic performance and to improve the efficiency of Cu atoms in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of CuSi-NT catalyst. The CuSi-NT catalyst was synthesized through a hydrothermal method followed by in situ exsolution. Typically, 1.21 g of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O and 1.61 g of NH4Cl were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. The salt solution was stirred, dissolved, and then added with 5.0 mL of NH3∙H2O to form a blue Cu ammonia complex solution that was labeled as solution A. A total of 1.00 g of colloidal silica (Ludox-AS-40) was suspended in 50 mL of deionized water. The resulting solution was labeled as solution B. Subsequently, solution B was added dropwise into solution A and then stirred for 6 h. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C in an oven for 48 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the blue precipitate was collected via centrifugation and washed to neutrality by using deionized water. After drying, the precursor was calcinated in air at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Prior to the reaction, the sample was reduced with H2/N2 (5/95, v/v) at 300 °C for 2 h with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The catalyst was denoted as CuSi-NT. Synthesis of xLa/CuSi-NT catalyst. La was supported on the dried CuSi-NT precursor through impregnation. La(NO3)3∙6H2O and citric acid were dissolved in deionized water. The CuSi-NT precursor was then added. The molar ratio of citric acid to La was fixed at 3. The La/Cu molar ratio was variably labeled as x (x is 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). After ultrasonic dispersion and overnight stabilization, the mixture was dried at 100 °C in an oven. Finally, the samples were calcined and reduced under the same conditions as CuSi-NT to afford the xLa/CuSi-NT catalyst. Synthesis of 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst. The 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst was prepared through impregnation. A total of 2.28 g of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O, 0.935 g of La(NO3)3∙6H2O, and 5.00 g of colloidal silica were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water with stirring for 30 min. After drying, the precipitate was calcined and reduced under the same conditions as CuSi-NT to afford the 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst. Synthesis of 0.2La/CuSi-DP catalyst. The 0.2La/CuSi-DP catalyst was prepared via deposition precipitation. A total of 2.28 g of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O, 0.935 g of La(NO3)3∙6H2O, and 5.00 g of colloidal silica were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water at 70 °C. The solution was labeled as solution C. A total of 6.30 g of urea was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. The resulting solution was labeled as solution D. Then, solution D was added dropwise to solution C. The mixture was heated to 90 °C and refluxed for 12 h. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried overnight. Subsequently, the powder was calcined and reduced under the same conditions as CuSi-NT to afford the 0.2La/CuSi-DP catalyst. Synthesis of 0.2La/CuSi-AE catalyst. The 0.2La/CuSi-AE catalyst was prepared through ammonia evaporation. After dissolving 2.28 g of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O and 0.935 g of La(NO3)3∙6H2O in 200 mL of deionized water, 5.0 mL of NH3∙H2O and 5.00 g of colloidal silica were added into the solution successively. Then, the mixture was heated to 80 °C and refluxed until its pH decreased to 7. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried overnight. Then, the powder was calcined and reduced under the same conditions as CuSi-NT to afford the 0.2La/CuSi-AE catalyst. Synthesis of 0.2La/CuSi-HT catalyst. The 0.2La/CuSi-HT catalyst was prepared by applying the hydrothermal method. A total of 1.21 g of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O, 0.433 g of La(NO3)3∙6H2O, 1.61 g of NH4Cl, and 5.0 mL of NH3∙H2O were dissolved successively in 100 mL of deionized water. A total of 1.00 g of colloidal silica was suspended in 50 mL of deionized water and added dropwise to the above solution. After stirring for 6 h, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C in an oven for 24 h. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried overnight. Then, the powder was calcined and reduced under the same conditions as CuSi-NT to afford the 0.2La/CuSi-HT catalyst."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a Cu–Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves were acquired on Micromeritics Tristar II 3020. Specific surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra were collected on a Bruker S8 TIGER spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai F30 apparatus with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) were performed with a Quantum 2000 instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al–Kα source (Kα = 1486.6 eV) and a charge neutralizer. Catalysts were prereduced before testing and stored in inert atmosphere. All peaks were calibrated on the basis of the contaminative carbon species on the catalyst surface (284.6 eV). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the Cu K absorption edge were recorded in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BL14W1). Given that Cu NPs are highly sensitive to the air, the sample was reduced and sealed without air exposure. Afterward, the sample was transferred to the analytical cell in a glove box. EXAFS spectra were analyzed and fitted by using Athena and Artemis software on the basis of a standard procedure. The amplitude reduction factor was obtained from the analysis of the Cu foil, which was used as a fixed input parameter to allow refinement in the coordination number and bond distance of the absorption element. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 apparatus equipped with a Hg Cd Te detector at the pressure of 0.1 MPa. The catalysts were reduced in the diffuse reflection cell before testing. Cu surface area and dispersion were measured by using N2O oxidation and H2 pulse reduction methods on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. First, the catalysts were reduced under H2/N2 (5/95, v/v) atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min, and the amount of H2 consumption was denoted as X. Second, N2O was introduced over the catalysts at 60 °C for 1 h to oxidize surface Cu0 into Cu2O. Finally, pulsed H2 was passed through the catalysts at 300 °C until the H2 peak area did not change in the thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the amount of H2 consumption was denoted as Y. Cu dispersion (D Cu) was calculated in accordance with Eq. (1). (1) D C u = 2 Y X × 100 % ."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation Catalytic performance was evaluated on a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor equipped with a quartz sample tube. Before the evaluation, 50 mg of the as-calcined catalyst (40–60 mesh) was mixed with quartz sand to fix the catalyst bed height to 2 cm and reduced by H2/N2 (5/95, v/v) at 300 °C for 2 h with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. After the temperature was decreased to the ambient temperature, H2/CO2/N2 (72/24/4, v/v/v) mixed gas was introduced into the reactor. The reaction was carried out at 240 °C and 3.0 MPa with a gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 12 000 mL g−1 h−1. Outlet gases were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs (GCs) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a TCD. CO2 conversion (X CO2) was calculated in accordance with Eq. (2). (2) X C O 2 % = C O 2 i n - C O 2 o u t C O 2 i n × 100 % , where [CO2]in and [CO2]out represent CO2 concentrations in the inlet and outlet gases, respectively. The amount of CO is measured by a GC equipped with a TCD, and the amounts of CH3OH and CH4 are measured by a FID. The selectivity calculation formulas are shown in Eqs. (3) and (4). CO selectivity (SCO) was calculated in accordance with Eq. (3). (3) S C O % = C O o u t C O 2 i n - C O 2 o u t × 100 % , where [CO]out represents the CO concentration in the outlet gas. CH3OH selectivity (SCH3OH) was calculated in accordance with Eq. (4). (4) S C H 3 O H % = C H 3 O H o u t C H 3 O H o u t + C H 4 o u t × 1 - S C O × 100 % , where [CH3OH]out and [CH4]out represent CH3OH and CH4 concentrations in the outlet gas, respectively. MeOH space-time yield based on the weight of catalyst (STY) was calculated in accordance with Eq. (5). (5) S T Y m g g c a t - 1 h - 1 = G H S V × C C O 2 × X C O 2 × S C H 3 O H × M C H 3 O H V m , where GHSV represents gas hourly space velocity, 12,000 mL gcat −1 h−1. CCO2 represents the concentration of CO2 in the feed gas, 24%. MCH3OH represents the molar mass of MeOH, 32 g mol−1. Vm represents the molar volume of gas, 22.4 L mol−1."
5,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of La/CuSi-NT with different La/Cu molar ratios are shown in Fig. 2 a. When the La/Cu ratios are less than 0.1, the patterns conform to chrysocolla characteristic diffraction peaks (JCPDS No. 27-0188). As the molar ratio is increased, the diffraction peak intensity gradually decreases, indicating that the introduction of La inhibits the formation of the phyllosilicate structure. No Cu or La characteristic peak can be found when the La/Cu molar ratio is less than 0.2, demonstrating that Cu and La have high dispersity. However, CuO (JCPDS No. 45-0937) and SiO2 (JCPDS No. 86-2333) characteristic peaks appear when the La/Cu ratio is increased to 0.3. Given that the molar ratio of citric acid, the complexing agent, to La is fixed at 3 during La loading, the amount of citric acid used increases as the La/Cu molar ratio is increased. This behavior leads to the phase separation of Cu and Si, thus hindering phyllosilicate structure formation. The XRD patterns of the 0.2La/CuSi catalyst prepared through different methods are shown in Fig. 2b. The additive amount of the La/Cu molar ratio is fixed at 0.2. The Cu crystallite sizes of the 0.2La/CuSi catalyst prepared through different methods vary greatly and range from 4.3 nm to 25.4 nm as calculated by using the Scherrer formula. These results prove that 0.2La/CuSi-NT shows the best effect in suppressing the sintering of Cu particles. Fig. 2c provides the patterns of 0.2La/CuSi-NT reduced at different temperatures. As the reduction temperature is increased from 250 °C to 500 °C, the Cu characteristic peaks (JCPDS No. 65-9026) increase slightly, whereas the Cu2O peaks (JCPDS No. 77-0199) gradually weaken. This result also indicates that 0.2La/CuSi-NT shows the capability to resist sintering. The TEM image of Fig. 3 a shows that CuSi-NT exhibits a uniform tubular structure with a diameter of approximately 10 nm. Figs. 3b and S1a–b illustrate that this tubular structure can still be maintained when the La/Cu molar ratio is less than 0.2. When the La/Cu molar ratio increases to 0.3, a large amount of substance with an amorphous structure is observed around the tube as illustrated in Fig. S1c. Consistent with the XRD results provided in Fig. 2a, this amorphous substance may originate from CuSi-NT that has been dissolved by citric acid and then calcined into CuO and SiO2. After 0.2La/CuSi-NT is reduced, as depicted in Fig. 3c, Cu separates from the CuSi-NT tube and forms nanoparticles with diameters of less than 10 nm. Cu NPs are basically located on the internal and external surfaces of CuSi-NT. The tubular structure may have a restriction effect on the further growth of Cu particles. The contents of Cu and La, the dispersion of Cu, and the textural properties of La/CuSi-NT with different La/Cu molar ratios are presented in Table 1 . The results show that the La/Cu molar ratios are close to the amounts of raw materials added. Given that La is loaded on CuSi-NT through immersion, Cu dispersion has slightly increased from 8.5% (CuSi-NT) to 10.0% (0.2La/CuSi-NT) likely because the introduction of La species helps suppress the sintering of Cu particles. The low Cu dispersion of 0.3La/CuSi-NT may be caused by the coverage of surface Cu particles by excessive LaO x . Although specific surface area and pore volume decrease significantly with the increase in La loading amount, the pore diameter changes slightly. This result may be due to the partial dissolution of Cu phyllosilicate species on the CuSi-NT surfaces by the complexing agent citric acid, which is added during La loading. Then, new CuO x , SiO x , and LaO x particles are generated during the following calcination step. XPS and XAES are used to analyze the chemical environment of surface Cu, Si, O, and La elements to evaluate effects on chemical properties upon La species introduction. Survey scans are shown in Fig. 4 a. As the La/Cu molar ratio is increased, the peak intensity of La gradually increases, whereas the intensity of other peaks does not change significantly. In Cu 2p narrow scans (Fig. 4c), the peaks at 931.5 and 951.3 eV with a peak separation of 19.8 eV are assigned to the Cu0 or Cu+ characteristic peaks on 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. The absence of any satellite peak indicates the absence of Cu2+. Cu LMM spectra are detected and fitted as shown in Fig. 4b to further distinguish Cu0 and Cu+. The peaks at 914.8 and 918.3 eV are attributed to Cu+ and Cu0 species, respectively. The increase in Cu+/Cu0 ratio from 0.29 to 0.49 when the La/Cu molar ratio is gradually increased to 0.2 may be ascribed to the newly formed La–O–Cu interface. H2 and C–O bonds are activated on Cu0 and Cu+ species, respectively. The synergy between Cu0 and Cu+ in a certain ratio is beneficial for enhancing catalytic performance [1]. Si 2p spectra indicate that the shift of the Si–O peak from 102.7 eV to 102.4 eV with the increase in La content may be caused by the enhanced interaction between Cu and SiO2 (Fig. 4d) [13]. A new peak at 105.4 eV may be attributed to the Si–La bond generated in the reduction process [29]. The peaks at 531.8 and 529.5 eV in O 1s spectra are assigned to O–Si and O–La bonds (Fig. 4e). The La 3d peaks at 834.4, 837.9, 851.0, and 854.5 eV correspond to the peaks of La2O3 (Fig. 4f) [30]. Cu K-edge XANES and EXAFS analyses are performed to study the coordination environment of Cu species as shown in Fig. 5 a–b. The XANES spectra of CuSi-NT and 0.2La/CuSi-NT are close to the Cu foil spectrum and have slightly shifted to the high-energy region toward the Cu2O spectrum. These results indicate that the Cu atoms in CuSi-NT and 0.2La/CuSi-NT are mainly Cu0 and partially Cu+ species. The EXAFS profiles and structure parameters are given in Fig. 5b and Table 2 . The shell distances of 1.85 Å in Cu2O and 2.54 Å in Cu foil represent the Cu–O and Cu–Cu shells, respectively. The intensity ratio of Cu–O to Cu–Cu in 0.2La/CuSi-NT is higher than that in CuSi-NT. Structural parameters show that the Cu–O coordination number for 0.2La/CuSi-NT is 1.4, which is slightly higher than that for CuSi-NT. The finding indicates that the introduction of LaO x increases the amount of Cu–O bond, implying that the interfacial La–O–Cu species may be induced. These results again confirm that 0.2La/CuSi-NT has additional Cu+ species and are consistent with the results of XRD and XPS. The CO2-TPD mass signals for La/CuSi-NT with different La/Cu molar ratios are shown in Fig. 6 . Upon the introduction of La species, the temperature of the CO2 desorption peak in the high-temperature zone is reduced to approximately 600 °C, which is assigned to the carbonate species [6]. A new desorption peak appears at 300 °C–500 °C, and the peak area increases with the increase in La/Cu molar ratio. In consideration of the conclusion that the introduction of La helps increasing Cu+ species, the newly formed LaO x may interact with Cu through O and promote the formation of Cu+ species. The interface between LaO x and Cu may become another CO2 adsorption site [6]. In addition, La is alkaline and has a tendency to donate electrons, while CO2 activation needs electrons. Therefore, introducing La species could enhance the adsorption of CO2. Initially, as shown in Figs. S3 and S4, the CO2 hydrogenation catalytic performance of 0.2La/CuSi-NT is investigated at different reduction and reaction temperatures to evaluate the optimal reaction conditions. CO2 conversion gradually increases from 10.6% to 13.0% and product selectivity changes slightly when the reduction temperature is within the range of 250 °C–350 °C. MeOH, CO, and CH4 selectivities are approximately 79%, 16%, and 5%, respectively. When the reduction temperature is higher than 350 °C, the selectivity of the by-product CO and CH4 increase. At 500 °C, MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion drop to 49.7% and 6.9%, respectively, likely because of the change in Cu+/Cu0 ratio on the catalyst surface. Cu° is more favor to reducing CO2 to CH4, because of its high performance to activate H2. Catalytic performance at different reaction temperatures obviously varies (Fig. S4). As the reaction temperature is increased from 220 °C to 300 °C, MeOH selectivity decreases from 87.8% to 51.0%, and CO2 conversion increases from 3.3% to 23.9%. When the temperature reaches 280 °C, the MeOH STY is 513 mg gcat −1 h−1 and slightly drops to 504 mg gcat −1 h−1 at 300 °C. This result indicates that when the reaction temperature exceeds 280 °C, increasing the temperature can only increase the yield of CO and CH4 but not that of MeOH because RWGS is an endothermic reaction that is suitable for high-temperature conditions. The reduction temperature of 300 °C and reaction temperature of 240 °C are chosen for the following CO2 hydrogenation performance evaluation. The catalytic performances of La/CuSi-NT with different La/Cu molar ratios are shown in Fig. 7 a. MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion increase together to 80.2% and 13.0%, respectively, as the La/Cu molar ratio is increased from 0 to 0.2. MeOH STY reaches 428 mg gcat −1 h−1. The calculation of equilibrium conversion shows that the limitation of CO2 conversion and MeOH yield are about 16.4% and 14.9% at 240 °C and 3.0 MPa, respectively [31]. As the La/Cu molar ratio is increased to 0.3, MeOH selectivity, CO2 conversion, and MeOH STY decrease together. The consistency between the changing trend of catalytic performance and that of Cu+/Cu0 ratios revealed through XAES (Fig. 4b) indicates that increasing the Cu+ species may help improve catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH. The catalytic performance of SiO2-supported La/Cu catalysts prepared through various synthesis methods are shown in Fig. 7b and Table S1. The 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst shows the lowest MeOH STY of 74 mg gcat −1 h−1, whereas 0.2La/CuSi-NT shows the high MeOH STY of 428 mg gcat −1 h−1. On the basis of Table S1, we can conclude that the combined effects of La/Cu molar ratio, Cu dispersion, Cu crystallite size, and specific surface area affect catalytic performance. The catalytic performances of 0.2La/CuSi-NT and commercial available CuZnAl at 3.0 MPa and 5.0 MPa were compared, in order to evaluate the performance close to industrial operating conditions (Fig. S5). Results show that the CO2 conversion and MeOH selectivity of CuZnAl are lower than those of 0.2La/CuSi-NT at 3.0 MPa. CO is the main by-product and CH4 selectivity is less than 0.1% over CuZnAl. When the reaction pressure is improved from 3.0 MPa to 5.0 MPa, the CO2 conversion and MeOH selectivity increase from 13.0% to 15.8% and from 80.2% to 85.0% over 0.2La/CuSi-NT, respectively. Correspondingly, the CO2 conversion and MeOH selectivity increase from 8.4% to 9.7% and from 68.0% to 76.1% over CuZnAl, respectively. The findings indicate that the two catalysts can deliver higher CO2 conversion and MeOH selectivity when the reaction pressure is improved. This is because that the hydrogenation of CO2 to MeOH is a process of decreasing molecule number, while the RWGS reaction does not change the molecule number [32]. The catalyst stability test results for 0.2La/CuSi-NT, CuSi-NT, and 0.2La/CuSi-IM are presented in Fig. 7c. The MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion of 0.2La/CuSi-NT and CuSi-NT show no obvious decline during the run time of 200 h, whereas those of 0.2La/CuSi-IM decrease rapidly within 50 h of run time. The combined results of XRD (Fig. 8 a) and TEM (Fig. 8b) indicate that the phyllosilicate nanotube structure has an excellent capability to stabilize Cu NPs. The MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion of 0.2La/CuSi-NT are approximately 80% and 12%, respectively, and are higher than those of 0.2La/CuSi-NT and CuSi-NT. The MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion of CuSi-NT are only 59% and 7%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the introduction of La into CuSi-NT can improve catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH while maintaining excellent stability. XRD and TEM characterizations are carried out on the 0.2La/CuSi-NT catalyst used for 200 h and the 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst used for 50 h to investigate the changes in the phase and morphology of the catalysts after the stability test (Fig. 8). In XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 8a, the Cu diffraction peak of 0.2La/CuSi-NT at 43.3° has narrowed and the Cu2O diffraction peak at 36.5° has disappeared after the stability test. These results indicate that Cu2O particles may be reduced into Cu particles or redispersed to levels below the detection limit. For the 0.2La/CuSi-IM catalyst after the stability test, the diffraction peak of Cu increases prominently and the Cu2O peak disappears. The crystallite size calculated with the Scherrer formula shows that the Cu particles of 0.2La/CuSi-NT and 0.2La/CuSi-IM have increased by 5.3 and 30.1 nm after the stability test, respectively. As can be inferred from these results and in correspondence with the results of the stability test given in the Fig. 7c, the Cu phyllosilicate nanotube shows better anti-sintering performance than the traditional catalyst prepared through impregnation. The TEM image of the 0.2La/CuSi-NT catalyst used for 200 h is provided in Fig. 8b. The Cu particle size after the stability test has slightly increased compared with that before the stability test as shown in Fig. 3c. As illustrated in Fig. 8c–d, the Cu particle size of 0.2La/CuSi-IM has almost doubled after the stability test. These results indicate that the Cu phyllosilicate nanotube may enhance the anti-sintering capability of Cu particles through the interaction of Cu–O–Si interface or the confinement effect of the 10 nm diameter tube. In situ DRIFTS was used to detect reaction intermediates to propose a possible reaction path. The results are presented in Fig. 9 . Two characteristic peaks appear at 2924 and 2838 cm−1 when CuSi-NT is used (Fig. 9a) and are assigned to the asymmetric stretching and symmetric stretching vibrations of C–H bond for CH2*, respectively [33]. In addition, the weak peak at 1348 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of C–O bond for unidentate cabonate [34]. Notably, the intensity of the C–O bond is much weaker than that of the C–H bond as indicated by the scale bar. A new peak appears at 1580 cm−1 in the spectra of 0.2La/CuSi-NT (Fig. 9b) and is attributed to the O–C–O stretching vibration for HCOO* [35,36]. The peak of HCOO* is considerably higher than that of CH2* and CO3* as shown by the scale bar. These results indicate that CuSi-NT possesses excessive CO2 hydrogenation capacity, thus inducing a large amount of deeply hydrogenated CH2* species but few oxygen-containing active species on the catalyst surface. This characteristic is consistent with the higher Cu0/Cu+ ratio and lower MeOH selectivity and CO2 conversion of CuSi-NT than those of 0.2La/CuSi-NT as revealed through XRD, XPS, XANES, EXAFS, and catalytic performance tests. Compared with CuSi-NT, 0.2La/CuSi-NT shows more surface-adsorbed active oxygen species. In particular, it has a large amount of HCOO*, which is not traced in CuSi-NT. The HCOO* species is more beneficial to the generation of MeOH than other species [37–39]. The appearance of HCOO* on the surface of 0.2La/CuSi-NT but not in CuSi-NT in this study may be related to the introduction of La species."
6,Conclusions,"La/CuSi-NT catalysts with different La/Cu molar ratios are prepared to enhance the stability of Cu-based catalysts in the catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH. Compared with the La/CuSi catalysts prepared through traditional impregnation, deposition precipitation, ammonia evaporation, and hydrothermal methods, the La/CuSi-NT catalysts with a nanotube diameter of approximately 10 nm show higher MeOH yield and excellent stability. The characterization analyses of the catalyst after the reaction indicate that the Cu particles socketed in CuSi-NT show strong interactions on the Cu–SiO2 interface that can stabilize the Cu+/Cu0 ratio and Cu particle size. The 0.2La/CuSi-NT catalyst provides MeOH yields of up to 428 mg gcat −1 h−1 and remains stable in the 200 h stability test. The results of XRD, XPS, XANES, and EXAFS indicate that Cu+/Cu0 ratios in La/CuSi-NT catalysts are higher than those in CuSi-NT likely because of the generation of La–O–Cu species. The characterization analyses of the used 0.2La/CuSi-NT indicate that the size of Cu particles socketed in parent CuSi-NT increases by only 5.3 nm after run-on streaming for 200 h. In situ DRIFTS spectra confirm that 0.2La/CuSi-NT is helpful for forming HCOO* species, which is beneficial for increasing the MeOH yield. Findings on the importance of nanosocketed Cu particles and La–O–Cu interfaces may shed some light on the rational design of stable and effective Cu-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH."
