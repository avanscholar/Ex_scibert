0,Introduction,"Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) features good biodegradability, water solubility, and high mechanical properties, and thus has found extensive industrial applications in drug delivery [1], membranes separation system [2,3], packaging [4–6], tissue engineering [7], and hydrogels and microgels as well as films [8,9]. Recent research interests are focused on the design of mechanically robust PVA materials towards the applications such as high-performance films, fibers, and artificial ligaments and muscles [10]. Until now, a number of reinforcement agents have been explored to create strong PVA materials, including MXene [11], graphene oxides [12], carbon nanotubes [13], and nanoparticles [14,15], small molecules [16,17] and organic polymers [18,19]. Unfortunately, as-used PVA matrices in the different conditions often exhibit very different mechanical behaviors during tensile tests (see Fig. 1 a). This, however, renders it impossible to accurately compare the mechanical performances of the final PVA composites reinforced by different reinforcement agents. More interestingly, such mechanical behaviors of PVA are clearly independent of the endopathic factors, such as the molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis, and the exopathic factors like the tensile rates during testing (see Fig. 1a). Therefore, there should exist another key factor that governs the mechanical properties of PVA behind. Our previous work has indicated that the different tensile behavior in PVA bulk is probably due to the drying conditions during the film preparation, which leads to different water contents in PVA [16,17]. It is well known that water can have a significant impact on the mechanical behavior of PVA due to its high moisture sensitivity. Therefore, it is of paramount significance to reveal how water contents (or the degree of hydration) affect the mechanical properties of PVA. Up to date such long-standing intriguing question has never been answered satisfactorily. To date, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been intensively employed to unveil the effect of water contents on the structure, glass transition and dynamics of PVA chain [2,20–24]. By contrast, only few experiments have been carried out to partially understand this phenomenon so far [25–28]. Zhang et al. pioneered to use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the elastic modulus of PVA in water and found that the H-bonding governs the modulus of PVA [25]. Briscoe et al. found that the viscosity of aqueous PVA solutions depend on the H-bonding interactions [26]. In addition, Hodge et al. revealed that the plasticization effect of water was due to the increased free volume of water, which caused the lubrication effect once the water molecules disrupted the H-bonding interactions among PVA chains [27,28]. Given the above literature analyses, although great advances have been made on PVA systems containing various water contents, three key questions remain unveiled. Specifically: (i) How do water contents govern mechanical properties (tensile strength, elastic modulus, and ductility as well as toughness) of PVA? which has been ignored by materials scientists so far. This research gap makes it impossible to evaluate the mechanical reinforcement effect of different fillers on the PVA matrix accurately due to different water contents [11–19] (see Fig. 1a); (ii) Current work mainly relies on the use of the MD simulation to understand the impact of water contents on structure, glass transition and chain dynamics of PVA [2,20–24], but lacks corresponding experimental validations; and (iii) to date only few experimental investigations have been performed on the effect of water on elastics modulus [25], viscosity [26], free volume and H-bonding [27,28] of PVA. Hence, there remains an urgent lack of an in-depth comprehensive insights on how water contents govern the mechanical properties (strength, modulus, ductility, toughness) and molecular movements of PVA as well as their intermolecular H-bond interactions. This study aims to employ MD simulation and experiment to understand the impact of water contents on the mechanical property, glass transition, free volume, chain movements of PVA as well as their intermolecular H-bonding interactions. Our results show that both tensile strength and elastic modulus of PVA steadily decrease while the strain-at-break increases first and then decreases with increasing water contents (up to 20 wt%). Only 1.8 wt% water can lead to a brittle-ductile transition during tension. The presence of water molecules can disrupt the H-bonding interactions among PVA chains by replacing H-bonds between water and PVA, leading to reduced mechanical strength and elastic modulus, a decreased glass transition temperature and an increased mobility of PVA chains. This work helps us to understand the relationship between the water content and the mechanical performance of PVA, and the plasticization effect of water on PVA."
1,Experimental,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials PVA with a M w of ~2.7 × 104 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and its degree of hydrolysis was 98.0–98.8%."
3,Fabrication of PVA films,"2.2 Fabrication of PVA films 2.0 g PVA granules were dissolved in 38 g deionized water by heating to 70 °C to prepare a 5 wt% aqueous PVA solution. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was slowly decanted into a glass mold followed by drying for 48 h at ambient temperature and then 3 h at 50 °C in an oven. These dry PVA films with typical thickness of 70 (±10) μm were then cut into rectangular samples. All the PVA films were dried at 80 °C under reduced pressure for 24 h to obtain absolutely dry PVA films (see the process in Fig. 1b). All the dry films were then divided into 9 groups and put into a glass bottle. A predesigned 1.0 wt%, 2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt% water was added into bottle which were then sealed. The samples were designated as PVA-x, where x refers to the predesigned water content by mass fraction. The dry PVA was still named as PVA. The PVA films were kept in the sealed bottle at ambient temperature for a week to ensure the water content reaches an equilibrium. The real water content in the predesigned PVA-x film was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis carried out in N2 condition. After that x was replaced by real water content respectively. For example, 25 mg deionized water was injected into a 100 cm3 bottle containing 1 g of completely dry PVA film, then named PVA-2.5, and renamed as the PVA-1.8 according to its real water content (~1.8 wt%)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The tensile tests were measured on a SANS universal testing machine (CMT 6000) with a capacity of 200 N using a test rate of 5 mm/min at 23 ± 2 °C under a relative humidity of 30%. As-prepared tensile specimens of PVA films were 30 mm long, 5 mm wide and 70 (±10) μm in thickness with a gauge length of 10 mm. The mechanical data reported in this work were the mean of quintuplicate measurements. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a Netzsch TG 209F1 Libra (TGA, Germany) at a heating rate of 3 °C/min in a temperature range of 35–180 °C in nitrogen to determine the real water content of PVA films. Each specimen was measured twice, namely, before and after tensile testing, and the average was reported as the real water content of the PVA film. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA Q2000 instrument (DSC, USA). Typically, ~7 mg PVA slices were encapsulated in an aluminum pan and cooled down to - 40 °C waits for 5 min before further process. After that all samples were heated from - 40 °C to 240 °C at scanning rate of 10 °C/min and kept 240 °C for 3 min (1st cycle), and then cooled to 10 °C at the same rate and left for 3 min (2nd cycle) followed by reheating to 240 °C at the same rate (3rd cycle). The glass transition temperature (T g) was determined as the midpoint of two tangent lines of the first cycle, and the enthalpy of vaporization of water and the melting enthalpy of PVA was obtained by integrating the peak of vaporization and melting using the TA universal analysis software using both 1st and 3rd cycle curve. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) measurements were performed using a conventional Ortec fast–fast coincident spectrometer at room temperature (26 °C). A22Na positron source was placed between two identical samples with a 15 mm in width, 15 mm in length and 1.0 mm in thickness. A million counts were collected from annihilation events. The time resolution of the spectrometer is about 270 ps (FWHM). The measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid oxygen interference [29]. For PVA-water systems, all of the PALS measurements were analyzed into three mean lifetimes, intensities, using PALSFIT [30]. When a positron is injected into polymer two different states may exist, free positron and positron-electron bounded state (Ps). Ps can be divided into ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and para-positronium (p-Ps), due to the spin combination state of positron and electron. The shortest lifetime is the self-annihilation of para-positronium (τ 1 ~ 125 ps). The intermediate lifetime (τ 2 ~ 400 ps) is attributed to the annihilation of free positrons and positron-molecule species. The longest component (τ 3 > 600 ps) was primarily due to the annihilation of ortho-positronium. Based on the fact that o-Ps is preferentially localized in lower electron density region before the annihilation occurs, such as a defect or free volume holes, and the mean lifetime of ortho-positronium are largely affected by the size and concentration of cavities. The most used model30 is a spherical well (with a radius of R+ΔR) that has an infinite potential barrier with a homogeneous electron layer in the region of R < r < R+ΔR. Then, the correlation between the mean radius (R) of the free volume holes and the o-Ps lifetime (τ3) can be expressed using the following semi-empirical equation [31]: (3) τ 3 = 1 2 [ 1 − R R + ΔR + 1 2 π sin ( 2 πR R + ΔR ) ] − 1 where R and τ3 are expressed in the units of angstroms and nanoseconds, respectively. ΔR has been empirically found to be 1.656 Å [32]. Based on spherical approximation, the mean volume of free volume holes can be calculated by this equation: (4) V f = 4 3 π R 3 where R is obtained from τ 3 using equation (3). Due to the correlation between the relative intensity of o-Ps annihilation (I 3) and the concentration of free volume holes, a semi-empirical equation has been summarized to determine the fraction free volume (FFV) in the following expression: (5) F F V = C V f I 3 where free volume V f is in the units of Å3, and the relative annihilation intensity of o-Ps (I 3 in %) is obtained from PALS measurement. C is the empirical parameter that can be determined by calibrating with other physical parameters [33], such as free volume expansion coefficient (αf). For each sample with T g below measuring temperature (26 °C), the fraction of free volume (FFV) also can be calculated using the following equation: (6) FFV = 0.025 + ( T − T g ) α f where it is assumed that the fraction of free volume at T g is 0.025, the thermal free volume expansion coefficient (αf) used in this work is 4.8*10−4 K−1 [34]. Then the mean value of parameter C can be obtained by above equation (5) and equation (6) simultaneously. Infrared (IR) spectra of PVA films were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet iS10, (Thermo Scientific, Germany) using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode and the measurement was carried out at high-resolution spectra 2.0 cm−1 resolution and 64 scans in the range of 675–4000 cm−1. The IR spectrum of liquid water was recorded by dipping one drop of water on a KBr disk. To identify the H-bond types in water and PVA, the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups (O–H) was analyzed by using peak analyzer fitting in the Origin 2017 software in the range of 3000–3750 cm−1 based on Gauss formula (Equation 1 and 2, shown below) according to the previously-reported principles (the subtract spectrum methods) [35,36]. (7) y = y 0 + A w ⋅ π / 2 e − 2 ( x − x c ) 2 w 2 (8) w = FWHM / ln 4 where y0 was the baseline offset of the fitting curve, x c was the peak position, A was the total peak area, FWHM was the full width at half maximum of the fitting peak. The x c values of these peaks were kept constant, while the values of A and w were allowed to vary in the fitting process. And the peak position x c is determined by IR subtraction spectrum (see supporting information Figure S11)."
5,Molecular dynamics simulations,"2.4 Molecular dynamics simulations In classical MD simulations, the positions and velocities of particles contained in the model system evolve as a function of time. The equations of motion are integrated using the Verlet velocity algorithm with a time step of 1 fs through the Materials Studio 8.0. The potential energy formalism which governing how the particles interact is an important ingredient in the MD simulations. In our case, we used the high-quality COMPASS force field (Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potential for Atomistic Simulation Studies), which has successfully applied on the prediction of the structural and dynamic features for many polymer materials [37,38]. For the water model, a simple three-point model is used in the COMPASS force field. The parameters including the bond length, bond angle and atom charges are similar to the TIP3P model. However, the bond-bond and bond-angle cross terms are also included. The system energy can be approximately estimated as the sum of different contributions. These contributions include the bonded and non-bonded interactions (see Fig. 1c)."
6,Establishment of initial model systems,"2.5 Establishment of initial model systems The structures of water and one single PVA chain with the repeat units of n = 99 were generated for the PVA-H2O system. Because as-used PVA in this work has a degree of hydrolysis of 98.0–98.8%, the number of repeat units of the PVA chain was set to n = 97 and two of the repeat units, namely, –CH2-CHOH-, were replaced by –CH2-CH(O) CH3- for more precise calculation, such as T g and elastic modulus. To obtain the minimum energy structure, we performed an energy minimization of the system through the conjugate gradient method algorithm to obtain appropriate input configuration for the following simulations. Then, model systems with different water content (φ = 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%) were constructed containing ten PVA chains in each system. The initial value of density for the configurations was assigned as 1.0 g/cm3. The periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were used to avoid surface effects. A set of ten configurations for each case were generated at the same time. Fig. 1 shows the composition of PVA and water molecules in the amorphous cells. The size of the PBC box changes for different cases and simulation stages (such as deforming the box for calculation of mechanical properties). As an example, the box size at equilibrium is about 40.93 Å × 40.93 Å × 40.93 Å for 10 wt%. The initial velocities of the atoms are generated by a temperature-dependent Gaussian distribution. The summation method to calculate long rang electrostatic interactions used the Ewald method with the accuracy of 0.001 kcal/mol. The cutoff distance is set to 9.5 Å. To avoid being trapped in the local energy minimum conformations, one cycle anneal dynamics procedure was conducted. During the process, we use NPT (constant number, pressure and temperature) to ensemble and the temperature and pressure are controlled using Andersen and Berendsen methods, respectively. In the annealing cycles, the initial temperature was 300 K and the highest temperature was 500 K with 10 numbers of ramps per cycle. The simulation for each ramp was 10000-time steps at the pressure of 0.0001 GPa. And then the NPT simulations run 500 ps to obtain the equilibrium density at 300 K. Finally, we collected the production data for another NPT simulations for 20ns to analyze the trajectories of simulations and calculate the related system properties."
7,Calculation of properties,"2.6 Calculation of properties The elastic moduli of PVA films can be calculated using static [39] or dynamic methods [40]. This work presented here was conducted with the dynamic method. In the method, the mechanical properties were evaluated through analyzed stress-strain curves. The strain rate set at ε = 10 8 s − 1 . In the range of elastic deformation, the strain tensor ε can be simplified by neglecting the second order terms in the derivatives of displacement. The stress tensor σ changes linearly with ε. They are symmetric tensors: ε LM = ε ML , σ LM = σ ML . The relationship between strain and stress is expressed according to Hook's law in the range of elastic deformation: σ LM = C LMNL* ε NK . By introducing the Voigt notation, the stiffness tensor for an isotropic material is simplified to (9) C = [ 2 μ + λ λ λ 0 0 0 λ 2 μ + λ λ 0 0 0 λ λ 2 μ + λ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ ] where, λ and μ are the Lamé constants. The Young's modulus (E) can be calculated by λ and μ: (10) E = μ 3 λ + 2 μ λ + μ Through analysis of strain-stress curves, we can obtain the Lamé constants and further calculate the elastic constant. The T g of a semicristalline polymer can be calculated through measuring fraction free volume (FFV), mean square displacement (MSD), network topology density or molecular energy components. The free volume theory [41,42] was used to characterize the interactions of molecules. The FFV at 300 K can be calculated by the following equation (11). (11) F F V = V f V f + V 0 100 % where v f and v0 are the free volume and the occupied volume, respectively. The H-bonds are formed between three atoms through electrostatic interactions. In the traditional X-H----Y system, X and Y are donator and acceptor, respectively. Hence, the H-bonds were built between the hydrogen atom and two negatively charged atoms. The strength of the H-bonds is stronger than the Van der Waals interaction but weaker than the covalent bond. In our simulations, the H-bonds were geometrically defined according to the criterion [43,44]. The distance between X–Y is lower than r = 0.35 nm and the angle of X-H--Y is less than θ = 30°. Herein, the value of r corresponds to the first minimum of radial distribution between X and Y."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Experimental design,"3.1 Experimental design Previous published research has been focusing on the effect of water on the plasticization of PVA, either by MD simulations [20–23] or by experimental [25–28]. In order to systematically investigate the effect of water contents on the mechanical properties, molecular movement and intermolecular interactions of PVA, a series of PVA films with varied water contents are prepared by sealing the dried PVA films in a glass bottle containing pre-designed water content (see Fig. 1b). The actual water content in the final PVA films are determined by TGA (see Figure S1), with their digital images of films presented in Figure S2. It was observed that the PVA film became soft and plasticine-like for PVA- 17.5 and even sticky at a water content of 30.2 wt%. In order to accurately evaluate the mechanical properties of PVA, the real water content is controlled at less than 20 wt%. mechanical performances, T g, FFV, the relaxation and intermocular H-bonding interactions of PVA are fully examined. MD simulations are used to calculate these parameters (see Fig. 1c), and the simulated values are then compared with the experimental results. This is designed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding on how water determines the mechanical properties of PVA."
10,Mechanical performances,"3.2 Mechanical performances The tensile stress-strain curved of PVA with different water content is shown in Fig. 2 , and the results are summarized in Table 1 the absolute dry PVA film exhibits a typical brittle failure without yield. It shows a high tensile strength (σ m) of around 100 MPa, a high elastic modulus (E) of 2.19 GPa (comparable to the simulated value (E s = 2.31 GPa)), and a break strain (ε b) of only 25%. In a sharp contrast, the water-containing PVA films start to behave in a ductile manner, even at a very low water content (φ) of only 1.8 wt%. the ductile failure behavior becomes more and more significant with increasing water contents, in addition to an obvious yield phenomenon. Such plasticization effects are also observed in the PVA/glycerol binary systems [45]. Only a small amount of water can significantly decrease both strength and modulus of PVA, as reflected in the PVA-1.8 sample with a σ m of 68.4 MPa (~31.6% reduction). the decrease of tensile strength with water content can be roughly classified into five water-content zones (see Fig. 2b). The σ m reduces sharply in a water content within 3 wt%, at a high slope of 14.6, which is followed by a relatively lower slope of 8.45 in a water content range from 3 to 6 wt%. Then σ m change levels off at a water content of 6–9 wt% followed by a further notable reduction with the water content increasing from 9 to 16 wt%. In comparison with the strength, the elastic modulus basically exhibits a rapid reduction as the water content increases up to 8.0 wt%, and then decreases slowly with further increase in water contents. The MD simulation shows an overall higher modulus than the experimental one in the entire water content range except for the PVA matrix. This is because the simulation is based on perfect PVA/water systems without any defects. In reality, it is nearly impossible to avoid the generation of defects, such as the introduction of dusts, during the casting and drying of the PVA films. The defects can significantly reduce the modulus values of the final PVA films. Moreover, it is well-known that the experimental modulus values of PVA films are strongly dependent on the tension rate during tensile tests, e.g., a high the tension rate usually leading to a higher modulus of the PVA film. In addition, the experiment results show a gradually reduced degree of crystallinity with increasing water contents (see Figure S3), which accounts for the decreased E s. Generally, the polymer crystallinity is defined as the ratio of crystalline phase in the bulk polymer, and is closely related to ordered arrangements of polymer chains, which renders it nearly impossible to calculate the crystallinity degree by the MD simulation. Instead, the previous work of MD simulations has focused on the conformational features in crystallization process to understand the polymer crystallization [46]. In present MD simulations, the polymer crystallization is characterized by torsion changes of backbone (the extensional deformation of backbone segments). The relationship between the torsion angle of the backbone and the temperature for varied water contents is illustrated in Figure S4. The enhancement of crystallization corresponds to reduced torsion of the backbone, as reflected by a smaller backbone torsion of PVA-2.5 than PVA-15, agreeing well with the DSC results (Figure S3). Meanwhile, the calculated Poisson's ratios are around 0.3, agreeing well with the typical values (0.2–0.4) of polymer materials [47]. On the contrary, the break strain (ε b) or the ductility of PVA increases from 25% (0 wt% water) to 324% (8.2 wt% water), indicative of a 12-fold increase. With further increasing water contents, the strain-at-failure decreases then becomes steady. In addition, the toughness (τ) achieves a peak value of 73.3 MJ/m3 at a water content of ~4.9 wt%, as compared to 18.7 MJ/m3 for the dried PVA The reduced strength and modulus as well as increased ductility strongly demonstrate that the presence of water is capable of affecting the macroscopic mechanical deformation of PVA through interfering its chain movement and crystallinity as well as intermolecular H-bonding interactions. Shi et al. has recently revealed that the water content significantly influences mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of PVA hydrogel with water content under uniaxial tensile conditions by using MD simulation [48]."
11,Glass transition temperatures and free volume,"3.3 Glass transition temperatures and free volume In addition to the mechanical property, the T g is another critical macroscopic feature of a polymer material because it determines the temperature uplimit of their practical applications. Physically, the T g of a semicrytalline polymer reflects the movement of the polymer segments and its intermolecular interactions, and thus affects the macroscopic mechanical property. We use DSC to determine the T g change of PVA films as a function of water concentrations (see Fig. 3 a and Figure S5). The T g of PVA shows a gradual decrease with increasing water concentration, which is also previously observed by Hodge et al. [27]. Interestingly, such a change trend of T g appears similar to the tensile strength (see Fig. 2b), indicative of their similar dependences on water contents. The dry PVA gives a high T g of 66.8 °C whereas only 1.8 wt% of water leads to a sharp drop in T g to 38.1 °C, and the T g value continues to decrease to 20.4 °C for PVA-8.2 and even to −8.0 for PVA-20 (see Table S1). This strongly demonstrates that the presence of water promotes the movement of PVA segments, thus reducing T g. To gain a better understanding of the effect of water concentration on T g of PVA, the T g is also calculated by MD simulations and the following Gordon-Taylor equation 12 [26]. (12a) 1 T g = w 1 T g 1 + w 2 T g 2 where T g 1 and T g 2 denote the glass temperature for pure PVA (67 °C was used as determined by the DSC for better comparison, instead of the previously reported 85 °C [48]) and bulk water (−139 °C), respectively [49], and w 1 and w 2 are their mass fractions. The theory values of the glass temperature for each system are presented in Table S2. In order to calculate the T g of PVA at different water contents, the plots of density – temperature curves should be established. In the simulation, we run high number of cycles of dynamics at different temperatures and the density of each system is calculated after equilibration. To enhance the simulated accuracy, a step size of 5 °C was chosen for each run dynamics. the simulated T g can be obtained by identifying the intersection point of two linear fitting curves of the density – temperature plots, since the density of the polymer shows a turning point appears in the vicinity of T g (see Figure S6). As shown in Fig. 3b and Table S2, the simulated T g values of PVA agree well with the experimental ones in the whole water content range of 0%–20%, except for a relatively large deviation the PVA-20. However, as-simulated T g of PVA-20 is 286 K, very close to ~293 K of PVA containing 21 wt% water [23].In comparison, the theoretical T gs by the Gordon-Taylor equation exhibit certain deviations from the simulated and experimental values in the water content range from 1.0 wt% to 10 wt%, but are in good consistence to the experimental ones at the water content above 10 wt%. Moreover, it is easy to understand such differences in the experimental T g values from those by the MD simulation and the Gordon-Taylor equation, if the impact of the simulated cooling rate and intermolecular H-bonding between water and PVA on the T g values are considered. Overall, the experimental T g values of PVA exhibit a similar trend to both the simulated and theoretical values as the water concentration increases (see Fig. 3b). It is understandable that the increased water molecules can promote the mobility of PVA segments and reduce the activation energy for the glass transition. The MD simulation results have revealed that the glass transition of PVA-water composite depends on the cooperative behavior of PVA and water. This behavior involves the H-bonding interaction between PVA and water as well as the H-bonding among the PVA chains and the water molecules themselves [8,23]. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the H-bonding interactions between the PVA chains play a key role in determining the T g in the presence of water. In addition, the T g is closely related to the free volume, especially fraction free volume (FFV) of a polymeric material. In fact, the simulated T g is calculated on the basis of the FFV parameter. The FFV can be used to predict the relative size of free space and the dynamic of the polymer matrix. The dry PVA shows a FFV of 2.74% very close to 2.5% given by the Fox-Floxy theory. With increasing water contents, the FFV values of PVA determined by the PALS measurements first decline and then rebound after hitting the rock bottom at a water content of ~4.0 wt%, as presented in Fig. 3c and Table S2. Moreover, the Fox-Flory theory can predict the FFV very well as the water content is higher than 3.0 wt%, as reflected by its very close FFV values to those measured by PALS. However, when the water content is in the range of 0–3.0 wt%, the theory fails to predict the real FFV value of PVA. This is mainly because the Fox-Flory theory assumes that the FFV is a constant when the measurement temperature (herein, 25 °C) is lower than the T g of the polymer [34]. Interestingly, the simulated FFV values show a “W” shape trend with increasing water concentrations. As compared with experimental and theoretical FFV values, it seems that the MD simulation fails to predict the FFV value well at water concentrations less than 8.0 wt%, as reflected by relatively large deviations in the water content range (see Fig. 3c and Table S2). When the water content is above 8.0 wt%, the FFV values obtained by three methods nearly share a growingly upward tendency with increasing water contents. Fig. 3d–j gives the snapshots for the isosurfaces corresponding to the Connolly surface [50] at different water contents at 300 K and 0.1 GPa as well as their corresponding FFV values. In fact, it is not difficult to understand such a change trend in FFV of PVA films as a function of water contents. On one hand, the addition of water increases the interchain distance and FFV of PVA bulk because of the volume effect of water molecules; on the other hand, the strong H-bonding interactions enable water molecules to occupy the free space among polymer chains, thus reducing the FFV. Hence, the FFV value of PVA is primarily determined by the trade-off or competition of these two opposite effects. At a very low water concentration (φ w < 4.0 wt%), the strong H-bonding interactions dominate, water molecules enter the interchain space whereas their volume effect is negligible, thus resulting in gradually decreased FFV with increasing the content of water. As the water content (φ) approaches a critical value, herein, ~4.0 wt%, the volume effect of water is comparable to the intermolecular H-bonding effect, and thus the FFV reaches the bottom value. With further increased water concentrations, the volume effect of water molecules suppresses the intermolecular H-bonding one. Meanwhile, because of the strong H-bonding interactions between water molecules themselves tend to form water clusters with much large volume. As a result, the FFV shows a steady increase as water contents increase."
12,Relaxation and dynamics of PVA chains,"3.4 Relaxation and dynamics of PVA chains The viscoelastic behavior can reflect the relaxation and movement of polymer chains in the presence of another component. In order to maintain the water content during DMA measurements, the water content of PVA films are controlled by the relative humidity (RH) of the test chamber. As presented in Fig. 4 , the storage modulus of PVA exhibits a gradual decrease with increasing water concentrations in the whole frequency range. For example, at 1.0 Hz, a storage modulus of ~5000 MPa is achieved for the PVA-0.5 (0.5 wt% water), ~2500 MPa for PVA-3.7, ~500 MPa for PVA-7.8, and ~15 MPa for PVA-17.5. According to the relationship between the T g and water contents, one can calculate the T g of PVA with varied water contents, with detailed data listed in Table 2 . When the water content is < ~6.2 wt%, the measurement temperature (T) is higher than the T g value of PVA films, namely T < T g. Therefore, one cannot observe the relaxation of PVA chains and the loss peaks (see Fig. 4b). As the water content in the range of 6.2–7.8 wt%, the T g values of PVA films approach the T, namely T ≈ T g, where the PVA segments start to move and to relax more quickly as the water content increase. For both PVA-6.2 and PVA-7.1, there appears a very weak loss peak at 35 Hz probably corresponding to a characteristic relaxation time (τ r = 1/ω) of 29 ms of side hydroxyl groups of PVA, namely the β-relaxation [45]. Unexpectedly, a very broad loss peak is observed at 0.5 Hz, which is presumably due to a very long-time relaxation (τ r = 2000 ms) or the α-relaxation of the PVA. Such α-relaxation is attributed to the movement of PVA segments because at this water content the environmental T is moderately higher than the T g of PVA, thus providing thermal energy. Moreover, there is another loss peak at a high frequency of 121 Hz (τ r = 8.3 ms) due to the β-relaxation of side hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, with further increase in the water content, the T > T g, another loss peak is determined at a higher frequency at 121 Hz (τ r = 8.3 ms), in addition to the α-relaxation peak at 35 Hz (τ r = 29 ms). Moreover, both the intensity of loss peaks turns stronger with increasing water contents, strongly indicating that they are closely related to water molecules. The loss peaks at 35 and 121 Hz are respectively to the relaxation of PVA segment and side hydroxyl groups because the H-bonding between PVA and water can further reduce their vibration energy. The diffusion behavior of PVA chains significantly depends upon the water content and their interactions. The diffusion coefficient (D) of polymer chains or small molecules can be calculated by using the following Einstein relation (Equation 12). (12b) D = | r i → ( t ) − r i → ( 0 ) | 2 6 t where r i → ( t ) is the diffusion trajectory of molecule i and t represents the time. | r i → ( t ) − r i → ( 0 ) | 2 denotes the mean square displacement (MSD) by averaging over all possible time origins as well as all molecules in the simulation. If there are N equivalent permeant molecules, the MSD can be denoted as following: (13) M S D = ∑ i = 0 N D i N The MD simulations have previously demonstrated that the PVA chains affect the diffusion dynamics of water [2,23], and vice versa the amount of additional small molecules also influences the dynamics of polymer chains [51,52]. As shown in Fig. 5 , the increase of the water content results in faster diffusion of both PVA (Fig. 5a) and water (Fig. 5b), and meanwhile, the water molecules diffuse more rapidly than the PVA chains. Unlike the water molecules whose diffusion steadily continue to increase, the diffusion of PVA chains gradually increases as the water concentration increases to ~5.0 wt%, which followed by a moderate decrease as water contents increases to ~10 wt%. With further increasing water contents, the PVA chains diffuse quickly again and continue to become faster as water contents reach 30 wt%. Such interesting diffusion trend of PVA and water can be reflected by their D values as a function of water contents (see Fig. 5c). It is easy to understand that water molecules diffuse faster with increasing water contents mainly because of their smaller size and higher degree of freedom than long PVA chains. Another reason is that at a low water content the water molecules are confined within the PVA chains due to their strong H-bonding interactions. As the water concentration increases, water molecules can also increase the interchain distance of PVA, thus leading to more free space for water molecules to diffuse. In comparison, at a relatively low water content less than 5.0 wt%, the intermolecular H-bonding among PVA chains is partially replaced by the H-bonding interactions between PVA and water. As a result, the small water can also promote the diffusion of PVA chains that form strong H-bonding with water. On the other hand, the increase in water contents also leads to reduced free volume of the PVA bulk, as reflected by the smallest FFV at a water content of ~4.0 wt% (see Fig. 3c), thus allowing less space for PVA chains to diffuse. With further increasing water contents, the diffusion of PVA chains accelerates again because of the gradual increased FFV and the lubricative effect of water clusters. In addition, the snapshots of MD simulation provide a visual evidence that the PVA chains move faster in the PVA-10 than in the PVA-1.0 system with time (see Fig. 3d and e). Meanwhile, both the PVA chains and water molecules move more quickly as the water content increases from 1.0%, to 5.0%, to 10% and then 20% (see Figure S7-10)."
13,Intermolecular interactions and interchain distances,"3.5 Intermolecular interactions and interchain distances H-bonding interactions have been revealed to govern the mechanical properties of PVA [24], and the inclusion of water inevitably affects the H-bonding interactions of PVA because of the saturated feature of H-bonds, and the strong capability of forming H-bonding of water. The H-bonds formed between water and PVA can replace those among PVA chains, which can weaken the interactions of PVA chains and thus influence the mechanical performances and molecular movements of PVA. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the stretching vibration peak (υO-H) of hydroxyl groups of PVA gradually shift to higher wavenumbers with increasing water contents. For instance, the υO-H of PVA-20 (3360 cm−1) exhibits a blueshift as high as 39 cm−1 as compared to the dry PVA (3321 cm−1) [54]. Moreover, the relative H-bonding density of PVA films also steadily augments as the water content increases because water molecules can form much more H-bonds than PVA. The peak analyzer fitting is employed to further confirm the H-bonding interactions between PVA and water and identify the types of H-bonding by using subtraction spectrum (see Figure S11) [35]. For the dry PVA, it shows a relatively broad absorption peak of hydroxyl groups (υO-H) of centered at 3321 cm−1 (see Fig. 6a) while the water shows a vibration peak at 3445 cm−1 corresponding to stretching vibration of O–H in water molecules (see Figure S11b). By using the subtraction spectrum method, a new absorption peak at 3245 cm−1 appears and turns stronger with increasing water content, which is attributed to the H-bonded O–H groups between PVA and water. Meanwhile, the absorption peak of O–H in water molecules shifts to 3408 cm−1. By fitting three vibration peaks of O–H at 3408 cm−1 (H2O–H2O), 3321 cm−1 (PVA-PVA) and 3245 cm−1 (PVA-H2O), their relative contents can be calculated by fitting with using Origin 2017 software. Upon the introduction of water molecules, water molecules will either form intermolecular H-bonding with PVA and/or intramolecular H-bonding among water molecules depending on the water content in the PVA. The absorption peaks of different types of water are strongly dependent on the H-bonding, and the H-bonding between water and PVA can give rise to a red shift [35,36]. With the aid of the peak analyzer fitting, two more absorption peaks are fitted respectively centered at 3498 cm−1 belong to H-bonded O–H of water-water and 3320 cm−1 arising from the H-bonded O–H of water-PVA. This can be evidenced by their steadily increasing relative contents with increasing water concentrations (see Figure S11). In addition, the MD simulation shows that the interactions energy between PVA and water also increases with increased water contents (Figure S12). This clearly indicates the strong H-bonding interactions between PVA and water molecules. After fitting the total H-bonds using the Origin software (see Figure S11), one can normalize the respective number (#) of three types of H-bonds, namely the H-bonds of PVA-PVA, PVA-water, and water-water. It is evident that with increasing water contents, the total # of H-bonds, # of PVA-water H-bonds, and # of water-water H-bonds gradually increase, whereas the # of the PVA-PVA H-bonds decreases (see Fig. 6c). Interestingly, the # of water-water H-bonds reaches the same level of that of PVA-water at a water content of ~10.3 wt% and exceeds that of the latter with further increased water contents. Such trends in the # of various H-bonds are also well evidenced by the MD simulation (see Fig. 6d). Based on the IR and MD simulation, we propose the H-bonding interactions of the PVA as a function of water contents (see Fig. 6e). Specifically, at a water content less than 2.0 wt%, the H-bonds between PVA chains (i) are dominant and individual water molecules are uniformly bounded with PVA. When the water content is in the range of 2.0–5.0 wt%, the H-bonds of PVA-water (ii) gradually increases although the i-type H-bonds still dominate, and meanwhile, the water-water H-bonds (iii) begin to appear. As the water content increases up to 10 wt%, the water-water H-bonds nearly approach those of PVA-water, leading to the extensive formation of water clusters. With further increased water contents or degree of hydration to ~20 wt%, the PVA film gradually transits to a plasticine-like state (see Figure S13). Above IR results strongly reveal that upon the addition of water, the H-bonds of PVA-water gradually replaces those of PVA-PVA, which can disrupt the intermolecular H-bonding between PVA chains. Meanwhile, the # of water-water H-bonds can outnumber that of PVA-water, giving rise to the formation of water clusters once the water content reaches a critical value, here ~10 wt% [22]. Moreover, the MD simulation results show what small water clusters start to form at a water content of only 5 wt%. In addition, Hodge et al. has previously shown that ~30 wt% is the critical water content for reaching the H-bond saturation between PVA and water. At such a water content, the PVA begins to behave in a solution-like manner but all the water molecules are still strongly bounded to the O–H of PVA, namely the nonfreezing water [26,27]. Therefore, the addition of water can disrupt and even destroy the strong H-bonding between PVA chains by replacing such interactions. As a result of the disrupted intermolecular H-bonding, the mechanical strength and modulus of PVA display a gradual decline trend with increasing water contents by the plasticization effect. In addition, such plasticization effect of water is also responsible for the reduced T g of PVA. In addition to the FFV, the T g of PVA is also relevant to its interchain distance. Therefore, the radial distribution function (RDF) g A-B(r) between the carbon atoms of two adjacent PVA chains is calculated to further investigate the effect of water content on the interchain distance of PVA. This gives the probability density of backbone carbon atoms at a distance r, which can be calculated by the following equation (14). It presents the atom density of type B averaged over all structure around A. N A , N B and N A B correspond to the atom number of type A and B and their common part [23]. (14) g A − B ( r ) = V ∑ i ≠ j δ ( r − | r A i − r B j | ) N A N B − N A B 4 π r 2 d r The RDFs of the backbone carbon of PVA, g C-C(r), and the (PVA)O–H⋯O(H2O), g O-H(r), at various water contents are respectively shown in Fig. 6f and g. The interchain distance, rC-C, of PVA shows a steady increase from 5.55 Å for PVA to 5.63 Å for PVA-10 until the water content reaches 10 wt%, and then it levels off as the water content increases to 30 wt% [53]. The slight increase of 0.08 Å in r C-C is mainly because of the strong H-bonding interactions between PVA and water, and the small size of water molecules. Assuming that the diameter (d) of free volume cavities calculated by the PALS measurements is approximately equal to the interchain distance of PVA, it is interestingly found that the d value of the cavities is about 4.80 Å, which is very close to the simulated value (~5.60 Å). Moreover, when the water content is relatively high, herein ~14.5 wt%, the experimental d value increases to the simulated 5.60 Å, which strongly indicates the reliability of MD simulations (see Figure S14). In addition, the g O-H(r) curves exhibits that the distance between PVA and water nearly maintain a constant because the length of (PVA)O–H⋯O(water) H-bond is about 1.69–1.72 Å [53], which is slightly shorter than that of two O–H bonds (~0.96 Å, see Figure S15). Fig. 6h illustrates the presence of water molecules in the PVA bulk. Despite strong H-bonding between water and PVA, the inclusion of water molecules still slightly increases the interchain distance (d) of PVA, thus leading more free space for the movement of PVA chains, especially when the water content is above 5.0 wt%. On the basis of above findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the presence of water not only disrupts the H-bonding interactions of the PVA bulk by reducing the number of PVA-PVA H-bonds, but also increases the interchain distance by forming water clusters. In addition to affecting the crystallinity of PVA, these two factors also lead to a plasticization effect at relatively low water contents, and a lubricating effect at high water contents. The combination of the plasticization effect and the lubricating effect gives rise to reduced mechanical strength and stiffness but increased plasticity and toughness of the PVA bulk on the macroscopic scale, and increased relaxation and mobility of PVA chains on the microscopic scale. Therefore, water molecules govern the mechanical properties of PVA by disrupting the intermolecular H-bonding interactions and promoting the chain movement of PVA."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, we have systematically investigated the impact of water content on the mechanical properties, glass transition, free volume and intermolecular H-bonding interactions of PVA by the combination of experimental and MD simulations. Both the mechanical strength and elastic modulus of PVA gradually decrease with increasing water contents, whereas the ductility and toughness first increase and then reduce. For instance, the presence of only 1.8 wt% of water declines the tensile strength by ~32% but increases the ductility of PVA by ~250%. Besides, the increase in water contents notably reduces the glass transition temperature and promotes the relaxation and mobility of PVA chains. The presence of water can disrupts the H-bonding interactions of the PVA bulk by replacing PVA-PVA H-bonds with PVA-water H-bonds, thus weakening the intermolecular H-bonding interactions of PVA, decreasing the degree of crystallinity, and leading to the plasticization effect. Moreover, at a relatively high water content (>5.0 wt%), water clusters begin to form and result in a lubricating effect on the PVA chains. These two factors work together to cause reduced intermolecular interactions and increased chain mobility, thus making PVA show reduced mechanical strength and stiffness but increased plasticity and toughness. This work sheds light on how water determines the mechanical performances of the PVA and gains an insightful understanding on the correlation between macroscopic performances, chain relaxation and intermolecular interactions of polymers containing small molecules."
