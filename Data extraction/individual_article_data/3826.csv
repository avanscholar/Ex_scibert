0,Introduction,"Considering the limited petroleum reserves and the potential application of higher alcohols as clean fuels, versatile additives, and other intermediates for chemical feedstocks, the synthesis of higher alcohols via coal-, natural gas- or biomass-based syngas has received considerable interest [1–5]. However, the existing technologies for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas are still at the laboratory stage due to the poor stability of the catalysts or low selectivity to higher alcohols. At present, there are four types of the catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas, namely, modified methanol catalysts [6–10], Cu-modified Fischer–Tröpsch catalysts [11–17], Mo-based catalysts [18–22], and Rh-based catalysts [23–27]. Among them, Cu-modified Fischer–Tröpsch catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and comparatively better selectivity to higher alcohols at milder reaction conditions, and are seemed to be promising for practical application. The formation of higher alcohols on Cu-modified Fischer-Tröpsch catalysts needs the synergistic function of metal Cu and Fischer-Tröpsch elements (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.). Metal Cu assists in non-dissociative activation of CO, while Fischer-Tröpsch elements act as active sites to dissociate CO to form surface alkyl and promote the carbon chain growth [13]. However, Cu-modified Fischer–Tröpsch catalysts usually have relatively lower thermal stability due to the easy sintering of the Cu particles [28,29]. Furthermore, the agglomeration of the Cu particles could also lead to phase separation in metal Cu and Fischer–Tröpsch elements, which is regarded as the main reason for the decrease in the selectivity to higher alcohols by producing hydrocarbons or methanol [30–34]. To overcome these problems, non-Cu-modified Fischer–Tröpsch catalysts were investigated in higher alcohol synthesis via syngas. Wang et al. [35] demonstrated that the CoCe catalysts could efficiently control the reaction selectivity to higher alcohols, and the CoCeO2−x site is more beneficial for higher alcohol synthesis than a CuCo center. An et al. [36] and Ning et al. [37] have recently reported a uniformly dispersed CoGa catalyst with CoGa particles trapped in the support, which is not only highly active and selective but also distinctively stable in higher alcohols synthesis. According to Jiao et al. [38], the selectivity and yield of higher alcohols were remarkably improved by doping La into the Co-based catalysts. They revealed that the existence of La decreased the reducibility of the catalyst and improved the Co dispersion. The high CO hydrogenation activity and higher alcohols selectivity of the CoLa catalyst might be attributed to the high dispersion of Co species and the appropriate molar ratio of Co/La. Han et al. [39] recently prepared the RhFe catalysts which can be used for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols and implied that the bimetallic RhFe alloy nanoparticles favored the formation of higher alcohols. Du et al. [40,41] reported that adding Fe into the Co-based catalyst promoted the formation of CoFe alloy, which was responsible for higher alcohol synthesis. Furthermore, they found that appropriate amount of Fe improved active phase dispersion and CO uptake, thus leading to the enhancement of catalytic activity. Enlightened by the catalytic results obtained from non-Cu-modified Fischer–Tröpsch catalysts, we have studied the catalytic properties of the CoZn catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas. In addition, Al2O3 is the most commercially used support for the Co-based catalysts in CO hydrogenation [42–44]. However, the strong interaction between Al2O3 support and Co leads to enhanced formation of a CoAl2O4 spinel phase. Co ions are strongly bounded in this spinel structure and are hardly reduced at temperature below 800 °C, which restrains the formation of higher alcohols [45]. It has been found that Mg or Mo oxide can be used to modify Al2O3 for reducing the unwanted CoAl2O4 spinel phase [46]. Recently, we have reported that Mn modified Al2O3 composites exhibit the favorable properties and promote the catalytic performance in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. MnAl oxide composites reduce the unwanted CoAl2O4 spinel phase, offer tunable pore sizes and surface areas, and also appear to act as barriers to hinder the active phase particles sintering [47]. Specially, the presence of Mn was found to be helpful in enhancing the adsorption of linear and bridge-type CO significantly, which contributed to the formation of alcohol and growth of carbon chain [48–51]. Therefore, Mn modified Al2O3 composite seems to be a potential support for preparing Co-based catalysts used in CO hydrogenation. In the present work, a series of the CoZn catalysts supported on MnAl oxide with different Co/Zn molar ratios were prepared and characterized using XRD, H2-TPR, N2 adsorption and desorption, CO2-TPD, CO-TPD, DRIFTS, H2-TPD, TEM, XPS, and CO-TPSR techniques. This work provided some intensive understandings for catalyst design and optimization by studying the structure-performance correlations."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of the CoZn catalysts with different Co/Zn molar ratios were synthesized by a sol–gel method. All the reagents are of analytical grade. Typical procedures were as follows. At first, Al nitrate was dissolved in deionized water to give a saturated solution. To this solution, Mn nitrate was added with mild stirring. A saturated aqueous solution of citric acid (CA) was then added at a molar ratio of CA:Mn:Al = 10:5:3. In this work, the molar ratio of Mn to Al was maintained at unity. After stirring for 1 h, the polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) was added to the solution as an esterifying agent, which reacted with the metal chelates. The molar ratio of CA to PEG 400 was adjusted to 1:0.6. The solution was successively stirred for 1 h until a sol generated (Solution A). Second, the metal nitrates with different Co/Zn molar ratios (xCo/(8 − x)Zn, x = 0; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 8) were dissolved in deionized water, while the molar ratio of (Co + Zn)/(Mn + Al) was 2:1. CA was added to the solution at a molar ratio of 1.2:1 (CA/Co + Zn) and provided the mixing of the cations at the molecular level in a sol-gel process. The solution was mixed and stirred at 50 °C for 1 h, and formed a transparent solution (Solution B). Solution B was then added dropwise into solution A under vigorous stirring. After stirring the resulting solution at 80 °C for 2 h, it was evaporated to obtain a gel. The gel was then dried overnight at 120 °C to form a xerogel. After grinding the xerogel, it was heat-treated at 450 °C for 3 h in an air stream to obtain the final oxidic precursor. The catalyst was denoted as xCo(8 − x)Zn, where x/(8 − x) is the Co/Zn molar ratio."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Rigaku D/Max-RA diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA. The specific surface areas of the samples were measured by N2 adsorption at liquid N2 temperature using a Micromeritics ASAP-2000 instrument. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out in a quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. 0.03 g of the sample was loaded into the center of a reactor tube which had been purged with Ar gas at 450 °C for 1 h. Then a reductive gas (5% H2/Ar) was introduced into the tube at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The temperature of the reactor was increased linearly from 50 to 820 °C with a ramping speed of 10 °C min−1 using a temperature-programmed controller. CO2, CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD, CO-TPD) was carried out in a quartz reactor. 0.30 g of the sample was reduced for 2 h at 750 °C in H2, and then cooled down to 30 °C in He flow. The sample was saturated with CO2 (CO2-TPD) or CO (CO-TPD) for 30 min at 30 °C until the surface was saturated. Subsequently, TPD analysis was carried out from 30 °C to 600 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed species were detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (OmniSTAR™). MS signals at m/z = 44 (CO2-TPD) or 28 (CO-TPD) were continuously recorded. H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) was performed on the same apparatus as described above. 0.30 g of the sample was firstly reduced for 2 h at 750 °C in H2, and then cooled down to 30 °C in Ar flow. The next step was H2 adsorption at 30 °C for 30 min until the surface was saturated. Subsequently, the sample was heated in a flowing Ar stream (30 mL min−1) up to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed species were detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. MS signals at m/z = 2 (H2) were continuously recorded. CO temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR of adsorbed CO in H2 flow) test was conducted in a manner similar to that of the CO-TPD. 0.30 g of the sample was reduced in a flow of H2 at 750 °C for 2 h, then purged by He at the same temperature for 1 h, and finally cooled down to 30 °C. The sample was saturated with CO for 30 min at 30 °C until the surface was saturated. After the catalyst was swept with He for 30 min, H2 in a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was passed and then the temperature was ramped at 10 °C min−1 to 500 °C. The quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for detection. In situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption were performed on a Bruker Vertex 80v FT–IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The reduced catalyst placed in the chamber was firstly pretreated in situ in flowing H2 at 400 °C for 1 h, and then cooled down to 30 °C in He flow. The background was collected at 30 °C. After slowly introduction of CO flow, the spectrum was obtained until it was unchanged with time. Subsequently, the temperature of chamber was increased to the next desired temperature for detection. The site fractions x was calculated by using extinction coefficients Ԑ for the bridge and linear modes of CO on Rh and the following equation reported in the literature [52]: x = I / Ԑ × f ∑ i = 1 n I i / Ԑ i × f i The extinction coefficients Ԑ used for the bridge and linear configurations were 85 and 26 × 108 (cm/mol), respectively. The value of f corresponding to the stoichiometric number of Co:CO ratios is 2 and 1 for the bridge and linear configurations, respectively. And the peak intensity Ii was determined from deconvolution using Omnic software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) line scans of the samples were acquired on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin microscope operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was acquired with a Thermo VG ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using an Al Kα source. The freshly reduced catalysts were carefully sealed under the protection of the Ar atmosphere. Then the samples were placed onto a thin disk in a glovebox before being transferred into the XPS system. And then, all the samples were vacuumized at room temperature and sealed to prevent oxidation before XPS test. The residual pressure in the analysis chamber was approximately 2.5 × 10−8 Pa during the analysis. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation 1.5 mL of the catalyst (40–60 mesh) diluted with an equivalent amount of quartz granules was evaluated in a pressured fixed-bed reactor at 5.0 MPa, 260 °C, and GHSV of 5000 h−1 with a H2/CO ratio of 2:1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was in situ reduced in H2 under atmospheric pressure at 750 °C for 2 h. Data was taken at steady state after 24 h on-stream. The effluent gases were analyzed using an Al2O3 column with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a carbon molecular sieve-packed column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Porapak-Q columns with FID and TCD were applied for the analysis of water, methanol and other alcohol products in the collected liquids."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD analysis,"3.1 XRD analysis In Fig. 1 , the XRD patterns of the oxidic precursors of the 8Co, 8Zn, and CoZn catalysts prepared from various molar ratios of Co/Zn were measured. The characteristic diffraction peaks for the 8Co oxidic precursor observed at 2θ of 19.0°, 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.8°, 59.4°, and 65.3° were attributed to the (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) crystal planes of Co3O4 respectively, which were indexed to Co3O4 (JCPDS#76-1802). Similarly, the 8Zn oxidic precursor was found to exhibit eight peaks located at 2θ of 31.8°, 34.4°, 36.3°, 47.5°, 56.6°, 62.9°, 68.0°, and 69.1°, which originated from the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (1 1 2), and (2 0 1) crystal planes of ZnO (JCPDS#65-3411), respectively. In addition, no clear characteristic peaks were observed for other phases, such as ZnMn2O4 (JCPDS# 77-0470). However, it can be seen that the diffraction peaks of ZnO of the CoZn oxidic precursors almost disappeared at Co/Zn molar ratio of 2/6, and completely vanished with higher Co/Zn value. Particularly, the XRD patterns also show a variation trend correlated to the chemical compositions. With an increase in the content of Zn, the diffraction peaks move to slightly lower 2θ values (inset in Fig. 1). This is related to the incorporation of Zn ions into Co oxide, resulting in the formation of ZnCo2O4 (JCPDS#23-1390) with similar characteristic XRD patterns. Therefore, it is deduced that the weak diffraction peaks of ZnO with an increase in the content of Zn may be related to the formation of ZnCo2O4. It is noted that the ZnCo2O4 phase in the oxidic precursors of the CoZn catalysts is the main phase, and plays an important role in the following reduction process to form uniform Co and ZnO composite phase. Furthermore, no characteristic peaks were observed for the other phases such as Mn or Al oxide. These results are attributed to the amorphous structure of Mn and Al oxide species. In addition, it should also be noted that Co and Zn species are mostly transformed into ZnCo2O4 phase in the oxidic precursors. The other Co and Zn species are in the state of Co3O4 and ZnO with a small amount, respectively. These oxides are uniformly mixed, owing to the metal ions being uniformly dispersed in the MnAl support. In Fig. 8(d), the STEM images of the CoZn oxidic precursor and corresponding EDS mapping of Co and Zn elements indicate that Co and Zn ions are accompanied with each other and uniformly distributed in the MnAl support. In other words, ZnCo2O4, ZnO and Co3O4 were well mixed and highly dispersed in the MnAl support. For the catalysts after reduction, the diffraction peaks of metal Co and ZnO can be seen in Fig. 2 . The characteristic diffraction peaks of Co (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) were located at 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.9°, respectively. In addition, the diffraction peaks of MnO can also be observed in the XRD profiles due to a higher crystallinity after high temperature reduction. Furthermore, the broad and weak diffraction peaks of the reduced catalysts indicate that metal Co is highly dispersed with particles in small size. According to the Scherrer equation, as shown in Table 1 , the average particle sizes of metal Co were estimated to be 8.6, 7.4, 6.1, 5.2, and 4.5 nm for the reduced CoZn catalysts with Co/Zn molar ratios of 6/2, 5/3, 4/4, 3/5, and 2/6, respectively. And the average particle size was 9.1 nm for the 8Co catalyst. It can be attributed to the fact that metal Co can keep high dispersion obtained by reducing corresponding oxidic precursors. The TEM images also confirm that the small Co nanoparticles together with ZnO are uniformly distributed in the supports (shown in Fig. 8). The small particle size is proportional to high volume grain boundaries. Because of the lower packing density of atoms in grain boundaries, diffusion along them is faster than that through the lattice [53]. Therefore, the small size of the particles with large active surface area facilitates the charge-transfer reaction on the surface of metal. In addition, the surface areas of the 8Co, 8Zn, and CoZn catalysts after reduction are compared in Table 1. It seems that the Co/Zn molar ratio did not significantly affect the surface areas."
7,H2-TPR analysis,"3.2 H2-TPR analysis Fig. 3 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the oxidic precursors of the 8Co, 8Zn, and CoZn catalysts with various Co/Zn molar ratios. All the catalysts exhibited two main peaks within the temperature range of 50–820 °C. The first peaks with the maxima around 400–550 °C were ascribed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ [54]. The second peaks at 650–800 °C were assigned to the remaining Co2+ to Co0 [55]. Furthermore, the small shoulder peaks around 500 °C were attributed to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+. No peaks corresponding to the reduction of Al species were identified during the reduction process. Thus, Mn and Al species were not reduced to the metallic state, which is in agreement with literature report [56]. Compared with the H2-TPR profile of the 8Co catalyst, it can be found that the reduction temperature of Co ions was increased with increasing the amount of Zn species. The higher reduction temperature of Co ions also is indicative of the formation of the ZnCo2O4 phase. According to the XRD analysis, with increasing the content of Zn, the ZnCo2O4 phase increased gradually. Due to the strong interaction between Co and Zn in the ZnCo2O4 phase, Co ions require higher temperature to be reduced to Co0 [57]. Therefore, the reduction temperature of Co ions in the CoZn catalysts is higher, which is likely due to the formation of ZnCo2O4 phase. This is in good agreement with the XRD results."
8,CO2-TPD analysis,"3.3 CO2-TPD analysis The CO2-TPD profiles of the 8Co, 8Zn and various CoZn catalysts after reduction are compiled in Fig. 4 . A blank CO2-TPD run was carried out on the MnAl support. The types of basic sites were related to the corresponding CO2 desorption temperature. In general, basic sites were classified as weak (Site I, <220 °C), moderate (Site II, 220–400 °C), and strong (Site III, 400–530 °C) basic sites [58,59]. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, the basicity amount of the different types of basic sites was determined and calculated via curve fitting of the CO2-TPD curves with Gaussian function. For the case of the 8Co catalyst, thermal desorption of the large amount of CO2 at about 170 °C attributed to weak basic sites demonstrates that the 8Co catalyst exhibits a lower basicity. The 8Zn catalyst exhibits a relatively broad desorption peak extending from 50 to 540 °C, with a maximum at about 470 °C, assigned to strong basic sites. The CO2 desorption peaks for CoZn catalysts were more intense compared with that for 8Co catalyst in the range of 220 °C to 530 °C. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the basicity amount of moderate/strong basic sites increased at a higher Zn content, while those of weak basic sites inversely decreased. These results suggested that the addition of Zn enhanced the basicity of the catalyst surface. Extensive studies accounted that the basicity of the catalyst facilitates the production of alcohols and other oxygenated compounds for Co-based catalysts. More information on this subject can be found in literature [60–62]."
9,CO-TPD analysis,"3.4 CO-TPD analysis The CO-TPD profiles of the 8Co, 8Zn and various CoZn catalysts after reduction are shown in Fig. 5 . A blank CO-TPD run was carried out on the MnAl support, and it did not exhibit clear desorbed CO signals. Therefore, the possibility of CO desorbed from the MnAl support could be eliminated. The amount of CO species was calculated via curve fitting of the profiles with Gaussian function and presented in Table 1. For the 8Co catalyst, the adsorbed CO species were dissociated on Co species, thus there was not an obvious peak of the CO desorption [63–65]. However, the low-temperature CO desorption peaks on the 8Zn and various CoZn catalysts appeared at around 70–420 °C, corresponding to the desorption of non-dissociated CO, which was probably the precursor for CO insertion and subsequently alcohol formation. In contrast with the CO desorption on the 8Co catalyst, there were CO desorption peaks with larger areas on the CoZn catalysts, indicating that the amount of the non-dissociated CO species are much more than those on the 8Co catalyst (shown in Table 1). Furthermore, with increasing the Zn content, the peaks of CO desorption shift to higher temperatures and the peak area increased gradually, indicating that the strength of adsorbed CO on the active sites increased and the number of the surface adsorption sites increased. Generally, the CO-TPD results suggested that the amount of non-dissociated CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface was remarkably enhanced due to the addition of Zn."
10,In situ DRIFTS analysis,"3.5 In situ DRIFTS analysis The in situ DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption on the CoZn catalyst with Co/Zn molar ratio of 4/4 after reduction are shown in Fig. 6 . All the spectra exhibited two absorption bands at 2050–2230 cm−1 and 2300–2380 cm−1, corresponding to the vibration of the non-dissociated CO and CO2 species, respectively [66,67]. For the adsorption of non-dissociated CO over the 4Co4Zn catalyst, the absorption peaks at about 2116 and 2175 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations, respectively. Furthermore, the wavenumber is lower than that of the gaseous CO (the 2140 cm−1 stretching vibration and 2200 cm−1 bending vibration) [68], indicating that the CO bond is weakened. The vibration frequency of CO bond depends upon the electron status and coordination of adsorption sites. According to a previous report [69], it is deduced that the COZn bond is formed by a charge transfer from the HOMO of CO into an empty d-orbital of Zn, and an electron back-donation from Zn into the unoccupied 2π* anti-bond orbital of CO. This back-donation to the CO anti-bond orbital weakens the CO bond, leading to the shifts of the CO absorption wavenumber. In addition, the CO2 vibration peak appears at 150 °C, which suggests that CO species were dissociated and converted to CO2 over the CoZn catalyst. Metal Co favors the formation of C* and O* through the dissociation of CO [63]. The formed O* species can oxidize CO to CO2 and the C* species convert to CH2 with adsorbed hydrogen species. Moreover, by increasing the temperature, the amount of CO2 increases rapidly. It indicates that the dissociation of CO is strongly dependent on the temperature. This is similar to the case of higher alcohol synthesis from syngas over modified Co-based catalysts [12,70,71]."
11,H2-TPD analysis,"3.6 H2-TPD analysis Fig. 7 displays H2-TPD profiles of the 8Co, 8Zn and various CoZn catalysts after reduction. A blank H2-TPD run was also carried out on the MnAl support, and it did not exhibit any desorbed hydrogen signals. Therefore, the possibility of hydrogen desorbed from the MnAl support could be eliminated. The main hydrogen desorption peaks at 50–400 °C are ascribed to chemisorbed hydrogen on the metal Co surface, according to the previous studies on the supported Co metal catalysts [72]. With increasing the Zn content, the peaks show a monotonic decrease in their area. This indicates that the ability of the CoZn catalysts for the activation of hydrogen is influenced by the Co/Zn molar ratio. The amount of desorbed hydrogen was determined and calculated via curve fitting of the H2-TPD profiles with Gaussian function (shown in Table 1). The 8Co catalyst exhibits the highest amount of desorbed hydrogen, indicating the strongest metal–hydrogen interaction, which agrees well with its higher CO conversion. The observed sequence of adsorption capacity of the catalysts toward hydrogen was 8Co > 6Co2Zn > 5Co3Zn > 4Co4Zn > 3Co5Zn > 2Co6Zn > 8Zn, again in line with the observed sequence of reaction activity for CO conversion over these catalysts (shown in Table 2 )."
12,TEM analysis,"3.7 TEM analysis The representative TEM and HR-TEM images of the CoZn catalyst with Co/Zn molar ratio of 4/4 after reduction are presented in Fig. 8(a) and (b). From the TEM images, it is assured that the uniformly distributed nanoparticles were dispersed in the supports, which can prevent their grain growth. The particle size distribution of metal Co was mainly concentrated in the range of 5–9 nm. The corresponding HR-TEM images of the nanoparticles presented the interplanar crystal spacings of about 0.204 and 0.178 nm, which correspond to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes of metal Co, respectively [73]. Meanwhile, the (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) planes for ZnO (0.261 and 0.248 nm, respectively) can also be observed in Fig. 8(b). These results of TEM analysis are in good agreement with XRD analysis. In Fig. 8(c), the STEM images of the reduced 4Co4Zn catalyst and corresponding EDS mapping of Co and Zn elements indicate that the two elements are accompanied with each other and uniformly distributed in the supports. The same distribution characteristics can also be found for the corresponding oxidic precursor in Fig. 8(d). HAADF-STEM image and HAADF-STEM-EDS line profiles are shown in Fig. 8(e) and (f). HAADF-STEM-EDS line profiles illustrate that the fluctuation of the Co and Zn content over the nanoparticles along with the position is synchronous. All the characterization results reveal that the uniformly dispersed Co and ZnO composite phase can be formed by calcination-reduction of the oxidic precursors of the CoZn catalysts."
13,XPS analysis,"3.8 XPS analysis XPS spectra of Co 2p, Zn 2p, Mn 2p, and Al 2p for the 8Co, 8Zn, and various CoZn catalysts after reduction were carried out in order to study the chemical state of the elements at the catalytic surface. For the element of Co, Fig. 9(a) shows the binding energy of Co 2p3/2 was 777.9–778.2 eV, indicating that the Co species were in the form of Co0 [74], which is in agreement with the XRD, H2-TPR and TEM results. For the case of Zn, as shown in Fig. 9(b), the peaks centered at 1021.2–1021.6 eV were mainly ascribed to the Zn 2p3/2 peaks of Zn2+ (ZnO) [74]. This is also in accordance with the results of XRD, H2-TPR, and TEM analysis which show Zn was in a Zn2+ state (ZnO) for the reduced catalyst. Furthermore, the Co 2p3/2 peak shifts from 777.9 to 778.2 eV with decreased the Co/Zn molar ratio, while a shift from 1021.2 to 1021.6 eV can be observed for the Zn 2p3/2 peak. This indicates the diminishing electron density in Co 2p3/2, resulting from the electron scavenging property of Zn 2p3/2. Therefore, a strong electron interaction between Co and Zn occurs on the catalyst surface, wherein electrons likely transfer from the Co species to the Zn species in the CoZn catalysts. In addition, the interaction between the active phase and support has an appreciable effect on the CoZn chemical environment within MnAl support. XPS spectra of Mn 2p and Al 2p for the various reduced catalysts was presented in Fig. 9(c) and (d). All spectra are qualitatively similar, indicating that there is no major change in the chemical state of Mn and Al elements at the MnAl support."
14,Catalytic performance of higher alcohol synthesis,"3.9 Catalytic performance of higher alcohol synthesis The catalytic performance of higher alcohol synthesis over the 8Co, 8Zn, and various CoZn catalysts was investigated by changing the molar ratio of Co/Zn. In addition, a blank run was carried out on the MnAl support, and it did not exhibit any CO conversion. Therefore, the possibility of conversion of CO to higher alcohols over the MnAl support could be eliminated. As shown in Table 2, CO conversion of the 8Co catalyst (63.6%) is much higher than that of the 8Zn catalyst (9.6%), and also significantly higher than that of the CoZn catalysts (15–55%). By comparing CO conversion for the CoZn catalysts, CO conversion decreased with the decrease of Co/Zn molar ratio. Based on the results of H2-TPD (shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1), adsorbed hydrogen on the CoZn catalysts were decreased with an increasing Zn content. These adsorbed hydrogen species are responsible for high CO conversion [68,75]. The 8Co catalyst which has more adsorbed hydrogen, showed highest CO conversion. For the 8Zn catalyst, the lowest amount of adsorbed hydrogen showed very less CO conversion. Therefore, the depression of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst resulted in a decrease of CO conversion. For the case of the CoZn catalysts, Co and ZnO composite phase could be formed by high-temperature reduction, which is illustrated in the characterization results above. Metal Co and ZnO mixed each other resulting in the decrease of the clusters composed of mono-Co atoms, thus leading to a decrease of the reaction activity. The alcohols selectivity shows a primary enhancement followed by a decline with increasing the Co/Zn molar ratio. This variation trend is ascribed to the following reasons. It has been reported that the non-dissociative activation of CO is essential for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas [76–78], but the ability of the 8Co catalyst for the non-dissociative activation of CO is inadequate (shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Mono-Co favors the formation of hydrocarbons through the dissociation of CO [63–65], resulting in a significant drop in alcohol selectivity. Therefore, the 8Co catalyst cannot get high selectivity to alcohols. Based on the CO-TPD data, the CoZn catalysts are favorable for the non-dissociated adsorbed CO, and the amount of the non-dissociated adsorbed CO increases correspondingly. Therefore, a higher capacity of non-dissociatively adsorbed CO is a key factor to improve the selectivity to alcohols. Furthermore, in order to better understand the influence of the Co/Zn ratio on the reaction sites, we investigated the CO adsorption by FT-IR. The FT-IR spectra of CO absorbed at 30 °C onto the various CoZn catalysts after reduction are shown in Fig. 10(a). In previous reports [36,79–81], the absorption bands at about 2035–2045 and 2021–2028 cm−1 were ascribed to the linear CO adsorption on the isolated Co sites (Site I), and the absorption bands around 2009 and 1983 cm−1 might arise from the CO bound in bridging geometries to neighboring Co atoms on the adjacent Co sites (Site II). Furthermore, with increasing the Zn content, the absorption around 2035–2045 and 2021–2028 cm−1 increased in intensity, indicating an increment in the amount of the isolated Co sites. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the quantitative estimation of the isolated Co sites (Site I) and the adjacent Co sites (Site II) revealed that the amount of the isolated Co sites increased while the amount of the adjacent Co sites decreased with decreasing the Co/Zn ratio. The amount of the isolated Co sites rose to nearly 75% at a Co/Zn molar ratio of 4/4. It is known that linearly absorbed CO favors CO insertion for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas [82]. Therefore, from the FT-IR spectra for CO adsorption, more CoZn linkages gave more isolated Co sites that possibly accounted for linear adsorption of CO. In addition, basic sites of the moderate/strong basic strength also play a vital role in CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols [83]. The decrease of the Co/Zn molar ratio means that the Zn content increases and the Co content decreases in the catalyst. As shown in Table 1, with increasing the Zn content, higher CO2 desorption temperature is required and stronger basic site is formed in comparison with that of only metal Co. Although higher Zn content may suppress the activity of the catalyst as mentioned above, it can contribute to the dramatic increasing in the selectivity to C2+ alcohol products. The addition of ZnO increases the surface basicity, which leads to a greater amount of basic hydroxy groups on the catalyst surface. The addition reaction of surface hydroxy groups into the metal-carbon bonds of alkyl species is facilitated to give alcohols [62]. Therefore, there is the optimal Co/Zn ratio for the CoZn catalysts. The highest total alcohols selectivity of 33.5% and C2+ alcohols selectivity of 80.0% are presented on the catalyst of 4Co4Zn, with hydrocarbons selectivity of 43.4% and CO2 selectivity of 23.1%. The stability test of the best-performing 4Co4Zn catalyst was investigated at 260 °C with a relative pressure of 5.0 MPa for up to 150 h as shown in Fig. 11 . After about 24 h, a stable operating state is achieved, with selectivity of about 33% for alcohol and selectivity of about 44% and 23% for hydrocarbons and CO2, respectively. Moreover, the conversion of CO stabilized at about 27%. No obvious deactivation is observed after 150 h of the reaction. In particular, the selectivity of C2+ alcohols was higher than 80% without obvious decrease. The stable performance can be ascribed to the uniform mixing of Co and ZnO phase which can hinder the agglomeration and retard the growth of the particles during the reaction. The CO-TPSR (temperature-programmed surface reaction of adsorbed CO in H2 flow) profiles of the 8Co, 8Zn, and various CoZn catalysts after reduction are shown in Fig. 12 . Two main peaks (I and II) at 60–440 °C were observed. The desorbed product was mainly CO at temperatures below 180 °C, and contained C1–4 hydrocarbons and C1–4 oxygenates above 180 °C. For the 8Co catalyst, there was not a clear peak of the CO desorption below 180 °C. This result is in good agreement with CO-TPD analysis. With increasing the temperature and accelerating the surface reaction, most of the ad-species remaining at the surface of the catalysts may be converted to the products of CO hydrogenation. The intensity of the higher temperature regions of peak II was consistent with higher alcohols. The peak II shifted to higher temperature when Zn was added into the Co catalysts, which implied that the CoZn catalysts have stronger ability to produce alcohols than the 8Co catalyst. It was also found that the area of the higher temperature regions of peak II (Main compounds: C2–4 oxygenates) first increased with Zn content, then reached a maximum on the 4Co4Zn catalyst, and finally decreased when the Co/Zn molar ratio was continuously decreased. Based on the above observations, we conclude that the 4Co4Zn catalyst exhibited the highest total alcohols and C2+ alcohols selectivity, which was in good agreement with the reaction results. The reaction network for higher alcohol synthesis was summarized over the CoZn catalyst as described in Scheme 1 , based on the CO insertion mechanism which is widely accepted for alcohol formation [84–87]. Higher alcohol formation needs two types of active sites, on which one type functions for CO dissociation and chain propagation (Co site) while the other type functions for CO non-dissociative activation and insertion (ZnO site). Alkyl intermediates may be formed by CH2 polymerization, which are terminated to form alkanes by hydrogenation or olefins by dehydrogenation [88]. Furthermore, alkyl intermediates may also be converted into another reaction intermediates (acyl species) by CO insertion. The formed acyl intermediate species will be terminated to form aldehydes or alcohols by hydrogenation."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, the non-Cu-based CoZn catalysts can be used to catalyze higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. After calcination of the xerogel precursors, the resultant oxides were mixed uniformly with sizes of nanometers and ZnCo2O4 is the main phase. In the reduction process, the ZnCo2O4 precursor favored forming nanoparticles of Co highly mixed with ZnO. The CoZn catalyst can enhance the concentration of moderate/strong basic sites and the amount of non-dissociated CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface, thus inhibited CO dissociation and assisted in non-dissociative activation of CO for CO insertion and subsequently alcohol formation. The results suggested that this novel catalyst exhibited good activity and high selectivity to alcohols with substantially increased the formation of higher alcohols. Furthermore, the CoZn catalyst with Co/Zn molar ratio of 4/4 shows relatively higher total alcohol selectivity (33.5%) and C2+ alcohol selectivity (80%), and exhibits good stability for higher alcohol synthesis."
