0,Introduction,"Worldwide, a transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a biomass based-economy is a latent desire due to the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improve rural development, and diversify energy sources (de Jong et al., 2012). Hydrogen (H2) from biomass could be an attractive strategy for transitioning into a biomass-based economy because it has been shown that H2 contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions (Wulf and Kaltschmitt, 2013). Likewise, H2 fed to fuel cell devices allow to produce clean energy (Mekhilef et al., 2012). The non-centrifugal sugar industry is an outstanding sector that highly contributes to the social and economic development of Colombia. To date, Colombia annually harvests 250.000 Ha of non-centrifugal sugarcane (Murcia-Pardo and Ramírez-Durán, 2017), producing about 1.3 Mton of non-centrifugal sugar, and favoring the development of 236 villages (Gutiérrez-Mosquera et al., 2018). Bagasse and sugarcane press-mud are the main by-products derived from this industry. On the one hand, bagasse is obtained after milling the sugarcane. This residue has been employed as a feedstock to produce H2 through anaerobic digestion (Hu et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2015). However, all the bagasse is consumed as fuel in local non-centrifugal sugarcane facilities to heat the evaporators where sugarcane juice is converted into non-centrifugal sugar. On the other hand, sugarcane press-mud is a residual biomass obtained from the clarification of sugarcane juice and about 1.36 Mton of residual sugarcane press-mud are annually produced, which represent almost the 2% of the total Colombian agroindustrial wastes. Most of the sugarcane press-mud is currently used as soil fertilizer, which further contaminates water sources because of the high content of phosphorus that can contribute to water eutrophication (Ochoa George et al., 2010). Also, in some facilities, sugarcane press-mud is discarded. Thereby, we propose to convert the sugarcane press-mud into H2 as a new alternative to boost the non-centrifugal sugarcane industry and reduce GHG emissions. Sugarcane press-mud conversion into H2 is still limited. Few studies have shown that sugarcane press-mud could be transformed into H2 by pyrolysis (Ansari and Gaikar, 2014) and anaerobic digestion (Radjaram and Saravanane, 2011a, 2011b). In the former case, the H2 yield was close to 22 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud, whilst in the latter case, a yield of about 0.4 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud was achieved. Usually, biological pathways (i.e., anaerobic digestion and fermentation) have shown to be less effective than chemical pathways (i.e., gasification and steam reforming). However, the selection of the pathway is closely related to the biomass nature; for instance, when the biomass moisture content is elevated, it is not advisable to employ thermochemical pathways due to an excessive energy consumption (Tumuluru et al., 2011). Therefore, the combination of biological and thermochemical pathways could be employed when a high amount of moisture and carbohydrates are present in the biomass, because ethanol could be firstly produced through fermentation, and this ethanol could be upgraded to H2 by ethanol steam reforming (ESR). ESR demands less energy than other possible technologies such as partial oxidation and autothermal steam reforming (Rabenstein and Hacker, 2008). We previously reported an H2 production of 91 g H2 kg−1 biomass when glucose was employed as a model biomass source and it was converted into H2 by coupling both pathways. Besides, power production in a fuel cell fed with H2 could be higher by 3 fold as compared to the power obtained in a combustion engine fed with anhydrous ethanol (Sanchez et al., 2016). Based on the fact that sugarcane press-mud is a residual biomass with high moisture and carbohydrate content, it could be successfully converted into bioethanol for its further conversion to H2 through ESR (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b). Fig. 1 shows the main stages that are involved in the conversion of sugarcane press-mud into H2. The main stages are: (A) biomass hydrolysis; (B) fermentation; (C) bioethanol purification; (D) and ESR for H2 production. Among these stages, controlling the nutrients content of the culture medium may enhance the bioethanol purity, which is desirable in the ESR stage (Rass-Hansen et al., 2008). However, a bioethanol purity threshold for a proper ESR is not clear and depends on the catalyst and reaction conditions. For instance, Remiro et al. (2014) showed that the lower the concentration of the impurities, the higher the H2 yield and the lower the H2 loss after 300 h time on stream (TOS) during the ESR of bio-oil/bioethanol mixtures over Ni/α-Al2O3. Other authors have employed model mixtures (i.e., ethanol + water + impurity) within an impurity concentration of 1 mol.% (Devianto et al., 2011; Le Valant et al., 2008; Palma et al., 2016). This concentration is higher than that obtained from alcoholic fermentation, but gives insights on ESR performance (Le Valant et al., 2008). Under those conditions, different bioethanol impurities have been reported as either beneficial or harmful on the H2 yield over a Rh/MgAl2O4 catalyst (Le Valant et al., 2010). Components such as amines, aldehydes, and methanol enhanced ESR, thus enhancing the H2 yield (Bilal and Jackson, 2017; Le Valant et al., 2008). Otherwise, acetic acid (Devianto et al., 2011; Le Valant et al., 2008) and alcohols, such as 1-propanol, isopropanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and 3-methyl butanol (Le Valant et al., 2008) were reported as harmful on ESR over alumina catalysts. Hence, H2 production by ESR should control the presence of certain bioethanol impurities to reach a stable catalytic process that boosts the H2 yield. In this contribution, we assess the ESR of bioethanol samples obtained from sugarcane press-mud, as an agroindustrial waste with upgrading potential, over a RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. We firstly modified the bioethanol purity during the sugarcane press-mud fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and two different culture media, one with nutrient supplementation and another without nutrients. Secondly, the ESR of these bioethanol samples were accomplished over a RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts at 700 °C and 10 h TOS, to evaluate the effect of the fermentation culture medium on the H2 yield. RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 was previously designed to increase the H2 yield by 30% compared to our previous RhPt/CeO2 catalyst. Bimetallic Rh-Pt catalysts have a low susceptibility to coke formation (Cifuentes et al., 2016). Also, we chose 700 °C as the suitable temperature for ESR because a maximum net energy is delivered from the catalytic system (Cifuentes et al., 2017). Finally, a mass and energy balance of the overall process is presented to determine the technical feasibility of H2 production from sugarcane press-mud. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the production of H2 from sugarcane press-mud agroindustrial waste through the combination of fermentation and ESR."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass samples collection and characterization,"2.1 Biomass samples collection and characterization Three different sugarcane press-mud samples were obtained from non-centrifugal sugarcane facilities in Colombia. The first sample was obtained from Ibague (4°27′59′′N, 75°03′20′′W) in January 2017, and it was named as S1. The second sample was also obtained from Ibague, but it was collected in September 2018, and it was named S2. The third sample was obtained from Chitaraque (6°,01′00′′N, 73°28′05′′W) in November 2018, and it was named as S3. After each recollection, samples were transported to Universidad de La Sabana (Bogotá, Colombia), stored in 50 mL flasks, and kept at 0 °C until their use. Compositional analysis of those samples was performed to determine moisture, solid content, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and ashes. Moisture and total solid content were measured by the oven method, as reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 2.0 g of sample were poured in a cresol and dried in an oven at 105 °C until constant weight (Sluiter et al., 2008). Carbohydrates, proteins, lipid, crude fiber, and ashes were characterized by an external laboratory (General Society of Surveillance, SGS), which is accredited under ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for the analyzed parameters. Most of the analysis was performed according to the Association of Official Agricultural Chemist (AOAC). Those analysis are described elsewhere (AOAC, 1990). Processed Excel data for moisture content and results received from SGS can be downloaded from [dataset] (Sanchez et al., 2019). Moreover, carbohydrates content was followed after each stage described in Fig. 1 through the phenol-sulfuric method proposed by Dubois et al., (1956) and Masuko et al., (2005) with some modifications. This method allows for the estimation of a wide spectrum of sugars, including polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides (Hall, 2013). The latter includes fermentable sugars such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose (Hafid et al., 2017). For that, samples were initially centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4 °C, and 6 min in a microcentrifuge (Microlite RF, Thermo, USA). The supernatant was recovered, and serial dilutions were prepared by adding 50 µL of sample in 950 µL of deionized water. 100 µL of diluted samples were added to an Eppendorf (1 mL) along with 30 µL phenol (5 wt.%, Panreac, Germany) and 300 µL H2SO4 (98 vol%, J.T Baker, Central Valley, PA, USA). Finally, 100 µL of all samples were poured in a 96-well microplate and its absorbance was read at 490 nm in a microplate absorbance reader (iMarkTM, Bio-Rad, California, USA). The amount of carbohydrates was estimated by employing glucose (Carlos Erba, Italy) as standard (0–500 µg mL−1, R2 = 0.99). Results are expressed in grams of glucose equivalent per liter (GE L−1). GE should be used as measurement unit when glucose is employed as standard (Hall, 2013)."
3,Bioethanol production,"2.2 Bioethanol production 2.2.1 Sugarcane press-mud pretreatment Approximately 2 kg of sugarcane press-mud were hydrolyzed at 130 °C for 1 h in an autoclave (Tomy SX-700, Japan) without pH modification. We previously found that these conditions deliver the highest ethanol concentration (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b). Hydrolysis was performed to ease the separation of the liquid and solid phases. After evaluating the effect of the solid concentration in the sugarcane press-mud hydrolysis over the bioethanol profile products (Section S1 in Supplementary Material), the solid concentration of sugarcane press-mud was set at 29%, because a larger amount of ethanol was produced. To reach this solid content, water was added to the sugarcane press-mud slurry. At the aforementioned solid concentration, ethanol concentration after fermentation was 97.2 ± 1.0 g L−1. At higher solid concentrations, i.e., 31 wt.%, ethanol concentration was 89.55 ± 1.3 g L−1, whose value was significantly lower than that obtained at 29 wt.% (p < 0.05) due to osmotic stress (Martínez-Moreno et al., 2012). Osmotic stress results from the high dissolved solid content present in the culture medium. Under this conditions, the enzymes involved during the alcoholic fermentation are negatively affected (Puligundla et al. 2011). Followed by hydrolysis, the sugarcane press-mud was placed in an ice water bath to stop hydrolysis and was sieved through a 70-mesh sieve (212 µm) to remove big size solids. The recovered liquid –hydrolysate– was divided into two similar fractions, and these fractions were used as a substrate for bioethanol production through fermentation, which is described as follows. 2.2.2 Fermentation Two different fractions were separated after the sugarcane press-mud pretreatment. One was supplemented with yeast extract (0.072 g g−1 carbohydrates), peptone (0.050 g g−1 carbohydrates), MgSO4·7H2O (0.005 g g−1 carbohydrates), Ca3(PO4)2 (0.002 g g−1 carbohydrates), and ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4), 0.004 g g−1 carbohydrates), and was named F-S. The other fraction was not supplemented and was named F-NS. All culture media were sterilized in an autoclave (Tomy SX-700, Japan) (121 °C, 15 min) and were fermented using a S. cerevisiae strain (Fermentis, Ethanol Red®, France), which had been activated and propagated, as previously reported (Sanchez et al., 2016). The fermentation was carried out in an Erlenmeyer flask (1 L) with a culture medium volume of 400 mL and an inoculum volume of 10 vol%, using a shaker (Innova 42, Brunswick, Germany) at 30 °C and 200 rpm (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b). 2.2.3 Bioethanol purification Bioethanol from fermentation was purified in a rotary evaporator (Heidolph®, Germany) at 0.0400 ± 0.0025 MPa and 75 ± 5 °C. Distillation tracing was monitored by quantification of the ethanol concentration in the distillate using an electronic densimeter (DMA 35, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) until the ethanol concentration was close to 46 wt.% (25 mol.%, steam-to-ethanol ratio (S/E) = 3). Ethanol recovery was measured according to Eq. (1), where mEtOH,D is the ethanol mass in the distillate and mEtOH,F is the ethanol mass in the feed. The distillates obtained from F-S were named D-S, and the distillates obtained from F-NS were named D-NS. (1) E t O H R e c o v e r y ( % ) = m E t O H , D m E t O H , F × 100 2.2.4 Ethanol and impurities quantification Different fermentation products, such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and fusel alcohols such as 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, were quantified using a Clarus 580 GC (GC, Perkin Elmer, USA), which was equipped with an Elite wax ETR column (60 m, 0.25 mm ID, Perkin Elmer) and was connected to a flame ionization detector (FID). Both the detector and the injector temperatures were adjusted to 240 °C. The oven was programmed as follows: 80 °C for 1 min, followed by a heating rate of 8 °C min−1 until 230 °C for 10 min. The limit of quantification of the technique was determined as 2 ppm through the signal-to-noise method (Shrivastava and Gupta, 2011). Raw and processed Excel data of all chromatography results for both fermentation and distillation can be observed in detail and downloaded from [dataset] (Sanchez et al., 2019)."
4,Hydrogen production from bioethanol,"2.3 Hydrogen production from bioethanol 2.3.1 Catalyst synthesis A RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method as previously reported (Cifuentes et al., 2016). Briefly, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.5% Alfa Aesar, USA) was dissolved in water and thoroughly added to SiO2 (Merck, Germany) to warrant a molar ratio of CeO2/SiO2 = 2. The mixed support was continuously stirred, dried at 105 °C for 24 h, followed by a calcination at 500 °C in a muffle (Ney Vulcan D130, Dentsply Ceramco, CA., USA) for 4 h. The active metal loadings were obtained from rhodium (III) chloride hydrate (RhCl3·H2O) (Aldrich Chem. Co., USA) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) (Aldrich Chem. Co., USA) solutions in water. Aforementioned solutions were slowly added onto the support. The metal-support mixture was stirred, followed by a drying process at 105 °C for 24 h and calcined at 700 °C in a muffle (Ney Vulcan D130, Dentsply Ceramco, CA., USA) for 2 h. The resulting Rh0.4Pt0.4/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts was sieved using an 80-mesh. Low amounts of active metals (0.4 wt.% Rh and 0.4 wt.% Pt) contribute to the economy of the process (Cifuentes et al., 2015). 2.3.2 Stability test The stability tests of the ESR was performed over the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor (ID of 12 mm) at 700 °C, with atmospheric pressure under kinetic control, according to the procedure described elsewhere (Cifuentes et al. 2016). The catalytic bed was made of 0.050 g RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 (particle size < 177 µm and surface area = 112 m2/g) and 0.250 g inert quartz particles (80 mesh). A complete characterization of the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 fresh catalyst was reported elsewhere (Cifuentes et al., 2016). The RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst was reduced in situ with 8% H2/N2 (300 cm3 min−1) at 700 °C for 1 h. ESR of D-S and D-NS bioethanol samples was conducted at 63,500 h−1 of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to avoid mass transfer limitations in the system. Their behavior was compared to a control sample of the synthetic ethanol/water mixture with the same S/E ratio of 3 (named SE). The feed was 0.03 cm3 min−1 of the bioethanol samples. Before entering the reactor, the feed was diluted in Argon (Ar) to achieve 1.8 mol.% of ethanol in the inlet stream. The stability test during the ESR was conducted for at least 10 h TOS for each bioethanol sample. The outlet products of the ESR (CO, CO2, H2, CH4, ethylene, ethanol, and other by-product compounds) were measured on-line by gas chromatography (GC, Perkin Elmer) (Cifuentes et al., 2016). Carbon elemental balances between the inlet and outlet streams were measured in all tests. Ethanol conversion ( x i ) and yield for each detected product were calculated by Eqs. (2) and (3). (2) x i = F E t O H , i n l e t E S R E - F E t O H , o u t l e t E S R E F E t O H , i n l e t E S R E ∗ 100 (3) Y i e l d i = F i , o u t l e t F E t O H , i n l e t E S R E where F E t O H , i n l e t E S R E is the initial theoretical mole flow (mol min−1) of ethanol at ambient temperature, F E t O H , o u t l e t E S R E is the mole flow (mol min−1) of unreacted ethanol in the product stream detected by GC at time t, and F i , o u t l e t is the mole flow (mol min−1) of product i. Processed Excel data for stability tests can be obtained from [dataset] (Sanchez et al., 2019). 2.3.3 Catalyst characterization Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Mettler Toledo, USA) was performed to measure carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst samples. Each sample (0.020 g) was previously degassed in N2 (150 cm3 min−1) at 105 °C for 1 h and then heated from 30 to 1000 °C in air (5 °C min−1, 150 cm3 min−1 flow rate). The inclusion of SiO2 in the support allows to increase O2 adsorption within temperature and causes the catalyst to gain weight (Cifuentes et al., 2016). Hence, mass loss ascribed to carbon deposits was estimated according with Eq. (4), where a subtraction between normalized mass samples of the fresh reduced catalyst m o u t / m i n F and the spent catalyst m o u t / m i n S was performed. m o u t is the mass in mg after the TGA analysis, m i n is the initial mass in mg, and t is the reaction time in h during the TGA, whose value was 3.25 h. (4) M a s s l o s s m g c a r b o n g c a t h = m o u t m i n F - m o u t m i n S t Raw and processed Excel data for the TGA tests can be observed in detail at [dataset] (Sanchez et al. 2019)."
5,Mass and energy balance,"2.4 Mass and energy balance Mass balance was performed by monitoring the weight of the sample before and after each operation unit show in Fig. 1 until the bioethanol production stage. Differences between the initial and final weight after the hydrolysis and sterilization were ascribed to water losses as steam. Whereas, differences between the initial and final weight after the fermentation was related with CO2 emissions (Liu and Shen, 2008). To estimate the overall production of the reforming products (i.e., H2, CO, CO2, and CH4), the area under the curve was calculated from the stability results by employing the trapezoid method. Energy balance was performed through the procedure shown in Supplementary Material S.2. Detailed mass and energy balance calculus can be observed in [dataset] (Sanchez et al. 2019)."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis A 23 full factorial experimental design was used to assess the effect of supplementation during the fermentation of sugarcane press-mud. Three different samples of sugarcane press-mud collected in Colombia were treated under two fermentation cultures: i.e., without addition of nutrients and with addition of nutrients such as peptone, yeast extract, MgSO4·7H2O, Ca3(PO4)2, and NH4(SO4)2. The Student t-test was employed to determine whether the supplementation has an effect over the bioethanol composition (p < 0.05). Additionally, a Spearman correlation coefficient (RHO) was employed to determine whether the impurities (i.e., ethyl acetate, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and acetic acid) were correlated with the H2 yield and the carbon deposits on the catalyst. Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to evaluate the data normal distribution (p > 0.05). Detailed statistical result are shown in Supplementary Material S.3. Additionally, a linear regression was performed between the H2 yield and the concentration of the impurities to estimate the H2 yield loss. Shapiro-Wilk test, RHO, and linear regression were performed using the SPSS software V24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA)."
7,Results,
8,Sugarcane press-mud characterization,"3.1 Sugarcane press-mud characterization Sugarcane press-mud, an agroindustrial waste, is manually recovered during the clarification of the sugarcane juice. Table 1 shows the compositional analysis of the samples employed in this study. The results were compared with the composition of sugarcane press-mud reported by the Colombian Corporation of Agroindustrial Research (Agrosavia) (García et al., 2007). The content of carbohydrates was 23.0 ± 4.6%, similar to that previously reported by Agrosavia (i.e., 19%). Herein, carbohydrates refer to the fermentable sugars present in the sugarcane press-mud. The content of crude fiber, which expresses the amount of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Mertens, 2003), in sugarcane press-mud was up to 2.39% of the total waste. These values are considerably lower than both the amount of fermentable carbohydrates in this sample (i.e., 23%, in Table 1) and that reported for sugarcane bagasse (i.e., 50.6 ± 0.48% glucan, 15.8 ± 0.47% xylan, 8.03 ± 0.49% Klason lignin) (Cheng et al., 2014). Therefore, crude fiber was not an outstanding source of fermentable sugars in sugarcane press-mud. After the pretreatment of sugarcane press-mud, which was employed to increase ethanol concentration based on previous studies (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b), an average of 208.7 ± 55.3 GE L−1 of total fermentable sugar in sugarcane press-mud was estimated. Afterwards, the proper amount of nutrients was added to the culture medium, as described in Section 2.2.2. After liquid-solid phase separation and sterilization, the total content of fermentable sugars was 172.2 ± 19.7 GE L−1. Losses in the content of carbohydrates was due to their decomposition into other components during sterilization (Cho et al., 2018). The conversion of sugarcane press-mud into bioethanol is explained as follows."
9,Effect of the culture medium supplementation over bioethanol characteristics during sugarcane press-mud fermentation,"3.2 Effect of the culture medium supplementation over bioethanol characteristics during sugarcane press-mud fermentation Bioethanol was produced by fermentation of two sugarcane press-mud culture media, one which was supplemented and the other without supplementation. These culture media were employed during the fermentation of three different sugarcane press-mud samples. Fig. 2 a shows the final concentration of ethanol and the main impurities for all the tested samples after 70 h fermentation at 30 °C. Accordingly, ethanol concentration varied only 1.5%, 1.0%, and 1.8% between the non-supplemented and supplemented S1, S2, and S3 samples, respectively. These results were statistically confirmed by the Student t-test, which showed that the addition of nutrients to sugarcane press-mud did not affect significantly the ethanol concentration (p < 0.05) at the fermentation conditions (i.e., T = 30 °C, 200 rpm, pH = 5.50, time = 70 h) (see Supplementary Material, Table S4.3). Samples delivered ethanol concentrations in an average of 82.1 ± 10.3 g L−1 owing to the elevated carbohydrate conversion shown in Fig. 2b. Similar carbohydrate conversions of 96.47 ± 0.97% and 94.35 ± 1.14% where measured for the non-supplemented and supplemented culture media, respectively. Therefore, S. cerevisiae was successful on the carbohydrates metabolization. Deesuth et al., (2015) reported that sorghum juice with a carbohydrate content of about 200 g L−1 produced c.a. 94.3 ± 3.6 g L−1 ethanol with almost total sugar conversion at 30 °C, 100 rpm, and 48 h of fermentation by using S. cerevisiae. Fig. 2a also shows the concentration of the main bioethanol impurities analyzed in this study. The production of ethyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol were always lower under supplemented fermentation. Contrariwise, 1-propanol increased its concentration under supplementation. Similar results were previously reported by Arrizon and Gschaedler, (2007) during the fermentation of Agave Tequilana (T = 35 °C, 200 rpm, and time = 72 h). The Student t-test results (see Supplementary Material, Table S4.3) showed that supplementation only had a significant effect (p < 0.05) over the concentration of 3-methyl-1-butanol. This clear effect is likely owing to the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to the culture medium, because yeast preferred to uptake ammonia instead of amino acids (Deed et al., 2011). Hence, the decomposition of amino acids into fusel alcohols did not proceed, so the low levels of 3-methyl-1-butanol after 70 h fermentation were observed. Vidal et al. (2013) and Sanchez et al. (2017a), (2017b) reported the reduction of that alcohol in the presence of (NH4)2SO4 during the fermentation of sugarcane juice and sugarcane press-mud, respectively. Table 2 lists the final concentration of all the supplemented and non-supplemented samples after 70 h fermentation. The main impurities such as ethyl acetate, 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and acetic acid were followed as they can remain after simple distillation. Despite both culture media achieved similar ethanol and total impurities concentrations after fermentation, impurities profile was different. Their behavior during distillation and reforming is analyzed in the following sections."
10,Samples conditioning by distillation,"3.3 Samples conditioning by distillation Bioethanol conditioning is a key step for further conversion to H2 through ESR. In this study, a simple distillation was carried out in a rotary-evaporator to purify the bioethanol stream and to adjust the S/E close to 3. This ratio corresponds to the stoichiometric ratio required to theoretically produce 6 mol of H2 per mole ethanol, and it was selected because the heat required for vaporization is lower (Khila et al., 2013). Table 2 shows the bioethanol composition after distillation. The average ethanol concentration was 25.6 ± 1.2 mol.%, which is close to the 25 mol.% target. Regarding impurities, due to the lower boiling point or the similar nature of all the alcohols present as bioethanol impurities, most of them were concentrated as distillate. Total recovery of impurities ranged from 62.9 to 100%. A clear separation was only observed for acetic acid, with a recovery in the distillate of maximum 2.75%. D-S samples were 36.5%, 11.9%, and 27.0% less contaminated than D-NS samples for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. Therefore, batch distillation was useful to adjust the S/E in bioethanol to 3 and to remove heavy components, such as acetic acid, but it was inefficient to remove alcohols. Rass-Hansen et al. (2008) found that the presence of larger amounts of contaminants in a bioethanol stream can contribute to a faster catalyst deactivation. Therefore, D-NS, D-S, and SE, were reformed to evaluate their feasibility to produce H2. Herein, SE refers to synthetic ethanol-water mixture."
11,Steam reforming of bioethanol obtained from sugarcane press-mud fermentation,"3.4 Steam reforming of bioethanol obtained from sugarcane press-mud fermentation Fig. 3 shows the product distribution during the ESR of SE over the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C and 10 h TOS. Total ethanol conversion was obtained, producing 5.13 mol H2 mol−1 ethanol inlet, which slightly reduced until 4.80 mol H2 mol−1 ethanol after 10 h TOS. Additionally, an almost constant CO yield and an increase in the CO2 yield were observed, while CH4 halved its initial production after 10 h TOS. Our previous tests on this RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst allowed us to identify that the formation of oxygen vacancies by water decomposition over CeO2 favors progressively CH4 reforming and water gas shift reaction with TOS, thus increasing CO2 production and reducing CH4 concentration in the outlet stream (Cifuentes et al., 2016). Fig. 4 shows the product distribution during ESR of all the bioethanol samples listed in Table 1 over the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C and 10 h TOS. Although the total ethanol conversion was always obtained during the tests, the product distribution was different for each distilled bioethanol sample. The H2 yield was clearly lower during the ESR of distilled, real bioethanol samples obtained from sugarcane press-mud than that from the SE (Fig. 3 vs. Fig. 4). Also, CO yield was higher than CO2 due to the reaction temperature, which favors the CH4 reforming and reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGSR) (Cifuentes et al., 2016). CO production is favored at temperature above 600 °C and low S/E values (Rabenstein and Hacker, 2008). This result is similar to that previously reported by Le Valant et al., (2011) on ESR of synthetic water-ethanol-impurities mixtures over Rh/MgAl2O4 at 675 °C. Additionally, the impurities concentration in the bioethanol had an important effect on product distribution (Fig. 4). Commonly, ethanol is adsorbed over Rh as ethoxy species which are further decomposed into both CO and CHx species. In the meanwhile, Pt improves the water gas shift reaction (WGSR), converting CO into CO2 (Cifuentes et al., 2016). CHx species can be either dehydrated to form ethylene, which polymerizates to further produce carbon deposits that deactivate the catalyst, or transformed into acetylene and CH4, which in turn can be reformed to produce H2 (Mattos et al., 2012). Therefore, bioethanol impurities affect CHx species reaction on the catalyst surface, by not only increasing carbon deposits (vide infra), but also decreasing the H2 yield with TOS (Fig. 4b and f). We have previously reported that the decreasing in H2 yield is accompanied by an increase in CO2 and CH4, because the catalyst losses its ability to reform CH4 (Cifuentes et al., 2016). In addition, during ESR, the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst changes its properties, such as basicity and oxygen storage capacity, causing the product distribution to change due to the modification of the amount of the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst. Oxygen vacancies are promoted by the presence of SiO2, which makes this catalyst very active by an increasing in the surface interaction with water to form more H2. But these properties change with time by the presence of bioethanol impurities, which consume oxygen from the support for oxidation and reforming reactions, changing the oxygen vacancies, turning the catalyst more acidic, and decreasing the interaction of the surface with the reactants (Cifuentes et al., 2016). At concentrations of impurities lower than 0.13 mol.% (Fig. 4a, c, d and e), catalyst deactivation was not observed, suggesting that, at this level, impurities are not having the drastic effect on the catalyst surface reactions. On the contrary, a drop on H2 yield was observed when the impurities concentration was above 0.16 mol.% (Fig. 4b and f). Therefore, the amount of impurities is an important factor on ESR performance, due to it can reduce the catalyst lifetime by deactivation. Catalyst lifetime will be an essential factor in the sustainable conversion of sugarcane press-mud into H2 because it influences the process feasibility as well as the GHG emissions from a cradle-to-gate perspective (Benavides et al., 2017). Consequently, supplementing the culture media have an important impact on the ESR of real bioethanol samples. Linear regressions between bioethanol impurities concentration and both H2 yield and carbon deposits were performed to better understand this relationship. Fig. 5 confirms that an increase in the impurities concentration fosters both the reduction of the H2 yield and the increase in carbon deposition over the catalyst surface (p < 0.05). Hence, from the linear regression (see Supplementary Material, Table S4-4), we calculate that every 0.01 mol.% (100 ppm) of impurities in the bioethanol sample reduces 0.0016 mol H2 mol−1 ethanol inlet and increases 0.29 mg carbon g cat−1h−1 after 10 h TOS. Remiro et al., (2014) found a similar trend for both H2 production and carbon deposition when bio-oil/bio-ethanol mixtures were reformed over Ni/α-Al2O3 at 700 °C after 5 h TOS. On the other hand, the R2 suggests that the concentration of the impurities (mol.%) can explain 70% and 58% of the total variation of the H2 yield and carbon deposits during the ESR of bioethanol, respectively (see Fig. 5). Fig. 5 also shows both the 95% confidence and prediction intervals of the linear model for both the H2 yield and carbon deposits. From the prediction interval, we calculate that when bioethanol impurities are lower than 0.06 mol.%, a H2 yield higher than 2.5 mol H2 mol−1 ethanol can be obtained during the ESR of bioethanol over RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 at 700 °C for 10 h TOS. Additionally, the Spearman correlation coefficient (RHO) was employed to define which impurity have the strongest effect over both H2 yield and carbon deposition. This coefficient is employed when there is a mixture of data that is normal and not normal distributed (Schober et al., 2018). Data for 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-propanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, 1-butanol, and H2 yield were normal distributed (p > 0.05) and data for 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-pentanol, and CH4 yield were not normal distributed (See Supplementary Material S4, Table S4-2). As a result of this test, Fig. 5 shows the RHO between the bioethanol impurities and both the H2 yield and carbon deposition over the catalyst surface. The RHO values close to 1.0 indicate a strong positive correlation between the variables, while negative values indicate a strong inverse correlation. RHO correlation between impurities and H2 yield (Fig. 5a) followed the next order: 3-methyl-1-butanol > 2-methyl-1-propanol > 1-propanol > 1-butanol > acetic acid > and ethyl acetate. The RHO correlation of impurities with carbon deposition (Fig. 5b) was positive and follows the trend: 3-methyl-1-butanol > 1-propanol > 2-methyl-1-propanol > acetic acid > 1-butanol > ethyl acetate. Alike, the H2 yield loss was strongly correlated to the carbon deposition (RHO = 0.964) and that correlation was significant (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5b). Therefore, both the H2 yield and the carbon deposition are significantly affected by 3-methyl-1-butanol (p < 0.01), which strongly affects the ESR performance under the reaction conditions (i.e., T = 700 °C, GHSV = 63,500 h−1, TOS = 10 h, atmospheric pressure) over the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. 3-methyl-1-butanol, the impurity with the major impact on the ESR, can deactivate the catalyst by different mechanisms. Firstly, 3-methyl-1-butanol could form stable carbocations over the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of olefins and further decomposition to coke. Secondly, it could also be adsorbed over the catalyst surface, rendering the surface more hydrophobic and hindering the adsorption of both ethanol and water (Le Valant et al., 2011). Besides, the impurities can react to form new species that might contribute to the catalyst deactivation, as shown during the SR of glycerol (Remón et al., 2015). Otherwise, the lowest RHO correlation with H2 yield was achieved with ethyl acetate (Fig. 5a) probably due to its low concentration in the bioethanol samples (Table 2) (Sanchez et al., 2016) (Le Valant et al., 2008). Concerning linear alcohols, such as 1-propanol (RHO = −0.613) and 1-butanol (RHO = −0.342), their effect was higher than that of both ethyl acetate (RHO = −0.131) and acetic acid (RHO = −0.179) (Fig. 5a). Concentrations of 1-butanol were too low (Table 2), so its effect could be considered as negligible. In the case of 1-propanol, its concentration is higher than that of other compounds such as acetic acid, hence, the largest concentration of 1-propanol may result in a higher loss of the H2 yield. Herein, differences among the reformed samples could be ascribed to the concentration of the impurities, mainly to 3-methyl-1-butanol, that led to a larger carbon deposition over the catalyst surface, resulting in a lower H2 yield. To control 3-methyl-1-butanol concentration in the bioethanol, the addition of nutrients might be carried out prior the fermentation as they contribute significantly to the reduction of the aforementioned component, as it is previously described in Section 3.1. In addition, impurities concentration has a negative effect over H2 yield, as its yield dropped considerably in comparison with the SE control. However, in some cases, H2 production could be constantly produced without catalyst deactivation. Indeed, catalyst deactivation was only observed when impurities level was higher than 0.16 mol.%. Therefore, the concentration of the impurities must be kept below 0.13 mol.% to favor constant H2 production at least by 10 h TOS. Additionally, it seems that the interaction of impurities during ESR of bioethanol were responsible for the lowest H2 yield and the largest among of carbon deposits over the catalyst surface. In the upcoming section, mass and energy balance is presented to determine the feasible production of H2 from sugarcane press-mud."
12,Overall mass and energy balance of the H2 production from sugarcane press-mud,"3.5 Overall mass and energy balance of the H2 production from sugarcane press-mud The mass and energy balance of the bioethanol production from sugar cane press-mud is shown in Table 3 . Results were estimated to produce 1 kg of H2 in the process shown in Fig. 1. An average of 13.5 and 19.5 kg of bioethanol have to be produced by sugarcane press-mud fermentation in a supplemented and not supplemented culture medium, respectively. The larger amount of bioethanol required under not supplementation will result in a greater consumption of raw materials, mainly water and sugarcane press-mud. Likewise, larger quantities of outputs will be produced such as vinasses and mud, which were 1.5 times higher under non-supplemented culture media instead of supplemented ones. Under supplemented conditions, 0.3% of the total sugarcane press-mud is converted into H2 through the combination of fermentation and catalysis, thus yielding an average of 3.0 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud; while under non-supplemented conditions, the average H2 yield was 2.1 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud. Hence, culture medium supplementation directly affects H2 production owning to different fermentation impurities that affect the ESR (Lazar et al., 2019). Furthermore, differences ascribed to supplementation will affect the energy supply during the conversion of sugarcane press-mud into H2. Table 3 shows that the total energy consumption was 638.2 and 448.5 MJ kg−1 of H2 under non-supplementation and supplementation, respectively. These values are similar to that reported by Hwang (2013), who showed that the energy consumption for H2 production from corn ethanol was about 330 MJ kg−1. In our calculations, 79% of the energy consumption aimed to bioethanol production in both samples, whereas ESR only contributed to the 12%. Besides, 38% of the energy consumption was attributed to the pretreatment stage, because of the elevated moisture content of the sample (>66% in Table 1). Mafe et al., (2015) showed that moisture is the main responsible of the high energy consumption during biomass pretreatment. A sensitivity analysis was done to assess the effect of key factors that strongly influence the energy consumption during the conversion of sugarcane press-mud into H2. The analysis was done to the stages that requires high energy demand, i.e., pretreatment and fermentation. Fig. 6 shows the results. During pretreatment, the amount of sugarcane press-mud is a critical variable. Whereas in fermentation, time is an outstanding variable. Fig. 6a also shows that less energy is required to pretreat supplemented samples than non-supplemented ones on fermentation. Differences was attributed to the fact that impurities concentration was higher in the non-supplemented samples. As previously discussed in Section 3.4, low H2 production was observed under non-supplementation conditions. Therefore, the lower the H2 yield during the ESR, the higher the raw material consumption, the higher the by-product production, and the higher the energy consumption to achieve similar amounts of H2. On the other hand, power stirring is the main responsible of the high energy consumption on fermentation because of the long fermentation time employed, i.e., 70 h. According to Fig. 6b, about 71% of the energy is saved on fermentation if fermentation time is shortened from 70 h to 24 h. This is feasible for supplemented samples because after 17 h of fermentation, both ethanol and impurities concentration reach the stationary phase (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b). Otherwise, non-supplemented samples will not reach the stationary phase in said time because the nutrients deficiencies will slow down the fermentation process, so lower ethanol concentration would be obtained. Low ethanol concentration is not desirable because energy demands on purification will be higher (Huang and Percival Zhang, 2011) and lower amount of bioethanol (S/E = 3) will be obtained. Consequently, differences in the energy consumption in both pretreatment and fermentation reflect the need of supplementation during fermentation. Accordingly, mass and energy balance show that supplementation plays a key role on the conversion of H2 from sugarcane press-mud by coupling biological and thermochemical pathways. In the upcoming section, this technology is compared to other reported for bio-H2 production."
13,Hydrogen production using different feedstocks,"3.6 Hydrogen production using different feedstocks Table 4 shows the H2 yield and purity from different feedstocks and technologies. Generally speaking, pyrolysis of biomass delivers higher H2 yield because all polymeric molecules (i.e., carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) are converted into lighter molecules; but pollutants can be released and the H2 purity is low. In contrast, to convert organic fractions into H2 through either anaerobic digestion or ESR, biomass samples must be pretreated to either convert complex molecules into simple structures (Tanksale et al., 2010) or to clarify and remove undesirable components (Liu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2018). The former approach is useful for lignocellulosic materials, whereas the latter approach applies for liquid-solid biomasses such as molasses. Severity factor (defined as SF = Log(R0) = t exp((T − 100)/14.75), where t is time in min and T is temperature in °C) is a parameter that integrates the effect of several factors during biomass pretreatment (Dong et al., 2017) and is useful to compare different pretreatment conditions. SF was included in Table 4 and shows that, for lignocellulosic materials such as pinewood, sugarcane bagasse, spent mushroom, and fir wood, it ranged from 1.38 to 2.09 and produces between 0.83 and 4.48 g H2 kg−1 biomass. Contrariwise, the conversion of non-lignocellulosic materials like molasses might be pretreated to hydrolyze sucrose, but in other cases, pretreatment aims to separate solid-liquid phases. In this study, sugarcane press-mud, a non-lignocellulosic biomass, was pretreated under hydrothermal conditions with a SF of 2.66 (T = 130 °C, t = 60 min) to obtain 3.03 g H2 kg−1 biomass. This value was similar to those obtained from other feedstocks. Despite SF is higher than those employed for both lignocellulosic and non-lignocellulosic materials (1.38–2.10), pretreatment was conducted to ease the liquid-solid phase separation and to increase ethanol concentration (Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2017b). A similar approach was performed by Liu et al., (2008), who pretreated sugarcane molasses under acidic conditions (T = 60 °C, t = 120 min, 5 M H2SO4) to improve the production of succinic acid (SF = 0.90). Hence, the pretreatment is not restricted to lignocellulosic materials. Other kind of materials can be pretreated to improve the performance of downstream processes such as fermentation. Nonetheless, it is important to seek for new and less sever pretreatment conditions to improve the economic and environmental feasibility of the process. Concerning the conversion of biomass to H2 through the combination of fermentation and ESR, Dan et al., (2015) employed this approach to convert fir wood into H2, with a yield of 0.83 g H2 kg−1 biomass, whereas H2 yield from sugarcane press-mud was 3.0 g H2 kg−1 biomass. The H2 yield during ESR depends on several aspects, such as catalysts, reaction conditions, and bioethanol composition. Hence, the higher H2 production from sugarcane press-mud was ascribed to a high ethanol concentration and a low amount of impurities over the RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C. Also, the low H2 yield observed during ESR of bioethanol come from fir wood is ascribed to the reaction temperature, i.e., 350 °C. The higher the temperature on ESR, the higher the H2 yield (Rabenstein and Hacker, 2008). Regarding H2 purity, which is an outstanding parameter for further application in fuel cell devices, such as the proton exchange fuel cell membrane (PEMFC), slightly higher H2 purity has been achieved by ESR. In this process, highly selective catalysts are commonly used, which promotes dehydrogenation pathways instead of dehydration or combustion reactions. During dehydrogenation, ethoxy species decompose into H2, CO, and CH4. The latest can react with water, oxygen, or CO2 to produce larger amounts of H2 and CO (Mattos et al., 2012). Despite the elevated H2 purity achieved in this study (i.e., 69.1%), whose value is closed to the thermodynamic prediction (72 mol.%), a purification step must be implemented in order to use the H2 stream in a PEMFC. The purification step must remove CO, which can be strongly adsorbed over the Pt surface of the anode layer, resulting in a anode damage and further voltage loss (Zamel and Li, 2011). To date, it has been shown that H2 streams with up to 5 vol% of CO could be supplied to a high temperature PEMFC (Devrim et al., 2018). Likewise, we recently reported a process to convert ethanol into a fuel-cell grade H2 using an ESR reactor at 700 °C and a CO removal reactor at 210 °C. The former uses RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 whilst the later employs AuCu/CeO2 as catalysts. Under those conditions, it is possible to reduce the CO content up to 70 ppm (Cifuentes et al., 2018). Further work will connect the ESR and CO removal reactors to convert bioethanol from sugarcane press-mud into fuel-cell grade H2. Furthermore, economic and environmental analysis are being currently conducted to guarantee the feasible production of electricity from sugarcane press-mud."
14,Conclusions,"We reported on the hydrogen (H2) production from sugarcane press-mud, a residual waste obtained from the non-centrifugal sugarcane agroindustry. H2 production involves the bioethanol production from sugarcane press-mud fermentation (30 °C, 72 h, 200 rpm) using a S. cerevisiae strain and two culture media, followed by a simple distillation and the ESR over a RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C for 10 h TOS. The first culture medium was supplemented with yeast extract, peptone, MgSO4·7H2O, Ca3(PO4)2, and (NH4)2SO4, showing that supplementation produced a bioethanol with lower concentrations of impurities, specially 3-methyl-1-butanol. Otherwise, under non-supplemented culture medium, an increment of the said component was observed, resulting in a poor performance during H2 production through ESR. The harmful effect of this alcohol might be related with both the interaction with other impurities present in the bioethanol and the formation of carbon deposits over the catalyst surface. Therefore, it is advisable to employ bioethanol samples with a concentration of impurities below 0.13 mol.%, which allow to produce approximately 3.0 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud by coupling biological and catalytic processes. This yield is comparable with other tested feedstocks treated by anaerobic digestion and steam reforming and shows the potential of this residue to produce renewable energy. Also, we highlight that supplementation is a key parameter during the conversion of rich carbohydrates sources to H2 through ESR of bioethanol, because increases H2 production and reduces both energy and raw material consumption."
